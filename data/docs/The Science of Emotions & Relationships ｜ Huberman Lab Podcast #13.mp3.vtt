00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.440 --> 00:10.840
 My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:10.840 --> 00:13.920
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.920 --> 00:15.940
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.760
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.760 --> 00:19.560
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.700
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.700 --> 00:23.800
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.800 --> 00:26.280
 about science and science-related tools

00:26.280 --> 00:27.840
 to the general public.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.360
 In keeping with that theme,

00:29.360 --> 00:32.280
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.900
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

00:34.900 --> 00:37.960
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

00:37.960 --> 00:40.780
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:40.780 --> 00:42.560
 to help you better understand your body

00:42.560 --> 00:44.480
 and inform your health goals.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.000
 I'm a big believer in getting blood tests taken

00:47.000 --> 00:50.440
 because it's simply the only way to get in-depth data

00:50.440 --> 00:53.080
 about your metabolic factors, hormones,

00:53.080 --> 00:55.000
 all the things that inform your immediate

00:55.000 --> 00:56.840
 and long-term health.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.380
 Nowadays, there are also excellent DNA tests

00:59.380 --> 01:00.720
 that can further inform you

01:00.720 --> 01:03.160
 about your immediate and long-term health.

01:03.160 --> 01:05.680
 Now, the problem with most blood tests out there

01:05.680 --> 01:07.240
 is that you get information back,

01:07.240 --> 01:08.160
 you get a lot of numbers,

01:08.160 --> 01:09.080
 and they'll tell you whether or not

01:09.080 --> 01:12.180
 your numbers are in normal range or high or low,

01:12.180 --> 01:13.840
 but they don't inform you what steps to take

01:13.840 --> 01:15.460
 as a consequence.

01:15.460 --> 01:17.220
 In addition, they can often be very confusing

01:17.220 --> 01:19.600
 what all the factors are and what they really mean.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.280
 Inside Tracker has a dashboard and a platform

01:22.280 --> 01:25.440
 that makes interpreting all that information really easy.

01:25.440 --> 01:27.080
 It also points you in the direction

01:27.080 --> 01:28.560
 of certain lifestyle factors,

01:28.560 --> 01:30.600
 exercise, nutrition, et cetera,

01:30.600 --> 01:31.600
 that you might want to change

01:31.600 --> 01:32.680
 in order to bring the numbers

01:32.680 --> 01:34.840
 into the ranges that you want.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.080
 So Inside Tracker is something

01:36.080 --> 01:37.700
 that I've been doing for some time now,

01:37.700 --> 01:39.840
 and it's really helped me inform the choices.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.780
 For instance, I've swapped out some of the foods

01:41.780 --> 01:43.000
 that I was eating regularly.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.760
 I found out I was actually too high

01:44.760 --> 01:46.220
 in certain vitamins and minerals.

01:46.220 --> 01:47.640
 I was too low in others.

01:47.640 --> 01:50.080
 It's really helped me adjust my diet

01:50.080 --> 01:51.720
 and my exercise regimes,

01:51.720 --> 01:53.000
 and it really gives me the confidence

01:53.000 --> 01:55.400
 that I'm on the path to long-term health.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.960
 So if you want to try Inside Tracker,

01:56.960 --> 02:00.240
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

02:00.240 --> 02:03.600
 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.680
 Use the code Huberman at checkout.

02:05.680 --> 02:08.300
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman

02:08.300 --> 02:11.160
 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans

02:11.160 --> 02:13.660
 and use the code Huberman at checkout.

02:13.660 --> 02:16.560
 Our next sponsor is ExpressVPN.

02:16.560 --> 02:18.980
 ExpressVPN is a virtual private network

02:18.980 --> 02:22.200
 that keeps your data safe and secure and private.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.400
 It does that by routing your internet activity

02:24.400 --> 02:26.560
 through their servers and encrypting it

02:26.560 --> 02:29.200
 so that no one can see or sell your data.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.320
 I started using ExpressVPN

02:31.320 --> 02:33.400
 because my bank account got hacked.

02:33.400 --> 02:35.040
 I still don't know exactly how it happened,

02:35.040 --> 02:37.120
 but it was an absolute mess.

02:37.120 --> 02:38.000
 I lost money.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.760
 I lost a lot of time.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.000
 I wouldn't want to have it happen to anybody.

02:42.000 --> 02:42.840
 When that happened,

02:42.840 --> 02:44.640
 I talked to my friends in the tech community

02:44.640 --> 02:46.360
 and they told me that even though

02:46.360 --> 02:48.560
 you think your internet connection is secure,

02:48.560 --> 02:50.280
 oftentimes it's not.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.560
 So I tend to use internet connections on planes,

02:52.560 --> 02:55.920
 in hotels, in cafes, but also at home.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.720
 And I was told that even at home,

02:57.720 --> 03:00.400
 your data may not be as secure as you think.

03:00.400 --> 03:03.700
 And so with ExpressVPN, your data is absolutely secure.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.600
 So are your online activities.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.340
 The great thing is you don't even notice

03:07.340 --> 03:08.680
 that it's operating.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.200
 It's running in the background.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.980
 You just turn it on and it goes without you realizing

03:12.980 --> 03:14.440
 that your data is being protected.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.340
 It doesn't interfere with any of your online activities.

03:17.340 --> 03:20.080
 So I use ExpressVPN when I travel,

03:20.080 --> 03:22.240
 anytime I'm outside the house, when I'm at work,

03:22.240 --> 03:23.760
 and when I'm at home.

03:23.760 --> 03:26.040
 If you want to try ExpressVPN,

03:26.040 --> 03:29.520
 you can go to expressvpn.com slash Huberman.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.480
 And if you do that, you'll get an extra three months free

03:32.480 --> 03:34.440
 on one of their one-year packages.

03:34.440 --> 03:37.700
 That's expressvpn.com slash Huberman

03:37.700 --> 03:41.200
 to get three months free on a one-year package.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.400
 The final sponsor of today's podcast is Magic Spoon.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.120
 Magic Spoon is a zero-sugar,

03:46.120 --> 03:48.840
 grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.

03:48.840 --> 03:50.940
 As I've mentioned before on the podcast,

03:50.940 --> 03:55.200
 I'm neither ketogenic nor am I all meat, nor am I vegan.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.940
 The way I eat is that early in the day I fast.

03:57.940 --> 04:00.160
 And then sometime around noon, I eat my first meal.

04:00.160 --> 04:02.800
 And that meal is always low carbohydrate.

04:02.800 --> 04:03.760
 And then throughout the day,

04:03.760 --> 04:06.200
 I maintain a low carbohydrate diet.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.740
 The fasting and low carbohydrate diet during the daytime

04:09.740 --> 04:11.720
 optimizes alertness and wakefulness.

04:11.720 --> 04:13.800
 I want to be awake and be able to work.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.780
 And then at night is when I eat my carbohydrates

04:15.780 --> 04:18.140
 because it facilitates the transition to sleep.

04:18.140 --> 04:21.120
 So for me, Magic Spoon is a terrific snack

04:21.120 --> 04:22.160
 in the afternoon.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.160
 I'll sometimes even have it with lunch.

04:24.160 --> 04:25.140
 And the reason I like it

04:25.140 --> 04:26.880
 is because it tastes really delicious

04:26.880 --> 04:29.640
 and it's compatible with the keto-friendly

04:29.640 --> 04:33.520
 or keto-like meals that I eat throughout the day.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.120
 They come in a variety of flavors,

04:35.120 --> 04:37.540
 cocoa, fruity, peanut butter, frosted.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.120
 I particularly like the frosted

04:39.120 --> 04:41.320
 because it tastes like donuts in my opinion.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.920
 And I love donuts.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.760
 As a consequence, I love Magic Spoon cereal.

04:45.760 --> 04:46.640
 I can consume it.

04:46.640 --> 04:48.000
 It tastes like a pastry.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.400
 And it has zero grams of sugar

04:50.400 --> 04:52.760
 and it's compatible with this nutritional regimen

04:52.760 --> 04:54.080
 I mentioned earlier.

04:54.080 --> 04:55.500
 If you want to try Magic Spoon,

04:55.500 --> 04:58.360
 you can go to magicspoon.com slash Huberman

04:58.360 --> 05:00.040
 to grab a variety pack.

05:00.040 --> 05:02.520
 Use the code Huberman at checkout

05:02.520 --> 05:04.160
 and get $5 off your order.

05:04.160 --> 05:06.640
 That's magicspoon.com slash Huberman

05:06.640 --> 05:09.720
 and use the code Huberman to get $5 off.

05:09.720 --> 05:12.760
 This month, we're talking all about the science of emotions

05:12.760 --> 05:15.600
 and tools related to the science of emotions.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.520
 We've talked about the science of stress and resiliency,

05:18.520 --> 05:20.600
 tools to access more calm,

05:20.600 --> 05:22.600
 tools to raise your stress threshold

05:22.600 --> 05:24.080
 to become more resilient.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.380
 We've talked about motivation

05:25.380 --> 05:27.560
 and the role of the dopamine system.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.240
 I'd like to make a couple of announcements

05:29.240 --> 05:31.120
 about some new resources.

05:31.120 --> 05:33.800
 The first one is that we have now captioned

05:33.800 --> 05:37.760
 all the Huberman Lab episodes in English and in Spanish.

05:37.760 --> 05:39.760
 We were able to do that thanks to your support

05:39.760 --> 05:42.360
 of our sponsors and on Patreon.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.680
 So now all of the podcasts have a captioning feature

05:45.680 --> 05:49.120
 on YouTube and those were done by experts.

05:49.120 --> 05:51.600
 So while there might be the occasional error

05:51.600 --> 05:54.200
 for the most part, they're very precise.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.080
 We've done that so that people that prefer

05:56.080 --> 05:58.280
 to consume the content in Spanish

05:58.280 --> 06:00.000
 or that like to read the content

06:00.000 --> 06:02.320
 from the English subtitles can do so.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.280
 And we're going to continue to expand the number

06:04.280 --> 06:07.240
 of languages that are captioned for the Huberman Lab podcast.

06:07.240 --> 06:09.100
 So we want to thank you for that resource.

06:09.100 --> 06:11.860
 It's now available for all episodes.

06:11.860 --> 06:14.160
 In addition, in previous episodes,

06:14.160 --> 06:18.360
 I've talked about NSDR or non-sleep deep rest.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.360
 NSDRs come in a variety of different forms.

06:21.360 --> 06:23.640
 There's self-hypnosis.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.480
 I've pointed you to some resources for that previously.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.120
 There's yoga nidra.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.920
 NSDR is really about achieving calm quickly

06:31.920 --> 06:35.240
 and doing that in a self-directed way for many reasons.

06:35.240 --> 06:37.260
 In order to access sleep more readily,

06:37.260 --> 06:39.680
 in order to de-stress very deeply,

06:39.680 --> 06:42.760
 in order to replace sleep that you've lost.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.280
 It also seems to aid neuroplasticity.

06:45.280 --> 06:48.260
 It can enhance the rearrangements of connections

06:48.260 --> 06:50.000
 in the brain that occur during learning.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.220
 There's scientific support for that.

06:52.220 --> 06:56.940
 There's a link in today's episode caption to a new site.

06:56.940 --> 07:00.800
 This is a YouTube video that was brought free of cost

07:00.800 --> 07:02.400
 by the folks over at Made For,

07:02.400 --> 07:05.240
 a company that's been a sponsor of the podcast previously.

07:05.240 --> 07:09.240
 So this is an NSDR script that doesn't contain

07:09.240 --> 07:11.460
 any of the intentions

07:11.460 --> 07:14.020
 or some of the more typical language of yoga nidra.

07:14.020 --> 07:17.940
 Instead, it's focused purely on the breathing protocols

07:17.940 --> 07:20.000
 as well as includes a sort of body scan

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
 where you direct your attention

07:21.000 --> 07:23.320
 to different locations around your body.

07:23.320 --> 07:26.520
 It has all the core elements of non-sleep deep rest,

07:26.520 --> 07:29.560
 but is distinct from yoga nidra.

07:29.560 --> 07:31.240
 I just offer this to you as a resource

07:31.240 --> 07:32.320
 if you'd like to use it.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.080
 It's about 30 minutes long and should be very effective

07:35.080 --> 07:37.320
 in bringing you into deep states of relaxation

07:37.320 --> 07:40.040
 for all the reasons I mentioned before.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.860
 So let's talk about emotions.

07:41.860 --> 07:44.540
 Emotions are a fascinating and vital aspect

07:44.540 --> 07:46.400
 of our life experience.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.760
 It's fair to say that emotions make up most

07:48.760 --> 07:51.920
 of what we think of as our experience of life.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.240
 Even the things we do, our behaviors and the places we go

07:55.240 --> 07:57.800
 and the people we end up encountering in our life,

07:58.740 --> 08:02.420
 all of that really funnels into our emotional perception

08:02.420 --> 08:04.120
 of what those things mean,

08:04.120 --> 08:07.000
 whether or not they made us happy or sad or depressed

08:07.000 --> 08:10.640
 or lonely or we're all inspiring.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.600
 Now, one thing that is absolutely true

08:12.600 --> 08:14.780
 is that everyone's perception of emotion

08:14.780 --> 08:16.320
 is slightly different.

08:16.320 --> 08:20.240
 Meaning your idea of happy is very likely different

08:20.240 --> 08:23.980
 than my idea of what a state of happiness is.

08:23.980 --> 08:27.680
 And we know this also for color vision, for instance,

08:27.680 --> 08:30.560
 even though the cells in your eye and my eye

08:30.560 --> 08:33.600
 that perceive the color red are identical

08:33.600 --> 08:36.360
 right down to the genes that they express,

08:36.360 --> 08:39.400
 we can be certain based on experimental evidence

08:39.400 --> 08:42.000
 and what are called psychophysical studies

08:42.000 --> 08:45.520
 that your idea of the most intense red

08:45.520 --> 08:47.640
 is going to be very different than my idea

08:47.640 --> 08:48.800
 of the most intense red

08:48.800 --> 08:51.000
 if we were given a selection of 10 different reds

08:51.000 --> 08:52.640
 and asked which one is most intense,

08:52.640 --> 08:54.920
 which one looks most red.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.440
 And that seems crazy.

08:56.440 --> 08:58.740
 You would think that something as simple as color

08:58.740 --> 09:01.380
 would be universal and yet it's not.

09:01.380 --> 09:03.720
 And so we need to agree at the outset

09:03.720 --> 09:05.600
 that emotions are complicated

09:05.600 --> 09:08.600
 and yet they are tractable, they can be understood.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.440
 And today we're going to talk about a lot of tools

09:11.440 --> 09:13.880
 to understand what emotions are

09:13.880 --> 09:16.720
 for you to understand what your emotional states mean

09:16.720 --> 09:18.220
 and what they don't mean.

09:18.220 --> 09:20.600
 And in doing that, that will allow you to place a value

09:20.600 --> 09:23.640
 on whether or not you should hold an emotional state

09:23.640 --> 09:25.720
 as true or not true,

09:25.720 --> 09:28.140
 whether or not it has meaning or it doesn't,

09:28.140 --> 09:30.000
 as well as whether or not the emotions of others

09:30.000 --> 09:32.500
 are important to you in a given context.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.360
 We're going to talk a lot about development.

09:35.360 --> 09:37.680
 In fact, we're going to center a lot of our discussion today

09:37.680 --> 09:40.160
 around infancy and puberty.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.800
 We're also going to talk about tools

09:41.800 --> 09:44.640
 for enhancing one's emotional range

09:44.640 --> 09:48.440
 and for navigating difficult emotional situations.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.480
 I am not a clinical psychologist, I'm not a therapist,

09:51.480 --> 09:53.960
 but I do have some background in psychology.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.600
 And today I'm going to be drawing from the psychology greats

09:57.600 --> 10:00.080
 not me, but from the greats of psychology

10:00.080 --> 10:03.200
 who studied emotion, who studied emotional development

10:03.200 --> 10:06.000
 and linking that to the neuroscience of emotion.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.680
 Because nowadays we understand a lot about the chemicals

10:08.680 --> 10:11.020
 and the hormones and the neural circuits in the brain

10:11.020 --> 10:13.220
 and body that underlie emotion.

10:13.220 --> 10:16.620
 So while there's no one single universally true theory

10:16.620 --> 10:18.840
 of emotion at the intersection

10:18.840 --> 10:20.620
 of many of the existing theories,

10:20.620 --> 10:21.920
 there are really some ground truth.

10:21.920 --> 10:24.220
 So today we're going to visit those ground truths.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.400
 We're going to talk about the tools that emerge from them.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.600
 And we're going to talk about some absolutely wild

10:28.600 --> 10:30.440
 and wacky experiments that people are doing

10:30.440 --> 10:31.480
 out there right now

10:31.480 --> 10:33.600
 that I don't necessarily recommend you do

10:33.600 --> 10:35.420
 of inhaling different types of hormones

10:35.420 --> 10:37.380
 and trying to get attached more quickly.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.620
 You're actually going to do some experiential stuff today

10:39.620 --> 10:40.460
 if you like.

10:40.460 --> 10:42.680
 There's some things that you can do in real time

10:42.680 --> 10:44.480
 while listening to the podcast

10:44.480 --> 10:47.120
 in order to tap into some of the mechanisms

10:47.120 --> 10:48.160
 that I'll be referring to.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.740
 So today's going to be very interactive

10:49.740 --> 10:52.680
 in a way that previous podcasts episodes have not.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.960
 If we want to understand emotions,

10:54.960 --> 10:57.680
 we have to look at where emotions first develop.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.160
 In fact, this is a critical central theme

11:00.160 --> 11:03.480
 if you want to understand brain science and psychology.

11:03.480 --> 11:06.240
 There's a rule in neuroanatomy

11:06.240 --> 11:09.160
 because if you look at 50 different brains of humans

11:09.160 --> 11:12.080
 or you compare the brains of dogs and humans,

11:12.080 --> 11:13.500
 there are a lot of differences.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.400
 Certain things are the same,

11:14.400 --> 11:15.840
 but certain things are different.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.800
 And the rule that every good neuroanatomist knows

11:18.800 --> 11:20.400
 is that if you want to understand

11:20.400 --> 11:22.400
 what a part of the brain does,

11:22.400 --> 11:23.880
 you have to address two questions.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.280
 First, you have to know

11:25.280 --> 11:28.360
 what connections does that brain area make?

11:28.360 --> 11:29.600
 What is it connected to?

11:29.600 --> 11:31.440
 Where does it get inputs from?

11:31.440 --> 11:33.600
 And where does it send inputs?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.800
 So for instance, if there's an area of the brain

11:35.800 --> 11:39.720
 that gets direct input from the neurons in the nose,

11:39.720 --> 11:42.600
 you can be pretty certain that it has some role

11:42.600 --> 11:46.500
 in analyzing smell, in measuring something about odors

11:46.500 --> 11:48.500
 or analyzing something about odors.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.760
 Now, if it also gets input from the eye,

11:50.760 --> 11:52.680
 you can also conclude that it gets input

11:52.680 --> 11:53.900
 from the visual system,

11:53.900 --> 11:57.040
 that it cares about light and photons.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.360
 This is sort of obvious.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.520
 And yet you need to know that connectivity

12:00.520 --> 12:03.280
 and you need to know what's called

12:03.280 --> 12:05.600
 the developmental origin of that structure.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.680
 You need to know where it was early in development

12:08.680 --> 12:11.600
 because things move around a lot as the brain develops.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.720
 The brain of course, is this more or less squishy thing

12:14.720 --> 12:15.960
 floating around in some liquid

12:15.960 --> 12:17.760
 that's stuffed inside your skull.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.080
 And as a consequence, things move around a lot.

12:20.080 --> 12:21.640
 They are not always in the same place

12:21.640 --> 12:24.040
 in two different species

12:24.040 --> 12:26.680
 or two individuals of the same species.

12:26.680 --> 12:28.480
 So you have to know where they started out

12:28.480 --> 12:29.760
 because where they started out

12:29.760 --> 12:31.920
 informs what they do as well.

12:31.920 --> 12:33.520
 And when we're talking about emotions,

12:33.520 --> 12:36.040
 we cannot point to one area of the brain.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.020
 We can't say that's the area of the brain

12:38.020 --> 12:39.980
 that's responsible for emotions.

12:39.980 --> 12:42.360
 There is this so-called limbic system

12:42.360 --> 12:45.600
 that has been linked to emotions in various ways.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.520
 We're going to talk about that today.

12:47.520 --> 12:50.300
 But the limbic system is just one component

12:50.300 --> 12:52.400
 of the inputs to create emotions.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.040
 It's not the place for emotions.

12:55.040 --> 12:58.000
 You can't go in and lesion one location in the brain

12:58.000 --> 13:00.080
 and eliminate emotions entirely.

13:00.080 --> 13:02.380
 It just doesn't work that way.

13:02.380 --> 13:05.400
 So first of all, we have to ask,

13:05.400 --> 13:07.180
 what are the circuits for emotion?

13:07.180 --> 13:08.760
 What are the brain areas for emotion?

13:08.760 --> 13:11.040
 And nowadays there's a lot of debate about this.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.280
 For years, it was thought that there might be circuits,

13:14.280 --> 13:15.520
 meaning connections in the brain

13:15.520 --> 13:17.240
 that generate the feeling of being happy

13:17.240 --> 13:20.400
 or circuits that generate the feeling of being sad, et cetera.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.320
 That's been challenged.

13:22.320 --> 13:25.480
 In fact, Lisa Feldman Barrett has been the person

13:25.480 --> 13:27.360
 who's really challenged this head on

13:27.360 --> 13:29.080
 and has very good evidence for the fact

13:29.080 --> 13:31.740
 that such circuits probably don't exist.

13:31.740 --> 13:33.840
 And yet I think there's good evidence

13:33.840 --> 13:35.320
 for circuits in the brain,

13:35.320 --> 13:37.960
 such as limbic circuits and other circuits

13:37.960 --> 13:40.760
 that shift our overall states

13:40.760 --> 13:43.320
 or our overall level of alertness or calmness

13:43.320 --> 13:44.920
 or whether or not they bias us

13:44.920 --> 13:46.700
 toward viewing the outside world

13:46.700 --> 13:48.760
 or paying more attention to what's going on

13:48.760 --> 13:50.460
 inside our bodies.

13:50.460 --> 13:51.800
 If none of this makes sense right now,

13:51.800 --> 13:53.680
 I promise it will make sense soon.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.980
 But the important thing to understand

13:54.980 --> 13:59.360
 is that emotions do arise in the brain and body.

13:59.360 --> 14:01.500
 They arise because there are specific connections

14:01.500 --> 14:04.200
 between specific areas in the brain and body.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.640
 And if we want to understand how emotions work,

14:07.640 --> 14:10.680
 we have to look how emotions are built.

14:10.680 --> 14:15.680
 And they are built during infancy, adolescence and puberty.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.480
 And then it continues into adulthood,

14:18.480 --> 14:21.400
 but the groundwork is laid down early in development

14:21.400 --> 14:23.300
 when we are small children.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.600
 So let's think about what happens

14:24.600 --> 14:27.040
 to a baby that comes into the world.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.400
 A baby comes into the world,

14:28.400 --> 14:30.060
 you were born into this world

14:30.060 --> 14:34.320
 without really any understanding of the things around you.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.040
 Now, there are two ways that you can interact

14:36.040 --> 14:38.800
 with the world and you're always doing them more or less

14:38.800 --> 14:41.040
 to some degree at the same time.

14:42.200 --> 14:43.760
 Those are interoception,

14:43.760 --> 14:46.320
 paying attention to what's going on inside you,

14:46.320 --> 14:48.700
 what you feel internally and exteroception,

14:48.700 --> 14:51.400
 paying attention to what's going on outside you.

14:51.400 --> 14:52.720
 Hold that in mind, please,

14:52.720 --> 14:55.840
 because the fact that you're both interocepting

14:55.840 --> 14:58.900
 and exterocepting is true for your entire life

14:58.900 --> 15:02.200
 and it sets the foundation for understanding emotions.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.600
 It's absolutely critical.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.120
 As an infant, you didn't have any knowledge

15:08.120 --> 15:09.240
 of what you needed.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.720
 You didn't understand hunger,

15:10.720 --> 15:12.160
 you didn't understand toys

15:12.160 --> 15:13.240
 when you first came into the world,

15:13.240 --> 15:16.560
 you didn't understand cold or heat or any of that.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.260
 When you needed something,

15:18.260 --> 15:21.160
 you experienced that as anxiety.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.120
 You would feel an increase in alertness

15:23.120 --> 15:25.400
 if you had to use the bathroom,

15:25.400 --> 15:28.680
 you would feel an increase in alertness if you were hungry

15:28.680 --> 15:31.480
 and you would vocalize, you would cry out,

15:31.480 --> 15:34.300
 you would act agitated, you might coo,

15:34.300 --> 15:35.860
 you might do a number of different things,

15:35.860 --> 15:39.840
 but all you knew was what you were feeling internally

15:39.840 --> 15:42.420
 and then your caregiver, whoever that might've been,

15:42.420 --> 15:43.560
 would respond to that.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.280
 So you would feel some agitation,

15:45.280 --> 15:47.220
 a caregiver would come and make a decision.

15:47.220 --> 15:52.040
 Oh, you need food and give you milk or change your diaper

15:52.040 --> 15:54.980
 or wrap you in a blanket if you were cold,

15:54.980 --> 15:56.580
 but they didn't know if you were cold,

15:56.580 --> 15:58.660
 they could just assume that you were cold.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.740
 So this is actually really important to understand

16:00.740 --> 16:04.000
 that a baby, when you were a baby and when I was a baby,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.560
 we didn't have any sense of the outside world

16:06.560 --> 16:11.560
 except that it responded to our acts of anxiety essentially.

16:11.680 --> 16:14.000
 Now, this isn't Freudian theory, right?

16:14.000 --> 16:15.000
 There are components of it

16:15.000 --> 16:16.480
 that are embedded in Freudian theory,

16:16.480 --> 16:19.080
 but all developmental psychologists agree

16:19.080 --> 16:21.120
 that babies lack the ability

16:21.120 --> 16:23.740
 to make cognitive sense of the outside world.

16:23.740 --> 16:26.200
 But in this feeling of anxiety

16:26.200 --> 16:28.280
 and registering one's own internal state

16:28.280 --> 16:30.340
 and then crying out to the outside world,

16:30.340 --> 16:33.760
 either through crying or subtle vocalizations

16:33.760 --> 16:36.240
 or even just cooing, making some noise,

16:36.240 --> 16:39.320
 we start to develop a relationship with the outside world

16:39.320 --> 16:42.920
 in which our internal states, our shifts in anxiety,

16:42.920 --> 16:46.560
 start to drive requests and people come and respond

16:46.560 --> 16:48.840
 to those requests, hopefully.

16:48.840 --> 16:52.320
 And the reason I say hopefully is that we've all heard

16:52.320 --> 16:54.720
 presumably about these cases of neglect.

16:54.720 --> 16:57.320
 There are a lot of cases where if you neglect a baby,

16:57.320 --> 16:59.880
 you neglect an adolescent or a teenager,

16:59.880 --> 17:01.600
 development doesn't go well.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.940
 And we'll touch on some of those,

17:02.940 --> 17:04.520
 but those are really extreme cases.

17:04.520 --> 17:07.120
 They're sort of like the parallel to experiments

17:07.120 --> 17:09.320
 that are often done in the laboratory with animals

17:09.320 --> 17:11.400
 where you've probably heard of these enriched environments

17:11.400 --> 17:13.600
 where they'll give mice a bunch of toys

17:13.600 --> 17:16.240
 and they'll give them some different foods

17:16.240 --> 17:17.080
 every once in a while

17:17.080 --> 17:18.760
 and they'll house them together with other mice.

17:18.760 --> 17:21.060
 And then what you find is that the animals,

17:21.060 --> 17:23.320
 they will say, oh, their brain is thicker

17:23.320 --> 17:26.440
 and their neurons have more branches to them and all that.

17:26.440 --> 17:30.540
 But that's really comparing deprivation with normalcy.

17:30.540 --> 17:33.040
 What we want to center on today instead

17:33.040 --> 17:36.060
 is what happens when things go well

17:36.060 --> 17:39.920
 and why things might not go well in certain circumstances

17:39.920 --> 17:41.980
 is interesting, but to me, not as interesting

17:41.980 --> 17:44.200
 as what healthy emotional development looks like.

17:44.200 --> 17:46.420
 And if you haven't achieved healthy emotional development,

17:46.420 --> 17:49.600
 what can be done as an intervention at later times

17:49.600 --> 17:51.280
 in order to rescue that?

17:51.280 --> 17:54.280
 So the baby, you as a baby,

17:54.280 --> 17:56.740
 you're flopping around there in your crib,

17:56.740 --> 17:59.000
 you're getting care where you need it

17:59.000 --> 18:01.120
 and when you need it, presumably.

18:01.120 --> 18:06.120
 And this gets to the basis of what emotions are about,

18:06.120 --> 18:10.280
 which are emotions are really about forming bonds

18:10.280 --> 18:13.260
 and being able to predict things in the world.

18:13.260 --> 18:15.620
 That's really what emotions are about.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.140
 Whether or not the baby feels angry or happy or sad,

18:18.140 --> 18:19.200
 we don't know.

18:19.200 --> 18:20.560
 We can guess, but we don't know.

18:20.560 --> 18:22.660
 In fact, most of the time we don't even know how we feel,

18:22.660 --> 18:24.000
 let alone how other people feel.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.480
 And that's true for adults.

18:25.480 --> 18:28.200
 So if I ask you how you feel right now,

18:28.200 --> 18:29.600
 I don't know that you could tell me

18:29.600 --> 18:32.420
 in any kind of rich language that I would say,

18:32.420 --> 18:34.120
 oh, I really understand.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.020
 If you said you were very, very depressed

18:36.020 --> 18:37.000
 or very, very happy,

18:37.000 --> 18:39.680
 I'd have some sense because of how extreme that is,

18:39.680 --> 18:41.160
 but I don't know that I would really know.

18:41.160 --> 18:43.200
 And I don't think you know how I feel right now either.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.820
 I could be furious right now or I could be very happy.

18:45.820 --> 18:47.160
 You don't have any idea.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.520
 Now, of course, we have these things called expressions.

18:49.520 --> 18:50.520
 Our pupils dilate.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.640
 There are various cues of how people feel.

18:52.640 --> 18:54.040
 We're going to talk about those cues,

18:54.040 --> 18:55.440
 but you really don't know.

18:55.440 --> 18:57.600
 And at this point, I actually just want to pause

18:57.600 --> 19:00.600
 and mention a really interesting tool

19:00.600 --> 19:02.640
 that is trying to address this question

19:02.640 --> 19:05.320
 of what are emotions and what do they consist of

19:05.320 --> 19:06.860
 that you can use if you like.

19:06.860 --> 19:07.700
 This is an app.

19:07.700 --> 19:08.520
 I didn't develop it.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.080
 I don't have any relationship to them,

19:10.080 --> 19:12.880
 but the app was developed by people at Yale,

19:14.400 --> 19:16.680
 by groups at Yale who do research,

19:16.680 --> 19:17.960
 and it's called Mood Meter.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.440
 And it's actually quite interesting.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.280
 I think it's either free or it's 99 cents.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.160
 Again, no business relationship to them,

19:24.160 --> 19:28.120
 but what they're trying to do is put more nuance,

19:28.120 --> 19:32.960
 more subtlety on our words and our language for emotions

19:32.960 --> 19:35.400
 and be able to allow you to predict

19:35.400 --> 19:37.120
 how you're going to feel in the future.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.520
 And it's actually quite interesting.

19:38.520 --> 19:40.560
 I'm on the app right now, and I know you can't see this,

19:40.560 --> 19:42.920
 but it's called Mood Meter,

19:42.920 --> 19:45.620
 and you can find it on Apple or Android.

19:45.620 --> 19:47.640
 And you go into it and it asks you,

19:47.640 --> 19:50.340
 it says to me, hi, Andrew, how are you right now?

19:50.340 --> 19:53.360
 And I click the little tab that says I feel,

19:53.360 --> 19:57.520
 and I can either pick high energy and unpleasant,

19:57.520 --> 19:59.720
 high energy and pleasant,

19:59.720 --> 20:02.840
 low energy, unpleasant, or low energy, pleasant.

20:02.840 --> 20:05.760
 And I would say right now, I feel high energy pleasant.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.320
 So I just revealed to you how I feel.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.600
 So I click on that,

20:08.600 --> 20:11.520
 and then it gives you a gallery of colors,

20:11.520 --> 20:13.920
 and you just move your finger to the location

20:13.920 --> 20:15.820
 where you think it matches most.

20:15.820 --> 20:17.960
 And as you do that, little words pop up.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.560
 I know some people are looking at this on,

20:19.560 --> 20:20.920
 or listening to this on audio only.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.960
 So say motivated, cheerful, inspired.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.040
 I would say I'm feeling right now, cheerful.

20:25.040 --> 20:27.760
 So you click that, and then you just go to the next window

20:27.760 --> 20:28.920
 and it just says, what are you doing?

20:28.920 --> 20:30.880
 And this feels like play to me,

20:30.880 --> 20:32.120
 but I'm going to call it work.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.480
 And then that's it.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.720
 And then what it does is it basically starts

20:36.720 --> 20:38.260
 to collect data on you.

20:38.260 --> 20:39.400
 You're giving it information,

20:39.400 --> 20:42.020
 and it starts to link that to other features

20:42.020 --> 20:43.680
 that you allow it access to if you like.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.080
 And it starts helping you be able to predict

20:46.080 --> 20:48.260
 how you're going to feel at different times of day.

20:48.260 --> 20:50.820
 It's actually quite accurate in certain ways,

20:50.820 --> 20:52.040
 quite interesting.

20:52.040 --> 20:55.600
 And it points to a couple of really interesting features,

20:55.600 --> 20:58.240
 which is that we don't really have enough language

20:58.240 --> 21:00.680
 to describe all the emotional states.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.180
 And yet there's some core truths

21:03.180 --> 21:05.040
 to what makes up an emotion.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.780
 And I want to review that twice during today's podcast,

21:08.780 --> 21:12.500
 because this can really help people, kids and adults,

21:12.500 --> 21:16.040
 understand better what they're feeling and why,

21:16.040 --> 21:18.920
 and when best to engage in certain activities,

21:18.920 --> 21:22.340
 and thankfully when best to avoid certain activities too.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.340
 So the way this works is the following.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.360
 You need to ask yourself at any point,

21:28.360 --> 21:29.840
 you could do this right now if you like,

21:29.840 --> 21:32.360
 what's your level of autonomic arousal?

21:32.360 --> 21:35.180
 Autonomic arousal is just the continuum,

21:35.180 --> 21:38.840
 the range of alert to calm.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.860
 So if you're in a panic right now,

21:40.860 --> 21:45.260
 you are like 10 out of 10 on the arousal scale.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.780
 If you're asleep,

21:46.780 --> 21:49.760
 you're probably not comprehending what I'm saying,

21:49.760 --> 21:51.020
 although maybe a little bit,

21:51.020 --> 21:52.480
 but let's say you're very drowsy,

21:52.480 --> 21:55.060
 you might be at a one or a two.

21:55.060 --> 21:57.160
 So you always have to ask,

21:57.160 --> 21:59.400
 where are you on the arousal scale?

21:59.400 --> 22:04.400
 And then there's this other axis, this other question,

22:04.400 --> 22:06.260
 which is what we call valence.

22:06.260 --> 22:07.720
 Now, valence is a value.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.320
 Do you feel good or bad?

22:09.320 --> 22:10.620
 I would say I feel pretty good right now

22:10.620 --> 22:11.920
 on a scale of one to 10,

22:11.920 --> 22:14.360
 I'm like, I don't know, I feel like a seven.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.680
 Got a good night's sleep last night,

22:16.680 --> 22:18.720
 had a good walk with Costello this morning,

22:18.720 --> 22:20.800
 I'm fed, I'm hydrated, I feel good.

22:20.800 --> 22:21.880
 So I'm like a seven.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.280
 So I'm alert and I feel pretty good.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.480
 And then there's a third thing,

22:26.480 --> 22:30.040
 which is how much we are interocepting

22:30.040 --> 22:32.520
 and how much we are exterocepting, all right?

22:32.520 --> 22:35.860
 So how much our attention is focused internally

22:35.860 --> 22:39.520
 on what we're feeling and how much it's focused externally.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.820
 And this is always going to be in a dynamic balance.

22:42.820 --> 22:46.000
 So for instance, if you're really, really stressed,

22:46.000 --> 22:48.040
 oftentimes that puts you in a position

22:48.040 --> 22:50.240
 to be really in touch with what's going on in your body.

22:50.240 --> 22:52.060
 If you start having a lot of somatic,

22:52.060 --> 22:53.440
 a lot of bodily sensations,

22:53.440 --> 22:56.500
 like your heart is beating so fast that you can't ignore it,

22:56.500 --> 22:59.440
 then you're really strongly interoceptive.

22:59.440 --> 23:01.000
 But also sometimes you're really stressed

23:01.000 --> 23:02.280
 because someone's stressing you out

23:02.280 --> 23:03.820
 or somebody sends you a text message

23:03.820 --> 23:07.000
 or makes a comment about a YouTube thing you posted

23:07.000 --> 23:09.020
 or something and you're really triggered by it.

23:09.020 --> 23:12.620
 That never happens to me, but if it does happen to you,

23:12.620 --> 23:14.360
 then you're exterocepting.

23:14.360 --> 23:15.400
 So there are these three things,

23:15.400 --> 23:18.180
 how alert or sleepy you are, that's one.

23:18.180 --> 23:20.520
 How good or bad you feel, that's two.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.240
 And then whether or not most of your attention

23:22.240 --> 23:25.680
 is directed outward or whether or not it's directed inward.

23:25.680 --> 23:27.720
 And much of what we call emotions

23:27.720 --> 23:30.280
 are made up by those three things.

23:30.280 --> 23:33.120
 And so let's return now to development,

23:33.120 --> 23:35.120
 but tuck that away and just kind of think about it,

23:35.120 --> 23:39.040
 alert versus asleep, good versus bad,

23:39.040 --> 23:41.380
 and focused internally or focused externally.

23:41.380 --> 23:46.380
 Because when I looked at all the theories of emotion

23:46.380 --> 23:47.220
 that were out there,

23:47.220 --> 23:49.140
 there were a lot of different components to them,

23:49.140 --> 23:50.360
 but they all seem to center back

23:50.360 --> 23:53.280
 to these same three features in some way

23:53.280 --> 23:54.520
 or to some degree or another.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.600
 And it can be very powerful to understand

23:56.600 --> 24:00.040
 and look at your emotions through that lens.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.600
 So let's return to the infant.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.500
 There's the baby in the crib.

24:04.500 --> 24:06.760
 It's mostly interocepting.

24:06.760 --> 24:10.240
 As caregivers bring it what it needs, you hope,

24:10.240 --> 24:13.040
 milk, diaper changes, et cetera,

24:13.040 --> 24:15.160
 a warm blanket if it's cold,

24:15.160 --> 24:17.240
 pull off the blanket when the baby's fussing

24:17.240 --> 24:20.240
 and it's too warm because babies get too warm also.

24:20.240 --> 24:24.640
 It starts to exterocept, excuse me, I misspoke.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.480
 I want to be very clear.

24:25.480 --> 24:27.760
 It starts to exterocept.

24:27.760 --> 24:30.340
 The baby starts to look into the outside world

24:30.340 --> 24:32.380
 and start making predictions.

24:32.380 --> 24:36.240
 It starts wondering how much it needs to cry

24:36.240 --> 24:40.160
 or predicting, well, if I cry like a little bit,

24:40.160 --> 24:43.960
 then mom comes over and I get my milk.

24:43.960 --> 24:48.160
 Or if I cry a lot, mom doesn't come over and give me milk.

24:48.160 --> 24:51.400
 So I need to really scream at the top of my head.

24:51.400 --> 24:55.480
 So babies are starting to evaluate and do all this,

24:55.480 --> 24:57.160
 but they're not doing it consciously.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.320
 They're doing this strategically

24:59.320 --> 25:01.440
 in order to relieve anxiety.

25:01.440 --> 25:05.280
 And I won't propose that that's what we do into adulthood.

25:05.280 --> 25:07.520
 But a lot of what we do in adulthood

25:07.520 --> 25:09.960
 is when we feel something, we start exterocepting.

25:09.960 --> 25:12.160
 Some people are much better at just sitting as a container

25:12.160 --> 25:14.240
 and just interocepting and paying attention

25:14.240 --> 25:15.860
 to what they're feeling internally.

25:15.860 --> 25:18.640
 But most people do a little bit of a balance of both.

25:18.640 --> 25:21.220
 We don't feel good, so we look for an item of food

25:21.220 --> 25:22.360
 that might make us feel better.

25:22.360 --> 25:25.040
 We're feeling anxious heading into the dentist

25:25.040 --> 25:26.680
 or something like that, so we text somebody.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.420
 We do this almost reflexively.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.320
 It's not always conscious.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.880
 So infants do this and we continue to do this.

25:33.880 --> 25:36.360
 We start to now balance our interoceptive

25:36.360 --> 25:38.800
 and exteroceptive focus,

25:38.800 --> 25:42.120
 our looking inward and looking outward.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.300
 And as we do that, we're starting to figure out

25:44.300 --> 25:45.740
 what gets our needs met.

25:45.740 --> 25:49.480
 Remember, emotions are really there to form bonds

25:49.480 --> 25:50.840
 and to make predictions.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.840
 And so our needs are going to be met to some degree or not.

25:53.840 --> 25:55.920
 Sometimes, sadly, there is neglect.

25:55.920 --> 25:57.440
 Sometimes people don't show up for us

25:57.440 --> 25:58.780
 the way that we would like.

25:58.780 --> 26:03.200
 And in general, our responses to that

26:03.200 --> 26:05.040
 have to do with whether or not we predict

26:05.040 --> 26:07.120
 whether or not they would or not.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.400
 When we expect something and it doesn't happen,

26:09.400 --> 26:10.360
 it's a big letdown.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.920
 That was the discussion about dopamine last episode.

26:12.920 --> 26:15.000
 So the many theories of emotion,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.560
 the triune brain theory

26:16.560 --> 26:18.440
 that you have a primitive and evolved brain,

26:18.440 --> 26:20.880
 something that's a little bit on shaky ground these days,

26:20.880 --> 26:22.320
 the idea that Darwin proposed

26:22.320 --> 26:25.080
 that there are these universal expressions of emotions,

26:25.080 --> 26:27.780
 the work of Helen Fisher on love,

26:27.780 --> 26:30.180
 that you have circuits in the brain for lust,

26:30.180 --> 26:31.900
 circuits in the brain for love,

26:31.900 --> 26:35.160
 and circuits in the brain for long-term bonds,

26:35.160 --> 26:37.240
 as well as the work of Lisa Feldman Barrett

26:37.240 --> 26:39.360
 saying that emotions are contextual,

26:39.360 --> 26:41.400
 that they have a social component.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.760
 And I'll be talking more about this,

26:43.760 --> 26:45.340
 but the work of Alan Shore,

26:45.340 --> 26:49.400
 a clinical psychologist and researcher at UCLA

26:49.400 --> 26:51.780
 about right brain, left brain,

26:51.780 --> 26:53.400
 and its role in emotional development,

26:53.400 --> 26:56.800
 all of them have strong elements of this idea

26:56.800 --> 27:00.680
 of paying attention to what's going on inward and outward.

27:00.680 --> 27:05.020
 As a young creature, an infant and young toddler,

27:05.020 --> 27:06.600
 you were mainly focused inward

27:06.600 --> 27:09.000
 and you started to understand what was going on outward

27:09.000 --> 27:12.460
 as a way of predicting what would bring you relief,

27:12.460 --> 27:14.160
 what would remove your anxiety.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.280
 And that's where the fundamental rules of your experience,

27:17.280 --> 27:19.540
 your emotional experience, were laid down.

27:19.540 --> 27:22.080
 Now, I realize that's a lot of information

27:22.080 --> 27:24.400
 and it's somewhat of an academic talk,

27:24.400 --> 27:26.060
 but there were two tools in there

27:26.060 --> 27:27.060
 that I just want to highlight.

27:27.060 --> 27:28.360
 One is the Mood Meter app.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.460
 If you're interested in it, it can give you some insight

27:30.460 --> 27:32.840
 into the different kinds of nuance within emotions

27:32.840 --> 27:35.880
 and allow you to actually predict emotional states.

27:35.880 --> 27:37.440
 If you want to try that,

27:37.440 --> 27:39.040
 then you might find that interesting.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.300
 The other one is this idea

27:40.300 --> 27:42.600
 that there are three axes to emotion,

27:42.600 --> 27:44.980
 three continuum that interact,

27:44.980 --> 27:47.120
 the level of alertness and calmness,

27:47.120 --> 27:48.560
 how good or bad you feel,

27:48.560 --> 27:50.700
 and whether or not you're mainly focused inward or outward,

27:50.700 --> 27:53.800
 because those are going to form a useful toolkit

27:53.800 --> 27:55.760
 for the information going forward.

27:55.760 --> 27:59.500
 So now let's talk about what kind of baby you were,

27:59.500 --> 28:03.600
 because that actually informs your emotionality now.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.440
 These are classic, they're actually famous experiments

28:06.440 --> 28:08.260
 done by Bowlby and Ainsworth.

28:08.260 --> 28:09.600
 Anyone that studied psychology

28:09.600 --> 28:10.860
 or has taken a psychology class

28:10.860 --> 28:13.160
 might have learned about this.

28:13.160 --> 28:15.520
 This is this classic experiment

28:15.520 --> 28:19.160
 of what was called the strange situation task,

28:19.160 --> 28:22.320
 in which, and I'm describing it very coarsely here,

28:22.320 --> 28:27.320
 I realize, but a mother and child come into the laboratory.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.880
 Yes, this has now also been done with fathers.

28:31.480 --> 28:36.160
 The baby and the mother or father play together for a bit,

28:36.160 --> 28:37.580
 and then the mother leaves.

28:37.580 --> 28:40.640
 The mother leaves for some period of time

28:40.640 --> 28:42.580
 and then comes back.

28:42.580 --> 28:47.140
 And the research is devoted to understanding

28:47.140 --> 28:50.600
 the response of the child when the caretaker,

28:50.600 --> 28:53.100
 the mother or the father returns.

28:53.100 --> 28:55.620
 Most all children, not every child,

28:55.620 --> 28:58.500
 but most children will cry

28:58.500 --> 29:00.300
 when their primary caretaker leaves.

29:00.300 --> 29:02.020
 They don't like that.

29:02.020 --> 29:03.700
 And there are good reasons for that.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.440
 They formed a bond and an attachment.

29:05.440 --> 29:08.660
 And we will talk about some of the deeper chemical reasons

29:08.660 --> 29:09.660
 for those bonds.

29:11.060 --> 29:12.900
 However, the experiment is focused

29:12.900 --> 29:15.140
 on the return of the caregiver

29:15.140 --> 29:17.540
 because Bowlby and Ainsworth

29:17.540 --> 29:21.020
 and many of their scientific offspring and colleagues

29:22.140 --> 29:27.140
 identified at least four patterns that babies display

29:27.620 --> 29:29.420
 when their caretaker returns.

29:29.420 --> 29:32.780
 And they grouped these into group A, B, C, D,

29:32.780 --> 29:36.700
 so much so that the kids were referred to as A babies,

29:36.700 --> 29:39.160
 B babies, C babies, or D babies.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.100
 You may know which one you were,

29:42.100 --> 29:43.980
 but the categories are really interesting.

29:43.980 --> 29:46.500
 The first babies are the A babies.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.100
 So these were kids that would get upset

29:48.100 --> 29:49.720
 when their caretaker would leave,

29:49.720 --> 29:52.980
 but when their caretaker would return,

29:52.980 --> 29:55.260
 the infant would respond with happiness,

29:55.260 --> 29:56.640
 with what looked like delight.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.880
 They would go to the caretaker.

29:57.880 --> 29:58.980
 They seemed happy.

29:58.980 --> 30:01.100
 If they had been fussy before or sad,

30:01.100 --> 30:03.340
 they felt relieved.

30:03.340 --> 30:07.380
 These are referred to as secure attached kids.

30:07.380 --> 30:10.100
 So they have a healthy response to separation

30:10.100 --> 30:11.740
 and they have a healthy response

30:11.740 --> 30:14.760
 to re-engaging with the caretaker.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.260
 The B babies, as they're called,

30:17.260 --> 30:21.740
 were less likely to seek comfort from their caregiver

30:21.740 --> 30:23.600
 when the caregiver would return.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.260
 So they would sometimes continue to play with their toys

30:26.260 --> 30:28.360
 or they would be with the,

30:28.360 --> 30:30.600
 they had an adult in the room while the parent was gone.

30:30.600 --> 30:31.920
 They would stay with them.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.640
 It was sometimes complicated and nuanced,

30:34.640 --> 30:37.480
 but these were referred to as avoidant babies.

30:38.820 --> 30:40.140
 Don't run away with any conclusions

30:40.140 --> 30:41.780
 about the language here just yet.

30:42.660 --> 30:46.140
 It's not clear that avoidant babies become avoidant adults,

30:46.140 --> 30:47.460
 but bear with me.

30:47.460 --> 30:52.460
 The C babies would respond to the return of the caregiver

30:52.800 --> 30:54.900
 with acts of annoyance.

30:54.900 --> 30:56.920
 They seemed kind of angry, right?

30:56.920 --> 30:58.600
 So it wasn't that they ignored them.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.300
 They seemed kind of angry.

31:00.300 --> 31:02.860
 And those were referred to as ambivalent babies.

31:02.860 --> 31:04.260
 Not to be confused with A babies,

31:04.260 --> 31:07.200
 these are the C babies were the ambivalent babies.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.620
 So the infant's reaction to the returning caregiver

31:10.620 --> 31:12.360
 were inconsistent.

31:12.360 --> 31:15.280
 They, it seemed like they wanted to bond with them again,

31:15.280 --> 31:17.780
 but that they seem kind of annoyed.

31:17.780 --> 31:19.620
 I think we've all felt this way before

31:19.620 --> 31:21.100
 with people that we care very much about,

31:21.100 --> 31:23.420
 especially people we care very much about.

31:23.420 --> 31:25.400
 And then the third category, the D babies,

31:25.400 --> 31:27.120
 were the disorganized babies.

31:27.120 --> 31:27.960
 That's what they called them.

31:27.960 --> 31:29.980
 They weren't disorganized in that they were messy.

31:29.980 --> 31:33.340
 The child avoided interactions with everyone

31:33.340 --> 31:36.140
 and acted fearful when the caregiver returned.

31:36.140 --> 31:38.180
 And their behavior didn't really change

31:38.180 --> 31:40.060
 whether or not the caregiver was there or not.

31:40.060 --> 31:42.720
 And that fourth category was actually added rather late

31:42.720 --> 31:44.660
 in the course of this research.

31:44.660 --> 31:47.740
 I should mention these experiments have been repeated

31:47.740 --> 31:51.180
 with a huge variety of different contexts.

31:51.180 --> 31:54.740
 There was work done by Mary Main at UC Berkeley

31:54.740 --> 31:55.820
 and many others,

31:55.820 --> 31:58.860
 looking at all sorts of variations on this theme.

31:58.860 --> 32:01.220
 But over time, it made it clear

32:01.220 --> 32:05.900
 that certain babies are able to feel secure

32:05.900 --> 32:08.820
 upon re-engaging with their caregiver

32:08.820 --> 32:11.980
 and others don't, or they're confused about it.

32:11.980 --> 32:15.580
 So we probably don't know whether or not

32:15.580 --> 32:17.900
 you were an A, a B, or a C, D baby,

32:17.900 --> 32:19.220
 unless you were in these experiments

32:19.220 --> 32:21.020
 and somehow you had that knowledge.

32:21.020 --> 32:23.940
 But this work, this classic work,

32:23.940 --> 32:27.580
 opened up a huge set of important questions

32:27.580 --> 32:30.180
 that relate to what is the re-establishment

32:30.180 --> 32:31.540
 of the bond really about?

32:31.540 --> 32:34.180
 I mean, what's actually being figured out here

32:34.180 --> 32:36.460
 is not whether or not there are four categories of babies,

32:36.460 --> 32:37.540
 that's interesting,

32:37.540 --> 32:41.980
 but it presumably is more interesting to focus on

32:41.980 --> 32:45.100
 what is it that defines a really good bond,

32:45.100 --> 32:47.700
 a secure attachment or an insecure attachment

32:47.700 --> 32:49.780
 or an avoidant attachment.

32:49.780 --> 32:53.620
 And the four things are gaze,

32:54.740 --> 32:56.420
 literally eye contact,

32:56.420 --> 32:58.900
 and doesn't have to be direct beaming eye contact

32:58.900 --> 33:00.900
 with no blinks like people accused me of before.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.140
 It can just be gaze that people look at each other,

33:03.140 --> 33:04.500
 you see couples, they look at each other,

33:04.500 --> 33:06.460
 they don't always stare at each other long periods of time,

33:06.460 --> 33:07.440
 sometimes they do.

33:08.580 --> 33:13.260
 Vocalizations, so what we say and how we say it.

33:13.260 --> 33:16.880
 Affect or emotion, so the way that we express,

33:16.880 --> 33:19.860
 crying, smiling, et cetera.

33:19.860 --> 33:21.960
 And touch, those four things.

33:21.960 --> 33:24.500
 And you probably could add a fifth dimension

33:24.500 --> 33:27.280
 once language and written language develops,

33:27.280 --> 33:28.700
 which is written word.

33:28.700 --> 33:30.620
 Exchange of letters, exchange of texts,

33:30.620 --> 33:32.860
 exchange of things of that sort, emails,

33:32.860 --> 33:35.360
 are another way in which people can bond.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.920
 But gaze, vocalization, affect and touch

33:38.920 --> 33:41.540
 are really the core of this thing

33:41.540 --> 33:44.340
 that we call social bonds and emotionality.

33:45.180 --> 33:46.140
 Now that's important.

33:46.140 --> 33:48.500
 We know for instance, that there are brain areas

33:48.500 --> 33:51.760
 like the fusiform face area, which is deep in the brain

33:51.760 --> 33:54.940
 that is responsible for the processing of faces.

33:54.940 --> 33:58.020
 Children's recognition of their parents faces and voices

33:58.020 --> 34:01.120
 is extremely accurate and strong.

34:01.120 --> 34:05.700
 Likewise, parents recognition of their child's vocalizations

34:05.700 --> 34:08.740
 not just voices, but cries are remarkable.

34:08.740 --> 34:11.180
 If you've ever had the experience of being at a party

34:11.180 --> 34:12.420
 with somebody who has small children

34:12.420 --> 34:14.060
 and you're talking to them and all of a sudden

34:14.060 --> 34:15.700
 they hear something but you don't,

34:15.700 --> 34:18.020
 it's as if they've got wolf hearing

34:18.020 --> 34:19.660
 and all of a sudden they go running into the other room

34:19.660 --> 34:22.340
 and indeed, the kid is like, I don't know,

34:22.340 --> 34:23.820
 some kid is beating up their kid

34:23.820 --> 34:25.540
 or their kid's beating up some other kid

34:25.540 --> 34:27.700
 or the kid has done injured themselves

34:27.700 --> 34:29.220
 or feels emotionally injured.

34:29.220 --> 34:30.940
 This perception of voices,

34:30.940 --> 34:33.300
 there's very good evidence to support the fact

34:33.300 --> 34:36.740
 that we are tuned to the frequencies of voices

34:36.740 --> 34:38.740
 and vocalizations of people that we care about.

34:38.740 --> 34:40.760
 It's not just true in rodents and in birds

34:40.760 --> 34:43.460
 and other mammals, it's definitely true in humans as well.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.140
 And babies are very tuned in

34:45.140 --> 34:46.940
 to the sound of their mother's voice.

34:46.940 --> 34:49.500
 Even yes, while they're in the womb,

34:49.500 --> 34:52.940
 there's this whole world of what's called mother ease,

34:52.940 --> 34:56.220
 which is the particular style of speech

34:56.220 --> 34:59.100
 that mothers and other caretakers now we know

34:59.100 --> 35:00.220
 use with children.

35:00.220 --> 35:01.860
 So those are the core elements, right?

35:01.860 --> 35:04.340
 How you look at somebody and how they look at you,

35:04.340 --> 35:06.700
 what you say, what they say,

35:06.700 --> 35:08.640
 what they seem to be feeling

35:08.640 --> 35:11.180
 and how that makes you feel, smiles, frowns.

35:11.180 --> 35:12.580
 If you know someone really well,

35:12.580 --> 35:15.660
 you can read inflections in like even little subtle things

35:15.660 --> 35:18.420
 like, they don't really believe me

35:18.420 --> 35:21.640
 or oh, they're really excited by this

35:21.640 --> 35:25.280
 or oh, you know, now I know what they're thinking.

35:25.280 --> 35:27.400
 That kind of processing,

35:27.400 --> 35:29.540
 some people are better at it than others,

35:29.540 --> 35:31.340
 but everyone's better at doing that with people

35:31.340 --> 35:32.820
 that we recognize and know.

35:32.820 --> 35:36.220
 In fact, couples come to know each other exceedingly well,

35:36.220 --> 35:38.660
 so much so that it can both benefit

35:38.660 --> 35:40.380
 and injure their relationship

35:40.380 --> 35:42.700
 to constantly be making these perceptions.

35:42.700 --> 35:43.540
 But there's a range,

35:43.540 --> 35:45.980
 some people are more tuned into this than others.

35:45.980 --> 35:49.500
 And that probably has roots in the sorts of attachments

35:49.500 --> 35:50.780
 that you form early on.

35:50.780 --> 35:55.580
 So Boulby and colleagues developed these ABCD thing

35:55.580 --> 35:57.720
 and it has a lot to do with face processing

35:57.720 --> 36:00.540
 and gaze and vocalizations and touch.

36:00.540 --> 36:02.780
 All of those happened on return with the mother,

36:02.780 --> 36:03.940
 but they weren't parsing those,

36:03.940 --> 36:05.920
 they weren't looking at them individually.

36:05.920 --> 36:09.360
 So this raises a really interesting question,

36:09.360 --> 36:13.700
 which is what is it when we feel something?

36:13.700 --> 36:17.340
 Is it because of something that happens spontaneously in us,

36:17.340 --> 36:19.620
 it's a memory, or it's something that we realize,

36:19.620 --> 36:22.620
 we saw on the internet, or we got news about somebody.

36:22.620 --> 36:24.260
 Nowadays, people get so much information

36:24.260 --> 36:25.460
 about the people they know,

36:25.460 --> 36:26.940
 both the people they like and dislike

36:26.940 --> 36:30.420
 by way of viewing online activities, right?

36:30.420 --> 36:31.740
 So they're exterocepting

36:31.740 --> 36:33.980
 and then it's impacting your internal state.

36:33.980 --> 36:36.760
 And it's clear from most all of the theories

36:36.760 --> 36:41.460
 of emotional health that an ability to recognize

36:41.460 --> 36:44.180
 when your own internal state is being driven

36:44.180 --> 36:47.200
 primarily by external events,

36:47.200 --> 36:51.220
 as important for being able to emotionally regulate, right?

36:51.220 --> 36:53.340
 People who are constantly being yanked around

36:53.340 --> 36:55.500
 by the external happenings in the world,

36:55.500 --> 36:57.700
 you would say are emotionally labile.

36:57.700 --> 37:00.900
 They are not in control of their emotions.

37:00.900 --> 37:02.860
 Even if they're calm all the time,

37:02.860 --> 37:04.420
 if that calmness only arrives

37:04.420 --> 37:06.100
 because they're in a placid environment

37:06.100 --> 37:08.400
 and then you put a cracker in that environment

37:08.400 --> 37:12.180
 and they freak out, well, then they're not really calm.

37:12.180 --> 37:13.900
 They're calm in so far

37:13.900 --> 37:16.260
 as there isn't something disturbing in the environment.

37:16.260 --> 37:18.200
 So how much the outside environment

37:18.200 --> 37:20.200
 disrupts your internal environment

37:20.200 --> 37:21.500
 has everything to do with this balance

37:21.500 --> 37:23.280
 of interoception and exteroception.

37:23.280 --> 37:25.740
 And it very likely has roots in whether or not

37:25.740 --> 37:28.800
 you were secure attached or insecure attached,

37:28.800 --> 37:32.180
 disorganized or ambivalent as a baby.

37:32.180 --> 37:34.300
 Of course, you can't travel back in time and know,

37:34.300 --> 37:35.420
 but there are some hints

37:35.420 --> 37:38.720
 as to what kind of emotionality each of us has

37:38.720 --> 37:41.580
 by examining two periods of development.

37:41.580 --> 37:45.620
 One is adolescence and puberty, and the other is adulthood.

37:45.620 --> 37:47.940
 So while we can't travel back in time,

37:47.940 --> 37:50.460
 there is an exercise that you can do

37:50.460 --> 37:53.160
 to address at least in this moment,

37:53.160 --> 37:56.060
 whether or not you have a bias for exteroception

37:56.060 --> 37:58.240
 or a bias for interoception.

37:58.240 --> 38:01.580
 Whether or not you are better, at least in this moment,

38:01.580 --> 38:03.080
 at paying attention to what's going on

38:03.080 --> 38:05.060
 internally or externally.

38:05.060 --> 38:07.780
 And of course, this will vary with circumstance.

38:07.780 --> 38:10.300
 I think we all know people that maybe it's you,

38:10.300 --> 38:13.300
 you go to a party and you get there

38:13.300 --> 38:14.680
 and everyone seems to be talking

38:14.680 --> 38:16.120
 and having a really good time.

38:16.120 --> 38:17.700
 And you're wondering whether or not

38:17.700 --> 38:19.340
 you have any food in your teeth

38:19.340 --> 38:20.820
 or whether or not there's something on your face

38:20.820 --> 38:22.700
 or whether or not your hair is right,

38:22.700 --> 38:25.580
 or whether or not you said something the wrong way,

38:25.580 --> 38:27.380
 whether or not you're turning red.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.860
 People also experienced this a lot with public speaking.

38:29.860 --> 38:33.940
 It's not just about learning to clamp your level of stress.

38:33.940 --> 38:35.980
 It's also about how much you're exterocepting,

38:35.980 --> 38:38.200
 how much you're out of your head, they call it,

38:38.200 --> 38:41.140
 but how much you're focused on the events around you

38:41.140 --> 38:43.880
 versus the events inside you.

38:43.880 --> 38:46.200
 Actually, it's interesting when you talk to people

38:46.200 --> 38:49.680
 who are very effective athletes

38:49.680 --> 38:52.320
 or they have very high stress, high consequence jobs,

38:52.320 --> 38:55.160
 they talk about this notion of getting out of your head.

38:55.160 --> 38:57.540
 You only have so much attentional resource

38:57.540 --> 38:59.900
 and it can be split between two things.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.180
 You'll see that in a moment.

39:01.180 --> 39:02.900
 They can be anchored to one thing.

39:02.900 --> 39:06.100
 It can be fully focused on what's going on internally,

39:06.100 --> 39:08.220
 or it can be fully focused on what's going on externally.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.500
 And if you want to be effective in the world,

39:10.500 --> 39:12.340
 effective being in quotes,

39:12.340 --> 39:16.640
 it is useful when in very dynamic environments,

39:16.640 --> 39:18.180
 especially social environments,

39:18.180 --> 39:21.040
 to have a lot of your attention focused outward

39:21.040 --> 39:23.500
 as opposed to trying to pay attention

39:23.500 --> 39:25.020
 to whether or not you're saying things correctly

39:25.020 --> 39:26.340
 or the timbre of your own voice.

39:26.340 --> 39:28.740
 That is more or less destructive

39:28.740 --> 39:31.980
 for the ability to engage socially.

39:31.980 --> 39:34.180
 So here's the exercise.

39:35.160 --> 39:38.260
 You can do this, please don't do this if you're driving,

39:38.260 --> 39:41.260
 but let's just try and illustrate

39:41.260 --> 39:43.320
 or allow you to experience

39:43.320 --> 39:45.740
 this interoceptive, exteroceptive balance

39:45.740 --> 39:49.180
 and the extent to which you can move interoception

39:49.180 --> 39:51.000
 and exteroception deliberately.

39:52.420 --> 39:55.380
 If you close your eyes right now

39:55.380 --> 39:59.740
 and concentrate on the contact of any portion of your body

39:59.740 --> 40:01.800
 with say the chair or your car seat,

40:01.800 --> 40:04.620
 although please again, don't do this while you're driving,

40:04.620 --> 40:05.460
 anywhere that you are,

40:05.460 --> 40:07.680
 even if you're just standing up or you're in the kitchen,

40:07.680 --> 40:08.820
 you're lying on the couch

40:08.820 --> 40:12.120
 and trying to bring as much of your attention

40:12.120 --> 40:15.860
 to that point of contact as possible.

40:15.860 --> 40:17.020
 And then from there,

40:17.020 --> 40:19.060
 you're going to move your attention even more deeply

40:19.060 --> 40:22.360
 into say the sensation of what's going on in your gut.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.200
 Are you full?

40:23.200 --> 40:24.020
 Are you empty?

40:24.020 --> 40:24.860
 Are you hungry?

40:24.860 --> 40:25.980
 Are you not?

40:25.980 --> 40:27.000
 Is your heart beating?

40:27.000 --> 40:27.840
 At what rate?

40:27.840 --> 40:29.220
 What's the cadence of your breathing?

40:29.220 --> 40:31.920
 Basically bringing your focus and attention

40:31.920 --> 40:34.800
 to everything at the surface of your skin and inward.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.620
 So I'm going to do a rare thing

40:36.620 --> 40:37.700
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

40:37.700 --> 40:39.460
 I'm going to introduce about five to eight seconds

40:39.460 --> 40:42.540
 of silence in order to allow you to do that a little bit.

40:54.320 --> 40:57.540
 Okay, now this is an exercise

40:57.540 --> 40:58.820
 that you can continue afterward

40:58.820 --> 41:01.020
 if you want to extend how long you do this.

41:01.020 --> 41:03.900
 But now try and do something that for most people

41:03.900 --> 41:05.220
 actually is a little bit harder,

41:05.220 --> 41:07.180
 which is to purely extero set.

41:07.180 --> 41:11.660
 Put your eyes or your ears or both

41:11.660 --> 41:14.580
 on anything in your immediate space, one thing.

41:14.580 --> 41:18.940
 And I would restrict that thing to something small enough

41:18.940 --> 41:20.660
 that at least in your field of view,

41:20.660 --> 41:24.060
 it would occupy 20% of your field of view.

41:24.060 --> 41:25.480
 So it doesn't have to be a pinpoint

41:25.480 --> 41:27.100
 unless the pin is right in front of you

41:27.100 --> 41:28.580
 and you're holding it real close.

41:28.580 --> 41:29.980
 I would say, look across the room,

41:29.980 --> 41:34.580
 pick a panel on the wall or a leg of a table or something

41:34.580 --> 41:37.020
 and try and bring as much of your attention

41:37.020 --> 41:39.320
 to that as possible.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.220
 And again, I'll take about five seconds of silence

41:42.220 --> 41:44.400
 to allow you to extero sept.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.800
 Okay, so what you probably found

41:53.800 --> 41:54.880
 is that you were able to do that,

41:54.880 --> 41:58.620
 but that some degree of interoception is maintained.

41:58.620 --> 42:00.900
 It's hard to place 100% of your attention

42:00.900 --> 42:02.340
 on something externally,

42:02.340 --> 42:05.440
 unless it's really exciting, really novel.

42:05.440 --> 42:07.820
 If you've ever watched a really great movie,

42:07.820 --> 42:10.420
 presumably you're extero septing

42:10.420 --> 42:11.620
 more than you're intero septing

42:11.620 --> 42:13.060
 until something exciting happens

42:13.060 --> 42:14.200
 and then you feel something.

42:14.200 --> 42:16.800
 You're actually tethering your emotional experience

42:16.800 --> 42:18.220
 to something external.

42:18.220 --> 42:22.140
 And now you can also do this dynamically.

42:22.140 --> 42:24.860
 You can decide to focus internally and then externally.

42:24.860 --> 42:29.040
 You can decide to split it 50%, 50% or 70, 30.

42:29.900 --> 42:32.760
 One can develop, you can develop

42:32.760 --> 42:36.180
 a heightened ability to do this.

42:36.180 --> 42:38.220
 And the power of doing that

42:38.220 --> 42:40.360
 is actually that when you are in environments

42:40.360 --> 42:43.060
 where you feel like you're focused too much internally

42:43.060 --> 42:45.660
 and you'd like to be focused more externally,

42:45.660 --> 42:47.180
 you can actually do that deliberately.

42:47.180 --> 42:49.180
 But as you notice, it takes work.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.780
 It involves taking your attentional spotlight

42:51.780 --> 42:54.340
 and what we call the aperture of your attention

42:54.340 --> 42:57.820
 and narrowing that aperture to either the self

42:57.820 --> 43:01.060
 or something externally or splitting the two.

43:01.060 --> 43:04.900
 And yet there are practices that have been developed

43:04.900 --> 43:09.660
 that center on moving interoception and exteroception

43:09.660 --> 43:13.420
 from one being more heavily weighted than the other,

43:13.420 --> 43:15.980
 more focused outward or more focused inward.

43:15.980 --> 43:17.240
 And it's dynamic.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.420
 And the circuits in the brain

43:18.420 --> 43:21.060
 that underlie intero and exteroception

43:21.060 --> 43:22.120
 aren't exactly known,

43:22.120 --> 43:24.400
 but they are anchored in the areas of the brain

43:24.400 --> 43:25.420
 they're involved in attention,

43:25.420 --> 43:26.640
 like the frontal eye fields

43:26.640 --> 43:29.800
 and areas that when you third person yourself,

43:29.800 --> 43:31.640
 when you can see yourself doing something,

43:31.640 --> 43:33.480
 like if you put your hand out in your environment

43:33.480 --> 43:35.020
 and you focus on your hand,

43:35.020 --> 43:36.340
 you know that that's your hand

43:36.340 --> 43:37.700
 as opposed to some random object.

43:37.700 --> 43:40.420
 There are areas of the brain they're involved in that

43:40.420 --> 43:42.980
 in recognizing the location of self

43:42.980 --> 43:44.740
 relative to the rest of your body.

43:46.440 --> 43:50.520
 These exercises are really what are at the core

43:50.520 --> 43:52.780
 of these development of emotional bonds,

43:52.780 --> 43:54.500
 because as we mentioned before,

43:54.500 --> 43:57.940
 these four things, the gaze, vocalization,

43:57.940 --> 43:59.540
 touch and affect,

43:59.540 --> 44:02.140
 those are happening very dynamically.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.560
 So if somebody winks at you,

44:03.560 --> 44:04.920
 you're paying attention to their wink,

44:04.920 --> 44:07.300
 but then you also notice how you feel,

44:07.300 --> 44:08.260
 then they might say something,

44:08.260 --> 44:09.100
 then you might say something.

44:09.100 --> 44:10.260
 This is very dynamic.

44:10.260 --> 44:12.980
 So if it seems overwhelming to try and interocept

44:12.980 --> 44:15.000
 and exterocept and then shift the balance,

44:15.000 --> 44:16.140
 you do that all the time.

44:16.140 --> 44:19.140
 Your brain and nervous system are fantastic at doing this.

44:19.140 --> 44:21.780
 Now, some people have a very hard time

44:21.780 --> 44:25.540
 breaking out of a very strongly interoceptive mode.

44:25.540 --> 44:27.240
 Some people have a harder time

44:27.240 --> 44:30.280
 breaking out of their exteroceptive mode.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.340
 It's very interesting to note

44:32.340 --> 44:35.080
 the extent to which we have biases

44:35.080 --> 44:37.880
 in how interoceptive or exteroceptive we are.

44:37.880 --> 44:40.580
 Remember those three axes that we talked about earlier.

44:40.580 --> 44:42.440
 You have valence, good or bad,

44:42.440 --> 44:44.860
 you have alertness, alert or calm,

44:44.860 --> 44:49.320
 and you have interoceptive or exteroceptive bias, right?

44:49.320 --> 44:51.920
 And it's going to differ across the day,

44:51.920 --> 44:53.860
 it's going to differ across the lifetime,

44:53.860 --> 44:55.120
 it's certainly going to differ

44:55.120 --> 44:57.500
 according to whatever it is that you're engaged in.

44:57.500 --> 44:59.560
 But early in development,

44:59.560 --> 45:02.380
 you start off with this interoceptive bias,

45:02.380 --> 45:05.100
 you are starting to develop expectations,

45:05.100 --> 45:08.520
 predictions about how the outside world is going to work,

45:08.520 --> 45:10.900
 and you are trying to figure out

45:10.900 --> 45:14.080
 the reliability of outside events in people

45:14.080 --> 45:16.800
 and where things are reliable.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.080
 When people are reliable,

45:19.080 --> 45:22.160
 we are able to give up more of our interoception.

45:22.160 --> 45:25.840
 There's literally trust that our interoceptive needs,

45:25.840 --> 45:27.560
 our internal needs will be met

45:27.560 --> 45:30.280
 through bonds and actions of others.

45:30.280 --> 45:32.440
 This starts to veer toward

45:32.440 --> 45:34.520
 the discussion about neglect and trauma.

45:34.520 --> 45:36.580
 We are going to devote entire episodes,

45:36.580 --> 45:39.880
 probably an entire month, to trauma and PTSD,

45:39.880 --> 45:43.800
 but those have roots in what we're talking about now,

45:43.800 --> 45:45.760
 and it's important to internalize and understand

45:45.760 --> 45:46.680
 what we're talking about now

45:46.680 --> 45:49.760
 in order to get the most out of those future conversations.

45:49.760 --> 45:53.140
 So if all of this seems like a lot of information

45:53.140 --> 45:54.800
 and very complicated,

45:54.800 --> 45:57.360
 I just invite you to pay attention from time to time

45:57.360 --> 46:00.640
 how much you happen to be interocepting or exterocepting,

46:00.640 --> 46:04.600
 because emotions and the intensity of those emotions

46:04.600 --> 46:06.120
 will grow or shrink

46:06.120 --> 46:07.880
 depending on how much we're interocepting.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.780
 If we are feeling extremely sad

46:10.780 --> 46:15.600
 and there is an outside event that made us sad,

46:15.600 --> 46:17.880
 chances are there's going to be a balance,

46:17.880 --> 46:21.000
 but that the extreme grief, the extreme sadness

46:21.000 --> 46:24.080
 is going to lead us to mostly interocept.

46:24.080 --> 46:27.200
 Whereas when we're feeling extremely happy,

46:27.200 --> 46:28.680
 the same is true.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.600
 Something great happens in the world

46:30.600 --> 46:31.680
 and we're just going to feel it.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.040
 Most of our perception,

46:33.040 --> 46:35.800
 most of our awareness is going to be on an internal state.

46:35.800 --> 46:38.480
 So we are always tethered to the outside world

46:38.480 --> 46:40.280
 to some degree or another.

46:40.280 --> 46:42.120
 That was true when you were an infant

46:42.120 --> 46:44.080
 and it was true when you were an adolescent

46:44.080 --> 46:46.660
 and it's true as an adult.

46:46.660 --> 46:48.580
 So now I want to just pause,

46:49.500 --> 46:51.920
 just shelve the discussion about interoception,

46:51.920 --> 46:53.240
 exteroception for a moment.

46:53.240 --> 46:57.040
 And I want to talk about what is arguably the second most,

46:57.040 --> 47:02.040
 if not equally important aspect of your development

47:02.080 --> 47:04.440
 as it relates to emotionality.

47:04.440 --> 47:07.000
 And as it relates to this, what I call trust,

47:07.000 --> 47:08.600
 but this ability to predict

47:08.600 --> 47:11.400
 whether or not things in the outside world are reliable

47:11.400 --> 47:14.660
 or not reliable in terms of their ability

47:14.660 --> 47:17.120
 to help you meet your interoceptive needs.

47:17.120 --> 47:20.840
 And that period is puberty.

47:20.840 --> 47:23.400
 So up until now, we've been talking mainly about psychology,

47:23.400 --> 47:25.480
 not a lot of biology, not a lot of mechanism.

47:25.480 --> 47:26.940
 And now we're going to transition

47:26.940 --> 47:28.440
 into talking about mechanism,

47:28.440 --> 47:31.240
 hormones, receptors, et cetera.

47:31.240 --> 47:35.080
 Puberty is a absolute biological event.

47:35.080 --> 47:39.340
 It has a beginning and it has a specific definition,

47:39.340 --> 47:42.680
 which is the transition into reproductive maturity.

47:42.680 --> 47:44.200
 So there are a lot of hormonal changes.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.960
 Yes, there are also a lot of brain changes

47:45.960 --> 47:47.160
 and most people don't realize it,

47:47.160 --> 47:49.400
 but the brain changes occur first.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.980
 The brain turns on the hormone systems

47:51.980 --> 47:53.840
 that allow puberty to occur.

47:55.560 --> 47:58.440
 Puberty is occurring earlier nowadays

47:58.440 --> 48:00.280
 than it did in the past.

48:01.280 --> 48:03.600
 The current numbers that I was able to find

48:03.600 --> 48:06.920
 is that in females and girls,

48:06.920 --> 48:09.580
 the transition is starting around age 10,

48:09.580 --> 48:11.920
 whereas in boys, it's about age 12.

48:11.920 --> 48:13.680
 That's going to differ by way

48:13.680 --> 48:16.320
 of a number of different factors, those are averages.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.580
 So it depends on where you are in the world,

48:18.580 --> 48:20.040
 depends on all sorts of things.

48:20.040 --> 48:23.380
 One of the primary triggers for puberty

48:23.380 --> 48:24.820
 is actually body fat.

48:25.720 --> 48:27.280
 This is interesting.

48:27.280 --> 48:30.200
 The peptide hormone leptin,

48:31.120 --> 48:32.200
 some people call it a peptide,

48:32.200 --> 48:33.220
 some people call it a hormone,

48:33.220 --> 48:34.880
 but it meets both definitions

48:34.880 --> 48:38.480
 depending on how you look at it, is made by fat.

48:38.480 --> 48:42.760
 So leptin had a lot of popularity in the 90s

48:42.760 --> 48:46.700
 because it was discovered as being produced by fat

48:46.700 --> 48:48.440
 and it was seen in animal studies

48:48.440 --> 48:50.320
 that it could promote leanness.

48:50.320 --> 48:52.320
 It actually communicates to the brain

48:52.320 --> 48:53.840
 that there's enough body fat

48:53.840 --> 48:57.280
 in order to allow the metabolic factors

48:57.280 --> 48:59.720
 and processes to occur to liberate more fat.

48:59.720 --> 49:02.720
 This is why people have trouble losing that last five pounds

49:02.720 --> 49:04.760
 is because leptin levels are very low.

49:04.760 --> 49:05.800
 This was actually the basis

49:05.800 --> 49:08.000
 for the whole cheat day refeed thing,

49:08.000 --> 49:12.000
 that the idea was if you eat a lot for one day a week

49:12.000 --> 49:15.200
 while dieting hard, that you can signal to the brain

49:15.200 --> 49:16.600
 that there's enough leptin.

49:16.600 --> 49:18.100
 I don't know if that's the reason

49:18.100 --> 49:19.280
 or whether or not the cheat days

49:19.280 --> 49:22.840
 just provided some psychological relief, probably both.

49:22.840 --> 49:25.840
 But in any case, leptin is made by body fat

49:25.840 --> 49:27.260
 and when there's enough leptin,

49:27.260 --> 49:30.580
 it signals the brain to trigger puberty.

49:30.580 --> 49:33.360
 There was a paper published in the mid 90s

49:33.360 --> 49:35.560
 in the journal Science, excellent journal,

49:35.560 --> 49:40.560
 showing that leptin could be injected into younger females

49:40.700 --> 49:44.400
 that would not have yet gone into puberty

49:44.400 --> 49:47.880
 and you could accelerate the onset of puberty with leptin.

49:47.880 --> 49:50.820
 So the more body fat, the earlier puberty, that's true.

49:50.820 --> 49:54.020
 Leptin is also involved in various growth effects

49:54.020 --> 49:55.280
 in the body generally.

49:55.280 --> 49:58.400
 And it's interesting, very obese children

49:58.400 --> 50:00.780
 don't necessarily undergo puberty earlier,

50:00.780 --> 50:04.160
 sometimes they do, but they do tend to be larger boned.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.740
 Their bones actually grow more quickly

50:05.740 --> 50:07.500
 and they tend to have higher bone density

50:07.500 --> 50:09.900
 because leptin is also involved in bone density.

50:12.460 --> 50:14.420
 The whole issue of onset of puberty

50:14.420 --> 50:17.540
 also has some really interesting social effects.

50:17.540 --> 50:21.340
 And I want to really highlight that most of these effects

50:21.340 --> 50:22.740
 are so-called pheromone effects.

50:22.740 --> 50:24.440
 Remember, a hormone is a substance

50:24.440 --> 50:25.760
 secreted from one area of the body,

50:25.760 --> 50:29.280
 travels and impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body.

50:29.280 --> 50:32.080
 A pheromone is a chemical that's released

50:32.080 --> 50:35.580
 by one member of a species that goes and acts on

50:35.580 --> 50:37.800
 and impacts other members of that species

50:37.800 --> 50:39.780
 or even other species.

50:39.780 --> 50:43.540
 So for instance, rodents are very good at detecting

50:43.540 --> 50:48.400
 the urine and the scent markings of large carnivores

50:48.400 --> 50:49.420
 that want to eat them.

50:49.420 --> 50:51.600
 So that's a pheromonal interaction.

50:52.700 --> 50:54.940
 Whether or not there are pheromonal effects in humans

50:54.940 --> 50:56.140
 is very debated.

50:56.140 --> 50:58.440
 I did a post on this on Instagram a little while ago

50:58.440 --> 51:00.620
 about some pheromone effects that were reported in humans.

51:00.620 --> 51:04.140
 And I had a couple of people come at me saying,

51:04.140 --> 51:06.600
 look, it's never really been shown in humans

51:06.600 --> 51:08.300
 that there's a pheromonal,

51:08.300 --> 51:09.740
 what's called the vomeronasal organ.

51:09.740 --> 51:11.580
 There's something called Jacobson's organ.

51:11.580 --> 51:13.120
 It's rudimentary.

51:13.120 --> 51:15.500
 Some people have it, some people don't.

51:15.500 --> 51:16.580
 Very controversial.

51:16.580 --> 51:18.900
 So I want to point out that human pheromone effects

51:18.900 --> 51:19.820
 are controversial.

51:19.820 --> 51:22.380
 Although I think there's, in my opinion,

51:22.380 --> 51:24.060
 there's ample evidence for them.

51:24.060 --> 51:26.060
 Synchronization of menstrual cycles.

51:26.060 --> 51:29.200
 For many people report, then people say,

51:29.200 --> 51:31.700
 there's some studies that show that it's not true.

51:31.700 --> 51:35.540
 Then there've been some data showing very impressive

51:35.540 --> 51:40.320
 pheromonal effects of female partners

51:40.320 --> 51:43.700
 being able to detect the odor of their significant others

51:43.700 --> 51:45.780
 on t-shirts that were washed several times.

51:45.780 --> 51:47.220
 So they can't consciously perceive it,

51:47.220 --> 51:49.440
 but they say, this one smells like them.

51:49.440 --> 51:50.980
 This one smells like my partner.

51:50.980 --> 51:55.660
 And indeed, the match was way above chance.

51:55.660 --> 51:58.580
 So there does seem to be weak pheromonal effects,

51:58.580 --> 52:00.500
 at least in my opinion, when I look at the data,

52:00.500 --> 52:02.260
 but much more needs to be done.

52:02.260 --> 52:05.240
 So one of the more interesting pheromone effects

52:05.240 --> 52:09.020
 that impacts puberty, at least in animal models,

52:09.020 --> 52:10.620
 is the so-called Vandenberg effect,

52:10.620 --> 52:14.380
 which is if you take a pre-pubertal female,

52:14.380 --> 52:18.580
 so a female that has not undergone sexual maturation,

52:18.580 --> 52:22.700
 and you introduce a novel male that is not the father

52:22.700 --> 52:24.540
 or a brother, not a sibling,

52:25.460 --> 52:29.420
 she will undergo puberty almost immediately.

52:29.420 --> 52:30.580
 So this is really striking.

52:30.580 --> 52:33.500
 For years, this was thought not to occur in primate species,

52:33.500 --> 52:35.860
 but there was a paper published last year

52:35.860 --> 52:38.780
 in Current Biology Cell Press Journal, excellent journal,

52:38.780 --> 52:42.980
 showing that mandrills, a particular type of primate,

52:42.980 --> 52:45.420
 they exhibit this Vandenberg effect.

52:45.420 --> 52:49.900
 There are also all sorts of other pheromone effects.

52:49.900 --> 52:53.820
 There's the most infamous one is called the Bruce effect,

52:53.820 --> 52:57.500
 where the introduction of a novel male

52:57.500 --> 53:02.500
 to a pregnant female animal causes spontaneous miscarriage.

53:04.420 --> 53:07.020
 And that effect seems to be protected against

53:07.020 --> 53:08.640
 by the presence of the father.

53:08.640 --> 53:12.280
 So another, you know, these interpretation of this,

53:12.280 --> 53:16.480
 and I want to really highlight that these are animal studies,

53:16.480 --> 53:21.480
 but the way this works is that if a pregnant female

53:22.380 --> 53:25.720
 is in the company of the male that impregnated her,

53:26.940 --> 53:30.560
 then her young are protected by his scent presence

53:30.560 --> 53:31.740
 or his pheromone presence.

53:31.740 --> 53:36.100
 But if he's gone and a novel male shows up,

53:36.100 --> 53:40.020
 there's a tendency for her to spontaneously miscarry

53:40.020 --> 53:43.820
 and essentially for the fetus to be lost.

53:43.820 --> 53:45.460
 Now, whether or not this occurs in humans

53:45.460 --> 53:47.880
 is still very controversial,

53:47.880 --> 53:50.900
 but nonetheless, these pheromone effects exist.

53:50.900 --> 53:54.140
 And that one is called the Bruce effect,

53:54.140 --> 53:56.380
 named after Hilda Bruce,

53:56.380 --> 53:59.140
 who is the scientist that discovered it.

53:59.140 --> 54:01.580
 The one that's relevant to the puberty discussion

54:01.580 --> 54:02.960
 is the Vandenberg effect,

54:02.960 --> 54:04.820
 which I mentioned a few minutes ago,

54:04.820 --> 54:07.620
 which is a novel male showing up,

54:07.620 --> 54:10.000
 has to be a sexually competent male,

54:10.000 --> 54:12.980
 so he has to have already passed through puberty,

54:12.980 --> 54:17.400
 and his presence triggers activation of puberty

54:17.400 --> 54:20.080
 in a female that otherwise would have remained

54:20.080 --> 54:21.680
 pre-pubertal for longer.

54:21.680 --> 54:25.000
 Again, whether or not this happens in humans, unclear.

54:25.000 --> 54:30.000
 Well, what can we be sure about when we think about puberty?

54:30.560 --> 54:33.020
 Puberty is triggered by a number of different factors.

54:33.020 --> 54:35.200
 There are changes in GABA expression in the brain

54:35.200 --> 54:36.680
 and inhibitory transmitter.

54:36.680 --> 54:40.040
 One of the more interesting molecules that triggers puberty

54:40.040 --> 54:43.600
 in all individuals is something called kispeptin,

54:43.600 --> 54:48.600
 K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kispeptin.

54:49.960 --> 54:52.040
 Kispeptin is made by the brain,

54:52.040 --> 54:56.200
 and it stimulates large amounts of a different hormone

54:56.200 --> 55:01.080
 called GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, to be released.

55:01.080 --> 55:02.800
 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone

55:02.800 --> 55:04.480
 then causes the release of another hormone,

55:04.480 --> 55:08.380
 comes something like called luteinizing hormone or LH,

55:08.380 --> 55:10.520
 which travels in the bloodstream

55:10.520 --> 55:13.940
 and stimulates the ovaries of females to produce estrogen

55:13.940 --> 55:16.960
 and the testes of males to produce testosterone.

55:18.240 --> 55:20.500
 Kispeptin has other effects as well,

55:21.800 --> 55:23.760
 but those are some of the main ones

55:23.760 --> 55:25.760
 as they relate to puberty.

55:25.760 --> 55:28.640
 This is interesting because at this point,

55:28.640 --> 55:32.280
 the testes in males start churning out tons of testosterone

55:32.280 --> 55:35.160
 in order to trigger the development of secondary

55:35.160 --> 55:37.960
 sexual characteristics, body hair and all the others,

55:37.960 --> 55:39.280
 deepening of voice, et cetera.

55:39.280 --> 55:43.220
 And in females, estrogen is doing various other things,

55:43.220 --> 55:44.720
 breast development, et cetera.

55:46.840 --> 55:51.000
 Normally in an adult, somebody who has passed puberty,

55:51.000 --> 55:53.920
 a big increase in gonadotropin-releasing hormone

55:53.920 --> 55:56.880
 and luteinizing hormone would eventually be shut down

55:56.880 --> 55:59.140
 because the way that the brain works,

55:59.140 --> 56:01.000
 the hypothalamus and the pituitary

56:01.000 --> 56:03.680
 are actually measuring how much hormone is in the blood.

56:03.680 --> 56:05.520
 And if testosterone or estrogen

56:05.520 --> 56:07.520
 or any other hormone goes too high,

56:07.520 --> 56:10.880
 they shut down the release of things like luteinizing hormone

56:10.880 --> 56:13.040
 it's a way called a negative feedback loop.

56:13.040 --> 56:15.040
 It basically is like a thermostat in the house.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.180
 It's more complicated than that,

56:16.180 --> 56:19.360
 but once levels get too high in the bloodstream,

56:19.360 --> 56:22.120
 it shuts down, but Kispeptin is able to drive

56:22.120 --> 56:25.580
 very high levels of these hormones in an ongoing way

56:25.580 --> 56:28.320
 so that puberty can commence and can continue.

56:28.320 --> 56:31.960
 And incidentally, Kispeptin has now become

56:31.960 --> 56:36.960
 yet another of the panoply of hormones and peptides

56:36.960 --> 56:39.240
 and cocktails that athletes take

56:39.240 --> 56:42.480
 in order to try and stimulate natural hormone production,

56:42.480 --> 56:44.000
 essentially to create their own

56:44.000 --> 56:47.220
 performance-enhancing drugs endogenously.

56:47.220 --> 56:48.900
 No judgment there, but that's a fact.

56:48.900 --> 56:50.680
 There's a lot of Kispeptin use.

56:50.680 --> 56:53.520
 I'm truly not suggesting anyone do this,

56:53.520 --> 56:56.760
 but people are buying and injecting Kispeptin

56:56.760 --> 57:00.160
 for the specific reason that even past puberty

57:00.160 --> 57:04.720
 can stimulate the large increases in things like estrogen,

57:04.720 --> 57:07.820
 large increases in testosterone and things of that sort.

57:07.820 --> 57:10.220
 Has a number of psychological effects too,

57:10.220 --> 57:13.240
 seems to have big effects on libido, et cetera.

57:13.240 --> 57:16.400
 All these things of course are subject to feedback loops

57:16.400 --> 57:17.960
 so they don't work indefinitely.

57:17.960 --> 57:19.000
 And I'm going to highlight again,

57:19.000 --> 57:20.260
 I'm not suggesting anyone do it,

57:20.260 --> 57:23.000
 but I do like to pay attention to what's out there

57:23.000 --> 57:26.120
 and Kispeptin because it wasn't discovered that long ago

57:26.120 --> 57:28.880
 is one of the things that you don't often hear about

57:28.880 --> 57:31.760
 when people talk about performance-enhancing drugs

57:31.760 --> 57:33.960
 or therapeutic endocrinology.

57:33.960 --> 57:36.300
 These things also have therapeutic uses

57:36.300 --> 57:39.280
 in the endocrine setting.

57:39.280 --> 57:41.360
 So for instance, kids that don't undergo puberty

57:41.360 --> 57:43.080
 or kids that are hypogonadal

57:43.080 --> 57:44.280
 or adults that are hypogonadal,

57:44.280 --> 57:45.640
 they're not making enough hormone,

57:45.640 --> 57:49.740
 will take things like Kispeptin among other things.

57:49.740 --> 57:53.000
 So that's how puberty happens at the biological level,

57:53.000 --> 57:54.960
 gets triggered by leptin and Kispeptin.

57:54.960 --> 57:59.960
 And then this young child is now a different creature

58:00.840 --> 58:02.240
 to some extent,

58:02.240 --> 58:05.580
 not just because they're reproductively competent of course,

58:05.580 --> 58:08.920
 but because there's a shift in a number of the things

58:08.920 --> 58:11.620
 that underlie these social bonds.

58:12.760 --> 58:15.440
 There's a market shift in a number of the things

58:15.440 --> 58:19.000
 that allow children and adults

58:19.000 --> 58:22.280
 to engage in predictive behavior about each other.

58:22.280 --> 58:26.120
 And the whole nature of adolescence and puberty

58:26.120 --> 58:30.360
 is to take a child that was a generalist

58:30.360 --> 58:31.900
 and to make them a specialist.

58:31.900 --> 58:33.360
 And this is very important

58:33.360 --> 58:36.540
 as it relates to the conversation about emotionality,

58:36.540 --> 58:40.760
 but it's important in terms of all aspects of brain function

58:40.760 --> 58:41.840
 and in terms of learning

58:41.840 --> 58:44.420
 and in terms of who each and every one of us

58:44.420 --> 58:45.920
 will and has become.

58:47.520 --> 58:49.760
 In adolescence and in childhood,

58:49.760 --> 58:52.160
 sure, there are some genetic biases,

58:52.160 --> 58:54.760
 hair color, eye color, height, and things like that.

58:54.760 --> 58:56.960
 A lot of that's programmed into the genome.

58:58.220 --> 59:01.660
 There are other genetic biases too, of course,

59:01.660 --> 59:03.160
 that we inherit,

59:03.160 --> 59:06.600
 but it's in adolescence and puberty

59:06.600 --> 59:08.480
 that we go from essentially

59:08.480 --> 59:11.160
 being somewhat good at a bunch of things

59:11.160 --> 59:13.600
 or somewhat poor at a bunch of things

59:13.600 --> 59:16.240
 to becoming very good at a few things

59:16.240 --> 59:18.600
 and very poor at a lot of other things.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.040
 And that's because of the relationship

59:20.040 --> 59:22.560
 to puberty and neuroplasticity.

59:22.560 --> 59:24.120
 This ability to change the brain

59:24.120 --> 59:26.680
 in response to experience is starting to taper off

59:26.680 --> 59:31.220
 such that by our early 20s, it's harder to achieve.

59:31.220 --> 59:34.360
 Now, the transition from generalist to specialist

59:34.360 --> 59:36.780
 is one aspect of adolescence and puberty,

59:36.780 --> 59:39.160
 but the other is the formation

59:39.160 --> 59:40.760
 of social and emotional bonds.

59:40.760 --> 59:43.960
 And most of what consumes the minds

59:43.960 --> 59:47.100
 and waking hours of adolescents

59:47.100 --> 59:48.720
 and children who have gone through puberty

59:48.720 --> 59:50.080
 and going through puberty

59:50.080 --> 59:54.720
 is questions about how they relate to social structures,

59:54.720 --> 59:56.420
 who they can rely on,

59:56.420 --> 59:59.000
 and how they can make reliable predictions in the world

59:59.000 --> 1:00:00.600
 now that they have more agency,

1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:03.240
 that they are physically changed.

1:00:03.240 --> 1:00:05.520
 In fact, you could argue that puberty

1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:07.200
 is the fastest rate of maturation

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:09.360
 that you'll go through at any point in your life.

1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:11.260
 It's the largest change that you'll go through

1:00:11.260 --> 1:00:14.640
 at any point in your life in terms of who you are

1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:16.680
 because your biology is fundamentally changed

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:20.140
 at the level of your brain and your bodily organs,

1:00:20.140 --> 1:00:23.240
 all your organs from the skin inward.

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:26.520
 So I want to visit a little bit of the research

1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:29.320
 about some of the core needs

1:00:29.320 --> 1:00:32.160
 that occur during puberty and adolescence,

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:33.740
 not just for parents or for the people

1:00:33.740 --> 1:00:36.240
 that might be in puberty and adolescence,

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:38.440
 but also so that people can reflect

1:00:38.440 --> 1:00:42.800
 on which of these sort of boxes were checked off for them

1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:46.720
 as they approached emotional maturity.

1:00:46.720 --> 1:00:49.040
 So there's a terrific review article

1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:51.040
 that was published in the journal Nature,

1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:53.520
 which is, if not the premier,

1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:56.540
 then certainly among the top three premier journals

1:00:56.540 --> 1:00:57.920
 in the field of science

1:00:57.920 --> 1:01:02.620
 about the biology of adolescence and puberty,

1:01:02.620 --> 1:01:06.520
 as well as some of the core needs and demands

1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:09.800
 that have to be met for successful emotional maturation

1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:11.320
 during that time.

1:01:11.320 --> 1:01:13.060
 We will provide a link to that,

1:01:13.060 --> 1:01:15.980
 but I just want to highlight a few of the things

1:01:15.980 --> 1:01:18.200
 that they place in the final table.

1:01:18.200 --> 1:01:20.100
 I don't want to go through all the results right now

1:01:20.100 --> 1:01:22.440
 because you could do that on your own if you like.

1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:26.240
 They mainly highlight a lot of the changes in neurons

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:27.480
 and neural circuits.

1:01:27.480 --> 1:01:29.500
 For instance, I'll just highlight one.

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:32.200
 There's a connection between the dopamine centers

1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:33.960
 in the brain and an area of the brain

1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:37.640
 that's involved in emotion and dispersal.

1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.240
 Dispersal is very interesting.

1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:41.760
 What you observe in animals and humans

1:01:43.080 --> 1:01:45.400
 is that around the end of adolescence

1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:47.580
 and during the transition to puberty,

1:01:47.580 --> 1:01:49.560
 both because of changes in the brain

1:01:49.560 --> 1:01:51.320
 and changes in hormones,

1:01:52.360 --> 1:01:57.000
 there's an intense desire on the part of the child

1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:02.000
 to get further and further away from primary caregivers.

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:04.040
 Not permanently, they always return,

1:02:04.040 --> 1:02:06.760
 similar to a child that walks off and then looks back

1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:09.980
 and sees if everything's safe and then continues on.

1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:12.040
 During adolescence and puberty,

1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:14.480
 both in animals and in kids,

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:16.760
 it almost seems like there's a bias for action

1:02:16.760 --> 1:02:19.520
 and the action is always in the direction away

1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:21.120
 from the primary caregiver.

1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:22.780
 Now, as soon as I say that,

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:24.120
 I can just imagine in my mind

1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:25.080
 that somebody out there saying,

1:02:25.080 --> 1:02:27.400
 well, no, my kid, as soon as they hit puberty,

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:29.640
 they just want to stay home with us all the time.

1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:30.800
 That's not typical.

1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:32.540
 It happens, but it's not typical.

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:34.600
 Mostly there's a desire to start spending

1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:36.640
 more time with friends, more time with peers,

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:39.080
 and less time with adults.

1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:41.200
 And I find it extremely interesting to note

1:02:41.200 --> 1:02:42.740
 that that's not just true in humans.

1:02:42.740 --> 1:02:44.960
 That's true in other primates species.

1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:46.320
 That's true in rodents.

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:50.180
 That's true in almost every other mammalian species.

1:02:50.180 --> 1:02:52.300
 So there's something about these hormones

1:02:52.300 --> 1:02:55.660
 that don't just allow sexual reproduction.

1:02:55.660 --> 1:02:57.680
 They don't just change the brain and bodily organs

1:02:57.680 --> 1:02:59.580
 and the shape of us.

1:02:59.580 --> 1:03:03.080
 They also bias us towards dispersal,

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:04.400
 getting further and further away

1:03:04.400 --> 1:03:06.240
 from primary caregivers in particular.

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:08.980
 So parents of teenagers or future teenagers,

1:03:08.980 --> 1:03:10.840
 it is not just normal.

1:03:10.840 --> 1:03:14.240
 It is baked in to the biology of humans

1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:18.160
 to disperse around adolescents and in the teen years.

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:20.700
 So again, I just want to highlight a few of these,

1:03:20.700 --> 1:03:24.680
 what were listed as intervention strategies

1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:27.760
 to promote healthy adolescence and puberty.

1:03:27.760 --> 1:03:31.000
 And it's very interesting because the entire article,

1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.720
 I should mention who wrote this article, apologies,

1:03:34.720 --> 1:03:37.480
 one of them is a friend of mine.

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:40.400
 So the first author is Ronald Dahl,

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:43.020
 not the children's book author, I'm assuming.

1:03:44.380 --> 1:03:45.800
 No, from the School of Public Health

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:48.460
 at a University of California, Berkeley.

1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:51.800
 And Nicholas Allen, Linda Wilbrecht,

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:54.520
 and Anna Ballenhof, Suleiman,

1:03:54.520 --> 1:03:56.160
 forgive me for the pronunciation of the last one.

1:03:56.160 --> 1:03:58.840
 I know Dr. Wilbrecht quite well.

1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:01.300
 She's done the work on dispersal,

1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:04.320
 is quite well known for that work.

1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:07.400
 And it's a very extensive review,

1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:10.320
 but I think you'll find it accessible.

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:12.840
 Lot of changes in thickness of the brain

1:04:12.840 --> 1:04:14.200
 at different stages, et cetera.

1:04:14.200 --> 1:04:15.800
 But I think most people will be interested

1:04:15.800 --> 1:04:20.640
 in what that translates to in the real world.

1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:24.120
 And what's interesting is during puberty,

1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:28.000
 there's increased connection, connectivity as we call it,

1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:29.340
 between the prefrontal cortex,

1:04:29.340 --> 1:04:32.260
 which is involved in motivation and decision-making,

1:04:32.260 --> 1:04:36.720
 being able to suppress action for making long-term goals

1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:41.160
 possible, as well as dopamine centers and the amygdala.

1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:44.580
 So there's this really broad integration and testing.

1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:46.200
 I think this is the key element here,

1:04:46.200 --> 1:04:49.400
 testing of circuits for emotions and reward

1:04:49.400 --> 1:04:51.160
 as they relate to decisions.

1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:53.880
 And I think that's useful because when you look

1:04:53.880 --> 1:04:55.680
 at the behavior of adolescents and teens,

1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:57.480
 they are testing social interactions.

1:04:57.480 --> 1:05:00.560
 They are testing physical interactions with the world.

1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:03.080
 Oftentimes they're engaging in unsafe behavior.

1:05:03.080 --> 1:05:07.960
 And you can't just, I would never try and justify that

1:05:07.960 --> 1:05:09.680
 with the underlying neurology.

1:05:09.680 --> 1:05:13.520
 But the neuroscience points to increased connectivity

1:05:13.520 --> 1:05:16.880
 between areas of the brain that are related to emotionality

1:05:16.880 --> 1:05:20.120
 and to threat detection, like the amygdala,

1:05:20.120 --> 1:05:21.440
 but also reward.

1:05:21.440 --> 1:05:23.880
 So it's a time of testing behaviorally

1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:27.500
 how different behaviors lead to success or not.

1:05:27.500 --> 1:05:31.200
 It's how different behaviors lead to fear states or not.

1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:32.640
 Now, of course, you could say that of any stage

1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:34.320
 of development, but it seems like puberty

1:05:34.320 --> 1:05:37.920
 is a very, very heightened stage in which testing

1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:41.240
 of contingencies, good or bad, is taking place.

1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:42.800
 And of course, this is happening,

1:05:42.800 --> 1:05:45.620
 it's operating in a body that's now more capable

1:05:45.620 --> 1:05:46.760
 than the infant.

1:05:46.760 --> 1:05:50.120
 So an infant can damage themselves through error,

1:05:50.120 --> 1:05:52.700
 but it's harder for them to damage themselves

1:05:52.700 --> 1:05:54.660
 through deliberate planning.

1:05:54.660 --> 1:05:55.720
 That's why it's important, of course,

1:05:55.720 --> 1:05:57.760
 to lock up all the medications in the house,

1:05:57.760 --> 1:05:59.640
 make sure infants can't get to them.

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:02.680
 But it's not likely that the infant

1:06:02.680 --> 1:06:05.680
 is going to devise an extremely diabolical plan

1:06:05.680 --> 1:06:09.080
 to get into the cabinet to get a certain substance,

1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:12.000
 whereas a teenager might, right?

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.440
 So you can start to map the neurology

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:16.960
 onto some of this emotional exploration.

1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:19.240
 I do realize that this episode is about emotions.

1:06:19.240 --> 1:06:22.600
 Puberty is a time in which the internal state

1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:26.280
 of the person or the animal is being sampled

1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:29.200
 and tested against different extra receptive events,

1:06:29.200 --> 1:06:32.440
 only now they are able to guide those events

1:06:32.440 --> 1:06:34.520
 with more agency, right?

1:06:34.520 --> 1:06:36.920
 It's no longer just about whether or not the caregiver

1:06:36.920 --> 1:06:39.280
 is bringing you milk or bringing you food.

1:06:39.280 --> 1:06:40.820
 Now, of course, the parents will all say,

1:06:40.820 --> 1:06:42.520
 yeah, but I'm paying for everything that they're doing,

1:06:42.520 --> 1:06:44.560
 I'm paying for the car and I'm paying for the food.

1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:49.020
 Ah, true, but the biology doesn't care about the source,

1:06:49.020 --> 1:06:52.360
 the child or the adolescent is now able,

1:06:52.360 --> 1:06:55.720
 the teen really is able to now sample many,

1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:59.440
 many more extra receptive events through behavior.

1:06:59.440 --> 1:07:01.800
 So some of these recommendations are interesting.

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:04.880
 The theory is that one of the motivations

1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:08.400
 is to learn to mitigate the risk of famine and malnutrition.

1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:10.920
 As teenagers get older, they start questioning

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:12.660
 whether or not their parents

1:07:12.660 --> 1:07:14.280
 are everything they thought they were,

1:07:14.280 --> 1:07:17.080
 whether or not they're the greatest thing that ever was

1:07:17.080 --> 1:07:19.120
 or the worst thing that ever was perhaps,

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:21.940
 including whether or not they will be able

1:07:21.940 --> 1:07:23.320
 to provide them resources.

1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:24.400
 So they test whether or not

1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:26.100
 they can actually feed themselves,

1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:28.960
 whether or not they can support themselves,

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:32.500
 although rarely not, certainly it happens,

1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:35.360
 but rarely are they really taking care of themselves.

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:36.600
 Although some teens are forced

1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:38.360
 to take care of themselves, of course,

1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:41.320
 because parents and other caretakers aren't available.

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:45.300
 The recommendations that map to the biology include later,

1:07:45.300 --> 1:07:48.160
 there's been a big push for later start times in schools

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:50.680
 to match their shifts in circadian rhythms

1:07:50.680 --> 1:07:51.960
 and the need for extended sleep,

1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:54.560
 something we talked about during the sleep episodes,

1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:00.080
 to insist on sleep interventions for youth

1:08:00.080 --> 1:08:02.900
 who are at increased risk for mental health problems.

1:08:02.900 --> 1:08:06.160
 Almost every mental health issue is supported

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:10.400
 by getting regular quality sleep of sufficient duration.

1:08:10.400 --> 1:08:13.080
 Sufficient duration is going to vary from person to person.

1:08:14.040 --> 1:08:16.480
 Leveraging different kinds of social relationships

1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:18.400
 that reinforce positive behavior.

1:08:18.400 --> 1:08:21.480
 This is starting to sound like kind of a boilerplate stuff.

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:24.440
 And yet really the goal is during puberty

1:08:24.440 --> 1:08:28.200
 to encourage as many safe forms of interaction

1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:32.220
 that allow children, teens really, and adolescents,

1:08:32.220 --> 1:08:33.180
 I keep calling them children,

1:08:33.180 --> 1:08:36.160
 but what I mean are children going through puberty,

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:39.360
 that allow them to test this thing of autonomy

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:43.440
 so that they can start to make good assessments

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:46.340
 about their extra receptive events

1:08:46.340 --> 1:08:47.880
 that they are selecting

1:08:47.880 --> 1:08:49.440
 and how those make them feel internally.

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:51.280
 So they're essentially doing a buffet.

1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:53.000
 The buffet has now broadened

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:56.280
 to not just include the events and experiences

1:08:56.280 --> 1:08:58.540
 that their parents and other caretakers bring them,

1:08:58.540 --> 1:09:00.520
 but they can now expand the buffet

1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:03.080
 into things that they can provide themselves.

1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:05.800
 And so adolescence and puberty

1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:08.280
 is really seen as the period of development

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:11.520
 in which one self samples for these two elements

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:12.960
 that we talked about at the beginning,

1:09:12.960 --> 1:09:16.380
 which are how do I form bonds

1:09:16.380 --> 1:09:17.840
 and how do I make predictions

1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:19.600
 about what will make me feel good

1:09:20.500 --> 1:09:22.600
 at a level of interoception.

1:09:22.600 --> 1:09:25.520
 Some of that might sound a little transactional,

1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:26.560
 that all we're trying to do

1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:29.400
 is figure out how we can bond with people

1:09:29.400 --> 1:09:32.720
 so we can get what we need so we can feel how we need.

1:09:32.720 --> 1:09:34.320
 I think that's true to some extent.

1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:35.840
 Of course, there's a richer,

1:09:35.840 --> 1:09:40.560
 more abstract aspect to relationships too,

1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:42.040
 which are in relationships

1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:43.960
 you can access things you couldn't do before,

1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:46.280
 you can cooperate, there's things like teamwork,

1:09:46.280 --> 1:09:48.140
 you can do all sorts of things.

1:09:48.140 --> 1:09:49.820
 But in terms of the biology,

1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:52.120
 it's clear that there's this stage of development

1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:56.240
 where more autonomy, more physical capability

1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:58.880
 is triggered by these hormone changes in the brain

1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:01.320
 and these peptide changes in the brain and body.

1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.280
 And that nonetheless brings us back

1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:07.780
 to the exact same model that we started with in infancy

1:10:07.780 --> 1:10:12.400
 of alert or calm, feel good or feel bad,

1:10:13.620 --> 1:10:16.980
 primarily exterocepting, primarily interocepting.

1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:18.360
 So I keep going back to this,

1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:20.500
 I'm sort of like a repeating record on that

1:10:20.500 --> 1:10:22.900
 because the same core algorithm,

1:10:22.900 --> 1:10:26.760
 the same core function is at play throughout the lifespan.

1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:29.360
 And that's a useful framework in my opinion,

1:10:29.360 --> 1:10:31.620
 because it allows you to sort through

1:10:31.620 --> 1:10:33.780
 all the data and information that's out there about,

1:10:33.780 --> 1:10:36.020
 well, this area, the stria terminalis is active

1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:37.680
 or the basolateral amygdala is active

1:10:37.680 --> 1:10:40.580
 or gray matter thickening or this hormone or that hormone

1:10:40.580 --> 1:10:43.360
 and return to a kind of kernel

1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:45.820
 of certainly not exhaustive truth,

1:10:45.820 --> 1:10:48.140
 it doesn't cover all aspects of emotionality,

1:10:48.140 --> 1:10:51.140
 but at least establishes some groundwork

1:10:51.140 --> 1:10:52.860
 from which you can start to evaluate

1:10:52.860 --> 1:10:56.780
 how different behaviors might or might not make sense,

1:10:56.780 --> 1:10:58.580
 how certain emotional responses

1:10:58.580 --> 1:11:00.340
 might or might not make sense,

1:11:00.340 --> 1:11:03.620
 regardless of the age of the person or the organism.

1:11:03.620 --> 1:11:06.740
 A discussion about emotions would not be complete

1:11:06.740 --> 1:11:11.740
 without talking about the right brain, left brain stuff.

1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:15.780
 And this is a very interesting aspect

1:11:15.780 --> 1:11:19.040
 of sociology, psychology, and neuroscience.

1:11:20.020 --> 1:11:22.220
 There's a theory of emotional development

1:11:22.220 --> 1:11:24.840
 that I find particularly interesting,

1:11:24.840 --> 1:11:26.920
 which is from Alan Shore at UCLA,

1:11:26.920 --> 1:11:29.920
 that talks about how most of our testing of bonds

1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:33.120
 and relationships is the seesawing back and forth

1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:36.320
 between very dopaminergic, so driven by dopamine

1:11:36.320 --> 1:11:39.620
 or serotonergic, driven by serotonin states.

1:11:39.620 --> 1:11:41.820
 And this starts with infant and mother

1:11:41.820 --> 1:11:43.180
 or infant and father.

1:11:43.180 --> 1:11:45.220
 I talked a little bit about this in the previous episode,

1:11:45.220 --> 1:11:46.640
 but just to remind you,

1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:48.600
 or for anyone that didn't hear about it,

1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:51.300
 that during development, healthy emotional development

1:11:51.300 --> 1:11:56.300
 clearly begins with an ability for the caretaker and child

1:11:56.680 --> 1:12:00.260
 to be in calm, peaceful, soothing, touch-oriented,

1:12:00.260 --> 1:12:02.780
 eye-gazing type of behaviors.

1:12:02.780 --> 1:12:05.080
 Those really drive serotonin,

1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:09.700
 the endogenous opioid system, oxytocin,

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:10.900
 things that are very calming

1:12:10.900 --> 1:12:14.020
 and are centered around pleasure with the here and now,

1:12:14.020 --> 1:12:17.100
 as well as excited states of what we're going to do next.

1:12:17.100 --> 1:12:19.580
 There's actually a kind of characteristic sign

1:12:19.580 --> 1:12:22.300
 of the dopaminergic interaction

1:12:22.300 --> 1:12:26.380
 where both caretaker and child are wide-eyed,

1:12:26.380 --> 1:12:28.880
 the pupils dilate, that's a signature of arousal.

1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:29.820
 They get really excited.

1:12:29.820 --> 1:12:31.380
 Oftentimes the baby will look away

1:12:31.380 --> 1:12:32.900
 if it gets really excited.

1:12:32.900 --> 1:12:35.620
 Those are signatures of dopamine release in the body.

1:12:35.620 --> 1:12:38.800
 And in adolescence, these same things carry forward

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:41.680
 where their good bonds are achieved

1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:44.420
 through hanging around, watching TV,

1:12:44.420 --> 1:12:47.500
 just kind of being there, playing video games

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:49.460
 or texting together or talking,

1:12:49.460 --> 1:12:52.380
 whatever it is that the soothing local activity

1:12:52.380 --> 1:12:54.740
 happens to be, as well as adventure

1:12:54.740 --> 1:12:56.060
 and things that are exciting.

1:12:56.060 --> 1:12:57.820
 So it could be sports, it could be shopping,

1:12:57.820 --> 1:12:59.840
 it could be a summer adventure,

1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:01.720
 it could be the next big thing.

1:13:01.720 --> 1:13:03.580
 And so this kind of seesawing back and forth

1:13:03.580 --> 1:13:05.660
 between the different reward systems

1:13:05.660 --> 1:13:08.380
 seems to be the basis

1:13:08.380 --> 1:13:10.780
 from which healthy emotional bonds are created.

1:13:10.780 --> 1:13:12.460
 And I invite anyone who's interested in this

1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:16.100
 to look up some of Dr. Schor's work.

1:13:17.100 --> 1:13:18.660
 I think I misspoke on the last episode.

1:13:18.660 --> 1:13:19.580
 He's not a psychiatrist,

1:13:19.580 --> 1:13:22.220
 he's a clinical psychologist and psychoanalyst,

1:13:22.220 --> 1:13:24.180
 but has deep rootings in neuroscience.

1:13:24.180 --> 1:13:27.100
 So it's, I think, a fascinating aspect.

1:13:27.100 --> 1:13:31.180
 But the way it's framed in that book and in his book

1:13:31.180 --> 1:13:32.340
 and in some of the language around that

1:13:32.340 --> 1:13:34.380
 is around right brain, left brain.

1:13:34.380 --> 1:13:35.900
 And we've all heard this stuff before

1:13:35.900 --> 1:13:39.260
 that the right brain is thought to be the emotional side.

1:13:39.260 --> 1:13:41.780
 This is the characteristic thing that you hear out there,

1:13:41.780 --> 1:13:45.020
 that the right brain is holistic, that it's emotive,

1:13:45.020 --> 1:13:46.660
 and that the left brain is logical,

1:13:46.660 --> 1:13:48.380
 sequential, and analytic.

1:13:48.380 --> 1:13:52.500
 And that's not what Schor was proposing.

1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:54.760
 There are some right brain, left brain differences,

1:13:54.760 --> 1:13:58.260
 but the idea that the right brain is synthetic,

1:13:58.260 --> 1:13:59.740
 holistic, and emotive,

1:13:59.740 --> 1:14:01.740
 and that the left brain is logical, sequential,

1:14:01.740 --> 1:14:04.420
 and analytic is false.

1:14:04.420 --> 1:14:08.220
 There is zero neuroscience evidence for that whatsoever.

1:14:09.260 --> 1:14:11.460
 We're going to address this in more detail

1:14:11.460 --> 1:14:12.960
 during a month talking about learning

1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:14.700
 and memory and dementia,

1:14:14.700 --> 1:14:16.860
 but let's talk about some truths,

1:14:16.860 --> 1:14:19.000
 some differences between the left brain and right brain,

1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:20.740
 because we can't have a discussion about emotion

1:14:20.740 --> 1:14:21.700
 without doing that.

1:14:23.100 --> 1:14:27.300
 The left brain, at least for people who are right-handed,

1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:29.100
 is linguistically dominant,

1:14:29.100 --> 1:14:31.780
 meaning most of language is centered

1:14:31.780 --> 1:14:35.680
 in the left side of the brain for right-handed people.

1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:38.140
 If you were a left-hander

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:41.140
 and you were forced to become right-handed,

1:14:41.140 --> 1:14:43.900
 chances are this is still true

1:14:43.900 --> 1:14:47.780
 because of when language gets laid down in the brain.

1:14:47.780 --> 1:14:51.060
 For left-handers, people that naturally write

1:14:51.060 --> 1:14:53.600
 with their left hand and always did,

1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:57.580
 language is still mostly in the left side of the brain,

1:14:57.580 --> 1:15:01.180
 but it's also found more often

1:15:01.180 --> 1:15:02.480
 in the right side of the brain,

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:04.780
 so it's not as lateralized as we say,

1:15:04.780 --> 1:15:06.620
 it's kind of distributed between both.

1:15:06.620 --> 1:15:08.220
 Okay, so right-handers,

1:15:08.220 --> 1:15:09.180
 most of your language is coming

1:15:09.180 --> 1:15:10.960
 from the left side of your brain.

1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:12.140
 Left-handers, it's probably

1:15:12.140 --> 1:15:13.900
 a little bit more evenly distributed.

1:15:13.900 --> 1:15:15.060
 And there are some variations,

1:15:15.060 --> 1:15:17.740
 whether or not you're a hook righty or a hook lefty,

1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:19.240
 there's all sorts of nuance to this,

1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:21.980
 but that's the general aspect.

1:15:21.980 --> 1:15:23.780
 So language tends to be centered

1:15:23.780 --> 1:15:24.940
 in the left side of the brain,

1:15:24.940 --> 1:15:28.740
 and that includes lexicon, grammar, syntax, all of it,

1:15:28.740 --> 1:15:29.780
 except for one,

1:15:29.780 --> 1:15:31.500
 and we'll talk about one aspect of language

1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:33.900
 that seems to be more right brain,

1:15:33.900 --> 1:15:35.920
 that's very interesting.

1:15:35.920 --> 1:15:40.100
 There does seem to be some arithmetic advantage,

1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:43.660
 so ability in math, in the left side of the brain.

1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:44.500
 And I'm going to talk about

1:15:44.500 --> 1:15:46.940
 how all this was discovered in a minute.

1:15:46.940 --> 1:15:51.020
 The right brain, however, is linguistically primitive.

1:15:51.020 --> 1:15:52.060
 Most people don't realize this

1:15:52.060 --> 1:15:53.660
 because the right brain is always described

1:15:53.660 --> 1:15:56.820
 as the emotive side, it's super emotional and holistic,

1:15:56.820 --> 1:15:59.140
 but it's actually linguistically primitive.

1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:01.620
 And there's a way that that's been teased out

1:16:01.620 --> 1:16:03.240
 through experiment.

1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:06.640
 It's very good at manipulating spatial things

1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:08.960
 and visual spatial tasks.

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:10.940
 It's primarily handling that stuff,

1:16:10.940 --> 1:16:15.000
 but it's sort of non-language, except one aspect.

1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:16.620
 And there isn't a ton of evidence for this,

1:16:16.620 --> 1:16:19.580
 but the evidence is strong, which is prosody.

1:16:19.580 --> 1:16:23.920
 Prosody is the lilting and falling of language.

1:16:24.980 --> 1:16:26.940
 So a good example would be Italian.

1:16:26.940 --> 1:16:27.860
 I don't speak Italian.

1:16:27.860 --> 1:16:29.660
 I only know a little bit of Italian,

1:16:29.660 --> 1:16:31.260
 but most of the Italian I know

1:16:31.260 --> 1:16:34.280
 is when my Italian colleagues have said to me,

1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:35.720
 ma cosarici, which means like,

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:37.860
 what are you trying to say, or what are you saying?

1:16:37.860 --> 1:16:39.100
 I think I'm getting that right.

1:16:39.100 --> 1:16:40.560
 Basically, they're saying I don't speak Italian,

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:41.540
 which is true.

1:16:41.540 --> 1:16:45.500
 Or because one of them knows and loves Costello very much,

1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:49.220
 they always say, umpigrone, which means big lazy guy,

1:16:49.220 --> 1:16:51.500
 which accurately captures Costello.

1:16:51.500 --> 1:16:54.640
 So even those few examples, right?

1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:57.420
 Ma cosarici, umpigrone.

1:16:57.420 --> 1:16:59.980
 There's a lot of lilt and fall in Italian.

1:16:59.980 --> 1:17:02.520
 Other languages, not so much, and it varies by language.

1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:04.600
 One of the reasons I find Italian so beautiful,

1:17:04.600 --> 1:17:05.660
 not the Italian I speak,

1:17:05.660 --> 1:17:07.640
 but the Italian that other people speak,

1:17:07.640 --> 1:17:10.200
 so beautiful to listen to is that prosody

1:17:10.200 --> 1:17:13.980
 and the shifts in intonation are really quite remarkable.

1:17:13.980 --> 1:17:17.320
 It's almost like a singing song, listening to them speak.

1:17:17.320 --> 1:17:19.000
 And I used to like to go to scientific meetings

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:20.700
 and I always hang out with the Italians

1:17:20.700 --> 1:17:22.680
 because I have some good friends in Italian labs,

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:24.420
 but also because they always knew where the best food was.

1:17:24.420 --> 1:17:26.620
 Their standards for food are incredible.

1:17:26.620 --> 1:17:29.300
 They would rather starve than eat terrible pasta.

1:17:29.300 --> 1:17:30.660
 And the pasta they do find

1:17:30.660 --> 1:17:33.080
 and that they're willing to eat is always fantastic.

1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:35.420
 But in addition to that, they always brought a guitar.

1:17:35.420 --> 1:17:37.900
 They were a lot more fun than a lot of my other colleagues

1:17:37.900 --> 1:17:39.300
 to hang out with at meetings.

1:17:39.300 --> 1:17:42.300
 So in any event, the right brain is doing things

1:17:42.300 --> 1:17:45.220
 that are more about manipulating spatial information.

1:17:45.220 --> 1:17:47.340
 And I'll talk about this more in a future episode,

1:17:47.340 --> 1:17:50.780
 but this was discovered in split brain patients,

1:17:50.780 --> 1:17:52.060
 so people that lack connection

1:17:52.060 --> 1:17:53.940
 between the two sides of the brain.

1:17:53.940 --> 1:17:55.500
 And this had to be teased out

1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:56.860
 through very complicated experiments.

1:17:56.860 --> 1:17:59.340
 People like Roger Sperry, who won a Nobel Prize for this,

1:17:59.340 --> 1:18:02.340
 who was at Caltech, Mike Gazzaniga and others,

1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:05.780
 figured out these lateralized differences.

1:18:05.780 --> 1:18:09.220
 But let's just try and demolish the myth

1:18:09.220 --> 1:18:13.620
 that the right side is synthetic and holistic and emotive

1:18:13.620 --> 1:18:15.900
 and that the left side is logical, sequential and analytic,

1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:18.340
 that you're a left brain person or a right brain person.

1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:19.780
 Nothing could be further from the truth.

1:18:19.780 --> 1:18:21.860
 There's no scientific evidence to support that.

1:18:21.860 --> 1:18:25.280
 And there's a few lesion studies that can tease out effects

1:18:25.280 --> 1:18:27.560
 that make you think that's what's happening,

1:18:27.560 --> 1:18:29.120
 but the really careful work

1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:31.180
 points in a totally different direction.

1:18:31.180 --> 1:18:33.100
 We can't have a complete conversation

1:18:33.100 --> 1:18:36.580
 about emotions and bonds and social connection

1:18:36.580 --> 1:18:38.700
 without talking about oxytocin.

1:18:38.700 --> 1:18:40.700
 Oxytocin has come to such prominence

1:18:40.700 --> 1:18:43.820
 in the last decade or so, and seems to be everywhere.

1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:46.560
 Anytime you hear a discussion about neuroscience

1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:49.480
 in the brain or hormones in the brain,

1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:55.860
 oxytocin is released in response to lactation in females.

1:18:55.860 --> 1:19:00.660
 It is released in response to sexual interactions.

1:19:00.660 --> 1:19:05.140
 It is released in response to non-sexual touch.

1:19:05.140 --> 1:19:08.220
 It's released in males and females.

1:19:08.220 --> 1:19:11.380
 And indeed it's involved in pair bonding

1:19:11.380 --> 1:19:14.480
 and the establishment of social bonds in general.

1:19:16.440 --> 1:19:21.180
 How it does that seems to be by matching internal state.

1:19:21.180 --> 1:19:23.940
 It seems to both increase

1:19:23.940 --> 1:19:26.860
 synchrony of internal state somehow,

1:19:26.860 --> 1:19:29.460
 maybe it sets a level of calmness or alertness,

1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:31.640
 that seems like a reasonable hypothesis,

1:19:32.540 --> 1:19:35.640
 as well as raising people's awareness

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:39.260
 for the emotional state of their partner.

1:19:39.260 --> 1:19:42.300
 And again, this brings us back to this alertness

1:19:42.300 --> 1:19:46.620
 calmness axis and this interoceptive, exteroceptive axis.

1:19:47.860 --> 1:19:49.100
 In order to form good bonds,

1:19:49.100 --> 1:19:52.260
 we can't just be thinking about how we feel,

1:19:52.260 --> 1:19:54.880
 we also need to be paying attention to how others feel,

1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:57.260
 and we're evaluating a match.

1:19:57.260 --> 1:19:58.700
 We're trying to see whether or not

1:19:58.700 --> 1:20:02.460
 there seems to be some sort of synchrony between states.

1:20:02.460 --> 1:20:06.220
 And oxytocin both seems to increase that synchrony

1:20:06.220 --> 1:20:10.400
 and increase the awareness for the emotional state of others.

1:20:11.460 --> 1:20:13.220
 Now, I know many of you are probably screaming

1:20:13.220 --> 1:20:15.540
 mirror neurons, mirror neurons.

1:20:15.540 --> 1:20:17.540
 Mirror neurons, as some of you may know,

1:20:17.540 --> 1:20:19.580
 and some of you perhaps may not,

1:20:19.580 --> 1:20:22.780
 are neurons that were discovered in animals and humans

1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:26.460
 for their ability to respond

1:20:26.460 --> 1:20:29.780
 when people engaged in certain physical actions

1:20:29.780 --> 1:20:31.200
 like lifting of a pen,

1:20:31.200 --> 1:20:33.600
 but the same neurons would respond

1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:37.100
 when somebody watched someone else lift a pen.

1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:39.580
 So they were really mirrors of,

1:20:39.580 --> 1:20:42.980
 or representing mirrors of behavior,

1:20:42.980 --> 1:20:44.860
 both in self and in others.

1:20:46.520 --> 1:20:48.980
 Mirror neurons are very controversial.

1:20:48.980 --> 1:20:51.160
 There are many neuroscientists who I respect a lot

1:20:51.160 --> 1:20:53.460
 who don't think they exist

1:20:53.460 --> 1:20:55.820
 because they look at the data

1:20:55.820 --> 1:20:57.740
 and the data, at least in their mind,

1:20:57.740 --> 1:21:01.460
 were over-interpreted in the realm of empathy

1:21:01.460 --> 1:21:05.340
 and in assigning value to the emotional states of others.

1:21:05.340 --> 1:21:06.900
 And when I look at the literature,

1:21:06.900 --> 1:21:11.900
 my opinion is that indeed there are neurons in the brain

1:21:12.420 --> 1:21:15.360
 that clearly represent the actions of others,

1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:16.820
 but it's not clear that they're wired

1:21:16.820 --> 1:21:19.820
 into the emotion and empathy system in any direct way.

1:21:19.820 --> 1:21:22.620
 And I think the growing consensus is that mirror neurons,

1:21:22.620 --> 1:21:27.200
 while the name is terrific, is so catchy

1:21:27.200 --> 1:21:28.300
 and encompasses so much

1:21:28.300 --> 1:21:29.920
 of what you would love for it to encompass,

1:21:29.920 --> 1:21:32.060
 but that the data don't really support that.

1:21:32.060 --> 1:21:33.100
 But this is controversial,

1:21:33.100 --> 1:21:35.920
 and I'm perfectly happy to get experts on here

1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:38.940
 that could debate it better than I could.

1:21:38.940 --> 1:21:42.220
 There are, however, neurons in the brain

1:21:42.220 --> 1:21:45.340
 that were discovered by my colleague Karen Harush

1:21:45.340 --> 1:21:49.460
 at Stanford when she was working in Noam Ziv's lab

1:21:50.420 --> 1:21:55.420
 that clearly point to the fact that primate species

1:21:55.420 --> 1:22:00.420
 are making assumptions and are trying to predict

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:03.860
 the behavior of other members of their species.

1:22:03.860 --> 1:22:05.420
 It's an experiment I don't have time to go into

1:22:05.420 --> 1:22:07.960
 in real detail, which probably just get Karen on here.

1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:09.120
 For those of you that are familiar

1:22:09.120 --> 1:22:10.240
 with the prisoner's dilemma,

1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:13.120
 which is really a model of cooperation,

1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:17.040
 you can either cooperate or one member

1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:18.880
 of a given interaction can cooperate

1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:22.480
 and the other one won't, or you can both not cooperate.

1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:24.820
 There are ways in which you can solve

1:22:24.820 --> 1:22:26.560
 this so-called prisoner's dilemma

1:22:26.560 --> 1:22:29.940
 by looking at previous behavior and making predictions

1:22:29.940 --> 1:22:32.840
 about the likely next behavior

1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:35.560
 that the other individual will engage in.

1:22:35.560 --> 1:22:36.960
 And there do seem to be neurons

1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:40.800
 that are doing these sorts of predictions or computations.

1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:44.660
 And again, I'll go into this in more detail in the future.

1:22:44.660 --> 1:22:46.480
 So rather than think about mirror neurons,

1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:50.620
 like neurons for empathy, I think it's more correct

1:22:50.620 --> 1:22:52.340
 to think about neurons that are trying

1:22:52.340 --> 1:22:54.280
 to predict the behavior of others.

1:22:54.280 --> 1:22:57.020
 And that's, as we said, one of the core features

1:22:57.020 --> 1:23:01.420
 of emotions, which are to establish bonds

1:23:01.420 --> 1:23:03.980
 and through those bonds to be able to predict behavior.

1:23:03.980 --> 1:23:07.580
 So oxytocin is one component of this ability

1:23:07.580 --> 1:23:11.420
 to predict other's behavior and to guide our own behavior.

1:23:11.420 --> 1:23:15.620
 So here's some experiments that involve the administration

1:23:15.620 --> 1:23:17.460
 of intranasal oxytocin.

1:23:17.460 --> 1:23:20.420
 This is actually, people now I think you need a prescription

1:23:20.420 --> 1:23:21.640
 although in some places you don't.

1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:24.420
 There are people who are taking intranasal oxytocin

1:23:24.420 --> 1:23:27.360
 in order to try and increase the depth of bonding.

1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:29.580
 And I don't recommend you do that.

1:23:29.580 --> 1:23:30.980
 I've never tried that.

1:23:30.980 --> 1:23:32.480
 Whatever oxytocin I've released,

1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:37.180
 I've made without an intranasal exogenous application.

1:23:37.180 --> 1:23:40.300
 But what's been reported is

1:23:40.300 --> 1:23:43.020
 increased positive communication among couples.

1:23:43.020 --> 1:23:46.580
 So people have taken intranasal oxytocin in studies.

1:23:46.580 --> 1:23:48.900
 So that study, just for those of you who like,

1:23:48.900 --> 1:23:50.460
 was published in biological psychiatry,

1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:53.940
 which my psychiatry colleagues tell me is a fine journal.

1:23:53.940 --> 1:23:56.040
 And the title is intranasal oxytocin

1:23:56.040 --> 1:23:57.820
 increases positive communication

1:23:57.820 --> 1:24:00.300
 and reduces the stress hormone cortisol levels

1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:01.780
 during couple conflict.

1:24:02.900 --> 1:24:04.460
 They have them fight

1:24:04.460 --> 1:24:07.880
 or they have them fight with and without oxytocin.

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:08.720
 So interesting.

1:24:09.580 --> 1:24:12.300
 Very much in line with the idea that oxytocin

1:24:12.300 --> 1:24:14.820
 is the quote unquote trust hormone.

1:24:14.820 --> 1:24:16.880
 That's in keeping with that.

1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:18.580
 That was a 2009 paper.

1:24:18.580 --> 1:24:21.220
 There's other evidence, for instance,

1:24:21.220 --> 1:24:24.580
 that men report a greater sense of connection

1:24:24.580 --> 1:24:27.360
 and intimacy with their partners during sex

1:24:27.360 --> 1:24:30.020
 after taking intranasal oxytocin.

1:24:30.020 --> 1:24:32.620
 There are studies in autistic children,

1:24:32.620 --> 1:24:34.500
 giving them intranasal oxytocin

1:24:34.500 --> 1:24:36.660
 as a way to try and help them

1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:39.180
 establish better social connection

1:24:39.180 --> 1:24:42.780
 and quote unquote empathy or theory of mind.

1:24:42.780 --> 1:24:44.420
 I've talked about theory of mind before

1:24:44.420 --> 1:24:48.580
 or understanding of what other children

1:24:48.580 --> 1:24:50.180
 and adults are experiencing.

1:24:50.180 --> 1:24:54.740
 So oxytocin does seem to create these general effects

1:24:54.740 --> 1:24:58.820
 and how nuanced they are in one situation or another,

1:24:58.820 --> 1:24:59.820
 I don't know.

1:24:59.820 --> 1:25:01.380
 I'm aware and I was told

1:25:01.380 --> 1:25:02.900
 and I'm definitely not recommending this

1:25:02.900 --> 1:25:07.340
 that there's a marketed oxytocin ketamine nasal spray.

1:25:07.340 --> 1:25:10.800
 Now I have no idea, maybe someone can put in the comments

1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:14.200
 why you'd want to combine oxytocin and ketamine.

1:25:14.200 --> 1:25:15.960
 I can't imagine why.

1:25:15.960 --> 1:25:18.220
 Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic

1:25:18.220 --> 1:25:20.540
 that's used for the treatment of PTSD.

1:25:20.540 --> 1:25:23.340
 It used to be used as a recreational drug.

1:25:23.340 --> 1:25:27.720
 It's very similar to PCP, seems quite dangerous in fact.

1:25:29.620 --> 1:25:32.700
 I don't know why those two things would be combined,

1:25:32.700 --> 1:25:34.620
 why one would want to combine them,

1:25:34.620 --> 1:25:36.980
 but there are products out there

1:25:36.980 --> 1:25:38.560
 that seem to combine those two things.

1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:41.580
 And I'm not certain why one would do that,

1:25:41.580 --> 1:25:45.180
 but it's interesting to note that it's happening.

1:25:45.180 --> 1:25:47.420
 A particularly interesting study about oxytocin

1:25:47.420 --> 1:25:49.620
 is that that was published in the Journal of Neuroscience,

1:25:49.620 --> 1:25:50.820
 which is a good journal,

1:25:51.820 --> 1:25:54.220
 that oxytocin modulates social distance

1:25:54.220 --> 1:25:56.500
 between males and females.

1:25:56.500 --> 1:25:57.460
 So this is interesting.

1:25:57.460 --> 1:26:00.140
 What they did is they gave oxytocin

1:26:00.140 --> 1:26:03.460
 to people that were in monogamous relationships

1:26:03.460 --> 1:26:06.600
 and then they evaluated the extent to which the,

1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:08.420
 in this case, the males in those relationships

1:26:08.420 --> 1:26:10.020
 would pay attention to,

1:26:10.020 --> 1:26:14.080
 visual attention to attractive other potential partners.

1:26:14.080 --> 1:26:16.220
 And it seemed like that the general takeaway

1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:18.580
 from the study is that oxytocin administration

1:26:18.580 --> 1:26:20.900
 seemed to promote monogamous behavior.

1:26:20.900 --> 1:26:22.900
 So behavior that was in line with monogamy

1:26:22.900 --> 1:26:24.420
 of the relationship that they were in,

1:26:24.420 --> 1:26:28.000
 as opposed to foraging for potentially new mates.

1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.240
 Now, of course, these are somewhat artificial experiments

1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:31.580
 or very artificial experiments,

1:26:31.580 --> 1:26:33.360
 depending on how you interpret them.

1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:36.900
 But the general theme is that oxytocin

1:26:36.900 --> 1:26:41.460
 is promoting monogamy, it's promoting pair bonding,

1:26:41.460 --> 1:26:44.260
 it's promoting a understanding

1:26:44.260 --> 1:26:46.820
 of the internal state of others,

1:26:46.820 --> 1:26:49.300
 which requires enhanced exteroception

1:26:49.300 --> 1:26:50.860
 for those particular others.

1:26:50.860 --> 1:26:54.020
 So not just generally having them look everywhere

1:26:54.020 --> 1:26:55.220
 and see what's going on in the world,

1:26:55.220 --> 1:26:57.220
 but particularly paying attention

1:26:57.220 --> 1:26:59.680
 to the emotional states of others.

1:26:59.680 --> 1:27:01.220
 I'm sure several of you will be asking,

1:27:01.220 --> 1:27:03.540
 well, what can I do to increase oxytocin

1:27:03.540 --> 1:27:04.700
 if that's your goal?

1:27:04.700 --> 1:27:06.580
 There's some evidence, and I invite you again

1:27:06.580 --> 1:27:11.140
 to go to examine.com or another such site like PubMed,

1:27:11.140 --> 1:27:12.760
 if you want to forage PubMed,

1:27:12.760 --> 1:27:16.300
 that vitamin D is required for proper production,

1:27:16.300 --> 1:27:19.660
 and in some cases can increase levels of oxytocin

1:27:19.660 --> 1:27:21.700
 when supplemented, which is interesting.

1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:23.840
 And that, believe it or not, melatonin,

1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:24.900
 our old friend melatonin,

1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:29.340
 which I have pushed back against as a supplement for sleep

1:27:29.340 --> 1:27:32.180
 because of some of what I view

1:27:32.180 --> 1:27:35.320
 as untoward side effects of melatonin in most cases.

1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:38.220
 But it seems like melatonin in some cases

1:27:38.220 --> 1:27:41.640
 can prime the system

1:27:41.640 --> 1:27:44.660
 for slightly increased oxytocin release.

1:27:44.660 --> 1:27:45.840
 There's even one report,

1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:48.220
 although it didn't look that strong to me,

1:27:48.220 --> 1:27:51.820
 that low doses of caffeine could increase oxytocin release.

1:27:51.820 --> 1:27:54.500
 But that to me falls under the category

1:27:54.500 --> 1:27:57.900
 of what was once described as a drug

1:27:57.900 --> 1:28:00.060
 when injected into a person or animal

1:28:00.060 --> 1:28:02.760
 is always effective at producing a scientific paper,

1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:04.180
 meaning that you can get a result,

1:28:04.180 --> 1:28:06.160
 but the result isn't always so robust.

1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:08.480
 So you always want to read past the titles and the abstracts

1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:10.260
 and get into the meat of the paper.

1:28:10.260 --> 1:28:11.420
 And when I did that,

1:28:11.420 --> 1:28:14.520
 the effects were pretty negligible with caffeine on oxytocin.

1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:16.860
 But it's interesting that vitamin D and melatonin

1:28:16.860 --> 1:28:19.600
 may have some positive effects on oxytocin release.

1:28:19.600 --> 1:28:22.360
 But like I said, many people are just taking oxytocin

1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:24.700
 directly through these intranasal sprays.

1:28:24.700 --> 1:28:28.220
 I'm pretty sure it's prescription in most places, but check.

1:28:28.220 --> 1:28:30.340
 And again, I'm not recommending anybody do that.

1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:31.500
 I've never tried it.

1:28:31.500 --> 1:28:32.340
 I don't know that I will.

1:28:32.340 --> 1:28:33.940
 I think I'm going to stick with the oxytocin

1:28:33.940 --> 1:28:35.260
 that I've got.

1:28:35.260 --> 1:28:36.700
 The other molecule that we make

1:28:36.700 --> 1:28:40.520
 that's extremely important for social bonds and emotionality

1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:41.900
 is one that we're going to talk about more

1:28:41.900 --> 1:28:45.580
 in the month on hormones, and that's vasopressin.

1:28:45.580 --> 1:28:48.540
 Vasopressin suppresses urination.

1:28:48.540 --> 1:28:51.940
 It was actually developed, it's made by the body,

1:28:51.940 --> 1:28:53.940
 but it was developed as a treatment

1:28:53.940 --> 1:28:55.820
 for something called diabetes insipidus,

1:28:55.820 --> 1:28:58.140
 where people urinate excessively

1:28:58.140 --> 1:28:59.840
 and they actually risk dehydration

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.000
 and they can lose a lot of electrolytes, et cetera.

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:03.900
 So it causes water retention.

1:29:03.900 --> 1:29:06.900
 Alcohol consumption inhibits vasopressin.

1:29:06.900 --> 1:29:08.360
 So large amounts of alcohol,

1:29:08.360 --> 1:29:11.900
 made people excrete a lot of fluid and so forth.

1:29:11.900 --> 1:29:15.260
 Vasopressin has effects on the brain directly.

1:29:15.260 --> 1:29:18.940
 It actually creates feelings of giddy love.

1:29:18.940 --> 1:29:22.660
 It also increases memory in very potent ways.

1:29:22.660 --> 1:29:24.900
 There's a whole biohacking community

1:29:24.900 --> 1:29:29.180
 that has been dabbling with vasopressin for some time.

1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:30.060
 I have never tried it.

1:29:30.060 --> 1:29:31.100
 I certainly don't recommend it.

1:29:31.100 --> 1:29:35.680
 It is prescription, and it is a pretty serious compound

1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:39.380
 to start messing with

1:29:39.380 --> 1:29:42.020
 because it has so many different effects in the body.

1:29:42.020 --> 1:29:46.460
 It's interesting because it creates the sense of giddy love.

1:29:46.460 --> 1:29:49.980
 It's also used somewhat as an aphrodisiac.

1:29:49.980 --> 1:29:52.380
 So it's similar to oxytocin.

1:29:52.380 --> 1:29:53.940
 It also has very interesting effects

1:29:53.940 --> 1:29:57.320
 on monogamous or non-monogamous behavior.

1:29:57.320 --> 1:29:59.460
 This, again, we will revisit in the future,

1:29:59.460 --> 1:30:02.340
 but there's a beautiful set of experiments

1:30:02.340 --> 1:30:04.460
 that have been done in a little rodent species

1:30:04.460 --> 1:30:05.860
 called a prairie vole.

1:30:05.860 --> 1:30:07.460
 It turns out there are two different populations

1:30:07.460 --> 1:30:08.280
 of prairie voles.

1:30:08.280 --> 1:30:09.120
 Some are monogamous.

1:30:09.120 --> 1:30:12.720
 They always mate with the same other prairie vole.

1:30:12.720 --> 1:30:16.260
 And some are very robustly non-monogamous.

1:30:16.260 --> 1:30:18.640
 They mate with as many other prairie voles as they can.

1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:20.780
 And it turns out that levels of vasopressin

1:30:20.780 --> 1:30:22.620
 and or vasopressin receptor

1:30:22.620 --> 1:30:24.900
 dictate whether or not they're monogamous or not.

1:30:24.900 --> 1:30:27.560
 And there's actually some interesting evidence in humans

1:30:27.560 --> 1:30:29.500
 when people report their behavior,

1:30:29.500 --> 1:30:31.500
 assuming they're reporting it accurately,

1:30:31.500 --> 1:30:34.000
 that vasopressin and vasopressin levels

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:37.380
 can relate to monogamy or non-monogamy in humans as well.

1:30:37.380 --> 1:30:40.960
 We're going to talk about this in the month on hormones.

1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:42.780
 If we're talking about the neuroscience of emotions,

1:30:42.780 --> 1:30:45.180
 we have to talk about the vagus nerve.

1:30:45.180 --> 1:30:48.180
 I described what the vagus nerve is in a previous episode.

1:30:48.180 --> 1:30:51.540
 That's these connections between the body and the viscera,

1:30:51.540 --> 1:30:53.060
 including the gut, the heart, the lungs,

1:30:53.060 --> 1:30:55.000
 and the immune system, and the brain.

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:57.520
 And that the brain is also controlling these organs

1:30:57.520 --> 1:30:58.940
 so it's a two-way street.

1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:02.500
 There's this big myth out there that I mentioned before

1:31:02.500 --> 1:31:05.780
 that stimulating the vagus in various ways

1:31:05.780 --> 1:31:09.020
 leads to calmness, that it's always going to calm you down.

1:31:09.020 --> 1:31:10.640
 And that is false.

1:31:10.640 --> 1:31:12.360
 I just want to repeat, that is completely false.

1:31:12.360 --> 1:31:14.140
 In fact, there was just a paper,

1:31:14.140 --> 1:31:16.180
 yet another paper published the other day,

1:31:16.180 --> 1:31:17.140
 which is fantastic,

1:31:17.140 --> 1:31:18.780
 which is from David McCormick's lab

1:31:18.780 --> 1:31:19.980
 up at the University of Oregon.

1:31:19.980 --> 1:31:23.020
 It's published in Current Biology, excellent journal,

1:31:23.020 --> 1:31:25.060
 showing, I'm just reading the title,

1:31:25.060 --> 1:31:28.660
 Vegas nerve stimulation induces widespread cortical,

1:31:28.660 --> 1:31:31.300
 the neocortex, and behavioral activation.

1:31:31.300 --> 1:31:33.220
 I've read the paper, it's fantastic.

1:31:34.060 --> 1:31:35.600
 It illustrates yet again,

1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:38.440
 stimulation of the vagus increases dopamine release,

1:31:38.440 --> 1:31:42.520
 increases activation of the brain alertness.

1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:45.220
 It is a stimulant of alertness.

1:31:45.220 --> 1:31:48.300
 It is not calming people down.

1:31:48.300 --> 1:31:50.980
 Now, this is interesting in light of emotionality

1:31:52.260 --> 1:31:54.740
 because of work that's been done

1:31:54.740 --> 1:31:56.900
 by many groups, but in particular,

1:31:56.900 --> 1:31:58.780
 I'm going to focus on the work of a colleague of mine,

1:31:58.780 --> 1:32:01.380
 Carl Deisseroth at Stanford, who's a psychiatrist,

1:32:01.380 --> 1:32:03.620
 but has also developed a lot of tools

1:32:03.620 --> 1:32:07.140
 to adjust the activity of neurons in real time

1:32:07.140 --> 1:32:10.580
 using light and electrical stimulation and so forth.

1:32:10.580 --> 1:32:12.640
 I'll refer you to an article in the New Yorker

1:32:12.640 --> 1:32:14.200
 that was published about this a few years ago.

1:32:14.200 --> 1:32:15.900
 I'm going to read a brief excerpt,

1:32:15.900 --> 1:32:18.740
 I'll put the link in the caption as well.

1:32:18.740 --> 1:32:20.860
 He's talking to an extremely depressed,

1:32:20.860 --> 1:32:25.860
 suicidally depressed patient who has a small device implanted

1:32:26.420 --> 1:32:29.060
 that allows her to adjust her vagus nerve activity.

1:32:29.060 --> 1:32:31.700
 Now, vagus stimulation was originally developed

1:32:31.700 --> 1:32:33.340
 for the treatment of epilepsy.

1:32:33.340 --> 1:32:36.420
 It's now being used for various other purposes.

1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:40.980
 Vagus stimulation can even increase plasticity, it seems.

1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:43.420
 So again, increasing activity of the vagus

1:32:43.420 --> 1:32:46.540
 increases alertness, and it's just incredible

1:32:46.540 --> 1:32:49.260
 to see what happens in real time to emotionality

1:32:49.260 --> 1:32:51.180
 when the vagus is stimulated.

1:32:51.180 --> 1:32:54.740
 Again, not calming, but activating alertness.

1:32:54.740 --> 1:32:57.260
 They're in his office and they're talking

1:32:57.260 --> 1:32:59.360
 and he asks her how she's doing.

1:32:59.360 --> 1:33:01.520
 And she describes how she's been doing

1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:05.540
 as previously as quote unquote, going pancake,

1:33:05.540 --> 1:33:08.420
 which for her just means totally laid out flat,

1:33:08.420 --> 1:33:10.000
 not much going on.

1:33:10.000 --> 1:33:13.060
 She talks about how she doesn't want to pursue a job,

1:33:13.060 --> 1:33:14.620
 she's really depressed.

1:33:15.460 --> 1:33:18.980
 And he says in typical good psychiatrist fashion,

1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:20.300
 well, that's a lot to think about.

1:33:20.300 --> 1:33:21.600
 That's actually the quote.

1:33:23.500 --> 1:33:26.100
 And they talk about her blood pressure, et cetera.

1:33:26.100 --> 1:33:30.740
 And then she says, moods been down, just spiraling down,

1:33:30.740 --> 1:33:33.980
 talks about insomnia, bad dreams, low appetite.

1:33:33.980 --> 1:33:35.760
 So this is severe depression.

1:33:35.760 --> 1:33:37.900
 This is what we call major depression.

1:33:37.900 --> 1:33:40.340
 And then she requests, can we please go up

1:33:40.340 --> 1:33:43.060
 to 1.5 on vagus stimulation?

1:33:43.060 --> 1:33:46.700
 She'd been receiving 1.2 milliamps of stimulation

1:33:46.700 --> 1:33:48.700
 every five minutes to 30 seconds,

1:33:48.700 --> 1:33:50.920
 but was no longer able to feel the effects.

1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:53.000
 So he says, okay, I think we can go up a little,

1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:54.500
 you're tolerating things well.

1:33:55.740 --> 1:34:00.500
 They start the stimulation and quote,

1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:02.680
 in the course of the next few minutes,

1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:04.740
 her name was Sally, underwent a remarkable change.

1:34:04.740 --> 1:34:07.360
 Her frown disappeared, she became cheerful,

1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:08.740
 describing the pleasure she'd had

1:34:08.740 --> 1:34:09.780
 during the Christmas holiday

1:34:09.780 --> 1:34:11.180
 and recounting how she'd recently watched

1:34:11.180 --> 1:34:13.220
 some YouTube videos of Diceroth.

1:34:14.780 --> 1:34:17.680
 She was still smiling and talking when the session ended

1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:19.380
 and they walked out to the reception area.

1:34:19.380 --> 1:34:21.900
 So this is just by stimulating and activating the vagus.

1:34:21.900 --> 1:34:23.160
 Now, why am I bringing this up?

1:34:23.160 --> 1:34:25.360
 Well, for several reasons.

1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:27.660
 One is the vagus is fascinating

1:34:27.660 --> 1:34:29.120
 in terms of the brain-body connection.

1:34:29.120 --> 1:34:33.460
 Two, I'd like to keep trying to dispel the myth

1:34:33.460 --> 1:34:35.940
 that vagus stimulation is all about being calm.

1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:37.660
 It's really about being alert.

1:34:37.660 --> 1:34:39.780
 I don't know how that originally got going backwards,

1:34:39.780 --> 1:34:42.420
 but it's about being alert.

1:34:42.420 --> 1:34:44.980
 And once again, level of alertness

1:34:44.980 --> 1:34:47.780
 or level of calmness is impacting emotion.

1:34:47.780 --> 1:34:50.460
 That this access of alertness and calmness

1:34:50.460 --> 1:34:54.400
 is one primary access in emotion.

1:34:54.400 --> 1:34:56.220
 It's not the only one because there's also

1:34:56.220 --> 1:34:58.560
 this valence component of good or bad.

1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:00.380
 And those two aren't the only ones

1:35:00.380 --> 1:35:01.620
 because there's also this component

1:35:01.620 --> 1:35:03.300
 of interoceptive, exteroceptive

1:35:03.300 --> 1:35:04.160
 that we talked about earlier.

1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:05.660
 And there will be others too.

1:35:05.660 --> 1:35:07.180
 Again, it's not exhaustive.

1:35:07.180 --> 1:35:08.460
 But I find it fascinating

1:35:08.460 --> 1:35:11.160
 and it really brings us back to where we started,

1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:13.500
 which is what are the core elements of emotion

1:35:13.500 --> 1:35:15.180
 and what can you do about them?

1:35:15.180 --> 1:35:17.340
 And before we close up today,

1:35:17.340 --> 1:35:18.940
 I just want to make sure that

1:35:18.940 --> 1:35:20.320
 even though I've mentioned some tools,

1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:22.780
 I talked about the Mood Meter app,

1:35:22.780 --> 1:35:25.320
 I talked about oxytocin

1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:28.060
 and some of the things that impact oxytocin.

1:35:28.060 --> 1:35:29.780
 I talked about some of the ways

1:35:29.780 --> 1:35:32.300
 that you can conceptualize emotions.

1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:34.660
 This business of how you conceptualize emotions

1:35:34.660 --> 1:35:38.700
 is really the most powerful tool you can ever have

1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:41.460
 in terms of understanding and regulating your emotional state

1:35:41.460 --> 1:35:44.380
 if you're willing to try and wrap your head around it.

1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:46.740
 I realize it's not the simplest thing to do,

1:35:46.740 --> 1:35:48.620
 but rather than think of emotions

1:35:48.620 --> 1:35:52.540
 as just these labels, happy, sad, awe, depressed,

1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:56.020
 thinking about emotions, excuse me,

1:35:56.020 --> 1:36:00.820
 as elements of the brain and body

1:36:00.820 --> 1:36:02.940
 that encompass levels of alertness

1:36:02.940 --> 1:36:05.540
 that include a dynamic with the outside world

1:36:05.540 --> 1:36:07.820
 and your perception of your internal state.

1:36:07.820 --> 1:36:10.260
 And starting to really think about emotions

1:36:10.260 --> 1:36:13.540
 in a structured way can not only allow you

1:36:13.540 --> 1:36:15.420
 to understand some of the pathology

1:36:15.420 --> 1:36:18.140
 of when you might feel depressed or anxious

1:36:18.140 --> 1:36:19.680
 or others are depressed and anxious,

1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:22.860
 but also to develop a richer emotional experience

1:36:22.860 --> 1:36:23.760
 to anything.

1:36:23.760 --> 1:36:25.140
 Now, of course, I don't expect that

1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:27.580
 as you're out there interacting with friends

1:36:27.580 --> 1:36:29.480
 and you're watching TV and experiencing life

1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:32.540
 that you should be parsing every bit of your experience

1:36:32.540 --> 1:36:34.820
 in some sort of reductionist and mechanistic way.

1:36:34.820 --> 1:36:36.260
 That's not the goal here.

1:36:36.260 --> 1:36:38.600
 But for those of you that are practitioners,

1:36:38.600 --> 1:36:40.940
 teachers of any kind, for those of you that are kids,

1:36:40.940 --> 1:36:43.940
 for those of you that are trying to understand

1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:46.160
 what your emotional life and your consciousness,

1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:49.020
 dare I say the word, really consists of,

1:36:49.020 --> 1:36:52.340
 I do believe that these are fundamental elements

1:36:52.340 --> 1:36:54.380
 that are well supported by the science

1:36:54.380 --> 1:36:57.900
 across a variety of researchers doing things

1:36:57.900 --> 1:36:59.780
 from a variety of different perspectives

1:36:59.780 --> 1:37:01.460
 and some of whom agree with one another

1:37:01.460 --> 1:37:03.300
 and some of whom don't.

1:37:03.300 --> 1:37:06.900
 So I offer it to you as a source of knowledge

1:37:06.900 --> 1:37:09.180
 from which you can start to think about

1:37:09.180 --> 1:37:12.380
 your emotional life differently, I hope,

1:37:12.380 --> 1:37:15.160
 as well as others in a way that builds more richness

1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:18.460
 into that experience, not that detracts from it.

1:37:18.460 --> 1:37:21.280
 One last point as it relates to that.

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:24.560
 Many of you have asked me about psychedelic therapies

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:28.480
 that are now emerging, things like psilocybin and MDMA.

1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:32.260
 We are, of course, going to dive into that topic deeply.

1:37:32.260 --> 1:37:36.080
 We have an expert guest coming on to discuss that topic.

1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:41.080
 Those compounds clearly affect the aspects of emotionality

1:37:41.580 --> 1:37:43.580
 that we were talking about today.

1:37:43.580 --> 1:37:47.540
 Calmness, alertness, valence, good or bad,

1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:50.820
 interoceptive, extra receptive positioning.

1:37:50.820 --> 1:37:55.340
 And so rather than just do a kind of cursory exploration

1:37:55.340 --> 1:37:57.360
 of those compounds and what the therapeutic

1:37:57.360 --> 1:37:59.940
 and scientific community is thinking about them

1:37:59.940 --> 1:38:02.660
 and how they function, I think it's more important

1:38:02.660 --> 1:38:05.280
 to embed that framework in our thinking

1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:07.460
 so that when we address psychedelics

1:38:07.460 --> 1:38:09.320
 and we address other sorts of therapies,

1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:11.000
 cognitive behavioral therapy,

1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:12.920
 different types of emotive therapies

1:38:12.920 --> 1:38:16.460
 that relate to individuals and couples, et cetera,

1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:18.900
 that we are able to think about them

1:38:18.900 --> 1:38:20.940
 with some sort of structure and rigor

1:38:20.940 --> 1:38:24.060
 rather than just talk about them as a bunch of chemicals

1:38:24.060 --> 1:38:26.520
 that produce these amazing experiences

1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:28.100
 that people need to tell you about.

1:38:28.100 --> 1:38:29.780
 Because if there's one truth,

1:38:29.780 --> 1:38:32.800
 it seems that psychedelics seem to promote activity

1:38:32.800 --> 1:38:35.200
 of storytelling about psychedelic experience.

1:38:35.200 --> 1:38:38.700
 But that itself is not really what the therapeutic community

1:38:38.700 --> 1:38:41.740
 and the academic communities are interested in.

1:38:41.740 --> 1:38:43.860
 They're interested in trying to understand

1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:47.660
 the universal truths, the universal biological shifts

1:38:47.660 --> 1:38:49.860
 and psychological shifts that occur

1:38:49.860 --> 1:38:51.800
 in the clinical use of those compounds.

1:38:51.800 --> 1:38:53.540
 And so we're going to hold off for now,

1:38:53.540 --> 1:38:54.980
 but we will get to them.

1:38:54.980 --> 1:38:56.820
 Once again, we've covered an enormous amount

1:38:56.820 --> 1:38:57.820
 of material today.

1:38:57.820 --> 1:38:59.740
 It's really the equivalent of two, if not three,

1:38:59.740 --> 1:39:03.580
 university lectures in one podcast episode.

1:39:03.580 --> 1:39:05.920
 I want to thank those of you that have supported the podcast

1:39:05.920 --> 1:39:07.940
 and point to ways in which all of you

1:39:07.940 --> 1:39:09.380
 can support the podcast.

1:39:09.380 --> 1:39:11.460
 Many of these are cost-free.

1:39:11.460 --> 1:39:14.060
 The first is to please subscribe on YouTube

1:39:14.060 --> 1:39:16.580
 and as well to hit the notifications button

1:39:16.580 --> 1:39:19.100
 so that when we release new videos,

1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:21.860
 which typically is every Monday for the full length episodes

1:39:21.860 --> 1:39:25.020
 but we also know how short clips that you'll be notified.

1:39:25.860 --> 1:39:29.700
 As well, if you could subscribe on Apple and Spotify

1:39:29.700 --> 1:39:31.700
 and leave us a review on Apple,

1:39:31.700 --> 1:39:33.780
 you have the opportunity to leave us a five-star review

1:39:33.780 --> 1:39:36.180
 if you think we deserve a five-star review.

1:39:36.180 --> 1:39:38.320
 Please tell your friends and family and coworkers

1:39:38.320 --> 1:39:40.580
 about the podcast if you think the material

1:39:40.580 --> 1:39:43.500
 would be of interest and informative for them.

1:39:43.500 --> 1:39:46.840
 And if you want to send them links, that's terrific too.

1:39:46.840 --> 1:39:48.740
 We also have a Patreon account.

1:39:48.740 --> 1:39:51.860
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman

1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:55.280
 and there you can support us at any level that you like.

1:39:55.280 --> 1:39:57.380
 In addition, if you could check out our sponsors,

1:39:57.380 --> 1:40:01.000
 we always provide links to those sponsors in the captions.

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.760
 That's the best way to support the podcast.

1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:06.300
 And several of you have asked about supplements.

1:40:06.300 --> 1:40:08.640
 I talk about supplements in various episodes.

1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:09.860
 We've partnered with Thorne

1:40:09.860 --> 1:40:12.940
 because we think Thorne has the very highest levels

1:40:12.940 --> 1:40:16.420
 of stringency in terms of the purity of the contents

1:40:16.420 --> 1:40:17.980
 and the amounts of the contents.

1:40:17.980 --> 1:40:20.620
 They really put in the bottle what's listed on the bottle

1:40:20.620 --> 1:40:23.500
 which is not true for a lot of supplement companies.

1:40:23.500 --> 1:40:25.480
 If you want to see the supplements that I take,

1:40:25.480 --> 1:40:27.060
 as well as get a discount on those

1:40:27.060 --> 1:40:29.340
 or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes,

1:40:29.340 --> 1:40:34.260
 you can go to thorne.com slash U slash Huberman

1:40:34.260 --> 1:40:37.060
 and you can get 20% off any of those supplements

1:40:37.060 --> 1:40:39.100
 or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

1:40:39.100 --> 1:40:43.480
 So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E dot com

1:40:43.480 --> 1:40:47.160
 slash the letter U slash Huberman

1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:50.860
 to get 20% off any supplements that Thorne makes.

1:40:50.860 --> 1:40:52.700
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:40:52.700 --> 1:40:54.980
 I want to thank you for your time and attention

1:40:54.980 --> 1:40:57.140
 and thank you for your interest in science.

1:40:57.140 --> 1:41:02.140
 I'll see you next time.
