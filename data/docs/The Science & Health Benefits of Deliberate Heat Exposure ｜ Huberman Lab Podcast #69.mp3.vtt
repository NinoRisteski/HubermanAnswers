WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.360
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.360 --> 00:13.280
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.280 --> 00:15.160
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.120
 Today, we are talking about the science of heat,

00:18.120 --> 00:22.040
 and more specifically, the science of heating, the verb,

00:22.040 --> 00:24.440
 meaning how our body heats up

00:24.440 --> 00:27.200
 from both the outside and the inside.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.960
 Heat is a remarkable stimulus,

00:29.960 --> 00:32.240
 meaning when we are in a hot environment,

00:32.240 --> 00:35.520
 it has a profound effect on our biology.

00:35.520 --> 00:38.280
 And heating up from the outside,

00:38.280 --> 00:41.320
 or as you'll soon learn from the inside,

00:41.320 --> 00:44.720
 has a profound effect on many different aspects

00:44.720 --> 00:47.760
 of our health, including our metabolism,

00:47.760 --> 00:51.320
 both in the immediate and long-term, our cognition,

00:51.320 --> 00:54.600
 meaning our ability to think more or less clearly.

00:54.600 --> 00:56.380
 And if you're immediately thinking

00:56.380 --> 00:59.920
 that heating up makes you less capable of thinking,

00:59.920 --> 01:01.360
 you're wrong.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.760
 Heat applied properly as a stimulus

01:03.760 --> 01:06.120
 can engage certain neurochemical systems

01:06.120 --> 01:07.300
 in your brain and body

01:07.300 --> 01:10.180
 that can allow your brain to function far better.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.080
 We will talk about those data today.

01:12.080 --> 01:15.000
 So we're going to talk about the science of heat and heating,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.080
 both in terms of their mechanisms,

01:17.080 --> 01:19.760
 and as I know many of you are interested in,

01:19.760 --> 01:22.220
 the tools related to the use of heat,

01:22.220 --> 01:25.440
 things like sauna, how often to do sauna,

01:25.440 --> 01:26.860
 how long to be in the sauna,

01:26.860 --> 01:31.160
 how hot to be in the sauna for particular goals and outcomes.

01:31.160 --> 01:34.240
 We're also going to talk about the very exciting new science

01:34.240 --> 01:36.120
 around local heating,

01:36.120 --> 01:39.840
 that is the use of heat applied to specific areas

01:39.840 --> 01:42.860
 of the body in order to heal or improve tissues

01:42.860 --> 01:44.720
 at that location that you are heating,

01:44.720 --> 01:47.840
 as well as your biology and health overall.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.260
 In fact, we are going to talk about

01:49.260 --> 01:51.640
 one very recently published paper

01:51.640 --> 01:53.600
 that came out in the journal Cell.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.680
 Cell is one of the three apex journals,

01:55.680 --> 01:57.920
 meaning three of the most competitive,

01:57.920 --> 02:00.080
 most rigorous scientific journals.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.040
 Those are Nature, Science, and Cell.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.080
 This particular paper was published in Cell,

02:04.080 --> 02:06.340
 and I will go into it in more detail later.

02:06.340 --> 02:09.100
 But basically what this paper shows

02:09.100 --> 02:13.760
 is that by locally heating up skin and fat,

02:14.680 --> 02:18.280
 you can change the identity of certain fat cells

02:18.280 --> 02:20.560
 at that location and elsewhere.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.520
 We have three kinds of fat, white fat,

02:22.520 --> 02:23.800
 beige fat, and brown fat.

02:23.800 --> 02:26.360
 And as you will learn more about soon,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.560
 white fat is not very metabolically active.

02:28.560 --> 02:30.520
 It's more of a fuel reserve.

02:30.520 --> 02:33.440
 It's what we typically think of as blubbery fat.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.840
 Beige fat and brown fat are rich in mitochondria,

02:36.840 --> 02:39.320
 and those mitochondria provide a sort of furnace

02:39.320 --> 02:41.320
 or heating mechanism for your entire body

02:41.320 --> 02:45.360
 and increase your metabolism and the burning of white fat.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.200
 So in other words,

02:46.200 --> 02:49.000
 having more beige fat and brown fat is a good thing.

02:49.000 --> 02:52.420
 And it turns out that the proper application of heat

02:52.420 --> 02:54.300
 to specific areas of your body

02:54.300 --> 02:57.860
 can increase the conversion of white fat to beige fat.

02:57.860 --> 03:01.320
 In other words, turn an innocuous fuel source

03:01.320 --> 03:03.600
 into a metabolically active tissue

03:03.600 --> 03:06.640
 that can help you burn off more white fat.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.400
 I think many people are going to be interested in this paper

03:09.400 --> 03:11.840
 and the tools that emerge from this paper.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.640
 It's a fascinating set of findings

03:13.640 --> 03:15.880
 that actually emerged from my understanding

03:15.880 --> 03:20.240
 of the biology of burn and people who receive intense burns.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.820
 And that is not what I'm going to recommend to you

03:21.820 --> 03:23.280
 as a tool, of course,

03:23.280 --> 03:26.920
 but understanding a little bit about how burns impact

03:26.920 --> 03:28.320
 our biology and health

03:28.320 --> 03:30.800
 has allowed these pioneering researchers

03:30.800 --> 03:33.400
 to develop new tools to combat obesity

03:33.400 --> 03:34.560
 and metabolic disorders,

03:34.560 --> 03:37.700
 and that you can apply for basic things like fat loss.

03:37.700 --> 03:40.200
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:40.200 --> 03:42.840
 is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.040
 Our motivation for partnering with Momentous

03:45.040 --> 03:47.920
 is to provide people one location where they can go

03:47.920 --> 03:50.680
 to access the highest quality supplements

03:50.680 --> 03:53.700
 in the specific dosages that are best supported

03:53.700 --> 03:55.240
 by the scientific research

03:55.240 --> 03:57.420
 and that are discussed during various episodes

03:57.420 --> 03:59.040
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.440
 If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

04:02.440 --> 04:04.000
 you will see those formulations.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.480
 I should mention that we are going to add more formulations

04:06.480 --> 04:08.200
 in the months to come,

04:08.200 --> 04:10.720
 and you will see specific suggestions

04:10.720 --> 04:12.640
 about how best to take those supplements,

04:12.640 --> 04:14.720
 meaning what dosages and times of day,

04:14.720 --> 04:17.540
 and in fact, how to combine those supplements

04:17.540 --> 04:19.820
 with specific behavioral protocols

04:19.820 --> 04:21.480
 that have been discussed on the podcast

04:21.480 --> 04:22.760
 and are science supported

04:22.760 --> 04:25.280
 in order to derive the maximum benefit

04:25.280 --> 04:26.760
 from those supplements.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.800
 And many of you will probably also be pleased to learn

04:29.800 --> 04:32.400
 that Momentous ships not just within the United States,

04:32.400 --> 04:34.080
 but also internationally.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.800
 So once again, if you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

04:37.800 --> 04:39.320
 you will find what we firmly believe

04:39.320 --> 04:44.360
 to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages

04:44.360 --> 04:48.000
 and the best protocols for taking those supplements

04:48.000 --> 04:50.820
 along with the ideal behavioral protocols

04:50.820 --> 04:52.900
 to combine with those supplement formulations.

04:52.900 --> 04:53.740
 I'm pleased to announce

04:53.740 --> 04:57.120
 that I am hosting two live events in May, 2022.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.980
 The first live event will take place in Seattle, Washington

04:59.980 --> 05:01.400
 on May 17th.

05:01.400 --> 05:04.160
 The second live event will take place in Portland, Oregon

05:04.160 --> 05:05.480
 on May 18th.

05:05.480 --> 05:07.320
 Both are part of a lecture series entitled

05:07.320 --> 05:08.840
 The Brain-Body Contract,

05:08.840 --> 05:10.280
 during which I will talk about science

05:10.280 --> 05:11.640
 and science-based tools,

05:11.640 --> 05:13.820
 many of which overlap with the topics covered

05:13.820 --> 05:15.420
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

05:15.420 --> 05:17.360
 but most of which will not

05:17.360 --> 05:19.600
 and will be completely new topics and tools

05:19.600 --> 05:21.380
 never discussed publicly before.

05:21.380 --> 05:23.080
 Both live events will also include

05:23.080 --> 05:24.820
 a question and answer period

05:24.820 --> 05:27.980
 during which you the audience can ask me questions directly

05:27.980 --> 05:30.800
 about any aspect of science or science-based tools

05:30.800 --> 05:32.840
 and I will attempt to answer them.

05:32.840 --> 05:34.120
 Tickets for the two events,

05:34.120 --> 05:38.280
 again, Seattle on May 17th and Portland on May 18th

05:38.280 --> 05:42.360
 are both available at HubermanLab.com slash tour.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.020
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

05:45.020 --> 05:47.860
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.740
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

05:49.740 --> 05:52.360
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

05:52.360 --> 05:55.200
 and science-related tools to the general public.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.240
 In keeping with that theme,

05:56.240 --> 05:58.920
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

05:58.920 --> 06:00.740
 Our first sponsor is Element.

06:00.740 --> 06:03.640
 Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need

06:03.640 --> 06:07.120
 and none of what you don't need, meaning sugar.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.320
 It has electrolytes and the main electrolytes

06:09.320 --> 06:11.560
 are sodium, potassium, and magnesium,

06:11.560 --> 06:13.280
 which you need in the proper ratios

06:13.280 --> 06:16.040
 in order for your brain and body to function correctly.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.320
 Element was designed to get you the proper ratio

06:18.320 --> 06:21.160
 of electrolytes in order to optimize mental

06:21.160 --> 06:23.040
 and physical performance.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.520
 People out there with pre-hypertension and hypertension,

06:25.520 --> 06:27.060
 of course, should be cautious

06:27.060 --> 06:28.840
 about increasing their sodium intake,

06:28.840 --> 06:30.760
 but many people can actually benefit

06:30.760 --> 06:32.840
 from increasing their sodium intake,

06:32.840 --> 06:34.960
 both for health and for performance.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.400
 Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio

06:37.400 --> 06:40.500
 of 1000 milligrams, that's one gram of sodium,

06:40.500 --> 06:43.960
 200 milligrams of potassium, and 60 milligrams of magnesium.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.520
 I consume Element when I first wake up in the morning,

06:46.520 --> 06:49.020
 during exercise, and after exercise,

06:49.020 --> 06:51.740
 and sometimes, again, if I've been sweating profusely,

06:51.740 --> 06:53.520
 for instance, after doing a sauna

06:53.520 --> 06:56.600
 or taking a run on a hot day, things of that sort.

06:56.600 --> 06:59.180
 If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,

06:59.180 --> 07:02.000
 that's lmnt.com slash Huberman

07:02.000 --> 07:03.800
 to claim a free Element sample pack.

07:03.800 --> 07:05.480
 You only cover the cost of shipping.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.240
 Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com slash Huberman

07:09.240 --> 07:10.920
 to claim a free sample pack.

07:10.920 --> 07:13.840
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.340
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

07:16.340 --> 07:19.120
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

07:19.120 --> 07:20.680
 to help you better understand your body

07:20.680 --> 07:22.720
 and help you reach your health goals.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.600
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

07:25.600 --> 07:27.840
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

07:27.840 --> 07:30.120
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

07:30.120 --> 07:33.080
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.840
 There are a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,

07:35.840 --> 07:38.060
 but a major issue with many of them

07:38.060 --> 07:40.840
 is that you get numbers back about levels of hormones,

07:40.840 --> 07:42.820
 metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,

07:42.820 --> 07:44.880
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

07:44.880 --> 07:46.920
 Inside Tracker has solved that problem

07:46.920 --> 07:49.300
 by creating a personalized dashboard.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.840
 So you take your blood and or your DNA test,

07:51.840 --> 07:53.200
 you get the results back

07:53.200 --> 07:55.980
 and where certain values might be too high

07:55.980 --> 07:58.000
 or too low for your preference,

07:58.000 --> 08:01.240
 you can click on that and it will direct you immediately

08:01.240 --> 08:03.940
 to lifestyle factors, nutrition and supplementation, et cetera

08:03.940 --> 08:06.760
 that can help you bring those numbers back into the ranges

08:06.760 --> 08:08.320
 that are ideal for you.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.960
 So it not only gives you information

08:09.960 --> 08:11.580
 about where your health stands,

08:11.580 --> 08:14.880
 it gives you directives as to how to improve your health.

08:14.880 --> 08:16.440
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

08:16.440 --> 08:19.200

 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.740
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.760
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

08:30.760 --> 08:33.240
 that are the absolute highest quality.

08:33.240 --> 08:35.880
 I spent a lifetime studying the visual system.

08:35.880 --> 08:37.360
 I can tell you that your visual system

08:37.360 --> 08:39.700
 is incredibly sophisticated.

08:39.700 --> 08:41.380
 It allows you to do things like move

08:41.380 --> 08:44.280
 from a shady area outside to a sunny area outside

08:44.280 --> 08:46.200
 and to adjust your visual system

08:46.200 --> 08:48.100
 so you don't even notice that transition.

08:48.100 --> 08:50.940
 A lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses are not designed

08:50.940 --> 08:53.640
 with those sorts of biological transitions in mind.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.240
 Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses are different.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.120
 Every one of their glasses is designed

08:58.120 --> 09:00.400
 with the biology of the visual system in mind.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.020
 First of all, they're incredibly lightweight

09:02.020 --> 09:03.960
 so you don't even notice that they're on your face.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.200
 Second of all, they were designed to be worn

09:06.200 --> 09:08.680
 during activities like running and cycling, et cetera,

09:08.680 --> 09:11.240
 and they won't slip off your face even if you get sweaty

09:11.240 --> 09:12.480
 and they have a terrific aesthetic.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.920
 So even though they were originally designed

09:13.920 --> 09:16.420
 as active eyewear, they look great.

09:16.420 --> 09:17.620
 So you can wear them out to dinner,

09:17.620 --> 09:19.340
 to school, at work, et cetera.

09:19.340 --> 09:21.640
 If you'd like to try Roca sunglasses or eyeglasses,

09:21.640 --> 09:24.360
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com

09:24.360 --> 09:27.780
 and enter the code Huberman to save 20% on your first order.

09:27.780 --> 09:30.200
 Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com

09:30.200 --> 09:32.500
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.220
 Okay, let's talk about heat.

09:34.220 --> 09:36.380
 More specifically, let's talk about the biology

09:36.380 --> 09:39.280
 of heat and heating and the health benefits

09:39.280 --> 09:41.580
 and tools related to heat and heating.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.060
 The first question that we have to answer

09:44.060 --> 09:46.600
 is how do we heat up?

09:46.600 --> 09:50.840
 And the answer to that question is we heat up two ways.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.120
 We heat up from the outside,

09:53.120 --> 09:55.500
 meaning the things that we come into contact with,

09:55.500 --> 09:57.940
 the clothing that we put on our body,

09:57.940 --> 09:59.940
 whether or not there's heat in the room

09:59.940 --> 10:02.940
 or whether or not it's cold outside or cold in a room,

10:02.940 --> 10:05.700
 and we heat up from the inside.

10:05.700 --> 10:09.020
 Our body has the capacity to generate more heat

10:09.020 --> 10:12.860
 or to cool down, meaning to turn off the heating process.

10:12.860 --> 10:15.500
 And it can do that in ways

10:15.500 --> 10:18.460
 that match the external environment.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.040
 The simplest way to think about this

10:20.040 --> 10:22.980
 is that we actually have two body temperatures.

10:22.980 --> 10:25.620
 People will say, oh, what's body temperature, 98.6.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.260
 That's actually not true.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.500
 Body temperature varies between individuals.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.220
 It varies across time of day within individuals.

10:32.220 --> 10:36.060
 And at every point across your entire lifespan,

10:36.060 --> 10:37.780
 you have two distinct temperatures.

10:37.780 --> 10:39.900
 One is the temperature on your skin,

10:39.900 --> 10:42.780
 what scientists call your shell,

10:42.780 --> 10:45.300
 and the temperature of your core,

10:45.300 --> 10:47.180
 your viscera, meaning your organs,

10:47.180 --> 10:49.500
 your nervous system, and your spinal cord.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.740
 And as you can imagine,

10:50.740 --> 10:53.420
 the temperature of your core is always higher

10:53.420 --> 10:56.040
 than the temperature at your surface.

10:56.040 --> 10:57.100
 So the important thing to know

10:57.100 --> 10:59.540
 is that you have a temperature at your shell

10:59.540 --> 11:01.000
 and a temperature at your core.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.340
 Now you don't need to know exactly

11:02.340 --> 11:04.300
 what those temperatures are in most cases,

11:04.300 --> 11:07.180
 but it is vitally important to understand

11:07.180 --> 11:08.900
 that you have those two temperatures

11:08.900 --> 11:11.820
 and that your brain is constantly sending out signals

11:11.820 --> 11:15.060
 to your body as to whether or not it should heat up

11:15.060 --> 11:19.740
 or cool down depending on the temperature of the shell,

11:19.740 --> 11:20.980
 which makes total sense.

11:20.980 --> 11:23.720
 This is a lot like a thermostat in a room,

11:23.720 --> 11:25.600
 which is essentially paying attention

11:25.600 --> 11:27.040
 to how cold or hot it is,

11:27.040 --> 11:29.640
 and then sending signals to the heating or cooling system

11:29.640 --> 11:31.020
 to either heat up the environment

11:31.020 --> 11:32.420
 or cool down the environment

11:32.420 --> 11:35.580
 depending on the temperature in that environment.

11:35.580 --> 11:38.860
 Your brain has neurons that send signals

11:38.860 --> 11:40.540
 to other cells in your body

11:40.540 --> 11:43.140
 and deploy the release of chemicals in your brain and body

11:43.140 --> 11:45.340
 to heat you up when you are too cold

11:45.340 --> 11:48.140
 and to cool you down when you are too hot.

11:48.140 --> 11:51.740
 So if you can understand that you have two body temperatures,

11:51.740 --> 11:53.120
 one at your shell, the surface,

11:53.120 --> 11:55.180
 and one at your core inside,

11:55.180 --> 11:57.460
 and that your body and brain are always trying

11:57.460 --> 12:00.660
 to balance those two temperatures in the appropriate way,

12:00.660 --> 12:01.960
 well, then you're halfway there

12:01.960 --> 12:03.420
 to understanding the biology

12:03.420 --> 12:05.220
 of thermal regulation and heating,

12:05.220 --> 12:07.840
 and you'll be a lot further along

12:07.840 --> 12:10.820
 in understanding how specific tools can be used

12:10.820 --> 12:14.860
 to improve metabolism or improve cognition, for instance.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.100
 In fact, later you will learn

12:17.100 --> 12:19.560
 that one way that you can heat up

12:19.560 --> 12:21.860
 is by cooling down the surface of your body.

12:21.860 --> 12:22.740
 That's right.

12:22.740 --> 12:25.300
 If I were to throw a cold towel, ice cold towel

12:25.300 --> 12:28.120
 onto your torso right now and ask you,

12:28.120 --> 12:28.960
 well, how do you feel?

12:28.960 --> 12:30.820
 You'd say, oh, that's cold, that's chilly.

12:30.820 --> 12:33.060
 However, because your brain is acting

12:33.060 --> 12:34.420
 like a bit of a thermostat,

12:34.420 --> 12:38.120
 as the surface, the shell of your body felt cool,

12:38.120 --> 12:39.980
 it would make sense that that thermostat

12:39.980 --> 12:41.820
 would activate biological mechanisms

12:41.820 --> 12:43.420
 that would heat up your core.

12:44.380 --> 12:47.500
 Similarly, if I were to put you into a very hot environment,

12:47.500 --> 12:50.100
 you'd say, oh, wow, it's really, really warm in here,

12:50.100 --> 12:51.500
 but your brain and your body

12:51.500 --> 12:52.940
 would go through a lot of effort

12:52.940 --> 12:55.780
 to activate mechanisms to cool you down.

12:55.780 --> 12:57.260
 So anytime we're talking about heat,

12:57.260 --> 13:00.180
 meaning deliberate heat exposure, things like sauna,

13:00.180 --> 13:03.820
 it's very important to understand not just the stimulus,

13:03.820 --> 13:06.840
 how hot something is, how long you're in a sauna, et cetera,

13:06.840 --> 13:10.580
 but the effect that has on your shell and on your core.

13:10.580 --> 13:13.180
 If you can understand that, you can design protocols

13:13.180 --> 13:15.940
 that are literally perfect for your goals.

13:15.940 --> 13:17.620
 And as a final point about this,

13:17.620 --> 13:20.340
 if you want to develop the best tools,

13:20.340 --> 13:23.480
 leveraging heat for your biology and health and performance,

13:23.480 --> 13:27.220
 you want to understand heat as a process, as a verb,

13:27.220 --> 13:30.020
 as heating, not just heat,

13:30.020 --> 13:32.980
 because there's the temperature that you are at

13:32.980 --> 13:35.600
 before you encounter the heat stimulus,

13:35.600 --> 13:37.620
 before you get in the sauna, for instance,

13:37.620 --> 13:40.660
 during the heat stimulus, so while you're in the sauna,

13:40.660 --> 13:42.420
 and then afterward.

13:42.420 --> 13:44.420
 Everything in biology is a process.

13:44.420 --> 13:45.420
 So as you'll soon learn,

13:45.420 --> 13:49.100
 there is a specific sauna protocol that can allow you,

13:49.100 --> 13:50.420
 can allow anybody in fact,

13:50.420 --> 13:52.440
 to increase the amount of growth hormone

13:52.440 --> 13:54.980
 released into their brain and body 16 fold.

13:54.980 --> 13:57.300
 That's right, 16 fold.

13:57.300 --> 14:02.180
 However, it involves shifting from a hot environment

14:02.180 --> 14:04.260
 to a cool environment, to a hot environment,

14:04.260 --> 14:06.640
 to a cool environment, over and over and over again,

14:06.640 --> 14:08.620
 over a very short period of time,

14:08.620 --> 14:12.140
 because it engages a switch, a process that compounds,

14:12.140 --> 14:14.540
 it builds on itself to increase growth hormone

14:14.540 --> 14:15.760
 further and further.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.860
 In fact, if you were to just get into a sauna

14:17.860 --> 14:21.000
 for a very long period of time and crank up the temperature

14:21.000 --> 14:24.420
 to match the exact temperature that was used in that study,

14:24.420 --> 14:27.820
 you would not experience those increases in growth hormone.

14:27.820 --> 14:29.860
 It really is the transition between hot

14:29.860 --> 14:33.020
 and cool temperatures that engage the process

14:33.020 --> 14:35.740
 of heating and reheating over and over again.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.580
 So today you're going to learn about the use of sauna.

14:37.580 --> 14:38.940
 You're going to learn about the use

14:38.940 --> 14:42.540
 of other heat related tools for health and optimization,

14:42.540 --> 14:44.820
 not just for growth hormone, but also metabolic health,

14:44.820 --> 14:48.280
 for controlling cortisol, even to impact mental health

14:48.280 --> 14:50.080
 in positive ways.

14:50.080 --> 14:51.340
 And in order to do that,

14:51.340 --> 14:53.980
 you need to understand a little bit about the mechanisms

14:53.980 --> 14:57.020
 of how you heat up and how you cool down,

14:57.020 --> 14:59.540
 where the cells and circuits are in the brain and body,

14:59.540 --> 15:01.260
 how those cells and circuits work.

15:01.260 --> 15:02.900
 I promised to make the description of that,

15:02.900 --> 15:04.460
 which follows very clear,

15:04.460 --> 15:07.060
 even if you don't have a background in biology.

15:07.060 --> 15:08.720
 And once you have that in hand,

15:08.720 --> 15:11.220
 along with the understanding you now have

15:11.220 --> 15:13.300
 about the fact that you got a shell and a core,

15:13.300 --> 15:15.660
 and you need to think about both the shell and the core,

15:15.660 --> 15:18.260
 well, then you will be in the best possible position

15:18.260 --> 15:21.160
 to use sauna or hot tub or other tools,

15:21.160 --> 15:22.540
 even just a hot shower,

15:22.540 --> 15:25.920
 as a powerful stimulus to optimize your biology.

15:25.920 --> 15:27.420
 Now, the science of heat and heating,

15:27.420 --> 15:30.140
 and cold and cooling for that matter,

15:30.140 --> 15:32.380
 goes back well over a hundred years.

15:32.380 --> 15:33.860
 In fact, it's kind of amusing to me

15:33.860 --> 15:36.260
 that nowadays there's a kind of renewed interest

15:36.260 --> 15:39.420
 in the use of heat and cold and the science of heat and cold

15:39.420 --> 15:40.680
 because this was the first topic

15:40.680 --> 15:43.020
 that I studied as an undergraduate.

15:43.020 --> 15:46.740
 And in fact, I did my graduate thesis on thermal regulation.

15:46.740 --> 15:47.860
 And at the time,

15:47.860 --> 15:49.920
 thermal regulation wasn't really considered

15:49.920 --> 15:52.180
 one of the hot topics in neuroscience.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.220
 People were more focused on things like memory

15:54.220 --> 15:55.140
 and consciousness,

15:55.140 --> 15:57.900
 and of course those topics are still of vital interest

15:57.900 --> 15:59.520
 to many people in many laboratories.

15:59.520 --> 16:02.380
 But thermal regulation was considered more,

16:02.380 --> 16:04.140
 I think for the physiologists.

16:04.140 --> 16:06.900
 Nowadays, not just on social media,

16:06.900 --> 16:09.880
 not just in the landscape of biohackers and athletes,

16:09.880 --> 16:11.780
 but in the landscape of mental health,

16:11.780 --> 16:16.780
 and frankly in the general ethos around health optimization,

16:16.980 --> 16:19.900
 people are really interested in heat and cold.

16:19.900 --> 16:22.100
 And the reason they're so interested in heat and cold

16:22.100 --> 16:23.980
 is that a lot of the science has been done

16:23.980 --> 16:26.660
 both in animal models in mice and in humans,

16:26.660 --> 16:29.060
 and translates immediately to protocols

16:29.060 --> 16:30.760
 that anyone can use.

16:30.760 --> 16:35.300
 Now, a brief warning now and another brief warning later,

16:35.300 --> 16:38.060
 anytime you're talking about heating up your body,

16:38.060 --> 16:41.540
 you need to be very cautious because unlike cooling down

16:41.540 --> 16:44.380
 where you have a fairly broad range of cold temperatures

16:44.380 --> 16:47.220
 that you can go into before it's damaging to tissue,

16:47.220 --> 16:50.460
 well, you don't get to heat up the brain and body very much

16:50.460 --> 16:53.780
 before you start getting into the realm of neuron damage.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.820
 And neurons in the central nervous system,

16:55.820 --> 16:56.740
 the brain and spinal cord,

16:56.740 --> 16:59.080
 once they're damaged, they don't come back.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.320
 So hyperthermia is a serious thing to avoid.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.960
 Later, I'll talk about ways to rapidly protect

17:03.960 --> 17:05.980
 against hyperthermia.

17:05.980 --> 17:09.180
 But I do want to give everybody a cautionary note upfront.

17:09.180 --> 17:11.140
 Obviously, if you're pregnant, nursing,

17:11.140 --> 17:13.380
 if you're very sensitive to hot environments,

17:13.380 --> 17:15.920
 you want to stay out of saunas and things of that sort.

17:15.920 --> 17:17.340
 I'm sure there are exceptions to that.

17:17.340 --> 17:20.020
 You definitely have to talk to your doctor

17:20.020 --> 17:22.660
 if you're going to violate that rule.

17:22.660 --> 17:25.140
 And for everybody, you want to approach

17:25.140 --> 17:28.820
 any kind of tool related to heating very cautiously.

17:28.820 --> 17:30.420
 You always have the opportunity

17:30.420 --> 17:31.640
 to increase the temperature later.

17:31.640 --> 17:33.500
 So proceed with caution, be smart about it.

17:33.500 --> 17:34.900
 I don't just say that to protect me,

17:34.900 --> 17:37.060
 I say that also to protect you.

17:37.060 --> 17:40.860
 So now let's talk about what are the circuits for heating up?

17:40.860 --> 17:42.240
 How does that happen?

17:42.240 --> 17:44.160
 Many of you have probably experienced a fever.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.340
 How does that happen?

17:45.340 --> 17:48.140
 What happens when you go into a cold environment

17:48.140 --> 17:50.940
 and you're shivering, but you put on a coat

17:50.940 --> 17:51.820
 and then you feel warmer?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.380
 What's really going on there?

17:53.380 --> 17:56.100
 Well, there's a very basic circuit,

17:56.100 --> 17:59.740
 meaning neurons that exist in the skin,

17:59.740 --> 18:01.100
 in the brain and in the body

18:01.100 --> 18:02.720
 that communicate with one another,

18:02.720 --> 18:05.340
 that allow you to heat up if you need to

18:05.340 --> 18:06.900
 and cool down if you need to.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.820
 I'm going to throw a little bit of nomenclature,

18:08.820 --> 18:10.180
 a few new words at you.

18:10.180 --> 18:13.420
 You don't need to memorize these words except for one.

18:13.420 --> 18:15.180
 Actually you need to memorize one acronym,

18:15.180 --> 18:16.940
 but it's very easy.

18:16.940 --> 18:18.060
 It's called the POA.

18:18.060 --> 18:19.380
 If you remember POA,

18:19.380 --> 18:21.380
 you'll be home free for the rest of the episode.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.340
 But I know that there are some aficionados out there

18:23.340 --> 18:24.980
 and people interested in getting

18:24.980 --> 18:26.380
 a little bit deeper mechanism.

18:26.380 --> 18:28.300
 And I do think it's important to understand this circuit

18:28.300 --> 18:29.900
 because once you understand this circuit

18:29.900 --> 18:31.660
 and the way it's structured,

18:31.660 --> 18:33.440
 then you are going to be in a great position

18:33.440 --> 18:35.260
 to use the tools related to heating.

18:35.260 --> 18:37.540
 So here's how this circuit is structured.

18:37.540 --> 18:40.300
 You have this shell, which is basically skin.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.380
 And within the skin, you have neurons, nerve cells.

18:43.380 --> 18:47.420
 Those nerve cells have channels or receptors on them.

18:47.420 --> 18:48.620
 They're called trip channels.

18:48.620 --> 18:49.980
 There are some other ones as well,

18:49.980 --> 18:53.260
 which basically sense changes in heat.

18:53.260 --> 18:57.100
 So if I were to put a hot object on your hand or your arm,

18:57.100 --> 18:58.580
 or for instance,

18:58.580 --> 19:00.740
 if I were to put a hot object on your hand or arm

19:00.740 --> 19:03.480
 and then remove that hot object,

19:03.480 --> 19:05.200
 those neurons would respond to that.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.780
 They would send electrical signals into your spinal cord.

19:07.780 --> 19:10.740
 And that's where the next station of this circuit resides.

19:10.740 --> 19:13.860
 In your spinal cord, you've got a little cluster of neurons

19:13.860 --> 19:16.420
 that exists at the top part of your spinal cord

19:16.420 --> 19:18.100
 called the dorsal horn.

19:18.100 --> 19:19.300
 The name again doesn't matter.

19:19.300 --> 19:22.580
 And those neurons specifically relay heat information

19:22.580 --> 19:24.080
 up to another area of your brain.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.980
 Now here's where we get into some fancy names.

19:25.980 --> 19:29.320
 It's the lateral parabrachial area.

19:29.320 --> 19:31.360
 You don't need to know lateral parabrachial area,

19:31.360 --> 19:32.780
 but it's a relay station.

19:32.780 --> 19:36.200
 The lateral parabrachial area sends electrical signals

19:36.200 --> 19:37.460
 to the POA.

19:37.460 --> 19:38.940
 And I would like you to know POA.

19:38.940 --> 19:41.800
 The POA stands for preoptic area.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.720
 Neurons in the preoptic area

19:43.720 --> 19:45.940
 basically reside over the roof of your mouth.

19:45.940 --> 19:48.640
 These are neurons within the hypothalamus.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.620
 And neurons in the preoptic area

19:51.620 --> 19:54.540
 have the ability to send signals

19:54.540 --> 19:56.340
 out to the rest of your brain and body

19:56.340 --> 19:57.580
 to get you to heat up

19:57.580 --> 20:02.180
 and actually to change your behavior so that you heat up.

20:02.180 --> 20:03.540
 That's right.

20:03.540 --> 20:07.500
 If neurons in the preoptic area receive an electrical signal

20:07.500 --> 20:08.900
 through the circuit I just described

20:08.900 --> 20:11.780
 that goes from skin to dorsal horn in the spinal cord

20:11.780 --> 20:13.620
 to lateral parabrachial,

20:14.580 --> 20:16.440
 they will start sending signals

20:16.440 --> 20:18.380
 out to the organs of your body

20:18.380 --> 20:19.400
 and the tissues of your body

20:19.400 --> 20:21.580
 to get those organs and tissues to do things.

20:21.580 --> 20:22.820
 And believe it or not,

20:22.820 --> 20:25.880
 your POA, your preoptic area will actually change the way

20:25.880 --> 20:28.920
 that you think and feel immediately.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.060
 For instance,

20:30.060 --> 20:33.860
 if something warm contacts your skin

20:33.860 --> 20:36.000
 or something very hot contacts your skin,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.780
 the preoptic area will send signals

20:38.780 --> 20:42.300
 out to the endothelial cells,

20:42.300 --> 20:45.700
 the blood vessels, both of the brain and body

20:45.700 --> 20:47.820
 that get them to dilate, right?

20:47.820 --> 20:50.300
 To essentially increase their volume

20:50.300 --> 20:53.260
 and their surface area in order to cast off heat.

20:54.140 --> 20:56.340
 You will also start sweating.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.660
 That sweating response is initiated

20:58.660 --> 21:01.420
 not by the hot day or the hot sun,

21:01.420 --> 21:04.500
 but by the preoptic area neurons that send signals

21:04.500 --> 21:07.180
 out to what's called the periphery of your body

21:07.180 --> 21:08.620
 and other chemicals are released,

21:08.620 --> 21:11.580
 things like acetylcholine that get you to sweat.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.760
 And if you happen to be shivering,

21:15.760 --> 21:18.340
 neurons in the preoptic area will make sure

21:18.340 --> 21:19.940
 that you stop shivering.

21:21.140 --> 21:23.100
 You're probably familiar with the feeling

21:23.100 --> 21:24.580
 of being somewhat lethargic

21:24.580 --> 21:27.140
 or spreading out your limbs on a hot day.

21:27.140 --> 21:31.380
 Well, that is the result of neurons in your preoptic area

21:31.380 --> 21:33.500
 impacting your musculature

21:33.500 --> 21:36.020
 to get you to increase your surface area

21:36.020 --> 21:39.300
 so you can sweat off or release more heat.

21:39.300 --> 21:40.900
 So there are all these different mechanisms

21:40.900 --> 21:43.060
 by which we dump heat.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.160
 Some of those are purely physiological,

21:46.160 --> 21:49.960
 below our conscious control, things like sweating,

21:49.960 --> 21:53.280
 which you can't just make yourself sweat on demand.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.320
 Maybe you can through a set of stressful thoughts,

21:55.320 --> 21:57.700
 but you can't just make yourself sweat.

21:57.700 --> 22:01.020
 That is autonomic, it's below your conscious control.

22:01.020 --> 22:02.760
 Things like vasodilation,

22:02.760 --> 22:06.660
 the dilation of your veins in particular

22:06.660 --> 22:09.380
 and capillaries in particular, these sorts of things.

22:09.380 --> 22:11.760
 And of course, there are these behavioral,

22:11.760 --> 22:15.000
 somewhat voluntary aspects of dumping heat.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.380
 And the lethargy, the kind of tiredness

22:17.380 --> 22:19.400
 that we feel on a really hot day,

22:19.400 --> 22:21.040
 that's also controlled by this circuit

22:21.040 --> 22:22.280
 that I just described.

22:22.280 --> 22:24.780
 In fact, I just got back from a visit

22:24.780 --> 22:26.740
 to a very warm place.

22:26.740 --> 22:28.580
 And it was remarkable to me

22:28.580 --> 22:30.740
 how lethargic I felt in the afternoons.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.740
 I just felt like a total slug.

22:32.740 --> 22:36.780
 I just could not move or rally to do anything,

22:36.780 --> 22:39.540
 except if I waited until the evening,

22:39.540 --> 22:41.260
 even though it was later in the day,

22:41.260 --> 22:43.020
 even though I hadn't napped,

22:43.020 --> 22:45.100
 as the temperature in my environment cooled off,

22:45.100 --> 22:46.740
 as my body temperature cooled off,

22:46.740 --> 22:47.820
 I felt like I had more energy.

22:47.820 --> 22:48.900
 I was actually waking up

22:48.900 --> 22:50.940
 even though I had been awake for longer.

22:50.940 --> 22:53.420
 So the relationship between temperature and lethargy

22:53.420 --> 22:55.580
 is a very intimate one.

22:55.580 --> 22:58.060
 If we're warm enough, we feel active

22:58.060 --> 22:59.720
 and like we want to move around.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.680
 If we're too warm, we feel like we need to stay put

23:02.680 --> 23:05.180
 and spread out our limbs and dump heat.

23:05.180 --> 23:07.620
 And that brings me to a quick and kind of fun point

23:07.620 --> 23:10.700
 about how we dump heat versus how other animals dump heat.

23:10.700 --> 23:14.500
 Many of you know, of course, that we dump heat by sweating.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.980
 Other mechanisms as well, some of which I described,

23:16.980 --> 23:19.420
 but that's our main way of dumping heat.

23:19.420 --> 23:22.380
 Other animals like dogs don't have the capacity to sweat,

23:22.380 --> 23:23.540
 at least not very much.

23:23.540 --> 23:26.780
 So they pant, right, in order to dump heat.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.060
 And still other animals like rodents,

23:29.060 --> 23:32.160
 when they get too hot, they spit on their paws

23:32.160 --> 23:35.020
 and they rub that spit on the surface of their body,

23:35.020 --> 23:36.160
 which might sound kind of gross

23:36.160 --> 23:37.460
 and probably will get you to think twice

23:37.460 --> 23:38.900
 before petting any of those animals

23:38.900 --> 23:40.780
 or holding any of those animals again,

23:40.780 --> 23:42.660
 unless that's your thing.

23:42.660 --> 23:44.280
 Now, one other key thing to understand

23:44.280 --> 23:46.460
 about this circuit related to heat

23:46.460 --> 23:47.900
 is that the preoptic area

23:47.900 --> 23:51.140
 also can send electrical signals to the amygdala,

23:51.140 --> 23:53.940
 a brain area that is often talked about

23:53.940 --> 23:55.500
 in the context of fear,

23:55.500 --> 23:57.420
 but is really just a brain area

23:57.420 --> 24:00.060
 that can activate your sympathetic nervous system.

24:00.060 --> 24:01.860
 The sympathetic nervous system

24:01.860 --> 24:04.100
 is part of your autonomic nervous system

24:04.100 --> 24:06.340
 and is the one associated with fight or flight

24:06.340 --> 24:08.140
 or with the stress response,

24:08.140 --> 24:10.320
 or even just the excited response, right?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.420
 The sympathetic nervous system is also what gets activated

24:12.420 --> 24:14.160
 when you're really excited about something.

24:14.160 --> 24:17.000
 The preoptic area has the opportunity

24:17.000 --> 24:19.760
 to trigger the activation of the amygdala.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.140
 Now it doesn't do it every time, but it can.

24:22.140 --> 24:23.260
 And it tends to do that

24:23.260 --> 24:26.940
 when you are suddenly in an environment that feels too hot,

24:26.940 --> 24:30.080
 that you feel is risky levels of hot.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.180
 If you ever have gotten into a sauna

24:32.180 --> 24:35.640
 that was very, very hot, maybe 210 degrees Fahrenheit,

24:35.640 --> 24:37.520
 you sit there for a minute,

24:37.520 --> 24:39.560
 you'll notice that your heart rate increases

24:39.560 --> 24:40.400
 and there are reasons for that

24:40.400 --> 24:42.260
 and we'll talk about some of the health benefits of that

24:42.260 --> 24:46.320
 in a few minutes, but it's pretty uncomfortable.

24:46.320 --> 24:48.660
 You may not feel like your skin is going to burn up,

24:48.660 --> 24:51.620
 but you often will feel the impulse to get out,

24:51.620 --> 24:53.860
 especially if you stay in there for a little while.

24:53.860 --> 24:57.840
 That impulse is the consequence of this preoptic area

24:57.840 --> 24:59.460
 communicating with your amygdala saying,

24:59.460 --> 25:01.120
 hey, this environment is really hot

25:01.120 --> 25:03.460
 and I'm trying to cool down and it's not really working.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.480
 I'm dumping heat, but I'm not able to adjust

25:06.480 --> 25:07.860
 the core of my body temperature

25:07.860 --> 25:09.740
 in ways that are going to protect my neurons.

25:09.740 --> 25:12.300
 And so it's a signal that you probably shouldn't stay

25:12.300 --> 25:13.820
 in that environment too long.

25:13.820 --> 25:15.300
 Now later we'll talk about the advantage

25:15.300 --> 25:16.660
 of pushing yourself a little bit

25:16.660 --> 25:18.540
 through some of these very hot environments

25:18.540 --> 25:20.160
 provided you can do it safely,

25:20.160 --> 25:22.780
 but the impulse to get yourself out

25:22.780 --> 25:25.820
 of a very hot environment is the consequence

25:25.820 --> 25:28.660
 of the POA communicating with your amygdala

25:28.660 --> 25:31.660
 and the amygdala then in turn activating your adrenal glands

25:31.660 --> 25:33.580
 which sit right above your kidneys,

25:33.580 --> 25:36.460
 the release of adrenaline and this feeling of agitation

25:36.460 --> 25:37.560
 like you want to move.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.140
 Usually you want to move out

25:39.140 --> 25:41.420
 of whatever hot environment you happen to be in.

25:41.420 --> 25:42.820
 So now you know the circuit.

25:42.820 --> 25:43.660
 Again, it's simple.

25:43.660 --> 25:45.600
 It goes from skin to spinal cord,

25:45.600 --> 25:47.580
 one brain area to another brain area.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.300
 That's the key one in this discussion,

25:49.300 --> 25:51.380
 which is the POA, the preoptic area.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.700
 And the preoptic area can kick off a bunch

25:53.700 --> 25:57.580
 of autonomic subconscious responses to heat,

25:57.580 --> 26:00.020
 which make us attempt to get cooler,

26:00.020 --> 26:02.340
 things like sweating, vasodilation, et cetera.

26:02.340 --> 26:05.140
 And it can kick off behavioral responses,

26:05.140 --> 26:06.740
 spreading out our limbs in an attempt

26:06.740 --> 26:08.820
 to dump even more heat, feeling lethargic.

26:08.820 --> 26:11.980
 So a lack of desire to run and move.

26:11.980 --> 26:15.540
 And it also has the opportunity to kick off a mild

26:15.540 --> 26:17.900
 or maybe not so mild panic response to get us

26:17.900 --> 26:19.500
 out of that hot environment.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.300
 If you can conceptualize that circuit,

26:21.300 --> 26:23.680
 or if you can even just understand what I just said,

26:23.680 --> 26:25.700
 even at a top contour level,

26:25.700 --> 26:27.060
 you're going to be in a great position

26:27.060 --> 26:28.980
 to understand the rest of the information

26:28.980 --> 26:30.460
 and the tools that follow.

26:30.460 --> 26:32.340
 Next, I'd like to talk about the use

26:32.340 --> 26:35.000
 of deliberate heat exposure, including sauna,

26:35.000 --> 26:37.380
 but other tools as well,

26:37.380 --> 26:39.840
 as a way to understand how heat

26:39.840 --> 26:42.700
 and heating changes our biology.

26:42.700 --> 26:44.380
 So you're going to learn some mechanism

26:44.380 --> 26:46.080
 and you're going to learn some tools.

26:46.080 --> 26:48.140
 But first I'd like to just emphasize

26:48.140 --> 26:50.660
 that the use of deliberate heat exposure

26:50.660 --> 26:55.100
 can be a very powerful way to improve health and longevity.

26:55.100 --> 26:59.120
 There's a wonderful study on this that was published in 2018

26:59.120 --> 27:02.300
 that includes a lot of data from a lot of participants

27:02.300 --> 27:03.980
 in a lot of different conditions.

27:03.980 --> 27:05.940
 For instance, people that only did sauna once

27:05.940 --> 27:07.420
 versus two to three times a week

27:07.420 --> 27:09.580
 versus four to seven times a week and so on,

27:09.580 --> 27:11.140
 and compares all those.

27:11.140 --> 27:13.360
 The title of the study is sauna bathing

27:13.360 --> 27:16.520
 is associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality

27:16.520 --> 27:19.600
 and improves risk prediction in men and women,

27:19.600 --> 27:22.060
 a prospective cohort study.

27:22.060 --> 27:26.140
 This is one of several papers that clearly demonstrate

27:26.140 --> 27:28.140
 that regular use of sauna

27:28.140 --> 27:31.060
 or other forms of deliberate heat exposure

27:31.060 --> 27:34.000
 can reduce mortality to cardiovascular events,

27:34.000 --> 27:37.380
 but also to other events, things like stroke

27:37.380 --> 27:40.800
 and other things that basically can kill us.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.220
 What I like so much about this and the related studies

27:43.220 --> 27:46.340
 and yes, I will provide a link to these in the show notes

27:46.340 --> 27:48.620
 is that they involve a lot of participants.

27:48.620 --> 27:50.180
 So for instance, in this particular paper,

27:50.180 --> 27:52.120
 which was published in BMC medicine,

27:53.300 --> 27:58.300
 they looked at a sample of 1,688 participants

27:58.620 --> 28:00.260
 who had a mean age of 63,

28:00.260 --> 28:03.380
 but there was a range of ages around 63

28:03.380 --> 28:07.220
 and of whom 51.4% were women, the rest were men.

28:07.220 --> 28:09.220
 So it's a pretty nicely varied study

28:09.220 --> 28:12.180
 in terms of the populations that they looked at.

28:12.180 --> 28:15.260
 And basically what they found was the more often

28:15.260 --> 28:18.940
 that people do sauna, the better their health is

28:18.940 --> 28:22.060
 and the lower the likelihood they will die

28:22.060 --> 28:24.300
 from some sort of cardiovascular event.

28:24.300 --> 28:25.740
 Now, what do we mean by sauna?

28:25.740 --> 28:28.660
 We need to define some of the parameters around sauna

28:28.660 --> 28:32.140
 and I promise to provide you some alternative ways

28:32.140 --> 28:34.100
 to access some of the health benefits

28:34.100 --> 28:36.580
 that were observed in this and related studies

28:36.580 --> 28:38.220
 without the need to have a sauna

28:38.220 --> 28:39.980
 because I do realize that a lot of people

28:39.980 --> 28:42.180
 don't have access to sauna.

28:42.180 --> 28:44.460
 First off, the temperature ranges that were used

28:44.460 --> 28:46.760
 in this study and pretty much all the studies

28:46.760 --> 28:49.860
 that I'm going to talk about unless I say otherwise

28:49.860 --> 28:51.940
 are between 80 degrees Celsius,

28:51.940 --> 28:56.940
 meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit and 100 degrees Celsius,

28:57.260 --> 29:00.260
 meaning 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

29:00.260 --> 29:02.260
 So somewhere in that range,

29:02.260 --> 29:04.180
 how hot should you make the sauna

29:04.180 --> 29:05.780
 or the environment that you get into

29:05.780 --> 29:07.860
 should you decide to use these tools?

29:07.860 --> 29:11.420
 Well, that will depend on your tolerance for heat,

29:11.420 --> 29:13.100
 how heat adapted you are.

29:13.100 --> 29:15.500
 Yes, some people are better at sweating than others

29:15.500 --> 29:17.560
 and over time, we all get better at sweating.

29:17.560 --> 29:19.440
 Meaning if you go into the sauna more frequently,

29:19.440 --> 29:21.740
 you become a better sweater.

29:21.740 --> 29:24.260
 Not a sweater you wear, but the verb, sweater.

29:24.260 --> 29:26.500
 You get better at sweating, at dumping heat

29:26.500 --> 29:28.580
 through the loss of water.

29:28.580 --> 29:29.900
 So it's going to depend.

29:29.900 --> 29:31.980
 I recommend starting on the lower end

29:31.980 --> 29:34.640
 of the temperature scale and if that's too hot for you,

29:34.640 --> 29:36.620
 that you even lower the temperature further.

29:36.620 --> 29:39.340
 Now, how long were people exposing themselves

29:39.340 --> 29:40.640
 to these hot environments?

29:41.580 --> 29:45.300
 Anywhere from five to 20 minutes per session.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.700
 And as you'll soon learn,

29:46.700 --> 29:49.740
 very brief periods of just five minutes of heat exposure

29:49.740 --> 29:53.380
 can be a powerful stimulus if the heat exposure

29:53.380 --> 29:58.320
 is significantly great enough for you, okay?

29:58.320 --> 30:00.220
 20 minutes can also be beneficial,

30:00.220 --> 30:03.500
 but 80 to 100 degrees Celsius,

30:03.500 --> 30:07.260
 meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit

30:07.260 --> 30:10.560
 is the general range that this and most studies use.

30:11.460 --> 30:14.000
 In this particular study, they compare the effects

30:14.000 --> 30:16.620
 of people that did sauna once a week,

30:16.620 --> 30:19.980
 two or three times per week or four to seven times per week.

30:19.980 --> 30:22.380
 And what they saw was really remarkable.

30:22.380 --> 30:25.100
 What they observed was that people who went into the sauna

30:25.100 --> 30:29.600
 two or three times per week were 27% less likely

30:29.600 --> 30:31.540
 to die of a cardiovascular event

30:31.540 --> 30:33.900
 than people that went into the sauna just once a week.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.180
 Again, at the temperature levels

30:36.180 --> 30:38.540
 and the duration that I talked about earlier.

30:38.540 --> 30:39.500
 And as you can imagine,

30:39.500 --> 30:42.780
 the duration and the temperature levels were related.

30:42.780 --> 30:44.980
 So if people went into very hot environments

30:44.980 --> 30:46.180
 that were really uncomfortable for them,

30:46.180 --> 30:47.840
 maybe they only went in for five minutes.

30:47.840 --> 30:50.940
 Whereas if they were more comfortable and heat adapted

30:50.940 --> 30:53.260
 in a given environment or their tolerance for heat

30:53.260 --> 30:55.580
 was just simply higher for whatever reason,

30:55.580 --> 30:57.720
 well, then they tended to stay in longer.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.540
 We can take a sort of average of this five

30:59.540 --> 31:00.620
 to 20 minute range.

31:00.620 --> 31:03.360
 And today we're mainly going to talk about exposures

31:03.360 --> 31:07.460
 between 10 and 20 minutes at temperatures between,

31:07.460 --> 31:09.540
 again, 80 degrees and 100 degrees Celsius,

31:09.540 --> 31:13.140
 176 degrees Fahrenheit or 212 degrees Fahrenheit.

31:13.140 --> 31:15.420
 So these data point to the fact that going in the sauna

31:15.420 --> 31:17.240
 two or three times per week is really beneficial

31:17.240 --> 31:20.620
 and can lower mortality to cardiovascular events.

31:20.620 --> 31:22.220
 And in fact, the benefits were even greater

31:22.220 --> 31:23.660
 for people that were going into the sauna

31:23.660 --> 31:25.660
 four to seven times per week.

31:25.660 --> 31:28.700
 Those people were 50% less likely to die

31:28.700 --> 31:30.900
 of a cardiovascular event compared to people

31:30.900 --> 31:33.400
 that went into the sauna just once a week.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.820
 So these are really impressive

31:34.820 --> 31:37.220
 and frankly encouraging studies.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.260
 Certainly they caught my eye and encouraged me

31:39.260 --> 31:43.680
 to start using deliberate heat exposure on a regular basis.

31:43.680 --> 31:45.500
 What's particularly nice about this study

31:45.500 --> 31:49.640
 and the related study that again is linked in the show notes

31:49.640 --> 31:51.480
 is that they looked at a number

31:51.480 --> 31:53.620
 of potentially confounding variables,

31:53.620 --> 31:55.500
 things like whether or not people smoked,

31:55.500 --> 31:57.180
 things like whether or not people were overweight,

31:57.180 --> 32:00.380
 whether or not they tended to exercise or not exercise,

32:00.380 --> 32:03.060
 and they were able to separate out those variables.

32:03.060 --> 32:05.100
 So the percentages that I described earlier,

32:05.100 --> 32:09.260
 27% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event

32:09.260 --> 32:11.560
 for those that went in the sauna two to three times a week

32:11.560 --> 32:13.820
 and 50% less likely to die of a cardiovascular event

32:13.820 --> 32:16.060
 for those that went into the sauna four times per week

32:16.060 --> 32:17.940
 as compared to just once a week.

32:17.940 --> 32:21.020
 Those effects really do seem to be the consequence

32:21.020 --> 32:24.020
 of the sauna exposure and not some other effect

32:24.020 --> 32:25.740
 that's correlated with sauna exposure,

32:25.740 --> 32:28.780
 like going to the gym where people are working out

32:28.780 --> 32:30.180
 seven times a week and then also happen

32:30.180 --> 32:31.240
 to get into the sauna,

32:31.240 --> 32:33.180
 or quitting smoking right about the same time

32:33.180 --> 32:36.340
 they adopt a sauna protocol, these sorts of things.

32:36.340 --> 32:38.480
 And now there have been additional analyses

32:38.480 --> 32:40.700
 of the use of sauna for improving health,

32:40.700 --> 32:43.980
 or I should say for offsetting mortality

32:43.980 --> 32:46.660
 that have found that it's not just reductions

32:46.660 --> 32:47.820
 in cardiovascular events,

32:47.820 --> 32:50.220
 but so-called all cause mortality.

32:50.220 --> 32:52.440
 This is kind of medical geek speak.

32:52.440 --> 32:56.100
 We're saying, how likely are you or somebody to die

32:56.100 --> 32:57.980
 from a cardiovascular event,

32:57.980 --> 33:00.880
 but maybe also from some other event,

33:00.880 --> 33:02.260
 some other health-related event,

33:02.260 --> 33:04.340
 like cancer or something of that sort.

33:04.340 --> 33:07.380
 And in every case, regular exposure to sauna,

33:07.380 --> 33:09.760
 starting at about two or three times per week,

33:09.760 --> 33:12.060
 all the way up to seven times per week,

33:12.060 --> 33:13.500
 greatly improves,

33:13.500 --> 33:18.020
 meaning statistically significant improvements in longevity

33:18.020 --> 33:21.460
 in the sense that people are less likely to die

33:21.460 --> 33:25.320
 of cardiovascular events and other things that kill us.

33:25.320 --> 33:27.260
 So I and many other people who are interested,

33:27.260 --> 33:28.380
 not just in our own health,

33:28.380 --> 33:31.340
 but in educating about health-related tools

33:31.340 --> 33:34.460
 to the general public, find this really exciting.

33:34.460 --> 33:39.380
 But knowing what we know about how heat impacts our biology,

33:39.380 --> 33:41.860
 it probably shouldn't surprise us

33:41.860 --> 33:44.980
 that this sauna-type exposure or deliberate heat exposure

33:44.980 --> 33:46.620
 has these incredible effects.

33:46.620 --> 33:49.020
 So before we get into the biological mechanisms

33:49.020 --> 33:52.660
 of how heat can have all these impressive health effects,

33:52.660 --> 33:56.900
 I want to just talk about the use of sauna as a tool

33:56.900 --> 34:00.220
 and emphasize that you don't have to use a sauna

34:00.220 --> 34:02.060
 in order to get these benefits.

34:02.060 --> 34:04.620
 It is simply a matter of making sure

34:04.620 --> 34:09.620
 that your shell and your core heat up properly a bit,

34:10.500 --> 34:13.660
 not too much, not too little, but that you heat those up.

34:13.660 --> 34:16.540
 And no, you do not need to carry a thermometer around

34:16.540 --> 34:19.380
 or place a thermometer into your core.

34:19.380 --> 34:22.060
 You know, in laboratory studies and in humans,

34:22.060 --> 34:24.100
 if you really want to know someone's core temperature,

34:24.100 --> 34:25.740
 basically you try and put the thermal probe

34:25.740 --> 34:26.900
 as close to the core as you can.

34:26.900 --> 34:30.020
 So typically that's done rectally or a mouth thermometer

34:30.020 --> 34:31.480
 or even up the nose.

34:31.480 --> 34:33.220
 You don't need to do any of that, all right?

34:33.220 --> 34:34.620
 This isn't a laboratory study.

34:34.620 --> 34:37.700
 There are ways to create a hot environment

34:37.700 --> 34:41.060
 such that you heat up your shell and your core safely

34:41.060 --> 34:44.180
 without having to measure your core temperature all along.

34:44.180 --> 34:46.820
 If you want to do that, be my guest,

34:46.820 --> 34:49.160
 but I'm not going to provide a protocol.

34:49.160 --> 34:51.600
 So the question is, how are you heating up your environment?

34:51.600 --> 34:54.340
 And I realized that there are dry saunas,

34:54.340 --> 34:57.660
 there are steam saunas, there are infrared saunas,

34:57.660 --> 35:01.180
 there are hot tubs, and there are simply rooms

35:01.180 --> 35:03.980
 that you crank up the heat, okay?

35:03.980 --> 35:06.720
 There are also ways in which you can increase your shell

35:06.720 --> 35:09.360
 and your core temperature by moving around a lot

35:09.360 --> 35:11.480
 and doing that wearing a lot of clothing.

35:11.480 --> 35:14.760
 There's nothing special about any one

35:14.760 --> 35:17.060
 of these approaches or protocols.

35:17.060 --> 35:19.760
 It's just so happens that sauna is one

35:19.760 --> 35:21.640
 of the more convenient ways to do this.

35:21.640 --> 35:24.320
 And certainly for the studies that I've talked about,

35:24.320 --> 35:25.740
 not just the ones I referenced before,

35:25.740 --> 35:27.560
 but all the studies that I researched

35:27.560 --> 35:29.080
 looking at this episode,

35:29.080 --> 35:30.740
 it makes sense why they would use sauna

35:30.740 --> 35:32.840
 because it's very hard, for instance,

35:32.840 --> 35:37.040
 to create conditions where you have five people go out

35:37.040 --> 35:39.280
 jogging, wearing heavy sweaters and hats,

35:39.280 --> 35:41.040
 wool hats on the middle of summer.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.800
 It's very hard to set up those conditions

35:42.800 --> 35:44.440
 in a way that's controlled for everybody,

35:44.440 --> 35:46.500
 whereas it's pretty straightforward to have a sauna

35:46.500 --> 35:48.440
 where you have one or several people just get

35:48.440 --> 35:51.200
 into that one uniformly hot environment.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.880
 That's a much easier study to run.

35:53.880 --> 35:58.240
 So just to be clear, the temperature range is important.

35:58.240 --> 36:00.620
 You want to get between 80 and 100 degrees Celsius.

36:00.620 --> 36:02.880
 Now you know the conversion to Fahrenheit.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.920
 You could, however, immerse yourself in a hot tub

36:06.920 --> 36:08.860
 or hot water bath up to your neck.

36:08.860 --> 36:10.600
 That's another way to approach it.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.920
 If you didn't have access to either of those,

36:12.920 --> 36:17.920
 you could also put on a hoodie or a wool hat and a hoodie,

36:19.600 --> 36:21.400
 or you could do like the wrestlers do,

36:21.400 --> 36:24.140
 and you could actually buy one of these plastic suits.

36:24.140 --> 36:27.060
 They're literally called plastics that wrestlers

36:27.060 --> 36:29.420
 or other athletes that wish to drop water weight will wear

36:29.420 --> 36:30.560
 and then go jogging in that.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.080
 All of those will increase your shell

36:32.080 --> 36:33.480
 and your core body temperature, right?

36:33.480 --> 36:34.600
 Especially if you do it on a hot day,

36:34.600 --> 36:36.560
 but of course, be careful, hydrate and don't overheat,

36:36.560 --> 36:38.480
 don't become excessively hyperthermic

36:38.480 --> 36:42.220
 because you can get heat stroke and you can potentially die.

36:42.220 --> 36:44.840
 But if you're going to use sauna,

36:44.840 --> 36:47.220
 often I get the question, how hot should the sauna be?

36:47.220 --> 36:48.060
 Well, now you know.

36:48.060 --> 36:48.920
 How long should you be in there?

36:48.920 --> 36:51.240
 Five to 20 minutes per session.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.280
 Although I will talk in a minute about ways

36:53.280 --> 36:54.840
 to optimize hormone output,

36:54.840 --> 36:56.180
 in particular growth hormone output

36:56.180 --> 36:59.680
 by doing four very brief sessions.

36:59.680 --> 37:01.040
 So maybe not a continuous session.

37:01.040 --> 37:02.560
 We'll get into that in a few minutes.

37:02.560 --> 37:05.020
 And of course you have to ask yourself wet sauna, dry sauna.

37:05.020 --> 37:05.860
 You know what?

37:05.860 --> 37:06.680
 Doesn't matter.

37:06.680 --> 37:08.120
 Use what you prefer.

37:08.120 --> 37:11.240
 Many people ask me, well, what about infrared sauna?

37:11.240 --> 37:13.460
 We have an entire episode all about the use of light

37:13.460 --> 37:17.640
 and low level light therapy, including infrared light.

37:17.640 --> 37:20.900
 It does have certain benefits for skin and other organs

37:20.900 --> 37:23.800
 and tissues of the body if used properly.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.280
 My understanding, or at least my assessment

37:26.280 --> 37:28.520
 of most infrared saunas out there

37:28.520 --> 37:30.640
 is that they don't get hot enough.

37:30.640 --> 37:34.480
 They don't get up to that 80 to 100 degrees Celsius range.

37:34.480 --> 37:36.700
 Some do, most don't.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.580
 So what you end up with is a situation

37:38.580 --> 37:39.880
 where you've got a red light,

37:39.880 --> 37:42.120
 low level light therapy stimulus,

37:42.120 --> 37:44.900
 and you've got a sauna that's not quite hot enough.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.560
 And there are a lot of ideas and claims

37:46.560 --> 37:48.440
 about how they work together

37:48.440 --> 37:50.440
 in order to get you improved benefits.

37:51.600 --> 37:53.160
 I personally am of the stance

37:53.160 --> 37:54.720
 based on the literature that I've read

37:54.720 --> 37:57.440
 that you want to get into those ranges

37:57.440 --> 38:00.000
 of an 80 to 100 degrees Celsius

38:00.000 --> 38:02.080
 before you start considering whether or not

38:02.080 --> 38:04.680
 you're also going to include red light therapies, et cetera.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.620
 So there's nothing special about red light sauna.

38:07.620 --> 38:10.120
 It's really the temperature of the sauna

38:10.120 --> 38:11.200
 that you happen to get into.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.800
 So which tool, right?

38:12.800 --> 38:14.520
 Which sauna, which stimulus?

38:14.520 --> 38:17.360
 Do you run in wearing plastics and a hoodie and a wool hat?

38:17.360 --> 38:18.180
 Do you get into a sauna?

38:18.180 --> 38:20.160
 That's going to depend a lot on your circumstances,

38:20.160 --> 38:22.860
 your budget, and what you have access to on a regular basis.

38:22.860 --> 38:26.320
 This is a lot like our discussion about the use of cold.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.880
 Most of the studies have looked at immersion in cold water

38:29.880 --> 38:32.040
 up to the neck because that's a very controlled situation

38:32.040 --> 38:33.620
 that you can do in a laboratory.

38:33.620 --> 38:36.720
 They have not explored cold showers as much,

38:36.720 --> 38:37.760
 so there's just less data

38:37.760 --> 38:39.620
 or walking around in a cold environment.

38:39.620 --> 38:42.240
 But we'll talk a little bit about those data

38:42.240 --> 38:44.320
 because as you'll soon learn, when you talk about cold,

38:44.320 --> 38:46.600
 you're actually talking about heating as well.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.800
 So what kind of mechanisms are activated

38:48.800 --> 38:50.520
 in your brain and body that allow

38:50.520 --> 38:54.040
 for the various health benefits of sauna

38:54.040 --> 38:57.300
 or other forms of deliberate heating?

38:57.300 --> 39:00.260
 Well, we talked about reduced risk

39:00.260 --> 39:02.360
 of cardiovascular event-related mortality

39:02.360 --> 39:04.320
 and all-cause mortality.

39:04.320 --> 39:08.220
 As you'll soon learn, there are also tremendous benefits

39:08.220 --> 39:10.400
 in terms of increases in growth hormone,

39:10.400 --> 39:12.340
 reductions in cortisol, et cetera.

39:12.340 --> 39:13.600
 I will detail those.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.340
 So what happens when you get into a hot environment?

39:16.340 --> 39:17.700
 What are the mechanisms that allow

39:17.700 --> 39:20.060
 for the various health effects of that?

39:20.060 --> 39:24.980
 Well, your shell, your skin senses that,

39:24.980 --> 39:27.200
 and through the circuit that I described earlier,

39:27.200 --> 39:30.260
 activates neurons in the POA, the preoptic area,

39:30.260 --> 39:32.400
 which in turn activates mechanisms

39:32.400 --> 39:35.100
 in your autonomic nervous system like vasodilation.

39:35.100 --> 39:38.180
 So blood flow increases, plasma volume

39:38.180 --> 39:41.240
 of your blood increases, and stroke volume.

39:41.240 --> 39:44.560
 The volume of blood that is mobilized

39:44.560 --> 39:47.120
 with each beat of your heart also increases.

39:47.120 --> 39:49.960
 And your heart rate increases to anywhere

39:49.960 --> 39:52.980
 between 100 to 150 beats per minute.

39:52.980 --> 39:55.880
 That general constellation of effects looks

39:55.880 --> 39:58.640
 a lot like cardiovascular exercise.

39:58.640 --> 40:01.520
 And in fact, for all intents and purposes,

40:01.520 --> 40:03.940
 it really is cardiovascular exercise,

40:03.940 --> 40:06.560
 except that there isn't the mobilization

40:06.560 --> 40:09.580
 and the loading of joints and limbs and things of that sort.

40:09.580 --> 40:11.200
 And of course, there are additional benefits

40:11.200 --> 40:13.820
 of cardiovascular exercise that relate

40:13.820 --> 40:17.460
 to impact on the ground, improvements in bone density,

40:17.460 --> 40:18.800
 et cetera, et cetera.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.640
 But basically your heart starts beating,

40:20.640 --> 40:22.980
 more blood starts circulating,

40:22.980 --> 40:24.980
 your vasculature changes shape literally

40:24.980 --> 40:27.860
 to accommodate those increases in heart rate

40:27.860 --> 40:29.420
 and blood volume.

40:29.420 --> 40:31.980
 And you're basically getting a cardiovascular workout

40:31.980 --> 40:35.540
 in that hot environment, even if you're just sitting down.

40:35.540 --> 40:37.380
 Another set of positive effects related

40:37.380 --> 40:42.020
 to being in these hot environments are hormone effects.

40:42.020 --> 40:43.980
 Shifts in the output of hormones,

40:43.980 --> 40:47.500
 both from your adrenals and possibly from the testes

40:47.500 --> 40:49.880
 and ovaries, and even within the brain.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.880
 One of the more striking examples of that comes

40:52.880 --> 40:56.620
 from a study that was published in 2021.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.140
 The title of the study is endocrine effects

40:59.140 --> 41:00.660
 of repeated hot thermal stress

41:00.660 --> 41:03.620
 and cold water immersion in young adult men.

41:03.620 --> 41:06.260
 And indeed the study was in this case, just done on men.

41:06.260 --> 41:09.140
 I'll just briefly describe the protocol they use.

41:09.140 --> 41:11.760
 They had these men attend four sauna sessions

41:11.760 --> 41:13.380
 of 12 minutes each.

41:13.380 --> 41:15.780
 So again, well within that range of five to 20 minutes,

41:15.780 --> 41:18.740
 12 minutes, the temperature of those saunas

41:18.740 --> 41:21.460
 was 90 to 91 degrees Celsius.

41:21.460 --> 41:24.120
 So I'll just quickly do the calculation,

41:24.120 --> 41:25.260
 admittedly not in my head.

41:25.260 --> 41:27.980
 That's 194 degrees Fahrenheit.

41:27.980 --> 41:31.140
 And they did that four times.

41:31.140 --> 41:33.820
 Afterwards, they had a six minute cool down break

41:33.820 --> 41:36.600
 during which they did get into some cool water

41:36.600 --> 41:39.140
 or cold water of about 10 degrees,

41:39.140 --> 41:43.900
 which is 10 degrees Celsius is 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

41:43.900 --> 41:46.020
 And then they measured hormones at various times

41:46.020 --> 41:48.780
 throughout this study, before, during and after.

41:48.780 --> 41:51.860
 They looked at testosterone, they looked at DHEA,

41:51.860 --> 41:53.980
 which is in the androgen pathway.

41:53.980 --> 41:57.140
 They looked at prolactin and they looked at cortisol.

41:57.140 --> 41:59.180
 The significant effects of the protocol

41:59.180 --> 42:01.980
 that I just described were on cortisol,

42:01.980 --> 42:04.340
 a so-called stress hormone.

42:04.340 --> 42:06.220
 So-called because when we are very stressed

42:06.220 --> 42:07.260
 for long periods of time,

42:07.260 --> 42:09.740
 cortisol levels tend to increase dramatically.

42:09.740 --> 42:14.440
 But I should point out that a increase in cortisol each day

42:14.440 --> 42:15.820
 right about the time of waking

42:15.820 --> 42:17.600
 and specifically right about the time of waking

42:17.600 --> 42:19.920
 is actually beneficial for our alertness and our energy.

42:19.920 --> 42:23.280
 So having some increase in cortisol every 24 hours

42:23.280 --> 42:26.460
 is a good thing provided it happens early in the day.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.500
 Late day increases in cortisol

42:28.500 --> 42:30.300
 are associated with depression.

42:30.300 --> 42:33.460
 That's been shown by studies at Stanford and elsewhere.

42:33.460 --> 42:36.180
 The major effect of this study is a significant decrease

42:36.180 --> 42:38.980
 in cortisol output in these subjects.

42:39.980 --> 42:41.780
 I think this is really interesting and important

42:41.780 --> 42:44.260
 because many people suffer from acute,

42:44.260 --> 42:46.340
 meaning immediate and long-term stress

42:46.340 --> 42:49.140
 and are looking for ways to control their stress.

42:49.140 --> 42:51.540
 Controlling your cortisol is tricky.

42:51.540 --> 42:53.740
 In the episode on stress, I talked about supplements

42:53.740 --> 42:56.900
 such as ashwagandha that can be used to limit cortisol,

42:56.900 --> 42:59.120
 but you have to be careful not to use ashwagandha

42:59.120 --> 43:00.900
 for extended periods of time,

43:00.900 --> 43:02.300
 meaning for longer than two weeks,

43:02.300 --> 43:04.380
 because you can get into other issues.

43:04.380 --> 43:06.680
 I talk about breathwork protocols that can allow you

43:06.680 --> 43:09.980
 to clamp or reduce the stress response in real time.

43:09.980 --> 43:11.580
 Again, see that episode for those.

43:11.580 --> 43:14.540
 But many people are overworked, they're overstressed.

43:14.540 --> 43:16.640
 They're, for one reason or another,

43:16.640 --> 43:19.260
 they're subjected to many, too many stressors

43:19.260 --> 43:22.400
 or their level of stress resilience isn't high enough

43:22.400 --> 43:25.440
 to keep their cortisol levels clamped at a healthy level.

43:25.440 --> 43:29.020
 So the protocol I described of 12 minute exposures

43:29.020 --> 43:33.180
 to 90 degree environment, that's again, 90 degrees Celsius,

43:33.180 --> 43:37.340
 followed by a six minute cool down break in cool water,

43:37.340 --> 43:40.280
 50 degrees or so, that's pretty cold.

43:40.280 --> 43:42.580
 I can imagine that you could also just take a cool shower

43:42.580 --> 43:43.980
 or a cold shower afterwards.

43:43.980 --> 43:47.100
 That had a very significant effect on lowering cortisol.

43:47.100 --> 43:49.940
 So there you have a tool, it's not a completely zero cost

43:49.940 --> 43:51.180
 tool because you need to heat the water,

43:51.180 --> 43:53.000
 you need to have access to hot and cold water,

43:53.000 --> 43:55.800
 at least hot and cold contrast of some sort,

43:55.800 --> 43:59.060
 but it's fairly minimal cost for most people,

43:59.060 --> 44:00.700
 especially if you start getting creative

44:00.700 --> 44:03.140
 about maybe taking a 12 minute jog,

44:03.140 --> 44:05.060
 wearing a lot of clothing, if it's hot out,

44:05.060 --> 44:06.620
 then getting into a cool shower,

44:06.620 --> 44:10.500
 you might not get the same extreme or significant reduction

44:10.500 --> 44:11.820
 in cortisol that was observed here

44:11.820 --> 44:13.420
 with these very specific protocols,

44:13.420 --> 44:14.740
 but it's likely that you would get

44:14.740 --> 44:17.000
 a similar result overall.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.300
 Now, I mentioned they did look at these other hormones

44:19.300 --> 44:21.180
 and I'll just tell you that they did not see

44:21.180 --> 44:22.780
 significant shifts in testosterone,

44:22.780 --> 44:26.200
 prolactin, DHEA, et cetera, using this protocol.

44:26.200 --> 44:28.220
 As you'll soon see, there are other sauna protocols

44:28.220 --> 44:30.220
 that can impact those other hormones.

44:30.220 --> 44:32.580
 So if you're seeking to use sauna to reduce stress,

44:32.580 --> 44:34.740
 I think this is a very interesting

44:34.740 --> 44:37.300
 and potentially useful research backed protocol.

44:37.300 --> 44:39.940
 And again, we will provide a link to the paper

44:39.940 --> 44:42.420
 if you'd like to read more about the data.

44:42.420 --> 44:45.940
 So that is one set of biological effects on cortisol

44:45.940 --> 44:48.540
 and the related protocol.

44:48.540 --> 44:50.660
 What about some of the other benefits of sauna?

44:50.660 --> 44:51.700
 Well, we'll talk about those,

44:51.700 --> 44:53.980
 but I want to talk about those in the context

44:53.980 --> 44:56.140
 of the underlying mechanisms,

44:56.140 --> 44:58.140
 because if you understand those underlying mechanisms,

44:58.140 --> 45:00.820
 you can really tailor your sauna protocols

45:00.820 --> 45:02.620
 for your particular needs.

45:02.620 --> 45:04.860
 One of the more dramatic and important effects

45:04.860 --> 45:09.160
 of going into a hot environment for some period of time

45:09.160 --> 45:13.300
 is the activation of so-called heat shock proteins or HSPs.

45:13.300 --> 45:15.820
 Heat shock proteins are a protective mechanism

45:15.820 --> 45:19.820
 in your brain and body to rescue proteins

45:19.820 --> 45:21.780
 that would otherwise misfold.

45:21.780 --> 45:22.620
 Now, what do I mean by this?

45:22.620 --> 45:25.560
 Well, most of you are familiar with the fact

45:25.560 --> 45:27.620
 that you have protein in the kitchen,

45:27.620 --> 45:29.900
 like a steak or a piece of chicken or a piece of fish,

45:29.900 --> 45:33.660
 and you heat it up, it changes its texture, right?

45:33.660 --> 45:36.060
 Raw meat is different than cooked meat,

45:36.060 --> 45:37.660
 to be quite blunt about it.

45:39.100 --> 45:42.620
 Heat changes the quality of proteins,

45:42.620 --> 45:43.880
 not just in terms of how they taste,

45:43.880 --> 45:46.620
 but the way in which they are configured.

45:46.620 --> 45:48.980
 It changes it right down at the molecular level.

45:49.940 --> 45:53.500
 When your body goes through changes in temperature each day,

45:53.500 --> 45:54.700
 and we'll talk about those changes,

45:54.700 --> 45:57.940
 but in response to hot environments or cold environments,

45:57.940 --> 46:01.740
 heat shock proteins are deployed to go and rescue

46:01.740 --> 46:04.080
 and prevent the changes in proteins

46:04.080 --> 46:06.260
 that would be detrimental to your health.

46:06.260 --> 46:08.140
 So at least in the short term,

46:09.060 --> 46:11.200
 activating heat shock proteins is a good thing.

46:11.200 --> 46:13.220
 You don't want heat shock proteins to be activated

46:13.220 --> 46:14.460
 for long periods of time,

46:14.460 --> 46:17.240
 because that gets to be problematic for other reasons.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.620
 But these heat shock proteins,

46:18.620 --> 46:20.220
 of which there are many varieties,

46:20.220 --> 46:23.460
 basically have the job of traveling in your brain and body

46:23.460 --> 46:27.060
 and making sure that cells that contain proteins

46:27.060 --> 46:30.860
 that are misfolding because they got heated up too much,

46:30.860 --> 46:32.300
 don't misfold.

46:32.300 --> 46:35.020
 And they also serve a protective mechanism,

46:35.020 --> 46:37.360
 making sure that proteins within the cells

46:37.360 --> 46:41.260
 of your brain and body don't fold in the wrong ways.

46:41.260 --> 46:43.480
 Again, I'm describing this in very general terms,

46:43.480 --> 46:47.420
 but it's well-established in animal models and in humans

46:47.420 --> 46:50.700
 that sauna exposure of the sort that I described earlier

46:50.700 --> 46:52.740
 activates these heat shock proteins.

46:52.740 --> 46:54.700
 There's some interesting studies that were carried out

46:54.700 --> 46:59.340
 in animal models that really nicely mechanistically support

46:59.340 --> 47:02.420
 the role of heat shock proteins in some of the benefits

47:02.420 --> 47:04.320
 of deliberate heat exposure.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.940
 Some of these studies were done in flies,

47:06.940 --> 47:08.300
 meaning Drosophila fruit flies,

47:08.300 --> 47:10.100
 because they're a great model organism

47:10.100 --> 47:13.380
 because you can delete genes or add genes easily.

47:13.380 --> 47:14.660
 Other studies have been done in mice.

47:14.660 --> 47:17.420
 And now there are also studies being carried out in humans.

47:17.420 --> 47:18.680
 And I will talk about those.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.580
 One of the more dramatic examples

47:20.580 --> 47:22.580
 that's always touted in this field

47:22.580 --> 47:25.500
 of deliberate heat exposure as it relates to longevity

47:25.500 --> 47:29.240
 is that if they expose these flies, these fruit flies,

47:29.240 --> 47:33.620
 to 70 minutes of a heat stimulus

47:33.620 --> 47:35.440
 that obviously didn't kill them,

47:35.440 --> 47:37.280
 but activated heat shock proteins,

47:37.280 --> 47:40.040
 it could extend their life by 15%

47:40.040 --> 47:42.980
 in a heat shock dependent way.

47:42.980 --> 47:44.960
 Meaning if they made flies

47:44.960 --> 47:47.340
 that didn't have these heat shock proteins,

47:47.340 --> 47:50.380
 well, then they didn't see this extension in life.

47:50.380 --> 47:52.300
 And this is one of the reasons to use model organisms.

47:52.300 --> 47:54.980
 This is not an experiment that you could do in people.

47:54.980 --> 47:57.780
 However, there have been interesting studies done in humans

47:57.780 --> 48:00.500
 examining some of the downstream molecular pathways

48:00.500 --> 48:03.700
 of deliberate heat exposure that point to the mechanisms

48:03.700 --> 48:06.500
 by which deliberate heat exposure can help protect

48:06.500 --> 48:08.340
 against different forms of mortality,

48:08.340 --> 48:10.980
 improve health overall, and possibly,

48:10.980 --> 48:15.600
 and I want to highlight possibly, possibly extend life.

48:15.600 --> 48:18.740
 One such mechanism involves a genetic program

48:18.740 --> 48:22.060
 involving a molecule called FOXO3.

48:22.060 --> 48:24.140
 FOXO3 is a very interesting molecule

48:24.140 --> 48:28.580
 because it's involved in DNA repair pathways.

48:28.580 --> 48:32.660
 DNA repair is part of the process of remaining healthy.

48:32.660 --> 48:34.700
 We'd all like to think that we're born

48:34.700 --> 48:36.780
 and based on the genes we have,

48:36.780 --> 48:38.400
 we are healthy, healthy, healthy,

48:38.400 --> 48:40.860
 then eventually we age and then we die.

48:40.860 --> 48:44.100
 But from the time we're born until the time we die,

48:44.100 --> 48:46.960
 there's a constant repair of our proteins and our cells

48:46.960 --> 48:49.780
 and a modification of the genes that are being expressed.

48:49.780 --> 48:52.140
 You know, puberty being the most dramatic example, right?

48:52.140 --> 48:54.500
 You see a kid before puberty and after puberty,

48:54.500 --> 48:56.000
 he looks like a different kid, sounds like a different kid,

48:56.000 --> 48:56.840
 thinks like a different kid,

48:56.840 --> 48:59.460
 in fact, basically is a different human being, right?

48:59.460 --> 49:00.540
 It's not just the hormones,

49:00.540 --> 49:02.940
 it's that hormones themselves have the capacity

49:02.940 --> 49:05.120
 to turn on and turn off certain genes,

49:05.120 --> 49:07.860
 literally converting certain tissues

49:07.860 --> 49:09.160
 and cells in the brain and body

49:09.160 --> 49:10.940
 to do entirely different things.

49:10.940 --> 49:13.820
 So it's not just the sprouting of new aspects

49:13.820 --> 49:16.620
 of our biology, it's literally the conversion

49:16.620 --> 49:20.100
 of different brain centers from one function to another.

49:21.740 --> 49:24.060
 That's puberty and we'll do a whole episode about puberty.

49:24.060 --> 49:25.980
 We actually did an episode on sexual development

49:25.980 --> 49:28.040
 that talks a little bit about those mechanisms,

49:28.040 --> 49:31.280
 but the point is that throughout our entire lifespan,

49:31.280 --> 49:33.900
 genes are being turned on, genes are being turned off,

49:33.900 --> 49:35.580
 genes are being turned on, genes are being turned off,

49:35.580 --> 49:40.580
 and DNA, the stuff of genes gets damaged in that process.

49:41.260 --> 49:46.260
 FOXO3 sits upstream in a pathway related to DNA repair

49:47.080 --> 49:49.500
 and again, clearing of these senescent cells.

49:50.380 --> 49:53.120
 Sauna exposure, in particular,

49:53.120 --> 49:55.260
 sauna exposure two to three times

49:55.260 --> 49:57.700
 or ideally four to seven times per week

49:57.700 --> 50:01.340
 in that 80 to 100 degree Celsius range

50:01.340 --> 50:04.960
 has been shown to upregulate levels of FOXO3.

50:05.860 --> 50:10.360
 FOXO3 in turn upregulates pathways related to DNA repair

50:10.360 --> 50:12.780
 and clearing out of these senescent or dead cells,

50:12.780 --> 50:16.380
 which is known to be important for various aspects

50:16.380 --> 50:17.500
 of maintaining cognition

50:17.500 --> 50:20.420
 and other aspects of maintaining health.

50:20.420 --> 50:23.460
 So these are the likely biological mechanisms

50:23.460 --> 50:27.420
 for the improvements in lifespan

50:27.420 --> 50:29.180
 or I rather, I should say,

50:29.180 --> 50:30.900
 these are the biological mechanisms

50:30.900 --> 50:35.160
 that apparently offset some of the cardiovascular risk

50:35.160 --> 50:38.700
 and other forms of mortality that were described earlier.

50:38.700 --> 50:42.180
 One especially interesting thing about FOXO3,

50:42.180 --> 50:44.380
 there are individuals out there

50:44.380 --> 50:47.660
 that have either additional copies of FOXO3

50:47.660 --> 50:52.380
 or who have versions of FOXO3 that are hyperactive,

50:52.380 --> 50:53.920
 so to speak.

50:53.920 --> 50:58.620
 Those people tend to be 2.7 times more likely

50:58.620 --> 51:01.780
 to live to 100 years of age or longer.

51:01.780 --> 51:03.620
 So these are people that were just naturally,

51:03.620 --> 51:05.020
 and fortunately for them,

51:05.020 --> 51:06.900
 endowed with more FOXO3,

51:06.900 --> 51:08.500
 more clearance of senescent cells,

51:08.500 --> 51:10.420
 more DNA repair, et cetera.

51:10.420 --> 51:13.140
 For the rest of us, at least to my knowledge,

51:13.140 --> 51:15.180
 I don't have one of these

51:15.180 --> 51:17.920
 health-promoting FOXO3 mutations.

51:17.920 --> 51:19.660
 Remember, mutations can be beneficial

51:19.660 --> 51:20.660
 or they can be detrimental.

51:20.660 --> 51:23.180
 This, if your goal is to live longer,

51:23.180 --> 51:25.000
 is a beneficial mutation.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.480
 Well, if you don't have these FOXO3 mutations

51:27.480 --> 51:29.580
 that allow you to be a centenarian

51:29.580 --> 51:34.060
 at 2.7 times higher likelihood than other people,

51:34.060 --> 51:35.820
 deliberate heat exposure is one way

51:35.820 --> 51:38.520
 that you can increase FOXO3 activity.

51:38.520 --> 51:39.940
 At this point in time,

51:39.940 --> 51:42.940
 meaning when looking at the research out there,

51:42.940 --> 51:45.760
 it isn't clear what the optimal SONNA protocol

51:45.760 --> 51:48.340
 is going to be specifically to increase FOXO3,

51:48.340 --> 51:51.300
 and that's probably because there isn't one.

51:51.300 --> 51:53.340
 There is no SONNA protocol designed

51:53.340 --> 51:55.940
 specifically to reduce cortisol

51:55.940 --> 51:58.800
 or specifically to increase FOXO3

51:58.800 --> 52:01.740
 or specifically to activate heat shock proteins.

52:01.740 --> 52:03.740
 Any deliberate heat exposure is likely

52:03.740 --> 52:06.000
 to impact all of those mechanisms.

52:06.000 --> 52:07.940
 Again, I encourage you to use this guide

52:07.940 --> 52:10.740
 of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius

52:10.740 --> 52:14.300
 as your kind of bookends for what you can tolerate

52:14.300 --> 52:18.140
 and where you want to start and eventually transition to

52:18.140 --> 52:19.820
 in terms of deliberate heat exposure.

52:19.820 --> 52:22.060
 And I would encourage you to use

52:22.060 --> 52:26.020
 that five to 20 minutes per session

52:26.020 --> 52:27.900
 for the SONNA as your rough guide

52:27.900 --> 52:29.700
 of how long to remain in the SONNA.

52:29.700 --> 52:32.160
 Now, there was a study published just this last year

52:32.160 --> 52:34.860
 that was mainly focused on deliberate cold exposure.

52:34.860 --> 52:38.980
 I detailed this quite extensively in the episode on cold.

52:38.980 --> 52:42.040
 This is the beautiful work of Susanna Soberg.

52:42.040 --> 52:43.940
 And that study looked at deliberate cold exposure,

52:43.940 --> 52:45.860
 but also SONNA exposure.

52:45.860 --> 52:49.460
 And that study found that 57,

52:49.460 --> 52:53.740
 yes, 57 minutes per week of SONNA exposure

52:53.740 --> 52:57.940
 in conjunction with 11 minutes per week total

52:57.940 --> 53:01.760
 of deliberate cold exposure was the threshold

53:01.760 --> 53:04.720
 for getting improvements in metabolism

53:04.720 --> 53:06.840
 and increases in brown fat,

53:06.840 --> 53:08.760
 this very active fat tissue

53:08.760 --> 53:12.160
 that improves mitochondrial function and thermogenesis,

53:12.160 --> 53:13.020
 meaning heating of the body.

53:13.020 --> 53:14.860
 We'll talk more about the brown fat later.

53:14.860 --> 53:15.740
 Why do I mention this?

53:15.740 --> 53:17.580
 Well, for those of you that are interested

53:17.580 --> 53:19.500
 in increasing metabolism,

53:19.500 --> 53:21.120
 it does seem to be most beneficial

53:21.120 --> 53:24.840
 to do that 11 minutes per week of cold exposure.

53:24.840 --> 53:27.220
 Again, divided up across two or more sessions.

53:27.220 --> 53:29.860
 So it's not 11 minutes all at once, but shorter sessions.

53:29.860 --> 53:34.740
 And to get 57 minutes minimum per week of SONNA exposure,

53:34.740 --> 53:35.940
 again, in the temperature ranges

53:35.940 --> 53:37.460
 that I've talked about here.

53:37.460 --> 53:42.240
 And again, it's not 57 minutes in the SONNA all at once.

53:42.240 --> 53:46.420
 That's 57 minutes total per week as the minimum threshold.

53:46.420 --> 53:49.740
 So you might divide that into three sessions of 20 minutes.

53:49.740 --> 53:53.340
 And again, I don't think 57 is the magic number.

53:53.340 --> 53:57.240
 It could be 60, it could be 64, it probably could be 55.

53:57.240 --> 53:59.200
 Remember your biological systems

53:59.200 --> 54:00.960
 are not counting things off minute by minute,

54:00.960 --> 54:02.900
 second by second, at least not in most cases.

54:02.900 --> 54:04.180
 So for those of you that are interested

54:04.180 --> 54:07.080
 in improving metabolism, check out the episode on cold,

54:07.080 --> 54:10.980
 or just take the SOBERG protocol as I call it,

54:10.980 --> 54:13.320
 which is 11 minutes total per week

54:13.320 --> 54:16.820
 of uncomfortably cold, but safe cold exposure.

54:16.820 --> 54:18.420
 So uncomfortably cold means you really,

54:18.420 --> 54:21.340
 really want to get out of the shower or the ice bath

54:21.340 --> 54:23.140
 or whatever environment, but you can stay in.

54:23.140 --> 54:25.740
 11 minutes total per week divided across a couple of sessions

54:25.740 --> 54:29.660
 and then 57 minutes per week or so

54:29.660 --> 54:31.980
 of deliberate heat exposure.

54:31.980 --> 54:35.540
 Again, uncomfortably, but uncomfortably hot, excuse me,

54:35.540 --> 54:37.260
 but safe to stay in,

54:37.260 --> 54:39.780
 probably divided up across three or more sessions.

54:39.780 --> 54:41.700
 Okay, so we've talked about the use of SONNA

54:41.700 --> 54:43.560
 to decrease cortisol.

54:43.560 --> 54:44.620
 We've talked about the use of SONNA

54:44.620 --> 54:47.120
 to increase heat shock proteins.

54:47.120 --> 54:51.340
 We've talked about the use of SONNA to increase FOXO3.

54:51.340 --> 54:53.180
 Now I'd like to talk about the use of SONNA

54:53.180 --> 54:55.460
 to increase growth hormone.

54:55.460 --> 54:58.520
 Growth hormone is a hormone that we all naturally secrete

54:58.520 --> 54:59.780
 from our pituitary,

54:59.780 --> 55:02.780
 which also resides near the roof of our mouth.

55:02.780 --> 55:06.540
 The signal for the pituitary to release growth hormone

55:06.540 --> 55:10.440
 arrives from neurons that exist in the hypothalamus.

55:10.440 --> 55:13.420
 So growth hormone releasing hormones,

55:13.420 --> 55:14.820
 believe it or not, that's what they're called,

55:14.820 --> 55:17.220
 stimulate the release of growth hormone

55:17.220 --> 55:19.700
 from the anterior pituitary gland

55:19.700 --> 55:21.180
 into the general circulation.

55:21.180 --> 55:24.740
 And then growth hormone impacts metabolism

55:24.740 --> 55:27.540
 and growth of cells and tissues of the body.

55:27.540 --> 55:30.520
 It is responsible for tissue repair as well.

55:30.520 --> 55:33.180
 And the growth spurt that everyone experiences

55:33.180 --> 55:36.520
 during puberty is the consequence of growth hormone.

55:36.520 --> 55:39.320
 What I'm about to describe is a study

55:39.320 --> 55:43.380
 that found dramatic, really dramatic, I should say,

55:43.380 --> 55:45.180
 increases in growth hormone.

55:45.180 --> 55:46.620
 But I also want to emphasize

55:46.620 --> 55:48.380
 that these increases in growth hormone

55:48.380 --> 55:50.800
 were not of the sort that are observed in puberty

55:50.800 --> 55:52.820
 or in infants becoming adolescents

55:52.820 --> 55:55.000
 or adolescents growing into teenagers.

55:55.000 --> 55:56.420
 Those levels of growth hormone

55:56.420 --> 55:59.420
 that are associated with those massive transformations,

55:59.420 --> 56:02.760
 excuse me, of body morphology, of shape,

56:02.760 --> 56:06.260
 are far greater than the sorts that I'm talking about here.

56:06.260 --> 56:10.100
 And yet, as all of us age,

56:10.100 --> 56:13.060
 when we go from adolescence to our teenage years

56:13.060 --> 56:14.500
 and then into young adulthood,

56:14.500 --> 56:17.360
 but then starting in our early 30s or so,

56:17.360 --> 56:19.320
 the amount of growth hormone that we secrete

56:19.320 --> 56:20.640
 is greatly diminished.

56:21.540 --> 56:24.760
 Normally, we would release growth hormone every night

56:24.760 --> 56:25.640
 after we go to sleep,

56:25.640 --> 56:27.640
 in particular in the early part of the night

56:27.640 --> 56:31.560
 when our sleep is comprised mostly of slow wave sleep.

56:31.560 --> 56:34.420
 As we age, less growth hormone is released

56:34.420 --> 56:36.460
 during that slow wave sleep.

56:36.460 --> 56:37.580
 There are various things

56:37.580 --> 56:39.860
 that can promote the release of growth hormone,

56:39.860 --> 56:40.700
 and we will talk about

56:40.700 --> 56:42.580
 some of those other things in a moment.

56:42.580 --> 56:46.540
 Things like low blood sugar, it turns out,

56:46.540 --> 56:50.440
 is a stimulus for growth hormone release.

56:50.440 --> 56:52.700
 And I don't mean hypoglycemia of the sort

56:52.700 --> 56:54.700
 that makes you dizzy and want to pass out, that's bad.

56:54.700 --> 56:56.980
 I mean, not having high levels of glucose

56:56.980 --> 56:58.340
 and insulin in your bloodstream.

56:58.340 --> 56:59.680
 This is one of the reasons

56:59.680 --> 57:02.900
 why many people are drawn to intermittent fasting

57:02.900 --> 57:04.420
 or even prolonged fasting.

57:04.420 --> 57:07.420
 It's because of the reported increases in growth hormone.

57:07.420 --> 57:08.660
 I'll touch on those briefly,

57:08.660 --> 57:10.060
 but if you want to learn more about those

57:10.060 --> 57:13.220
 and what their real impact is

57:13.220 --> 57:14.920
 and the extent of growth hormone,

57:14.920 --> 57:17.140
 check out the episode I did on fasting.

57:17.140 --> 57:19.260
 You can find that at hubermanlab.com.

57:19.260 --> 57:21.400
 Certain forms of exercise have also been shown

57:21.400 --> 57:23.440
 to stimulate growth hormone release.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.280
 And in a few moments,

57:24.280 --> 57:26.780
 I'll talk about how exercise and fasting can be combined

57:26.780 --> 57:29.980
 or how heat can be combined with exercise

57:29.980 --> 57:31.260
 or certain patterns of food intake

57:31.260 --> 57:32.580
 to further increase growth hormone.

57:32.580 --> 57:35.060
 But before I do that, I want to review some of the data

57:35.060 --> 57:38.620
 and one study in particular that discovered

57:38.620 --> 57:41.460
 certain forms of deliberate heat exposure using sauna

57:41.460 --> 57:45.440
 can stimulate very large increases in growth hormone output,

57:45.440 --> 57:48.420
 which for people in their 30s, 40s and beyond

57:48.420 --> 57:50.380
 could be very useful and may also be useful

57:50.380 --> 57:52.140
 for people who are just trying to stimulate

57:52.140 --> 57:54.380
 the release of more growth hormone in order to,

57:54.380 --> 57:57.060
 for instance, recover from exercise or stimulate fat loss

57:57.060 --> 57:59.540
 or muscle growth or repair of a particular injury.

57:59.540 --> 58:02.900
 The title of this paper is endocrine effects

58:02.900 --> 58:04.660
 of repeated sauna bathing.

58:04.660 --> 58:07.380
 And this is a paper that was published in 1986,

58:07.380 --> 58:08.660
 which is some years ago,

58:08.660 --> 58:11.000
 but nonetheless serves as a basis

58:11.000 --> 58:13.600
 for a lot of other studies that followed.

58:13.600 --> 58:16.380
 So let me describe what they did in the study.

58:16.380 --> 58:18.460
 They used an 80 degree Celsius environment.

58:18.460 --> 58:20.660
 So that's 176 degrees Fahrenheit.

58:21.860 --> 58:25.880
 And they had subjects do this sauna for 30 minutes,

58:25.880 --> 58:27.600
 four times per day.

58:27.600 --> 58:30.860
 So that's two hours total in one day,

58:30.860 --> 58:33.500
 30 minutes in the sauna, a period of cool down rest,

58:33.500 --> 58:35.540
 30 minutes in the sauna again, cool down rest,

58:35.540 --> 58:36.980
 a third and a fourth time, okay?

58:36.980 --> 58:41.060
 So two hours total in this 80 degree Celsius environment.

58:41.060 --> 58:42.220
 So that's a lot,

58:42.220 --> 58:45.540
 but what they observed was really quite significant.

58:45.540 --> 58:47.500
 So they had subjects do this protocol

58:47.500 --> 58:49.300
 and I should mention they had both male

58:49.300 --> 58:51.740
 and female subjects in the study.

58:51.740 --> 58:53.620
 And the entire study lasted a week.

58:53.620 --> 58:56.460
 They did this two hours of sauna exposure on day one,

58:56.460 --> 58:59.620
 day three and day seven of that week.

58:59.620 --> 59:02.420
 And they measured a lot of different hormones,

59:02.420 --> 59:05.860
 cortisol, thyroid stimulating hormone,

59:05.860 --> 59:08.820
 thyroid hormone itself, luteinizing hormone

59:08.820 --> 59:10.340
 and follicle stimulating hormone,

59:10.340 --> 59:13.620
 which are hormones that essentially drive

59:13.620 --> 59:15.060
 the production of other hormones.

59:15.060 --> 59:16.580
 We won't get into that too deeply,

59:16.580 --> 59:18.300
 but if you'd like to learn about FSH,

59:18.300 --> 59:20.200
 follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone,

59:20.200 --> 59:23.300
 please see the episode on optimizing testosterone

59:23.300 --> 59:25.460
 and estrogen at hubermanlab.com.

59:25.460 --> 59:29.060
 They looked at prolactin and they looked at growth hormone.

59:29.060 --> 59:31.020
 I'll just cut to the chase and tell you

59:31.020 --> 59:32.520
 the effects on growth hormone.

59:33.860 --> 59:36.000
 In subjects that did this two hour a day,

59:36.000 --> 59:38.860
 80 degree Celsius protocol,

59:38.860 --> 59:43.580
 experienced 16 fold increases in growth hormone.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.740
 So they measured growth hormone before the sauna

59:45.740 --> 59:48.300
 and after the sauna and growth hormone levels

59:48.300 --> 59:52.620
 went up 16 fold, which is obviously an enormous

59:52.620 --> 59:55.980
 and it turns out statistically significant effect.

59:56.900 --> 59:59.820
 Now, one important caveat here.

59:59.820 --> 1:00:03.380
 Remember earlier when I talked about people who did sauna

1:00:03.380 --> 1:00:05.660
 once a week versus two to three times a week

1:00:05.660 --> 1:00:07.200
 versus four to seven times a week.

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:09.400
 And the more often people did sauna,

1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:12.180
 the less likely they were to die of cardiovascular events

1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:13.880
 or other things of that sort.

1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:16.740
 Well, in this case, the effects of sauna exposure

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:19.860
 on growth hormone actually went down

1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:22.420
 the more often that people

1:00:22.420 --> 1:00:24.300
 did this deliberate heat exposure.

1:00:24.300 --> 1:00:26.660
 So as I mentioned, they did this two hour a day

1:00:26.660 --> 1:00:29.380
 dividing the 30 minute sessions protocol on day one,

1:00:29.380 --> 1:00:33.020
 day three and day seven of a week.

1:00:33.020 --> 1:00:35.140
 And what they found was on day one,

1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:38.300
 there was a 16 fold increase in growth hormone.

1:00:38.300 --> 1:00:39.660
 On day three however,

1:00:39.660 --> 1:00:42.780
 there was still a significant effect on growth hormone

1:00:42.780 --> 1:00:44.740
 as compared to before sauna,

1:00:44.740 --> 1:00:49.380
 but that effect was basically cut by two thirds.

1:00:49.380 --> 1:00:52.000
 So now instead of getting a 16 fold increase,

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.940
 it was more like a three or four fold increase,

1:00:54.940 --> 1:00:56.740
 which is still a huge increase,

1:00:56.740 --> 1:00:59.660
 but not as great as the increase observed on day one.

1:00:59.660 --> 1:01:02.680
 And then on day seven, there tended to be a two,

1:01:02.680 --> 1:01:05.140
 maybe a three fold increase,

1:01:05.140 --> 1:01:08.000
 but not as great as the one observed on day one.

1:01:09.220 --> 1:01:11.060
 What does this mean and why does this happen?

1:01:11.060 --> 1:01:15.420
 Well, the reason this happens is because heat,

1:01:15.420 --> 1:01:20.420
 just like cold is a shock or a stressor to the system.

1:01:21.200 --> 1:01:22.580
 In the context of cold,

1:01:22.580 --> 1:01:25.860
 if you get into a very cold ice bath, for instance,

1:01:25.860 --> 1:01:29.540
 a five degree ice bath, even for 20 seconds,

1:01:29.540 --> 1:01:33.580
 it's known to increase norepinephrine 200%.

1:01:33.580 --> 1:01:35.500
 It can double the amount of norepinephrine

1:01:35.500 --> 1:01:37.660
 that you suddenly release into your brain and body,

1:01:37.660 --> 1:01:39.260
 which actually can have some positive effects.

1:01:39.260 --> 1:01:41.380
 I'll talk about those in a little bit.

1:01:41.380 --> 1:01:43.820
 But if you were to do that every day,

1:01:43.820 --> 1:01:45.800
 you become cold adapted.

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:50.240
 This circuit that compares the shell and core of your body

1:01:50.240 --> 1:01:54.180
 would adjust in ways that it could either predict

1:01:54.180 --> 1:01:56.960
 that cold stimulus or more likely to create

1:01:56.960 --> 1:02:00.380
 some thermogenic mechanisms in preparation

1:02:00.380 --> 1:02:02.420
 for that cold exposure.

1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:03.820
 This is why, for instance,

1:02:03.820 --> 1:02:05.500
 people that use deliberate cold exposure

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:08.100
 to try and increase lipolysis, the burning of fat,

1:02:08.100 --> 1:02:09.720
 oftentimes will get results for a while,

1:02:09.720 --> 1:02:11.300
 but then if they're doing it a lot, a lot,

1:02:11.300 --> 1:02:13.120
 they stop getting those effects.

1:02:13.120 --> 1:02:15.340
 I talk a lot about avoiding cold adaptation

1:02:15.340 --> 1:02:18.400
 if that's your goal in the episode on cold,

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:20.840
 but similar mechanisms are at play here.

1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:22.880
 So we have to imagine that when these subjects

1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:24.180
 got into the sauna on day one,

1:02:24.180 --> 1:02:27.400
 whatever pathways went from measurement of temperature

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:30.620
 at the shell to changes in temperature at the core

1:02:30.620 --> 1:02:32.700
 led to these big increases in growth hormone,

1:02:32.700 --> 1:02:34.580
 which is basically a way of just describing the result

1:02:34.580 --> 1:02:36.220
 I already told you before.

1:02:36.220 --> 1:02:38.860
 But the fact that that result diminished over time

1:02:38.860 --> 1:02:41.140
 either means that the circuit was not as efficient

1:02:41.140 --> 1:02:43.700
 in communicating that shift in temperature

1:02:43.700 --> 1:02:46.620
 or that that shift in temperature was of less impact

1:02:46.620 --> 1:02:49.220
 because the downstream effectors

1:02:49.220 --> 1:02:51.140
 were not engaged to the same extent

1:02:51.140 --> 1:02:52.860
 because it wasn't as much of a shock.

1:02:52.860 --> 1:02:55.060
 And I think the latter explanation is far more likely.

1:02:55.060 --> 1:02:57.740
 This is very much akin to weight training

1:02:57.740 --> 1:02:59.180
 or cardiovascular exercise,

1:02:59.180 --> 1:03:01.700
 where if you run up a hill very fast, for instance,

1:03:01.700 --> 1:03:03.080
 and your lungs are burning

1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:05.300
 and you're heaving and breathing hard,

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:07.820
 on the first day, that's a very painful thing.

1:03:07.820 --> 1:03:09.940
 But if you do it every day or every other day,

1:03:09.940 --> 1:03:11.540
 provide you allow yourself to recover,

1:03:11.540 --> 1:03:12.720
 pretty soon you're running up that hill

1:03:12.720 --> 1:03:14.420
 and you're not breathing as hard.

1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:16.620
 There isn't much burning in your muscles,

1:03:16.620 --> 1:03:18.000
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.340
 Your body adapts.

1:03:19.340 --> 1:03:21.580
 So one of the key things to understand

1:03:21.580 --> 1:03:23.700
 about the use of deliberate heat exposure

1:03:23.700 --> 1:03:25.900
 is if you're going to use it in order to try

1:03:25.900 --> 1:03:28.340
 and trigger massive increases in growth hormone,

1:03:28.340 --> 1:03:29.540
 you're going to need to be careful

1:03:29.540 --> 1:03:32.400
 about not doing it more than let's say once a week.

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:34.420
 Now I'm extrapolating from this study,

1:03:34.420 --> 1:03:36.900
 maybe once every 10 days would be even better.

1:03:36.900 --> 1:03:39.640
 But if you start getting heat adapted,

1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:42.060
 it's very unlikely that you're going to get

1:03:42.060 --> 1:03:44.460
 these massive increases in growth hormone.

1:03:44.460 --> 1:03:45.880
 So I don't mean to be discouraging

1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:47.380
 of using deliberate heat exposure

1:03:47.380 --> 1:03:49.640
 to access growth hormone increases,

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:52.920
 but if that's your specific goal or your main goal,

1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:55.240
 then I think it's reasonable to say

1:03:55.240 --> 1:03:57.380
 that you don't want to do deliberate heat exposure,

1:03:57.380 --> 1:03:59.480
 at least not of the sort that I described here,

1:03:59.480 --> 1:04:02.140
 more than once a week, or maybe even once every 10 days.

1:04:02.140 --> 1:04:03.540
 And that you would want to time that

1:04:03.540 --> 1:04:04.860
 to other events in your life,

1:04:04.860 --> 1:04:06.340
 maybe hard workouts,

1:04:06.340 --> 1:04:10.380
 or if you're trying to push through a fat loss barrier,

1:04:10.380 --> 1:04:14.020
 or simply in order to access growth hormone at peak levels,

1:04:14.020 --> 1:04:17.160
 maybe three times per month or four times per month.

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:19.540
 If you start doing deliberate heat exposure more often,

1:04:19.540 --> 1:04:21.660
 you'll still get increases in growth hormone,

1:04:21.660 --> 1:04:24.140
 but they are not going to be nearly as large

1:04:24.140 --> 1:04:25.940
 as the increases in growth hormone

1:04:25.940 --> 1:04:27.460
 that you're going to experience

1:04:27.460 --> 1:04:31.180
 if you shock your system with deliberate heat exposure

1:04:31.180 --> 1:04:32.620
 every once in a while.

1:04:32.620 --> 1:04:34.520
 An important way to frame this

1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:36.160
 is actually in the context of cold.

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:37.340
 And while you might say, wait,

1:04:37.340 --> 1:04:39.820
 this is an episode on heat and heating, not cold.

1:04:39.820 --> 1:04:41.980
 You really can't have a conversation about heat and heating

1:04:41.980 --> 1:04:43.640
 without talking about cold,

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:45.780
 because as I mentioned earlier,

1:04:45.780 --> 1:04:48.400
 if you cool the outside of your body, the shell,

1:04:48.400 --> 1:04:50.020
 you're actually heating up your body.

1:04:50.020 --> 1:04:52.620
 In fact, the circuits that control heating of the body

1:04:52.620 --> 1:04:55.100
 and that control cooling of the body,

1:04:55.100 --> 1:04:57.340
 for instance, the activation of things like shiver

1:04:57.340 --> 1:04:59.880
 or fat loss in response to cold and shiver,

1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:02.260
 those are also controlled by the preoptic area

1:05:02.260 --> 1:05:03.980
 of the hypothalamus.

1:05:03.980 --> 1:05:06.940
 So we can take a step back and start to think about

1:05:06.940 --> 1:05:10.220
 what it would take to design the optimal protocol

1:05:10.220 --> 1:05:13.300
 for deliberate heat exposure by looking at cold.

1:05:13.300 --> 1:05:14.500
 And here's what I mean.

1:05:15.420 --> 1:05:16.740
 There have been beautiful studies showing

1:05:16.740 --> 1:05:20.500
 that if people get into a very cold body of water,

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:22.380
 four degrees Celsius for 20 seconds,

1:05:22.380 --> 1:05:23.220
 as I mentioned earlier,

1:05:23.220 --> 1:05:28.060
 that will cause a 200 to 300% increase in norepinephrine.

1:05:28.060 --> 1:05:30.380
 Norepinephrine is also called noradrenaline

1:05:30.380 --> 1:05:33.060
 and norepinephrine and other so-called catecholamines

1:05:33.060 --> 1:05:35.540
 like dopamine increase dramatically

1:05:35.540 --> 1:05:37.900
 in this very brief cold water exposure.

1:05:37.900 --> 1:05:40.260
 And those increases in norepinephrine and dopamine

1:05:40.260 --> 1:05:43.240
 are known to have long lasting effects

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:46.540
 that generally to improvements in mood, focus and alertness.

1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:47.980
 They're pretty significant.

1:05:47.980 --> 1:05:50.200
 However, they aren't significant enough

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:53.100
 to increase metabolism to a very high degree.

1:05:53.100 --> 1:05:57.020
 Whereas other studies have shown that if people go outside

1:05:57.020 --> 1:06:01.260
 in 16 degrees Celsius weather with a proper amount,

1:06:01.260 --> 1:06:03.940
 but a fairly minimum amount of clothing,

1:06:03.940 --> 1:06:07.580
 you can experience even greater increases in norepinephrine.

1:06:07.580 --> 1:06:09.460
 But the time that's required

1:06:09.460 --> 1:06:11.420
 in order to experience those increases

1:06:11.420 --> 1:06:15.400
 is six hours at, for instance, 16 degrees Celsius.

1:06:15.400 --> 1:06:17.580
 So if you have six hours a day to be out there in the cold,

1:06:17.580 --> 1:06:19.100
 or if you're going to turn the air conditioning on

1:06:19.100 --> 1:06:21.420
 in an environment, make it very, very cold, fine.

1:06:21.420 --> 1:06:22.700
 But basically what I'm describing

1:06:22.700 --> 1:06:25.320
 is that you can sort of bookend the parameters

1:06:25.320 --> 1:06:26.160
 that you can use.

1:06:26.160 --> 1:06:29.480
 You can use a very brief exposure to cold or to heat

1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:31.220
 in order to stimulate heat shock proteins,

1:06:31.220 --> 1:06:32.580
 growth hormone, et cetera.

1:06:32.580 --> 1:06:34.380
 Or you can use longer exposure

1:06:34.380 --> 1:06:38.260
 in less intense versions of heat and cold.

1:06:38.260 --> 1:06:39.820
 You really have to find what's going to work for you

1:06:39.820 --> 1:06:41.460
 and what you can do safely.

1:06:41.460 --> 1:06:44.240
 And if you're confused about where to start,

1:06:44.240 --> 1:06:46.580
 please use the parameters that I described earlier.

1:06:46.580 --> 1:06:48.760
 First of all, check with your doctor as always,

1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:50.140
 make sure that you're somebody

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:52.700
 who can do deliberate cold or heat exposure safely.

1:06:52.700 --> 1:06:55.740
 But that 80 to 100 degrees Celsius,

1:06:55.740 --> 1:06:58.700
 meaning 176 degrees Fahrenheit to 212 degrees Fahrenheit

1:06:58.700 --> 1:06:59.940
 I keep repeating over and over

1:06:59.940 --> 1:07:01.140
 because I know somebody is going to ask

1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:03.220
 even though I repeat it over and over, which is fine.

1:07:03.220 --> 1:07:05.780
 I'm delighted to keep saying it

1:07:05.780 --> 1:07:07.540
 and to respond if someone asks again.

1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:09.940
 Well, those parameters are going to kind of bookend

1:07:09.940 --> 1:07:12.180
 what you should do in terms of the intensity

1:07:12.180 --> 1:07:13.700
 of the heat stimulus.

1:07:13.700 --> 1:07:14.540
 How long?

1:07:14.540 --> 1:07:16.180
 Well, we heard earlier, five to 20 minutes.

1:07:16.180 --> 1:07:19.780
 Why not start with five and then ramp it up to 10 or 15?

1:07:19.780 --> 1:07:21.820
 And then if you're feeling really bold

1:07:21.820 --> 1:07:23.500
 and you really want to crank out growth hormone,

1:07:23.500 --> 1:07:25.040
 well then you could do that 30 minute,

1:07:25.040 --> 1:07:27.980
 four times in one day stimulus every once in a while.

1:07:27.980 --> 1:07:28.980
 So you have to really figure out

1:07:28.980 --> 1:07:31.900
 what you're using heat exposure for.

1:07:31.900 --> 1:07:34.020
 This is one of the reasons why when people say,

1:07:34.020 --> 1:07:36.220
 is it better to get in a wet sauna or dry sauna?

1:07:36.220 --> 1:07:38.160
 What's the optimal temperature?

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:40.100
 Is it better to take a hot shower or a hot bath

1:07:40.100 --> 1:07:40.940
 or a hot tub?

1:07:40.940 --> 1:07:42.020
 To be completely honest,

1:07:42.020 --> 1:07:44.640
 it depends on what you're going to be able to do regularly,

1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:46.100
 whether or not you want to do it regularly

1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:47.560
 and what your specific goals are.

1:07:47.560 --> 1:07:49.660
 So the purpose of this episode is really to arm you

1:07:49.660 --> 1:07:50.980
 with the underlying mechanisms

1:07:50.980 --> 1:07:52.920
 and to arm you with the general parameters

1:07:52.920 --> 1:07:54.900
 that are going to allow you to access the results

1:07:54.900 --> 1:07:55.740
 that you're seeking.

1:07:55.740 --> 1:07:58.220
 For what it's worth, I personally use a protocol

1:07:58.220 --> 1:08:00.140
 and I've been using a protocol for a long time

1:08:00.140 --> 1:08:03.540
 that involves trying, meaning I accomplish this most weeks,

1:08:03.540 --> 1:08:06.380
 not all, trying to get into a sauna

1:08:06.380 --> 1:08:10.140
 for three 20 minute sessions every week.

1:08:10.140 --> 1:08:13.260
 I use a dry sauna, so it's not a steam room.

1:08:13.260 --> 1:08:14.420
 If I don't have access to it,

1:08:14.420 --> 1:08:16.200
 I might take a hot bath or something of that sort.

1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:18.220
 But in general, I just stick to doing the sauna

1:08:18.220 --> 1:08:19.780
 three times a week.

1:08:19.780 --> 1:08:23.400
 And I generally will do that either after a workout,

1:08:23.400 --> 1:08:26.100
 either a cardiovascular workout or a weight workout,

1:08:26.100 --> 1:08:28.260
 or I'll do it later in the evening.

1:08:28.260 --> 1:08:29.900
 Why later in the evening?

1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:33.140
 Well, it has to do with the circadian shifts in temperature

1:08:33.140 --> 1:08:34.820
 that we all experience.

1:08:34.820 --> 1:08:37.620
 Talked a lot about this in the circadian episodes

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:38.860
 and the episodes related to sleep,

1:08:38.860 --> 1:08:41.160
 but in a nutshell, here's how it works.

1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:43.780
 Every early morning,

1:08:43.780 --> 1:08:47.620
 about two hours before your typical wake-up time,

1:08:47.620 --> 1:08:50.820
 your body temperature is at its all time lowest.

1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:53.220
 Okay, we call that your temperature minimum.

1:08:53.220 --> 1:08:55.420
 Right about waking, your body temperature increases.

1:08:55.420 --> 1:08:56.860
 In fact, an increase in body temperature

1:08:56.860 --> 1:08:59.300
 is part of the reason you wake up at all,

1:08:59.300 --> 1:09:01.400
 unless of course you're setting an alarm.

1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:04.420
 Increases in body temperature are going to be

1:09:04.420 --> 1:09:08.340
 one of the major things that wakes up your brain and body.

1:09:08.340 --> 1:09:10.160
 Body temperature will tend to continue

1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:11.580
 to increase through the morning.

1:09:11.580 --> 1:09:12.980
 You'll get that increase in cortisol,

1:09:12.980 --> 1:09:14.900
 that's a healthy increase in cortisol.

1:09:14.900 --> 1:09:17.020
 Body temperature will increase into the afternoon

1:09:17.020 --> 1:09:20.220
 and then will start to drop in the later afternoon.

1:09:20.220 --> 1:09:22.160
 This general contour can be shifted

1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:23.540
 by whether or not you exercise,

1:09:23.540 --> 1:09:24.540
 how often you eat

1:09:24.540 --> 1:09:27.060
 because of the so-called thermogenic effects of food.

1:09:27.060 --> 1:09:28.140
 That is every time you eat,

1:09:28.140 --> 1:09:30.580
 there's a slight increase in body temperature and metabolism,

1:09:30.580 --> 1:09:32.960
 but it's not really that significant

1:09:32.960 --> 1:09:35.560
 to throw off this general contour and rhythm.

1:09:35.560 --> 1:09:38.000
 But toward the afternoon, around four or five o'clock,

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:39.740
 most days, depending on time of year,

1:09:39.740 --> 1:09:41.140
 your body temperature will peak

1:09:41.140 --> 1:09:42.660
 and then it will start to drop.

1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:45.220
 And as your body temperature drops by one to three degrees,

1:09:45.220 --> 1:09:47.060
 and here I'm referring to your core body temperature,

1:09:47.060 --> 1:09:49.280
 not your shell body temperature,

1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:50.700
 you will start to get sleepy

1:09:50.700 --> 1:09:52.560
 and to transition into sleep

1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:55.300
 and to maintain sleep throughout the night,

1:09:55.300 --> 1:09:57.060
 your body temperature will remain low

1:09:57.060 --> 1:09:58.220
 until you hit that temperature minimum

1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:00.560
 and then it'll start to come up again, okay?

1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:04.540
 What that means is that when you decide to do sauna

1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:07.620
 or cold exposure for that matter is going to be important.

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:08.460
 Why?

1:10:08.460 --> 1:10:09.780
 Well, as I mentioned earlier,

1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:11.860
 if you were to make the surface of your body cold,

1:10:11.860 --> 1:10:14.580
 at least in the immediate period after that,

1:10:14.580 --> 1:10:16.880
 your body temperature will increase.

1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:18.860
 So for those of you that are challenged

1:10:18.860 --> 1:10:21.860
 in getting to sleep and are still working on your sleep,

1:10:21.860 --> 1:10:23.160
 remember, sleep is the foundation

1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:25.660
 of all mental and physical health and optimal performance.

1:10:25.660 --> 1:10:28.020
 You should try to get really quality sleep

1:10:28.020 --> 1:10:30.420
 of sufficient duration at least 80% of nights.

1:10:30.420 --> 1:10:32.860
 That should be an ongoing goal throughout your lifespan

1:10:32.860 --> 1:10:34.540
 for a huge number of reasons.

1:10:35.620 --> 1:10:36.960
 Watch the master sleep episode

1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:38.300
 if you'd like to hear more of those reasons

1:10:38.300 --> 1:10:40.340
 and the mechanisms to make sure that you do that.

1:10:40.340 --> 1:10:44.500
 But in any event, cold exposure late in the evening

1:10:44.500 --> 1:10:48.260
 will start to increase your body temperature again.

1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:50.460
 And that can make it hard for some people to fall asleep.

1:10:50.460 --> 1:10:52.380
 Now, if you're very, very tired

1:10:52.380 --> 1:10:53.980
 because you've been working hard or training hard

1:10:53.980 --> 1:10:55.320
 or both throughout the day,

1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:57.500
 might not throw off your sleep so much.

1:10:57.500 --> 1:10:59.660
 I've gone through bouts where I'm just so, so busy

1:10:59.660 --> 1:11:00.500
 from morning till night

1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:02.420
 that the only time I can get into the ice bath

1:11:02.420 --> 1:11:03.840
 or the cold shower is late in the evening

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:05.800
 and I have no trouble sleeping after that.

1:11:05.800 --> 1:11:07.220
 However, if you have trouble sleeping,

1:11:07.220 --> 1:11:10.060
 I would recommend doing the cold exposure early in the day

1:11:10.060 --> 1:11:12.340
 to match that natural heating,

1:11:12.340 --> 1:11:15.300
 that natural increase in body temperature

1:11:15.300 --> 1:11:18.700
 that occurs across the 24 hour so-called circadian rhythm.

1:11:19.920 --> 1:11:23.100
 Similarly, if you're going to use deliberate heat exposure,

1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:27.180
 you'd be wise to do that later in the day.

1:11:27.180 --> 1:11:28.800
 You'd be wise to do it later in the day

1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:31.540
 because when you get into a warm environment,

1:11:31.540 --> 1:11:34.260
 sure, the surface of your body, the shell heats up,

1:11:34.260 --> 1:11:36.580
 the core of your body heats up,

1:11:36.580 --> 1:11:39.500
 but then it also activates cooling mechanisms

1:11:39.500 --> 1:11:41.300
 through the preoptic area.

1:11:41.300 --> 1:11:43.780
 And when you get out of that hot environment,

1:11:43.780 --> 1:11:45.260
 sauna or otherwise,

1:11:45.260 --> 1:11:47.660
 your body will continue to cool down.

1:11:47.660 --> 1:11:49.620
 And so many people find that if they do sauna

1:11:49.620 --> 1:11:53.040
 in the later half of the day or even just before sleep

1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:56.140
 and then take a warmish shower afterwards,

1:11:56.140 --> 1:11:57.860
 then they find it easier to fall asleep.

1:11:57.860 --> 1:11:58.700
 And that makes sense

1:11:58.700 --> 1:12:01.180
 because their body temperature is dropping.

1:12:01.180 --> 1:12:03.780
 And in fact, if your goal is to really promote

1:12:03.780 --> 1:12:05.720
 the maximum amount of growth hormone release,

1:12:05.720 --> 1:12:07.640
 that's also going to be the best time of day to do it,

1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:08.920
 especially if you haven't eaten

1:12:08.920 --> 1:12:11.820
 in the two hours before sleep, okay?

1:12:11.820 --> 1:12:13.900
 So if you're really going for growth hormone release,

1:12:13.900 --> 1:12:15.380
 you're really trying to optimize sleep

1:12:15.380 --> 1:12:16.920
 and the two things are actually linked

1:12:16.920 --> 1:12:18.220
 because of the release of growth hormone

1:12:18.220 --> 1:12:21.120
 that happens from the pituitary in the early night's sleep,

1:12:21.120 --> 1:12:23.620
 well, then you would be wise to do your sauna

1:12:23.620 --> 1:12:27.140
 maybe once or maybe twice a week in the evening

1:12:27.140 --> 1:12:29.900
 or at nighttime than taking a warm or cool shower

1:12:29.900 --> 1:12:32.420
 just briefly, just enough to kind of rinse off all the sweat

1:12:32.420 --> 1:12:35.580
 from the sauna and then get ready for sleep.

1:12:35.580 --> 1:12:38.040
 And to do that, not necessarily fasted,

1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:40.980
 but to try and keep your levels of glucose and insulin

1:12:40.980 --> 1:12:42.540
 somewhat low in your bloodstream.

1:12:42.540 --> 1:12:46.540
 The reason I say that is that having elevated blood glucose

1:12:46.540 --> 1:12:49.700
 and or insulin tends to blunt

1:12:49.700 --> 1:12:51.440
 or reduce growth hormone release.

1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:54.460
 And that's true for any number of different stimuli,

1:12:54.460 --> 1:12:57.900
 including exercise and including sauna.

1:12:57.900 --> 1:12:59.200
 So there's a really nice study on this

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:01.460
 that I can point you to is this study

1:13:01.460 --> 1:13:03.060
 that was published in the journal Stress,

1:13:03.060 --> 1:13:04.560
 literally that's the name of the journal.

1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:07.260
 I love it when journals have these names like pain

1:13:07.260 --> 1:13:10.180
 or stress, I find that somewhat amusing for reasons

1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:13.040
 that escape me, but nonetheless, amuse me.

1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.100
 The title of this study is growth hormone response

1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:18.360
 to different consecutive stress stimuli in healthy men.

1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:19.260
 Is there any difference?

1:13:19.260 --> 1:13:21.280
 And I don't want to go into all the details of the study

1:13:21.280 --> 1:13:23.400
 because it's pretty extensive and complicated,

1:13:23.400 --> 1:13:26.060
 but basically what they did is that they had people do sauna

1:13:26.060 --> 1:13:30.580
 and then gave them a drug or a condition of having low,

1:13:30.580 --> 1:13:33.220
 not dangerously low, but low blood sugar,

1:13:33.220 --> 1:13:35.360
 or they had them in a condition where they had

1:13:35.360 --> 1:13:37.320
 low blood sugar and then did sauna,

1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:39.260
 or they had them do an exercise protocol

1:13:39.260 --> 1:13:42.860
 that led them to increase growth hormone

1:13:42.860 --> 1:13:44.260
 and then had them do low blood sugar,

1:13:44.260 --> 1:13:47.160
 basically mixing and matching the various stimuli

1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:48.980
 that could increase growth hormone.

1:13:48.980 --> 1:13:51.660
 And what they found was very straightforward.

1:13:51.660 --> 1:13:54.340
 What they found was that doing sauna once

1:13:54.340 --> 1:13:56.360
 and then waiting some period of time,

1:13:56.360 --> 1:13:58.820
 and then later that day doing sauna again,

1:13:58.820 --> 1:14:01.100
 they didn't see the same increase

1:14:01.100 --> 1:14:03.560
 in growth hormone both times.

1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:05.260
 First, they got a big increase in growth hormone

1:14:05.260 --> 1:14:07.540
 and then less if they did sauna again.

1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:10.260
 If they had people do exercise and then sauna,

1:14:10.260 --> 1:14:12.820
 what they found was exercise could stimulate growth hormone,

1:14:12.820 --> 1:14:15.560
 but then following it with sauna did not allow you

1:14:15.560 --> 1:14:18.500
 to get twice as much growth hormone.

1:14:18.500 --> 1:14:21.020
 In general, anytime you release growth hormone,

1:14:21.020 --> 1:14:23.460
 you reduce the likelihood that you're going to release

1:14:23.460 --> 1:14:26.220
 growth hormone again later that day.

1:14:26.220 --> 1:14:28.220
 And this partially explains that earlier study

1:14:28.220 --> 1:14:31.380
 where if people did this growth hormone promoting protocol

1:14:31.380 --> 1:14:32.980
 on day one, but then on day three,

1:14:32.980 --> 1:14:34.340
 they didn't see quite as big an effect,

1:14:34.340 --> 1:14:36.900
 and on day seven, they didn't see quite as big an effect.

1:14:36.900 --> 1:14:39.220
 All it basically boils down to is that

1:14:39.220 --> 1:14:41.260
 if you really want to crank out the most amount

1:14:41.260 --> 1:14:43.620
 of growth hormone in response to sauna,

1:14:43.620 --> 1:14:46.500
 do it fasted or at least not having ingested any food

1:14:46.500 --> 1:14:48.180
 in the two or three hours before.

1:14:48.180 --> 1:14:50.380
 You don't have to be deep into a fast.

1:14:50.380 --> 1:14:52.100
 And the whole notion of what breaks a fast

1:14:52.100 --> 1:14:53.600
 is kind of an interesting conversation

1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:55.300
 because it's contextual, right?

1:14:55.300 --> 1:14:56.980
 Will a sip of coffee break your fast?

1:14:56.980 --> 1:14:59.060
 Well, maybe, probably not.

1:14:59.060 --> 1:15:01.320
 Will one grain of sugar break your fast?

1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:02.160
 No.

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:04.980
 Will an entire candy bar break your fast?

1:15:04.980 --> 1:15:07.480
 Yes, it has to do with where your blood glucose is

1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:09.260
 when you ingest that particular food item,

1:15:09.260 --> 1:15:12.140
 not so much what that food item is per se.

1:15:12.140 --> 1:15:14.220
 But the bottom line here is if you want to crank out

1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:15.860
 the most amount of growth hormone,

1:15:15.860 --> 1:15:17.340
 wait a couple of hours after eating

1:15:17.340 --> 1:15:18.660
 before getting into the sauna,

1:15:18.660 --> 1:15:21.940
 or maybe do it before dinner and then prepare dinner,

1:15:21.940 --> 1:15:23.700
 do the sauna before dinner that is,

1:15:23.700 --> 1:15:25.540
 then prepare dinner, then eat dinner,

1:15:25.540 --> 1:15:27.540
 and then make sure that you wait a few hours

1:15:27.540 --> 1:15:28.620
 before going to sleep.

1:15:28.620 --> 1:15:31.380
 You're going to have to arrange your schedule accordingly.

1:15:31.380 --> 1:15:34.460
 I know most people can't arrange their schedule perfectly

1:15:34.460 --> 1:15:35.940
 just to get growth hormone increases,

1:15:35.940 --> 1:15:37.380
 nor do I think people should approach

1:15:37.380 --> 1:15:38.740
 health protocols that way.

1:15:38.740 --> 1:15:42.140
 I think for 90% of people, 90% of the time,

1:15:42.140 --> 1:15:45.560
 just getting into the sauna once or twice

1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.620
 or three times a week is going to be beneficial

1:15:47.620 --> 1:15:50.220
 for the number of reasons that I described earlier.

1:15:50.220 --> 1:15:52.320
 And you don't want to obsess too much

1:15:52.320 --> 1:15:54.060
 about the exact conditions you need

1:15:54.060 --> 1:15:55.740
 in order to get the greatest effect

1:15:55.740 --> 1:15:57.160
 out of that sauna treatment.

1:15:57.160 --> 1:15:58.660
 These are just some additional tweaks

1:15:58.660 --> 1:16:02.500
 related to food intake and low-level hypoglycemia

1:16:02.500 --> 1:16:05.300
 and exercise that if you wanted to leverage, you could.

1:16:05.300 --> 1:16:06.900
 So if decreases in body temperature

1:16:06.900 --> 1:16:09.000
 tend to aid the transition to sleep,

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:10.780
 and getting out of a hot sauna

1:16:10.780 --> 1:16:13.300
 tends to promote decreases in body temperature,

1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:16.940
 it makes sense why you would want to put your sauna exposure

1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:18.220
 or other deliberate heat exposure

1:16:18.220 --> 1:16:19.600
 in the second half of your day

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:21.380
 and maybe even right before sleep.

1:16:21.380 --> 1:16:24.260
 Now, regardless of what time of day you do sauna

1:16:24.260 --> 1:16:25.700
 or how frequently you do it,

1:16:25.700 --> 1:16:29.160
 you're going to want to hydrate after going in the sauna.

1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:31.500
 When you go in the sauna, you lose water,

1:16:31.500 --> 1:16:34.040
 and when you lose water, you need to replace it.

1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:34.880
 Why?

1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:36.180
 Well, you need water for all your cells,

1:16:36.180 --> 1:16:37.380
 but you also need electrolytes.

1:16:37.380 --> 1:16:39.420
 So make sure that you're replacing the water

1:16:39.420 --> 1:16:41.140
 that you lose in the sauna.

1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:43.740
 Now, there's no exact formula of how much water to drink

1:16:43.740 --> 1:16:45.440
 and whether or not you need electrolytes

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:46.540
 in that water or not.

1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:48.020
 It's going to depend on how much you sweat,

1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:49.400
 meaning how heat adapted you are.

1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:51.860
 It's going to depend on how much salt you tend to excrete

1:16:51.860 --> 1:16:54.620
 in your sweat, huge amount of variation.

1:16:54.620 --> 1:16:56.700
 But in general, one way to approach this

1:16:56.700 --> 1:16:58.260
 would be to make sure that you drink

1:16:58.260 --> 1:17:02.380
 at least 16 ounces of water for every 10 minutes

1:17:02.380 --> 1:17:04.120
 that you happen to be in the sauna.

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:06.860
 You could do that before and during and after,

1:17:06.860 --> 1:17:09.940
 you could do it during and after, or you could do it after.

1:17:09.940 --> 1:17:12.600
 Now, there are other reasons to do deliberate heat exposure

1:17:12.600 --> 1:17:15.160
 that have nothing to do with cardiovascular effects,

1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:18.240
 nothing to do with growth hormone or anything of that sort,

1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:20.100
 but rather have to do with improvements

1:17:20.100 --> 1:17:21.820
 in mood and mental health.

1:17:21.820 --> 1:17:25.100
 In fact, the data related to sauna

1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:27.780
 and other forms of deliberate heat exposure improving mood

1:17:27.780 --> 1:17:31.020
 are very impressive, both at the mechanistic level

1:17:31.020 --> 1:17:33.700
 and in terms of the long-term consequences

1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:35.220
 that people experience.

1:17:35.220 --> 1:17:36.260
 First of all, we need to ask,

1:17:36.260 --> 1:17:38.360
 how is it that deliberate heat exposure

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.180
 can improve our mood and wellbeing?

1:17:40.180 --> 1:17:43.340
 Well, it turns out that it improves mood and wellbeing,

1:17:43.340 --> 1:17:47.200
 but it also improves our capacity to feel good

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:48.300
 in response to things

1:17:48.300 --> 1:17:51.820
 that would ordinarily make us feel somewhat good.

1:17:51.820 --> 1:17:53.520
 Now, this is not a situation

1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:55.500
 where you're going to be walking around,

1:17:55.500 --> 1:17:58.500
 grinning ear to ear in response to nothing at all,

1:17:58.500 --> 1:18:00.200
 simply because you went in a sauna.

1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:04.140
 What I'm talking about is the upregulation of pathways,

1:18:04.140 --> 1:18:06.820
 meaning chemical pathways in your brain and body

1:18:06.820 --> 1:18:10.060
 that allow you to experience pleasure in all its fullness.

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:12.160
 So here's how this whole deliberate heat exposure,

1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:14.020
 sauna, mood thing works.

1:18:15.080 --> 1:18:17.380
 Many of you have probably heard of endorphins.

1:18:17.380 --> 1:18:19.760
 Endorphins are a category of molecules

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:22.140
 that are made naturally in your brain and body,

1:18:22.140 --> 1:18:25.500
 and that are released in response to different forms

1:18:25.500 --> 1:18:26.580
 of stressors.

1:18:26.580 --> 1:18:28.180
 That's right, in response to stressors.

1:18:28.180 --> 1:18:30.500
 So if ever you've gone out on a long run,

1:18:30.500 --> 1:18:31.580
 and at some point in that run,

1:18:31.580 --> 1:18:33.660
 you feel like you're aching and your joints hurt,

1:18:33.660 --> 1:18:35.100
 or maybe you have shin splints,

1:18:35.100 --> 1:18:36.580
 and you push through that,

1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:39.540
 part of the reason that you experience

1:18:39.540 --> 1:18:42.400
 a lack of pain at some point, usually,

1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:46.340
 or you experience a euphoria during or after that exercise

1:18:46.340 --> 1:18:50.240
 is the exercise-induced effects on endorphin release,

1:18:50.240 --> 1:18:52.100
 or rather, to be more specific,

1:18:52.100 --> 1:18:55.700
 I should say the exercise-induced consequences

1:18:55.700 --> 1:18:56.860
 on the stress system,

1:18:56.860 --> 1:18:59.740
 which in turn trigger the release of endorphin.

1:18:59.740 --> 1:19:02.660
 In other words, when we experience short-term

1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:06.780
 or acute stress, the endorphin system is activated.

1:19:06.780 --> 1:19:10.100
 Now, the endorphin system is not just about feeling good,

1:19:10.100 --> 1:19:12.660
 believe it or not, it's also about feeling bad.

1:19:12.660 --> 1:19:14.980
 And there are two general categories of endorphins.

1:19:14.980 --> 1:19:17.100
 The first are the ones that you normally hear about,

1:19:17.100 --> 1:19:19.440
 endorphins, things that bind, for instance,

1:19:19.440 --> 1:19:22.500
 to receptors like the mu opioid receptor.

1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:25.560
 Opioids are not just prescribed compounds

1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:29.460
 or, unfortunately, drugs of abuse, which they are, right?

1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:31.460
 We have this opioid crisis in the United States

1:19:31.460 --> 1:19:34.660
 and elsewhere, which is a very serious and tragic thing,

1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:37.220
 but we make endogenous opioids.

1:19:37.220 --> 1:19:40.780
 We make endorphins that naturally act as pain relievers

1:19:40.780 --> 1:19:43.620
 and that make us feel mildly euphoric.

1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:47.120
 We also make endorphins such as dynorphin,

1:19:47.120 --> 1:19:52.120
 that's D-Y-N-O-R-P-H-I-N, dynorphin,

1:19:52.220 --> 1:19:55.960
 that actually make us feel worse in response to stressors.

1:19:57.220 --> 1:19:59.380
 When we get into a hot sauna

1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:01.700
 or a hot environment of any kind,

1:20:01.700 --> 1:20:04.820
 dynorphins are liberated in the brain and body.

1:20:04.820 --> 1:20:06.640
 And I should mention that dynorphins are made

1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:10.260
 by many neurons in many different areas of the brain.

1:20:10.260 --> 1:20:12.540
 So you might think, well, why would I want that?

1:20:12.540 --> 1:20:15.020
 Why would I want to release dynorphin into my brain and body?

1:20:15.020 --> 1:20:17.260
 Well, first of all, when you get into an uncomfortably

1:20:17.260 --> 1:20:21.020
 hot situation, uncomfortably hot scenario,

1:20:21.020 --> 1:20:22.500
 oh gosh, this is sounding terrible,

1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:25.340
 in a deliberately hot environment

1:20:25.340 --> 1:20:27.220
 that you are using to try and trigger

1:20:27.220 --> 1:20:30.300
 some sort of biological or psychological benefit,

1:20:30.300 --> 1:20:33.860
 I should say, the discomfort that you feel,

1:20:33.860 --> 1:20:36.340
 the desire to get out of that environment

1:20:36.340 --> 1:20:40.640
 is in part the consequence of the release of dynorphin.

1:20:40.640 --> 1:20:42.700
 It's also the consequence of the activation

1:20:42.700 --> 1:20:43.940
 of that sympathetic nervous system.

1:20:43.940 --> 1:20:46.060
 Remember, the preoptic area can communicate

1:20:46.060 --> 1:20:48.220
 with the amygdala and trigger that kind of fight

1:20:48.220 --> 1:20:49.800
 or flight mode, I want to get out of the sauna,

1:20:49.800 --> 1:20:51.200
 this is really, really hot.

1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:53.460
 But dynorphin is also liberated

1:20:53.460 --> 1:20:55.580
 from a certain number of neurons.

1:20:55.580 --> 1:20:59.720
 Dynorphin binds to what's called the kappa receptor.

1:20:59.720 --> 1:21:02.740
 The kappa receptor binds dynorphin

1:21:02.740 --> 1:21:05.100
 and triggers pathways in the brain and body

1:21:05.100 --> 1:21:07.780
 that lead to agitation, to stress,

1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:10.660
 and believe it or not, to a general sense of pain.

1:21:10.660 --> 1:21:13.180
 This is why you want to get out of the hot sauna.

1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:15.580
 And remember, if it's unsafe levels of hot,

1:21:15.580 --> 1:21:17.400
 then you should get out of that sauna

1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:19.200
 or other hot environment.

1:21:19.200 --> 1:21:21.220
 But if you're working in a range

1:21:21.220 --> 1:21:23.020
 or you're exposing yourself to a range of heat

1:21:23.020 --> 1:21:25.360
 that's uncomfortable but safe to be in,

1:21:25.360 --> 1:21:27.900
 dynorphin will be liberated from these neurons,

1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:30.220
 bind to the kappa receptor,

1:21:30.220 --> 1:21:33.620
 and as a downstream consequence of that,

1:21:33.620 --> 1:21:35.820
 there will be an increase in the receptors

1:21:35.820 --> 1:21:38.820
 that bind the other endorphins,

1:21:38.820 --> 1:21:40.740
 the endorphins that make you feel soothed,

1:21:40.740 --> 1:21:41.900
 that make you feel happy,

1:21:41.900 --> 1:21:44.500
 and that make you feel mild euphoria.

1:21:44.500 --> 1:21:46.940
 So there've been a number of studies showing that initially

1:21:46.940 --> 1:21:49.540
 deliberate heat exposure by sauna or otherwise

1:21:49.540 --> 1:21:51.220
 causes the release of dynorphin.

1:21:51.220 --> 1:21:52.700
 In fact, I think it's fair to say

1:21:52.700 --> 1:21:55.100
 that every time we get into a hot environment

1:21:55.100 --> 1:21:56.900
 that's uncomfortable or a cold environment

1:21:56.900 --> 1:21:57.740
 that's uncomfortable,

1:21:57.740 --> 1:21:59.220
 dynorphin is likely released

1:21:59.220 --> 1:22:00.860
 and binding to the kappa receptor.

1:22:02.300 --> 1:22:03.780
 But over time,

1:22:03.780 --> 1:22:06.400
 that binding of dynorphin to the kappa receptor

1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:08.260
 leads to downstream changes

1:22:08.260 --> 1:22:10.740
 in the way that the feel-good endorphins,

1:22:10.740 --> 1:22:13.660
 things like endorphin binding to the mu opioid receptor,

1:22:13.660 --> 1:22:15.820
 and there are still other feel-good endorphins,

1:22:15.820 --> 1:22:16.660
 so to speak.

1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:20.340
 That system becomes much more efficient

1:22:20.340 --> 1:22:22.240
 such that people feel an elevation

1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:24.060
 in their baseline level of mood,

1:22:24.060 --> 1:22:27.920
 and when a good or happy event comes along,

1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:31.900
 they feel a heightened level of happiness or joy or awe

1:22:31.900 --> 1:22:34.200
 or improved mood in response to that.

1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:36.780
 This is not unlike the effects of caffeine

1:22:36.780 --> 1:22:39.060
 on the dopamine receptor that I've described previously,

1:22:39.060 --> 1:22:41.300
 and for those of you that aren't familiar with it,

1:22:41.300 --> 1:22:44.260
 many of you drink caffeine and love it.

1:22:44.260 --> 1:22:45.340
 Part of the reason you love it

1:22:45.340 --> 1:22:47.720
 is because of the release of certain neurochemicals

1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:50.100
 like norepinephrine, et cetera,

1:22:50.100 --> 1:22:51.140
 the energy that it gives you,

1:22:51.140 --> 1:22:53.260
 maybe the taste, I would hope as well,

1:22:53.260 --> 1:22:56.420
 but caffeine ingestion also causes increases

1:22:56.420 --> 1:22:59.300
 in dopamine receptor concentration and efficacy.

1:22:59.300 --> 1:23:01.880
 In other words, it allows the receptors for dopamine

1:23:01.880 --> 1:23:04.700
 to work better so that for a given amount

1:23:04.700 --> 1:23:05.580
 of dopamine release,

1:23:05.580 --> 1:23:08.820
 you experience more pleasure and motivation.

1:23:08.820 --> 1:23:10.140
 This is a similar mechanism,

1:23:10.140 --> 1:23:11.900
 but within the endorphin pathway.

1:23:11.900 --> 1:23:12.860
 So what does it mean?

1:23:12.860 --> 1:23:15.380
 It means that a little bit of discomfort

1:23:15.380 --> 1:23:17.380
 as a consequence of deliberate heat exposure,

1:23:17.380 --> 1:23:21.380
 while in the short term doesn't feel good by definition,

1:23:21.380 --> 1:23:23.500
 it is activating pathways that are allowing

1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:27.120
 the feel-good molecules and neural circuitries

1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:28.660
 that exist in your brain and body

1:23:28.660 --> 1:23:31.360
 to increase their efficiency,

1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:33.460
 placing you in a better position to be joyful

1:23:33.460 --> 1:23:35.220
 in response to the events of life.

1:23:35.220 --> 1:23:37.040
 I confess I'm very excited about the data

1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:40.180
 on deliberate heat exposure and improvements

1:23:40.180 --> 1:23:44.100
 in the chemical systems that underlie good mood.

1:23:44.100 --> 1:23:46.340
 And just to underscore this further,

1:23:46.340 --> 1:23:51.340
 the dynorphin system is not unique to heat-induced stress.

1:23:51.700 --> 1:23:55.180
 In fact, there are beautiful studies and reviews out there

1:23:55.180 --> 1:23:58.820
 about the role of dynorphin in stress and depression,

1:23:58.820 --> 1:24:02.740
 in stress and alcoholism, just as a brief aside,

1:24:02.740 --> 1:24:04.900
 and in the future, we will do a whole episode

1:24:04.900 --> 1:24:07.300
 on alcohol and alcoholism,

1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:10.060
 but turns out that chronic alcohol use and alcoholism

1:24:10.060 --> 1:24:12.900
 causes changes in dopamine receptors

1:24:12.900 --> 1:24:16.820
 that make it very difficult for people to achieve pleasure

1:24:16.820 --> 1:24:19.560
 through things other than alcohol and even alcohol.

1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:22.860
 That's kind of the really diabolical nature of addiction,

1:24:22.860 --> 1:24:24.900
 which is the thing that initially brings pleasure,

1:24:24.900 --> 1:24:26.860
 eventually is just required to maintain

1:24:26.860 --> 1:24:28.860
 baseline levels of dopamine.

1:24:28.860 --> 1:24:31.060
 And I've talked before, and Dr. Anna Lemke,

1:24:31.060 --> 1:24:33.440
 when she was a guest on this podcast,

1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:36.180
 talked about the pleasure plane balance

1:24:36.180 --> 1:24:38.380
 that exists within the dopamine system.

1:24:38.380 --> 1:24:39.780
 And it's beautifully described in her book,

1:24:39.780 --> 1:24:41.380
 Dopamine Nation, by the way,

1:24:41.380 --> 1:24:45.140
 excellent book I recommend to all people, addicts or not.

1:24:45.140 --> 1:24:49.180
 Well, in that context of pleasure and pain,

1:24:49.180 --> 1:24:51.460
 it's very clear what the pleasure molecule is.

1:24:51.460 --> 1:24:53.800
 It's actually a molecule more related to motivation,

1:24:53.800 --> 1:24:55.580
 and that's dopamine.

1:24:55.580 --> 1:24:59.620
 The pain molecule, however, appears to be dynorphin.

1:24:59.620 --> 1:25:03.420
 And the fact that dynorphin is dysregulated

1:25:03.420 --> 1:25:05.240
 in stress and depression and alcoholism,

1:25:05.240 --> 1:25:07.640
 and the relationship between dynorphin and dopamine

1:25:07.640 --> 1:25:09.960
 is something that we should all take very seriously.

1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:12.940
 And for that reason, I'm very excited about the fact

1:25:12.940 --> 1:25:15.040
 that deliberate heat exposure

1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:17.560
 can leverage the dynorphin system

1:25:17.560 --> 1:25:19.780
 in a short-term and acute way

1:25:19.780 --> 1:25:23.620
 that allows mood to improve after the sauna exposure.

1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:26.620
 So for those of you that don't like heat exposure,

1:25:26.620 --> 1:25:31.220
 keep in mind that a lot of the observed positive effects

1:25:31.220 --> 1:25:33.740
 on our biology relate to metabolism,

1:25:33.740 --> 1:25:36.860
 cardiovascular function, but also mental health.

1:25:36.860 --> 1:25:40.480
 And along those lines, there's a wonderful study,

1:25:40.480 --> 1:25:42.260
 again, published in 2018.

1:25:42.260 --> 1:25:44.300
 I don't know why, I guess 2018 was a big year

1:25:44.300 --> 1:25:47.360
 for deliberate heat exposure studies.

1:25:48.560 --> 1:25:50.940
 The title of this study is Sauna Bathing

1:25:50.940 --> 1:25:52.740
 and Risk of Psychotic Disorders.

1:25:52.740 --> 1:25:55.140
 And this was a prospective cohort study.

1:25:55.140 --> 1:25:57.220
 Again, we'll provide a link to this study.

1:25:57.220 --> 1:25:58.140
 It's a really interesting study

1:25:58.140 --> 1:26:01.260
 that explored the relationship between mental health,

1:26:01.260 --> 1:26:04.260
 so people suffering from various forms of psychosis,

1:26:04.260 --> 1:26:07.980
 schizophrenia and other forms of psychosis, and use of sauna.

1:26:07.980 --> 1:26:09.680
 So essentially what this study did

1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:11.980
 is they looked at a very large number of subjects,

1:26:11.980 --> 1:26:14.100
 more than 2,000 subjects,

1:26:14.100 --> 1:26:16.220
 who had no history of psychotic disorders.

1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:17.740
 They were classified into three groups

1:26:17.740 --> 1:26:20.220
 based on their frequency of sauna use,

1:26:20.220 --> 1:26:23.100
 either once a week, two to three times per week,

1:26:23.100 --> 1:26:24.860
 or four to seven times per week.

1:26:24.860 --> 1:26:27.500
 This should call to mind that earlier study

1:26:27.500 --> 1:26:31.780
 on all risk mortality and cardiovascular event risk.

1:26:31.780 --> 1:26:35.180
 And then they explored the hazard ratio

1:26:35.180 --> 1:26:37.220
 for psychosis specifically,

1:26:37.220 --> 1:26:38.900
 meaning how likely it was that people

1:26:38.900 --> 1:26:40.540
 would develop psychotic symptoms

1:26:40.540 --> 1:26:43.920
 or full-blown psychotic illness

1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:45.980
 according to their frequency of sauna session.

1:26:45.980 --> 1:26:48.780
 So again, this isn't causal, this is correlative.

1:26:48.780 --> 1:26:50.820
 And according to the data in this study,

1:26:50.820 --> 1:26:53.100
 what they concluded is that there was a strong

1:26:53.100 --> 1:26:55.340
 and inverse independent association

1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:57.700
 between frequent sauna bathing and the future risk

1:26:57.700 --> 1:27:00.780
 of psychotic disorders in this population.

1:27:00.780 --> 1:27:03.820
 Now, this does not mean that going into a sauna

1:27:03.820 --> 1:27:05.920
 seven times per week is going to prevent people

1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:08.320
 from becoming schizophrenic necessarily,

1:27:08.320 --> 1:27:10.740
 or from having a psychotic episode necessarily.

1:27:10.740 --> 1:27:14.160
 And of course, frequent sauna use will be related

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:16.800
 to other health promoting activities.

1:27:16.800 --> 1:27:19.200
 But in this study, as in the previous study,

1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:21.140
 they went to great lengths in order to try

1:27:21.140 --> 1:27:24.320
 and limit those so-called confounding variables.

1:27:24.320 --> 1:27:26.160
 Now, of course, this is just one study.

1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:28.560
 And again, it's correlative, not causal,

1:27:28.560 --> 1:27:31.380
 but based on the large number of subjects they included,

1:27:31.380 --> 1:27:34.300
 plus the rigor of the statistical analysis,

1:27:34.300 --> 1:27:36.060
 we're starting to see a general picture

1:27:36.060 --> 1:27:38.780
 that using the sorts of sauna protocols

1:27:38.780 --> 1:27:41.500
 that I've described throughout this episode,

1:27:41.500 --> 1:27:46.500
 five to 20 minutes or so done one to seven times per week

1:27:46.860 --> 1:27:49.940
 is associated with a general improvement

1:27:49.940 --> 1:27:51.280
 in cardiovascular health,

1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:54.420
 a general improvement in mental health.

1:27:54.420 --> 1:27:57.140
 And it really points to the fact that yes,

1:27:57.140 --> 1:28:01.180
 sauna done acutely for three or four times a day,

1:28:01.180 --> 1:28:03.520
 30 minutes each session separated by a cooling,

1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:04.940
 maybe getting into cold bath.

1:28:04.940 --> 1:28:08.160
 Sure, that can potently increase growth hormone,

1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:11.260
 but done on a more regular basis can reduce cortisol,

1:28:11.260 --> 1:28:13.940
 improve heart health, improve mental health.

1:28:13.940 --> 1:28:17.500
 And for that reason, and the fact that for most people,

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:19.220
 it is conceivable to come up with a way

1:28:19.220 --> 1:28:21.060
 that you could get into deliberate heat exposure

1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:22.900
 for a minimum of cost, right?

1:28:22.900 --> 1:28:26.060
 It's a hot bath, or if you had to resort to, you know,

1:28:26.060 --> 1:28:28.200
 bundling up and going for a jog, this sort of thing,

1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:31.960
 or if you have access to it, a sauna of some sort,

1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:34.920
 that we're really talking about a stimulus

1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:38.460
 to initiate a large number of different biological cascades

1:28:38.460 --> 1:28:42.300
 that wick out to improve multiple aspects

1:28:42.300 --> 1:28:43.580
 of brain and body health.

1:28:43.580 --> 1:28:46.900
 So up until now, I've been talking about whole body heating.

1:28:46.900 --> 1:28:49.660
 So for instance, putting your whole body into the sauna,

1:28:49.660 --> 1:28:51.860
 which of course is what most people do,

1:28:51.860 --> 1:28:54.980
 or getting into a hot tub or hot bath up to your neck,

1:28:54.980 --> 1:28:56.680
 or in the cases where we were talking about

1:28:56.680 --> 1:28:58.940
 deliberate cold exposure as a means to increase

1:28:58.940 --> 1:29:01.740
 core body temperature and metabolism,

1:29:01.740 --> 1:29:05.180
 getting into an ice bath or cold water of some sort

1:29:05.180 --> 1:29:08.140
 up to your neck or into a cold shower, et cetera.

1:29:08.140 --> 1:29:10.120
 Now I'd like to talk about deliberately heating

1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:12.980
 or cooling specific parts of the body,

1:29:12.980 --> 1:29:16.280
 meaning certain surface areas of your body

1:29:16.280 --> 1:29:19.460
 as a means to get effects on those particular areas

1:29:19.460 --> 1:29:21.680
 as well as at the whole body level.

1:29:21.680 --> 1:29:22.980
 Numerous times throughout this episode,

1:29:22.980 --> 1:29:25.060
 I've talked about the dangers of overheating.

1:29:25.060 --> 1:29:27.820
 So what should you do if you think you or someone else

1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:30.340
 is hyperthermic, is too hot?

1:29:30.340 --> 1:29:32.380
 Well, if you understand just a little bit

1:29:32.380 --> 1:29:36.620
 about the cooling and heating systems of your shell and core,

1:29:36.620 --> 1:29:38.580
 there are some terrific tools that you can use

1:29:38.580 --> 1:29:41.240
 in order to cool off your core quickly.

1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:43.360
 And remember the core consists of the nervous system,

1:29:43.360 --> 1:29:44.740
 the spinal cord and the viscera,

1:29:44.740 --> 1:29:47.140
 which are really the organs you're trying to protect.

1:29:47.140 --> 1:29:50.940
 So being able to cool off the core of your body quickly

1:29:50.940 --> 1:29:52.740
 can be very beneficial and in some cases

1:29:52.740 --> 1:29:54.440
 it could even save your life.

1:29:54.440 --> 1:29:58.020
 There is a way to more quickly heat or cool the body

1:29:58.020 --> 1:30:01.540
 and that's through specific elements of your shell,

1:30:01.540 --> 1:30:03.700
 meaning particular skin surfaces.

1:30:03.700 --> 1:30:06.700
 I've talked extensively about this in the episode on cold.

1:30:06.700 --> 1:30:09.720
 It was also covered in the episode with my guest,

1:30:09.720 --> 1:30:12.640
 Dr. Craig Heller from the biology department at Stanford.

1:30:13.540 --> 1:30:16.540
 It relates to the so-called glabrous skin surfaces

1:30:16.540 --> 1:30:19.100
 on the upper half of our face,

1:30:19.100 --> 1:30:20.780
 palms of our hands and the bottoms of our feet.

1:30:20.780 --> 1:30:23.100
 And for those of you that heard this before,

1:30:23.100 --> 1:30:25.060
 I encourage you to continue to listen nonetheless

1:30:25.060 --> 1:30:27.380
 because today I'm going to talk about specifically

1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:30.180
 how to heat the body or cool the body

1:30:30.180 --> 1:30:32.700
 through these glabrous skin surfaces.

1:30:32.700 --> 1:30:35.640
 Very briefly, the mechanism is as follows.

1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:37.260
 The palms of our hands, the bottoms of our feet

1:30:37.260 --> 1:30:38.700
 and the upper half of our face

1:30:39.660 --> 1:30:42.580
 overlies specific types of vasculature,

1:30:42.580 --> 1:30:46.540
 meaning specific types of veins and arteries

1:30:46.540 --> 1:30:48.940
 that don't have capillaries between them.

1:30:48.940 --> 1:30:53.940
 And as a consequence, heat and cold can move very quickly

1:30:54.360 --> 1:30:57.100
 from the palms of the hands, the bottoms of the feet

1:30:57.100 --> 1:30:58.500
 and the upper half of our face

1:30:58.500 --> 1:31:01.580
 and change our core body temperature.

1:31:01.580 --> 1:31:04.380
 There's a name for these particular vascular structures.

1:31:04.380 --> 1:31:08.160
 They're called AVAs or arteriovenous astomoses.

1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:12.040
 Basically veins and arteries interacting directly

1:31:12.040 --> 1:31:14.180
 without capillaries in between,

1:31:14.180 --> 1:31:18.060
 which allows cooling of blood or heating of blood

1:31:18.060 --> 1:31:20.800
 much more quickly than is possible

1:31:20.800 --> 1:31:23.460
 by applying colder heat elsewhere on the body

1:31:23.460 --> 1:31:26.500
 where capillaries intervene between veins and arteries.

1:31:26.500 --> 1:31:29.900
 These AVAs, arteriovenous astomoses can be leveraged

1:31:29.900 --> 1:31:32.280
 to cool off your core body temperature very quickly.

1:31:32.280 --> 1:31:35.220
 The key thing is to get the palms of your hands,

1:31:35.220 --> 1:31:37.060
 the bottoms of your feet and the upper half of your face

1:31:37.060 --> 1:31:40.580
 in contact with a cold surface or fluid

1:31:40.580 --> 1:31:44.020
 that is cold enough to cool the blood

1:31:44.020 --> 1:31:45.740
 and the core of your body,

1:31:45.740 --> 1:31:49.860
 but not so cold that it constricts the veins

1:31:49.860 --> 1:31:51.700
 just below the palms of your hands,

1:31:51.700 --> 1:31:54.120
 the bottoms of your feet or the upper half of your face.

1:31:54.120 --> 1:31:57.700
 So not placing ice packs necessarily,

1:31:57.700 --> 1:32:00.960
 but maybe placing cool towels on the bottoms of the feet,

1:32:00.960 --> 1:32:02.660
 the palms of the hands and the upper half of the face

1:32:02.660 --> 1:32:03.780
 and as they warm up,

1:32:03.780 --> 1:32:06.020
 replacing those with other cool towels.

1:32:06.020 --> 1:32:07.300
 The exact temperature will depend

1:32:07.300 --> 1:32:08.940
 on how hot you happen to be.

1:32:08.940 --> 1:32:10.860
 I can't know that without knowing your particular

1:32:10.860 --> 1:32:12.180
 circumstances.

1:32:12.180 --> 1:32:15.420
 If you'd like to learn more about how to cool off your core

1:32:15.420 --> 1:32:17.300
 very quickly and some of the details

1:32:17.300 --> 1:32:19.220
 and some of the technologies that are being developed

1:32:19.220 --> 1:32:20.060
 to do that,

1:32:20.060 --> 1:32:21.880
 please see the episode I did with Craig Heller

1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:23.300
 or the episode on cold.

1:32:23.300 --> 1:32:25.060
 If you don't want to go to those episodes,

1:32:25.060 --> 1:32:27.220
 here's a good procedure that you could use.

1:32:27.220 --> 1:32:28.780
 You could grab, for instance,

1:32:28.780 --> 1:32:32.140
 a package of frozen broccoli or frozen blueberries.

1:32:32.140 --> 1:32:33.460
 If someone is really, really warm,

1:32:33.460 --> 1:32:34.860
 make sure they take off their shoes and socks,

1:32:34.860 --> 1:32:36.140
 get their feet on top of those,

1:32:36.140 --> 1:32:38.180
 ideally get some into their hands as well,

1:32:38.180 --> 1:32:41.180
 get some cool compresses and get them onto people's face.

1:32:41.180 --> 1:32:44.100
 You could of course also put a cool compress

1:32:44.100 --> 1:32:45.940
 on the back of the neck, on the top of the head.

1:32:45.940 --> 1:32:47.580
 That would be an especially good idea

1:32:47.580 --> 1:32:49.940
 if someone were hyperthermic because of the way

1:32:49.940 --> 1:32:51.600
 that cooling of the brain occurs

1:32:51.600 --> 1:32:53.700
 under conditions of hyperthermia.

1:32:53.700 --> 1:32:57.580
 But the key point here is that just putting cold compresses

1:32:57.580 --> 1:32:59.560
 or cold materials onto somebody's torso

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:01.020
 is not going to be as efficient

1:33:01.020 --> 1:33:02.740
 as cooling those glabber skin surfaces,

1:33:02.740 --> 1:33:04.440
 the bottoms of the feet, the palms of the hands

1:33:04.440 --> 1:33:06.700
 and the upper half of their face.

1:33:06.700 --> 1:33:09.220
 Similarly, or I suppose to be more accurate,

1:33:09.220 --> 1:33:10.460
 I should say conversely,

1:33:10.460 --> 1:33:13.100
 there are times when it is desirable

1:33:13.100 --> 1:33:15.460
 to heat the core of the body.

1:33:15.460 --> 1:33:18.220
 And once again, just simply throwing a hot towel

1:33:18.220 --> 1:33:21.180
 over somebody is not going to be the most efficient way.

1:33:21.180 --> 1:33:25.140
 If someone is hypothermic, they're too cold,

1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:27.800
 it is not a problem to cover them with a blanket,

1:33:27.800 --> 1:33:32.800
 but ideally what you do is you use some warm object

1:33:32.800 --> 1:33:36.740
 or warm fluid to warm the bottoms of their feet,

1:33:36.740 --> 1:33:38.800
 their hands and the upper half of their face.

1:33:38.800 --> 1:33:41.880
 Of course, not so warm that you burn those skin surfaces.

1:33:41.880 --> 1:33:43.440
 This has actually been examined in studies

1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:44.560
 from the Heller lab.

1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:48.280
 Turns out that for instance, to get people out of anesthesia,

1:33:48.280 --> 1:33:51.440
 it is beneficial to warm their core body temperature.

1:33:51.440 --> 1:33:52.940
 And of course there is fever,

1:33:52.940 --> 1:33:55.660
 which you should know is an adaptive response.

1:33:55.660 --> 1:33:57.640
 While fever is uncomfortable,

1:33:57.640 --> 1:33:59.560
 and in fact often involves a mismatch

1:33:59.560 --> 1:34:01.160
 between our perception of our shell

1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:03.120
 and a perception of our core temperature.

1:34:03.120 --> 1:34:04.040
 In other words,

1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:05.880
 there are times when our body temperature is really high,

1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:08.040
 we have a fever and yet we're shivering, we're cold.

1:34:08.040 --> 1:34:10.340
 And that's because under conditions of fever,

1:34:10.340 --> 1:34:15.060
 the immune system liberates certain molecules that impact

1:34:15.060 --> 1:34:19.180
 and in some ways intentionally disrupt the preoptic area,

1:34:19.180 --> 1:34:21.600
 the POA and the way it normally functions

1:34:21.600 --> 1:34:24.160
 so that it can override peripheral signals

1:34:24.160 --> 1:34:25.720
 and simply try and heat the body

1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:29.640
 and kill whatever pathogen has infected the body.

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:32.520
 So for those of you that think about fever

1:34:32.520 --> 1:34:34.500
 is always a bad thing, it's not.

1:34:34.500 --> 1:34:36.680
 Now, of course we don't want our core body temperature

1:34:36.680 --> 1:34:39.640
 to go so high that tissues of the brain and body are damaged.

1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:43.520
 This is one reason why if a fever ever goes above 103,

1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:46.440
 you need to start getting a little bit worried 104.

1:34:46.440 --> 1:34:48.600
 There are times when you need to call an ambulance

1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:49.740
 or go to a hospital.

1:34:49.740 --> 1:34:52.040
 You really need to employ cooling methods

1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:53.300
 of the sort that I talked about before

1:34:53.300 --> 1:34:55.040
 to prevent hyperthermia.

1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:58.320
 Of course, safe ranges for body temperature vary

1:34:58.320 --> 1:34:59.760
 between infants and adults.

1:34:59.760 --> 1:35:01.120
 So you can look those up online

1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:02.220
 depending on the person's age,

1:35:02.220 --> 1:35:04.220
 what is a safe range, what is not.

1:35:04.220 --> 1:35:06.740
 But keep in mind that if you are taking compounds,

1:35:06.740 --> 1:35:08.360
 pills to reduce your fever,

1:35:08.360 --> 1:35:11.620
 you're actually short-circuiting the protective mechanism

1:35:11.620 --> 1:35:13.400
 for burning up the pathogen.

1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:16.920
 And that's because most pathogens, bacteria and viruses

1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:18.820
 don't survive well at high temperatures.

1:35:18.820 --> 1:35:19.840
 In fact, in laboratories,

1:35:19.840 --> 1:35:21.660
 if we want to preserve a virus for use,

1:35:21.660 --> 1:35:23.080
 we put it into a freezer.

1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:26.480
 If we want to kill a virus, we heat inoculate it.

1:35:26.480 --> 1:35:28.800
 So in many ways, fever is your natural form

1:35:28.800 --> 1:35:31.200
 of heat inoculation designed to kill pathogens

1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:32.440
 of various kinds.

1:35:32.440 --> 1:35:33.940
 Now, last but certainly not least,

1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:35.880
 I want to refer to the study that I described

1:35:35.880 --> 1:35:38.280
 at the very beginning of this episode

1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:41.480
 involving what's called local hyperthermia

1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:44.320
 in order to trigger a number of biological processes

1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:49.160
 in fat tissue in order to convert white fat to beige fat,

1:35:49.160 --> 1:35:52.200
 which is the metabolically active form of fat.

1:35:52.200 --> 1:35:53.800
 Many of you, or at least some of you

1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:55.020
 should be familiar with the fact

1:35:55.020 --> 1:35:59.440
 that deliberate cold exposure can increase brown fat stores,

1:35:59.440 --> 1:36:01.680
 these mitochondrial dense fat stores

1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:05.280
 that can in turn allow a person to feel more comfortable

1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:07.800
 in cold temperatures, water or otherwise,

1:36:07.800 --> 1:36:10.320
 and increase core metabolism.

1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:12.180
 I talked about this in the episode on cold,

1:36:12.180 --> 1:36:14.480
 but very briefly, the general protocol again

1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:17.640
 is to get 11 minutes total per week of uncomfortable

1:36:17.640 --> 1:36:19.320
 yet safe deliberate cold exposure,

1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:21.860
 either through ice bath, cold shower,

1:36:21.860 --> 1:36:23.920
 cold immersion up to the neck,

1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:27.360
 or some other form of cold exposure.

1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:29.160
 That triggers increases in brown fat,

1:36:29.160 --> 1:36:32.720
 that's been beautifully shown by Dr. Susanna Soberg,

1:36:32.720 --> 1:36:34.280
 and that increase in brown fat

1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:36.260
 in turn increases core metabolism

1:36:36.260 --> 1:36:40.080
 and one's ability to feel comfortable in cold temperatures.

1:36:40.080 --> 1:36:42.400
 This was a study done in humans,

1:36:42.400 --> 1:36:44.920
 and there's now ample evidence from animal models

1:36:44.920 --> 1:36:47.120
 to support that this is a general phenomenon

1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:50.320
 that I think most people could use and benefit from.

1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:53.440
 Local hyperthermia is a distinctly different phenomenon.

1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:56.640
 It involves heating a particular surface of the body

1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:00.280
 as a way to convert the white fat at that location

1:37:00.280 --> 1:37:01.680
 to beige fat,

1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:04.660
 which in turn leads to more systemic increases

1:37:04.660 --> 1:37:07.960
 in thermogenesis and increases in metabolism,

1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:09.760
 and believe it or not, in fat loss.

1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:11.160
 Now, the study that I'm referring to

1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:13.060
 is a very recent study that was published again

1:37:13.060 --> 1:37:17.080
 in this terrific apex journal, Cell, Cell Press Journal,

1:37:17.080 --> 1:37:19.080
 and again, one of the three top journals,

1:37:19.080 --> 1:37:21.160
 Nature Science and Cell are the three top journals,

1:37:21.160 --> 1:37:23.460
 top because they're the most competitive,

1:37:23.460 --> 1:37:25.680
 but also generally, not always,

1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:27.060
 but generally the most stringent

1:37:27.060 --> 1:37:28.360
 in terms of the review process,

1:37:28.360 --> 1:37:30.400
 papers that make it into these three journals

1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:32.600
 generally are a very, very high quality,

1:37:32.600 --> 1:37:33.720
 and certainly enough people see them

1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:35.260
 that if they're not of high quality,

1:37:35.260 --> 1:37:36.540
 they get shot down pretty quickly

1:37:36.540 --> 1:37:37.740
 in a short amount of time,

1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:39.200
 whereas papers in other journals

1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:40.880
 can sometimes last a long time

1:37:40.880 --> 1:37:43.840
 before they're ever replicated, et cetera.

1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:46.840
 The title of this paper is Local Hyperthermia Therapy

1:37:46.840 --> 1:37:50.800
 Induces Browning of White Fat and Treats Obesity.

1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:54.400
 This was a study that was performed on mice and humans

1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:55.900
 in the same study.

1:37:55.900 --> 1:37:59.100
 What the study involved was heating of a local patch of skin

1:37:59.100 --> 1:38:00.640
 to 41 degrees Celsius,

1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:04.360
 which is 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit,

1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:06.720
 but not damaging the skin, okay?

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:10.200
 So the methods of heating did not involve

1:38:10.200 --> 1:38:12.000
 placing something on the skin that would damage it.

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:13.480
 In fact, in the study on the mice,

1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:17.440
 they used this kind of clever molecular chicanery

1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:18.280
 in order to do it,

1:38:18.280 --> 1:38:20.200
 and in humans, they used a thermocouple

1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:23.760
 that would allow them to heat the skin up just locally,

1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:25.040
 in particular locations on the body

1:38:25.040 --> 1:38:27.040
 that I'll talk about in a moment.

1:38:27.040 --> 1:38:32.040
 They refer to this process as LHT, or local heat therapy.

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:36.980
 The reason they did this is worth considering.

1:38:36.980 --> 1:38:40.320
 It's long been known from clinical data,

1:38:40.320 --> 1:38:42.440
 and in fact, from a bit of research data,

1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:46.120
 that people that experience burn on a small,

1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:48.800
 or unfortunately in some circumstances,

1:38:48.800 --> 1:38:50.960
 a significant portion of their body,

1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:54.600
 experience overall decreases in body fat

1:38:54.600 --> 1:38:58.420
 and increases in metabolism that can last many years.

1:38:58.420 --> 1:39:01.120
 Now, of course, is not reasonable,

1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:03.440
 nor would one ever want to induce burn

1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:05.420
 in order to induce fat loss,

1:39:05.420 --> 1:39:08.600
 but the observed increases in metabolism and fat loss

1:39:08.600 --> 1:39:11.360
 in response to skin surface burn

1:39:11.360 --> 1:39:14.520
 couldn't be explained by reductions in activity

1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:16.240
 related to the burn, for instance.

1:39:16.240 --> 1:39:19.540
 And in fact, there are molecular pathways

1:39:19.540 --> 1:39:22.120
 related to something called UCP1,

1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:24.060
 which is uncoupling protein one.

1:39:24.060 --> 1:39:25.820
 I talked about this also in the cold episode,

1:39:25.820 --> 1:39:27.660
 but don't worry if you didn't see that episode,

1:39:27.660 --> 1:39:28.780
 or if you choose not to.

1:39:28.780 --> 1:39:33.780
 UCP1 has the ability to increase mitochondrial function

1:39:34.860 --> 1:39:37.220
 in ways that increase core body temperature overall,

1:39:37.220 --> 1:39:39.880
 in particular in beige and brown fat,

1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:42.620
 which are these fat cells that exist

1:39:42.620 --> 1:39:44.020
 generally along our spine,

1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:46.140
 and in particular in the upper part of our back,

1:39:46.140 --> 1:39:47.960
 and around our neck and clavicles,

1:39:47.960 --> 1:39:51.860
 and they're responsible for acting as a sort of a candle,

1:39:51.860 --> 1:39:55.940
 or I should say the fuel or the fat of a candle

1:39:55.940 --> 1:40:00.260
 that can be burned up to manufacture heat in the body.

1:40:00.260 --> 1:40:02.300
 So if you normally think about fat

1:40:02.300 --> 1:40:03.560
 and you think about blubbery fat,

1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:05.100
 you're thinking about white fat,

1:40:05.100 --> 1:40:06.660
 which again is just a storage site.

1:40:06.660 --> 1:40:09.680
 Beige fat and brown fat exist at just a few locations,

1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:13.060
 mainly internally around our spinal cord and our clavicles,

1:40:13.060 --> 1:40:15.160
 and those fat stores are responsible

1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:16.580
 for generating heat in our body,

1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:20.560
 so they are very metabolically active form of fat.

1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:23.820
 Small children have a lot of brown fat and beige fat,

1:40:23.820 --> 1:40:26.980
 in particular because very young children can't shiver,

1:40:26.980 --> 1:40:28.660
 and a number of you probably didn't know that,

1:40:28.660 --> 1:40:30.360
 but very young children can't shiver,

1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:31.860
 so they need some way to generate heat

1:40:31.860 --> 1:40:33.480
 in order to make sure that they stay alive

1:40:33.480 --> 1:40:35.020
 if they were ever to get cold.

1:40:35.020 --> 1:40:37.140
 This is also probably the reason why little kids

1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:39.700
 can run around on a cold day outside without their shirt on

1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:40.840
 and they don't even seem to notice

1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:43.060
 whereas adults are freezing cold.

1:40:43.060 --> 1:40:45.740
 As we get older, the amount of beige and brown fat

1:40:45.740 --> 1:40:50.740
 tends to either reduce or shrink or disappear entirely,

1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:53.000
 it's still debated, which happens,

1:40:53.000 --> 1:40:55.840
 but we know that white fat can be converted

1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:59.860
 to this more metabolically active form of beige fat

1:40:59.860 --> 1:41:01.960
 by deliberate cold exposure,

1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:03.860
 according to the protocol I talked about earlier,

1:41:03.860 --> 1:41:07.340
 and now it seems, based on this new study,

1:41:07.340 --> 1:41:12.340
 that local heating of skin tissue can also induce UCP-1

1:41:12.340 --> 1:41:15.540
 and the effects of UCP-1 on increasing mitochondria,

1:41:15.540 --> 1:41:19.140
 and in fact, that local hyperthermia,

1:41:19.140 --> 1:41:23.160
 41 degrees Celsius, that is 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit,

1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:25.860
 can actually induce the conversion

1:41:25.860 --> 1:41:27.960
 of white fat to beige fat.

1:41:27.960 --> 1:41:28.980
 Now that's pretty interesting,

1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:31.020
 and I can already predict the way this is probably going to

1:41:31.020 --> 1:41:33.340
 go in the kind of wellness and biohacking

1:41:33.340 --> 1:41:34.360
 and longevity communities.

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:36.560
 I'm sure that pretty soon there are going to be

1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:39.140
 people putting heating pads on different fat pads

1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:40.900
 of theirs on their body, trying to reduce

1:41:40.900 --> 1:41:43.580
 or at least convert the white fat into beige fat,

1:41:43.580 --> 1:41:44.740
 and who knows, maybe that'll work.

1:41:44.740 --> 1:41:47.300
 There have not been many controlled studies of this yet.

1:41:47.300 --> 1:41:49.720
 This is the first, at least to my knowledge,

1:41:49.720 --> 1:41:53.620
 of such studies looking at this in non-burn conditions.

1:41:53.620 --> 1:41:56.260
 Nonetheless, the data are mechanistically

1:41:56.260 --> 1:41:59.580
 even more interesting than this whole business about UCP-1,

1:41:59.580 --> 1:42:00.500
 and here's why.

1:42:01.660 --> 1:42:04.300
 Local hyperthermia, using the protocol

1:42:04.300 --> 1:42:08.020
 that I described before, resulted in the increase

1:42:08.020 --> 1:42:11.140
 of a promoter, which is essentially a mechanism

1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:14.900
 by which certain genes regulate their activity.

1:42:14.900 --> 1:42:18.980
 This is a DNA binding of something called HSF-1.

1:42:18.980 --> 1:42:21.060
 We don't have to go too deep into the mechanism here

1:42:21.060 --> 1:42:25.220
 or the nomenclature, but HSF stands for heat shock factor 1

1:42:25.220 --> 1:42:30.220
 and HSF-1 binding to a particular location in the genome

1:42:32.540 --> 1:42:36.140
 allowed for a different molecule with a very long name.

1:42:36.140 --> 1:42:37.340
 I'll just tell it to you for fun,

1:42:37.340 --> 1:42:40.300
 but you can just let the numbers and letters stream by.

1:42:40.300 --> 1:42:41.140
 It's not important.

1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:45.340
 HNRNPA2B1 shortened to A2B1,

1:42:45.340 --> 1:42:47.460
 which frankly is not that short to begin with.

1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:49.900
 A2B1 is still a name that should be meaningless

1:42:49.900 --> 1:42:52.340
 to most everybody, but here's what's really cool.

1:42:52.340 --> 1:42:57.100
 A2B1 is directly involved in glucose and lipid metabolism

1:42:57.100 --> 1:42:59.820
 and regulates the genes that control

1:42:59.820 --> 1:43:01.700
 glucose and lipid metabolism.

1:43:01.700 --> 1:43:04.580
 So here we have a situation where local heating of skin

1:43:04.580 --> 1:43:08.180
 converted a metabolically sluggish or inactive cell type,

1:43:08.180 --> 1:43:13.180
 the white fat cell, into the metabolically charging,

1:43:13.540 --> 1:43:18.340
 so to speak, beige fat cell, which in turn led to systemic,

1:43:18.340 --> 1:43:20.700
 meaning body-wide increases in metabolism

1:43:20.700 --> 1:43:21.780
 through two mechanism.

1:43:21.780 --> 1:43:24.800
 One mechanism is this increase in UCP-1,

1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:25.980
 which for those of you that want to know,

1:43:25.980 --> 1:43:30.020
 UCP-1 causes shifts in the way that potential energy

1:43:30.020 --> 1:43:33.340
 is pushed from the protons through the mitochondria,

1:43:33.340 --> 1:43:34.900
 basically more mitochondrial function,

1:43:34.900 --> 1:43:37.340
 which means more ATP, which means cells are more active,

1:43:37.340 --> 1:43:39.460
 AKA increased metabolism,

1:43:39.460 --> 1:43:42.140
 and increases in things like heat shock factor one

1:43:42.140 --> 1:43:45.780
 and A2B1, which are involved in lipid and glucose metabolism

1:43:45.780 --> 1:43:46.880
 and regulation.

1:43:46.880 --> 1:43:48.900
 So I want to be very clear.

1:43:48.900 --> 1:43:52.100
 This study does not say that spot reduction is possible

1:43:52.100 --> 1:43:54.040
 with local heating of tissue.

1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:56.880
 I just can see it now that once this paper gets out

1:43:56.880 --> 1:43:58.700
 into the press, people are going to say,

1:43:58.700 --> 1:44:01.540
 oh, heating up a certain patch of skin is going to burn fat

1:44:01.540 --> 1:44:04.540
 or convert fat to some other cell type at that location.

1:44:04.540 --> 1:44:06.300
 Sorry, that's not the way it works.

1:44:07.220 --> 1:44:11.300
 They did observe increases in beige fat cells

1:44:11.300 --> 1:44:13.560
 at certain locations in the body,

1:44:13.560 --> 1:44:16.100
 but those increases in beige fat occurred

1:44:16.100 --> 1:44:18.720
 where beige fat cells always reside,

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:22.400
 around the spine, the upper neck, the clavicles, and so on.

1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:24.220
 This is exciting because it provides

1:44:24.220 --> 1:44:26.100
 yet another potential mechanism

1:44:26.100 --> 1:44:28.740
 in addition to deliberate cold exposure

1:44:28.740 --> 1:44:31.820
 to increase beige fat, meaning the metabolically

1:44:31.820 --> 1:44:34.020
 active form of fat cell.

1:44:34.020 --> 1:44:36.520
 It also nicely provides a mechanism,

1:44:36.520 --> 1:44:40.480
 or at least a potential mechanism for the observation

1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:44.460
 that burn either small patch of skin being burned,

1:44:44.460 --> 1:44:48.460
 or again, sadly, large patches of skin being burned,

1:44:48.460 --> 1:44:52.740
 leading to these very extreme and very long lasting

1:44:52.740 --> 1:44:56.540
 increases in body fat loss and metabolism.

1:44:56.540 --> 1:44:58.900
 What, if anything, should you do with this information?

1:44:58.900 --> 1:45:02.580
 Well, first of all, I want to very much caution people

1:45:02.580 --> 1:45:05.060
 about putting anything so hot

1:45:05.060 --> 1:45:08.180
 that it can damage the surface of your skin onto your skin.

1:45:08.180 --> 1:45:10.020
 That would be a terrible idea.

1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:14.660
 However, I do predict a time not too far from now

1:45:14.660 --> 1:45:17.000
 where people will start to explore

1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.980
 the use of local skin heating as a means

1:45:19.980 --> 1:45:24.300
 to increase the conversion of white to beige fat,

1:45:24.300 --> 1:45:26.580
 and in turn for beige fat stores

1:45:26.580 --> 1:45:28.160
 to increase metabolism overall,

1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:31.640
 and maybe even improve glucose metabolism and thermogenesis.

1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:33.540
 If you'd like more details about this study,

1:45:33.540 --> 1:45:37.020
 we will provide a link to it in the show notes caption.

1:45:37.020 --> 1:45:38.740
 I should mention that the study,

1:45:38.740 --> 1:45:41.460
 at least the portion of the study that was focused on humans

1:45:41.460 --> 1:45:45.220
 involved roughly equal numbers of males and females.

1:45:45.220 --> 1:45:47.780
 The subjects followed their normal daily schedule,

1:45:47.780 --> 1:45:49.740
 including time and composition of meals, they say,

1:45:49.740 --> 1:45:51.940
 rest and active hours, et cetera, et cetera.

1:45:51.940 --> 1:45:55.820
 The local hyperthermia therapy was done in the following way.

1:45:55.820 --> 1:45:58.140
 Here I'm paraphrasing from their method section.

1:45:58.140 --> 1:46:00.820
 The subjects were seated in upright posture.

1:46:00.820 --> 1:46:03.360
 They were wearing a standard test robe

1:46:03.360 --> 1:46:05.300
 with the head and neck and shoulders unclothed

1:46:05.300 --> 1:46:08.180
 and one meter away from a thermal imaging camera,

1:46:08.180 --> 1:46:10.340
 which could basically measure the temperature

1:46:10.340 --> 1:46:12.940
 at their skin surface to make sure that it remained

1:46:12.940 --> 1:46:15.240
 constant across subjects and yet safe.

1:46:16.100 --> 1:46:18.900
 The supraclavicular fat deposits,

1:46:18.900 --> 1:46:21.220
 meaning the upper shoulders and upper back area

1:46:21.220 --> 1:46:22.660
 were exposed to this thermal source,

1:46:22.660 --> 1:46:26.660
 again, 41 degrees for 20 minutes, okay?

1:46:26.660 --> 1:46:29.340
 So it was 41 degrees for 20 minutes

1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:31.860
 and their core temperatures and skin temperatures

1:46:31.860 --> 1:46:34.020
 were monitored before and after

1:46:34.020 --> 1:46:35.900
 this local hyperthermic therapy.

1:46:35.900 --> 1:46:39.140
 The subjects were exposed to this local hyperthermia therapy

1:46:39.140 --> 1:46:41.180
 three days per week, separated by day,

1:46:41.180 --> 1:46:42.400
 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

1:46:42.400 --> 1:46:46.300
 So they had weekends off for five weeks total

1:46:46.300 --> 1:46:48.220
 after which their data were collected.

1:46:48.220 --> 1:46:49.540
 And the study has a number of other

1:46:49.540 --> 1:46:52.000
 really interesting features that are sure to lead

1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:54.060
 to increased understanding of both mechanism

1:46:54.060 --> 1:46:56.860
 and new protocols such as analysis of the genes

1:46:56.860 --> 1:46:59.500
 and proteins that are activated downstream

1:46:59.500 --> 1:47:01.380
 of this local hyperthermia therapy.

1:47:01.380 --> 1:47:03.500
 I find these data incredibly interesting

1:47:03.500 --> 1:47:06.580
 in part because of the ways that local hyperthermia therapy

1:47:06.580 --> 1:47:09.280
 mimics deliberate cold exposure therapy,

1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:11.540
 same downstream mechanisms, UCP1

1:47:11.540 --> 1:47:13.420
 and some of the other pathways are involved.

1:47:13.420 --> 1:47:15.600
 And all of that points to a somewhat new

1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:17.960
 but certainly an important concept.

1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:19.740
 Many of you have probably heard of hormesis

1:47:19.740 --> 1:47:23.800
 which is the subjecting of oneself or others I suppose

1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:27.260
 to enough stress to induce an adaptation of some kind.

1:47:27.260 --> 1:47:29.740
 So hormesis is the reason why

1:47:29.740 --> 1:47:32.400
 if you get into cold water repeatedly,

1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:34.760
 at first it's very painful psychologically

1:47:34.760 --> 1:47:36.300
 and over time you get used to it.

1:47:36.300 --> 1:47:37.420
 You never get completely used to it

1:47:37.420 --> 1:47:38.700
 but you get more used to it.

1:47:38.700 --> 1:47:41.980
 Hormesis is also used to describe the adaptation

1:47:41.980 --> 1:47:46.020
 to cardiovascular exercise or to the hard rep sets

1:47:46.020 --> 1:47:48.000
 of resistance training and the growth of muscles

1:47:48.000 --> 1:47:49.160
 or the strengthening of muscles

1:47:49.160 --> 1:47:50.740
 or the improvement in cardiovascular function

1:47:50.740 --> 1:47:52.980
 to endurance exercise and so forth.

1:47:52.980 --> 1:47:55.100
 Hormesis is a somewhat common term nowadays.

1:47:55.100 --> 1:47:57.940
 If you haven't heard it, now you've heard it.

1:47:57.940 --> 1:48:01.180
 In this paper they describe what is called mitohormesis

1:48:01.180 --> 1:48:04.200
 which is in essence the fact that any number

1:48:04.200 --> 1:48:07.900
 of different stressful stimuli provided they activate UCP1

1:48:07.900 --> 1:48:10.060
 and some of these other pathways that I just described

1:48:10.060 --> 1:48:13.780
 like HSF1 can induce changes in the mitochondria

1:48:13.780 --> 1:48:16.340
 that lead to increases in metabolism.

1:48:16.340 --> 1:48:20.260
 So it shouldn't surprise us that cold and heat

1:48:20.260 --> 1:48:22.420
 can both lead to increases in metabolism

1:48:22.420 --> 1:48:25.260
 and conversion of white fat to beige fat.

1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:28.780
 It shouldn't surprise us because both pathways are stress.

1:48:28.780 --> 1:48:32.800
 Local hyperthermia is stress, burn certainly is stress,

1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:35.460
 sauna is a form of stress,

1:48:35.460 --> 1:48:38.320
 deliberate cold exposure is a form of stress,

1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:39.760
 exercise is a form of stress

1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:43.340
 and the adaptation to those stressors is not infinite.

1:48:43.340 --> 1:48:46.540
 All of those protocols, any protocol for that matter

1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:48.660
 is going to be effective because it's going to converge

1:48:48.660 --> 1:48:51.700
 on an existing internal biological mechanism.

1:48:51.700 --> 1:48:55.220
 So there's no unique mechanism for each protocol.

1:48:55.220 --> 1:48:57.140
 Each protocol that I've talked about today

1:48:57.140 --> 1:48:58.900
 whether or not it's five minutes or 20 minutes

1:48:58.900 --> 1:49:01.700
 or four times in a day or three times per week

1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:04.500
 or seven times per week is tickling or pushing

1:49:04.500 --> 1:49:07.500
 or stomping if you will on a given pathway

1:49:07.500 --> 1:49:10.660
 and really activating it to a milder to severe degree.

1:49:10.660 --> 1:49:12.800
 What I've tried to do today is to illustrate

1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:16.160
 the general mechanisms by which heat in particular

1:49:16.160 --> 1:49:18.420
 can activate certain biological pathways

1:49:18.420 --> 1:49:20.380
 so that you can devise protocols

1:49:20.380 --> 1:49:23.100
 that are going to be optimal for you and your needs.

1:49:23.100 --> 1:49:24.940
 So just to briefly recap,

1:49:25.940 --> 1:49:28.580
 if you want to get the greatest growth hormone increases,

1:49:28.580 --> 1:49:33.140
 do sauna or other deliberate heat exposure fairly seldom,

1:49:33.140 --> 1:49:36.240
 probably no more than once per week, maybe even less

1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:37.620
 and do it a lot that day,

1:49:37.620 --> 1:49:39.780
 just make sure that you break it up into multiple sessions.

1:49:39.780 --> 1:49:40.860
 In the study I described earlier,

1:49:40.860 --> 1:49:43.560
 they did four sessions, 30 minutes each,

1:49:43.560 --> 1:49:46.620
 but that was just once a week.

1:49:46.620 --> 1:49:49.080
 If you're interested in the cardiovascular benefits

1:49:49.080 --> 1:49:51.600
 and the potential longevity benefits of sauna,

1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:53.900
 well then it's clear that doing it three to four,

1:49:53.900 --> 1:49:55.140
 maybe even seven times per week

1:49:55.140 --> 1:49:56.980
 is going to be more beneficial than doing it

1:49:56.980 --> 1:49:58.820
 just one or three times per week.

1:49:58.820 --> 1:50:00.620
 It stands to reason that for those of you interested

1:50:00.620 --> 1:50:03.280
 in the general health effects of sauna,

1:50:04.140 --> 1:50:06.460
 about an hour per week broken up into three sessions

1:50:06.460 --> 1:50:09.300
 makes the most sense based on my read of the data.

1:50:09.300 --> 1:50:12.020
 And again, that range of 80 to 100 degrees Celsius

1:50:12.020 --> 1:50:13.620
 is going to be your guide.

1:50:13.620 --> 1:50:15.760
 And in terms of the mental health benefits,

1:50:15.760 --> 1:50:18.220
 it seems that getting a little bit uncomfortable

1:50:18.220 --> 1:50:20.980
 in that heat environment, sauna or otherwise,

1:50:20.980 --> 1:50:23.540
 provided it's safe is going to be the best way

1:50:23.540 --> 1:50:25.460
 to access those mental health effects

1:50:25.460 --> 1:50:29.340
 by way of increasing dynorphin, which as you recall,

1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:32.220
 will then increase the ability of endorphin

1:50:32.220 --> 1:50:34.260
 to have its positive effects on mood

1:50:34.260 --> 1:50:36.260
 after you get out of the sauna

1:50:36.260 --> 1:50:37.940
 or other deliberate heat exposure.

1:50:37.940 --> 1:50:39.780
 And in terms of timing,

1:50:39.780 --> 1:50:43.260
 after a workout of any kind, morning or afternoon,

1:50:43.260 --> 1:50:46.140
 or if you're not doing it after a workout,

1:50:46.140 --> 1:50:47.620
 certainly in the later part of the day

1:50:47.620 --> 1:50:50.220
 is going to be most beneficial as it relates to sleep.

1:50:50.220 --> 1:50:51.800
 But of course, there's a caveat there,

1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:53.200
 which I will mention again,

1:50:53.200 --> 1:50:55.500
 which is that for those of you that have no trouble sleeping

1:50:55.500 --> 1:50:56.340
 because you're exhausted

1:50:56.340 --> 1:50:58.380
 or you're just one of these phenomenal sleepers,

1:50:58.380 --> 1:51:00.780
 well then do it any time of day or night.

1:51:00.780 --> 1:51:02.860
 But for most people doing it later in the day

1:51:02.860 --> 1:51:03.980
 is going to be more beneficial

1:51:03.980 --> 1:51:06.940
 because of the post sauna cooling effect

1:51:06.940 --> 1:51:10.660
 and the relationship between cooling by a degree or more

1:51:10.660 --> 1:51:12.100
 as a way to enter sleep.

1:51:12.100 --> 1:51:14.140
 Thank you for joining me today for my discussion

 please put those in the comment section on YouTube.

1:51:41.540 --> 1:51:43.600
 We do read all the comments.

1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:45.260
 Please also check out the sponsors mentioned

1:51:45.260 --> 1:51:46.660
 at the beginning of today's episode.

1:51:46.660 --> 1:51:49.240
 That is the best way to support this podcast.

1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:51.340
 As also mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

1:51:51.340 --> 1:51:53.800
 we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

1:51:53.800 --> 1:51:57.060
 So if you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

1:51:57.060 --> 1:51:58.400
 you'll find what we firmly believe

1:51:58.400 --> 1:52:00.700
 to be the highest quality supplements available

1:52:00.700 --> 1:52:04.180
 in the specific dosages that match the peer reviewed science

1:52:04.180 --> 1:52:06.320
 and recommendations made on various episodes

1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:08.100
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:52:08.100 --> 1:52:10.340
 You will also find specific protocols

1:52:10.340 --> 1:52:12.700
 of how much to take and when, what time of day,

1:52:12.700 --> 1:52:14.200
 what time of night, et cetera.

1:52:14.200 --> 1:52:16.340
 And you will also find behavioral tools

1:52:16.340 --> 1:52:19.020
 that can synergize with those supplements.

1:52:19.020 --> 1:52:20.500
 Many of you will also be pleased to learn

1:52:20.500 --> 1:52:21.880
 that Momentous Supplements, of course,

1:52:21.880 --> 1:52:24.960
 ships within the United States, but also internationally.

1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:27.580
 If you're not already following us on Instagram or Twitter,

1:52:27.580 --> 1:52:28.420
 please do so.

1:52:28.420 --> 1:52:31.220
 It's Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter.

1:52:31.220 --> 1:52:34.260
 Both places I talk about science and science related tools

1:52:34.260 --> 1:52:37.380
 in short little snippets that often overlap

1:52:37.380 --> 1:52:38.660
 with the contents of the podcast,

1:52:38.660 --> 1:52:41.860
 but often is distinct from the contents of the podcast.

1:52:41.860 --> 1:52:44.020
 In addition, please consider signing up for our newsletter,

1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:45.340
 the Neural Network Newsletter.

1:52:45.340 --> 1:52:48.060
 You can do that by going to HubermanLab.com.

1:52:48.060 --> 1:52:50.140
 I should point out that we do not share your email

1:52:50.140 --> 1:52:53.020
 with anybody and we have a very clear privacy policy

1:52:53.020 --> 1:52:55.780
 that is at that location at HubermanLab.com.

1:52:55.780 --> 1:52:57.860
 The Neural Network Newsletter includes protocols

1:52:57.860 --> 1:52:59.740
 and podcast summaries and other things

1:52:59.740 --> 1:53:01.860
 that we believe people will find useful.

1:53:01.860 --> 1:53:03.940
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:53:03.940 --> 1:53:05.660
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:53:05.660 --> 1:53:30.660
 We'll see you next time.
