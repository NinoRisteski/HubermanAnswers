00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.200
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.200 --> 00:13.060
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.060 --> 00:14.880
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.660
 Today, we are discussing memory,

00:16.660 --> 00:19.320
 in particular, how to improve your memory.

00:19.320 --> 00:21.320
 Now, the study of memory is one that dates back

00:21.320 --> 00:25.360
 many decades, and by now there's a pretty good understanding

00:25.360 --> 00:27.860
 of how memories are formed in the brain,

00:27.860 --> 00:29.300
 the different structures involved,

00:29.300 --> 00:31.240
 and some of the neurochemicals involved.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.640
 We will talk about some of that today.

00:33.640 --> 00:34.800
 Often overlooked, however,

00:34.800 --> 00:37.580
 is that memories are not just about learning.

00:37.580 --> 00:40.160
 Memories are also about placing your entire life

00:40.160 --> 00:41.560
 into a context.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.180
 And that's because what's really special about the brain,

00:44.180 --> 00:46.040
 and in particular, the human brain,

00:46.040 --> 00:48.480
 is its ability to place events in the context

00:48.480 --> 00:52.680
 of past events, the present, and future events,

00:52.680 --> 00:54.960
 and sometimes even combinations of the past and present,

00:54.960 --> 00:57.460
 or present and future, and so on.

00:57.460 --> 00:58.840
 So when we talk about memory,

00:58.840 --> 01:00.280
 what we're really talking about

01:00.280 --> 01:02.360
 is how your immediate experiences

01:02.360 --> 01:06.220
 relate to previous and future experiences.

01:06.220 --> 01:09.320
 Today, I'm going to make clear how that process occurs.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.840
 Even if you don't have a background in biology or psychology,

01:11.840 --> 01:13.120
 I promise to put it into language

01:13.120 --> 01:15.320
 that anyone can access and understand.

01:15.320 --> 01:17.600
 And we are going to talk about the science

01:17.600 --> 01:19.720
 that points to specific tools

01:19.720 --> 01:22.400
 for enhancing learning and memory.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.120
 We're also going to talk about unlearning and forgetting.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.280
 There are, of course, instances

01:26.280 --> 01:28.360
 in which we would like to forget things,

01:28.360 --> 01:30.640
 and that too is a biological process

01:30.640 --> 01:34.520
 for which great tools exist to, for instance,

01:34.520 --> 01:37.320
 eliminate or at least reduce the emotional load

01:37.320 --> 01:39.980
 of our previous experience that you really did not like,

01:39.980 --> 01:43.000
 or that perhaps even was traumatic to you.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.880
 So today, you're going to learn

01:44.880 --> 01:47.340
 about the systems in the brain and body

01:47.340 --> 01:49.320
 that establish memories.

01:49.320 --> 01:51.360
 You're going to learn why certain memories

01:51.360 --> 01:53.300
 are easier to form than others.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.640
 And I'm going to talk about specific tools

01:55.640 --> 01:57.920
 that are grounded in not just one,

01:57.920 --> 02:00.860
 not just a dozen, but well over a hundred studies

02:00.860 --> 02:04.620
 in animals and humans that point to specific protocols

02:04.620 --> 02:07.400
 that you can use in order to stamp down

02:07.400 --> 02:09.960
 learning of particular things more easily.

02:09.960 --> 02:12.600
 And you can also leverage that same knowledge

02:12.600 --> 02:15.260
 to better forget or unload the emotional weight

02:15.260 --> 02:17.540
 of experiences that you did not like.

02:17.540 --> 02:20.360
 We are also going to discuss topics like deja vu

02:20.360 --> 02:21.960
 and photographic memory.

02:21.960 --> 02:24.980
 And for those of you that do not have a photographic memory,

02:24.980 --> 02:25.820
 and I should point out

02:25.820 --> 02:28.480
 that I do not have a photographic memory either.

02:28.480 --> 02:31.360
 Well, you will learn how to use your visual system

02:31.360 --> 02:35.240
 in order to better learn visual and auditory information.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.560
 There are protocols to do this

02:36.560 --> 02:39.100
 grounded in excellent peer reviewed research.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.940
 So while you may not have a true photographic memory,

02:41.940 --> 02:44.160
 by the end of the episode, you will have tools in hand,

02:44.160 --> 02:47.760
 or I should say tools in mind or in eyes and mind

02:47.760 --> 02:51.320
 to be able to encode and remember specific events

02:51.320 --> 02:53.320
 better than you would otherwise.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.880
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

02:54.880 --> 02:56.740
 that this podcast is separate from my teaching

02:56.740 --> 02:58.360
 and research roles at Stanford.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.240
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:00.240 --> 03:02.040
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

03:02.040 --> 03:04.040
 about science and science related tools

03:04.040 --> 03:05.460
 to the general public.

03:05.460 --> 03:06.520
 In keeping with that theme,

03:06.520 --> 03:09.360
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:09.360 --> 03:11.840
 Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.560
 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

03:13.560 --> 03:16.400
 with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking.

03:16.400 --> 03:17.640
 Many times on this podcast,

03:17.640 --> 03:19.680
 I've talked about the incredible relationship

03:19.680 --> 03:21.360
 between temperature and sleep,

03:21.360 --> 03:24.280
 as well as temperature and wakefulness.

03:24.280 --> 03:25.460
 Many people aren't aware of this,

03:25.460 --> 03:28.320
 but waking up in the morning is in part the consequence

03:28.320 --> 03:31.540
 of your body heating up and falling asleep at night

03:31.540 --> 03:34.520
 and remaining in deep sleep is in part the consequence

03:34.520 --> 03:38.160
 of your body temperature dropping by one to three degrees.

03:38.160 --> 03:40.060
 So it's vitally important that the temperature

03:40.060 --> 03:42.660
 of your sleeping environment is controlled.

03:42.660 --> 03:46.160
 I've had trouble over the years falling and staying asleep,

03:46.160 --> 03:47.960
 or I should say falling asleep hasn't been so much

03:47.960 --> 03:49.960
 of an issue for me, but waking up two or three

03:49.960 --> 03:52.080
 or four hours later has been an issue.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.120
 Oftentimes I'm too warm, I need to open a window,

03:54.120 --> 03:57.140
 I need to adjust the temperature of the room and so on.

03:57.140 --> 03:59.120
 Eight Sleep mattress covers are terrific

03:59.120 --> 04:01.880
 because you can program the specific patterns of temperature

04:01.880 --> 04:04.500
 that you want in your bed, or I should say below you,

04:04.500 --> 04:07.160
 coming from the mattress throughout the night.

04:07.160 --> 04:10.280
 So I've programmed my Eight Sleep to put my mattress

04:10.280 --> 04:13.160
 into a state of coolness in order to fall asleep,

04:13.160 --> 04:15.960
 and then to get slightly cooler as the night goes on,

04:15.960 --> 04:17.600
 to get into even deeper sleep,

04:17.600 --> 04:20.840
 and then to warm up as morning approaches.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.840
 As mentioned before, Eight Sleep mattresses can be used

04:22.840 --> 04:25.380
 for cooling and heating, so some of you may actually need

04:25.380 --> 04:28.280
 to heat your mattress, and Eight Sleep's terrific for that.

04:28.280 --> 04:31.120
 For me, I use Eight Sleep to keep the mattress really cool,

04:31.120 --> 04:33.360
 and I have to say, even though I thought I was sleeping

04:33.360 --> 04:36.280
 pretty well before, I have not experienced the sort of sleep

04:36.280 --> 04:39.000
 that I've been getting with Eight Sleep until now,

04:39.000 --> 04:41.700
 by creating this descending temperature

04:41.700 --> 04:44.000
 in the beginning part of the night, cooler, cooler, cooler,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.760
 and then warming up towards morning,

04:45.760 --> 04:47.520
 it even has a nice little vibration function,

04:47.520 --> 04:49.940
 so I wake up now to a slightly vibrating bed,

04:49.940 --> 04:52.360
 and the sleep that I'm getting is just amazing,

04:52.360 --> 04:55.320
 and I feel so much better during the day as a consequence.

04:55.320 --> 04:56.720

05:11.440 --> 05:14.240
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.

05:14.240 --> 05:17.280
 Thesis makes custom nootropics, and to be quite honest,

05:17.280 --> 05:19.100
 I don't like the word nootropics,

05:19.100 --> 05:21.600
 because nootropics means smart drugs,

05:21.600 --> 05:25.600
 and there really isn't a neuroscience of smart.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.680
 Of course, there is this notion of intelligence,

05:27.680 --> 05:29.180
 but we now know there are lots of different forms

05:29.180 --> 05:30.280
 of intelligence.

05:30.280 --> 05:31.660
 Also, as a neuroscientist,

05:31.660 --> 05:33.280
 we don't really think about intelligence,

05:33.280 --> 05:36.000
 we think about the particular types of operations

05:36.000 --> 05:38.980
 that you want your brain to perform in different contexts.

05:38.980 --> 05:42.480
 So for instance, some tasks and life experiences

05:42.480 --> 05:45.560
 require that you remember information better.

05:45.560 --> 05:48.800
 Other tasks and life experiences and forms of learning

05:48.800 --> 05:50.840
 involve focus and task switching.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.320
 Others, creativity, and so on and so on.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.600
 So the word nootropics is too much of a catchall

05:55.600 --> 05:58.480
 or throwaway phrase to appeal to me.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.040
 Thesis understands this, and what they've done

06:01.040 --> 06:04.240
 is they've created nootropics that are each designed

06:04.240 --> 06:06.240
 toward a particular end goal.

06:06.240 --> 06:09.040
 For instance, they have blends for focus,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.320
 blend for motivation, a blend for clarity.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.680
 They use only the highest quality ingredients,

06:13.680 --> 06:16.480
 things like Alpha GPC and phosphatidylserine.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.440
 I've been using Thesis for close to six months now,

06:18.440 --> 06:20.320
 and I can confidently say their nootropics

06:20.320 --> 06:21.880
 have been a game changer for me.

06:22.740 --> 06:26.000
 I often take the clarity formula prior to long bouts of work

06:26.000 --> 06:27.800
 meaning cognitive work and the energy formula

06:27.800 --> 06:29.280
 prior to physical workouts.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.500
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

06:31.500 --> 06:35.160
 you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

06:35.160 --> 06:36.480
 take a three minute quiz,

06:36.480 --> 06:38.520
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

06:38.520 --> 06:40.180
 to try in your first month.

06:40.180 --> 06:42.440

06:46.280 --> 06:49.320
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.720
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:51.720 --> 06:54.200
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:54.200 --> 06:55.780
 to help you better understand your body

06:55.780 --> 06:57.800
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.640
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

07:00.640 --> 07:03.020
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

07:03.020 --> 07:05.280
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

07:05.280 --> 07:07.800
 can only be assessed from a quality blood test.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.600
 One of the challenges with a lot of blood tests

07:09.600 --> 07:11.320
 and DNA tests out there, however,

07:11.320 --> 07:12.840
 is that you'll get the numbers back,

07:12.840 --> 07:14.440
 you get information about your blood lipids

07:14.440 --> 07:15.960
 and hormones and so forth,

07:15.960 --> 07:16.960
 but there are no directives

07:16.960 --> 07:18.840
 as to what to do with that information.

07:18.840 --> 07:20.460
 Inside Tracker has solved that problem

07:20.460 --> 07:22.960
 by creating a very easy to use dashboard.

07:22.960 --> 07:24.080
 So you'll get your numbers back

07:24.080 --> 07:26.000
 and you can see what's in range and what's out of range.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.640
 And then they will point you

07:27.640 --> 07:31.600
 to specific nutritional supplementation and behavioral tools

07:31.600 --> 07:33.360
 that will allow you to bring those numbers

07:33.360 --> 07:35.240
 into the proper ranges for you.

07:35.240 --> 07:37.220
 I find that immensely beneficial

07:37.220 --> 07:38.880
 because just having a bunch of data

07:38.880 --> 07:40.960
 without any knowledge of what to do with that data

07:40.960 --> 07:43.680
 is more overwhelming than having no data at all, frankly.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.120
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

07:45.120 --> 07:48.000
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

07:48.000 --> 07:50.760
 to get 20% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

07:50.760 --> 07:53.120
 Again, that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman

07:53.120 --> 07:54.800
 to get 20% off.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.340
 Okay, let's talk about memory

07:56.340 --> 07:57.840
 and let's talk about how to get better

07:57.840 --> 07:59.400
 at remembering things.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.220
 Now, in order to address both of those things,

08:01.220 --> 08:04.480
 we need to do a little bit of brain science 101 review.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.560
 And I promise this will only take two minutes.

08:06.560 --> 08:08.880
 And I promise that even if you don't have a background

08:08.880 --> 08:10.640
 in biology, it will make sense.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.780
 We are constantly being bombarded with physical stimuli,

08:15.720 --> 08:17.400
 patterns of touch on our skin,

08:17.400 --> 08:19.360
 light to our eyes,

08:19.360 --> 08:21.100
 light to our skin for that matter,

08:21.100 --> 08:23.820
 smells, tastes, and sound waves.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.640
 In fact, if you can hear me saying this right now,

08:25.640 --> 08:28.020
 well, that's the consequence of sound waves

08:28.020 --> 08:30.080
 arriving into your ears through headphones,

08:30.080 --> 08:32.680
 a computer, or some other speaker device.

08:32.680 --> 08:35.560
 Each one of, and all of those sensory stimuli

08:35.560 --> 08:39.120
 are converted into electricity and chemical signals

08:39.120 --> 08:40.400
 by your so-called nervous system,

08:40.400 --> 08:41.600
 your brain, your spinal cord,

08:41.600 --> 08:43.880
 and all their connections with the organs of the body

08:43.880 --> 08:46.560
 and all the connections of your organs of the body

08:46.560 --> 08:48.460
 back to your brain and spinal cord.

08:48.460 --> 08:50.640
 One of the primary jobs of your nervous system, in fact,

08:50.640 --> 08:53.020
 is to convert physical events in the world

08:53.020 --> 08:54.920
 that are non-negotiable, right?

08:54.920 --> 08:56.680
 Photons of light are photons of light.

08:56.680 --> 08:57.800
 Sound waves are sound waves.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.140
 There's no changing that.

08:59.140 --> 09:01.120
 But your nervous system does change that.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.280
 It converts those things into electrical signals

09:04.280 --> 09:05.720
 and chemical signals,

09:05.720 --> 09:08.200
 which are the language of your nervous system.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.600
 Now, just because you're being bombarded

09:09.600 --> 09:10.880
 with all this sensory information

09:10.880 --> 09:12.840
 and it's being converted into a language

09:12.840 --> 09:14.820
 that neurons and the rest of your nervous system

09:14.820 --> 09:18.360
 can understand does not mean that you are aware of it all.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.040
 In fact, you are only going to perceive a small amount

09:22.040 --> 09:23.760
 of that sensory information.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.400
 For instance, if you can hear me speaking right now,

09:26.400 --> 09:28.440
 you are perceiving my voice,

09:28.440 --> 09:31.600
 but you are also most likely neglecting the feeling

09:31.600 --> 09:32.680
 of the contact of your skin

09:32.680 --> 09:34.960
 with whichever surface you happen to be sitting

09:34.960 --> 09:36.720
 or standing on.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.740
 So it is only by perceiving a subset,

09:39.740 --> 09:42.800
 a small fraction of the sensory events in our environment

09:42.800 --> 09:44.400
 that we can make sense of the world around us.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.280
 Otherwise we would just be overwhelmed

09:46.280 --> 09:47.620
 with all the things that are happening

09:47.620 --> 09:49.480
 in any one given moment.

09:49.480 --> 09:54.480
 Now, memory is simply a bias in which perceptions

09:54.480 --> 09:57.200
 will be replayed again in the future.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.980
 Anytime you experience something,

09:58.980 --> 10:01.560
 that is the consequence of specific chains of neurons

10:01.560 --> 10:04.320
 that we call neural circuits being activated.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.540
 And memory is simply a bias in the likelihood

10:07.540 --> 10:09.560
 that that specific chain of neurons

10:09.560 --> 10:12.080
 will be activated again.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.440
 So for instance, if you can remember your name,

10:14.440 --> 10:16.440
 and I certainly hope that you can,

10:16.440 --> 10:19.600
 well, that means that there are specific chains of neurons

10:19.600 --> 10:22.120
 in your brain that represent your name.

10:22.120 --> 10:25.200
 And when those neurons connect with one another

10:25.200 --> 10:27.380
 and communicate electrically with one another

10:27.380 --> 10:30.680
 in a particular sequence, you remember your name.

10:30.680 --> 10:34.200
 Were that particular chain of neurons to be disrupted,

10:34.200 --> 10:36.400
 you would not be able to remember your name.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.960
 Now, this might seem immensely simple,

10:37.960 --> 10:40.800
 but it raises this really interesting question,

10:40.800 --> 10:42.960
 which we talked about before,

10:42.960 --> 10:45.720
 which is why do we remember certain things and not others?

10:45.720 --> 10:49.040
 Because according to what I've just said,

10:49.040 --> 10:50.140
 as you go through life,

10:50.140 --> 10:51.880
 you're experiencing things all the time.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.840
 You're constantly being bombarded with sensory stimuli.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.880
 Some of those sensory stimuli you perceive,

10:56.880 --> 10:59.260
 and only some of those perceptions

10:59.260 --> 11:02.020
 get stamped down as memories.

11:02.020 --> 11:03.040
 Today, I'm going to teach you

11:03.040 --> 11:05.880
 how certain things get stamped down as memories.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.800
 And I'm going to teach you how to leverage that process

11:08.800 --> 11:11.160
 in order to remember the information that you want

11:11.160 --> 11:12.320
 far better.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.840
 Now, even though I've told you that a memory

11:13.840 --> 11:15.320
 is simply a bias in the likelihood

11:15.320 --> 11:17.560
 that a particular chain of neurons will be activated

11:17.560 --> 11:20.960
 in a particular sequence again and again,

11:20.960 --> 11:23.260
 it doesn't operate on its own.

11:23.260 --> 11:25.620
 In fact, most of what we remember

11:25.620 --> 11:29.200
 takes place in a context of other events.

11:29.200 --> 11:32.780
 So for instance, you can most likely remember your name,

11:32.780 --> 11:35.480
 and yet you're probably not thinking about

11:35.480 --> 11:38.040
 when it was that you first learned your name.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.560
 This generally happens when we are very, very young children.

11:41.560 --> 11:45.200
 And yet I'm guessing you could probably remember

11:45.200 --> 11:47.560
 a time when someone mispronounced your name

11:47.560 --> 11:49.280
 or made fun of your name,

11:49.280 --> 11:51.160
 or as the case was for me,

11:51.160 --> 11:53.840
 I got to the third grade and there were two Andrews.

11:53.840 --> 11:56.880
 And sadly for me, I lost the coin flip

11:56.880 --> 11:58.120
 that allowed me to keep Andrew.

11:58.120 --> 12:02.460
 And from about third grade until about 12th grade,

12:02.460 --> 12:04.980
 people called me Andy, which I really did not prefer.

12:04.980 --> 12:07.060
 So if you call me Andy in the comments,

12:07.060 --> 12:07.900
 I'll delete your comment.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.980
 Just kidding, doesn't bother me that much.

12:09.980 --> 12:13.440
 But eventually I reclaimed Andrew as my name.

12:13.440 --> 12:15.460
 Well, it was mine to begin with and throughout,

12:15.460 --> 12:18.300
 but I started going by Andrew again.

12:18.300 --> 12:19.140
 Why do I say this?

12:19.140 --> 12:22.140
 Well, there's a whole context to my name for me.

12:22.140 --> 12:24.520
 And there may or may not be a whole context

12:24.520 --> 12:25.640
 to your name for you,

12:25.640 --> 12:27.000
 but presumably if you asked your parents

12:27.000 --> 12:28.960
 why they named you your given name,

12:28.960 --> 12:30.940
 you'll get a context, et cetera.

12:30.940 --> 12:33.800
 That context reflects the activation

12:33.800 --> 12:35.980
 of other neural circuits that are also related

12:35.980 --> 12:37.320
 to other events in your life,

12:37.320 --> 12:40.480
 not just your name, but probably your siblings names

12:40.480 --> 12:43.000
 and who your parents are and on and on and on.

12:43.000 --> 12:47.200
 And so the way memory works is that each individual thing

12:47.200 --> 12:49.000
 that we remember or that we want to remember

12:49.000 --> 12:51.680
 is linked to something by either a close,

12:51.680 --> 12:54.520
 a medium or a very distant association.

12:54.520 --> 12:56.880
 This turns out to be immensely important.

12:56.880 --> 13:01.080
 I know many of you will read or will encounter programs

13:01.080 --> 13:03.360
 that are designed to help you enhance your memory.

13:03.360 --> 13:06.480
 You have these phenoms that can remember 50 names

13:06.480 --> 13:08.060
 in a room full of people,

13:08.060 --> 13:11.060
 or they can remember a bunch of names of novel objects

13:11.060 --> 13:12.840
 or maybe even in different languages.

13:12.840 --> 13:15.520
 And oftentimes that's done by association.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.040
 So people will come up with little mental tricks

13:18.040 --> 13:22.500
 to either link the sound of a word or the meaning of a word

13:22.500 --> 13:23.860
 in some way that's meaningful for them

13:23.860 --> 13:25.520
 and will enhance their memory.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.080
 That can be done and is impressive when we see it.

13:28.080 --> 13:30.320
 And for those of you who can do that, congratulations.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.060
 Most of us can't do that,

13:32.060 --> 13:35.240
 or at least it requires a lot of effort and training.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.520
 However, there are things that we can do

13:37.520 --> 13:40.720
 that leverage the natural biology of our nervous system

13:40.720 --> 13:43.720
 to enhance learning and memory of particular perceptions

13:43.720 --> 13:45.920
 and particular information.

13:45.920 --> 13:48.420
 Let's first just talk about the most basic ways

13:48.420 --> 13:49.880
 that we learn and remember things

13:49.880 --> 13:52.160
 and how to improve learning and memory.

13:52.160 --> 13:55.120
 And the most basic one is repetition.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.120
 Now the study of memory and the role of repetition

13:58.120 --> 14:01.640
 actually dates back to the late 1800s, early 1900s,

14:01.640 --> 14:03.400
 when Ebbinghaus developed

14:03.400 --> 14:06.040
 the first so-called learning curves.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.880
 Now learning curves are simply what results

14:08.880 --> 14:11.520
 when you quantify how many repetitions of something

14:11.520 --> 14:15.120
 are required in order to remember something.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.760
 In fact, it's been said that Ebbinghaus

14:16.760 --> 14:19.320
 liberated the understanding of learning

14:19.320 --> 14:22.520
 from the philosophers by generating these learning curves.

14:22.520 --> 14:23.340
 What do you mean by that?

14:23.340 --> 14:27.000
 Well, before Ebbinghaus came along,

14:27.000 --> 14:31.440
 learning and memory were thought to be philosophical ideas.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.480
 Ebbinghaus came along and said,

14:33.480 --> 14:36.000
 well, let's actually take some measurements.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.200
 Let's measure how well I can remember a sequence of words

14:39.200 --> 14:41.640
 or a sequence of numbers if I just repeat them.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.320
 So what Ebbinghaus did is he would take

14:43.320 --> 14:46.320
 a sequence of numbers or words on a page

14:46.320 --> 14:47.680
 and he would read them.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.760
 And then he would take a separate sheet of paper

14:50.760 --> 14:52.720
 and we have to presume he didn't cheat.

14:52.720 --> 14:55.040
 And he would write down as many of them as he could

14:55.040 --> 14:57.140
 and he would try and keep them in the same sequence.

14:57.140 --> 14:58.960
 Then he would compare to the original list

14:58.960 --> 15:00.780
 and he would see how many errors he made.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.340
 And you do this over and over and over again.

15:03.340 --> 15:07.440
 And as you would expect early in the training

15:07.440 --> 15:10.180
 and the learning, it took a lot more repetitions

15:10.180 --> 15:11.360
 to get the sequence correct.

15:11.360 --> 15:13.900
 And over time, it took fewer sequences.

15:13.900 --> 15:15.560
 And he referred to that difference

15:15.560 --> 15:18.040
 in the initial number of repetitions

15:18.040 --> 15:21.720
 that he had to perform versus the later number

15:21.720 --> 15:23.460
 of repetitions that he had to perform

15:23.460 --> 15:25.140
 as a so-called savings.

15:25.140 --> 15:26.940
 So he literally thought of the brain

15:26.940 --> 15:30.640
 as having to generate a kind of a currency of effort.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.000
 And he talked about savings as the reduction

15:34.000 --> 15:36.360
 in the amount of effort that he had to put forward

15:36.360 --> 15:37.760
 in order to learn information.

15:37.760 --> 15:38.920
 And what he got was a learning curve.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.640
 And you can imagine what that learning curve looked like.

15:40.640 --> 15:42.580
 It was at a very sharp peak at the beginning

15:42.580 --> 15:44.360
 that dropped off over time.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.240
 And of course he remembered all this meaningless information

15:47.240 --> 15:50.200
 but even though the information might've been meaningless,

15:50.200 --> 15:52.960
 the experiment itself and what Ebbinghaus demonstrated

15:52.960 --> 15:55.740
 was immensely meaningful because what it said

15:55.740 --> 15:57.760
 was that with repetition,

15:57.760 --> 16:01.600
 we can activate particular sequences of neurons.

16:01.600 --> 16:04.600
 And that repeated activation lays down

16:04.600 --> 16:06.080
 what we call a memory.

16:06.080 --> 16:07.800
 And that might all seem like a big duh,

16:07.800 --> 16:09.960
 but prior to Ebbinghaus, none of that was known.

16:09.960 --> 16:12.140
 Now I should also say Ebbinghaus,

16:12.140 --> 16:13.540
 because of when he was alive,

16:13.540 --> 16:16.200
 was not aware of these things that we call neural circuits.

16:16.200 --> 16:20.360
 It was in 1906 that Golgi and Cajal got the Nobel prize

16:20.360 --> 16:22.800
 for actually showing that neurons are independent cells

16:22.800 --> 16:23.920
 connected by synapses,

16:23.920 --> 16:26.220
 these little gaps between them where they communicate.

16:26.220 --> 16:27.800
 So he may have been aware of that,

16:27.800 --> 16:29.140
 but the whole notion of neural circuits

16:29.140 --> 16:30.440
 hadn't really come about.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.760
 Nevertheless, what the Ebbinghaus learning curves

16:32.760 --> 16:36.360
 really established was that sheer repetition,

16:36.360 --> 16:39.220
 just repeating things over and over and over again,

16:39.220 --> 16:41.500
 is sufficient to learn.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.560
 Something that no doubt had been observed before,

16:43.560 --> 16:46.840
 but it had never been formally quantified.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.240
 Now, if we look at that result,

16:50.240 --> 16:51.420
 there's something really important

16:51.420 --> 16:53.160
 that lies a little bit cryptic,

16:53.160 --> 16:55.520
 that's not so obvious to most people,

16:55.520 --> 16:58.880
 which is the information that he was trying to learn

16:58.880 --> 17:01.440
 wasn't any more interesting the second time

17:01.440 --> 17:02.760
 than it was the first,

17:02.760 --> 17:04.680
 probably was even less interesting

17:04.680 --> 17:06.840
 and less and less interesting with each repetition.

17:06.840 --> 17:09.140
 And yet it was sheer repetition

17:09.140 --> 17:11.920
 that allowed him to remember.

17:11.920 --> 17:15.040
 Now, sometime later in the early to mid 1920s,

17:15.040 --> 17:17.500
 a psychologist in Canada named Donald Hebb

17:17.500 --> 17:20.040
 came up with what was called Hebb's postulate.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.060
 And Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking,

17:23.060 --> 17:26.920
 is this idea that if a sequence of neurons

17:26.920 --> 17:31.500
 is active at the same time or at roughly the same time,

17:31.500 --> 17:33.880
 that that would lead to a strengthening of the connections

17:33.880 --> 17:35.380
 between those neurons.

17:35.380 --> 17:38.480
 And many, many decades of experimentation later,

17:38.480 --> 17:41.020
 we now know that postulate to be true.

17:42.080 --> 17:44.780
 Neurons themselves are not smart.

17:44.780 --> 17:46.420
 They don't have knowledge.

17:46.420 --> 17:49.660
 So every memory is the consequence, as I told you before,

17:49.660 --> 17:53.320
 of the repeated activation of a particular chain of neurons.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.640
 And what Ebbinghaus showed through repetition

17:55.640 --> 17:59.200
 and what Donald Hebb proposed and was eventually verified

17:59.200 --> 18:02.320
 through experimentation on animals and humans

18:02.320 --> 18:06.480
 was that if you encourage the co-activation of neurons,

18:06.480 --> 18:11.240
 meaning have neurons fire at roughly the same time,

18:11.240 --> 18:12.960
 they will strengthen their connections.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.920
 It leads to a bias in the probability

18:14.920 --> 18:17.160
 that those neurons will be active again.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.480
 Now, this is vitally important

18:18.480 --> 18:20.840
 because nowadays we hear a lot about

18:20.840 --> 18:22.760
 how memories are the consequence

18:22.760 --> 18:25.460
 of new neurons added in the brain,

18:25.460 --> 18:28.360
 or that every time you learn something,

18:28.360 --> 18:30.780
 a new connection in your brain forms.

18:30.780 --> 18:31.800
 Well, sorry to break it to you,

18:31.800 --> 18:34.100
 but that's simply not the case.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.360
 Most of the time, and I want to emphasize most,

18:36.360 --> 18:38.940
 not all, but most of the time when we learn something,

18:38.940 --> 18:42.400
 it's because existing neurons, not new neurons,

18:42.400 --> 18:45.480
 but existing neurons strengthen their connection

18:45.480 --> 18:48.960
 through co-activation over and over and over

18:48.960 --> 18:53.080
 through repetition, or, and this is a very important or,

18:53.080 --> 18:58.080
 or through very strong activation once and only once.

18:58.100 --> 18:59.880
 In fact, there's something called one trial learning

18:59.880 --> 19:01.980
 whereby we experience something

19:01.980 --> 19:05.320
 and we will remember that thing forever.

19:05.320 --> 19:08.080
 This is often most associated with negative events,

19:08.080 --> 19:10.000
 and I'll explain why in a few minutes,

19:10.000 --> 19:12.960
 but it can also be associated with positive events,

19:12.960 --> 19:16.960
 like the first time you saw your romantic partner

19:16.960 --> 19:19.660
 or something that happened with that romantic partner,

19:19.660 --> 19:22.400
 or the first time that you saw your child,

19:22.400 --> 19:23.920
 or any other positive event,

19:23.920 --> 19:26.820
 as well as any other extremely negative event.

19:26.820 --> 19:29.280
 So again, both repetition and,

19:29.280 --> 19:31.880
 I guess we could label it intensity,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.640
 but what we really mean when we say intensity

19:33.640 --> 19:37.240
 is strong activation of neurons can lay down these traces,

19:37.240 --> 19:41.640
 these circuits that are far more likely to be active again,

19:41.640 --> 19:43.840
 than had there not been repetition

19:43.840 --> 19:47.200
 or not some strong activation of those circuits.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.320
 So with that in mind,

19:48.320 --> 19:51.860
 let's return to the original contrarian question

19:51.860 --> 19:52.720
 that I raised before,

19:52.720 --> 19:55.760
 which is why do we remember anything?

19:55.760 --> 19:57.400
 Every day you wake up,

19:57.400 --> 20:00.160
 your neurons in your brain and body are active,

20:00.160 --> 20:01.760
 different neural circuits are active,

20:01.760 --> 20:04.120
 and yet you only remember a small fraction

20:04.120 --> 20:05.520
 of the things that happen each day,

20:05.520 --> 20:08.040
 and yet you retain a lot of information from previous days

20:08.040 --> 20:10.560
 and the days before those and so on.

20:10.560 --> 20:14.240
 It is only with a lot of repetition

20:14.240 --> 20:17.080
 or with extremely strong activation

20:17.080 --> 20:20.080
 of a given neural circuit that we will create new memories.

20:20.080 --> 20:20.920
 And so in a few minutes,

20:20.920 --> 20:24.000
 I'll explain how to get extremely strong activation

20:24.000 --> 20:25.980
 of particular neural circuits.

20:25.980 --> 20:29.080
 Repetition is pretty obvious, repetition is repetition,

20:29.080 --> 20:30.600
 but in a few minutes,

20:30.600 --> 20:33.000
 I'll illustrate a whole set of experiments

20:33.000 --> 20:34.340
 and a whole set of tools

20:34.340 --> 20:38.140
 that point to how you can get extra strong activation

20:38.140 --> 20:40.600
 of a given neural circuit as it relates to learning

20:40.600 --> 20:43.160
 so that you will remember that information,

20:43.160 --> 20:45.840
 perhaps not just with one trial of learning,

20:45.840 --> 20:48.480
 but certainly with far fewer repetitions

20:48.480 --> 20:50.380
 than would be required otherwise.

20:50.380 --> 20:51.520
 Before we go any further,

20:51.520 --> 20:53.020
 I want to preface the discussion by saying

20:53.020 --> 20:55.040
 that there are a lot of different kinds of memory.

20:55.040 --> 20:58.280
 In fact, were you to take a voyage into the neuroscience

20:58.280 --> 21:00.180
 and or psychology of memory,

21:00.180 --> 21:02.440
 you would find an immense number of different terms

21:02.440 --> 21:05.760
 to describe the immense number of different types of memory

21:05.760 --> 21:07.880
 that researchers focus on.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.680
 But for sake of today's discussion,

21:09.680 --> 21:11.760
 really just want to focus on short-term memory,

21:11.760 --> 21:14.400
 medium-term memory, and long-term memory.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.320
 And while there's still debate,

21:16.320 --> 21:18.480
 as is always the case with scientists, frankly,

21:18.480 --> 21:19.640
 about the exact divisions

21:19.640 --> 21:22.120
 between short-term, medium, and long-term memory,

21:22.120 --> 21:26.740
 we can broadly define short-term memory and long-term memory

21:26.740 --> 21:29.200
 and we can describe a couple of different types of those

21:29.200 --> 21:32.020
 that I think you can relate to in your everyday life.

21:32.020 --> 21:33.660
 The most common form of short-term memory

21:33.660 --> 21:36.160
 that we're going to focus on is called working memory.

21:36.160 --> 21:39.720
 Working memory is your ability to keep a chain of numbers

21:39.720 --> 21:41.880
 in mind for some period of time,

21:41.880 --> 21:44.180
 but the expectation really isn't

21:44.180 --> 21:46.800
 that you would remember those numbers the next day

21:46.800 --> 21:48.220
 and certainly not the next week.

21:48.220 --> 21:49.800
 So a good example would be a phone number.

21:49.800 --> 21:53.480
 If I were to tell you a phone number, 493-2938,

21:53.480 --> 21:56.960
 well, you could probably remember it, 493-2938.

21:56.960 --> 21:59.440
 But if I came back tomorrow and asked you

21:59.440 --> 22:02.440
 to repeat that chain of numbers, most likely you would not,

22:02.440 --> 22:05.180
 unless of course we used a particular tool

22:05.180 --> 22:07.180
 to stamp down that memory into your mind

22:07.180 --> 22:10.040
 and commit it to long-term memory.

22:10.040 --> 22:11.580
 Now, of course, in this day and age,

22:11.580 --> 22:14.840
 most people have phone numbers programmed into their phone.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.620
 They don't really have to remember the exact numbers.

22:16.620 --> 22:20.900
 It's usually done by contact identity and so forth.

22:20.900 --> 22:21.960
 So a different example

22:21.960 --> 22:24.060
 that some of you are probably more familiar with

22:24.060 --> 22:25.880
 would be those security codes.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.160
 So you try and log on to an app or a website

22:28.160 --> 22:29.860
 and it asks you for a security code

22:29.860 --> 22:31.560
 that's been sent to your text messages,

22:31.560 --> 22:33.940
 and then you can either plug that in directly in some cases,

22:33.940 --> 22:35.360
 or you have to remember that short sequence

22:35.360 --> 22:37.600
 of anywhere usually from six to seven,

22:37.600 --> 22:38.800
 sometimes eight numbers.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.880
 Your ability to do that, to switch back and forth

22:40.880 --> 22:45.560
 between web pages or apps and plug in that number

22:45.560 --> 22:47.800
 by remembering the sequence and plugging it in

22:47.800 --> 22:50.800
 by texting or keying it in on your keyboard,

22:50.800 --> 22:53.120
 that's a really good example of working memory.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.400
 Long-term memory of the sort

22:54.400 --> 22:56.440
 that we're going to be talking a lot about today

22:56.440 --> 22:59.320
 is your ability to commit certain patterns of information,

22:59.320 --> 23:02.640
 either cognitive information or motor information, right?

23:02.640 --> 23:05.560
 The ability to move your limbs in a particular sequence

23:05.560 --> 23:06.720
 over long periods of time,

23:06.720 --> 23:10.260
 such that you could remember it a day or a week or a month,

23:10.260 --> 23:12.880
 or maybe even a year or several years later.

23:12.880 --> 23:14.600
 So we've got short-term memory and long-term memory,

23:14.600 --> 23:15.920
 and we've got this working memory,

23:15.920 --> 23:18.140
 which is kind of keeping something online,

23:18.140 --> 23:20.000
 but then discarding it, okay?

23:20.000 --> 23:23.680
 Not online on a computer, but online within your brain.

23:23.680 --> 23:25.400
 There are also two major categories of memory

23:25.400 --> 23:26.540
 that I'd like you to know about.

23:26.540 --> 23:28.460
 One is explicit memory.

23:28.460 --> 23:31.140
 So this is not necessarily explicit of the sort

23:31.140 --> 23:32.960
 that you're used to thinking about,

23:32.960 --> 23:36.420
 but rather the fact that you can declare you know something.

23:36.420 --> 23:39.520
 So you have an explicit memory of your name.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.720
 Presumably you have an explicit memory

23:41.720 --> 23:44.320
 of the house or the apartment that you grew up in.

23:44.320 --> 23:46.680
 You know something and you know you know it,

23:46.680 --> 23:47.700
 and you can declare it.

23:47.700 --> 23:48.620
 So I can ask you,

23:48.620 --> 23:51.800
 what was the color of the first car that you owned?

23:51.800 --> 23:56.640
 Or what is the color of your romantic partner's hair?

23:56.640 --> 23:57.480
 These sorts of things.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.740
 That's an explicit declarative memory,

23:59.740 --> 24:04.080
 but you also have explicit procedural memories.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.320
 Now, procedural memories, as the name suggests,

24:06.320 --> 24:08.960
 involve action sequences.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.620
 The simplest one, it's almost ridiculously simple,

24:11.620 --> 24:12.460
 is walking.

24:12.460 --> 24:15.320
 If I say, how is it that you walk from one room

24:15.320 --> 24:16.460
 to the other, you'd probably say,

24:16.460 --> 24:17.960
 well, I go that direction, then I turn left.

24:17.960 --> 24:18.820
 I say, no, no, no, no.

24:18.820 --> 24:20.720
 How is it exactly that you do it?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.240
 And say, well, I move my left foot,

24:22.240 --> 24:24.080
 then my right foot, then my left foot.

24:24.080 --> 24:25.880
 And you could describe that.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.940
 So it's an explicit procedural memory.

24:27.940 --> 24:30.660
 So much so that if you were going to teach a young toddler

24:30.660 --> 24:32.660
 how to walk, you would probably say,

24:32.660 --> 24:33.840
 okay, good, good, try.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.920
 Okay, and you, you know,

24:34.920 --> 24:37.600
 probably that's going to be pre-language for the toddler,

24:37.600 --> 24:40.040
 but you're going to encourage them to move one leg

24:40.040 --> 24:40.880
 than the other.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.080
 And you're going to encourage and reward them

24:43.080 --> 24:44.700
 for moving one leg than the other,

24:44.700 --> 24:47.400
 because you have an explicit procedural memory

24:47.400 --> 24:49.280
 of how to walk, okay?

24:49.280 --> 24:50.580
 Almost ridiculously simple,

24:50.580 --> 24:52.680
 maybe even truly ridiculously simple.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.640
 But nonetheless, when you think about it

24:54.640 --> 24:56.640
 in the context of neural circuits and neural firing,

24:56.640 --> 24:58.240
 pretty amazing.

24:58.240 --> 25:03.240
 Even more amazing is the fact that all explicit memories,

25:03.960 --> 25:07.880
 both declarative and procedural explicit memories,

25:07.880 --> 25:11.960
 can be moved from explicit to implicit.

25:11.960 --> 25:12.960
 What do I mean by that?

25:12.960 --> 25:15.520
 Well, in the example of walking,

25:15.520 --> 25:16.600
 you might've chuckled a little bit

25:16.600 --> 25:18.160
 or kind of shook your head and said,

25:18.160 --> 25:19.720
 that's a ridiculous thing to ask.

25:19.720 --> 25:21.180
 How do I walk from one room to the next?

25:21.180 --> 25:22.920
 I just walk, I just do it.

25:22.920 --> 25:24.960
 Ah, well, what is just do it?

25:24.960 --> 25:28.380
 What it is is that you have an implicit understanding,

25:28.380 --> 25:31.640
 meaning your nervous system knows how to walk

25:32.920 --> 25:35.460
 without you actually having to think about

25:35.460 --> 25:37.120
 what you know about how to walk.

25:37.120 --> 25:38.400
 You just get up out of your chair

25:38.400 --> 25:40.460
 or you get up out of bed and you walk.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.240
 In the brain, you have a structure.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.960
 In fact, you have one on each side of your brain.

25:45.960 --> 25:47.440
 It's called the hippocampus.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.880
 The hippocampus literally means seahorse.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.800
 Anatomists like to name brain structures after things

25:52.800 --> 25:55.480
 that they think those brain structures resemble.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.080
 When I look at the hippocampus,

25:57.080 --> 25:58.960
 frankly, it doesn't look like a seahorse,

25:58.960 --> 26:01.440
 which either reflects my lack of understanding

26:01.440 --> 26:03.800
 of what a seahorse really looks like, a visual deficit,

26:03.800 --> 26:06.240
 or I think it's fair to say that those anatomists

26:06.240 --> 26:09.800
 were using a little bit of creative elaboration

26:09.800 --> 26:12.240
 when thinking about what the hippocampus looks like.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.360
 Nonetheless, it is a curved structure.

26:15.360 --> 26:17.200
 It has many layers.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.680
 It's been described by my colleague, Robert Sapolsky,

26:19.680 --> 26:22.600
 and by others as looking more like a jelly roll

26:22.600 --> 26:25.720
 or a cinnamon roll is what it looks like to me.

26:25.720 --> 26:28.000
 And if you were to take one cinnamon roll,

26:28.000 --> 26:29.680
 chop it down the middle.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.000
 So now you've got two half cinnamon rolls

26:32.000 --> 26:33.920
 and rather than put them back together

26:33.920 --> 26:35.520
 in the configuration they were before,

26:35.520 --> 26:37.360
 you just slide one down

26:37.360 --> 26:40.160
 so that you've got essentially two C's,

26:40.160 --> 26:43.400
 two C-shaped halves of the cinnamon roll

26:43.400 --> 26:45.440
 and you push them together,

26:45.440 --> 26:47.200
 slightly offset from one another.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.320
 Well, that's what the hippocampus looks like to me.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.560
 And I think that's a far better description

26:51.560 --> 26:53.320
 of its actual physical structure.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.560
 But I guess if you were to use that physical structure

26:56.560 --> 26:57.800
 as the name, well, then you'd have to open up

26:57.800 --> 26:59.720
 a brain atlas and it would be called

26:59.720 --> 27:02.100
 two half C cinnamon rolls stuffed halfway together.

27:02.100 --> 27:02.940
 So that's not very good.

27:02.940 --> 27:04.600
 So I guess seahorse will work.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.140
 Hippocampus is the name of this structure

27:07.140 --> 27:10.180
 and it is the site in your brain.

27:10.180 --> 27:13.120
 And again, you have one on each side of your brain

27:13.120 --> 27:17.480
 in which explicit declarative memories are formed.

27:17.480 --> 27:21.220
 It is not where those memories are stored and maintained.

27:21.220 --> 27:23.980
 It is where they are established in the first place.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.120
 In contrast, implicit memories, right?

27:28.120 --> 27:31.600
 These subconscious memories are formed

27:31.600 --> 27:34.320
 and stored elsewhere in the brain,

27:34.320 --> 27:36.160
 mainly by areas like the cerebellum,

27:36.160 --> 27:37.320
 but also the neocortex,

27:37.320 --> 27:39.200
 the kind of outer shell of your brain.

27:39.200 --> 27:42.200
 The cerebellum is, it literally means mini brain.

27:42.200 --> 27:44.280
 And it does in fact look like a mini brain

27:44.280 --> 27:45.680
 and is in the back of the brain.

27:45.680 --> 27:47.920
 And the neocortex is the outer part of the brain

27:47.920 --> 27:49.920
 that covers all the other stuff.

27:49.920 --> 27:53.420
 So the hippocampus is vitally important

27:53.420 --> 27:56.200
 for establishing these new declarative memories

27:56.200 --> 28:00.240
 of what you know and what you know how to do.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.040
 Now, in order to really understand

28:02.040 --> 28:03.680
 the role of the hippocampus in memory,

28:03.680 --> 28:06.240
 in particular explicit declarative

28:06.240 --> 28:08.000
 and explicit procedural memory,

28:08.000 --> 28:10.340
 and to really understand how that's distinct

28:10.340 --> 28:15.340
 from implicit declarative and implicit procedural memories,

28:15.940 --> 28:17.820
 we have to look to a clinical case.

28:17.820 --> 28:19.280
 And the clinical case that I'm referring to

28:19.280 --> 28:22.140
 is a patient who went by the name HM.

28:22.140 --> 28:23.800
 Patients go by their initials

28:23.800 --> 28:27.520
 in order to maintain confidentiality of their real identity.

28:27.520 --> 28:31.500
 HM had what's called intractable epilepsy.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.760
 So he would have these really dramatic

28:33.760 --> 28:37.120
 so-called grand mal seizures or drop seizures.

28:37.120 --> 28:39.540
 For those of you that know somebody with epilepsy

28:39.540 --> 28:43.680
 or that have epilepsy, you might be familiar with this.

28:43.680 --> 28:47.080
 You can have petite mal seizures, which are minor seizures.

28:47.080 --> 28:48.540
 You can have tonic-clonic seizures,

28:48.540 --> 28:50.320
 which are sometimes not even detectable.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.840
 You can have absent seizures where people will just stop.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.000
 It's almost as if their brain goes on pause

28:55.000 --> 28:55.840
 and they'll just stop there.

28:55.840 --> 28:59.120
 It was reported actually that Einstein had absent seizures,

28:59.120 --> 28:59.960
 although I don't know that

28:59.960 --> 29:02.900
 that's ever really been confirmed neurologically.

29:04.640 --> 29:06.800
 Grand mal seizures are extremely severe

29:06.800 --> 29:08.180
 and that's what HM had.

29:08.180 --> 29:10.160
 So he could just be going about his day

29:10.160 --> 29:13.480
 and maybe even cooking or doing something, driving,

29:13.480 --> 29:14.740
 operating any kind of machinery,

29:14.740 --> 29:17.480
 and then all of a sudden he would just have a drop seizure

29:17.480 --> 29:18.920
 so he would just physically drop

29:18.920 --> 29:20.360
 and go into a grand mal seizure.

29:20.360 --> 29:22.200
 So convulsing of the whole body,

29:22.200 --> 29:24.280
 loss of consciousness, et cetera.

29:24.280 --> 29:26.320
 Or he would feel it coming on.

29:26.320 --> 29:27.680
 Oftentimes people with epilepsy

29:27.680 --> 29:29.680
 can feel the epilepsy seizure coming on

29:29.680 --> 29:32.260
 kind of like a wave from the back of the brain.

29:32.260 --> 29:34.340
 And sometimes they can get to a safe circumstance,

29:34.340 --> 29:35.200
 but not always.

29:35.200 --> 29:38.240
 And so the frequency and the intensity of his seizures

29:38.240 --> 29:41.840
 were so robust that the neurosurgeons and neurologists

29:41.840 --> 29:44.400
 decided that they needed to locate the origin,

29:44.400 --> 29:47.560
 what they call the foci of those seizures

29:47.560 --> 29:49.480
 and remove that brain tissue

29:49.480 --> 29:52.040
 because the way seizures work is they spread out

29:52.040 --> 29:56.500
 from that focus or that foci of brain tissue.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.000
 And unfortunately for HM,

29:59.000 --> 30:02.200
 the focus of his seizures was the hippocampus.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.480
 So after a lot of deliberation, a neurosurgeon,

30:05.480 --> 30:07.560
 in fact, one of the most famous neurosurgeons

30:07.560 --> 30:08.920
 in the world at that time

30:09.900 --> 30:11.840
 made what are called electrolytic lesions,

30:11.840 --> 30:16.200
 actually burned out the hippocampus in the brain of HM.

30:16.200 --> 30:20.840
 And as a consequence, he lost all explicit memory.

30:20.840 --> 30:23.480
 Now, the consequence of this was that he couldn't exist

30:23.480 --> 30:26.080
 in normal, everyday life, like most people.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.840
 So he had to live mostly, not entirely,

30:28.840 --> 30:31.960
 but mostly in a kind of hospital setting.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.960
 And I've talked to several people who have,

30:34.960 --> 30:37.920
 who I should say, who met HM directly

30:37.920 --> 30:39.960
 because he's no longer alive,

30:39.960 --> 30:44.160
 but an interaction with him might look like the following.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.880
 He would walk up to you just fine.

30:45.880 --> 30:49.240
 You wouldn't know that he had any kind of brain damage.

30:49.240 --> 30:50.440
 He could walk fine.

30:50.440 --> 30:51.440
 He could speak fine.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.360
 And he'd say, hi, I'm Andrew.

30:53.360 --> 30:55.960
 And he'd say, hi, I'm whatever his name happened to be.

30:55.960 --> 30:58.720
 He wouldn't say HM, but he'd probably say his real name.

30:58.720 --> 31:02.200
 And then perhaps someone new would walk into the room.

31:02.200 --> 31:03.880
 He might turn around, look at that person

31:03.880 --> 31:05.640
 as any of us might do,

31:05.640 --> 31:09.040
 then turn around back to me and say,

31:09.040 --> 31:10.360
 hi, what's your name?

31:10.360 --> 31:12.480
 And if I were to say, well, I just told you my name

31:12.480 --> 31:14.720
 and you just told me your name, do you remember that?

31:14.720 --> 31:16.780
 He'd say, I'm sorry, I don't remember any of that.

31:16.780 --> 31:17.620
 What's your name?

31:17.620 --> 31:19.200
 So you had to go through this over and over again.

31:19.200 --> 31:22.840
 So a complete lack of explicit declarative memory.

31:22.840 --> 31:27.600
 Now, he did have some memory for previous events

31:27.600 --> 31:30.180
 in his life that dated way back, okay?

31:30.180 --> 31:33.360
 Again, hinting at the idea that memories

31:33.360 --> 31:36.440
 are not necessarily stored in the hippocampus.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.920
 They're just formed in the hippocampus.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.480
 So once they've moved out of the hippocampus

31:39.480 --> 31:42.260
 to other brain areas, he could still keep those memories.

31:42.260 --> 31:43.960
 They're in a different database, if you will.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.440
 They're in a different pattern of firing

31:45.440 --> 31:48.280
 of other neural circuits, but he couldn't form new memories.

31:48.280 --> 31:51.220
 Now there's some very important and interesting twists

31:51.220 --> 31:53.440
 on what HM could and could not do

31:53.440 --> 31:55.160
 in terms of learning and memory

31:55.160 --> 31:56.800
 that teach us a lot about the brain.

31:56.800 --> 31:59.080
 In fact, I think most neuroscientists would agree

31:59.080 --> 32:02.120
 that this unfortunate case of HM's epilepsy

32:02.120 --> 32:04.600
 and the subsequent neurosurgery that he had

32:04.600 --> 32:07.280
 taught us much of what we know, or at least think about

32:07.280 --> 32:09.660
 in terms of human learning and memory.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.600
 For instance, as I mentioned before,

32:11.600 --> 32:13.920
 he still had implicit knowledge.

32:13.920 --> 32:14.800
 He knew how to walk.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.840
 He knew how to do certain things like make a cup of coffee.

32:17.840 --> 32:21.380
 He knew the names of people that he had met

32:21.380 --> 32:23.900
 much earlier in his life and so on.

32:23.900 --> 32:26.040
 And yet he couldn't form new memories.

32:26.040 --> 32:29.380
 Now, in violation to that last statement,

32:29.380 --> 32:32.920
 there were some elements of HM's emotionality

32:32.920 --> 32:36.520
 that suggests that there was some sort of residual capacity

32:36.520 --> 32:38.060
 to learn new information,

32:38.060 --> 32:40.500
 but it wasn't what we normally think of

32:40.500 --> 32:43.080
 as explicit declarative or procedural memory.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.800
 For instance, it's been reported,

32:45.800 --> 32:47.520
 or it's been said, I should say,

32:47.520 --> 32:49.560
 because I don't know that the studies were ever done

32:49.560 --> 32:51.840
 with intense physiological measurements,

32:51.840 --> 32:54.820
 that if you were to tell HM a joke

32:54.820 --> 32:58.180
 and he thought it was funny, he would laugh really hard.

32:58.180 --> 32:59.580
 Though he liked jokes, so you'd tell him,

32:59.580 --> 33:01.760
 you'd say, HM, I want to tell you a joke.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.940
 You tell him a joke and he'd laugh really hard.

33:03.940 --> 33:06.000
 Then you could leave the room, come back,

33:06.000 --> 33:07.960
 and tell him the same joke again.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.700
 Now, keep in mind, he did not remember

33:09.700 --> 33:11.680
 that you told him the joke previously.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.600
 And the second time he would laugh a little bit less.

33:14.600 --> 33:17.240
 And then you'd leave the room, come back again,

33:17.240 --> 33:18.680
 say, hi, I'm Andrew.

33:18.680 --> 33:19.640
 And he'd say, oh, nice to meet you,

33:19.640 --> 33:22.000
 because as you recall,

33:22.000 --> 33:23.040
 because you can recall things,

33:23.040 --> 33:24.440
 but he couldn't recall things.

33:24.440 --> 33:25.800
 He didn't know that he just met you,

33:25.800 --> 33:27.240
 or at least he couldn't remember it.

33:27.240 --> 33:29.340
 You tell him the joke a third time or a fourth time.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.720
 And with each subsequent telling of the joke,

33:31.720 --> 33:33.440
 he found it a little less funny,

33:33.440 --> 33:36.360
 just as, keep this in mind, folks,

33:36.360 --> 33:39.180
 if you tell a joke and you get a big laugh,

33:39.180 --> 33:42.060
 don't tell it again, at least not immediately,

33:42.060 --> 33:44.360
 not to the same person or the same crowd,

33:44.360 --> 33:46.600
 because the second time it's a little less funny,

33:46.600 --> 33:47.980
 and the third time it's a little less funny.

33:47.980 --> 33:50.200
 And that actually has to do with a whole element

33:50.200 --> 33:53.360
 of dopamine and its relationship to surprise.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.260
 And that's the topic of a future podcast

33:55.260 --> 33:58.400
 where we talk all about humor and novelty in the brain.

33:58.400 --> 34:02.140
 But the point being that certain forms of memory

34:02.140 --> 34:05.000
 seem to exist in a kind of phantom-like way

34:05.000 --> 34:06.400
 within HM's brain.

34:06.400 --> 34:07.300
 What do I mean by that?

34:07.300 --> 34:09.880
 Well, this underscores the fact that he had

34:09.880 --> 34:13.640
 an implicit memory of having heard the joke before.

34:13.640 --> 34:16.720
 And it suggests that humor, or at least what we find funny,

34:16.720 --> 34:19.320
 is somehow more related to procedures,

34:19.320 --> 34:21.560
 similar to walking or motor ability,

34:21.560 --> 34:25.940
 than it is to the precise content of that joke.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.480
 That's a little bit of an abstract concept,

34:27.480 --> 34:31.320
 but the point is that HM lacked explicit declarative memory.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.000
 He couldn't tell you what he had just heard.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.120
 He could not learn new information.

34:36.120 --> 34:38.600
 And he couldn't tell you how to do something

34:38.600 --> 34:40.940
 unless he had learned how to do that something

34:40.940 --> 34:42.880
 many years prior.

34:42.880 --> 34:45.620
 Now, there've been a lot of other patients besides HM

34:45.620 --> 34:49.200
 that have had brain lesions due to epilepsy,

34:49.200 --> 34:52.000
 or I should say, due to surgeries to treat epilepsy,

34:52.000 --> 34:55.520
 due to strokes, due to sadly gunshot wounds

34:55.520 --> 34:58.520
 and other forms of what we call infarct,

34:58.520 --> 35:02.920
 infarct, I-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct,

35:02.920 --> 35:05.360
 is the word we use to describe damage

35:05.360 --> 35:07.180
 to a particular brain region.

35:07.180 --> 35:10.240
 And many different patients with many different patterns

35:10.240 --> 35:13.960
 of infarct have taught us a lot about how memory

35:13.960 --> 35:15.720
 and other aspects of the brain work.

35:16.680 --> 35:21.280
 HM really teaches us that what we know

35:21.280 --> 35:24.740
 and what we are able to do is the consequence of things

35:24.740 --> 35:28.200
 that we are aware of and learnings that have been passed off

35:28.200 --> 35:31.000
 into subconscious knowledge, that our body knows,

35:31.000 --> 35:33.920
 our brain knows, but we don't know exactly

35:33.920 --> 35:35.560
 how we know that thing.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.980
 And I tell you the story about HM's ability

35:37.980 --> 35:39.800
 to understand a joke,

35:39.800 --> 35:42.340
 but that with repeated telling of a joke,

35:42.340 --> 35:44.460
 it has less and less and less of an impact

35:44.460 --> 35:49.460
 in creating a sense of laughter, of humor in HM,

35:50.240 --> 35:53.280
 not as just an anecdote to flesh out his story,

35:53.280 --> 35:57.240
 but because emotion itself turns out to be the way

35:57.240 --> 35:59.640
 in which we can enhance memories,

35:59.640 --> 36:02.760
 even if those are memories for things that are not funny,

36:02.760 --> 36:07.120
 are not intensely sad, are not immensely happy,

36:07.120 --> 36:10.160
 or don't evoke a really strong emotional response

36:10.160 --> 36:12.980
 or even any emotional response.

36:12.980 --> 36:15.760
 And the reason for that is that emotions,

36:15.760 --> 36:18.620
 just like perception, just like sensation,

36:18.620 --> 36:21.080
 are the consequence of particular neurochemicals

36:21.080 --> 36:22.720
 being present in our brain and body.

36:22.720 --> 36:24.780
 And as I'm going to tell you next,

36:24.780 --> 36:26.920
 there are particular neurochemicals

36:26.920 --> 36:28.600
 that you can leverage in order

36:28.600 --> 36:31.280
 to learn specific information faster

36:31.280 --> 36:34.160
 and to remember it for a much longer period of time,

36:34.160 --> 36:35.520
 maybe even forever.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.880
 And you can do that by leveraging the relationship

36:37.880 --> 36:41.500
 in your nervous system between your brain and your body

36:41.500 --> 36:44.240
 and your body back to your brain.

36:44.240 --> 36:46.840
 So let's talk about tools for enhancing memory.

36:46.840 --> 36:51.360
 Now there's one tool that is absolutely clear works,

36:51.360 --> 36:53.860
 and it's always worked, it works now,

36:53.860 --> 36:56.240
 and it will work forever.

36:56.240 --> 36:57.480
 And that's repetition.

36:58.320 --> 37:00.480
 The more often that you perform something

37:00.480 --> 37:02.360
 or that you recite something,

37:02.360 --> 37:05.680
 the more likely you are to remember it in the future.

37:05.680 --> 37:07.380
 And while that might seem obvious,

37:07.380 --> 37:09.600
 it's worth thinking about what's happening

37:09.600 --> 37:11.000
 when you repeat something.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.840
 But when I say what's happening, I mean at the neural level.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.660
 What's happening is that you're encouraging the firing

37:16.660 --> 37:18.880
 of particular chains of neurons

37:18.880 --> 37:21.180
 that reside in a particular circuit, right?

37:21.180 --> 37:24.960
 So a particular sequence of neurons playing neuron A, B, C, D

37:24.960 --> 37:26.880
 played in that particular sequence over and over

37:26.880 --> 37:29.440
 and over again, and with more repetitions,

37:29.440 --> 37:33.300
 you get more strengthening of those nerve connections.

37:33.300 --> 37:37.680
 Now, repetition works, but the problem for most people

37:37.680 --> 37:40.020
 is that they either don't have the patience,

37:40.020 --> 37:40.880
 they don't have the time,

37:40.880 --> 37:42.400
 and sometimes they literally don't have the time

37:42.400 --> 37:44.620
 because they've got a deadline on something

37:44.620 --> 37:47.240
 that they're trying to remember and learn,

37:47.240 --> 37:49.400
 or they simply would like to be able

37:49.400 --> 37:51.780
 to remember things better in general,

37:51.780 --> 37:53.820
 remember them more quickly.

37:53.820 --> 37:57.640
 This process of accelerating repetition-based learning

37:57.640 --> 37:59.680
 so that your learning curve doesn't go

37:59.680 --> 38:02.560
 from having to perform something 1,000 times

38:02.560 --> 38:06.320
 and then gradually over time, it's 1,750 times a day,

38:06.320 --> 38:08.560
 500 times a day, 300 times a day,

38:08.560 --> 38:10.400
 and down to no repetitions, right?

38:10.400 --> 38:12.000
 You can just perform that thing

38:12.000 --> 38:13.800
 the first time and every time.

38:13.800 --> 38:16.840
 Well, there is a way to shift that curve

38:16.840 --> 38:20.920
 so that you can essentially establish stronger connections

38:20.920 --> 38:22.840
 between the neurons that are involved

38:22.840 --> 38:26.800
 in generating that memory or behavior more quickly.

38:26.800 --> 38:27.660
 How do you do that?

38:27.660 --> 38:29.220
 Well, in order to answer that,

38:29.220 --> 38:31.760
 we have to look at the beautiful work

38:31.760 --> 38:34.680
 of James McGaugh and Larry Cahill.

38:34.680 --> 38:37.280
 James McGaugh and Larry Cahill did a number of experiments

38:37.280 --> 38:39.240
 over several decades, really,

38:39.240 --> 38:41.440
 based on a lot of animal literature,

38:41.440 --> 38:45.600
 but mainly focused on humans that really established

38:45.600 --> 38:49.600
 what's required to get better at remembering things

38:49.600 --> 38:51.640
 and to do so very quickly.

38:51.640 --> 38:53.860
 I want to talk about one experiment that they did

38:53.860 --> 38:56.000
 that was particularly important,

38:56.000 --> 38:57.540
 and we will provide a link to this paper.

38:57.540 --> 39:00.720
 It's some years old now, but the results still hold up.

39:00.720 --> 39:04.000
 In fact, the results establish an entire field of memory

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
 in neuroscience and psychology.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.900
 What they did is they had human subjects

39:08.900 --> 39:12.080
 come into the laboratory and to read a short paragraph

39:12.080 --> 39:14.440
 of about 12 sentences,

39:14.440 --> 39:18.620
 and the key thing is that some subjects read a paragraph

39:18.620 --> 39:19.900
 that was pretty mundane.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.460
 The content, the information within the paragraph

39:23.460 --> 39:26.340
 was all related to the content of the previous sentence,

39:26.340 --> 39:27.980
 so it was a cogent paragraph, right?

39:27.980 --> 39:30.980
 It just wasn't meaningless scramble of words,

39:30.980 --> 39:35.140
 but it described a kind of mundane set of circumstances.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.780
 Maybe it would be a story about someone who walked

39:37.780 --> 39:40.540
 into a room, sat down at a desk, wrote for a little bit,

39:40.540 --> 39:42.100
 then got up and had lunch,

39:42.100 --> 39:45.700
 just kind of mundane information, not very interesting.

39:45.700 --> 39:50.700
 Another group of subjects read also a 12 sentence paragraph,

39:50.700 --> 39:54.620
 but that paragraph included a subset of sentences

39:54.620 --> 39:58.060
 that had a lot of emotionally intense language,

39:58.060 --> 40:00.500
 or that had language that could evoke

40:00.500 --> 40:03.340
 an emotionally intense response in the person reading it.

40:03.340 --> 40:05.420
 So it might've talked about a car accident

40:05.420 --> 40:07.600
 or a very intense surgery,

40:07.600 --> 40:09.740
 but it also could be positive stuff,

40:09.740 --> 40:12.260
 things like a birthday party

40:12.260 --> 40:15.560
 or a celebration of some other kind or a big sports win.

40:15.560 --> 40:18.420
 So in other words, you have two conditions of this study.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.700
 People either read a boring paragraph

40:20.700 --> 40:23.500
 or they read a really emotionally laden paragraph.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.700
 And again, the emotions could either be positive

40:25.700 --> 40:27.900
 or negative emotions.

40:27.900 --> 40:30.300
 Subjects left the laboratory and sometime later,

40:30.300 --> 40:32.040
 they were called back to the laboratory.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.700
 And I should say at no point in the experiment

40:34.700 --> 40:37.040
 did they know they were part of a memory experiment, okay?

40:37.040 --> 40:39.020
 They don't know why they're reading this paragraph.

40:39.020 --> 40:41.700
 They came in either for class credit or to get paid.

40:41.700 --> 40:42.900
 It's typically how these things are done

40:42.900 --> 40:45.180
 on college campuses or elsewhere.

40:45.180 --> 40:49.620
 They come back into the lab and they would get a pop quiz.

40:49.620 --> 40:53.520
 They would be asked to recall the content of the paragraph

40:53.520 --> 40:55.700
 that they had read previously.

40:55.700 --> 40:58.880
 As is probably expected, perhaps even obvious to you,

40:59.720 --> 41:03.700
 the subjects that read the emotionally intense paragraph

41:03.700 --> 41:06.500
 remembered far more of the content of that paragraph

41:06.500 --> 41:08.900
 and were far more accurate

41:08.900 --> 41:11.660
 in their remembering of that information.

41:11.660 --> 41:15.460
 Now, that particular finding wasn't very novel.

41:15.460 --> 41:17.380
 Many people had previously described

41:17.380 --> 41:20.540
 how emotionally intense events are better remembered

41:20.540 --> 41:22.780
 than non emotionally intense events.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.600
 In fact, way back in the 1600s, Francis Bacon,

41:25.600 --> 41:29.320
 who's largely credited with developing the scientific method

41:29.320 --> 41:32.120
 said, quote, memory is assisted by anything

41:32.120 --> 41:34.300
 that makes an impression on a powerful passion,

41:34.300 --> 41:38.400
 inspiring fear, for example, or wonder, shame, or joy.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.860
 Francis Bacon said that in 1620.

41:40.860 --> 41:42.700
 So Jim McGaugh and Larry Cahill

41:42.700 --> 41:46.180
 were certainly not the first to demonstrate

41:46.180 --> 41:47.700
 or to conceive of the idea

41:47.700 --> 41:50.060
 that emotionally laden experiences

41:50.060 --> 41:53.460
 are more easily remembered than other experiences.

41:53.460 --> 41:56.800
 However, what they did next was immensely important

41:56.800 --> 41:58.300
 for our understanding of memory

41:58.300 --> 42:00.900
 and for our building of tools

42:00.900 --> 42:03.400
 to enhance learning and memory.

42:03.400 --> 42:08.220
 What they did was they evaluated the capacity for stress

42:08.220 --> 42:11.460
 and for particular neurochemicals associated with stress

42:11.460 --> 42:14.380
 to improve our ability to learn information,

42:14.380 --> 42:17.620
 not just information that is emotional,

42:17.620 --> 42:19.940
 but information of all kinds.

42:19.940 --> 42:21.380
 So I'm going to describe some experiments

42:21.380 --> 42:23.420
 done in animal models just very briefly,

42:23.420 --> 42:26.620
 and then experiments done on human subjects,

42:26.620 --> 42:28.900
 because McGaugh worked mainly on animals,

42:28.900 --> 42:30.080
 also human subjects,

42:30.080 --> 42:32.960
 Larry Cahill almost exclusively on human subjects.

42:32.960 --> 42:37.960
 If you take a rat or a mouse and put it in an arena

42:38.480 --> 42:39.960
 where at one location,

42:39.960 --> 42:43.280
 the animal receives an electrical shock,

42:43.280 --> 42:44.600
 and then you come back the next day,

42:44.600 --> 42:47.280
 you remove the shock evoking device,

42:47.280 --> 42:49.480
 and you let the animal move around that arena,

42:49.480 --> 42:52.600
 that animal will quite understandably avoid the location

42:52.600 --> 42:56.300
 where it was shocked, so-called conditioned place aversion.

42:57.260 --> 43:00.640
 That effect of avoiding that particular location

43:00.640 --> 43:01.780
 occurs in one trial.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.920
 That's a good example of one trial learning.

43:03.920 --> 43:05.960
 So somehow the animal knows

43:05.960 --> 43:08.160
 that it was shocked at that location.

43:08.160 --> 43:12.280
 It remembers that it is a hippocampal dependent learning.

43:12.280 --> 43:14.160
 So animals that lack a hippocampus

43:14.160 --> 43:16.240
 or who have their hippocampus pharmacologically

43:16.240 --> 43:18.580
 or otherwise incapacitated

43:18.580 --> 43:21.880
 will not learn that new bit of information.

43:21.880 --> 43:24.060
 But for animals that do,

43:24.060 --> 43:27.680
 they remember it after the first time and every time,

43:27.680 --> 43:32.080
 unless you are to block the release of certain chemicals

43:32.080 --> 43:32.960
 in the brain and body,

43:32.960 --> 43:36.280
 and the chemicals I'm referring to are epinephrine,

43:36.280 --> 43:40.080
 adrenaline, and to some extent, the corticosterones,

43:40.080 --> 43:41.720
 things like cortisol.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.360
 Now we know that the effect of getting one trial learning

43:44.360 --> 43:46.320
 somehow involves epinephrine,

43:46.320 --> 43:49.160
 at least in this particular experimental scenario,

43:49.160 --> 43:52.880
 because if researchers do the exact same experiment,

43:52.880 --> 43:54.860
 and they have done the exact same experiment,

43:54.860 --> 43:59.400
 but they introduce a pharmacological blocker of epinephrine

43:59.400 --> 44:02.440
 so that epinephrine is released in response to the shock,

44:02.440 --> 44:05.200
 but it cannot actually bind to its receptors

44:05.200 --> 44:07.360
 and have all of its biological effects,

44:07.360 --> 44:10.400
 well, then the animal is perfectly happy to tread back

44:10.400 --> 44:12.680
 into the area where it received the shock.

44:12.680 --> 44:14.280
 It's almost as if it didn't know,

44:14.280 --> 44:17.120
 or we have to assume it didn't remember

44:17.120 --> 44:19.680
 that it received the shock at that location.

44:19.680 --> 44:21.380
 So it all seems pretty obvious when you hear it,

44:21.380 --> 44:22.640
 something bad happens in a location,

44:22.640 --> 44:24.140
 you'll go back to that location.

44:24.140 --> 44:26.380
 So that's conditioned place avoidance,

44:26.380 --> 44:29.160
 but it turns out that the opposite is also true,

44:29.160 --> 44:32.400
 meaning for something called conditioned place preference,

44:32.400 --> 44:34.760
 you can take an animal, put it into an arena,

44:34.760 --> 44:38.760
 feed it or reward it somehow at one location in that arena.

44:38.760 --> 44:41.020
 So you can give a hungry rat or mouse food

44:41.020 --> 44:44.280
 at one particular location, take the animal out,

44:44.280 --> 44:46.580
 come back the next day, no food is introduced,

44:46.580 --> 44:49.160
 but it'll go back to the location where it received the food

44:49.160 --> 44:50.680
 or you can do any variant of this.

44:50.680 --> 44:52.240
 You can make the arena a little bit chilly

44:52.240 --> 44:54.260
 and provide warmth at that location,

44:54.260 --> 44:59.040
 or you can take a male animal and turns out male rats

44:59.040 --> 45:01.360
 and mice will mate at any point or a female animal

45:01.360 --> 45:03.220
 that's at the particular so-called receptive phase

45:03.220 --> 45:05.320
 of her mating cycle and give them an opportunity

45:05.320 --> 45:06.520
 to mate at a given location.

45:06.520 --> 45:08.160
 They'll go back to that location and wait and wait.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.520
 This is perhaps why people go back to the same bar,

45:10.520 --> 45:12.560
 the bar, seat at the bar or the same restaurant

45:12.560 --> 45:14.880
 and wait because of the one time they,

45:14.880 --> 45:18.240
 things worked out for them, whatever the context was.

45:18.240 --> 45:19.860
 Conditioned place preference.

45:19.860 --> 45:24.340
 Conditioned place preference as with conditioned place

45:24.340 --> 45:28.220
 avoidance depends on the release of adrenaline, right?

45:28.220 --> 45:30.180
 It's not just about stress.

45:30.180 --> 45:32.900
 It's about a heightened emotional state

45:32.900 --> 45:34.420
 in the brain and body, okay?

45:34.420 --> 45:35.460
 This is really important.

45:35.460 --> 45:37.260
 It's not just about stress.

45:37.260 --> 45:39.520
 You can get one trial learning for positive events,

45:39.520 --> 45:40.940
 conditioned place preference,

45:40.940 --> 45:45.580
 and you can get one trial learning for negative events.

45:45.580 --> 45:47.280
 Here I say positive, negative.

45:47.280 --> 45:48.740
 I'm putting what's called valence on.

45:48.740 --> 45:50.220
 I'm making a value judgment

45:50.220 --> 45:52.340
 about whether or not the animal liked it or didn't like it.

45:52.340 --> 45:55.180
 And we have to presume what the animal liked or didn't like

45:55.180 --> 45:56.040
 and how it felt,

45:56.040 --> 45:59.820
 but this turns out all to be true for humans as well.

45:59.820 --> 46:03.420
 We know that because McGaugh and Cahill did experiments

46:03.420 --> 46:07.020
 where they gave people a boring paragraph to read

46:07.020 --> 46:09.340
 and only a boring paragraph to read.

46:09.340 --> 46:13.320
 But one group of subjects was asked to read the paragraph

46:13.320 --> 46:17.600
 and then to place their arm into very, very cold water.

46:17.600 --> 46:19.140
 In fact, it was ice water.

46:19.140 --> 46:21.540
 We know that placing one's arm into ice water,

46:21.540 --> 46:25.100
 especially if it's up to the shoulder or near to it,

46:25.100 --> 46:27.500
 evokes the release of adrenaline in the body.

46:27.500 --> 46:28.780
 It's not an enormous release,

46:28.780 --> 46:30.380
 but it's a significant increase.

46:30.380 --> 46:32.920
 And yes, they measured adrenaline release.

46:32.920 --> 46:33.760
 In some cases,

46:33.760 --> 46:36.460
 they also measured for things like cortisol, et cetera.

46:36.460 --> 46:40.980
 And what they found is that if one evokes the release

46:40.980 --> 46:45.780
 of adrenaline through this arm into ice water approach,

46:45.780 --> 46:47.900
 the information that they read previously,

46:47.900 --> 46:51.140
 just a few minutes before, was remembered.

46:51.140 --> 46:55.400
 It was retained as well as emotionally intense information.

46:55.400 --> 46:57.060
 But keep in mind that information that they read

46:57.060 --> 46:58.120
 was not interesting at all,

46:58.120 --> 47:00.980
 or at least it wasn't emotionally laden.

47:00.980 --> 47:03.820
 This had to be the effect of adrenaline released

47:03.820 --> 47:05.180
 into the brain and body,

47:05.180 --> 47:09.840
 because if they blocked the release or the function

47:09.840 --> 47:13.260
 of adrenaline in the brain and or body,

47:13.260 --> 47:14.620
 they could block this effect.

47:14.620 --> 47:17.840
 Now, the biology of epinephrine and cortisol

47:17.840 --> 47:18.900
 are a little bit complex,

47:18.900 --> 47:21.080
 but there's some nuance there that's actually interesting

47:21.080 --> 47:22.020
 and important to us.

47:22.020 --> 47:25.300
 First of all, adrenaline is released in the body

47:25.300 --> 47:26.140
 and in the brain.

47:26.140 --> 47:28.060
 It's released in the body from the adrenals.

47:28.060 --> 47:31.060
 Remember epinephrine and adrenaline are the same thing.

47:31.060 --> 47:33.100
 Cortisol is also released from the adrenal glands,

47:33.100 --> 47:35.600
 these two little glands that ride atop our kidneys,

47:35.600 --> 47:37.460
 but it can't cross into the brain.

47:37.460 --> 47:39.280
 It only has what we call peripheral effects,

47:39.280 --> 47:41.940
 quickening of the heart rate, right?

47:41.940 --> 47:43.640
 Changes the patterns of blood flow,

47:43.640 --> 47:45.040
 changes our patterns of breathing,

47:45.040 --> 47:47.800
 in general makes our breathing more shallow and faster,

47:47.800 --> 47:50.500
 in general makes our heartbeat more quickly, et cetera.

47:51.380 --> 47:52.220
 Within our brain,

47:52.220 --> 47:54.780
 we have a little brain area called locus coeruleus,

47:54.780 --> 47:55.620
 which is in the back of the brain,

47:55.620 --> 47:58.600
 which has the opportunity to sprinkler the rest of the brain

47:58.600 --> 48:01.380
 with the neuromodulator epinephrine, adrenaline,

48:01.380 --> 48:04.220
 as well as norepinephrine, a related neuromodulator,

48:04.220 --> 48:07.520
 and to essentially wake up or create a state of alertness

48:07.520 --> 48:08.580
 throughout the brain.

48:08.580 --> 48:10.600
 So it's a very general effect.

48:10.600 --> 48:12.860
 The reason we have two sites of release

48:12.860 --> 48:15.780
 is because these neurochemicals

48:15.780 --> 48:17.900
 do not cross the blood brain barrier.

48:17.900 --> 48:20.500
 And so waking up the body with adrenaline

48:20.500 --> 48:22.380
 and waking up the brain are two separate

48:22.380 --> 48:24.500
 so-called parallel phenomenon.

48:24.500 --> 48:27.200
 Cortisol can cross the blood brain barrier

48:27.200 --> 48:28.600
 because it's lipophilic,

48:28.600 --> 48:31.640
 meaning it can move through fatty tissue.

48:31.640 --> 48:34.260
 And we'll get into the biology of that in another episode,

48:34.260 --> 48:36.300
 but cortisol in general is released

48:36.300 --> 48:37.920
 and has much longer term effects.

48:37.920 --> 48:39.640
 And as I've just told you can permeate

48:39.640 --> 48:40.740
 throughout the brain and body,

48:40.740 --> 48:42.380
 adrenaline has more local effects

48:42.380 --> 48:45.220
 or at least a segregated between the brain and the body.

48:45.220 --> 48:47.300
 This will turn out to be important later.

48:47.300 --> 48:48.460
 The important thing to keep in mind

48:48.460 --> 48:53.020
 is that it is the emotionality evoked by an experience,

48:53.020 --> 48:55.020
 or to be more precise,

48:55.020 --> 48:57.620
 it is the emotional state that you were in

48:57.620 --> 49:00.940
 after you experienced something

49:00.940 --> 49:02.220
 that dictates whether or not

49:02.220 --> 49:04.600
 you will learn it quickly or not.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.900
 This is absolutely important

49:06.900 --> 49:09.540
 in terms of thinking about tools to improve your memory.

49:09.540 --> 49:11.340
 And no, I am not going to suggest

49:11.340 --> 49:12.620
 that every time you want to learn something,

49:12.620 --> 49:15.220
 you plunge your arm into ice water.

49:15.220 --> 49:16.500
 Why won't I suggest that?

49:16.500 --> 49:20.620
 Well, it will induce the release of adrenaline,

49:20.620 --> 49:22.980
 but there are better ways to get that adrenaline release.

49:22.980 --> 49:25.460
 Before I explain exactly what those tools are,

49:25.460 --> 49:28.560
 I want to tamp down the biology of how all this works,

49:28.560 --> 49:30.580
 because in that understanding,

49:30.580 --> 49:33.400
 you will have access to the best possible tools

49:33.400 --> 49:35.220
 to improve your memory.

49:35.220 --> 49:37.340
 First of all, McGaugh and Cahill

49:37.340 --> 49:38.900
 were excellent experimentalists.

49:38.900 --> 49:43.140
 They did not just establish that you could quicken

49:43.140 --> 49:46.700
 the formation of a memory by accessing material

49:46.700 --> 49:48.000
 that was very emotionally laden

49:48.000 --> 49:51.100
 or creating an emotional high adrenaline state

49:51.100 --> 49:54.300
 after interacting with some thing,

49:54.300 --> 49:57.180
 some word, some person, some information.

49:57.180 --> 49:59.720
 They also tested whether or not that whole effect

49:59.720 --> 50:03.040
 could be blocked by blocking the emotional state

50:03.040 --> 50:04.160
 or by blocking adrenaline.

50:04.160 --> 50:05.900
 So what they did is they had people read paragraphs

50:05.900 --> 50:08.980
 that either had a lot of emotional content

50:08.980 --> 50:11.980
 or they had people read paragraphs that were pretty boring,

50:11.980 --> 50:14.620
 but then had them put their arm into ice water.

50:14.620 --> 50:16.300
 And I should say they did other experiments too,

50:16.300 --> 50:17.380
 to increase adrenaline.

50:17.380 --> 50:18.700
 There are even some shock experiments

50:18.700 --> 50:20.220
 that were done by other groups,

50:20.220 --> 50:22.180
 any number of things to evoke the release of adrenaline,

50:22.180 --> 50:25.540
 even people taking drugs that increase adrenaline.

50:25.540 --> 50:29.020
 But then they also did what are called blocking experiments.

50:29.020 --> 50:31.340
 They did experiments where they had people

50:31.340 --> 50:33.280
 get into a highly emotional state

50:33.280 --> 50:35.620
 from reading highly emotional material

50:35.620 --> 50:36.780
 or they got people to get into

50:36.780 --> 50:38.600
 a highly emotional neurochemical state

50:38.600 --> 50:39.860
 by reading boring material

50:39.860 --> 50:42.500
 and then taking a drug to increase adrenaline

50:42.500 --> 50:44.320
 or ice bath or a shock.

50:44.320 --> 50:47.100
 And then they also administered a drug

50:47.100 --> 50:50.840
 called a beta blocker to block the effect of adrenaline

50:50.840 --> 50:52.940
 and related chemicals in the brain and body.

50:52.940 --> 50:57.420
 And what they found is that even if people were exposed

50:57.420 --> 50:58.940
 to something really emotional

50:58.940 --> 51:02.200
 or had a lot of adrenaline in their system

51:02.200 --> 51:03.220
 because they received a drug

51:03.220 --> 51:04.540
 to increase the amount of adrenaline,

51:04.540 --> 51:06.620
 two manipulations that normally would increase memory,

51:06.620 --> 51:08.040
 keep that in mind,

51:08.040 --> 51:10.480
 if they gave them a beta blocker,

51:10.480 --> 51:13.540
 which reduced the response to that adrenaline, right?

51:13.540 --> 51:14.860
 So no quickening of the heart rate,

51:14.860 --> 51:16.860
 no quickening of the breathing,

51:16.860 --> 51:20.060
 no increase in the activity of locus coeruleus

51:20.060 --> 51:22.700
 and these kind of wake up signals to the rest of the brain.

51:22.700 --> 51:26.000
 Well, then the material wasn't remembered better at all.

51:26.000 --> 51:27.380
 What this tells us is that,

51:27.380 --> 51:30.580
 yes, Francis Bacon was right, McGaugh and Cahill were right.

51:30.580 --> 51:32.660
 Hundreds, if not thousands of philosophers

51:32.660 --> 51:34.460
 and psychologists and neuroscientists

51:34.460 --> 51:38.580
 were right in stating and in thinking

51:38.580 --> 51:42.060
 that high emotional states help you learn things.

51:42.060 --> 51:44.980
 But what McGaugh and Cahill really showed

51:44.980 --> 51:47.000
 and what's most important to know

51:47.000 --> 51:51.840
 is that it is the presence of high adrenaline,

51:51.840 --> 51:54.620
 high amounts of norepinephrine and epinephrine

51:54.620 --> 51:58.140
 and perhaps cortisol as well, as you'll soon see,

51:58.140 --> 52:01.940
 that allows a memory to be stamped down quickly.

52:01.940 --> 52:05.380
 It is not the emotion.

52:05.380 --> 52:08.140
 It is the neurochemical state that you go into

52:08.140 --> 52:10.500
 as a consequence of the emotion.

52:10.500 --> 52:11.740
 And it's very important to understand

52:11.740 --> 52:13.400
 that while those two things are related,

52:13.400 --> 52:15.740
 they are not one and the same thing.

52:15.740 --> 52:20.020
 Because what that means is that were you to evoke

52:20.020 --> 52:23.660
 the release of epinephrine, norepinephrine and cortisol,

52:23.660 --> 52:27.100
 or even just one or two of those chemicals,

52:27.100 --> 52:29.200
 after experiencing something,

52:29.200 --> 52:32.100
 you are stamping down the experience

52:32.100 --> 52:34.220
 that you just previously had.

52:34.220 --> 52:38.120
 This is fundamentally important and far and away different

52:38.120 --> 52:41.260
 than the idea that we remember things

52:41.260 --> 52:42.860
 because they're important to us

52:42.860 --> 52:44.240
 or because they evoke emotion.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.620
 That's true, but the real reason, the neurochemical reason,

52:47.620 --> 52:51.260
 the mechanism behind all that is these neurochemicals

52:51.260 --> 52:54.720
 have the ability to strengthen neural connections

52:54.720 --> 52:57.460
 by making them active just once.

52:57.460 --> 52:59.180
 There's something truly magic about

52:59.180 --> 53:00.740
 that neurochemical cocktail

53:00.740 --> 53:03.180
 that removes the need for repetition.

53:03.180 --> 53:04.700
 Okay, so let's apply this knowledge.

53:04.700 --> 53:08.260
 Let's establish a scientifically grounded set of tools,

53:08.260 --> 53:10.900
 meaning tools that take into account

53:10.900 --> 53:13.020
 the identity of the neurochemicals

53:13.020 --> 53:15.520
 that are important for enhancing learning

53:15.520 --> 53:18.060
 and the timing of the release of those chemicals

53:18.060 --> 53:20.220
 in order to enhance learning.

53:20.220 --> 53:23.500
 When I first learned about the results of McGaugh and Cahill,

53:23.500 --> 53:25.660
 I was just blown away.

53:25.660 --> 53:28.380
 I was also pretty upset, but not with them.

53:28.380 --> 53:30.420
 I was upset with myself because I realized

53:30.420 --> 53:33.000
 that the way that I'd been approaching learning and memory

53:33.000 --> 53:34.460
 was not optimal.

53:34.460 --> 53:37.780
 In fact, it was probably in the opposite direction

53:37.780 --> 53:40.660
 to the enhanced protocol for learning and memory

53:40.660 --> 53:43.060
 that I'm going to teach you today.

53:43.060 --> 53:44.940
 My typical mode of trying to learn something

53:44.940 --> 53:47.980
 while I was in college or while I was in graduate school

53:47.980 --> 53:51.200
 or as a junior professor or even a tenured professor

53:51.200 --> 53:53.600
 was to sit down to whatever it is

53:53.600 --> 53:56.600
 I was going to try and learn, perhaps even memorize,

53:56.600 --> 53:58.060
 or if it was a physical skill,

53:58.060 --> 53:59.540
 move to whatever environment

53:59.540 --> 54:01.540
 I was going to learn that physical skill in.

54:01.540 --> 54:05.700
 And prior to that, to make sure that I was hydrated

54:05.700 --> 54:06.860
 because that's important to me

54:06.860 --> 54:08.140
 and certainly can contribute

54:08.140 --> 54:10.180
 to your brain's ability to function

54:10.180 --> 54:11.980
 and your body's ability to function

54:11.980 --> 54:16.100
 and general patterns of alertness, but also to caffeinate.

54:16.100 --> 54:19.420
 I would have a nice strong cup of coffee or espresso.

54:19.420 --> 54:22.020
 I would have a nice strong cup of yerba mate.

54:22.020 --> 54:27.000
 And I still drink coffee or yerba mate very regularly.

54:27.000 --> 54:30.340
 I drink them in moderation, I think, certainly for me,

54:30.340 --> 54:33.540
 but typically I would drink those things

54:33.540 --> 54:36.220
 before I would engage in any kind of attempt

54:36.220 --> 54:39.220
 to learn or memorize or to acquire a new skill.

54:39.220 --> 54:43.120
 Now, caffeine in the form of coffee or yerba mate

54:43.120 --> 54:45.100
 or any other form of caffeine

54:45.100 --> 54:47.380
 does create a sense of alertness in our brain and body.

54:47.380 --> 54:49.700
 And it does that through two major mechanisms.

54:49.700 --> 54:54.100
 The first mechanism is by blocking the effects of adenosine.

54:54.100 --> 54:56.360
 Adenosine is a molecule that builds up in the brain and body

54:56.360 --> 54:57.900
 the longer that we are awake.

54:57.900 --> 54:59.580
 And it's largely what's responsible

54:59.580 --> 55:02.140
 for our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue

55:02.140 --> 55:04.380
 when we've been awake for a very long time.

55:04.380 --> 55:09.380
 Caffeine essentially acts to block the effects of adenosine.

55:10.620 --> 55:13.600
 It's a competing agonist, not to get technical,

55:13.600 --> 55:16.240
 but it binds to the receptor for adenosine

55:16.240 --> 55:18.140
 for some period of time and prevents adenosine

55:18.140 --> 55:20.020
 from having its normal pattern of action

55:20.020 --> 55:23.780
 and thereby reduces our feelings of fatigue.

55:23.780 --> 55:26.580
 But it also increases state of alertness.

55:26.580 --> 55:28.820
 So while it's reducing fatigue,

55:28.820 --> 55:31.020
 it's also pushing on neurochemical systems

55:31.020 --> 55:32.740
 in order to directly increase our alertness.

55:32.740 --> 55:34.740
 And it does that in large part

55:34.740 --> 55:37.620
 by increasing the transmission of epinephrine,

55:37.620 --> 55:39.540
 adrenaline in the brain and body.

55:39.540 --> 55:41.040
 It also has this interesting effect

55:41.040 --> 55:44.040
 of upregulating the number and or efficiency,

55:44.040 --> 55:48.180
 or we say the efficacy of dopamine receptors

55:48.180 --> 55:50.740
 such that when dopamine is present

55:50.740 --> 55:52.680
 and as a molecule that increases motivation

55:52.680 --> 55:54.060
 and craving and pursuit,

55:54.060 --> 55:56.080
 that dopamine can have a more potent effect

55:56.080 --> 55:57.200
 than it would otherwise.

55:57.200 --> 55:59.240
 So caffeine really hits these three systems.

55:59.240 --> 56:00.240
 It hits other systems too,

56:00.240 --> 56:03.720
 but it mainly reduces fatigue by reducing adenosine,

56:03.720 --> 56:07.220
 increases alertness by increasing epinephrine release

56:07.220 --> 56:08.560
 or adrenaline release, I should say,

56:08.560 --> 56:10.140
 both from the adrenals in your body

56:10.140 --> 56:12.720
 and from locus coeruleus within the brain.

56:12.720 --> 56:16.920
 And it can in parallel to all that increase the action

56:16.920 --> 56:20.140
 or the efficacy of the action of dopamine.

56:20.140 --> 56:22.780
 So my typical way of approaching learning and memory

56:22.780 --> 56:23.980
 would be to drink some caffeine

56:23.980 --> 56:26.280
 and then focus really hard on whatever it is

56:26.280 --> 56:27.500
 that I'm trying to learn,

56:27.500 --> 56:29.500
 trying to eliminate distractions,

56:29.500 --> 56:31.420
 and then hope, hope, hope,

56:31.420 --> 56:33.820
 or try, try, try to remember that information

56:33.820 --> 56:35.420
 as best as I could.

56:35.420 --> 56:37.660
 And frankly, I felt like it was working pretty well for me.

56:37.660 --> 56:40.420
 And typically if I leveraged other forms of pharmacology

56:40.420 --> 56:43.100
 in order to enhance learning and memory,

56:43.100 --> 56:47.420
 things like alpha GPC or phosphatidylserine,

56:47.420 --> 56:50.180
 I would do that by taking those things

56:50.180 --> 56:54.020
 before I sat down to learn a particular set of information

56:54.020 --> 56:57.060
 or before I went off to learn a particular physical skill.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.260
 Now, for those of you out there listening to this,

57:00.260 --> 57:03.100
 you're probably thinking, well, okay,

57:03.100 --> 57:05.900
 the results of McGaugh and Cahill pointed to the fact

57:05.900 --> 57:10.580
 that having adrenaline released after learning something

57:10.580 --> 57:12.540
 enhanced learning of that thing.

57:12.540 --> 57:15.860
 But a lot of these things like caffeine or alpha GPC

57:15.860 --> 57:20.080
 can increase epinephrine and adrenaline or dopamine

57:20.080 --> 57:23.460
 or other molecules in the brain and body

57:23.460 --> 57:25.700
 that can enhance memory for a long period of time.

57:25.700 --> 57:28.740
 So it makes sense to take it first or even during learning

57:28.740 --> 57:31.020
 and then allow that increase to occur

57:31.020 --> 57:33.040
 and the increase will occur over a long period of time

57:33.040 --> 57:35.260
 and will enhance learning and memory.

57:35.260 --> 57:39.540
 And while that is partially true, it is not entirely true.

57:39.540 --> 57:41.820
 And it turns out it's not optimal.

57:41.820 --> 57:44.180
 Work that was done by the McGaugh laboratory

57:44.180 --> 57:47.400
 and other laboratories evaluated

57:47.400 --> 57:50.140
 the precise temporal relationship

57:50.140 --> 57:54.140
 between neurochemical activation of these pathways

57:54.140 --> 57:55.260
 and learning and memory.

57:55.260 --> 57:57.540
 What they did is they had animals and or people,

57:57.540 --> 58:01.540
 depending on the experiment, take a drug, could be caffeine,

58:01.540 --> 58:03.620
 could be in pill form,

58:03.620 --> 58:06.700
 something that would increase adrenaline

58:06.700 --> 58:10.180
 or related molecules that create the state of alertness

58:10.180 --> 58:12.100
 that are related to emotionality.

58:12.100 --> 58:14.460
 And they had them do it either an hour before,

58:14.460 --> 58:17.380
 30 minutes before, 10 minutes before,

58:17.380 --> 58:20.100
 five minutes before learning

58:20.100 --> 58:23.100
 or during the bout of learning, right?

58:23.100 --> 58:24.860
 The reading of the information or the performing

58:24.860 --> 58:26.220
 of the skill that one is trying to learn

58:26.220 --> 58:28.820
 or five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes,

58:28.820 --> 58:30.900
 30 minutes, et cetera, afterwards.

58:30.900 --> 58:33.980
 So they looked very precisely at when exactly is best

58:33.980 --> 58:35.940
 to evoke this adrenaline release.

58:35.940 --> 58:38.260
 And it turns out that the best time window

58:38.260 --> 58:40.660
 to evoke the release of these chemicals,

58:40.660 --> 58:43.260
 if the goal is to enhance learning and memory

58:43.260 --> 58:46.660
 of the material is either immediately after

58:46.660 --> 58:50.840
 or just a few minutes, five, 10, maybe 15 minutes

58:50.840 --> 58:53.900
 after you're repeating that information,

58:53.900 --> 58:55.380
 you're trying to learn that information.

58:55.380 --> 58:57.180
 Again, this could be cognitive information

58:57.180 --> 58:59.200
 or this could be a physical skill.

58:59.200 --> 59:01.680
 Now, this really spits in the face of the way

59:01.680 --> 59:03.980
 that most of us approach learning and memory.

59:03.980 --> 59:08.980
 Most of us, if we use stimulants like caffeine or alpha-GPC,

59:09.500 --> 59:13.140
 we're taking those before or during an attempt to learn,

59:13.140 --> 59:14.440
 not afterwards.

59:15.460 --> 59:16.940
 These results point to the fact

59:16.940 --> 59:19.800
 that it is after the learning and memory

59:19.800 --> 59:23.300
 that you really want to get that big increase in epinephrine

59:23.300 --> 59:25.860
 and the related molecules that will tamp down memory.

59:25.860 --> 59:28.540
 So what this means is that if you are currently using

59:28.540 --> 59:30.540
 caffeine or other compounds,

59:30.540 --> 59:33.140
 and we'll talk about what those are and safety issues

59:33.140 --> 59:34.620
 and so forth in a moment,

59:35.480 --> 59:36.780
 if you're using those compounds

59:36.780 --> 59:38.420
 in order to enhance learning and memory

59:38.420 --> 59:42.560
 by taking them before or during a learning episode,

59:42.560 --> 59:45.060
 well, then I encourage you to try and take them

59:45.060 --> 59:47.340
 either late in the learning episode

59:47.340 --> 59:49.880
 or immediately after the learning episode.

59:49.880 --> 59:51.540
 Now, given everything I've told you up until now,

59:51.540 --> 59:53.460
 why would I say late in the learning episode

59:53.460 --> 59:54.540
 or immediately after?

59:54.540 --> 59:57.160
 Well, when you ingest something by drinking it

59:57.160 --> 59:58.700
 or you take it in capsule form,

59:58.700 --> 59:59.540
 there's a period of time

59:59.540 --> 1:00:01.040
 before that gets absorbed into the body

1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:03.780
 and different substances such as caffeine,

1:00:03.780 --> 1:00:05.180
 alpha-GPC, et cetera,

1:00:05.180 --> 1:00:08.020
 are absorbed in from the gut and into the bloodstream

1:00:08.020 --> 1:00:10.100
 and reach the brain and trigger these effects

1:00:10.100 --> 1:00:11.620
 in the brain and body at different rates.

1:00:11.620 --> 1:00:13.300
 So it's not instantaneous.

1:00:13.300 --> 1:00:14.860
 Some have effects within minutes,

1:00:14.860 --> 1:00:18.300
 others within tens of minutes and so on.

1:00:18.300 --> 1:00:19.540
 It's really going to depend

1:00:19.540 --> 1:00:21.160
 on the pharmacology of those things.

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:22.260
 And it's also going to depend

1:00:22.260 --> 1:00:23.720
 on whether or not you have food in your gut,

1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:25.160
 what else you happen to have circulating

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:26.800
 in your bloodstream, et cetera.

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:28.260
 But at a very basic level,

1:00:28.260 --> 1:00:31.820
 we can confidently say that there are not one,

1:00:31.820 --> 1:00:33.660
 not dozens, but as I mentioned before,

1:00:33.660 --> 1:00:35.900
 hundreds of studies in animals and in humans

1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:37.740
 that point to the fact that triggering the increase

1:00:37.740 --> 1:00:39.960
 of adrenaline late in learning

1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:41.300
 or immediately after learning

1:00:41.300 --> 1:00:42.620
 is going to be most beneficial

1:00:42.620 --> 1:00:44.780
 if your goal is to retain that information

1:00:44.780 --> 1:00:45.940
 for some period of time

1:00:45.940 --> 1:00:48.140
 and to reduce the number of repetitions required

1:00:48.140 --> 1:00:49.940
 in order to learn that information.

1:00:49.940 --> 1:00:51.220
 Now, I want to acknowledge that

1:00:51.220 --> 1:00:54.060
 on previous episodes of this podcast

1:00:54.060 --> 1:00:56.140
 and in appearing on other podcasts,

1:00:56.140 --> 1:00:58.940
 I've talked a lot about things like non-sleep deep rest

1:00:58.940 --> 1:01:01.940
 and naps and sleep as vital to the learning process.

1:01:01.940 --> 1:01:02.960
 And I want to emphasize

1:01:02.960 --> 1:01:05.420
 that none of that information has changed, right?

1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:07.320
 I don't look at any of that information differently

1:01:07.320 --> 1:01:09.780
 as the consequence of what I'm talking about today.

1:01:09.780 --> 1:01:12.060
 It is still true that the strengthening

1:01:12.060 --> 1:01:15.460
 of connections in the brain, the literal neuroplasticity,

1:01:15.460 --> 1:01:17.020
 the changing of the circuits occurs

1:01:17.020 --> 1:01:19.700
 during deep sleep and non-sleep deep rest.

1:01:19.700 --> 1:01:22.440
 And it is also true, and I've mentioned these results

1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:25.700
 earlier that two papers were published in Cell Reports,

1:01:25.700 --> 1:01:27.460
 Cell Press Journal, Excellent Journal

1:01:27.460 --> 1:01:28.620
 over the last few years,

1:01:28.620 --> 1:01:33.620
 showing that brief naps of about 20 to up to 90 minutes

1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:37.420
 in some period of time after an attempt to learn

1:01:37.420 --> 1:01:40.380
 can enhance the rate of learning and memory.

1:01:41.340 --> 1:01:44.700
 However, those bouts of sleep,

1:01:44.700 --> 1:01:46.340
 the deep sleep that night, I should say,

1:01:46.340 --> 1:01:49.700
 or those brief naps, or even the so-called NSDR

1:01:49.700 --> 1:01:51.540
 as we call it, non-sleep deep rest

1:01:51.540 --> 1:01:54.780
 that was used to enhance the learning and memory

1:01:54.780 --> 1:01:57.340
 of particular pieces of information,

1:01:57.340 --> 1:02:00.960
 either cognitive or physical information or both,

1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:03.420
 that still can be performed,

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:07.140
 but it can be performed some hours later,

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:08.440
 even an hour later.

1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:11.020
 It can be performed two hours later or four hours later.

1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:13.380
 Remember, it's in these naps and in deep sleep

1:02:13.380 --> 1:02:15.700
 that the actual reconfiguration of the neural circuits

1:02:15.700 --> 1:02:18.940
 occurs, the strengthening of those neural circuits occurs.

1:02:18.940 --> 1:02:21.440
 It is not the case that you need to finish a bout

1:02:21.440 --> 1:02:23.520
 of learning and drop immediately into a nap or sleep.

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:24.800
 Some people might do that,

1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:27.300
 but if you're really trying to optimize and enhance

1:02:27.300 --> 1:02:31.060
 and improve your memory, the data from McGaugh and Cahill

1:02:31.060 --> 1:02:33.660
 and many other laboratories that stemmed out

1:02:33.660 --> 1:02:36.100
 from their initial work really point to the fact

1:02:36.100 --> 1:02:39.700
 that the ideal protocol would be focus

1:02:39.700 --> 1:02:41.620
 on the thing you're trying to learn very intensely.

1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:44.220
 There are also some other things like error rates, et cetera.

1:02:44.220 --> 1:02:45.780
 Please see our episodes on learning.

1:02:45.780 --> 1:02:48.300
 We have a newsletter on how to learn better.

1:02:48.300 --> 1:02:49.980
 You can access that at hubermanlab.com.

1:02:49.980 --> 1:02:51.740
 It's a zero cost newsletter.

1:02:51.740 --> 1:02:54.340
 You can grab that PDF, it lists out the things

1:02:54.340 --> 1:02:56.800
 to do during the learning bout.

1:02:56.800 --> 1:02:59.260
 Still try and get excellent sleep.

1:02:59.260 --> 1:03:01.140
 Again, fundamentally important for mental health,

1:03:01.140 --> 1:03:02.580
 physical health, and performance.

1:03:02.580 --> 1:03:05.300
 And we can now extend from performance to saying,

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:07.220
 including learning and memory.

1:03:08.060 --> 1:03:10.880
 Nap, if it doesn't interrupt your nighttime sleep,

1:03:10.880 --> 1:03:13.380
 naps of anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes

1:03:13.380 --> 1:03:14.980
 or non-sleep deep rest protocols

1:03:14.980 --> 1:03:16.420
 will enhance learning and memory.

1:03:16.420 --> 1:03:20.740
 But we can now add to that that spiking adrenaline,

1:03:20.740 --> 1:03:22.800
 provided it can be done in a safe way,

1:03:22.800 --> 1:03:25.700
 is going to reduce the number of repetitions required

1:03:25.700 --> 1:03:28.500
 to learn and that should be done at the very tail end

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:30.720
 or immediately after a learning bout,

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:33.360
 which is compatible with all the other protocols

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:34.200
 that I mentioned.

1:03:34.200 --> 1:03:36.220
 And the reason I'm revisiting the stuff about sleep

1:03:36.220 --> 1:03:38.340
 and non-sleep deep rest is I think that some people

1:03:38.340 --> 1:03:39.820
 got the impression that they need to do that

1:03:39.820 --> 1:03:41.080
 immediately after learning.

1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:42.640
 And today I'm saying to the contrary,

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:43.780
 immediately after learning,

1:03:43.780 --> 1:03:46.540
 you need to go into a heightened state of emotionality

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:47.420
 and alertness.

1:03:47.420 --> 1:03:49.840
 Now it's vitally important to point out

1:03:49.840 --> 1:03:52.560
 that you do not need pharmacology.

1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:54.460
 You don't need caffeine.

1:03:54.460 --> 1:03:56.680
 You don't need alpha GPC.

1:03:56.680 --> 1:03:58.820
 You don't need any pharmacologic substance

1:03:58.820 --> 1:04:00.620
 to spike adrenaline,

1:04:00.620 --> 1:04:03.300
 unless that's something that you already are doing

1:04:03.300 --> 1:04:05.020
 or that you can do safely

1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:06.680
 or that you know that you can do safely.

1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:09.160
 And I always say, and I'll say it again,

1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:11.140
 I'm not a physician, so I'm not prescribing anything.

1:04:11.140 --> 1:04:13.200
 I'm a professor, so I profess things.

1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:14.800
 You need to do what's safe for you.

1:04:14.800 --> 1:04:17.140
 So if you're somebody who's not used to drinking caffeine

1:04:17.140 --> 1:04:19.060
 and you suddenly drink four espresso

1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:20.580
 after trying to learn something,

1:04:20.580 --> 1:04:25.580
 you are going to have a severe increase in alertness

1:04:25.580 --> 1:04:26.740
 and probably even anxiety.

1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:28.260
 If you're panic attack prone,

1:04:28.260 --> 1:04:30.260
 please don't start taking stimulants

1:04:30.260 --> 1:04:31.720
 in order to learn things better.

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:32.560
 Please be safe.

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:33.580
 I don't just say that to protect me.

1:04:33.580 --> 1:04:35.020
 I say that to protect you.

1:04:35.980 --> 1:04:38.260
 And I should mention that if you're not accustomed

1:04:38.260 --> 1:04:39.520
 to taking something,

1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:42.180
 you always want to first check with your doctor, of course,

1:04:42.180 --> 1:04:45.020
 but also move into that gradually, right?

1:04:45.020 --> 1:04:47.700
 Start with the lowest effective dose,

1:04:47.700 --> 1:04:49.420
 the minimal effective dose.

1:04:49.420 --> 1:04:53.220
 And sometimes the minimal effective dose is zero milligrams.

1:04:53.220 --> 1:04:54.380
 It's nothing.

1:04:54.380 --> 1:04:55.220
 Why do I say that?

1:04:55.220 --> 1:04:57.460
 Well, we already talked about results

1:04:57.460 --> 1:05:01.260
 where they put people's arms into an ice bath

1:05:01.260 --> 1:05:02.880
 in order to evoke adrenaline release.

1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:04.300
 You are welcome to do that if you want.

1:05:04.300 --> 1:05:07.640
 In fact, that's a pretty low cost, zero pharmacology,

1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:09.260
 at least exogenous pharmacology way

1:05:09.260 --> 1:05:11.060
 to approach this whole thing.

1:05:11.060 --> 1:05:13.940
 That's a way of evoking your own natural epinephrine.

1:05:13.940 --> 1:05:16.480
 And it turns out also dopamine release.

1:05:16.480 --> 1:05:19.460
 You could take a cold shower, you could do an ice bath

1:05:19.460 --> 1:05:21.880
 or get into a cold circulating bath.

1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:24.900
 We've done several episodes on the utility of cold

1:05:24.900 --> 1:05:25.800
 for health and performance.

1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:28.100
 You can find those episodes at huberunelab.com.

1:05:28.100 --> 1:05:30.780
 Also the episode with my colleague at Stanford

1:05:30.780 --> 1:05:33.060
 from the biology department, Dr. Craig Heller.

1:05:33.060 --> 1:05:35.940
 Lots of protocols in particular in the episode

1:05:35.940 --> 1:05:37.700
 on cold for health and performance

1:05:37.700 --> 1:05:41.980
 that describe how best to use the cold shower

1:05:41.980 --> 1:05:44.620
 or the ice bath or the circulating cold bath

1:05:44.620 --> 1:05:47.300
 in order to evoke epinephrine and dopamine release.

1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:50.980
 The point is that the time in which you would want

1:05:50.980 --> 1:05:53.100
 to do those protocols is after,

1:05:53.100 --> 1:05:56.280
 ideally immediately after you're learning about,

1:05:56.280 --> 1:05:58.500
 meaning when you're sitting down to learn new information

1:05:58.500 --> 1:06:01.260
 or after trying to learn some new physical skill.

1:06:01.260 --> 1:06:02.460
 Now, whether or not that's compatible

1:06:02.460 --> 1:06:04.260
 with the other reasons you're doing

1:06:04.260 --> 1:06:05.880
 cold, deliberate cold exposure,

1:06:05.880 --> 1:06:07.260
 and whether or not that's compatible

1:06:07.260 --> 1:06:08.340
 with the other things you're doing,

1:06:08.340 --> 1:06:10.060
 that depends on the contour of your lifestyle,

1:06:10.060 --> 1:06:11.440
 your training, your academic goals,

1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:12.820
 your learning goals, et cetera.

1:06:12.820 --> 1:06:15.880
 But if your specific purpose is to enhance learning

1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:17.920
 and memory, you want to spike adrenaline afterwards.

1:06:17.920 --> 1:06:20.660
 And so what I'm telling you is you can do that with caffeine.

1:06:20.660 --> 1:06:22.780
 You can do that with alpha GPC.

1:06:22.780 --> 1:06:25.620
 You can do that with a combination of caffeine and alpha GPC

1:06:25.620 --> 1:06:27.380
 if you can do that safely.

1:06:27.380 --> 1:06:29.780
 Some of you I know are using other forms of pharmacology.

1:06:29.780 --> 1:06:32.260
 I did a long episode all about ADHD.

1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:35.660
 I have to just really declare my stance very clearly

1:06:35.660 --> 1:06:37.780
 that I am not a fan.

1:06:37.780 --> 1:06:42.220
 I am actually opposed to people using prescription drugs

1:06:42.220 --> 1:06:44.460
 who are not prescribed those drugs, right?

1:06:44.460 --> 1:06:45.960
 In order to enhance alertness,

1:06:45.960 --> 1:06:47.740
 I think there's a big addictive potential.

1:06:47.740 --> 1:06:50.140
 There also is a potential to really disrupt

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:53.820
 one's own pharmacology around the dopaminergic system.

1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:57.000
 However, some of you I know are prescribed things

1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:00.940
 like Ritalin, Adderall, and Modafinil and things of that sort

1:07:00.940 --> 1:07:02.980
 in order to increase alertness and focus.

1:07:02.980 --> 1:07:04.820
 So for those of you that are prescribed those things

1:07:04.820 --> 1:07:07.660
 from a board certified physician,

1:07:07.660 --> 1:07:08.620
 you're going to have to decide

1:07:08.620 --> 1:07:10.260
 if you're going to take them before trying to learn

1:07:10.260 --> 1:07:12.020
 or after trying to learn.

1:07:12.020 --> 1:07:13.380
 You also have to take into consideration

1:07:13.380 --> 1:07:15.440
 that some of those drugs are very long acting,

1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:17.980
 some are shorter acting and time that

1:07:17.980 --> 1:07:20.200
 according to what you're trying to learn and when.

1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:21.780
 So that's pharmacology.

1:07:21.780 --> 1:07:24.800
 But as I've mentioned, there are the behavioral protocols.

1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:28.820
 You can use cold and cold is an excellent stimulus

1:07:28.820 --> 1:07:32.860
 because first of all, it doesn't involve pharmacology.

1:07:32.860 --> 1:07:35.680
 Second of all, you can generally access it

1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:39.340
 at low to zero cost, especially the cold shower approach.

1:07:39.340 --> 1:07:41.940
 And third, you can titrate it.

1:07:41.940 --> 1:07:43.700
 You can start with warmer water.

1:07:43.700 --> 1:07:45.980
 You can make it very, very cold if that's your thing

1:07:45.980 --> 1:07:47.500
 and you're able to tolerate that safely.

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:50.780
 You can make it moderately cold.

1:07:50.780 --> 1:07:53.580
 How cold should it be in order to evoke adrenaline release?

1:07:53.580 --> 1:07:55.500
 Well, it should be uncomfortably cold,

1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:58.700
 but cold enough that you feel like you really want to get

1:07:58.700 --> 1:08:00.340
 out, but can stay in safely.

1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:02.560
 That's going to evoke adrenaline release.

1:08:02.560 --> 1:08:06.040
 If it quickens your breathing, if it makes you go wide-eyed,

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:07.540
 that's increasing adrenaline release.

1:08:07.540 --> 1:08:09.820
 In fact, those effects of going wide-eyed

1:08:09.820 --> 1:08:11.780
 and quickening of the breathing and the challenges

1:08:11.780 --> 1:08:13.800
 and thinking clearly, those are the direct effects

1:08:13.800 --> 1:08:15.860
 of adrenaline on your brain and body.

1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:18.140
 And of course, there are other ways to increase adrenaline.

1:08:18.140 --> 1:08:20.720
 You could go out for a hard run.

1:08:20.720 --> 1:08:22.820
 You could do any number of things

1:08:22.820 --> 1:08:25.060
 that would increase adrenaline in your body.

1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:27.420
 Which things you choose is up to you,

1:08:27.420 --> 1:08:32.400
 but from a very clear, solid grounding in research data,

1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:35.100
 we can confidently say that spiking adrenaline

1:08:35.100 --> 1:08:37.620
 after interacting with some material,

1:08:37.620 --> 1:08:39.840
 physical or cognitive material that you're trying to learn

1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:42.380
 is going to be the best time to spike that adrenaline.

1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:44.260
 Now, I realize that I'm being a bit redundant today,

1:08:44.260 --> 1:08:47.700
 or perhaps a lot redundant in repeating over and over

1:08:47.700 --> 1:08:51.380
 that the increase in epinephrine should occur

1:08:51.380 --> 1:08:54.260
 either very late in an attempt to learn something

1:08:54.260 --> 1:08:58.180
 or immediately after an attempt to learn something.

1:08:58.180 --> 1:09:00.940
 I also want to emphasize the general contour

1:09:00.940 --> 1:09:03.620
 of pharmacologic effects and of behavioral tools

1:09:03.620 --> 1:09:04.900
 to create adrenaline.

1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:06.260
 What do I mean by that sentence?

1:09:06.260 --> 1:09:09.260
 What I mean is that McGaugh and colleagues

1:09:09.260 --> 1:09:11.740
 explored a huge number of different compounds and approaches,

1:09:11.740 --> 1:09:13.780
 everything from the hand into the ice bath

1:09:13.780 --> 1:09:17.380
 to injecting adrenaline, to caffeine,

1:09:17.380 --> 1:09:22.340
 to drugs that block the effects of adrenaline and caffeine,

1:09:22.340 --> 1:09:24.340
 drugs like Musamol and Picrotoxin.

1:09:24.340 --> 1:09:25.180
 Please don't take those.

1:09:25.180 --> 1:09:27.580
 These are drugs that reduce or enhance

1:09:27.580 --> 1:09:28.560
 the amount of adrenaline.

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:31.620
 And the overall takeaway is that anything

1:09:31.620 --> 1:09:35.260
 that increases adrenaline will increase learning and memory

1:09:35.260 --> 1:09:37.460
 and will reduce the number of repetitions required

1:09:37.460 --> 1:09:39.140
 to learn something.

1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:40.860
 Regardless of whether or not that something

1:09:40.860 --> 1:09:44.780
 has an emotional intensity or not,

1:09:44.780 --> 1:09:47.740
 provided that that spike in adrenaline occurs

1:09:47.740 --> 1:09:49.580
 late in the learning or immediately after.

1:09:49.580 --> 1:09:53.720
 And anything that reduces epinephrine and adrenaline

1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:55.760
 will impair learning.

1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:58.540
 And that's the key and novel piece of information

1:09:58.540 --> 1:09:59.580
 that I'm adding now,

1:09:59.580 --> 1:10:03.060
 which is if you're taking beta blockers, for instance,

1:10:03.060 --> 1:10:05.540
 or if you're trying to learn something

1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:08.980
 and it's not evoking much of an emotional response

1:10:08.980 --> 1:10:11.640
 and you're not using any pharmacology or other methods

1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:14.780
 to enhance adrenaline release after learning that thing,

1:10:14.780 --> 1:10:17.100
 well, you're not going to learn it very well.

1:10:17.100 --> 1:10:20.560
 In fact, McGaugh and Cahill did beautiful experiments

1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:24.980
 in humans looking at how much adrenaline is increased

1:10:24.980 --> 1:10:29.260
 by varying the emotional intensity of different things

1:10:29.260 --> 1:10:31.160
 that they were trying to get people to learn,

1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:34.180
 or by changing the dosage of epinephrine,

1:10:34.180 --> 1:10:36.500
 or by changing the amount of epinephrine blocker

1:10:36.500 --> 1:10:39.420
 that they injected, lots and lots of studies.

1:10:39.420 --> 1:10:41.160
 The key thing to take away from those studies

1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:42.700
 is that for some people,

1:10:42.700 --> 1:10:46.300
 adrenaline was increased 600 to 700%.

1:10:46.300 --> 1:10:48.900
 So six to seven fold over baseline

1:10:48.900 --> 1:10:51.700
 in the amount of circulating epinephrine or adrenaline.

1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:53.400
 And keep in mind, sometimes that increase

1:10:53.400 --> 1:10:55.500
 was due to the actual thing they were trying to learn

1:10:55.500 --> 1:10:58.580
 being very emotional, positive or negative emotion.

1:10:58.580 --> 1:11:00.260
 And sometimes it was because they were using

1:11:00.260 --> 1:11:02.900
 a pharmacologic approach or the ice bath approach.

1:11:02.900 --> 1:11:04.560
 I don't think they ever used a cold shower approach,

1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:06.200
 but that would have been a very effective one

1:11:06.200 --> 1:11:07.380
 we can be sure.

1:11:07.380 --> 1:11:12.380
 However, other people had a zero to 10% increase,

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:15.160
 so a very small increase in epinephrine.

1:11:16.220 --> 1:11:19.180
 What we can confidently say on the basis of all those data

1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:22.660
 is that the more epinephrine release,

1:11:22.660 --> 1:11:25.820
 the better that people remembered the material.

1:11:25.820 --> 1:11:27.220
 Over and over again, this was shown,

1:11:27.220 --> 1:11:29.100
 whether or not it was for cognitive materials,

1:11:29.100 --> 1:11:31.740
 so learning a language, learning a passage of words,

1:11:31.740 --> 1:11:33.120
 learning mathematics,

1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:35.780
 or whether or not it was for physical learning.

1:11:35.780 --> 1:11:37.700
 I want to emphasize something about physical learning

1:11:37.700 --> 1:11:40.020
 because I know a number of you are probably

1:11:40.020 --> 1:11:42.620
 drinking a cup of coffee or having a cup of Yerba Mate

1:11:42.620 --> 1:11:43.900
 or maybe even an energy drink

1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:45.620
 and taking some Alpha GPC or something

1:11:45.620 --> 1:11:48.300
 before physical exercise.

1:11:48.300 --> 1:11:49.820
 I'm not saying that's a bad thing to do

1:11:49.820 --> 1:11:51.020
 or that you wouldn't want to do that,

1:11:51.020 --> 1:11:53.360
 but that's really to increase alertness.

1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:55.780
 It won't enhance learning, at least not as well

1:11:55.780 --> 1:11:59.060
 as doing those things after the physical exercise.

1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:01.620
 Now, again, many of you, including myself,

1:12:01.620 --> 1:12:04.420
 exercise for sake of the physical benefits of that exercise,

1:12:04.420 --> 1:12:06.500
 the cardiovascular resistance training,

1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:09.860
 but we're not really focused on learning and memory.

1:12:09.860 --> 1:12:12.460
 So I emphasize this

1:12:12.460 --> 1:12:14.420
 just so it's immensely clear to everybody.

1:12:14.420 --> 1:12:16.800
 If you want to use those approaches

1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:18.940
 of increasing adrenaline prior to

1:12:18.940 --> 1:12:20.820
 or during physical training

1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:23.380
 or cognitive work for that matter, be my guest.

1:12:23.380 --> 1:12:26.300
 I think that's perfectly fine provided that's safe for you.

1:12:26.300 --> 1:12:29.840
 It's only by moving it to late or after the learning

1:12:29.840 --> 1:12:32.020
 that you're really shifting the role

1:12:32.020 --> 1:12:36.540
 of that adrenaline increase to enhancing memory specifically.

1:12:36.540 --> 1:12:38.340
 And as a cautionary note,

1:12:38.340 --> 1:12:40.860
 don't think that you can push this entire system

1:12:40.860 --> 1:12:42.740
 to the extreme over and over again,

1:12:42.740 --> 1:12:45.420
 or chronically as we say, and get away with it.

1:12:45.420 --> 1:12:48.380
 In other words, you're not going to be able to take

1:12:48.380 --> 1:12:52.180
 a Alpha GPC and a double espresso,

1:12:52.180 --> 1:12:56.100
 do your focus bout of work, cognitive or physical work,

1:12:56.100 --> 1:12:58.780
 and then spike adrenaline again afterwards

1:12:58.780 --> 1:13:00.580
 and remember that stuff even better, right?

1:13:00.580 --> 1:13:01.700
 I'm not encouraging you.

1:13:01.700 --> 1:13:03.640
 In fact, I'm discouraging you

1:13:03.640 --> 1:13:06.960
 from chronically increasing adrenaline

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:11.860
 both during and after a given bout of work

1:13:11.860 --> 1:13:13.440
 if the goal is to learn.

1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:14.380
 Why do I say that?

1:13:14.380 --> 1:13:18.380
 Well, work from McGaugh and Cahill and others has shown

1:13:18.380 --> 1:13:22.740
 that it's not the absolute amount of adrenaline

1:13:22.740 --> 1:13:24.060
 that you release in your brain and body

1:13:24.060 --> 1:13:26.560
 that matters for enhancing memory.

1:13:26.560 --> 1:13:29.680
 It's the amount of adrenaline that you release

1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:32.240
 relative to the amount of adrenaline

1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:34.300
 that was in your system just prior,

1:13:34.300 --> 1:13:36.340
 in particular in the hour or two prior.

1:13:36.340 --> 1:13:38.920
 So again, it's the Delta as we say, it's the difference.

1:13:38.920 --> 1:13:41.180
 So if you're going to chronically increase adrenaline,

1:13:41.180 --> 1:13:43.140
 you're not going to learn as well.

1:13:43.140 --> 1:13:45.860
 The real key is to have adrenaline modestly low,

1:13:45.860 --> 1:13:48.140
 perhaps even just as much as you need

1:13:48.140 --> 1:13:50.000
 in order to be able to focus on something,

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.860
 pay attention to it, and then spike it afterwards.

1:13:52.860 --> 1:13:54.900
 This is immensely important

1:13:54.900 --> 1:13:58.220
 because while much of what we're talking about

1:13:58.220 --> 1:13:59.860
 is actually a form of inducing

1:13:59.860 --> 1:14:01.980
 a neurochemical acute stress,

1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:06.300
 meaning a brief and rapid onset of stress,

1:14:06.300 --> 1:14:09.980
 well, chronic stress, the chronic elevation

1:14:09.980 --> 1:14:11.860
 of epinephrine and cortisol

1:14:11.860 --> 1:14:13.620
 is actually detrimental to learning.

1:14:13.620 --> 1:14:16.500
 And there's an entire category of literature,

1:14:16.500 --> 1:14:18.380
 mainly from the work of the great

1:14:18.380 --> 1:14:20.660
 and sadly the late Bruce McEwen

1:14:20.660 --> 1:14:22.000
 from the Rockefeller University

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:23.580
 and some of his scientific offspring

1:14:23.580 --> 1:14:27.780
 like the great Robert Sapolsky showing that chronic stress,

1:14:27.780 --> 1:14:29.340
 chronic elevation of epinephrine

1:14:29.340 --> 1:14:31.460
 actually inhibits learning and memory

1:14:31.460 --> 1:14:33.380
 and also can inhibit immune system function,

1:14:33.380 --> 1:14:35.380
 whereas acute, right?

1:14:35.380 --> 1:14:37.700
 Sharp increases in adrenaline

1:14:37.700 --> 1:14:39.980
 and cortisol actually can enhance learning

1:14:39.980 --> 1:14:41.920
 and indeed can enhance the immune system.

1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:44.780
 So if you really want to leverage this information,

1:14:44.780 --> 1:14:47.580
 you might consider getting your brain and body

1:14:47.580 --> 1:14:50.780
 into a very calm and yet alert state,

1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:52.780
 so a high attentional state that will allow you

1:14:52.780 --> 1:14:55.180
 to focus on what it is that you're trying to learn.

1:14:55.180 --> 1:14:58.300
 We know focus is vital for encoding information

1:14:58.300 --> 1:15:00.260
 and for triggering neuroplasticity,

1:15:00.260 --> 1:15:02.980
 but remaining calm throughout that time

1:15:02.980 --> 1:15:05.860
 and then afterwards spiking adrenaline

1:15:05.860 --> 1:15:08.740
 and allowing adrenaline to have these incredible effects

1:15:08.740 --> 1:15:11.620
 on reducing the number of repetitions required to learn.

1:15:11.620 --> 1:15:12.700
 So if you're like me,

1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:14.180
 you're learning about this information,

1:15:14.180 --> 1:15:16.660
 this beautiful work of McGaugh and Cahill and others

1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:19.720
 and thinking, wow, I should perhaps consider

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:23.060
 spiking my adrenaline in one form or another

1:15:23.060 --> 1:15:25.340
 at the tail end or immediately follow

1:15:25.340 --> 1:15:27.220
 and attempt to learn something.

1:15:27.220 --> 1:15:30.020
 And yet we are not the first to have this conversation,

1:15:30.020 --> 1:15:33.020
 nor were McGaugh and Cahill or any other researchers

1:15:33.020 --> 1:15:35.180
 that I've discussed today,

1:15:35.180 --> 1:15:37.780
 the first to start using this technique.

1:15:37.780 --> 1:15:40.140
 In fact, there is a beautiful review

1:15:40.140 --> 1:15:42.740
 that was published just this year, May of 2022

1:15:42.740 --> 1:15:44.460
 in the journal Neuron, Cell Press Journal,

1:15:44.460 --> 1:15:48.980
 excellent journal called Mechanisms of Memory Under Stress.

1:15:48.980 --> 1:15:52.120
 And I just want to read to you the first opening paragraph

1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:54.380
 of this review, which is, as the name suggests,

1:15:54.380 --> 1:15:56.760
 all about memory and stress.

1:15:56.760 --> 1:15:58.680
 So here I'm reading and I quote,

1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:01.580
 "'In medieval times, communities threw young children

1:16:01.580 --> 1:16:02.900
 in the river when they wanted them

1:16:02.900 --> 1:16:04.860
 to remember important events.

1:16:04.860 --> 1:16:06.700
 They believed that throwing a child in the water

1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:08.980
 after witnessing historic proceedings

1:16:08.980 --> 1:16:12.520
 would leave a lifelong memory for the events in the child.'"

1:16:12.520 --> 1:16:14.380
 Believe it or not, this is true.

1:16:14.380 --> 1:16:19.000
 This is a practice that somehow people arrived at.

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:22.200
 I don't know if they were aware of what adrenaline was,

1:16:22.200 --> 1:16:26.040
 probably not, but somehow in medieval times,

1:16:26.040 --> 1:16:28.860
 it was understood that spiking adrenaline

1:16:28.860 --> 1:16:32.160
 or creating a robust emotional experience

1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:36.720
 after an experience that one hoped a child would learn

1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:39.040
 would encourage the child's nervous system,

1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:40.420
 and they didn't even know what a nervous system was,

1:16:40.420 --> 1:16:43.420
 but would encourage the brain and body of that child

1:16:43.420 --> 1:16:45.860
 to remember those particular events.

1:16:46.820 --> 1:16:48.880
 Very counterintuitive, if you ask me.

1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:50.680
 I would have thought that the kid would remember

1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:52.120
 only being thrown into the river.

1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:53.520
 My guess is that they remembered that,

1:16:53.520 --> 1:16:56.480
 but the idea here anyway is that they also remember

1:16:56.480 --> 1:16:59.140
 the things that preceded being thrown into the river.

1:16:59.140 --> 1:17:04.140
 So both interesting and amusing and somewhat,

1:17:04.620 --> 1:17:06.640
 I should say, thought stimulating, really,

1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:09.620
 that this is a practice that has been going on

1:17:09.620 --> 1:17:11.680
 for many hundreds of years,

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:14.160
 and we are not the first to start thinking

1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:16.780
 about using cold water as an adrenaline stimulus,

1:17:16.780 --> 1:17:18.960
 nor are we the first to start thinking about using

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:20.800
 cold water-induced adrenaline

1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:22.600
 as a way to enhance learning and memory.

1:17:22.600 --> 1:17:25.360
 This has been happening since medieval times.

1:17:25.360 --> 1:17:27.200
 So up until now, I've been talking about

1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:29.920
 a pretty broad contour of these experiments.

1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:32.000
 I've been talking about the underlying pharmacology,

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.340
 the role of epinephrine and so forth.

1:17:33.340 --> 1:17:34.460
 I haven't really talked a lot

1:17:34.460 --> 1:17:36.300
 about the underlying neural mechanisms,

1:17:36.300 --> 1:17:37.360
 so I'm just going to take a minute or two

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:40.840
 and describe those for you because they are informative.

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:43.560
 We all have a brain structure called the amygdala.

1:17:43.560 --> 1:17:45.600
 A lot of people think it's associated with fear,

1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:48.840
 but it's actually associated with threat detection

1:17:48.840 --> 1:17:52.160
 and more generally, and I should say more specifically,

1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:55.600
 with detecting what sorts of events in the environment

1:17:55.600 --> 1:17:59.520
 are novel and are linked to particular emotional states,

1:17:59.520 --> 1:18:01.080
 both positive emotional states

1:18:01.080 --> 1:18:03.060
 and negative emotional states.

1:18:03.060 --> 1:18:06.160
 So the neurons in the amygdala are exquisitely good

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:09.320
 at figuring out, right, they don't have their own mind,

1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:13.200
 but at detecting correlations between sensory events

1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:15.640
 in the environment that trigger the release of adrenaline

1:18:15.640 --> 1:18:17.240
 and what's going on in the brain.

1:18:17.240 --> 1:18:19.920
 And because the amygdala is so extensively interconnected

1:18:19.920 --> 1:18:21.280
 with other areas of the brain,

1:18:21.280 --> 1:18:22.440
 it basically connects to everything

1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:24.240
 and everything connects back to it,

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:26.960
 the amygdala is in a position

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:30.380
 to strengthen particular connections in the brain

1:18:30.380 --> 1:18:34.400
 very easily, provided certain conditions are met,

1:18:34.400 --> 1:18:35.360
 and those conditions are the ones

1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:37.420
 we've been talking about up until now,

1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:39.600
 emotional saliency that results in increases

1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:41.400
 in epinephrine and cortisol

1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:43.680
 or circulating epinephrine and cortisol

1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:45.600
 being much higher than it was 10 minutes

1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:46.800
 or 15 minutes before.

1:18:46.800 --> 1:18:49.440
 And the net effect of the amygdala in this context

1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:52.160
 is to take whatever patterns of neural activity

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:55.200
 preceded that increase in adrenaline and corticosterone

1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:57.320
 and strengthen those synapses

1:18:57.320 --> 1:18:59.200
 that were involved in that neural activity.

1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:01.120
 So the amygdala doesn't have knowledge,

1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:05.400
 it's not a thinking area, it's a correlation detector,

1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:07.160
 and it's correlating neurochemical states

1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:08.960
 of the brain and body with different patterns

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:11.440
 of electrical activity in the brain.

1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:15.280
 This is important because it really emphasizes the fact

1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:19.320
 that both negative and positive emotional states

1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:24.320
 and the different but somewhat overlapping chemical states

1:19:24.320 --> 1:19:27.260
 that they create are the conditions, as we say,

1:19:27.260 --> 1:19:30.760
 the AND gates through which memory is laid down.

1:19:30.760 --> 1:19:32.520
 AND gates will be familiar to those of you

1:19:32.520 --> 1:19:35.120
 who have done a bit of computer programming.

1:19:35.120 --> 1:19:37.380
 An AND gate is simply a condition

1:19:37.380 --> 1:19:42.040
 in which you need one thing and another to happen

1:19:42.040 --> 1:19:44.400
 in order for a third thing to happen.

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:46.080
 So you need epinephrine elevated

1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:49.260
 and you need robust activity in a particular brain circuit

1:19:49.260 --> 1:19:52.520
 if in fact that brain circuit is going to be strengthened.

1:19:52.520 --> 1:19:54.820
 It's not sufficient to have one or the other,

1:19:54.820 --> 1:19:57.240
 you need both, hence the name AND gate.

1:19:57.240 --> 1:19:59.380
 And the amygdala is very good at establishing

1:19:59.380 --> 1:20:01.480
 these AND gate contingencies.

1:20:01.480 --> 1:20:03.800
 It's also a very generic brain structure

1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:06.360
 in the sense that it doesn't really care

1:20:06.360 --> 1:20:09.220
 what sorts of sensory events are involved

1:20:09.220 --> 1:20:11.100
 provided they correlated in time

1:20:11.100 --> 1:20:14.140
 with that increase in adrenaline and corticosterone.

1:20:14.140 --> 1:20:17.800
 This has a wonderful side and a kind of dark side.

1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:22.800
 The dark side is that PTSD and traumas of various kinds

1:20:23.460 --> 1:20:27.080
 often involve a increase in adrenaline

1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:29.920
 because whatever it was that caused the PTSD

1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:31.040
 was indeed very stressful,

1:20:31.040 --> 1:20:33.140
 caused these big increases in these chemicals.

1:20:33.140 --> 1:20:37.000
 And because the amygdala is rather general

1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:37.840
 in its functions, right?

1:20:37.840 --> 1:20:40.600
 It's not tuned or designed in any kind of way

1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:42.840
 to be specifically active in response

1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:47.060
 to particular types of sensory events or perceptions.

1:20:47.060 --> 1:20:49.260
 Well, then what it means is that we can start

1:20:49.260 --> 1:20:53.060
 to become afraid of entire city blocks

1:20:53.060 --> 1:20:56.040
 where one bad thing happened in a particular room

1:20:56.040 --> 1:20:58.240
 of a particular building in a city block.

1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:01.160
 We can become fearful of any place

1:21:01.160 --> 1:21:02.520
 that contains a lot of people

1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:04.240
 if something bad happened to us

1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:06.440
 in a place that contained a lot of people.

1:21:06.440 --> 1:21:09.360
 The amygdala is not so much of a splitter,

1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:11.800
 as we say in science, we talk about lumpers and splitters.

1:21:11.800 --> 1:21:16.360
 Lumpers are kind of generalizers, if that's even a word.

1:21:16.360 --> 1:21:17.720
 And I think it is, someone will tell me

1:21:17.720 --> 1:21:18.720
 one way or the other.

1:21:18.720 --> 1:21:23.200
 And splitters are people that are ultra precise

1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:26.480
 and specific and nuanced about every little detail.

1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:29.560
 The amygdala is more of a lumper than a splitter

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:31.560
 when it comes to sensory events.

1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:33.660
 Other areas of the brain only become active

1:21:33.660 --> 1:21:35.600
 under very, very specific conditions

1:21:35.600 --> 1:21:36.800
 and only those conditions.

1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:40.760
 And similarly, epinephrine is just a molecule.

1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:43.520
 It's just a chemical that's circulating

1:21:43.520 --> 1:21:44.560
 in our brain and body.

1:21:44.560 --> 1:21:48.120
 There's no epinephrine specifically for a cold shower

1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:50.000
 that is distinct from the epinephrine

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:51.200
 associated with a bad event,

1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:52.760
 which is distinct from the epinephrine

1:21:52.760 --> 1:21:54.360
 associated with a really exciting event

1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:55.360
 that makes you really alert.

1:21:55.360 --> 1:21:57.600
 Epinephrine is just a molecule, it's generic.

1:21:57.600 --> 1:21:59.800
 And so these systems have a lot of overlap

1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:02.340
 and that can explain in large part

1:22:02.340 --> 1:22:05.560
 why when good things happen in particular locations

1:22:05.560 --> 1:22:08.280
 and in the company of particular people,

1:22:08.280 --> 1:22:11.620
 we often generalize to large categories

1:22:11.620 --> 1:22:13.440
 of people, places, and things.

1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:16.140
 And when negative things happen in particular circumstances,

1:22:16.140 --> 1:22:19.080
 we often generalize about people, places, and things

1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:20.880
 associated with that negative event.

1:22:20.880 --> 1:22:22.660
 So now I'd like to talk about other tools

1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:24.480
 that you can leverage that have been shown

1:22:24.480 --> 1:22:26.000
 in quality peer-reviewed studies

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.040
 to enhance learning and memory.

1:22:28.040 --> 1:22:30.720
 And perhaps one of the most potent of those tools

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:32.340
 is exercise.

1:22:33.320 --> 1:22:36.600
 There are numerous studies on this in both animal models

1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:39.400
 and fortunately now also in humans,

1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:42.220
 thanks to the beautiful work of people like Wendy Suzuki

1:22:42.220 --> 1:22:43.740
 from New York University.

1:22:43.740 --> 1:22:47.040
 Wendy's lab has identified how exercise works

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:48.600
 to enhance learning and memory

1:22:48.600 --> 1:22:51.240
 and other forms of cognition I should mention,

1:22:51.240 --> 1:22:54.480
 as well as things that can augment,

1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:56.800
 can enhance the effects of exercise

1:22:56.800 --> 1:22:59.840
 on learning and memory and other forms of cognition.

1:22:59.840 --> 1:23:01.800
 Wendy is going to be a guest on this podcast.

1:23:01.800 --> 1:23:05.000
 It's actually the episode that follows this episode

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:06.320
 and includes a lot of material

1:23:06.320 --> 1:23:08.120
 that we have not covered today.

1:23:08.120 --> 1:23:10.720
 And she's an incredible scientist

1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:12.600
 and has some incredible findings

1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:15.540
 that I know everyone is going to find immensely useful.

1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:17.660
 In the meantime, I want to talk about

1:23:17.660 --> 1:23:19.900
 some of the general effects of exercise

1:23:19.900 --> 1:23:22.000
 on learning and memory that she's discovered

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.280
 and that other laboratories have discovered.

1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:25.140
 If you recall earlier,

1:23:25.140 --> 1:23:27.880
 I mentioned that learning and memory

1:23:27.880 --> 1:23:30.400
 almost always involves the strengthening

1:23:30.400 --> 1:23:33.960
 of particular synapses and neural circuits in the brain

1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:36.580
 and not so much the increase

1:23:36.580 --> 1:23:39.160
 in the number of neurons in the brain.

1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:40.960
 There is one exception, however,

1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:43.640
 and we now have both animal data and some human data

1:23:43.640 --> 1:23:46.480
 to support the fact that cardiovascular exercise

1:23:46.480 --> 1:23:51.200
 seems to increase what we call dentate gyrus neurogenesis.

1:23:51.200 --> 1:23:53.440
 Neurogenesis is the creation of new neurons.

1:23:53.440 --> 1:23:56.220
 The dentate gyrus is a sub-region of the hippocampus

1:23:56.220 --> 1:23:59.820
 that's involved in learning and memory of particular kinds,

1:23:59.820 --> 1:24:02.920
 certain types of events, in particular contextual learning,

1:24:02.920 --> 1:24:04.860
 but some other things as well,

1:24:04.860 --> 1:24:06.680
 sometimes involved in spatial learning.

1:24:06.680 --> 1:24:07.520
 There's a lot of debate

1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:09.480
 about exactly what the dentate gyrus does,

1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:11.340
 but for sake of this discussion,

1:24:12.280 --> 1:24:14.580
 and I think everyone in the neuroscience community

1:24:14.580 --> 1:24:15.920
 would agree that the dentate gyrus

1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:19.000
 is important for memory formation and consolidation.

1:24:21.040 --> 1:24:23.320
 The dentate gyrus does seem to be one region

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:25.560
 of the brain, certainly in the rodent brain,

1:24:25.560 --> 1:24:29.120
 but more and more it's seeming also in the human brain

1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:31.280
 where at least some new neurons

1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:33.180
 are added throughout the lifespan.

1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:36.720
 And as it turns out that cardiovascular exercise

1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:38.840
 can increase the proliferation

1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:40.920
 of new neurons in the structure

1:24:40.920 --> 1:24:44.040
 and that those new neurons, excuse me,

1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:46.560
 are important for the formation

1:24:46.560 --> 1:24:48.600
 of certain types of new memories.

1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:49.960
 There are wonderful data showing

1:24:49.960 --> 1:24:52.120
 that if you use X irradiation,

1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:54.360
 which is a way to eliminate the formation

1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:57.240
 of those new cells or other tools and tricks

1:24:57.240 --> 1:24:59.140
 to eliminate the formation of those cells,

1:24:59.140 --> 1:25:00.960
 that you block the formation

1:25:00.960 --> 1:25:02.480
 of certain kinds of learning and memory.

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:03.320
 What does this mean?

1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:05.120
 Well, there are a lot of reasons

1:25:05.120 --> 1:25:06.400
 for the statement I'm about to make

1:25:06.400 --> 1:25:09.280
 that extend far beyond neurogenesis

1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:11.020
 and the hippocampus learning and memory,

1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:14.700
 but it's very clear that getting anywhere from 180,

1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:17.760
 I should say a minimum of 180 to 200 minutes

1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:20.040
 of so-called zone two cardiovascular exercise,

1:25:20.040 --> 1:25:21.780
 so this is cardiovascular exercise

1:25:21.780 --> 1:25:25.500
 that can be performed at a pretty steady state,

1:25:25.500 --> 1:25:28.080
 which would allow you to just barely hold a conversation.

1:25:28.080 --> 1:25:31.000
 So breathing hard, but not super hard.

1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:33.320
 This isn't sprints or high intensity interval training,

1:25:33.320 --> 1:25:37.020
 but doing that for 180 to 200 minutes per week total

1:25:37.020 --> 1:25:39.640
 is it appears the minimum threshold

1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:43.140
 for enhancing some of the longevity effects

1:25:43.140 --> 1:25:46.280
 associated with improvements in cardiovascular fitness.

1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:48.960
 And we believe that it is indirectly,

1:25:48.960 --> 1:25:51.280
 I should say indirectly through enhancements

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:54.140
 in cardiovascular fitness that there are improvements

1:25:54.140 --> 1:25:56.920
 in hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.

1:25:56.920 --> 1:25:57.940
 What does that mean?

1:25:57.940 --> 1:26:00.560
 The improvements in cardiovascular function

1:26:00.560 --> 1:26:03.500
 are indirectly impacting the ability of the dentate gyrus

1:26:03.500 --> 1:26:05.160
 to create these new neurons.

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:07.920
 To my knowledge, there's no direct relationship

1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:10.380
 between exercise and stimulating

1:26:10.380 --> 1:26:12.920
 the production of new neurons in the brain.

1:26:14.140 --> 1:26:17.260
 It seems that it's the improvements in blood flow

1:26:17.260 --> 1:26:18.920
 that also relate to improvements

1:26:18.920 --> 1:26:20.480
 in things like glymphatic flow,

1:26:20.480 --> 1:26:22.840
 the circulation of lymph fluid within the brain

1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:24.900
 that are enhancing neurogenesis

1:26:24.900 --> 1:26:27.840
 and that neurogenesis it appears is important.

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:31.060
 Now, in fairness to the landscape of neuroscience

1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:34.040
 and my colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere,

1:26:34.040 --> 1:26:36.320
 there is a lot of debate as to whether or not

1:26:36.320 --> 1:26:39.640
 there is much, if any, neurogenesis

1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:42.120
 in the adult human brain.

1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:44.760
 But regardless, I think the data are quite clear

1:26:44.760 --> 1:26:48.200
 that the 180 to 200 minutes minimum

1:26:48.200 --> 1:26:50.960
 of cardiovascular exercise is going to be important

1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:52.560
 for other health metrics.

1:26:52.560 --> 1:26:55.520
 Now, it is clear that exercise can impact learning

1:26:55.520 --> 1:26:58.160
 and memory through other non-neurogenesis,

1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:00.300
 non new neuron type mechanisms.

1:27:00.300 --> 1:27:02.000
 And one of the more exciting ones

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:05.040
 that has been studied over the years

1:27:05.040 --> 1:27:08.680
 is this notion of hormones from bone

1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:11.000
 traveling in the bloodstream to the brain

1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.440
 and enhancing the function of the hippocampus.

1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:17.520
 Now, the words hormones from bones is surprising to you.

1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:19.560
 I'm here to tell you that yes, indeed,

1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:22.160
 your bones make hormones.

1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:23.980
 We call these endocrine effects.

1:27:23.980 --> 1:27:27.640
 So in biology, we hear about autocrine,

1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:28.920
 paracrine, and endocrine.

1:27:28.920 --> 1:27:32.740
 And those different terms refer to over what distance

1:27:32.740 --> 1:27:35.620
 a given chemical has an effect on a cell.

1:27:35.620 --> 1:27:38.120
 For instance, a cell can have an effect on itself.

1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:40.600
 It can have an effect on immediately neighboring cells,

1:27:40.600 --> 1:27:43.420
 or it can have an effect on both itself,

1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:44.600
 immediately neighboring cells,

1:27:44.600 --> 1:27:46.440
 and cells far, far away in the body.

1:27:46.440 --> 1:27:50.240
 And that last example of a given chemical

1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:54.240
 or substance having an effect on the cell that produced it,

1:27:54.240 --> 1:27:56.400
 plus neighboring cells, plus cells far away,

1:27:56.400 --> 1:27:57.520
 is an endocrine effect.

1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:01.360
 And a lot of hormones not all work in this fashion.

1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:04.620
 Hence why we sometimes hear about endocrine and hormone

1:28:04.620 --> 1:28:06.020
 is kind of synonymous terms.

1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:10.900
 Your bones make chemicals that travel in the bloodstream

1:28:10.900 --> 1:28:12.340
 and have these endocrine effects.

1:28:12.340 --> 1:28:14.000
 So they're effectively acting as hormones.

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.280
 And one such chemical is something called osteocalcin.

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:19.560
 Now these findings arrive to us through various labs,

1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:20.860
 but one of the more important labs

1:28:20.860 --> 1:28:22.680
 for sake of this discussion today

1:28:22.680 --> 1:28:24.440
 is the laboratory of Eric Kandel

1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:26.460
 at Columbia Medical School.

1:28:26.460 --> 1:28:29.160
 Eric is now, I believe in his mid to late 90s,

1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:32.160
 still very sharp, and has studied learning and memory.

1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:34.840
 It also turns out that he is an avid swimmer.

1:28:34.840 --> 1:28:37.540
 Now I happen to know that Eric swims anywhere

1:28:37.540 --> 1:28:39.960
 from a half a mile to a mile a day.

1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:42.440
 And again, this is anecdotal.

1:28:42.440 --> 1:28:44.720
 This is, I'm not referring to the published data just yet,

1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:48.280
 but he credits that exercise as one of the ways

1:28:48.280 --> 1:28:50.100
 in which he keeps his brain sharp

1:28:50.100 --> 1:28:54.180
 and has indeed kept his brain sharp for many, many decades.

1:28:54.180 --> 1:28:55.960
 And as I mentioned before, he's well into his 90s,

1:28:55.960 --> 1:28:57.360
 so pretty impressive.

1:28:57.360 --> 1:29:00.640
 His laboratory has studied the effects of exercise

1:29:00.640 --> 1:29:02.760
 on hippocampal function and memory,

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.240
 and other laboratories have done that as well.

1:29:05.240 --> 1:29:08.440
 And what they found is that cardiovascular exercise

1:29:08.440 --> 1:29:10.200
 and perhaps other forms of exercise too,

1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:12.740
 but mainly cardiovascular exercise,

1:29:12.740 --> 1:29:16.020
 creates the release of osteocalcin from the bones

1:29:16.020 --> 1:29:17.560
 that travels to the brain

1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:19.880
 and to subregions of the hippocampus,

1:29:19.880 --> 1:29:22.920
 and encourages the electrical activity

1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:25.740
 and the formation and maintenance of connections

1:29:25.740 --> 1:29:27.420
 within the hippocampus,

1:29:27.420 --> 1:29:29.320
 and keeps the hippocampus functioning well

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:31.440
 in order to lay down new memories.

1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:33.480
 Now, osteocalcin has a lot of effects

1:29:33.480 --> 1:29:36.320
 besides just improving the function of the hippocampus.

1:29:36.320 --> 1:29:39.360
 Osteocalcin is involved in bone growth itself.

1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:41.240
 It's involved in hormone regulation.

1:29:41.240 --> 1:29:42.920
 In fact, there's really nice evidence

1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:45.980
 that it can regulate testosterone and estrogen production

1:29:45.980 --> 1:29:47.480
 by the testes and ovaries,

1:29:47.480 --> 1:29:49.880
 and a bunch of other effects in other organs of the body,

1:29:49.880 --> 1:29:52.120
 because again, it's acting in this endocrine manner.

1:29:52.120 --> 1:29:54.380
 It's arriving from bone

1:29:54.380 --> 1:29:56.640
 to a lot of different organs to have effects.

1:29:57.520 --> 1:29:59.840
 Load-bearing exercise in particular

1:29:59.840 --> 1:30:01.640
 turns out to be important

1:30:01.640 --> 1:30:03.640
 for inducing the release of osteocalcin.

1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:06.800
 And when you think about this, it makes sense.

1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:08.920
 A nervous system exists for a lot of reasons,

1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:10.240
 to sense, perceive, et cetera.

1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:12.160
 You've got taste, you've got smell, you've got hearing.

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:15.080
 But the vast majority of brain real estate,

1:30:15.080 --> 1:30:18.060
 especially in humans, is dedicated to two things.

1:30:18.060 --> 1:30:19.840
 One, vision.

1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:21.720
 We have an enormous amount of brain real estate

1:30:21.720 --> 1:30:25.560
 devoted to vision, certainly compared to other senses,

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:27.040
 and to movement,

1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:29.520
 the ability to generate coarse movements of the body,

1:30:29.520 --> 1:30:32.480
 the ability, excuse me, to generate fine movements

1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:34.600
 of the body, like the digits, or to wink one eye,

1:30:34.600 --> 1:30:36.440
 or to tilt your head in a particular way,

1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:37.860
 or move your lips, or move your face,

1:30:37.860 --> 1:30:39.060
 and do all sorts of different things

1:30:39.060 --> 1:30:42.080
 in a very nuanced and detailed way.

1:30:42.080 --> 1:30:45.080
 So much of our brain real estate is devoted to movement,

1:30:45.080 --> 1:30:49.440
 that it's been hypothesized for more than a half century,

1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:51.120
 but especially in recent years,

1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:52.920
 as we've learned more about the function of the brain

1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:54.840
 at a really detailed circuit level,

1:30:54.840 --> 1:30:58.040
 that the relationship between the brain and body

1:30:58.040 --> 1:31:00.200
 and the maintenance,

1:31:00.200 --> 1:31:02.360
 and perhaps even the improvement of neural circuitry

1:31:02.360 --> 1:31:04.920
 in the brain, depends on our body movements

1:31:04.920 --> 1:31:08.480
 and the signal from the body that our brain is still moving.

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:09.320
 So think about that.

1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:11.920
 How would your brain know if your body was moving regularly

1:31:11.920 --> 1:31:13.600
 and how would it know how much it was moving?

1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:15.960
 How would it know which limbs it was moving?

1:31:15.960 --> 1:31:18.680
 Well, you could say, if the heart rate is increased,

1:31:18.680 --> 1:31:20.200
 then the blood flow will be increased,

1:31:20.200 --> 1:31:21.940
 and then the brain will know.

1:31:21.940 --> 1:31:24.600
 Ah, but how does your brain know

1:31:24.600 --> 1:31:27.280
 that it's increased blood flow due to movement

1:31:27.280 --> 1:31:29.980
 and not to, for instance, just stress, right?

1:31:29.980 --> 1:31:31.080
 Maybe you actually can't move

1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:32.300
 and you're very stressed about that,

1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:33.800
 and so the increased blood flow

1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:37.260
 is simply a consequence of increased stress.

1:31:38.780 --> 1:31:42.880
 The fact that osteocalcin is released from bone,

1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:44.720
 and in particular can be released

1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:46.900
 in response to load-bearing exercise,

1:31:46.900 --> 1:31:48.400
 so this would be running.

1:31:48.400 --> 1:31:50.480
 Again, weightlifting hasn't been tested directly,

1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:53.000
 but one would imagine anything that involves jumping

1:31:53.000 --> 1:31:57.380
 and landing or weightlifting or body weight movements

1:31:57.380 --> 1:31:59.320
 and things of that sort.

1:31:59.320 --> 1:32:01.840
 That's a signal to release osteocalcin,

1:32:01.840 --> 1:32:03.960
 and we know that signal occurs,

1:32:03.960 --> 1:32:08.480
 that is directly reflective of the fact

1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:11.200
 that the body was moving and moving in particular ways.

1:32:11.200 --> 1:32:13.840
 In fact, you could imagine that big bones,

1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:16.240
 like your femur, are going to release more osteocalcin

1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:18.280
 or be in a position to release more osteocalcin

1:32:18.280 --> 1:32:21.240
 than fine movements, like the movements of the digits.

1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:24.480
 And this idea that the body is constantly signaling

1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:26.720
 to the brain about the status of the body

1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:29.100
 and the varying needs of the brain

1:32:29.100 --> 1:32:33.680
 to update its brain circuitry is a really attractive idea

1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:36.840
 that fits entirely with the biology of exercise,

1:32:36.840 --> 1:32:39.520
 osteocalcin, and hippocampal function.

1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:42.440
 I do want to mention that I'm not the first

1:32:42.440 --> 1:32:43.760
 to raise this hypothesis.

1:32:43.760 --> 1:32:45.660
 This hypothesis actually was discussed

1:32:45.660 --> 1:32:48.060
 in a fair amount of detail by John Rady,

1:32:48.060 --> 1:32:50.280
 who's a professor in Harvard Medical School.

1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:51.720
 He wrote a book called Spark,

1:32:51.720 --> 1:32:54.240
 which was one of the early books,

1:32:54.240 --> 1:32:56.160
 at least from an academic, about brain plasticity

1:32:56.160 --> 1:32:57.640
 and the relationship between exercise

1:32:57.640 --> 1:32:59.280
 and movement in plasticity.

1:32:59.280 --> 1:33:01.940
 And John, who I have the good fortune to know,

1:33:01.940 --> 1:33:03.860
 has described to me experiments,

1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:05.480
 or I should say observations,

1:33:05.480 --> 1:33:09.400
 of species of ocean-dwelling animals that have,

1:33:09.400 --> 1:33:11.040
 at least for the early part of their life,

1:33:11.040 --> 1:33:14.160
 a very robust and complicated nervous system.

1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:17.440
 But then these particular animals are in the habit

1:33:17.440 --> 1:33:19.380
 of plopping down onto a rock.

1:33:19.380 --> 1:33:21.720
 They find a kind of a safe, comfy space,

1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:24.000
 and they actually stick to that rock,

1:33:24.000 --> 1:33:26.960
 and they don't move anymore for a certain portion,

1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:29.100
 I should say the late portion of their life.

1:33:29.100 --> 1:33:31.640
 And it is at the transition between moving a lot

1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:33.540
 and being stationary that those animals

1:33:33.540 --> 1:33:36.440
 actually digest their own brain.

1:33:36.440 --> 1:33:38.920
 They literally metabolize a good portion

1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:40.760
 of their nervous system because they decide,

1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:43.580
 well, don't need this anymore, and gobble it up,

1:33:43.580 --> 1:33:46.280
 use it for its nutritional value,

1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:49.800
 and then sit there like a moron version of themselves

1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:53.860
 with a limited amount of brain tissue

1:33:53.860 --> 1:33:55.420
 because they don't need to move anymore.

1:33:55.420 --> 1:33:57.120
 Now, I certainly don't want to give the message

1:33:57.120 --> 1:33:59.200
 that just moving, just exercise,

1:33:59.200 --> 1:34:01.480
 is sufficient to keep the neural architecture

1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:04.640
 of your brain healthy, young, and able to learn.

1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:06.380
 While that might be true,

1:34:06.380 --> 1:34:08.740
 it's also important to actually engage in attempts

1:34:08.740 --> 1:34:11.600
 to learn new material, either physical material,

1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:14.600
 so new types of movements and skills,

1:34:14.600 --> 1:34:16.960
 and or new types of cognitive information,

1:34:16.960 --> 1:34:20.840
 languages, mathematics, history, current events,

1:34:20.840 --> 1:34:23.720
 all sorts of things that involve your brain.

1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:26.780
 Nonetheless, it's clear that physical movement

1:34:26.780 --> 1:34:29.440
 and cognitive ability and the potential

1:34:29.440 --> 1:34:31.360
 to enhance cognitive ability

1:34:31.360 --> 1:34:33.280
 and the ability to learn new physical skills

1:34:33.280 --> 1:34:34.960
 are intimately connected.

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:38.400
 And osteocalcin appears to be at least one way

1:34:38.400 --> 1:34:40.040
 in which that brain-body relationship

1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:41.680
 is established and maintained.

1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:45.280
 So given the information about osteocalcin and movement,

1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:48.960
 and given the information about spiking adrenaline late

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:52.300
 or after a period of attempt to learn,

1:34:52.300 --> 1:34:55.120
 you might be asking, when is the best time to exercise?

1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:58.020
 Now, unfortunately, that has not been addressed

1:34:58.020 --> 1:34:59.800
 in a lot of varying detail

1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:02.720
 where every sort of variation on the theme

1:35:02.720 --> 1:35:03.680
 has been carried out.

1:35:03.680 --> 1:35:05.400
 And yet, Wendy Suzuki's lab

1:35:05.400 --> 1:35:07.720
 has done really beautiful experiments

1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:10.220
 where they have people exercise,

1:35:10.220 --> 1:35:11.860
 generally it was in the morning,

1:35:11.860 --> 1:35:14.640
 but at other periods of the day as well.

1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:17.600
 And what they find is that at least as late

1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:20.680
 as two hours after that exercise,

1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:23.240
 there's an enhancement in learning and memory.

1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:24.440
 Now, I want to be clear,

1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:26.760
 we don't know whether or not that exercise

1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:29.580
 led to big increases in adrenaline.

1:35:29.580 --> 1:35:33.600
 It may be that those forms of exercise were modest enough

1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:35.500
 or didn't challenge people enough

1:35:35.500 --> 1:35:37.600
 that they merely got a lot of blood flow going

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:39.220
 and that the improvements in learning and memory

1:35:39.220 --> 1:35:40.380
 were related to blood flow,

1:35:40.380 --> 1:35:43.920
 and we presume increases in osteocalcin.

1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:45.280
 However, you could imagine

1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:48.100
 a couple of different logical protocols

1:35:48.100 --> 1:35:50.060
 based on what we've talked about.

1:35:50.060 --> 1:35:51.880
 Let's say you were going to do a form of exercise

1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:53.560
 that was going to spike adrenaline a lot.

1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:55.400
 So this would be exercise

1:35:55.400 --> 1:35:56.840
 that really challenges your system

1:35:56.840 --> 1:35:59.160
 and forces you to kind of push through a burn, right?

1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:01.960
 So here I'm mainly thinking about cardiovascular exercise,

1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:04.760
 but it could even be yoga,

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:07.200
 it could be resistance training.

1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:09.840
 If it's going to give you a big spike in adrenaline,

1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:12.400
 it's going to take some serious effort,

1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:15.080
 then logically speaking,

1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:17.440
 you would want to place that after a learning bout

1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:19.160
 in order to increase learning and memory.

1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:21.760
 However, if you're using the exercise

1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:23.480
 in order to enhance blood flow

1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:26.120
 and to enhance osteocalcin release

1:36:26.120 --> 1:36:28.760
 in efforts to augment the function of your hippocampus,

1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:31.760
 I think it stands to reason that doing that exercise

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:35.400
 sometime within the hour to three hours

1:36:35.400 --> 1:36:37.880
 preceding an attempt to learn makes a lot of sense.

1:36:37.880 --> 1:36:39.480
 And there I'm basing it on the human data

1:36:39.480 --> 1:36:41.080
 from Wendy Suzuki's lab,

1:36:41.080 --> 1:36:43.360
 I'm basing it on the studies from Eric Kandel

1:36:43.360 --> 1:36:45.320
 and from others labs.

1:36:45.320 --> 1:36:48.040
 Again, right now there hasn't been an evaluation

1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:49.840
 of a lot of different protocols to arrive

1:36:49.840 --> 1:36:53.500
 at the peer reviewed laboratory super protocol.

1:36:53.500 --> 1:36:55.640
 However, since what we're talking about

1:36:55.640 --> 1:36:57.520
 is using activities like exercise

1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:00.520
 that most of us probably, perhaps all of us

1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:02.520
 should be doing regularly anyway.

1:37:02.520 --> 1:37:04.640
 And I do believe most, if not all of us

1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:06.440
 should probably regularly be trying to learn

1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:08.080
 and keep our brain functioning well

1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:09.040
 and acquire new knowledge

1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:10.740
 because it's just a wonderful part of life.

1:37:10.740 --> 1:37:12.160
 And there is evidence that that actually

1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:14.600
 can keep your brain young, so to speak.

1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:18.960
 Well then, exercising either before or after

1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:21.540
 a learning bout makes a lot of sense

1:37:21.540 --> 1:37:24.180
 with the emphasis on after a learning bout

1:37:24.180 --> 1:37:26.480
 if the form of exercise spikes a lot of adrenaline

1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:28.440
 for all the reasons we talked about before.

1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:30.620
 Okay, so we've talked about two major categories

1:37:30.620 --> 1:37:33.120
 of protocols to improve memory that are grounded

1:37:33.120 --> 1:37:35.240
 in quality peer reviewed science.

1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:37.760
 And there is yet another third protocol

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:39.440
 that we'll talk about in a few minutes.

1:37:39.440 --> 1:37:40.760
 But before we do that,

1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:43.320
 I want to briefly touch on an aspect of memory.

1:37:43.320 --> 1:37:44.760
 In fact, two aspects of memory

1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:46.960
 that I get a lot of questions about.

1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:50.800
 The first one is photographic memory.

1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:52.920
 To be clear, there are people out there

1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:54.760
 who have a true photographic memory.

1:37:54.760 --> 1:37:56.600
 They can look at a page of text,

1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:57.840
 they can scan it with their eyes,

1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:00.760
 and they can essentially commit that to memory

1:38:00.760 --> 1:38:03.200
 with very little, if any effort.

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:04.920
 While it might seem that having a photographic memory

1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:06.860
 is a very attractive skill to have,

1:38:06.860 --> 1:38:09.060
 I should caution you against believing that

1:38:09.060 --> 1:38:10.700
 because it turns out that people

1:38:10.700 --> 1:38:12.080
 with true photographic memory

1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:14.160
 are often very challenged at remembering

1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:15.560
 things that they hear,

1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:18.800
 and oftentimes are not so good at learning physical skills.

1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:21.000
 It's not always the case, but often that's the case.

1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:22.720
 So be careful what you wish for.

1:38:22.720 --> 1:38:24.400
 If you do have a photographic memory,

1:38:24.400 --> 1:38:25.580
 there are certain professions

1:38:25.580 --> 1:38:29.640
 that lend themselves particularly well to you.

1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:31.760
 And indeed, a lot of people with photographic memory

1:38:31.760 --> 1:38:34.940
 have to find a profession and have to move through life

1:38:34.940 --> 1:38:38.840
 in a way that is in concert with that photographic memory.

1:38:38.840 --> 1:38:41.240
 So again, it's a super ability,

1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:42.280
 it's a hyper ability,

1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:43.920
 and yet it's not necessarily one

1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:46.360
 that is desirable for most people.

1:38:46.360 --> 1:38:47.360
 There's also this category

1:38:47.360 --> 1:38:49.440
 of what are called super recognizers.

1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:51.020
 These people are, I should mention,

1:38:51.020 --> 1:38:53.320
 highly employable by government agencies.

1:38:53.320 --> 1:38:58.320
 These are people that have an absolutely astonishing ability

1:38:58.820 --> 1:39:01.960
 to recognize faces and to match faces to templates.

1:39:01.960 --> 1:39:04.640
 They can look at a photograph of, say,

1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:07.360
 somebody on a most wanted list,

1:39:07.360 --> 1:39:10.680
 and then they can look at video footage

1:39:10.680 --> 1:39:13.360
 of, let's say, an airport or a mall or a city street

1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:15.240
 at fairly low resolution,

1:39:15.240 --> 1:39:18.420
 and they can spot the person whose face matches

1:39:18.420 --> 1:39:20.360
 that photograph that they looked at.

1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:25.360
 Even if that video or other footage is of people's profiles

1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:28.200
 or even the tops of their heads

1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:29.380
 and just a portion of their forehead,

1:39:29.380 --> 1:39:32.160
 these people have just an incredible ability

1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:34.440
 to recognize faces and to template match.

1:39:34.440 --> 1:39:37.560
 And again, these people often will take jobs with agencies

1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:39.760
 where this sort of thing is important.

1:39:39.760 --> 1:39:42.560
 Some of you out there probably are super recognizers

1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:44.140
 and may or may not notice it.

1:39:44.140 --> 1:39:46.180
 If you've ever had the experience of watching a movie

1:39:46.180 --> 1:39:47.620
 and thought to yourself,

1:39:47.620 --> 1:39:52.360
 wow, her mouth looks so much like my cousin's mouth,

1:39:52.360 --> 1:39:56.360
 or you look at a character in a movie or television show

1:39:56.360 --> 1:39:59.240
 and you think, wow, they look almost like

1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:01.680
 the younger sister of so-and-so,

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:05.920
 well, then it's very likely that you have this,

1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:09.080
 or at least a mild form of this super recognizer ability.

1:40:09.080 --> 1:40:11.640
 That is not memory per se.

1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:14.320
 That is the hyperfunctioning of an area of the brain

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:16.960
 that we call the fusiform gyrus.

1:40:16.960 --> 1:40:20.840
 The fusiform gyrus is literally a face recognition area

1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:22.880
 and a face template matching area,

1:40:22.880 --> 1:40:25.840
 and it harbors neurons that respond to faces generally.

1:40:25.840 --> 1:40:29.040
 So as humans and other non-human primates

1:40:29.040 --> 1:40:31.700
 care a lot about faces and their emotional content,

1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:35.020
 and the identity of faces is super important to us

1:40:35.020 --> 1:40:38.200
 for all the kinds of reasons that are probably obvious,

1:40:38.200 --> 1:40:40.900
 knowing who's friend, who's foe, who do you know well,

1:40:40.900 --> 1:40:43.840
 who's famous, who's not famous, et cetera.

1:40:43.840 --> 1:40:45.700
 That is not memory per se.

1:40:45.700 --> 1:40:48.100
 And yet, if you're a super recognizer,

1:40:48.100 --> 1:40:51.920
 or I guess we could call it a moderate face recognizer,

1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:54.080
 or not very good at recognizing faces,

1:40:54.080 --> 1:40:55.200
 because indeed there are some people

1:40:55.200 --> 1:40:56.900
 that are kind of face blind,

1:40:56.900 --> 1:40:59.040
 they don't actually recognize people.

1:40:59.040 --> 1:40:59.880
 When they walk in the room,

1:40:59.880 --> 1:41:01.040
 I used to work with somebody like this,

1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:02.680
 I'd walk into his office and he'd say,

1:41:02.680 --> 1:41:04.960
 are you rich or are you Andrew?

1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:08.220
 I'd say, well, am I rich rich, like, you know, wealth rich?

1:41:08.220 --> 1:41:09.060
 No.

1:41:09.060 --> 1:41:11.560
 And he'd say, no, are you Richard or are you Andrew?

1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:13.680
 And I'd say, I'm Andrew, we know each other really well.

1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:16.080
 He said, oh, I'm sorry, I'm kind of face blind.

1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:18.920
 And it actually tend to be better or worse

1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:21.220
 depending on how much he was working.

1:41:21.220 --> 1:41:24.080
 Ironically, the more rested he was,

1:41:24.080 --> 1:41:25.520
 the more face blind he would become.

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:27.160
 So it wasn't a sleep deprivation thing.

1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:28.280
 That exists, that's out there.

1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:30.200
 There's the full constellation

1:41:30.200 --> 1:41:32.240
 of people's ability to recognize faces.

1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:33.380
 That's not really memory.

1:41:33.380 --> 1:41:37.680
 And yet visual function is a profoundly powerful way

1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:39.140
 in which we can enhance our memory.

1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:41.800
 So whether or not you're a super recognizer of faces,

1:41:41.800 --> 1:41:45.160
 whether or not you are face blind or anything in between.

1:41:45.160 --> 1:41:47.400
 Next, I'm going to tell you about a study

1:41:47.400 --> 1:41:52.120
 which points out the immense value of visual images

1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:54.140
 for laying down memories.

1:41:54.140 --> 1:41:56.120
 And you can leverage this information.

1:41:56.120 --> 1:41:58.280
 And this involves both the taking a photograph,

1:41:58.280 --> 1:41:59.760
 something that's actually quite easy,

1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:01.560
 easily done these days with your phone,

1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:04.240
 as well as your ability to take mental photographs

1:42:04.240 --> 1:42:06.680
 by literally snapping your eyelid shut.

1:42:06.680 --> 1:42:08.440
 So I just briefly want to describe this paper

1:42:08.440 --> 1:42:10.760
 because it provides a tool that you can leverage

1:42:10.760 --> 1:42:14.120
 in your attempt to learn and remember things better.

1:42:14.120 --> 1:42:16.980
 The title of this paper is Photographic Memory,

1:42:16.980 --> 1:42:19.120
 the effects of our volitional photo taking

1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:22.800
 on memory for visual and auditory aspects of an experience.

1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:24.780
 I really liked this paper

1:42:24.780 --> 1:42:27.680
 because it refers to photographic memory,

1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:30.160
 not in the context of photographic memory

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:31.120
 that we normally hear about

1:42:31.120 --> 1:42:32.760
 where people are truly photographic,

1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:35.600
 look at a page and somehow absorb all that information

1:42:35.600 --> 1:42:36.680
 and commit it to memory,

1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:39.600
 but rather the use of camera photographs

1:42:39.600 --> 1:42:42.840
 or the use of mental camera photographs,

1:42:42.840 --> 1:42:45.400
 literally looking at something and deciding blink

1:42:45.400 --> 1:42:47.360
 and snapping a, so to speak,

1:42:47.360 --> 1:42:50.180
 snapping a snapshot of whatever it is

1:42:50.180 --> 1:42:52.440
 that you were looking at and remembering the content.

1:42:52.440 --> 1:42:53.640
 The reason I like this paper

1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:55.520
 and the reason I'm attracted to this issue

1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:57.200
 of mental snapshots is this is something

1:42:57.200 --> 1:42:58.360
 that I've been doing since I was a kid.

1:42:58.360 --> 1:42:59.620
 I don't know why I started doing it,

1:42:59.620 --> 1:43:03.440
 but every once in a while, I would say maybe twice a year,

1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:04.480
 I would look at something

1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:07.440
 and decide to just snap a mental snapshot of it.

1:43:07.440 --> 1:43:09.120
 And I've maintained very clear memories

1:43:09.120 --> 1:43:10.560
 of those visual scenes.

1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:14.800
 Two years ago, I was in an Uber and I looked out the window

1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:15.640
 and it was a street scene.

1:43:15.640 --> 1:43:17.360
 I was actually in New York at the time.

1:43:17.360 --> 1:43:21.120
 And I decided for reasons that are still unclear to me

1:43:21.120 --> 1:43:23.400
 to take a mental snapshot of this city street image,

1:43:23.400 --> 1:43:26.320
 even though nothing interesting in particular was happening.

1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:29.800
 And I do recall that there was a guy wearing a yellow shirt,

1:43:29.800 --> 1:43:31.440
 walking, there was some construction, et cetera.

1:43:31.440 --> 1:43:33.720
 I can still see that image in my mind's eye

1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:35.560
 because I took this mental snapshot.

1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:36.800
 This paper addresses whether or not

1:43:36.800 --> 1:43:38.780
 this mental snapshotting thing is real.

1:43:38.780 --> 1:43:42.040
 And this is something that I think a lot of people

1:43:42.040 --> 1:43:44.740
 will resonate with, whether or not the constant taking

1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:47.240
 of pictures on our phones or with other devices

1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:50.140
 is either improving or degrading our memory.

1:43:50.140 --> 1:43:52.560
 You can imagine an argument for both.

1:43:52.560 --> 1:43:53.800
 A lot of people are taking pictures

1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:55.680
 that they never look at again.

1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:59.360
 And so in a sense, they're outsourcing their visual memory

1:43:59.360 --> 1:44:03.440
 of events into their phone or to some other device.

1:44:03.440 --> 1:44:06.160
 And they're not ever accessing the actual image again.

1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:07.280
 They're not looking at it, right?

1:44:07.280 --> 1:44:08.640
 You're not printing out those photos.

1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:10.060
 You're not scanning through your phone again.

1:44:10.060 --> 1:44:11.620
 Sometimes you might do that, but most of the time,

1:44:11.620 --> 1:44:12.460
 people don't.

1:44:12.460 --> 1:44:13.520
 Most of the photographs that people take in,

1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:15.000
 they're not revisiting again.

1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:16.780
 So the motivation for this study was that

1:44:16.780 --> 1:44:19.720
 previous experiments had shown that

1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:24.440
 if people take photos of a scene or a person or an object,

1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:27.700
 that they are actually less good at remembering

1:44:27.700 --> 1:44:31.220
 the details of that scene or object, et cetera.

1:44:32.160 --> 1:44:36.300
 This study challenged that idea and raised the hypothesis

1:44:36.300 --> 1:44:39.000
 that if people are allowed to choose

1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:42.140
 what they take photos of, that taking photos,

1:44:42.140 --> 1:44:44.200
 again, this is with a camera, not mental snapshotting,

1:44:44.200 --> 1:44:47.020
 that taking those photos would actually enhance their memory

1:44:47.020 --> 1:44:49.680
 for those objects, those places, those people,

1:44:49.680 --> 1:44:53.080
 and in fact, details of those object places and people.

1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:54.920
 And indeed, that's what they found.

1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:56.940
 So in contrast to previous studies,

1:44:56.940 --> 1:44:59.520
 where people had been more or less told,

1:44:59.520 --> 1:45:01.380
 take photos of these following objects

1:45:01.380 --> 1:45:03.680
 or these following people or these following places,

1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:07.480
 and then they were given a memory test at some point later,

1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:11.280
 in this study, people were given volitional control, right?

1:45:11.280 --> 1:45:13.700
 They were given agency in making the decision

1:45:13.700 --> 1:45:15.000
 of what to take photos of.

1:45:15.000 --> 1:45:16.240
 And I'll just summarize the results.

1:45:16.240 --> 1:45:17.500
 We'll provide a link to this study.

1:45:17.500 --> 1:45:19.900
 I should say that some of the stuff that they tested

1:45:19.900 --> 1:45:21.520
 was actually pretty challenging.

1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:24.940
 Some of them were pottery and other forms of ceramics

1:45:24.940 --> 1:45:26.600
 that are of the sort that you see

1:45:26.600 --> 1:45:28.580
 if you go to a big museum in a big city,

1:45:28.580 --> 1:45:29.480
 and if you've ever done that

1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:31.120
 and you see all the different objects,

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:32.600
 there are a lot of details in those objects,

1:45:32.600 --> 1:45:35.300
 and a lot of those objects look a lot alike.

1:45:35.300 --> 1:45:37.700
 And so, you know, some will have two handles,

1:45:37.700 --> 1:45:39.660
 some will have one handle, the position of the handles,

1:45:39.660 --> 1:45:42.480
 how broad or narrow these things are.

1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:44.460
 You know, a lot of this is pretty detailed stuff.

1:45:44.460 --> 1:45:47.280
 They also took photos of other things.

1:45:47.280 --> 1:45:49.140
 So basically what they found was that

1:45:49.140 --> 1:45:50.860
 if people take pictures of things

1:45:50.860 --> 1:45:53.460
 and they choose which things they are taking pictures of,

1:45:53.460 --> 1:45:55.240
 right, it's up to them, it's volitional,

1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:00.240
 that there's enhanced memory for those objects later on.

1:46:01.820 --> 1:46:04.380
 However, it degraded their ability

1:46:04.380 --> 1:46:06.180
 to remember auditory information.

1:46:06.180 --> 1:46:07.020
 So what this means is that

1:46:07.020 --> 1:46:11.060
 when we take a picture of something or a person,

1:46:11.060 --> 1:46:14.620
 we are stamping down a visual memory of that thing,

1:46:14.620 --> 1:46:16.840
 and that makes sense, it's a photograph after all,

1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:19.060
 but we are actually inhibiting our ability

1:46:19.060 --> 1:46:22.460
 to remember the auditory, the sound components

1:46:22.460 --> 1:46:24.560
 of that visual scene or what the person was saying.

1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:26.460
 Very interesting, and points to the fact

1:46:26.460 --> 1:46:29.140
 that the visual system can out-compete the auditory system,

1:46:29.140 --> 1:46:30.980
 at least in terms of how the hippocampus

1:46:30.980 --> 1:46:32.740
 is encoding this information.

1:46:32.740 --> 1:46:34.720
 The other finding I find particularly interesting

1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:38.420
 within this study is that it didn't matter

1:46:38.420 --> 1:46:40.520
 whether or not they ever looked at the photos again.

1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:42.940
 So they actually had people take photos

1:46:42.940 --> 1:46:45.600
 or not take photos of different objects.

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:47.660
 They had some people keep their photos

1:46:47.660 --> 1:46:49.340
 and they had other people delete their photos,

1:46:49.340 --> 1:46:52.260
 and turns out that whether or not people kept the photos

1:46:52.260 --> 1:46:53.980
 or deleted those photos had no bearing

1:46:53.980 --> 1:46:56.420
 on whether or not they were better or worse

1:46:56.420 --> 1:46:58.020
 at remembering things, they were always better

1:46:58.020 --> 1:47:01.020
 at remembering them as compared to not taking photos of them.

1:47:01.020 --> 1:47:01.860
 What does this mean?

1:47:01.860 --> 1:47:03.580
 It means if you really want to remember something

1:47:03.580 --> 1:47:07.600
 or somebody, take a photo of that thing or person,

1:47:07.600 --> 1:47:10.100
 pay attention while you take the photo,

1:47:10.100 --> 1:47:12.020
 but it doesn't really matter if you look at the photo again.

1:47:12.020 --> 1:47:14.500
 Somehow the process of taking that photo,

1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:17.380
 probably looking at it, you know,

1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:19.820
 in a camera typically we'd say through the viewfinder

1:47:19.820 --> 1:47:22.260
 or now because of digital cameras on the screen

1:47:22.260 --> 1:47:25.180
 on the back of that camera or on your phone,

1:47:25.180 --> 1:47:27.020
 that framing up of the photograph

1:47:27.020 --> 1:47:29.020
 stamps down a visual image in your mind

1:47:29.020 --> 1:47:32.020
 that is more robust at serving a memory

1:47:32.020 --> 1:47:34.980
 than had you just looked at that thing with your own eyes.

1:47:34.980 --> 1:47:37.980
 Very interesting and raises all sorts of questions for me

1:47:37.980 --> 1:47:39.980
 about whether or not it's because you're framing up

1:47:39.980 --> 1:47:42.820
 a small aperture or a small portion of the visual scene.

1:47:42.820 --> 1:47:44.420
 That's one logical interpretation,

1:47:44.420 --> 1:47:45.920
 although they didn't test that.

1:47:45.920 --> 1:47:48.280
 I should also say that they found that whether or not

1:47:48.280 --> 1:47:50.580
 you looked at a photo that you took

1:47:50.580 --> 1:47:51.860
 or whether or not you deleted it

1:47:51.860 --> 1:47:53.720
 and never looked at it again,

1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:55.740
 didn't just enhance visual memory

1:47:55.740 --> 1:47:59.000
 or the memory for the visual components of that image,

1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:02.500
 but it always reduced your ability to remember

1:48:02.500 --> 1:48:04.780
 sounds associated with that experience.

1:48:04.780 --> 1:48:06.300
 So that's interesting.

1:48:06.300 --> 1:48:08.100
 And then last but not least,

1:48:08.100 --> 1:48:10.400
 and perhaps most interesting, at least to me,

1:48:10.400 --> 1:48:12.820
 was the fact that you didn't even need a camera

1:48:12.820 --> 1:48:14.560
 to see this effect.

1:48:14.560 --> 1:48:16.500
 If subjects looked at something

1:48:16.500 --> 1:48:19.340
 and took a mental photograph of that thing,

1:48:19.340 --> 1:48:22.140
 it enhanced their visual memory of that thing

1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:26.620
 significantly more than had they not taken a mental picture.

1:48:26.620 --> 1:48:30.260
 In fact, it increased their memory of that thing

1:48:30.260 --> 1:48:32.760
 almost as much as taking an actual photograph

1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:34.360
 with an actual camera.

1:48:34.360 --> 1:48:36.340
 And the reason I find this so interesting

1:48:36.340 --> 1:48:40.500
 is that a lot of what we try and learn is visual.

1:48:40.500 --> 1:48:41.900
 And for a lot of people,

1:48:41.900 --> 1:48:45.900
 the ability to learn visual information feels challenging

1:48:45.900 --> 1:48:47.020
 and we'll look at something

1:48:47.020 --> 1:48:49.860
 and we'll try and create some detailed understanding of it.

1:48:49.860 --> 1:48:51.240
 We'll try and understand the relationships

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:53.380
 between things in that scene.

1:48:53.380 --> 1:48:54.940
 It does appear based on the study

1:48:54.940 --> 1:48:58.380
 that the mere decision to take a mental snapshot,

1:48:58.380 --> 1:48:59.900
 like, okay, I'm going to blink my eyelids

1:48:59.900 --> 1:49:01.700
 and I'm going to take a snapshot of whatever it is I see

1:49:01.700 --> 1:49:04.220
 can actually stamp down a visual memory

1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:07.020
 much in the same way that a camera can stamp down

1:49:07.020 --> 1:49:08.520
 a visual memory, of course,

1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:10.680
 through vastly distinct mechanisms.

1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:13.220
 No discussion of memory would be complete

1:49:13.220 --> 1:49:17.100
 without a discussion of the ever intriguing phenomenon

1:49:17.100 --> 1:49:19.260
 known as deja vu.

1:49:19.260 --> 1:49:21.740
 This sense that we've experienced something before,

1:49:21.740 --> 1:49:23.500
 but we can't quite put our finger on it.

1:49:23.500 --> 1:49:24.980
 Where and when did it happen?

1:49:24.980 --> 1:49:27.260
 Or the sense that we've been someplace before

1:49:27.260 --> 1:49:31.340
 or that we are in a familiar state or place

1:49:31.340 --> 1:49:33.600
 or context of some kind.

1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:36.380
 Now, I've talked about this on the podcast before,

1:49:36.380 --> 1:49:37.860
 at least I think I have,

1:49:37.860 --> 1:49:41.000
 and the way this works has been defined

1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:44.060
 largely by the wonderful work of Susumu Tonogawa

1:49:44.060 --> 1:49:47.340
 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT.

1:49:47.340 --> 1:49:50.660
 Susumu collected a Nobel Prize quite appropriately

1:49:50.660 --> 1:49:52.920
 for his beautiful work on immunology,

1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:55.620
 and he's also a highly accomplished neuroscientist

1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:58.860
 who studies memory and learning and deja vu.

1:49:58.860 --> 1:50:01.860
 And I should also mention the beautiful work of Mark Mayford

1:50:01.860 --> 1:50:04.620
 at the Scripps Institute in UC San Diego,

1:50:04.620 --> 1:50:06.620
 beautiful work on this notion of deja vu.

1:50:06.620 --> 1:50:08.720
 Here's what they discovered.

1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:11.220
 They evaluated the patterns of neural firing

1:50:11.220 --> 1:50:16.220
 in the hippocampus as subjects learn new things, okay?

1:50:16.400 --> 1:50:20.020
 So neuron A fires, then neuron B fires,

1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:22.820
 then neuron C fires in a particular sequence.

1:50:22.820 --> 1:50:25.800
 Again, the firing of neurons in a particular sequence,

1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:28.340
 like the playing of keys on a piano in a particular sequence

1:50:28.340 --> 1:50:30.000
 leads to a particular song on the piano

1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.180
 and leads to a particular memory

1:50:32.180 --> 1:50:34.020
 of an experience within the brain.

1:50:35.300 --> 1:50:39.220
 They then used some molecular tools and tricks

1:50:39.220 --> 1:50:41.940
 to label and capture those neurons

1:50:41.940 --> 1:50:43.980
 such that they could go back later

1:50:43.980 --> 1:50:47.980
 and activate those neurons in either the same sequence

1:50:47.980 --> 1:50:51.140
 or in a different sequence to the one that occurred

1:50:51.140 --> 1:50:53.540
 during the formation of the memory.

1:50:53.540 --> 1:50:55.260
 And to make a long story short,

1:50:55.260 --> 1:50:57.300
 and to summarize multiple papers

1:50:57.300 --> 1:51:00.540
 published in incredibly high tier journals,

1:51:00.540 --> 1:51:02.060
 journals like Nature and Science,

1:51:02.060 --> 1:51:03.800
 which are extremely stringent,

1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:08.800
 found that whether or not those particular neurons

1:51:08.940 --> 1:51:10.680
 were played in the precise sequence

1:51:10.680 --> 1:51:13.380
 that happened when they encoded the memory,

1:51:13.380 --> 1:51:15.140
 or whether or not those neurons were played

1:51:15.140 --> 1:51:16.660
 in a different sequence,

1:51:16.660 --> 1:51:19.580
 or even if those neurons were played,

1:51:19.580 --> 1:51:24.580
 activated that is, all at once with no temporal sequence,

1:51:24.580 --> 1:51:27.540
 all firing in concert, all at once,

1:51:28.580 --> 1:51:31.720
 evoked the same behavior,

1:51:31.720 --> 1:51:34.980
 and in some sense, the same memory.

1:51:34.980 --> 1:51:38.940
 So at a neural circuit level, this is deja vu.

1:51:38.940 --> 1:51:41.300
 This is a different pattern of firing

1:51:41.300 --> 1:51:42.700
 of neurons in the brain,

1:51:42.700 --> 1:51:46.220
 leading to the same sense of what happened,

1:51:46.220 --> 1:51:51.100
 leading to a particular emotional state or behavior.

1:51:51.100 --> 1:51:54.180
 Now, whether or not the same sort of phenomenon occurs

1:51:54.180 --> 1:51:55.420
 when you're walking down the street

1:51:55.420 --> 1:51:57.160
 and suddenly you feel as if,

1:51:57.160 --> 1:51:58.580
 wow, I feel like I've been here before.

1:51:58.580 --> 1:51:59.720
 You meet someone and you feel like,

1:51:59.720 --> 1:52:01.180
 gosh, I feel like I know you.

1:52:01.180 --> 1:52:03.340
 I feel like there's some familiarity here

1:52:03.340 --> 1:52:04.760
 that I can't quite put my finger on.

1:52:04.760 --> 1:52:07.660
 We don't know for sure that that's what's happening,

1:52:07.660 --> 1:52:11.820
 but this is the most mechanistic and logical explanation

1:52:11.820 --> 1:52:15.740
 for what has for many decades, if not hundreds of years,

1:52:15.740 --> 1:52:17.660
 has been described as deja vu.

1:52:17.660 --> 1:52:20.500
 So for those of you that experienced deja vu often,

1:52:20.500 --> 1:52:23.660
 just know that this reflects a normal pattern

1:52:23.660 --> 1:52:27.940
 of encoding experiences and events within your hippocampus.

1:52:27.940 --> 1:52:30.820
 I'm not aware of any pathological situations

1:52:30.820 --> 1:52:34.800
 where the presence of deja vu inhibits daily life.

1:52:34.800 --> 1:52:37.420
 Some people like the sensation of deja vu.

1:52:37.420 --> 1:52:38.640
 Other people don't.

1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:41.820
 Almost everybody, however, describes it as somewhat eerie,

1:52:41.820 --> 1:52:44.300
 this idea that even though you're in a very different place,

1:52:44.300 --> 1:52:46.900
 even though you're interacting with a very different person,

1:52:46.900 --> 1:52:50.980
 that you could somehow feel as if this has happened before.

1:52:50.980 --> 1:52:53.780
 And just realize this, that your hippocampus,

1:52:53.780 --> 1:52:57.700
 while it is exquisitely good at encoding

1:52:57.700 --> 1:53:02.700
 new types of perceptions, new experiences, new emotions,

1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:07.180
 new contingencies and relationships of life events,

1:53:07.180 --> 1:53:08.900
 it is not infinitely large,

1:53:08.900 --> 1:53:12.900
 nor does it have an infinite bucket full of different

1:53:12.900 --> 1:53:15.540
 options of different sequences for those neurons to play.

1:53:15.540 --> 1:53:17.820
 So in a lot of ways, it makes perfect sense

1:53:17.820 --> 1:53:20.620
 that sometimes we would feel as if a given experience

1:53:20.620 --> 1:53:22.100
 had happened previously.

1:53:22.100 --> 1:53:24.820
 I'd like to cover one additional tool that you can use

1:53:24.820 --> 1:53:26.380
 to improve learning and memory.

1:53:26.380 --> 1:53:29.500
 And I should mention, this is a particularly powerful one,

1:53:29.500 --> 1:53:33.420
 and it's one that I'm definitely going to employ myself.

1:53:34.300 --> 1:53:36.860
 This is based on a paper from none other

1:53:36.860 --> 1:53:39.360
 than Wendy Suzuki at New York University.

1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:40.980
 We talked about her a little bit earlier.

1:53:40.980 --> 1:53:42.900
 And again, she's going to be on the podcast

1:53:42.900 --> 1:53:46.380
 in our next episode, and is just an incredible researcher.

1:53:46.380 --> 1:53:47.820
 I've known Wendy for a number of years,

1:53:47.820 --> 1:53:50.200
 and it's only in the last, I would say five or six years,

1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:52.340
 that she's really shifted her laboratory

1:53:52.340 --> 1:53:56.100
 toward generating protocols that human beings can use.

1:53:56.100 --> 1:53:58.600
 And she's putting that to great effect,

1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:00.420
 great positive effect, I should say,

1:54:00.420 --> 1:54:02.520
 publishing papers of the sort that I'm about to describe,

1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:05.480
 but also incorporating some of these tools and protocols

1:54:05.480 --> 1:54:08.620
 into the learning curriculum and the lifestyle curriculum

1:54:08.620 --> 1:54:12.540
 of students at NYU, which I think is a terrific initiative.

1:54:12.540 --> 1:54:14.020
 So you don't need to be an NYU student

1:54:14.020 --> 1:54:15.600
 in order to benefit from her work.

1:54:15.600 --> 1:54:17.100
 I'm going to tell you about some of that work now,

1:54:17.100 --> 1:54:19.740
 and she'll tell you about this and much more

1:54:19.740 --> 1:54:21.620
 in the episode that follows this one.

1:54:21.620 --> 1:54:23.960
 The title of this paper will tell you a lot

1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:24.920
 about where we're going.

1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:28.740
 The title is, Brief Daily Meditation Enhances Attention,

1:54:28.740 --> 1:54:31.220
 Memory, Mood, and Emotional Regulation

1:54:31.220 --> 1:54:33.900
 in Non-Experienced Meditators.

1:54:33.900 --> 1:54:36.040
 If ever there was an incentive to meditate,

1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:40.300
 it is the data contained within this paper.

1:54:40.300 --> 1:54:41.860
 I want to briefly describe the study.

1:54:41.860 --> 1:54:44.420
 And then I also want to emphasize

1:54:44.420 --> 1:54:47.500
 that when you meditate is absolutely critical.

1:54:47.500 --> 1:54:49.540
 I'll talk about that just at the end.

1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:54.180
 This is a study that involves subjects aged 18 to 45,

1:54:54.180 --> 1:54:56.380
 none of whom were experienced meditators

1:54:56.380 --> 1:54:57.500
 prior to this study.

1:54:59.140 --> 1:55:01.460
 There were two general groups in this study.

1:55:02.460 --> 1:55:06.800
 One group did a 13 minute long meditation.

1:55:06.800 --> 1:55:09.940
 And this meditation was a fairly conventional meditation.

1:55:09.940 --> 1:55:11.840
 They would sit or lie down.

1:55:11.840 --> 1:55:14.980
 They would do somewhat of a body scan evaluating,

1:55:14.980 --> 1:55:16.980
 for instance, how tense or relaxed they felt

1:55:16.980 --> 1:55:19.560
 throughout their body and they would focus on their breathing

1:55:19.560 --> 1:55:21.480
 trying to bring their attention back to their breathing

1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:25.200
 and to the state of their body as the meditation progressed.

1:55:26.100 --> 1:55:28.740
 The other group, which we can call the control group,

1:55:28.740 --> 1:55:31.660
 listened to, of all things, a podcast.

1:55:31.660 --> 1:55:33.480
 They did not listen to this podcast.

1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:36.620
 They listened to Radiolab, which is a popular podcast

1:55:36.620 --> 1:55:38.520
 for an equivalent amount of time,

1:55:38.520 --> 1:55:40.720
 but they were not instructed to do any kind of body scan

1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:43.300
 or pay attention to their breathing.

1:55:43.300 --> 1:55:46.240
 Every subject in the study either meditated daily

1:55:46.240 --> 1:55:49.380
 or listened to a equivalent duration podcast daily

1:55:49.380 --> 1:55:51.860
 for a period of eight weeks.

1:55:51.860 --> 1:55:56.060
 And the experimenters measured a large number of things,

1:55:56.060 --> 1:55:58.020
 of variables, as we say.

1:55:58.020 --> 1:56:00.500
 They looked at measures of emotion regulation.

1:56:00.500 --> 1:56:02.980
 They actually measured cortisol, a stress hormone.

1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:05.220
 They measured, as the title suggests,

1:56:05.220 --> 1:56:07.740
 attention and memory and so forth.

1:56:07.740 --> 1:56:12.260
 And the basic takeaway of this study is that eight weeks,

1:56:12.260 --> 1:56:16.240
 but not four weeks of this daily 13 minute a day meditation

1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:21.240
 had a significant effect in improving attention, memory,

1:56:21.240 --> 1:56:23.060
 mood, and emotion regulation.

1:56:24.540 --> 1:56:26.820
 I find this study to be very interesting

1:56:26.820 --> 1:56:30.080
 and in fact important because most of us have heard

1:56:30.080 --> 1:56:31.860
 about the positive effects of meditation

1:56:31.860 --> 1:56:34.100
 on things like stress reduction

1:56:34.100 --> 1:56:36.700
 or on things such as improving sleep.

1:56:36.700 --> 1:56:39.260
 And I want to come back to sleep in a few moments

1:56:39.260 --> 1:56:42.300
 because it turns out to be very important feature

1:56:42.300 --> 1:56:43.140
 of this study.

1:56:43.140 --> 1:56:45.660
 This particular study I like so much

1:56:45.660 --> 1:56:49.880
 because they used a really broad array of measurements

1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:51.260
 for cognitive function,

1:56:51.260 --> 1:56:53.260
 things like the Wisconsin card sorting task.

1:56:53.260 --> 1:56:55.600
 I'm not going to go into this, things like the Stroop task.

1:56:55.600 --> 1:56:58.700
 And they also, as I mentioned, measured cortisol

1:56:58.700 --> 1:57:03.260
 and many other things, including not surprisingly memory

1:57:03.260 --> 1:57:05.620
 and people's ability to remember

1:57:05.620 --> 1:57:06.740
 certain types of information.

1:57:06.740 --> 1:57:08.820
 In fact, varied types of information.

1:57:08.820 --> 1:57:11.740
 And the basic takeaway was, again,

1:57:11.740 --> 1:57:14.180
 that you could get really robust improvements

1:57:14.180 --> 1:57:16.720
 in learning and memory, mood, and attention

1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:19.620
 from just 13 minutes a day of meditation.

1:57:19.620 --> 1:57:21.380
 Now there's an important twist in this study

1:57:21.380 --> 1:57:22.760
 that I want to emphasize.

1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:25.260
 If you read into the discussion of this study,

1:57:25.260 --> 1:57:30.100
 it's mentioned that somehow meditation did not improve,

1:57:30.100 --> 1:57:32.340
 but actually impaired sleep quality

1:57:32.340 --> 1:57:34.240
 compared to the control subjects.

1:57:34.240 --> 1:57:36.100
 You might think, wow, why would that be?

1:57:36.100 --> 1:57:38.860
 I mean, meditation is supposed to reduce our stress,

1:57:38.860 --> 1:57:40.700
 stress is supposed to inhibit sleep,

1:57:40.700 --> 1:57:44.460
 and therefore why would sleep get worse?

1:57:44.460 --> 1:57:47.040
 Well, what's interesting is the time of day

1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:51.200
 when most of these subjects tended to do their meditation.

1:57:51.200 --> 1:57:52.700
 Most of the subjects in this study

1:57:52.700 --> 1:57:54.400
 did their meditation late in the day.

1:57:54.400 --> 1:57:56.060
 This is often the case in experiments.

1:57:56.060 --> 1:57:58.260
 I know this because we run experiments

1:57:58.260 --> 1:57:59.820
 with human subjects in my laboratory

1:57:59.820 --> 1:58:02.040
 and people are paid some amount of money

1:58:02.040 --> 1:58:03.100
 in order to participate,

1:58:03.100 --> 1:58:05.400
 or they're given something as compensation

1:58:05.400 --> 1:58:06.240
 for being in the study,

1:58:06.240 --> 1:58:09.580
 but oftentimes the meditation, or in the case of my lab,

1:58:09.580 --> 1:58:12.580
 the respiration work or other kinds of things

1:58:12.580 --> 1:58:15.500
 that they're assigned to do are not their top, top priority,

1:58:15.500 --> 1:58:16.580
 and we understand this.

1:58:16.580 --> 1:58:19.020
 But in this study, the majority of subjects here I'm reading

1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:21.340
 completed their meditation sessions

1:58:21.340 --> 1:58:24.460
 from somewhere between 8 and 11 p.m.,

1:58:24.460 --> 1:58:27.660
 and sometimes even between 12 and 3 a.m.

1:58:27.660 --> 1:58:29.300
 I think there probably were a lot of college students

1:58:29.300 --> 1:58:30.460
 enrolled in this study,

1:58:30.460 --> 1:58:33.640
 and their hours often are late shifted.

1:58:33.640 --> 1:58:36.700
 That impaired sleep, and this raises a bigger theme

1:58:36.700 --> 1:58:37.740
 that I think is important.

1:58:37.740 --> 1:58:39.700
 Many times before on this podcast,

1:58:39.700 --> 1:58:41.640
 and certainly in the episode on Mastering Sleep

1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:44.580
 and Conquering or Mastering Stress,

1:58:44.580 --> 1:58:46.820
 those episodes, we talked about the value again

1:58:46.820 --> 1:58:49.840
 of these non-sleep deep rest protocols, NSDR,

1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:53.980
 for reducing the activity of your sympathetic nervous system

1:58:53.980 --> 1:58:56.420
 the alertness, so-called stress arm

1:58:56.420 --> 1:58:58.980
 of your autonomic nervous system,

1:58:58.980 --> 1:59:00.460
 that makes you feel really alert.

1:59:00.460 --> 1:59:04.420
 NSDR is superb for reducing your level of alertness,

1:59:04.420 --> 1:59:05.780
 increasing your level of calmness,

1:59:05.780 --> 1:59:06.740
 and putting you into a so-called

1:59:06.740 --> 1:59:09.860
 more parasympathetic relaxed state.

1:59:09.860 --> 1:59:14.220
 Meditation does that too, but it also increases attention.

1:59:14.220 --> 1:59:16.220
 If you think about meditation,

1:59:16.220 --> 1:59:18.580
 meditation involves focusing on your breath

1:59:18.580 --> 1:59:20.620
 and constantly focusing back on your breath

1:59:20.620 --> 1:59:22.380
 and trying to avoid the distraction of things

1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:24.300
 you're thinking or things that you're hearing

1:59:24.300 --> 1:59:28.000
 and coming so-called back to your body, back to your breath.

1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:33.000
 So meditation is actually has a high attentional load.

1:59:33.100 --> 1:59:35.740
 It requires a lot of prefrontal cortical activity

1:59:35.740 --> 1:59:37.100
 that's involved in attention,

1:59:37.100 --> 1:59:40.660
 which then logically relates

1:59:40.660 --> 1:59:42.820
 to one of the outcomes of this study,

1:59:42.820 --> 1:59:45.220
 which is that attention abilities improved

1:59:45.220 --> 1:59:47.700
 in daily meditators.

1:59:47.700 --> 1:59:50.660
 It also points out that increasing the level of attention

1:59:50.660 --> 1:59:53.060
 and the activity of your prefrontal cortex may,

1:59:53.060 --> 1:59:53.980
 and I want to emphasize may

1:59:53.980 --> 1:59:55.220
 because I'm here I'm speculating

1:59:55.220 --> 1:59:56.540
 about the underlying mechanism,

1:59:56.540 --> 1:59:59.060
 inhibit your ability to fall asleep.

1:59:59.060 --> 2:00:01.140
 So while we have meditation on the one hand

2:00:01.140 --> 2:00:03.060
 that does tend to put us into a calm state,

2:00:03.060 --> 2:00:05.560
 but it is a calm, very focused state.

2:00:05.560 --> 2:00:08.140
 In fact, attention and focus are inherent

2:00:08.140 --> 2:00:10.040
 to most forms of meditation.

2:00:10.040 --> 2:00:12.740
 Non-sleep deep rest, such as yoga nidra,

2:00:12.740 --> 2:00:16.060
 as some of you know it to be, or NSDR.

2:00:16.060 --> 2:00:19.220
 There's a terrific NSDR script that's available free online

2:00:19.220 --> 2:00:20.420
 that's put out by Made For,

2:00:20.420 --> 2:00:22.380
 so you can go to YouTube, NSDR Made For.

2:00:22.380 --> 2:00:25.100
 You can also just do a search for NSDR.

2:00:25.100 --> 2:00:26.900
 There are a number of these available out there,

2:00:26.900 --> 2:00:28.860
 again, at no cost.

2:00:28.860 --> 2:00:32.340
 Those NSDR protocols tend to put people

2:00:32.340 --> 2:00:34.620
 into a state of deep relaxation,

2:00:34.620 --> 2:00:37.980
 but also very low attention.

2:00:37.980 --> 2:00:41.140
 And we have to assume very low activation

2:00:41.140 --> 2:00:42.660
 of the prefrontal cortex.

2:00:42.660 --> 2:00:44.620
 So the takeaways from the study are several fold.

2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:48.260
 First of all, that daily meditation of 13 minutes

2:00:48.260 --> 2:00:51.300
 can enhance your ability to pay attention and to learn.

2:00:51.300 --> 2:00:54.400
 It can truly enhance memory.

2:00:54.400 --> 2:00:57.940
 However, you need to do that for at least eight weeks

2:00:57.940 --> 2:01:00.660
 in order to start to see the effects to occur.

2:01:00.660 --> 2:01:02.900
 And we have to presume that you have to continue

2:01:02.900 --> 2:01:05.280
 those meditation training sessions.

2:01:06.320 --> 2:01:08.340
 In fact, they found that if people

2:01:08.340 --> 2:01:09.740
 only did four weeks of meditation,

2:01:09.740 --> 2:01:11.020
 these effects didn't show up.

2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:13.020
 Now, eight weeks might seem like a long time,

2:01:13.020 --> 2:01:14.600
 but I think that 13 minutes a day

2:01:14.600 --> 2:01:18.500
 is not actually that big of a time commitment.

2:01:18.500 --> 2:01:21.460
 And the results of this study certainly incentivize me

2:01:21.460 --> 2:01:24.860
 to start adopting a, I'm going for 15 minutes a day now.

2:01:24.860 --> 2:01:27.740
 I've been an on and off meditator for a number of years.

2:01:27.740 --> 2:01:29.180
 I've been pretty good about it lately,

2:01:29.180 --> 2:01:31.940
 but I confess I've been doing far shorter meditations

2:01:31.940 --> 2:01:34.660
 of anywhere from three to five or maybe 10 minutes.

2:01:34.660 --> 2:01:37.540
 I'm going to ramp that up to 15 minutes a day.

2:01:37.540 --> 2:01:39.540
 And I'm doing that specifically to try

2:01:39.540 --> 2:01:42.260
 and access these improvements in cognitive ability

2:01:42.260 --> 2:01:43.700
 and our abilities to learn.

2:01:43.700 --> 2:01:45.740
 Also based on the data in this paper,

2:01:45.740 --> 2:01:47.500
 I'm going to do those meditation sessions

2:01:47.500 --> 2:01:48.980
 either early in the day,

2:01:48.980 --> 2:01:52.900
 such as immediately after waking or close to it.

2:01:52.900 --> 2:01:54.820
 So I might get my sunshine first.

2:01:54.820 --> 2:01:55.660
 As you all know,

2:01:55.660 --> 2:01:57.620
 very big on getting sunlight in the eyes early in the day,

2:01:57.620 --> 2:02:00.200
 as much as one can and as early as one can

2:02:01.300 --> 2:02:02.700
 once the sun is out,

2:02:02.700 --> 2:02:04.900
 but certainly doing it early in the day

2:02:04.900 --> 2:02:08.700
 and not past 5 PM or so in order to make sure

2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:09.900
 that I don't inhibit sleep.

2:02:09.900 --> 2:02:11.940
 Because I think this result that they describe

2:02:11.940 --> 2:02:14.860
 of meditation inhibiting quality sleep

2:02:14.860 --> 2:02:17.880
 compared to controls is an important one

2:02:17.880 --> 2:02:20.180
 to pay attention to, no pun intended.

2:02:20.180 --> 2:02:22.540
 Today, we covered a lot of aspects of memory

2:02:22.540 --> 2:02:24.480
 and how to improve your memory.

2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:26.260
 We talked about the different forms of memory

2:02:26.260 --> 2:02:28.820
 and we talked about some of the underlying neural circuitry

2:02:28.820 --> 2:02:30.340
 of memory formation.

2:02:30.340 --> 2:02:34.020
 And we talked about how the emotional saliency

2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:36.420
 and intensity of what you're trying to learn

2:02:36.420 --> 2:02:40.100
 has a profound impact on whether or not you learn

2:02:40.100 --> 2:02:41.980
 in response to some sort of experience,

2:02:41.980 --> 2:02:44.540
 whether or not that experience is reading

2:02:44.540 --> 2:02:49.020
 or mathematics or music or language or a physical skill,

2:02:49.020 --> 2:02:50.240
 doesn't matter.

2:02:50.240 --> 2:02:54.060
 The more intense of an emotional state that you're in

2:02:54.060 --> 2:02:57.020
 in the period immediately following that learning,

2:02:57.020 --> 2:02:59.420
 the more likely you are to remember

2:02:59.420 --> 2:03:01.420
 whatever it is that you're trying to learn.

2:03:01.420 --> 2:03:02.800
 And we talked about the neurochemicals

2:03:02.800 --> 2:03:04.560
 that explain that effect,

2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:08.320
 about epinephrine and corticosterones like cortisol

2:03:08.320 --> 2:03:10.580
 and how adjusting the timing of those

2:03:10.580 --> 2:03:13.260
 is so key to enhancing your memory.

2:03:13.260 --> 2:03:14.580
 And we talked about the different ways

2:03:14.580 --> 2:03:15.660
 to enhance those chemicals,

2:03:15.660 --> 2:03:19.340
 everything ranging from cold water to pharmacology

2:03:19.340 --> 2:03:22.420
 and even just adjusting the emotional state within your mind

2:03:22.420 --> 2:03:26.080
 in order to stamp down and remember experiences better.

2:03:26.080 --> 2:03:28.140
 We also talked about how to leverage exercise

2:03:28.140 --> 2:03:31.700
 in particular load-bearing exercise

2:03:31.700 --> 2:03:34.780
 in order to evoke the release of hormones like osteocalcin,

2:03:34.780 --> 2:03:36.500
 which can travel from your bones to your brain

2:03:36.500 --> 2:03:38.520
 and enhance your ability to learn.

2:03:38.520 --> 2:03:41.000
 And we talked about a new form of photographic memory,

2:03:41.000 --> 2:03:43.780
 not the traditional type of photographic memory

2:03:43.780 --> 2:03:45.300
 in which people can remember everything

2:03:45.300 --> 2:03:47.140
 they look at very easily,

2:03:47.140 --> 2:03:50.460
 but rather taking mental snapshots of things that you see.

2:03:50.460 --> 2:03:53.320
 Again, emphasizing that that will create a better memory

2:03:53.320 --> 2:03:55.560
 of what you see when you take that mental snapshot,

2:03:55.560 --> 2:03:57.600
 but will actually reduce your memory

2:03:57.600 --> 2:03:59.660
 for the things that you hear at that moment.

2:03:59.660 --> 2:04:01.260
 And we discussed the really exciting data

2:04:01.260 --> 2:04:03.960
 looking at how particular meditation protocols

2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:07.660
 can enhance memory, but also attention and mood.

2:04:07.660 --> 2:04:10.740
 However, if done too late in the day,

2:04:10.740 --> 2:04:12.780
 can actually disrupt sleep precisely

2:04:12.780 --> 2:04:17.340
 because those meditation protocols can enhance attention.

2:04:17.340 --> 2:04:18.820
 Now, I know that many of you are interested

2:04:18.820 --> 2:04:22.380
 in neurochemicals that can enhance learning and memory,

2:04:22.380 --> 2:04:26.600
 and I intend to cover those in deep detail

2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:28.000
 in a future episode.

2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:30.240
 However, for sake of what was discussed today,

2:04:30.240 --> 2:04:33.300
 please understand that any number

2:04:33.300 --> 2:04:35.060
 of different neurochemicals can evoke

2:04:35.060 --> 2:04:37.300
 or can increase the amount of adrenaline

2:04:37.300 --> 2:04:39.580
 that's circulating in your brain and body.

2:04:39.580 --> 2:04:43.140
 And it's less important how one accesses

2:04:43.140 --> 2:04:44.980
 that increase in adrenaline, right?

2:04:44.980 --> 2:04:46.900
 Again, this can be done through behavioral protocols

2:04:46.900 --> 2:04:48.240
 or through pharmacology.

2:04:49.440 --> 2:04:51.860
 Assuming that those behavioral protocols

2:04:51.860 --> 2:04:53.860
 and pharmacology are safe for you,

2:04:53.860 --> 2:04:55.780
 it really doesn't matter how you evoke

2:04:55.780 --> 2:04:57.720
 the adrenaline release, because remember,

2:04:57.720 --> 2:05:00.160
 adrenaline is the final common pathway

2:05:00.160 --> 2:05:02.280
 by which particular experiences,

2:05:02.280 --> 2:05:05.620
 particular perceptions are stamped into memory,

2:05:05.620 --> 2:05:08.220
 which answers our very first question raised

2:05:08.220 --> 2:05:09.300
 at the beginning of the episode,

2:05:09.300 --> 2:05:12.380
 which is why do we remember anything at all, right?

2:05:12.380 --> 2:05:14.260
 That was the question that we raised.

2:05:14.260 --> 2:05:16.060
 Why is it that from morning till night

2:05:16.060 --> 2:05:17.380
 and throughout your entire life,

2:05:17.380 --> 2:05:18.780
 you have tons of sensory experience,

2:05:18.780 --> 2:05:21.780
 tons of perceptions, why is it that some are remembered

2:05:21.780 --> 2:05:23.140
 and others are not?

2:05:23.140 --> 2:05:26.740
 While I would never want to distill an important question

2:05:26.740 --> 2:05:29.820
 such as that down to a one molecule type of answer,

2:05:29.820 --> 2:05:31.760
 I think we can confidently say,

2:05:31.760 --> 2:05:36.140
 based on the vast amount of animal and human research data,

2:05:36.140 --> 2:05:38.580
 that epinephrine, adrenaline,

2:05:38.580 --> 2:05:40.880
 and some of the other chemicals that it acts with

2:05:40.880 --> 2:05:44.380
 in concert is in fact the way

2:05:44.380 --> 2:05:49.020
 that we remember particular events and not all events.

2:05:49.020 --> 2:05:51.460

 That's terrific, perhaps the best way

2:06:20.880 --> 2:06:22.300
 to support this podcast.

2:06:22.300 --> 2:06:23.520
 We also have a Patreon.

2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:26.260
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

2:06:26.260 --> 2:06:28.060
 and there you can support this podcast

2:06:28.060 --> 2:06:29.580
 at any level that you like.

2:06:29.580 --> 2:06:31.940
 During today's episode and on many previous episodes

2:06:31.940 --> 2:06:34.900
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.

2:06:34.900 --> 2:06:37.200
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:39.340
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:06:39.340 --> 2:06:41.400
 for things like enhancing sleep and focus,

2:06:41.400 --> 2:06:43.480
 and indeed for learning and memory.

2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:45.340
 For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:06:45.340 --> 2:06:47.760
 is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

2:06:47.760 --> 2:06:50.420
 The reason we partnered with Momentous is several fold.

2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:52.600
 First of all, we wanted to have one location

2:06:52.600 --> 2:06:55.580
 where people could go to access single ingredient,

2:06:55.580 --> 2:06:57.420
 high quality versions of the supplements

2:06:57.420 --> 2:06:59.760
 that we were discussing on this podcast.

2:06:59.760 --> 2:07:00.980
 This is a critical issue.

2:07:00.980 --> 2:07:02.580
 A lot of supplement companies out there

2:07:02.580 --> 2:07:03.780
 sell excellent supplements,

2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:05.740
 but they combine different ingredients

2:07:05.740 --> 2:07:07.080
 into different formulations,

2:07:07.080 --> 2:07:08.660
 which make it very hard to figure out

2:07:08.660 --> 2:07:10.140
 exactly what works for you

2:07:10.140 --> 2:07:12.800
 and to arrive at the minimal effective dose

2:07:12.800 --> 2:07:14.940
 of the various compounds that are best for you,

2:07:14.940 --> 2:07:16.780
 which we think is extremely important.

2:07:16.780 --> 2:07:18.760
 And that's certainly the most scientific way

2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:20.300
 or rigorous way to approach

2:07:20.300 --> 2:07:22.240
 any kind of supplementation regimen.

2:07:22.240 --> 2:07:24.880
 So Momentous has made these single ingredient formulations

2:07:24.880 --> 2:07:27.260
 on the basis of what we suggested to them.

2:07:27.260 --> 2:07:30.020
 And I'm happy to say they also ship internationally.

2:07:30.020 --> 2:07:32.060
 So whether or not you're in the US or abroad,

2:07:32.060 --> 2:07:32.940
 they'll ship to you.

2:07:32.940 --> 2:07:34.700
 If you'd like to see the supplements recommended

2:07:34.700 --> 2:07:36.460
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:07:36.460 --> 2:07:40.040
 you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

2:07:40.040 --> 2:07:42.000
 They've started to assemble the supplements

2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:43.500
 that we've talked about on the podcast

2:07:43.500 --> 2:07:45.180
 and in the upcoming weeks,

2:07:45.180 --> 2:07:47.180
 they will be adding many more supplements

2:07:47.180 --> 2:07:50.560
 such that in a brief period of time,

2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:52.300
 most, if not all of the compounds

2:07:52.300 --> 2:07:54.020
 that are discussed on this podcast

2:07:54.020 --> 2:07:56.620
 will be there again in single ingredient,

2:07:56.620 --> 2:07:58.500
 extremely high quality formulations

2:07:58.500 --> 2:07:59.660
 that you can use to arrive

2:07:59.660 --> 2:08:01.980
 at the best supplement protocols for you.

2:08:01.980 --> 2:08:04.100
 We also include behavioral protocols

2:08:04.100 --> 2:08:06.540
 that can be combined with supplementation protocols

2:08:06.540 --> 2:08:08.800
 in order to deliver the maximum effect.

2:08:08.800 --> 2:08:12.140
 Once again, that's livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

2:08:12.140 --> 2:08:13.620
 And if you're not already following us

2:08:13.620 --> 2:08:15.220
 on Twitter and Instagram,

2:08:15.220 --> 2:08:18.140
 it's Huberman Lab on both Twitter and Instagram.

2:08:18.140 --> 2:08:21.220
 There I describe science and science related tools,

2:08:21.220 --> 2:08:22.820
 some of which overlap with the content

2:08:22.820 --> 2:08:24.060
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:08:24.060 --> 2:08:25.420
 but much of which is distinct

2:08:25.420 --> 2:08:27.780
 from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:08:27.780 --> 2:08:29.180
 We also have a newsletter

2:08:29.180 --> 2:08:30.720
 called the Huberman Lab Neural Network.

2:08:30.720 --> 2:08:33.880
 That newsletter provides summary protocols

2:08:33.880 --> 2:08:36.880
 and information from our various podcast episodes.

2:08:36.880 --> 2:08:38.460
 It does not cost anything to sign up.

2:08:38.460 --> 2:08:40.400
 You can go to HubermanLab.com,

2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:42.700
 go to the menu and click on newsletter.

2:08:42.700 --> 2:08:43.780
 You just provide your email.

2:08:43.780 --> 2:08:44.620
 And I should point out,

2:08:44.620 --> 2:08:46.420
 we do not share your email with anyone else.

2:08:46.420 --> 2:08:48.780
 We have a very clear privacy policy

2:08:48.780 --> 2:08:50.300
 that you can read there.

2:08:50.300 --> 2:08:52.260
 And that newsletter comes out about once a month.

2:08:52.260 --> 2:08:53.960
 You can also see some sample newsletters,

2:08:53.960 --> 2:08:57.300
 things like the toolkit for sleep or for neuroplasticity

2:08:57.300 --> 2:08:59.060
 and for various other topics covered

2:08:59.060 --> 2:09:00.560
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:09:00.560 --> 2:09:02.540
 Once again, thank you for joining me today

2:09:02.540 --> 2:09:04.780
 to discuss the neurobiology of learning and memory

2:09:04.780 --> 2:09:08.580
 and how to improve your memory using science-based tools.

2:09:08.580 --> 2:09:10.620
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:09:10.620 --> 2:09:12.380
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:09:12.380 --> 2:09:34.380
 And I'll see you in the next one.
