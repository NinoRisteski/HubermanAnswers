00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.620 --> 00:10.800
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.800 --> 00:13.860
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.860 --> 00:15.960
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.960 --> 00:17.840
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.840 --> 00:19.720
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.840
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.840 --> 00:24.120
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:24.120 --> 00:27.000
 about science and science-related tools.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.200
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.200 --> 00:31.300
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.300 --> 00:34.000
 Our first sponsor is InsideTracker.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.600
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

00:36.600 --> 00:39.400
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:39.400 --> 00:41.080
 to help you better understand your body

00:41.080 --> 00:43.240
 and help you reach your health goals.

00:43.240 --> 00:45.880
 I'm a big believer in blood tests and DNA tests

00:45.880 --> 00:48.660
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

00:48.660 --> 00:51.420
 that are important for your short-term and long-term health

00:51.420 --> 00:54.100
 and overall wellbeing can only be analyzed

00:54.100 --> 00:55.880
 from blood and DNA tests,

00:55.880 --> 00:58.680
 things like metabolic factors and hormone levels

00:58.680 --> 01:02.920
 really can only be assessed accurately from blood and DNA.

01:02.920 --> 01:04.440
 The thing I like about InsideTracker

01:04.440 --> 01:07.320
 is you don't just get back levels of different hormones

01:07.320 --> 01:09.700
 and metabolic factors and so forth,

01:09.700 --> 01:10.920
 you also get directives.

01:10.920 --> 01:13.240
 It has a dashboard that's very easy to use

01:13.240 --> 01:15.440
 that tells you based on your data

01:15.440 --> 01:17.720
 what sorts of foods you might want to eat more of

01:17.720 --> 01:18.600
 or less of,

01:18.600 --> 01:21.560
 what forms of exercise you might want to do more of

01:21.560 --> 01:22.640
 or less of.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.680
 It's really a wonderful way to assess

01:24.680 --> 01:27.000
 how your behaviors and lifestyle choices

01:27.000 --> 01:29.060
 are interacting with what's going on

01:29.060 --> 01:31.140
 deep within your biology.

01:31.140 --> 01:34.680
 InsideTracker makes all of that super easy to understand.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.920
 It's also really easy to get the blood tests

01:36.920 --> 01:38.160
 and DNA tests taken.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.920
 You can go to a local location

01:39.920 --> 01:43.220
 or they can send somebody to your home if you prefer that.

01:43.220 --> 01:44.760
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.880
 Today's episode is also brought to you by Helix Sleep.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.140
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

02:07.140 --> 02:09.660
 that are designed to meet your sleep needs

02:09.660 --> 02:11.800
 in order to optimize your sleep.

02:11.800 --> 02:13.840
 I've done several episodes of this podcast

02:13.840 --> 02:15.860
 and there's a ton of information out there

02:15.860 --> 02:17.880
 pointing to the fact that getting really deep

02:17.880 --> 02:19.920
 restful sleep each night is vital

02:19.920 --> 02:21.640
 for mental and physical health.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.780
 And the mattress that you sleep on and the pillow

02:23.780 --> 02:27.280
 that you use is very important for getting optimal sleep.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.680
 Helix Sleep has a brief two minute quiz that you can take.

02:30.680 --> 02:32.800
 It asks you questions like, do you sleep on your side

02:32.800 --> 02:34.920
 or your back or your stomach, or maybe you don't know,

02:34.920 --> 02:37.240
 do you tend to run hot or cold as you sleep

02:37.240 --> 02:38.960
 or maybe you don't know.

02:38.960 --> 02:42.980
 That two minute quiz matches you to a mattress and pillow

02:42.980 --> 02:45.260
 that's ideal for your sleep needs.

02:45.260 --> 02:47.600
 I took this quiz, I matched to the mattress

02:47.600 --> 02:49.400
 they call the Dusk D-U-S-K

02:49.400 --> 02:51.740
 and I've been sleeping on the Dusk mattress for many months

02:51.740 --> 02:54.480
 now and I've been sleeping better than I ever have before.

02:54.480 --> 02:57.120
 It's really wonderful to have a really good night's sleep

02:57.120 --> 02:59.900
 on a consistent basis, it's a total game changer.

02:59.900 --> 03:01.760
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

03:01.760 --> 03:04.960
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

03:04.960 --> 03:06.520
 take their two minute sleep quiz

03:06.520 --> 03:08.880
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress

03:08.880 --> 03:12.000
 and you'll get up to $200 off any of their mattress orders

03:12.000 --> 03:13.560
 and two free pillows.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.720
 So that's helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

03:16.720 --> 03:18.220
 take the two minute sleep quiz,

03:18.220 --> 03:19.760
 they'll match you to a mattress

03:19.760 --> 03:21.060
 and if you order one of their mattresses,

03:21.060 --> 03:23.880
 you'll get up to $200 off any of their mattresses

03:23.880 --> 03:25.560
 and two free pillows.

03:25.560 --> 03:26.800
 They have a 10 year warranty

03:26.800 --> 03:28.440
 and you get to try out the mattress

03:28.440 --> 03:30.240
 for a hundred nights risk-free

03:30.240 --> 03:31.560
 and if you don't like it, they'll pick it up

03:31.560 --> 03:32.680
 and take it away.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.560
 If you love it, then you keep it

03:34.560 --> 03:36.140
 and I think there's a very good chance

03:36.140 --> 03:38.320
 that you're going to love it, I certainly love mine.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.320
 And today's episode is also brought to you

03:40.320 --> 03:41.920
 by Athletic Greens.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.800
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

03:43.800 --> 03:46.420
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

03:46.420 --> 03:49.960
 I started using Athletic Greens way back in 2012

03:49.960 --> 03:52.680
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.160
 I started using Athletic Greens

03:54.160 --> 03:56.620
 because I found it rather confusing

03:56.620 --> 03:59.560
 to figure out what vitamins and minerals to take.

03:59.560 --> 04:02.200
 And Athletic Greens, I get all the vitamins and minerals

04:02.200 --> 04:04.060
 I need to cover my bases.

04:04.060 --> 04:06.600
 As well, probiotics are really important.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.680
 Probiotics have been shown now in numerous studies

04:08.680 --> 04:11.000
 to be important for the gut microbiome,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
 which impacts the gut brain axis

04:13.000 --> 04:16.040
 as well as various aspects of bodily health.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.220
 So in Athletic Greens, I get vitamins,

04:18.220 --> 04:19.960
 minerals and probiotics.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.820
 I also really liked the way it tastes.

04:21.820 --> 04:24.400
 It's a greens drink, so you mix it with some water.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.360
 You could mix it with something else like juice if you like.

04:26.360 --> 04:28.340
 I mix mine with water and lemon juice

04:28.340 --> 04:30.380
 and I drink it once or twice a day.

04:30.380 --> 04:31.840
 If you want to try Athletic Greens,

04:31.840 --> 04:35.040
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.080
 And if you do that, you'll claim their special offer,

04:38.080 --> 04:41.700
 which is to get a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.240
 There's now also a wealth of data

04:43.240 --> 04:45.300
 showing that vitamin D3 is important

04:45.300 --> 04:48.440
 for various aspects of brain and body health.

04:48.440 --> 04:51.760
 So that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:51.760 --> 04:55.480
 for Athletic Greens and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

04:55.480 --> 04:58.160
 You'll also get five free travel packets.

04:58.160 --> 05:00.760
 The travel packets are just a really convenient way

05:00.760 --> 05:03.480
 to take Athletic Greens when you're on the road,

05:03.480 --> 05:06.320
 in the car or on a plane, or just moving around.

05:06.320 --> 05:09.160
 You just empty one of the packets into a water bottle

05:09.160 --> 05:11.020
 or a glass and mix it up really quickly.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.860
 It saves any kind of mess or anything of that sort.

05:13.860 --> 05:17.100
 So once again, athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:17.100 --> 05:19.600
 to get vitamin D3K2, that's a year supply

05:19.600 --> 05:21.760
 and the five free travel packs.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.440
 It's a new month, which means it's a new topic

05:24.440 --> 05:26.980
 here at the Huberman Lab Podcast.

05:26.980 --> 05:29.120
 For the next four or so episodes,

05:29.120 --> 05:32.280
 we're going to be talking all about hormone effects

05:32.280 --> 05:34.380
 on the brain and body.

05:34.380 --> 05:37.040
 So that's a huge number of different topics.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.040
 We're going to talk about sex.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.280
 We're going to talk about reproduction.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.900
 We're going to talk about puberty a little bit more.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.000
 We talked about that in the previous episode.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.680
 We're going to talk about menopause.

05:47.680 --> 05:49.280
 We're going to talk about birth control.

05:49.280 --> 05:53.560
 We are going to talk about aggression, competition,

05:53.560 --> 05:55.520
 winning, losing.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.920
 Basically, we're going to cover as much about hormones

05:57.920 --> 06:00.980
 as we possibly can in this month.

06:00.980 --> 06:03.800
 And in doing so, we are going to go deep

06:03.800 --> 06:06.140
 into tools and protocols.

06:06.140 --> 06:08.800
 We are also going to talk about a lot of tools

06:08.800 --> 06:11.360
 that relate to things that you might not want to do

06:11.360 --> 06:14.840
 in order to optimize hormone health,

06:14.840 --> 06:17.720
 regardless of stage of life or your goals, et cetera.

06:17.720 --> 06:21.120
 So it's sure to be a month rich with discussion,

06:21.120 --> 06:23.000
 rich with tools, and you're going to learn

06:23.000 --> 06:26.300
 a lot of neuroscience and endocrinology.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.680
 There's actually a field of neuroendocrinology.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.520
 It's actually where I started my graduate work.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.960
 I did a master's in it,

06:31.960 --> 06:34.920
 which is only to say that I love the topic.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.560
 I have a lot of friends that work on this topic,

06:36.560 --> 06:38.640
 many of whom I've consulted for these episodes,

06:38.640 --> 06:41.400
 and I'm really excited to share the information with you.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.680
 Before we dive into today's episode,

06:43.680 --> 06:45.640
 all about emotions and sex,

06:45.640 --> 06:48.240
 I want to just have a few announcements

06:48.240 --> 06:51.720
 that are designed to point you to some useful resources.

06:51.720 --> 06:54.440
 Last episode, talking about the science of emotions

06:54.440 --> 06:57.800
 and relationships, I mentioned the Mood Meter app.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.720
 The Mood Meter app was developed by people out

07:00.720 --> 07:03.120
 at Yale University who study the biology

07:03.120 --> 07:04.420
 and psychology of emotions.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.100
 It's a really wonderful app.

07:06.100 --> 07:09.360
 However, many of you quickly told me

07:09.360 --> 07:12.920
 that the Mood Meter app isn't available in your area.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.080
 You went to the link we posted

07:14.080 --> 07:16.100
 and it just was saying not available in your area.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.920
 The situation was actually a lot worse than that.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.800
 The situation was that when we recorded the episode,

07:20.800 --> 07:22.080
 the Mood Meter app was working.

07:22.080 --> 07:25.280
 I know because I downloaded a fresh copy of it to my phone.

07:25.280 --> 07:27.320
 And then in the ensuing weekend,

07:27.320 --> 07:30.240
 they took the Mood Meter app down for some repairs.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.440
 The Mood Meter app is now up.

07:32.440 --> 07:33.600
 It is available.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.440
 I want to be really clear.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.760
 It's not an app I'm affiliated with.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.960
 I'm just mentioning it to you.

07:38.960 --> 07:39.800
 They don't know me.

07:39.800 --> 07:41.500
 I know them, but they don't know me.

07:41.500 --> 07:43.860
 So we don't have any kind of business relationship.

07:43.860 --> 07:46.720
 They do charge 99 cents for the app.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.560
 I think the free version has disappeared

07:48.560 --> 07:50.180
 in the last year or so.

07:50.180 --> 07:51.360
 So that's Mood Meter app.

07:51.360 --> 07:53.040
 We'll provide the link again

07:53.040 --> 07:54.640
 and the link should be working.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.420
 Hopefully they won't take it down again

07:56.420 --> 07:57.760
 in between this announcement

07:57.760 --> 07:59.600
 and the release of this episode.

07:59.600 --> 08:02.080
 Also just want to take a step back for a moment

08:02.080 --> 08:04.480
 and talk a little bit about the logic

08:04.480 --> 08:07.260
 of how to make the most of the information

08:07.260 --> 08:09.380
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

08:09.380 --> 08:11.400
 I tend to throw out a lot of information

08:11.400 --> 08:12.660
 about a given topic.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.420
 Many of you have pointed out, however,

08:14.420 --> 08:16.680
 that I don't cover certain things.

08:16.680 --> 08:19.080
 And once again, I'll just say,

08:19.080 --> 08:21.440
 the goal is always to be accurate,

08:21.440 --> 08:24.120
 but there's no way I can be exhaustive.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.480
 There's no way I can cover everything

08:25.480 --> 08:26.700
 for a particular topic.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.600
 The good news is we have time.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.440
 My goal, at least in the first year

08:30.440 --> 08:32.160
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

08:32.160 --> 08:33.480
 is to give you a basis,

08:33.480 --> 08:35.260
 a foundation in these different topics

08:35.260 --> 08:40.260
 of neuroplasticity, focus, sleep, hormones, et cetera.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.520
 And of course, to provide tools along the way.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.840
 We are going to host guests.

08:44.840 --> 08:45.920
 I've actually started recording

08:45.920 --> 08:47.640
 with some of these guests already.

08:47.640 --> 08:49.600
 And even those episodes will include a little,

08:49.600 --> 08:50.920
 what we call primer,

08:50.920 --> 08:54.220
 a little description of the basics of a given topic

08:54.220 --> 08:56.820
 so that you can get more information from those topics.

08:56.820 --> 09:00.000
 My goal really is to educate you in these topics,

09:00.000 --> 09:01.800
 give you a foundation in these topics

09:01.800 --> 09:04.720
 and allow you to start exploring them here in the episodes

09:04.720 --> 09:06.260
 with our future guests,

09:06.260 --> 09:08.360
 but also in other podcasts and books

09:08.360 --> 09:10.200
 and other sources of information.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.520
 So for those of you that are saying

09:11.520 --> 09:13.080
 it's too much information,

09:14.160 --> 09:16.640
 I just encourage you to remind yourself

09:16.640 --> 09:17.840
 that you have a pause button,

09:17.840 --> 09:19.920
 you can return to it, everything's timestamp.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.940
 For those of you who feel it's not enough information,

09:21.940 --> 09:23.200
 I'm not covering enough,

09:23.200 --> 09:25.440
 just know that this is just the beginning.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.440
 We intend to do this for a very long time

09:27.440 --> 09:30.120
 and we will be thorough over time.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.700
 So thanks for your patience.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.240
 And please be patient with yourselves.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.480
 There's no reason why you have to digest

09:35.480 --> 09:38.160
 all the information in one swoop.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.640
 The other thing is that I've been told

09:39.640 --> 09:42.320
 both that I speak too fast and speak too slow.

09:42.320 --> 09:44.440
 So there's a wonderful solution to this.

09:44.440 --> 09:46.940
 If I speak too fast or too slow,

09:46.940 --> 09:49.160
 you can adjust the speed in YouTube.

09:49.160 --> 09:50.460
 If you're listening in a different format,

09:50.460 --> 09:52.920
 I think you also can adjust the speed of playback.

09:52.920 --> 09:55.040
 So that's something that wouldn't be possible

09:55.040 --> 09:57.960
 in the classroom, but you may find useful.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.980
 And then last but not least,

09:59.980 --> 10:03.000
 I want to point people again to this NSDR,

10:03.000 --> 10:04.720
 non-sleep deep rest protocol

10:04.720 --> 10:06.160
 that the folks over at Made For

10:06.160 --> 10:08.160
 have put out as a free resource.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.200
 It does, as many of you pointed out,

10:10.200 --> 10:12.320
 bear resemblance to things like yoga nidra,

10:12.320 --> 10:13.520
 other forms of meditation.

10:13.520 --> 10:16.400
 But what we've done is we've stripped out intentions

10:16.400 --> 10:19.560
 or any kind of the verbiage related

10:19.560 --> 10:23.020
 to what some people might perceive

10:23.020 --> 10:25.440
 as kind of related to the yoga community

10:25.440 --> 10:29.840
 or specific to kind of new agey type techniques,

10:29.840 --> 10:31.320
 not because we don't like yoga nidra.

10:31.320 --> 10:33.040
 In fact, I've done yoga nidra daily

10:33.040 --> 10:36.660
 for almost the last, goodness, eight years of my life.

10:36.660 --> 10:37.960
 I love yoga nidra,

10:37.960 --> 10:42.720
 but sometimes the complicated language can be a separator

10:42.720 --> 10:45.300
 and can discourage people from taking on these protocols

10:45.300 --> 10:46.440
 that are extremely useful.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.640
 So NSDR is intentionally generic.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.720
 It's designed to bring you into a state of deep relaxation

10:53.720 --> 10:56.140
 through a combination of breathing and body scan.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.800
 There's the YouTube script over at Made For,

10:58.800 --> 11:00.800
 which is linked in the caption.

11:00.800 --> 11:03.340
 And many people find that they prefer that

11:03.340 --> 11:05.480
 to scripts like yoga nidra scripts

11:05.480 --> 11:06.880
 where they're doing intentions

11:06.880 --> 11:10.320
 and they're hearing a lot of kind of unusual language

11:10.320 --> 11:11.200
 around the process.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.660
 This is just very basic and I hope you'll enjoy it.

11:14.660 --> 11:17.060
 And if you prefer the more typical yoga nidra scripts,

11:17.060 --> 11:18.080
 then go with those.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.220
 There are many of them available

11:19.220 --> 11:21.320
 on the internet and elsewhere.

11:21.320 --> 11:22.480
 And last but not least,

11:22.480 --> 11:25.160
 I want to point out that all our episodes now

11:25.160 --> 11:27.800
 are subtitled both in English and in Spanish.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.040
 So for those of you that prefer

11:29.040 --> 11:31.620
 to digest this information in Spanish,

11:31.620 --> 11:34.320
 that's now available to you in the subtitles.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.420
 Today, we're going to talk about the science of sex,

11:37.420 --> 11:40.520
 in particular sexual differentiation.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.600
 Now that's a complicated topic

11:42.600 --> 11:47.600
 because sex is both a adjective, a noun, and a verb,

11:47.800 --> 11:49.960
 depending on the context.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.500
 Today, we're going to talk about the hormonal effects

11:53.500 --> 11:57.060
 and the neural effects of particular events

11:57.060 --> 11:58.320
 that happen during development

11:58.320 --> 12:02.720
 and how those guide adolescent and adult behavior,

12:02.720 --> 12:04.700
 including sexual preference.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.560
 It's an area that's fascinating

12:06.560 --> 12:08.520
 and for which there are actually

12:08.520 --> 12:10.880
 very solid textbook findings.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.260
 So textbook findings means that there are many studies

12:14.260 --> 12:16.480
 that have been aggregated over decades

12:16.480 --> 12:20.580
 that point to what we now know to be absolute truths

12:20.580 --> 12:23.720
 in terms of how hormones affect brain development,

12:23.720 --> 12:26.040
 how the brain impacts hormonal development,

12:26.040 --> 12:29.780
 and how those interact to control behavior, for instance.

12:30.820 --> 12:34.480
 We are also going to talk about reproduction, the verb sex.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.900
 And of course, sex, the verb,

12:36.900 --> 12:39.600
 can also be carried out independent of reproduction.

12:39.600 --> 12:42.400
 It's not always in particular in humans

12:42.400 --> 12:44.200
 just to produce offspring.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.040
 So that's going to be covered in the next episode,

12:46.040 --> 12:49.000
 but you absolutely need to understand the information

12:49.000 --> 12:51.960
 in this episode in order to make sense of the information

12:51.960 --> 12:53.440
 in the next episode.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.640
 So today we're going to explore hormones,

12:56.640 --> 12:58.040
 what they are, how they work,

12:58.040 --> 13:01.440
 what leads to masculinization or feminization

13:01.440 --> 13:03.160
 of the brain and body.

13:03.160 --> 13:05.120
 I'll just throw out one really interesting fact

13:05.120 --> 13:07.160
 that perhaps most of you didn't realize

13:07.160 --> 13:10.940
 that hormones have direct effects on the body.

13:10.940 --> 13:14.440
 Most people know that because there are hormone differences

13:14.440 --> 13:16.440
 and sex differences in bodies

13:16.440 --> 13:18.920
 in terms of genitalia and body hair,

13:18.920 --> 13:21.280
 distribution of body hair, et cetera.

13:21.280 --> 13:25.140
 But there are also effects of hormones on the brain directly

13:25.140 --> 13:25.980
 and believe it or not,

13:25.980 --> 13:28.720
 there are also effects on the spinal cord,

13:28.720 --> 13:31.560
 on the neurons and structures within the spinal cord

13:31.560 --> 13:33.920
 that impact in a very direct way

13:33.920 --> 13:36.620
 what sorts of behaviors are possible.

13:36.620 --> 13:39.140
 So it's a fascinating area.

13:39.140 --> 13:41.880
 You might notice I'm going to go a little bit more slowly

13:41.880 --> 13:43.720
 through this topic than I normally do.

13:43.720 --> 13:46.700
 I want to be extremely careful with my language.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.500
 Some of these topics,

13:48.500 --> 13:51.940
 some of you may be thinking are extremely sensitive, right?

13:51.940 --> 13:52.880
 And of course,

13:52.880 --> 13:54.960
 any discussion about sex and reproduction

13:54.960 --> 13:56.200
 is a sensitive one,

13:56.200 --> 13:58.320
 but today we're just talking about the biology.

13:58.320 --> 14:00.240
 We're not getting into the cultural constraints

14:00.240 --> 14:02.060
 or the cultural dialogue.

14:02.060 --> 14:06.220
 What we're trying to do today is really get to the biology,

14:06.220 --> 14:10.000
 the physiology, the endocrinology and the behavior.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.200
 So let's start by talking about what hormones are

14:14.200 --> 14:17.040
 just to remind you and what they do.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.000
 Hormones by definition are a substance,

14:20.000 --> 14:22.800
 a chemical that's released in one area of the body,

14:22.800 --> 14:25.000
 typically from something we call a gland,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.440
 although they can also be released from neurons,

14:28.440 --> 14:30.840
 but they're released often from glands

14:30.840 --> 14:35.160
 that travel and have effects both on that gland,

14:35.160 --> 14:38.480
 but also on other organs and tissues in the body.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.140
 And that differentiates hormones

14:40.140 --> 14:41.880
 from things like neurotransmitters,

14:41.880 --> 14:44.160
 which tend to act more locally.

14:44.160 --> 14:45.360
 So that's important.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.400
 A hormone is a substance secreted at one location,

14:47.400 --> 14:49.160
 the body travels and has impact

14:49.160 --> 14:51.640
 on things elsewhere in the body.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.720
 Examples of tissues that produce hormones

14:54.720 --> 14:59.160
 would be the thyroid, the testes, the ovaries, et cetera.

14:59.160 --> 15:00.780
 And then of course there are areas of the brain

15:00.780 --> 15:03.880
 like the hypothalamus and the pituitary,

15:03.880 --> 15:06.600
 which are closely related to one another

15:06.600 --> 15:08.680
 and release hormones that cause the release

15:08.680 --> 15:10.320
 of yet other hormones out in the body.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.320
 So we're going to cover all this.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.360
 If you don't know anything about endocrinology,

15:13.360 --> 15:15.280
 you're still going to be able to understand

15:15.280 --> 15:16.660
 today's discussion.

15:16.660 --> 15:19.280
 And we're going to start with a discussion

15:19.280 --> 15:23.260
 about what hormones actually do to create this thing

15:23.260 --> 15:26.240
 that we call masculinization or feminization.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.200
 So let's start with development.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.480
 Sperm meets egg.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.700
 Everything that happens before that

15:31.700 --> 15:34.080
 is a topic of the next episode.

15:34.080 --> 15:37.400
 But sperm meets egg, this is mammalian reproduction.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.040
 And that egg starts to duplicate.

15:39.040 --> 15:40.740
 It starts to make more of itself.

15:40.740 --> 15:41.840
 It makes more cells.

15:41.840 --> 15:43.660
 And eventually some of those cells become skin.

15:43.660 --> 15:45.200
 Some of those cells become brain.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.620
 Some of those cells become muscle.

15:46.620 --> 15:48.560
 Some of those cells become fingers.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.680
 All the stuff that makes up the brain and body plan.

15:53.400 --> 15:57.000
 In addition, there are hormones that come both

15:57.000 --> 16:01.080
 from the mother and from the developing baby,

16:01.080 --> 16:03.480
 the developing fetus that impact

16:03.480 --> 16:05.120
 whether or not the brain will be

16:05.120 --> 16:08.780
 what they call organized masculine or organized feminine.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.480
 And as I say this,

16:10.480 --> 16:12.160
 I want you to try and discard

16:12.160 --> 16:13.920
 with the cultural connotations

16:13.920 --> 16:15.720
 or your psychological connotations

16:15.720 --> 16:18.760
 of what masculinization and feminization are

16:18.760 --> 16:22.120
 because we're only centering on the biology.

16:22.120 --> 16:27.120
 So typically people have either two X chromosomes

16:28.480 --> 16:30.200
 and the traditional language around that

16:30.200 --> 16:33.000
 is that person is female, right?

16:33.000 --> 16:35.620
 Or an X chromosome and a Y chromosome

16:35.620 --> 16:37.880
 and that person will become male.

16:37.880 --> 16:39.600
 Now it's not always the case.

16:39.600 --> 16:42.320
 There are cases where it's XXY

16:42.320 --> 16:45.040
 where there are two X chromosomes plus a Y chromosome.

16:45.040 --> 16:47.580
 There are also cases where it's XYY

16:47.580 --> 16:49.240
 where there are two Y chromosomes

16:49.240 --> 16:51.520
 and these have important biological

16:51.520 --> 16:53.280
 and psychological impacts.

16:54.520 --> 16:56.080
 So the first thing we need to establish

16:56.080 --> 16:59.140
 is that there is something called chromosomal sex.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.800
 Whether or not there are two X chromosomes

17:00.800 --> 17:05.800
 or an X and Y chromosome is what we call chromosomal sex.

17:05.800 --> 17:10.120
 But the next stage of separating out the sexes

17:10.120 --> 17:12.240
 is what we call gonadal sex.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.000
 Typically, not always,

17:14.000 --> 17:18.640
 but typically if somebody has testes for their gonads

17:18.640 --> 17:21.040
 we think of them as male.

17:21.040 --> 17:24.940
 And if somebody has ovaries, we think of them as female.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.300
 Although that's not always the case either

17:27.300 --> 17:29.960
 but let's just explore the transition

17:29.960 --> 17:32.000
 from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex

17:32.000 --> 17:33.800
 because it's a fascinating one

17:33.800 --> 17:37.120
 that we all went through in some form or another.

17:37.120 --> 17:40.800
 So this XY that we typically think of

17:40.800 --> 17:44.000
 as promoting masculinization of the fetus.

17:45.120 --> 17:50.120
 We say that because on the Y chromosome, there are genes

17:50.400 --> 17:52.860
 and those genes have particular functions

17:52.860 --> 17:57.240
 that suppress female reproductive organs.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.400
 So on the Y chromosome, there's a gene

18:00.400 --> 18:02.380
 which encodes for something called

18:02.380 --> 18:04.660
 a Mullerian inhibiting hormone.

18:04.660 --> 18:06.920
 So there's actually a hormone

18:06.920 --> 18:09.180
 that's programmed by the Y chromosome

18:09.180 --> 18:12.040
 that inhibits the formation of Mullerian ducts

18:12.040 --> 18:13.200
 which are an important part

18:13.200 --> 18:15.460
 of the female reproductive apparatus.

18:16.760 --> 18:19.680
 That's critical because already we're seeing the transition

18:19.680 --> 18:23.140
 between chromosome Y chromosome and gonad.

18:23.140 --> 18:26.180
 And other genes on the Y chromosome

18:26.180 --> 18:28.400
 promote the formation of testes.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.440
 So there are genes like the SRY gene

18:30.440 --> 18:33.000
 and other genes that promote the formation of testes

18:33.000 --> 18:37.360
 while they also inhibit the formation of the Mullerian ducts.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.960
 So the transition from chromosomal sex to gonadal sex

18:40.960 --> 18:43.320
 is a very important distinction.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.920
 It's kind of a fork in the road

18:44.920 --> 18:46.800
 that happens very early in development

18:46.800 --> 18:49.480
 while fetuses are still in the embryo.

18:49.480 --> 18:52.560
 Now, what's interesting as well

18:52.560 --> 18:55.440
 is that just because there's a Y chromosome

18:55.440 --> 18:57.480
 that can suppress Mullerian duct formation

18:57.480 --> 18:59.480
 and there are other genes on the Y chromosome

18:59.480 --> 19:02.080
 that promote teste development,

19:02.080 --> 19:05.360
 the placenta itself is an endocrine organ.

19:05.360 --> 19:06.480
 I think most people don't know this

19:06.480 --> 19:08.760
 but the placenta is an endocrine organ.

19:08.760 --> 19:12.200
 As well, the mother, which of course is carrying the fetus,

19:12.200 --> 19:16.640
 has an adrenal gland which can produce testosterone.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.160
 There are instances, for example,

19:19.160 --> 19:21.400
 where a mother has either a tumor

19:21.400 --> 19:24.320
 or for some other reason is secreting large levels

19:24.320 --> 19:28.600
 of testosterone while carrying a fetus that is XX

19:28.600 --> 19:31.640
 and that leads to what we would call masculinization

19:31.640 --> 19:33.040
 of certain aspects of the fetus.

19:33.040 --> 19:35.780
 Typically, that would be enlarged clitoris.

19:35.780 --> 19:39.120
 There are also some examples of other phenotypes on the body

19:39.120 --> 19:40.560
 that are created even though

19:40.560 --> 19:44.080
 it's a purely XX chromosomal baby.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.840
 So we have to distinguish

19:45.840 --> 19:48.480
 between chromosomal sex, gonadal sex,

19:48.480 --> 19:51.520
 and then there's what we call hormonal sex

19:51.520 --> 19:55.160
 which is the effects of the steroid hormones,

19:55.160 --> 19:57.960
 estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives

19:57.960 --> 20:00.800
 on what we call morphological sex

20:00.800 --> 20:03.620
 or the shape of the baby and the human and the genitalia

20:03.620 --> 20:05.480
 and the jaw and all these other things.

20:05.480 --> 20:07.780
 And so it actually is quite complicated.

20:07.780 --> 20:11.980
 So it's a long distance from chromosomes to gender identity

20:11.980 --> 20:15.560
 and gender identity has a lot of social influences and roles.

20:15.560 --> 20:17.760
 This is an area that right now is very dynamic

20:17.760 --> 20:19.960
 and in the discussion out there, as you know,

20:19.960 --> 20:21.980
 but just getting from chromosomal sex

20:21.980 --> 20:24.920
 to what we would call gonadal sex

20:24.920 --> 20:27.480
 and hormonal sex and morphological sex

20:27.480 --> 20:28.760
 involves a number of steps.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.020
 So today we're going to talk about those steps

20:31.020 --> 20:32.800
 and there's some fascinating things

20:32.800 --> 20:35.480
 that do indeed relate to tools,

20:35.480 --> 20:39.400
 do indeed relate to some important behavioral choices,

20:39.400 --> 20:43.160
 important choices about things to avoid while pregnant.

20:43.160 --> 20:44.940
 And for those of you that are not pregnant,

20:44.940 --> 20:46.500
 things to avoid if you're thinking

20:46.500 --> 20:48.540
 about eventually having children

20:48.540 --> 20:50.480
 and that is not to drive development

20:50.480 --> 20:51.760
 in one direction or another,

20:51.760 --> 20:54.600
 but there are examples where there are some deleterious

20:54.600 --> 20:55.880
 things in our environment

20:55.880 --> 20:58.160
 that can actually negatively impact

20:58.160 --> 21:00.320
 what we call sexual development overall,

21:00.320 --> 21:02.440
 regardless of chromosomal background.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.120
 So let's get started with that.

21:04.120 --> 21:07.200
 Let's talk a little bit more about what hormones do.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.800
 Hormones generally have two categories of effects.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.500
 They can either be very fast or they can be very slow.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.240
 There are hormones like cortisol and adrenaline,

21:15.240 --> 21:16.800
 which act very fast.

21:16.800 --> 21:20.280
 Adrenaline can increase your heart rate very fast

21:20.280 --> 21:21.480
 when it's secreted into the body.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.180
 Cortisol can be a little bit slower,

21:23.180 --> 21:25.120
 but it also can have some very fast effects.

21:25.120 --> 21:29.120
 And then there are hormones like testosterone and estrogen,

21:29.120 --> 21:32.080
 which we refer to as the sex steroid hormones.

21:33.140 --> 21:36.600
 The sex steroid hormones can have quick effects

21:36.600 --> 21:38.980
 through signaling, meaning they can attach to cells

21:38.980 --> 21:40.960
 and make those cells do different things.

21:40.960 --> 21:43.440
 They can have actually quite quick effects on the brain.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.800
 A lot of people don't know this,

21:44.800 --> 21:46.580
 but there are some very fast effects

21:46.580 --> 21:50.360
 of estrogen and testosterone, as well as long-term effects.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.200
 These molecules, for those of you that are interested,

21:53.200 --> 21:54.520
 are what are called lipophilic,

21:54.520 --> 21:56.240
 which just means that they like fatty stuff.

21:56.240 --> 21:58.160
 They can actually pass through fatty membranes.

21:58.160 --> 22:00.480
 And because the outside of cells,

22:00.480 --> 22:02.560
 as well as what's called the nuclear envelope,

22:02.560 --> 22:05.720
 where all the DNA contents and stuff are stuffed inside,

22:05.720 --> 22:09.240
 are made of lipid, of fat,

22:09.240 --> 22:12.120
 these steroid hormones can actually travel into cells

22:12.120 --> 22:14.720
 and then get into the,

22:14.720 --> 22:16.880
 basically interact with the DNA of cells

22:16.880 --> 22:18.560
 in order to control gene expression.

22:18.560 --> 22:21.160
 So they can change the sorts of things

22:21.160 --> 22:22.480
 that cells will become,

22:22.480 --> 22:24.400
 and they can change the way that cells function

22:24.400 --> 22:25.600
 in a long-term way.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.860
 And that's actually how the presence of these genes,

22:28.860 --> 22:31.640
 like SRY and molarion-inhibiting hormone,

22:31.640 --> 22:35.800
 lead to reductions or elimination, I should say,

22:35.800 --> 22:37.440
 of things like the molarion ducts

22:37.440 --> 22:39.400
 and promote instead what's called in males,

22:39.400 --> 22:41.180
 the Wolfian ducts,

22:41.180 --> 22:44.520
 or promote the development of testes rather than ovaries.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.600
 So all you need to know is that hormones have short-term

22:47.600 --> 22:48.600
 and long-term effects,

22:48.600 --> 22:51.000
 and the long-term effects are actually related

22:51.000 --> 22:52.840
 to their effects on genes

22:52.840 --> 22:56.200
 and how those genes are expressed or repressed

22:56.200 --> 22:57.380
 in order to prevent them

22:57.380 --> 23:00.280
 from having particular proteins made.

23:00.280 --> 23:03.040
 So these hormones, these steroid hormones,

23:03.040 --> 23:05.280
 are exceedingly powerful.

23:05.280 --> 23:07.160
 And if we're going to have a discussion

23:07.160 --> 23:09.980
 about masculinization or feminization, et cetera,

23:09.980 --> 23:11.520
 you also need to think about the counterpart.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.480
 It's not just about masculinizing the body

23:13.480 --> 23:15.020
 or feminizing the body and brain,

23:15.020 --> 23:19.280
 it's also about demasculinizing the brain in many cases

23:19.280 --> 23:21.680
 as a normal biological function

23:21.680 --> 23:25.000
 of typically of XX females,

23:25.000 --> 23:27.960
 and defeminization, the suppression of certain pathways

23:27.960 --> 23:31.340
 that are related to feminization of the body and brain.

23:31.340 --> 23:35.520
 But there are some really fascinating twists in this story.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.980
 So I've just thrown a lot of biology at you,

23:37.980 --> 23:42.540
 but this is where it all starts to get incredibly surprising.

23:43.620 --> 23:47.160
 You would think that it's straightforward, right?

23:47.160 --> 23:49.280
 You have a Y chromosome,

23:49.280 --> 23:53.400
 you suppress the female reproductive pathway

23:53.400 --> 23:55.660
 like the malaria ducts,

23:55.660 --> 23:58.400
 you promote the development of testes,

23:58.400 --> 24:00.580
 and then testes make testosterone,

24:00.580 --> 24:02.700
 and then it organizes the brain male,

24:02.700 --> 24:04.200
 and it wants to do male-like things,

24:04.200 --> 24:06.720
 and then in females, you get estrogen,

24:06.720 --> 24:08.800
 and it wants to do female-like things,

24:08.800 --> 24:11.120
 and air quotes here for all of this.

24:11.120 --> 24:15.460
 And it turns out that isn't how it works at all.

24:15.460 --> 24:16.480
 Here's where it's interesting.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.020
 We have to understand that there are effects

24:19.020 --> 24:22.640
 of these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,

24:22.640 --> 24:25.700
 on what are called primary sexual characteristics,

24:25.700 --> 24:28.500
 which are the ones that you're born with,

24:28.500 --> 24:30.520
 secondary sexual characteristics,

24:30.520 --> 24:32.240
 which are the ones that show up in puberty,

24:32.240 --> 24:34.040
 and these are happening in the brain,

24:34.040 --> 24:35.880
 and body, and spinal cord.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.500
 And so I'm going to disentangle all this for you

24:37.500 --> 24:39.760
 by giving you some examples.

24:39.760 --> 24:41.260
 First, let's talk about the development

24:41.260 --> 24:43.120
 of primary sexual characteristics,

24:43.120 --> 24:46.320
 the ones that show up at birth.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.680
 And one of the more dramatic examples of this

24:49.680 --> 24:53.160
 comes from the role of testosterone

24:53.160 --> 24:56.280
 in creating the external genitalia.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.400
 Now, you might think it's just straightforward.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.240
 If there's testes, because there's a Y chromosome,

25:01.240 --> 25:05.360
 you've got a gene that codes for the development of testes,

25:05.360 --> 25:08.120
 you get testosterone, and the penis grows,

25:08.120 --> 25:09.600
 and the baby is born with a penis.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.540
 One of the first things that happens

25:10.540 --> 25:12.960
 when the baby comes out is they look at the genitalia,

25:12.960 --> 25:14.320
 and they try and make an assessment

25:14.320 --> 25:16.000
 on whether or not it's a, quote, boy,

25:16.000 --> 25:18.060
 or it's a, quote, girl, right?

25:18.060 --> 25:20.520
 That's been done for a very long time

25:20.520 --> 25:22.080
 throughout human history.

25:24.360 --> 25:27.240
 It turns out that it's not testosterone

25:27.240 --> 25:30.600
 that's responsible for the development of the penis

25:30.600 --> 25:34.700
 in a baby that has an X chromosome and a Y chromosome.

25:35.560 --> 25:37.600
 It's a different androgen.

25:37.600 --> 25:40.720
 Androgen is just a category of hormones

25:40.720 --> 25:42.960
 that includes testosterone,

25:42.960 --> 25:47.380
 but testosterone is converted in the fetus

25:47.380 --> 25:50.000
 to something called dihydrotestosterone,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.240
 and that's accomplished through an enzyme

25:52.240 --> 25:53.920
 called 5-alpha reductase.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.880
 Now, dihydrotestosterone has important effects

25:56.880 --> 25:58.220
 later in life too.

25:58.220 --> 25:59.160
 We will talk about those.

25:59.160 --> 26:00.840
 In fact, if you just want to know,

26:00.840 --> 26:03.120
 dihydrotestosterone is what we would call

26:03.120 --> 26:05.600
 the dominant androgen in males.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.120
 It's responsible for aggression.

26:07.120 --> 26:10.980
 It's responsible for a lot of muscular strength.

26:10.980 --> 26:14.440
 It's involved in beard growth and male pattern baldness.

26:14.440 --> 26:15.840
 We're going to talk about all of that.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.360
 But dihydrotestosterone has powerful effects

26:19.360 --> 26:21.340
 in determining the genitalia

26:21.340 --> 26:23.480
 while the baby is still in the embryo.

26:23.480 --> 26:26.640
 So this ends, there's testosterone that's made,

26:27.780 --> 26:30.100
 and that testosterone gets converted

26:30.100 --> 26:32.620
 by this enzyme, 5-alpha reductase,

26:32.620 --> 26:34.940
 in a little structure called the tubercle.

26:34.940 --> 26:37.920
 That tubercle will eventually become the penis.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.660
 So you say, okay, straightforward.

26:39.660 --> 26:42.700
 This testosterone's converted to dihydrotestosterone,

26:42.700 --> 26:44.960
 and then if there's dihydrotestosterone,

26:44.960 --> 26:46.600
 it controls penis growth.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.600
 And indeed, that's the case.

26:48.600 --> 26:51.120
 So that's a primary sexual characteristic.

26:51.120 --> 26:56.120
 That baby will then grow up, and later, during puberty,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.040
 there will be the release of a molecule,

26:58.040 --> 26:59.420
 I talked about this last episode,

26:59.420 --> 27:04.160
 called kispeptin, K-I-S-S-P-E-P-T-I-N, kispeptin,

27:04.160 --> 27:06.120
 which will cause the release of some other hormones,

27:06.120 --> 27:08.040
 canadotropin-releasing hormone, luteinizing hormone,

27:08.040 --> 27:10.080
 will stimulate the testes to make testosterone.

27:10.080 --> 27:13.720
 So in puberty, testosterone leads to further growth

27:13.720 --> 27:15.200
 and development of the penis,

27:15.200 --> 27:19.940
 as well as the accumulation or growth of pubic hair,

27:19.940 --> 27:20.920
 deepening of the voice,

27:20.920 --> 27:24.280
 all the secondary sexual characteristics, okay?

27:24.280 --> 27:28.400
 So dihydrotestosterone creates what we would call

27:28.400 --> 27:30.780
 the typical masculine phenotype

27:30.780 --> 27:33.960
 for primary sexual characteristics,

27:33.960 --> 27:37.240
 and produces, testosterone, excuse me,

27:37.240 --> 27:40.400
 produces secondary sexual characteristics during puberty.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.660
 There's a very interesting phenomenon

27:43.660 --> 27:46.800
 that was published in the journal Science in the 1970s,

27:46.800 --> 27:50.160
 for which now there's a wealth of scientific data.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.040
 And this relates to a genetic mutation

27:53.040 --> 27:55.320
 where 5-alpha reductase,

27:55.320 --> 27:57.740
 the enzyme that converts testosterone

27:57.740 --> 28:00.580
 to dihydrotestosterone, doesn't exist.

28:00.580 --> 28:04.160
 It's mutated in a way in a genome that it doesn't exist.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.400
 And this actually was first identified

28:06.400 --> 28:07.920
 in the Dominican Republic.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.000
 It has shown up elsewhere.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.460
 It's quite rare, but where it shows up, it's robust.

28:14.480 --> 28:17.300
 What happens is baby is born.

28:17.300 --> 28:19.080
 Typically, when a baby is born,

28:19.080 --> 28:20.600
 they don't measure chromosomes.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.960
 They don't look at chromosomal sex, XX or XY.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.240
 That's not typically done nowadays.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.460
 Baby is born.

28:26.460 --> 28:30.080
 If you were to look at that baby, it would look female.

28:30.080 --> 28:34.300
 There would be very little or no external penis.

28:34.300 --> 28:35.760
 And so people would say, it's a girl,

28:35.760 --> 28:38.160
 and they might have the celebration, it's a girl.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.760
 And I guess now they call them gender reveal parties

28:40.760 --> 28:41.600
 or something like that.

28:41.600 --> 28:42.420
 I don't know about this.

28:42.420 --> 28:47.420
 But anyway, the baby would reveal its external genitalia

28:49.680 --> 28:52.200
 simply by being there and being naked when it's born.

28:52.200 --> 28:53.600
 Has nothing to do with gender.

28:53.600 --> 28:56.800
 It has to do with genitalia and sex.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.580
 That baby would be born.

28:58.580 --> 29:02.920
 And what was observed is that from time to time,

29:02.920 --> 29:06.020
 that baby, after being raised as a girl,

29:06.020 --> 29:08.100
 perfectly happy as a girl,

29:08.100 --> 29:12.800
 would, around the age of 11 or 12 or 13,

29:12.800 --> 29:15.520
 would suddenly start to sprout a penis.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.680
 There's actually a name for this.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.280
 It's called huevidosis,

29:18.280 --> 29:23.040
 which the translation is more or less penis at 12.

29:23.040 --> 29:25.640
 And as strange as this might sound,

29:25.640 --> 29:28.520
 it makes sense if you understand the underlying mutation.

29:28.520 --> 29:32.640
 What happens in these children, these huevidosis,

29:32.640 --> 29:35.480
 is that the child is born.

29:35.480 --> 29:40.080
 It has testes, which are not descended, so up in the body.

29:40.080 --> 29:44.120
 They're not making a lot of testosterone early on.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.520
 They weren't able to convert testosterone

29:46.520 --> 29:47.720
 to dihydrotestosterone

29:47.720 --> 29:50.400
 because they lack this enzyme, 5-alpha reductase.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.440
 As a consequence, the primary sexual characteristic

29:54.440 --> 29:59.440
 of external male genitalia, penis, doesn't develop.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.440
 And then what happens is the baby grows up

30:02.440 --> 30:05.760
 as a young child, essentially as treated as a girl.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.860
 Generally, they report being pretty comfortable as girls,

30:08.860 --> 30:10.320
 although not always.

30:10.320 --> 30:13.700
 And then testosterone starts getting secreted

30:13.700 --> 30:16.440
 from the testes because kispeptin in the brain

30:16.440 --> 30:18.760
 signals through gonadotropin and luteinizing hormone,

30:18.760 --> 30:20.000
 travels down to the testes.

30:20.000 --> 30:22.120
 The testes start churning out testosterone

30:22.120 --> 30:24.560
 and there's a secondary growth of the penis.

30:24.560 --> 30:25.800
 And all of a sudden there's a penis.

30:25.800 --> 30:28.640
 And this leads to some very complicated situations

30:28.640 --> 30:30.660
 in families and culturally.

30:30.660 --> 30:33.960
 And actually the outcomes in terms of whether or not

30:33.960 --> 30:37.680
 these children decide to self-identify as males or females

30:37.680 --> 30:40.540
 and how people treat them actually varies quite a lot.

30:40.540 --> 30:43.220
 There's actually been a kind of an adopting

30:43.220 --> 30:48.080
 of a third category of sex and gender in the suavodosis

30:48.080 --> 30:51.040
 in order to just offer them the opportunity

30:51.040 --> 30:55.880
 to explore not just what would be a typical kind of girl

30:55.880 --> 30:59.480
 or woman or boy or man phenotype, but something in between,

30:59.480 --> 31:01.160
 something that some people call intersex,

31:01.160 --> 31:03.680
 although intersex and pseudohermaphroditism

31:03.680 --> 31:05.820
 is actually a separate thing altogether.

31:05.820 --> 31:06.660
 So it's fascinating.

31:06.660 --> 31:11.660
 And the point here is that dihydrotestosterone,

31:11.720 --> 31:15.520
 not testosterone is responsible for this primary growth

31:15.520 --> 31:19.100
 of the penis and that testosterone later is involved

31:19.100 --> 31:21.420
 in the secondary sexual characteristics,

31:21.420 --> 31:23.920
 deepening in the voice, et cetera.

31:23.920 --> 31:25.960
 Now, this is where the information gets even more

31:25.960 --> 31:30.920
 interesting and applies to essentially everybody.

31:30.920 --> 31:34.040
 You might think that testosterone,

31:34.040 --> 31:37.400
 because it masculinizes the body

31:37.400 --> 31:40.240
 in the secondary sexual characteristic way

31:41.200 --> 31:45.300
 and because dihydrotestosterone, another androgen,

31:45.300 --> 31:48.800
 masculinizes the primary sexual characteristics,

31:48.800 --> 31:50.400
 the growth of the penis early on,

31:50.400 --> 31:53.880
 that testosterone must masculinize the brain.

31:53.880 --> 31:58.360
 And there are in fact aspects of masculinization

31:58.360 --> 32:02.700
 of the brain and body that are independent of genitalia.

32:02.700 --> 32:03.940
 Now it might be obvious to some of you,

32:03.940 --> 32:05.880
 but some people probably don't realize that.

32:05.880 --> 32:10.880
 Yes, indeed, the brain has receptors for testosterone.

32:11.840 --> 32:14.120
 It also has receptors for estrogen.

32:15.420 --> 32:20.260
 But the fascinating thing is that if you look at the brains

32:20.260 --> 32:22.880
 of people that have Y chromosomes

32:22.880 --> 32:25.180
 and that have testes and that make testosterone,

32:25.180 --> 32:27.080
 and you look at the brains of people

32:27.080 --> 32:29.760
 that don't have Y chromosomes or testes

32:29.760 --> 32:33.360
 and therefore make far less testosterone in general,

32:36.000 --> 32:39.100
 what you realize is that the cells in the brain

32:39.100 --> 32:42.020
 that differ between what I'll call males and females,

32:42.020 --> 32:47.020
 but between XY and XX have receptors for testosterone,

32:48.880 --> 32:51.440
 but the masculinization of the brain

32:51.440 --> 32:54.720
 is not accomplished by testosterone.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.560
 I want to repeat this.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.360
 The masculinization of the brain

32:57.360 --> 32:59.760
 is not accomplished by testosterone.

32:59.760 --> 33:02.860
 It is accomplished by estrogen.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.960
 Testosterone can be converted into estrogen

33:06.960 --> 33:09.680
 by an enzyme called aromatase.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.440
 This is vitally important to understand.

33:11.440 --> 33:13.560
 Testosterone can be converted into estrogen

33:13.560 --> 33:15.520
 by something called aromatase.

33:15.520 --> 33:19.040
 I'll give an example of where this happens later in life

33:19.040 --> 33:20.540
 to just illustrate the principle

33:20.540 --> 33:22.240
 and really embedded in your mind.

33:23.640 --> 33:28.640
 During puberty in boys, XY chromosome individuals,

33:28.840 --> 33:31.400
 it's not uncommon for there to be transient

33:31.400 --> 33:34.560
 or sometimes long lasting breast bud development.

33:34.560 --> 33:36.840
 Testosterone goes up during puberty

33:36.840 --> 33:39.240
 for the reasons we talked about before,

33:39.240 --> 33:43.060
 and some of that testosterone gets converted into estrogen

33:43.060 --> 33:46.000
 by an enzyme called aromatase.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.280
 Aromatase is made by several sources in the body.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.880
 One of the main sources is body fat.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.640
 So it can make a lot of aromatase.

33:53.640 --> 33:56.440
 Sometimes you'll even see a fairly dramatic

33:56.440 --> 33:58.520
 breast development in males during puberty.

33:58.520 --> 34:00.600
 Sometimes it's transient, sometimes it's not.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.080
 The other place where you see this

34:02.080 --> 34:04.840
 is in athletes and bodybuilders

34:04.840 --> 34:06.920
 that take a lot of anabolic steroids

34:06.920 --> 34:09.240
 that take high levels of androgens.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.040
 So they'll be taking testosterone

34:11.040 --> 34:12.780
 at super physiological doses.

34:13.640 --> 34:15.000
 Sometimes not always,

34:15.000 --> 34:17.820
 they will convert some of that testosterone into estrogen

34:17.820 --> 34:20.080
 and they'll get what's called gynecomastia,

34:20.080 --> 34:23.120
 which is the development of male breast tissue.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.480
 Sometimes they'll get it cut out surgically.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.800
 Other times they'll start trying to take estrogen blockers

34:27.800 --> 34:29.440
 in order to try and suppress it,

34:29.440 --> 34:31.140
 or they'll try and block prolactin.

34:31.140 --> 34:33.560
 It's a topic that we're going to get into in more detail,

34:33.560 --> 34:35.480
 but what's important here is to understand

34:35.480 --> 34:36.840
 that testosterone can be converted

34:36.840 --> 34:39.080
 into the estrogen by aromatase.

34:39.080 --> 34:41.560
 Aromatase is not just made in body fat.

34:41.560 --> 34:44.880
 There are neurons in the brain that make aromatase

34:44.880 --> 34:47.280
 and convert testosterone into estrogen,

34:47.280 --> 34:52.280
 and it is testosterone converted into estrogen.

34:52.360 --> 34:53.760
 In other words, it's estrogen

34:53.760 --> 34:58.060
 that masculinizes the XY individual,

34:58.060 --> 35:00.080
 that masculinizes the brain.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.560
 And this has profound effects on all sorts of things,

35:03.560 --> 35:07.800
 on behavior, on outlook in the world, et cetera.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.180
 But I think most people don't realize

35:09.180 --> 35:12.080
 that it's estrogen that comes from testosterone

35:12.080 --> 35:15.400
 that masculinizes the male brain, the XY brain,

35:15.400 --> 35:19.260
 not testosterone nor dihydrotestosterone.

35:19.260 --> 35:21.340
 So I just want to mention some tools.

35:21.340 --> 35:22.640
 You might be asking yourself,

35:22.640 --> 35:24.520
 how could tools possibly come up

35:24.520 --> 35:26.000
 at this stage of the conversation

35:26.000 --> 35:28.240
 where we're talking about sexual development

35:28.240 --> 35:30.440
 and we're talking about the differentiation

35:30.440 --> 35:32.560
 of tissues in the body?

35:32.560 --> 35:35.880
 Well, this is true both for children and parents and adults.

35:35.880 --> 35:39.800
 I want to emphasize that there are things

35:39.800 --> 35:44.100
 that are environmental and there are things that people use

35:44.100 --> 35:46.040
 that in their homes sometimes

35:46.040 --> 35:49.040
 that actually can impact hormone levels

35:49.040 --> 35:52.800
 and can impact sexual development in fairly profound ways.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.640
 And I want to be very clear.

35:54.640 --> 35:58.520
 This is not me pulling from some rare journal

35:58.520 --> 35:59.640
 I've never heard of it.

35:59.640 --> 36:01.880
 This is pulling from textbooks.

36:01.880 --> 36:04.400
 In particular, today, I'm guiding a lot of the conversation

36:04.400 --> 36:08.540
 on work on behavioral endocrinology.

36:08.540 --> 36:12.240
 This is a book by Randy Nelson and Lance Crigfield,

36:12.240 --> 36:14.060
 true experts in the field.

36:14.060 --> 36:16.520
 I'm going to talk about some of the work from Tyrone Hayes

36:16.520 --> 36:20.000
 from UC Berkeley about environmental toxins

36:20.000 --> 36:21.760
 and their impacts on some of these things

36:21.760 --> 36:23.820
 like testosterone and estrogen.

36:23.820 --> 36:25.320
 I'm going to touch into them.

36:25.320 --> 36:27.320
 I'm going to give some anecdotal evidence

36:27.320 --> 36:28.720
 that's grounded in studies,

36:28.720 --> 36:30.580
 which we will provide in the caption

36:30.580 --> 36:32.320
 or that I'll reference here.

36:32.320 --> 36:34.760
 One of those that's actually really interesting

36:34.760 --> 36:36.740
 but helps illustrate the principle

36:36.740 --> 36:39.120
 that we've been talking about is a few years ago,

36:39.120 --> 36:41.960
 there was a lot of excitement about evening primrose oil.

36:41.960 --> 36:45.460
 Evening primrose oil is in a lot of products

36:45.460 --> 36:47.720
 that typically are associated with skin beauty

36:47.720 --> 36:48.720
 and skin health.

36:48.720 --> 36:51.040
 And so I'm generalizing here,

36:51.040 --> 36:55.360
 but typically it was mothers or sisters that were using it.

36:55.360 --> 36:58.160
 And there were actually examples starting to crop up

36:58.160 --> 37:02.460
 of young boys getting accelerated breast bud development

37:02.460 --> 37:06.400
 from skin contact with women

37:06.400 --> 37:08.320
 who were using evening primrose oil.

37:08.320 --> 37:12.600
 So evening primrose oil is chemically a lot like estrogen

37:12.600 --> 37:14.840
 and it has a lot of estrogenic compounds.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.560
 There are a number of things out there like this.

37:17.560 --> 37:19.840
 So believe it or not, things like pine pollen

37:19.840 --> 37:21.660
 look very much like testosterone.

37:21.660 --> 37:24.760
 Structurally, they are more or less are testosterone.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.540
 Their bioavailability in humans isn't as clear.

37:27.540 --> 37:31.900
 Evening primrose oil has a lot of estrogenic elements to it,

37:31.900 --> 37:33.560
 just structurally how it's built.

37:33.560 --> 37:37.280
 And so there were cases where boys were understandably

37:37.280 --> 37:39.720
 being hugged by their mom or maybe even like showering

37:39.720 --> 37:43.760
 and taking a, using the evening primrose oil solution.

37:43.760 --> 37:47.400
 Those things will actually change levels of estrogens

37:47.400 --> 37:48.880
 in boys and girls.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.880
 And so this wasn't just an issue for young boys.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.320
 This was also an issue for young girls.

37:52.320 --> 37:55.700
 So it's not that evening primrose oil is bad.

37:55.700 --> 37:58.060
 It's just that many of you have probably heard

37:58.060 --> 38:00.560
 about the dangers of soy and isoflavones

38:00.560 --> 38:01.740
 and things like that.

38:01.740 --> 38:04.040
 The impact of soy on estrogen levels

38:04.040 --> 38:07.400
 is there are some decent evidence to support that.

38:07.400 --> 38:09.600
 However, there's a lot of other factors

38:09.600 --> 38:10.480
 that are more severe.

38:10.480 --> 38:13.120
 And one of those is this evening primrose oil.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.400
 So regardless of age, let's just put it this way

38:16.400 --> 38:18.960
 because people might be wanting to drive their hormones

38:18.960 --> 38:21.600
 more estrogenic or more androgenic.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.360
 How could I know what your preference is?

38:24.360 --> 38:25.240
 I don't know.

38:25.240 --> 38:29.360
 But in any case, things like evening primrose oil

38:29.360 --> 38:32.480
 can actually promote estrogenic pathways in the body

38:32.480 --> 38:34.160
 and some of it can go transdermal.

38:34.160 --> 38:37.680
 Likewise, because testosterone replacement therapy

38:37.680 --> 38:39.520
 is fairly widespread nowadays

38:39.520 --> 38:41.480
 and some people accomplish that through cream,

38:41.480 --> 38:44.760
 it's pretty well understood that if someone's taking that,

38:44.760 --> 38:48.060
 that they want to avoid contact with anyone,

38:48.060 --> 38:51.660
 skin contact with anyone that is trying to promote

38:52.600 --> 38:55.360
 more estrogenic activity in their body

38:56.360 --> 38:57.640
 and especially in children.

38:57.640 --> 38:58.520
 So that's one.

38:58.520 --> 39:02.240
 The other is this issue of environmental factors.

39:02.240 --> 39:05.040
 Now this, again, I'm just going to highlight

39:05.040 --> 39:07.720
 when one starts talking about environmental factors

39:07.720 --> 39:10.240
 and how they're poisoning us or disrupting growth

39:10.240 --> 39:11.600
 or fertility rates,

39:11.600 --> 39:13.880
 it can start to sound a little bit crazy

39:13.880 --> 39:15.560
 except when you start to actually look

39:15.560 --> 39:17.080
 at some of the real data,

39:17.080 --> 39:19.120
 data from quality research labs

39:19.120 --> 39:21.060
 funded by federal government,

39:21.060 --> 39:23.780
 funded not from companies or other sources

39:23.780 --> 39:25.120
 that are really aimed at understanding

39:25.120 --> 39:26.760
 what the underlying biology is.

39:26.760 --> 39:30.600
 And for that, we should all be grateful

39:30.600 --> 39:33.280
 to Tyrone Hayes at UC Berkeley.

39:33.280 --> 39:35.800
 I remember way back when I was a graduate student

39:35.800 --> 39:39.780
 in the late 90s, goodness, at UC Berkeley.

39:39.780 --> 39:41.980
 And I remember him, he was studying frogs.

39:41.980 --> 39:45.040
 He was talking about developmental defects

39:45.040 --> 39:47.920
 in these frogs that live in different waters around,

39:47.920 --> 39:50.600
 it was California, but also elsewhere.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.260
 And he identified a substance which is present

39:53.260 --> 39:55.540
 in a lot of waterways throughout this country

39:55.540 --> 39:58.360
 and other countries, so US and beyond,

39:58.360 --> 40:00.400
 certainly not just restricted to California,

40:00.400 --> 40:04.840
 which is atrazine, this is A-T-R-A-Z-I-N-E.

40:04.840 --> 40:06.520
 Again, this is the stuff of textbooks

40:06.520 --> 40:10.260
 and it causes severe testicular malformations.

40:10.260 --> 40:13.400
 So again, atrazine exposure is serious.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.800
 And what's interesting is if you look at the data,

40:17.640 --> 40:20.380
 what you find is that at sites in Western

40:20.380 --> 40:22.480
 and Midwestern sections of the United States,

40:22.480 --> 40:27.120
 10 to 92% of male frogs, these were frogs mind you,

40:27.120 --> 40:29.160
 had testicular abnormalities.

40:29.160 --> 40:32.280
 And the most severe testicular malformations

40:32.280 --> 40:35.040
 were in the testes rather than in the sperm.

40:35.040 --> 40:37.940
 So it's actually the organ itself, the gonad itself.

40:37.940 --> 40:42.680
 Now, it's very well known now that atrazine

40:42.680 --> 40:44.360
 is in many herbicides.

40:44.360 --> 40:47.860
 And so, whereas I would say in the 80s and 90s,

40:47.860 --> 40:51.320
 the discussion around herbicides and their negative effects

40:51.320 --> 40:53.300
 was considered kind of like hippie dippie stuff

40:53.300 --> 40:54.800
 or the stuff you hear about it,

40:56.120 --> 40:57.720
 your local community markets

40:57.720 --> 40:59.520
 and these kind of new age communities,

40:59.520 --> 41:04.360
 now there's very solid data from federally funded labs

41:04.360 --> 41:06.860
 at major universities that have been peer reviewed

41:06.860 --> 41:09.000
 and published in excellent journals,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.200
 showing that indeed many of these herbicides

41:11.200 --> 41:15.460
 can have negative effects primarily by impacting

41:15.460 --> 41:19.820
 the ratios of these hormones in either the mothers

41:19.820 --> 41:24.820
 or in the testes, altering the testes of the fathers

41:24.820 --> 41:29.260
 or direct effects on developing young animals

41:29.260 --> 41:30.340
 and potentially humans.

41:30.340 --> 41:32.140
 And so you ask, well, what about humans?

41:32.140 --> 41:35.140
 Frogs are wonderful, but what about humans?

41:35.140 --> 41:38.780
 So here are the data on what's happening.

41:38.780 --> 41:41.380
 And this isn't all going to be scary stuff.

41:41.380 --> 41:43.700
 We're also going to talk about tools to ameliorate

41:43.700 --> 41:45.700
 and offset some of these effects.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.700
 One would be be cautious with evening primrose

41:47.700 --> 41:49.220
 as well as testosterone creams,

41:49.220 --> 41:51.740
 depending on whether or not you want to be more androgenic

41:51.740 --> 41:54.940
 or estrogenic, depending on your needs.

41:54.940 --> 41:57.080
 But across human populations,

41:57.080 --> 41:59.700
 sperm counts are indeed declining, okay?

41:59.700 --> 42:04.580
 So in 1940, the average density of human sperm

42:04.580 --> 42:08.740
 was 113 million per milliliter of semen.

42:08.740 --> 42:09.560
 That's how it's measured.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.880
 How many sperm per milliliter of semen?

42:11.880 --> 42:15.060
 In 1990, this figure has dropped to 66.

42:15.060 --> 42:18.460
 It went from 113 million per milliliter

42:18.460 --> 42:21.340
 to 66 million per milliliter in the United States

42:21.340 --> 42:22.640
 and Western Europe.

42:22.640 --> 42:24.140
 So it's not just a US thing.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.940
 Researchers also estimated that the volume of semen

42:26.940 --> 42:29.680
 produced by men has dropped 20% in that time,

42:29.680 --> 42:32.660
 reduced sperm count per ejaculation even further.

42:32.660 --> 42:35.920
 So between 1981 and 1991,

42:35.920 --> 42:38.400
 the ratio of normal spermatogenesis has decreased

42:38.400 --> 42:43.400
 from 56.4% to 26.9%.

42:43.620 --> 42:46.740
 So there's a lot that's happening,

42:46.740 --> 42:49.520
 primarily because of these herbicides

42:49.520 --> 42:52.340
 that are in widespread use to reduce sperm counts.

42:52.340 --> 42:54.220
 And these are going to have profound effects,

42:54.220 --> 42:57.180
 not just on sperm counts, but on development,

42:57.180 --> 43:00.160
 sexual development at the level of the gonads and the brain,

43:00.160 --> 43:03.160
 because you need testosterone to get you

43:03.160 --> 43:05.980
 dihydrotestosterone for primary sexual characteristics.

43:05.980 --> 43:08.840
 You need estrogen that's come from testosterone

43:08.840 --> 43:09.980
 to masculinize the brain.

43:09.980 --> 43:13.180
 And of course, we're not just focusing on sperm

43:13.180 --> 43:14.500
 and testosterone.

43:14.500 --> 43:18.180
 You of course also know that many of these herbicides

43:18.180 --> 43:21.740
 are disrupting estrogens in a similar way,

43:21.740 --> 43:26.500
 or are leading to hyper estrogenic states,

43:26.500 --> 43:30.120
 which might explain why puberty is happening

43:30.120 --> 43:33.420
 so much earlier in young girls these days.

43:33.420 --> 43:35.220
 So there are a lot of things that are happening.

43:35.220 --> 43:37.480
 Now, does this mean that you have to run around

43:37.480 --> 43:41.180
 and neurotically avoid anything that includes

43:41.180 --> 43:42.620
 things like atrazine,

43:42.620 --> 43:46.160
 and should you be avoiding all kinds of herbicides?

43:46.160 --> 43:47.820
 I don't know, that's up to you,

43:47.820 --> 43:51.000
 but it does seem that these have pretty marked effects

43:51.000 --> 43:54.640
 in both the animal studies and in the human studies.

43:54.640 --> 43:58.100
 You can open up a textbook like the endocrinology textbook

43:58.100 --> 44:00.460
 and find things like vinclozolin.

44:00.460 --> 44:04.840
 This is V-I-N-C-L-O-Z-O-L-I-N,

44:04.840 --> 44:07.860
 which is a fungicide and it's an anti-androgen.

44:07.860 --> 44:09.680
 You give it to animals, to rats,

44:09.680 --> 44:12.140
 and instead of forming a penis, they don't form a penis.

44:12.140 --> 44:16.180
 They basically, it's not that they form a clitoris,

44:16.180 --> 44:17.700
 they just don't form a penis.

44:17.700 --> 44:20.960
 So let's talk about female sexual development.

44:20.960 --> 44:22.780
 And as always,

44:22.780 --> 44:24.640
 what we'll do is we'll talk about the normal biology.

44:24.640 --> 44:28.900
 Then we'll talk a little bit about a kind of extraordinary

44:28.900 --> 44:30.780
 or unusual set of cases,

44:30.780 --> 44:33.140
 but we'll talk about them

44:33.140 --> 44:35.700
 because they illustrate an important principle

44:35.700 --> 44:39.660
 about how things work under typical circumstances.

44:39.660 --> 44:44.180
 So there is a mutation

44:44.180 --> 44:46.920
 called androgen insensitivity syndrome.

44:46.920 --> 44:50.980
 And understanding how androgen insensitivity syndrome works

44:50.980 --> 44:52.700
 can help you really understand

44:52.700 --> 44:55.760
 how hormones impact sexual development.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.460
 So here's how it works.

44:57.460 --> 45:00.060
 There are individuals who are XY,

45:00.060 --> 45:01.440
 so they have a Y chromosome,

45:01.440 --> 45:06.260
 that are born, that make testosterone,

45:06.260 --> 45:10.180
 they have testes, and they don't have molarion ducts

45:10.180 --> 45:12.180
 because on the Y chromosome

45:12.180 --> 45:14.340
 is this molarion inhibiting hormone.

45:14.340 --> 45:18.560
 However, these individuals look completely female.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.740
 And in general, they report feeling

45:21.740 --> 45:25.280
 like girls when they're young, women when they're older.

45:25.280 --> 45:27.900
 But there's something unusual that's happening

45:27.900 --> 45:28.840
 in these individuals

45:28.840 --> 45:33.840
 because they have an XY chromosomal type and not XX.

45:34.260 --> 45:35.540
 So what's happening?

45:35.540 --> 45:37.620
 Well, what's happening is

45:37.620 --> 45:39.940
 the testes are making testosterone,

45:39.940 --> 45:43.460
 but the receptor for testosterone is mutated.

45:43.460 --> 45:46.700
 And therefore, the testes never descend.

45:46.700 --> 45:49.100
 They don't have ovaries, they have testes,

45:49.100 --> 45:50.940
 but the testes are internal.

45:50.940 --> 45:53.920
 And so typically, these individuals find out

45:53.920 --> 45:55.900
 that they are actually XY chromosomes

45:55.900 --> 46:00.860
 so that their chromosomal sex is male, if you will,

46:00.860 --> 46:03.580
 and their gonadal sex is male,

46:03.580 --> 46:05.960
 but the gonads, the testes are inside the body,

46:05.960 --> 46:07.940
 they don't actually develop a scrotum,

46:07.940 --> 46:09.020
 they don't make ovaries,

46:09.020 --> 46:12.180
 and when they don't menstruate around the time of puberty,

46:12.180 --> 46:15.180
 that's a sign that something is different.

46:15.180 --> 46:16.860
 And so they never menstruate around puberty,

46:16.860 --> 46:19.300
 and if they look into this deeply enough,

46:19.300 --> 46:22.340
 what you find is that they are actually XY,

46:22.340 --> 46:23.360
 they make testosterone,

46:23.360 --> 46:25.420
 but their body can't make use of the testosterone

46:25.420 --> 46:27.880
 because they don't have the receptors.

46:27.880 --> 46:29.920
 And the receptors are vitally important

46:29.920 --> 46:34.140
 for most all of the secondary sexual characteristics

46:34.140 --> 46:35.020
 that we talked about,

46:35.020 --> 46:38.880
 body hair, penis growth during puberty, et cetera.

46:38.880 --> 46:42.100
 They live fairly happy lives as females,

46:42.100 --> 46:44.060
 although, of course, they can't conceive, right?

46:44.060 --> 46:47.260
 They don't have a uterus, they don't have ovaries.

46:47.260 --> 46:50.580
 They also, in general, don't produce sperm

46:50.580 --> 46:51.500
 in quantities enough

46:51.500 --> 46:54.020
 that they could actually reproduce with somebody else,

46:54.020 --> 46:55.580
 although sometimes they can.

46:55.580 --> 46:58.300
 And believe it or not, and I'm not going to name names,

46:58.300 --> 47:02.380
 but there are actually reports of several people,

47:02.380 --> 47:04.540
 fairly prominent people throughout history,

47:04.540 --> 47:07.200
 who have had this androgen insensitivity syndrome,

47:07.200 --> 47:09.860
 or people suspected they did.

47:09.860 --> 47:11.340
 And the reason to not name names

47:11.340 --> 47:13.380
 is that it gets right to the heart

47:13.380 --> 47:16.180
 of whether or not they are male or female.

47:16.180 --> 47:17.560
 How could you say, right?

47:17.560 --> 47:19.380
 They have XY chromosomes,

47:19.380 --> 47:22.420
 but gonadally, they have testes that are inside.

47:22.420 --> 47:24.740
 And yet, if you looked at their bodies,

47:24.740 --> 47:26.700
 if you looked at their faces,

47:26.700 --> 47:29.660
 you would say, almost with certainty,

47:29.660 --> 47:31.900
 that they appeared female.

47:31.900 --> 47:35.160
 And that naturally occurring experiment

47:36.100 --> 47:38.700
 points to the fact that testosterone

47:38.700 --> 47:40.060
 that shows up in the body

47:40.060 --> 47:42.800
 and impacts the things at the levels of the receptor

47:42.800 --> 47:44.740
 has a profound effect on phenotype,

47:44.740 --> 47:47.940
 on the external or body plan.

47:47.940 --> 47:49.700
 So again, we're talking about this

47:49.700 --> 47:51.020
 in order to illustrate the principle

47:51.020 --> 47:53.180
 that in order to have its effects,

47:53.180 --> 47:55.560
 a hormone doesn't just have to be present,

47:55.560 --> 47:58.820
 that hormone actually has to be able to bind its receptor

47:58.820 --> 48:01.920
 and take action on the target cells.

48:01.920 --> 48:04.540
 And once again, I'll just throw out the example

48:04.540 --> 48:08.060
 of where people are using performance-enhancing drugs,

48:08.060 --> 48:09.700
 although that's a pretty broad statement.

48:09.700 --> 48:11.100
 Nowadays, there's a lot of excitement

48:11.100 --> 48:12.780
 about the so-called SARMs,

48:12.780 --> 48:16.140
 which are more on the receptor side.

48:16.140 --> 48:19.460
 And so we'll talk about this in a future episode.

48:19.460 --> 48:20.780
 And I just say that as a teaser

48:20.780 --> 48:23.020
 because the SARMs and what's happening right now

48:23.020 --> 48:25.160
 in augmenting sports performance,

48:25.160 --> 48:26.660
 both with testosterone directly,

48:26.660 --> 48:28.120
 but also testosterone derivatives,

48:28.120 --> 48:31.300
 and then also altering things at the level of the receptor

48:31.300 --> 48:32.780
 is exceedingly interesting

48:32.780 --> 48:36.300
 and is revealing to us the many ways

48:36.300 --> 48:40.360
 in which hormones can impact brain and body in ways

48:40.360 --> 48:41.540
 that we didn't suspect.

48:41.540 --> 48:43.980
 Perhaps the simplest way to understand

48:43.980 --> 48:48.260
 how estrogen and testosterone impact masculinization

48:48.260 --> 48:50.700
 or feminization of the brain and behavior

48:50.700 --> 48:52.620
 is from a statement.

48:52.620 --> 48:55.020
 It's actually the closing sentence of an abstract

48:55.020 --> 48:56.460
 that my colleague Narao Shah

48:56.460 --> 48:59.960
 at Stanford School of Medicine published,

48:59.960 --> 49:02.500
 which is that estrogen,

49:02.500 --> 49:06.860
 again, it's estrogen that is aromatized from testosterone

49:06.860 --> 49:11.860
 by aromatase, sets up the masculine repertoire of sexual

49:12.160 --> 49:15.580
 and in animals and in humans, territorial behaviors.

49:15.580 --> 49:17.900
 So it sets up the circuitry in the brain.

49:17.900 --> 49:19.400
 Estrogen does that.

49:19.400 --> 49:23.600
 Estrogen sets up the masculine circuitry in the brain.

49:23.600 --> 49:28.420
 And testosterone is then what controls the display

49:28.420 --> 49:30.860
 of those behaviors later in life.

49:30.860 --> 49:33.020
 And I find that incredibly interesting.

49:33.020 --> 49:35.020
 You would think it was just testosterone did one thing

49:35.020 --> 49:36.440
 and estrogen did another,

49:36.440 --> 49:38.040
 but it turns out that nature

49:38.040 --> 49:40.340
 is far more interesting than that.

49:40.340 --> 49:41.700
 Okay, so what are some things

49:41.700 --> 49:45.500
 that impact sexual development early in life

49:45.500 --> 49:46.700
 and later in life?

49:47.980 --> 49:51.320
 Let's talk about cannabis.

49:51.320 --> 49:53.580
 Let's talk about alcohol.

49:53.580 --> 49:56.700
 And dare I say, let's talk about cell phones.

49:56.700 --> 49:59.400
 Something that I never thought I would ever do

49:59.400 --> 50:01.260
 either in this podcast or in the classroom,

50:01.260 --> 50:04.660
 but these days there are really interesting data

50:04.660 --> 50:06.340
 and I think you should be aware of them.

50:06.340 --> 50:10.420
 First of all, cannabis, marijuana, THC.

50:10.420 --> 50:12.900
 I realize that there are now

50:12.900 --> 50:15.720
 a lot of different variants on this.

50:15.720 --> 50:18.520
 There are a lot of different strains of cannabis.

50:18.520 --> 50:20.940
 I personally am not a pot smoker.

50:20.940 --> 50:23.060
 It's just not for me.

50:23.060 --> 50:25.780
 I'm not talking about the moral or legal implications.

50:25.780 --> 50:27.500
 In some states it's decriminalized,

50:27.500 --> 50:29.140
 in other places it's really illegal,

50:29.140 --> 50:31.280
 in other places it's basically legal.

50:32.140 --> 50:35.900
 You have to check where you live and understand the laws.

50:35.900 --> 50:37.660
 That's not what this is about.

50:37.660 --> 50:39.760
 What we do know, however,

50:39.760 --> 50:42.660
 is that with the exception of one study,

50:43.620 --> 50:46.780
 there are many studies that point to the fact

50:46.780 --> 50:51.060
 that THC and other things in cannabis

50:51.060 --> 50:56.060
 promote significant increases in aromatase activity.

50:57.140 --> 50:58.660
 Pot smokers aren't going to like this,

50:58.660 --> 51:00.840
 especially male pot smokers aren't going to like this,

51:00.840 --> 51:02.140
 but it's the reality.

51:02.140 --> 51:04.980
 Remember, what you're hearing in the background

51:04.980 --> 51:06.740
 is Costello snoring really loud.

51:06.740 --> 51:08.140
 Should we put him on screen?

51:08.140 --> 51:10.820
 He's not a cannabis smoker, but you can imagine why.

51:10.820 --> 51:13.340
 Here, come here Costello, come here buddy, come here.

51:13.340 --> 51:15.060
 He's asleep, come here.

51:15.060 --> 51:16.100
 He's like, come here.

51:16.100 --> 51:16.940
 There you go.

51:20.220 --> 51:23.820
 This dog definitely does not need cannabis.

51:23.820 --> 51:25.420
 This is his state for most of the time.

51:25.420 --> 51:27.620
 He is highly, apparently he's asleep still.

51:27.620 --> 51:30.140
 So some of you have asked to see Costello.

51:30.140 --> 51:31.460
 If you're just listening on audio,

51:31.460 --> 51:33.220
 maybe he'll give us something.

51:33.220 --> 51:34.380
 That's a, oh, okay.

51:34.380 --> 51:36.260
 We're going to let him get back to sleep.

51:36.260 --> 51:37.180
 He's always here.

51:37.180 --> 51:39.060
 Some of you have asked to see him.

51:39.060 --> 51:40.920
 Costello is not a pot smoker either.

51:42.460 --> 51:47.460
 He did have a dog sitter that was a pot smoker years ago.

51:47.860 --> 51:52.860
 It was his favorite dog sitter, but I'm not a pot smoker.

51:52.980 --> 51:55.980
 Again, no judgment, but here's the deal.

51:55.980 --> 51:59.980
 That cannabis, and it's not clear if it's THC itself

51:59.980 --> 52:02.740
 or other elements in the marijuana plant,

52:02.740 --> 52:05.860
 promote aromatase activity.

52:05.860 --> 52:09.500
 Now, this has been observed anecdotally

52:09.500 --> 52:12.040
 where pot smokers have a higher incidence

52:12.040 --> 52:13.900
 of developing something I mentioned before,

52:13.900 --> 52:15.940
 gynecomastia, breast bud development,

52:15.940 --> 52:19.520
 or full-blown breast development in males.

52:19.520 --> 52:20.540
 There may be some women

52:20.540 --> 52:24.060
 who want to increase their estrogenic activity.

52:24.060 --> 52:27.060
 Remember, females make testosterone.

52:27.060 --> 52:28.960
 It comes from the adrenals, right?

52:28.960 --> 52:31.900
 They don't have testes, so it comes from the adrenals,

52:31.900 --> 52:34.420
 and that testosterone can also be aromatized,

52:34.420 --> 52:37.520
 although typically most of the aromatase activity

52:37.520 --> 52:39.800
 that we're referring to in these examples is in males.

52:39.800 --> 52:42.940
 So testosterone can increase estrogenic activity.

52:42.940 --> 52:44.780
 So you might say, oh, therefore,

52:44.780 --> 52:49.300
 does testosterone reduce sexual behavior?

52:49.300 --> 52:51.580
 Does it create all sorts of things

52:51.580 --> 52:54.980
 that are related to low testosterone?

52:54.980 --> 52:58.060
 Not necessarily, not necessarily, and here's why.

52:59.500 --> 53:03.620
 Estrogen itself in males and females

53:03.620 --> 53:07.640
 is important for things like libido and sexual behavior.

53:08.940 --> 53:10.120
 I'm going to repeat that.

53:10.120 --> 53:12.120
 If estrogen is too low in males,

53:12.120 --> 53:15.820
 it can actually inhibit libido and sexual behavior.

53:15.820 --> 53:19.740
 So you don't want estrogen too high or too low,

53:19.740 --> 53:21.660
 whether or not you're male or female.

53:21.660 --> 53:23.520
 Now, of course, in females,

53:23.520 --> 53:26.900
 estrogen levels tend to be higher than in males.

53:26.900 --> 53:28.600
 I'm speaking very generally here.

53:28.600 --> 53:30.420
 You just think back to the chromosomal sex.

53:30.420 --> 53:33.260
 That's what I'm referring to when I say male or female,

53:33.260 --> 53:35.540
 although there's nuance there, of course.

53:35.540 --> 53:39.900
 In females, the testosterone that comes from the adrenals

53:39.900 --> 53:44.660
 has a powerful effect on libido and desire to reproduce,

53:44.660 --> 53:45.540
 and in the next episode,

53:45.540 --> 53:47.100
 we're going to talk about how that works

53:47.100 --> 53:48.860
 in its relationship to birth control,

53:48.860 --> 53:50.500
 its relationship to menopause.

53:50.500 --> 53:52.780
 We're also going to talk about how that whole thing works

53:52.780 --> 53:54.440
 in males as well.

53:54.440 --> 53:59.400
 But cannabis and other aspects of the marijuana plant

53:59.400 --> 54:02.780
 can impact levels of testosterone and estrogen

54:02.780 --> 54:04.220
 by increasing aromatase,

54:04.220 --> 54:06.780
 and so people should be aware of that.

54:06.780 --> 54:08.540
 As well, there are good data.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.460
 I was able to find several studies on PubMed

54:10.460 --> 54:13.180
 pointing to the fact that smoking marijuana

54:13.180 --> 54:18.140
 during pregnancy can shift the pattern of hormones

54:18.140 --> 54:20.240
 in the developing fetus,

54:20.240 --> 54:24.020
 such that it promotes more estrogenic outcomes.

54:24.020 --> 54:25.900
 Now, earlier I said that estrogen

54:25.900 --> 54:27.900
 is what masculinizes the male brain.

54:27.900 --> 54:29.480
 In utero, that's true,

54:29.480 --> 54:31.420
 but the way that cannabis seems to work,

54:31.420 --> 54:33.940
 at least from the studies I was able to identify,

54:33.940 --> 54:38.500
 is that it promotes circulating estrogen in the body

54:38.500 --> 54:40.460
 and therefore can counteract

54:40.460 --> 54:42.500
 some of the masculinizing effects

54:42.500 --> 54:46.900
 of things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone

54:46.900 --> 54:49.660
 on primary and secondary sexual characteristics.

54:49.660 --> 54:52.560
 So I mention this because, you know,

54:52.560 --> 54:55.980
 I think nowadays marijuana use is far more widespread

54:55.980 --> 54:57.260
 and certainly during puberty,

54:57.260 --> 55:01.020
 it can have profound effects on these hormonal systems.

55:01.020 --> 55:03.020
 And so we'll do another episode

55:03.020 --> 55:04.180
 that goes really deep into this,

55:04.180 --> 55:07.540
 but yes, cannabis promotes estrogenic activity

55:07.540 --> 55:09.840
 by increasing aromatase.

55:09.840 --> 55:13.260
 Most everyone can appreciate that drinking during pregnancy

55:13.260 --> 55:15.100
 is not good for the developing fetus.

55:15.100 --> 55:17.540
 Fetal alcohol syndrome is a well-established

55:18.440 --> 55:21.240
 negative outcome of pregnancy.

55:21.240 --> 55:24.100
 And it's something that there are cognitive effects

55:24.100 --> 55:25.420
 that are really bad.

55:25.420 --> 55:29.020
 There's actually physical malformation, et cetera.

55:29.020 --> 55:31.700
 So drinking during pregnancy, not good.

55:31.700 --> 55:33.900
 Probably drinking during puberty, not good either

55:33.900 --> 55:38.260
 because alcohol, in particular, certain things like beer,

55:38.260 --> 55:43.260
 but other grain alcohols can increase estrogenic activity.

55:43.260 --> 55:48.260
 Now, this isn't just about protecting young boys

55:49.780 --> 55:51.480
 from estrogenic activity.

55:51.480 --> 55:56.000
 It's also protecting girls from excessive

55:56.000 --> 56:01.000
 or even hypoestrogenic effects of alcohol in puberty.

56:02.000 --> 56:05.900
 Now, many teenagers drink, college students drink,

56:05.900 --> 56:07.740
 and it's important to point out that puberty

56:07.740 --> 56:10.980
 doesn't start on one day and end on another day.

56:10.980 --> 56:13.220
 Puberty has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

56:13.220 --> 56:16.100
 But development is really our entire lifespan.

56:16.100 --> 56:20.100
 This idea that puberty has us open and close,

56:20.100 --> 56:21.460
 that's just false.

56:21.460 --> 56:23.100
 Okay, so we talked about cannabis.

56:23.100 --> 56:24.860
 We talked about alcohol.

56:24.860 --> 56:26.860
 Let's talk about cell phones.

56:26.860 --> 56:29.860
 First of all, I use a cell phone.

56:29.860 --> 56:32.240
 I use it very often,

56:32.240 --> 56:34.380
 and I do not think they are evil devices.

56:34.380 --> 56:37.920
 I think that they require some discipline

56:37.920 --> 56:40.820
 in order to make sure that it does not become

56:40.820 --> 56:42.220
 a negative force in one's life.

56:42.220 --> 56:44.220
 So I personally restrict the number of hours

56:44.220 --> 56:47.020
 that I'm on the phone and in particular on social media.

56:47.020 --> 56:49.860
 I only answer email at particular times of day.

56:49.860 --> 56:52.520
 But what about the cell phone itself?

56:53.740 --> 56:56.380
 When I was a junior professor,

56:56.380 --> 56:58.980
 I was a pre-tenure, early professor,

56:58.980 --> 57:01.300
 I taught this class on neural circuits

57:01.300 --> 57:02.700
 and health and disease.

57:02.700 --> 57:04.860
 And one of the students asked me,

57:04.860 --> 57:07.140
 are cell phones safe for the brain?

57:07.140 --> 57:11.860
 And all the data pointed to the fact that they were,

57:11.860 --> 57:14.980
 or at least there were no data showing that it wasn't.

57:14.980 --> 57:16.780
 I still don't have the answer on that, frankly.

57:16.780 --> 57:18.180
 I don't see a lot of studies about it.

57:18.180 --> 57:20.460
 I'm not personally aware of any evidence

57:20.460 --> 57:22.220
 in quality peer-reviewed studies

57:22.220 --> 57:24.520
 showing that cell phones are bad for the brain

57:24.520 --> 57:26.520
 or that holding the phone to the ear is bad

57:26.520 --> 57:28.360
 or that Bluetooth is bad or any of that.

57:28.360 --> 57:30.340
 I'm just not aware of any quality studies.

57:30.340 --> 57:33.340
 If you are aware of quality studies, peer-reviewed studies,

57:33.340 --> 57:36.580
 please reference them, put them in the comment section,

57:36.580 --> 57:38.580
 send them to me, however you like.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.800
 I'd love to see them.

57:39.800 --> 57:40.640
 I'm not aware of them.

57:40.640 --> 57:45.640
 However, I was very interested in a particular study

57:45.680 --> 57:50.680
 that was published back in 2013 on rats.

57:51.740 --> 57:53.200
 It was basically took a cell phone

57:53.200 --> 57:54.820
 and put it under a cage of rats

57:54.820 --> 57:57.180
 and looked at basically testicular

57:57.180 --> 57:58.580
 and ovarian development in rats

57:58.580 --> 58:03.580
 and saw minor but still statistically significant defects

58:03.900 --> 58:06.640
 in ovarian and testicular development.

58:06.640 --> 58:11.020
 Since then, and now returning to the literature,

58:11.020 --> 58:16.020
 I've seen a absolute explosion of studies,

58:16.060 --> 58:18.260
 some of which are in quality journals,

58:18.260 --> 58:19.940
 some of which are in what I would call

58:19.940 --> 58:22.380
 not blue ribbon journals,

58:22.380 --> 58:27.380
 identifying defects in testicular and or ovarian development

58:27.900 --> 58:32.900
 by mere exposure to cell phone emitted waves.

58:33.160 --> 58:34.000
 Let's just call that.

58:34.000 --> 58:34.980
 We don't know what they are.

58:34.980 --> 58:37.520
 And this sounds almost crazy, right?

58:37.520 --> 58:39.420
 Anytime somebody starts talking about EMFs

58:39.420 --> 58:40.660
 and things like that, you kind of worry like,

58:40.660 --> 58:41.880
 is this person okay?

58:41.880 --> 58:45.240
 But look, the literature are pointing in a direction

58:45.240 --> 58:50.240
 where chronic exposure of the gonads to cell phones

58:50.580 --> 58:52.420
 could be creating serious issues

58:52.420 --> 58:55.500
 in terms of the health at the cellular level

58:55.500 --> 58:56.900
 and in terms of the output.

58:56.900 --> 59:00.900
 So the output for the testes would be sperm production.

59:00.900 --> 59:03.560
 Swimming speed in sperm is an important feature

59:03.560 --> 59:05.380
 of sperm health. In the ovaries,

59:05.380 --> 59:07.620
 it would be estrogenic output,

59:07.620 --> 59:10.980
 how regular the cycles are.

59:10.980 --> 59:13.120
 So in animals, the cycles are a little bit different

59:13.120 --> 59:15.140
 than in humans. They don't have a menstrual cycle.

59:15.140 --> 59:16.580
 They have an estrous cycle,

59:16.580 --> 59:18.460
 which is generally around four days.

59:20.040 --> 59:23.420
 I think that it's fair to say based on the literature

59:23.420 --> 59:27.980
 that there are effects of cell phone emitted waves

59:27.980 --> 59:29.580
 on gonadal development.

59:29.580 --> 59:33.000
 The question is, what is the proximity of the cell phone

59:33.000 --> 59:33.840
 to the gonads?

59:33.840 --> 59:38.020
 Now I've taken the literature as I observe it.

59:38.020 --> 59:40.940
 And then of course, we'll point you to in the captions.

59:40.940 --> 59:45.260
 And I don't like to have my cell phone on and in my pocket.

59:45.260 --> 59:47.180
 I'm well past puberty, but nonetheless,

59:47.180 --> 59:49.500
 some of these effects were seen in adult animals.

59:49.500 --> 59:52.500
 There are effects now that have been demonstrated in humans.

59:52.500 --> 59:55.260
 So let's just talk about a couple of those effects.

59:55.260 --> 59:58.620
 So a paper published in the journal Clinical Biochemistry

59:58.620 --> 1:00:03.220
 from Eskander et al, looked at hormone profiles

1:00:03.220 --> 1:00:08.080
 in people based on proximity to their phone

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:09.420
 and frequency of phone use,

1:00:09.420 --> 1:00:11.460
 where they stored their phone on their body,

1:00:11.460 --> 1:00:15.660
 as well as proximity of where they lived to,

1:00:15.660 --> 1:00:19.140
 I guess they're called these radio frequency towers,

1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:20.760
 so the base stations.

1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:23.680
 And they were looking at effects of radio frequency,

1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:27.780
 radiation, RFR on human hormone profiles.

1:00:27.780 --> 1:00:31.600
 And they show significant decreases in cortisol.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:33.060
 You might say, well, that might be good,

1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:35.740
 but you need that morning cortisol bump

1:00:35.740 --> 1:00:38.400
 in order to wake up, morning cortisol is good.

1:00:38.400 --> 1:00:41.060
 But also thyroid hormones were significantly reduced.

1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:45.720
 Prolactin in young females, that's definitely concerning.

1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:48.300
 And testosterone levels in males and females.

1:00:48.300 --> 1:00:51.340
 And so there are now quite good data showing

1:00:51.340 --> 1:00:55.220
 that being close to the phone too much of the day

1:00:55.220 --> 1:00:58.140
 and how close is an interesting question,

1:00:58.140 --> 1:01:00.620
 or living near one of these base stations

1:01:00.620 --> 1:01:04.660
 apparently can have effects on hormone profiles.

1:01:04.660 --> 1:01:08.460
 And when you see a study like this, one should always ask,

1:01:08.460 --> 1:01:11.040
 well, what are the other things that could also have effects

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:12.660
 on these hormone profiles, right?

1:01:12.660 --> 1:01:15.660
 Because you could imagine that if you ran the same study

1:01:15.660 --> 1:01:17.660
 of people that live close to a waterway

1:01:17.660 --> 1:01:20.660
 or close to a highway where there's a lot of exhaust

1:01:20.660 --> 1:01:23.340
 from buses and cars, you might see similar effects.

1:01:23.340 --> 1:01:24.920
 So you have to take these sorts of studies

1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:25.980
 with a grain of salt.

1:01:25.980 --> 1:01:27.220
 But I think it's very interesting.

1:01:27.220 --> 1:01:29.620
 And given that the last time I looked into these data

1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:33.100
 were way back when I was a junior professor

1:01:33.100 --> 1:01:35.740
 and there was like one or two studies that I could find,

1:01:35.740 --> 1:01:39.180
 one of the studies pointed to increases in testosterone

1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:41.420
 in rats where they had close proximity

1:01:41.420 --> 1:01:45.300
 to these radio frequency radiation waves.

1:01:45.300 --> 1:01:46.920
 And then in the other case,

1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:49.500
 it showed decreases in testosterone.

1:01:49.500 --> 1:01:52.340
 So there really wasn't any conclusion to take away

1:01:52.340 --> 1:01:53.180
 from that.

1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:57.220
 So now there's pretty impressive amount of data

1:01:57.220 --> 1:01:59.360
 pointing to the fact that there are effects

1:01:59.360 --> 1:02:00.920
 of these things on hormones.

1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:02.420
 I don't know what to do with that information.

1:02:02.420 --> 1:02:04.020
 I'm not going to stop using my phone,

1:02:04.020 --> 1:02:08.500
 but in light of the work from Tyrone Hayes and others

1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:13.020
 looking at sperm counts and looking at the decrease

1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:16.140
 in testosterone levels and sperm counts and fertility

1:02:16.140 --> 1:02:18.420
 over the last 20, 30 years,

1:02:18.420 --> 1:02:20.840
 perhaps it's not surprising.

1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:24.580
 Although there again, cell phones and smartphones

1:02:24.580 --> 1:02:26.380
 have really been in prominent use

1:02:26.380 --> 1:02:28.460
 mostly within the last 10 or 11 years.

1:02:28.460 --> 1:02:31.140
 And so it's hard to explain all of those declines

1:02:31.140 --> 1:02:33.740
 simply on the basis of cell phone use.

1:02:33.740 --> 1:02:35.540
 There's some interesting effects of hormones

1:02:35.540 --> 1:02:38.940
 that actually you can observe on the outside of people

1:02:38.940 --> 1:02:41.300
 that tell you something about

1:02:41.300 --> 1:02:43.240
 not just their level of hormones,

1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:45.700
 but also about their underlying genetics.

1:02:45.700 --> 1:02:48.220
 And these relate to beard growth and baldness.

1:02:48.220 --> 1:02:49.440
 And it's fascinating.

1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:52.460
 The molecule, the hormone,

1:02:52.460 --> 1:02:55.380
 dihydrotestosterone made from testosterone

1:02:56.580 --> 1:03:00.100
 is the hormone primarily responsible for facial hair,

1:03:00.100 --> 1:03:01.080
 for beard growth.

1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:05.100
 As well, it's the molecule,

1:03:05.100 --> 1:03:08.780
 the hormone primarily responsible for lack of hair

1:03:08.780 --> 1:03:11.340
 on the head for hair loss.

1:03:11.340 --> 1:03:12.560
 So how does that work?

1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:15.620
 Well, DHT circulates in the body

1:03:15.620 --> 1:03:19.060
 and it binds to DHT receptors in the face

1:03:19.060 --> 1:03:21.340
 to promote hair growth.

1:03:21.340 --> 1:03:24.440
 But it binds to DHT receptors on the scalp

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:26.140
 to promote hair loss.

1:03:27.300 --> 1:03:29.620
 Not incidentally,

1:03:29.620 --> 1:03:33.940
 the drugs that are designed to prevent hair loss

1:03:33.940 --> 1:03:37.520
 are 5-alpha reductase inhibitors.

1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:40.140
 So remember 5-alpha reductase from the huevadosis?

1:03:40.140 --> 1:03:42.540
 Well, the people that discovered the huevadosis

1:03:42.540 --> 1:03:44.260
 went on to do a lot of research

1:03:44.260 --> 1:03:46.120
 on the underlying biochemistry

1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:49.540
 of this really interesting molecule, dihydrotestosterone.

1:03:49.540 --> 1:03:51.760
 They identified 5-alpha reductase

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:55.340
 and 5-alpha reductase inhibitors

1:03:55.340 --> 1:03:59.140
 are the basis of most of the anti-hair loss treatments

1:03:59.140 --> 1:04:00.700
 that are out there.

1:04:00.700 --> 1:04:02.300
 And so there are some interesting things here.

1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:05.040
 First of all, the side effect profiles

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:08.100
 of those treatments for hair loss

1:04:08.100 --> 1:04:10.240
 are quite severe in many individuals.

1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:13.820
 Remember DHT is the primary androgen for libido,

1:04:13.820 --> 1:04:17.540
 for strength and connective tissue repair,

1:04:17.540 --> 1:04:19.940
 for aggression,

1:04:19.940 --> 1:04:22.600
 even if that aggression of course is held in check,

1:04:22.600 --> 1:04:24.540
 but just sort of ambition and aggression

1:04:24.540 --> 1:04:25.620
 is related to dopamine,

1:04:25.620 --> 1:04:27.980
 but within the testosterone pathway,

1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:30.100
 less so pure testosterone,

1:04:30.100 --> 1:04:31.860
 although pure testosterone has its effects,

1:04:31.860 --> 1:04:36.380
 but DHT is at least in primate species including humans

1:04:36.380 --> 1:04:38.080
 is the dominant androgen

1:04:38.080 --> 1:04:40.640
 for most of those sorts of effects.

1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:43.560
 And if you look at somebody,

1:04:43.560 --> 1:04:46.060
 everyone can predict whether or not

1:04:46.060 --> 1:04:48.300
 they're going to go bald based on looking at their,

1:04:48.300 --> 1:04:50.260
 we're always taught our mother's father.

1:04:50.260 --> 1:04:52.620
 So if your mother's father was bald,

1:04:52.620 --> 1:04:55.500
 there's a higher probability that you're going to go bald.

1:04:56.420 --> 1:04:58.960
 The pattern of DHT receptors on the scalp

1:04:58.960 --> 1:04:59.860
 will dictate whether or not

1:04:59.860 --> 1:05:01.560
 you're going to go bald everywhere

1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:05.220
 or just in the front or so called crown type baldness.

1:05:05.220 --> 1:05:06.800
 And the density of the beard

1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:08.920
 tells you about the density of DHT receptors.

1:05:08.920 --> 1:05:13.180
 Now this varies by background, by genetic background.

1:05:13.180 --> 1:05:15.260
 And actually around the world nowadays,

1:05:15.260 --> 1:05:18.100
 because people travel and people form couples

1:05:18.100 --> 1:05:20.980
 and have kids with so many different people

1:05:20.980 --> 1:05:22.420
 of different mixed cultures,

1:05:22.420 --> 1:05:23.860
 you're seeing this starting to disappear.

1:05:23.860 --> 1:05:26.080
 But there are areas of the world

1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:28.740
 where all the men seem to be,

1:05:28.740 --> 1:05:30.020
 have the same pattern of baldness,

1:05:30.020 --> 1:05:31.780
 like a strip of baldness down the center

1:05:31.780 --> 1:05:34.060
 with hair still on the sides and full beards.

1:05:34.060 --> 1:05:37.180
 That's because these patterns of DHT receptors

1:05:37.180 --> 1:05:39.020
 are genetically determined.

1:05:39.020 --> 1:05:42.740
 Elsewhere, testosterone levels can still be very high.

1:05:42.740 --> 1:05:45.560
 DHT levels in the blood can be very high.

1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:48.300
 And yet people will have very light beards or no beards.

1:05:48.300 --> 1:05:49.940
 And that's because they don't have

1:05:49.940 --> 1:05:52.260
 a lot of DHT receptors in the face.

1:05:52.260 --> 1:05:53.420
 And still other cultures,

1:05:53.420 --> 1:05:55.980
 you'll see people with huge beards,

1:05:55.980 --> 1:05:57.180
 tons of beard grow like their beards

1:05:57.180 --> 1:05:58.500
 are growing all the way up to their eyes

1:05:58.500 --> 1:05:59.780
 and they have huge heads of hair.

1:05:59.780 --> 1:06:01.460
 And that's because they have a lot of DHT receptors

1:06:01.460 --> 1:06:03.840
 on the face and not on the scalp.

1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:06.260
 So there are a lot of effects of DHT

1:06:06.260 --> 1:06:09.380
 that you can just see in male phenotypes.

1:06:09.380 --> 1:06:12.260
 And it's interesting that these hair loss drugs

1:06:12.260 --> 1:06:15.920
 that are, or to prevent hair loss drugs

1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:19.900
 are directly aimed at preventing the conversion

1:06:19.900 --> 1:06:22.860
 of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone.

1:06:22.860 --> 1:06:25.960
 And that's why they, to some extent prevent hair loss,

1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:29.380
 but also to some extent have a bunch of side effects

1:06:29.380 --> 1:06:31.820
 that are associated with low DHT.

1:06:31.820 --> 1:06:35.260
 Along these lines, there's a particular sports supplement

1:06:35.260 --> 1:06:37.780
 that a lot of people use called creatine.

1:06:37.780 --> 1:06:39.820
 Creatine now, there's a lot of research

1:06:39.820 --> 1:06:43.700
 showing that creatine can bring more water into the muscle.

1:06:43.700 --> 1:06:45.820
 It can support strength.

1:06:45.820 --> 1:06:47.700
 It does a number of other things.

1:06:47.700 --> 1:06:50.180
 Might even have some important cognitive promoting,

1:06:50.180 --> 1:06:53.180
 cognitive enhancement effects, although mild.

1:06:53.180 --> 1:06:56.740
 The studies there show that it can be significant.

1:06:56.740 --> 1:06:59.660
 Some people, not all, it's more anecdotal,

1:06:59.660 --> 1:07:01.980
 report that creatine promotes hair loss.

1:07:03.060 --> 1:07:04.540
 It differs by individual.

1:07:04.540 --> 1:07:07.340
 For some people that's true, for others, no.

1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:09.620
 But yes, it does appear based on the studies

1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:10.920
 I was able to find on PubMed

1:07:10.920 --> 1:07:15.300
 that creatine does promote 5-alpha reductase activity

1:07:15.300 --> 1:07:17.420
 and therefore the conversion of testosterone

1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:19.140
 into dihydrotestosterone.

1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:21.760
 And so it makes sense that it might promote

1:07:21.760 --> 1:07:24.980
 some degree of hair loss, as well as beard growth,

1:07:24.980 --> 1:07:27.220
 as well as the other effects of DHT.

1:07:28.260 --> 1:07:31.380
 I recall in junior high school and middle school,

1:07:31.380 --> 1:07:33.140
 going home one summer, it was seventh grade,

1:07:33.140 --> 1:07:34.100
 coming back in the eighth grade,

1:07:34.100 --> 1:07:36.000
 and a kid that I knew that I was friends with

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.380
 went from being like a young kid to,

1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:40.400
 he was like a grown man, he had a full beard.

1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:41.240
 It was amazing.

1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:42.780
 It was like he would completely transform.

1:07:42.780 --> 1:07:44.420
 I mean, puberty, as I've said before,

1:07:44.420 --> 1:07:48.220
 is without a doubt the most accelerated

1:07:48.220 --> 1:07:50.180
 rate of development that we will go through

1:07:50.180 --> 1:07:53.180
 at any point in our lives, even faster than infancy,

1:07:53.180 --> 1:07:54.900
 just in terms of the huge number

1:07:54.900 --> 1:07:58.180
 of different cognitive changes and physical changes.

1:07:58.180 --> 1:08:00.640
 Not surprisingly, that same individual

1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:04.820
 was mostly or bald by his early 20s.

1:08:04.820 --> 1:08:06.000
 And that's because he must've had

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.020
 just exceedingly high levels of DHT.

1:08:08.020 --> 1:08:09.380
 I also played soccer with this kid,

1:08:09.380 --> 1:08:11.180
 and he was basically like dribbling past everybody.

1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:12.520
 He was like a grown man playing soccer

1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:13.940
 with a bunch of little kids.

1:08:13.940 --> 1:08:16.060
 Full beard, bald at 20.

1:08:16.060 --> 1:08:18.440
 And so the rate of maturation,

1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:20.940
 the rate of aging is very interesting.

1:08:20.940 --> 1:08:22.380
 It's hard to know rate of aging.

1:08:22.380 --> 1:08:24.620
 There's some genetic tests that now can allow you to do that.

1:08:24.620 --> 1:08:27.540
 Things like Horvath clocks and things of that sort.

1:08:27.540 --> 1:08:29.500
 Beautiful work of David Sinclair at Harvard

1:08:29.500 --> 1:08:31.480
 and others has pointed to this.

1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:36.480
 The speed of entry and exit from puberty might be,

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:38.400
 I'm putting it out there as a hypothesis,

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:40.100
 might be an interesting window

1:08:40.100 --> 1:08:42.640
 into how fast one is going through

1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:44.520
 their aging or developmental arc,

1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:46.020
 because development, of course,

1:08:46.020 --> 1:08:48.440
 doesn't just start at birth and end after puberty.

1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:50.560
 It continues your entire life.

1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:52.600
 So I think it's interesting.

1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:57.520
 You will often see that people, boys and girls,

1:08:57.520 --> 1:08:59.180
 I should say boys or girls,

1:08:59.180 --> 1:09:02.640
 will develop secondary sexual characteristics

1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:03.620
 at different rates.

1:09:03.620 --> 1:09:05.320
 And sometimes it's sequential.

1:09:05.320 --> 1:09:07.720
 You might see a kid will,

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.920
 she'll grow very tall or she'll have a big growth spurt,

1:09:10.920 --> 1:09:13.920
 but then breast development will come a little bit later.

1:09:13.920 --> 1:09:16.680
 And then other features will come a little bit later.

1:09:16.680 --> 1:09:17.980
 You can also see this in boys.

1:09:17.980 --> 1:09:19.680
 The person that I referred to earlier,

1:09:19.680 --> 1:09:22.800
 my friend that developed full beard, went bald.

1:09:22.800 --> 1:09:24.000
 He was also quite muscular.

1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.240
 He's a great athlete.

1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:27.400
 So he went through puberty exceedingly fast.

1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:29.120
 Other people go through it more slowly.

1:09:29.120 --> 1:09:32.700
 Some people will go through puberty at age 14,

1:09:32.700 --> 1:09:35.000
 but they won't start to accumulate facial hair

1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.960
 until much, much later.

1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:40.040
 Or their voice will change first very early,

1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:43.240
 and then they won't get the other secondary

1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:45.720
 sexual characteristics until much later.

1:09:45.720 --> 1:09:48.280
 And so we don't really know how that impacts

1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:51.440
 or relates to overall trajectory or rate of aging,

1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:53.760
 but it's an interesting thing to think about

1:09:53.760 --> 1:09:55.280
 for each and every one of us.

1:09:55.280 --> 1:09:56.720
 I'm going to offer you the opportunity

1:09:56.720 --> 1:10:00.200
 to do an experiment today while listening to the podcast.

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:05.200
 But first I want to tell you a story about hyenas,

1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:10.540
 professional baseball, and clitorises the size of penises.

1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:15.400
 So when I was a graduate student at UC Berkeley,

1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:17.740
 we had a professor in our department,

1:10:17.740 --> 1:10:21.480
 phenomenal scientist named Steve Glickman.

1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:26.480
 Steve Glickman had a colony of hyenas, spotted hyenas,

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:30.540
 that lived within caged enclosures, of course,

1:10:30.540 --> 1:10:33.180
 in Tilden Park behind the UC Berkeley campus.

1:10:33.180 --> 1:10:34.920
 The enclosures are actually still there.

1:10:34.920 --> 1:10:36.960
 I run past there fairly often.

1:10:36.960 --> 1:10:39.020
 The hyenas are no longer there.

1:10:39.020 --> 1:10:41.360
 This was a federally funded field station.

1:10:41.360 --> 1:10:44.600
 These animals were brought over from Africa

1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:46.480
 or were bred there.

1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:50.040
 And the reason why there were hyenas in Tilden Park,

1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:53.480
 enclosed in Tilden Park,

1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:56.880
 was because hyenas exhibit an incredible feature

1:10:56.880 --> 1:11:00.600
 to their body, their hormones, and their social structure.

1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:05.640
 Hyenas, unlike many species,

1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:08.000
 have a situation with their genitalia

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.440
 where the male penis is actually smaller

1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:14.940
 than the female clitoris.

1:11:14.940 --> 1:11:17.200
 And I should say that the male penis itself,

1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:20.840
 having seen a fair number of hyena penises,

1:11:20.840 --> 1:11:22.700
 is not particularly small,

1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:26.720
 which means that the hyena clitorises are extremely large.

1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:30.220
 This was well-known for some time.

1:11:30.220 --> 1:11:33.760
 It turns out that in these spotted hyenas,

1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:37.000
 the females are dominant.

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.540
 So after a kill, the females will eat,

1:11:39.540 --> 1:11:41.240
 then their young will eat,

1:11:41.240 --> 1:11:43.840
 and then the male hyenas will eat.

1:11:44.840 --> 1:11:49.040
 As well, when the female hyena gives birth,

1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:53.080
 she gives birth not through the vaginal canal

1:11:53.080 --> 1:11:56.440
 that we're accustomed to seeing,

1:11:56.440 --> 1:12:01.440
 but through a very enlarged clitoris-like phallus,

1:12:03.140 --> 1:12:05.680
 although it's not a phallus, it's a clitoris,

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:07.680
 and it literally splits open.

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:09.360
 So many fetuses die

1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:13.240
 during the course of hyena development and birth.

1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:16.360
 These animals have this,

1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:17.920
 what could only be described

1:12:17.920 --> 1:12:19.960
 as a very large sort of giant clitoris,

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:22.280
 although for a hyena, it's not giant, it's normal.

1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:25.240
 And it splits open, and the baby actually comes through.

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:29.100
 The baby hyena actually comes through the tissue,

1:12:29.100 --> 1:12:31.640
 and it's a very traumatic birth.

1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:33.880
 A lot of tissue is torn away, et cetera.

1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:36.840
 And as I mentioned, a lot of baby hyenas die.

1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:41.840
 It was a mystery as to how the female hyenas have this,

1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:44.000
 we'll call it masculinization,

1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:47.000
 but it's really a androgen, excuse me,

1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:52.000
 androgenization of the periphery of the genitalia.

1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:55.440
 And it turns out through a lot of careful research

1:12:55.440 --> 1:13:00.000
 done by Steve Glickman, Christine Dre, and others,

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:03.720
 that it's androstenedione,

1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:06.620
 what is essentially a pro-hormone to testosterone,

1:13:07.820 --> 1:13:10.520
 it's androstenedione at very high levels

1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:13.600
 that's produced in female hyenas

1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:16.640
 that creates this enlargement of their genitalia.

1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:19.280
 So if you want to read up on androstenedione,

1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:22.020
 androstenedione is made into testosterone

1:13:22.020 --> 1:13:27.020
 through this enzyme, 17-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:32.320
 It's a complicated pathway to pronounce.

1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:35.600
 It's a fairly straightforward pathway biochemically.

1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.240
 You may recall during the 90s and 2000s,

1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:42.600
 there were a lot of performance enhancing drug scandals,

1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:45.040
 in particular in major league baseball.

1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:47.660
 And it was purported,

1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:49.660
 although I don't know that it was ever verified,

1:13:49.660 --> 1:13:51.920
 but it was purported that the major

1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:55.960
 performance enhancing drug of abuse at that time,

1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:58.000
 in particular players whose names we won't mention,

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.380
 but you can Google it if you want to find out,

1:14:00.380 --> 1:14:01.760
 was androstenedione.

1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:03.480
 And I actually recall long ago

1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:07.540
 when you could buy androstenedione in the health food stores.

1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:10.080
 And so it was sold over the counter.

1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:13.120
 So a lot's changed since then,

1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:15.360
 but it's interesting that these hyenas

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:19.000
 with these highly androgenized genitalia

1:14:20.440 --> 1:14:24.080
 accomplish that through high levels of androstenedione

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:24.920
 in the females.

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:27.160
 Now, if that's unusual,

1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:28.960
 what might be even more unusual

1:14:28.960 --> 1:14:31.400
 is that a graduate student that I was working with

1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:34.220
 at the time, alongside, we didn't share research.

1:14:34.220 --> 1:14:36.520
 Her name was Nicola Sipka.

1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:40.360
 She is actually a trained animal behavioral expert.

1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:43.760
 She had trained ferrets for that show, The Beastmaster,

1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:46.680
 and she would train wolves for television shows

1:14:46.680 --> 1:14:47.760
 and was a dog trainer.

1:14:47.760 --> 1:14:49.440
 She had these two large dogs that,

1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:51.320
 unlike my dog, would actually listen to her

1:14:51.320 --> 1:14:53.680
 when she would give them commands.

1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:55.080
 A remarkable scientist.

1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:58.340
 She was studying a species of mole

1:14:58.340 --> 1:14:59.860
 that also lived in Tilden Park.

1:14:59.860 --> 1:15:01.720
 People are going to start to wonder about Tilden Park.

1:15:01.720 --> 1:15:03.040
 What's in Tilden Park?

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:06.640
 But this particular mole that lived there

1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:09.060
 had testes for part of the year

1:15:09.060 --> 1:15:12.520
 and had the capacity to transdifferentiate its testes

1:15:12.520 --> 1:15:15.400
 into ovaries in order to balance out the ratio

1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:17.260
 of males and females in the population

1:15:17.260 --> 1:15:20.440
 to keep reproduction at appropriate levels

1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:22.260
 for that certain population.

1:15:22.260 --> 1:15:26.200
 So some animals are actually able to adjust

1:15:26.200 --> 1:15:31.200
 whether or not they have androgenized or estrogenized gonads

1:15:32.080 --> 1:15:36.840
 in order to adjust the ratios of offspring

1:15:36.840 --> 1:15:39.840
 or the males and females in there for promote offspring.

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:41.960
 And the last little anecdote about this,

1:15:41.960 --> 1:15:45.120
 which is also published in the scientific literature,

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:47.360
 which is weird, but I do find interesting.

1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:48.680
 Hormones are so fascinating.

1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:50.480
 They're just incredible to me,

1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:54.880
 is going back to the marijuana plant.

1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:57.760
 The marijuana plant has these estrogenic properties.

1:15:58.860 --> 1:16:02.240
 And I asked a plant biologist whether or not

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:03.380
 this was unusual.

1:16:03.380 --> 1:16:07.500
 And I asked, because there's all this stuff out there

1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:09.300
 about, oh, soy does this,

1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:12.940
 and these plants are highly estrogenic, et cetera,

1:16:12.940 --> 1:16:13.920
 although we should probably point out

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:15.820
 that a lot of factory meats are also estrogenic.

1:16:15.820 --> 1:16:18.020
 So this isn't a meat versus plants thing.

1:16:18.020 --> 1:16:19.280
 But this plant biologist told me,

1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:22.640
 oh yeah, there are plants that make

1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:26.000
 what is essentially the equivalent of testosterone,

1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:28.520
 like pine pollen, it looks a lot like testosterone.

1:16:28.520 --> 1:16:30.340
 And there are other plants that make

1:16:30.340 --> 1:16:33.020
 what is essentially estrogen.

1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:34.740
 And I said, well, why would they do that?

1:16:34.740 --> 1:16:37.620
 And plants, at least as far as I know,

1:16:37.620 --> 1:16:38.580
 don't have a consciousness.

1:16:38.580 --> 1:16:39.540
 They don't have a brain.

1:16:39.540 --> 1:16:41.180
 They don't have neurons even.

1:16:41.180 --> 1:16:45.220
 But his answer was fascinating.

1:16:45.220 --> 1:16:48.020
 He said that one of the reasons

1:16:48.020 --> 1:16:51.080
 why some plants have evolved this capacity

1:16:51.080 --> 1:16:56.080
 to increase estrogen levels in animals that smoke,

1:16:56.420 --> 1:16:58.680
 not smoke it, but then animals that consume them,

1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:00.540
 I'm guessing that animals aren't smoking marijuana,

1:17:00.540 --> 1:17:03.060
 although, I don't know, send me the paper

1:17:03.060 --> 1:17:04.000
 if you've heard of this,

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.840
 is that plants have figured out ways,

1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:10.060
 they've adapted ways to push back on populations

1:17:10.060 --> 1:17:13.060
 of rodents and other species of animals that eat them.

1:17:13.060 --> 1:17:17.660
 So plants are engaged in a kind of plant to animal warfare

1:17:17.660 --> 1:17:19.340
 where they increase the estrogen

1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:22.140
 of the males in that population to lower the sperm counts

1:17:22.140 --> 1:17:25.420
 to keep those populations clamped at certain levels

1:17:25.420 --> 1:17:28.300
 so that those plants can continue to flourish

1:17:28.300 --> 1:17:33.140
 even if those animals are reproducing very robustly.

1:17:33.140 --> 1:17:35.180
 And I find this just fascinating.

1:17:35.180 --> 1:17:37.740
 And hormones, therefore,

1:17:37.740 --> 1:17:41.860
 aren't just impacting tissue growth and development

1:17:41.860 --> 1:17:44.340
 within the individual and between the mother.

1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:46.380
 Remember, the placenta is an endocrine organ

1:17:46.380 --> 1:17:47.340
 and the offspring.

1:17:47.340 --> 1:17:49.840
 But plants and animals are in this communication.

1:17:49.840 --> 1:17:51.360
 And today we're in this communication.

1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:53.540
 I'm telling you that there are certain herbicides

1:17:53.540 --> 1:17:56.020
 that humans are using for which there's very good data

1:17:56.020 --> 1:17:59.360
 are disrupting the endocrine pathways.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:03.140
 And so it's fascinating that humans and other animals

1:18:03.140 --> 1:18:05.340
 were always in this interplay with plants

1:18:05.340 --> 1:18:07.900
 and the other things in our environment.

1:18:07.900 --> 1:18:10.940
 And hormones and adjusting the hormone levels

1:18:10.940 --> 1:18:14.100
 of animals and plants is one way in which the environment

1:18:14.100 --> 1:18:17.180
 kind of pushes back or pushes forward, if you will,

1:18:17.180 --> 1:18:20.740
 in terms of promoting their wellbeing and longevity

1:18:20.740 --> 1:18:21.960
 as well as you trying to promote

1:18:21.960 --> 1:18:23.800
 your wellbeing and longevity.

1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:25.940
 If anyone wants to see the incredible paper

1:18:25.940 --> 1:18:27.900
 by Steve Glickman and colleagues,

1:18:27.900 --> 1:18:30.020
 it was published in the Prosthenes of the National Academy

1:18:30.020 --> 1:18:32.260
 first in 1987.

1:18:32.260 --> 1:18:33.380
 That's Glickman et al.

1:18:33.380 --> 1:18:35.860
 That was the hypothesis that it was androstenedione.

1:18:35.860 --> 1:18:40.860
 And then if you just Google Glickman Hyenas Science Magazine,

1:18:41.100 --> 1:18:43.620
 there's a beautiful cover article

1:18:43.620 --> 1:18:45.820
 and feature all about that important discovery.

1:18:45.820 --> 1:18:47.220
 It's a fascinating one.

1:18:47.220 --> 1:18:50.300
 And I should mention also that those discoveries,

1:18:50.300 --> 1:18:54.260
 both the moles and the hyenas weren't just impactful

1:18:54.260 --> 1:18:56.460
 for the world of animal behavior and endocrinology.

1:18:56.460 --> 1:18:59.460
 They've also strongly impacted understanding

1:18:59.460 --> 1:19:01.620
 of conditions that show up in the clinic,

1:19:01.620 --> 1:19:03.580
 which we haven't talked about today,

1:19:03.580 --> 1:19:06.040
 which is actually pseudo hermaphroditism.

1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:09.140
 Occasionally babies will be born where it is unclear

1:19:09.140 --> 1:19:13.220
 if they are boys or girls based on the genitalia.

1:19:13.220 --> 1:19:17.900
 And this has a very important ethical and other issues.

1:19:17.900 --> 1:19:19.980
 Do you raise them as a boy or a girl?

1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:23.580
 It's not super uncommon for this to happen.

1:19:23.580 --> 1:19:27.160
 And there've been terrible cases where people have gone

1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:32.160
 against the chromosomal sex and the person was very unhappy

1:19:32.780 --> 1:19:34.900
 with the choice that their parents had made for them.

1:19:34.900 --> 1:19:36.620
 There were also cases where they've gone

1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:39.100
 with the chromosomal sex and the person was very happy

1:19:39.100 --> 1:19:39.940
 about the outcome.

1:19:39.940 --> 1:19:41.340
 There've been cases where they've been treated

1:19:41.340 --> 1:19:43.100
 with hormones and there've been cases

1:19:43.100 --> 1:19:44.620
 where they have not been treated with hormones.

1:19:44.620 --> 1:19:49.620
 It's a complicated literature and it has to be sorted out

1:19:50.860 --> 1:19:52.380
 on kind of a case by case basis,

1:19:52.380 --> 1:19:54.060
 but it is something that does happen.

1:19:54.060 --> 1:19:56.940
 And the studies on androstenedione and hyenas

1:19:56.940 --> 1:19:59.860
 and in these very interesting moles,

1:19:59.860 --> 1:20:02.820
 pseudo hermaphroditic moles that live in Tilden Park

1:20:02.820 --> 1:20:05.040
 have impacted not just the science,

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:08.260
 but the therapeutics around those important issues.

1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:10.520
 So now last but not least,

1:20:10.520 --> 1:20:13.860
 I want to discuss the effects of hormones

1:20:13.860 --> 1:20:18.580
 while you and I were separately in utero

1:20:18.580 --> 1:20:22.300
 and the effects that that had on who we are,

1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:28.980
 who we select as mates, so mate choice, sexual preference,

1:20:28.980 --> 1:20:31.620
 and all other aspects

1:20:31.620 --> 1:20:35.380
 of what you would call sexual development.

1:20:35.380 --> 1:20:38.620
 Now, this is something that's gotten a lot of popular press

1:20:38.620 --> 1:20:42.260
 and it has to do with how exposure to androgens

1:20:42.260 --> 1:20:46.380
 in particular while we were in utero impacted

1:20:46.380 --> 1:20:50.180
 whether or not people report as homosexual, heterosexual,

1:20:50.180 --> 1:20:52.720
 identify as male or female.

1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:54.220
 I'm very familiar with this work

1:20:54.220 --> 1:20:56.100
 because I was a graduate student in the department

1:20:56.100 --> 1:20:57.300
 that first published this work

1:20:57.300 --> 1:20:59.580
 and I'm an author on the paper.

1:20:59.580 --> 1:21:01.620
 I was not the main driver of the work,

1:21:01.620 --> 1:21:03.540
 but I was involved in the work

1:21:03.540 --> 1:21:06.100
 and I certainly know the people that did this work.

1:21:07.780 --> 1:21:09.420
 First, it starts with a story.

1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:13.760
 There was a researcher who's still going now.

1:21:13.760 --> 1:21:16.460
 His name is Dennis McFadden.

1:21:16.460 --> 1:21:19.060
 I believe he was at UT Austin back then

1:21:19.060 --> 1:21:22.220
 and he was studying the auditory system

1:21:22.220 --> 1:21:23.540
 and people would come into his clinic

1:21:23.540 --> 1:21:25.700
 and he would, or his laboratory,

1:21:25.700 --> 1:21:28.560
 and he would look at hearing

1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:30.120
 and he would explore different aspects

1:21:30.120 --> 1:21:31.740
 of what they call the psychophysics of hearing

1:21:31.740 --> 1:21:33.300
 and understanding hearing thresholds

1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:34.820
 and frequency thresholds.

1:21:34.820 --> 1:21:36.800
 And he made several observations

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:43.060
 and those observations were that young males

1:21:43.060 --> 1:21:47.060
 tended to have what are called autoacoustic emissions

1:21:47.060 --> 1:21:49.780
 more often than young females did.

1:21:49.780 --> 1:21:52.180
 Autoacoustic emissions, as the name suggests,

1:21:52.180 --> 1:21:54.620
 are the ears actually making sounds.

1:21:54.620 --> 1:21:56.100
 Now, these sounds have to be picked up

1:21:56.100 --> 1:21:57.420
 by a special apparatus

1:21:57.420 --> 1:21:58.880
 because they can hear into that frequency,

1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:00.220
 but it turns out that your ears

1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:02.440
 don't just take sound waves

1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:04.220
 and convert them into these things,

1:22:04.220 --> 1:22:05.280
 this thing we call hearing,

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:07.500
 but they also, in some cases, make sounds.

1:22:07.500 --> 1:22:10.360
 So your ears are making sounds, strange, right?

1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:14.420
 So it turns out that there's a sex difference

1:22:14.420 --> 1:22:16.740
 in autoacoustic emissions.

1:22:16.740 --> 1:22:20.460
 Turns out also that people that self-report as lesbians,

1:22:21.820 --> 1:22:24.180
 they also have autoacoustic emissions

1:22:24.180 --> 1:22:26.460
 significantly more than females

1:22:26.460 --> 1:22:29.460
 that don't self-report as lesbian.

1:22:29.460 --> 1:22:33.520
 And Dennis noticed this and published this,

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:35.340
 and it was an important discovery

1:22:35.340 --> 1:22:38.360
 because it was one of the first discoveries

1:22:38.360 --> 1:22:43.360
 that pointed to the fact that there are sex differences

1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:46.900
 in biology that are independent of sex.

1:22:46.900 --> 1:22:49.140
 I mean, this is hearing in autoacoustic emissions.

1:22:49.140 --> 1:22:54.100
 And just to really illustrate what the former problem was

1:22:54.100 --> 1:22:56.600
 and why this study was so important,

1:22:56.600 --> 1:22:58.640
 a lot of people had explored, for instance,

1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:03.640
 whether or not homosexuals had lower testosterone,

1:23:03.840 --> 1:23:04.740
 for instance, in males.

1:23:04.740 --> 1:23:06.740
 And actually the result often was the opposite,

1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:09.980
 that gay men or men that self-report as gay

1:23:09.980 --> 1:23:12.420
 often had much higher testosterone.

1:23:12.420 --> 1:23:15.040
 And those studies then became controversial

1:23:15.040 --> 1:23:16.860
 because people said, well,

1:23:16.860 --> 1:23:19.460
 sexual behavior can relate to testosterone, et cetera.

1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:21.220
 And so it became very controversial.

1:23:21.220 --> 1:23:22.660
 And then there were some studies

1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:25.500
 that attempted to look at the equivalent phenomenon

1:23:25.500 --> 1:23:28.100
 in people that self-report as lesbian

1:23:28.100 --> 1:23:30.260
 or self-report as heterosexual.

1:23:30.260 --> 1:23:31.820
 And so it became very complicated,

1:23:31.820 --> 1:23:36.160
 but this was an identification of a phenomenon,

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:39.020
 autoacoustic emissions, that was independent of anything

1:23:39.020 --> 1:23:41.580
 that had to do with sexual or even social behavior.

1:23:43.140 --> 1:23:44.940
 1998 rolls around,

1:23:45.820 --> 1:23:48.900
 and I'm a graduate student at UC Berkeley

1:23:48.900 --> 1:23:50.900
 and a guy by the name of Mark Breedlove,

1:23:50.900 --> 1:23:54.000
 kind of an ironic name given that he worked

1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:57.320
 and still works on sexual dimorphism in the brain

1:23:57.320 --> 1:23:59.380
 and in the spinal cord and nervous system.

1:23:59.380 --> 1:24:02.360
 And Mark, who's a phenomenal scientist,

1:24:03.260 --> 1:24:05.600
 comes running down the hall, I'll never forget this,

1:24:05.600 --> 1:24:06.980
 and he said, give me your hands.

1:24:06.980 --> 1:24:08.220
 I was like, give me your hands.

1:24:08.220 --> 1:24:10.560
 And he pulls out a ruler and he starts measuring my fingers.

1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:11.860
 And he takes down a couple of measurements

1:24:11.860 --> 1:24:13.620
 and then he goes away.

1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:15.500
 And I'm like, what was that?

1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:18.340
 Well, I was in a course that Mark was teaching

1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:19.820
 at that point.

1:24:19.820 --> 1:24:24.820
 And soon after we did a study that Mark directed,

1:24:26.060 --> 1:24:29.020
 exploring the finger length ratios,

1:24:29.020 --> 1:24:30.660
 and I'll explain what those are,

1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:34.020
 of males and females

1:24:34.020 --> 1:24:35.780
 and people that self-reported

1:24:35.780 --> 1:24:38.480
 as homosexual or heterosexual.

1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:40.780
 So let's just get to the basic,

1:24:40.780 --> 1:24:43.520
 what we'll call sex differences first.

1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:45.380
 These are averages I want to point out.

1:24:45.380 --> 1:24:46.980
 Anytime you get into this kind of topic,

1:24:46.980 --> 1:24:49.340
 people assume it's causal, but it's not causal.

1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:51.580
 These are averages that I'm about to report.

1:24:52.820 --> 1:24:55.520
 It is the case that the ratio

1:24:55.520 --> 1:24:57.980
 of what's called the D2 to D4 digits.

1:24:57.980 --> 1:24:59.860
 So the D2 is your index finger.

1:24:59.860 --> 1:25:01.100
 So your thumb is D1,

1:25:01.100 --> 1:25:03.580
 then D2 would be your index finger that you would point with.

1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:06.300
 Middle finger is D3, which you whatever with.

1:25:06.300 --> 1:25:10.500
 And then D4 is the so-called ring finger, okay?

1:25:10.500 --> 1:25:11.760
 And D5 is the pinky.

1:25:12.860 --> 1:25:17.860
 It is the case that the D2 to D4 ratio

1:25:18.060 --> 1:25:23.060
 is greater in self-reported females than it is in males.

1:25:23.620 --> 1:25:24.460
 What does that mean?

1:25:24.460 --> 1:25:29.460
 It means that digit D2 and D4 are more similar in length

1:25:29.940 --> 1:25:31.700
 in females than in males.

1:25:31.700 --> 1:25:34.760
 And the effect is particularly, excuse me,

1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:39.180
 pronounced on the right hand, although not always, okay?

1:25:39.180 --> 1:25:41.420
 And it does not have to do with handedness.

1:25:41.420 --> 1:25:45.820
 This D2 to D4 difference has to be measured correctly.

1:25:45.820 --> 1:25:47.680
 You can't just look at somebody's hands and say,

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:51.960
 oh, their ring finger and index finger are very similar

1:25:51.960 --> 1:25:54.260
 and therefore they are female

1:25:55.640 --> 1:25:58.880
 or they were exposed to very little testosterone in utero.

1:25:58.880 --> 1:26:00.260
 You can't look at somebody

1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:02.200
 and see that their index finger is much shorter

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.040
 than their ring finger and say,

1:26:04.040 --> 1:26:06.740
 oh, they must've been exposed to a lot of androgen.

1:26:06.740 --> 1:26:07.900
 You have to actually measure it

1:26:07.900 --> 1:26:09.860
 and you have to measure it correctly.

1:26:09.860 --> 1:26:12.380
 You have to measure it from the base of the finger

1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:15.220
 where there's that first crease all the way to the tip

1:26:15.220 --> 1:26:17.660
 past the, you can't include the fingernails

1:26:17.660 --> 1:26:18.580
 if you're growing fingernails,

1:26:18.580 --> 1:26:20.180
 it would be logical here, folks.

1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:24.940
 So you can't normally see it from the back of the hand,

1:26:24.940 --> 1:26:26.900
 although I don't know if this will show up here,

1:26:26.900 --> 1:26:29.260
 but if you look at the back of the hand,

1:26:29.260 --> 1:26:30.580
 sometimes you can see it.

1:26:30.580 --> 1:26:33.980
 In my case, for instance, let me see if I can do this.

1:26:33.980 --> 1:26:37.720
 So my D4 is a little bit longer than my D2.

1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:39.380
 In some people it's more pronounced

1:26:39.380 --> 1:26:40.300
 and that's on my right hand.

1:26:40.300 --> 1:26:41.120
 On the other hand,

1:26:41.120 --> 1:26:42.620
 the difference actually is far less pronounced.

1:26:42.620 --> 1:26:47.160
 It's a little bit pronounced there, but not so much.

1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:50.600
 So that's sort of the typical ratio that you would see.

1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:54.740
 Turns out that in mice and in humans,

1:26:54.740 --> 1:26:59.180
 the more androgen that you were exposed to in utero,

1:27:00.140 --> 1:27:01.980
 the smaller the D4, D2 ratio,

1:27:01.980 --> 1:27:05.780
 meaning that the ring finger tends to be slightly longer

1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:07.460
 than the pointer finger.

1:27:07.460 --> 1:27:08.440
 And in females,

1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:13.120
 because they're exposed to less androgen in utero typically,

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:15.320
 then those fingers tend to be more equal in length.

1:27:15.320 --> 1:27:18.040
 And these are subtle differences and these are averages.

1:27:18.040 --> 1:27:19.920
 I invite you to look up the paper.

1:27:19.920 --> 1:27:21.800
 This was published in Nature in 2000

1:27:21.800 --> 1:27:26.400
 and it's been replicated six times.

1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:28.640
 Now here's where it gets even more interesting

1:27:30.020 --> 1:27:31.520
 and potentially precarious.

1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:33.480
 So we're going to step cautiously here.

1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:37.260
 If you look at the finger length ratios

1:27:37.260 --> 1:27:40.640
 of men that self-report as homosexual,

1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:43.320
 they have either the typical male pattern

1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:45.600
 of D2 to D4 ratio

1:27:45.600 --> 1:27:49.200
 or a hyper masculinized D4 to D2 ratio.

1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:51.600
 Now this can't be something that's established

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:53.680
 or modified by behavior.

1:27:53.680 --> 1:27:56.040
 This has to be something that was established in utero.

1:27:56.040 --> 1:28:00.480
 And in fact, it's present at birth, okay?

1:28:00.480 --> 1:28:03.720
 So it completely divorces the interactions

1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:05.280
 between hormones and behavior.

1:28:05.280 --> 1:28:07.160
 And that's an important theme that we've been talking about

1:28:07.160 --> 1:28:08.900
 and we're going to talk about even more next episode

1:28:08.900 --> 1:28:10.400
 is that hormones impact behavior

1:28:10.400 --> 1:28:12.100
 but behavior also impact hormones.

1:28:12.100 --> 1:28:14.860
 But this is a case of hormones impacting

1:28:14.860 --> 1:28:16.340
 what really should be considered

1:28:16.340 --> 1:28:18.780
 a primary sexual characteristic

1:28:18.780 --> 1:28:20.240
 because it doesn't show up in puberty.

1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:21.400
 It shows up before puberty.

1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:23.880
 It's actually established in utero.

1:28:23.880 --> 1:28:27.040
 And in people that self-reported lesbians,

1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:29.160
 and I remember going out there and collecting these data

1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:31.860
 with the collaborators on this work.

1:28:31.860 --> 1:28:33.620
 Again, I wasn't the main driver on the work

1:28:33.620 --> 1:28:36.200
 but I participated in some of the analysis.

1:28:36.200 --> 1:28:38.160
 People that self-report as lesbians

1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:43.160
 also tend to have a smaller D2 to D4 ratio.

1:28:43.560 --> 1:28:46.400
 So this is consistent with the autocoustic emissions study

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:48.200
 that Dennis McFadden had published.

1:28:48.200 --> 1:28:51.860
 And it points to the fact that early exposure to androgens

1:28:51.860 --> 1:28:54.600
 may have an impact,

1:28:54.600 --> 1:28:59.540
 not just on androgenization of the body plan

1:28:59.540 --> 1:29:04.540
 but also separately on sexual preference.

1:29:04.660 --> 1:29:06.940
 Now, this raises all sorts of interesting questions

1:29:06.940 --> 1:29:08.960
 about biological basis of sexual preference.

1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:10.800
 I'll tell you about another study,

1:29:10.800 --> 1:29:13.780
 a guy named Simon LeVay who was at UCLA

1:29:13.780 --> 1:29:16.560
 who trained under Hubel and Wiesel.

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:18.720
 If any of you remember early episodes on plasticity,

1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:20.280
 David Hubel and Torrance and Wiesel,

1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:22.860
 my scientific great-grandparents won the Nobel Prize

1:29:22.860 --> 1:29:26.620
 for discovery of critical periods for brain plasticity.

1:29:26.620 --> 1:29:28.600
 They defined some of the most important aspects

1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:31.600
 of how we see and brain plasticity.

1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:33.840
 Simon LeVay trained with them.

1:29:33.840 --> 1:29:36.300
 And then Simon went on to discover

1:29:36.300 --> 1:29:40.620
 that in the brains of people that self-report homosexual,

1:29:40.620 --> 1:29:42.400
 there is a brain difference.

1:29:42.400 --> 1:29:43.960
 And the brain difference is in an area

1:29:43.960 --> 1:29:45.520
 called the interstitial nucleus

1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:47.560
 of the anterior hypothalamus.

1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:50.440
 So it's the INAH.

1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:54.720
 And so there are published reports

1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:56.340
 that was published in Science.

1:29:56.340 --> 1:29:58.120
 The other work I refer to as published in Nature

1:29:58.120 --> 1:30:00.680
 and then replicated no fewer than six times

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:02.600
 and the McFadden results that point

1:30:02.600 --> 1:30:07.600
 to strong biological correlates of mate choice

1:30:09.480 --> 1:30:11.560
 of sexual preference.

1:30:11.560 --> 1:30:16.560
 And these tie directly to things like androgenization

1:30:17.420 --> 1:30:20.280
 or estrogenization, meaning we could call it maleness

1:30:20.280 --> 1:30:22.600
 or femaleness, but that's sort of tricky territory

1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:24.700
 because of the way that we described the huge range

1:30:24.700 --> 1:30:27.000
 in which sex can be defined earlier.

1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:31.800
 So if you want to measure D2, D4 ratio, you're welcome to,

1:30:31.800 --> 1:30:33.960
 but you also have to understand

1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:36.720
 that it's not predictive of anything, right?

1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:40.000
 It's just a window into the possible androgen exposure

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:41.560
 that you had early in life.

1:30:41.560 --> 1:30:44.680
 There are plenty of men who report themselves

1:30:44.680 --> 1:30:46.360
 as heterosexual who are out there

1:30:46.360 --> 1:30:50.320
 who have similar or have D2, D4 ratios to females.

1:30:50.320 --> 1:30:52.800
 And there are plenty of females whose index fingers

1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:54.480
 are shorter than their ring fingers

1:30:54.480 --> 1:30:55.760
 and they're perfectly happy

1:30:55.760 --> 1:30:57.540
 or they say they're perfectly happy

1:30:57.540 --> 1:31:00.120
 and we are inclined to believe them being heterosexual.

1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:01.080
 So there's variation.

1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:03.080
 In fact, Mark tells a really good joke.

1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:07.240
 If you want to know whether or not somebody is homosexual

1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:10.780
 or heterosexual, simply look at their hands,

1:31:10.780 --> 1:31:15.240
 look at their D2, D4 ratio and guess heterosexual

1:31:15.240 --> 1:31:17.520
 and you'll be right 96% of the time

1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:20.560
 because 96% of the time people report themselves

1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:23.680
 as heterosexual on average, those numbers might be changing.

1:31:23.680 --> 1:31:26.120
 So the joke really is a joke on science

1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:28.420
 because that falls within the realm

1:31:28.420 --> 1:31:29.960
 of statistical significance

1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:31.820
 and yet it really illustrates the fact

1:31:31.820 --> 1:31:33.800
 that none of this is causal,

1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:35.600
 but it's nonetheless very interesting

1:31:35.600 --> 1:31:37.840
 because it means that hormones are organizing

1:31:37.840 --> 1:31:39.280
 the brain early in development

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:42.840
 in ways that can potentially impact same

1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:45.940
 or opposite sex partner choice later in life.

1:31:45.940 --> 1:31:47.080
 Now, of course, there are other things

1:31:47.080 --> 1:31:48.800
 that can impact opposite sex

1:31:48.800 --> 1:31:51.200
 or same sex partner choice later in life.

1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:54.600
 The study did not look at people who reported bisexual.

1:31:54.600 --> 1:31:57.760
 There hasn't been a lot of studies on that yet.

1:31:57.760 --> 1:31:59.400
 One thing that's very interesting

1:31:59.400 --> 1:32:01.960
 for which there are some good scientific data

1:32:01.960 --> 1:32:03.720
 but there's also some controversy

1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:07.600
 is that it appears that the probability

1:32:07.600 --> 1:32:11.840
 of a male human self-reporting as homosexual

1:32:11.840 --> 1:32:16.400
 increases with the number of older brothers that he has.

1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:18.240
 Now, that doesn't mean if you have an older brother

1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:19.800
 even if you have 10 older brothers

1:32:19.800 --> 1:32:22.860
 that you are sure to self-report as homosexual,

1:32:22.860 --> 1:32:26.840
 but statistically it becomes more likely

1:32:26.840 --> 1:32:30.360
 that somebody will with each successive older brother

1:32:30.360 --> 1:32:31.520
 that they have.

1:32:31.520 --> 1:32:33.160
 And the idea that's starting to emerge

1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:37.120
 in the developmental neuroendocrinology landscape

1:32:37.120 --> 1:32:41.120
 is that there's a record within the mother

1:32:41.120 --> 1:32:43.400
 of how many male fetuses she's carried

1:32:43.400 --> 1:32:46.360
 because male fetuses are secreting certain things,

1:32:46.360 --> 1:32:48.680
 dihydrotestosterone, other things

1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:51.840
 that can feed back onto the genome.

1:32:51.840 --> 1:32:53.360
 So these could be epigenomic effects

1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:55.700
 or onto the placenta itself

1:32:55.700 --> 1:32:57.640
 so that there's a higher probability

1:32:57.640 --> 1:32:59.480
 in subsequent pregnancies

1:32:59.480 --> 1:33:02.880
 that offspring will self-report as homosexual.

1:33:02.880 --> 1:33:05.040
 So it's a fascinating area of biology.

1:33:05.040 --> 1:33:06.500
 And as you've noticed today,

1:33:06.500 --> 1:33:09.680
 none of this deals with the current controversies

1:33:09.680 --> 1:33:12.980
 around gender and how many genders and sex, et cetera.

1:33:12.980 --> 1:33:16.460
 That's a separate conversation that is by definition

1:33:16.460 --> 1:33:18.260
 grounded in the kind of concepts

1:33:18.260 --> 1:33:19.680
 we've been talking about today

1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:22.760
 and needs to take place taking into consideration

1:33:22.760 --> 1:33:26.200
 all of the aspects of sex and the effects of hormones

1:33:26.200 --> 1:33:28.560
 both on the body, on the brain.

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:30.000
 We didn't talk a lot about spinal cord

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:32.120
 but we will in the next episode

1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:34.720
 but we can just say on the brain and the periphery

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:38.080
 early effects, late effects, acute effects

1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:40.160
 meaning effects that are very fast

1:33:40.160 --> 1:33:42.240
 of levels of hormones going up or down

1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:43.700
 something that absolutely happens

1:33:43.700 --> 1:33:46.340
 during and across the menstrual cycle

1:33:46.340 --> 1:33:47.920
 as well as long-term effects

1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:51.680
 like the effects of these hormones on gene expression.

1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:55.480
 So today, as always, we weren't able to cover

1:33:55.480 --> 1:33:59.640
 all things related to sex and hormones

1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:02.820
 and sexual differentiation or development.

1:34:02.820 --> 1:34:04.120
 There's no way we could

1:34:04.120 --> 1:34:06.320
 but we have covered a lot of material.

1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:10.360
 We talked about some effects of environmental toxins.

1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:12.920
 We talked about potential effects of cell phone radiation

1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:15.720
 something I never thought that I would be talking about

1:34:15.720 --> 1:34:17.380
 especially not in a podcast

1:34:17.380 --> 1:34:19.420
 but for which there are interesting emerging data.

1:34:19.420 --> 1:34:23.340
 We talked about considerations about evening primrose oil

1:34:23.340 --> 1:34:25.460
 and its estrogenic effects, about creatine

1:34:25.460 --> 1:34:29.140
 and its pro DHT effects, about cannabis alcohol

1:34:29.140 --> 1:34:31.760
 about plants exerting warfare on animals

1:34:31.760 --> 1:34:33.160
 by increasing aromatase

1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:35.160
 the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.

1:34:35.160 --> 1:34:37.360
 We talked about hyenas with giant clitorises

1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:40.200
 and we talked about moles that can convert

1:34:40.200 --> 1:34:43.520
 from having ovaries to testicles.

1:34:43.520 --> 1:34:46.480
 And throughout this Costello has been snoring nonstop.

1:34:46.480 --> 1:34:48.000
 He missed all of it

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.300
 although he might be learning it in his sleep

1:34:50.300 --> 1:34:51.840
 for all I know.

1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:54.960
 And I do understand it's a lot of information

1:34:54.960 --> 1:34:57.320
 a lot of detail as always, I just want to remind you

1:34:57.320 --> 1:35:00.040
 you don't have to absorb all the information at once.

1:35:00.040 --> 1:35:02.640
 Next episode, we are going to be talking about

1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:06.720
 the science of sex, the verb, actual reproduction.

1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:09.480
 We're also going to be talking about effects of hormones

1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:11.700
 on various aspects of behavior

1:35:11.700 --> 1:35:14.160
 and ways to modulate hormones

1:35:14.160 --> 1:35:19.160
 through the use of behavior, supplementation.

1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:22.040
 Also, we'll touch on diet and nutrition a bit.

1:35:22.040 --> 1:35:24.040
 And we're going to talk about interactions

1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:26.120
 between those things and behavior

1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:28.240
 as they relate to important themes

1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:32.280
 like sex and reproduction, like workplace performance

1:35:32.280 --> 1:35:34.860
 like motivation and drive, and even anxiety.

1:35:34.860 --> 1:35:36.840
 There's a very interesting relationship

1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:39.200
 between hormones and anxiety

1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:42.400
 and the desire to explore novelty.

1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:44.240
 So just remember as we go forward

1:35:44.240 --> 1:35:46.400
 that hormones affect behavior

1:35:46.400 --> 1:35:48.760
 and behavior affects hormones

1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:51.000
 but that doesn't mean that cutting off your index finger

1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.120
 will increase your testosterone.

1:35:53.120 --> 1:35:55.920
 Many of you have asked how you can help support the podcast

1:35:55.920 --> 1:35:57.700
 and we thank you for the question.

1:35:57.700 --> 1:35:59.020
 There are several ways to do that.

1:35:59.020 --> 1:36:01.080
 The first one is to subscribe on YouTube.

1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:03.040
 If you haven't subscribed to the YouTube channel already

1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:04.280
 please do so.

1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:06.040
 As well, please hit the subscribe button

1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:08.400
 so you're sure not to miss any of the episodes.

1:36:08.400 --> 1:36:10.520
 We do release episodes every Monday

1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:14.400
 but we also occasionally release short clips in between.

1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:17.720
 As well, if you could subscribe on Apple and or Spotify

1:36:17.720 --> 1:36:18.800
 that's very helpful.

1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:20.960
 And on Apple, you have the opportunity to leave us

1:36:20.960 --> 1:36:24.360
 up to a five-star review and to leave a comment.

1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:27.240
 On YouTube, please do leave us comments and suggestions

1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:28.560
 for future episodes.

1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:30.100
 We really appreciate the feedback

1:36:30.100 --> 1:36:32.200
 and we appreciate those suggestions.

1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:35.120
 Also ask us any questions you have about the material.

1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:37.780
 Those questions help guide our office hours,

1:36:37.780 --> 1:36:39.440
 this discussion about your questions

1:36:39.440 --> 1:36:40.840
 that we hold from time to time

1:36:40.840 --> 1:36:43.420
 as well as inform future content.

1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:45.500
 Also, if you could tell people about the podcast

1:36:45.500 --> 1:36:48.040
 please tell your family, your friends, your coworkers

1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:50.460
 anyone that you think might benefit from the material.

1:36:50.460 --> 1:36:52.700
 That really helps us get the word out.

1:36:52.700 --> 1:36:55.180
 As well, if you're interested in supplements

1:36:55.180 --> 1:36:58.860
 we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

1:36:58.860 --> 1:36:59.940
 And we've partnered with Thorne

1:36:59.940 --> 1:37:02.400
 because Thorne has the highest level of stringency

1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:04.120
 with respect to the ingredients

1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:05.800
 that they put in their products

1:37:05.800 --> 1:37:09.480
 as well as the precise amounts of those contents.

1:37:09.480 --> 1:37:10.840
 A lot of supplement brands out there

1:37:10.840 --> 1:37:13.480
 claim to have X amount of some supplement

1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:15.520
 but then when people have measured

1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:17.000
 the amount in capsules and tablets

1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:18.120
 it's turned out to be very different.

1:37:18.120 --> 1:37:19.520
 Thorne is very precise about this.

1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:23.160
 They partnered with important and stringent institutions

1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:25.260
 like the Mayo Clinic, all the major sports teams.

1:37:25.260 --> 1:37:27.300
 So that's why we partnered with Thorne.

1:37:27.300 --> 1:37:29.160
 If you want to try any of Thorne's products

1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:31.380
 if you want to see what I take, you can go to Thorne

1:37:31.380 --> 1:37:36.380
 that's thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:37.600
 And if you do that

1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:39.080
 you can see any of the products that I take

1:37:39.080 --> 1:37:41.500
 you can get 20% off any of those

1:37:41.500 --> 1:37:43.800
 as well as 20% off any of the other products

1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:45.040
 that Thorne makes.

1:37:45.040 --> 1:37:48.720
 So that's thorne.com slash U slash Huberman.

1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:50.440
 Please also check out our sponsors

1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:51.680
 check out the sponsor links.

1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:54.400
 That's perhaps the best way to support us.

1:37:54.400 --> 1:37:56.060
 And of course, I want to point out

1:37:56.060 --> 1:37:58.160
 that any of the ways that support us

1:37:58.160 --> 1:37:59.440
 whether or not they are cost-free

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:00.940
 like subscribing and leaving comments

1:38:00.940 --> 1:38:03.200
 or whether or not you're interested in the products

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:05.840
 that I've referred to, those all help us.

1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:07.880
 And so we really appreciate it.

1:38:07.880 --> 1:38:09.520
 So once again, I want to thank you

1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:12.140
 for embarking on this journey through neuroscience

1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:15.160
 and today neuroendocrinology with me.

1:38:15.160 --> 1:38:17.800
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:38:17.800 --> 1:38:19.720
 I'll see you next time.
