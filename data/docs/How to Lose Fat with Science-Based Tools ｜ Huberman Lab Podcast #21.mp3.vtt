00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.880
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.880 --> 00:13.680
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.680 --> 00:15.660
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.660 --> 00:17.460
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.460 --> 00:19.280
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.280 --> 00:21.560
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.560 --> 00:23.680
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.680 --> 00:25.960
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.960 --> 00:27.760
 to the general public.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.020
 In keeping with that theme,

00:29.020 --> 00:32.240
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:32.240 --> 00:35.040
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

00:35.040 --> 00:37.840
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

00:37.840 --> 00:40.500
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:40.500 --> 00:42.200
 to help you better understand your body

00:42.200 --> 00:44.600
 and help you reach your health goals.

00:44.600 --> 00:47.680
 I've been getting my blood work done for many years now,

00:47.680 --> 00:49.100
 and that's for the simple reason

00:49.100 --> 00:51.980
 that only through quality blood work,

00:51.980 --> 00:54.320
 and now through the advent of DNA tests,

00:54.320 --> 00:56.120
 can one really get a clear picture

00:56.120 --> 00:58.080
 of what's going on with their health.

00:58.080 --> 01:01.000
 Things like metabolic factors and hormones,

01:01.000 --> 01:02.860
 all the various triglycerides,

01:02.860 --> 01:04.580
 these are things that can only be measured

01:04.580 --> 01:06.280
 from a quality blood test.

01:06.280 --> 01:07.520
 And now with DNA tests,

01:07.520 --> 01:09.220
 you can get an additional window

01:09.220 --> 01:10.860
 into your current health status

01:10.860 --> 01:12.840
 and the trajectory of your health.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.060
 What's really wonderful about Inside Tracker

01:15.060 --> 01:17.160
 is that you don't just get numbers back

01:17.160 --> 01:19.600
 about the specific levels of various hormones

01:19.600 --> 01:20.880
 and metabolic factors.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.320
 You also get a lot of information

01:22.320 --> 01:24.120
 about what you could or should do

01:24.120 --> 01:25.960
 in order to adjust those numbers

01:25.960 --> 01:28.500
 to put you on the course to better health.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.900
 So for instance, it will give recommendations

01:30.900 --> 01:33.520
 about particular foods to eat or avoid,

01:33.520 --> 01:37.000
 particular exercise regimens that you might want to adopt

01:37.000 --> 01:38.560
 and the frequency of those regimens

01:38.560 --> 01:41.760
 in order to move those markers in the correct direction.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.500
 Inside Tracker has also added a new feature

01:45.500 --> 01:47.840
 that makes tracking your progress

01:47.840 --> 01:50.240
 and analyzing your data even easier.

01:50.240 --> 01:52.640
 For those of you that use a Garmin fitness tracker

01:52.640 --> 01:54.160
 such as the Garmin watch,

01:54.160 --> 01:56.220
 that's now compatible with their platform.

01:56.220 --> 01:58.040
 So you can couple your data from your Garmin

01:58.040 --> 02:00.600
 with your blood and DNA for even more personalization

02:00.600 --> 02:01.940
 and insights on your health.

02:01.940 --> 02:03.960
 However, if you don't have a Garmin device,

02:03.960 --> 02:05.640
 there's still a lot that you can get

02:05.640 --> 02:07.820
 from Inside Tracker and their tests.

02:07.820 --> 02:09.360
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

02:09.360 --> 02:12.440

02:26.880 --> 02:30.760
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by ExpressVPN.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.140
 ExpressVPN is a virtual private network

02:33.140 --> 02:35.700
 that keeps your data secure and private.

02:35.700 --> 02:37.900
 It does that by routing your internet activity

02:37.900 --> 02:39.780
 through their servers and encrypting it

02:39.780 --> 02:42.680
 so that no one can see or sell your data.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.000
 I'm familiar with the effects

02:44.000 --> 02:46.100
 of not securing my data well enough.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.040
 A few years back, I had my bank accounts hacked.

02:49.040 --> 02:51.080
 I don't know exactly how it happened,

02:51.080 --> 02:54.440
 but it happened and it was a terrible amount of work

02:54.440 --> 02:56.700
 to have that reversed and secured.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.380
 The great thing about ExpressVPN

02:58.380 --> 03:00.360
 is I don't even notice that it's running.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.300
 I have it on my computer.

03:01.300 --> 03:04.600
 I turn it on anytime I work at home or when traveling

03:04.600 --> 03:06.760
 or in a cafe, airport, anywhere.

03:06.760 --> 03:07.960
 And it runs in the background.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.800
 It doesn't change anything about the interface

03:09.800 --> 03:11.840
 with my computer or the wifi.

03:11.840 --> 03:15.640
 It just secures my data and it secures any information

03:15.640 --> 03:18.240
 about what I happen to be searching for, et cetera.

03:18.240 --> 03:20.320
 I don't feel like I have anything particular to hide

03:20.320 --> 03:23.400
 except my bank account passwords and things of that sort.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.440
 But with ExpressVPN, it basically makes everything secure.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.920
 You can't be tracked and no one can access

03:28.920 --> 03:30.800
 or steal your data, which is terrific.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.740
 So again, I use it when I'm traveling and when I'm at home.

03:34.840 --> 03:36.980
 If you want to start protecting your internet activity

03:36.980 --> 03:41.980
 using ExpressVPN, you can go to expressvpn.com slash Huberman

03:42.120 --> 03:44.560
 and you'll get an extra three months free

03:44.560 --> 03:45.760
 on a one-year package.

03:45.760 --> 03:49.400
 That's expressvpn.com slash Huberman

03:49.400 --> 03:53.280
 to get three months free on any of their one-year packages.

03:53.280 --> 03:56.680
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.480
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

03:58.480 --> 04:01.060
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink

04:01.060 --> 04:04.200
 that gives you a total foundation of vitamins and minerals

04:04.200 --> 04:07.080
 and probiotics to support your health and wellbeing.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.320
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012.

04:10.320 --> 04:13.000
 And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.720
 I started using Athletic Greens

04:14.720 --> 04:17.680
 and I still use Athletic Greens once or twice a day

04:17.680 --> 04:20.520
 because it's the simplest and most straightforward way

04:20.520 --> 04:24.240
 to get my basis of important vitamins, minerals

04:24.240 --> 04:26.240
 and probiotics taken care of.

04:26.240 --> 04:29.280
 All of those things combined to support various aspects

04:29.280 --> 04:33.000
 of my health, such as brain health, such as gut health.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.440
 For instance, there's a tremendous amount of evidence now

04:35.440 --> 04:37.760
 showing that probiotics support gut health

04:37.760 --> 04:39.760
 and that the gut brain access is important

04:39.760 --> 04:42.080
 for things like focus and cognition,

04:42.080 --> 04:44.160
 as well as for immune function

04:44.160 --> 04:46.920
 and various aspects of physical health like metabolism.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.140
 The list sort of goes on and on.

04:49.140 --> 04:52.160
 With Athletic Greens, it has all these vitamins and minerals

04:52.160 --> 04:54.520
 and various other things that are good for me.

04:54.520 --> 04:56.400
 And I actually really liked the way it tastes.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.720
 So the way I use it is once a day, sometimes twice a day,

04:59.720 --> 05:00.760
 I'll mix it up with water.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.880
 I add a little bit of lemon or lime juice.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.880
 I think it tastes great without the lemon or lime juice.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.580
 But when I add that, it's truly delicious to me.

05:07.580 --> 05:10.400
 And I'll drink that first thing in the day,

05:10.400 --> 05:12.020
 mid-morning sometimes instead.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.240
 And sometimes again in the later afternoon.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.400
 I'm able to drink Athletic Greens late in the day

05:16.400 --> 05:18.600
 and not have it keep me awake.

05:18.600 --> 05:20.320
 If you want to try Athletic Greens,

05:20.320 --> 05:23.200
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

05:23.200 --> 05:25.880
 And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.

05:25.880 --> 05:27.800
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

05:27.800 --> 05:29.560
 which make mixing up Athletic Greens

05:29.560 --> 05:31.980
 while you're on the road really simple and easy.

05:31.980 --> 05:35.740
 And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:35.740 --> 05:39.280
 Vitamin D3, as many of you know, you can get from the sun,

05:39.280 --> 05:40.120
 but many people,

05:40.120 --> 05:42.680
 even if they're already getting a lot of sun exposure,

05:42.680 --> 05:46.080
 still have vitamin D3 levels that are too low.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.940
 And vitamin D3 is very important for a huge number

05:48.940 --> 05:51.360
 of cardiovascular, immune, metabolic,

05:51.360 --> 05:53.140
 and other aspects of health.

05:53.140 --> 05:56.360
 So once again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:56.360 --> 05:58.180
 you'll get the five free travel packs

05:58.180 --> 06:01.700
 and a year supply of vitamin D3 and K2.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.580
 Today is the third episode in our series of episodes

06:04.580 --> 06:08.040
 about physical and athletic skill performance

06:08.040 --> 06:10.200
 and skill learning in general.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.880
 And today we're going to talk about the science

06:12.880 --> 06:15.540
 of tools for fat loss.

06:15.540 --> 06:17.800
 And fat loss is something that interests

06:17.800 --> 06:19.600
 a large number of people.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.440
 Many people want to lose fat.

06:21.440 --> 06:25.260
 Many people are athletes who need to lose fat.

06:25.260 --> 06:28.840
 And in general, we know that having body fat percentages

06:28.840 --> 06:31.560
 that are too high is unhealthy for us.

06:31.560 --> 06:34.520
 And most people struggle to lose fat.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.560
 Most people struggle to lose weight generally,

06:36.560 --> 06:40.040
 but most people especially struggle to lose body fat

06:40.040 --> 06:42.440
 or what we call adipose tissue.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.840
 Now, this is a huge topic on the internet.

06:44.840 --> 06:46.840
 There's a lot of controversy.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.680
 Today we're going to talk about some things related

06:49.680 --> 06:52.760
 to fat loss and that are powerful for fat loss

06:52.760 --> 06:56.680
 that I'm guessing most of you have never heard about before.

06:57.540 --> 06:58.840
 You may have heard about a few of them,

06:58.840 --> 07:01.200
 but I'm guessing you haven't heard about all of them.

07:01.200 --> 07:05.320
 This episode is going to be rich with science-based tools

07:05.320 --> 07:07.760
 that are gleaned from a variety of aspects

07:07.760 --> 07:10.740
 of the literature, including the use of cold,

07:10.740 --> 07:14.480
 including brown fat, including something called beige fat.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.540
 We're going to talk about something called neat.

07:16.540 --> 07:19.720
 We're going to talk about all sorts of aspects of fat loss

07:19.720 --> 07:22.440
 that are governed by your nervous system.

07:22.440 --> 07:25.360
 And this is, I think, an important gap that's missing

07:25.360 --> 07:27.540
 in the discussion about fat loss.

07:27.540 --> 07:29.960
 You can hear a lot of information out there

07:29.960 --> 07:33.320
 about the role of things like insulin and various diets

07:33.320 --> 07:37.400
 like ketogenic diets or vegan diets or Mediterranean diets.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.100
 And there's some great stuff out there

07:39.100 --> 07:40.980
 and there's some really terrible information out there

07:40.980 --> 07:42.880
 and there's a lot of controversy.

07:42.880 --> 07:45.500
 We did a number of episodes talking about

07:45.500 --> 07:48.180
 the role of hormones on metabolism

07:48.180 --> 07:52.560
 and the role of food on mood and wellbeing.

07:52.560 --> 07:54.280
 So if you're interested in those topics,

07:54.280 --> 07:55.580
 please check them out.

07:55.580 --> 07:58.240
 I will touch a little bit on hormones today,

07:58.240 --> 08:02.200
 things like insulin and leptin, just a little bit,

08:02.200 --> 08:05.240
 but today's episode is mainly going to be focused on

08:05.240 --> 08:07.760
 how the nervous system, neurons,

08:07.760 --> 08:10.040
 and some of the cells they collaborate with

08:10.040 --> 08:12.260
 like glia and macrophages,

08:12.260 --> 08:17.080
 how those encourage or can encourage accelerated fat loss

08:17.080 --> 08:18.600
 because it turns out they can.

08:18.600 --> 08:19.800
 Remember your nervous system,

08:19.800 --> 08:22.260
 which includes your brain and your spinal cord

08:22.260 --> 08:24.160
 and all the connections that they make

08:24.160 --> 08:27.820
 with the organs of the body, governs everything.

08:27.820 --> 08:31.800
 It's the on switch and the off switch for your immune system.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.520
 It's the on switch and the off switch,

08:33.520 --> 08:35.640
 it turns out also for fat burning.

08:35.640 --> 08:38.840
 And so the nervous system and the role of the brain

08:38.840 --> 08:42.320
 and other neurons has been vastly overlooked

08:42.320 --> 08:44.800
 in the discussion about losing fat.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.400
 Now, I would be remiss,

08:46.400 --> 08:48.720
 and I'd probably come under a pretty considerable attack

08:48.720 --> 08:51.080
 if I didn't just acknowledge upfront

08:51.080 --> 08:54.940
 a core truth of metabolic science

08:54.940 --> 08:57.120
 and also of neuroscience, frankly,

08:57.120 --> 09:00.440
 which is that calories in versus calories out,

09:00.440 --> 09:02.720
 meaning how many calories you ingest

09:02.720 --> 09:04.680
 versus how many calories you burn,

09:04.680 --> 09:07.560
 is the fundamental and most important formula

09:07.560 --> 09:09.440
 in this business of fat loss

09:09.440 --> 09:12.260
 and weight management in general.

09:12.260 --> 09:14.220
 There's simply no way around the fact

09:14.220 --> 09:18.440
 that if you ingest far more calories than you burn,

09:18.440 --> 09:20.840
 you're likely to gain weight.

09:20.840 --> 09:22.360
 And a good portion of that weight

09:22.360 --> 09:26.080
 is likely to be adipose tissue, fat.

09:26.080 --> 09:28.620
 It's also true that if you ingest fewer calories

09:28.620 --> 09:30.440
 than you burn, that you will lose weight

09:30.440 --> 09:32.080
 and that a significant portion of that

09:32.080 --> 09:33.640
 will come from body fat.

09:33.640 --> 09:34.480
 What portion?

09:34.480 --> 09:36.040
 Depends on the number of factors.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.180
 But that simple formula is important.

09:39.180 --> 09:42.080
 On a previous episode, I mentioned the complications

09:42.080 --> 09:45.120
 with the statement of a calorie is a calorie.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.000
 And indeed, there is evidence from, for instance,

09:48.000 --> 09:51.260
 Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist

09:51.260 --> 09:53.200
 at UC San Francisco,

09:53.200 --> 09:55.240
 has talked about how highly processed foods

09:55.240 --> 09:57.780
 change the way that we utilize food

09:57.780 --> 10:02.080
 and can lead to higher incidences of obesity

10:02.080 --> 10:04.300
 and other metabolic syndromes

10:04.300 --> 10:06.160
 that go against the idea

10:06.160 --> 10:08.120
 that a calorie is a calorie and that's it.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.920
 So a calorie is a calorie as a unit of energy,

10:11.920 --> 10:16.800
 and we need to accept and acknowledge this calories in,

10:16.800 --> 10:20.160
 meaning calories ingested versus calories burned formula,

10:20.160 --> 10:24.840
 but the calories burned portion is strongly influenced

10:24.840 --> 10:27.800
 by a number of things that you can control

10:27.800 --> 10:29.960
 that can greatly accelerate

10:29.960 --> 10:32.840
 or increase the amount of adipose tissue

10:32.840 --> 10:34.760
 or the proportion of adipose tissue

10:34.760 --> 10:37.840
 that you burn in response to exercise and food.

10:37.840 --> 10:40.160
 So your hormones are important.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.360
 Your thermogenic milieu, meaning how warm

10:45.360 --> 10:47.560
 or how cold your body is,

10:47.560 --> 10:49.220
 how cold you make it, how warm you make it,

10:49.220 --> 10:51.160
 but also your level of metabolism,

10:51.160 --> 10:53.160
 your levels of thyroid hormone,

10:53.160 --> 10:56.880
 and something that's hardly ever discussed,

10:56.880 --> 11:00.280
 but is well supported by the scientific literature,

11:00.280 --> 11:02.000
 how much innervation,

11:02.000 --> 11:04.200
 meaning how much connectivity there is

11:04.200 --> 11:06.780
 between your nervous system and fat.

11:06.780 --> 11:09.300
 Today, we're going to talk about the fact

11:09.300 --> 11:12.140
 that your body fat of various kinds,

11:12.140 --> 11:14.480
 and there are several kinds of body fat,

11:14.480 --> 11:16.680
 are actually innervated by neurons.

11:16.680 --> 11:18.480
 Neurons connect to your body fat

11:18.480 --> 11:20.680
 and can change the probability

11:20.680 --> 11:23.200
 that that body fat will be burned or not.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.240
 So your nervous system

11:24.240 --> 11:26.800
 is the master controller of this process,

11:26.800 --> 11:30.200
 and it plays a strong role in the calories out,

11:30.200 --> 11:32.180
 the calories burned component.

11:32.180 --> 11:35.800
 So as usual, we're going to discuss a little bit of science.

11:35.800 --> 11:39.020
 I promise I won't go too deep into lipolysis

11:39.020 --> 11:41.720
 and all sorts of things related to fat oxidation.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.700
 We're going to break down that process

11:43.700 --> 11:45.960
 into two important steps.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.380
 And if you can understand those two important steps,

11:48.380 --> 11:51.440
 then the rest of the tools will be very straightforward

11:51.440 --> 11:53.480
 to understand and manage.

11:53.480 --> 11:57.200
 And I do believe that today you will walk away

11:57.200 --> 11:59.820
 with many new tools that you could incorporate

11:59.820 --> 12:02.160
 into any kind of fat loss regimen

12:02.160 --> 12:04.520
 that will greatly accelerate that process

12:04.520 --> 12:07.440
 because it's grounded in quality peer-reviewed science.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.460
 Throughout the episode,

12:09.460 --> 12:11.940
 I'm going to talk about some behavioral tools.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.380
 In fact, I'll mostly talk about behavioral tools.

12:14.380 --> 12:17.460
 I will also talk about compounds, supplements.

12:17.460 --> 12:19.400
 Many of you are into supplements,

12:19.400 --> 12:21.180
 some of you aren't, and that's fine.

12:21.180 --> 12:23.160
 For those of you that are into supplements,

12:23.160 --> 12:26.320
 an important issue in a discussion about supplements

12:26.320 --> 12:28.120
 for fat loss or otherwise

12:28.120 --> 12:30.420
 is going to be the quality of those supplements

12:30.420 --> 12:33.640
 and the accuracy about what's in those supplement bottles

12:33.640 --> 12:35.600
 and tablets, et cetera.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.580
 I usually mention this at the end of the podcast,

12:37.580 --> 12:40.720
 but this podcast, we've partnered with Thorne,

12:40.720 --> 12:43.360
 T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne, we believe,

12:43.360 --> 12:45.120
 has the highest levels of stringency

12:45.120 --> 12:47.640
 in terms of the quality of the compounds

12:47.640 --> 12:50.300
 in their supplements and the amounts of those compounds.

12:50.300 --> 12:52.040
 If you want to see the supplements I take,

12:52.040 --> 12:56.400
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.120
 You can see the supplements that I take.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.040
 That will also allow you to get 20% off

13:00.040 --> 13:01.200
 any of those supplements

13:01.200 --> 13:05.600
 or 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.560
 Thorne has partnered with the Mayo Clinic

13:07.560 --> 13:09.260
 and all the major sports teams,

13:09.260 --> 13:13.040
 so there's a very strong basis for their stringency.

13:13.040 --> 13:15.240
 Again, you don't need to use supplements.

13:15.240 --> 13:17.760
 I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to use supplements

13:17.760 --> 13:19.180
 if that's not your thing,

13:19.180 --> 13:20.520
 but if you're going to use supplements,

13:20.520 --> 13:21.920
 make sure that your supplement source

13:21.920 --> 13:24.140
 is one of very high quality.

13:24.140 --> 13:25.880
 With that said, I want to get started

13:25.880 --> 13:28.820
 and talk about the various tools for fat loss

13:28.820 --> 13:32.440
 and how neuroscience, neurons, control fat loss.

13:33.560 --> 13:37.240
 Before I do that, I want to set the context correctly

13:37.240 --> 13:39.600
 and extract some of the key takeaways

13:39.600 --> 13:41.300
 from previous episodes,

13:41.300 --> 13:44.120
 because if your foundation of health

13:44.120 --> 13:45.760
 and your foundation of hormones

13:45.760 --> 13:48.480
 and your foundation of metabolism isn't right,

13:48.480 --> 13:50.800
 it's going to be very hard to get the most

13:50.800 --> 13:53.820
 out of any kind of exercise or fat loss protocol.

13:53.820 --> 13:57.580
 In previous episodes, I talked all about the science

13:57.580 --> 14:00.260
 and the details going into particular protocols.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.560
 We don't have time to do that now,

14:02.560 --> 14:04.240
 and I want to get to the new material.

14:04.240 --> 14:05.960
 However, there are a couple bins,

14:05.960 --> 14:08.080
 a couple items that you should make sure

14:08.080 --> 14:09.520
 you're getting correctly,

14:09.520 --> 14:10.960
 and if you're not perfect about these,

14:10.960 --> 14:11.860
 don't worry about it.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.460
 Most people are not perfect about them.

14:13.460 --> 14:15.340
 I'm certainly not perfect about them,

14:15.340 --> 14:18.760
 but we should all be striving to get quality

14:18.760 --> 14:20.260
 and sufficient sleep.

14:20.260 --> 14:22.180
 I did four full episodes on sleep

14:22.180 --> 14:23.940
 and how to get better at sleeping

14:23.940 --> 14:26.820
 through things like light exposure, temperature,

14:26.820 --> 14:29.740
 timing your sleep correctly for your so-called chronotype

14:29.740 --> 14:32.180
 if you're a night owl or a morning person.

14:32.180 --> 14:35.120
 That's the first four or I think five episodes

14:35.120 --> 14:36.760
 of the Huberman Lab podcast.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.660
 Get your sleep right, get your light exposure right,

14:39.660 --> 14:41.460
 avoid bright light in your eyes

14:41.460 --> 14:43.440
 at times you want to be asleep,

14:43.440 --> 14:45.280
 and get bright light in your eyes

14:45.280 --> 14:46.940
 at times you want to be awake.

14:46.940 --> 14:48.540
 So get your sleep right.

14:48.540 --> 14:50.900
 The other thing is essential fatty acids.

14:50.900 --> 14:54.660
 I talked about this in the food and mood episode,

14:54.660 --> 14:58.640
 but I also talked about it during the hormones episodes.

14:58.640 --> 15:00.120
 We need fatty acids.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.920
 They are vital to so many aspects of our health.

15:02.920 --> 15:04.680
 You don't have to get them from supplements.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.580
 You can if you want to,

15:05.580 --> 15:07.380
 but you need to get them from your food.

15:07.380 --> 15:08.620
 They are essential.

15:08.620 --> 15:11.940
 There's a reason there's an E, the essential part there.

15:11.940 --> 15:14.460
 Of the fatty acids, there are multiple kinds,

15:14.460 --> 15:17.140
 but for the antidepressant effects

15:17.140 --> 15:21.220
 or the levels of fatty acids that will promote good mood

15:21.220 --> 15:23.140
 and also healthy metabolism

15:23.140 --> 15:25.540
 and will start to shift the needle in the right direction

15:25.540 --> 15:28.900
 on bloodborne cardiovascular factors,

15:28.900 --> 15:33.060
 the key thing is to get the levels of EPA that you ingest

15:33.060 --> 15:35.600
 above 1,000 milligrams per day.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.440
 So that doesn't mean just taking 1,000 milligrams or more

15:38.440 --> 15:40.620
 of say fish oil or krill oil

15:40.620 --> 15:42.520
 or whatever your preferred source is.

15:42.520 --> 15:46.140
 It means getting above 1,000 milligrams of EPA,

15:46.140 --> 15:49.500
 which may require that you ingest more essential fatty acids

15:49.500 --> 15:52.500
 than just 1,000 milligrams per day.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.660
 That of course can be done through food sources,

15:55.660 --> 15:56.980
 things like fatty fish,

15:56.980 --> 15:59.460
 or if you're not into eating fish,

15:59.460 --> 16:01.940
 you have quality meats that are grass-raised can do that.

16:01.940 --> 16:04.260
 There are other sources of essential fatty acids,

16:04.260 --> 16:05.700
 of course, also from plant sources.

16:05.700 --> 16:07.020
 So look those up online.

16:07.020 --> 16:08.300
 It's really easy to find,

16:08.300 --> 16:10.340
 but the research and the literature shows

16:10.340 --> 16:14.820
 that you want to get above 1,000 milligrams of EPA per day

16:14.820 --> 16:18.360
 because that's when you can best support your metabolism

16:18.360 --> 16:21.820
 and position yourself for good fat loss.

16:21.820 --> 16:24.700
 As well, for people who have cravings issues,

16:24.700 --> 16:26.420
 they crave sweets all the time.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.980
 I talked about this in the gut brain episode

16:28.980 --> 16:30.260
 and hormones and food,

16:30.260 --> 16:32.220
 that you have neurons in your gut that are craving,

16:32.220 --> 16:34.300
 they're seeking essential fatty acids

16:34.300 --> 16:38.340
 and they're craving and seeking amino acids from your food.

16:38.340 --> 16:41.160
 Now, these are not supplements that they crave per se,

16:41.160 --> 16:42.400
 they're craving those things

16:42.400 --> 16:45.080
 because that's what your body needs and your brain needs.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.300
 But those same neurons will respond to sugars.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.860
 And so many people who are craving sugar

16:49.860 --> 16:52.340
 can satisfy that sugar craving

16:52.340 --> 16:55.680
 by giving the neurons, so to speak, what they actually want,

16:55.680 --> 16:59.240
 which are amino acids and essential fatty acids.

16:59.240 --> 17:01.660
 That includes EPA, but also things like glutamine,

17:01.660 --> 17:04.700
 an amino acid that can really reduce sugar cravings

17:04.700 --> 17:06.100
 if you take a teaspoon of that

17:06.100 --> 17:09.260
 or even a tablespoon of that a few times a day.

17:09.260 --> 17:10.580
 You have to ease into that a little bit

17:10.580 --> 17:12.720
 because some people can get a little bit of GI distress

17:12.720 --> 17:14.120
 from too much glutamine.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.460
 But glutamine has also been shown

17:16.460 --> 17:18.460
 to improve symptoms of leaky gut.

17:18.460 --> 17:20.300
 It's a powerful amino acid.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.220
 And yes, you can also get it from food.

17:22.220 --> 17:25.100
 Things like cottage cheese are high in glutamine, et cetera.

17:25.100 --> 17:28.840
 And then finally, you can't really position yourself

17:28.840 --> 17:31.220
 to have a strong metabolism

17:31.220 --> 17:33.180
 if your iodine levels aren't correct

17:33.180 --> 17:35.380
 and your thyroid levels aren't correct.

17:35.380 --> 17:38.280
 You can overdo iodine, so you don't want to do that.

17:38.280 --> 17:41.860
 A lot of table salt has iodine added to it,

17:41.860 --> 17:44.700
 but some people need to add iodine

17:44.700 --> 17:46.640
 by ingesting things like kelp, et cetera.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.020
 But one of the best ways to support the thyroid system

17:49.020 --> 17:50.280
 and metabolism in general

17:50.280 --> 17:52.180
 is to make sure you're getting enough selenium,

17:52.180 --> 17:54.180
 sometimes called selenium.

17:54.180 --> 17:55.860
 Each day, simple way to do that

17:55.860 --> 17:59.700
 is to ingest the highest concentration of selenium food

17:59.700 --> 18:01.740
 that I'm aware of, which is Brazil nuts.

18:01.740 --> 18:03.540
 One or two or three of those per day,

18:03.540 --> 18:05.980
 you'll have more than enough selenium

18:05.980 --> 18:08.420
 to meet the thyroid needs.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.900
 You don't want your selenium to be too high.

18:09.900 --> 18:11.940
 You don't want a diet too high in anything.

18:11.940 --> 18:14.940
 So again, sleep, sufficient EPAs.

18:14.940 --> 18:17.340
 Glutamine, if you have issues with leaky gut

18:17.340 --> 18:20.020
 or sugar cravings can really help.

18:20.020 --> 18:21.940
 Get your gut microbiome right.

18:21.940 --> 18:23.140
 I may have missed saying that,

18:23.140 --> 18:25.100
 but get your gut microbiome right.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.500
 That does not necessarily mean

18:26.500 --> 18:28.500
 you need to ingest probiotics.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.020
 You can if you want to,

18:30.020 --> 18:33.300
 but you can also just simply ingest a serving or two

18:33.300 --> 18:34.820
 of fermented foods per day.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.100
 That can greatly assist.

18:36.100 --> 18:37.620
 So things like sauerkraut, kimchi,

18:37.620 --> 18:40.500
 every culture has a different source

18:40.500 --> 18:42.420
 or sources of fermented foods.

18:42.420 --> 18:45.260
 Those can really help the gut microbiome.

18:45.260 --> 18:48.460
 And then make sure that your thyroid hormone is supported

18:48.460 --> 18:51.940
 through the ingestion of sufficient iodine, not too much,

18:51.940 --> 18:54.860
 and sufficient selenium, not too much.

18:54.860 --> 18:59.040
 Sleep, EPA, glutamine, fermented foods, iodine, selenium.

18:59.040 --> 19:04.040
 That sets the basis for how things like exercise, cold

19:04.040 --> 19:06.720
 and some of the compounds and other things

19:06.720 --> 19:07.780
 that we're going to talk about today

19:07.780 --> 19:10.660
 that are I'm guessing truly going to be truly new

19:10.660 --> 19:15.300
 to many of you that can really increase the burn factor

19:15.300 --> 19:19.820
 in the equation of calories in versus calories burned, okay?

19:19.820 --> 19:21.780
 So on the one hand, we have this reality

19:21.780 --> 19:24.940
 of calories in versus calories burned.

19:24.940 --> 19:26.940
 However, I would also be remiss

19:26.940 --> 19:29.140
 if I didn't mention an incredible study

19:29.140 --> 19:32.600
 that was done by my colleague, Alia Crum at Stanford.

19:32.600 --> 19:34.720
 She's a faculty member, a professor

19:34.720 --> 19:36.720
 in the psychology department.

19:36.720 --> 19:40.040
 Looking at how belief effects, just thinking,

19:40.040 --> 19:43.140
 can impact the effects of things

19:43.140 --> 19:45.460
 like exercise on weight loss.

19:45.460 --> 19:47.580
 These are just incredible results.

19:47.580 --> 19:50.380
 What they did was they took subjects

19:50.380 --> 19:54.020
 who were hotel service people that would clean the hotels

19:54.020 --> 19:57.340
 and come in and change the linens and so forth,

19:57.340 --> 19:59.220
 divide them into two groups.

19:59.220 --> 20:03.300
 One group, they were told moving around

20:03.300 --> 20:06.980
 and doing your duties for your job,

20:06.980 --> 20:09.300
 meet the standards for US guidelines

20:09.300 --> 20:11.800
 for activity and movement, et cetera.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.380
 And a basic lecture about how movement

20:14.380 --> 20:15.900
 is good for you, et cetera.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.780
 But mostly just that their daily activities

20:18.780 --> 20:22.580
 met the standards for the US.

20:22.580 --> 20:25.880
 The other group, however, was given a bunch of information

20:25.880 --> 20:30.020
 about how movement and their daily routine

20:30.020 --> 20:32.640
 was very good for cardiovascular health.

20:32.640 --> 20:34.980
 It could be good for weight loss, et cetera.

20:34.980 --> 20:37.500
 And then they tracked these subjects

20:37.500 --> 20:39.780
 over a period of many weeks.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.260
 The take-home message from this study

20:41.260 --> 20:46.020
 was that simply being told that movement is good for you

20:46.020 --> 20:47.620
 can lead to weight loss, et cetera,

20:47.620 --> 20:51.860
 led to significantly more body fat loss,

20:51.860 --> 20:54.260
 waist to hip ratio changes in the direction

20:54.260 --> 20:55.780
 that most people would want.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.600
 Essentially a slimming down, if you will.

20:58.600 --> 21:01.580
 And all sorts of other positive effects

21:01.580 --> 21:03.340
 on things like cardiovascular health,

21:03.340 --> 21:07.300
 simply by the knowledge that movement and exercise

21:07.300 --> 21:09.760
 can help various health markers.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.480
 So this is remarkable and it speaks to the power

21:12.480 --> 21:15.060
 of the nervous system and the power of belief

21:15.060 --> 21:18.760
 in governing aspects of our body and our physiology

21:18.760 --> 21:20.380
 that one would otherwise think

21:20.380 --> 21:23.180
 were outside our conscious control.

21:23.180 --> 21:26.580
 Now, of course, any of you that think scientifically,

21:26.580 --> 21:28.660
 which I imagine if you watch this podcast

21:28.660 --> 21:31.780
 or listen to this podcast is all of you by now,

21:31.780 --> 21:34.140
 probably thinking, well, maybe they just moved around more

21:34.140 --> 21:38.300
 or maybe they stood up and sat down more.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.700
 Maybe they did something else that was different.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.680
 And indeed there's a strong possibility

21:42.680 --> 21:45.660
 that they did things differently than the other group.

21:45.660 --> 21:50.660
 But the mere knowledge that exercise is good for you,

21:50.660 --> 21:53.380
 that movement is good for you shifted their behavior

21:53.380 --> 21:56.180
 and their physiology in the direction

21:56.180 --> 21:59.000
 of enhanced weight loss, fat loss, et cetera.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.860
 So how we think about a given set of activities

22:02.860 --> 22:04.780
 affects how we perform those activities

22:04.780 --> 22:08.220
 and how we think about and perform those activities

22:08.220 --> 22:10.440
 has a real effect on our physiology.

22:10.440 --> 22:12.920
 So somewhere between the hard and fast rule

22:12.920 --> 22:15.340
 that governs fat loss and weight loss,

22:15.340 --> 22:18.500
 which is if you ingest more calories than you burn,

22:18.500 --> 22:20.000
 you'll either maintain or gain weight,

22:20.000 --> 22:22.660
 typically you'll gain weight, although not always.

22:22.660 --> 22:26.100
 If you ingest about as many calories as you burn,

22:26.100 --> 22:29.140
 you maintain weight typically.

22:29.140 --> 22:31.180
 And if you ingest fewer calories than you burn,

22:31.180 --> 22:32.220
 typically you'll lose weight.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.660
 That's the kind of rule of fat loss.

22:34.660 --> 22:37.960
 And yet we also have these belief effects which show,

22:37.960 --> 22:40.060
 and this has been replicated again and again,

22:40.060 --> 22:42.080
 that how we think about a process,

22:42.080 --> 22:43.580
 whether or not we think it's beneficial

22:43.580 --> 22:45.920
 can change our physiology in ways

22:45.920 --> 22:48.020
 that can be beneficial to us.

22:48.020 --> 22:50.880
 Somewhere in between those two extremes

22:50.880 --> 22:55.620
 of hardcore metabolic science and belief effects

22:55.620 --> 23:00.460
 lie a bunch of protocols that are grounded

23:00.460 --> 23:03.420
 in quality peer-reviewed science and in physiology

23:03.420 --> 23:06.540
 that you can leverage to increase the rates of fat loss.

23:06.540 --> 23:08.900
 And so that's what we're going to talk about today.

23:08.900 --> 23:10.100
 I love this topic,

23:10.100 --> 23:13.120
 and it's not that I'm so obsessed with fat loss,

23:13.120 --> 23:16.660
 but rather the first project I ever worked on in science

23:16.660 --> 23:19.120
 was thermogenesis and fat loss.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.140
 I joined a laboratory as an undergraduate

23:22.140 --> 23:25.940
 and the guy I worked for loved to explore new compounds

23:25.940 --> 23:28.800
 and how they impacted thermogenesis.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.700
 And so we looked at how things like MDMA, ecstasy,

23:33.540 --> 23:37.140
 how antipsychotics, antidepressants,

23:37.140 --> 23:39.700
 various weight loss drugs that were on the market,

23:39.700 --> 23:42.220
 how those impacted body temperature

23:42.220 --> 23:43.940
 and fat loss and metabolism.

23:43.940 --> 23:45.380
 And we just had so much fun doing it.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.900
 So if you detect a smile on my face,

23:47.900 --> 23:49.940
 that's what that's about.

23:49.940 --> 23:51.140
 And I also learned a lot,

23:51.140 --> 23:53.420
 and I also came to really appreciate

23:53.420 --> 23:57.800
 that this tissue of our bodies, adipose tissue and fat,

23:57.800 --> 24:00.220
 we think of as just this unfortunate thing,

24:00.220 --> 24:03.300
 this like we're told it's a core energy source

24:03.300 --> 24:06.460
 if we ever entered a famine and that's all true, et cetera,

24:06.460 --> 24:08.860
 come to realize that these cells in our body,

24:08.860 --> 24:13.860
 they are there as fuel for the furnace of our body,

24:13.860 --> 24:15.380
 which is our metabolism.

24:16.340 --> 24:17.820
 And there's a third player.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.180
 And that's where it really gets interesting

24:19.180 --> 24:22.740
 that the nervous system, neurons has the opportunity

24:22.740 --> 24:25.740
 to turn up the intensity of that furnace.

24:25.740 --> 24:29.380
 It has the opportunity to increase the amount of heat

24:29.380 --> 24:32.480
 that we produce and therefore the amount of energy

24:32.480 --> 24:33.500
 that we burn.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.300
 And I was also really intrigued by something

24:35.300 --> 24:37.220
 which is that growing up,

24:37.220 --> 24:40.540
 I think we all know people who can eat a ton

24:40.540 --> 24:42.780
 and never seem to gain any body fat

24:42.780 --> 24:44.620
 or people who seem to eat very little

24:44.620 --> 24:46.340
 and seem to gain body fat very easily.

24:46.340 --> 24:47.620
 And I was always intrigued by that.

24:47.620 --> 24:50.100
 And it turns out there are a number of different factors

24:50.100 --> 24:51.460
 that relate to that,

24:51.460 --> 24:55.300
 but the nervous system is the one that we can really control

24:55.300 --> 24:56.860
 both through behaviors and what we eat,

24:56.860 --> 25:00.260
 but also in terms of this thing that we call thermogenesis.

25:00.260 --> 25:02.380
 There was one particular story I want to relate to you

25:02.380 --> 25:04.820
 that does not suggest any protocol.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.420
 In fact, I'm going to discourage you

25:06.420 --> 25:08.100
 from following this protocol.

25:08.100 --> 25:13.100
 Please do not try the compound that I'm about to describe.

25:13.300 --> 25:16.260
 One of the favorite things that we like to do in that lab

25:16.260 --> 25:20.200
 was to find rare compounds and test them.

25:20.200 --> 25:23.860
 And at the time I was reading about thermogenesis

25:23.860 --> 25:26.580
 and I learned about a compound that was actually discovered

25:26.580 --> 25:29.880
 in the armory factories of World War II.

25:29.880 --> 25:33.860
 And it was discovered because women in particular

25:33.860 --> 25:36.020
 who were working in these factories

25:36.020 --> 25:39.900
 would take a brush and dip it in a compound

25:39.900 --> 25:41.040
 or a paint rather.

25:41.040 --> 25:44.100
 And they would then paint the numbers with a stencil

25:44.100 --> 25:48.820
 onto things like bombs and ammunition of various kinds.

25:48.820 --> 25:52.440
 And they were losing weight like crazy.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.420
 It turns out that occasionally they'd lick the brush

25:54.420 --> 25:55.420
 and then they would go back

25:55.420 --> 25:57.500
 just to get a sharper point on the brush.

25:57.500 --> 26:01.140
 And then they would paint onto these various bullets

26:01.140 --> 26:05.020
 and missiles and so forth, bombs and so forth.

26:05.020 --> 26:07.300
 And they started shedding all their body fat.

26:07.300 --> 26:10.860
 And many of them lost a lot of weight,

26:10.860 --> 26:12.540
 a significant portion of their weight

26:12.540 --> 26:14.380
 without changing anything else that they were doing,

26:14.380 --> 26:16.120
 what they were eating, et cetera.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.380
 Turned out that that compound

26:17.380 --> 26:21.180
 is something called dinitrophenol, DNP.

26:21.180 --> 26:25.460
 And over the years, dinitrophenol, DNP,

26:25.460 --> 26:29.020
 has gained popularity in some niche cultures,

26:29.020 --> 26:30.900
 mainly bodybuilders, athletes,

26:30.900 --> 26:33.140
 even in the kind of modeling industry,

26:33.140 --> 26:36.980
 it is a absolutely terrible compound for anyone to use

26:36.980 --> 26:39.680
 because it's highly fatal

26:39.680 --> 26:42.020
 if your body temperature goes too high,

26:42.020 --> 26:43.460
 hyperthermia will kill you.

26:43.460 --> 26:47.180
 And indeed, many people have died using dinitrophenol

26:47.180 --> 26:48.940
 as a weight loss drug

26:48.940 --> 26:51.380
 or attempting to use it as a weight loss drug.

26:51.380 --> 26:54.800
 But dinitrophenol really illustrates a principle,

26:54.800 --> 26:57.880
 which is that your metabolism

26:57.880 --> 26:59.380
 includes things like thyroid hormone

26:59.380 --> 27:01.200
 and growth hormone, et cetera,

27:01.200 --> 27:06.200
 but your body temperature and the way you utilize energy

27:06.760 --> 27:09.820
 is controlled by your nervous system.

27:09.820 --> 27:14.520
 And the way dinitrophenol works is by changing the neurons

27:14.520 --> 27:17.380
 and the way that the neurons that connect to fat

27:18.460 --> 27:21.160
 change the way fat burns up.

27:21.160 --> 27:23.340
 So we are not going to suggest,

27:23.340 --> 27:27.120
 I am not suggesting that you use dinitrophenol.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.960
 However, there are other things that you can do

27:30.960 --> 27:32.780
 that can change the relationship

27:32.780 --> 27:36.060
 between these neurons and the fat of your body

27:36.060 --> 27:40.860
 in ways that can powerfully accelerate fat loss.

27:40.860 --> 27:42.860
 And I don't know why we don't hear about these things more,

27:42.860 --> 27:45.520
 but probably because most of what you see out there

27:45.520 --> 27:48.200
 on the internet focuses more on what you could eat

27:48.200 --> 27:50.020
 and should eat or shouldn't eat.

27:50.020 --> 27:52.400
 It concentrates on exercise regimens,

27:52.400 --> 27:54.300
 which we will also talk about.

27:54.300 --> 27:59.300
 But the burn factor, your thermogenic environment

27:59.300 --> 28:03.860
 is one of the, if not the most important factors

28:03.860 --> 28:05.980
 in this business of fat loss.

28:05.980 --> 28:07.400
 And since I'm a neuroscientist,

28:07.400 --> 28:09.100
 that's what we're going to talk about.

28:09.100 --> 28:11.240
 So let's talk about fat utilization.

28:11.240 --> 28:15.020
 Let's talk about how fat is converted into energy,

28:15.020 --> 28:18.080
 which is sometimes also called fat burning.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.780
 What I'd like you to know

28:20.780 --> 28:23.820
 is that this is a two-part process, okay?

28:23.820 --> 28:27.220
 In reality, there are many biochemical steps.

28:27.220 --> 28:29.740
 And if you log on to the internet

28:29.740 --> 28:31.100
 or you open up a textbook

28:31.100 --> 28:34.820
 and you want to learn about fat utilization,

28:34.820 --> 28:37.340
 you're going to see a lot of chemistry.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.980
 And I'm happy to go deep into that chemistry if you like,

28:39.980 --> 28:42.240
 but I think most of you are probably interested

28:42.240 --> 28:44.460
 in what are the leverage points?

28:44.460 --> 28:47.060
 Where can you exert control over this process

28:47.060 --> 28:48.340
 in ways that benefit you?

28:48.340 --> 28:51.100
 So I'm going to focus mainly on those, okay?

28:51.100 --> 28:54.300
 This is not to upset the aficionados

28:54.300 --> 28:56.820
 and I will put in some nomenclature,

28:56.820 --> 28:57.800
 but here we go.

28:58.740 --> 29:00.500
 There's two parts to this process.

29:00.500 --> 29:03.620
 One is fat mobilization.

29:03.620 --> 29:08.620
 And the second is fat oxidation or utilization, okay?

29:09.100 --> 29:11.660
 So the first thing that has to happen

29:11.660 --> 29:16.360
 for body fat to get burned up or used and reduced

29:16.360 --> 29:18.980
 is that it has to get mobilized.

29:18.980 --> 29:21.380
 And that's a process called lipolysis,

29:21.380 --> 29:24.300
 but I actually don't care if you know the name lipolysis,

29:24.300 --> 29:26.900
 you just have to move that fat

29:26.900 --> 29:30.340
 out of the position that it's in.

29:30.340 --> 29:32.660
 You have to get it out of the fat cells, all right?

29:32.660 --> 29:36.120
 Fat cells can be visceral around our viscera, our organs,

29:36.120 --> 29:37.900
 or they can be subcutaneous under our skin.

29:37.900 --> 29:41.140
 Most people are thinking about subcutaneous fat

29:41.140 --> 29:42.900
 when they think about fat.

29:42.900 --> 29:45.300
 So here's the deal.

29:45.300 --> 29:49.120
 And if you want more detail, great.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.580
 I'll touch on that in a bit,

29:50.580 --> 29:54.260
 but basically stored fat has two parts

29:54.260 --> 29:55.600
 that are relevant here.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.220
 It's got the fatty acid part,

29:57.220 --> 29:59.500
 and that's the part that your body can use.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.660
 And that's attached to something called glycerol,

30:01.660 --> 30:03.500
 and they're linked by a backbone.

30:03.500 --> 30:05.460
 So already probably too much chemistry for both of you,

30:05.460 --> 30:07.780
 but what you want is you want to break the backbone.

30:07.780 --> 30:09.920
 So if you just can remember to mobilize fat,

30:09.920 --> 30:11.180
 you got to break the backbone

30:11.180 --> 30:14.000
 between glycerol and these fatty acids, okay?

30:14.000 --> 30:16.660
 That's accomplished by an enzyme called lipase,

30:16.660 --> 30:17.940
 but you can forget all that if you want.

30:17.940 --> 30:20.180
 Remember, we're just trying to mobilize fat.

30:20.180 --> 30:24.460
 So the first step is to get those fatty acids moving around

30:24.460 --> 30:27.620
 in the bloodstream, to get them out of those fat cells,

30:27.620 --> 30:32.620
 and then they can travel and be used for energy.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.700
 And that second part, remember, first part is mobilization,

30:35.700 --> 30:37.740
 the second part is oxidation,

30:37.740 --> 30:40.900
 is then those fatty acids, those are potential fuel.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.060
 They're just potential fuel,

30:42.060 --> 30:43.540
 but you haven't burned the fat yet.

30:43.540 --> 30:46.000
 You've just moved it out of your fat cells.

30:46.000 --> 30:50.780
 They're going to go into cells that can use them for energy.

30:50.780 --> 30:53.220
 And once they are inside those cells,

30:53.220 --> 30:55.180
 they're still not burned up.

30:55.180 --> 30:56.500
 You need to oxidize them.

30:56.500 --> 30:59.780
 You think oxidation is the burnup part.

30:59.780 --> 31:04.120
 They need to be moved into the mitochondria,

31:04.120 --> 31:07.440
 and then they can be converted into ATP, into energy.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.820
 So just to really zoom out again

31:08.820 --> 31:09.980
 to make sure I don't lose anybody,

31:09.980 --> 31:11.260
 you got to mobilize the fat,

31:11.260 --> 31:12.900
 then you have to oxidize the fat.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.620
 You have to, in other words, you have to mobilize it,

31:14.620 --> 31:17.100
 then you actually have to convert it into energy.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.600
 If you just mobilize it

31:19.600 --> 31:22.540
 and you don't convert it into energy, you don't oxidize it,

31:22.540 --> 31:25.220
 it can be returned to body fat.

31:25.220 --> 31:28.500
 And many of the things that the nervous system can do

31:28.500 --> 31:32.360
 is to increase the mobilization of fat,

31:32.360 --> 31:35.460
 but also the oxidation of fat, okay?

31:35.460 --> 31:39.020
 So you have two opportunities to burn more fat,

31:39.020 --> 31:40.740
 and both of those opportunities

31:40.740 --> 31:42.960
 are governed by your nervous system,

31:42.960 --> 31:46.340
 by neurons that literally send little wires

31:46.340 --> 31:48.500
 that we call axons into fat,

31:48.500 --> 31:53.060
 and release chemicals that provide a stimulus

31:53.060 --> 31:55.580
 for more of that fat to be mobilized,

31:55.580 --> 31:59.620
 and then later for more of that fat to be burned up, okay?

31:59.620 --> 32:02.380
 So we could go really deep on this,

32:02.380 --> 32:04.140
 but I'm not going to go much deeper than that

32:04.140 --> 32:06.360
 because this isn't a biochemistry

32:06.360 --> 32:08.660
 of fatty acid metabolism lecture.

32:08.660 --> 32:11.460
 This is about how to burn fat using your nervous system.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.660
 But remember, there's a mobilization step

32:13.660 --> 32:15.580
 and then there's an oxidation step.

32:15.580 --> 32:17.380
 I think any one of you,

32:17.380 --> 32:19.200
 all of you should be able to internalize that.

32:19.200 --> 32:21.980
 Mobilize, then oxidize, okay?

32:21.980 --> 32:24.220
 Mobilize, then oxidize.

32:24.220 --> 32:27.100
 So what are these neurons that connect to fat doing?

32:27.100 --> 32:29.020
 What are they releasing exactly?

32:29.020 --> 32:31.420
 How do they actually increase fat mobilization

32:31.420 --> 32:35.880
 and how do they increase fat oxidation, burning of fat?

32:35.880 --> 32:39.020
 Well, there are a couple of things that they release

32:39.020 --> 32:40.680
 that encourage that process.

32:40.680 --> 32:43.060
 And the main one that you need to know about

32:43.060 --> 32:46.100
 is epinephrine or adrenaline.

32:46.100 --> 32:49.420
 The conversion of these fatty acids into ATP

32:49.420 --> 32:54.420
 in the mitochondria of cells is favored by adrenaline, okay?

32:54.660 --> 32:58.300
 And adrenaline is released from two sources.

32:58.300 --> 33:00.420
 Adrenaline is released from the adrenal glands,

33:00.420 --> 33:03.380
 which sit atop our kidneys and our lower back.

33:03.380 --> 33:05.500
 And it's also released

33:05.500 --> 33:07.580
 from the so-called sympathetic nervous system,

33:07.580 --> 33:09.780
 although that name is a bit of a misnomer

33:09.780 --> 33:11.900
 because it has nothing to do with sympathy,

33:11.900 --> 33:14.320
 has to do with stimulating alertness

33:14.320 --> 33:16.760
 and promoting action of the body.

33:17.760 --> 33:22.300
 There's a big mistake in the literature

33:22.300 --> 33:26.160
 that is finally being corrected among those who know.

33:26.160 --> 33:29.380
 The mistake in the literature is that the adrenal glands

33:29.380 --> 33:31.100
 and the release of adrenaline

33:31.100 --> 33:35.340
 is what stimulates fat loss and fat oxidation.

33:35.340 --> 33:37.900
 In fact, it was thought for a long time

33:37.900 --> 33:40.100
 that adrenaline swimming around in your body

33:40.100 --> 33:41.400
 of when you're fasted,

33:41.400 --> 33:43.460
 because fasting can increase adrenaline,

33:43.460 --> 33:46.300
 or when you're engaging in intense exercise

33:46.300 --> 33:47.740
 or when you're stressed,

33:47.740 --> 33:50.220
 is going to promote fat oxidation.

33:50.220 --> 33:52.060
 That's actually not the case.

33:53.060 --> 33:56.360
 The adrenaline that stimulates fat oxidation,

33:56.360 --> 33:57.980
 the burning of fat,

33:57.980 --> 34:02.640
 is coming from neurons that actually connect to the fat,

34:02.640 --> 34:04.940
 not hormones like adrenaline

34:04.940 --> 34:06.340
 that are swimming around in your system.

34:06.340 --> 34:08.460
 It's a local process.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.820
 And this is very important

34:10.820 --> 34:13.980
 because it means that what you do,

34:13.980 --> 34:16.360
 the specific patterns of movements

34:16.360 --> 34:19.660
 and the specific environment you create

34:19.660 --> 34:22.660
 that can stimulate these particular neurons

34:23.620 --> 34:26.060
 to activate fat,

34:26.060 --> 34:29.280
 meaning to release fat, to mobilize it,

34:29.280 --> 34:30.320
 and then to burn it,

34:30.320 --> 34:33.140
 is going to be a powerful lever that you can use

34:33.140 --> 34:35.140
 in order to increase fat loss.

34:35.140 --> 34:36.300
 So what have we said so far?

34:36.300 --> 34:37.600
 We've said that you got to mobilize,

34:37.600 --> 34:38.520
 you got to burn fat,

34:38.520 --> 34:42.820
 and that your nervous system is in control of that process.

34:42.820 --> 34:45.800
 It's not just about calorie deficit.

34:47.100 --> 34:49.700
 So let's talk about how to activate the nervous system

34:49.700 --> 34:52.100
 in ways that it promotes more liberation,

34:52.100 --> 34:54.140
 movement, mobilization of fat,

34:54.140 --> 34:56.620
 and more oxidation of fat.

34:56.620 --> 35:00.040
 So one of the most powerful ways to stimulate epinephrine,

35:00.040 --> 35:01.340
 which is also called adrenaline,

35:01.340 --> 35:04.420
 from these neurons that connect to fat

35:04.420 --> 35:07.740
 and to thereby stimulate more fat mobilization

35:07.740 --> 35:10.940
 and oxidation is through movement.

35:10.940 --> 35:13.600
 But I'm not talking about exercise.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.460
 The type of movement that I'm referring to

35:15.460 --> 35:17.780
 is extremely subtle.

35:17.780 --> 35:21.820
 And some of you may be familiar with this type of movement,

35:21.820 --> 35:24.840
 but I'm guessing you're probably not familiar

35:24.840 --> 35:26.540
 with what I'm about to tell you,

35:26.540 --> 35:29.940
 which is that shiver or shivering

35:29.940 --> 35:34.940
 is a strong stimulus for the release of adrenaline,

35:35.020 --> 35:36.620
 epinephrine, into fat,

35:36.620 --> 35:40.220
 and the increase in fat oxidation and mobilization.

35:41.060 --> 35:44.980
 But shiver is not just induced by cold.

35:44.980 --> 35:47.700
 And there are other subtle forms of movement

35:47.700 --> 35:51.820
 that can greatly increase fat metabolism and fat loss.

35:52.780 --> 35:56.500
 There was a group in England during the 1960s and 70s

35:56.500 --> 35:59.140
 that discovered a pathway

35:59.140 --> 36:02.620
 by which subtle forms of movement

36:02.620 --> 36:04.900
 can greatly increase fat loss.

36:06.020 --> 36:09.180
 This is the work of Rothwell and Stock.

36:09.180 --> 36:12.260
 It's very famous in the thermogenesis literature.

36:12.260 --> 36:13.620
 And I learned about this early on

36:13.620 --> 36:15.260
 when I was an undergraduate.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.460
 And I asked, how did they come across this?

36:17.460 --> 36:18.980
 And here's how the story goes.

36:20.420 --> 36:24.660
 They were aware that some people overeat

36:24.660 --> 36:26.680
 and yet don't put on weight.

36:26.680 --> 36:29.180
 Other people overeat even just a little bit,

36:29.180 --> 36:32.860
 and they seem to accumulate extra adipose tissue.

36:32.860 --> 36:34.900
 Now, this is long before all the discussions

36:34.900 --> 36:37.360
 about microbiome and hormone factors,

36:37.360 --> 36:40.240
 and it was long before many of the hormone factors

36:40.240 --> 36:42.340
 besides insulin had even been discovered.

36:43.220 --> 36:45.260
 What they did was they examined people

36:45.260 --> 36:48.660
 who overate and did not gain weight.

36:48.660 --> 36:52.160
 And what they observed was that those people

36:52.160 --> 36:55.580
 engaged in lots of subtle movement throughout the day.

36:55.580 --> 36:58.060
 In other words, they were fidgeters,

36:58.060 --> 36:59.300
 and that's what they call them.

36:59.300 --> 37:03.400
 I'm not going to do the British accent version of fidgeters,

37:03.400 --> 37:05.600
 but Rothwell and Stock were British.

37:06.660 --> 37:08.540
 What they found were people that overeat

37:08.540 --> 37:12.220
 but don't gain weight as a consequence.

37:12.220 --> 37:16.540
 And in fact, many people who had low levels of body fat

37:16.540 --> 37:21.500
 had a lot of resting tremor, not of the Parkinsonian type,

37:21.500 --> 37:24.020
 but they would bounce their knee while they were sitting.

37:24.020 --> 37:26.220
 When they would talk, they would engage

37:26.220 --> 37:27.700
 in very angular movements.

37:27.700 --> 37:28.900
 They were sort of electric.

37:28.900 --> 37:31.480
 In fact, now in science, I was chuckling about this

37:31.480 --> 37:33.180
 as I was diving back into this literature

37:33.180 --> 37:35.380
 because the other day I heard a wonderful lecture

37:35.380 --> 37:37.700
 on a totally different topic from a colleague of mine,

37:37.700 --> 37:38.980
 and we all adore him.

37:38.980 --> 37:39.980
 He's over in Europe,

37:39.980 --> 37:42.260
 and he's this tremendously successful scientist,

37:42.260 --> 37:44.500
 so we like to poke fun at him.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.940
 And every one of his movements

37:45.940 --> 37:48.340
 is incredibly electric and staccato,

37:48.340 --> 37:51.060
 and he's rail thin and he eats like a horse.

37:51.060 --> 37:52.900
 And so it fits very well into the discovery

37:52.900 --> 37:57.060
 of Rothwell and Stock who discovered that fidgeters,

37:57.060 --> 37:59.260
 people that bounce their knee,

37:59.260 --> 38:02.720
 people that have a head bob while they're listening,

38:02.720 --> 38:03.980
 people that nod a lot,

38:03.980 --> 38:06.820
 people that stand up and sit down a lot throughout the day,

38:06.820 --> 38:11.300
 and people that pace burn anywhere from 800

38:11.300 --> 38:16.300
 to 2,500 calories more than the control group

38:16.840 --> 38:18.420
 in the experiments that they looked at.

38:18.420 --> 38:22.100
 And indeed, there's been a modern look into all this,

38:22.100 --> 38:23.900
 and these numbers check out,

38:23.900 --> 38:26.460
 that simply moving around a lot,

38:26.460 --> 38:28.780
 even if those are subtle movements,

38:28.780 --> 38:31.700
 greatly increases the amount of energy that you burn.

38:31.700 --> 38:32.860
 And people who overeat,

38:32.860 --> 38:35.460
 the people who can have the second or the third donut

38:35.460 --> 38:36.300
 or donuts at all,

38:36.300 --> 38:39.100
 and don't seem to put on weight to the same degree,

38:39.100 --> 38:43.180
 they are people that move around a lot even when seated.

38:43.180 --> 38:46.940
 They're people that will often move their limbs

38:46.940 --> 38:48.340
 very quickly as well.

38:48.340 --> 38:50.200
 There even have been studies

38:50.200 --> 38:52.280
 that have explored other things

38:52.280 --> 38:53.500
 that correlate with fidgeters.

38:53.500 --> 38:55.920
 Fidgeters stand up very quickly at the end of a lecture,

38:55.920 --> 38:57.860
 or they start to gather their things very quickly,

38:57.860 --> 38:59.900
 whereas non-fidgeters don't.

38:59.900 --> 39:01.860
 So dogs like my bulldog Costello,

39:01.860 --> 39:04.220
 definitely not a fidgeter.

39:04.220 --> 39:07.300
 Every movement is incredibly slow and deliberate.

39:07.300 --> 39:09.060
 Sitting down is a process.

39:09.060 --> 39:11.940
 If you ask him to sit down, it's sort of a slow motion.

39:11.940 --> 39:12.900
 You ask him to get up,

39:12.900 --> 39:15.260
 and he kind of looks at you, sighs, and stands up.

39:15.260 --> 39:17.240
 The fidgeters are the opposite of that, right?

39:17.240 --> 39:18.220
 You say, how are you doing?

39:18.220 --> 39:19.300
 They go, great.

39:19.300 --> 39:22.060
 So even sometimes their speech will be accelerated,

39:22.060 --> 39:23.060
 although not always,

39:23.060 --> 39:26.000
 but staccato movements, fidgeting, et cetera.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.740
 And in 2015, and again in 2017,

39:29.740 --> 39:32.420
 there've been studies that have explored this

39:32.420 --> 39:34.780
 using some modern metabolic tracking.

39:34.780 --> 39:38.180
 And indeed, simply moving a lot,

39:38.180 --> 39:40.360
 being a fidgeter, bouncing your knee,

39:40.360 --> 39:42.980
 standing up and pacing several times

39:42.980 --> 39:45.380
 or many times throughout the day,

39:45.380 --> 39:49.800
 led to considerable amounts of fat loss and weight loss

39:49.800 --> 39:52.820
 when people were ingesting the same amount of food.

39:52.820 --> 39:53.740
 If they overate,

39:53.740 --> 39:56.640
 they were able to compensate and burn off that food.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.400
 And if they were trying to lose weight,

40:00.620 --> 40:03.660
 and they incorporated this fidgeting protocol

40:03.660 --> 40:05.340
 of deliberately trying to fidget more

40:05.340 --> 40:07.020
 and move around during the day,

40:07.020 --> 40:09.640
 pace, stand up more quickly, sit down more often,

40:09.640 --> 40:11.660
 sit down and stand up more often rather,

40:11.660 --> 40:14.260
 they found that they greatly increased their weight loss

40:14.260 --> 40:17.500
 anywhere from 20 to 30% increases.

40:17.500 --> 40:18.580
 And in some cases,

40:18.580 --> 40:21.500
 there are always those few people who burned a lot more.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.440
 It seems to work best

40:23.440 --> 40:27.000
 in people who are already slightly overweight.

40:27.000 --> 40:28.820
 So for people that are overweight,

40:28.820 --> 40:31.500
 who are kind of averse to exercise,

40:31.500 --> 40:34.460
 fidgeting might actually be a good entry point.

40:34.460 --> 40:37.100
 And 800 to 2,500 calories

40:37.100 --> 40:38.560
 is a considerable amount of calories

40:38.560 --> 40:40.140
 when you really think about it.

40:40.140 --> 40:41.380
 Now, why am I telling you this?

40:41.380 --> 40:44.320
 Well, there's clearly a tool to export from this,

40:44.320 --> 40:47.540
 which is that you can increase the amount of calories burned

40:47.540 --> 40:50.580
 without having to go on additional long runs.

40:50.580 --> 40:52.560
 I do hope that people are exercising regularly

40:52.560 --> 40:54.460
 because it's so important for other aspects

40:54.460 --> 40:56.080
 of brain and body health.

40:56.080 --> 41:00.680
 But nonetheless, we are all time limited

41:00.680 --> 41:04.940
 and we are not all so ready to embrace exercise.

41:04.940 --> 41:06.260
 I have a family member

41:06.260 --> 41:09.660
 who has been slowly coaxed into exercise.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.200
 But if I were to tell her, for instance,

41:11.200 --> 41:13.400
 you need to fidget more, she'd probably go for it.

41:13.400 --> 41:15.960
 So this is a powerful way

41:15.960 --> 41:19.600
 to increase the calories that are burned.

41:19.600 --> 41:22.340
 Now, that's great.

41:22.340 --> 41:23.640
 And you can think about the protocols,

41:23.640 --> 41:28.640
 but I want to nest that protocol in what I said before,

41:28.880 --> 41:33.420
 which is that fat is controlled by these neurons

41:33.420 --> 41:35.260
 and the epinephrine they release.

41:35.260 --> 41:36.140
 You might say, well,

41:36.140 --> 41:38.300
 how could these little micro movements

41:38.300 --> 41:40.940
 lead to so much caloric burn?

41:40.940 --> 41:42.900
 And that's where it really gets interesting.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.380
 Rothwell and Stock and others that they worked with

41:45.380 --> 41:49.180
 subsequently found that these little fidgety movements,

41:49.180 --> 41:52.060
 the engagement of certain aspects of our musculature

41:52.060 --> 41:53.860
 that are nothing like exercise,

41:53.860 --> 41:57.300
 it's not these large coordinated or rhythmic body movements,

41:57.300 --> 42:01.420
 but rather subtle little bits of fidgety movement.

42:01.420 --> 42:04.180
 And here I am doing a lot of fidgety movement.

42:04.180 --> 42:07.180
 As an example, tapping the pen, this kind of thing.

42:07.180 --> 42:09.380
 I was probably that kid in class most of the time.

42:09.380 --> 42:11.180
 I was like, I try not to do it to irritate people,

42:11.180 --> 42:13.500
 but I was definitely a knee bouncer.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.660
 I'm not particularly lean or not,

42:15.660 --> 42:20.260
 but I was definitely, this is a common activity for me.

42:20.260 --> 42:21.860
 People that do that sort of thing,

42:21.860 --> 42:25.280
 it turns out that it's not the kind of caloric burn

42:25.280 --> 42:26.660
 that we normally think of, of like,

42:26.660 --> 42:30.580
 oh, you're running, lifting weights, swimming, yoga, et cetera.

42:30.580 --> 42:34.260
 Those subtle movements of our core musculature,

42:34.260 --> 42:37.460
 not just the core, but all our limbs and our musculature,

42:37.460 --> 42:39.880
 those low level movements,

42:39.880 --> 42:43.720
 they trigger epinephrine release from these neurons

42:43.720 --> 42:46.900
 and they stimulate the mobilization of fat.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.900
 And then that fat is oxidized at higher rates.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.460
 And I find this fascinating.

42:51.460 --> 42:52.840
 I wish more people knew about it,

42:52.840 --> 42:54.780
 which is why I'm telling you about it today.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.820
 This has nothing to do with exercise

42:56.820 --> 42:58.220
 in the traditional form.

42:58.220 --> 43:01.220
 And yet 800 to 2,500 calories per day,

43:01.220 --> 43:04.780
 that's a considerable amount of fat oxidized.

43:04.780 --> 43:07.820
 If you are in a calorie maintenance mode

43:07.820 --> 43:09.260
 or if you're sub caloric,

43:09.260 --> 43:13.020
 that's going to add to still additional fat loss.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.260
 The data on this are tremendous.

43:14.260 --> 43:15.420
 I'll link to a few studies.

43:15.420 --> 43:16.920
 If you're really interested in learning

43:16.920 --> 43:19.940
 about what's called NEAT, N-E-A-T,

43:19.940 --> 43:24.940
 which is non-exercise activity thermogenesis, NEAT.

43:24.940 --> 43:26.460
 So what's the protocol?

43:26.460 --> 43:27.940
 Fidget.

43:27.940 --> 43:30.060
 If you're really interested in burning calories

43:30.060 --> 43:32.860
 and you already exercise, you want to burn more,

43:32.860 --> 43:35.340
 or you don't have the opportunity to exercise

43:35.340 --> 43:37.740
 or you're a versed exercise for whatever reason,

43:38.580 --> 43:41.800
 fidgeting movements, staccato movements, standing up,

43:41.800 --> 43:45.500
 walking around, pacing, all the sort of nervous activities

43:45.500 --> 43:47.220
 that we're so critical of in other people

43:47.220 --> 43:51.140
 and sometimes in ourselves are actually mobilizing

43:51.140 --> 43:55.000
 and oxidizing a lot of fat and a lot of energy.

43:55.000 --> 43:57.580
 And while this probably won't compensate

43:57.580 --> 44:00.140
 for chronic overeating,

44:00.140 --> 44:03.000
 the caloric burn from this is considerable

44:03.000 --> 44:08.000
 and very likely can offset a meal that had excessive

44:08.340 --> 44:12.900
 calories or a kind of steady state of eating too much.

44:12.900 --> 44:15.260
 And it also starts to open up all sorts of thoughts

44:15.260 --> 44:17.720
 and discussion about when you travel,

44:17.720 --> 44:20.980
 you tend to eat foods that are outside your normal ones.

44:20.980 --> 44:23.520
 We tend to eat foods that aren't so great for us.

44:23.520 --> 44:25.280
 We also tend to be a little bit more sedentary

44:25.280 --> 44:27.700
 when we travel, we're on the plane, et cetera.

44:27.700 --> 44:31.140
 But all of that aside,

44:31.140 --> 44:34.780
 just the use of something like low-level movement

44:34.780 --> 44:36.800
 and it's almost like a tremor,

44:36.800 --> 44:39.520
 but also these like short, small fidgety movements,

44:39.520 --> 44:40.940
 I'm intentionally doing a lot of these today

44:40.940 --> 44:42.940
 so you have examples that you can use

44:42.940 --> 44:45.520
 that to select from if you like,

44:46.380 --> 44:49.680
 these can have a major effect on fat loss.

44:50.840 --> 44:53.040
 And it raises a second tool.

44:54.140 --> 44:57.660
 If these low, meaning these small movements

44:57.660 --> 44:59.940
 that we engage in trigger epinephrine,

44:59.940 --> 45:01.700
 adrenaline release from these neurons

45:01.700 --> 45:03.940
 of the sympathetic nervous system that innervate fat

45:03.940 --> 45:08.160
 and increase fat mobilization and oxidation,

45:08.160 --> 45:12.340
 now it should make sense why shivering

45:12.340 --> 45:15.300
 is one of the strongest stimuli

45:15.300 --> 45:19.900
 that one can incorporate to stimulate fat loss.

45:19.900 --> 45:23.040
 Now shivering is almost always associated with cold.

45:23.040 --> 45:24.300
 We think shivering, we think cold

45:24.300 --> 45:26.840
 because when we get cold, we shiver.

45:26.840 --> 45:30.940
 And there are two ways that shivering can increase fat loss.

45:30.940 --> 45:34.160
 And there are several ways that you can use shivering.

45:34.160 --> 45:35.700
 You can leverage shivering

45:35.700 --> 45:38.580
 and you can leverage cold to accelerate fat loss,

45:38.580 --> 45:40.740
 but you have to do it correctly.

45:40.740 --> 45:44.220
 And most of the people that are using cold

45:44.220 --> 45:46.180
 and frankly suggesting cold

45:46.180 --> 45:49.420
 as a means to increase metabolism fat loss

45:49.420 --> 45:52.340
 are suggesting the exact wrong protocol.

45:52.340 --> 45:53.920
 In fact, the one I'm going to recommend

45:53.920 --> 45:56.720
 is 180 degrees in the opposite direction

45:56.720 --> 45:58.700
 to the typical protocol that you'd hear about.

45:58.700 --> 46:00.700
 So let's talk about how to use cold

46:00.700 --> 46:02.980
 and how to leverage shiver

46:02.980 --> 46:07.340
 as a particularly strong stimulus to increase fat loss

46:07.340 --> 46:10.980
 through mobilization and oxidation of these fatty acids.

46:10.980 --> 46:13.280
 So in recent years, there's been a growing interest

46:13.280 --> 46:15.740
 in the use of cold for various things

46:15.740 --> 46:18.020
 like improving stress tolerance,

46:18.020 --> 46:20.840
 improving metabolism, recovery from exercise.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.460
 I've talked about a number of those things

46:22.460 --> 46:24.840
 and the uses of cold on this podcast.

46:24.840 --> 46:29.840
 In fact, did an episode on how to supercharge performance

46:30.260 --> 46:34.460
 through palmer cooling, cooling the palms in specific ways

46:34.460 --> 46:36.180
 or the bottoms of the feet.

46:36.180 --> 46:37.820
 And if you're interested in that

46:37.820 --> 46:40.540
 and how to improve performance in endurance and strength,

46:40.540 --> 46:42.280
 you can check out that episode.

46:42.280 --> 46:45.820
 But most people out there are using cold exposure

46:46.700 --> 46:49.920
 typically by taking cold showers

46:49.920 --> 46:53.020
 or by getting into cold water of some other kind,

46:53.020 --> 46:56.620
 a lake or a river or a cold bath or an ice bath.

46:56.620 --> 47:00.580
 And they are doing that probably with mixed goals,

47:00.580 --> 47:04.080
 meaning they both would like to increase their metabolism

47:04.080 --> 47:07.560
 and burn fat as well as improve mental resilience.

47:08.860 --> 47:11.700
 Since today we're talking about accelerating fat loss

47:11.700 --> 47:14.140
 through the use of science-based tools,

47:14.140 --> 47:16.900
 I want to emphasize a study that was published in Nature

47:16.900 --> 47:19.140
 just a couple of years ago

47:19.140 --> 47:24.140
 showing exactly how cold increases metabolism and fat loss.

47:25.820 --> 47:30.540
 So we have several kinds of fat, three kinds in fact.

47:30.540 --> 47:33.560
 We have white fat, white adipose tissue,

47:33.560 --> 47:36.900
 and we have brown fat or brown adipose tissue.

47:38.500 --> 47:41.700
 And there's a third kind, which is beige adipose tissue.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.540
 White fat is the type that we traditionally think of

47:45.540 --> 47:48.640
 as fat, subcutaneous fat.

47:48.640 --> 47:51.380
 And it is not particularly rich in mitochondria,

47:51.380 --> 47:54.860
 it is there as an energy storage site.

47:54.860 --> 47:56.820
 And we have to mobilize the fat out

47:56.820 --> 47:59.740
 as we talked about before and burn it up elsewhere.

47:59.740 --> 48:04.060
 Brown fat largely exists between our shoulder blades

48:04.060 --> 48:07.800
 and on the back of our neck, between the scapulae.

48:07.800 --> 48:09.460
 And it's rich with mitochondria,

48:09.460 --> 48:11.900
 which is why it's called brown fat.

48:11.900 --> 48:16.560
 And brown fat has a particular biochemical cascade

48:16.560 --> 48:19.660
 whereby it can take food energy,

48:19.660 --> 48:22.260
 and it can take food basically,

48:22.260 --> 48:26.380
 break it down and convert it into energy within those cells.

48:26.380 --> 48:28.020
 And there's some additional steps involved,

48:28.020 --> 48:30.820
 but unlike fatty acids from white fat,

48:30.820 --> 48:32.140
 which have to travel elsewhere,

48:32.140 --> 48:34.300
 get broken down in mitochondria

48:34.300 --> 48:36.340
 and convert into ATP, et cetera,

48:37.320 --> 48:39.780
 used by the mitochondria rather,

48:39.780 --> 48:42.220
 brown fat is thermogenic.

48:42.220 --> 48:44.540
 It can actually use energy directly.

48:44.540 --> 48:46.860
 It skips a step and I don't want to get diverted

48:46.860 --> 48:49.780
 by going into all the biochemistry of it.

48:49.780 --> 48:52.180
 Beige fat is sort of in between.

48:52.180 --> 48:55.940
 It's white fat that could be brown fat

48:55.940 --> 48:58.180
 because it has some mitochondria in it,

48:58.180 --> 49:00.260
 but not as many as brown fat.

49:00.260 --> 49:03.100
 Now, cold exposure does several things.

49:03.100 --> 49:06.500
 Making ourselves cold can allow us

49:06.500 --> 49:09.060
 to build up mental resilience

49:09.060 --> 49:11.200
 because getting into cold of any kind,

49:11.200 --> 49:12.940
 doesn't matter if it's a cryo chamber,

49:12.940 --> 49:14.380
 doesn't matter if it's a cold day

49:14.380 --> 49:16.660
 and you forgot your sweater or your parka.

49:16.660 --> 49:19.300
 It doesn't matter if it's an ice bath

49:19.300 --> 49:22.160
 or you're lying down in the snow.

49:22.160 --> 49:26.200
 Cold causes the release of adrenaline from your adrenals

49:26.200 --> 49:28.900
 and it causes the release of epinephrine

49:28.900 --> 49:31.380
 from these neurons that connect to fat.

49:31.380 --> 49:36.380
 Now, the big effects of cold on metabolism and fat burning

49:38.540 --> 49:40.460
 are going to be through two routes.

49:40.460 --> 49:44.220
 One is that if you expose yourself to cold,

49:44.220 --> 49:49.020
 you have the opportunity to trigger activation of brown fat

49:49.020 --> 49:52.940
 as well as to convert more beige fat into true brown fat.

49:52.940 --> 49:57.620
 So you essentially create a stronger or a hotter furnace.

49:57.620 --> 49:59.160
 That's the way to think about brown fat.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.100
 It's like a furnace.

50:00.100 --> 50:02.580
 And so with this principle that we started with

50:02.580 --> 50:05.020
 of calories in versus calories burned,

50:05.020 --> 50:07.020
 what you're doing is you're increasing

50:07.020 --> 50:08.320
 the amount of burning,

50:08.320 --> 50:11.060
 you're increasing the burn of energy

50:11.060 --> 50:15.520
 by increasing the intensity of the heat inside you,

50:15.520 --> 50:16.740
 so to speak, okay?

50:16.740 --> 50:20.040
 I'm talking here kind of metaphorically.

50:20.040 --> 50:21.880
 Now, how can you do that?

50:21.880 --> 50:26.220
 Well, if you get into cold water or an ice bath

50:26.220 --> 50:30.100
 or a cold day and you try and remain calm

50:30.100 --> 50:35.100
 and resist shivering, you actually short circuit

50:35.300 --> 50:38.980
 this mechanism for increasing brown fat thermogenesis.

50:38.980 --> 50:42.600
 The paper published in Nature shows that it is shivering

50:42.600 --> 50:47.600
 itself that causes the brown fat to increase your burning,

50:49.020 --> 50:51.020
 your burn rate and your metabolism.

50:51.020 --> 50:52.260
 And it works like this.

50:52.260 --> 50:55.260
 When you get into cold and you shiver,

50:55.260 --> 50:58.560
 the shivering, that low level movement of the muscle,

50:58.560 --> 50:59.980
 those small movements,

50:59.980 --> 51:03.040
 triggers the release of a molecule called succinate,

51:03.040 --> 51:06.620
 S-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E, succinate.

51:06.620 --> 51:09.840
 And succinate acts on the brown fat

51:09.840 --> 51:13.700
 to increase brown fat thermogenesis and fat burning overall.

51:13.700 --> 51:15.560
 It actually increases body heat

51:15.560 --> 51:18.780
 through this brown fat thermogenesis pathway.

51:18.780 --> 51:23.220
 And it also over time can increase the amount of brown fat

51:23.220 --> 51:27.500
 by converting beige fat into true brown fat.

51:27.500 --> 51:31.360
 Now, how much cold exposure and how often, that's the key.

51:31.360 --> 51:36.360
 But before I give that detail or set of details,

51:37.060 --> 51:39.800
 remember if you resist the shiver,

51:39.800 --> 51:42.880
 you are not going to get the increased metabolic effect

51:42.880 --> 51:46.240
 because you are not going to get the succinate release.

51:46.240 --> 51:50.020
 So if you want to get your body heat,

51:50.020 --> 51:53.960
 your thermogenic level to go up, you need to shiver.

51:53.960 --> 51:55.320
 So now we have the NEET,

51:55.320 --> 51:57.480
 the non-exercise activity thermogenesis.

51:57.480 --> 51:59.840
 So low levels of activity as I described before,

51:59.840 --> 52:01.720
 which are done away from cold,

52:01.720 --> 52:03.000
 maybe do them in cold as well,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.600
 as well as shiver in response to cold.

52:05.600 --> 52:08.280
 And so the shiver itself is valuable

52:08.280 --> 52:09.600
 for triggering the release of succinate.

52:09.600 --> 52:12.120
 In fact, succinate is being evolved now

52:12.120 --> 52:13.920
 by various drug manufacturers

52:13.920 --> 52:15.720
 as a potential treatment for obesity,

52:15.720 --> 52:17.460
 although it hasn't really hit the market

52:17.460 --> 52:19.720
 in its final form yet.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.440
 Succinate is powerful for its effects on brown fat.

52:24.060 --> 52:26.080
 So how many times a week

52:26.080 --> 52:27.640
 do you need to expose yourself to cold?

52:27.640 --> 52:30.600
 Well, depend on how much fat you're trying to lose

52:30.600 --> 52:33.900
 and how much you're trying to increase your metabolism.

52:33.900 --> 52:37.800
 There are studies that describe positive effects on fat loss

52:37.800 --> 52:39.360
 of exposing yourself to cold,

52:39.360 --> 52:42.400
 either through cold shower or through ice bath

52:42.400 --> 52:43.480
 or other cold water.

52:43.480 --> 52:44.860
 It doesn't have to actually have ice in it

52:44.860 --> 52:48.380
 provided it's cold enough for any time,

52:48.380 --> 52:52.160
 anywhere, excuse me, between one and five times per week.

52:52.160 --> 52:54.380
 But it turns out that just one exposure per week

52:54.380 --> 52:55.840
 can be valuable.

52:55.840 --> 52:58.360
 The question then is how long

52:58.360 --> 53:00.520
 to get into that cold environment

53:00.520 --> 53:04.040
 and how cold should that environment be?

53:04.040 --> 53:05.240
 So first let's talk about

53:05.240 --> 53:07.500
 how long to get into that cold environment.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.280
 The answer here might be a little bit different

53:10.280 --> 53:12.280
 than you might imagine.

53:12.280 --> 53:13.240
 Most of you might think,

53:13.240 --> 53:16.000
 oh, well, if one minute is good, three minutes is better,

53:16.000 --> 53:19.640
 and if three minutes is better, then 10 minutes is best.

53:19.640 --> 53:22.720
 But remember, the goal is to get

53:22.720 --> 53:25.060
 the shiver-induced release of succinate

53:25.060 --> 53:27.260
 so that succinate can trigger the brown fat.

53:30.060 --> 53:33.440
 It turns out that if you want to trigger the shiver,

53:33.440 --> 53:36.600
 what you want to do is to get into the cold

53:36.600 --> 53:41.120
 and then get out of the cold and typically not dry off

53:41.120 --> 53:43.640
 and then get back into the cold and out of the cold.

53:43.640 --> 53:46.120
 That will definitely stimulate more shivering

53:46.120 --> 53:48.360
 than just getting into the cold itself.

53:48.360 --> 53:49.640
 So what I'm not referring to

53:49.640 --> 53:51.900
 is getting into the cold environment like an ice bath

53:51.900 --> 53:55.860
 and waiting until you shiver and staying there shivering.

53:55.860 --> 53:57.580
 You also don't want to get hypothermic,

53:57.580 --> 53:58.500
 and I want to be clear,

53:58.500 --> 54:01.040
 you want to get approval from your doctor

54:01.040 --> 54:02.340
 before you do any of this.

54:03.720 --> 54:06.020
 When you get into cold water,

54:06.020 --> 54:07.720
 there are two factors that will dictate

54:07.720 --> 54:10.040
 whether or not you shiver, probably three,

54:10.040 --> 54:11.440
 but let's just talk about the main two.

54:11.440 --> 54:12.600
 One is how cold it is.

54:12.600 --> 54:13.640
 So how cold should it be?

54:13.640 --> 54:16.580
 And look, if you get into water that's very, very cold,

54:16.580 --> 54:18.000
 it can actually shock your heart.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.440
 It can actually give you a heart attack

54:19.440 --> 54:22.100
 if it's truly, truly ice cold

54:22.100 --> 54:23.760
 and you're not adapted to that.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.880
 So proceed with caution, please.

54:25.880 --> 54:29.080
 I'm not a physician and I don't want to see anyone get hurt.

54:31.920 --> 54:33.840
 Just cold enough to be uncomfortable

54:33.840 --> 54:35.640
 is a good place to start.

54:35.640 --> 54:38.200
 So for some of you, that's going to be 60 degrees.

54:38.200 --> 54:40.200
 For some of you, that's going to be 55 degrees.

54:40.200 --> 54:44.120
 For some of you, it's going to be high 30s, right?

54:44.120 --> 54:45.720
 Depends on how cold adapted you are

54:45.720 --> 54:49.320
 and people vary in terms of how well they tolerate the cold.

54:49.320 --> 54:51.120
 So what you need to do is find a temperature

54:51.120 --> 54:54.080
 that you can get into one to five,

54:54.080 --> 54:55.680
 probably one to three times a week

54:55.680 --> 54:58.160
 if you really want this to accelerate fat loss

54:58.160 --> 55:00.400
 and you want to get in until you just start to shiver

55:00.400 --> 55:03.780
 and then you want to get out and not dry off.

55:03.780 --> 55:07.240
 Wait anywhere from one to three minutes

55:07.240 --> 55:10.020
 and then get back into the cold.

55:10.020 --> 55:12.560
 Now you'll notice when you get back into the cold,

55:12.560 --> 55:14.520
 it'll almost seem soothing.

55:14.520 --> 55:16.640
 It might actually not induce shiver.

55:16.640 --> 55:19.440
 It might take away the shiver that you had.

55:19.440 --> 55:22.840
 So here's a potential kind of sets reps protocol

55:22.840 --> 55:23.840
 that you can play with.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.800
 Find a temperature that induces shiver for you.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.020
 That's going to vary depending on your cold tolerance

55:28.020 --> 55:29.520
 and how cold adapted you are.

55:29.520 --> 55:32.000
 One to three, maybe five times a week,

55:32.000 --> 55:35.760
 get in until you or get under the shower or whatever it is

55:35.760 --> 55:38.940
 until you start to shiver, genuinely shiver.

55:38.940 --> 55:42.360
 Then after about a minute or so, get out,

55:42.360 --> 55:44.800
 spend one to three minutes out but don't dry off,

55:44.800 --> 55:48.600
 get back in for anywhere from one to three minutes

55:48.600 --> 55:51.440
 but try and access the shiver point again.

55:51.440 --> 55:53.880
 And you might do three repetitions of that.

55:53.880 --> 55:57.760
 So it's three times in and three times out total, okay?

55:57.760 --> 55:59.680
 That's a great starting place.

56:00.680 --> 56:05.360
 And what you don't want to do is build up your tolerance

56:05.360 --> 56:08.400
 to cold so fast that pretty soon you're able

56:08.400 --> 56:10.760
 to resist the shiver because remember the shiver

56:10.760 --> 56:12.360
 is the source of the succinate release

56:12.360 --> 56:14.940
 that will trigger brown fat thermogenesis.

56:14.940 --> 56:17.240
 So if you'd like to see this protocol spelled out,

56:17.240 --> 56:20.260
 you can access it zero cost at a website

56:20.260 --> 56:22.820
 which is thecoldplunge.com.

56:22.820 --> 56:26.040
 The Cold Plunge is a company, they make cold plunges

56:26.040 --> 56:27.680
 and they were kind enough to gift one

56:27.680 --> 56:29.680
 to the Huberman Lab podcast.

56:29.680 --> 56:31.680
 But I want to emphasize that these protocols

56:31.680 --> 56:32.720
 are free of cost.

56:32.720 --> 56:35.320
 The folks at the Cold Plunge are not just interested

56:35.320 --> 56:38.660
 in marketing their product but one of their main interests

56:38.660 --> 56:41.440
 is encouraging people to engage in cold exposure

56:41.440 --> 56:44.360
 for particular endpoints and goals like fat loss,

56:44.360 --> 56:48.800
 resilience, et cetera, resisting inflammation.

56:48.800 --> 56:53.560
 But their main focus is providing people protocols

56:53.560 --> 56:55.540
 and encouraging people to use cold exposure

56:55.540 --> 56:57.520
 of various kinds, not just through their products

56:57.520 --> 57:00.680
 but through cold rivers and jumps in the ocean

57:00.680 --> 57:04.600
 and things that cold showers, whatever is most convenient

57:04.600 --> 57:06.680
 and accessible for various people.

57:06.680 --> 57:09.120
 And so we needed a place where we could house

57:09.120 --> 57:11.400
 these protocols in a permanent way.

57:11.400 --> 57:13.940
 And not just for this episode,

57:13.940 --> 57:16.460
 so what they've agreed to do is to post the protocols there.

57:16.460 --> 57:18.920
 They should be very easy to find on their website.

57:18.920 --> 57:22.040
 This particular protocol we're referring to

57:22.040 --> 57:26.700
 as the fat loss optimization protocol

57:26.700 --> 57:28.200
 for lack of a better name.

57:28.200 --> 57:31.040
 And it's really grounded in how cold can be used

57:31.040 --> 57:32.360
 to induce shiver.

57:32.360 --> 57:33.600
 And again, it doesn't really matter

57:33.600 --> 57:35.640
 how you're accessing that cold

57:35.640 --> 57:37.360
 provided you access the shiver

57:37.360 --> 57:39.480
 and you're moving from the cold environment

57:39.480 --> 57:41.480
 to a slightly warmer environment.

57:41.480 --> 57:42.960
 So getting out of the cold shower

57:42.960 --> 57:45.400
 or getting out of the ice bath, et cetera

57:45.400 --> 57:47.880
 or out of the cold plunge and then back in

57:47.880 --> 57:49.720
 because it turns out that the cooling

57:49.720 --> 57:54.680
 and rewarming process of the body is where shiver kicks in.

57:54.680 --> 57:57.280
 And so that's distinctly different

57:57.280 --> 57:58.860
 than just trying to get into the cold

57:58.860 --> 58:01.360
 and stay in the cold for as long as possible.

58:01.360 --> 58:03.280
 And if you zoom out a little bit

58:03.280 --> 58:06.140
 and think about some examples in life,

58:06.140 --> 58:09.080
 you'll understand why that must be the case.

58:09.080 --> 58:12.720
 For instance, people who do a lot of cold water swims,

58:12.720 --> 58:14.080
 you have these polar bear clubs,

58:14.080 --> 58:15.800
 I think they call themselves,

58:15.800 --> 58:17.080
 do these cold water swims.

58:17.080 --> 58:18.280
 I would sometimes see these people

58:18.280 --> 58:20.640
 swimming back and forth to Alcatraz and stuff like that,

58:20.640 --> 58:22.420
 which just seems risky.

58:22.420 --> 58:24.800
 And they tell me it's very stimulating

58:24.800 --> 58:26.220
 for the mind and body, great.

58:26.220 --> 58:28.560
 Sometimes those people are very lean,

58:28.560 --> 58:30.320
 oftentimes they're not.

58:30.320 --> 58:33.080
 And they're getting a lot of cold exposure.

58:33.080 --> 58:35.280
 And one of the things that happens

58:35.280 --> 58:37.580
 is if you expose yourself to cold over and over,

58:37.580 --> 58:39.400
 you adapt, you become cold adapted.

58:39.400 --> 58:41.960
 And when you do that, you no longer get the epinephrine,

58:41.960 --> 58:44.280
 the adrenaline release from the cold.

58:44.280 --> 58:46.800
 And therefore you don't get the succinate release

58:46.800 --> 58:49.760
 and the shivering and the brown fat thermogenic effect

58:49.760 --> 58:51.300
 quite as intensely.

58:51.300 --> 58:53.940
 So if you want to use cold for other reasons,

58:53.940 --> 58:55.920
 and certainly cold water swims can be fun

58:55.920 --> 58:59.420
 and as long as you can do them safely, they're great.

58:59.420 --> 59:00.920
 I've gotten into cold water swimming

59:00.920 --> 59:02.580
 for some period of time.

59:02.580 --> 59:04.440
 You can use cold for resilience, et cetera.

59:04.440 --> 59:07.680
 But if you want to use cold to increase fat loss,

59:07.680 --> 59:10.600
 then getting this shiver process going,

59:10.600 --> 59:12.280
 the cooling and rewarming,

59:12.280 --> 59:13.960
 which accelerates the amount

59:13.960 --> 59:15.560
 or increases the amount of shiver,

59:15.560 --> 59:17.840
 that's going to be the way to go.

59:17.840 --> 59:19.920
 One note about cold and some of the factors

59:19.920 --> 59:21.340
 that it releases.

59:21.340 --> 59:23.360
 A few years back, there was a lot of excitement

59:23.360 --> 59:27.320
 about this hormone called irisin, I-R-I-S-I-N,

59:27.320 --> 59:29.640
 which was associated with cold.

59:29.640 --> 59:32.760
 And there was a lot of excitement about its potential role

59:32.760 --> 59:34.460
 in increasing metabolism,

59:34.460 --> 59:37.520
 so much so that people were starting to explore this

59:37.520 --> 59:39.360
 as a potential fat loss drug.

59:39.360 --> 59:41.680
 To my knowledge, that went nowhere.

59:41.680 --> 59:44.960
 The science eventually shifted over to succinate

59:44.960 --> 59:49.000
 as the main factor in cold-induced thermogenesis

59:49.000 --> 59:50.680
 through this brown fat pathway.

59:50.680 --> 59:52.200
 But if anyone out there is aware

59:52.200 --> 59:53.960
 of any positive effects of irisin

59:53.960 --> 59:57.880
 or of any science of irisin that I'm overlooking here

59:57.880 --> 59:59.840
 or that I'm speaking about incorrectly, please let me know.

59:59.840 --> 1:00:02.240
 I'd be very curious to learn.

1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:06.820
 Now, I want to just talk about brown fat a little bit more

1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:09.480
 and talk about a period in your life

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:12.280
 in which you were rich with brown fat,

1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:13.880
 you had a ton of brown fat,

1:00:13.880 --> 1:00:16.280
 and that's when you were a baby.

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:18.220
 Babies can't shiver.

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:23.880
 These neurons that release epinephrine into fat

1:00:23.880 --> 1:00:27.800
 are not wired up and really aren't present

1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:30.760
 at sufficient levels or in sufficient numbers

1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:32.280
 when you are a baby,

1:00:32.280 --> 1:00:35.120
 and therefore you can't shiver as a baby

1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:36.400
 and you can't warm yourself up

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:38.840
 in cold environments very well.

1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:40.280
 To compensate for that,

1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:44.140
 mother nature installed in all of us

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:47.240
 an excess of brown fat early in life

1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:49.500
 that exists again in the upper back,

1:00:49.500 --> 1:00:52.160
 in the middle of the back, and the back of the neck.

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:57.200
 Over time, if we don't expose ourselves to cold environments

1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:00.200
 or do other things that make us shiver,

1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:02.640
 we lose a lot of that brown fat.

1:01:02.640 --> 1:01:04.200
 But what's interesting about brown fat

1:01:04.200 --> 1:01:06.760
 is that there's some evidence that brown fat,

1:01:06.760 --> 1:01:11.680
 just like white fat, can both increase in size,

1:01:11.680 --> 1:01:14.240
 but that you can also add new cells.

1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:15.640
 Now, this is a little bit controversial.

1:01:15.640 --> 1:01:17.920
 People always say you can't change the number of fat cells.

1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:21.160
 You can just shrink them or increase their size.

1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:24.600
 Well, it turns out that epinephrine released

1:01:24.600 --> 1:01:27.400
 from these little nerve endings in brown fat

1:01:27.400 --> 1:01:30.720
 and succinate circulating in the body may,

1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:32.120
 and I want to underscore may,

1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:35.360
 have the effect of increasing the amount of brown fat cells

1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:40.320
 probably by converting these beige fat cells into brown fat.

1:01:40.320 --> 1:01:43.260
 So that allows us to become much as we were early in life

1:01:43.260 --> 1:01:45.560
 where we metabolized like crazy

1:01:45.560 --> 1:01:48.600
 and we'd heat ourselves up without shivering.

1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:51.640
 Some people have taken the cold thing to the extreme,

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:53.640
 putting ice packs on the back of their neck

1:01:53.640 --> 1:01:55.080
 throughout the day,

1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:58.080
 did a episode all about testosterone and estrogen,

1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:02.120
 and there's this, let's just call it a very niche,

1:02:02.120 --> 1:02:04.760
 I have to imagine very, very niche culture of people

1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:07.560
 who are wearing literally, I'm not joking,

1:02:07.560 --> 1:02:10.840
 they are these cool pack ice pack underpants.

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:12.720
 They go by a name that I'm not going to repeat on here,

1:02:12.720 --> 1:02:14.340
 but you can find them on Amazon.

1:02:14.340 --> 1:02:18.000
 Those are people that are using cold packs on the body

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:21.020
 and on the groin to try and increase things like testosterone

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:24.840
 but as well to try and increase thermogenesis

1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:27.400
 and trying to increase their metabolism.

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:30.280
 Just remember, if you become cold adapted,

1:02:30.280 --> 1:02:32.160
 you're not going to get the fat burning effects

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:33.280
 to the same degree.

1:02:33.280 --> 1:02:36.080
 So cold is a powerful tool for fat loss,

1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:37.540
 but you don't want to adapt.

1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:40.900
 This is reminiscent of a rule that you hear about

1:02:40.900 --> 1:02:44.000
 in endurance exercise and in strength exercise as well,

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:47.760
 which is that you want to use the minimal effective stimulus

1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:49.800
 to promote growth or progress,

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:52.920
 so growth of the muscle or improvements in endurance.

1:02:52.920 --> 1:02:57.880
 If you go 10% further on a run or 10% faster,

1:02:57.880 --> 1:03:00.480
 you will likely see an improvement in performance

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:02.480
 provided you recovery the next time you come back

1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:05.580
 and do that same round of exercise.

1:03:05.580 --> 1:03:06.900
 You'll be able to do more work

1:03:06.900 --> 1:03:08.800
 or complete the work more easily, et cetera.

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:09.700
 You've adapted.

1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:15.360
 If you do 20% more distance or 20% more weight,

1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:19.400
 you won't necessarily see the same commiserate level

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:21.280
 of gain or improvement.

1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:23.400
 And so likewise with cold,

1:03:23.400 --> 1:03:25.920
 if you're quickly moving from 30 seconds of exposure

1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:27.280
 to 10 minutes of exposure,

1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:29.400
 you're overlooking the opportunity

1:03:29.400 --> 1:03:33.360
 to get the most fat loss and increase in metabolism

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:36.540
 by stepping it up in smaller increments, okay?

1:03:36.540 --> 1:03:39.360
 And this also speaks to the rationale

1:03:39.360 --> 1:03:42.020
 for using cold exposure to accelerate fat loss

1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:43.120
 for certain periods,

1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:45.480
 but then maybe not doing it year round

1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:47.120
 if fat loss is your goal.

1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:49.520
 Maybe use it for two, three months at a time

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:51.200
 and then stop for two, three months at a time

1:03:51.200 --> 1:03:52.800
 because it is such a potent stimulus

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:56.400
 provided you engage in the shiver.

1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:58.720
 Next, I'd like to move to exercise

1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:02.300
 and how particular timing and types of exercise

1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:05.120
 can vastly improve fat loss.

1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:05.960
 Before I do that,

1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:08.740
 I just want to mention a really important reference

1:04:08.740 --> 1:04:10.040
 for those of you that are interested

1:04:10.040 --> 1:04:13.780
 in learning more about how neurons connect to fat.

1:04:13.780 --> 1:04:16.280
 This is certainly a paper that you'd want to look at

1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:19.100
 if you're interested in diving deep into the literature

1:04:19.100 --> 1:04:21.080
 and reading all the various studies.

1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:23.500
 It's a review and the title of the review

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:26.200
 is neural innervation of white adipose tissue

1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:28.660
 and the control of lipolysis.

1:04:28.660 --> 1:04:30.800
 That's neural innervation of white adipose tissue

1:04:30.800 --> 1:04:32.320
 and the control of lipolysis.

1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:35.640
 It was published in Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology.

1:04:35.640 --> 1:04:37.280
 You can find that free online.

1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:39.080
 They have the full text available.

1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:43.120
 The first author is Bartnes, B-A-R-T-N-E-S-S.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:44.640
 It's a great review.

1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:46.180
 And I've talked about a number of things

1:04:46.180 --> 1:04:47.720
 that are mentioned in the review.

1:04:47.720 --> 1:04:49.680
 Follow the references in that review

1:04:49.680 --> 1:04:51.520
 and the reference trail, as we say,

1:04:51.520 --> 1:04:53.480
 if you're interested in learning more about

1:04:53.480 --> 1:04:56.600
 also how neurons control brown fat.

1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:58.440
 And before I move to exercise,

1:04:58.440 --> 1:05:00.260
 I also just want to highlight something

1:05:00.260 --> 1:05:02.000
 that comes up every few years

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:06.260
 and has largely been considered myth now,

1:05:06.260 --> 1:05:09.040
 but that is actually more interesting

1:05:09.040 --> 1:05:10.800
 than most people might think,

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:13.800
 which is this issue of spot reduction.

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:17.880
 In the 80s and 90s, there were a lot of commercials,

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:21.320
 late night infomercials where they would talk

1:05:21.320 --> 1:05:22.600
 about spot reduction.

1:05:22.600 --> 1:05:25.580
 If you do sit-ups, will you lose abdominal fat?

1:05:25.580 --> 1:05:27.520
 If you do hip raises or glute raises,

1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:29.560
 will you lose glute and hip fat?

1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:33.340
 And I think everybody now believes that

1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:36.360
 and understands that fat metabolism

1:05:36.360 --> 1:05:38.840
 is something that happens systemically throughout the body,

1:05:38.840 --> 1:05:40.460
 that some body fat is quote unquote,

1:05:40.460 --> 1:05:41.740
 more stubborn than others.

1:05:41.740 --> 1:05:44.620
 Everyone varies in where they tend to store fat

1:05:44.620 --> 1:05:46.560
 or lose fat last.

1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:48.420
 Number of factors that influence that

1:05:48.420 --> 1:05:51.320
 and in particular hormone receptors.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:56.320
 But now, at least in the scientific literature,

1:05:57.120 --> 1:05:59.480
 spot reduction and the possibility

1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:01.740
 of real true spot reduction,

1:06:01.740 --> 1:06:03.920
 reductions in fat in a targeted way,

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:06.900
 a body part or body area targeted way

1:06:06.900 --> 1:06:11.720
 is becoming more of a reality and may be a reality soon

1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:16.720
 because exercise that triggers the activation

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:20.840
 of these nerve fibers, these neurons that innervate fat,

1:06:20.840 --> 1:06:24.480
 in theory, if you can increase the amount

1:06:24.480 --> 1:06:28.300
 of epinephrine released at those particular fat pads,

1:06:28.300 --> 1:06:30.360
 as they're called, they're actually called fat pads

1:06:30.360 --> 1:06:32.320
 in the scientific literature,

1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:35.760
 in theory, you could increase mobilization

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:39.560
 from those particular body fat sites.

1:06:39.560 --> 1:06:44.220
 So because the new view, the modern understanding

1:06:44.220 --> 1:06:46.940
 is that it's not adrenaline released systemically

1:06:46.940 --> 1:06:49.840
 kind of bathing all your fat tissue,

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:52.400
 but rather it's neurons releasing adrenaline,

1:06:52.400 --> 1:06:55.020
 epinephrine locally, that in theory,

1:06:55.960 --> 1:06:59.240
 exercise that stimulates the release of epinephrine

1:06:59.240 --> 1:07:02.920
 or exercise coupled with things like shiver

1:07:02.920 --> 1:07:05.820
 or low grade shaking movement or the NEET,

1:07:05.820 --> 1:07:10.820
 the non-exercise activity thermogenesis could in theory lead

1:07:11.400 --> 1:07:16.400
 to local enhancement of mobilization of fat tissue.

1:07:16.620 --> 1:07:19.780
 So I think that spot reduction actually will soon

1:07:19.780 --> 1:07:21.200
 be something that's possible

1:07:21.200 --> 1:07:23.260
 using the appropriate technology.

1:07:23.260 --> 1:07:24.820
 What does this mean for you now?

1:07:24.820 --> 1:07:28.860
 What could you possibly do with this information now?

1:07:28.860 --> 1:07:33.200
 Well, I think it speaks to the fact

1:07:33.200 --> 1:07:36.940
 that if one is going to engage in exercise,

1:07:36.940 --> 1:07:39.800
 that doing exercises that involve lots

1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:42.960
 of different body parts and movements

1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:46.220
 is likely to encourage the maintenance

1:07:46.220 --> 1:07:48.920
 and or growth of these neurons

1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:50.980
 that innervate fat throughout the body.

1:07:50.980 --> 1:07:53.880
 What this means is changing up the pattern of exercise,

1:07:53.880 --> 1:07:56.400
 engaging in novel types of movements

1:07:56.400 --> 1:07:59.020
 may actually be one way that one can access

1:07:59.020 --> 1:08:01.960
 these so-called stubborn body fat pads.

1:08:01.960 --> 1:08:03.420
 Now there's a little bit of speculation

1:08:03.420 --> 1:08:04.940
 in the statement that I'm making,

1:08:04.940 --> 1:08:06.440
 but if you think about it, it makes sense.

1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:07.980
 If you become very adapted

1:08:07.980 --> 1:08:10.580
 to a particular pattern of exercise,

1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:12.660
 whether or not you're subcaloric or not,

1:08:12.660 --> 1:08:14.500
 you're in maintenance calories or not,

1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:18.580
 you are oxidizing some fat always,

1:08:18.580 --> 1:08:22.320
 and you're utilizing the neurons that innervate fat

1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:24.500
 in a regular way and pretty soon,

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:27.580
 this innervation is going to shut off

1:08:27.580 --> 1:08:30.940
 because there's no reason why this neural innervation

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:33.620
 of fat should continue to release epinephrine

1:08:33.620 --> 1:08:35.860
 unless you give it a strong stimulus like cold

1:08:35.860 --> 1:08:38.780
 or the fidgeting or in this case

1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:41.200
 to do novel forms of exercise.

1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:44.300
 And there's some anecdotal evidence

1:08:44.300 --> 1:08:46.000
 and there I don't even want to call it data,

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:47.540
 but anecdotal evidence that people

1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:50.140
 who have quote unquote stubborn body fat,

1:08:50.140 --> 1:08:52.760
 if they start to adopt new patterns of exercise,

1:08:52.760 --> 1:08:56.100
 they can start to access those stubborn fat pads.

1:08:56.100 --> 1:08:57.900
 And again, fat pads is the correct way

1:08:57.900 --> 1:09:00.780
 to refer to these in the scientific literature.

1:09:00.780 --> 1:09:04.140
 So what we're focusing on today is the fact

1:09:04.140 --> 1:09:08.140
 that fat indeed will be mobilized and oxidized

1:09:08.140 --> 1:09:10.460
 in response to a deficit in calories,

1:09:10.460 --> 1:09:13.840
 but that the way that neurons control those fat pads

1:09:13.840 --> 1:09:17.800
 and those body fat stores afford you a lot more control

1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:20.520
 than perhaps you ever previously thought.

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:22.700
 So let's talk about movement

1:09:22.700 --> 1:09:24.380
 and the more traditional kinds of movement,

1:09:24.380 --> 1:09:26.940
 AKA exercise, has been shown to lead

1:09:26.940 --> 1:09:30.280
 to increases in metabolism and fat loss,

1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:33.120
 to greater degrees, depending on whether or not,

1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:36.020
 for instance, you're fasted when you do it or not,

1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:37.700
 whether or not you do your cardio first

1:09:37.700 --> 1:09:39.780
 or your resistance training first.

1:09:39.780 --> 1:09:42.160
 And this is, again, in the literature

1:09:42.160 --> 1:09:43.900
 for which there's a lot of controversy,

1:09:43.900 --> 1:09:47.020
 but in digging through all the studies on this,

1:09:47.020 --> 1:09:49.480
 we're finally starting to arrive at a consensus

1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:51.660
 of when is best to do exercise

1:09:51.660 --> 1:09:55.940
 and what types of exercise to do if your goal is fat loss.

1:09:55.940 --> 1:09:59.460
 The topic of exercise is a kind of controversial one,

1:09:59.460 --> 1:10:01.460
 not as controversial as nutrition and diet,

1:10:01.460 --> 1:10:03.740
 which we will talk about in a few minutes,

1:10:03.740 --> 1:10:06.820
 but it's a particularly interesting one

1:10:06.820 --> 1:10:08.820
 because different types of exercise

1:10:08.820 --> 1:10:11.020
 engage the musculature of the body

1:10:11.020 --> 1:10:13.540
 and the heart and the lungs in different ways

1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:15.300
 and can have vastly different effects

1:10:15.300 --> 1:10:17.420
 on things like hormones and metabolism,

1:10:17.420 --> 1:10:19.860
 depending on whether or not it's of high intensity,

1:10:19.860 --> 1:10:22.300
 moderate intensity, or low intensity.

1:10:22.300 --> 1:10:24.580
 So rather than think about weight training

1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:27.060
 versus cardiovascular exercise,

1:10:27.060 --> 1:10:29.860
 I think the most simple way,

1:10:29.860 --> 1:10:33.740
 the most fluid way to have this conversation about exercise

1:10:33.740 --> 1:10:38.120
 and fat loss is in terms of three general types of training,

1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:40.140
 whether or not it's done with weights or body weight

1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:42.120
 doesn't really matter.

1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:45.020
 And those are high intensity interval training,

1:10:45.020 --> 1:10:47.380
 something that seems to have gained a lot of popularity

1:10:47.380 --> 1:10:49.820
 in recent years, so-called HIIT, H-I-I-T,

1:10:49.820 --> 1:10:52.220
 so high intensity interval training,

1:10:52.220 --> 1:10:53.980
 sprint interval training,

1:10:53.980 --> 1:10:57.020
 so that's going to be very high intensity or S-I-T,

1:10:57.020 --> 1:11:01.220
 or moderate intensity continuous training, M-I-C-T.

1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:05.780
 So we've got HIIT, SIT, and MICT, M-I-C-T.

1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:08.880
 And we can get a little bit more precise if you'd like.

1:11:08.880 --> 1:11:11.220
 I'm not somebody who measures my VO2 max or anything

1:11:11.220 --> 1:11:13.500
 while I exercise, I generally know

1:11:13.500 --> 1:11:14.620
 whether or not I'm doing something

1:11:14.620 --> 1:11:16.260
 I could continue for a very long time

1:11:16.260 --> 1:11:18.300
 or whether or not I'm doing something that

1:11:19.540 --> 1:11:22.380
 I realize is going to be of short duration, high intensity.

1:11:22.380 --> 1:11:26.340
 But if you'd like to map this to VO2 max,

1:11:26.340 --> 1:11:29.420
 SIT, this sprint interval training

1:11:29.420 --> 1:11:31.040
 was defined as all out,

1:11:31.040 --> 1:11:34.240
 greater than 100% of VO2 max bursts of activity

1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:36.980
 that lasts eight to 30 seconds,

1:11:36.980 --> 1:11:39.100
 interspersed with less intense recovery periods.

1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:43.180
 So this would be sprinting downfield for eight to 30 seconds

1:11:43.180 --> 1:11:46.460
 then maybe walking back for about a minute or two

1:11:46.460 --> 1:11:48.220
 and then sprinting again and then continuing.

1:11:48.220 --> 1:11:49.500
 So that would be SIT.

1:11:49.500 --> 1:11:53.260
 HIIT, H-I-I-T, is defined as submaximal,

1:11:53.260 --> 1:11:57.020
 so 80 to 100% of VO2 max bursts of activity

1:11:57.020 --> 1:12:00.300
 that lasts 60 to 240 seconds

1:12:00.300 --> 1:12:02.840
 interspersed with less intense recovery periods.

1:12:02.840 --> 1:12:04.980
 So on a standard 400 meter track,

1:12:04.980 --> 1:12:07.500
 just to give us a little bit of a visual,

1:12:07.500 --> 1:12:10.340
 you'll one, a four minute mile would be fantastic

1:12:10.340 --> 1:12:11.220
 for most people,

1:12:11.220 --> 1:12:13.220
 although people run faster than that, of course.

1:12:13.220 --> 1:12:15.300
 So that's four 60 second laps,

1:12:15.300 --> 1:12:17.480
 but that's back to back to back.

1:12:17.480 --> 1:12:20.740
 I think in my best shape or maybe it was in my dreams,

1:12:20.740 --> 1:12:21.560
 I don't recall which,

1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:23.800
 I was able to do 60 seconds around the track,

1:12:23.800 --> 1:12:24.740
 but of course I couldn't get that

1:12:24.740 --> 1:12:26.900
 on the second or third or fourth.

1:12:26.900 --> 1:12:31.900
 If I did, that was certainly in fantasy land and not reality

1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:35.600
 but 60 seconds would be about one revolution

1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:37.640
 around the track, maybe 90 seconds,

1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:40.160
 depending on how fast one is running.

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:44.620
 So 60 to 240 seconds, MICT, okay?

1:12:44.620 --> 1:12:47.520
 This moderate intensity continuous training

1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:49.180
 is steady state cardio,

1:12:49.180 --> 1:12:51.440
 sometimes called zone two cardio these days

1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:52.620
 on the internet,

1:12:52.620 --> 1:12:55.620
 which is performed continuously for 20 to 60 minutes

1:12:55.620 --> 1:13:00.020
 at moderate intensity of 40 to 60% of VO2 max,

1:13:00.020 --> 1:13:01.900
 or if you prefer heart rate,

1:13:01.900 --> 1:13:05.820
 55 to 70% of max heart rate, okay?

1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:07.960
 So we can think about high, medium,

1:13:07.960 --> 1:13:09.560
 and low intensity exercise.

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:12.340
 Although low intensity usually means

1:13:12.340 --> 1:13:13.900
 that you could carry on a conversation

1:13:13.900 --> 1:13:16.480
 or maybe you'd have to gasp every few steps or so

1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:17.920
 while trying to talk and run.

1:13:17.920 --> 1:13:20.320
 That's, I think, going to be the most useful way

1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:23.120
 to have this conversation that we're having now

1:13:23.120 --> 1:13:25.140
 because there's so many different forms of exercise

1:13:25.140 --> 1:13:27.600
 that people do and intensity is important.

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:31.240
 Let's ask the question that I think many of people

1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:34.960
 are wondering about, which is, is it better,

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.480
 meaning do you burn more fat

1:13:36.480 --> 1:13:38.480
 if you do your exercise fasted?

1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:41.200
 And fasted in this respect could be

1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:42.520
 that you wake up in the morning,

1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:44.000
 you've been fasting all night,

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:47.000
 you just hydrate and you exercise,

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.700
 or sometimes people will ingest caffeine,

1:13:49.700 --> 1:13:51.180
 there's controversy as to whether or not

1:13:51.180 --> 1:13:52.760
 that quote unquote breaks the fast,

1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:54.600
 has to do with whether or not your caffeine adapted

1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:57.200
 something for another episode.

1:13:57.200 --> 1:13:58.960
 In any case, that would be fasted.

1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:00.940
 So probably not having eaten anything

1:14:00.940 --> 1:14:05.040
 for anywhere from three to 24 hours or maybe even more.

1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:06.800
 As you could also be fasted in the afternoon

1:14:06.800 --> 1:14:10.080
 if you had lunch at noon and it's four or five or 6 p.m.,

1:14:10.080 --> 1:14:13.840
 is it, will you burn more fat if you exercise

1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:16.840
 without eating anything first,

1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:18.920
 without ingesting any calories first?

1:14:18.920 --> 1:14:20.680
 And people have tried to really split hairs

1:14:20.680 --> 1:14:21.600
 on this every which way.

1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:23.680
 People say, well, you can fat fast

1:14:23.680 --> 1:14:25.760
 because fat and protein doesn't lead

1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:30.760
 to as great increases in insulin as other things.

1:14:30.760 --> 1:14:33.000
 Maybe you can have a few almonds and then still train.

1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:38.000
 And indeed, insulin will prevent fat oxidation.

1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:39.640
 I want to be really clear.

1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:41.480
 The burning part of fat in the cell,

1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:45.600
 the movement of the fatty acid into mitochondria

1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:49.080
 and the conversion to ATP, insulin inhibits that process.

1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:52.480
 However, it's been shown

1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:55.320
 that at least for short periods of training,

1:14:55.320 --> 1:14:57.160
 it doesn't really seem to matter

1:14:57.160 --> 1:15:00.260
 whether or not you eat before training or you don't

1:15:00.260 --> 1:15:02.800
 if your goal is fat oxidation.

1:15:02.800 --> 1:15:04.580
 Now, I want to put an asterisk near that

1:15:04.580 --> 1:15:05.960
 because there are some exceptions,

1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:08.400
 but there were several studies done

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:12.540
 that, and kind of the classic ones of these,

1:15:12.540 --> 1:15:14.160
 I'll read out to you.

1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:18.200
 What they basically did is they gave people glucose sugar

1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:21.900
 to increase their blood sugar before training or not.

1:15:21.900 --> 1:15:25.880
 And the kind of classic study of this is Alborg et al.

1:15:25.880 --> 1:15:28.040
 So in 1976, so it goes way back,

1:15:28.040 --> 1:15:31.360
 which is that glucose reduces fat burning and exercise.

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:33.640
 And then some other studies, if you want to look these up,

1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:35.120
 they're very easy to find on PubMed.

1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:40.120
 You put in Horowitz, 1999, Lee et al. is another one

1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:43.600
 where they have people drink milk with glucose in it.

1:15:43.600 --> 1:15:47.460
 So sweet sugary milk before exercise, et cetera.

1:15:47.460 --> 1:15:49.920
 And you can find a number of examples

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:54.160
 where eating before exercise reduces the amount of fat

1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:56.780
 that's oxidized during the exercise.

1:15:56.780 --> 1:15:59.960
 And you can also find a lot of studies showing

1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:04.960
 that eating during exercise or prior to exercise

1:16:05.760 --> 1:16:08.480
 will not reduce the amount of fat that's oxidized.

1:16:08.480 --> 1:16:10.520
 However, the types of exercise,

1:16:10.520 --> 1:16:13.840
 whether that was medium intensity or high intensity

1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:16.280
 or low intensity is all over the map for these studies.

1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:19.680
 So it's very hard to target an ideal protocol.

1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:22.520
 And then if you look really deep in the literature,

1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.500
 you start to find meta-analyses

1:16:24.500 --> 1:16:27.660
 where people have actually aggregated all the findings

1:16:27.660 --> 1:16:30.000
 and some modern studies where it points

1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.400
 to some very specific and useful protocols.

1:16:32.400 --> 1:16:35.200
 And so here's the rule or the protocol

1:16:35.200 --> 1:16:37.380
 that I extracted from that literature.

1:16:37.380 --> 1:16:41.580
 At a period of about 90 minutes

1:16:42.620 --> 1:16:46.180
 of moderate intensity exercise, I want to be clear,

1:16:46.180 --> 1:16:51.180
 at about or after 90 minutes of moderate intensity exercise,

1:16:51.180 --> 1:16:53.580
 there's a switchover point

1:16:53.580 --> 1:16:57.040
 whereby if you ate before the exercise,

1:16:57.040 --> 1:17:01.380
 you will reduce, excuse me, you will burn far less fat

1:17:01.380 --> 1:17:04.280
 from the 90 minute point onward

1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:07.780
 than you would if you had gone into the training fasted.

1:17:07.780 --> 1:17:09.220
 So let me repeat that.

1:17:09.220 --> 1:17:10.680
 If it's moderate intensity,

1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:13.200
 so-called zone two cardio type exercise,

1:17:14.260 --> 1:17:16.680
 at the 90 minute point,

1:17:16.680 --> 1:17:19.340
 if you happen to have eaten before the exercise

1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:23.140
 within one to three hours prior to the exercise,

1:17:23.140 --> 1:17:25.580
 then you reduce the amount of fat

1:17:25.580 --> 1:17:29.000
 that you will burn from 90 minutes onward.

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:32.020
 Whereas if you had fasted prior to the exercise,

1:17:32.020 --> 1:17:33.980
 you hadn't eaten anything for three hours or more

1:17:33.980 --> 1:17:34.940
 prior to the exercise,

1:17:34.940 --> 1:17:38.400
 at the 90 minute point, 90 minutes of exercise,

1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:41.060
 you will start to burn more fat

1:17:41.060 --> 1:17:43.060
 than you would had you eaten.

1:17:43.060 --> 1:17:47.620
 Now, 90 minutes of moderate intensity exercise is a lot.

1:17:47.620 --> 1:17:49.700
 So that's a pretty long run.

1:17:49.700 --> 1:17:51.780
 Even if you're running at a pretty slow pace,

1:17:51.780 --> 1:17:55.380
 like a 10 or 12 minute mile, that's a lot of running.

1:17:55.380 --> 1:17:56.280
 That's a lot of swimming.

1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:57.780
 So that's a lot of walking.

1:17:57.780 --> 1:17:58.940
 That's a lot of hiking.

1:17:59.780 --> 1:18:02.020
 However, there are people who are going out hiking all day

1:18:02.020 --> 1:18:03.700
 or running all day or walking all day.

1:18:03.700 --> 1:18:07.000
 And if you want to burn more fat per unit time,

1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:08.300
 you want to oxidize more fat,

1:18:08.300 --> 1:18:10.360
 then you would do that fasted.

1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:14.700
 Now, there are also studies that point to the fact

1:18:14.700 --> 1:18:16.980
 that you don't have to wait to 90 minutes

1:18:16.980 --> 1:18:21.220
 in order to get this enhanced fat burning effect.

1:18:21.220 --> 1:18:23.540
 The studies I was able to find

1:18:23.540 --> 1:18:26.020
 and that looked to me like quality peer reviewed studies

1:18:26.020 --> 1:18:30.580
 with no company bias or no product bias of any kind.

1:18:30.580 --> 1:18:32.940
 These are studies that were largely funded

1:18:32.940 --> 1:18:37.940
 by the federal government in the university context

1:18:38.060 --> 1:18:42.300
 pointed to the fact that if one does high intensity training

1:18:42.300 --> 1:18:46.220
 or even the very high intensity forms of training

1:18:46.220 --> 1:18:48.620
 like sprints or squats or deadlifts

1:18:48.620 --> 1:18:51.340
 or any kind of activity that can't be maintained

1:18:51.340 --> 1:18:55.260
 for more than these eight or I would say up to 60 seconds.

1:18:55.260 --> 1:18:57.820
 So a set of lifting weights, repeated, repeated.

1:18:57.820 --> 1:19:01.420
 If that's done for anywhere from 20 minutes,

1:19:01.420 --> 1:19:03.780
 so weight training or powerlifting

1:19:03.780 --> 1:19:06.020
 or these kinds of things or kettlebell swings

1:19:06.020 --> 1:19:10.620
 or up to 60 minutes, well then the switchover point

1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:12.240
 in which you can burn more fat

1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:15.420
 if you go into that fasted comes earlier.

1:19:15.420 --> 1:19:17.860
 And this makes sense because there's nothing holy

1:19:17.860 --> 1:19:19.660
 about the 90 minute point

1:19:19.660 --> 1:19:23.140
 for medium intensity zone two cardio.

1:19:23.140 --> 1:19:27.940
 That 90 minute point is the point in which the body shifts

1:19:27.940 --> 1:19:32.060
 over from mainly burning glycogen, basically sugar

1:19:32.060 --> 1:19:34.460
 that comes from muscles or the liver

1:19:34.460 --> 1:19:37.580
 and realizes this is going on for a while.

1:19:37.580 --> 1:19:42.060
 I'm going to shift over to a storage site fuel

1:19:43.380 --> 1:19:46.460
 that is in reserve like body fat.

1:19:46.460 --> 1:19:47.740
 This is going to happen for a while.

1:19:47.740 --> 1:19:49.580
 So I'm going to start tapping into body fat stores.

1:19:49.580 --> 1:19:51.280
 Now fat doesn't have a little brain there.

1:19:51.280 --> 1:19:53.500
 It is innervated by neurons, but it doesn't have thoughts.

1:19:53.500 --> 1:19:56.100
 And you don't actually control this switch with your mind.

1:19:56.100 --> 1:19:58.440
 This is something that has to do with the milieu

1:19:58.440 --> 1:19:59.900
 of various hormones.

1:19:59.900 --> 1:20:03.820
 What has to happen is insulin has to go down far enough.

1:20:03.820 --> 1:20:05.700
 So if you ate before the exercise

1:20:05.700 --> 1:20:07.300
 you'd have an increase in insulin.

1:20:07.300 --> 1:20:08.300
 If you ate carbohydrates

1:20:08.300 --> 1:20:09.940
 you'd have a bigger increase in insulin.

1:20:09.940 --> 1:20:13.460
 Fat and proteins indeed will have lower amounts of insulin

1:20:13.460 --> 1:20:16.500
 and fasting will give you the lowest amount of insulin.

1:20:16.500 --> 1:20:19.780
 Well then that switchover point is going to come earlier

1:20:19.780 --> 1:20:20.940
 in the exercise.

1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:22.780
 And if you think about it

1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:24.340
 if you were to do something high intensity

1:20:24.340 --> 1:20:25.980
 for 20, 30, 40 minutes

1:20:25.980 --> 1:20:29.580
 so maybe lift weights and then get into zone two cardio.

1:20:29.580 --> 1:20:31.760
 If you were fasted, the literature says

1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:35.980
 that you're going to burn more body fat per unit time

1:20:35.980 --> 1:20:40.320
 than if you had eaten before or during the exercise.

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:41.160
 So what does this mean?

1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:43.420
 This means if you want to burn more body fat

1:20:43.420 --> 1:20:45.060
 if it's in your protocols

1:20:45.060 --> 1:20:47.700
 and you have been approved to do this safely

1:20:48.780 --> 1:20:53.160
 exercise intensely for 20 to 60 minutes

1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:54.380
 the higher the intensity

1:20:54.380 --> 1:20:56.500
 obviously the shorter that bout is going to be

1:20:56.500 --> 1:20:58.620
 and then move over into zone two cardio.

1:20:58.620 --> 1:21:00.040
 And if you do that fasted

1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:01.780
 or the medium intensity cardio, I should say

1:21:01.780 --> 1:21:04.420
 and if you do that fasted

1:21:04.420 --> 1:21:07.380
 then indeed you will burn a higher percentage of body fat.

1:21:08.740 --> 1:21:11.580
 If you need to eat or you like to eat before you train

1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:14.240
 that also can work.

1:21:14.240 --> 1:21:15.940
 And if you train very intensely

1:21:15.940 --> 1:21:16.980
 you're likely to shift over

1:21:16.980 --> 1:21:21.480
 to the fat burning pattern more quickly as well.

1:21:21.480 --> 1:21:23.340
 So again, this isn't really an issue

1:21:23.340 --> 1:21:25.620
 of how long you exercise.

1:21:25.620 --> 1:21:28.500
 It's an issue of how intensely you exercise

1:21:28.500 --> 1:21:31.420
 and therefore what fuel source you're drawing from.

1:21:31.420 --> 1:21:33.100
 So hopefully I've made that clear

1:21:33.100 --> 1:21:35.700
 but basically you need to deplete glycogen

1:21:35.700 --> 1:21:37.940
 or through high intensity exercise

1:21:37.940 --> 1:21:40.280
 and then move to a steady state exercise

1:21:40.280 --> 1:21:42.060
 that will allow you to burn more fat

1:21:42.060 --> 1:21:45.400
 or you need to perform a medium intensity

1:21:45.400 --> 1:21:47.940
 or low intensity type exercise for a long period of time

1:21:47.940 --> 1:21:49.980
 before you shift over to burning fat.

1:21:49.980 --> 1:21:53.200
 And indeed it seems that going into all that fasted

1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:56.620
 will facilitate the burning of more fat overall.

1:21:57.740 --> 1:21:59.820
 But if you can't even get to the exercise

1:21:59.820 --> 1:22:02.820
 if you're somebody who just can't do the training at all

1:22:02.820 --> 1:22:05.340
 you're unwilling to or you're incapable of training

1:22:06.260 --> 1:22:07.140
 unless you eat something

1:22:07.140 --> 1:22:09.220
 then obviously eating something makes the most sense

1:22:09.220 --> 1:22:10.660
 and what you eat prior to exercise

1:22:10.660 --> 1:22:13.860
 that's a whole other biz that people argue about

1:22:13.860 --> 1:22:16.260
 and fight about whether or not you should go into it

1:22:16.260 --> 1:22:19.060
 with low carbohydrates or higher carb or all of that.

1:22:19.060 --> 1:22:21.300
 But in general, the theme there is very simple

1:22:21.300 --> 1:22:23.660
 which is that you want insulin levels to be pretty low

1:22:23.660 --> 1:22:26.340
 if your goal is body fat reduction

1:22:26.340 --> 1:22:27.900
 if you want to oxidize body fat.

1:22:27.900 --> 1:22:30.540
 So fasting in some cases, fat fasting in other cases

1:22:30.540 --> 1:22:32.020
 where you're just ingesting fats,

1:22:32.020 --> 1:22:33.340
 fat and protein in some cases

1:22:33.340 --> 1:22:35.720
 or for some people it will be eating carbohydrates.

1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:39.100
 I'm not here to dictate a particular nutrition regimen

1:22:39.100 --> 1:22:41.220
 that's just how the hormone balance of these things

1:22:41.220 --> 1:22:43.180
 and fat oxidation works.

1:22:43.180 --> 1:22:44.820
 Now, one thing that's very interesting

1:22:44.820 --> 1:22:46.580
 and cannot be overlooked

1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:49.340
 is this issue of how much energy you burn

1:22:49.340 --> 1:22:51.920
 during and after the activity.

1:22:51.920 --> 1:22:53.940
 And some of you probably already know about this

1:22:53.940 --> 1:22:58.580
 but the whole business of calories in versus calories out

1:22:58.580 --> 1:23:01.160
 and people counting the number of calories they burn

1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:02.460
 during their aerobic session

1:23:02.460 --> 1:23:04.780
 or during their whatever session

1:23:04.780 --> 1:23:07.020
 is only one half of the equation

1:23:07.020 --> 1:23:09.900
 and it really eclipses the more important issue

1:23:09.900 --> 1:23:14.060
 which is how much of an increase in metabolism

1:23:14.060 --> 1:23:18.540
 does a given exercise create after the exercise?

1:23:18.540 --> 1:23:19.980
 And we could talk for hours about this

1:23:19.980 --> 1:23:21.240
 but the simple way to view this

1:23:21.240 --> 1:23:23.900
 is that high intensity training,

1:23:23.900 --> 1:23:28.580
 anaerobic training of weight training, sprints, burpees

1:23:28.580 --> 1:23:29.420
 any kind of thing.

1:23:29.420 --> 1:23:30.540
 I don't know, these days I see,

1:23:30.540 --> 1:23:32.080
 I hear that you're not supposed to do burpees

1:23:32.080 --> 1:23:33.240
 that people think burpees are dangerous.

1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:35.020
 So I'm not suggesting any particular movements here.

1:23:35.020 --> 1:23:37.020
 You have to decide what's right for you.

1:23:38.020 --> 1:23:41.140
 I do burpees, I don't seem to be injured from them

1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:43.260
 but I hear that they're terrible for some people.

1:23:43.260 --> 1:23:46.700
 So anyway, pushups, sit ups, whatever it happens to be

1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:50.660
 that anaerobic exercise that's of higher intensity

1:23:50.660 --> 1:23:55.660
 or sprints taps into glycogen stores during the movement

1:23:55.780 --> 1:23:58.860
 and will burn more energy per unit time

1:23:58.860 --> 1:23:59.780
 than moderate intensity.

1:23:59.780 --> 1:24:01.560
 High intensity burns more than moderate intensity.

1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:02.700
 That's straightforward.

1:24:03.580 --> 1:24:06.800
 What's interesting is that all the studies

1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:09.260
 that I was able to find on what happens

1:24:09.260 --> 1:24:10.660
 after that type of exercise

1:24:10.660 --> 1:24:12.940
 showed that the percentage of fat that you burn

1:24:12.940 --> 1:24:16.660
 after high intensity exercise is actually greater

1:24:16.660 --> 1:24:18.340
 in other words, you burn a lot of glycogen

1:24:18.340 --> 1:24:20.120
 during the high intensity exercise

1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:21.900
 and then after the exercise,

1:24:21.900 --> 1:24:24.080
 the post-exercise oxygen consumption

1:24:24.080 --> 1:24:27.200
 as it's sometimes called goes up.

1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:28.940
 We know this after you train intensely

1:24:28.940 --> 1:24:31.200
 that post-exercise oxygen consumption goes up

1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:33.860
 sometimes for up to 24 hours.

1:24:33.860 --> 1:24:35.580
 And it is during that period of time

1:24:35.580 --> 1:24:39.500
 that you oxidize more fat, not glycogen.

1:24:39.500 --> 1:24:42.900
 Now what's interesting is that the reverse is also true

1:24:42.900 --> 1:24:44.640
 for people that do long bouts

1:24:44.640 --> 1:24:46.900
 of low or moderate intensity exercise.

1:24:46.900 --> 1:24:48.540
 So typically this would be things like running,

1:24:48.540 --> 1:24:49.660
 swimming, biking, et cetera.

1:24:49.660 --> 1:24:52.020
 So 60, 90 minutes, two hours,

1:24:52.020 --> 1:24:53.880
 maybe even people that are training for marathons

1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:55.100
 or half marathons.

1:24:55.100 --> 1:24:59.700
 When they stop training, they burn more glycogen,

1:24:59.700 --> 1:25:02.780
 more carbohydrate, even though they were burning

1:25:02.780 --> 1:25:05.400
 more body fat per unit time

1:25:05.400 --> 1:25:07.100
 during the low intensity exercise.

1:25:07.100 --> 1:25:08.460
 So there's this kind of inversion.

1:25:08.460 --> 1:25:10.940
 High intensity burns more glycogen during the activity,

1:25:10.940 --> 1:25:13.260
 more body fat afterwards.

1:25:13.260 --> 1:25:17.220
 Moderate to low intensity burns more percentage-wise,

1:25:17.220 --> 1:25:20.120
 more body fat is oxidized than glycogen

1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:22.460
 during the actual exercise.

1:25:22.460 --> 1:25:24.780
 Afterward, it's more glycogen.

1:25:24.780 --> 1:25:27.020
 So I don't want this to get too complicated.

1:25:27.020 --> 1:25:30.700
 The point is you should pick exercise that you like,

1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:32.540
 that you're going to do regularly,

1:25:32.540 --> 1:25:36.300
 but it does seem that the high intensity exercise

1:25:36.300 --> 1:25:39.280
 followed by moderate intensity exercise

1:25:39.280 --> 1:25:41.900
 is going to be optimal for fat burning overall

1:25:41.900 --> 1:25:45.380
 because when you look at the percentage of body fat burned

1:25:45.380 --> 1:25:47.580
 and you look at the overall increase

1:25:47.580 --> 1:25:49.420
 in basal metabolic rate,

1:25:49.420 --> 1:25:51.580
 moderate and high intensity training

1:25:52.580 --> 1:25:54.840
 followed by low intensity training,

1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:57.540
 or even just followed by going back into life

1:25:57.540 --> 1:26:00.660
 is going to be the best way to continue to burn body fat

1:26:00.660 --> 1:26:04.240
 because of the ways that it increases basal metabolic rate.

1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:07.700
 Now, this could be distilled into a simple protocol

1:26:07.700 --> 1:26:10.340
 whereby three or four times a week

1:26:10.340 --> 1:26:13.260
 you do high intensity training followed by either nothing

1:26:13.260 --> 1:26:16.580
 or followed by low intensity training,

1:26:16.580 --> 1:26:19.460
 especially if you're able to do that fasted.

1:26:19.460 --> 1:26:21.700
 And I should just mention that none of this stuff

1:26:21.700 --> 1:26:23.700
 about fasted is about performance.

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:25.860
 If you want to perform really well,

1:26:25.860 --> 1:26:28.180
 this is for reasons of performance

1:26:28.180 --> 1:26:30.500
 and it's for a sport or a competition,

1:26:30.500 --> 1:26:32.160
 it's not for body fat purposes,

1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:34.580
 well, then all of this kind of falls away

1:26:34.580 --> 1:26:37.180
 and is modified by what's ideal to eat for performance.

1:26:37.180 --> 1:26:38.180
 But what we're talking about today

1:26:38.180 --> 1:26:42.500
 is how to optimize body fat, body fat loss.

1:26:42.500 --> 1:26:47.500
 So train moderately to intensely to very high intensity

1:26:48.180 --> 1:26:51.460
 and then moderate to low intensity

1:26:51.460 --> 1:26:55.120
 or train moderate to high intensity and then go about life.

1:26:55.120 --> 1:26:58.980
 And in fact, I have a friend who uses this strategy.

1:26:58.980 --> 1:27:01.860
 He likes to train intensely and not that often protocol

1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:03.140
 because he's a very busy person.

1:27:03.140 --> 1:27:05.780
 So he'll train for 20 or 30 minutes intensely with weights

1:27:05.780 --> 1:27:08.300
 or just body weight movement, doing a lot of,

1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:10.580
 he does burpees and pushups and sit ups and pull ups

1:27:10.580 --> 1:27:13.660
 and just kind of moving and kind of circuit type training.

1:27:13.660 --> 1:27:15.140
 But where he's breathing really hard,

1:27:15.140 --> 1:27:17.180
 the goal he always says is I want to breathe hard

1:27:17.180 --> 1:27:18.820
 for 30 minutes every day.

1:27:18.820 --> 1:27:21.700
 And then afterwards he hydrates and drinks coffee

1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:23.520
 and moves into his day and he's walking around

1:27:23.520 --> 1:27:25.820
 and taking calls and carrying around his children

1:27:25.820 --> 1:27:26.820
 and doing all these kinds of things

1:27:26.820 --> 1:27:27.660
 that keep him really busy

1:27:27.660 --> 1:27:29.420
 with kind of like low intensity work.

1:27:29.420 --> 1:27:31.300
 So I think you get the principle now,

1:27:31.300 --> 1:27:33.880
 but you should all be asking yourselves

1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:36.340
 as scientists of yourselves,

1:27:36.340 --> 1:27:38.880
 why would it be that certain patterns of exercise

1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:41.980
 would lead to more or less fat loss?

1:27:41.980 --> 1:27:43.980
 I mean, it can't just be about the energy burned.

1:27:43.980 --> 1:27:45.500
 We already established that.

1:27:45.500 --> 1:27:47.500
 And again, it has to do with the neurons.

1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:50.040
 It has to do with how we engage the nervous system.

1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:53.180
 So while non-exercise activity induced thermogenesis,

1:27:53.180 --> 1:27:57.580
 NEAT, the fidgeting, and cold can induce thermogenesis

1:27:57.580 --> 1:28:01.020
 by engaging shiver type movement or low level movements,

1:28:01.020 --> 1:28:04.440
 big movements that are of very high intensity,

1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:05.980
 meaning they require a lot of effort,

1:28:05.980 --> 1:28:09.780
 deploy a lot of adrenaline epinephrine from our neurons

1:28:09.780 --> 1:28:13.700
 and signal particular types and amounts

1:28:13.700 --> 1:28:18.140
 of fat thermogenesis, fat oxidation.

1:28:18.140 --> 1:28:20.460
 Whereas low level intensity exercise,

1:28:20.460 --> 1:28:22.380
 low or moderate intensity exercise,

1:28:22.380 --> 1:28:25.120
 walking, running, biking, where you can do that easily,

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:27.060
 there's not very much adrenaline release.

1:28:27.060 --> 1:28:31.420
 So adrenaline and AKA epinephrine

1:28:31.420 --> 1:28:33.620
 is really the final common path

1:28:33.620 --> 1:28:35.880
 by which movement of any kind,

1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:37.320
 whether or not it's low level shiver

1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:39.300
 or whether or not it's lifting a barbell,

1:28:39.300 --> 1:28:42.340
 sprinting up a hill or doing a long bike ride,

1:28:42.340 --> 1:28:46.920
 adrenaline is the effector of fat loss.

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:49.520
 It's the trigger and it's the effector.

1:28:49.520 --> 1:28:51.340
 So now I want to turn our attention

1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:55.500
 to compounds that increase epinephrine and adrenaline,

1:28:55.500 --> 1:28:58.260
 as well as compounds that work outside

1:28:58.260 --> 1:29:00.720
 the adrenaline epinephrine pathway

1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:03.100
 to increase the rates of fat loss.

1:29:03.100 --> 1:29:06.160
 I almost always save compounds and supplements

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:07.940
 and things of that sort to the end,

1:29:07.940 --> 1:29:10.820
 because I do believe that people should look first

1:29:10.820 --> 1:29:12.660
 towards behavioral tools

1:29:12.660 --> 1:29:14.220
 and an understanding of the science

1:29:14.220 --> 1:29:17.260
 before they look toward a supplement

1:29:17.260 --> 1:29:21.280
 or a particular thing that they can extract from diet.

1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:23.020
 This is mainly to try and shift people away

1:29:23.020 --> 1:29:25.180
 from the kind of magic pill phenomenon

1:29:25.180 --> 1:29:27.080
 or the idea that there is a magic pill,

1:29:27.080 --> 1:29:28.100
 because there really isn't

1:29:28.100 --> 1:29:29.660
 and frankly there never will be.

1:29:29.660 --> 1:29:30.900
 But there are some compounds

1:29:30.900 --> 1:29:34.580
 that can greatly increase fat oxidation and mobilization

1:29:34.580 --> 1:29:36.820
 and understanding which compounds

1:29:36.820 --> 1:29:39.780
 increase oxidation or mobilization

1:29:39.780 --> 1:29:43.860
 can be very useful if your goal is to accelerate fat loss.

1:29:43.860 --> 1:29:46.340
 There are things that people can ingest

1:29:46.340 --> 1:29:50.060
 that will allow them to oxidize more fat.

1:29:50.060 --> 1:29:52.540
 And that occurs mainly by increasing the amount

1:29:52.540 --> 1:29:55.120
 of epinephrine that is released from neurons

1:29:55.120 --> 1:29:57.260
 that innervate fat tissue.

1:29:57.260 --> 1:29:58.740
 One of the more common ones

1:29:58.740 --> 1:30:01.760
 is one that you may already be using, which is caffeine.

1:30:02.620 --> 1:30:06.780
 It's well-established that caffeine can enhance performance

1:30:06.780 --> 1:30:08.240
 if you're caffeine adapted.

1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:10.180
 I talked about this in an earlier episode,

1:30:10.180 --> 1:30:12.140
 so I want to make sure I'm very clear about this.

1:30:12.140 --> 1:30:14.380
 If you are not used to drinking caffeine

1:30:14.380 --> 1:30:17.380
 and you suddenly decide I'm going to drink

1:30:17.380 --> 1:30:20.120
 a big cup of coffee before training,

1:30:20.120 --> 1:30:24.220
 you will vasoconstrict and you will limit performance.

1:30:24.220 --> 1:30:25.480
 So that's performance.

1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:28.020
 If you're caffeine adapted, however,

1:30:28.020 --> 1:30:29.900
 there's this kind of interesting phenomenon

1:30:29.900 --> 1:30:32.300
 where ingestion of caffeine serves more

1:30:32.300 --> 1:30:36.120
 as a performance enhancer, both by increasing alertness,

1:30:36.120 --> 1:30:39.900
 but also by way of dilating vasculature,

1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:41.300
 of allowing more blood flow.

1:30:42.400 --> 1:30:45.860
 Now, caffeine for burning more fat,

1:30:45.860 --> 1:30:47.780
 for oxidizing and mobilizing more fat

1:30:47.780 --> 1:30:48.960
 is an interesting one.

1:30:48.960 --> 1:30:53.960
 It can be effective at dosages up to 400 milligrams.

1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:56.920
 You have to be careful if you're caffeine sensitive.

1:30:56.920 --> 1:30:58.960
 Some people have just the littlest bit of caffeine

1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:01.960
 and their mind goes crazy and they're very uncomfortable.

1:31:01.960 --> 1:31:04.080
 It can have cardiovascular effects for some people

1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:05.280
 with hypertension, et cetera.

1:31:05.280 --> 1:31:07.040
 So please check with your doctor.

1:31:07.040 --> 1:31:12.040
 But 400 milligrams is roughly a cup and a half of coffee

1:31:12.180 --> 1:31:13.280
 or two cups of coffee.

1:31:13.280 --> 1:31:16.480
 Nowadays, there's a lot more caffeine in coffee.

1:31:16.480 --> 1:31:19.760
 So if you go to a typical cafe

1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:22.620
 and you were to get their medium size,

1:31:22.620 --> 1:31:25.220
 that would have close to a gram of caffeine,

1:31:25.220 --> 1:31:28.440
 which is why if you're a regular caffeine consumer

1:31:28.440 --> 1:31:30.280
 and you don't get that gram of caffeine

1:31:30.280 --> 1:31:32.320
 in your coffee each day, you will get a headache.

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:35.200
 It can cause constriction and dilation of blood vessels

1:31:35.200 --> 1:31:38.260
 in ways that's complicated, but you'll get a headache.

1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:42.040
 Some people like the way they feel,

1:31:42.040 --> 1:31:44.040
 drinking 100 to 200, 300,

1:31:44.040 --> 1:31:46.300
 maybe in 400 milligrams of caffeine before training.

1:31:46.300 --> 1:31:49.360
 And indeed that will lead to increased fat oxidation.

1:31:49.360 --> 1:31:51.280
 It will do that because you will release

1:31:51.280 --> 1:31:53.480
 more epinephrine and adrenaline.

1:31:53.480 --> 1:31:55.700
 So let's just place this in the context

1:31:55.700 --> 1:31:56.840
 of what we said previously.

1:31:56.840 --> 1:31:59.480
 Let's say you normally do zone two cardio.

1:31:59.480 --> 1:32:02.600
 So you're going out for a moderately intense run

1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:05.040
 for 30 to 60 minutes or so.

1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:08.100
 I think the current recommendation guidelines in the States

1:32:08.100 --> 1:32:11.560
 are that people engage in 30 minutes

1:32:11.560 --> 1:32:15.800
 of moderate intensity exercise five days a week

1:32:15.800 --> 1:32:18.520
 for, so that's 150 minutes,

1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:21.800
 if their goal is to improve or maintain health

1:32:21.800 --> 1:32:23.360
 of the cardiovascular system.

1:32:24.840 --> 1:32:27.900
 80% of people in the United States fail to do that

1:32:27.900 --> 1:32:29.920
 or anything close to it.

1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:31.360
 We are way below threshold

1:32:31.360 --> 1:32:33.480
 for what the government has recommended.

1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:35.640
 In this case, the government recommendations, I think,

1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:36.940
 are pretty good.

1:32:36.940 --> 1:32:38.800
 One could always do better, of course,

1:32:38.800 --> 1:32:41.480
 but 80% of people aren't even doing that.

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:45.380
 However, just using the logic and the understanding

1:32:45.380 --> 1:32:47.960
 of how epinephrine, adrenaline is affecting

1:32:47.960 --> 1:32:49.480
 this fat oxidation process.

1:32:49.480 --> 1:32:51.960
 If you were to go out for 15 minutes

1:32:51.960 --> 1:32:54.380
 and you drank caffeine before you went,

1:32:54.380 --> 1:32:58.840
 yes, you will probably oxidize more fat per unit time.

1:32:58.840 --> 1:33:02.120
 Can you compensate for the exercise you're not doing

1:33:02.120 --> 1:33:04.000
 just by drinking caffeine?

1:33:04.000 --> 1:33:07.380
 Well, probably if you were just talking about fat loss,

1:33:07.380 --> 1:33:10.040
 if that caffeine makes you fidget a lot, right?

1:33:10.040 --> 1:33:13.220
 The amount of calories that you burn in a 30 minute run,

1:33:13.220 --> 1:33:14.860
 unless the run is very intense

1:33:14.860 --> 1:33:16.900
 and you're wearing a weight vest and it's up a hill,

1:33:16.900 --> 1:33:18.960
 it's not that great, right?

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:20.200
 But you probably get somewhere

1:33:20.200 --> 1:33:24.320
 into the 400, 500 calories burned area.

1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:26.040
 But I said earlier,

1:33:26.040 --> 1:33:27.480
 and there are a lot of data now that support

1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:29.500
 that fidgeting for a day can burn anywhere

1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:31.640
 from 800 to 2,500 calories a day.

1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:33.600
 So you might say, well, fidgeting is better than running.

1:33:33.600 --> 1:33:35.680
 Ah, but it doesn't trigger the activation

1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:39.660
 and the positive health effects of the cardiovascular system.

1:33:39.660 --> 1:33:42.360
 So fidgeting alone can be great,

1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:45.560
 but you need exercise for other reasons.

1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:48.360
 Caffeine can enhance the amount of fat that you burn

1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:50.120
 in any duration of exercise,

1:33:50.120 --> 1:33:53.280
 and it can shift the percentage of fat that you oxidize

1:33:53.280 --> 1:33:58.000
 compared to glycogen, unless you take that caffeine

1:33:58.000 --> 1:33:59.360
 and it ramps you up so much

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:01.600
 that you're training really, really intensely.

1:34:01.600 --> 1:34:03.940
 The bottom line is if you like caffeine

1:34:03.940 --> 1:34:05.960
 and you can use it safely,

1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:09.160
 ingesting somewhere between 100 and 400 milligrams

1:34:09.160 --> 1:34:10.780
 of caffeine prior to exercise,

1:34:10.780 --> 1:34:14.720
 somewhere between 30 to 40 minutes before exercise

1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:19.280
 can be beneficial if we're talking about fat oxidation,

1:34:19.280 --> 1:34:20.700
 burning more body fat.

1:34:20.700 --> 1:34:21.960
 So that's caffeine.

1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:23.640
 There are a number of other things that have existed

1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:25.560
 over the years that are in this pathway,

1:34:25.560 --> 1:34:30.560
 things like ephedrine, which is now illegal in most states,

1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:32.320
 I think maybe in all states

1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:35.300
 because people were dropping dead from taking ephedrine

1:34:35.300 --> 1:34:37.380
 because they were heating up too much.

1:34:37.380 --> 1:34:39.540
 It's interesting, it wasn't direct effects

1:34:39.540 --> 1:34:41.240
 on the heart causing heart attack.

1:34:41.240 --> 1:34:45.920
 It could trigger by way of adrenergic receptors,

1:34:45.920 --> 1:34:47.360
 if you'd like to know,

1:34:47.360 --> 1:34:50.520
 increases in body temperature and heat.

1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:53.840
 Now, those drugs turned out to be dangerous

1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:55.460
 because people were overheating and dying.

1:34:55.460 --> 1:34:57.580
 There was also the big Fen-Fen craze.

1:34:57.580 --> 1:35:01.200
 There was a drug that was released, fenfluramine,

1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:05.600
 which actually was quite effective as an anti-obesity drug,

1:35:05.600 --> 1:35:07.320
 a treatment for obesity.

1:35:07.320 --> 1:35:10.100
 That had to be outlawed as well.

1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:14.440
 It was, FDA approval was removed because again,

1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:17.000
 people were dying because of cardiovascular effects.

1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:19.760
 I don't know if people were overheating on it as well.

1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:21.440
 So what is the solution?

1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:23.960
 If caffeine is the kind of the entry point

1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:27.000
 for most people of using compounds to increase the rate

1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:31.180
 or percentage of fat loss in exercise and even at rest,

1:35:31.180 --> 1:35:32.340
 what are some of the other things

1:35:32.340 --> 1:35:33.940
 that are useful and interesting?

1:35:33.940 --> 1:35:36.520
 Well, in terms of tools that are actionable

1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:38.920
 and have reasonable safety margins,

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:43.520
 I've talked before about something called GLP-1.

1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:46.160
 This is something that can be triggered

1:35:46.160 --> 1:35:48.980
 by the ingestion of yerba mate, which is a tea.

1:35:48.980 --> 1:35:51.240
 And I guess because I'm half Argentine,

1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:52.640
 they grew up drinking mate.

1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:53.640
 I think I was drinking mate

1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:55.980
 from the time I was about three or four years old.

1:35:55.980 --> 1:35:57.400
 I don't suggest that for kids.

1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:00.520
 I don't think kids should be ingesting caffeine.

1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:04.920
 But anyway, I did it and I still ingest mate.

1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:07.440
 Mate increases GLP-1.

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:10.660
 GLP-1 is in the glucagon pathway.

1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:13.040
 So let's just quickly return to our biochemistry.

1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:16.520
 As you recall, fat is mobilized from body fat stores

1:36:17.380 --> 1:36:20.720
 and then it's burned up, it's oxidized in cells.

1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:24.060
 It actually needs to be converted into ATP.

1:36:24.060 --> 1:36:28.760
 And those fatty acids are essentially converted into ATP

1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:31.000
 in the mitochondria of the cell.

1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.760
 High insulin prevents that from happening.

1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:38.420
 And glucagon facilitates that process.

1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:44.460
 Glucagon facilitates that process through increases in GLP-1.

1:36:44.460 --> 1:36:49.280
 The short takeaway is mate increases GLP-1

1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:52.600
 and yes, increases the percentage of fat that you'll burn.

1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:54.360
 It increases fat burning.

1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:56.400
 And that is especially true, it turns out,

1:36:56.400 --> 1:36:57.940
 from the scientific literature,

1:36:57.940 --> 1:37:02.020
 if you ingest mate prior to exercise of any kind.

1:37:02.020 --> 1:37:04.960
 So if you want to burn more fat,

1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:08.200
 drinking mate before exercise is good.

1:37:08.200 --> 1:37:11.240
 Drinking it at rest when you're not exercising

1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:13.540
 will also help shift your metabolism

1:37:13.540 --> 1:37:18.040
 toward enhanced burning of fat by increasing fat oxidation.

1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:21.340
 Now there's a whole category of pharmaceuticals

1:37:21.340 --> 1:37:22.820
 that's being developed right now

1:37:22.820 --> 1:37:25.440
 that are in late stage trials

1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:27.840
 or are in use for the treatment of diabetes,

1:37:27.840 --> 1:37:32.040
 which capitalize on this GLP-1 pathway.

1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:33.920
 They go by various names

1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:35.920
 and there are people on the internet

1:37:35.920 --> 1:37:37.280
 who are selling these things.

1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:38.640
 They are prescription drugs.

1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:40.960
 And I want to emphasize that they are prescription drugs.

1:37:40.960 --> 1:37:43.200
 And you obviously wouldn't want to use any of these

1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:45.640
 without a prescription and a requirement.

1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:47.080
 It does seem that they are effective

1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:49.920
 for the treatment of certain kinds of diabetes

1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:53.960
 and lead to fairly significant weight loss

1:37:53.960 --> 1:37:55.620
 and reduction in appetite.

1:37:55.620 --> 1:37:59.600
 So this is kind of the modern version of GLP-1

1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:03.800
 is pharmaceuticals of GLP-1 metabolism

1:38:03.800 --> 1:38:07.260
 are drugs such as semaglutide.

1:38:07.260 --> 1:38:08.600
 I can never pronounce this.

1:38:08.600 --> 1:38:11.080
 Can't seem to pronounce many things it seems.

1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:14.000
 Semaglutide is the way I would pronounce it.

1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:17.800
 S-E-M-A-G-L-U-T-I-D-E.

1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:22.320
 Semaglutide, but that's not the way you pronounce it.

1:38:22.320 --> 1:38:23.640
 But semaglutide is the way

1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:26.540
 that it's been described on the internet.

1:38:26.540 --> 1:38:30.480
 In any case, this compound increases GLP-1.

1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:33.440
 It's actually a GLP-1 analog in some cases

1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:37.320
 and they go by various types of trade names.

1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:39.300
 So the GLP-1 pathway is interesting.

1:38:39.300 --> 1:38:41.400
 Most people, including myself,

1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:43.340
 are not interested in taking a prescription drug

1:38:43.340 --> 1:38:44.440
 to increase GLP-1.

1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:46.420
 I do it through the ingestion of mate.

1:38:46.420 --> 1:38:49.280
 I just get the mate leaves, pour water over it and drink it.

1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:52.360
 What's kind of interesting that's not often discussed

1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:57.040
 is that you can increase the amount of GLP-1

1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:00.260
 by, you can essentially reuse the tea.

1:39:00.260 --> 1:39:02.800
 The first time you drink it, it's going to be very,

1:39:02.800 --> 1:39:03.640
 very intense.

1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:06.240
 In fact, some people find that mate,

1:39:06.240 --> 1:39:07.960
 it almost tastes like burnt leaves.

1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:08.800
 It's too intense.

1:39:08.800 --> 1:39:10.560
 You don't want the water to be too hot.

1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:12.480
 But I learned this trick from a friend.

1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:14.640
 You can reuse the leaves over and over again,

1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:16.800
 probably for about a day before they go bad.

1:39:16.800 --> 1:39:19.080
 And in doing that, you start to extract

1:39:19.080 --> 1:39:20.600
 more and more of the compounds

1:39:20.600 --> 1:39:22.960
 from the mate leaf that increased GLP-1.

1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:23.800
 So it's kind of cool.

1:39:23.800 --> 1:39:25.320
 You can kind of get an increased effect.

1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:27.480
 So what I'll typically do is make

1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:29.120
 about 16 to 30 ounces of it

1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:30.300
 and just sip it throughout the day.

1:39:30.300 --> 1:39:32.040
 And I do like it before I train.

1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:34.560
 Some people who don't like mate

1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:37.320
 might prefer something like guayusa,

1:39:37.320 --> 1:39:41.760
 which is spelled G-U-A-Y-U-S-A.

1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:44.600
 G-U-A-Y-U-S-A, guayusa,

1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:48.600
 which is from Ecuador, despite the USA ending to it.

1:39:48.600 --> 1:39:49.460
 It's from Ecuador.

1:39:49.460 --> 1:39:52.560
 And it's a sweeter tasting tea.

1:39:52.560 --> 1:39:54.360
 It doesn't have any sweetener in it,

1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:56.460
 but the leaf of the guayusa plant

1:39:56.460 --> 1:39:58.500
 is sweeter than the mate plant.

1:39:58.500 --> 1:40:00.000
 I sometimes will mix the two

1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.640
 and then make the tea with that.

1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:05.320
 There's no mate or guayusa sponsor of the podcast.

1:40:05.320 --> 1:40:09.680
 These are just tools to increase GLP-1 and fat oxidation.

1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:14.320
 And again, the semaglutide is the prescription version

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:19.000
 where it's kind of the heavy artillery GLP-1 stimulant.

1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:22.080
 And again, should be only explored with a prescription.

1:40:22.080 --> 1:40:23.920
 So those are the compounds

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:28.380
 that really increase fat oxidation directly.

1:40:28.380 --> 1:40:30.040
 There are going to be a number of things

1:40:30.040 --> 1:40:33.240
 that impact insulin and glucagon

1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:37.560
 that are going to shift the body toward more fat burning.

1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:39.040
 We talked about a lot of these

1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:41.420
 during the episode on hormones.

1:40:41.420 --> 1:40:42.260
 We talked about it,

1:40:42.260 --> 1:40:44.440
 we did a whole episode on hormones and metabolism.

1:40:44.440 --> 1:40:48.660
 And so for instance, berberine, which comes from a plant

1:40:48.660 --> 1:40:51.560
 or metformin are compounds that are now

1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:55.620
 in kind of growing use for reducing blood glucose.

1:40:55.620 --> 1:40:58.520
 They are very potent at reducing blood glucose,

1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:00.000
 which will reduce insulin

1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.800
 because the job of the hormone insulin

1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:05.520
 is to essentially manage glucose in the bloodstream.

1:41:05.520 --> 1:41:08.520
 So there are a huge gallery of compounds

1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:10.280
 that will reduce insulin

1:41:10.280 --> 1:41:12.920
 and thereby can increase fat oxidation.

1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:15.320
 And that's because, as I mentioned before,

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:18.960
 fat oxidation, this conversion of fatty acids into ATP

1:41:18.960 --> 1:41:21.480
 in the mitochondria is inhibited by insulin.

1:41:21.480 --> 1:41:22.920
 So if you keep insulin low,

1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:25.040
 you're going to increase that process,

1:41:25.040 --> 1:41:27.280
 which brings us full circle back

1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:30.160
 to the issue of diet and nutrition.

1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:33.980
 There is really solid evidence

1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:37.980
 from the Gardner lab at Stanford and from other labs

1:41:37.980 --> 1:41:40.280
 showing that when you look at different diets,

1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:43.060
 you look at low-fat diets, high-fat diets,

1:41:43.060 --> 1:41:45.520
 keto diets, intermittent fasting.

1:41:46.920 --> 1:41:49.320
 Provided people stick to their particular diet,

1:41:49.320 --> 1:41:52.680
 it doesn't really matter which diet you follow.

1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:56.400
 You can still get a caloric deficit and you get weight loss.

1:41:56.400 --> 1:41:58.720
 Adherence, however, is always an issue.

1:41:58.720 --> 1:42:00.560
 And so what I always say is

1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:02.920
 that you want to use the eating plan

1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:05.640
 that is obviously beneficial to your health,

1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:09.200
 but the one that allows you to adhere to whatever it is

1:42:09.200 --> 1:42:12.440
 that the particular nutrition protocol is, right?

1:42:12.440 --> 1:42:14.240
 If you can't stick with something,

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:16.000
 then it's not very worthwhile.

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:19.080
 But from the purely scientific standpoint,

1:42:19.080 --> 1:42:22.920
 there's also an advantage to keeping insulin low.

1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:24.040
 Now that doesn't necessarily mean

1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:25.660
 you go to zero carbohydrate.

1:42:25.660 --> 1:42:28.080
 I've talked before about my preferred way of eating

1:42:28.080 --> 1:42:30.240
 is to go low or no carbohydrate throughout the day

1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:32.760
 for alertness, to get that adrenaline release

1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:34.640
 and the focus that goes with it, et cetera,

1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:36.540
 and the ability to think and move

1:42:36.540 --> 1:42:38.400
 and do all the things I need to do during the day.

1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:39.860
 And then I eat carbohydrates at night

1:42:39.860 --> 1:42:41.720
 because it facilitates the transition to sleep.

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:43.780
 That's what works for me.

1:42:43.780 --> 1:42:46.680
 But when insulin is low,

1:42:46.680 --> 1:42:51.680
 you do place your system in a position to oxidize more fat.

1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:54.720
 And so that's why I think a lot of people do see benefit

1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:57.900
 from lower carbohydrate or moderate carbohydrate diets

1:42:57.900 --> 1:42:59.400
 because when insulin is low,

1:42:59.400 --> 1:43:02.260
 you are in a position to oxidize more fat,

1:43:02.260 --> 1:43:04.640
 both from exercise and at rest.

1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:07.400
 And I should mention, because I often mention

1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:08.680
 and it's appropriate to mention

1:43:08.680 --> 1:43:10.920
 that if you're interested in looking at the effects

1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:15.320
 of caffeine, of mate, guayusa, things of that sort, GLP-1,

1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:16.960
 you want to learn more about those,

1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:18.720
 you can go to this wonderful website,

1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:22.320
 which is free, examine.com.

1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:23.780
 You can put in Yerba Mate.

1:43:23.780 --> 1:43:26.120
 It will describe the three studies

1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:29.440
 that show increased fat oxidation,

1:43:29.440 --> 1:43:31.800
 both during exercise and at rest.

1:43:31.800 --> 1:43:33.760
 And as a consequence, not surprisingly,

1:43:33.760 --> 1:43:36.120
 an increase in metabolic rate.

1:43:36.120 --> 1:43:38.920
 One thing that's interesting about mate

1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:41.800
 is it causes a slight decrease in heart rate

1:43:41.800 --> 1:43:44.640
 for reasons that still escape me.

1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:46.420
 There's a single study showing

1:43:46.420 --> 1:43:49.460
 that heart rate is slightly reduced,

1:43:49.460 --> 1:43:50.560
 which is kind of nice

1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:52.280
 because if when I drink too much caffeine,

1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:53.240
 my heart rate goes up,

1:43:53.240 --> 1:43:55.680
 maybe that would increase my fidgeting and my fat burning,

1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:56.960
 but I don't like the feeling

1:43:56.960 --> 1:43:59.260
 of having my basal heart rate being up too high.

1:43:59.260 --> 1:44:01.200
 I like my heart rate elevated during exercise,

1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:02.680
 but not when I'm just kind of resting

1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:04.400
 or working throughout the day.

1:44:04.400 --> 1:44:07.860
 And for some reason that I don't understand,

1:44:07.860 --> 1:44:11.800
 there's an effect of mate of increasing fat oxidation,

1:44:11.800 --> 1:44:14.520
 but reducing heart rate just slightly.

1:44:14.520 --> 1:44:16.760
 So that's interesting and it probably lends itself

1:44:16.760 --> 1:44:20.200
 to my, explains the subjective experience that I've had

1:44:20.200 --> 1:44:24.440
 of that mate is kind of a nice, even, mellow stimulant.

1:44:24.440 --> 1:44:27.240
 It's not this really supercharged stimulant

1:44:27.240 --> 1:44:30.160
 like caffeine from coffee or other sources.

1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:31.600
 Although if you drink too much mate,

1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:33.840
 it will also make you jittery.

1:44:33.840 --> 1:44:35.340
 And there's one more compound

1:44:35.340 --> 1:44:36.600
 that I think we should discuss

1:44:36.600 --> 1:44:38.920
 in terms of increasing fat loss,

1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:41.720
 and that's carnitine or acetyl-L-carnitine.

1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:43.180
 They lie in the same pathway.

1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:47.600
 We can return to our basic knowledge now

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:49.720
 of fat mobilization and oxidation.

1:44:50.560 --> 1:44:54.240
 After fat is mobilized and makes it into cells

1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:55.680
 and needs to be oxidized,

1:44:55.680 --> 1:44:57.600
 so literally the burning of fat

1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:00.400
 and conversion of it into energy,

1:45:00.400 --> 1:45:04.560
 that is accomplished and is facilitated

1:45:04.560 --> 1:45:08.440
 by the presence of glucagon being elevated,

1:45:08.440 --> 1:45:12.200
 GLP increases that process,

1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:14.940
 and insulin being low.

1:45:14.940 --> 1:45:18.080
 And we talked about some ways to manage insulin,

1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:20.400
 both in this episode and in previous episode.

1:45:21.760 --> 1:45:26.200
 L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine in particular

1:45:26.200 --> 1:45:29.360
 facilitates fat oxidation.

1:45:29.360 --> 1:45:33.160
 It helps convert fatty acids into ATP.

1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:36.880
 And indeed supplementing L-carnitine can increase fat loss.

1:45:36.880 --> 1:45:37.940
 That's been shown.

1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:40.520
 At what dosages?

1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:43.960
 Well, people ingest anywhere from 500 milligrams

1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:47.920
 to two grams per day in divided doses typically.

1:45:47.920 --> 1:45:49.600
 Some people who are really extreme

1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:52.640
 are taking injectable L-carnitine.

1:45:52.640 --> 1:45:54.180
 I've certainly not tried that.

1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:58.020
 I confess I have used it in pill form from time to time,

1:45:58.020 --> 1:46:01.120
 but in part because of the fat oxidation effects,

1:46:01.120 --> 1:46:03.100
 but also because of the other effects

1:46:03.100 --> 1:46:04.360
 that it tends to have.

1:46:04.360 --> 1:46:07.700
 So in exploring the effects that L-carnitine has,

1:46:07.700 --> 1:46:11.160
 it has a huge variety of effects on cellular metabolism.

1:46:11.160 --> 1:46:13.980
 It can reduce ammonia in the blood.

1:46:13.980 --> 1:46:15.980
 That is actually a quite strong effect.

1:46:15.980 --> 1:46:18.040
 It can reduce things like C-reactive protein,

1:46:18.040 --> 1:46:22.120
 which is you want C-reactive protein levels to be managed.

1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:23.400
 You do not want them too high.

1:46:23.400 --> 1:46:26.320
 Can slightly reduce blood glucose.

1:46:26.320 --> 1:46:28.680
 It can slightly increase HDLC,

1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:31.440
 the good form of the blood lipid,

1:46:31.440 --> 1:46:33.960
 and slightly reduce overall cholesterol.

1:46:33.960 --> 1:46:34.880
 And as I mentioned,

1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:39.880
 it can slightly modify the pathway involving glucagon

1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:41.840
 such that you get a considerable effect,

1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:44.020
 not a huge effect on fat oxidation.

1:46:44.020 --> 1:46:46.680
 So it can improve fat oxidation rates.

1:46:46.680 --> 1:46:48.040
 It has a number of other effects,

1:46:48.040 --> 1:46:51.600
 some of which I talked about during the month on hormones

1:46:51.600 --> 1:46:53.720
 and that sort of thing.

1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:57.080
 It has strong effects on rates of pregnancy

1:46:57.080 --> 1:46:58.160
 and sperm quality.

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:00.440
 So clearly carnitine is doing lots of different things

1:47:00.440 --> 1:47:02.040
 in lots of different cells.

1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:03.980
 It's impacting sperm motility.

1:47:03.980 --> 1:47:07.040
 There are a large number of studies supporting that.

1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:09.520
 Slight reductions in blood pressure.

1:47:09.520 --> 1:47:13.040
 N has these interesting effects on reducing fatigue

1:47:13.040 --> 1:47:15.640
 during exercise, reducing inflammatory markers

1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:17.000
 like interleukin-6.

1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:19.820
 So it has a number of effects that on the whole

1:47:19.820 --> 1:47:21.600
 are quote unquote positive,

1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:24.160
 or at least in the direction of things that you may want.

1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:25.480
 And I should emphasize may.

1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:27.700
 You certainly don't need acetyl-L-carnitine

1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:30.160
 in order to lose fat,

1:47:30.160 --> 1:47:33.240
 but now that you understand the cellular process

1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:36.000
 by which fat is mobilized and oxidized,

1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.960
 it should make sense that if L-carnitine is important

1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:42.680
 for converting fatty acids into energy,

1:47:42.680 --> 1:47:46.880
 then supplementing L-carnitine makes sense.

1:47:46.880 --> 1:47:50.520
 Acetyl-L-carnitine is the type of L-carnitine

1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:52.400
 or the form of L-carnitine, I should say,

1:47:52.400 --> 1:47:56.620
 that is transported and utilized most easily by the body.

1:47:56.620 --> 1:47:58.200
 And so that's why sometimes we distinguish

1:47:58.200 --> 1:48:01.160
 between L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine.

1:48:01.160 --> 1:48:05.560
 So once again, we've covered an enormous amount of material.

1:48:05.560 --> 1:48:08.540
 We've talked about the science of fat loss.

1:48:08.540 --> 1:48:11.680
 And in particular, we've explored this topic

1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:14.440
 from the perspective of the nervous system,

1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:16.520
 how neurons, and in particular,

1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:20.280
 the release of things like adrenaline, epinephrine,

1:48:20.280 --> 1:48:24.340
 can facilitate fat mobilization and oxidation.

1:48:24.340 --> 1:48:27.040
 We talked about NEAT, fidgeting,

1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:30.640
 this non-exercise type movement

1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:35.600
 that can greatly increase caloric burn and why that is.

1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:36.720
 We talked about shiver,

1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:39.680
 another form of non-exercise movement

1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:42.800
 that can really increase both caloric expenditure

1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:44.760
 due to the shiver, due to the movement,

1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:47.360
 as well as increased thermogenesis,

1:48:47.360 --> 1:48:50.240
 the heating up of the body through things like brown fat,

1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:53.320
 and even the conversion of white fat to brown fat,

1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:55.880
 which is a good thing if you want to oxidize fat.

1:48:55.880 --> 1:48:59.500
 We talked about cold as a particular stimulus

1:48:59.500 --> 1:49:04.500
 to induce shiver and how to use getting into and out of cold

1:49:05.540 --> 1:49:09.380
 as a way to stimulate shiver and avoid cold adaptation

1:49:09.380 --> 1:49:12.580
 so that you continue to oxidize and burn fat,

1:49:12.580 --> 1:49:13.860
 if that's your goal.

1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:16.540
 If you want to check out the protocols for that,

1:49:16.540 --> 1:49:19.080
 they're at thecoldplunge.com.

1:49:19.080 --> 1:49:20.420
 And in weeks to come,

1:49:20.420 --> 1:49:23.220
 we're going to be adding more protocols to that website,

1:49:23.220 --> 1:49:26.740
 not just for fat loss, but for things like resilience,

1:49:26.740 --> 1:49:28.540
 reducing inflammation, et cetera.

1:49:28.540 --> 1:49:29.720
 So be sure to check those out.

1:49:29.720 --> 1:49:32.020
 Again, those are totally cost-free.

1:49:32.020 --> 1:49:33.860
 Talked about exercise,

1:49:33.860 --> 1:49:36.260
 how rather than thinking about cardiovascular

1:49:36.260 --> 1:49:38.100
 or weight training exercise,

1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:40.700
 that we should perhaps look through the lens

1:49:40.700 --> 1:49:41.940
 of this adrenaline system

1:49:41.940 --> 1:49:44.340
 and how it interacts with fat stores

1:49:44.340 --> 1:49:48.020
 and think about low, medium, or high intensity exercise,

1:49:48.020 --> 1:49:49.980
 whether or not we show up to that fasted or not.

1:49:49.980 --> 1:49:53.220
 Turns out showing up to that fasted can be useful

1:49:53.220 --> 1:49:55.900
 if you start with high intensity movements

1:49:55.900 --> 1:50:00.480
 and then move into lower intensity type exercise.

1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:02.220
 If you're going to go long duration,

1:50:02.220 --> 1:50:03.500
 it probably doesn't matter

1:50:03.500 --> 1:50:06.360
 unless you're exercising longer than 90 minutes,

1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:07.860
 whether or not you eat or not.

1:50:08.780 --> 1:50:11.980
 We talked about caffeine as a stimulant

1:50:11.980 --> 1:50:16.320
 and a stimulus for epinephrine and adrenaline release

1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:19.940
 as a way to access more fat metabolism.

1:50:19.940 --> 1:50:22.420
 And we talked about compounds that come from things

1:50:22.420 --> 1:50:25.860
 like yerba mate and guayusa tea,

1:50:25.860 --> 1:50:30.860
 this GLP-1 pathway that can trigger increased fat oxidation

1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:32.940
 so much so that the pharmaceutical companies

1:50:32.940 --> 1:50:36.760
 are now developing compounds specifically to increase GLP-1

1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:39.340
 for treatment of diabetes and obesity.

1:50:39.340 --> 1:50:41.820
 But you can leverage the GLP-1 pathway

1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:44.860
 through the ingestion of things like mate or guayusa

1:50:44.860 --> 1:50:47.020
 if that's of interest to you.

1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:48.980
 And then we talked about L-carnitine

1:50:48.980 --> 1:50:51.800
 and how L-carnitine itself is critical

1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:54.180
 for the fat oxidation within individual cells,

1:50:54.180 --> 1:50:57.000
 the conversion of fatty acids to energy

1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:00.300
 and why having your insulin low

1:51:00.300 --> 1:51:03.500
 and things like L-carnitine and glucagon levels

1:51:03.500 --> 1:51:05.960
 high or sufficient at least

1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:10.540
 to can facilitate the burning of fat, fat oxidation.

1:51:10.540 --> 1:51:11.740
 So we covered a lot of material.

1:51:11.740 --> 1:51:13.340
 That's a lot of protocols.

1:51:13.340 --> 1:51:14.980
 I realize, and that didn't,

1:51:14.980 --> 1:51:16.380
 the little list I just gave right there

1:51:16.380 --> 1:51:19.080
 didn't even begin to get into all the details

1:51:19.080 --> 1:51:20.840
 and corners that we discussed.

1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:23.760
 I hope you found this conversation interesting

1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:26.180
 both for sake of understanding fat loss

1:51:26.180 --> 1:51:28.060
 and how to lose fat more quickly

1:51:28.060 --> 1:51:30.780
 and to lose more of it if that's your goal,

1:51:30.780 --> 1:51:33.200
 as well as simply to understand the biology

1:51:33.200 --> 1:51:35.220
 of fat metabolism from a different perspective,

1:51:35.220 --> 1:51:37.940
 from the perspective of the nervous system.

1:51:37.940 --> 1:51:39.380

 We do read, I do read through all the comments.

1:52:28.980 --> 1:52:30.180
 It takes me some time.

1:52:30.180 --> 1:52:31.420
 I sometimes fall a little bit behind

1:52:31.420 --> 1:52:33.820
 depending on other duties, but I read all the comments

1:52:33.820 --> 1:52:35.620
 and I do take them into account

1:52:35.620 --> 1:52:36.980
 when developing this material

1:52:36.980 --> 1:52:38.500
