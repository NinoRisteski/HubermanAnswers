00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.420 --> 00:12.060
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.060 --> 00:15.300
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.280
 Today, we are going to talk all about

00:17.280 --> 00:21.660
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD.

00:21.660 --> 00:25.300
 We are also going to talk about normal levels of focus,

00:25.300 --> 00:27.380
 what are normal levels of focus,

00:27.380 --> 00:31.860
 and how all of us, whether or not we have ADHD or not,

00:31.860 --> 00:34.420
 can improve our ability to focus,

00:34.420 --> 00:36.580
 our ability to rule out distraction,

00:36.580 --> 00:39.000
 turns out those are two separate things,

00:39.000 --> 00:42.180
 as well as remember information better.

00:42.180 --> 00:43.700
 We are also going to talk about

00:43.700 --> 00:46.740
 how we can learn to relax while focusing,

00:46.740 --> 00:49.140
 which turns out to be a critical component

00:49.140 --> 00:51.160
 of learning new information

00:51.160 --> 00:54.840
 and for coming up with new creative ideas.

00:54.840 --> 00:59.100
 So whether or not you have ADHD or know someone who does,

00:59.100 --> 01:02.620
 or if you're somebody who feels that they do not have ADHD,

01:02.620 --> 01:05.940
 but would simply like to improve their ability to focus

01:05.940 --> 01:07.700
 or to be more creative,

01:07.700 --> 01:10.240
 this episode is definitely for you as well.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.920
 We are going to talk about drug-based tools

01:13.920 --> 01:14.820
 that are out there.

01:14.820 --> 01:17.000
 We are going to talk about behavioral tools.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.220
 We will talk about the role of diet and supplementation,

01:20.220 --> 01:21.420
 and we will talk about

01:21.420 --> 01:24.780
 new emerging brain machine interface devices

01:24.780 --> 01:27.540
 things like transcranial magnetic stimulation.

01:27.540 --> 01:29.080
 If you don't know what that is, don't worry.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.580
 I will explain it to you.

01:30.580 --> 01:34.660
 These are non-invasive methods for rewiring your brain

01:34.660 --> 01:38.540
 in order to make focusing more natural for you

01:38.540 --> 01:41.860
 and to teach you how to increase your depth of focus.

01:41.860 --> 01:43.340
 Now, just a quick reminder

01:43.340 --> 01:47.080
 that anytime we discuss a psychiatric disorder,

01:47.080 --> 01:49.080
 it's important that we remember

01:49.080 --> 01:52.020
 that all of us have the temptation to self-diagnose

01:52.020 --> 01:53.960
 or to diagnose others.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.580
 So as I list off some of the symptomology of ADHD,

01:56.580 --> 01:58.660
 some of that symptomology might resonate with you.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.860
 You might think, oh, maybe I have ADHD,

02:00.860 --> 02:02.820
 or you might decide that someone you know

02:02.820 --> 02:05.180
 definitely has ADHD.

02:05.180 --> 02:08.200
 However, it is very important that you don't self-diagnose

02:08.200 --> 02:10.280
 or diagnose somebody else.

02:10.280 --> 02:14.420
 The clear and real diagnosis of ADHD

02:14.420 --> 02:18.620
 really should be carried out by a psychiatrist, a physician,

02:18.620 --> 02:21.540
 or a very well-trained clinical psychologist.

02:21.540 --> 02:26.540
 There are clear criteria for what constitutes full-blown ADHD.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.040
 However, many of us have constellations of symptoms

02:31.040 --> 02:34.980
 that make us somewhat like somebody with ADHD.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.820
 And if you're struggling with focus nowadays,

02:36.820 --> 02:39.980
 as a lot of people are, because of stress,

02:39.980 --> 02:42.100
 because of smartphone use,

02:42.100 --> 02:46.280
 which turns out can induce adult ADHD, we'll talk about that,

02:46.280 --> 02:48.900
 well, then pay attention to the symptomology.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.180
 You may actually require professional treatment.

02:51.180 --> 02:52.300
 You might not.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.420
 Equally important is to remember that some of the terms

02:54.420 --> 02:57.180
 that we cover like impulse control and attention

02:57.180 --> 02:59.740
 and concentration are somewhat subjective

02:59.740 --> 03:01.460
 and they can change over time.

03:01.460 --> 03:04.940
 Sometimes we have a better level of attention than others.

03:04.940 --> 03:06.260
 Maybe it depends on how we slept

03:06.260 --> 03:08.000
 or other events going on in our life,

03:08.000 --> 03:10.500
 or something that we're entirely unaware of.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.940
 The important thing to remember

03:11.940 --> 03:15.000
 is that we can all improve our attentional capacity.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.220
 We can all rewire the circuits

03:17.220 --> 03:21.140
 that make heightened levels of focus more accessible to us.

03:21.140 --> 03:24.020
 We can do that through multiple types of interventions

03:24.020 --> 03:27.660
 and we are going to cover all those interventions today.

03:27.660 --> 03:29.080
 Before we march into the material,

03:29.080 --> 03:31.120
 I'd like to remind that this podcast is separate

03:31.120 --> 03:33.340
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:33.340 --> 03:35.460
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:35.460 --> 03:38.300
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:38.300 --> 03:41.240
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.380
 In keeping with that theme,

03:42.380 --> 03:45.260
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:45.260 --> 03:47.260
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

03:47.260 --> 03:49.460
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:49.460 --> 03:51.920
 that are of the utmost quality.

03:51.920 --> 03:54.220
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system

03:54.220 --> 03:55.820
 and I can tell you that there are many features

03:55.820 --> 03:57.420
 built into our visual system

03:57.420 --> 03:59.380
 that allows us to see things clearly,

03:59.380 --> 04:02.780
 whether or not we are in shade or bright sunlight, et cetera.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.620
 A lot of sunglasses have the problem

04:04.620 --> 04:06.720
 that you have to constantly take them off

04:06.720 --> 04:07.720
 and put them back on again

04:07.720 --> 04:10.700
 because of changes in background luminance, as we call it.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.660
 Roca sunglasses have solved this problem.

04:12.660 --> 04:15.100
 It doesn't matter if you're standing in tree shade

04:15.100 --> 04:17.380
 or a bright light or what have you,

04:17.380 --> 04:19.700
 you can always see things with perfect clarity.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.580
 And that shows that they really understand

04:21.580 --> 04:23.540
 the way that the visual system works

04:23.540 --> 04:26.640
 and their eyeglasses are built accordingly.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.320
 I wear readers at night.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.940
 So I wear eyeglasses to read at night

04:30.940 --> 04:32.140
 or when I drive at night

04:32.140 --> 04:35.560
 and their readers and eyeglasses are terrific as well.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.620
 One thing I like so much about their eyeglasses

04:37.620 --> 04:39.020
 and their sunglasses is that

04:39.020 --> 04:41.220
 despite being quote unquote performance glasses,

04:41.220 --> 04:42.380
 meaning you can wear them while running

04:42.380 --> 04:44.320
 or swimming or biking, they don't fall off your face

04:44.320 --> 04:46.220
 even if you get sweaty, they're very lightweight,

04:46.220 --> 04:47.920
 you don't even notice that they're on,

04:47.920 --> 04:50.540
 is that the aesthetic is really good.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.840
 A lot of performance glasses,

04:51.840 --> 04:53.600
 they look kind of ridiculous, frankly,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.500
 they make people look like cyborgs,

04:55.500 --> 04:56.720
 but their aesthetics are terrific.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.080
 They have a lot of different styles you can select from.

04:59.080 --> 05:01.100
 The company was founded by two All-American swimmers

05:01.100 --> 05:03.340
 from Stanford and everything about their sunglasses

05:03.340 --> 05:05.820
 and eyeglasses were designed with optical clarity

05:05.820 --> 05:07.280
 and performance in mind.

05:07.280 --> 05:09.900
 If you'd like to try Roca, you can go to roca.com,

05:09.900 --> 05:13.360

05:15.460 --> 05:18.340
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Belcampo.

05:18.340 --> 05:21.300
 Belcampo is a regenerative farm in Northern California

05:21.300 --> 05:22.980
 that raises organic grass-fed

05:22.980 --> 05:25.980
 and finished certified humane meat.

05:25.980 --> 05:28.000
 I tend to eat meat about once a day.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.700
 So typically I'll fast until about noon or one,

05:30.700 --> 05:33.060
 and then my lunch consists of a small piece of steak

05:33.060 --> 05:34.940
 or chicken and some salad,

05:34.940 --> 05:37.360
 and then I tend to eat my carbohydrates in the evening

05:37.360 --> 05:38.640
 before I go to sleep.

05:38.640 --> 05:40.300
 Sometimes, and especially lately,

05:40.300 --> 05:42.500
 I'm eating my protein earlier in the day

05:42.500 --> 05:44.920
 because I'm playing around with some of the findings

05:44.920 --> 05:46.820
 related to protein intake early in the day.

05:46.820 --> 05:49.340
 But regardless, I'm eating meat about once a day.

05:49.340 --> 05:51.660
 For me, it's extremely important that any meat

05:51.660 --> 05:55.020
 that I consume come from humanely raised animals

05:55.020 --> 05:57.700
 and that the meat be of the very highest quality.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.020
 So with Belcampo meats,

05:59.020 --> 06:01.980
 the animals graze on open pastures and seasonal grasses,

06:01.980 --> 06:04.300
 which results in meats that's much higher in nutrients

06:04.300 --> 06:06.140
 and healthy fats, including omega-3s,

06:06.140 --> 06:08.460
 which I've talked a lot about on this podcast,

06:08.460 --> 06:11.020
 the importance of omega-3s for heart health,

06:11.020 --> 06:14.340
 for brain health, for mood, et cetera.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.200
 Personally, I love their ribeye steaks,

06:16.200 --> 06:19.220
 their New York steaks, their chicken is terrific,

06:19.220 --> 06:21.040
 and I also like the organic meatballs.

06:21.040 --> 06:24.600
 All the old meat is organic and grass-fed and grass-finished.

06:24.600 --> 06:25.980
 If you'd like to try Belcampo,

06:25.980 --> 06:27.980
 first-time customers can get 20% off

06:27.980 --> 06:30.780
 by going to belcampo.com slash Huberman

06:30.780 --> 06:33.220
 and using the code Huberman at checkout.

06:33.220 --> 06:35.900
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

06:35.900 --> 06:38.480
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

06:38.480 --> 06:40.500
 that are absolutely second to none.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.180
 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

06:42.180 --> 06:43.980
 about eight, nine months ago,

06:43.980 --> 06:46.500
 and I've never slept better in my life.

06:46.500 --> 06:47.700
 If you go to the Helix site,

06:47.700 --> 06:49.740
 they have a short two-minute quiz,

06:49.740 --> 06:51.660
 and that quiz asks you questions like,

06:51.660 --> 06:52.700
 do you sleep on your back?

06:52.700 --> 06:53.580
 Do you sleep on your side?

06:53.580 --> 06:54.420
 Do you sleep on your stomach?

06:54.420 --> 06:56.440
 Do you tend to run hot or cold in the middle of the night?

06:56.440 --> 06:57.280
 Maybe you don't know,

06:57.280 --> 07:00.420
 and they actually have an option to select I don't know.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.000
 And Helix will match you to a mattress

07:03.000 --> 07:04.980
 that's specific to your sleep needs.

07:04.980 --> 07:06.180
 This turns out to be really important.

07:06.180 --> 07:08.820
 Some people have the tendency to run hot

07:08.820 --> 07:09.660
 and sleep on their stomach.

07:09.660 --> 07:10.980
 Other people lie on their back

07:10.980 --> 07:13.460
 and they're waking up cold in the middle of the night.

07:13.460 --> 07:14.480
 So you really need a mattress

07:14.480 --> 07:16.460
 that's matched to your sleep needs.

07:16.460 --> 07:20.340
 I did that, and I matched to the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,

07:20.340 --> 07:24.220
 and it turns out to be perfect for me and my sleep needs.

07:24.220 --> 07:25.960
 As well, their pillows are really terrific.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.780
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

07:27.780 --> 07:30.860
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

07:30.860 --> 07:32.080
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

07:32.080 --> 07:34.220
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress.

07:34.220 --> 07:37.260
 And you'll get up to $200 off any of their mattresses,

07:37.260 --> 07:39.660
 and you'll get two free pillows with your order.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.100
 They have a 10-year warranty.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.380
 You get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.

07:43.380 --> 07:44.460
 That's more than three months.

07:44.460 --> 07:46.640
 And if you don't like it, they'll pick it up for you,

07:46.640 --> 07:49.260
 and they'll take it away, and you get all your money back.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.620
 So if you're interested, go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

07:52.620 --> 07:56.340
 for up to $200 off your mattress and two free pillows.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.220
 So let's talk about ADHD,

07:58.220 --> 08:00.920
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

08:00.920 --> 08:03.220
 Let's also talk about focus and attention

08:03.220 --> 08:06.080
 and everybody's ability to focus and attend,

08:06.080 --> 08:08.540
 not just people with ADHD.

08:08.540 --> 08:10.100
 We are also going to talk about tools

08:10.100 --> 08:13.900
 that would allow anyone, whether or not they have ADHD or not

08:13.900 --> 08:16.920
 to enhance their level of concentration and focus.

08:18.020 --> 08:21.620
 Now, ADHD used to be called ADD,

08:21.620 --> 08:23.340
 attention deficit disorder.

08:24.660 --> 08:27.860
 We have record of ADD in the medical literature

08:27.860 --> 08:30.620
 dating back to as early as 1904.

08:30.620 --> 08:32.620
 Now, there's nothing special about 1904.

08:32.620 --> 08:34.060
 That's just the first time that it showed up

08:34.060 --> 08:36.720
 in the standard medical literature.

08:36.720 --> 08:41.580
 We have to believe that ADD, which we now call ADHD,

08:41.580 --> 08:46.420
 existed before 1904 and probably long before 1904.

08:46.420 --> 08:47.260
 Why?

08:47.260 --> 08:50.220
 Well, because it has a strong genetic component.

08:50.220 --> 08:53.800
 If you have a close relative that has ADHD,

08:53.800 --> 08:57.240
 there's a much higher probability that you will have ADHD.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.980
 And that probability goes up depending on how closely

08:59.980 --> 09:02.060
 related to that person you happen to be.

09:02.060 --> 09:04.460
 So for instance, if you're an identical twin

09:04.460 --> 09:06.760
 and your twin has ADHD,

09:06.760 --> 09:09.840
 there's a very high concordance, as we say,

09:09.840 --> 09:12.860
 a very high probability that you will have ADHD,

09:12.860 --> 09:15.200
 up to 75% chance.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.100
 If you have a fraternal twin with ADHD,

09:17.100 --> 09:20.620
 that number goes down a bit in the 50 to 60% range

09:20.620 --> 09:21.520
 and so on.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.540
 If you have a parent with ADHD,

09:23.540 --> 09:26.820
 that number ranges anywhere from 10 to 25% likelihood

09:26.820 --> 09:28.700
 that you will have ADHD if you have two parents

09:28.700 --> 09:29.980
 and so on and so on.

09:29.980 --> 09:31.700
 Okay, so there's a genetic component.

09:31.700 --> 09:33.380
 That genetic component, it turns out,

09:33.380 --> 09:36.300
 relates directly to how specific neural circuits

09:36.300 --> 09:39.300
 in the brain wire up, the chemicals they use

09:39.300 --> 09:41.180
 and the way they use those chemicals,

09:41.180 --> 09:44.220
 a topic that we are going to discuss in depth today.

09:45.220 --> 09:48.100
 Now, if you have a close relative with ADHD,

09:48.100 --> 09:51.460
 that does not mean that you are fated to have ADHD.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.820
 And if you happen to have ADHD,

09:53.820 --> 09:56.640
 there are ways to overcome those symptoms

09:56.640 --> 10:00.100
 of lack of attention, impulsivity, and so on.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.440
 Another important point about ADHD

10:03.440 --> 10:06.420
 is that it has nothing to do with intelligence.

10:06.420 --> 10:08.100
 Whether or not we're talking about intelligence

10:08.100 --> 10:10.440
 measured by a standard IQ test,

10:10.440 --> 10:13.020
 a rather controversial issue as many of you probably know,

10:13.020 --> 10:15.340
 there are lots of forms of intelligence

10:15.340 --> 10:18.380
 that a standard IQ test just wouldn't pick up.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.180
 Emotional intelligence, musical intelligence,

10:20.180 --> 10:23.260
 spatial intelligence, all sorts of intelligences.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.860
 None of them are related to ADHD.

10:27.860 --> 10:30.500
 Being very high functioning doesn't make you more likely

10:30.500 --> 10:31.980
 to have ADHD.

10:31.980 --> 10:34.380
 And being ADHD doesn't necessarily mean

10:34.380 --> 10:35.260
 that you have a low IQ.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.840
 So there are people with ADHD who have low IQs,

10:37.840 --> 10:39.880
 people with ADHD with high IQs,

10:39.880 --> 10:42.260
 people with ADHD with high emotional IQ

10:42.260 --> 10:45.440
 or with low IQ in the emotional scale.

10:45.440 --> 10:46.600
 It's all over the place.

10:46.600 --> 10:50.000
 The important point is that your ability to attend and focus

10:50.000 --> 10:52.620
 does not relate to how smart you are

10:52.620 --> 10:57.020
 or your IQ of any type, not just a standard IQ.

10:57.020 --> 11:00.300
 The renaming of ADD to ADHD

11:00.300 --> 11:03.300
 took place in the mid to late 1980s

11:03.300 --> 11:05.020
 when the psychiatric community

11:05.020 --> 11:06.880
 and the psychological community

11:06.880 --> 11:10.100
 started taking better notice of the fact

11:10.100 --> 11:14.820
 that so-called hyperactive kids also had attentional issues.

11:14.820 --> 11:16.120
 This might seem obvious,

11:16.120 --> 11:19.820
 but there's been extensive and ongoing revision

11:19.820 --> 11:23.580
 of the criteria for designating a psychiatric disorder.

11:23.580 --> 11:27.100
 And this is still an ongoing process, even today.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.940
 So in the mid 80s, we started hearing about ADHD

11:29.940 --> 11:33.100
 and then gradually that term ADD has been dropped away.

11:33.100 --> 11:37.660
 However, just the renaming of ADD to ADHD

11:38.520 --> 11:43.520
 has led to much better diagnosis and detection of ADHD.

11:44.740 --> 11:46.420
 So right now, the current estimates

11:46.420 --> 11:49.340
 are that about one in 10 children

11:49.340 --> 11:53.020
 and probably more have ADHD.

11:53.020 --> 11:55.800
 The current estimates are anywhere from 10%,

11:55.800 --> 11:58.780
 one in 10, to as high as 12%.

11:58.780 --> 12:00.860
 Now, fortunately, about half of those

12:00.860 --> 12:03.700
 will resolve with proper treatment,

12:03.700 --> 12:05.920
 but the other half typically don't.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.660
 The other thing that we are seeing a lot nowadays

12:08.660 --> 12:13.340
 is increased levels of ADHD in adults.

12:13.340 --> 12:14.620
 And there's some question

12:14.620 --> 12:17.340
 as to whether or not those adults had ADHD

12:17.340 --> 12:19.940
 that went undetected during their childhood

12:19.940 --> 12:24.020
 or whether or not ADHD is now cropping up in adulthood

12:24.020 --> 12:27.540
 due to the way that we are interacting with the world.

12:27.540 --> 12:30.080
 In particular, smartphone use,

12:30.980 --> 12:34.520
 the combination of email, text, real world interactions,

12:35.860 --> 12:39.620
 multiple apps and streams of media and social media

12:39.620 --> 12:42.060
 all coming in at once, trying to manage life,

12:42.060 --> 12:44.540
 all of the things that are going on

12:44.540 --> 12:49.100
 are creating a kind of cloud of pulls on our attention.

12:49.100 --> 12:50.740
 And so there is this question

12:50.740 --> 12:54.100
 to whether or not we are creating ADHD in adults

12:54.100 --> 12:58.100
 that never had ADHD prior to being an adult.

12:59.060 --> 13:00.640
 So let's talk about attention.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.220
 And first, let's just define what we mean by attention.

13:04.220 --> 13:05.980
 Out there in the scientific literature

13:05.980 --> 13:08.140
 and in discussions about ADHD,

13:08.140 --> 13:10.780
 we will hear things like attention and focus

13:10.780 --> 13:13.540
 and concentration and impulse control.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.760
 For sake of today's discussion,

13:15.760 --> 13:17.780
 attention, focus and concentration

13:17.780 --> 13:20.060
 are essentially the same thing, okay?

13:20.060 --> 13:22.180
 We could split hairs and the scientific literature

13:22.180 --> 13:23.920
 does split hairs about these,

13:23.920 --> 13:25.700
 but if we want to understand the biology

13:25.700 --> 13:28.080
 and we want to have a straightforward conversation

13:28.080 --> 13:31.420
 about ADHD, if I say attention or focus,

13:31.420 --> 13:33.620
 I'm basically referring to the same thing

13:33.620 --> 13:36.080
 unless I specify otherwise, okay?

13:36.080 --> 13:41.080
 So people with ADHD have trouble holding their attention.

13:41.540 --> 13:43.660
 What is attention?

13:43.660 --> 13:46.580
 Well, attention is perception.

13:46.580 --> 13:50.520
 It's how we are perceiving the sensory world.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.620
 So just a little bit of neurobiology 101,

13:52.620 --> 13:54.620
 we are sensing things all the time.

13:54.620 --> 13:56.380
 There's information coming into our nervous system

13:56.380 --> 13:57.200
 all the time.

13:57.200 --> 13:59.680
 For instance, right now, you're hearing sound waves,

13:59.680 --> 14:00.700
 you are seeing things,

14:00.700 --> 14:02.700
 you are sensing things against your skin,

14:02.700 --> 14:06.120
 but you are only paying attention to some of those.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.660
 And the ones that you're paying attention to

14:08.660 --> 14:09.780
 are your perceptions.

14:09.780 --> 14:12.860
 So if you hear my voice, you are perceiving my voice.

14:12.860 --> 14:15.820
 You are not paying attention to your other senses

14:15.820 --> 14:17.020
 at the moment, okay?

14:17.020 --> 14:18.820
 You might even be outside in a breeze.

14:18.820 --> 14:19.860
 And until I said that,

14:19.860 --> 14:21.940
 you might not be perceiving that breeze,

14:21.940 --> 14:23.900
 but your body was sensing it all along.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.320
 So attention and focus are more or less the same thing,

14:28.320 --> 14:31.000
 but impulse control is something separate

14:31.000 --> 14:34.040
 because impulse control requires pushing out

14:34.040 --> 14:35.860
 or putting the blinders on

14:35.860 --> 14:38.340
 to sensory events in our environment.

14:38.340 --> 14:40.120
 It means lack of perception.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.020
 Impulse control is about limiting our perception.

14:43.020 --> 14:47.580
 Because people with ADHD have poor attention

14:47.580 --> 14:50.020
 and they have high levels of impulsivity.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.500
 They are easily distractible.

14:52.500 --> 14:55.700
 But the way that shows up is very surprising.

14:55.700 --> 14:58.280
 You might think that people with ADHD

14:58.280 --> 15:00.300
 just simply can't attend to anything.

15:00.300 --> 15:03.060
 They really can't focus even if they really want to,

15:03.060 --> 15:05.440
 but that's simply not the case.

15:05.440 --> 15:09.620
 People with ADHD, yes, they are distractible.

15:09.620 --> 15:12.000
 Yes, they are impulsive.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.840
 Yes, they are easily annoyed

15:13.840 --> 15:15.460
 by things happening in the room.

15:15.460 --> 15:18.260
 They sometimes have a high level of emotionality as well.

15:18.260 --> 15:19.980
 Not always, but often.

15:19.980 --> 15:24.260
 However, people with ADHD can have a hyper-focus,

15:24.260 --> 15:27.060
 an incredible ability to focus

15:27.060 --> 15:31.780
 on things that they really enjoy or are intrigued by.

15:31.780 --> 15:33.560
 Now, this is a very important point

15:33.560 --> 15:37.340
 because typically we think of somebody with ADHD

15:37.340 --> 15:40.060
 as being really wild and hyperactive

15:40.060 --> 15:44.240
 or having no ability whatsoever to sit still and attend.

15:44.240 --> 15:46.780
 And while that phenotype, as we call it,

15:46.780 --> 15:51.520
 that contour of behavior and cognition can exist,

15:52.460 --> 15:55.340
 many people, if not all people with ADHD,

15:55.340 --> 15:57.680
 if you give them something they really love,

15:57.680 --> 15:59.480
 like if the child loves video games

15:59.480 --> 16:01.300
 or if a child loves to draw

16:01.300 --> 16:05.420
 or if an adult loves a particular type of movie

16:05.420 --> 16:07.300
 or a person very much,

16:07.300 --> 16:11.640
 they will obtain laser focus without any effort.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.040
 So that tells us that people with ADHD

16:14.040 --> 16:16.260
 have the capacity to attend,

16:16.260 --> 16:19.180
 but they can't engage that attention

16:19.180 --> 16:22.540
 for things that they don't really, really want to do.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.700
 And as we all know, much of life,

16:24.700 --> 16:26.580
 whether or not you're a child or an adult,

16:26.580 --> 16:28.700
 involves doing a lot of things that we don't want to do.

16:28.700 --> 16:30.320
 Much of our schooling involves doing things

16:30.320 --> 16:32.380
 that we would prefer not to do

16:32.380 --> 16:34.500
 and sort of forcing ourselves to do it,

16:34.500 --> 16:37.380
 to attend even though we are not super interested

16:37.380 --> 16:39.260
 in what we are attending to.

16:39.260 --> 16:40.560
 There are a couple other things

16:40.560 --> 16:43.740
 that people with ADHD display quite often.

16:43.740 --> 16:47.580
 One is challenges with time perception.

16:47.580 --> 16:50.060
 Now, time perception is a fascinating aspect

16:50.060 --> 16:51.060
 of how our brain works.

16:51.060 --> 16:53.020
 And later we're going to talk about time perception

16:53.020 --> 16:56.220
 and how you can actually get better at time perception.

16:56.220 --> 16:58.920
 It's very likely that right now you are doing things

16:58.920 --> 17:01.980
 that get in the way of optimal time perception.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.980
 And I will tell you how to adjust your ability

17:04.980 --> 17:07.820
 to measure time with your brain.

17:08.940 --> 17:12.040
 People with ADHD often run late.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.980
 They often procrastinate.

17:13.980 --> 17:15.660
 But what's interesting and surprising

17:15.660 --> 17:17.900
 is that if they are given a deadline,

17:17.900 --> 17:20.900
 they actually can perceive time very well.

17:20.900 --> 17:23.420
 And they often can focus very well

17:23.420 --> 17:26.180
 if the consequences of not completing a task

17:26.180 --> 17:28.460
 or not attending are severe enough.

17:28.460 --> 17:31.940
 It's a little bit like the way that people with ADHD

17:31.940 --> 17:34.260
 can really focus if they like something.

17:34.260 --> 17:35.740
 Well, if they're scared enough

17:35.740 --> 17:37.800
 about the consequences of not attending,

17:37.800 --> 17:41.040
 oftentimes, not always, but oftentimes they can attend.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.100
 If they're not really concerned

17:44.100 --> 17:46.780
 about a deadline or a consequence,

17:46.780 --> 17:48.740
 well, then they tend to lose track of time

17:48.740 --> 17:52.200
 and they tend to underestimate how long things will take.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.140
 Now, many people do that, not just people with ADHD,

17:55.140 --> 17:58.820
 but people with ADHD have challenges

17:58.820 --> 18:02.540
 understanding how to line up the activities of their day

18:02.540 --> 18:04.640
 in order to meet particular deadlines,

18:04.640 --> 18:06.100
 even if it's just a simple thing

18:06.100 --> 18:10.260
 like finishing one set of tasks before lunch.

18:10.260 --> 18:13.780
 Oftentimes, they will remember that lunch starts at noon,

18:13.780 --> 18:16.940
 but somehow they aren't able to fill the intervening time

18:16.940 --> 18:19.140
 in a way that's productive.

18:19.140 --> 18:21.660
 And they can obsess about the upcoming deadline,

18:21.660 --> 18:22.720
 for instance.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.060
 We will talk about how to remedy this.

18:25.060 --> 18:27.960
 In addition, their spatial organization skills

18:27.960 --> 18:31.580
 are often subpar, not always,

18:31.580 --> 18:34.860
 but often you will find that somebody with ADHD

18:34.860 --> 18:37.120
 uses what's called the pile system

18:37.120 --> 18:39.220
 in order to organize things.

18:39.220 --> 18:41.220
 They will take many belongings

18:41.220 --> 18:43.420
 and this could be in the kitchen or in their bedroom

18:43.420 --> 18:46.560
 or in their office or in any space,

18:46.560 --> 18:48.140
 and they will start piling things up

18:48.140 --> 18:50.020
 according to a categorization system

18:50.020 --> 18:52.380
 that makes sense to them and only them.

18:52.380 --> 18:55.620
 It doesn't really have any logical framework.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.300
 Now, many people use the pile system

18:57.300 --> 18:58.380
 and if you use the pile system,

18:58.380 --> 18:59.900
 that doesn't mean that you have ADHD.

18:59.900 --> 19:01.540
 In fact, if you're unpacking a house

19:01.540 --> 19:03.180
 or you've moved recently

19:03.180 --> 19:05.700
 or you've received a lot of presents recently,

19:05.700 --> 19:09.420
 the pile system makes perfect sense to organize your space.

19:09.420 --> 19:12.180
 But people with ADHD tend to organize things

19:12.180 --> 19:14.660
 according to the pile system all the time

19:14.660 --> 19:17.780
 and that pile system doesn't work for them.

19:17.780 --> 19:18.940
 So that's the key distinction,

19:18.940 --> 19:21.420
 that they use a filing system and it's not really files,

19:21.420 --> 19:24.220
 they're piling things up in a way that makes sense to them,

19:24.220 --> 19:25.780
 but then it doesn't work for them

19:25.780 --> 19:29.040
 in terms of what task they actually need to perform.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.360
 They can't find things or if anyone moves one thing,

19:32.360 --> 19:34.820
 then it's very disruptive to their overall plan

19:34.820 --> 19:35.700
 because their overall plan

19:35.700 --> 19:38.100
 doesn't really work in the first place.

19:38.100 --> 19:41.840
 So that's a common phenotype as we call it.

19:41.840 --> 19:44.300
 A phenotype by the way is just an expression

19:44.300 --> 19:48.380
 of a particular set of underlying genetic

19:48.380 --> 19:51.380
 or psychological components, okay?

19:51.380 --> 19:52.500
 So we see the phenotype.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.420
 So a phenotype could be brown hair and green eyes,

19:55.420 --> 19:57.420
 like for me, a phenotype could also be

19:57.420 --> 19:59.580
 that somebody uses the piling system, okay?

20:00.860 --> 20:04.740
 The other thing that people with ADHD have real trouble with

20:04.740 --> 20:06.900
 is so-called working memory.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.440
 Now you might think that people with ADHD

20:08.440 --> 20:09.860
 would have really poor memories,

20:09.860 --> 20:11.380
 but in fact, that's not the case.

20:11.380 --> 20:14.840
 People with ADHD often can have a terrific memory

20:14.840 --> 20:16.140
 for past events,

20:16.140 --> 20:19.120
 they can remember upcoming events quite well,

20:19.120 --> 20:21.140
 their memory is clearly working.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.220
 However, one aspect of memory in particular

20:23.220 --> 20:26.740
 that we call working memory is often disrupted.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.100
 Working memory is the ability

20:28.100 --> 20:30.900
 to keep specific information online,

20:30.900 --> 20:33.180
 to recycle it in your brain over and over again

20:33.180 --> 20:36.580
 so that you can use it in the immediate or short term.

20:36.580 --> 20:39.020
 A good example of this would be you meet somebody,

20:39.020 --> 20:40.420
 they tell you their name,

20:40.420 --> 20:42.200
 they give you their phone number verbally,

20:42.200 --> 20:43.860
 and you have to walk back to your phone

20:43.860 --> 20:46.020
 and enter it into your phone.

20:46.020 --> 20:49.400
 People without ADHD might have to put some effort into it,

20:49.400 --> 20:50.720
 it might feel like a bit of a struggle,

20:50.720 --> 20:52.420
 but typically they would be able to recite

20:52.420 --> 20:54.780
 that phone number in their mind over and over

20:54.780 --> 20:55.740
 and then put it into their phone.

20:55.740 --> 20:58.640
 People with ADHD tend to lose the ability

20:58.640 --> 21:01.860
 or lack the ability to remember things

21:01.860 --> 21:03.340
 that they just need to keep online

21:03.340 --> 21:07.140
 for anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute or two, okay?

21:07.140 --> 21:09.580
 So a string of numbers like six, four, three, seven, eight,

21:09.580 --> 21:12.520
 one for most people would be pretty easy.

21:12.520 --> 21:13.860
 Six, four, three, seven, eight, one,

21:13.860 --> 21:14.820
 six, four, three, seven, eight, one,

21:14.820 --> 21:17.140
 you could probably remember that a minute from now

21:17.140 --> 21:18.780
 without writing it down.

21:18.780 --> 21:20.100
 But if you add one more number

21:20.100 --> 21:23.220
 to that six, four, three, seven, eight, one, three,

21:23.220 --> 21:25.060
 it gets tougher, okay?

21:25.060 --> 21:27.260
 So there's a reason why phone numbers

21:27.260 --> 21:29.800
 typically have seven digits in them.

21:29.800 --> 21:30.980
 Of course, there's an area code,

21:30.980 --> 21:35.500
 but remembering information that strings out longer

21:35.500 --> 21:39.420
 than seven numbers or a sentence or two,

21:39.420 --> 21:41.060
 that's challenging for most people.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.180
 People with ADHD have severe challenges

21:43.180 --> 21:46.060
 even with much smaller batches of information

21:46.060 --> 21:49.420
 over even much smaller batches of time.

21:49.420 --> 21:51.400
 Deficits in working memory are also something

21:51.400 --> 21:54.420
 that we see in people who have frontotemporal dementia,

21:54.420 --> 21:56.080
 so damage to the frontal lobes,

21:56.080 --> 21:59.360
 or age-related cognitive decline.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.020
 And so it will come as no surprise

22:01.020 --> 22:04.860
 that later when we discuss treatments, supplements,

22:04.860 --> 22:07.140
 and other tools for ADHD,

22:07.140 --> 22:09.040
 that many of those treatments, supplements,

22:09.040 --> 22:11.940
 and tools for ADHD are similar to the ones

22:11.940 --> 22:14.740
 that work for age-related cognitive decline.

22:15.860 --> 22:19.300
 Okay, so we've more or less established

22:19.300 --> 22:21.000
 the kind of menu of items

22:21.000 --> 22:23.120
 that people with ADHD tend to have.

22:23.120 --> 22:26.180
 Some have all of them, some have just a subset of them.

22:26.180 --> 22:31.060
 Their severity can range from very intense to mild,

22:31.060 --> 22:35.180
 but in general, it's challenges with attention and focus,

22:35.180 --> 22:36.980
 challenges with impulse control,

22:36.980 --> 22:39.780
 they get annoyed easily, they have kind of an impulsivity,

22:39.780 --> 22:43.680
 they can't stay on task, time perception can be off,

22:44.540 --> 22:46.700
 they use the piling system or a system

22:46.700 --> 22:48.740
 that doesn't work well for them

22:48.740 --> 22:52.160
 in order to organize their things in physical space,

22:52.160 --> 22:54.580
 and they have a hard time with anything that's mundane

22:54.580 --> 22:56.860
 that they're not really interested in.

22:56.860 --> 22:58.380
 But again, I just want to highlight

22:58.380 --> 23:00.580
 that people with ADHD are able

23:00.580 --> 23:02.380
 to obtain heightened levels of focus,

23:02.380 --> 23:05.460
 even hyper-focus for things that are exciting to them

23:05.460 --> 23:07.640
 and that they really want to engage in.

23:07.640 --> 23:10.340
 So now you have the contour of what ADHD is.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.720
 And if you're somebody who doesn't have ADHD,

23:12.720 --> 23:14.580
 you should also be asking yourself

23:14.580 --> 23:18.780
 which aspects of ADHD are similar to things

23:18.780 --> 23:20.600
 I've experienced before,

23:20.600 --> 23:24.080
 because what we know about the healthy brain

23:24.080 --> 23:27.420
 is that there's also a range of abilities to focus.

23:27.420 --> 23:30.140
 Some people focus very well on any task.

23:30.140 --> 23:33.720
 You give them a task, they can just laser in on that task.

23:33.720 --> 23:36.640
 Other people, they have to kind of fight an internal battle.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.860
 They have to convince themselves

23:37.860 --> 23:39.180
 that it's important or interesting.

23:39.180 --> 23:42.860
 They have to kind of incentivize themselves internally.

23:42.860 --> 23:45.660
 Other people, doesn't matter.

23:45.660 --> 23:47.900
 They could be bored to tears with the information,

23:47.900 --> 23:49.420
 but they can do it just because they are,

23:49.420 --> 23:51.580
 quote unquote, very disciplined people.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.000
 We tend to admire those people,

23:53.000 --> 23:54.660
 but as you'll see a little bit later,

23:54.660 --> 23:55.980
 it's not clear that that's the best way

23:55.980 --> 23:57.700
 to run your attentional system.

23:57.700 --> 23:59.900
 There might be something to this business

23:59.900 --> 24:02.020
 of having heightened levels of attention

24:02.020 --> 24:05.280
 for the things that you are most interested or excited by.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.020
 So let's drill into this issue

24:09.020 --> 24:12.900
 of why people with ADHD actually can focus very intensely

24:12.900 --> 24:16.660
 on things that they enjoy and are curious about.

24:16.660 --> 24:21.320
 Now, enjoyment and curiosity are psychological terms.

24:21.320 --> 24:22.900
 They're not even really psychological terms.

24:22.900 --> 24:25.540
 They're just the way that we describe our human experience

24:25.540 --> 24:28.780
 of liking things, wanting to know more about them.

24:28.780 --> 24:31.500
 But from a neurobiological perspective,

24:31.500 --> 24:34.780
 they have a very clear identity and signature,

24:34.780 --> 24:36.260
 and that's dopamine.

24:37.180 --> 24:38.940
 Dopamine is released from neurons.

24:38.940 --> 24:41.140
 It's what we call a neuromodulator.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.240
 And as a neuromodulator,

24:43.240 --> 24:45.820
 it changes the activity of the circuits in the brain

24:45.820 --> 24:49.380
 such that certain circuits are more active than others.

24:49.380 --> 24:52.500
 And in particular, dopamine creates

24:52.500 --> 24:54.820
 a heightened state of focus.

24:54.820 --> 24:57.540
 It tends to contract our visual world,

24:57.540 --> 24:59.580
 and it tends to make us pay attention

24:59.580 --> 25:01.700
 to things that are outside

25:01.700 --> 25:04.060
 and beyond the confines of our skin.

25:04.060 --> 25:06.420
 It's what we call exteroception.

25:06.420 --> 25:10.680
 Dopamine also tends to put us in a state of motivation

25:10.680 --> 25:14.180
 and wanting things outside the confines of our skin.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.540
 So whether or not we're pursuing something physical

25:16.540 --> 25:20.180
 in our world, or whether or not we're pursuing information

25:20.180 --> 25:23.600
 in our outside world, dopamine is largely responsible

25:23.600 --> 25:26.520
 for our ability and our drive to do that.

25:27.460 --> 25:30.780
 But dopamine as a neuromodulator is also involved

25:30.780 --> 25:34.120
 in changing the way that we perceive the world.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.180
 So as I mentioned earlier,

25:35.180 --> 25:37.180
 you have all these senses coming in

25:37.180 --> 25:39.140
 and you can only perceive some of them

25:39.140 --> 25:42.260
 because you're only paying attention to some of them.

25:42.260 --> 25:45.580
 Dopamine, when it's released in our brain,

25:45.580 --> 25:47.860
 tends to turn on areas of our brain

25:47.860 --> 25:51.740
 that narrow our visual focus and our auditory focus.

25:51.740 --> 25:54.300
 So it creates a cone of auditory attention

25:54.300 --> 25:55.620
 that's very narrow,

25:55.620 --> 25:58.840
 creates a tunnel of visual attention that's very narrow.

25:58.840 --> 26:00.680
 Whereas when we have less dopamine,

26:00.680 --> 26:02.780
 we tend to view the entire world.

26:02.780 --> 26:04.900
 We tend to see the whole scene that we are in.

26:04.900 --> 26:07.420
 We tend to hear everything all at once.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.380
 So as I describe this,

26:09.380 --> 26:12.900
 hopefully you're already starting to see and understand

26:12.900 --> 26:17.300
 how having dopamine release can allow a person,

26:17.300 --> 26:20.020
 whether or not they have ADHD or not,

26:20.020 --> 26:22.820
 to direct their attention to particular things

26:22.820 --> 26:24.460
 in their environment, right?

26:24.460 --> 26:27.700
 So now what we're doing is we're moving away from attention

26:27.700 --> 26:30.340
 as this kind of vague, ambiguous term,

26:30.340 --> 26:33.540
 and we're giving it a neurochemical identity, dopamine,

26:33.540 --> 26:36.520
 and we are giving it a neural circuit identity.

26:36.520 --> 26:39.820
 And just to put a little bit of flavor and detail

26:39.820 --> 26:41.580
 on which neurocircuits those are,

26:41.580 --> 26:44.540
 I wanted to discuss two general types of neural circuits

26:44.540 --> 26:46.980
 that dopamine tends to enhance.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.500
 So let's talk neural circuits.

26:48.500 --> 26:50.580
 And for those of you that love hearing

26:50.580 --> 26:54.140
 neuroscience nomenclature, you're going to eat this part up.

26:54.140 --> 26:56.300
 And for those of you that don't like a lot of names

26:56.300 --> 26:59.220
 of brain areas, I invite you to tune out

26:59.220 --> 27:01.900
 or just try and grab the top contour of this.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.780
 I will describe it in pretty general terms,

27:03.780 --> 27:04.920
 but I will give some detail,

27:04.920 --> 27:07.100
 because I know there are some of you out there

27:07.100 --> 27:10.260
 who really want to dig deeper into what the exact structures

27:10.260 --> 27:12.360
 and connectivity is are, okay?

27:12.360 --> 27:14.820
 So there are two main types of circuits

27:14.820 --> 27:17.500
 that we need to think about with respect to ADHD,

27:17.500 --> 27:19.020
 attention and dopamine.

27:19.020 --> 27:22.100
 The first one is called the default mode network.

27:22.100 --> 27:25.700
 The default mode network is the network of brain areas

27:25.700 --> 27:28.500
 in your brain and my brain and in everybody's brain

27:28.500 --> 27:31.840
 that is active when we're not doing anything,

27:31.840 --> 27:34.260
 when we're just sitting there idle at rest.

27:34.260 --> 27:36.520
 Now, it's very hard to not think about anything,

27:36.520 --> 27:39.740
 but when you're not engaged in any type of specific task,

27:39.740 --> 27:42.140
 so you're not driving, you're not playing a video game,

27:42.140 --> 27:44.540
 you're not trying to study, you're not trying to listen,

27:44.540 --> 27:45.460
 you're just sitting there,

27:45.460 --> 27:48.700
 letting your brain kind of go wherever it wants to go,

27:48.700 --> 27:53.060
 your default mode network underlies that state of mind.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.900
 The other set of circuits that we're going to think about

27:56.900 --> 28:01.600
 and talk about with respect to ADHD are the task networks.

28:01.600 --> 28:04.900
 The networks of the brain that make you goal-oriented

28:04.900 --> 28:08.380
 or that are at least trying to make you goal-oriented.

28:08.380 --> 28:11.300
 And those are a completely different set of brain areas.

28:11.300 --> 28:16.300
 However, the default mode network and these task networks

28:16.700 --> 28:18.460
 are communicating with one another,

28:18.460 --> 28:21.200
 and they're doing that in very interesting ways.

28:21.200 --> 28:24.160
 So first I want to describe how these two sets

28:24.160 --> 28:26.060
 of brain areas, the default mode network

28:26.060 --> 28:29.540
 and the task networks normally interact, okay?

28:29.540 --> 28:30.960
 So little bit of naming here.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.260
 Again, feel free to ignore it

28:32.260 --> 28:34.340
 if you don't want this level of detail,

28:34.340 --> 28:38.380
 but the default mode network includes an area

28:38.380 --> 28:41.300
 called the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.500
 Frontal cortex, no surprises in the front,

28:43.500 --> 28:46.660
 and you have a dorsal, the top, and side lateral part,

28:46.660 --> 28:49.020
 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

28:49.020 --> 28:51.460
 You got one on each side of your brain, right?

28:51.460 --> 28:52.480
 And then you have a brain area

28:52.480 --> 28:54.820
 called the posterior cingulate cortex.

28:54.820 --> 28:57.180
 And then you have an area called the lateral parietal lobe.

28:57.180 --> 28:58.860
 Again, you don't need to remember these names,

28:58.860 --> 29:01.500
 but these are three brain areas that normally

29:01.500 --> 29:03.180
 are synchronized in their activity.

29:03.180 --> 29:06.460
 So when one of these areas is active in a typical person,

29:06.460 --> 29:08.580
 the other areas would be active as well.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.820
 So it's a little bit like a symphony or a band,

29:10.820 --> 29:11.780
 like a three-piece band.

29:11.780 --> 29:13.740
 It's like drums, guitar, and bass.

29:13.740 --> 29:16.120
 They're playing together, okay?

29:16.120 --> 29:17.860
 That's how it is in a typical person,

29:17.860 --> 29:19.780
 in a person with ADHD,

29:19.780 --> 29:22.500
 or even a person who has subclinical ADHD,

29:22.500 --> 29:25.980
 or in any human being who hasn't slept well,

29:25.980 --> 29:27.960
 what you find is the default mode network

29:27.960 --> 29:28.960
 is not synchronized.

29:28.960 --> 29:31.780
 These brain areas are just not playing well together.

29:32.820 --> 29:36.060
 Now, the task networks include

29:36.060 --> 29:37.640
 a different set of structures.

29:37.640 --> 29:39.660
 It still involves the prefrontal cortex,

29:39.660 --> 29:42.940
 but it's a different part of the prefrontal cortex, okay?

29:42.940 --> 29:45.660
 Tends to be the medial prefrontal cortex.

29:45.660 --> 29:47.240
 And there are some other brain areas

29:47.240 --> 29:48.700
 that the medial prefrontal cortex

29:48.700 --> 29:50.900
 is communicating to all the time,

29:50.900 --> 29:53.220
 mainly to suppress impulses.

29:53.220 --> 29:56.300
 It's shutting down the desire to stand up

29:56.300 --> 29:58.580
 or to scratch the side of your cheek or your nose

29:58.580 --> 29:59.900
 if you're trying not to do that.

29:59.900 --> 30:01.860
 Anytime you're restricting your behavior,

30:01.860 --> 30:05.600
 these task-directed networks are very active, okay?

30:06.540 --> 30:10.220
 Now, normally, in a person without ADHD,

30:10.220 --> 30:14.020
 the task networks and the default mode networks

30:14.020 --> 30:15.940
 are going in kind of seesaw fashion.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.760
 They are actually what we call anti-correlated.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.720
 So it's not just that they are not correlated.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.820
 They are actually opposing one another.

30:22.820 --> 30:24.280
 They are anti-correlated.

30:24.280 --> 30:28.440
 In a person with ADHD, the default mode networks

30:28.440 --> 30:31.840
 and the task networks are actually more coordinated.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.060
 That might come as surprising.

30:33.060 --> 30:35.900
 I think that we all have this tendency

30:35.900 --> 30:37.800
 to kind of jump to conclusion

30:37.800 --> 30:39.960
 and assume that somebody who doesn't have

30:39.960 --> 30:42.800
 an easy time paying attention or has ADHD,

30:42.800 --> 30:45.520
 that their brain must be completely incoherent,

30:45.520 --> 30:47.080
 that it's not working well

30:47.080 --> 30:48.960
 because everything's out of whack.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.600
 But there's something interesting about people with ADHD

30:51.600 --> 30:56.320
 whereby the task networks and the default mode networks

30:56.320 --> 30:59.360
 are actually working together in a way that's correlated,

30:59.360 --> 31:01.720
 and that is what's abnormal.

31:01.720 --> 31:05.080
 So this would be like the guitar, bass, and the drums

31:05.080 --> 31:06.560
 playing together in a way

31:06.560 --> 31:09.440
 where the bass isn't keeping the backbeat

31:09.440 --> 31:12.100
 and the drums aren't keeping the backbeat,

31:12.100 --> 31:13.300
 that they're playing together,

31:13.300 --> 31:14.920
 they're all playing the melodies and harmonies

31:14.920 --> 31:17.100
 in a way that just doesn't sound right.

31:17.100 --> 31:21.480
 That's what's going on in the brain of somebody with ADHD.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.300
 And we can now confidently say,

31:23.300 --> 31:24.900
 based on brain imaging studies,

31:24.900 --> 31:26.840
 that when somebody gets better

31:26.840 --> 31:28.280
 when they're treated for ADHD

31:28.280 --> 31:32.280
 or when they age out of ADHD, as sometimes is the case,

31:32.280 --> 31:35.720
 that the default mode networks and the task networks

31:35.720 --> 31:38.640
 tend to become anti-correlated again, okay?

31:38.640 --> 31:41.400
 So that's the underlying neurobiology,

31:41.400 --> 31:45.220
 but you'll notice that I didn't mention dopamine at all.

31:45.220 --> 31:47.400
 What dopamine is doing in this context

31:47.400 --> 31:50.540
 is dopamine is acting like a conductor.

31:50.540 --> 31:52.840
 Dopamine is saying this circuit should be active,

31:52.840 --> 31:54.000
 then that circuit should be active.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.480
 It should be default mode network,

31:55.480 --> 31:57.880
 and then when the default mode network is not active,

31:57.880 --> 31:59.280
 then it should be the task network.

31:59.280 --> 32:01.040
 So it's really acting as a conductor saying,

32:01.040 --> 32:03.320
 you go, now you go, now you go, now you go.

32:03.320 --> 32:07.040
 And in ADHD, there's something about the dopamine system

32:07.040 --> 32:10.720
 that is not allowing it to conduct these networks

32:10.720 --> 32:13.920
 and make sure that they stay what the engineers

32:13.920 --> 32:16.640
 or physicists or mathematicians would say out of phase

32:16.640 --> 32:18.720
 to be anti-correlated, okay?

32:18.720 --> 32:19.800
 Out of phase and anti-correlated,

32:19.800 --> 32:21.000
 essentially the same thing,

32:21.000 --> 32:23.480
 at least for purposes of this discussion.

32:23.480 --> 32:25.720
 So that raises two questions.

32:25.720 --> 32:30.480
 Could it be that dopamine is not at sufficiently high levels

32:30.480 --> 32:33.200
 or could it be that dopamine is just doing it all wrong?

32:33.200 --> 32:35.160
 In other words, is there no conductor

32:35.160 --> 32:37.540
 or is the conductor playing with little tiny toothpicks

32:37.540 --> 32:41.000
 and so the instruments can't see what they're supposed to do

32:41.000 --> 32:42.600
 they can't get the instruction

32:42.600 --> 32:45.040
 because it's just not loud enough, so to speak,

32:45.040 --> 32:47.080
 or could it be that the information is getting out

32:47.080 --> 32:49.100
 but the information that's getting out is wrong.

32:49.100 --> 32:49.980
 The conductor is there

32:49.980 --> 32:52.700
 but the conductor isn't very good at conducting.

32:54.160 --> 32:58.880
 Now we can gain insight into how this system works and fails

32:58.880 --> 33:01.800
 and how to treat it by looking at some of the current

33:01.800 --> 33:04.260
 and previous treatments for ADHD,

33:04.260 --> 33:06.320
 as well as some of the recreational drugs

33:06.320 --> 33:09.840
 that people with ADHD tend to pursue and like.

33:09.840 --> 33:12.560
 Now I'm certainly not a proponent of people with ADHD

33:12.560 --> 33:15.520
 taking drugs recreationally, that's not what this is about.

33:15.520 --> 33:18.260
 But if you look at their drug seeking behavior

33:18.260 --> 33:21.500
 and you couple that drug seeking behavior

33:21.500 --> 33:25.520
 to their desire to remedy their attention deficit,

33:25.520 --> 33:28.240
 you start getting some really interesting insight

33:28.240 --> 33:31.640
 into how dopamine is regulating these circuits

33:31.640 --> 33:35.880
 in normal circumstances and in people with ADHD.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.400
 So what exactly is going on with the dopamine system

33:38.400 --> 33:40.240
 in people with ADHD?

33:40.240 --> 33:42.000
 And what's going on with the dopamine system

33:42.000 --> 33:44.920
 in people that have terrific levels of attention

33:44.920 --> 33:46.500
 for any task?

33:46.500 --> 33:50.960
 Well, in the year 2015, an important paper came out,

33:50.960 --> 33:52.800
 the first author is Spencer

33:52.800 --> 33:55.880
 and it came out in a journal called Biological Psychiatry

33:55.880 --> 33:59.920
 and it formalized the so-called low dopamine hypothesis

33:59.920 --> 34:01.880
 of ADHD.

34:01.880 --> 34:04.080
 The idea that dopamine was somehow involved

34:04.080 --> 34:07.300
 or not at the appropriate levels in people with ADHD

34:07.300 --> 34:09.800
 had been around for a pretty long time,

34:09.800 --> 34:14.800
 but a formal proposition of the low dopamine hypothesis

34:14.800 --> 34:17.680
 led to some really important experiments and understanding

34:17.680 --> 34:19.680
 of what goes wrong in ADHD.

34:20.760 --> 34:24.360
 It turns out that if dopamine levels are too low

34:24.360 --> 34:27.120
 in particular circuits in the brain,

34:27.120 --> 34:31.220
 that it leads to unnecessary firing of neurons in the brain

34:31.220 --> 34:35.360
 that are unrelated to the task that one is trying to do

34:35.360 --> 34:37.920
 and that is unrelated to the information

34:37.920 --> 34:39.880
 that one is trying to focus on.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.040
 So if you think back before,

34:41.040 --> 34:42.800
 you've got this default mode network

34:42.800 --> 34:45.640
 and a task-related network and they need to be

34:45.640 --> 34:48.920
 in this kind of concert of anti-correlation and an ADHD,

34:48.920 --> 34:50.900
 they're firing together.

34:50.900 --> 34:54.100
 Well, the problem seems to be that when dopamine is low,

34:55.280 --> 34:57.640
 certain neurons are firing when they shouldn't be.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.120
 This is like a band, right?

34:59.120 --> 35:01.500
 We'll go back to our band, that's a guitar, a bass

35:01.500 --> 35:03.280
 and a person playing the drums.

35:03.280 --> 35:06.640
 And it's as if one of those or several of those instruments

35:06.640 --> 35:09.440
 are playing notes when they shouldn't be playing, right?

35:09.440 --> 35:12.000
 The pauses in music are just as important

35:12.000 --> 35:14.500
 as the actual playing of notes.

35:15.640 --> 35:20.080
 When dopamine is too low, neurons fire more than they should

35:20.080 --> 35:22.080
 in these networks that govern attention.

35:23.040 --> 35:26.260
 This is the so-called low dopamine hypothesis.

35:26.260 --> 35:29.480
 And if you start looking anecdotally

35:29.480 --> 35:33.640
 at what people with ADHD have done for decades,

35:33.640 --> 35:36.640
 not just recently since the low dopamine hypothesis

35:36.640 --> 35:40.200
 has been proposed, but what they were doing in the 1950s

35:40.200 --> 35:42.500
 and in the 1940s and the 1960s,

35:42.500 --> 35:47.500
 what you find is that they tend to use recreational drugs

35:48.040 --> 35:53.040
 or they tend to indulge in non-drug stimulants.

35:53.840 --> 35:57.160
 So things like drinking six cups of coffee

35:57.160 --> 36:01.100
 or quadruple espressos, or when it was more prominent,

36:01.100 --> 36:02.980
 smoking a half a pack of cigarettes

36:02.980 --> 36:05.440
 and drinking four cups of coffee a day.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.980
 Or if the person had access to it,

36:07.980 --> 36:10.080
 using cocaine as a recreational drug

36:10.080 --> 36:12.600
 or amphetamine as a recreational drug,

36:12.600 --> 36:15.840
 all of those substances that I just described,

36:15.840 --> 36:17.720
 in particular cocaine and amphetamine,

36:17.720 --> 36:20.460
 but also coffee and cigarettes,

36:20.460 --> 36:23.560
 increased levels of multiple neurotransmitters,

36:23.560 --> 36:26.880
 but all have the quality of increasing levels of dopamine

36:26.880 --> 36:30.180
 in the brain and in particular in the regions of the brain

36:30.180 --> 36:33.200
 that regulate attention and these task-related

36:33.200 --> 36:35.760
 and default mode networks, okay?

36:35.760 --> 36:38.060
 Now, young children fortunately don't have access

36:38.060 --> 36:39.800
 to those kinds of stimulants.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.120
 Most of the time.

36:41.120 --> 36:44.540
 And those stimulants all have high potential

36:44.540 --> 36:46.400
 for abuse in adults.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.280
 So we will talk about the potential for abuse

36:48.280 --> 36:49.360
 in a few minutes.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.560
 But if you look at children,

36:51.560 --> 36:54.520
 even very young children with ADHD,

36:54.520 --> 36:57.620
 they show things like preference for sugary foods,

36:57.620 --> 37:01.760
 which also act as dopamine inducing stimulants.

37:01.760 --> 37:05.880
 Now, of course, once they get access to soda pop

37:05.880 --> 37:09.100
 and coffee and tea, they start to indulge in those

37:09.100 --> 37:10.120
 more than other people.

37:10.120 --> 37:12.380
 For a long time, it was thought that children with ADHD

37:12.380 --> 37:15.640
 consumed too many sugary foods or drank too much soda,

37:15.640 --> 37:19.800
 or adults with ADHD would take recreational drugs

37:19.800 --> 37:21.840
 like methamphetamine or cocaine,

37:21.840 --> 37:24.040
 or would drink coffee to excess

37:24.040 --> 37:25.840
 or smoke cigarettes to excess

37:25.840 --> 37:28.200
 because they had poor levels of attention

37:28.200 --> 37:31.160
 and because they couldn't make good decisions,

37:31.160 --> 37:33.340
 they were too impulsive and so forth.

37:33.340 --> 37:35.620
 And while that certainly could be the case,

37:35.620 --> 37:37.880
 knowing what we now know about dopamine

37:37.880 --> 37:41.920
 and the fact that having enough dopamine is required

37:41.920 --> 37:43.580
 in order to coordinate these neural circuits

37:43.580 --> 37:46.580
 that allow for focus and quality decision-making,

37:47.460 --> 37:51.120
 an equally valid idea is that these children

37:51.120 --> 37:53.840
 and these adults are actually trying to self-medicate

37:53.840 --> 37:56.120
 by pursuing these compounds, right?

37:56.120 --> 37:59.080
 Things like cocaine lead to huge increases in dopamine.

37:59.080 --> 38:03.260
 Well, what happens when somebody with ADHD takes that drug?

38:03.260 --> 38:06.160
 It turns out they actually obtain heightened levels

38:06.160 --> 38:08.680
 of focus, their ability to focus on things

38:08.680 --> 38:12.480
 other than things they absolutely care intensely about

38:12.480 --> 38:13.680
 goes up.

38:13.680 --> 38:16.520
 Likewise, children who consume anything

38:16.520 --> 38:19.040
 that increases their levels of dopamine,

38:19.040 --> 38:23.760
 if those children have ADHD, they tend to be calmer.

38:23.760 --> 38:25.800
 They tend to be able to focus more.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.480
 Now, this is very different than children

38:28.480 --> 38:29.840
 who do not have ADHD.

38:29.840 --> 38:30.920
 When they consume too much sugar,

38:30.920 --> 38:33.200
 they tend to become super hyperactive.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.920
 When they consume any kind of stimulant,

38:34.920 --> 38:37.240
 they tend to go wild and run around like crazy.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.640
 I actually have an anecdote about this

38:38.640 --> 38:40.340
 just to illustrate it.

38:40.340 --> 38:42.520
 I have a friend, he has two children

38:42.520 --> 38:44.440
 that are now in their teens and 20s,

38:44.440 --> 38:45.680
 but when they were little,

38:45.680 --> 38:48.220
 one time I brought them some chocolate just as a gift

38:48.220 --> 38:49.740
 when I showed up at their house.

38:49.740 --> 38:51.640
 And within 30 minutes,

38:51.640 --> 38:53.680
 the kids were running around like crazy.

38:53.680 --> 38:56.080
 I mean, they were pretty high energy kids,

38:56.080 --> 38:57.760
 but they were going bonkers.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.800
 And that's actually when the mother,

38:59.800 --> 39:02.140
 my friend at the time, unfortunately still now,

39:02.140 --> 39:02.980
 looked at the chocolate

39:02.980 --> 39:05.840
 and realized that it was chocolate with espresso beans

39:05.840 --> 39:07.520
 and it was like dark chocolate espresso beans.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.120
 So I was really at fault there.

39:09.120 --> 39:10.280
 You don't want to give kids

39:10.280 --> 39:11.540
 dark chocolate with espresso beans,

39:11.540 --> 39:14.220
 but what you're really seeing in that hyperactivity,

39:14.220 --> 39:15.720
 that is dopamine, okay?

39:15.720 --> 39:18.680
 It's the sugar combined with the caffeine in this case,

39:18.680 --> 39:21.320
 combined with a few other compounds that exist in chocolate

39:21.320 --> 39:23.440
 that really increase our levels of alertness

39:23.440 --> 39:25.880
 and our tendency to want to move around a lot.

39:26.960 --> 39:31.200
 Okay, so dopamine and low levels of dopamine

39:31.200 --> 39:34.940
 apparently are what's wrong in people with ADHD.

39:34.940 --> 39:38.060
 That dopamine hypothesis is what led to the idea

39:38.060 --> 39:41.680
 that treating people, children and adults included,

39:41.680 --> 39:44.440
 with dopaminergic compounds

39:44.440 --> 39:48.400
 would somehow increase their ability to focus.

39:48.400 --> 39:51.360
 And if you look at the major drugs that were developed

39:51.360 --> 39:53.960
 and now marketed by pharmaceutical companies

39:53.960 --> 39:55.760
 for the treatment of ADHD,

39:56.880 --> 39:59.800
 those drugs have names like Ritalin.

39:59.800 --> 40:03.600
 Nowadays, it's typically things like Adderall,

40:03.600 --> 40:06.160
 Modafinil, and some of the other derivatives,

40:06.160 --> 40:09.200
 they all serve to increase levels of dopamine,

40:09.200 --> 40:11.300
 in particular dopamine in the networks

40:11.300 --> 40:13.640
 that control task-directed behavior

40:13.640 --> 40:16.700
 and that coordinate the default mode network

40:16.700 --> 40:18.800
 and these task-related networks.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.880
 So many of you have probably heard of Ritalin.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.480
 Ritalin is a prescription stimulant

40:23.480 --> 40:28.240
 that is prescribed for ADHD as well as for narcolepsy.

40:28.240 --> 40:30.000
 Narcolepsy is a condition

40:30.000 --> 40:32.800
 in which people tend to fall asleep during the daytime

40:32.800 --> 40:35.000
 quite a lot, excessive daytime sleepiness,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.200
 not due to lack of sleep at night,

40:37.200 --> 40:39.840
 but also tend to fall asleep when they get excited.

40:39.840 --> 40:42.880
 If they're really emotionally excited or about to eat

40:42.880 --> 40:44.240
 or any other kind of activity

40:44.240 --> 40:47.440
 that would normally get somebody really aroused and alert,

40:47.440 --> 40:49.360
 people with narcolepsy tend to fall asleep

40:49.360 --> 40:51.880
 or they tend to become what's called cataplectic.

40:51.880 --> 40:54.480
 They tend to just sort of go limp in the muscles.

40:54.480 --> 40:57.120
 So it's this invasion of sleep into the daytime.

40:57.120 --> 40:59.000
 It's dysregulated by emotion.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.840
 You can imagine why a stimulant,

41:00.840 --> 41:02.240
 something that would wake you up,

41:02.240 --> 41:04.180
 make you very alert, focused, and motivated

41:04.180 --> 41:07.400
 would be a good treatment for narcolepsy.

41:07.400 --> 41:11.720
 Adderall also is used to treat ADHD

41:11.720 --> 41:13.720
 and to treat narcolepsy.

41:13.720 --> 41:17.160
 Things like modafinil also used to treat ADHD

41:17.160 --> 41:18.140
 and narcolepsy.

41:18.140 --> 41:19.760
 So you're sensing a theme here.

41:19.760 --> 41:21.980
 So what are the differences and similarities

41:21.980 --> 41:22.820
 between these drugs?

41:22.820 --> 41:25.040
 And what can that tell us about ADHD?

41:25.040 --> 41:29.380
 Well, Ritalin was one of the first-generation drugs

41:29.380 --> 41:31.980
 that was prescribed for ADHD

41:31.980 --> 41:36.140
 in order to deal head-on with this dopamine hypothesis,

41:36.140 --> 41:40.320
 this idea that in ADHD, dopamine levels are too low.

41:40.320 --> 41:43.440
 Nowadays, Adderall is the more typically prescribed drug

41:43.440 --> 41:45.180
 for ADHD.

41:45.180 --> 41:47.800
 That has to do with some of the so-called pharmacokinetics,

41:47.800 --> 41:50.760
 the rate at which those drugs enter the system

41:50.760 --> 41:52.780
 and how long they last in the system.

41:52.780 --> 41:56.080
 So for instance, Ritalin was a drug that was packaged

41:56.080 --> 41:58.300
 into various time-release formulas,

41:58.300 --> 42:02.120
 whereas initially Adderall was only released in a form

42:02.120 --> 42:03.600
 that had a very short life,

42:03.600 --> 42:07.300
 so meaning that it wasn't in the bloodstream very long

42:07.300 --> 42:08.960
 and didn't affect the brain for very long.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.480
 And so the dosages could be controlled

42:11.480 --> 42:13.000
 in a more typical way

42:13.000 --> 42:15.880
 without going into a lot of tangential detail.

42:15.880 --> 42:17.960
 As you all know, at different times of day,

42:17.960 --> 42:19.860
 you tend to be more or less alert.

42:19.860 --> 42:22.620
 So a long sustained release drug

42:22.620 --> 42:24.920
 while that might sound like a really terrific thing,

42:24.920 --> 42:27.840
 if that drug is having an effect of making you more alert

42:27.840 --> 42:31.140
 and it's released across very many hours of your day,

42:31.140 --> 42:34.360
 there might be periods of your day when you feel too alert,

42:34.360 --> 42:36.240
 periods of your day when you feel just right

42:36.240 --> 42:37.080
 and periods of your day

42:37.080 --> 42:39.240
 when you wished that you were more alert.

42:39.240 --> 42:41.580
 These are some of the pharmacokinetics,

42:41.580 --> 42:44.400
 kinetics meaning movement of the different compounds

42:44.400 --> 42:46.720
 within the bloodstream and brain that could,

42:46.720 --> 42:49.120
 you could imagine in a very real way would impact

42:49.120 --> 42:50.760
 whether or not someone would feel really good

42:50.760 --> 42:51.720
 on one of these drugs

42:51.720 --> 42:53.680
 or whether or not they would feel too anxious

42:53.680 --> 42:55.120
 or too sleepy and so on.

42:56.240 --> 42:57.380
 Let's take a step back for a second

42:57.380 --> 42:59.340
 and just ask what are these drugs?

42:59.340 --> 43:03.180
 We know they increase dopamine, but what are they really?

43:03.180 --> 43:07.640
 Well, Ritalin also called methylphenidate

43:07.640 --> 43:11.280
 is very similar to amphetamine, speed

43:11.280 --> 43:13.040
 or what's typically called speed

43:13.040 --> 43:16.360
 in the street drug nomenclature.

43:16.360 --> 43:20.920
 Adderall, which goes by various other names, okay?

43:20.920 --> 43:25.920
 So Adderall, Adderall XR, Midacis, things like that.

43:28.080 --> 43:31.000
 Adderall is basically a combination of amphetamine

43:31.000 --> 43:33.260
 and dextro amphetamine.

43:33.260 --> 43:35.240
 Now, some of you probably realize this

43:35.240 --> 43:37.000
 that Adderall is amphetamine,

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
 but I'm guessing that there are a good number

43:39.000 --> 43:41.240
 of you out there, perhaps even parents and kids

43:41.240 --> 43:44.060
 that don't realize that these drugs like cocaine

43:44.060 --> 43:45.720
 and amphetamine, methamphetamine,

43:45.720 --> 43:48.600
 which are incredibly dangerous

43:48.600 --> 43:51.320
 and incredibly habit forming

43:51.320 --> 43:53.600
 and have high potential for abuse.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.200
 Well, the pharmaceutical versions of those

43:56.200 --> 43:59.640
 are exactly what are used to treat ADHD.

43:59.640 --> 44:01.920
 Now, they're not exactly like cocaine or methamphetamine,

44:01.920 --> 44:05.080
 but they are structurally and chemically very similar

44:05.080 --> 44:07.880
 and their net effect in the brain and body

44:07.880 --> 44:08.880
 is essentially the same,

44:08.880 --> 44:11.660
 which is to increase dopamine primarily,

44:11.660 --> 44:14.120
 but also to increase levels of a neuromodulator

44:14.120 --> 44:16.400
 called epinephrine or norepinephrine,

44:16.400 --> 44:18.240
 also called noradrenaline and adrenaline.

44:18.240 --> 44:19.560
 Those names are the same.

44:19.560 --> 44:22.680
 And to some extent, to increase levels of serotonin

44:22.680 --> 44:25.760
 in the brain and blood, but not so much serotonin,

44:25.760 --> 44:28.400
 that's just kind of a small smidgen of effect, okay?

44:28.400 --> 44:32.800
 So dopamine way up, norepinephrine and adrenaline way up.

44:32.800 --> 44:36.800
 So that's motivation, drive, focus, and energy.

44:36.800 --> 44:40.000
 And to some extent, a little bit of serotonin,

44:40.000 --> 44:44.640
 which is really more about feeling calm and relaxed.

44:44.640 --> 44:46.240
 And you could imagine why

44:46.240 --> 44:48.440
 that would be a good balancing effect

44:48.440 --> 44:50.620
 for dopamine and norepinephrine.

44:51.960 --> 44:53.200
 So what I'm essentially saying

44:53.200 --> 44:56.920
 is that the drugs that are used to treat ADHD are stimulants

44:56.920 --> 44:59.440
 and they look very much like, in fact,

44:59.440 --> 45:01.760
 nearly identical to some of the so-called

45:01.760 --> 45:05.820
 street drug stimulants that we all hear are so terrible.

45:05.820 --> 45:08.120
 However, I do want to emphasize

45:08.120 --> 45:10.140
 that at the appropriate dosages

45:10.140 --> 45:13.640
 and working with a quality psychiatrist

45:13.640 --> 45:16.160
 or neurologist or family physician,

45:16.160 --> 45:17.840
 it does have to be a board certified MD

45:17.840 --> 45:19.420
 that prescribes these things,

45:19.420 --> 45:23.820
 many people with ADHD achieve excellent relief

45:23.820 --> 45:26.280
 with these drugs, not all of them, but many of them do,

45:26.280 --> 45:30.180
 especially if these treatments are started early in life.

45:30.180 --> 45:31.960
 So now knowing what these drugs are,

45:31.960 --> 45:36.440
 I want to raise the question of why prescribe these drugs?

45:36.440 --> 45:38.520
 I mean, everyone has to make a decision for themselves

45:38.520 --> 45:39.760
 or for their child as to whether or not

45:39.760 --> 45:42.640
 they're going to take these things or not.

45:42.640 --> 45:46.360
 I also want to acknowledge that many people out there,

45:46.360 --> 45:49.800
 many, many people out there are taking these drugs

45:49.800 --> 45:52.220
 even though they have not been clinically diagnosed

45:52.220 --> 45:53.060
 with ADHD.

45:53.060 --> 45:53.980
 And when I say these drugs,

45:53.980 --> 45:56.240
 I'm specifically referring to Ritalin and Adderall

45:56.240 --> 46:00.080
 and Modafinil, but more typically it's Adderall, okay?

46:00.080 --> 46:01.960
 People using cocaine and amphetamine

46:01.960 --> 46:03.240
 for recreational purposes,

46:03.240 --> 46:05.320
 that's a completely different beast

46:05.320 --> 46:06.480
 and it is indeed a beast

46:06.480 --> 46:08.800
 and it's something that I strongly discourage.

46:08.800 --> 46:13.800
 However, I am aware that up to 25% of college students

46:15.520 --> 46:19.360
 and perhaps as many as 35% of all individuals

46:19.360 --> 46:24.360
 between the ages of 17 and 30 are taking Adderall

46:25.040 --> 46:28.780
 on a regular or semi-regular basis in order to work,

46:28.780 --> 46:32.200
 in order to study and in order to function

46:32.200 --> 46:33.680
 and focus in their daily life,

46:33.680 --> 46:37.020
 even though they have not been diagnosed with ADHD.

46:37.020 --> 46:38.300
 There's a whole black market for this,

46:38.300 --> 46:40.640
 they're getting it from people with prescriptions.

46:40.640 --> 46:41.840
 I'm not here to pass judgment,

46:41.840 --> 46:44.680
 I just want to emphasize how these drugs work,

46:44.680 --> 46:48.160
 some of the things that they do to enhance cognition

46:48.160 --> 46:49.960
 and focus that actually serve the brain well

46:49.960 --> 46:51.220
 in certain individuals

46:51.220 --> 46:55.800
 and how they can be very detrimental in other individuals.

46:55.800 --> 46:57.140
 I sort of blew right past it,

46:57.140 --> 47:01.720
 but the fact that in upwards of 25% of young people

47:01.720 --> 47:03.760
 are taking things like Adderall,

47:03.760 --> 47:08.360
 despite not having a clinical diagnosis of ADHD,

47:08.360 --> 47:10.780
 well, that's a ridiculously high number.

47:11.660 --> 47:12.560
 A few years ago,

47:12.560 --> 47:15.960
 it was estimated that Adderall use and Ritalin use

47:15.960 --> 47:18.200
 without diagnosis of ADHD

47:18.200 --> 47:21.560
 was second in incident only to cannabis,

47:21.560 --> 47:25.360
 but actually now the consumption of Adderall

47:25.360 --> 47:29.920
 without prescription is higher than the consumption

47:29.920 --> 47:31.760
 of cannabis in that age group.

47:31.760 --> 47:35.100
 So what that means is that there's a lot of stimulant use

47:35.100 --> 47:36.240
 in that age group.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.040
 And there are a lot of adults also

47:39.040 --> 47:42.140
 using and abusing stimulants in order to gain focus.

47:42.140 --> 47:43.200
 Then we could have a whole discussion

47:43.200 --> 47:45.640
 about whether or not life is becoming more demanding,

47:45.640 --> 47:48.160
 whether or not the need for focus is excessive

47:48.160 --> 47:50.040
 and that's why people are doing that.

47:50.040 --> 47:51.600
 Frankly, it's an interesting discussion,

47:51.600 --> 47:54.120
 but it's not one that would deliver us to any answers.

47:54.120 --> 47:57.340
 Rather, I'd like to focus on the ways that people now

47:57.340 --> 47:59.560
 and people have always been self-medicating

47:59.560 --> 48:02.020
 to increase focus, right?

48:02.020 --> 48:07.020
 Caffeine, which I indulge some, I don't think to access,

48:07.240 --> 48:10.380
 has long been used as a stimulant to increase dopamine,

48:10.380 --> 48:13.080
 increase norepinephrine, increase focus and energy.

48:13.080 --> 48:15.200
 And in addition to that,

48:15.200 --> 48:17.360
 it works through the so-called cyclic AMP,

48:17.360 --> 48:19.160
 phosphodiesterase pathway.

48:19.160 --> 48:22.240
 Remember, anytime you hear an ASE, that's an enzyme.

48:22.240 --> 48:25.300
 Phosphodiesterase is involved in the conversion

48:25.300 --> 48:28.800
 of things like cyclic AMP into energy for cells and so forth.

48:28.800 --> 48:31.200
 Basically, coffee gives you energy, it makes you feel good.

48:31.200 --> 48:34.120
 And it increases focus because of the circuits

48:34.120 --> 48:35.660
 that it engages in the brain.

48:37.400 --> 48:38.640
 People have been taking caffeine

48:38.640 --> 48:42.560
 and continue to take caffeine for ages.

48:42.560 --> 48:46.000
 People also used to smoke cigarettes, nicotine,

48:46.000 --> 48:47.600
 in order to gain focus.

48:47.600 --> 48:50.760
 Nowadays, that's less common because of the concerns,

48:50.760 --> 48:54.260
 quite valid concerns about lung cancer from smoking,

48:54.260 --> 48:57.160
 but there's a lot of vaping out there.

48:57.160 --> 48:59.920
 There are a lot of people now consuming nicotine,

48:59.920 --> 49:02.480
 which is the active substance in cigarettes

49:02.480 --> 49:05.240
 and in most nicotine vapes,

49:05.240 --> 49:09.280
 that stimulates the brain to be more focused and more alert.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.560
 So the idea of taking stimulants,

49:11.560 --> 49:13.400
 of consuming things or smoking things

49:14.240 --> 49:17.160
 in order to increase alertness is not a new idea.

49:17.160 --> 49:18.960
 It's just that in ADHD,

49:20.080 --> 49:22.600
 it's surprising that these things would work, right?

49:22.600 --> 49:24.720
 I mean, if the problem is attention deficit

49:24.720 --> 49:26.560
 hyperactivity disorder,

49:26.560 --> 49:28.280
 what we're really talking about here

49:28.280 --> 49:31.860
 or children that are prescribed a drug

49:31.860 --> 49:33.360
 that ought to be a stimulant,

49:33.360 --> 49:35.520
 it ought to make them hyper hyperactive.

49:35.520 --> 49:36.920
 And rather than doing that,

49:36.920 --> 49:40.400
 it actually somehow serves to calm them a bit

49:40.400 --> 49:42.640
 or at least allow them to focus.

49:42.640 --> 49:43.780
 Here's the reason.

49:44.880 --> 49:47.060
 Children have a brain that's very plastic,

49:47.060 --> 49:50.640
 meaning it can remodel itself and change in response

49:50.640 --> 49:54.440
 to experience very, very quickly compared to adults.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.920
 Taking stimulants as a child,

49:56.920 --> 50:00.080
 if you are a child diagnosed with ADHD,

50:00.080 --> 50:03.480
 allows that forebrain task-related network

50:03.480 --> 50:07.400
 to come online, to be active at the appropriate times.

50:07.400 --> 50:09.680
 And because those children are young,

50:09.680 --> 50:12.680
 it allows those children to learn what focus is

50:12.680 --> 50:16.840
 and to sort of follow or enter that tunnel of focus.

50:16.840 --> 50:20.320
 Now, by taking a drug, it's creating focus artificially.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.940
 It's not creating focus

50:21.940 --> 50:24.040
 because they're super interested in something.

50:24.040 --> 50:27.200
 It's chemically inducing a state of focus.

50:27.200 --> 50:30.180
 And let's face it, a lot of childhood and school

50:30.180 --> 50:31.520
 and becoming a functional adult

50:31.520 --> 50:32.660
 is about learning how to focus

50:32.660 --> 50:34.060
 even though you don't want to do something.

50:34.060 --> 50:35.120
 In fact, when I was in college,

50:35.120 --> 50:37.180
 I had this little trick that may or may not work

50:37.180 --> 50:40.240
 for some of you, which is if I couldn't focus

50:40.240 --> 50:42.320
 on the material I was trying to learn,

50:42.320 --> 50:44.480
 I would delude myself into thinking

50:44.480 --> 50:46.420
 that it was the most interesting thing in the world.

50:46.420 --> 50:48.480
 I would just kind of lie to myself and tell myself,

50:48.480 --> 50:50.860
 okay, this, I won't mention the subjects.

50:52.800 --> 50:53.960
 I absolutely love this.

50:53.960 --> 50:56.240
 I would just, I would tell myself that I loved it.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.940
 And I noticed that just that selective

50:58.940 --> 51:03.040
 or deliberate engagement of that desire to know circuit,

51:03.040 --> 51:06.100
 whatever that is in my brain, no doubt involves dopamine,

51:06.100 --> 51:08.320
 allowed me to focus and remember the information.

51:08.320 --> 51:11.600
 And somewhat surprisingly, or perhaps not surprisingly,

51:11.600 --> 51:13.440
 I would often fall in love with the information.

51:13.440 --> 51:15.100
 I find that that was my favorite class.

51:15.100 --> 51:17.060
 It was what I wanted to learn the most.

51:17.060 --> 51:19.820
 So that's one way you can do it artificially,

51:19.820 --> 51:21.960
 but kids with ADHD, they can't do that, right?

51:21.960 --> 51:23.080
 They're told to sit still

51:23.080 --> 51:25.240
 and they end up getting up 11 times.

51:25.240 --> 51:28.440
 You know, they are told that they can't speak out in class

51:28.440 --> 51:31.640
 or that they have to remain in their seats for 10 minutes.

51:31.640 --> 51:33.760
 And they just, despite their best effort,

51:33.760 --> 51:35.040
 they simply cannot do it.

51:35.040 --> 51:37.140
 They're highly distractible.

51:37.140 --> 51:39.360
 So what are we to make of this whole picture

51:39.360 --> 51:42.680
 that we need more dopamine, but these kids with ADHD,

51:42.680 --> 51:45.200
 they're getting their dopamine by way of a drug,

51:45.200 --> 51:47.920
 which is for all the world, amphetamines, right?

51:47.920 --> 51:48.760
 It's speed.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.140
 That's really what it is.

51:50.140 --> 51:51.480
 What are the long-term consequences?

51:51.480 --> 51:53.960
 What are the short-term consequences?

51:53.960 --> 51:57.080
 And what should we make of people taking these drugs

51:57.080 --> 51:58.180
 without a clinical need?

51:58.180 --> 52:00.080
 What are the consequences there?

52:00.080 --> 52:02.340
 Well, in order to get to some of those answers,

52:02.340 --> 52:04.240
 I went to one of my colleagues.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.680
 This is a colleague that I've actually known

52:05.680 --> 52:07.020
 for a very long time.

52:07.020 --> 52:08.260
 I was their teaching assistant

52:08.260 --> 52:10.100
 when they were an undergraduate.

52:10.100 --> 52:12.920
 They went on to get an MD, a medical degree,

52:12.920 --> 52:17.920
 as well as a PhD and have become a pediatric neurologist

52:18.160 --> 52:21.000
 that specializes in the treatment of epilepsy

52:21.000 --> 52:25.680
 and ADHD in kids of all ages, from age three to 21.

52:25.680 --> 52:27.580
 That's the age range, pretty broad age range,

52:27.580 --> 52:30.160
 and has extensive knowledge in this.

52:30.160 --> 52:33.300
 And what makes them particularly interesting

52:33.300 --> 52:36.960
 for sake of this discussion is that they have a child,

52:36.960 --> 52:40.780
 a young boy, who's now showing signs of ADHD,

52:40.780 --> 52:43.920
 and they are on the threshold of trying to decide

52:43.920 --> 52:47.200
 whether or not they will prescribe Adderall

52:47.200 --> 52:49.200
 or something similar.

52:49.200 --> 52:51.280
 So we had a discussion about this.

52:51.280 --> 52:56.180
 And prior to learning that their child may have ADHD,

52:56.180 --> 52:57.760
 I asked the following questions.

52:57.760 --> 52:58.880
 First of all, I asked,

52:58.880 --> 53:02.200
 what do you think about giving young kids amphetamine?

53:02.200 --> 53:06.420
 And their answer was, you know, on the face of it,

53:06.420 --> 53:07.980
 it seems crazy,

53:07.980 --> 53:12.040
 but provided that the lowest possible dose is used

53:12.040 --> 53:15.760
 and that that dosage is modulated as they grow older

53:15.760 --> 53:17.920
 and develop those powers of attention,

53:17.920 --> 53:22.680
 their observation was that they've seen more kids benefit

53:22.680 --> 53:25.500
 than not benefit from that.

53:25.500 --> 53:27.700
 Now, I'm certainly not saying what people should do.

53:27.700 --> 53:29.120
 You obviously have to go to a doctor,

53:29.120 --> 53:31.340
 because as I always say, I'm not a doctor.

53:31.340 --> 53:32.300
 I don't prescribe anything.

53:32.300 --> 53:33.960
 I'm a professor, so I profess things.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.920
 And here I'm professing that you talk to your doctor

53:35.920 --> 53:39.120
 if you're considering giving Ritalin or Adderall

53:39.120 --> 53:41.440
 or any type of stimulant to your child, of course.

53:41.440 --> 53:44.000
 What could be more important than the health of your child?

53:44.000 --> 53:45.440
 But it was a very interesting answer

53:45.440 --> 53:48.580
 because typically we hear, yes, medicate or don't medicate.

53:48.580 --> 53:51.560
 Rarely do we hear that the medication should be adjusted

53:51.560 --> 53:54.600
 across the lifespan and in any particular kind of way.

53:54.600 --> 53:56.360
 Now, the fact that this person,

53:56.360 --> 53:58.560
 this now friend of mine and colleague of mine

53:59.440 --> 54:02.780
 has so much expertise in the way that the brain works

54:02.780 --> 54:06.640
 and is considering putting their child on such medication,

54:06.640 --> 54:08.840
 I said, you know,

54:08.840 --> 54:11.480
 why wouldn't you wait until your kid reaches puberty?

54:11.480 --> 54:14.660
 I mean, we know that in boys and in girls,

54:14.660 --> 54:16.620
 there are increases in testosterone and estrogen

54:16.620 --> 54:19.840
 during puberty that dramatically change

54:19.840 --> 54:21.400
 the way that the body appears,

54:21.400 --> 54:23.180
 but also that dramatically changed the way

54:23.180 --> 54:24.160
 that the brain functions.

54:24.160 --> 54:26.660
 In particular, we know this,

54:26.660 --> 54:29.420
 that puberty triggers the activation

54:29.420 --> 54:32.960
 of so-called frontotemporal task-related

54:32.960 --> 54:34.000
 executive functioning.

54:34.000 --> 54:37.240
 That's just fancy science speak for being able to focus,

54:37.240 --> 54:38.560
 being able to direct your attention,

54:38.560 --> 54:40.240
 being able to control your impulses.

54:40.240 --> 54:42.440
 Look at a small child or look at a puppy

54:42.440 --> 54:44.280
 and then look at an older child

54:44.280 --> 54:46.480
 or look at a dog, very different levels,

54:46.480 --> 54:47.880
 patterns of spontaneous behavior.

54:47.880 --> 54:49.080
 Young children move around a lot.

54:49.080 --> 54:50.640
 They're, I don't want to say shifty

54:50.640 --> 54:51.480
 because that makes it sound like

54:51.480 --> 54:53.460
 they're up to something bad, which they might be,

54:53.460 --> 54:55.480
 but they don't have to be up to something bad.

54:55.480 --> 54:57.320
 They fidget a lot, so do puppies.

54:57.320 --> 54:58.480
 Everything's a stimulus.

54:58.480 --> 55:00.460
 As animals and humans get older,

55:00.460 --> 55:04.240
 they learn how to control their behavior and sit still,

55:04.240 --> 55:07.520
 listen and focus, even if they don't want to.

55:07.520 --> 55:11.120
 So giving a drug that allows a child

55:11.120 --> 55:14.760
 to access that stillness early on,

55:14.760 --> 55:16.920
 it's thought will allow them to maintain

55:16.920 --> 55:19.600
 that ability as time goes on.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.520
 But I decided to push a little bit further.

55:21.520 --> 55:25.060
 I said, well, why would you do it now

55:25.060 --> 55:28.400
 as opposed to during puberty or after puberty?

55:28.400 --> 55:30.540
 And their answer was very specific

55:30.540 --> 55:31.480
 and I think very important.

55:31.480 --> 55:33.480
 What they said was, look,

55:33.480 --> 55:37.180
 neuroplasticity is greatest in childhood

55:37.180 --> 55:40.320
 and tapers off after about age 25,

55:40.320 --> 55:43.000
 but neuroplasticity from age three

55:43.000 --> 55:48.000
 until age 12 or 13 is exceedingly high.

55:48.040 --> 55:49.000
 And they're right.

55:49.000 --> 55:50.240
 When you sit back and you look

55:50.240 --> 55:52.040
 at the literature on neuroplasticity,

55:52.040 --> 55:54.640
 you'd say childhood plasticity and young adult plasticity

55:54.640 --> 55:56.960
 is much greater than adult plasticity,

55:56.960 --> 56:00.280
 but that early childhood plasticity is far and away

56:00.280 --> 56:03.420
 the period in which you can reshape the brain

56:03.420 --> 56:05.380
 at an accelerated rate.

56:05.380 --> 56:08.820
 So this lines up really well with the clinical literature.

56:08.820 --> 56:10.720
 Not surprisingly, they're a clinician.

56:10.720 --> 56:13.480
 That early treatment is key.

56:13.480 --> 56:16.520
 If you have the opportunity to work with a quality physician

56:16.520 --> 56:18.400
 and treat these things early,

56:18.400 --> 56:21.120
 these drugs can allow these frontal circuits,

56:21.120 --> 56:23.040
 these task-related circuits,

56:23.040 --> 56:26.040
 to achieve their appropriate levels of functioning

56:26.040 --> 56:27.800
 and for kids to learn how to focus

56:27.800 --> 56:30.380
 in a variety of different contexts.

56:30.380 --> 56:33.320
 Now, is that the only thing that they should be doing?

56:33.320 --> 56:34.320
 Of course not.

56:34.320 --> 56:36.640
 So the next question I asked was,

56:36.640 --> 56:40.040
 what should we make of all this diet-related stuff, right?

56:40.040 --> 56:44.260
 I've heard before that the so-called elimination diet

56:44.260 --> 56:48.840
 or ingesting no sugars or no dairy or no gluten,

56:48.840 --> 56:50.960
 that all of these things have been purported

56:50.960 --> 56:53.440
 to improve symptoms of ADHD.

56:53.440 --> 56:57.540
 And people and parents with ADHD go to fanatic lengths

56:57.540 --> 57:01.320
 to try and find the exact foods that are causing problems

57:01.320 --> 57:04.840
 and the exact foods that the kids can eat

57:04.840 --> 57:07.280
 in order to try and get their brain wired up right

57:07.280 --> 57:11.960
 and correctly and to avoid lifelong ADHD.

57:11.960 --> 57:14.080
 And their answer was really interesting.

57:14.080 --> 57:16.040
 But before I tell you their answer,

57:16.040 --> 57:18.440
 I want to tell you the studies and the data

57:18.440 --> 57:21.720
 related to this question of whether or not food

57:21.720 --> 57:25.880
 and the constellation of foods that one avoids and will eat

57:25.880 --> 57:28.120
 has anything to do with our levels of attention,

57:28.120 --> 57:30.140
 and in particular, whether or not that can be used

57:30.140 --> 57:33.440
 as a leverage point to treat ADHD.

57:33.440 --> 57:36.280
 So you can imagine the challenges of exploring the role

57:36.280 --> 57:39.120
 of diet and nutrition in any study,

57:39.120 --> 57:41.220
 but especially in a study on ADHD.

57:41.220 --> 57:42.060
 Why?

57:42.060 --> 57:43.600
 Well, because as I mentioned before,

57:43.600 --> 57:46.760
 children with ADHD and it turns out adults with ADHD

57:46.760 --> 57:49.660
 tend to pursue sugary foods or any types of food

57:49.660 --> 57:51.520
 that increase their levels of dopamine.

57:51.520 --> 57:53.040
 They are naturally drawn to those foods,

57:53.040 --> 57:55.260
 whether or not they realize it or not,

57:55.260 --> 57:57.120
 presumably as a way to try and treat

57:57.120 --> 57:59.960
 their lack of focus and impulsivity.

57:59.960 --> 58:03.320
 So in this study that I'm about to share with you,

58:03.320 --> 58:04.740
 there was no drug treatment.

58:04.740 --> 58:07.760
 It was just a study manipulating diet

58:07.760 --> 58:09.240
 and involved a hundred children,

58:09.240 --> 58:12.400
 50 in the so-called elimination diet group,

58:12.400 --> 58:14.620
 the special diet where certain foods were eliminated

58:14.620 --> 58:16.640
 and 50 in the so-called control group.

58:16.640 --> 58:21.400
 However, being a well-designed randomized controlled trial,

58:21.400 --> 58:23.760
 the study also included a crossover,

58:23.760 --> 58:27.480
 meaning where the kids would serve as their own control

58:27.480 --> 58:30.040
 or control group at a certain portion of the studies.

58:30.040 --> 58:30.860
 They would be in one group

58:30.860 --> 58:32.120
 where they eliminated certain foods.

58:32.120 --> 58:33.840
 And then after a period of time in the study,

58:33.840 --> 58:35.240
 they would swap to the other group.

58:35.240 --> 58:37.160
 This is a powerful way to design a study

58:37.160 --> 58:38.440
 for reasons that you can imagine

58:38.440 --> 58:41.720
 because you start to eliminate changes and effects

58:41.720 --> 58:43.480
 due to individual differences.

58:43.480 --> 58:45.700
 In any case, a hundred children total,

58:45.700 --> 58:48.160
 50 in each group at any one period in time.

58:48.160 --> 58:52.260
 And the effects that they observed were extremely dramatic.

58:52.260 --> 58:55.000
 In the world of statistics and analysis of scientific data,

58:55.000 --> 58:57.160
 we talk about P values, probability values.

58:57.160 --> 58:59.200
 What's the likelihood that something could happen

58:59.200 --> 59:00.060
 according to chance?

59:00.060 --> 59:01.720
 And typically the cutoff would be

59:01.720 --> 59:04.320
 something like P less than 0.05.

59:04.320 --> 59:08.700
 That's less than 0.05 chance essentially

59:08.700 --> 59:11.780
 of the effect being due to chance.

59:11.780 --> 59:13.040
 However, in this study,

59:13.040 --> 59:17.480
 every single one of the effects is P less than 0.0001.

59:17.480 --> 59:20.680
 Very, very infinitesimally small probability

59:20.680 --> 59:23.320
 that the effect observed could be due to chance.

59:23.320 --> 59:24.240
 So what were these effects?

59:24.240 --> 59:26.960
 These effects were enhanced ability to focus,

59:26.960 --> 59:30.620
 less impulsivity, even less tendency to move

59:30.620 --> 59:32.760
 when trying to sit still.

59:32.760 --> 59:34.240
 So everything from mental focus

59:34.240 --> 59:36.400
 to the ability to control their bodies improved

59:36.400 --> 59:38.680
 when they were in the elimination diet group.

59:38.680 --> 59:39.640
 What was eliminated?

59:39.640 --> 59:44.100
 Well, the elimination diet in this particular study

59:44.100 --> 59:47.520
 was a so-called oligoantigenic diet.

59:47.520 --> 59:50.240
 It was a diet in which each kid took a test

59:50.240 --> 59:53.900
 to determine which foods they had antibodies for,

59:53.900 --> 59:56.800
 meaning that they were mildly allergic to.

59:56.800 --> 59:58.280
 Now, in this study, it was very important

59:58.280 --> 1:00:00.600
 that the kids not be extremely allergic to any food

1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:01.900
 because as I mentioned before,

1:00:01.900 --> 1:00:05.320
 they actually served as a control at one point in the study

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:06.920
 where they were eating all sorts of foods,

1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:08.840
 including foods that they had mild allergies to.

1:00:08.840 --> 1:00:11.700
 So basically what this study said

1:00:11.700 --> 1:00:16.320
 was that eliminating foods to which children have allergies

1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:19.720
 can dramatically improve their symptoms of ADHD.

1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:22.040
 And this study, not surprisingly,

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:24.280
 because it was published in such a high quality journal,

1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:26.700
 Lancet, et cetera, large number of subjects,

1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:28.800
 set the world on fire.

1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:32.060
 People were extremely excited about these results

1:00:32.060 --> 1:00:34.760
 because here in the absence of any drug treatment,

1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:36.240
 there was a significant improvement

1:00:36.240 --> 1:00:38.040
 in ADHD symptoms observed.

1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:40.860
 And then came the criticisms.

1:00:40.860 --> 1:00:44.600
 So many papers were published after this,

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:48.000
 specifically dealing with reanalysis of these data.

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:51.160
 And I want to be fair in saying that

1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:53.360
 the data in the paper look good,

1:00:53.360 --> 1:00:55.920
 but there are criticisms of the overall

1:00:55.920 --> 1:00:57.680
 structural design in the study.

1:00:57.680 --> 1:00:59.440
 I don't want to go into all the details exactly

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:02.420
 because it gets really nuanced about some of the statistics

1:01:02.420 --> 1:01:05.700
 and the way that one examines these types of data,

1:01:05.700 --> 1:01:07.580
 but there was skepticism.

1:01:07.580 --> 1:01:09.400
 And in science, skepticism is healthy,

1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:11.120
 especially when making decisions about

1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:14.320
 whether or not to treat or feed children one food or another

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:15.960
 or give them one drug or another.

1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:19.560
 Now I want to return to the story of my friend

1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:23.200
 who is a pediatric neurologist and treats ADHD

1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:25.600
 and has a child who is on the precipice

1:01:25.600 --> 1:01:27.920
 of perhaps starting to take drugs

1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:29.400
 for the treatment of ADHD.

1:01:29.400 --> 1:01:31.020
 I asked the simple question,

1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:33.760
 do you see an effect of diet?

1:01:33.760 --> 1:01:37.680
 Meaning when parents control the diet of their children,

1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:41.080
 does it make a positive or negative or no difference

1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:44.760
 in terms of the way that the kids respond to ADHD drugs

1:01:44.760 --> 1:01:46.540
 like Ritalin and Adderall,

1:01:46.540 --> 1:01:48.320
 or whether or not it can help them avoid

1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:49.960
 treating with those drugs entirely?

1:01:49.960 --> 1:01:52.140
 And her response was very straightforward.

1:01:52.140 --> 1:01:54.900
 She said, elimination of simple sugars

1:01:54.900 --> 1:01:56.940
 has a dramatic and positive effect.

1:01:56.940 --> 1:01:59.320
 She's observed that over and over and over again

1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:03.320
 in many dozens, if not hundreds of patients, okay?

1:02:03.320 --> 1:02:04.820
 Now that's not a peer reviewed study.

1:02:04.820 --> 1:02:07.120
 That's a statement that I'm conveying to you anecdotally,

1:02:07.120 --> 1:02:09.120
 but it's a highly, highly informed one.

1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:12.760
 I said, what about these elimination diets?

1:02:12.760 --> 1:02:15.520
 She said, and I found other sources to support this,

1:02:15.520 --> 1:02:18.500
 that these oligo-antigenic diets are controversial.

1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:21.080
 There are many people who really believe

1:02:21.080 --> 1:02:23.700
 in identifying all the things that you're allergic to

1:02:23.700 --> 1:02:26.340
 and making sure that you and especially your kids

1:02:26.340 --> 1:02:27.520
 avoid those foods.

1:02:27.520 --> 1:02:30.600
 However, there's another camp that's starting to emerge

1:02:30.600 --> 1:02:33.640
 in the peer reviewed scientific literature

1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:37.560
 showing that when kids are not exposed to certain foods,

1:02:37.560 --> 1:02:40.120
 in particular nuts and things of that sort,

1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:42.680
 they develop allergies to those foods.

1:02:42.680 --> 1:02:44.240
 And then when exposed to them later,

1:02:44.240 --> 1:02:45.360
 they cause real problems.

1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:48.920
 So there's a whole galaxy of discussion and controversy

1:02:48.920 --> 1:02:51.560
 and outright fighting about allergies in kids

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:54.080
 and whether or not the oligo-antigenic diet is the one.

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:58.400
 However, out of the four neurologists and psychiatrists

1:02:58.400 --> 1:03:01.620
 that I spoke to about ADHD in preparation for this,

1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:03.440
 every single one said,

1:03:03.440 --> 1:03:05.720
 children with ADHD as much as possible

1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:08.940
 should be encouraged to avoid high sugar

1:03:08.940 --> 1:03:11.320
 and simple sugar foods of most kinds.

1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:14.680
 And if they can find particular foods

1:03:14.680 --> 1:03:16.360
 that exacerbate their symptoms,

1:03:16.360 --> 1:03:20.360
 obviously eliminating those foods is beneficial.

1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.560
 And the foods that exacerbate their symptoms

1:03:23.560 --> 1:03:25.800
 change over time.

1:03:25.800 --> 1:03:28.720
 So I don't like giving a complicated answer,

1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:31.320
 but I also don't like giving an incomplete answer.

1:03:31.320 --> 1:03:34.640
 What this tells me is that children,

1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:37.880
 and especially young children who have ADHD

1:03:37.880 --> 1:03:41.460
 should probably not eat much sugar,

1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:43.200
 in particular simple sugars.

1:03:43.200 --> 1:03:44.660
 In addition to that,

1:03:44.660 --> 1:03:47.720
 exploring whether or not they have existing allergies

1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:50.000
 to foods they already consume

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:52.180
 might be a good idea.

1:03:52.180 --> 1:03:53.840
 At least that's what this paper,

1:03:53.840 --> 1:03:56.560
 the Pelser et al. Lancet paper seems to speak to.

1:03:56.560 --> 1:03:59.880
 And I should mention that that paper was published in 2011.

1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:03.120
 Since then, there have been many dozens of studies

1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:04.120
 exploring the same thing,

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:06.480
 as well as meta-analyses of all those data.

1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:09.320
 And it does appear that diet can have

1:04:09.320 --> 1:04:13.200
 a highly significant role in eliminating

1:04:13.200 --> 1:04:15.320
 or at least reducing the symptoms of ADHD.

1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:17.720
 So much so that some of the children

1:04:17.720 --> 1:04:19.720
 are able to not take medication at all

1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:22.960
 or eventually wean themselves off medication

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:25.680
 as young adults and as adults.

1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:28.480
 One interesting question is whether or not adults

1:04:28.480 --> 1:04:29.760
 should modify their diet

1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:32.680
 in order to increase their levels of focus

1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:35.520
 if they're already having normal levels of focus,

1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:36.400
 but would like more,

1:04:36.400 --> 1:04:40.280
 or would like to reduce existing adult ADHD.

1:04:41.200 --> 1:04:44.740
 That's an interesting and even more controversial topic.

1:04:44.740 --> 1:04:46.520
 It brings us right into the realm

1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:48.600
 of what are called omega-3 fatty acids.

1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:50.120
 I've talked many times on this podcast

1:04:50.120 --> 1:04:53.220
 about the known benefits of omega-3 fatty acids,

1:04:53.220 --> 1:04:58.220
 in particular, getting one gram, 1,000 milligrams or more,

1:04:58.680 --> 1:05:00.880
 even as much as 2,000 milligrams each day

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:05.880
 of the so-called EPA component of omega-3 fatty acids,

1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:08.600
 known to have antidepressant effects,

1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:09.640
 mood elevating effects,

1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:13.080
 known to have important effects

1:05:13.080 --> 1:05:15.560
 protecting the cardiovascular system.

1:05:15.560 --> 1:05:17.080
 I think it's now clear

1:05:17.080 --> 1:05:18.840
 that the immune system also benefits

1:05:18.840 --> 1:05:20.720
 that omega-3 fatty acids

1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:25.520
 that include a gram or more of EPAs are very beneficial.

1:05:25.520 --> 1:05:27.080
 Typically, that's done through fish oil.

1:05:27.080 --> 1:05:29.080
 Liquid fish oil is going to be the most cost efficient,

1:05:29.080 --> 1:05:30.440
 but there are capsule forms.

1:05:30.440 --> 1:05:33.040
 For those of you that don't like fish oil,

1:05:33.040 --> 1:05:34.280
 you can ingest this through other means.

1:05:34.280 --> 1:05:36.920
 You can get it from certain algaes or krill, et cetera.

1:05:36.920 --> 1:05:40.680
 You have to make it compatible with your particular diet,

1:05:40.680 --> 1:05:42.000
 whether or not you're vegan or vegetarian

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:43.220
 or omnivore, et cetera.

1:05:44.460 --> 1:05:46.000
 Omega-3s have been shown

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.480
 to have all these positive health benefits.

1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:52.260
 Do they have positive effects on focus and attention?

1:05:52.260 --> 1:05:53.680
 And the answer is,

1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:57.320
 you can find studies that support that statement,

1:05:57.320 --> 1:05:59.360
 and the effects are significant,

1:05:59.360 --> 1:06:01.300
 but the effects are modest.

1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:06.340
 You can also find studies that show no effect.

1:06:06.340 --> 1:06:10.600
 However, much like with omega-3s and antidepressants,

1:06:10.600 --> 1:06:15.600
 whereby ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids

1:06:16.360 --> 1:06:18.320
 of a gram or more of EPA per day

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.120
 allows people with major depression

1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:21.920
 to get away with taking lower doses

1:06:21.920 --> 1:06:23.760
 of antidepressant medication,

1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:27.740
 it does seem that ingestion of omega-3 fatty acids

1:06:27.740 --> 1:06:32.740
 in adults that include EPAs of 1,000 milligrams or more

1:06:33.880 --> 1:06:36.040
 can allow adults with ADHD

1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:38.560
 or mild attention deficit issues

1:06:38.560 --> 1:06:43.560
 to function well on lower doses of medication,

1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:47.340
 and in rare cases to eliminate medication entirely.

1:06:47.340 --> 1:06:49.360
 So what this says is once again

1:06:49.360 --> 1:06:51.600
 that the omega-3 fatty acids are beneficial.

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:54.760
 Will they cure or eliminate ADHD?

1:06:54.760 --> 1:06:57.040
 I think it's safe to say no.

1:06:57.040 --> 1:06:58.380
 They are playing a supportive

1:06:58.380 --> 1:07:00.680
 or what we call a modulatory role.

1:07:00.680 --> 1:07:04.320
 Just like good sleep plays a supportive and modulatory role

1:07:04.320 --> 1:07:05.500
 for essentially everything,

1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:07.100
 your immune system, your ability to think,

1:07:07.100 --> 1:07:08.460
 your ability to regulate your emotion,

1:07:08.460 --> 1:07:10.800
 it's modulating that process.

1:07:10.800 --> 1:07:12.960
 This component of modulation

1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:14.840
 is extremely important to highlight.

1:07:14.840 --> 1:07:16.880
 And I think I want to spend a moment on it

1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:19.080
 because this is especially important

1:07:19.080 --> 1:07:20.480
 in the context of ADHD

1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:22.880
 and all the information that's out there.

1:07:22.880 --> 1:07:26.160
 There are biological processes that are mediated

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:28.920
 by particular compounds like dopamine.

1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:31.480
 So for instance, the ability to feel motivated

1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:33.160
 to attend, to focus,

1:07:33.160 --> 1:07:35.860
 is mediated by the circuits in the brain

1:07:35.860 --> 1:07:38.400
 that release dopamine.

1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:42.680
 However, attention is also modulated by how rested you are.

1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:45.760
 If you want to eliminate your ability to think well at all,

1:07:45.760 --> 1:07:48.640
 just stay up for two nights and don't sleep at all, right?

1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:51.760
 If you do that, you will have modulated the circuits

1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:55.280
 in your brain that respond to various things

1:07:55.280 --> 1:07:56.960
 and you will be highly distractible.

1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:58.120
 You will be highly emotional.

1:07:58.120 --> 1:07:59.600
 You will feel like garbage,

1:07:59.600 --> 1:08:02.720
 but that doesn't mean that sleep mediates focus

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:05.820
 and attention, it modulates it indirectly.

1:08:05.820 --> 1:08:08.540
 Likewise, I think these omega-3 fatty acids,

1:08:09.420 --> 1:08:10.600
 in particular the EPAs,

1:08:10.600 --> 1:08:12.320
 which are so beneficial for mood

1:08:12.320 --> 1:08:14.680
 and apparently also for attention,

1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:18.440
 they don't directly mediate attention and mood.

1:08:18.440 --> 1:08:20.600
 What they do is they modulate those circuits.

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:23.120
 They make dopamine more available.

1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:25.200
 They make whatever dopamine is available

1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:28.480
 more likely to bind to the various receptors

1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:30.640
 that are present on neurons and so forth.

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:32.120
 And I think this is very important

1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:35.240
 because likewise diet and any discussion about nutrition

1:08:35.240 --> 1:08:38.440
 has to include this framework of is the diet,

1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:39.560
 the elimination diet,

1:08:39.560 --> 1:08:41.400
 or whether or not it's some other diet

1:08:41.400 --> 1:08:43.080
 or esoteric diet, ketogenic diet,

1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:46.120
 is it modulating or mediating a process?

1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:48.800
 And most likely in the context of ADHD,

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:50.960
 it's modulating that process.

1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:54.320
 So if the ADHD is mild or if it's caught early enough,

1:08:54.320 --> 1:08:57.680
 or if it's in conjunction with pharmacology

1:08:57.680 --> 1:08:59.280
 with a prescription treatment,

1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:01.860
 well, then it might help guide the child or adult

1:09:01.860 --> 1:09:03.940
 to a better place of being able to focus.

1:09:03.940 --> 1:09:07.120
 But it's not going to be the switch that flips everything.

1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:10.760
 Now, that does not mean that consuming the wrong foods,

1:09:10.760 --> 1:09:13.120
 sugary foods or foods that you happen to be allergic to

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:14.120
 is a good idea.

1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:16.040
 It will still be detrimental.

1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:18.000
 So I hope that conceptual framework helps

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.060
 because if you go online,

1:09:19.060 --> 1:09:21.080
 if you're somebody with ADHD or not,

1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:24.460
 you are going to be bombarded with the ADHD diet,

1:09:24.460 --> 1:09:26.920
 the oligoantigenic diet, the elimination,

1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:29.200
 this supplement, that EPA.

1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:31.560
 And I think it's very important to understand

1:09:31.560 --> 1:09:32.680
 whether or not you're talking about

1:09:32.680 --> 1:09:36.280
 something mediating a process or modulating a process.

1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:38.840
 Now, drugs like Ritalin, drugs like Adderall,

1:09:38.840 --> 1:09:41.000
 they are tapping into the circuitries

1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.320
 and the neurochemistries that mediate attention and focus.

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:47.400
 They are not the only alternatives

1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:50.360
 or the only choices rather for treatment of these circuits

1:09:50.360 --> 1:09:52.200
 and enhancement of the circuits for focus.

1:09:52.200 --> 1:09:53.920
 I'm going to talk about other alternatives

1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:55.960
 and some behavioral alternatives

1:09:55.960 --> 1:09:57.420
 that are not very well known,

1:09:57.420 --> 1:10:00.920
 but are very, very effective in a few minutes.

1:10:00.920 --> 1:10:03.460
 But I really want to make this clear distinction

1:10:03.460 --> 1:10:05.600
 between modulation and mediation

1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:09.120
 because it's vital for anyone that's trying to modulate

1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:11.600
 or mediate anything within their own brain.

1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:14.360
 If any of you are interested in this oligoantigenic diet

1:10:14.360 --> 1:10:16.080
 as it relates to ADHD,

1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:19.680
 and you want to explore a more recent study

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:22.740
 besides that classic 2011 Lancet study

1:10:22.740 --> 1:10:23.820
 that's rather controversial,

1:10:23.820 --> 1:10:25.200
 there's a paper that was published

1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:29.060
 in Frontiers in Psychiatry just last year, 2020.

1:10:29.060 --> 1:10:31.580
 The title of the paper is oligoantigenic diet

1:10:31.580 --> 1:10:35.780
 improves children's ADHD rating scale scores reliably

1:10:35.780 --> 1:10:37.740
 in added video rating.

1:10:37.740 --> 1:10:39.540
 The added video rating is just that they're using

1:10:39.540 --> 1:10:43.260
 an additional measure of focus and attention.

1:10:43.260 --> 1:10:46.180
 Again, that's Frontiers in Psychiatry 2020.

1:10:46.180 --> 1:10:48.260
 I'll put a link to it in the caption,

1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:51.080
 and that's a more recent study for you to peruse.

1:10:51.080 --> 1:10:53.100
 So we've talked about the neural circuits of focus

1:10:53.100 --> 1:10:55.200
 and the chemistry of focus,

1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:58.180
 but we haven't talked yet about

1:10:58.180 --> 1:11:00.180
 what would make us better at focusing

1:11:00.180 --> 1:11:01.980
 and what focusing better really is.

1:11:01.980 --> 1:11:06.080
 So let's take a step back and think about how we focus

1:11:06.080 --> 1:11:07.820
 and how to get better at focus.

1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:10.040
 And I'm going to share with you a tool

1:11:10.040 --> 1:11:13.300
 for which there are terrific research data

1:11:13.300 --> 1:11:15.680
 that will allow you in a single session

1:11:15.680 --> 1:11:20.080
 to enhance your ability to focus in theory forever.

1:11:22.020 --> 1:11:24.540
 What I'm about to read you is from an excellent book

1:11:24.540 --> 1:11:27.380
 that I recommend if any of you are interested in neuroscience

1:11:27.380 --> 1:11:30.500
 and things like meditation and default mode networks

1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:32.120
 and things of that sort.

1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:33.900
 The book is called Altered Traits.

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:37.480
 Science reveals how meditation changes

1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:39.220
 your mind, brain, and body.

1:11:39.220 --> 1:11:41.780
 And no, I'm not going to try and convince you to meditate.

1:11:41.780 --> 1:11:44.540
 I'm going to share with you a small passage in the book

1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:47.380
 that relates some research data related to focus

1:11:47.380 --> 1:11:48.700
 that are very important.

1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:50.600
 If you want to meditate, that's your choice.

1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:51.440
 That's a separate matter.

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:54.260
 This is a book by Daniel Goleman and Richard Davidson.

1:11:54.260 --> 1:11:57.660
 And I should just mention that Goleman is a well-known author

1:11:57.660 --> 1:12:00.820
 has written books on emotional intelligence and so forth.

1:12:00.820 --> 1:12:04.180
 Richard Davidson is also a PhD.

1:12:04.180 --> 1:12:06.500
 He's a professor of psychology and psychiatry,

1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:09.500
 and he's at a University of Wisconsin, Madison.

1:12:09.500 --> 1:12:12.280
 He's done terrific work on brain states

1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:14.540
 and modulation of brain states and so forth.

1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:19.460
 What we're about to talk about is when attention works

1:12:19.460 --> 1:12:21.940
 and when attention falters.

1:12:21.940 --> 1:12:24.060
 And what we are specifically going to talk about

1:12:24.060 --> 1:12:26.780
 are what are called attentional blinks,

1:12:26.780 --> 1:12:28.060
 not actual eye blinks.

1:12:28.060 --> 1:12:29.780
 We're going to talk about that in a few minutes,

1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:32.180
 but we're going to talk about attentional blinks.

1:12:33.420 --> 1:12:37.560
 I'm paraphrasing here because Goleman and Davidson

1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:39.180
 wrote about this so beautifully.

1:12:39.180 --> 1:12:40.540
 I'd rather paraphrase from them

1:12:40.540 --> 1:12:42.800
 than try and just make up a new way to say it

1:12:42.800 --> 1:12:44.940
 that is less interesting or less good,

1:12:44.940 --> 1:12:46.900
 but I want to credit them.

1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:48.840
 Attentional blinks are really easy to understand

1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:50.780
 if you think about a where's Waldo task.

1:12:50.780 --> 1:12:52.260
 You know this task, where's Waldo,

1:12:52.260 --> 1:12:54.380
 where there are a bunch of people

1:12:54.380 --> 1:12:56.140
 and objects and things in a picture,

1:12:56.140 --> 1:12:57.620
 and somewhere in there is Waldo

1:12:57.620 --> 1:12:59.420
 with the striped hat and the glasses

1:12:59.420 --> 1:13:00.660
 and kind of a skinny dude,

1:13:00.660 --> 1:13:02.340
 and you have to find Waldo.

1:13:02.340 --> 1:13:03.820
 And so it's a visual search,

1:13:03.820 --> 1:13:06.220
 and it's visual search for an object

1:13:06.220 --> 1:13:07.300
 that has distinct features,

1:13:07.300 --> 1:13:10.660
 but is embedded in this ocean of other things

1:13:10.660 --> 1:13:12.700
 that could easily be confused as Waldo.

1:13:12.700 --> 1:13:14.860
 So you tend to look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.

1:13:14.860 --> 1:13:16.560
 And then you find Waldo.

1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:17.400
 Kids can do this.

1:13:17.400 --> 1:13:18.240
 They enjoy doing this.

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:21.120
 Adults may or may not enjoy it, but they can do it too.

1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:22.080
 They find Waldo.

1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:24.180
 When you find Waldo,

1:13:24.180 --> 1:13:26.140
 or when you search for a target

1:13:26.140 --> 1:13:28.140
 in some other visual search task,

1:13:28.140 --> 1:13:31.940
 at that moment, your nervous system celebrates a little bit,

1:13:31.940 --> 1:13:34.740
 and it celebrates through the release of neurochemicals

1:13:34.740 --> 1:13:35.580
 that make you feel good.

1:13:35.580 --> 1:13:38.260
 You found it, and you pause.

1:13:38.260 --> 1:13:40.260
 Now, the pause is interesting,

1:13:40.260 --> 1:13:41.780
 because when you pause,

1:13:41.780 --> 1:13:44.700
 what we know from many experiments

1:13:44.700 --> 1:13:48.760
 is that in that moment of pause and mild celebration,

1:13:48.760 --> 1:13:49.940
 however mild,

1:13:49.940 --> 1:13:54.300
 you are not able to see another Waldo

1:13:54.300 --> 1:13:56.140
 sitting right next to it.

1:13:56.140 --> 1:13:59.380
 So what this means is in attending to something,

1:13:59.380 --> 1:14:03.960
 in searching, and in identifying a visual target,

1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:05.480
 your attention blinked.

1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:07.180
 It shut off for a second.

1:14:07.180 --> 1:14:11.220
 And there's a more formal and more laboratory type way

1:14:11.220 --> 1:14:12.260
 that we look at this.

1:14:13.220 --> 1:14:14.980
 The more typical way to do this

1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:17.700
 is to give someone a string of letters

1:14:17.700 --> 1:14:19.500
 or a string of numbers.

1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:21.100
 And beforehand, you tell them,

1:14:22.020 --> 1:14:26.000
 be on the lookout for the letters R and Z.

1:14:27.340 --> 1:14:30.100
 You're just going to watch this string of numbers go by,

1:14:30.100 --> 1:14:31.880
 and there will be a letter R in there,

1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:33.800
 and there will be a letter Z in there,

1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:35.900
 and try and spot them both.

1:14:36.760 --> 1:14:37.900
 And what you find is

1:14:37.900 --> 1:14:40.340
 when you present that string of numbers,

1:14:40.340 --> 1:14:42.260
 and then they see the R,

1:14:42.260 --> 1:14:43.540
 they see the R,

1:14:43.540 --> 1:14:46.260
 they register it consciously,

1:14:46.260 --> 1:14:48.940
 and they tend to miss the Z,

1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:51.460
 just like in the Waldo type example.

1:14:51.460 --> 1:14:53.580
 Now, of course, the numbers are going by pretty quickly,

1:14:53.580 --> 1:14:55.140
 but they can spot the R.

1:14:56.220 --> 1:14:58.920
 They could also spot the Z if you told them beforehand,

1:14:58.920 --> 1:15:00.720
 just spot the Z.

1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:02.780
 And the numbers are moving through at the same rate

1:15:02.780 --> 1:15:03.620
 in both conditions.

1:15:03.620 --> 1:15:05.940
 So what that means is that in every case,

1:15:05.940 --> 1:15:10.260
 you are capable of seeing the R or the Z.

1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:12.180
 It's when you try and see both

1:15:12.180 --> 1:15:14.540
 that seeing the first one prevents you

1:15:14.540 --> 1:15:16.460
 from seeing the second one.

1:15:16.460 --> 1:15:19.180
 It's what we call an attentional blink.

1:15:19.180 --> 1:15:20.980
 We do this all the time,

1:15:20.980 --> 1:15:24.420
 and people with ADHD tend to have

1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:27.520
 many more attentional blinks than people that don't.

1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:29.780
 And this is true for children and for adults.

1:15:30.740 --> 1:15:32.060
 This is an important point,

1:15:32.060 --> 1:15:34.060
 so important that I want to emphasize it twice

1:15:34.060 --> 1:15:36.540
 in case you attentionally blinked.

1:15:36.540 --> 1:15:39.060
 If you see something that you're looking for,

1:15:39.060 --> 1:15:40.860
 or you're very interested in something,

1:15:40.860 --> 1:15:43.560
 you are definitely missing other information,

1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:48.000
 in part because you're over-focusing on something.

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:50.300
 And this leads to a very interesting hypothesis

1:15:50.300 --> 1:15:53.400
 about what might go wrong in ADHD,

1:15:53.400 --> 1:15:56.520
 where we've always thought that they cannot focus,

1:15:56.520 --> 1:15:58.320
 and yet we know they can focus on things

1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:00.420
 they care very much about.

1:16:00.420 --> 1:16:03.020
 Well, maybe, just maybe,

1:16:03.020 --> 1:16:06.140
 they are experiencing more attentional blinks

1:16:06.140 --> 1:16:09.000
 than people who do not have ADHD.

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:12.440
 And indeed, there are data now to support the possibility

1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:14.080
 that that's actually what's happening.

1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:16.880
 And that should be exciting to anyone that has ADHD.

1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:18.320
 It should also be exciting to anyone

1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:20.160
 that cares about increasing their focus

1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:22.100
 and their ability to attend.

1:16:22.100 --> 1:16:23.720
 What this is saying is that these circuits

1:16:23.720 --> 1:16:26.360
 that underlie focus and our ability to attend

1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:28.540
 and our ability to eliminate distraction,

1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.080
 they aren't just failing to focus.

1:16:32.080 --> 1:16:35.440
 That's just a semantic way of describing the outcome.

1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:37.600
 They are over-focusing on certain things

1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:39.580
 and thereby missing other things.

1:16:39.580 --> 1:16:42.600
 And so our distractibility or the distractibility

1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:45.560
 of somebody with ADHD could exist

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:49.400
 because they are over-focusing on certain elements

1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:51.880
 and they are therefore missing other elements

1:16:51.880 --> 1:16:53.900
 that they should be attending to.

1:16:53.900 --> 1:16:57.520
 So what they really need is this property

1:16:57.520 --> 1:16:59.040
 that we call open monitoring.

1:16:59.040 --> 1:17:00.680
 Now, open monitoring is something

1:17:00.680 --> 1:17:02.800
 that's described in the book that I just referred to

1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:05.880
 and that typically is associated with people

1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:07.540
 who have done a lot of meditation,

1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:10.860
 so-called vipassana meditation, or have spent a lot of time

1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:15.280
 learning how to do what's called open gaze visual analysis

1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:17.400
 and open gaze thinking, but there's a simpler version

1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:19.720
 of this that allows us to bypass all that.

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:20.560
 First of all,

1:17:22.900 --> 1:17:26.740
 your visual system has two modes of processing.

1:17:26.740 --> 1:17:28.880
 It can be highly focused, a soda straw view,

1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:31.340
 so looking for the R in this string of numbers

1:17:31.340 --> 1:17:33.000
 in the example that I just gave,

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.760
 or if you're very excited about something,

1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:36.440
 you're in that soda straw view of the world

1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:37.960
 and you're missing other things, okay?

1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:40.300
 That's high levels of attention.

1:17:40.300 --> 1:17:43.360
 However, there's also a property of your visual system

1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:45.040
 that allows you to dilate your gaze

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:47.300
 to be in so-called panoramic vision.

1:17:47.300 --> 1:17:49.360
 Panoramic vision is something you can do right now

1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:51.900
 no matter where you are, and I can do it right now.

1:17:51.900 --> 1:17:53.200
 You won't know that I'm doing it,

1:17:53.200 --> 1:17:56.400
 but even though I'm still looking directly at you,

1:17:56.400 --> 1:17:58.340
 I'm consciously dilating my gaze

1:17:58.340 --> 1:17:59.840
 so that I can see the ceiling, the floor,

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:01.140
 and the walls all around me.

1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:03.520
 That panoramic vision is actually mediated

1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:06.880
 by a separate stream or set of neural circuits

1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:08.480
 going from the eye into the brain,

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:10.920
 and it's a stream or set of circuits

1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:13.200
 that isn't just wide angle view.

1:18:13.200 --> 1:18:16.240
 It also is better at processing things in time.

1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:18.160
 Its frame rate is higher.

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:20.080
 So you've seen slow motion video

1:18:20.080 --> 1:18:21.760
 and you've seen standard video.

1:18:21.760 --> 1:18:26.620
 Slow motion video gives you that slow motion look

1:18:26.620 --> 1:18:28.040
 because it's a higher frame rate,

1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:30.880
 your thin slicing time, okay?

1:18:30.880 --> 1:18:34.380
 So you can use panoramic vision

1:18:34.380 --> 1:18:36.680
 to access the state that we call open monitoring.

1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:41.060
 When people do that, they are able to attend to

1:18:41.060 --> 1:18:44.260
 and recognize multiple targets

1:18:44.260 --> 1:18:46.100
 within this string of numbers.

1:18:46.100 --> 1:18:48.180
 They can see the R and they can see the Z

1:18:48.180 --> 1:18:50.140
 and they can see additional things.

1:18:50.140 --> 1:18:52.660
 So this is something that can be trained up

1:18:52.660 --> 1:18:53.980
 and people can practice whether or not

1:18:53.980 --> 1:18:56.140
 they have ADHD or not.

1:18:56.140 --> 1:18:57.560
 What it involves is learning

1:18:57.560 --> 1:18:58.980
 how to dilate your gaze consciously.

1:18:58.980 --> 1:19:01.420
 That's actually quite easy for most people.

1:19:01.420 --> 1:19:03.380
 Whether or not you wear corrective lenses

1:19:03.380 --> 1:19:04.380
 or contacts or not,

1:19:04.380 --> 1:19:06.260
 you can consciously go into open gaze

1:19:06.260 --> 1:19:09.640
 and then you can contract your field of view as well.

1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:11.340
 There have also been studies done

1:19:11.340 --> 1:19:15.940
 where people were taught to think in a particular way

1:19:15.940 --> 1:19:17.780
 for a very short period of time

1:19:17.780 --> 1:19:19.880
 and that forever changed their ability

1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:24.300
 to limit or reduce the number of these attentional blinks.

1:19:24.300 --> 1:19:26.020
 There are now published accounts in the literature

1:19:26.020 --> 1:19:29.820
 of a simple practice done for about 15 minutes

1:19:29.820 --> 1:19:32.220
 where subjects were asked to just sit quietly,

1:19:32.220 --> 1:19:35.060
 eyes closed and do what is sort of akin to meditation

1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:36.340
 but to not direct their mind

1:19:36.340 --> 1:19:38.340
 into any particular state or place

1:19:38.340 --> 1:19:40.380
 but simply to think about their breathing

1:19:40.380 --> 1:19:42.640
 and to focus on their so-called interoception,

1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:44.240
 focus on how their body feels,

1:19:44.240 --> 1:19:45.940
 their mind drifted to bring it back.

1:19:45.940 --> 1:19:50.220
 Okay, so it's basically meditation for about 15 minutes.

1:19:50.220 --> 1:19:53.620
 That might not seem like a significant or unusual practice

1:19:53.620 --> 1:19:55.900
 or that it would have any impact at all

1:19:55.900 --> 1:20:00.900
 but remarkably, just doing that once for 17 minutes

1:20:01.820 --> 1:20:05.140
 significantly reduced the number of attentional blinks

1:20:05.140 --> 1:20:06.580
 that people would carry out.

1:20:06.580 --> 1:20:08.540
 In other words, their focus got better

1:20:08.540 --> 1:20:12.360
 in a near permanent way without any additional training.

1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:13.980
 There's something about that practice

1:20:13.980 --> 1:20:17.140
 of reducing the amount of visual information coming in

1:20:17.140 --> 1:20:19.580
 and learning to pay attention to one's internal state,

1:20:19.580 --> 1:20:21.420
 what we call interoception,

1:20:21.420 --> 1:20:23.100
 that allowed them an awareness

1:20:23.100 --> 1:20:26.060
 such that when they needed to look for visual targets,

1:20:26.060 --> 1:20:29.000
 when they need to focus on multiple things in sequence,

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.340
 they didn't experience the same number

1:20:31.340 --> 1:20:32.500
 of attentional blinks.

1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:34.980
 And I should mention, not incidentally,

1:20:34.980 --> 1:20:38.180
 as people age and their working memory gets worse

1:20:38.180 --> 1:20:40.860
 and their ability to focus gets worse,

1:20:40.860 --> 1:20:42.420
 the number of attentional blinks

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:44.180
 that they carry out goes up.

1:20:44.180 --> 1:20:45.740
 And there are now studies exploring

1:20:45.740 --> 1:20:48.900
 whether or not this simple meditation-like practice

1:20:48.900 --> 1:20:51.620
 of 15 to 20 minutes or so of sitting

1:20:51.620 --> 1:20:53.980
 and just quietly resting and paying attention

1:20:53.980 --> 1:20:55.900
 to one's breathing and internal state

1:20:55.900 --> 1:20:58.700
 can also offset some of that age-related,

1:20:58.700 --> 1:21:01.380
 what is called cognitive decline.

1:21:01.380 --> 1:21:04.300
 So what these data tell me is that regardless

1:21:04.300 --> 1:21:07.100
 of whether or not you're a child or you're an adult,

1:21:07.100 --> 1:21:09.900
 whether or not you have ADHD or not,

1:21:09.900 --> 1:21:11.140
 whether or not you're experiencing

1:21:11.140 --> 1:21:12.700
 age-related cognitive decline,

1:21:12.700 --> 1:21:14.220
 or you would simply like to avoid

1:21:14.220 --> 1:21:15.860
 age-related cognitive decline,

1:21:16.860 --> 1:21:20.620
 a simple practice of taking 17 minutes,

1:21:20.620 --> 1:21:23.740
 sitting and paying attention to your internal state,

1:21:23.740 --> 1:21:26.980
 just interocepting, registering your breathing,

1:21:26.980 --> 1:21:29.140
 registering the contact of your skin

1:21:29.140 --> 1:21:31.220
 with whatever surface you're on,

1:21:31.220 --> 1:21:35.560
 can forever rewire your brain to be able to attend better

1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.380
 and possibly even offset

1:21:37.380 --> 1:21:40.140
 some of that age-related attentional drift.

1:21:41.420 --> 1:21:44.900
 Now, I don't expect anyone to start meditating regularly.

1:21:44.900 --> 1:21:47.500
 I don't expect anyone to do anything they don't want to do,

1:21:47.500 --> 1:21:51.460
 but I think most of us could handle one meditation session

1:21:51.460 --> 1:21:53.500
 of 17 minutes or so.

1:21:53.500 --> 1:21:55.420
 And so if ever there was a tool that stood

1:21:55.420 --> 1:21:59.020
 to rewire our attentional circuitry in a powerful way,

1:21:59.020 --> 1:22:00.700
 this seems to be it.

1:22:00.700 --> 1:22:05.540
 And in addition, the ability to engage in panoramic vision,

1:22:05.540 --> 1:22:08.820
 to dilate our gaze, the so-called open monitoring

1:22:08.820 --> 1:22:10.820
 that allows the brain to function in a way

1:22:10.820 --> 1:22:13.200
 that it can detect more information faster,

1:22:13.200 --> 1:22:14.660
 that's a powerful tool as well.

1:22:14.660 --> 1:22:17.160
 And the beauty of that tool is that it works the first time

1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:19.020
 and it works every time.

1:22:19.020 --> 1:22:23.740
 Now, how exactly it works is a little bit unclear.

1:22:23.740 --> 1:22:28.020
 Is it, for instance, orchestrating this synchrony

1:22:28.020 --> 1:22:30.580
 or asynchrony between the default mode network

1:22:30.580 --> 1:22:31.760
 and the task-related networks?

1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:32.700
 We don't know.

1:22:32.700 --> 1:22:35.340
 Those studies have not yet been carried out.

1:22:35.340 --> 1:22:37.620
 Nonetheless, the effects are significant,

1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:39.180
 they are long lasting,

1:22:39.180 --> 1:22:42.460
 and they appear to exist after just one session

1:22:42.460 --> 1:22:45.720
 of this quiet 17-minute interoception,

1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:47.860
 which to me makes it seem like a very worthwhile thing

1:22:47.860 --> 1:22:49.800
 to do for everybody.

1:22:49.800 --> 1:22:51.940
 So we just talked about attentional blinks,

1:22:51.940 --> 1:22:54.320
 which are essentially blinks of thinking.

1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:56.480
 It's your mind shutting off for a moment

1:22:56.480 --> 1:22:58.660
 and missing information.

1:22:58.660 --> 1:23:00.740
 Now let's talk about actual blinks,

1:23:00.740 --> 1:23:03.060
 the sort that you do with your eyelids.

1:23:03.060 --> 1:23:05.500
 Now, this might come across as somewhat obvious,

1:23:05.500 --> 1:23:10.000
 but you can do fast, what are called spontaneous blinks,

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.800
 and they are always coordinated between the two eyes.

1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:14.060
 Or you can do long blinks,

1:23:14.060 --> 1:23:15.540
 like when you go to sleep at night,

1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:19.460
 you do one very long blink and I'm not being facetious.

1:23:19.460 --> 1:23:20.460
 When you go to sleep at night,

1:23:20.460 --> 1:23:23.740
 you are shutting your eyelids

1:23:23.740 --> 1:23:27.480
 and you are limiting the amount of information coming in

1:23:27.480 --> 1:23:30.460
 and your perception of time starts to drift

1:23:30.460 --> 1:23:31.660
 as you go into sleep.

1:23:31.660 --> 1:23:35.820
 Your perception of time changes from very fast

1:23:35.820 --> 1:23:38.000
 at one moment to very slow,

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.140
 meaning the frame rate

1:23:40.140 --> 1:23:43.100
 at which you are analyzing information,

1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:46.740
 dreaming, et cetera, is variable when you are in sleep.

1:23:46.740 --> 1:23:48.200
 Sometimes it's very fast,

1:23:48.200 --> 1:23:49.860
 meaning you experience things in slow motion.

1:23:49.860 --> 1:23:51.140
 Sometimes it's very fast.

1:23:51.140 --> 1:23:55.980
 In waking too, your experience of time

1:23:55.980 --> 1:23:58.580
 can sometimes be very fast, sometimes be very slow.

1:23:58.580 --> 1:24:00.940
 Typically, the more alert you are,

1:24:00.940 --> 1:24:02.060
 the higher the frame rate,

1:24:02.060 --> 1:24:05.140
 your thin slicing your experience.

1:24:05.140 --> 1:24:06.400
 You've probably had this happen.

1:24:06.400 --> 1:24:07.500
 If you're ever very stressed

1:24:07.500 --> 1:24:09.900
 and you're waiting for something or somebody,

1:24:09.900 --> 1:24:12.300
 it seems like it takes forever

1:24:12.300 --> 1:24:14.020
 because your frame rate is higher.

1:24:14.020 --> 1:24:16.420
 You're analyzing time more finely.

1:24:16.420 --> 1:24:21.060
 Conversely, if you are very relaxed or even sleepy,

1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:22.660
 you wake up and you have to think about all the things

1:24:22.660 --> 1:24:23.500
 you have to do,

1:24:23.500 --> 1:24:25.680
 it will seem like the world is going by very, very fast

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:28.000
 and that you are moving very slow.

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.320
 Time is going at the same rate,

1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:33.580
 but your perception of time is what's changed.

1:24:33.580 --> 1:24:35.020
 Believe it or not,

1:24:35.020 --> 1:24:39.240
 your perception of time is also changed on a rapid basis,

1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:43.200
 moment to moment basis by how often you blink.

1:24:44.220 --> 1:24:46.780
 This is a well-established literature

1:24:46.780 --> 1:24:48.180
 in the world of neuroscience

1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:52.660
 that unlike the literature and claims about blinking

1:24:52.660 --> 1:24:55.660
 and sociopathy, which have no basis,

1:24:55.660 --> 1:24:59.020
 the science of blinking as it relates to time perception

1:24:59.020 --> 1:25:01.220
 has some very good data to support it.

1:25:01.220 --> 1:25:03.940
 I want to just emphasize one study in particular,

1:25:03.940 --> 1:25:06.500
 which is quite appropriately titled

1:25:06.500 --> 1:25:09.060
 Time Dilates After Spontaneous Blinking.

1:25:09.060 --> 1:25:11.480
 This is a paper that was published in Current Biology.

1:25:11.480 --> 1:25:15.380
 The first author is Terhune, T-E-R-H-U-N-E.

1:25:15.380 --> 1:25:16.580
 It's a wonderful paper.

1:25:17.500 --> 1:25:21.100
 They examined the relationship between fluctuations

1:25:21.100 --> 1:25:23.980
 in timing and blinking.

1:25:23.980 --> 1:25:26.180
 And to make a long story short,

1:25:26.180 --> 1:25:29.920
 what they found is that right after blinks,

1:25:29.920 --> 1:25:33.540
 we reset our perception of time, okay?

1:25:33.540 --> 1:25:36.100
 So blinks in that sense are a little bit like

1:25:36.100 --> 1:25:40.060
 the curtain coming down on a scene between scenes in a play

1:25:40.060 --> 1:25:42.340
 or takes in a movie, you know, when they clap,

1:25:42.340 --> 1:25:44.580
 the clap thing, they start it, take, you know,

1:25:44.580 --> 1:25:45.980
 what do they say?

1:25:45.980 --> 1:25:46.820
 Action.

1:25:46.820 --> 1:25:48.740
 And then at the end, they do the thing

1:25:48.740 --> 1:25:51.320
 and they click it down and they say, it's a take.

1:25:51.320 --> 1:25:52.520
 That's one take.

1:25:52.520 --> 1:25:55.040
 When you blink, it's a take, okay?

1:25:56.620 --> 1:26:00.200
 Now what's interesting and will immediately make sense to you

1:26:00.200 --> 1:26:02.740
 as to why this is important

1:26:02.740 --> 1:26:07.740
 is that the rate of blinking is controlled by dopamine.

1:26:08.340 --> 1:26:11.540
 So what this means is that dopamine is controlling attention,

1:26:11.540 --> 1:26:14.300
 blinks relate to attention and focus,

1:26:14.300 --> 1:26:16.940
 and therefore the dopamine and blinking system

1:26:16.940 --> 1:26:20.740
 is one way that you constantly modulate

1:26:20.740 --> 1:26:23.820
 and update your perception of time.

1:26:23.820 --> 1:26:27.060
 And fortunately, it's also one that you can control.

1:26:27.060 --> 1:26:29.140
 So the basic takeaway of this study

1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:31.220
 was that blinking controls time perception,

1:26:31.220 --> 1:26:33.860
 but also that levels of dopamine

1:26:33.860 --> 1:26:38.300
 can alter your sense of time and, stay with me here,

1:26:38.300 --> 1:26:42.940
 and that blinking and dopamine are inextricably linked.

1:26:42.940 --> 1:26:46.060
 They are working together to control your attention.

1:26:46.060 --> 1:26:48.460
 When dopamine levels go up,

1:26:48.460 --> 1:26:53.140
 people tend to overestimate how long something lasted.

1:26:53.140 --> 1:26:53.980
 Why?

1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:56.280
 Because they are processing time more finely.

1:26:56.280 --> 1:26:58.200
 It's slow motion mode.

1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:01.060
 When dopamine levels are lower,

1:27:01.060 --> 1:27:04.460
 they tend to underestimate time intervals.

1:27:04.460 --> 1:27:07.240
 Let's remember back to the very beginning of the episode,

1:27:07.240 --> 1:27:09.380
 what's going on in people with ADHD?

1:27:10.420 --> 1:27:12.620
 They are not good at managing their time.

1:27:12.620 --> 1:27:15.140
 They tend to run late or they are disorganized.

1:27:15.140 --> 1:27:17.780
 They are not just disorganized in space,

1:27:17.780 --> 1:27:20.100
 meaning in the physical space around them,

1:27:21.260 --> 1:27:23.580
 they are disorganized in time.

1:27:23.580 --> 1:27:25.300
 Their dopamine is low.

1:27:25.300 --> 1:27:26.740
 We know that as well.

1:27:26.740 --> 1:27:29.620
 And so they are underestimating time intervals.

1:27:29.620 --> 1:27:32.120
 And so it makes perfect sense that they would be late.

1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:34.460
 It makes perfect sense that they would lose track of time

1:27:34.460 --> 1:27:36.620
 or the ability to focus.

1:27:36.620 --> 1:27:37.740
 This is really exciting

1:27:37.740 --> 1:27:41.020
 because what it means is that children with ADHD,

1:27:41.020 --> 1:27:44.140
 adults with ADHD, or people with normal levels of focus

1:27:44.140 --> 1:27:46.900
 that want to improve their ability to focus

1:27:46.900 --> 1:27:49.460
 can do so through a training

1:27:49.460 --> 1:27:53.100
 that involves learning how often to blink and when,

1:27:53.100 --> 1:27:56.820
 and how to keep their visual focus on a given target.

1:27:56.820 --> 1:27:59.900
 And it turns out this study has actually been done.

1:27:59.900 --> 1:28:02.220
 There's a study again, I'll link to this study,

1:28:02.220 --> 1:28:04.100
 entitled Improvement of Attention

1:28:04.100 --> 1:28:06.020
 in Elementary School Students

1:28:06.020 --> 1:28:08.700
 Through Fixation-Focused Training Activity.

1:28:08.700 --> 1:28:10.180
 I won't go through all the details,

1:28:10.180 --> 1:28:12.980
 but what they found was a short period

1:28:12.980 --> 1:28:16.740
 of focusing on a visual target

1:28:16.740 --> 1:28:20.020
 allowed these school children to greatly enhance

1:28:20.020 --> 1:28:23.620
 their ability to focus on other types of information.

1:28:23.620 --> 1:28:25.520
 And a significant component of the effect

1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:28.360
 was due to the way that they were controlling the shutters

1:28:28.360 --> 1:28:31.700
 on their eyes, their eyelids, and controlling their blinks.

1:28:31.700 --> 1:28:34.180
 So what they did in the study is they had these kids

1:28:34.180 --> 1:28:36.760
 focus their visual attention on some object

1:28:36.760 --> 1:28:39.160
 that was relatively close, like their hand,

1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:41.920
 for a minute or so, which actually takes some effort

1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:42.840
 if you try and do that.

1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:45.080
 They were allowed to blink.

1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:47.660
 However, it's known from other work

1:28:47.660 --> 1:28:51.460
 that if people can consciously override the desire to blink,

1:28:51.460 --> 1:28:53.980
 at least to the point where they feel like they have to

1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:55.440
 or else their eyes would dry out,

1:28:55.440 --> 1:28:58.520
 that actually can increase attention even further.

1:28:58.520 --> 1:29:00.220
 And they had conditions where they would look

1:29:00.220 --> 1:29:02.260
 at a point further across the room

1:29:02.260 --> 1:29:04.580
 and even further across the room.

1:29:04.580 --> 1:29:07.300
 It only took a few minutes each day to do this,

1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:09.680
 30 seconds in one condition or maybe a minute,

1:29:09.680 --> 1:29:11.180
 and then at another station

1:29:11.180 --> 1:29:12.500
 of looking a little bit further out

1:29:12.500 --> 1:29:13.740
 and a little bit further out.

1:29:13.740 --> 1:29:16.380
 However, there was an important feature of this study

1:29:16.380 --> 1:29:18.560
 that is definitely worth mentioning,

1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:23.560
 which is before they did this visual focus task or training,

1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:27.360
 they did a series of physical movements with the kids

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:29.780
 so that the kids could sort of eliminate

1:29:29.780 --> 1:29:32.600
 or move out some of their desire to move

1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:36.360
 and would thereby enhance their ability to sit still.

1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:38.740
 Now, it's long been known that kids need a recess.

1:29:38.740 --> 1:29:41.400
 They need time to run around and play and roll around,

1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:42.440
 do whatever it is that they do

1:29:42.440 --> 1:29:44.820
 in order to be able to sit still at all.

1:29:44.820 --> 1:29:46.440
 Adults probably need this too, frankly,

1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:49.700
 but kids need it more because the circuits in the brain

1:29:49.700 --> 1:29:52.600
 that control reflexive movements

1:29:52.600 --> 1:29:56.160
 and as we say, kind of rhythmic undulating behavior

1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:58.800
 and things like that, that's an active suppression.

1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:00.760
 And kids have less of that circuitry built up

1:30:00.760 --> 1:30:03.920
 until they hit about age 15 or 16.

1:30:03.920 --> 1:30:06.140
 So they had the kids move around a bit

1:30:06.140 --> 1:30:08.500
 and then do this focus training.

1:30:08.500 --> 1:30:10.560
 That brings me to another treatment

1:30:10.560 --> 1:30:13.160
 that's actively used nowadays in schools

1:30:13.160 --> 1:30:17.240
 for kids with ADHD, but also it's starting to be used

1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:19.780
 by many kids and by parents

1:30:19.780 --> 1:30:22.480
 in order to keep their kids focusing

1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:27.320
 and not going crazy in the car or not acting out in general.

1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:31.100
 And that's the prevalence of these so-called fidgeter toys

1:30:31.100 --> 1:30:33.600
 or things that kids can do actively and repetitively

1:30:33.600 --> 1:30:35.840
 in order to move out some of their

1:30:35.840 --> 1:30:39.280
 underlying reverberatory activity in their nervous system.

1:30:39.280 --> 1:30:43.000
 So what you will find is that some kids with ADHD

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:45.660
 are now given a rubber band on their desk,

1:30:45.660 --> 1:30:47.440
 literally a rubber band that's attached to their desk

1:30:47.440 --> 1:30:49.160
 and they're able to pull on it,

1:30:49.160 --> 1:30:50.600
 even snap it against the desk.

1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:51.640
 If I had done that when I was a kid,

1:30:51.640 --> 1:30:53.380
 I think my teachers would have thrown me out of class,

1:30:53.380 --> 1:30:54.880
 but I think it's great that they're allowing them

1:30:54.880 --> 1:30:57.480
 to do this now as a way of moving

1:30:57.480 --> 1:31:00.640
 some of their physical energy out

1:31:00.640 --> 1:31:03.120
 or engage their physical energy rather,

1:31:03.120 --> 1:31:04.760
 as opposed to trying to sit,

1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:06.900
 statue still all the time and attend.

1:31:06.900 --> 1:31:08.840
 And it turns out that does enhance

1:31:08.840 --> 1:31:11.320
 these children's ability to focus mentally

1:31:11.320 --> 1:31:13.560
 when they have some physical activity to attend to.

1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:16.940
 And it turns out it also can work for adults.

1:31:16.940 --> 1:31:19.120
 I'll share with you a related anecdote

1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:21.720
 because it illustrates the underlying mechanism.

1:31:21.720 --> 1:31:23.520
 I've had the great privilege

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:25.860
 of being able to do a number of surgeries,

1:31:25.860 --> 1:31:28.480
 brain surgeries during my career.

1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:30.640
 So one thing you find when you do brain surgeries

1:31:30.640 --> 1:31:32.440
 is that the brain's pretty small,

1:31:32.440 --> 1:31:34.280
 regardless of the species that you're working on

1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:35.120
 and you're in there and you're trying

1:31:35.120 --> 1:31:36.880
 to do something very specific.

1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:40.420
 And the more you try and hold your hands really steady,

1:31:40.420 --> 1:31:42.480
 the more they want to shake, all right?

1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:44.600
 So it's not natural for any of our limbs

1:31:44.600 --> 1:31:46.760
 to sit perfectly still.

1:31:46.760 --> 1:31:48.140
 Depending on how much coffee you've had,

1:31:48.140 --> 1:31:49.680
 how well rested you are,

1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:52.060
 and your sort of baseline level of autonomic arousal,

1:31:52.060 --> 1:31:53.920
 some of you may find that you can hold out your hand

1:31:53.920 --> 1:31:55.680
 it absolutely rock solid.

1:31:55.680 --> 1:31:58.360
 Others will shake a little bit more.

1:31:58.360 --> 1:31:59.820
 Doesn't mean you're nervous if you're shaking,

1:31:59.820 --> 1:32:02.480
 doesn't mean you're calm if you're still.

1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:05.140
 What it relates to is the amount

1:32:05.140 --> 1:32:06.600
 of what we call pre-motor activity,

1:32:06.600 --> 1:32:08.320
 the number of commands to move

1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:09.680
 that are being sent through the system.

1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:11.960
 And that's what I mean by reverberatory activity.

1:32:11.960 --> 1:32:15.980
 And it does seem that kids with ADHD and adults with ADHD

1:32:15.980 --> 1:32:18.440
 have a lot of reverberatory activity

1:32:18.440 --> 1:32:19.540
 in their nervous system.

1:32:19.540 --> 1:32:21.120
 And so that's that constant desire to move.

1:32:21.120 --> 1:32:22.800
 It's hard for them to sit still

1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:24.880
 and therefore it's hard for them to attend,

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:26.220
 to harness their attention.

1:32:27.940 --> 1:32:29.600
 When you do a surgery and you find

1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:32.400
 that your hands are shaking,

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:34.420
 what you learn from your mentors, which I did,

1:32:34.420 --> 1:32:36.100
 and what works extremely well,

1:32:36.100 --> 1:32:37.760
 whether or not you're doing a surgery or not,

1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:39.520
 is that you simply tap your foot

1:32:39.520 --> 1:32:40.920
 or you bounce your knee a little bit,

1:32:40.920 --> 1:32:44.200
 which you might think would make your hand shake even more,

1:32:44.200 --> 1:32:45.920
 but provided that it's subtle,

1:32:45.920 --> 1:32:49.200
 what it does is it actually shuttles some of the activity

1:32:49.200 --> 1:32:51.920
 from those pre-motor circuits to elsewhere in the body.

1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:55.100
 And then you're able to sit much more still with your hand.

1:32:55.100 --> 1:32:57.680
 You're able to perform the surgery with much more precision.

1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:00.440
 You are able to write with much better handwriting.

1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:03.560
 And for those of you who engage in public speaking,

1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:04.800
 if you're ever too nervous,

1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:06.660
 that's why pacing while you public speak

1:33:06.660 --> 1:33:07.820
 helps if you're nervous.

1:33:07.820 --> 1:33:10.100
 That's why bouncing your knee behind the podium

1:33:10.100 --> 1:33:10.940
 works as well.

1:33:10.940 --> 1:33:13.840
 That's why nodding your head and gesticulating can help.

1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:16.560
 It's not a matter of quote unquote moving energy

1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:18.460
 out of the body that doesn't actually happen.

1:33:18.460 --> 1:33:20.940
 What it is is you're engaging those pre-motor circuits

1:33:20.940 --> 1:33:22.320
 that are sending through commands.

1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:25.000
 It's like trying to stuff a bunch of stuff through a funnel

1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:26.640
 and it creates this tension.

1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:30.980
 So you're giving it an outlet for the neural circuitry

1:33:30.980 --> 1:33:32.320
 to be able to move something

1:33:32.320 --> 1:33:34.600
 so that you can keep other components of your body

1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:37.480
 and your mental attention engaged

1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:40.960
 and locked onto something, what we call focus.

1:33:40.960 --> 1:33:42.580
 One thing related to this whole business

1:33:42.580 --> 1:33:45.480
 of blinking and focus and training yourself to focus

1:33:45.480 --> 1:33:47.440
 and not blinking, et cetera,

1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:52.440
 is that most all of the drugs, Ritalin, Adderall,

1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:55.100
 and recreational drugs that increase dopamine,

1:33:55.100 --> 1:33:58.320
 even coffee and tea and other forms of caffeine,

1:33:59.460 --> 1:34:01.720
 they tend to make us blink less.

1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:04.520
 And when we get tired, we tend to blink more.

1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:07.220
 Now, this is sort of a duh, right?

1:34:07.220 --> 1:34:10.560
 But being wide-eyed with excitement or fear

1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:15.320
 or with your eyes barely being able to keep them open,

1:34:15.320 --> 1:34:16.720
 now it should make perfect sense

1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:18.460
 that these shutters on the front of your eyes,

1:34:18.460 --> 1:34:20.300
 they aren't just there for winking

1:34:20.300 --> 1:34:22.920
 and they aren't just there for cosmetic purposes.

1:34:22.920 --> 1:34:26.280
 They are there to regulate the amount of information

1:34:26.280 --> 1:34:27.680
 going into your nervous system.

1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:31.100
 And they're there to regulate how long

1:34:31.100 --> 1:34:33.960
 you are bringing information into your nervous system

1:34:33.960 --> 1:34:38.960
 and in what bins, how widely or finely you are binning time

1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:43.180
 is set by how often you blink and how widely

1:34:43.180 --> 1:34:45.720
 or specifically you are grabbing attention

1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:47.320
 from the visual world is set by whether or not

1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:48.880
 you're viewing things very specifically,

1:34:48.880 --> 1:34:51.760
 like a crosshair or through a soda straw view like this,

1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:54.000
 or whether or not you were in this panoramic

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:57.160
 sort of whole environment mode,

1:34:57.160 --> 1:35:00.480
 this kind of fisheye lens or wide angle lens mode.

1:35:00.480 --> 1:35:03.200
 And in fairness to the pharmacology and the circuitry,

1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:07.740
 while dopamine and heightened levels of alertness

1:35:07.740 --> 1:35:12.740
 and excitement tend to make us blink less and attend more,

1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:14.380
 there's actually a study that's looked

1:35:14.380 --> 1:35:17.760
 at the other neurochemical systems and drugs

1:35:17.760 --> 1:35:19.400
 and how those relate to blinking.

1:35:19.400 --> 1:35:22.160
 And so this will all be obvious by the title of the paper

1:35:22.160 --> 1:35:23.080
 I'm about to share with you.

1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:25.280
 This is a paper entitled

1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:27.920
 Decreased Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates

1:35:27.920 --> 1:35:29.920
 in Chronic Cannabis Users,

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:34.120
 Evidence for Striatal Cannabinoid Dopamine Interactions.

1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:36.100
 Okay, I'm not going to go into all the details here,

1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:38.980
 but one thing that is somewhat surprising

1:35:38.980 --> 1:35:43.980
 is that many people with ADHD use or abuse cannabis.

1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:47.080
 You might think, well, why would they do that?

1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:50.520
 Because I thought that a increase in dopamine

1:35:50.520 --> 1:35:51.520
 is actually what's going to lead

1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:52.680
 to heightened levels of attention,

1:35:52.680 --> 1:35:55.160
 and that's what these people and children crave.

1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:56.680
 Well, it turns out that cannabis

1:35:56.680 --> 1:36:00.720
 also increases dopamine transmission in the brain,

1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:03.400
 but because of the other chemicals it increases,

1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:05.280
 namely serotonin and some components

1:36:05.280 --> 1:36:07.480
 of the cannabinoid and opioid system.

1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:12.480
 It creates that kind of alert, but mellow feel.

1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:15.480
 And again, here, I'm not a proponent of this.

1:36:15.480 --> 1:36:17.960
 I personally am not a THC or cannabis user.

1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:19.800
 It's just not my thing.

1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:21.760
 And obviously it's illegal some places,

1:36:21.760 --> 1:36:24.360
 and so you have to determine that for yourself.

1:36:24.360 --> 1:36:25.800
 It does have medical purposes,

1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:28.340
 and in some places it is legal,

1:36:28.340 --> 1:36:32.200
 but THC increases dopamine and increases neurochemicals

1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:34.100
 that can also create a state of calm.

1:36:34.100 --> 1:36:35.920
 So it's that sort of middle ground.

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:39.080
 And this paper has a beautiful demonstration whereby

1:36:40.160 --> 1:36:42.480
 not just while people are using cannabis,

1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:45.280
 but depending on how long they've been using cannabis

1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:49.120
 across their lifespan, the rates of eye blinking change.

1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:51.880
 So if you look at the number of years

1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:54.840
 that people have been using cannabis on a regular basis,

1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:58.620
 either daily or up to, excuse me, weekly or up to daily,

1:36:58.620 --> 1:37:00.640
 what you find is that for people

1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:02.720
 that have not been using cannabis at all

1:37:02.720 --> 1:37:05.480
 or have only been using it for about two years,

1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:08.220
 their rates of eye blinks are much higher

1:37:08.220 --> 1:37:10.600
 than people who have been using it chronically for 10 years.

1:37:10.600 --> 1:37:12.420
 In other words, people who've been using cannabis

1:37:12.420 --> 1:37:15.400
 for 10 years don't blink very often at all.

1:37:15.400 --> 1:37:19.480
 Now, cannabis has well-known effects in depleting memory,

1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:23.560
 but it does seem to engage the focus and blinking system

1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:25.580
 in a way that increases focus.

1:37:25.580 --> 1:37:27.280
 So basically what I'm saying is

1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:29.200
 marijuana seems to increase people's focus,

1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:32.040
 but then they can't remember what they were focusing on.

1:37:32.040 --> 1:37:33.920
 Something I'd like to discuss just briefly

1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:37.480
 is the so-called interoceptive awareness

1:37:37.480 --> 1:37:39.480
 that's present in people with ADHD,

1:37:39.480 --> 1:37:40.800
 both children and adults.

1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:43.660
 Interoceptive awareness is one sense

1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:47.520
 of one's own internal state, heartbeat, breathing,

1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:50.560
 contact of skin with a given surface, et cetera.

1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:52.780
 For a long time, there was this hypothesis,

1:37:52.780 --> 1:37:54.960
 this idea that people with ADHD

1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:57.560
 were just not in touch with how they felt,

1:37:57.560 --> 1:37:59.360
 that somehow they weren't registering

1:37:59.360 --> 1:38:01.400
 all the stuff that was going on inside them,

1:38:01.400 --> 1:38:02.960
 changes in heart rate and so forth.

1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:06.440
 And so they were behaving in a way that was dysregulated

1:38:06.440 --> 1:38:07.840
 or appear dysregulated.

1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:11.360
 And that if they could just learn to attend

1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:13.200
 to their internal state better,

1:38:13.200 --> 1:38:16.280
 that somehow they would function better in the world.

1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:19.280
 Now, before we described a process,

1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:23.080
 literally a 17 minute interoceptive exercise

1:38:23.080 --> 1:38:25.840
 that does seem to lead to improvements

1:38:25.840 --> 1:38:29.920
 in one's ability to focus for a longer period of time.

1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:33.560
 However, it's very unlikely that that was due

1:38:33.560 --> 1:38:37.320
 to increasing interoceptive awareness per se.

1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:41.380
 It probably wasn't because people gain a much heightened

1:38:41.380 --> 1:38:46.120
 or improved ability to understand what's going on internally.

1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:47.920
 In fact, you can imagine how that might actually

1:38:47.920 --> 1:38:49.920
 prevent one's ability to pay attention to things

1:38:49.920 --> 1:38:51.440
 in the outside world.

1:38:51.440 --> 1:38:53.620
 So while there is benefit to just sitting there

1:38:53.620 --> 1:38:55.340
 and being in stillness, as they say,

1:38:55.340 --> 1:38:57.860
 or focusing on one's breathing and internal state

1:38:57.860 --> 1:39:00.320
 for sake of then accessing information

1:39:00.320 --> 1:39:02.320
 in the external world,

1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:06.480
 a really nice study called Interoceptive Awareness

1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:08.560
 in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder

1:39:08.560 --> 1:39:11.100
 explored whether or not interoceptive awareness

1:39:11.100 --> 1:39:16.100
 was different in people with ADHD or did not have ADHD.

1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:20.160
 And the findings were essentially that there's no difference

1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:22.400
 that people with ADHD, children and adults,

1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:25.320
 they are aware of what's going on inside them

1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:27.520
 just as much as anyone else is.

1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:29.840
 And the typical measure of interoceptive awareness

1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:33.120
 is one's ability to count their own heartbeats.

1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:36.000
 This is actually challenging for some individuals

1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:37.840
 and very easy for other individuals,

1:39:37.840 --> 1:39:39.620
 regardless of their attentional capacity.

1:39:39.620 --> 1:39:41.840
 Some people just can really feel their heartbeat

1:39:41.840 --> 1:39:44.980
 without taking their pulse, other people cannot.

1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:47.360
 And these studies are pretty straightforward to do.

1:39:47.360 --> 1:39:50.800
 You ask people to sit there and to count their heartbeats

1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:52.660
 and then you are monitoring their heartbeats

1:39:52.660 --> 1:39:55.100
 and you get to gauge how accurate they are.

1:39:55.100 --> 1:39:58.940
 So it's important to understand that people with ADHD

1:39:58.940 --> 1:40:01.520
 are in touch with how they feel.

1:40:01.520 --> 1:40:03.640
 It's really a question of whether or not

1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:06.720
 they can take the demands that are placed upon them

1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:09.380
 and enter a cognitive state, a mental state

1:40:09.380 --> 1:40:11.180
 that allows them to access the information

1:40:11.180 --> 1:40:12.020
 they need to access.

1:40:12.020 --> 1:40:13.260
 In other words, whether or not they can focus.

1:40:13.260 --> 1:40:16.260
 But it is absolutely wrong to think that the child

1:40:16.260 --> 1:40:20.060
 that's getting up 11 times during a short six minute

1:40:20.060 --> 1:40:23.920
 interaction at the table, or whether or not a child

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:26.240
 who somehow has to venture off every moment

1:40:26.240 --> 1:40:28.280
 or a coworker of yours who's an adult,

1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:30.200
 who's constantly fidgeting or moving things around

1:40:30.200 --> 1:40:32.360
 that somehow they are unaware that they are oblivious.

1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:34.200
 They're not oblivious to how they feel.

1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:36.480
 Chances are they are very challenged in the situations

1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:38.480
 that they're in and they're doing everything they can

1:40:38.480 --> 1:40:40.380
 to try and regulate their attention.

1:40:40.380 --> 1:40:42.800
 So I think it's an important study to highlight

1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:44.720
 because it really underscores the fact that

1:40:44.720 --> 1:40:47.280
 something else is going on and that something else

1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:49.000
 has everything to do with this ability

1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.200
 to coordinate these task-directed networks

1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:53.880
 and to coordinate that in the proper way

1:40:53.880 --> 1:40:55.800
 with that default mode network.

1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:58.080
 And that is a process, as you now know,

1:40:58.080 --> 1:41:02.480
 that's regulated exquisitely by certain neurochemicals

1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:04.680
 and in particular, the neurochemicals dopamine,

1:41:04.680 --> 1:41:07.080
 norepinephrine, and serotonin.

1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:09.000
 And a fourth one I'd like to throw into the mix,

1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:11.560
 which is acetylcholine, which is very vital

1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:12.960
 for cognitive focus.

1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:15.360
 So now I want to switch back to talking about

1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:17.520
 some of the drugs that are typically used

1:41:17.520 --> 1:41:19.760
 to access those systems, prescription drugs.

1:41:19.760 --> 1:41:22.040
 And I want to talk about some of the new and emerging

1:41:22.040 --> 1:41:25.160
 non-prescription approaches to increasing the levels

1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:28.140
 of dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin in the brain

1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:30.240
 using various supplement type compounds

1:41:30.240 --> 1:41:32.740
 because several of them are showing

1:41:32.740 --> 1:41:34.760
 really remarkable efficacy

1:41:34.760 --> 1:41:36.720
 in excellent peer-reviewed studies.

1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:39.760
 So before moving to some of the newer atypical compounds

1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:41.880
 and things sold over the counter,

1:41:41.880 --> 1:41:46.300
 I'd like to just briefly return to the classic drugs

1:41:46.300 --> 1:41:48.360
 that are used to treat ADHD.

1:41:49.600 --> 1:41:51.600
 These are the ones I mentioned earlier,

1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:54.640
 methylphenidate, also called Ritalin,

1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:59.640
 modafinil, armodafinil is another one, and Adderall.

1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:03.620
 Again, all of these work by increasing levels of dopamine

1:42:03.620 --> 1:42:04.680
 and norepinephrine.

1:42:05.520 --> 1:42:08.840
 Typically, they are taken orally in pill form

1:42:08.840 --> 1:42:11.640
 or sometimes in capsule form.

1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:13.600
 The dosages that are appropriate

1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:17.320
 vary according to severity of the condition

1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:20.880
 for a given person and the age of the person.

1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:24.240
 This is a complicated landscape for each individual.

1:42:24.240 --> 1:42:25.760
 They have to figure out the pharmacology

1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:27.000
 that's best for them.

1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:30.360
 Some individuals are even layering long

1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:35.140
 or time to release Ritalin with Adderall in smaller doses.

1:42:35.140 --> 1:42:36.360
 It can get quite complex

1:42:36.360 --> 1:42:37.820
 or it can be quite straightforward.

1:42:37.820 --> 1:42:40.200
 If you are really interested in these drugs

1:42:40.200 --> 1:42:44.120
 and how they work, and you'd like to get a glance

1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:47.740
 at a table of all the results from all the studies

1:42:47.740 --> 1:42:49.840
 of which there are now hundreds,

1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:52.760
 there's an excellent review about these drugs

1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:55.560
 and their use and their comparison

1:42:55.560 --> 1:42:57.260
 to similarly structured drugs,

1:42:57.260 --> 1:43:01.520
 in particular MDMA and cocaine and amphetamine,

1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:03.020
 meaning street amphetamine,

1:43:03.020 --> 1:43:06.480
 to really illustrate the similarities of action

1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:10.280
 and some of the problems associated with long-term use.

1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:11.860
 I don't expect you to read this article in full.

1:43:11.860 --> 1:43:14.360
 I'm here so that you don't have to go read these articles,

1:43:14.360 --> 1:43:17.100
 but in case you want a ton of information,

1:43:17.100 --> 1:43:20.760
 the paper is Esposito et al, Frontiers in Biosciences.

1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:23.200
 It's an excellent, excellent review

1:43:23.200 --> 1:43:24.680
 of the entire literature.

1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:26.740
 It is quite long.

1:43:26.740 --> 1:43:29.860
 I can put a link to that study in our caption.

1:43:29.860 --> 1:43:33.120
 And it essentially describes all the studies

1:43:33.120 --> 1:43:35.960
 that have been done, peer reviewed and published.

1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:39.160
 And it refers to these drugs in an interesting way.

1:43:39.160 --> 1:43:41.960
 It doesn't just refer these drugs as for treatment of ADHD.

1:43:41.960 --> 1:43:44.260
 It actually refers to them using language

1:43:44.260 --> 1:43:46.680
 that ordinarily I'm not very fond of,

1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:48.120
 but I'll agree to here,

1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:51.360
 which is so-called smart drugs or nootropics.

1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:55.800
 It also covers caffeine, which again,

1:43:55.800 --> 1:43:59.340
 as I mentioned earlier, increases dopamine, norepinephrine,

1:43:59.340 --> 1:44:01.860
 and to some extent serotonin.

1:44:01.860 --> 1:44:04.500
 But what I like about this review so much

1:44:04.500 --> 1:44:07.000
 is that in putting these drugs of abuse,

1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:08.200
 methamphetamine and cocaine,

1:44:08.200 --> 1:44:11.480
 right alongside these drugs like Ritalin and Adderall

1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:12.320
 and also caffeine,

1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:14.800
 we start to realize that the distinction

1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:17.120
 between drugs of abuse and the distinction between drugs

1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:19.320
 of treatment is actually a very fine

1:44:19.320 --> 1:44:21.720
 and sometimes even a blurry line.

1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:23.960
 And in thinking about whether or not

1:44:23.960 --> 1:44:26.600
 one wants to use these prescription,

1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:28.440
 I want to emphasize prescription, not drugs of abuse,

1:44:28.440 --> 1:44:29.980
 but prescription drugs for treatment

1:44:29.980 --> 1:44:32.200
 of one's own attentional capacity,

1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:35.760
 I think it is important to understand the extent

1:44:35.760 --> 1:44:38.600
 to which they all carry more or less the same side effects.

1:44:38.600 --> 1:44:40.000
 The one exception being caffeine.

1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.840
 Caffeine side effects can be anxiety

1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:44.680
 if you ingest too much of it, insomnia,

1:44:44.680 --> 1:44:46.280
 if you drink it too late in the day,

1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:49.400
 but typically it will not cause the major side effects

1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:50.880
 of the other drugs,

1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:54.420
 such as high propensity for addiction and abuse,

1:44:55.920 --> 1:44:57.580
 amphetamines of any kind,

1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:00.640
 as well as cocaine can cause sexual side effects

1:45:00.640 --> 1:45:02.160
 because they're vasoconstrictors.

1:45:02.160 --> 1:45:06.480
 So, you know, men have trouble achieving erection.

1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:11.480
 There can often be the intense desire or libido for sex,

1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:14.320
 but an inability to actually perform.

1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:16.940
 So that's an issue with any kind of stimulant.

1:45:16.940 --> 1:45:19.240
 So these drugs are not without their consequences.

1:45:19.240 --> 1:45:24.000
 In addition, and here I'd lump caffeine back into the mix.

1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:27.720
 In addition, they almost all carry cardiac effects, right?

1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:28.840
 They increase heart rate,

1:45:28.840 --> 1:45:32.800
 but they also have effects on constriction of blood vessels

1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:34.520
 and arteries and veins and so forth

1:45:34.520 --> 1:45:37.520
 in ways that can create cardiovascular problems.

1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:40.500
 Now, caffeine is a bit of a complicated one.

1:45:40.500 --> 1:45:42.600
 I talked about this on a podcast long ago,

1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:44.900
 but I'll just remind you that it turns out

1:45:44.900 --> 1:45:46.680
 that if you are caffeine adapted,

1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:49.260
 in other words, if you are used to drinking caffeine,

1:45:49.260 --> 1:45:51.240
 then the ingestion of caffeine

1:45:51.240 --> 1:45:53.240
 most often will cause vasodilation.

1:45:53.240 --> 1:45:55.520
 It will actually allow more blood flow through.

1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:57.680
 However, if you are not caffeine adapted,

1:45:57.680 --> 1:45:59.560
 it will cause vasoconstriction

1:45:59.560 --> 1:46:02.120
 due to an increased stress response.

1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:04.180
 So if you're familiar with caffeine,

1:46:04.180 --> 1:46:06.320
 caffeine can actually have a little bit more

1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:08.040
 of a relaxation response,

1:46:08.040 --> 1:46:09.060
 although if you drink enough of it,

1:46:09.060 --> 1:46:10.960
 it will make you amped up.

1:46:10.960 --> 1:46:14.920
 These other drugs almost always lead to vasoconstriction,

1:46:14.920 --> 1:46:17.320
 increased heart rate, dilation of the pupils,

1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:19.860
 less blinking, heightened levels of attention,

1:46:19.860 --> 1:46:22.000
 which looks very much like stress,

1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.120
 and at its extremes looks very much like

1:46:24.120 --> 1:46:27.240
 the effects of street drugs like cocaine and amphetamine.

1:46:27.240 --> 1:46:29.120
 Because of the large amounts of dopamine

1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:30.580
 that are released in the brain,

1:46:30.580 --> 1:46:33.320
 people tend to crave that state over and over,

1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:36.240
 and yet with each subsequent use

1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:39.360
 are able to get less and less of that euphoric feeling

1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:41.300
 or that really, really focused feeling.

1:46:41.300 --> 1:46:43.520
 So one thing that's being explored quite extensively now

1:46:43.520 --> 1:46:47.720
 in the treatment of ADHD are drug schedules,

1:46:47.720 --> 1:46:51.680
 whether or not people should take Adderall every day

1:46:51.680 --> 1:46:52.760
 or every other day,

1:46:52.760 --> 1:46:53.800
 whether or not they should take it

1:46:53.800 --> 1:46:55.120
 only every once in a while,

1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:57.720
 whether or not young children can take it just a few times

1:46:57.720 --> 1:47:00.400
 and engage in behavioral training of the sort

1:47:00.400 --> 1:47:02.940
 that I talked about before where they're doing,

1:47:02.940 --> 1:47:05.960
 maybe it's a 17 minute meditation type exercise,

1:47:05.960 --> 1:47:08.080
 but more likely it would be the movement

1:47:08.080 --> 1:47:10.400
 followed by the visual focusing,

1:47:10.400 --> 1:47:12.960
 because that's only done for 20 or 30 or 60 seconds.

1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:13.840
 Why would you do that?

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:16.460
 Well, in a chemically enhanced state,

1:47:16.460 --> 1:47:17.800
 your brain is more plastic.

1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:21.680
 The circuits are able to modify and learn better.

1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:25.800
 That's the optimal time to engage in focus

1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:27.320
 in a very deliberate way.

1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:29.740
 So just taking a drug and expecting focus

1:47:29.740 --> 1:47:31.080
 to just work at any point

1:47:31.080 --> 1:47:35.040
 and being able to turn focus on and off at will,

1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:37.980
 that's an unrealistic expectation, right?

1:47:37.980 --> 1:47:42.980
 More likely the best use of things like Adderall,

1:47:42.980 --> 1:47:46.740
 modafinil, armodafinil, and Ritalin

1:47:46.740 --> 1:47:48.680
 is going to be to combine those treatments

1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:52.660
 with behavioral exercises that actively engage

1:47:52.660 --> 1:47:55.320
 the very circuits that you're trying to train up and enhance

1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:57.980
 and then perhaps, I want to highlight perhaps,

1:47:57.980 --> 1:47:59.360
 tapering off those drugs

1:47:59.360 --> 1:48:01.540
 so that then one can use those circuits

1:48:01.540 --> 1:48:04.440
 without any need for chemical intervention.

1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:07.120
 So despite any controversy that might be out there,

1:48:07.120 --> 1:48:09.680
 I think it's fair to say that the consumption

1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:14.160
 of omega-3 fatty acids can positively modulate

1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:16.600
 the systems for attention and focus.

1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:20.480
 So then the question becomes how much EPA,

1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:22.500
 how much DHA does that differ

1:48:22.500 --> 1:48:25.760
 for what's helpful for depression, et cetera?

1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:27.880
 And actually it does differ.

1:48:27.880 --> 1:48:29.280
 In reviewing the studies for this,

1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:34.280
 it appears that a threshold level of 300 milligrams of DHA

1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:37.200
 turns out to be an important inflection point.

1:48:37.200 --> 1:48:41.720
 So typically fish oils or other sources of omega-3s

1:48:41.720 --> 1:48:43.960
 will have DHA and EPA.

1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:47.320
 And typically it's the EPA that's harder to get

1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:48.160
 at sufficient levels,

1:48:48.160 --> 1:48:50.140
 meaning you have to take quite a lot of fish oil

1:48:50.140 --> 1:48:52.380
 in order to get above that 1000 milligram

1:48:52.380 --> 1:48:55.720
 or 2000 milligram threshold to improve mood

1:48:55.720 --> 1:48:56.680
 and other functions.

1:48:56.680 --> 1:48:59.280
 But for sake of attention,

1:48:59.280 --> 1:49:02.400
 there are 10 studies that have explored this in detail.

1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:05.400
 And while the EPA component is important,

1:49:05.400 --> 1:49:07.560
 the most convincing studies point to the fact

1:49:07.560 --> 1:49:12.080
 that getting above 300 milligrams per day of DHA

1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:14.240
 is really where you start to see the attentional effects.

1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:16.440
 Now, fortunately, if you're getting sufficient EPA

1:49:16.440 --> 1:49:19.360
 for sake of mood and other biological functions,

1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:22.560
 almost without question,

1:49:22.560 --> 1:49:25.200
 you're getting 300 milligrams or more of DHA.

1:49:25.200 --> 1:49:27.800
 So that usually checks that box just fine.

1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:30.040
 What's interesting is that there's another compound,

1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:34.200
 phosphatidylsterine that has been explored

1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:37.640
 for its capacity to improve the symptoms of ADHD.

1:49:37.640 --> 1:49:39.700
 Again, I don't think this is any direct way,

1:49:39.700 --> 1:49:41.840
 but rather in a modulatory way.

1:49:41.840 --> 1:49:46.160
 But it appears that phosphatidylsterine taken for two months

1:49:46.160 --> 1:49:49.640
 for 200 milligrams per day

1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:52.920
 was able to reduce the symptoms of ADHD in children.

1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:55.400
 It has not been looked at in adults yet,

1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:57.240
 at least as far as I know,

1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:00.560
 but that this effect was greatly enhanced

1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:03.520
 by the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids.

1:50:03.520 --> 1:50:05.680
 So now we're starting to see synergistic effects

1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:08.900
 of omega-3 fatty acids and phosphatidylsterine.

1:50:08.900 --> 1:50:11.180
 Again, that was 200 milligrams per day.

1:50:11.180 --> 1:50:12.800
 This is something that sold over the counter

1:50:12.800 --> 1:50:15.200
 in capsule form, at least in the US.

1:50:15.200 --> 1:50:18.440
 There were two studies, both were double blind studies

1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:21.080
 carried out for anywhere from one to six months

1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:22.700
 on both boys and girls.

1:50:22.700 --> 1:50:24.760
 And it really was boys and girls, not men and women.

1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:28.840
 This was kids age one to six or seven to 12.

1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:32.120
 And it was a fairly large number of subjects.

1:50:32.120 --> 1:50:35.520
 So 147 subjects in one case and 36 in the other.

1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:39.240
 The takeaway is that getting sufficient levels of EPAs,

1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:42.760
 in particular this 300 milligram threshold of DHA,

1:50:42.760 --> 1:50:46.720
 plus if you are interested in it and it's right for you,

1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:48.920
 200 milligrams of phosphatidylsterine

1:50:48.920 --> 1:50:50.400
 can be an important augment

1:50:50.400 --> 1:50:53.480
 for improving the symptoms of ADHD.

1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:55.360
 You'll also find literature out there

1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:59.240
 and many claims about so-called ginkgo bilboa,

1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:01.780
 which has been shown to have minor effects

1:51:01.780 --> 1:51:04.500
 in improving the symptoms of ADHD.

1:51:04.500 --> 1:51:07.860
 Not nearly as effective as Ritalin and Adderall.

1:51:09.160 --> 1:51:12.440
 Ginkgo bilboa is not appropriate for many people.

1:51:12.440 --> 1:51:14.120
 I am one such person.

1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:18.140
 I don't have ADHD, but when I've taken ginkgo,

1:51:18.140 --> 1:51:19.280
 even at very low doses,

1:51:19.280 --> 1:51:21.640
 I get absolutely splitting headaches.

1:51:21.640 --> 1:51:23.400
 Some people do not experience those headaches,

1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:26.400
 but it's known to have very potent vasoconstrictive

1:51:26.400 --> 1:51:29.200
 and vasodilating properties that vary

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:31.960
 depending on when you took the compound.

1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:35.760
 So for those of you that are exploring ginkgo bilboa,

1:51:35.760 --> 1:51:38.040
 and you will see a lot of claims about ginkgo bilboa

1:51:38.040 --> 1:51:39.560
 for attention in ADHD,

1:51:39.560 --> 1:51:43.840
 definitely take the vasodilation, vasoconstriction headache

1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:45.980
 issue into consideration.

1:51:45.980 --> 1:51:48.400
 So I'd like to talk about the drug modafinil

1:51:48.400 --> 1:51:50.920
 and the closely related drug armodafinil,

1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:53.120
 that's AR modafinil,

1:51:53.120 --> 1:51:55.480
 because modafinil and armodafinil

1:51:55.480 --> 1:51:57.320
 are gaining popularity out there,

1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:00.260
 both for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy,

1:52:00.260 --> 1:52:03.760
 but also for communities of people

1:52:03.760 --> 1:52:05.920
 that are trying to stay awake long periods of time.

1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:10.000
 So it's actively used in the military by first responders.

1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:13.100
 It's gaining popularity on college campuses,

1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:15.440
 and people are using it more and more as an alternative

1:52:15.440 --> 1:52:20.440
 to Adderall and Ritalin and excessive amounts of coffee.

1:52:20.440 --> 1:52:23.640
 It does increase focus and to a dramatic extent.

1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:28.200
 Modafinil typically was very expensive.

1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:30.080
 I don't know if it's still this expensive,

1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:32.660
 but when one has a prescription for it,

1:52:32.660 --> 1:52:35.560
 it could still cost as much as eight or $900

1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:37.920
 or even a thousand dollars a month.

1:52:37.920 --> 1:52:41.940
 R-modafinil is a far less expensive version

1:52:41.940 --> 1:52:44.900
 that's chemically slightly different than modafinil.

1:52:44.900 --> 1:52:45.840
 Regardless of price,

1:52:45.840 --> 1:52:48.920
 people are taking modafinil and R-modafinil.

1:52:48.920 --> 1:52:52.520
 Want to emphasize that unlike Ritalin and Adderall,

1:52:52.520 --> 1:52:54.720
 modafinil and R-modafinil

1:52:54.720 --> 1:52:57.720
 are weak dopamine reuptake inhibitors,

1:52:57.720 --> 1:53:00.120
 and that's how they lead to increases in dopamine.

1:53:00.120 --> 1:53:03.060
 So whereas Ritalin and Adderall, amphetamine and cocaine

1:53:03.060 --> 1:53:05.320
 lead to big increases in dopamine,

1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:07.880
 also through reuptake mechanisms and so forth,

1:53:07.880 --> 1:53:12.800
 modafinil is a weaker dopamine reuptake stimulator.

1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:15.800
 And so what that means is that it leaves more dopamine

1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:17.720
 around to be active at the synapse,

1:53:17.720 --> 1:53:19.880
 the gaps between neurons.

1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:22.040
 However, it also activates other systems.

1:53:22.040 --> 1:53:24.240
 It acts on the orexin system,

1:53:24.240 --> 1:53:26.380
 which is actually a peptide that we talked about

1:53:26.380 --> 1:53:28.400
 in the episode on hunger,

1:53:28.400 --> 1:53:31.100
 because it regulates hunger and appetite,

1:53:31.100 --> 1:53:34.280
 and it regulates sleepiness and feelings of sleepiness.

1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:37.700
 In fact, the orexin, also called hypocretin system,

1:53:37.700 --> 1:53:39.320
 the orexin hypocretin system

1:53:39.320 --> 1:53:42.040
 is what's disrupted in narcolepsy.

1:53:42.040 --> 1:53:44.400
 That was the important discovery of my colleagues,

1:53:44.400 --> 1:53:46.600
 Emmanuel Mignon and Seiji Nishino

1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:48.320
 at Stanford some years ago,

1:53:48.320 --> 1:53:50.960
 they identified the biological basis of narcolepsy,

1:53:50.960 --> 1:53:54.800
 and it's a disruption in the orexin hypocretin system,

1:53:54.800 --> 1:53:56.960
 and modafinil is one of the primary treatments

1:53:56.960 --> 1:53:58.120
 for narcolepsy.

1:53:58.120 --> 1:54:01.600
 It also has these other effects on the dopamine system

1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:03.900
 and on the norepinephrine system.

1:54:03.900 --> 1:54:08.480
 Even though it doesn't lead to quite as intense levels

1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:11.360
 of dopamine and arousal and focus,

1:54:11.360 --> 1:54:12.600
 it does have the property

1:54:12.600 --> 1:54:14.840
 of raising levels of attention and focus,

1:54:14.840 --> 1:54:16.160
 and that's why people are using it.

1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:19.400
 So it's a somewhat milder form of Adderall.

1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:23.120
 R-modafinil, for some people, works as well as modafinil,

1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:24.760
 and as I mentioned before, it's much lower cost.

1:54:24.760 --> 1:54:26.240
 For other people, it doesn't.

1:54:26.240 --> 1:54:30.280
 I have an experience, meaning I do have an experience

1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:32.520
 that I'll share with you with R-modafinil.

1:54:32.520 --> 1:54:34.560
 A few years ago, I was suffering from jet lag

1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:38.860
 really terribly, and I was traveling overseas.

1:54:38.860 --> 1:54:40.780
 I went to a meeting to give a talk.

1:54:40.780 --> 1:54:45.740
 I took half of the prescribed dose of R-modafinil.

1:54:45.740 --> 1:54:47.680
 It was prescribed to me.

1:54:47.680 --> 1:54:51.200
 I took that half dose, and I gave my lecture,

1:54:51.200 --> 1:54:53.120
 and then I stayed around to answer questions,

1:54:53.120 --> 1:54:57.160
 and then four hours later, a friend of mine came up to me

1:54:57.160 --> 1:54:59.080
 and said, you know, you've been talking

1:54:59.080 --> 1:55:01.040
 for four and a half hours,

1:55:01.040 --> 1:55:03.580
 and there are only a few people still here.

1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:04.920
 Luckily, there were still a few people.

1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:07.680
 It'd be a lot weirder if the room was completely empty

1:55:07.680 --> 1:55:09.440
 since it wasn't being recorded.

1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:10.960
 So I have firsthand knowledge

1:55:10.960 --> 1:55:13.960
 of the sorts of cognitive effects that it can create.

1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:16.460
 I personally would not want to be in that state

1:55:16.460 --> 1:55:18.120
 for sake of studying or learning

1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:21.280
 or for doing this podcast, for instance,

1:55:21.280 --> 1:55:23.200
 and I can honestly say that today,

1:55:23.200 --> 1:55:25.560
 all I've ingested is some coffee

1:55:25.560 --> 1:55:28.140
 and some yerba mate tea and some water.

1:55:28.140 --> 1:55:30.440
 I'm not on any of the compounds that I've described

1:55:30.440 --> 1:55:32.780
 during the course of today's episode.

1:55:32.780 --> 1:55:36.060
 You might ask why I took half the recommended dose

1:55:36.060 --> 1:55:39.720
 of R-modafinil, and the reason is that I'm somebody

1:55:39.720 --> 1:55:44.500
 who's fairly hypersensitive to medication of any kind.

1:55:44.500 --> 1:55:46.800
 What you find if you look in the literature

1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:48.580
 is that about 5% of people

1:55:48.580 --> 1:55:50.800
 are hyper hypersensitive to medication.

1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:53.880
 They require far lower doses of any medication

1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:56.560
 than other people in order to experience the same effects.

1:55:56.560 --> 1:56:00.120
 I'm somebody that I think is sort of modest hyper,

1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:02.120
 if that sort of oxymoronic statement,

1:56:02.120 --> 1:56:05.340
 but a modest hypersensitivity to medication,

1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:07.160
 so I've almost always been able to get by

1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:09.800
 on taking less of whatever was prescribed for me

1:56:10.840 --> 1:56:11.880
 and feel just fine,

1:56:11.880 --> 1:56:13.960
 or in this case to feel like it was still too much.

1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:17.160
 It turned out that the right dose of R-modafinil for me

1:56:17.160 --> 1:56:19.080
 was zero milligrams.

1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:21.000
 Now you may notice that I haven't talked much

1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:22.760
 about acetylcholine.

1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:24.920
 Acetylcholine is a neurotransmitter

1:56:24.920 --> 1:56:26.960
 that at the neuron to muscle connections,

1:56:26.960 --> 1:56:28.840
 the so-called neuromuscular junctions,

1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:30.840
 is involved in generating muscular contractions

1:56:30.840 --> 1:56:32.800
 of all kinds for all movements.

1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:37.160
 Acetylcholine is also released from two sites in the brain.

1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:38.520
 So a little bit of nomenclature here.

1:56:38.520 --> 1:56:41.040
 Again, feel free to ignore the nomenclature,

1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:43.680
 but there is a collection of neurons in your brainstem

1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:45.060
 that send projections forward,

1:56:45.060 --> 1:56:48.380
 kind of like a sprinkler system that's very diffuse

1:56:48.380 --> 1:56:50.020
 to release acetylcholine.

1:56:50.020 --> 1:56:53.620
 And those neurons reside in an area or a structure

1:56:53.620 --> 1:56:57.240
 that's called the pedunculopontine nucleus, the PPN.

1:56:57.240 --> 1:56:59.340
 And then there's a separate collection of neurons

1:56:59.340 --> 1:57:02.880
 in the basal forebrain called unimaginatively

1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:05.680
 nucleus basalis, the nucleus at the base.

1:57:05.680 --> 1:57:09.260
 And they also hose the brain with acetylcholine,

1:57:09.260 --> 1:57:11.800
 but in a much more specific way.

1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:13.720
 So one is sort of like a sprinkler system,

1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:15.400
 and the other one is more like a fire hose

1:57:15.400 --> 1:57:16.480
 to a particular location.

1:57:16.480 --> 1:57:21.000
 And those two sources of acetylcholine collaborate

1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:23.760
 to activate particular locations in the brain

1:57:23.760 --> 1:57:26.520
 and really bring about a tremendous degree of focus

1:57:26.520 --> 1:57:29.700
 to whatever is happening at those particular synapses.

1:57:29.700 --> 1:57:31.980
 So it could be a focus on visual information

1:57:31.980 --> 1:57:33.180
 or auditory information.

1:57:33.180 --> 1:57:35.960
 If you're listening closely to what I'm saying right now,

1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:37.880
 or you just heard closely step out

1:57:37.880 --> 1:57:39.380
 from the rest of my sentence,

1:57:39.380 --> 1:57:42.560
 no doubt there was acetylcholine released at the sites

1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:45.040
 in your brain where the neurons that represent

1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:49.240
 your recognition of the word closely occurred, okay?

1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:51.340
 So now you have an example and you have an understanding

1:57:51.340 --> 1:57:52.480
 and hopefully a picture in your mind

1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:54.560
 of how all this is working.

1:57:54.560 --> 1:57:58.240
 Not surprisingly then, drugs that increase cholinergic

1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:00.280
 or acetylcholine transmission

1:58:00.280 --> 1:58:03.320
 will increase focus and cognition.

1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:06.380
 One such compound is so-called alpha-GPC,

1:58:06.380 --> 1:58:08.320
 which is a form of choline

1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:11.040
 and increases acetylcholine transmission.

1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:14.600
 Dosages as high as 1200 milligrams per day,

1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:16.480
 which is a very high dosage spread out,

1:58:16.480 --> 1:58:19.560
 typically it's 300 or 400 milligrams spread out

1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:21.200
 throughout the day,

1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:24.560
 have been shown to offset some of the effects

1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:26.240
 of age-related cognitive decline,

1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:27.440
 improve cognitive functioning.

1:58:27.440 --> 1:58:29.560
 People that don't have age-related cognitive decline,

1:58:29.560 --> 1:58:30.940
 that's a very high dose.

1:58:30.940 --> 1:58:34.720
 Typically when people are using alpha-GPC to study

1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:36.900
 or to enhance learning of any kind,

1:58:36.900 --> 1:58:39.960
 they will take somewhere between 300 and 600 milligrams,

1:58:39.960 --> 1:58:41.660
 that's more typical.

1:58:41.660 --> 1:58:43.640
 Again, you have to check with your doctor,

1:58:43.640 --> 1:58:45.360
 you have to decide if the safety margins

1:58:45.360 --> 1:58:47.080
 are appropriate for you.

1:58:47.080 --> 1:58:49.520
 Obviously you'll want to check that out,

1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:53.200
 but alpha-GPC is effective in creating more focus

1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:54.880
 by way of this cholinergic system.

1:58:54.880 --> 1:58:56.740
 It stimulates acetylcholine release

1:58:56.740 --> 1:58:58.880
 from both of those locations,

1:58:58.880 --> 1:59:00.760
 the PPN in the back of the brain

1:59:00.760 --> 1:59:03.420
 and nucleus basalis in the front of the brain.

1:59:04.260 --> 1:59:07.440
 There are two other over-the-counter compounds

1:59:07.440 --> 1:59:11.520
 that are in active use out there for treatment of ADHD

1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:15.800
 and in use for simply trying to improve focus.

1:59:15.800 --> 1:59:17.640
 And the first one is L-tyrosine.

1:59:17.640 --> 1:59:20.240
 It's an amino acid that acts as a precursor

1:59:20.240 --> 1:59:22.340
 to the neuromodulator dopamine.

1:59:22.340 --> 1:59:24.520
 And now knowing everything you know about dopamine attention

1:59:24.520 --> 1:59:25.780
 and the circuits involved,

1:59:25.780 --> 1:59:26.840
 it should come as no surprise

1:59:26.840 --> 1:59:29.960
 as to why people are exploring the use of L-tyrosine

1:59:29.960 --> 1:59:31.280
 for that purpose.

1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:34.640
 L-tyrosine does lead to increases in dopamine.

1:59:35.680 --> 1:59:37.280
 They are fairly long-lived

1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:41.340
 and L-tyrosine can improve one's ability to focus.

1:59:41.340 --> 1:59:46.040
 However, the dosaging can be very tricky to dial in.

1:59:46.040 --> 1:59:48.700
 Sometimes it makes people feel too euphoric

1:59:48.700 --> 1:59:50.500
 or too jittery or too alert

1:59:50.500 --> 1:59:53.220
 that they are then unable to focus well.

1:59:53.220 --> 1:59:56.280
 So the dosage ranges are huge.

1:59:56.280 --> 1:59:58.600
 You see evidence for 100 milligrams

1:59:58.600 --> 2:00:00.860
 all the way up to 1200 milligrams.

2:00:00.860 --> 2:00:02.200
 It's something that really should be approached

2:00:02.200 --> 2:00:04.120
 with caution, especially for people

2:00:04.120 --> 2:00:06.380
 that have any kind of underlying psychiatric

2:00:06.380 --> 2:00:07.520
 or mood disorder,

2:00:07.520 --> 2:00:10.100
 because dysregulation of the dopamine system

2:00:10.100 --> 2:00:13.960
 is central to many of the mood disorders,

2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:15.380
 such as depression,

2:00:15.380 --> 2:00:17.520
 but also especially mania,

2:00:17.520 --> 2:00:18.860
 mania bipolar disorder,

2:00:18.860 --> 2:00:21.000
 schizophrenia, things of that sort.

2:00:21.000 --> 2:00:22.640
 So it's something that really should be approached

2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:23.460
 with caution.

2:00:23.460 --> 2:00:25.940
 Nonetheless, in exploring what's out there

2:00:25.940 --> 2:00:27.760
 and even some studies online

2:00:29.260 --> 2:00:32.520
 that were done either animal studies or human studies,

2:00:32.520 --> 2:00:35.560
 it's clear that L-tyrosine is being explored

2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:36.500
 for that purpose,

2:00:36.500 --> 2:00:39.380
 as is PEA and phenylethylamine,

2:00:39.380 --> 2:00:42.040
 which is essentially PEA,

2:00:42.040 --> 2:00:43.880
 but some related compounds.

2:00:43.880 --> 2:00:46.680
 So there's a whole class of dopaminergic

2:00:46.680 --> 2:00:48.760
 or dopamine stimulating supplements

2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:49.720
 that people are using to try

2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:51.000
 and get their dopamine levels up.

2:00:51.000 --> 2:00:53.720
 And again, it's kind of a fine line

2:00:53.720 --> 2:00:57.400
 between too little enough and too much.

2:00:57.400 --> 2:01:00.840
 If you want to get the literature on those two compounds,

2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:03.560
 there I will refer you to this great website

2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:07.080
 at examine.com, just as it sounds.

2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:09.760
 And you can put in L-tyrosine or PEA

2:01:09.760 --> 2:01:11.020
 and you can get the details on that.

2:01:11.020 --> 2:01:13.280
 But I highly recommend also going to their section

2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:16.400
 on ADHD to see how those particular compounds

2:01:16.400 --> 2:01:20.920
 relate specifically to ADHD and cognitive focus.

2:01:20.920 --> 2:01:22.520
 And last but not least,

2:01:22.520 --> 2:01:24.260
 in terms of these different compounds,

2:01:24.260 --> 2:01:26.860
 I do want to mention the racetams.

2:01:27.840 --> 2:01:30.440
 These are somewhat esoteric

2:01:30.440 --> 2:01:32.600
 and probably most of you haven't heard about them,

2:01:32.600 --> 2:01:35.320
 but some of you probably know a lot about them

2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:36.740
 and they are becoming more popular.

2:01:36.740 --> 2:01:40.600
 They go by names like Nupept and things of that sort.

2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:43.760
 The racetams are illegal in certain countries.

2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:45.660
 They are gray market in other countries

2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:47.820
 and they are sold over the counter

2:01:47.820 --> 2:01:50.480
 in this country, in the US.

2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:54.280
 So they have different margins for safety.

2:01:54.280 --> 2:01:56.560
 You definitely need to consult your doctor,

2:01:56.560 --> 2:01:58.620
 especially if you have ADHD.

2:01:58.620 --> 2:02:02.200
 But Nupept has been shown when taken, you know,

2:02:02.200 --> 2:02:04.720
 at 10 milligrams twice daily,

2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:07.800
 can be more effective than some of the other racetams.

2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:08.640
 What is Nupept?

2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:10.960
 Nupept taps into the cholinergic system,

2:02:10.960 --> 2:02:14.720
 the acetylcholine system in ways very similar to alpha-GPC,

2:02:14.720 --> 2:02:17.340
 but seems to have a slightly higher affinity

2:02:17.340 --> 2:02:19.320
 for some of the receptors involved

2:02:19.320 --> 2:02:21.140
 and can lead to those heightened states

2:02:21.140 --> 2:02:23.080
 of cognitive capacity.

2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:26.440
 And there are these studies, one in particular,

2:02:26.440 --> 2:02:28.520
 comparative studies of Nupept and paracetam

2:02:28.520 --> 2:02:31.800
 and the treatment of patients with mild cognitive disorders

2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:34.300
 and brain diseases of vascular and traumatic origin.

2:02:34.300 --> 2:02:35.140
 That's a mouthful.

2:02:35.140 --> 2:02:37.500
 What this study basically points to

2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:39.440
 is the fact that people who are experiencing

2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:42.200
 some degree of inability to focus

2:02:42.200 --> 2:02:45.540
 due to prior concussion or some vascular event,

2:02:45.540 --> 2:02:47.800
 a stroke or ischemia of any kind,

2:02:47.800 --> 2:02:49.080
 because neurons need blood,

2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:50.920
 when the blood supply is cut off to neurons

2:02:50.920 --> 2:02:52.760
 or when there's a bleed in the brain,

2:02:52.760 --> 2:02:53.760
 subsequent to that,

2:02:53.760 --> 2:02:56.720
 often there are challenges in maintaining focus.

2:02:56.720 --> 2:02:59.080
 This is very common for people that have done sports

2:02:59.080 --> 2:03:00.620
 where there's a lot of running into each other

2:03:00.620 --> 2:03:04.320
 with your head, like rugby, football, hockey, and so forth,

2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:06.100
 but also people who have experienced head blows

2:03:06.100 --> 2:03:08.440
 or often overlooked is the fact that

2:03:08.440 --> 2:03:11.360
 most traumatic head injury is not actually from sports,

2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:14.080
 even football, it's from things like construction work,

2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:16.600
 from high impact work of that kind.

2:03:16.600 --> 2:03:18.520
 So there does seem to be some efficacy

2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:21.760
 of Nupept and paracetam and things like it.

2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:24.140
 It's an emerging area.

2:03:24.140 --> 2:03:25.480
 And as I mentioned in the US,

2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:27.320
 these things are sold over the counter.

2:03:27.320 --> 2:03:29.600
 Again, you have to figure out if it's right for you,

2:03:29.600 --> 2:03:32.860
 but they are beginning to show some promise

2:03:32.860 --> 2:03:34.940
 and I'm intrigued by them

2:03:34.940 --> 2:03:37.680
 because of the way that they tap into the cholinergic system

2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:40.600
 which is both directly involved in focus

2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:42.400
 and the ability to focus,

2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:45.760
 but is also important for things related

2:03:45.760 --> 2:03:47.640
 to age-related cognitive decline.

2:03:47.640 --> 2:03:51.280
 So a decline in cholinergic transmission or acetylcholine

2:03:51.280 --> 2:03:53.120
 as we call it in the brain

2:03:53.120 --> 2:03:55.540
 is one of the things associated with cognitive decline.

2:03:55.540 --> 2:03:58.360
 And it does seem that increasing cholinergic transmission

2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:00.360
 can offset some of that cognitive decline

2:04:00.360 --> 2:04:03.240
 and perhaps even more so in conditions

2:04:03.240 --> 2:04:06.280
 such as vascular damage or concussion to the brain.

2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:09.520
 If you're interested in atypical treatments for ADHD,

2:04:10.800 --> 2:04:13.280
 compounds to improve focus and related themes

2:04:13.280 --> 2:04:14.920
 and you like reading about this stuff,

2:04:14.920 --> 2:04:17.960
 there's an excellent review article that I can refer you to.

2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:20.880
 It's by Ann et al, AHN.

2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:22.560
 It was published in 2016.

2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:24.240
 So it's a little bit behind the times,

2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:27.680
 although it's surprisingly comprehensive given that,

2:04:27.680 --> 2:04:32.520
 which lines up all the various drugs that I've discussed,

2:04:32.520 --> 2:04:34.560
 racetams and Adderall and Ritalin

2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:38.080
 and various forms of dopaminergic agents

2:04:38.080 --> 2:04:40.600
 and cholinergic agents spells out whether or not

2:04:40.600 --> 2:04:43.320
 they are sold over the counter by prescription

2:04:43.320 --> 2:04:45.180
 and really lines them up in all their effects,

2:04:45.180 --> 2:04:48.120
 their drawbacks, et cetera.

2:04:48.120 --> 2:04:49.360
 I'll refer you to that study.

2:04:49.360 --> 2:04:52.280
 It's available in its full length form online for free.

2:04:53.280 --> 2:04:58.280
 It's on et al, the journal is Neuroplasticity 2016.

2:04:58.920 --> 2:05:01.360
 Should be very easy to find if you put those keywords in.

2:05:01.360 --> 2:05:04.360
 And while it is a review, it is a very comprehensive review.

2:05:04.360 --> 2:05:06.080
 And if you're really into this stuff

2:05:06.080 --> 2:05:07.980
 and you also want to learn a thing or two

2:05:07.980 --> 2:05:11.440
 about how these things interact with neurofeedback, et cetera,

2:05:11.440 --> 2:05:13.440
 there's some information in there as well.

2:05:13.440 --> 2:05:15.540
 I know I've already covered a lot of information,

2:05:15.540 --> 2:05:18.480
 but there is one more category of technology

2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:22.520
 for the treatment of ADHD and for enhancement of focus

2:05:22.520 --> 2:05:25.880
 in anyone that I would like to emphasize.

2:05:25.880 --> 2:05:28.880
 And that's transcranial magnetic stimulation.

2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:31.940
 Transcranial magnetic stimulation, also called TMS,

2:05:31.940 --> 2:05:34.560
 is achieving increasing popularity nowadays

2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:38.360
 for the treatment of all sorts of neurologic conditions

2:05:38.360 --> 2:05:40.160
 and psychiatric conditions.

2:05:40.160 --> 2:05:41.800
 It is a non-invasive tool.

2:05:41.800 --> 2:05:45.480
 It involves taking a coil, it's a device with a coil

2:05:45.480 --> 2:05:48.960
 that's placed over particular locations in the brain

2:05:48.960 --> 2:05:53.320
 and then sends magnetic stimulation into the brain.

2:05:53.320 --> 2:05:54.520
 It can actually pass through the skull

2:05:54.520 --> 2:05:56.520
 without having to drill through the skull.

2:05:56.520 --> 2:05:59.840
 And nowadays can be used to both lower

2:05:59.840 --> 2:06:02.560
 the amount of activity or increase the amount of activity

2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:04.760
 in specific brain areas.

2:06:04.760 --> 2:06:09.760
 Its spatial precision is not remarkable.

2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:11.200
 That doesn't mean it's not of use,

2:06:11.200 --> 2:06:16.200
 but it is not a super fine grain tool, okay?

2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:19.480
 It's not a cannon, but it's also not a needle.

2:06:19.480 --> 2:06:21.180
 It is somewhere in between.

2:06:21.180 --> 2:06:23.840
 It can direct the activity of particular brain regions

2:06:23.840 --> 2:06:25.600
 at particular depths.

2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:27.200
 And as I mentioned, it can increase

2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:28.440
 or decrease that activity.

2:06:28.440 --> 2:06:31.160
 So for instance, I've had a TMS coil placed on my head,

2:06:31.160 --> 2:06:33.360
 not for therapeutic purposes,

2:06:33.360 --> 2:06:34.800
 even it was, I wouldn't tell you,

2:06:34.800 --> 2:06:37.940
 but rather just for, well, I'm a neuroscientist

2:06:37.940 --> 2:06:39.000
 and I worked in a lab with one

2:06:39.000 --> 2:06:41.280
 for entertainment exploratory purposes.

2:06:41.280 --> 2:06:42.680
 Please don't do this at home.

2:06:44.120 --> 2:06:46.760
 It was placed over my motor cortex,

2:06:46.760 --> 2:06:49.240
 which generates voluntary action.

2:06:49.240 --> 2:06:52.240
 And it was a coil that at that time

2:06:52.240 --> 2:06:54.120
 could only inhibit neurons.

2:06:54.120 --> 2:06:56.640
 And so what I was doing is I was moving objects

2:06:56.640 --> 2:06:58.440
 around on a table, just like I am now.

2:06:58.440 --> 2:07:00.280
 It was actually a pencil, not a pen.

2:07:00.280 --> 2:07:01.940
 And I was tapping the pencil

2:07:01.940 --> 2:07:04.440
 and then the TMS coil was turned on.

2:07:04.440 --> 2:07:08.520
 And for the life of me, I could not move that pencil, okay?

2:07:08.520 --> 2:07:11.480
 Because it was inhibiting my upper motor neurons

2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:12.920
 in the portion of my cortex

2:07:12.920 --> 2:07:15.560
 that controls voluntary activity.

2:07:15.560 --> 2:07:16.920
 As soon as the coil was turned off,

2:07:16.920 --> 2:07:19.900
 I could return to tapping the pencil again.

2:07:19.900 --> 2:07:23.120
 Nowadays, it's possible to stimulate motor cortex

2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:26.160
 or any area of the brain with some degree of precision

2:07:26.160 --> 2:07:29.500
 that could create the impulse to move

2:07:29.500 --> 2:07:31.640
 without actually making the decision to move.

2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:34.760
 So you can literally engage certain neural circuits

2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:36.840
 and therefore behaviors and certain thought

2:07:36.840 --> 2:07:37.940
 and emotional patterns

2:07:37.940 --> 2:07:40.720
 by way of transcranial magnetic stimulation.

2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:43.800
 This has far reaching and vast implications

2:07:43.800 --> 2:07:46.080
 as you can probably imagine.

2:07:46.980 --> 2:07:50.720
 In discussing ADHD with a colleague that uses TMS,

2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:55.360
 what they are doing is they are taking the TMS coil

2:07:55.360 --> 2:07:59.120
 to children and adults that have ADHD

2:07:59.120 --> 2:08:01.920
 and they're using it to stimulate the portions

2:08:01.920 --> 2:08:04.720
 of the prefrontal cortex that we talked about earlier

2:08:04.720 --> 2:08:08.560
 that engage task-directed focused states.

2:08:08.560 --> 2:08:11.440
 So rather than using a drug that generally increases dopamine

2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:13.080
 and some of the other chemicals involved,

2:08:13.080 --> 2:08:17.280
 they're using directed TMS stimulation of these circuits.

2:08:17.280 --> 2:08:20.440
 And fortunately, I was quite relieved to hear this,

2:08:20.440 --> 2:08:24.040
 they are combining that with a focused learning task.

2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:25.900
 So they're literally teaching the brain to learn

2:08:25.900 --> 2:08:28.780
 in a non-invasive way, no drug at all.

2:08:28.780 --> 2:08:30.880
 And right now there are experiments,

2:08:30.880 --> 2:08:34.080
 clinical trials going on comparing TMS of this sort

2:08:34.080 --> 2:08:37.520
 to the drug treatments of the sort that we described earlier

2:08:37.520 --> 2:08:40.120
 that engage these circuits through pharmacologic mechanisms.

2:08:40.120 --> 2:08:43.040
 So very exciting times for TMS,

2:08:43.040 --> 2:08:48.040
 very exciting times for pharmacology related to ADHD

2:08:48.040 --> 2:08:49.720
 and for enhancing focus in general.

2:08:49.720 --> 2:08:51.520
 And when I say very exciting times,

2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:53.420
 I mean, no drug is perfect,

2:08:53.420 --> 2:08:57.200
 but the constellation of drugs that's out there

2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:58.880
 is getting much larger,

2:08:58.880 --> 2:09:01.280
 but because they tap into different aspects

2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:02.120
 of their circuitry,

2:09:02.120 --> 2:09:04.020
 I do think that we are well on our way

2:09:04.020 --> 2:09:06.800
 to identifying the ideal combinations of drug treatments,

2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:09.800
 technological treatments and behavioral paradigms

2:09:09.800 --> 2:09:14.120
 for increasing focus in both children and adults with ADHD.

2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:16.620
 And as a final, final point,

2:09:16.620 --> 2:09:18.940
 I also want to mention something about technologies

2:09:18.940 --> 2:09:22.080
 that are making it harder for all of us to focus,

2:09:22.080 --> 2:09:23.200
 regardless of whether or not

2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:26.060
 we have preexisting ADHD or not.

2:09:26.060 --> 2:09:28.760
 You can probably guess where this is going.

2:09:28.760 --> 2:09:31.160
 Everybody nowadays seems to have a smartphone.

2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:33.200
 I'm sure there are a few individuals out there

2:09:33.200 --> 2:09:35.520
 that don't have a smartphone.

2:09:35.520 --> 2:09:37.120
 Nonetheless, most people have them.

2:09:37.120 --> 2:09:40.040
 Most kids want one as soon as they can get them

2:09:40.040 --> 2:09:43.520
 and they are small.

2:09:43.520 --> 2:09:45.880
 They grab our attention entirely,

2:09:45.880 --> 2:09:48.520
 but within that small box of attention,

2:09:48.520 --> 2:09:53.120
 there are millions of attentional windows scrolling by.

2:09:53.120 --> 2:09:55.140
 So just because it's one device that we look at

2:09:55.140 --> 2:09:56.760
 does not mean that we are focused.

2:09:56.760 --> 2:09:58.600
 We are focused on our phone,

2:09:58.600 --> 2:10:01.000
 but because of the way in which context

2:10:01.000 --> 2:10:03.800
 switches up so fast within the phone,

2:10:03.800 --> 2:10:06.400
 it's thought that the brain is struggling now

2:10:06.400 --> 2:10:09.520
 to leave that rapid turnover of context.

2:10:09.520 --> 2:10:12.160
 Many, many shows, many, many Instagram pages,

2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:14.200
 many, many Twitter feeds, many, many websites,

2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:17.880
 basically the whole world, at least in virtual format,

2:10:17.880 --> 2:10:20.120
 is available within that small box.

2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:21.860
 Unlike any other technology humans

2:10:21.860 --> 2:10:23.080
 have ever dealt with before,

2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:25.340
 even though there are trillions,

2:10:25.340 --> 2:10:27.120
 infinite number of bits of information

2:10:27.120 --> 2:10:29.240
 in the actual physical world,

2:10:29.240 --> 2:10:32.700
 your attentional window, that aperture of constriction

2:10:32.700 --> 2:10:34.860
 and dilating that visual window

2:10:34.860 --> 2:10:36.080
 is the way in which you cope

2:10:36.080 --> 2:10:39.120
 with all that overwhelming information typically.

2:10:39.120 --> 2:10:40.600
 Well, within the phone,

2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:43.980
 your visual aperture is set to a given width.

2:10:43.980 --> 2:10:45.000
 It's about this big.

2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:46.720
 Typically the phone seemed to be getting bigger,

2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:48.920
 but nonetheless, it's about that big.

2:10:48.920 --> 2:10:52.300
 And within there, your attentional window

2:10:52.300 --> 2:10:56.160
 is grabbing a near infinite number of bits of information,

2:10:56.160 --> 2:10:57.260
 colors, movies.

2:10:57.260 --> 2:10:59.080
 If a picture is worth a thousand words,

2:10:59.080 --> 2:11:01.400
 a movie is worth a billion pictures.

2:11:01.400 --> 2:11:03.520
 The brain loves visual motion.

2:11:03.520 --> 2:11:06.060
 And so the question is,

2:11:06.960 --> 2:11:09.360
 does that sort of interaction on a regular basis

2:11:09.360 --> 2:11:12.560
 lead to deficits in the types of attention that we need

2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:13.580
 in order to perform well

2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:15.840
 in work and school relationships, et cetera?

2:11:15.840 --> 2:11:19.160
 And the short answer is yes, it does appear so.

2:11:19.160 --> 2:11:22.120
 We are inducing a sort of ADHD.

2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:24.280
 And while the studies on this are ongoing

2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:26.120
 because prominent use of smartphones

2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:30.200
 really took off right around 2010 and we're only in 2021,

2:11:30.200 --> 2:11:33.520
 longstanding studies take time,

2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:36.880
 which is essentially to say the same thing as longstanding.

2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:39.060
 There are some studies and one in particular

2:11:39.060 --> 2:11:39.900
 that I'd like to highlight.

2:11:39.900 --> 2:11:42.860
 One was actually carried out pretty early in 2014.

2:11:42.860 --> 2:11:46.040
 This is a study that explored smartphone use,

2:11:46.040 --> 2:11:47.920
 at the time they called it mobile phone use,

2:11:47.920 --> 2:11:50.600
 but smartphone use and inattention,

2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:55.600
 difficulties in attending in 7,102 adolescents.

2:11:56.880 --> 2:11:57.980
 So this is a huge study,

2:11:57.980 --> 2:12:01.240
 a population-based cross-sectional study.

2:12:01.240 --> 2:12:06.240
 And you will be probably surprised and somewhat dismayed

2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:10.040
 to hear that in order to avoid this decrease

2:12:10.040 --> 2:12:13.800
 in attentional capacity, adolescents needed

2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:18.800
 to use their smartphone for less than 60 minutes per day

2:12:19.240 --> 2:12:22.960
 in order to stay focused and centered on their other tasks.

2:12:22.960 --> 2:12:26.360
 Otherwise they started to really run into significant issues.

2:12:26.360 --> 2:12:28.280
 So 60 minutes is not much.

2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:31.360
 I have a feeling that most young people

2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:33.640
 are using their phone more than 60 minutes per day.

2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:35.120
 I know I am.

2:12:35.120 --> 2:12:38.120
 I think for adults, the number is probably higher,

2:12:38.120 --> 2:12:40.640
 meaning if you're an adult,

2:12:40.640 --> 2:12:43.760
 I'm going to just extrapolate from what I read in this study.

2:12:43.760 --> 2:12:47.080
 It seems that probably two hours a day on the phone

2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:49.720
 would be the upper limit beyond which

2:12:49.720 --> 2:12:51.400
 you would probably experience

2:12:51.400 --> 2:12:54.020
 pretty severe attentional deficits.

2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:57.160
 I'm a big fan of Cal Newport who wrote the book,

2:12:57.160 --> 2:12:58.000
 "'Deep Work.'"

2:12:58.000 --> 2:12:59.220
 He's also written the excellent book,

2:12:59.220 --> 2:13:00.360
 "'A World Without Email.'"

2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:02.420
 I've never met him, but I'm a huge admirer of his work.

2:13:02.420 --> 2:13:05.120
 And I will paraphrase something that he said

2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:07.400
 far more eloquently than I ever could,

2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:11.100
 which is that the brain does not do well

2:13:11.100 --> 2:13:13.960
 with constant context switching,

2:13:13.960 --> 2:13:15.560
 meaning it can do it,

2:13:15.560 --> 2:13:18.580
 but it diminishes our capacity to do meaningful work

2:13:18.580 --> 2:13:20.280
 of any other kind.

2:13:20.280 --> 2:13:24.120
 And so Cal, as I understand is very,

2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:26.760
 he's a computer science professor at Georgetown, by the way,

2:13:26.760 --> 2:13:29.860
 is very structured and very disciplined

2:13:29.860 --> 2:13:32.280
 in his avoidance of cell phone use.

2:13:33.220 --> 2:13:34.820
 I think we're all striving to do that.

2:13:34.820 --> 2:13:36.060
 I'm not here to tell you what to do,

2:13:36.060 --> 2:13:39.480
 but I think whether or not you have ADHD or not,

2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:40.580
 if you're an adolescent,

2:13:40.580 --> 2:13:45.320
 limiting your smartphone use to 60 minutes per day or less,

2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:49.880
 and if you are an adult to two hours per day or less

2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:54.100
 is going to be among the very best ways to maintain,

2:13:54.100 --> 2:13:56.600
 just to maintain your ability to focus

2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:58.780
 at whatever level you can now.

2:13:58.780 --> 2:14:01.320
 And as I always say,

2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:03.580
 most of the things that we get recognized for in life,

2:14:03.580 --> 2:14:05.860
 success in life in every endeavor,

2:14:05.860 --> 2:14:09.180
 whether or not it's school, relationships, sport,

2:14:09.180 --> 2:14:12.760
 creative works of any kind are always proportional

2:14:12.760 --> 2:14:16.020
 to the amount of focus that we can bring that activity.

2:14:16.020 --> 2:14:18.240
 It is important to rest, of course, to get proper sleep,

2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:20.340
 but I stand behind that statement.

2:14:20.340 --> 2:14:23.340
 And I leave you with that study about attention

2:14:23.340 --> 2:14:26.640
 and cell phones and how cell phones are indeed eroding

2:14:26.640 --> 2:14:28.560
 our attentional capacities.

2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:31.640
 So I realized I covered a lot of information about ADHD

2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:35.640
 and the biology of focus and how to get better at focusing.

2:14:35.640 --> 2:14:37.560
 We talked about the behavioral

2:14:37.560 --> 2:14:40.200
 and psychological phenotypes of ADHD.

2:14:40.200 --> 2:14:43.600
 We talked about the underlying neural circuitry.

2:14:43.600 --> 2:14:45.880
 We also talked about the neurochemistry,

2:14:45.880 --> 2:14:48.920
 and we talked about the various prescription drug treatments

2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:51.100
 that are aimed at that neurochemistry

2:14:51.100 --> 2:14:52.840
 and aimed at increasing focus

2:14:52.840 --> 2:14:55.500
 in children and adults with ADHD.

2:14:55.500 --> 2:14:58.240
 We also talked about over-the-counter compounds,

2:14:58.240 --> 2:15:01.680
 the role of particular types of diets and elimination diets.

2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:03.400
 And we talked about interactions

2:15:03.400 --> 2:15:07.020
 between these various features in dictating outcomes

2:15:07.020 --> 2:15:10.060
 for ADHD and enhancing focus in general.

2:15:10.060 --> 2:15:13.380
 We also talked a little bit about emerging neurotechnologies

2:15:13.380 --> 2:15:15.840
 and how certain technologies like the smartphone

2:15:15.840 --> 2:15:18.560
 are no doubt hindering our ability to focus

2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:23.480
 and put us at greater risk of developing ADHD at all ages.

2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:27.000
 I do acknowledge the irony and somewhat the contradiction

2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:30.600
 of doing a two-hour plus episode on ADHD

2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:32.840
 if indeed people who are watching this

2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:34.440
 have challenges with attention.

2:15:34.440 --> 2:15:36.440
 I want to emphasize that this podcast,

2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:38.480
 like all of our podcast episodes,

2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:41.160
 are timestamped for a specific reason.

2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:42.400
 They are designed to be digested

2:15:42.400 --> 2:15:45.540
 in whatever batch one chooses, right?

2:15:45.540 --> 2:15:46.680
 You don't have to watch or listen

2:15:46.680 --> 2:15:48.320
 to the entire thing all at once.

2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:51.320
 However, if you've gotten to this point in the podcast,

2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:52.280
 I want to thank you.

2:15:52.280 --> 2:15:55.360
 I do hope that you've learned a lot about this condition.

2:15:55.360 --> 2:15:57.000
 I hope you've also learned a lot

2:15:57.000 --> 2:15:58.940
 about your own capacity to focus

2:15:58.940 --> 2:16:00.800
 and things that you can do to enhance your focus.

2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:02.880
 We even talked about a tool that takes just one

2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:06.400
 17-minute session to enhance your ability to focus

2:16:06.400 --> 2:16:09.280
 thereafter, presumably forever.

2:16:09.280 --> 2:16:11.640
 If you're enjoying this podcast and you're learning from it,

2:16:11.640 --> 2:16:13.240

2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:16.980
 In addition, in the comment section on YouTube,

2:16:16.980 --> 2:16:20.000
 you can leave us suggestions for future podcast guests

2:16:20.000 --> 2:16:22.600
 and suggestions for future podcast topics

2:16:22.600 --> 2:16:23.820
 that we may have not covered

2:16:23.820 --> 2:16:26.200
 or that you'd like to see covered in the future.

2:16:26.200 --> 2:16:28.000
 In addition, please subscribe to the podcast

2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:29.520
 on Apple and Spotify.

2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:32.120
 And on Apple, you have the opportunity to leave us a comment

2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:34.480
 and up to a five-star review.

2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:36.680
 In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned

2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:37.920
 at the beginning of the podcast.

2:16:37.920 --> 2:16:40.020
 That's a terrific way to support us.

2:16:40.020 --> 2:16:42.460
 And for those of you that would like to support research

2:16:42.460 --> 2:16:44.980
 on stress, neurobiology, and human performance,

2:16:44.980 --> 2:16:47.840
 you can go to hubermanlab.stanford.edu,

2:16:47.840 --> 2:16:50.440
 and there you can make a tax-deductible donation

2:16:50.440 --> 2:16:53.860
 for research on neurobiology in my laboratory.

2:16:53.860 --> 2:16:55.260
 In addition, we have a Patreon.

2:16:55.260 --> 2:16:58.480
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:00.480
 There, you can support the podcast

2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:01.880
 at any level that you like.

2:17:01.880 --> 2:17:02.800
 During today's episode,

2:17:02.800 --> 2:17:05.960
 we talked a lot about supplement-based compounds.

2:17:05.960 --> 2:17:07.220
 If you're interested in supplements

2:17:07.220 --> 2:17:09.480
 and you want to see the supplements that I personally take,

2:17:09.480 --> 2:17:10.940
 you can go to Thorne.

2:17:10.940 --> 2:17:15.680
 That's T-H-O-R-N-E slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:17:15.680 --> 2:17:17.880
 And you can see everything that I take,

2:17:17.880 --> 2:17:20.580
 and you can get 20% off any of those supplements.

2:17:20.580 --> 2:17:23.840
 Or if you navigate into the Thorne site through that portal,

2:17:23.840 --> 2:17:25.880
 you can get 20% off any of the supplements

2:17:25.880 --> 2:17:27.340
 that Thorne makes.

2:17:27.340 --> 2:17:28.760
 Supplements aren't for everybody.

2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:30.700
 You by no means have to take supplements,

2:17:30.700 --> 2:17:32.060
 but if you are going to take supplements,

2:17:32.060 --> 2:17:33.280
 it's important that you take supplements

2:17:33.280 --> 2:17:35.200
 from a source that's reputable,

2:17:35.200 --> 2:17:38.200
 in which the ingredients are very high quality,

2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:40.460
 and in which the amount of the ingredients

2:17:40.460 --> 2:17:41.760
 that listed on the bottle

2:17:41.760 --> 2:17:43.380
 actually matches what's in the bottle.

2:17:43.380 --> 2:17:44.960
 That's why we partnered with Thorne,

2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:46.900
 because they have the highest levels of stringency

2:17:46.900 --> 2:17:50.000
 in terms of quality and specificity of the ingredients.

2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000
 And finally, I want to thank you for your time

2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:53.280
 and your attention.

2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:56.160
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

2:17:56.160 --> 2:17:58.160
 I'll see you next time.
