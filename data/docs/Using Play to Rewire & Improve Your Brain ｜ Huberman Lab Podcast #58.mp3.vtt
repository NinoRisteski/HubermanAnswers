00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.240 --> 00:12.000
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.000 --> 00:15.000
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.180
 Today, we are going to talk about the biology,

00:17.180 --> 00:20.320
 psychology, and utility of play.

00:21.260 --> 00:23.380
 Play is something that normally we associate

00:23.380 --> 00:27.700
 with children's games, and indeed with being a child.

00:27.700 --> 00:30.780
 Much of our childhood development centers around play,

00:30.780 --> 00:34.520
 whether or not it's organized play or spontaneous play.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.280
 But as adults, we also need to play.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.960
 And today I'm going to talk about what I like to refer to

00:39.960 --> 00:42.240
 as the power of play.

00:42.240 --> 00:45.560
 The power of play resides in play's ability

00:45.560 --> 00:48.600
 to change our nervous system for the better

00:48.600 --> 00:51.460
 so that we can perform many activities,

00:51.460 --> 00:54.440
 not just play activities, better.

00:54.440 --> 00:58.840
 Play can also function as a way to explore new ways of being

00:58.840 --> 01:02.280
 in different scenarios, in work, in relationships,

01:02.280 --> 01:03.440
 in settings of all kind,

01:03.440 --> 01:06.560
 and indeed also in the relationship to oneself.

01:06.560 --> 01:07.880
 In fact, we are going to explore

01:07.880 --> 01:10.160
 how assuming different identities

01:10.160 --> 01:14.680
 during the same game of play or the same forms of play

01:14.680 --> 01:16.920
 has been shown to be immensely powerful

01:16.920 --> 01:20.040
 for allowing people to engage in more creative thinking

01:20.040 --> 01:22.760
 and dynamic thinking and indeed to become better leaders

01:22.760 --> 01:25.860
 and more effective workers and students and learners

01:25.860 --> 01:27.840
 and happier people.

01:27.840 --> 01:29.760
 I'm also going to cover some data that shows

01:29.760 --> 01:32.240
 that learning to play properly

01:32.240 --> 01:34.160
 can enhance one's ability to focus

01:34.160 --> 01:36.560
 and is an active area of research

01:36.560 --> 01:39.440
 for treatment of things like ADHD,

01:39.440 --> 01:41.620
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

01:41.620 --> 01:45.080
 just as a little sneak preview of where that's headed.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.920
 Children who do not access enough play

01:47.920 --> 01:49.800
 during certain stages of childhood

01:49.800 --> 01:52.040
 are more prone to develop ADHD.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.580
 The good news is all of us,

01:53.580 --> 01:56.040
 regardless of whether or not we have a ADHD or not,

01:56.040 --> 01:58.800
 whether or not we had ample access to play

01:58.800 --> 02:00.760
 during childhood or not,

02:00.760 --> 02:04.240
 can engage and grow the neural circuits

02:04.240 --> 02:08.120
 that allow for this incredible power of play.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.040
 And this can be done again at any stage of life.

02:10.040 --> 02:12.280
 Today, we're going to talk about the protocols, the science.

02:12.280 --> 02:13.300
 We will review all of that.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.200
 And I promise you'll come away with a lot of knowledge,

02:16.200 --> 02:18.760
 whether or not you're a parent, whether or not you're a child

02:18.760 --> 02:20.680
 whether or not you're a person of any age,

02:20.680 --> 02:22.360
 you're going to have tools and knowledge

02:22.360 --> 02:23.640
 that will benefit you.

02:23.640 --> 02:25.920
 Before we begin, I want to share with you the results

02:25.920 --> 02:28.360
 of what I think to be an extremely exciting

02:28.360 --> 02:31.200
 and certainly an actionable study that was just published

02:31.200 --> 02:33.280
 in the journal Scientific Reports.

02:33.280 --> 02:36.200
 This is an excellent journal, Nature Press Journal,

02:36.200 --> 02:37.760
 peer reviewed, et cetera.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.400
 And the findings center around what sorts of devices

02:41.400 --> 02:44.240
 we happen to be reading on and accessing information on

02:44.240 --> 02:46.880
 and how that's impacting our physiology

02:46.880 --> 02:48.880
 and our capacity to learn.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.580
 One of the more frequent questions I get

02:50.580 --> 02:54.720
 is what are all these devices, phones, tablets, computers,

02:54.720 --> 02:57.240
 video games, et cetera, doing to our brains?

02:57.240 --> 02:59.480
 And finally, there's some good peer reviewed data

02:59.480 --> 03:02.960
 to look at that and to address it directly.

03:02.960 --> 03:07.960
 This study, first author Honma, H-O-N-M-A, Honma et al.,

03:08.160 --> 03:11.960
 is entitled Reading on a Smartphone Affects Psi Generation,

03:11.960 --> 03:13.760
 that's S-I-G-H, Psi Generation,

03:13.760 --> 03:15.720
 Brain Activity and Comprehension.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.640
 And to just summarize what they found,

03:17.640 --> 03:22.640
 they ran a study on 34 healthy individuals

03:23.000 --> 03:27.360
 and had them either read material on a smartphone

03:27.360 --> 03:31.040
 or on regular printed paper or a book.

03:31.040 --> 03:34.320
 And what they found is that comprehension on devices,

03:34.320 --> 03:38.440
 in particular smartphones, is much poorer,

03:38.440 --> 03:42.620
 much worse than it is when one reads on actual paper.

03:42.620 --> 03:46.000
 Now, some of you may experience this yourselves.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.560
 Now, they compared smartphones with paper

03:48.560 --> 03:50.800
 and what they found was that

03:50.800 --> 03:52.780
 when they looked at people's breathing,

03:52.780 --> 03:54.240
 the normal patterns of breathing

03:54.240 --> 03:55.480
 that people were engaging in

03:55.480 --> 03:58.460
 did not differ between people reading on a smartphone

03:58.460 --> 04:00.720
 or reading from paper.

04:00.720 --> 04:05.040
 However, one particular feature of breathing did differ.

04:05.040 --> 04:06.200
 And that particular feature

04:06.200 --> 04:08.100
 is what we call physiological size.

04:08.100 --> 04:09.960
 I've talked a lot about physiological size

04:09.960 --> 04:11.920
 on this podcast and on social media.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.560
 We had a terrific guest, Professor Jack Feldman

04:14.560 --> 04:16.200
 from University of California, Los Angeles,

04:16.200 --> 04:19.200
 who's a world expert in breathing and respiration

04:19.200 --> 04:20.820
 and its impacts on the brain

04:20.820 --> 04:23.400
 and how brain controls breathing and respiration.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.200
 And what you can learn from that episode,

04:25.200 --> 04:26.360
 or I'll just tell you again right now,

04:26.360 --> 04:28.680
 is that every five minutes or so,

04:28.680 --> 04:30.140
 whether or not we are asleep or awake,

04:30.140 --> 04:31.860
 we do what's called a physiological sigh,

04:31.860 --> 04:33.720
 which is a big, deep inhale,

04:33.720 --> 04:37.180
 often a double inhale followed by a long exhale.

04:37.180 --> 04:38.580
 It goes something like this.

04:38.580 --> 04:43.580
 Now you might think, oh, I never breathe like that,

04:44.820 --> 04:45.980
 but you do.

04:45.980 --> 04:48.480
 Unless there's something severely wrong with your brainstem,

04:48.480 --> 04:50.000
 every five minutes or so,

04:50.000 --> 04:51.860
 you do one of these physiological sighs,

04:51.860 --> 04:54.520
 which reopens all the little hundreds of millions of sacks

04:54.520 --> 04:56.240
 in your lungs called the avioli

04:56.240 --> 04:57.580
 that bring in more oxygen

04:57.580 --> 05:00.500
 as a consequence of that big, deep double inhale.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.220
 And then you are able to exhale carbon dioxide,

05:03.220 --> 05:06.660
 offload carbon dioxide through that long exhale.

05:06.660 --> 05:09.140
 I've also encouraged people to use the physiological sigh

05:09.140 --> 05:11.280
 deliberately, not just spontaneously,

05:11.280 --> 05:13.380
 as a way to reduce their stress quickly.

05:13.380 --> 05:15.600
 And indeed my lab works on physiological sighs

05:15.600 --> 05:17.100
 and has been exploring this.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.060
 And they're quite effective in reducing

05:19.060 --> 05:20.980
 our stress very fast.

05:20.980 --> 05:23.780
 Reading on a smartphone seems to suppress

05:23.780 --> 05:24.940
 physiological sighing.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.300
 People aren't aware that it's happening, but it's happening.

05:27.300 --> 05:30.220
 Some people have talked about so-called email apnea,

05:30.220 --> 05:32.180
 which is the fact that people hold their breath

05:32.180 --> 05:34.080
 while they email or while they text,

05:34.080 --> 05:35.380
 and indeed many people do that.

05:35.380 --> 05:38.460
 This is distinct from email or texting apnea.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.900
 What's happening here is people are reading on the phone

05:40.900 --> 05:42.240
 and for whatever reason,

05:43.140 --> 05:44.580
 and I'll talk about what the likely reason is,

05:44.580 --> 05:47.620
 but for whatever reason, they're suppressing their sighing.

05:47.620 --> 05:50.980
 And as a consequence, the brain is not getting enough oxygen

05:50.980 --> 05:53.540
 and is not offloading enough carbon dioxide.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.780
 And another finding in this study

05:55.780 --> 05:57.440
 was that the prefrontal cortex,

05:57.440 --> 05:59.340
 an area of the brain that's involved in focus

05:59.340 --> 06:02.260
 and attention and learning becomes hyperactive

06:02.260 --> 06:04.840
 in a kind of desperate attempt to focus.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.180
 All of this can be summarized by saying,

06:07.180 --> 06:09.660
 if you happen to read on a device,

06:09.660 --> 06:10.680
 whether or not it's a tablet,

06:10.680 --> 06:12.960
 a standard computer screen of any kind,

06:12.960 --> 06:14.980
 but in particular on a smartphone,

06:14.980 --> 06:18.260
 regardless of how small or large that smartphone screen is,

06:18.260 --> 06:20.340
 you want to remind yourself to engage

06:20.340 --> 06:23.380
 in these physiological sighs fairly regularly.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.780
 And it might even be better to just read the most,

06:26.780 --> 06:29.720
 or at least the key issues and things

06:29.720 --> 06:31.900
 that you're trying to learn about the key information

06:31.900 --> 06:34.340
 from paper, either books or printed out material

06:34.340 --> 06:35.620
 of some other sort.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.020
 What's the underlying mechanism here?

06:37.020 --> 06:40.020
 Well, one of the reasons I like this study so much

06:40.020 --> 06:42.520
 is that it brings together two of my laboratories

06:42.520 --> 06:44.960
 and my particular interests in neuroscience,

06:44.960 --> 06:48.500
 which is how does our visual system and the aperture,

06:48.500 --> 06:51.320
 meaning the size of our visual window,

06:51.320 --> 06:53.300
 relate to our so-called autonomic function

06:53.300 --> 06:55.020
 or our internal state?

06:55.020 --> 06:56.540
 And basically what's happening here is

06:56.540 --> 07:00.820
 as any of us bring our visual window in more narrowly,

07:00.820 --> 07:02.320
 as we contract our visual window,

07:02.320 --> 07:03.580
 which is exactly what happens

07:03.580 --> 07:06.380
 when we're looking at a little smartphone in front of us,

07:06.380 --> 07:09.100
 it seems to suppress the breathing apparatus

07:09.100 --> 07:10.980
 because we know that physiological sighs

07:10.980 --> 07:12.900
 are controlled by a specific set of neurons

07:12.900 --> 07:14.700
 in the brainstem called the parafacial nucleus

07:14.700 --> 07:16.380
 discovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.

07:16.380 --> 07:18.300
 And so there must be a mechanism

07:18.300 --> 07:20.480
 whereby when we tighten our visual window,

07:20.480 --> 07:23.660
 we somehow, and we don't know yet how this happens,

07:23.660 --> 07:26.380
 but somehow suppress the activity of these neurons

07:26.380 --> 07:27.340
 in the parafacial nucleus

07:27.340 --> 07:28.980
 that generate this physiological sighs.

07:28.980 --> 07:30.940
 So again, you have two choices,

07:30.940 --> 07:32.420
 or I suppose you have many choices,

07:32.420 --> 07:35.180
 but two main choices to contend with this new information.

07:35.180 --> 07:39.240
 One is that you remind yourself to engage in deep breathing

07:39.240 --> 07:40.760
 and in particular physiological sighs

07:40.760 --> 07:41.940
 every five minutes or so

07:41.940 --> 07:45.060
 while reading anything or texting on your smartphone.

07:45.060 --> 07:46.620
 The other would be, again,

07:46.620 --> 07:49.240
 if there's material that you really need to learn

07:49.240 --> 07:51.300
 for sake of regurgitation later

07:51.300 --> 07:53.540
 or for something particularly important,

07:53.540 --> 07:56.060
 try and read that from either a larger screen

07:56.060 --> 07:58.940
 or even better would be from printed materials or books.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.380
 Another reason I bring all that up

08:00.380 --> 08:01.860
 is that it relates to a larger theme,

08:01.860 --> 08:05.300
 which is that I get many, many questions about ADHD

08:05.300 --> 08:07.580
 and about people's challenges with focus.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.340
 And much of what we're told these days

08:09.340 --> 08:11.300
 is that we are challenged with focus

08:11.300 --> 08:13.300
 because of the hundreds of videos

08:13.300 --> 08:15.900
 that we can see streaming by us in any moment on our phone,

08:15.900 --> 08:17.540
 which probably is true.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.740
 The fact that the information that we're reading

08:19.740 --> 08:21.540
 on the internet and on our phones

08:21.540 --> 08:24.700
 is emotionally disturbing or distressing in some way.

08:24.700 --> 08:27.600
 And that probably is true as well in many cases.

08:28.460 --> 08:29.880
 This study really points to the fact

08:29.880 --> 08:32.120
 that independent of the information

08:32.120 --> 08:34.220
 that we are looking at or consuming,

08:34.220 --> 08:36.300
 independent whether or not it's movies or texts

08:36.300 --> 08:37.740
 or anything of that sort,

08:37.740 --> 08:41.160
 the mere size of the window, the aperture,

08:41.160 --> 08:42.960
 the screen that we're looking at

08:42.960 --> 08:45.460
 is also strongly impacting our ability

08:45.460 --> 08:47.620
 to learn and remember information.

08:47.620 --> 08:51.000
 So broaden that visual window, print things out,

08:51.000 --> 08:52.040
 look at a book.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.460
 I didn't design the system.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.460
 I always say, you know,

08:55.460 --> 08:58.220
 however our visual system and respiratory system

08:58.220 --> 08:59.060
 happened to evolve,

08:59.060 --> 09:00.620
 I wasn't consulted at the design phase.

09:00.620 --> 09:03.220
 This is just simply how your brain circuits work.

09:03.220 --> 09:05.860
 So if you want to learn things, widen that visual window

09:05.860 --> 09:07.960
 and even better print things out,

09:07.960 --> 09:10.420
 pick up a book or read on a tablet even,

09:10.420 --> 09:12.620
 but try and make that tablet larger

09:12.620 --> 09:14.500
 than a smartphone screen size.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.580
 Before we begin our discussion about the power of play,

09:17.580 --> 09:19.260
 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

09:19.260 --> 09:22.160
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.280
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

09:24.280 --> 09:26.940
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

09:26.940 --> 09:29.700
 and science related tools to the general public.

09:29.700 --> 09:30.780
 In keeping with that theme,

09:30.780 --> 09:33.540
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

09:33.540 --> 09:37.580
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, also now called AG1.

09:37.580 --> 09:40.460
 I started drinking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.020
 And so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

09:43.020 --> 09:44.460
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

09:44.460 --> 09:46.580
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.900
 The reason I started drinking it in 2012

09:48.900 --> 09:51.680
 and the reason that I still drink it once or twice a day

09:51.680 --> 09:53.340
 is that with Athletic Greens,

09:53.340 --> 09:55.440
 I cover all of my basic foundational

09:55.440 --> 09:58.020
 vitamin mineral probiotic needs.

09:58.020 --> 10:00.160
 It's filled with adaptogens for recovery.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.140
 The probiotics are particularly important

10:02.140 --> 10:03.820
 because they encourage health of the so-called

10:03.820 --> 10:05.300
 gut microbiome.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.380
 We're going to be talking a lot about the gut microbiome

10:07.380 --> 10:09.980
 on this podcast in the weeks and months to come.

10:09.980 --> 10:12.020
 But to make a long story short,

10:12.020 --> 10:14.180
 we have a lot of bacteria living in our gut

10:14.180 --> 10:16.280
 that are healthy bacteria that support things like

10:16.280 --> 10:18.540
 digestion, immune system, metabolic function,

10:18.540 --> 10:22.380
 hormone systems, and perhaps most interestingly to me,

10:22.380 --> 10:24.620
 the gut microbiome supports brain function,

10:24.620 --> 10:27.380
 including mood, cognition, and so forth.

10:27.380 --> 10:29.660
 The probiotics and Athletic Greens strongly support

10:29.660 --> 10:32.380
 the gut microbiome and thereby the other systems

10:32.380 --> 10:34.900
 of the body, including the gut brain axis,

10:34.900 --> 10:36.300
 which I just referred to.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.820
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

10:37.820 --> 10:39.220
 again also called AG1,

10:39.220 --> 10:42.520
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

10:42.520 --> 10:43.940
 to claim a special offer.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.700
 They're giving away five free travel packs

10:45.700 --> 10:48.700
 and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

10:48.700 --> 10:51.600
 Vitamin D3 is extremely important

10:51.600 --> 10:53.620
 for many biological functions.

10:53.620 --> 10:56.060
 We are told that we can get enough D3 from sun exposure,

10:56.060 --> 10:58.500
 but many of us who are getting sun exposure

10:58.500 --> 11:00.420
 and many of us who are not getting enough sun exposure

11:00.420 --> 11:03.280
 still don't have ample levels of vitamin D3.

11:03.280 --> 11:05.340
 So supplementing with vitamin D3 is necessary

11:05.340 --> 11:06.500
 for many, many people.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.140
 And K2 is important for cardiovascular function,

11:09.140 --> 11:11.820
 for proper calcium balance, et cetera.

11:11.820 --> 11:14.580
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

11:14.580 --> 11:16.320
 you can get the five free travel packs,

11:16.320 --> 11:18.380
 the year supply vitamin D3K2,

11:18.380 --> 11:20.340
 and of course your Athletic Greens.

11:20.340 --> 11:22.940
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.740
 Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

11:24.740 --> 11:26.940
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

11:26.940 --> 11:29.820
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system.

11:29.820 --> 11:31.380
 And one of the many challenges

11:31.380 --> 11:33.940
 that your visual system has to deal with is, for instance,

11:33.940 --> 11:35.580
 when you move from a bright environment

11:35.580 --> 11:37.920
 to a dimmer environment, you have to adapt.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.500
 You have to be able to see things clearly.

11:39.500 --> 11:42.280
 Many sunglasses and eyeglasses don't allow that adaptation

11:42.280 --> 11:43.620
 to occur seamlessly.

11:43.620 --> 11:47.160
 Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses allow that to occur

11:47.160 --> 11:48.540
 in concert with your biology

11:48.540 --> 11:50.340
 and in a way that makes it very seamless.

11:50.340 --> 11:52.460
 You just don't notice the transition at all,

11:52.460 --> 11:53.380
 which is wonderful.

11:53.380 --> 11:55.300
 I love it because I don't have to constantly be taking off

11:55.300 --> 11:57.460
 and putting on my sunglasses when I'm outside.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.900
 I happen to wear readers at night, eyeglass readers.

11:59.900 --> 12:00.780
 It's also terrific

12:00.780 --> 12:03.020
 as the luminance in your environment changes.

12:03.020 --> 12:05.900
 So they work under low luminance, high luminance, et cetera.

12:05.900 --> 12:06.840
 They're very lightweight.

12:06.840 --> 12:10.220
 In fact, you can wear them when running, when cycling.

12:10.220 --> 12:12.580
 They were designed by two All-American swimmers

12:12.580 --> 12:13.400
 from Stanford.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.580
 And so originally they were designed

12:14.580 --> 12:16.960
 for the purpose of being worn during exercise,

12:16.960 --> 12:18.460
 but you can wear them anywhere.

12:18.460 --> 12:19.420
 They have a great aesthetic,

12:19.420 --> 12:21.940
 so you can wear them to dinner, to work, et cetera.

12:21.940 --> 12:24.200
 And while a lot of performance eyeglasses out there,

12:24.200 --> 12:26.260
 in my opinion, make people look like cyborgs,

12:26.260 --> 12:29.020
 Roka sunglasses and eyeglasses have just a terrific aesthetic

12:29.020 --> 12:30.820
 that you can wear truly anywhere.

12:30.820 --> 12:32.260
 If you'd like to try Roka glasses,

12:32.260 --> 12:35.580
 you can go to roka.com, that's R-O-K-A.com,

12:35.580 --> 12:39.100
 and enter the code Huberman to get 20% off your first order.

12:39.100 --> 12:41.500
 Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,

12:41.500 --> 12:43.580
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

12:43.580 --> 12:46.500
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.540
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

12:48.540 --> 12:50.060
 that are second to none.

12:50.060 --> 12:53.380
 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress about a year ago now,

12:53.380 --> 12:55.580
 and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.

12:55.580 --> 12:57.780
 What's unique about Helix mattresses

12:57.780 --> 13:00.820
 is that they tailor their mattresses to your sleep needs.

13:00.820 --> 13:02.440
 So if you go to their website,

13:02.440 --> 13:05.060
 you can take a brief two-minute quiz that asks questions

13:05.060 --> 13:06.900
 like, do you sleep on your stomach or your back

13:06.900 --> 13:07.740
 or on your side?

13:07.740 --> 13:09.700
 Maybe you don't know, do you tend to run hot or cold

13:09.700 --> 13:10.520
 throughout the night?

13:10.520 --> 13:11.360
 Or maybe you don't know.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.020
 And it matches you to the mattress

13:13.020 --> 13:14.680
 that's perfect for your sleep needs.

13:14.680 --> 13:17.900
 I matched to the so-called dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,

13:17.900 --> 13:19.900
 because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm

13:19.900 --> 13:20.740
 and not too soft.

13:20.740 --> 13:22.500
 And so I sleep on a dusk mattress.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.260
 You should figure out what mattress would be ideal for you.

13:25.260 --> 13:26.960
 If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

13:26.960 --> 13:29.820
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

13:29.820 --> 13:31.380
 take their two-minute sleep quiz

13:31.380 --> 13:33.140
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress

13:33.140 --> 13:36.740
 and you'll get up to $200 off any of your mattress orders

13:36.740 --> 13:37.740
 and two free pillows.

13:37.740 --> 13:40.680
 Again, that's $200 off and two free pillows.

13:40.680 --> 13:41.520
 The pillows are excellent.

13:41.520 --> 13:42.980
 I also use Helix pillows.

13:42.980 --> 13:44.240
 They have a 10-year warranty.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.620
 You get to try out the mattress

13:45.620 --> 13:47.220
 for up to a hundred nights risk-free.

13:47.220 --> 13:49.400
 If you don't like it, they'll come pick it up, take it away.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.820
 But I think you'll love it.

13:50.820 --> 13:53.180
 Again, if interested, you can go to helixsleep.com

13:53.180 --> 13:56.340
 slash Huberman, there you can get up to $200 off

13:56.340 --> 13:57.880
 and the two free pillows.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.940
 Let's talk about play.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.500
 Now in researching this episode,

14:01.500 --> 14:04.280
 I thought that I was going to come across a bunch of papers

14:04.280 --> 14:07.740
 that say this brain area connects to that brain area,

14:07.740 --> 14:09.660
 which controls play in animals.

14:09.660 --> 14:12.580
 And there's similar areas in babies and in adults.

14:12.580 --> 14:13.540
 And indeed that's true.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.080
 And we will talk about brain circuitry.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.540
 But I think more importantly is to understand

14:18.540 --> 14:20.580
 what is the utility of play?

14:20.580 --> 14:22.140
 You know, why do we play when we're younger?

14:22.140 --> 14:24.580
 Why do we tend to play less as we get older?

14:24.580 --> 14:27.440
 And what in the world is play for?

14:27.440 --> 14:30.520
 Some of us would be categorized as more playful.

14:30.520 --> 14:32.260
 I'm sure that you know people like this.

14:32.260 --> 14:33.100
 Maybe you are like this.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.080
 People that can walk into a room,

14:35.080 --> 14:36.500
 a social setting of any kind,

14:36.500 --> 14:39.160
 and they seem to already kind of have a playful,

14:39.160 --> 14:41.020
 maybe even a mischievous quality about them.

14:41.020 --> 14:42.820
 We'll talk about mischief a little bit later.

14:42.820 --> 14:44.880
 But they sort of look at an environment

14:44.880 --> 14:46.740
 or a social setting as an opportunity

14:46.740 --> 14:49.240
 for different kinds of novel interactions.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.020
 Other people, and I'd probably put myself

14:51.020 --> 14:52.340
 into this category,

14:52.340 --> 14:53.840
 if I walk into a novel environment,

14:53.840 --> 14:56.660
 I tend to be more in the mode of just assessing

14:56.660 --> 14:58.260
 what that environment is like.

14:58.260 --> 15:01.040
 I'm not a particularly spontaneously playful person,

15:01.040 --> 15:02.380
 although around certain individuals

15:02.380 --> 15:04.900
 I might be more spontaneously playful.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.940
 We are all on a continuum of this kind of seriousness

15:07.940 --> 15:10.140
 to playful nature.

15:10.140 --> 15:13.660
 It turns out that all young animals, including humans,

15:13.660 --> 15:15.900
 have more playfulness and tend to engage

15:15.900 --> 15:18.380
 in more spontaneous play in their earlier years

15:18.380 --> 15:20.700
 than in their later years.

15:20.700 --> 15:22.940
 And therein lies a very interesting portal

15:22.940 --> 15:25.560
 to understanding what the utility,

15:25.560 --> 15:27.580
 what the purpose of play is.

15:27.580 --> 15:30.420
 First of all, I want to lay down a couple of key facts

15:30.420 --> 15:33.080
 about play that point to the fact

15:33.080 --> 15:35.640
 that play is not just about games.

15:35.640 --> 15:38.100
 Play is about much, much more.

15:38.100 --> 15:42.220
 And play, and in particular, how we played as a child,

15:42.220 --> 15:44.540
 and still how we can play as adults

15:44.540 --> 15:48.060
 is really how we test and expand our potential roles

15:48.060 --> 15:50.680
 in all kinds of interactions.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.540
 One of the most important, interesting,

15:52.540 --> 15:54.660
 and surprising features of play

15:54.660 --> 15:56.660
 that I'd like everyone to know about

15:56.660 --> 15:59.580
 is that it is homeostatically regulated.

15:59.580 --> 16:01.620
 Some of you are familiar with the term homeostasis.

16:01.620 --> 16:05.220
 Homeostasis is just this aspect of biological systems

16:05.220 --> 16:08.020
 to try and remain in balance.

16:08.020 --> 16:09.620
 If you stay awake for a long period of time,

16:09.620 --> 16:12.620
 you tend to want to sleep for a long period of time.

16:12.620 --> 16:14.220
 If you slept for a long period of time

16:14.220 --> 16:15.060
 and you're very rested,

16:15.060 --> 16:16.780
 then you tend to be very energetic the next day.

16:16.780 --> 16:18.840
 And of course, I know people out there will immediately say,

16:18.840 --> 16:20.120
 oh, well, if I sleep too long,

16:20.120 --> 16:21.220
 then I'm groggy the next day.

16:21.220 --> 16:22.580
 Of course, there are exceptions.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.540
 But in general, sleep and wakefulness

16:25.540 --> 16:27.860
 are in homeostatic balance.

16:27.860 --> 16:31.020
 Thirst and water consumption are in homeostatic balance.

16:31.020 --> 16:32.760
 If you don't drink any fluids for a while,

16:32.760 --> 16:34.140
 you tend to get more thirsty.

16:34.140 --> 16:37.420
 You drink fluids and your thirst tends to diminish.

16:37.420 --> 16:38.620
 Likewise with food,

16:38.620 --> 16:41.540
 likewise with most all motivated behaviors.

16:41.540 --> 16:43.340
 Well, one of the most important discoveries

16:43.340 --> 16:45.740
 of the last century was largely the work

16:45.740 --> 16:47.660
 of a guy named Jak Pengsepp.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.140
 No, it's not Jack, it's Jak Pengsepp,

16:50.140 --> 16:52.280
 who really pioneered this understanding

16:52.280 --> 16:54.660
 of the biology of play and relating that

16:54.660 --> 16:57.220
 to the psychology of play in animals and humans.

16:57.220 --> 17:01.500
 He's considered a kind of luminary in the field of play.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.820
 And what a great title to have, right?

17:02.820 --> 17:04.700
 If you could have a title and be a scientific luminary,

17:04.700 --> 17:06.940
 you might as well be the play guy.

17:06.940 --> 17:08.460
 In fact, he was known,

17:08.460 --> 17:09.920
 and I'll get into this later as to why,

17:09.920 --> 17:12.140
 but he was known as the rat tickler

17:12.140 --> 17:14.500
 because he tickled rats and he actually found

17:14.500 --> 17:16.420
 that rodents and animals of many kind

17:16.420 --> 17:19.240
 generate laughter in response to tickling.

17:19.240 --> 17:21.780
 And in fact, they don't have the capacity

17:21.780 --> 17:22.620
 to tickle themselves,

17:22.620 --> 17:24.680
 something we'll also talk about why that is.

17:24.680 --> 17:26.620
 And he was called the rat tickler,

17:26.620 --> 17:29.580
 but then he discovered that many species of animals

17:29.580 --> 17:31.460
 engage in laughter in response to tickling

17:31.460 --> 17:32.880
 and they tickle each other.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.700
 And the reason you don't hear them laughing,

17:34.700 --> 17:36.300
 no, you can't hear your dog laughing,

17:36.300 --> 17:38.100
 that isn't laughing, it's something else,

17:38.100 --> 17:40.860
 is that most animals besides humans

17:40.860 --> 17:45.460
 laugh at kind of ultrasonic levels of auditory output,

17:45.460 --> 17:47.120
 meaning the frequencies of sound

17:47.120 --> 17:48.260
 are just too high for you to hear,

17:48.260 --> 17:50.140
 but with the appropriate devices,

17:50.140 --> 17:51.660
 he was able with his colleagues

17:51.660 --> 17:54.740
 to isolate the so-called rat laughter.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.400
 And then it turns out there's kitten laughter

17:56.400 --> 17:57.520
 and there's puppy laughter,

17:57.520 --> 17:59.300
 and of course there's human laughter.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.060
 So Jak Pengsup was a very interesting

18:01.060 --> 18:03.260
 and pioneering person in this field.

18:03.260 --> 18:05.100
 And he also discovered

18:05.100 --> 18:07.500
 that play is homeostatically regulated,

18:07.500 --> 18:09.860
 meaning if animals, including children,

18:09.860 --> 18:12.700
 are restricted from playing for a certain amount of time,

18:12.700 --> 18:15.180
 they will play more when given the opportunity,

18:15.180 --> 18:16.900
 in the same way that if I food restrict you

18:16.900 --> 18:17.900
 for a long period of time,

18:17.900 --> 18:21.100
 you will eat more when you are finally allowed to eat.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.620
 And this is important because it moves this thing

18:24.620 --> 18:26.740
 that we call play from the dimension

18:26.740 --> 18:30.360
 of higher order functions or things that evolved recently,

18:31.620 --> 18:34.420
 that are really kind of at the front edge

18:34.420 --> 18:36.060
 of human evolution,

18:36.060 --> 18:39.180
 deeper into the circuitry of the brain,

18:39.180 --> 18:41.900
 whereby we say the brainstem,

18:41.900 --> 18:43.860
 the kind of ancient parts of the brain

18:43.860 --> 18:44.780
 are going to be involved.

18:44.780 --> 18:46.180
 And in fact, that's the case.

18:46.180 --> 18:48.660
 As we're going to learn later in the podcast,

18:48.660 --> 18:51.620
 play is generated through the connectivity

18:51.620 --> 18:53.180
 of many brain areas,

18:53.180 --> 18:57.800
 but one of the key brain areas is an area called PAG,

18:57.800 --> 18:59.100
 periaqueductal gray.

18:59.100 --> 19:02.540
 The periaqueductal gray is a brainstem area,

19:02.540 --> 19:03.980
 so it's pretty far back

19:03.980 --> 19:06.620
 as the brain kind of transitions into the spinal cord.

19:06.620 --> 19:10.940
 And it's rich with neurons that make endogenous opioids.

19:10.940 --> 19:12.520
 So these are not the kinds of opioids

19:12.520 --> 19:14.860
 that are causing the opioid crisis.

19:14.860 --> 19:17.780
 These are neurons that you and I all have

19:17.780 --> 19:19.180
 that release endogenous,

19:19.180 --> 19:22.580
 meaning self-made or biologically made opioids.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.980
 They go by names like enkephalin and things of that sort.

19:26.900 --> 19:31.580
 Play evokes small amounts of opioid release into the system.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.380
 They kind of dope you up a little bit,

19:33.380 --> 19:36.900
 not so much as one would see if one were

19:36.900 --> 19:38.260
 to take exogenous opioids.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.160
 In fact, exogenous opioids, as we now know,

19:41.160 --> 19:43.860
 are potentially very hazardous,

19:43.860 --> 19:46.780
 highly high addiction potential, high overdose potential.

19:46.780 --> 19:48.160
 They cause all sorts of problems.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.740
 Yes, there are clinical uses for them,

19:49.740 --> 19:51.460
 but they're causing a lot of problems nowadays.

19:51.460 --> 19:53.660
 But these endogenous opioids are released

19:53.660 --> 19:57.500
 in children and adults anytime we engage in play.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.540
 And that turns out to be a very important chemical state

20:00.540 --> 20:02.860
 because there's something about having an abundance

20:02.860 --> 20:06.060
 of these endogenous opioids released into the brain

20:06.060 --> 20:07.680
 that allows other areas of the brain,

20:07.680 --> 20:09.060
 like the prefrontal cortex,

20:09.060 --> 20:10.600
 the area of the front that's responsible

20:10.600 --> 20:12.060
 for what we call executive function.

20:12.060 --> 20:14.820
 Executive function is the ability to make predictions,

20:14.820 --> 20:16.880
 to assess contingencies.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.900
 Like if I do this, then that happens.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.580
 If I do that, then that happens.

20:20.580 --> 20:22.540
 Well, prefrontal cortex is often seen

20:22.540 --> 20:25.820
 as a kind of rigid executive of the whole brain.

20:25.820 --> 20:27.140
 That's one way to view it,

20:27.140 --> 20:28.580
 but probably a better way to view it

20:28.580 --> 20:31.340
 is that the prefrontal cortex works in concert

20:31.340 --> 20:34.020
 with these other more primitive circuitries.

20:34.020 --> 20:37.660
 And when the periaqueductal gray releases

20:37.660 --> 20:40.160
 these endogenous opioids during play,

20:40.160 --> 20:42.720
 the prefrontal cortex doesn't get stupid.

20:42.720 --> 20:44.220
 It actually gets smarter.

20:44.220 --> 20:47.780
 It develops the ability to take on different roles

20:47.780 --> 20:49.840
 and explore different contingencies.

20:49.840 --> 20:51.940
 And we're going to talk about role play later

20:51.940 --> 20:52.980
 in different contexts.

20:52.980 --> 20:56.140
 And what we will find is that so much of play

20:56.140 --> 20:59.600
 is really about exploring things in a way

20:59.600 --> 21:02.780
 that feels safe enough to explore, right?

21:02.780 --> 21:04.940
 This is not what happens when we drive down the street

21:04.940 --> 21:06.460
 or when we bike down the street.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.780
 When we are headed to work commuting on our bicycle

21:08.780 --> 21:11.160
 or walking or driving, we tend to be very linear

21:11.160 --> 21:12.820
 and we tend to be very goal-directed.

21:12.820 --> 21:15.220
 We're not going to just take a new street just because.

21:15.220 --> 21:17.140
 We're not going to be spontaneously

21:17.140 --> 21:18.260
 riding in the middle of the road

21:18.260 --> 21:20.120
 and then on the sidewalk and then back and forth.

21:20.120 --> 21:21.180
 Although I can remember as a kid,

21:21.180 --> 21:22.020
 I was doing some of that.

21:22.020 --> 21:23.620
 I liked to jump off curb cuts when I was a kid

21:23.620 --> 21:26.380
 and then eventually I graduated, sorry to the cyclist,

21:26.380 --> 21:27.800
 but I graduated to skateboarding.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.820
 And then I looked on skateboarding, you're always kind

21:29.820 --> 21:31.940
 of exploring terrain, but you know, as I got older,

21:31.940 --> 21:33.860
 actually I find myself becoming much more linear.

21:33.860 --> 21:36.380
 I just don't play with my commute very much.

21:36.380 --> 21:39.560
 It's really just about getting to work and then working.

21:39.560 --> 21:41.860
 When endogenous opioids are in our system,

21:41.860 --> 21:43.680
 when we were in this mode of play,

21:44.780 --> 21:47.300
 the prefrontal cortex starts seeing

21:47.300 --> 21:50.700
 and exploring many more possibilities of how we interact

21:50.700 --> 21:52.740
 with our environment, with others,

21:52.740 --> 21:55.780
 and the roles that we can assume for ourselves.

21:55.780 --> 21:58.340
 And so we're going to dissect one by one

21:58.340 --> 22:01.540
 the different aspects of play, role play, social play,

22:01.540 --> 22:04.620
 individual play, imaginary play, competitive play.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.620
 There are enormous number of dimensions of play.

22:06.620 --> 22:08.660
 And by the end of this episode,

22:08.660 --> 22:11.120
 we're going to arrive at a very key feature.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.760
 The key feature is one that's called

22:13.760 --> 22:16.100
 your personal play identity.

22:16.100 --> 22:19.800
 All of us have what we call a personal play identity.

22:19.800 --> 22:23.180
 This personal play identity was laid down during development

22:23.180 --> 22:27.580
 and it is the identity that you assume in playful scenarios.

22:27.580 --> 22:29.880
 And it is the identity that you adopt

22:29.880 --> 22:32.060
 in non-playful scenarios.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.780
 The great news is that your personal play identity

22:34.780 --> 22:37.100
 is plastic throughout your entire lifespan.

22:37.100 --> 22:38.940
 You can adjust your personal play identity

22:38.940 --> 22:41.800
 in ways that will benefit you in work and relationships

22:41.800 --> 22:43.400
 and your overall level of happiness.

22:43.400 --> 22:45.960
 We will discuss protocols and ways to do that.

22:45.960 --> 22:49.100
 But I do want to give a nod to the late Jack,

22:49.100 --> 22:53.220
 Jack, excuse me, Jack Pangstep, the rat tickler.

22:53.220 --> 22:56.520
 And I also want to just give a nod to play generally.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.900
 As we move forward in the discussion,

22:57.900 --> 23:00.420
 what I'd love for everyone to do is to stop thinking

23:00.420 --> 23:03.140
 about play as just a child activity,

23:04.200 --> 23:07.060
 not just a sport related activity,

23:07.060 --> 23:10.600
 but really as an exploration in contingencies.

23:10.600 --> 23:15.260
 Again, it's an exploration of if I do A, what happens?

23:15.260 --> 23:16.860
 If I do B, what happens?

23:16.860 --> 23:21.340
 If someone else takes on behavior or attitude C,

23:21.340 --> 23:22.700
 what am I going to do?

23:22.700 --> 23:26.180
 And play is really where we can expand our catalog

23:26.180 --> 23:29.700
 of potential outcomes and it can be enormously enriching.

23:29.700 --> 23:33.700
 And indeed, as we'll talk about the tinkerers of the world,

23:33.700 --> 23:35.400
 the true creatives,

23:35.400 --> 23:38.660
 the people that build incredible technologies and art,

23:38.660 --> 23:40.700
 and also they just have incredibly rich,

23:40.700 --> 23:43.360
 emotional and intellectual and social lives

23:43.360 --> 23:46.100
 all have a strong element of play.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.520
 And so today I hope to convince you of some protocols

23:48.520 --> 23:51.540
 that will allow you to expand your various roles in life

23:51.540 --> 23:53.260
 through the portal of play.

23:53.260 --> 23:55.780
 So we established that play is homeostatic,

23:55.780 --> 23:57.580
 meaning we all need to do it.

23:57.580 --> 23:59.980
 Many of us, including myself,

23:59.980 --> 24:01.900
 haven't played that much as adults.

24:01.900 --> 24:03.300
 We're all pretty busy.

24:03.300 --> 24:04.300
 Number of us are stressed.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.900
 We got a lot to do in life.

24:05.900 --> 24:10.740
 But as children, most all of us engage in a lot of play.

24:10.740 --> 24:13.880
 And in looking at the way that very young children

24:13.880 --> 24:17.420
 and especially toddlers play, we can learn a lot

24:17.420 --> 24:19.940
 because it reveals the fundamental rules

24:19.940 --> 24:23.380
 by which the toddler brain interacts with the world.

24:23.380 --> 24:26.980
 Now, one of the key things about the baby brain

24:26.980 --> 24:29.760
 is that the baby brain somehow knows

24:29.760 --> 24:32.540
 that it can't do everything in the world, right?

24:32.540 --> 24:36.820
 If a baby needs something, it generally will cry

24:36.820 --> 24:38.820
 or make some sort of vocalization

24:38.820 --> 24:41.620
 or some sort of facial expression or combination of those.

24:41.620 --> 24:44.180
 And the caretaker, whoever that may be, will provide it.

24:44.180 --> 24:46.340
 This is an ancient hardwired mechanism

24:46.340 --> 24:48.240
 whereby the so-called autonomic nervous system

24:48.240 --> 24:49.460
 that generates stress

24:49.460 --> 24:51.940
 will create this kind of whining and discomfort,

24:51.940 --> 24:55.140
 maybe arriving, maybe the baby gets kind of red in the face,

24:55.140 --> 24:58.660
 and the caretaker delivers something

24:58.660 --> 25:02.420
 based on a good guess of what that baby needs.

25:02.420 --> 25:05.220
 So maybe it's breast milk, maybe it's bottled milk,

25:05.220 --> 25:06.740
 maybe it's a diaper change,

25:06.740 --> 25:09.180
 maybe it's to be warmed up if the baby is cold,

25:09.180 --> 25:11.460
 maybe it's to be cooled down if the baby is too warm,

25:11.460 --> 25:13.540
 maybe if the baby's in its little onesie thing,

25:13.540 --> 25:15.420
 it's feeling restricted and just wants to move

25:15.420 --> 25:18.760
 and they'll get taken out of their crib or their stroller,

25:18.760 --> 25:21.260
 whatever it is, and allowed to stretch out on the floor.

25:21.260 --> 25:23.420
 Remember, the baby doesn't know exactly what it needs,

25:23.420 --> 25:25.900
 it only knows the state of discomfort.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.460
 And of course, we don't know exactly

25:27.460 --> 25:29.420
 what babies and toddlers are thinking

25:29.420 --> 25:32.300
 because they can't express themselves with language yet.

25:32.300 --> 25:34.460
 But what's key to understand is the rule

25:34.460 --> 25:37.100
 or the contingency that is set up in that scenario.

25:37.100 --> 25:42.100
 In that scenario, the child feels some discomfort,

25:42.300 --> 25:44.240
 expresses that discomfort verbally

25:44.240 --> 25:46.420
 or through a facial expression or both,

25:46.420 --> 25:48.300
 and then some force,

25:48.300 --> 25:51.980
 some person from the outside world resolves it.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.300
 And so the very young baby,

25:54.300 --> 25:56.540
 and indeed many children up to certain ages,

25:56.540 --> 25:59.260
 and let's confess, many adults,

25:59.260 --> 26:01.460
 are not able to meet or adjust

26:01.460 --> 26:02.940
 their internal states of stress,

26:02.940 --> 26:04.660
 and so they look to things outside of them.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.140
 That's the first rule, the fundamental rule

26:07.140 --> 26:09.120
 that we all learn when we come into life,

26:09.120 --> 26:11.420
 that when in a state of discomfort,

26:11.420 --> 26:14.860
 to look outside our immediate biology,

26:14.860 --> 26:17.920
 beyond the confines of our skin and find a solution,

26:17.920 --> 26:18.760
 a sip of water.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.500
 For adults, it might be a sip of alcohol, right?

26:21.500 --> 26:23.500
 Probably not the best tool to relieve stress,

26:23.500 --> 26:25.980
 but that's one that many people do, in fact, engage in.

26:25.980 --> 26:27.060
 For the baby that's hungry,

26:27.060 --> 26:28.740
 the bottle milk comes from the outside.

26:28.740 --> 26:31.100
 As we gain more proficiency in moving through life

26:31.100 --> 26:32.920
 and we can get things for ourselves,

26:32.920 --> 26:35.740
 we still often bring things from the external world in

26:35.740 --> 26:40.020
 to resolve this, what I'm calling autonomic discomfort

26:40.020 --> 26:42.780
 or autonomic dysregulation.

26:43.940 --> 26:47.140
 That's not a game, but that's a rule.

26:47.140 --> 26:50.300
 As we advance from infant to toddler,

26:50.300 --> 26:53.940
 we start to think more in terms of where we are

26:53.940 --> 26:58.020
 and what we own relative to what's out there in the world.

26:58.020 --> 27:00.700
 And now in the world of child psychology,

27:00.700 --> 27:02.620
 there's a somewhat famous poem

27:02.620 --> 27:05.760
 that was written by a research child psychologist.

27:05.760 --> 27:07.200
 His name was Burton White,

27:07.200 --> 27:09.900
 and he wrote a poem called The Toddler's Creed.

27:09.900 --> 27:11.940
 The Toddler's Creed defines well

27:11.940 --> 27:15.460
 what the rules and contingencies of play are

27:15.460 --> 27:16.720
 in very young children.

27:16.720 --> 27:19.540
 And it reveals to us just how narrow

27:19.540 --> 27:22.080
 and limited their worldview is

27:22.080 --> 27:24.860
 and how self-centered their world is.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.820
 So The Toddler's Creed, read quickly,

27:26.820 --> 27:28.220
 because I don't want to take up too much time with this,

27:28.220 --> 27:30.700
 is if I want it, it's mine.

27:30.700 --> 27:33.860
 If I give it to you and change my mind later, it's mine.

27:33.860 --> 27:35.180
 For anyone that's played with a toddler,

27:35.180 --> 27:36.760
 you can imagine this in your mind.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.440
 If I can take it away from you, it's mine.

27:39.440 --> 27:42.420
 If I had a little while ago, it's mine.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.320
 If we are building something together,

27:44.320 --> 27:46.060
 all the pieces are mine.

27:46.060 --> 27:48.700
 If it looks just like mine, it's mine.

27:48.700 --> 27:51.100
 If it's mine, it will never belong to anyone else,

27:51.100 --> 27:52.900
 no matter what.

27:52.900 --> 27:55.380
 And of course, as we hear this,

27:55.380 --> 27:56.700
 it sounds quite awful, right?

27:56.700 --> 27:58.740
 And yet this is actually a reflection

27:58.740 --> 28:01.860
 of what a healthy toddler would think about the world,

28:01.860 --> 28:03.260
 that the objects and things,

28:03.260 --> 28:06.160
 and even the people in the world are theirs,

28:06.160 --> 28:08.500
 that they are actually possessions that belong to them.

28:08.500 --> 28:10.900
 And of course, some people never actually transitioned

28:10.900 --> 28:14.300
 beyond this stage of moral and social development.

28:14.300 --> 28:16.660
 And there are indeed some adults

28:16.660 --> 28:18.100
 that fit The Toddler's Creed.

28:18.100 --> 28:20.460
 And you're welcome to share this with them

28:20.460 --> 28:22.260
 if ever you think that it might be of benefit

28:22.260 --> 28:24.140
 to their self-reflection.

28:24.140 --> 28:28.660
 But in all seriousness, Burton White's Toddler's Creed

28:28.660 --> 28:31.400
 is really grounded in this transition

28:31.400 --> 28:32.480
 from when we are infants

28:32.480 --> 28:34.720
 and we have to have things delivered to us,

28:34.720 --> 28:36.380
 to the point where we are toddlers

28:36.380 --> 28:38.500
 and we can access things in the world,

28:38.500 --> 28:40.820
 but we tend to assume that they are all ours.

28:40.820 --> 28:43.920
 And then the next stage is the really key stage

28:43.920 --> 28:44.840
 as it relates to play.

28:44.840 --> 28:47.420
 Because in the next stage of development

28:47.420 --> 28:48.900
 is where young children

28:48.900 --> 28:50.780
 start to interact with other children,

28:50.780 --> 28:53.300
 and there's an exchange and a possession

28:53.300 --> 28:55.740
 and then a letting go of certain things.

28:55.740 --> 28:58.060
 Learning that not everything is yours

28:58.060 --> 29:00.140
 and that the entire world is not about you

29:00.140 --> 29:01.960
 is one of the key contingencies

29:01.960 --> 29:04.620
 that is established during play.

29:04.620 --> 29:07.180
 It's one of the key ways in which children go

29:07.180 --> 29:08.980
 from being very self-centered

29:08.980 --> 29:12.140
 and basically unable to engage with other kids for very long

29:12.140 --> 29:14.040
 without some sort of eruption of crying

29:14.040 --> 29:18.260
 and some sort of battle of kind of push-pull over an object

29:18.260 --> 29:21.520
 to things like sharing and things like cooperative play.

29:21.520 --> 29:23.680
 So as we transition from forms of play

29:23.680 --> 29:25.100
 that are all about the self,

29:25.100 --> 29:27.800
 that are all me, me, me, me, me, The Toddler's Creed,

29:27.800 --> 29:31.220
 to forms of play that involve some discomfort

29:31.220 --> 29:33.260
 in assuming roles that maybe we don't want

29:33.260 --> 29:35.420
 and not getting what we want,

29:35.420 --> 29:37.940
 it's really an opportunity for the brain

29:37.940 --> 29:41.340
 to start to explore different roles that people take,

29:41.340 --> 29:43.620
 how they work as individuals and as pairs

29:43.620 --> 29:45.300
 and in larger groups.

29:45.300 --> 29:49.260
 And to do that in a low stakes environment, right?

29:49.260 --> 29:52.340
 You wouldn't want this to be worked out on the battlefield

29:52.340 --> 29:53.860
 or when searching for food

29:53.860 --> 29:55.840
 or in some high stakes environment

29:55.840 --> 29:59.120
 where the survival of the species was important.

29:59.120 --> 30:01.880
 It appears that these circuitries for play evolved

30:01.880 --> 30:06.420
 so that rules and contingencies around who's most important,

30:06.420 --> 30:07.780
 whether or not the group is important,

30:07.780 --> 30:09.840
 whether or not individuals are going to be leaders

30:09.840 --> 30:11.220
 or followers, et cetera,

30:11.220 --> 30:13.700
 that can be explored in a low stakes environment.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.820
 Now, there are hundreds of different types of play

30:15.820 --> 30:18.580
 and hundreds of different types of contingency testing,

30:18.580 --> 30:23.380
 but the key theme here is that play allows children

30:23.380 --> 30:26.780
 and adults for that matter to explore different outcomes

30:26.780 --> 30:28.540
 in a kind of low stakes environment.

30:28.540 --> 30:30.700
 If you're playing a board game or a card game,

30:30.700 --> 30:32.340
 you might get really into that game,

30:32.340 --> 30:34.540
 but unless there's a lot of money on the table, so to speak,

30:34.540 --> 30:36.620
 or you're really playing for something important,

30:36.620 --> 30:38.100
 or unless your ego is swollen

30:38.100 --> 30:40.180
 way out of proportion to reality,

30:40.180 --> 30:42.420
 if you lose, you might not feel good about it,

30:42.420 --> 30:44.040
 but it's truly not the end of the world.

30:44.040 --> 30:46.420
 And if you win, you might feel really good about it,

30:46.420 --> 30:48.200
 but you're not really incredible.

30:48.200 --> 30:51.060
 You were just incredible in that particular situation

30:51.060 --> 30:52.200
 for that particular moment.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.840
 It doesn't really transform the rest of your life

30:54.840 --> 30:56.860
 unless that game is of a particular type,

30:56.860 --> 31:00.500
 for sport, for instance, and we'll talk about sport later.

31:00.500 --> 31:04.700
 So the key theme here is that play is contingency testing.

31:04.700 --> 31:07.540
 Play is contingency testing under conditions

31:07.540 --> 31:10.420
 where the stakes are sufficiently low

31:10.420 --> 31:12.500
 that individuals should feel comfortable

31:12.500 --> 31:13.620
 assuming different roles,

31:13.620 --> 31:16.820
 even roles that they're not entirely comfortable with

31:16.820 --> 31:18.540
 in their outside life.

31:18.540 --> 31:20.140
 And that all relates again

31:20.140 --> 31:22.380
 to the release of these endogenous opioids

31:22.380 --> 31:24.460
 in this brain center, periaqueductal gray,

31:24.460 --> 31:26.940
 and the way that it allows the prefrontal cortex

31:26.940 --> 31:27.780
 in a very direct way.

31:27.780 --> 31:30.700
 I mean, truly, it allows it in a biological way

31:30.700 --> 31:34.580
 to expand the number of operations that it can run

31:34.580 --> 31:37.500
 and start thinking about, oh, well, okay,

31:37.500 --> 31:40.900
 normally I'm kind of a loner and I like to read and work

31:40.900 --> 31:43.100
 and hang out alone, maybe even play alone,

31:43.100 --> 31:46.220
 but, oh, okay, I'll play a board game or a game of tennis

31:46.220 --> 31:47.940
 where I have a partner and we're going to play as partners

31:47.940 --> 31:49.040
 against two other people.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.780
 Okay, that's a little uncomfortable, but I'll do it.

31:51.780 --> 31:53.980
 And in doing that, you discover certain ways

31:53.980 --> 31:55.220
 in which you are proficient

31:55.220 --> 31:57.540
 and certain ways in which you are less proficient.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.060
 You discover that the other person

31:59.060 --> 32:01.980
 actually tends to cheat a little bit

32:01.980 --> 32:05.100
 or the other person is extremely rigid about the rules

32:05.100 --> 32:06.600
 or maybe it is extremely rigid

32:06.600 --> 32:09.100
 about the way they organize their pieces on the board

32:09.100 --> 32:10.240
 or you're crossing the line

32:10.240 --> 32:11.720
 into your side of the tennis court.

32:11.720 --> 32:13.500
 There are all sorts of things that we learn

32:13.500 --> 32:15.660
 in these rather low stakes scenarios.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.300
 That's the key theme here.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.540
 So before I continue, I just want to point to a tool

32:20.540 --> 32:21.620
 that anyone can use,

32:21.620 --> 32:24.820
 but in particular, the less playful of the group.

32:24.820 --> 32:27.360
 And I would put myself into this category.

32:27.360 --> 32:28.220
 Yeah, and I'm not somebody

32:28.220 --> 32:30.460
 who really engages in spontaneous play.

32:31.380 --> 32:33.580
 I enjoy sports, I enjoy exercise,

32:33.580 --> 32:34.960
 but that is distinct from play

32:34.960 --> 32:37.020
 because the sports and exercise that I engage in,

32:37.020 --> 32:38.100
 I take pretty seriously.

32:38.100 --> 32:40.260
 They're not low stakes for me.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.940
 Actually, I put a lot of importance on them.

32:41.940 --> 32:42.780
 Actually, as I'm saying all this,

32:42.780 --> 32:44.500
 I probably should put a little less importance on them

32:44.500 --> 32:46.220
 and have a little more fun with those.

32:46.220 --> 32:50.820
 And yet, what I'm about to tell you is that anyone

32:50.820 --> 32:53.340
 and everyone can benefit from engaging

32:53.340 --> 32:56.500
 in a bit more of this playful mindset.

32:56.500 --> 32:59.300
 The playful mindset is not necessarily about smiling

32:59.300 --> 33:01.900
 and jumping around or being silly.

33:01.900 --> 33:02.740
 That's not it at all.

33:02.740 --> 33:05.380
 It's not the Tigger character from Winnie the Pooh,

33:05.380 --> 33:07.340
 necessarily, it could be,

33:07.340 --> 33:10.880
 but it's really about allowing yourself

33:10.880 --> 33:14.060
 to expand the number of outcomes

33:14.060 --> 33:15.420
 that you're willing to entertain

33:15.420 --> 33:16.540
 and to think about how you relate

33:16.540 --> 33:17.920
 to those different outcomes.

33:17.920 --> 33:20.660
 So what this means is putting yourself into scenarios

33:20.660 --> 33:23.980
 where you might not be the top performer, right?

33:23.980 --> 33:26.100
 Playing a game that you're not really that good at.

33:26.100 --> 33:27.940
 I had this experience recently,

33:27.940 --> 33:29.180
 friends that like to play cards,

33:29.180 --> 33:30.940
 they like to do some low stakes gambling.

33:30.940 --> 33:32.380
 This is not an illegal gambling ring,

33:32.380 --> 33:34.180
 they play for trivial things.

33:34.180 --> 33:38.180
 And I generally don't buy into the game.

33:38.180 --> 33:39.580
 I generally don't play,

33:39.580 --> 33:41.200
 mostly because they end up winning

33:41.200 --> 33:43.660
 and taking whatever it is that I have.

33:43.660 --> 33:47.180
 But in the mode of assuming a more playful spirit,

33:47.180 --> 33:48.020
 the idea would be,

33:48.020 --> 33:50.480
 well, if the stakes are low enough,

33:50.480 --> 33:52.780
 then to play simply for the sake of playing,

33:52.780 --> 33:54.260
 because there's something to learn there

33:54.260 --> 33:57.260
 about the other people in the group and about oneself

33:57.260 --> 34:00.180
 and how one reacts to things like

34:00.180 --> 34:03.420
 someone who's clearly trying to take everybody's money

34:03.420 --> 34:07.840
 or somebody who is clearly trying to cheat

34:07.840 --> 34:10.460
 or somebody who's clearly very, very rigid

34:10.460 --> 34:11.700
 about every last detail,

34:11.700 --> 34:14.520
 including how the cards are dealt and shuffled, right?

34:14.520 --> 34:16.820
 There is learning in this exploration.

34:16.820 --> 34:19.620
 And that is at a biological level,

34:19.620 --> 34:20.820
 the prefrontal cortex

34:20.820 --> 34:23.380
 starting to entertain different possibilities,

34:23.380 --> 34:25.020
 starting to entertain different outcomes

34:25.020 --> 34:26.260
 in this low stakes way.

34:26.260 --> 34:27.660
 And if you think about it,

34:27.660 --> 34:29.840
 that's not something that we allow ourselves

34:29.840 --> 34:31.720
 to do very often.

34:31.720 --> 34:33.660
 Even if we listen to new forms of music

34:33.660 --> 34:36.300
 or we go see new art or new movies,

34:36.300 --> 34:37.500
 those are new experiences,

34:37.500 --> 34:39.820
 but that's not us making new predictions

34:39.820 --> 34:41.220
 about what's going to happen next.

34:41.220 --> 34:45.020
 It's not the brain working to figure out new possibilities.

34:45.020 --> 34:46.740
 And so you can immediately see how

34:46.740 --> 34:50.020
 just a small increase in your willingness

34:50.020 --> 34:51.580
 to put yourself into conditions

34:51.580 --> 34:53.460
 where you don't understand all the rules, perhaps,

34:53.460 --> 34:56.300
 or you're not super proficient at something,

34:56.300 --> 34:59.340
 but you enter it because it is low stakes.

34:59.340 --> 35:00.740
 And because there is information

35:00.740 --> 35:02.260
 to learn about yourself and others

35:02.260 --> 35:05.260
 could start to open up these prefrontal cortex circuits.

35:05.260 --> 35:06.500
 And when I say open up,

35:06.500 --> 35:07.660
 I don't mean that literally

35:07.660 --> 35:08.780
 there's an opening in your skull.

35:08.780 --> 35:11.980
 What I mean is that your prefrontal cortex

35:11.980 --> 35:13.520
 can work in very rigid ways.

35:13.520 --> 35:15.060
 Meaning if A, then B.

35:15.060 --> 35:16.180
 If I go down this street,

35:16.180 --> 35:18.620
 turn left and go that way to work, it is fast.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.100
 If I go down the other street, it's slow.

35:20.100 --> 35:22.320
 If there's a traffic jam there, I'm going to go there,

35:22.320 --> 35:24.600
 but it's starting to explore different possibilities.

35:24.600 --> 35:28.300
 And there are very, very few opportunities in life

35:28.300 --> 35:31.280
 to explore contingencies in this low stakes way,

35:31.280 --> 35:33.260
 such that it engages neuroplasticity

35:33.260 --> 35:34.740
 of the prefrontal cortex.

35:34.740 --> 35:38.900
 So play is powerful at making your prefrontal cortex

35:38.900 --> 35:42.240
 more plastic, more able to change in response to experience,

35:42.240 --> 35:45.020
 but not just during the period of play,

35:45.020 --> 35:46.360
 but in all scenarios,

35:46.360 --> 35:47.860
 because you get one prefrontal cortex.

35:47.860 --> 35:50.100
 You don't get a prefrontal cortex just for play.

35:50.100 --> 35:53.300
 You get a prefrontal cortex that engages in everything.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.140
 So going forward,

35:54.140 --> 35:58.180
 I will layer on some more concrete aspects of tools.

35:58.180 --> 35:59.000
 But for now,

35:59.000 --> 36:00.500
 if you're somebody that doesn't consider yourself

36:00.500 --> 36:02.500
 particularly playful, consider,

36:02.500 --> 36:05.820
 and maybe even engage in just a little bit of play

36:05.820 --> 36:08.780
 in some way that is of discomfort to you

36:08.780 --> 36:09.860
 with the understanding

36:09.860 --> 36:13.500
 that is increasing your prefrontal cortical plasticity.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.960
 Another really interesting and important aspect of play

36:16.960 --> 36:19.180
 is so-called play postures.

36:19.180 --> 36:22.220
 These are seen in animals and these are seen in humans.

36:22.220 --> 36:24.440
 And for those of you that are watching this podcast

36:24.440 --> 36:27.400
 on YouTube, I'll do my best to adopt them here.

36:27.400 --> 36:28.380
 For those of you that are listening,

36:28.380 --> 36:31.120
 you'll just have to imagine them in your mind's eye.

36:31.120 --> 36:35.020
 But Jaak Pangsepp and indeed Darwin himself

36:35.020 --> 36:38.380
 studied these play postures that all animals engage in.

36:39.580 --> 36:44.320
 Perhaps the most familiar one is seen in dogs and in wolves

36:44.320 --> 36:46.380
 where they will lower their head to the ground

36:46.380 --> 36:47.960
 and they'll put their paws out in front of them

36:47.960 --> 36:49.780
 and they will make eye contact

36:49.780 --> 36:53.040
 with another typically dog or wolf

36:53.040 --> 36:55.340
 to so-called call the play.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.300
 Now, when they do this posture,

36:57.300 --> 36:59.040
 it's obvious that they're lowering themselves.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.620
 They're not in an aggressive stance

37:01.620 --> 37:03.220
 because they're lowering their head.

37:03.220 --> 37:07.140
 And this is universally known among canines as play posture.

37:07.140 --> 37:08.400
 There's some famous videos online.

37:08.400 --> 37:11.980
 You can look these up of dogs actually doing this with bears

37:11.980 --> 37:13.300
 that they're confronted with.

37:13.300 --> 37:16.520
 And the bears, at least in these videos,

37:16.520 --> 37:18.700
 in exchange also lowering their head

37:18.700 --> 37:22.860
 and there you see bear dog playful interactions.

37:22.860 --> 37:25.780
 Now, you always have to be cautious with bears in general.

37:25.780 --> 37:27.780
 I would say you have to be cautious with bears.

37:27.780 --> 37:31.980
 But this speaks to the universality of this bowing,

37:31.980 --> 37:34.140
 this sort of what some people call the puppy bow

37:34.140 --> 37:36.100
 or the play bow that dogs do.

37:36.100 --> 37:37.900
 It turns out that humans do this as well,

37:37.900 --> 37:39.180
 although in a different form,

37:39.180 --> 37:40.180
 I'm sure there are some that go

37:40.180 --> 37:42.100
 into the down dog play posture,

37:42.100 --> 37:45.180
 but more typically when humans want to play,

37:45.180 --> 37:48.900
 they will do a subtle or not so subtle head tilt.

37:48.900 --> 37:51.460
 The head tilt with eyes open is considered

37:51.460 --> 37:54.660
 the universal head and facial expression posture

37:54.660 --> 37:55.960
 of play in humans.

37:55.960 --> 37:57.660
 So when two people see one another,

37:57.660 --> 38:00.380
 if they are aggressive towards one another,

38:00.380 --> 38:03.020
 they will assume certain facial expressions and postures.

38:03.020 --> 38:04.860
 But if they're feeling playful towards one another,

38:04.860 --> 38:06.460
 oftentimes they'll tip their head to the side

38:06.460 --> 38:08.200
 just a little bit and they'll open their eyes.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.480
 They might even raise their eyebrows briefly.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.680
 This has been seen again and again and again.

38:12.680 --> 38:16.580
 Another hardwired feature of so-called play postures

38:16.580 --> 38:18.660
 is what's called soft eyes.

38:18.660 --> 38:22.060
 When animals are aggressive or when they're sad,

38:22.060 --> 38:24.860
 they tend to reduce the size of their eye openings

38:24.860 --> 38:28.700
 by basically making their eyelids closer together somewhat,

38:28.700 --> 38:29.660
 but keeping their eyes together.

38:29.660 --> 38:30.760
 In particular for aggression,

38:30.760 --> 38:31.920
 they'll bring their eyes towards

38:31.920 --> 38:33.320
 what we call a vergence eye movement,

38:33.320 --> 38:34.460
 bringing it towards the center

38:34.460 --> 38:37.260
 that actually narrows the aperture of the visual field.

38:38.780 --> 38:41.280
 When people or animals want to engage in play,

38:41.280 --> 38:43.620
 they tend to open their eyelids somewhat

38:43.620 --> 38:45.860
 and they tend to purse their lips just a little bit.

38:45.860 --> 38:48.060
 So it's not like throwing your lips like this,

38:48.060 --> 38:49.220
 it's pursing their lips,

38:49.220 --> 38:50.260
 they'll open their eyes a little bit

38:50.260 --> 38:51.860
 and they'll often do the head tilt as well,

38:51.860 --> 38:53.660
 sometimes with a little bit of a smile.

38:53.660 --> 38:56.140
 These are reflexive, these are not trained up.

38:56.140 --> 39:00.440
 Children do this, adults do this, dogs, wolves do this,

39:00.440 --> 39:02.420
 even certain birds will do this.

39:02.420 --> 39:04.060
 Most birds have eyes on the side of their heads,

39:04.060 --> 39:06.660
 but they do a sort of form of this soft eyes approach.

39:06.660 --> 39:09.160
 And certainly in raptors, you see a softening of the eyes

39:09.160 --> 39:11.620
 and indeed raptors like hawks and eagles,

39:11.620 --> 39:13.580
 they actually do have a certain form of play,

39:13.580 --> 39:15.020
 but only early in life.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.780
 The other thing that we see during play

39:17.780 --> 39:19.700
 are what are called partial postures.

39:19.700 --> 39:23.460
 Partial postures are a kind of play enactment

39:23.460 --> 39:26.140
 of postures that would otherwise be threatening.

39:26.140 --> 39:29.780
 So a partial posture that we see during play

39:29.780 --> 39:32.900
 in animals and humans that relates to aggressive play,

39:32.900 --> 39:35.220
 so things like wrestling or things like rough

39:35.220 --> 39:37.300
 and tumble play, which is very common in animals

39:37.300 --> 39:39.540
 and kids and some adults,

39:39.540 --> 39:43.480
 is that because there's going to be a physical interaction,

39:43.480 --> 39:46.780
 in animals what will happen is they will march

39:46.780 --> 39:48.660
 toward one another often very slowly,

39:48.660 --> 39:51.300
 but rather than having their hair up,

39:51.300 --> 39:53.100
 which we call pyloerection,

39:53.100 --> 39:54.180
 which is when the hair goes up,

39:54.180 --> 39:55.800
 animals do this to make themselves look bigger.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.140
 Think about the cat that's trying to look bigger

39:58.140 --> 39:59.340
 or an animal that's being aggressive,

39:59.340 --> 40:04.340
 trying to look bigger in the presence of a foe,

40:04.560 --> 40:06.440
 a different animal that they're either going to try

40:06.440 --> 40:08.080
 and kill or fight in some way,

40:08.080 --> 40:10.060
 even if it's to defend themselves.

40:10.060 --> 40:12.920
 Partial postures occur when animals will approach

40:12.920 --> 40:15.500
 one another, but they'll keep their fur down.

40:15.500 --> 40:16.980
 Humans will do this too.

40:16.980 --> 40:19.060
 They were approached during play,

40:19.060 --> 40:21.100
 but unless it's highly competitive play,

40:21.100 --> 40:23.840
 like a football game or a boxing match,

40:23.840 --> 40:26.340
 they will actually shrink their body size somewhat.

40:26.340 --> 40:30.140
 We have hair on our bodies, some of us more than others,

40:30.140 --> 40:33.240
 and that hair is capable of pyloerection.

40:33.240 --> 40:34.080
 It can stand up.

40:34.080 --> 40:36.920
 That's the hair standing up on end phenomenon,

40:36.920 --> 40:39.600
 but most of us don't have enough hair on our bodies

40:39.600 --> 40:42.700
 that we can actually use that to make ourselves larger.

40:42.700 --> 40:46.040
 So what you see with people who are about to engage in play

40:46.040 --> 40:48.660
 is they tend to make their body a little bit smaller

40:48.660 --> 40:50.580
 unless they are highly competitive

40:50.580 --> 40:53.440
 and highly competitive play is its own distinct form of play

40:53.440 --> 40:55.580
 that we'll talk about later, such as during sport,

40:55.580 --> 40:56.940
 when the stakes are high.

40:56.940 --> 40:59.840
 A Super Bowl football game,

40:59.840 --> 41:01.940
 I'm revealing my ignorance about sports here.

41:01.940 --> 41:04.700
 The Super Bowl, as it's typically called,

41:04.700 --> 41:07.020
 is a very high stakes game, right?

41:07.020 --> 41:09.500
 Salaries depend on it, sponsorships depend on it,

41:09.500 --> 41:13.340
 it's on television, reputations depend on it.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.580
 So that's not really playing a game.

41:15.580 --> 41:17.540
 That's playing a very high stakes game

41:17.540 --> 41:20.180
 and there you're not going to see these partial postures.

41:20.180 --> 41:23.060
 You're not going to see soft eyes and tilting of the head,

41:23.060 --> 41:25.300
 at least not between the opposing players on the team.

41:25.300 --> 41:26.820
 You're going to see quite the opposite,

41:26.820 --> 41:30.340
 grunting, screaming, shouldering, people not blinking,

41:30.340 --> 41:33.940
 lowering their eyes or rather shrinking their eyes down

41:33.940 --> 41:36.340
 to appear more aggressive, these kinds of things,

41:36.340 --> 41:38.260
 staring right through the other person,

41:38.260 --> 41:39.460
 verbal threats, et cetera.

41:39.460 --> 41:41.100
 So that's not really play,

41:41.100 --> 41:43.260
 even though we say they're playing a game of football,

41:43.260 --> 41:45.640
 it's very high stakes play.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.780
 What I'm referring to here is when it's fairly low stakes

41:48.780 --> 41:50.620
 and we see this again in animals and humans.

41:50.620 --> 41:52.460
 So there are many, many of these partial postures.

41:52.460 --> 41:54.660
 Again, they happen spontaneously.

41:54.660 --> 41:56.060
 So if someone ever looks at you

41:56.060 --> 41:57.300
 and they tilt their head a little bit

41:57.300 --> 41:58.540
 and they raise their eyebrows

41:58.540 --> 41:59.900
 and they maybe smile a little bit,

41:59.900 --> 42:01.580
 they're looking at you playfully.

42:01.580 --> 42:05.820
 That's the universal human exchange of, I want to play.

42:05.820 --> 42:07.020
 Do you want to play?

42:07.020 --> 42:08.780
 There's another play expression

42:08.780 --> 42:11.340
 that is considered the most extreme of the,

42:11.340 --> 42:13.980
 come on, let's play expressions and postures.

42:13.980 --> 42:15.860
 And this is one that's seen in a lot of primates

42:15.860 --> 42:17.740
 and indeed in some humans as well.

42:17.740 --> 42:19.860
 And that's the eyes wide open

42:19.860 --> 42:21.700
 and believe it or not, tongue out.

42:21.700 --> 42:24.580
 It's that kind of silly thing.

42:24.580 --> 42:26.860
 That's not, I don't think that I've ever done that before.

42:26.860 --> 42:29.900
 Just that kind of thing is basically

42:30.820 --> 42:32.700
 what primate species of all kinds,

42:32.700 --> 42:35.720
 and indeed we are old world primates as well,

42:35.720 --> 42:39.420
 do when they want to say, I'm definitely here to play

42:39.420 --> 42:40.900
 and that's why I'm here.

42:40.900 --> 42:43.900
 Okay, it has this kind of silly look or connotation,

42:43.900 --> 42:45.840
 but if you watch chimpanzees

42:45.840 --> 42:47.780
 or you look at bonobos

42:47.780 --> 42:49.860
 or even in the so-called new world monkeys,

42:49.860 --> 42:51.860
 which tend to be the smaller monkeys,

42:51.860 --> 42:55.340
 old world monkeys tend to be the ones that in general

42:55.340 --> 42:56.680
 see the world as we do.

42:56.680 --> 42:58.720
 They have what we call trichromacy.

42:58.720 --> 43:00.820
 They're the ones that often can look very human-like.

43:00.820 --> 43:02.860
 The new world monkeys tend to be the little ones.

43:02.860 --> 43:04.660
 In general, I'll give you a little trick here,

43:04.660 --> 43:07.000
 a little tool based on primatology.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.980
 If you see a monkey and it's making very slow movements

43:09.980 --> 43:11.100
 or you see an ape of any kind

43:11.100 --> 43:12.140
 it's making very slow movements,

43:12.140 --> 43:14.740
 very likely to be an old world primate.

43:14.740 --> 43:19.500
 If you see a monkey and it's making very quick movements,

43:19.500 --> 43:20.680
 like it's doing this kind of thing,

43:20.680 --> 43:23.300
 like it's like a, could be a squirrel monkey,

43:23.300 --> 43:25.980
 could be a marmoset, likely to be a new world monkey.

43:25.980 --> 43:27.900
 And they don't see the world the same way we do.

43:27.900 --> 43:29.220
 They see the world more like a dog.

43:29.220 --> 43:30.260
 They don't really see reds.

43:30.260 --> 43:32.620
 They see reds as orange, et cetera.

43:32.620 --> 43:34.040
 Okay, that's not a hard and fast rule

43:34.040 --> 43:36.780
 and I'm sure the primatologists are going to come after me

43:36.780 --> 43:38.660
 with whatever primatologists come after you

43:38.660 --> 43:40.220
 with monkey biscuits or something like that.

43:40.220 --> 43:42.260
 But in general, it's a good rule if you're at the zoo

43:42.260 --> 43:45.620
 and you see a slow moving monkey with slow deliberate

43:45.620 --> 43:47.120
 gestures kind of moves its eyes,

43:47.120 --> 43:48.700
 makes eye contact every once in a while,

43:48.700 --> 43:50.060
 those tend to be the old world primates.

43:50.060 --> 43:51.740
 Those kind of jittery ones that look like

43:51.740 --> 43:53.060
 they're really nervous, wrapping their tail

43:53.060 --> 43:54.780
 and kind of hiding there in a little bundle.

43:54.780 --> 43:56.940
 Those tend to be the new world monkeys.

43:56.940 --> 44:00.540
 Okay, again, not a black and white type division,

44:00.540 --> 44:02.520
 but that'll get you most of the way.

44:03.960 --> 44:06.300
 So the whole purpose of these partial postures

44:06.300 --> 44:11.300
 or the tongue out thing is to limit power in deliberate ways

44:11.300 --> 44:16.020
 to really take bodily expressions that could be portrayed

44:16.020 --> 44:19.980
 or could be interpreted as aggressive

44:19.980 --> 44:23.340
 or as threatening or as wanting to mate

44:23.340 --> 44:25.980
 or as wanting to do anything for that matter

44:25.980 --> 44:29.180
 and to limit the power with which they are expressed

44:29.180 --> 44:30.340
 in very deliberate ways.

44:30.340 --> 44:32.380
 So that's the putting the hair down

44:32.380 --> 44:34.460
 despite getting into a fighting stance.

44:34.460 --> 44:35.520
 That's saying let's fight,

44:35.520 --> 44:37.180
 but I'm not really here to fight fight.

44:37.180 --> 44:38.540
 It's low stakes fighting.

44:38.540 --> 44:40.680
 Like if I pin you, then I'll let you go.

44:40.680 --> 44:42.940
 Or if you pin me, then you ought to let me go.

44:42.940 --> 44:46.220
 And so immediately you can start to see how play

44:46.220 --> 44:51.000
 starts to call into action social dynamics

44:51.000 --> 44:53.980
 in which both parties have to make some sort of agreement

44:53.980 --> 44:56.300
 about how high the stakes are.

44:56.300 --> 44:59.660
 Now, the failures to do this are also very informative

44:59.660 --> 45:01.780
 in how we develop in social groups.

45:01.780 --> 45:04.220
 And this also can inform why some people

45:04.220 --> 45:06.340
 really play well with others and other people don't.

45:06.340 --> 45:08.220
 And some people seem to get along well with groups

45:08.220 --> 45:09.200
 and can handle other people.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.740
 And some people are very rigid.

45:11.700 --> 45:13.120
 In fact, I have an anecdote about this.

45:13.120 --> 45:15.200
 When I was a kid, we used to play this game.

45:15.200 --> 45:16.180
 It's not a game I suggest,

45:16.180 --> 45:18.740
 but we used to do what were called dirt-clawed wars.

45:18.740 --> 45:21.680
 So a friend of mine, his parents were generally not home

45:21.680 --> 45:22.660
 in the afternoon.

45:22.660 --> 45:25.540
 So we must've been somewhere around 10 or 11 years old.

45:25.540 --> 45:27.700
 And we would set up these two big dirt mounds.

45:27.700 --> 45:29.100
 We would shovel them to big dirt mounds

45:29.100 --> 45:30.380
 on two sides of the yard.

45:30.380 --> 45:32.620
 And then we would just take dirt clods

45:32.620 --> 45:33.980
 and we'd throw them at one another

45:33.980 --> 45:35.180
 and just have dirt-clawed wars.

45:35.180 --> 45:37.240
 Again, not suggesting this.

45:37.240 --> 45:39.660
 I'm not responsible for what happens if you do,

45:39.660 --> 45:40.900
 but there were rules.

45:40.900 --> 45:43.540
 And the rules were, for instance,

45:43.540 --> 45:45.700
 you couldn't pack rocks into the dirt clods

45:46.600 --> 45:49.120
 and you could run across to the other side

45:49.120 --> 45:50.500
 and you could jump on the other person's mountain.

45:50.500 --> 45:51.660
 You could throw dirt clods in there.

45:51.660 --> 45:54.800
 I guess this is the stuff that we thought was entertaining.

45:54.800 --> 45:57.460
 But if someone got hit in the head,

45:57.460 --> 45:59.700
 generally there was an unspoken rule

45:59.700 --> 46:01.620
 that you kind of stop and see whether or not

46:01.620 --> 46:03.460
 they were damaged or not before you'd continue.

46:03.460 --> 46:04.900
 You couldn't continue pelting them.

46:04.900 --> 46:06.260
 And of course people broke this rule.

46:06.260 --> 46:08.780
 In fact, I remember one kid, I'm not going to name him

46:08.780 --> 46:11.860
 because actually he's grown into a very prominent

46:11.860 --> 46:15.100
 and functional adult, but he got hit once in the head.

46:15.100 --> 46:17.040
 And then I think someone had thrown a dirt clod

46:17.040 --> 46:18.400
 shortly thereafter.

46:18.400 --> 46:21.020
 And all of a sudden he just went into a rage,

46:21.020 --> 46:23.940
 picking up rocks and sticks and attacking another kid.

46:23.940 --> 46:26.580
 And so clearly that was a case in which

46:26.580 --> 46:29.000
 the rules of the game were now being violated,

46:29.000 --> 46:30.660
 but it served a very important purpose.

46:30.660 --> 46:33.980
 There was the typical thing that there were some tears,

46:33.980 --> 46:35.940
 I think, as I recall from one kid or the other,

46:35.940 --> 46:37.440
 there was like snot coming out of the nose

46:37.440 --> 46:38.660
 and turning bright red.

46:38.660 --> 46:39.580
 A kid went home.

46:39.580 --> 46:40.420
 It was a mess.

46:40.420 --> 46:41.860
 The parents had to say something,

46:41.860 --> 46:43.060
 or maybe there was a phone call.

46:43.060 --> 46:45.060
 I don't quite recall how it got resolved.

46:45.060 --> 46:48.860
 But the idea is that there's an agreed upon set of rules

46:48.860 --> 46:50.360
 about how high the stakes are

46:50.360 --> 46:51.620
 and what we're all going to do.

46:51.620 --> 46:52.760
 And this is separate from sport

46:52.760 --> 46:54.520
 where there are clearly defined rules

46:54.520 --> 46:57.080
 about what's out of bounds, what's in bounds,

46:57.080 --> 46:58.880
 what sorts of behaviors will get you a yellow card

46:58.880 --> 47:01.260
 or a red card, for instance, on the soccer field.

47:01.260 --> 47:03.000
 All animals, including humans,

47:03.000 --> 47:05.860
 are doing this low stakes contingency testing

47:05.860 --> 47:08.380
 and all animals, including humans you will find,

47:08.380 --> 47:10.340
 start to up the stakes.

47:10.340 --> 47:12.660
 And inevitably in group play,

47:12.660 --> 47:15.320
 one member of the group will kind of break rules.

47:15.320 --> 47:17.340
 You see this also in puppies.

47:17.340 --> 47:19.680
 So for instance, puppies will bite one another

47:19.680 --> 47:21.700
 with those sharp little needle-like puppy teeth.

47:21.700 --> 47:22.980
 I remember when Costello had those teeth,

47:22.980 --> 47:24.920
 those things were so darn sharp.

47:24.920 --> 47:26.700
 And puppies will yelp

47:26.700 --> 47:28.960
 when one of their litter mates bites them.

47:28.960 --> 47:30.420
 That yelp actually serves

47:30.420 --> 47:32.780
 a very important inhibitory function,

47:32.780 --> 47:33.860
 this is well-defined,

47:33.860 --> 47:35.600
 to tell the other one that's too tough.

47:35.600 --> 47:38.460
 And this is how animals learn soft bite, okay?

47:38.460 --> 47:41.340
 If they don't get that feedback from other litter mates,

47:41.340 --> 47:44.580
 they never actually learn what's too hard and what's soft.

47:44.580 --> 47:46.620
 And so humans do this as well.

47:46.620 --> 47:48.980
 Now you can look at your adult counterparts,

47:48.980 --> 47:51.500
 and indeed we should probably look at ourselves and ask,

47:51.500 --> 47:54.220
 did we learn proper play contingency when we were younger?

47:54.220 --> 47:55.840
 Do we tend to take things too seriously?

47:55.840 --> 47:59.080
 Do we tend to overreact aggressively

47:59.080 --> 48:03.460
 when other people are clearly engaging in playful jabbing

48:03.460 --> 48:05.260
 or sarcasm or things of that sort?

48:05.260 --> 48:06.980
 So each of you will have a different experience of this,

48:06.980 --> 48:11.220
 but the point is that play serves many functions.

48:11.220 --> 48:12.420
 It's not just about the self,

48:12.420 --> 48:14.740
 it's also about interactions between multiple people.

48:14.740 --> 48:17.140
 It's about rule testing and low stakes contingency.

48:17.140 --> 48:19.300
 Rule breaking also serves an important role

48:19.300 --> 48:22.100
 as is with the example of the dirt-clawed war,

48:22.100 --> 48:24.460
 puppies biting other puppies, et cetera.

48:24.460 --> 48:26.180
 And last but not least,

48:26.180 --> 48:28.420
 there are different forms of play

48:28.420 --> 48:31.940
 that help us establish who we will become as adults.

48:31.940 --> 48:34.940
 One of the more powerful of these is role play.

48:34.940 --> 48:38.500
 When children and sometimes adults

48:38.500 --> 48:40.400
 will take on different roles

48:40.400 --> 48:43.540
 that are distinct from their natural world roles

48:43.540 --> 48:46.620
 in order to, for instance, establish hierarchies.

48:46.620 --> 48:47.880
 So someone's going to be the leader

48:47.880 --> 48:49.120
 and someone's going to be the follower.

48:49.120 --> 48:51.500
 Someone will be dominant and someone will be submissive.

48:51.500 --> 48:55.640
 Someone will work alone, other people will work in a group.

48:55.640 --> 48:58.340
 These kinds of role-playing are, again,

48:58.340 --> 49:00.140
 ways in which the prefrontal cortex

49:00.140 --> 49:03.180
 has to expand the number of operations.

49:03.180 --> 49:04.680
 In neuroscience, we call these algorithms

49:04.680 --> 49:06.480
 that it has to run in order to make predictions.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.060
 You have to take in a lot of information

49:08.060 --> 49:11.520
 about your environment all the time and make predictions.

49:11.520 --> 49:14.420
 But if you are suddenly cast into a new role,

49:14.420 --> 49:17.900
 well, then you definitely have to make even more predictions

49:17.900 --> 49:19.180
 from a different standpoint.

49:19.180 --> 49:21.420
 So these are very powerful for teaching the brain

49:21.420 --> 49:22.560
 how to function.

49:22.560 --> 49:23.540
 I had a sister growing up,

49:23.540 --> 49:25.220
 I still have a sister, fortunately,

49:25.220 --> 49:28.100
 and she and her friends largely played

49:28.100 --> 49:30.600
 with dolls and doll houses in the room next door,

49:30.600 --> 49:32.620
 and they would take on different roles.

49:32.620 --> 49:35.060
 In fact, some kids, if they play alone,

49:35.060 --> 49:37.540
 will start to take on the role of leader

49:37.540 --> 49:40.920
 by taking on an imaginary or creating an imaginary friend.

49:40.920 --> 49:44.320
 And my apologies to my sibling, but for a long time,

49:44.320 --> 49:46.220
 she had an imaginary friend.

49:46.220 --> 49:48.960
 Eventually, that imaginary friend disappeared.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.100
 I don't know the science around imaginary friends

49:51.100 --> 49:53.000
 and what makes them disappear or not

49:53.000 --> 49:54.560
 at what stage of development,

49:54.560 --> 49:56.300
 but imaginary friends are pretty common.

49:56.300 --> 49:59.140
 And that's just another way of being able to

49:59.140 --> 50:01.180
 boss somebody around if that's your thing

50:01.180 --> 50:03.940
 or to engage in cooperative play.

50:03.940 --> 50:06.220
 So we can look at this stage of development

50:06.220 --> 50:08.720
 we call childhood, and we can look at each stage of it,

50:08.720 --> 50:09.880
 and we can say, wow,

50:09.880 --> 50:11.780
 there are all these different dimensions of play

50:11.780 --> 50:14.020
 that really are about testing out

50:14.020 --> 50:16.380
 how we feel, comfortable or uncomfortable,

50:16.380 --> 50:19.300
 how we react, good or bad,

50:19.300 --> 50:22.820
 how we react with stress or with glee

50:22.820 --> 50:24.900
 when others behave in certain ways.

50:24.900 --> 50:27.160
 And so what I'm hoping is coming through

50:27.160 --> 50:30.040
 is that play is not just about having fun.

50:30.040 --> 50:32.260
 Play is about testing.

50:32.260 --> 50:33.500
 It's about experimenting

50:33.500 --> 50:36.040
 and it's about expanding your brain's capacity.

50:36.040 --> 50:37.380
 And that's true early in development

50:37.380 --> 50:39.100
 and it's true throughout the lifespan.

50:39.100 --> 50:40.540
 So at this point in the discussion,

50:40.540 --> 50:42.240
 I want to take a step back,

50:42.240 --> 50:44.780
 look at the biology and neurochemistry of play

50:44.780 --> 50:46.180
 just a little bit.

50:46.180 --> 50:49.740
 And in doing that, really define what is effective play.

50:49.740 --> 50:52.860
 If the goal of play is to explore different contingencies

50:52.860 --> 50:54.700
 in low stakes environments

50:54.700 --> 50:57.840
 and to expand the function of our prefrontal cortex

50:57.840 --> 50:59.660
 so that we can see new possibilities

50:59.660 --> 51:02.080
 and new ways of being become more flexible,

51:02.080 --> 51:06.520
 more creative, more effective outside of the games of play

51:06.520 --> 51:08.860
 or the arenas of play, I should say.

51:08.860 --> 51:11.340
 Well, then we should be asking,

51:11.340 --> 51:12.580
 how do I know if I'm playing?

51:12.580 --> 51:14.540
 How do I know if I'm playing correctly?

51:15.460 --> 51:17.340
 Turns out there's an answer to that.

51:17.340 --> 51:19.420
 Earlier, I referred to this brain area,

51:19.420 --> 51:23.100
 the periaqueductal gray that releases opioids,

51:23.100 --> 51:26.060
 endogenous opioids into our brain and body

51:26.060 --> 51:29.380
 and tends to relax us a bit.

51:29.380 --> 51:31.500
 It actually is what leads to these things

51:31.500 --> 51:33.140
 like soft eyes and head tilts

51:33.140 --> 51:37.420
 and puppies making puppy postures and things of that sort

51:37.420 --> 51:41.260
 and how that opens up the number of different functions

51:41.260 --> 51:44.400
 or algorithms that the prefrontal cortex can run.

51:44.400 --> 51:45.860
 But there's another piece of the puzzle,

51:45.860 --> 51:50.260
 which is for something to genuinely be play and playful

51:50.260 --> 51:54.620
 and for it to have this effect of expanding our brain

51:54.620 --> 51:57.620
 and engaging neuroplasticity of really changing our brains

51:57.620 --> 52:00.580
 so that we can see and engage in more possible behaviors

52:00.580 --> 52:02.140
 and thoughts, et cetera.

52:02.140 --> 52:06.580
 We also have to have low amounts of adrenaline,

52:06.580 --> 52:09.400
 so-called epinephrine in our brain and body.

52:09.400 --> 52:12.740
 Now, the background science for this is quite extensive,

52:12.740 --> 52:14.300
 but for those of you that are interested

52:14.300 --> 52:16.160
 in papers and manuscripts,

52:16.160 --> 52:19.140
 perhaps the best one is a review published in neuroscience

52:19.140 --> 52:22.500
 and biobehavioral reviews by the very Jak Pengsep,

52:22.500 --> 52:27.620
 although he has a co-author, which is Steven Siviy, S-I-V-I-Y.

52:27.620 --> 52:30.460
 I'll provide a link to this in the caption show notes.

52:30.460 --> 52:32.100
 And the title of this paper is

52:32.100 --> 52:34.140
 In Search of the Neurobiological Substrates

52:34.140 --> 52:37.220
 for Social Playfulness in Mammalian Brains.

52:37.220 --> 52:39.060
 And it's a quite extensive review,

52:39.060 --> 52:42.500
 but it basically boils down to some key findings

52:42.500 --> 52:47.500
 whereby any sorts of drugs or behaviors or scenarios

52:47.800 --> 52:51.660
 that increase levels of adrenaline too much

52:51.660 --> 52:53.860
 will tend to inhibit play.

52:53.860 --> 52:56.220
 And drugs and scenarios,

52:56.220 --> 52:58.140
 and I'm not suggesting recreational drugs here,

52:58.140 --> 52:59.980
 but these were experiments that were done

52:59.980 --> 53:01.660
 in the laboratory setting

53:01.660 --> 53:05.140
 that increase the endogenous opioid output

53:05.140 --> 53:07.180
 will tend to increase playfulness.

53:07.180 --> 53:09.900
 And so really the state of mind

53:09.900 --> 53:13.540
 that one needs to adopt when playing is,

53:13.540 --> 53:16.220
 first of all, you have to engage in the play,

53:16.220 --> 53:17.960
 whatever it happens to be,

53:17.960 --> 53:20.620
 with some degree of focus and seriousness,

53:20.620 --> 53:23.380
 and focus and seriousness in the neurobiological context

53:23.380 --> 53:25.660
 generally means epinephrine,

53:25.660 --> 53:27.740
 being able to focus is largely reliant

53:27.740 --> 53:30.220
 on things like adrenaline, epinephrine,

53:30.220 --> 53:32.100
 but also the presence of dopamine,

53:32.100 --> 53:34.340
 which is a molecule that generates motivation

53:34.340 --> 53:36.820
 and focus in concert with epinephrine,

53:36.820 --> 53:40.260
 but also that these endogenous opioids be liberated.

53:40.260 --> 53:42.820
 And it's really the low stakes feature of play

53:42.820 --> 53:45.720
 that allows those endogenous opioids to be liberated.

53:45.720 --> 53:46.560
 What do I mean by that?

53:46.560 --> 53:49.260
 Well, if you are very, very concerned about the outcome,

53:49.260 --> 53:52.260
 like you've put a lot of money on the table in a given game,

53:53.440 --> 53:56.120
 or you're a football player in the Super Bowl,

53:56.120 --> 53:58.420
 or you're playing a game for which,

53:58.420 --> 54:01.280
 defeating the other person or your team winning

54:01.280 --> 54:03.260
 is absolutely crucial to you,

54:03.260 --> 54:04.940
 well then that's not really going

54:04.940 --> 54:06.640
 to engage the play circuitry.

54:08.540 --> 54:11.560
 On the contrary, if you're engaging in those same behaviors

54:11.560 --> 54:12.840
 or any other behavior in a way

54:12.840 --> 54:15.100
 that you're simply there to explore,

54:15.100 --> 54:17.300
 but you don't have high levels of adrenaline in your system,

54:17.300 --> 54:19.700
 you're not stressed about the potential outcome,

54:19.700 --> 54:22.260
 well then that constitutes play.

54:22.260 --> 54:24.500
 Now that's somewhat obvious on the one hand,

54:24.500 --> 54:26.260
 that you take seriously what you take seriously,

54:26.260 --> 54:27.540
 and you can be more playful about things

54:27.540 --> 54:29.220
 that you don't take so seriously,

54:29.220 --> 54:32.580
 but what is absolutely not obvious

54:32.580 --> 54:35.740
 is that the state of playfulness

54:35.740 --> 54:39.220
 is actually what allows you to perform best

54:39.220 --> 54:42.500
 because the state of playfulness offers you the opportunity

54:42.500 --> 54:45.560
 to engage in novel types of behaviors and interactions

54:45.560 --> 54:48.260
 that you would not otherwise be able to access

54:48.260 --> 54:51.320
 if you are so focused on the outcome, okay?

54:51.320 --> 54:53.900
 So a state of playfulness is absolutely critical,

54:53.900 --> 54:55.520
 not just during play,

54:55.520 --> 54:58.260
 but during competitive scenarios of any kind.

54:58.260 --> 55:01.900
 I actually started to cultivate a practice related to this

55:01.900 --> 55:03.180
 when I was in college,

55:03.180 --> 55:06.000
 I had this general practice

55:06.000 --> 55:08.280
 of when I wanted to learn something,

55:08.280 --> 55:10.080
 I would tell myself

55:10.080 --> 55:12.400
 that it was the most important information in the world

55:12.400 --> 55:14.540
 and that I was very, very interested in it,

55:14.540 --> 55:16.240
 and I would kind of lie to myself and say,

55:16.240 --> 55:18.660
 oh, I'm super interested in, I won't name the topics,

55:18.660 --> 55:20.940
 but super interested in this or super interested in that,

55:20.940 --> 55:24.020
 and I could sort of delude myself into being hyper-focused

55:24.020 --> 55:26.700
 on whatever it is that I was learning

55:26.700 --> 55:29.020
 in ways that surprised me.

55:29.020 --> 55:33.240
 However, when we are hyper-focused on something

55:33.240 --> 55:35.940
 and we are rigidly attached to the outcome,

55:35.940 --> 55:38.420
 we can't engage in flexible thinking.

55:38.420 --> 55:41.340
 So it's a great tool to be hyper-focused on something

55:41.340 --> 55:43.340
 and take it very, very seriously

55:43.340 --> 55:45.900
 when we're simply trying to learn things

55:45.900 --> 55:48.180
 by kind of rote memory, learn things and regurgitate,

55:48.180 --> 55:50.460
 learn and regurgitate of the sort that,

55:50.460 --> 55:52.800
 frankly, a lot of schooling involves.

55:52.800 --> 55:55.420
 But if we are trying to get better at something,

55:55.420 --> 55:57.480
 we sort of hit a wall in athletic performance

55:57.480 --> 55:58.940
 or in cognitive performance

55:58.940 --> 56:00.260
 where we're not creative enough,

56:00.260 --> 56:02.740
 or we're finding, let's just use a sports example,

56:02.740 --> 56:05.620
 that we only have a certain number of moves

56:05.620 --> 56:06.780
 that we can deploy

56:06.780 --> 56:08.380
 or a certain number of swings of the racket

56:08.380 --> 56:09.540
 that we can deploy.

56:09.540 --> 56:12.280
 The way to actually expand your practice

56:12.280 --> 56:15.180
 is to engage in this kind of low stakes thinking.

56:15.180 --> 56:17.260
 The idea that, well, I'm just going to kind of play

56:17.260 --> 56:18.180
 and tinker.

56:18.180 --> 56:20.660
 I'm going to explore in a way that it doesn't really matter

56:20.660 --> 56:22.140
 if the ball goes back over the net.

56:22.140 --> 56:23.860
 It doesn't really matter if the ball goes in the hole.

56:23.860 --> 56:25.900
 And it's counterintuitive because you think,

56:25.900 --> 56:27.900
 no, the thing that we need to do is drill

56:27.900 --> 56:28.860
 and drill and drill and drill.

56:28.860 --> 56:30.540
 And indeed there's a place for that.

56:30.540 --> 56:34.740
 But this mode of play with modest levels

56:34.740 --> 56:37.180
 of endogenous opioids being released in our system,

56:37.180 --> 56:40.340
 plus low levels of adrenaline, epinephrine,

56:40.340 --> 56:42.660
 low levels of epinephrine and adrenaline

56:42.660 --> 56:45.500
 are possible only when the stakes are low enough

56:45.500 --> 56:47.220
 that we're not stressed.

56:47.220 --> 56:50.220
 Well, that combination really allows the prefrontal cortex

56:50.220 --> 56:52.180
 to explore different possibilities

56:52.180 --> 56:55.980
 in ways that can truly expand our capabilities over time.

56:55.980 --> 56:57.460
 Now, this has been seen again and again,

56:57.460 --> 56:59.660
 also in the business sector,

56:59.660 --> 57:02.320
 some of the more challenging,

57:02.320 --> 57:04.840
 or I should say competitive companies to get jobs at

57:04.840 --> 57:06.620
 are very interested in hiring people

57:06.620 --> 57:09.020
 that as children were so-called tinkerers.

57:09.020 --> 57:12.060
 And actually NASA was first famous for this,

57:12.060 --> 57:15.180
 that many of the people that achieved great success

57:15.180 --> 57:16.740
 in engineering at NASA,

57:16.740 --> 57:19.960
 when they looked back into their childhood histories,

57:19.960 --> 57:21.540
 those people tended to be tinkerers.

57:21.540 --> 57:23.340
 They were people that would kind of play with things

57:23.340 --> 57:26.820
 in a way that wasn't about rigidly following a recipe

57:26.820 --> 57:28.100
 or an instruction manual.

57:28.100 --> 57:31.580
 Great cooks discover new forms of food,

57:31.580 --> 57:33.740
 indeed created entire genres of food

57:34.700 --> 57:36.820
 by way of being tinkerers.

57:36.820 --> 57:38.820
 Musicians do this.

57:38.820 --> 57:40.820
 I grew up playing various sports,

57:40.820 --> 57:41.800
 but skateboarding was one

57:41.800 --> 57:44.220
 that I was particularly involved in for a long time.

57:44.220 --> 57:46.820
 One of the greatest skateboarders of all time is,

57:46.820 --> 57:48.080
 some of you may recognize his name

57:48.080 --> 57:49.660
 is the great Rodney Mullen.

57:49.660 --> 57:54.140
 And Rodney was kind of famous for evolving the sport

57:54.140 --> 57:55.220
 and continuing to evolve the sport

57:55.220 --> 57:56.580
 in ways that no one could predict,

57:56.580 --> 57:58.520
 using skateboards in all sorts of ways

57:58.520 --> 58:00.260
 that no one had thought of previously.

58:00.260 --> 58:01.460
 And of course there are other skateboarders

58:01.460 --> 58:02.600
 that did that as well,

58:02.600 --> 58:04.660
 but he's particularly well-known for that.

58:04.660 --> 58:06.780
 And his process is his own.

58:06.780 --> 58:08.540
 I can't speak to it too much,

58:08.540 --> 58:10.700
 but he was also known as a kind of a tinkerer

58:10.700 --> 58:12.540
 as somebody who would spend a lot of time

58:12.540 --> 58:13.940
 just kind of flipping the board

58:13.940 --> 58:15.620
 and just flipping it in the air

58:15.620 --> 58:17.220
 and watching the ways in which it flipped

58:17.220 --> 58:19.860
 and kind of studying the physics of it really

58:19.860 --> 58:22.800
 and expanding on his existing understanding

58:22.800 --> 58:24.760
 of what could happen on a skateboard

58:24.760 --> 58:26.180
 by way of just playing.

58:26.180 --> 58:27.940
 Now he took it very seriously,

58:27.940 --> 58:30.060
 but it's this kind of razor's edge

58:30.060 --> 58:31.740
 between taking something very seriously,

58:31.740 --> 58:34.180
 but also tinkering and playing and exploring

58:34.180 --> 58:35.940
 and just seeing what happens and kind of like,

58:35.940 --> 58:37.980
 well, let's just see what happens if we did this.

58:37.980 --> 58:40.740
 That mindset is extremely powerful

58:40.740 --> 58:43.340
 to export from this thing that we call play

58:43.340 --> 58:45.720
 into what we could call more serious endeavors

58:45.720 --> 58:47.800
 of one's occupation or sport,

58:47.800 --> 58:49.100
 whether or not it's behind a desk

58:49.100 --> 58:51.620
 or whether or not it's running around on a field

58:51.620 --> 58:53.700
 or engineering, any endeavor.

58:53.700 --> 58:58.420
 And so the whole purpose of this episode on play is,

58:58.420 --> 59:00.180
 yes, on the one hand to illustrate

59:00.180 --> 59:03.500
 the incredible evolutionary utility of play

59:03.500 --> 59:06.840
 for setting up the self and relation of the self to others,

59:06.840 --> 59:08.780
 indeed for setting up cultures entirely

59:08.780 --> 59:10.840
 because cultures will watch sport together

59:10.840 --> 59:12.580
 or they'll celebrate their team winning.

59:12.580 --> 59:14.920
 I mean, World Cup, I've never been a big soccer fan,

59:14.920 --> 59:18.100
 even though my dad is Argentine, but it's incredible.

59:18.100 --> 59:20.460
 I mean, the entire world kind of lights up

59:20.460 --> 59:22.620
 and gets engaged around whether or not their team,

59:22.620 --> 59:23.700
 their country is going to win.

59:23.700 --> 59:25.780
 The Olympics also being another example.

59:25.780 --> 59:28.660
 But play and sport are not quite the same

59:28.660 --> 59:29.980
 as I've pointed out before.

59:29.980 --> 59:32.000
 And for all of us who are thinking about tools

59:32.000 --> 59:33.600
 and things that we can extract from science

59:33.600 --> 59:36.060
 to enrich our lives, I would say,

59:36.060 --> 59:37.620
 for those of you that are already playing

59:37.620 --> 59:40.680
 on a regular basis in one form or another, terrific.

59:40.680 --> 59:43.000
 Start to expand other forms of play,

59:43.000 --> 59:44.180
 in particular forms of play

59:44.180 --> 59:47.060
 that involve new groups of individuals.

59:47.060 --> 59:49.520
 So if you're somebody that typically plays one-on-one

59:49.520 --> 59:52.020
 with somebody, try to expand into playing as teams.

59:52.020 --> 59:55.000
 If you're somebody who only plays alone,

59:55.000 --> 59:56.980
 then try to expand into playing

59:56.980 --> 59:59.260
 in perhaps one-on-one first and in groups.

59:59.260 --> 1:00:01.020
 This is the way that your brain learns

1:00:01.020 --> 1:00:03.300
 and evolves and changes and gets better.

1:00:03.300 --> 1:00:04.980
 And I raise this because another one

1:00:04.980 --> 1:00:06.960
 of the top 10 questions I get is,

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:08.420
 how can I keep my brain young?

1:00:08.420 --> 1:00:09.980
 How can I continue to learn?

1:00:09.980 --> 1:00:13.420
 How can I get better in school, in sport, in life,

1:00:13.420 --> 1:00:17.040
 in relationships, et cetera, emotionally, cognitively,

1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:18.320
 and on and on and on.

1:00:18.320 --> 1:00:20.340
 And yes, there are supplements

1:00:20.340 --> 1:00:21.980
 that can support neuroplasticity.

1:00:21.980 --> 1:00:23.980
 Yes, there are brain games and apps

1:00:23.980 --> 1:00:25.780
 that can support neuroplasticity.

1:00:25.780 --> 1:00:29.740
 But if you really want to engage neuroplasticity at any age,

1:00:29.740 --> 1:00:31.860
 what you need to do is return to the same sorts

1:00:31.860 --> 1:00:35.140
 of practices and tools that your nervous system

1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:37.300
 naturally used throughout development

1:00:37.300 --> 1:00:39.860
 and that evolved over hundreds of thousands of years

1:00:39.860 --> 1:00:42.500
 to trigger this thing that we call neuroplasticity.

1:00:42.500 --> 1:00:44.000
 And the reason this is so important is

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.320
 because it starts to move us away

1:00:45.320 --> 1:00:46.800
 from what some people called hacks.

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:49.660
 I define hacks as using one thing for a different purpose

1:00:49.660 --> 1:00:51.620
 to kind of get a shortcut.

1:00:51.620 --> 1:00:53.580
 I don't really like the term, frankly,

1:00:53.580 --> 1:00:57.180
 and I don't like it because it's not grounded

1:00:57.180 --> 1:00:59.040
 in any biological mechanism.

1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:00.260
 But when we look at play,

1:01:00.260 --> 1:01:03.220
 we can say play is the portal to plasticity.

1:01:03.220 --> 1:01:04.860
 Play at every stage of life

1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:06.660
 is the way in which we learned the rules

1:01:06.660 --> 1:01:08.340
 for that stage of life.

1:01:08.340 --> 1:01:10.440
 And play is the way in which we were able

1:01:10.440 --> 1:01:14.740
 to test how we might function in the real world context.

1:01:14.740 --> 1:01:17.560
 So play is powerful.

1:01:17.560 --> 1:01:18.880
 And we could even say that play

1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:21.460
 is the most powerful portal to plasticity.

1:01:21.460 --> 1:01:24.540
 The reason for that is that yes,

1:01:24.540 --> 1:01:29.260
 this high opioid, low epinephrine or adrenaline state

1:01:29.260 --> 1:01:31.220
 is what opens up play.

1:01:31.220 --> 1:01:33.900
 But then inside of the arena of play,

1:01:33.900 --> 1:01:35.380
 when the prefrontal cortex is running

1:01:35.380 --> 1:01:38.960
 all these different possibilities in this low stakes way,

1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:41.300
 but with some degree of focus,

1:01:41.300 --> 1:01:43.960
 there are a number of other chemicals that are deployed.

1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:46.060
 Things like brain derived and trophic factor

1:01:46.060 --> 1:01:48.500
 and other growth factors that actually trigger

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:52.700
 the rewiring of brain circuits that allow for it to expand.

1:01:52.700 --> 1:01:55.540
 And indeed, that's what is neuroplasticity.

1:01:55.540 --> 1:01:57.980
 If you're interested in those chemicals

1:01:57.980 --> 1:02:01.100
 and the kind of arena of things that happen

1:02:01.100 --> 1:02:03.100
 when one engages in neuroplasticity,

1:02:03.100 --> 1:02:05.020
 there's a vast literature out there.

1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:07.180
 But one of the more popular books

1:02:07.180 --> 1:02:09.220
 that I think is quite good is from my friend

1:02:09.220 --> 1:02:10.300
 and colleague, John Rady,

1:02:10.300 --> 1:02:12.260
 who's a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School.

1:02:12.260 --> 1:02:13.860
 That's R-A-T-E-Y.

1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:17.020
 He wrote the book Spark a few years back.

1:02:17.020 --> 1:02:18.500
 And I think it's still very relevant.

1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:21.940
 And John talks about the important role

1:02:21.940 --> 1:02:25.660
 that play exerts in the neuroplasticity process

1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:27.340
 and points to a number of different protocols

1:02:27.340 --> 1:02:28.580
 that one can engage in.

1:02:28.580 --> 1:02:29.780
 He also points to the importance

1:02:29.780 --> 1:02:31.800
 of navigating new environments

1:02:31.800 --> 1:02:33.700
 to not just go on the same hike every week

1:02:33.700 --> 1:02:34.640
 or take the same walk,

1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:36.820
 but actually get into new novel environments.

1:02:36.820 --> 1:02:38.140
 So you're starting to sense a theme here.

1:02:38.140 --> 1:02:40.980
 There's novelty, exploring contingencies,

1:02:40.980 --> 1:02:44.140
 keeping the stakes relatively low, et cetera, et cetera.

1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:46.700
 But these really are the gates to this holy grail

1:02:46.700 --> 1:02:48.560
 that we call neuroplasticity.

1:02:48.560 --> 1:02:51.380
 Neuroplasticity, as I've talked about in the podcast before,

1:02:51.380 --> 1:02:52.640
 is a two-step process.

1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:55.360
 It involves focusing very intensely

1:02:55.360 --> 1:02:57.860
 or at least focusing somewhat on whatever it is

1:02:57.860 --> 1:02:59.020
 that one is trying to learn,

1:02:59.020 --> 1:03:01.620
 and then engaging in deep rest,

1:03:01.620 --> 1:03:03.940
 ideally deep sleep, in the following nights.

1:03:03.940 --> 1:03:05.540
 And I've also talked about the benefits

1:03:05.540 --> 1:03:07.300
 of things like naps and yoga nidra,

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:09.840
 so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:12.540
 for enhancing or accelerating plasticity.

1:03:12.540 --> 1:03:15.220
 You can check out the episodes on focus

1:03:15.220 --> 1:03:19.260
 at hubermanlab.com or the episodes on how to learn faster,

1:03:19.260 --> 1:03:20.180
 the detail, all of those.

1:03:20.180 --> 1:03:24.180
 We had a newsletter that lists out all the tools

1:03:24.180 --> 1:03:26.180
 for neuroplasticity, enhancing neuroplasticity.

1:03:26.180 --> 1:03:28.260
 All that is available, zero cost to you

1:03:28.260 --> 1:03:30.660
 at hubermanlab.com, et cetera.

1:03:30.660 --> 1:03:33.120
 You can just download that information.

1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:36.520
 But John's book, that newsletter, those episodes,

1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:38.220
 they really point to this two-step process

1:03:38.220 --> 1:03:41.440
 where it's focus and then rest, focus and then rest.

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:46.180
 And play is its own unique form of focused and then rest,

1:03:46.180 --> 1:03:47.020
 focus and rest.

1:03:47.020 --> 1:03:49.980
 It's not the same as learning something for sake of school

1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:52.620
 or critically trying to learn a motor behavior

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:53.880
 for sake of sport.

1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:56.520
 It's really about expanding the number of things

1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:59.900
 that you could learn down the line, okay?

1:03:59.900 --> 1:04:01.300
 So said once again,

1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:03.880
 so I just want to make sure it's abundantly clear,

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:07.000
 play is about establishing a broader framework

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:08.960
 within which you can learn new things.

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.300
 It's not about learning some specific thing.

1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:13.900
 It's not about the game you happen to be playing.

1:04:13.900 --> 1:04:16.600
 It's not about the dollhouse that the kids are playing with

1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:18.900
 so that they could become amazing dollhouse players

1:04:18.900 --> 1:04:20.160
 when they grow up, right?

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:22.620
 The dirt-clawed war that I referred to earlier,

1:04:22.620 --> 1:04:24.000
 for better or for worse,

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:27.080
 was not about becoming the best dirt-clawed thrower

1:04:27.080 --> 1:04:29.240
 or winning the trophy for dirt-clods in the neighborhood,

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:30.580
 although we actually had a trophy

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:32.720
 for the best dirt-clawed team.

1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:34.960
 Alas, it was not my team that year.

1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:37.680
 But the point is that you're learning rules

1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:41.080
 and establishing a broader foundation of practices

1:04:41.080 --> 1:04:44.800
 that then you can learn more things within that context.

1:04:44.800 --> 1:04:46.300
 Thus far, I've tried to convince you

1:04:46.300 --> 1:04:49.660
 through a combination of data and anecdote and explanation

1:04:49.660 --> 1:04:52.720
 that adopting a stance of playfulness

1:04:52.720 --> 1:04:56.040
 and indeed engaging in play on a somewhat regular basis

1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:57.120
 could be beneficial to you,

1:04:57.120 --> 1:04:59.540
 regardless of circumstances or goals.

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:02.160
 If I haven't done that already,

1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:03.840
 what I'm about to tell you hopefully

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:05.360
 will push you over the line.

1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:09.000
 It turns out that when you look across

1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.240
 the kingdom of all animals,

1:05:11.240 --> 1:05:14.400
 what you find is that animals

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:16.600
 that engage in playful behaviors

1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:19.000
 for the longest period of time

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:20.520
 are also the animals

1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:23.960
 that have the greatest degree of neuroplasticity,

1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:26.320
 the brain and nervous system's ability to change

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:27.800
 in response to experience.

1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:30.920
 Put differently, animals that only play

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:34.360
 for a very small fraction of their entire life

1:05:34.360 --> 1:05:37.820
 have very rigid brains that don't learn new things,

1:05:37.820 --> 1:05:41.240
 whereas animals that play for a long period

1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:44.880
 throughout their life have very plastic brains.

1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:47.960
 And there's even some evidence that's at this point

1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:51.160
 largely anecdotal, but there's some data starting to emerge

1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:54.520
 that adults that maintain a playful stance

1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:59.520
 that engage in things, again, that are low stakes,

1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:04.600
 contingency exploring, important enough that people focus

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:06.780
 and that people pay attention to what they're doing,

1:06:06.780 --> 1:06:09.920
 but that they are not filled with adrenaline,

1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:12.680
 freaked out about the outcome being A or B,

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:14.280
 they're not super, super competitive,

1:06:14.280 --> 1:06:15.640
 maybe just a little bit competitive

1:06:15.640 --> 1:06:17.440
 or not competitive at all.

1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:20.800
 That allows for more ongoing plasticity.

1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:23.240
 And one of the people that comes to mind

1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:25.840
 in thinking about this is, of course, the physicist,

1:06:25.840 --> 1:06:28.800
 and I should say the great physicist, Richard Feynman,

1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:31.720
 Nobel Prize winner, professor at Caltech,

1:06:31.720 --> 1:06:33.400
 was involved in the Manhattan Project,

1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:38.120
 but was also known for being a lifelong tinkerer, right?

1:06:38.120 --> 1:06:40.840
 He also was a mischievous tinkerer.

1:06:40.840 --> 1:06:43.920
 If you read any of the books about Feynman or by Feynman,

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:45.400
 surely you're joking, Mr. Feynman,

1:06:45.400 --> 1:06:47.080
 or what do you care what other people think?

1:06:47.080 --> 1:06:48.300
 These are wonderful short stories,

1:06:48.300 --> 1:06:52.600
 mostly about Feynman doing things like picking all the locks

1:06:52.600 --> 1:06:54.900
 at the Los Alamos laboratory

1:06:54.900 --> 1:06:56.520
 and putting all the top secret documents

1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:57.880
 out on the floor of the office

1:06:57.880 --> 1:06:59.200
 so that when people came in in the morning,

1:06:59.200 --> 1:07:00.560
 they were all out there.

1:07:00.560 --> 1:07:03.160
 Obviously, they weren't released to the general public.

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.080
 He didn't want to threaten national security.

1:07:05.080 --> 1:07:08.600
 But playing pranks like that, and actually Caltech,

1:07:08.600 --> 1:07:09.800
 I don't know if this is still the case,

1:07:09.800 --> 1:07:11.160
 but Caltech, where he was employed,

1:07:11.160 --> 1:07:13.120
 was always known for doing

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:16.800
 very technologically challenging pranks.

1:07:16.800 --> 1:07:19.280
 They're not known for their athletic prowess at Caltech.

1:07:19.280 --> 1:07:20.480
 Sorry, Caltech.

1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:23.480
 But they were known, for example,

1:07:23.480 --> 1:07:26.720
 disrupting the scoreboard at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.400
 for instance, and things of that sort

1:07:28.400 --> 1:07:31.200
 through technological feats that at least at the time

1:07:31.200 --> 1:07:35.220
 required a lot of playfulness and technological prowess.

1:07:35.220 --> 1:07:37.840
 So if you look in science or you look in art

1:07:37.840 --> 1:07:40.260
 or you look in medicine or you look in any domain,

1:07:40.260 --> 1:07:42.400
 what you find is the people that continue

1:07:42.400 --> 1:07:44.820
 to evolve new practices

1:07:44.820 --> 1:07:46.960
 tend to be people that were tinkerers,

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.680
 people that are very creative,

1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:51.200
 tend to be people that are unafraid

1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:54.080
 of exploring things in this low stakes way.

1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:56.320
 They're not so rigidly attached to the outcome

1:07:56.320 --> 1:07:58.460
 that they have to do everything perfectly all the time.

1:07:58.460 --> 1:08:01.120
 Now, they might cloak these playful behaviors

1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:03.720
 so that their final works always look perfect

1:08:03.720 --> 1:08:05.060
 or always look incredible,

1:08:05.060 --> 1:08:06.960
 but they have this kind of playful nature about them.

1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:10.120
 I would venture even to say that the street artist Banksy,

1:08:10.120 --> 1:08:12.080
 for instance, obviously an incredible artist

1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:14.480
 puts a ton of thought and preparation

1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:15.460
 into their work,

1:08:16.740 --> 1:08:19.880
 but there's a kind of playfulness to the whole thing too

1:08:19.880 --> 1:08:22.320
 of using two-dimensional paintings

1:08:22.320 --> 1:08:24.280
 in concert with three-dimensional city dwellings

1:08:24.280 --> 1:08:26.920
 in ways that I think that most people hadn't previously.

1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:28.200
 There were other people like Christo

1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:30.360
 and artists of that sort that did that.

1:08:30.360 --> 1:08:32.840
 But I think Banksy is kind of recognized

1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:36.920
 as the modern rendition of that kind of playfulness

1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:39.160
 using cities in ways that most people don't use cities,

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:42.480
 using art in ways that most people don't use art,

1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:43.720
 for instance.

1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:46.000
 So to go back to the example of Feynman,

1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:49.200
 Feynman was somebody who learned to paint and draw

1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:51.160
 quite well into his 60s.

1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:53.720
 He was somewhat famous or infamous, I should say,

1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:56.260
 for bongo drumming on the roof of Caltech.

1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:59.260
 I say infamous because he was known also

1:08:59.260 --> 1:09:00.460
 for doing that naked,

1:09:00.460 --> 1:09:02.540
 something that is certainly not in concert

1:09:02.540 --> 1:09:04.700
 with the ethical standards and behaviors

1:09:04.700 --> 1:09:05.960
 of universities today.

1:09:05.960 --> 1:09:10.200
 But Feynman had this playful spirit as a child.

1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:11.860
 He had that playful spirit as a teenager,

1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:14.400
 and he had that playful spirit as an adult.

1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:16.800
 And that's one of the hallmarks of Feynman

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:20.000
 was that he wasn't just a rigid physicist

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.240
 who could explain things clearly to the general public.

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:25.880
 He always carried through this playful spirit.

1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:27.240
 And in some of his writings,

1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:29.160
 he pointed to the fact that that playful spirit

1:09:29.160 --> 1:09:31.080
 was something that he worked very hard

1:09:31.080 --> 1:09:34.320
 to continue to cultivate in himself

1:09:34.320 --> 1:09:35.800
 because it was the way in which

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:37.520
 he could see the world differently

1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:39.880
 and to indeed make great discoveries

1:09:39.880 --> 1:09:40.920
 in the field of physics,

1:09:40.920 --> 1:09:43.240
 but also to kind of evolve his relationship

1:09:43.240 --> 1:09:44.200
 to life more generally.

1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:46.840
 And so he comes to mind as a prominent example

1:09:46.840 --> 1:09:48.660
 of somebody who did this.

1:09:48.660 --> 1:09:51.140
 And if I could achieve anything with this episode,

1:09:51.140 --> 1:09:53.800
 besides teaching you something about the biology of play

1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:56.520
 would be to teach you about the utility of play.

1:09:56.520 --> 1:09:58.140
 Again, I don't consider myself

1:09:58.140 --> 1:10:00.880
 a particularly playful person by nature,

1:10:00.880 --> 1:10:03.080
 but I've tried over the years to adopt

1:10:03.080 --> 1:10:04.680
 this stance of exploring things

1:10:04.680 --> 1:10:09.240
 that are very focused on contingencies of different kinds,

1:10:09.240 --> 1:10:11.720
 but keep the stakes low enough that I can have some fun

1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:12.560
 doing them.

1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:14.960
 And I like to think that it's benefited me somewhat.

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:16.400
 Now I'd like to drill a little bit further

1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:19.000
 into this thing that we call neuroplasticity.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.960
 Again, neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous systems

1:10:21.960 --> 1:10:24.360
 ability to change in response to experience.

1:10:24.360 --> 1:10:27.400
 And I should just say that throughout the entire lifespan,

1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:29.440
 the nervous system can change very quickly

1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:31.900
 in response to negative experiences.

1:10:31.900 --> 1:10:33.920
 We can almost all engage in what's called

1:10:33.920 --> 1:10:36.280
 one trial learning where if something really terrible

1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:37.860
 or traumatic happens to us,

1:10:37.860 --> 1:10:40.880
 our nervous system will rewire almost immediately,

1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:42.440
 at least within a few days,

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:45.160
 such that we tend to want to avoid the experience

1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:47.560
 that led to that trauma.

1:10:47.560 --> 1:10:50.420
 Now the whole business of why people return to things

1:10:50.420 --> 1:10:52.480
 that are traumatic to them is a whole other issue.

1:10:52.480 --> 1:10:55.600
 There are books about things like trauma bonding.

1:10:55.600 --> 1:10:58.380
 There's the so-called repetition compulsion

1:10:58.380 --> 1:11:00.840
 from psychoanalysis that people go back into trauma

1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:04.160
 to retest and gain new opportunities to overcome the trauma,

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:05.000
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:06.960
 But in general, what I'm referring to here is,

1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:09.160
 you know, you have a bad experience at the swimming pool

1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:10.520
 when you're a kid where someone holds your head

1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:11.360
 under water too long,

1:11:11.360 --> 1:11:13.020
 and then you just don't want to get back in the water.

1:11:13.020 --> 1:11:15.660
 That's one trial learning of sorts.

1:11:15.660 --> 1:11:17.460
 That of course can be overcome

1:11:17.460 --> 1:11:19.520
 through proper exposure therapy

1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:21.640
 or someone that you trust taking you there,

1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:24.960
 or any number of behaviors that allow you to overcome

1:11:24.960 --> 1:11:27.860
 that particular scenario and experience something new

1:11:27.860 --> 1:11:29.900
 in that same context.

1:11:29.900 --> 1:11:33.560
 But across the lifespan, the learning of new things,

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:35.820
 new contingencies, new possibilities,

1:11:35.820 --> 1:11:39.820
 occurs very differently from about age zero

1:11:39.820 --> 1:11:42.980
 when we're born until about age 25 and thereafter.

1:11:42.980 --> 1:11:46.300
 So from about, I want to emphasize approximately

1:11:46.300 --> 1:11:50.660
 age 25 onward, neuroplasticity occurs through the process

1:11:50.660 --> 1:11:53.100
 that is exactly as I described before.

1:11:53.100 --> 1:11:55.440
 Focus, rest, focus, rest.

1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:56.780
 We focus very intensely.

1:11:56.780 --> 1:11:57.800
 We can't do the thing.

1:11:57.800 --> 1:11:58.980
 We can't do the new movement.

1:11:58.980 --> 1:12:00.180
 We can't do the golf swing.

1:12:00.180 --> 1:12:02.180
 We can't learn the math.

1:12:02.180 --> 1:12:03.620
 We try, we try, we try, we try.

1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:06.020
 We sleep a few nights and then all of a sudden we can do it.

1:12:06.020 --> 1:12:08.540
 Because the rewiring actually occurs during deep rest

1:12:08.540 --> 1:12:10.880
 or naps, but mostly during deep sleep.

1:12:12.400 --> 1:12:15.300
 From birth till about age 25, however,

1:12:15.300 --> 1:12:18.900
 we can learn things, new things and new contingencies,

1:12:19.740 --> 1:12:22.940
 not just negative things and traumatic things

1:12:22.940 --> 1:12:25.500
 through somewhat passive exposure to those things.

1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:27.460
 I will never forget the first time

1:12:27.460 --> 1:12:30.900
 that we went on a family trip to Washington DC

1:12:30.900 --> 1:12:32.120
 and we went to the Smithsonian.

1:12:32.120 --> 1:12:34.020
 I got to see the old fighter planes.

1:12:34.020 --> 1:12:36.460
 And I think, I think the Kitty Hawk

1:12:36.460 --> 1:12:38.400
 or the first one of the first planes was there.

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:40.700
 Anyway, obviously my recollection isn't terrific.

1:12:40.700 --> 1:12:43.500
 My hippocampus is flailing on that one,

1:12:43.500 --> 1:12:44.780
 but I'll never forget the trip.

1:12:44.780 --> 1:12:45.940
 And I'll never forget who went.

1:12:45.940 --> 1:12:48.660
 And I think it was probably eight or nine years old.

1:12:48.660 --> 1:12:50.540
 It's embedded somewhere in my memory.

1:12:50.540 --> 1:12:53.020
 And so just through passive experience

1:12:53.020 --> 1:12:55.420
 and my focusing on the things that excited me

1:12:55.420 --> 1:12:58.220
 about that trip, I have a recollection of that experience.

1:12:58.220 --> 1:13:00.380
 I didn't have to deliberately focus.

1:13:00.380 --> 1:13:01.940
 I wasn't telling myself, focus,

1:13:01.940 --> 1:13:03.540
 you're going to need to remember this trip someday,

1:13:03.540 --> 1:13:05.060
 Andrew, you're going to be podcasting about this,

1:13:05.060 --> 1:13:07.900
 you know, in 39 years or whenever.

1:13:07.900 --> 1:13:09.560
 Again, I forget exactly how old I was.

1:13:09.560 --> 1:13:13.840
 But the key feature here is that the developing brain

1:13:13.840 --> 1:13:17.780
 is able to learn through passive experience

1:13:17.780 --> 1:13:21.840
 because the neurons, the nerve cells in the developing brain

1:13:21.840 --> 1:13:25.740
 are much more over-connected

1:13:25.740 --> 1:13:27.740
 than they will be later in life.

1:13:27.740 --> 1:13:28.980
 The way to think about this is sort of,

1:13:28.980 --> 1:13:31.980
 if you use Google maps as I do too often,

1:13:31.980 --> 1:13:34.780
 I think when I drive,

1:13:34.780 --> 1:13:36.500
 there are a number of roads and pathways

1:13:36.500 --> 1:13:38.400
 that would get you from point A to point B.

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:41.500
 We could imagine those as neural circuits,

1:13:41.500 --> 1:13:45.240
 or we can imagine neural circuits as those roads.

1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:46.880
 Early in development,

1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:49.740
 the nerve connections are much more extensive.

1:13:49.740 --> 1:13:52.020
 It's like having a Google maps

1:13:52.020 --> 1:13:53.940
 that where everything is connected to everything

1:13:53.940 --> 1:13:55.220
 through tiny little cross streets.

1:13:55.220 --> 1:13:57.540
 And the whole thing is just a complete mess.

1:13:57.540 --> 1:14:00.440
 But then by taking particular routes of behavior,

1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:02.940
 of thought, of emotion,

1:14:02.940 --> 1:14:06.220
 certain routes become well-established

1:14:06.220 --> 1:14:10.260
 and the other routes that are not taken simply disappear.

1:14:10.260 --> 1:14:12.680
 Now in the biological context, in the brain,

1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:14.760
 we call that process pruning.

1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:17.360
 And the simple way to envision this is early in development,

1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:19.360
 you have many, many more neurons

1:14:19.360 --> 1:14:21.420
 than you will have as an adult.

1:14:21.420 --> 1:14:24.100
 Those neurons are extensively interconnected

1:14:24.100 --> 1:14:27.460
 and approximately 40% of those interconnections

1:14:27.460 --> 1:14:30.020
 will disappear by time you're 25 years old.

1:14:30.020 --> 1:14:31.180
 They are gone.

1:14:31.180 --> 1:14:33.860
 They are actively removed through processes

1:14:33.860 --> 1:14:36.500
 that involve things like glial cells that come in

1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:39.100
 and literally sneak their little processes

1:14:39.100 --> 1:14:41.300
 in between neurons at the synapse,

1:14:41.300 --> 1:14:42.460
 which are the points of contact

1:14:42.460 --> 1:14:43.620
 and communication between neurons,

1:14:43.620 --> 1:14:47.300
 and push those apart, even eat neurons.

1:14:47.300 --> 1:14:49.300
 There's some incredible work from, for instance,

1:14:49.300 --> 1:14:52.380
 Beth Stevens' lab at Harvard Medical School

1:14:52.380 --> 1:14:56.700
 showing that glial cells go in and eat synapses

1:14:56.700 --> 1:15:00.340
 that are not functional for that particular circuit.

1:15:00.340 --> 1:15:02.380
 Now, what this tells us

1:15:02.380 --> 1:15:04.540
 is that much of our learning during development

1:15:04.540 --> 1:15:07.180
 is the removal of incorrect connections,

1:15:07.180 --> 1:15:09.840
 but it also involves the strengthening of connections

1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:13.620
 that are going to serve certain emotions, certain functions,

1:15:13.620 --> 1:15:15.980
 motor functions, cognitive functions, et cetera.

1:15:17.740 --> 1:15:22.240
 The process of play is largely a process

1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:25.100
 of engaging pruning of neural connections

1:15:25.100 --> 1:15:27.980
 and strengthening of the remaining connections.

1:15:27.980 --> 1:15:29.500
 I'm sure that many of you have heard the term

1:15:29.500 --> 1:15:31.700
 fire together, wire together.

1:15:31.700 --> 1:15:35.420
 That phrase is often incorrectly attributed

1:15:35.420 --> 1:15:37.740
 to the great Donald Hebb, who indeed was great,

1:15:37.740 --> 1:15:40.060
 did incredible work, a psychologist from Canada

1:15:40.060 --> 1:15:42.780
 who established a lot of the basic cellular learning rules

1:15:42.780 --> 1:15:44.340
 for learning and memory,

1:15:44.340 --> 1:15:48.180
 but it was the also great Dr. Carla Schatz

1:15:48.180 --> 1:15:49.740
 who is now at Stanford

1:15:49.740 --> 1:15:52.600
 and was at Berkeley and Harvard as well,

1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:54.860
 but who is at Stanford Medical School

1:15:54.860 --> 1:15:57.160
 who coined this term fire together, wire together.

1:15:57.160 --> 1:15:58.980
 Indeed, that's what happens.

1:15:58.980 --> 1:16:02.740
 When children play, when adolescents play,

1:16:02.740 --> 1:16:04.620
 and when young adults play,

1:16:04.620 --> 1:16:07.900
 whether or not it's social play or play with an object,

1:16:07.900 --> 1:16:10.780
 whether or not it's a sport or play of any kind,

1:16:10.780 --> 1:16:14.080
 imaginary play, imaginary friend play,

1:16:14.080 --> 1:16:16.460
 there is a strengthening of certain neural connections

1:16:16.460 --> 1:16:19.220
 and a pruning away of up to 40%,

1:16:19.220 --> 1:16:21.460
 perhaps even more of connections

1:16:21.460 --> 1:16:26.420
 that are not necessary for certain types of behaviors,

1:16:26.420 --> 1:16:28.180
 emotions, and thoughts.

1:16:28.180 --> 1:16:32.320
 What this means is that it is through the process of play

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:34.740
 that we become who we are as adults.

1:16:34.740 --> 1:16:35.820
 And as I mentioned earlier,

1:16:35.820 --> 1:16:37.740
 it is through the process of play

1:16:37.740 --> 1:16:41.600
 that we are able to adjust who we are as adults.

1:16:41.600 --> 1:16:44.340
 Now, there are bounds on this process.

1:16:44.340 --> 1:16:45.220
 As far as I know,

1:16:45.220 --> 1:16:48.500
 there's never been a reported case of an individual

1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:52.700
 who had a hyperplastic or a brain

1:16:52.700 --> 1:16:57.500
 that was as plastic in adulthood as it was in childhood.

1:16:57.500 --> 1:17:01.340
 But what this tells us is that what we do

1:17:01.340 --> 1:17:03.540
 in the process of play as children

1:17:03.540 --> 1:17:05.000
 is really how we set up the rules

1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:08.120
 for how we behave as adults in almost all domains,

1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:09.480
 which is really incredible.

1:17:09.480 --> 1:17:11.220
 And of course, the reassuring thing is that

1:17:11.220 --> 1:17:14.180
 playing as an adult will allow you to expand

1:17:14.180 --> 1:17:15.060
 on those neural circuits.

1:17:15.060 --> 1:17:16.960
 You can literally grow new connections.

1:17:16.960 --> 1:17:19.620
 Some of you may be saying, does it create new neurons?

1:17:20.500 --> 1:17:21.720
 For better or for worse,

1:17:21.720 --> 1:17:24.420
 it does not seem that many new neurons

1:17:24.420 --> 1:17:26.300
 are added to your brain in adulthood.

1:17:26.300 --> 1:17:28.940
 There are some papers that report a few neurons

1:17:28.940 --> 1:17:31.540
 in certain brain areas, isolated brain areas,

1:17:31.540 --> 1:17:32.360
 but by and large,

1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:34.060
 most of the rewiring of neural connections

1:17:34.060 --> 1:17:35.980
 is the removal of certain connections,

1:17:35.980 --> 1:17:37.660
 this process we're calling pruning,

1:17:37.660 --> 1:17:40.460
 and the strengthening of the remaining connections

1:17:40.460 --> 1:17:42.300
 that make those kind of Google Maps roads

1:17:42.300 --> 1:17:43.840
 in the analogy I laid out before,

1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:45.100
 thicker and more robust.

1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:47.140
 Think of that as taking little trails

1:17:47.140 --> 1:17:50.380
 and turning them into roads, then paving those roads,

1:17:50.380 --> 1:17:51.960
 then turning those roads into highways,

1:17:51.960 --> 1:17:54.700
 then putting up more lanes on those highways

1:17:54.700 --> 1:17:57.280
 and eliminating all the small little back country roads

1:17:57.280 --> 1:17:58.660
 that one could take.

1:17:58.660 --> 1:18:01.160
 And again, this is an analogy for what is happening

1:18:01.160 --> 1:18:02.980
 at the level of neural circuitry.

1:18:02.980 --> 1:18:05.540
 Now, one of the key findings

1:18:05.540 --> 1:18:08.180
 that has emerged from the literature

1:18:08.180 --> 1:18:13.180
 is that children that have been subjected to trauma

1:18:13.180 --> 1:18:15.980
 or immense amounts of stress of any kind

1:18:17.020 --> 1:18:19.660
 have a harder time both engaging in play,

1:18:19.660 --> 1:18:22.260
 but also a harder time accessing neuroplasticity

1:18:22.260 --> 1:18:23.700
 later in life.

1:18:23.700 --> 1:18:26.220
 The good news is this is not a permanent effect.

1:18:26.220 --> 1:18:28.700
 And we'll talk about some of the ways to overcome that

1:18:28.700 --> 1:18:32.060
 in a moment, but this should make sense to you

1:18:32.060 --> 1:18:35.420
 because earlier we talked about how

1:18:35.420 --> 1:18:37.780
 a high level of adrenaline, epinephrine

1:18:37.780 --> 1:18:40.460
 in the brain and body actually inhibits,

1:18:40.460 --> 1:18:43.180
 blocks the circuits in the brain and body

1:18:43.180 --> 1:18:45.380
 that generate play behavior.

1:18:45.380 --> 1:18:47.900
 And when I say that, I mean that in a very concrete way

1:18:47.900 --> 1:18:49.940
 that epinephrine and adrenaline

1:18:49.940 --> 1:18:52.640
 can actually suppress the sorts of circuitry

1:18:52.640 --> 1:18:56.320
 that can lead to things like soft eyes or tongue out

1:18:56.320 --> 1:19:00.460
 or the head tilt, or what we called partial postures

1:19:00.460 --> 1:19:04.460
 of being able to engage in a rough and tumble play,

1:19:04.460 --> 1:19:06.840
 but not take that to the point of outright aggression

1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:10.180
 and damaging the other person or them damaging you.

1:19:10.180 --> 1:19:13.120
 So when I say that trauma and stress

1:19:13.120 --> 1:19:17.660
 can inhibit neuroplasticity by way of inhibiting play

1:19:17.660 --> 1:19:19.540
 at a deeper neurobiological level,

1:19:19.540 --> 1:19:21.540
 what I'm really saying is that the high levels

1:19:21.540 --> 1:19:24.420
 of adrenaline that are generated from trauma and stress

1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:28.500
 actually shut down the circuits that allow a child

1:19:28.500 --> 1:19:30.880
 or a young adult to enter the game of play

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:33.580
 or engage in the game of play in the same way

1:19:33.580 --> 1:19:36.860
 that a child or young adult who didn't have high levels

1:19:36.860 --> 1:19:41.020
 of adrenaline in their system could possibly engage in.

1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:43.220
 Now, the good news is that many

1:19:43.220 --> 1:19:45.500
 of the existing trauma therapies that are out there now,

1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:48.260
 including things like EMDR, exposure therapy,

1:19:48.260 --> 1:19:50.580
 cognitive behavioral therapy, and on and on,

1:19:50.580 --> 1:19:55.180
 including some of the therapies that are more neurochemical,

1:19:55.180 --> 1:19:59.160
 things like ketamine or are more engineering-based,

1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:02.100
 things like transcranial magnetic stimulation, for instance,

1:20:02.100 --> 1:20:05.540
 many of those are paired with forms of talk therapy

1:20:05.540 --> 1:20:08.380
 that are really about the same thing that play is about,

1:20:08.380 --> 1:20:10.580
 which is exploring different contingencies.

1:20:10.580 --> 1:20:13.500
 It's about exploring different types

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:16.260
 of emotional experiences as they relate

1:20:16.260 --> 1:20:19.380
 to the same sort of scenario that created the trauma.

1:20:19.380 --> 1:20:21.900
 And we did an entire episode on fear and trauma,

1:20:21.900 --> 1:20:23.740
 and I recommend you check out that episode.

1:20:23.740 --> 1:20:25.860
 It's easy to find, again, at hubermanlab.com.

1:20:25.860 --> 1:20:28.080
 It's on YouTube, Apple, Spotify, et cetera, et cetera.

1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:28.980
 Very easy to find.

1:20:28.980 --> 1:20:31.380
 And there, I talk all about trauma treatments

1:20:31.380 --> 1:20:33.260
 and the various kinds of trauma treatments

1:20:33.260 --> 1:20:36.140
 that are out there, their efficacy in different scenarios

1:20:36.140 --> 1:20:37.960
 and traumas and so on.

1:20:37.960 --> 1:20:40.660
 But the point I'd like to make now is that the reason

1:20:40.660 --> 1:20:43.380
 why children who experience a lot of trauma and stress

1:20:43.380 --> 1:20:46.180
 have limited plasticity later on

1:20:46.180 --> 1:20:48.920
 is because of the neurochemical substrates

1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:51.400
 that are created from trauma and stress,

1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:53.660
 because after all, stress is epinephrine

1:20:53.660 --> 1:20:54.880
 and epinephrine is stress.

1:20:54.880 --> 1:20:56.660
 Those are inseparable.

1:20:56.660 --> 1:20:59.380
 And the way in which it more or less shuts down

1:20:59.380 --> 1:21:02.100
 or at least inhibits, suppresses those play circuits.

1:21:02.100 --> 1:21:06.360
 And again, the reassuring thing is that by engaging in play

1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:09.420
 as adults, we can reactivate some of those circuits

1:21:09.420 --> 1:21:11.140
 and reopen the plasticity.

1:21:11.140 --> 1:21:14.700
 In fact, one very prominent trauma treatment now,

1:21:14.700 --> 1:21:17.220
 especially for people that have been subjected

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:20.340
 to very severe traumas in the ongoing sense,

1:21:20.340 --> 1:21:23.180
 meaning traumas that went on for many, many years,

1:21:23.180 --> 1:21:27.540
 is to get them to engage in play, in things like dance,

1:21:27.540 --> 1:21:30.820
 in basically getting them to engage their bodily movements

1:21:30.820 --> 1:21:32.620
 in ways that they would otherwise

1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:34.500
 not feel comfortable to engage in.

1:21:34.500 --> 1:21:36.620
 And I find this area so interesting

1:21:36.620 --> 1:21:38.500
 because on the face of it, you could say,

1:21:38.500 --> 1:21:41.100
 oh, that's kind of, is that really biomedical treatment?

1:21:41.100 --> 1:21:42.260
 You're taking people who are traumatized

1:21:42.260 --> 1:21:43.420
 and having them dance.

1:21:43.420 --> 1:21:45.440
 I mean, it seems kind of silly on the one hand,

1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:50.440
 depending on your particular orientation.

1:21:50.940 --> 1:21:54.520
 But on the other hand, it's actually quite profound

1:21:54.520 --> 1:21:57.560
 and quite grounded in the mechanisms

1:21:57.560 --> 1:21:59.420
 by which the brain circuits change.

1:21:59.420 --> 1:22:02.340
 So again, back to this original principle,

1:22:02.340 --> 1:22:05.660
 which is that play isn't just one portal to plasticity,

1:22:05.660 --> 1:22:08.820
 play is the fundamental portal to plasticity.

1:22:08.820 --> 1:22:11.820
 And that play and dance and exploration of novel movements,

1:22:11.820 --> 1:22:16.400
 exploration of novel athletic movements are the route

1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:20.900
 by which we access new ways of thinking, new contingencies.

1:22:20.900 --> 1:22:24.160
 And I find it wonderful that the trauma release

1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:27.080
 and the psychiatric and psychology community

1:22:27.080 --> 1:22:30.940
 are exploring things like play and dance

1:22:30.940 --> 1:22:34.260
 and other forms of reopening these circuits

1:22:34.260 --> 1:22:37.820
 because indeed we would all love for there to be

1:22:37.820 --> 1:22:40.300
 a magic pill by which trauma could be erased

1:22:40.300 --> 1:22:41.860
 and new memories could be laid down

1:22:41.860 --> 1:22:43.520
 or a device that could do that.

1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:46.740
 But frankly, if you ask me or a number of my colleagues

1:22:46.740 --> 1:22:48.740
 whether or not that's likely to happen anytime soon

1:22:48.740 --> 1:22:49.900
 in an effective way,

1:22:49.900 --> 1:22:51.880
 I think the short answer is going to be no,

1:22:51.880 --> 1:22:53.340
 that there are going to be chemicals

1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:57.220
 and things that can augment and support that process,

1:22:57.220 --> 1:22:59.980
 but that there's not going to be just a magic pill

1:22:59.980 --> 1:23:02.040
 that will suddenly reverse trauma altogether,

1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:03.880
 that it's always going to be a case

1:23:03.880 --> 1:23:06.540
 whereby shifts in neurochemical states

1:23:06.540 --> 1:23:07.760
 are going to have to be combined

1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:09.820
 with new ways of thinking and new behaviors.

1:23:09.820 --> 1:23:11.860
 And I find it wonderful and reassuring

1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:14.540
 that people are looking at play and play behavior

1:23:14.540 --> 1:23:18.620
 as a not just one tiny shard of possibility there,

1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:21.000
 but that it might actually be the main driver

1:23:21.000 --> 1:23:23.980
 and a highly productive lever by which

1:23:23.980 --> 1:23:25.980
 to rewire the traumatized brain.

1:23:25.980 --> 1:23:28.420
 So if you're like me, you might be thinking,

1:23:28.420 --> 1:23:31.220
 okay, I'm willing to be more playful.

1:23:31.220 --> 1:23:34.940
 I'm willing to explore play as a portal to plasticity

1:23:34.940 --> 1:23:39.260
 and that all makes good sense, but what should I play?

1:23:39.260 --> 1:23:40.520
 What should I do?

1:23:40.520 --> 1:23:42.980
 Well, we've already established

1:23:42.980 --> 1:23:44.620
 that you want to keep your adrenaline low.

1:23:44.620 --> 1:23:46.640
 You have to keep the stakes low enough

1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:48.560
 that you're not going to get totally consumed

1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:50.060
 by the outcome.

1:23:50.060 --> 1:23:52.340
 Now, for some people who are highly competitive,

1:23:52.340 --> 1:23:53.640
 that's going to be challenging.

1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:55.360
 And yet I don't want to make it seem

1:23:55.360 --> 1:23:57.680
 as if you can't be competitive during play.

1:23:57.680 --> 1:23:59.940
 There are many forms of competitive play

1:23:59.940 --> 1:24:03.380
 that because you are a competitive person,

1:24:03.380 --> 1:24:07.180
 allow you to derive great joy from that competitive play.

1:24:07.180 --> 1:24:10.060
 I have a friend who's particularly good at horseshoes.

1:24:10.060 --> 1:24:11.500
 I'm not particularly good at horseshoes,

1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:12.940
 but whenever we play horseshoes,

1:24:12.940 --> 1:24:17.540
 I can tell he's out there to crush me on horseshoes.

1:24:17.540 --> 1:24:19.940
 And it's just one of these things where I can tell

1:24:19.940 --> 1:24:22.400
 he derives great pleasure from crushing me

1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:23.980
 at a game of horseshoes.

1:24:23.980 --> 1:24:27.140
 I can't say because I haven't actually done the microdialysis

1:24:27.140 --> 1:24:29.380
 which is a way of extracting chemistry

1:24:29.380 --> 1:24:31.100
 from the brain in real time,

1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:34.380
 nor have I recorded from his brain or imaged it in a scanner

1:24:34.380 --> 1:24:36.660
 whether or not he has high levels of epinephrine

1:24:36.660 --> 1:24:39.020
 or low levels of epinephrine during those games of horseshoes

1:24:39.020 --> 1:24:40.980
 I suspect is low levels of epinephrine

1:24:40.980 --> 1:24:43.700
 and high levels of dopamine, especially when he wins.

1:24:43.700 --> 1:24:45.700
 And yes, he wins every time.

1:24:45.700 --> 1:24:49.300
 But the point is that you can be competitive during play

1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:52.260
 provided that you were enjoying yourself, okay?

1:24:52.260 --> 1:24:53.380
 You can be competitive

1:24:53.380 --> 1:24:56.020
 provided that you were enjoying yourself.

1:24:56.020 --> 1:24:58.500
 There are particular forms of play

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:01.860
 that lend themselves best to neuroplasticity.

1:25:01.860 --> 1:25:04.600
 And those particular forms of play, again,

1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:07.820
 are not designed to necessarily just engage the plasticity

1:25:07.820 --> 1:25:09.980
 that allows you to perform that behavior,

1:25:09.980 --> 1:25:13.220
 but rather to expand the number of possibilities

1:25:13.220 --> 1:25:16.540
 for your brain to change in general throughout life.

1:25:16.540 --> 1:25:19.020
 And the two major forms of those

1:25:19.020 --> 1:25:21.260
 for which there's good peer-reviewed research

1:25:21.260 --> 1:25:24.660
 is to engage in novel forms of movement,

1:25:24.660 --> 1:25:27.140
 including different speeds of movement.

1:25:27.140 --> 1:25:29.900
 So let's say, for instance, you're somebody who runs.

1:25:29.900 --> 1:25:30.860
 I happen to like running.

1:25:30.860 --> 1:25:33.120
 I try and run three times a week.

1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:35.440
 And generally when I run, I run forward.

1:25:35.440 --> 1:25:37.040
 I don't run backward, although recently,

1:25:37.040 --> 1:25:38.540
 because I've become very excited

1:25:38.540 --> 1:25:41.300
 about the work of so-called knees over toes guy.

1:25:41.300 --> 1:25:42.980
 His name is Ben Parker,

1:25:42.980 --> 1:25:45.700
 but he goes by knees over toes guy on Instagram.

1:25:45.700 --> 1:25:46.540
 I've never met him,

1:25:46.540 --> 1:25:49.120
 but we've exchanged a few messages back and forth.

1:25:49.120 --> 1:25:53.140
 And some of his practices involve walking backwards

1:25:53.140 --> 1:25:55.500
 or doing sled pulls backwards.

1:25:55.500 --> 1:25:57.760
 I found these to be very beneficial for my back

1:25:57.760 --> 1:26:00.260
 and for my anterior tibialis

1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:01.700
 and some things that have really helped

1:26:01.700 --> 1:26:03.920
 with my posture and so forth.

1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:05.540
 But in general, when I run, I run forward.

1:26:05.540 --> 1:26:07.300
 I don't tend to run backward that much.

1:26:07.300 --> 1:26:09.100
 And I might do that for a few minutes at the end,

1:26:09.100 --> 1:26:12.580
 but not so much throughout the entire run.

1:26:12.580 --> 1:26:15.540
 Running doesn't lend itself to a lot of novel forms

1:26:15.540 --> 1:26:17.180
 of movement, lateral movements.

1:26:17.180 --> 1:26:18.780
 So for you nerds out there,

1:26:18.780 --> 1:26:22.540
 the movement in the sagittal plane or angled movements,

1:26:22.540 --> 1:26:25.740
 but it does appear that things like dance or sports,

1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:29.140
 where you end up generating a lot of dynamic movements,

1:26:29.140 --> 1:26:30.100
 where there's jumping,

1:26:30.100 --> 1:26:32.060
 where there's movement at different angles,

1:26:32.060 --> 1:26:34.340
 where there's ducking, where there's leaping,

1:26:34.340 --> 1:26:36.920
 that basically involve a lot of dynamic movement

1:26:36.920 --> 1:26:39.100
 and aren't just strictly linear.

1:26:39.100 --> 1:26:42.640
 Those seem to open the portals for plasticity.

1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:46.420
 And that's because they mimic a lot of the brain circuitry

1:26:46.420 --> 1:26:48.500
 that is associated with play.

1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:49.940
 And the reason for that is the way

1:26:49.940 --> 1:26:51.460
 in which those dynamic movements

1:26:51.460 --> 1:26:53.340
 and movements of different speeds

1:26:53.340 --> 1:26:55.980
 engage the vestibular system, the balance system.

1:26:55.980 --> 1:26:57.960
 The vestibular system is in the inner ear,

1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:00.740
 relates to the cerebellum, which translate to mini brain.

1:27:00.740 --> 1:27:02.580
 You got a little mini brain in the back of your brain.

1:27:02.580 --> 1:27:06.220
 It brings together visual information in a very direct way.

1:27:06.220 --> 1:27:08.180
 I talked a lot about this in the episode

1:27:08.180 --> 1:27:09.580
 on how to learn faster.

1:27:09.580 --> 1:27:12.100
 So if you want to go in depth on how vestibular

1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:14.420
 and different types of motor movements can open plasticity,

1:27:14.420 --> 1:27:17.300
 I talk a little bit more, I should say a lot more there,

1:27:17.300 --> 1:27:21.020
 but suffice to say that engaging in play

1:27:21.020 --> 1:27:22.380
 that has a lot of dynamic movement

1:27:22.380 --> 1:27:24.540
 or movements of different speeds, things like dance,

1:27:24.540 --> 1:27:25.820
 things like sports, like soccer,

1:27:25.820 --> 1:27:27.980
 where you're moving in different dimensions,

1:27:27.980 --> 1:27:30.020
 that tends to be very conducive

1:27:30.020 --> 1:27:32.340
 to what we would call play-related circuitry,

1:27:32.340 --> 1:27:34.600
 provided you don't take it too seriously.

1:27:34.600 --> 1:27:36.940
 You don't get those high levels of epinephrine.

1:27:36.940 --> 1:27:39.540
 Now, for those of you that are also interested

1:27:39.540 --> 1:27:43.580
 in non-physical or non-athletic forms of play

1:27:43.580 --> 1:27:46.060
 that can really expand plasticity,

1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:47.500
 there's some very interesting research

1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:49.260
 about the game of chess.

1:27:49.260 --> 1:27:50.800
 I don't play the game of chess.

1:27:50.800 --> 1:27:51.900
 I've played a few times.

1:27:51.900 --> 1:27:53.900
 I confess I don't know how to move all the pieces,

1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:55.740
 so I'm not going to try and describe that here,

1:27:55.740 --> 1:27:56.980
 but I've always wanted to learn chess.

1:27:56.980 --> 1:27:59.340
 And I think after reading some of the peer reviewed research

1:27:59.340 --> 1:28:01.400
 about chess and play in neuroplasticity,

1:28:01.400 --> 1:28:02.880
 now I understand why.

1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:05.500
 There's a really nice paper that was published

1:28:05.500 --> 1:28:07.140
 in the International Journal of Research

1:28:07.140 --> 1:28:09.860
 and Education and Science in 2017.

1:28:09.860 --> 1:28:12.100
 And the title of this paper is,

1:28:12.100 --> 1:28:14.980
 is chess just a game or is it a mirror

1:28:14.980 --> 1:28:17.280
 that reflects a child's inner world?

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:21.620
 That's a very intense title for a biologist like me.

1:28:22.540 --> 1:28:24.780
 But this paper is so interesting

1:28:24.780 --> 1:28:26.480
 because what it really points to is the fact

1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:29.540
 that in a single game, chess,

1:28:29.540 --> 1:28:32.460
 you have, at least as I understand, two players,

1:28:32.460 --> 1:28:37.120
 and those two players are moving pieces on the chess board

1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:40.400
 for which each piece can do different things, right?

1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:42.520
 Can move in different ways under different scenarios,

1:28:42.520 --> 1:28:44.260
 but there are different rules for different pieces.

1:28:44.260 --> 1:28:46.580
 And so each player actually has to assume

1:28:46.580 --> 1:28:49.700
 multiple identities during the same game.

1:28:49.700 --> 1:28:52.140
 And each of those identities has different rules

1:28:52.140 --> 1:28:53.520
 and ways of interacting.

1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:56.340
 So in a way we can think of chess as one game,

1:28:56.340 --> 1:29:00.460
 but actually chess is a kind of a substrate

1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:03.780
 for exploring multiple roles for different characters.

1:29:03.780 --> 1:29:06.020
 And this is quite a bit different than, for instance,

1:29:06.020 --> 1:29:08.420
 video games where somebody has their favorite

1:29:08.420 --> 1:29:10.860
 video game player or they have an avatar

1:29:10.860 --> 1:29:12.300
 and they're always in the same role.

1:29:12.300 --> 1:29:13.620
 It's also quite a bit different

1:29:13.620 --> 1:29:15.460
 for when you engage in any kind of play

1:29:15.460 --> 1:29:16.540
 where you are yourself.

1:29:16.540 --> 1:29:18.660
 You're just being you in that game.

1:29:18.660 --> 1:29:22.760
 And so now I'm highly incentivized to explore chess.

1:29:22.760 --> 1:29:25.500
 You see quotes out there, for instance,

1:29:25.500 --> 1:29:29.060
 things like chess is life or jujitsu is life.

1:29:29.060 --> 1:29:31.500
 I always assumed that that meant

1:29:31.500 --> 1:29:33.500
 that someone's entire life was chess

1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:37.020
 or their entire life was jujitsu, for instance.

1:29:37.020 --> 1:29:40.900
 But in reading over the research about chess in particular,

1:29:40.900 --> 1:29:42.740
 but also certain forms of martial arts,

1:29:42.740 --> 1:29:44.240
 also certain forms of dance,

1:29:44.240 --> 1:29:48.500
 what one finds is that indeed those games are life

1:29:48.500 --> 1:29:52.900
 in the sense that they involve adopting multiple roles

1:29:52.900 --> 1:29:55.660
 and exploring contingencies in a number of different ways.

1:29:55.660 --> 1:29:58.500
 So there are some games that allow you to explore

1:29:58.500 --> 1:30:02.540
 a much vaster landscape of movements or of mental roles

1:30:02.540 --> 1:30:05.580
 or of ways of engaging in strategic movement

1:30:05.580 --> 1:30:07.300
 as is the case with chess.

1:30:07.300 --> 1:30:11.460
 And so when you hear that activity blank is life,

1:30:11.460 --> 1:30:14.020
 it often reflects the passion for that activity,

1:30:14.020 --> 1:30:15.500
 but I think looked at differently,

1:30:15.500 --> 1:30:18.620
 it also reflects the fact that that activity

1:30:18.620 --> 1:30:21.460
 is a portal through which you can explore life

1:30:21.460 --> 1:30:24.140
 through many, many different lenses.

1:30:24.140 --> 1:30:26.820
 And I think that that's especially powerful

1:30:26.820 --> 1:30:28.940
 in terms of thinking about how play can be leveraged

1:30:28.940 --> 1:30:29.940
 for plasticity.

1:30:29.940 --> 1:30:32.960
 So for those of you that are interested in leveraging play

1:30:32.960 --> 1:30:37.700
 for neuroplasticity and expanding your mind, if you will,

1:30:37.700 --> 1:30:40.180
 I highly recommend picking an activity

1:30:40.180 --> 1:30:42.800
 that will allow you to adopt different roles

1:30:42.800 --> 1:30:45.640
 within that activity, where it's not rigidly linear.

1:30:45.640 --> 1:30:49.080
 This is actually a way in which I start to depart

1:30:49.080 --> 1:30:53.820
 from this modern and important, but somewhat narrow idea

1:30:53.820 --> 1:30:57.420
 that exercise is the only route to plasticity.

1:30:57.420 --> 1:30:58.380
 Yes, it's true.

1:30:58.380 --> 1:31:01.660
 I have Nobel prize-winning colleagues that swim

1:31:01.660 --> 1:31:04.020
 for two miles a day and have done that for a long time.

1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:06.020
 And they will tell you, I always think more clearly

1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:09.660
 after my swimming and I certainly in my experience,

1:31:09.660 --> 1:31:11.240
 after a good run or a good workout,

1:31:11.240 --> 1:31:13.600
 my mind seems to work best,

1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:15.780
 unless of course that workout was very, very intense.

1:31:15.780 --> 1:31:16.820
 I've talked about this before.

1:31:16.820 --> 1:31:19.860
 If you do work out very, very hard in whether or not

1:31:19.860 --> 1:31:23.320
 it's aerobic or resistance training or sport of any kind,

1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:25.380
 your brain won't function as well afterwards,

1:31:25.380 --> 1:31:27.540
 mostly because of the diversion of oxygen

1:31:27.540 --> 1:31:29.860
 to tissues away from your brain.

1:31:29.860 --> 1:31:31.840
 You actually are getting less oxygen to your brain.

1:31:31.840 --> 1:31:33.860
 But in general, most of us feel that if we exercise

1:31:33.860 --> 1:31:36.100
 regularly, our brain functions better.

1:31:36.100 --> 1:31:40.260
 But there are activities that extend beyond linear exercise,

1:31:40.260 --> 1:31:43.020
 beyond just generating the same sets of movements

1:31:43.020 --> 1:31:45.380
 over and over again, whether or not it's exercise or not.

1:31:45.380 --> 1:31:47.340
 And that's really what play is.

1:31:47.340 --> 1:31:50.220
 Play is about dynamically exploring

1:31:50.220 --> 1:31:52.200
 different kinds of movements,

1:31:52.200 --> 1:31:54.540
 dynamically exploring different kinds of thoughts,

1:31:54.540 --> 1:31:57.740
 dynamically exploring different kinds of roles

1:31:57.740 --> 1:31:59.400
 that one could adopt.

1:31:59.400 --> 1:32:02.560
 And that is the way that the brain learns new things.

1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:04.580
 So I encourage you to explore chess.

1:32:04.580 --> 1:32:05.940
 I intend to learn chess this year.

1:32:05.940 --> 1:32:07.340
 I'm very excited to do that.

1:32:07.340 --> 1:32:09.140
 Now, if you already play chess

1:32:09.140 --> 1:32:11.060
 and you are an expert chess player,

1:32:11.060 --> 1:32:13.820
 you actually will derive less benefit

1:32:13.820 --> 1:32:16.940
 in terms of this play-induced neuroplasticity

1:32:16.940 --> 1:32:19.580
 than you would, for instance, if you went out and,

1:32:19.580 --> 1:32:20.980
 I don't know, played a game of soccer

1:32:20.980 --> 1:32:23.580
 or did something that was very novel for your nervous system

1:32:23.580 --> 1:32:26.860
 because in that novelty and in that exploration

1:32:26.860 --> 1:32:29.740
 of new behaviors and new ways of thinking,

1:32:29.740 --> 1:32:31.980
 you are opening the portal to plasticity.

1:32:31.980 --> 1:32:34.140
 Whereas in doing what you already know how to do

1:32:34.140 --> 1:32:37.100
 and trying just to perform better and better at it,

1:32:37.100 --> 1:32:38.740
 you will get better at chess.

1:32:38.740 --> 1:32:40.740
 But again, that's just chess.

1:32:40.740 --> 1:32:42.780
 You are not expanding the realms

1:32:42.780 --> 1:32:45.960
 in which you can become more plastic,

1:32:45.960 --> 1:32:49.420
 that you are able to learn new things in relationship,

1:32:49.420 --> 1:32:52.020
 in life, in finance, in friendship, et cetera.

1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:53.500
 In researching this episode,

1:32:53.500 --> 1:32:56.240
 one of the most interesting areas I discovered

1:32:56.240 --> 1:32:59.460
 was this notion of personal play identity.

1:32:59.460 --> 1:33:02.020
 Personal play identity is a term that,

1:33:02.020 --> 1:33:02.980
 at least to my knowledge,

1:33:02.980 --> 1:33:06.900
 was coined by a Turkish researcher by the name,

1:33:06.900 --> 1:33:09.020
 and forgive me, I'm going to mispronounce this,

1:33:09.020 --> 1:33:14.020
 is Gokhan Gunes, G-O-K-H-A-N,

1:33:14.020 --> 1:33:18.020
 last name, G-U-N-E-S, and forgive me, Gokhan.

1:33:18.020 --> 1:33:21.380
 And if we have any Turkish-speaking members of the audience,

1:33:21.380 --> 1:33:26.380
 please put the correction in the comment section on YouTube.

1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:28.980
 Make it phonetic so I can understand what it is.

1:33:28.980 --> 1:33:30.320
 Please, I'd love to correct it.

1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:32.460
 And apologies, or who knows?

1:33:32.460 --> 1:33:35.700
 If I got it right, then it was pure luck.

1:33:35.700 --> 1:33:39.660
 Gokhan Gunes has coined this term personal play identity.

1:33:39.660 --> 1:33:44.660
 And the key role that personal play identity establishes

1:33:44.660 --> 1:33:48.380
 in who we see ourselves as being,

1:33:48.380 --> 1:33:50.540
 and not just in the context of play.

1:33:50.540 --> 1:33:54.460
 Personal play identity has four well-defined dimensions.

1:33:54.460 --> 1:33:55.780
 And I should say that if you're interested

1:33:55.780 --> 1:33:56.840
 in learning more about this,

1:33:56.840 --> 1:34:01.540
 the paper that I found particularly informative

1:34:01.540 --> 1:34:04.180
 is published in Current Psychology,

1:34:04.180 --> 1:34:06.100
 and the title is Personal Play Identity

1:34:06.100 --> 1:34:09.260
 and the Fundamental Elements in its Developmental Process.

1:34:09.260 --> 1:34:11.060
 And the author, of course, is Gokhan Gunes,

1:34:11.060 --> 1:34:12.740
 G-U-N-E-S, last name.

1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:14.020
 This is from 2021.

1:34:14.020 --> 1:34:15.100
 So recent review.

1:34:16.540 --> 1:34:19.140
 There are four components to personal play identity.

1:34:20.420 --> 1:34:23.700
 How you play, your personality,

1:34:24.780 --> 1:34:27.680
 socioculture and environment.

1:34:27.680 --> 1:34:29.220
 So that's the third one that's together,

1:34:29.220 --> 1:34:32.840
 socioculture and environment, and economics and technology.

1:34:32.840 --> 1:34:34.460
 Now that sounds somewhat complex,

1:34:34.460 --> 1:34:35.940
 and this paper is somewhat complex,

1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:40.380
 but basically what it says is that we bring together

1:34:40.380 --> 1:34:42.380
 certain aspects of ourselves

1:34:42.380 --> 1:34:45.180
 and how we react to different play scenarios

1:34:45.180 --> 1:34:46.020
 when we're younger.

1:34:46.020 --> 1:34:48.380
 And we bring that forward into the world

1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:50.680
 in all contexts as adults.

1:34:50.680 --> 1:34:53.720
 To illustrate this, I'm going to ask you a question.

1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:57.000
 When you were a child, let's say 10 years old,

1:34:58.260 --> 1:35:01.320
 would you have considered yourself competitive?

1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:02.820
 Would you have considered yourself

1:35:02.820 --> 1:35:05.020
 somebody who's cooperative and realize, of course,

1:35:05.020 --> 1:35:06.980
 that those are not mutually exclusive?

1:35:06.980 --> 1:35:08.980
 You could be competitive and cooperative.

1:35:08.980 --> 1:35:10.620
 Would you consider yourself somebody

1:35:10.620 --> 1:35:12.580
 that preferred to play alone

1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:15.640
 or preferred to play with one or two close friends?

1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:17.860
 Or were you somebody that really enjoyed

1:35:17.860 --> 1:35:19.340
 playing in large groups?

1:35:20.540 --> 1:35:21.560
 Here's a key one.

1:35:21.560 --> 1:35:25.060
 Were you somebody that enjoyed playing the leader

1:35:25.060 --> 1:35:28.320
 in one moment and was equally okay

1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:30.980
 with being a follower at a later moment?

1:35:30.980 --> 1:35:33.340
 Were you okay with having your role switched

1:35:33.340 --> 1:35:35.180
 midway through a game?

1:35:35.180 --> 1:35:38.540
 Where do you get upset or be delighted

1:35:38.540 --> 1:35:41.180
 or not care at all about having to switch teams

1:35:41.180 --> 1:35:42.020
 during the middle of the game

1:35:42.020 --> 1:35:45.580
 because your team was winning to even things out?

1:35:45.580 --> 1:35:48.700
 You can imagine how that would play out internally.

1:35:48.700 --> 1:35:50.020
 You would immediately register

1:35:50.020 --> 1:35:51.380
 that you must be a valuable player

1:35:51.380 --> 1:35:53.060
 because you're being moved off the winning team

1:35:53.060 --> 1:35:55.280
 toward the losing team.

1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:56.960
 But then again, you're now being forced

1:35:56.960 --> 1:35:59.180
 to join the losing team.

1:35:59.180 --> 1:36:01.240
 How did you feel about that?

1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:02.980
 Were you somebody that was comfortable

1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:04.420
 with other people breaking rules

1:36:04.420 --> 1:36:09.100
 or perhaps even yourself breaking rules or bending rules?

1:36:09.100 --> 1:36:10.640
 Kind of be able to find term.

1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:13.080
 Or were you somebody that really needed

1:36:13.080 --> 1:36:14.040
 to know all the rules

1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:17.420
 and if everyone didn't rigidly adhere to those rules

1:36:17.420 --> 1:36:19.540
 was quite disturbed by that?

1:36:21.020 --> 1:36:22.740
 The number of questions goes on and on and on.

1:36:22.740 --> 1:36:24.340
 And I will provide a link to a paper

1:36:24.340 --> 1:36:26.580
 that asks a number of questions

1:36:26.580 --> 1:36:29.900
 that helps you arrive at a sort of score of sorts

1:36:29.900 --> 1:36:33.060
 or an index of what Gunes and others

1:36:33.060 --> 1:36:35.620
 have referred to as personal play identity.

1:36:35.620 --> 1:36:39.500
 The point is that if we look back to our early adolescence,

1:36:39.500 --> 1:36:42.500
 somewhere between 10 and 14 years old,

1:36:42.500 --> 1:36:45.180
 a peak time for social development,

1:36:45.180 --> 1:36:48.180
 a peak time for play of various kinds,

1:36:48.180 --> 1:36:50.660
 a peak time for motor development,

1:36:50.660 --> 1:36:54.060
 a peak time of psychosocial development

1:36:54.060 --> 1:36:56.320
 where we learn where we fit into hierarchies

1:36:56.320 --> 1:36:58.760
 as we relate to members of the same sex,

1:36:58.760 --> 1:37:00.320
 of the opposite sex, et cetera,

1:37:00.320 --> 1:37:04.080
 we can start to get a portal into how and why

1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:06.960
 we show up to various activities in work

1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:09.920
 and relationship, et cetera, as adults.

1:37:09.920 --> 1:37:14.000
 In fact, I'll venture to say that if we go into that process

1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:15.840
 for ourselves for five or 10 minutes,

1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:18.060
 you start to see some remarkable parallels

1:37:18.060 --> 1:37:20.400
 between the way you were at that stage

1:37:20.400 --> 1:37:24.080
 and your tendencies and your preferences as adults.

1:37:24.080 --> 1:37:26.840
 We tend to look at our early childhood experiences

1:37:26.840 --> 1:37:28.840
 and our families, and to some degree,

1:37:28.840 --> 1:37:32.840
 our friends in terms of how we become who we become.

1:37:33.780 --> 1:37:36.800
 I've talked about the incredible work of Alan Shore

1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:38.760
 on previous episodes of the podcast.

1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:43.100
 Alan Shore is a psychiatrist and has done extensive work

1:37:43.100 --> 1:37:45.440
 on how parent-child interactions,

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:47.200
 in particular baby and mother,

1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:50.960
 but also baby and father, shape the brain

1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:53.400
 and the brain and emotional systems ability

1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:56.160
 to go from states of elation and excitement,

1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:59.720
 the so-called dopamine epinephrine type circuitry,

1:37:59.720 --> 1:38:04.000
 to the more warm, soothing types of calm interactions

1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:07.280
 that in broad terms could be described as more serotonin,

1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:09.180
 oxytocin, and things of that sort.

1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:12.640
 That work really points to the key roles

1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:16.460
 that the caregiver and the child, you,

1:38:16.460 --> 1:38:18.300
 engaged in in early life.

1:38:18.300 --> 1:38:19.880
 And that is incredible work.

1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:23.120
 I do hope to host Dr. Shore on the podcast

1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:25.980
 at some point in the not too distant future.

1:38:25.980 --> 1:38:28.120
 But equally important, of course,

1:38:28.120 --> 1:38:30.360
 are the interactions that we export

1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:34.040
 from that early laying down of biological circuitry

1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:35.800
 and psychological circuitry

1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:38.320
 to the way we play by ourselves

1:38:38.320 --> 1:38:40.020
 and the way we play with others,

1:38:41.080 --> 1:38:43.240
 in small numbers or in great numbers.

1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:45.680
 And of course it would be the case

1:38:45.680 --> 1:38:48.560
 that how we played as a 10 or 12-year-old

1:38:48.560 --> 1:38:51.040
 would impact how we behave as a 16-year-old

1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:53.240
 and as a 20-year-old and as a 30-year-old

1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:55.440
 and so on and so on.

1:38:55.440 --> 1:38:58.220
 One of my favorite things about developmental biology

1:38:58.220 --> 1:38:59.820
 and developmental psychology

1:38:59.820 --> 1:39:01.400
 is that it is grounded in the fact

1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:04.360
 that we don't just have a childhood and an adulthood.

1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:07.080
 There isn't just our child self and our adult self.

1:39:07.080 --> 1:39:09.840
 And even though there are transitions around the mechanisms

1:39:09.840 --> 1:39:13.360
 that underlie neuroplasticity at approximately age 25,

1:39:14.720 --> 1:39:17.440
 it is simply the case that development

1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:19.000
 is our entire lifespan,

1:39:19.000 --> 1:39:22.540
 that our lifespan is one long developmental arc.

1:39:22.540 --> 1:39:25.840
 How long depends on our genetics, our lifestyle,

1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:28.680
 accidents, injury, and disease, of course,

1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:31.560
 but it is one long developmental arc.

1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:33.280
 And so it shouldn't surprise us at all

1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:36.120
 that how we learn to play as a 10-year-old or 12-year-old

1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:39.040
 would impact how we play and interact with people

1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:42.360
 as a teenager and a young adult and on and on and on.

1:39:43.880 --> 1:39:46.680
 And that play is the place in which we explore

1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:48.040
 and which we learn.

1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:51.840
 Play is the substrate by which our nervous system changes us

1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:55.520
 from this hyper-connected batch of neurons

1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:58.900
 where everything is connected to everything, more or less,

1:39:58.900 --> 1:40:01.800
 to a brain and nervous system

1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:05.400
 whereby certain circuits work with immense proficiency

1:40:05.400 --> 1:40:07.800
 and others are less accessible to us.

1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:11.120
 But again, the wonderful thing about the human nervous system

1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:16.120
 is that because it is plastic for the entire lifespan

1:40:16.600 --> 1:40:19.300
 and because these two elements of focus and rest

1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:21.960
 can be deployed again and again and again,

1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:23.960
 just because neural circuits didn't form

1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:26.960
 does not mean that they can't form later in life.

1:40:26.960 --> 1:40:31.000
 And today we've been focusing on how play itself,

1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:33.340
 the same substrate that we use during development

1:40:33.340 --> 1:40:34.920
 to become who we are,

1:40:34.920 --> 1:40:37.500
 is the portal by which we can change who we are

1:40:37.500 --> 1:40:38.520
 for the better.

1:40:38.520 --> 1:40:40.400
 So I hope I've convinced you that play

1:40:40.400 --> 1:40:43.120
 is an extremely important fundamental

1:40:43.120 --> 1:40:46.360
 homeostatically regulated aspect of our nervous system,

1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:50.060
 which is just a mouthful of nerd speak to say,

1:40:50.060 --> 1:40:52.560
 play can change your brain for the better.

1:40:52.560 --> 1:40:55.240
 And that is true for every stage of life.

1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:57.060
 The recommendation that I make,

1:40:57.060 --> 1:40:59.720
 and certainly the one that I'm going to direct it myself

1:40:59.720 --> 1:41:04.320
 as well, is to try and engage in at least one hour

1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:06.620
 of pure play per week.

1:41:06.620 --> 1:41:08.800
 Now, I came to that recommendation

1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:11.160
 because of the literature that says,

1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:14.340
 well, you need to engage in something pretty repetitively.

1:41:14.340 --> 1:41:15.560
 It should be novel.

1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:16.760
 So this wouldn't be something

1:41:16.760 --> 1:41:19.400
 that you are exceptionally good at already.

1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:21.120
 If you insist on doing something

1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:23.080
 that you're already exceptionally good at,

1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:25.860
 then you want to really do some free form,

1:41:25.860 --> 1:41:27.560
 low stakes tinkering.

1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:30.760
 So make it safe, but make it free form.

1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:32.760
 So really explore things with that.

1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:34.480
 Some people call this beginner's mind,

1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:36.040
 although I find that a little abstract.

1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:37.440
 I like the notion of beginner's mind,

1:41:37.440 --> 1:41:38.260
 but it's sort of like,

1:41:38.260 --> 1:41:39.640
 how do you know if you're in beginner's mind?

1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:41.960
 I think beginner's mind is sort of the expectation

1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:44.240
 that you're not going to do it well yet,

1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:47.120
 but play extends beyond beginner's mind.

1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:49.240
 Play is really about not even worrying

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:50.620
 if you're going to get good at it

1:41:50.620 --> 1:41:52.120
 or really proficient at it.

1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:54.720
 It's really about exploring contingencies

1:41:54.720 --> 1:41:56.240
 with truly low stakes.

1:41:56.240 --> 1:41:57.960
 That's what will allow you to access

1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:00.000
 these neurochemical combinations

1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:03.160
 of elevated endogenous opioids, low epinephrine, et cetera,

1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:05.560
 that will open up neuroplasticity.

1:42:05.560 --> 1:42:07.360
 For those of you that need a little more guidance

1:42:07.360 --> 1:42:10.080
 on how to play, there's a book out there.

1:42:10.080 --> 1:42:12.560
 I actually learned about this from Tim Ferriss' blog.

1:42:12.560 --> 1:42:15.800
 It's called Play It Away, A Workaholic's Cure for Anxiety.

1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:17.140
 So that's more focused on anxiety.

1:42:17.140 --> 1:42:22.140
 The author is Charlie Hone, last name H-O-E-H-N.

1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:24.360
 We'll provide a link for it in the show notes and caption,

1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:27.620
 Play It Away, A Workaholic's Cure for Anxiety.

1:42:27.620 --> 1:42:30.920
 But books and other resources aside,

1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:32.800
 I think one hour of play per week

1:42:32.800 --> 1:42:34.960
 is a reasonable amount of time

1:42:34.960 --> 1:42:37.760
 to engage in dedicated play behavior

1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:40.760
 for the purpose of opening up these neural circuits

1:42:40.760 --> 1:42:42.440
 for plasticity.

1:42:42.440 --> 1:42:43.540
 The key feature, of course,

1:42:43.540 --> 1:42:47.200
 is to not have immense proficiency in that given activity,

1:42:47.200 --> 1:42:49.040
 or at least not the way you perform it.

1:42:49.040 --> 1:42:52.280
 And if you do gain proficiency in that activity,

1:42:52.280 --> 1:42:53.600
 well, then it becomes something else.

1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:56.600
 It's no longer about play, it's about performance.

1:42:56.600 --> 1:42:57.520
 So in that case,

1:42:57.520 --> 1:43:00.700
 you would then want to adopt a new play behavior.

1:43:00.700 --> 1:43:02.320
 You'll notice that I largely avoided

1:43:02.320 --> 1:43:05.020
 using the word fun throughout this episode.

1:43:05.020 --> 1:43:06.880
 Fun is a somewhat abstract term,

1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:11.600
 and like many emotions and many verbal descriptions

1:43:11.600 --> 1:43:13.840
 of experience, it falls short

1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:17.880
 in the context of a neurobiological discussion about play.

1:43:17.880 --> 1:43:19.660
 If you have fun, terrific.

1:43:19.660 --> 1:43:21.240
 Some people might find, however,

1:43:21.240 --> 1:43:23.740
 that engaging in play is kind of uncomfortable.

1:43:23.740 --> 1:43:24.800
 Well, there your goal then

1:43:24.800 --> 1:43:26.920
 should be to lower your level of discomfort

1:43:26.920 --> 1:43:29.000
 by focusing less on the outcomes

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.020
 and just simply engaging in the behavior

1:43:31.020 --> 1:43:34.040
 because, well, I'm telling you that it's good for you,

1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:36.080
 but hopefully you will tell yourself that it's good for you

1:43:36.080 --> 1:43:38.680
 and that you will experience that it's good for you.

1:43:38.680 --> 1:43:41.700
 The literature certainly points to that,

1:43:41.700 --> 1:43:44.340
 and the literature certainly points to the fact

1:43:44.340 --> 1:43:46.760
 that play is the way that we are built.

1:43:46.760 --> 1:43:48.620
 We are built to play.

1:43:48.620 --> 1:43:51.780
 We have brain circuits from back to front

1:43:51.780 --> 1:43:54.140
 and within our body that are there for play,

1:43:54.140 --> 1:43:55.280
 and they don't disappear.

1:43:55.280 --> 1:43:57.180
 They do not get pruned away

1:43:57.180 --> 1:43:59.200
 as we go from development to adulthood.

1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:02.060
 So if ever you needed a neurobiological explanation

1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:04.860
 for why play is important throughout the lifespan,

1:44:04.860 --> 1:44:05.900
 it's that.

1:44:05.900 --> 1:44:08.700
 It's that biology does not waste resources.

1:44:08.700 --> 1:44:10.280
 It's extremely efficient.

1:44:10.280 --> 1:44:13.060
 And were the circuits for play

1:44:13.060 --> 1:44:14.800
 not to be important in adulthood,

1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:16.100
 they would have been pruned away,

1:44:16.100 --> 1:44:17.660
 but I guarantee you they are there

1:44:17.660 --> 1:44:19.740
 in your brain and nervous system now.

1:44:19.740 --> 1:44:20.720
 They will be there tomorrow,

1:44:20.720 --> 1:44:22.320
 and they will be there going forward.

1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:25.940
 So my suggestion is that you use them one hour per week.

1:44:25.940 --> 1:44:28.480

 That's the best way to support this podcast.

1:44:57.660 --> 1:44:59.100
 We also have a Patreon.

1:44:59.100 --> 1:45:02.200
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:45:02.200 --> 1:45:03.820
 And there you can support the podcast

1:45:03.820 --> 1:45:05.820
 at any level that you like.

1:45:05.820 --> 1:45:08.460
 If you're not already following us on Twitter and Instagram,

1:45:08.460 --> 1:45:09.880
 we are Huberman Lab on Twitter

1:45:09.880 --> 1:45:12.680
 and also Huberman Lab on Instagram.

1:45:12.680 --> 1:45:15.960
 On Instagram, I do short posts that are related

1:45:15.960 --> 1:45:17.940
 to topics covered on the podcast,

1:45:17.940 --> 1:45:19.580
 but also some additional topics.

1:45:19.580 --> 1:45:21.840
 So these would include science-based tools

1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:23.940
 for things like focus, for sleep, for learning,

1:45:23.940 --> 1:45:25.820
 and many other topics as well.

1:45:25.820 --> 1:45:28.520
 In previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,

1:45:28.520 --> 1:45:30.380
 we often refer to supplements.

1:45:30.380 --> 1:45:33.540
 Now supplements aren't necessary or correct for everybody,

1:45:33.540 --> 1:45:36.100
 but many people derive tremendous benefit from them

1:45:36.100 --> 1:45:39.020
 for things like sleep and focus and so on.

1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:42.100
 We've partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-I-N-E,

1:45:42.100 --> 1:45:44.900
 because Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality

1:45:44.900 --> 1:45:46.580
 in terms of the ingredients they use

1:45:46.580 --> 1:45:49.740
 and the specificity of the amounts of the ingredients

1:45:49.740 --> 1:45:51.020
 that are listed on the bottle

1:45:51.020 --> 1:45:53.380
 are actually what is in those bottles,

1:45:53.380 --> 1:45:56.220
 which is not the case for many supplement brands out there.

1:45:56.220 --> 1:45:58.220
 If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take,

1:45:58.220 --> 1:46:01.980
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:46:01.980 --> 1:46:06.980
 So that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:10.660
 And those supplements you can purchase at 20% off.

1:46:10.660 --> 1:46:13.060
 And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

1:46:13.060 --> 1:46:14.900
 through that URL portal,

1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:17.600
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:18.580
 that Thorne makes.

1:46:18.580 --> 1:46:21.120
 Thank you once again for joining me for this discussion

1:46:21.120 --> 1:46:23.700
 about the incredible biology and psychology

1:46:23.700 --> 1:46:26.620
 and power of this thing that we call play.

1:46:26.620 --> 1:46:28.860
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:30.620
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:46:30.620 --> 1:46:32.620
 I'll see you next time.
