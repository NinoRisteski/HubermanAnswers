00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.180 --> 00:11.820
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:11.820 --> 00:14.980
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.560
 Today, we are going to discuss the science and practice

00:17.560 --> 00:19.740
 of flexibility and stretching.

00:19.740 --> 00:22.000
 Flexibility and stretching are topics that I believe

00:22.000 --> 00:25.340
 do not receive nearly as much attention as they deserve.

00:25.340 --> 00:27.680
 For most people, the topics of flexibility and stretching

00:27.680 --> 00:31.080
 bring to mind things like yoga, injury prevention,

00:31.080 --> 00:33.000
 or maybe even contortionism.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.300
 But it turns out that flexibility and stretching

00:35.300 --> 00:39.060
 are features that are built into our basic body plan.

00:39.060 --> 00:42.240
 Young children, young animals, and adults,

00:42.240 --> 00:45.720
 and indeed older children and animals all stretch

00:45.720 --> 00:48.640
 and all have some degree of flexibility.

00:48.640 --> 00:51.220
 It turns out that having flexibility and our ability

00:51.220 --> 00:53.820
 to stretch and the interaction between stretching

00:53.820 --> 00:57.680
 and flexibility are fundamental to how we move,

00:57.680 --> 01:01.080
 our ability to learn new movements, indeed also

01:01.080 --> 01:04.140
 to prevent injury or repair injuries,

01:04.140 --> 01:07.080
 and to offsetting and reducing inflammation

01:07.080 --> 01:07.920
 throughout the body.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.400
 In fact, today I'm going to share with you a remarkable set

01:10.400 --> 01:13.120
 of studies that show that stretching can actually

01:13.120 --> 01:15.560
 adjust things like tumor growth.

01:15.560 --> 01:17.720
 This is work that was done by one of the major directors

01:17.720 --> 01:19.640
 of the National Institutes of Health.

01:19.640 --> 01:22.040
 So today's discussion will start with a description

01:22.040 --> 01:25.880
 of the mechanisms, literally the cells and the connections

01:25.880 --> 01:28.180
 from your nervous system that mediate flexibility

01:28.180 --> 01:29.020
 and stretching.

01:29.020 --> 01:31.160
 And I promise that I'll make that information accessible

01:31.160 --> 01:34.820
 to you, whether or not you have a biology background or not.

01:34.820 --> 01:36.640
 Then with that information in hand,

01:36.640 --> 01:38.760
 I'm going to present to you what the scientific literature

01:38.760 --> 01:41.980
 says about the best times and ways to stretch.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.800
 Everything right down to the detail of how long

01:43.800 --> 01:46.600
 to hold a stretch, whether or not to hold a stretch at all,

01:46.600 --> 01:49.160
 because it turns out there are multiple kinds of stretching.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.680
 So you can imagine you have stretches where you hold

01:51.680 --> 01:54.240
 the stretch for a very long time and use as little momentum

01:54.240 --> 01:55.120
 as possible.

01:55.120 --> 01:56.980
 And then there's also what's called dynamic

01:56.980 --> 01:57.920
 and ballistic stretching,

01:57.920 --> 01:59.720
 where you're literally swinging your limbs,

01:59.720 --> 02:01.680
 trying to increase the range of motion.

02:01.680 --> 02:04.120
 I will explain the science and application of flexibility

02:04.120 --> 02:07.280
 and stretching in the context of sports performance,

02:07.280 --> 02:09.920
 whether or not you're engaging in cardiovascular exercise

02:09.920 --> 02:12.440
 or resistance exercise or both,

02:12.440 --> 02:13.920
 whether or not you're a competitive athlete

02:13.920 --> 02:17.360
 or simply a recreational exerciser as I am,

02:17.360 --> 02:19.960
 whether or not you are trying to increase your range

02:19.960 --> 02:22.520
 of motion and flexibility for longevity purposes,

02:22.520 --> 02:25.440
 or whether or not you're trying to do it in order to access

02:25.440 --> 02:26.700
 different parts of your nervous system,

02:26.700 --> 02:29.560
 because we'll soon learn today that your ability

02:29.560 --> 02:33.200
 to improve flexibility and need to engage

02:33.200 --> 02:36.240
 in specific stretching exercises can actually be used

02:36.240 --> 02:39.240
 to powerfully modulate your ability to tolerate pain,

02:39.240 --> 02:41.320
 both emotional and physical pain.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.000
 So this thing that we call flexibility and stretching

02:44.000 --> 02:45.760
 is actually a vast landscape.

02:45.760 --> 02:48.400
 We're going to simplify and organize all that for you today.

02:48.400 --> 02:50.080
 And by the end of today's episode,

02:50.080 --> 02:51.960
 you're going to have a number of simple,

02:51.960 --> 02:53.860
 easy to apply tools that are grounded

02:53.860 --> 02:55.440
 in the best scientific research

02:55.440 --> 02:58.040
 that you can apply for your specific goals.

02:58.040 --> 02:58.880
 Before we begin,

02:58.880 --> 03:01.280
 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate

03:01.280 --> 03:03.740
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:03.740 --> 03:05.900
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

03:05.900 --> 03:08.680
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:08.680 --> 03:11.620
 and science related tools to the general public.

03:11.620 --> 03:12.680
 In keeping with that theme,

03:12.680 --> 03:15.480
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:15.480 --> 03:17.520
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.860
 Thesis makes custom nootropics that are designed

03:19.860 --> 03:22.360
 to get your brain and body into the optimal state

03:22.360 --> 03:24.240
 for the cognitive and physical things

03:24.240 --> 03:27.240
 that you need to perform at the highest level.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.480
 I have to confess, in fact, I've said it many times before,

03:29.480 --> 03:31.240
 I am not a fan of the word nootropics

03:31.240 --> 03:33.160
 because it means smart drugs.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.360
 And frankly, as a neuroscientist,

03:35.360 --> 03:37.120
 I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge

03:37.120 --> 03:38.740
 that there's really no circuit in your brain

03:38.740 --> 03:39.760
 for being smart.

03:39.760 --> 03:41.800
 You have neural circuits in your brain

03:41.800 --> 03:44.020
 that are designed to get you to focus very well

03:44.020 --> 03:47.440
 or to task switch very well, or to be creative.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.660
 Thesis understands this, and as a consequence,

03:49.660 --> 03:51.700
 they've designed nootropics that are tailored

03:51.700 --> 03:55.160
 to your specific needs in the cognitive and physical realm.

03:55.160 --> 03:57.920
 What I mean by that is if you go to the Thesis site,

03:57.920 --> 03:59.400
 you fill out a short quiz,

03:59.400 --> 04:02.060
 and they'll give you the opportunity to try a small kit

04:02.060 --> 04:04.280
 of different nootropics with different ingredients.

04:04.280 --> 04:07.000
 You have the opportunity to try several different blends

04:07.000 --> 04:07.980
 over the course of the month

04:07.980 --> 04:09.760
 and discover which nootropics work best

04:09.760 --> 04:12.460
 for your unique brain chemistry and genetics.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.360
 I've been using Thesis for about eight and a half months now

04:15.360 --> 04:17.840
 and I can confidently say that their nootropics have been

04:17.840 --> 04:19.200
 a game changer.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.180
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

04:21.180 --> 04:24.700
 you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.280
 There you'll find that three minute quiz

04:26.280 --> 04:28.080
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

04:28.080 --> 04:29.200
 to try in your first month.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.600
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

04:35.720 --> 04:38.980
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

04:38.980 --> 04:41.460
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:41.460 --> 04:44.180
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

04:44.180 --> 04:45.760
 to help you better understand your body

04:45.760 --> 04:47.920
 and help you reach your health goals.

04:47.920 --> 04:50.720
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

04:50.720 --> 04:53.240
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

04:53.240 --> 04:55.800
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

04:55.800 --> 04:59.120
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

04:59.120 --> 05:02.120
 One issue with a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there

05:02.120 --> 05:04.880
 is that you get information back about hormone levels,

05:04.880 --> 05:07.040
 metabolic factors, et cetera,

05:07.040 --> 05:09.000
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

05:09.000 --> 05:13.020
 Inside Tracker has a very easy to use personalized platform

05:13.020 --> 05:14.840
 that lets you look at those numbers

05:14.840 --> 05:17.080
 and then you can literally move your cursor

05:17.080 --> 05:20.520
 over those numbers and there are little pop-up windows

05:20.520 --> 05:22.400
 that will tell you the things that you can do

05:22.400 --> 05:26.240
 in terms of lifestyle, so exercise and nutrition,

05:26.240 --> 05:28.440
 supplementation and so on to bring those numbers

05:28.440 --> 05:30.640
 into the ranges that are optimal for you.

05:30.640 --> 05:33.560
 So it really takes all the guesswork out of what to do

05:33.560 --> 05:36.640
 with that blood work and DNA information.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.080

05:53.040 --> 05:55.880
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.600
 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

05:57.600 --> 06:00.480
 that have cooling, heating and sleep tracking capacity.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.240
 And indeed you can dial in,

06:02.240 --> 06:04.560
 you can literally program the temperature

06:04.560 --> 06:07.080
 of your sleeping environment from the time you go to sleep

06:07.080 --> 06:09.280
 until the time you wake up in the morning.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.240
 This turns out to be immensely powerful

06:11.240 --> 06:13.880
 because as I've talked about on the podcast before,

06:13.880 --> 06:16.360
 in order to fall asleep and stay deeply asleep

06:16.360 --> 06:17.600
 throughout the night,

06:17.600 --> 06:21.040
 your body has to drop by about one to three degrees

06:21.040 --> 06:24.280
 and waking up in the morning actually involves a warming up

06:24.280 --> 06:26.120
 of your body temperature.

06:26.120 --> 06:29.000
 For many people, they just can't precisely control

06:29.000 --> 06:30.380
 their sleep environment well enough

06:30.380 --> 06:32.240
 in order for all that to go well.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.600
 I was one such person, so for a long time,

06:34.600 --> 06:35.900
 I'd fall asleep pretty easily,

06:35.900 --> 06:37.900
 but then I'd wake up in the middle of the night.

06:37.900 --> 06:39.360
 I tended to run warm,

06:39.360 --> 06:41.720
 but then sometimes I'd feel really tired in the morning

06:41.720 --> 06:43.320
 as if I couldn't wake up.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.720
 I started sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover.

06:45.720 --> 06:48.320
 I programmed it so that the temperature would be rather cool

06:48.320 --> 06:50.640
 in the early part of the evening when I would get into bed

06:50.640 --> 06:53.360
 and then would drop into the deeper phases of the night

06:53.360 --> 06:55.240
 when I was entering deep sleep

06:55.240 --> 06:57.320
 and then wrap an eye movement sleep

06:57.320 --> 06:58.920
 and then would warm towards morning,

06:58.920 --> 07:00.120
 it would help me wake up quickly.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.760
 And as a consequence, I'm sleeping throughout the night now

07:02.760 --> 07:05.140
 and I'm waking up feeling completely refreshed.

07:05.140 --> 07:07.140
 If you'd like to try an Eight Sleep mattress cover,

07:07.140 --> 07:09.960

07:22.680 --> 07:25.480
 Let's talk about flexibility and stretching.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.240
 Before we talk about the practices

07:27.240 --> 07:29.100
 of flexibility and stretching,

07:29.100 --> 07:30.800
 I'd like to just highlight some of the features

07:30.800 --> 07:33.040
 that are already built into your nervous system

07:33.040 --> 07:36.560
 and into your body that allow you to be flexible.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.880
 Some of us feel tighter than others,

07:38.880 --> 07:41.960
 sometimes in specific limbs or areas of our body.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.400
 Some people feel really loose and limber.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.740
 Some people even have what's called a hyper flexibility.

07:47.740 --> 07:50.380
 I, for instance, have a relative that can take her fingers

07:50.380 --> 07:53.400
 and bend them back to the point where they touch her wrist.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.060
 And it always makes me cringe a little bit,

07:56.060 --> 07:57.460
 but she can do that without any pain.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.520
 She seems to have some hyper flexibility in her joints.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.280
 I do not have that feature.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.120
 Some of you may find that you are more flexible

08:03.120 --> 08:04.480
 than others naturally.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.440
 And some of you might be thinking,

08:06.440 --> 08:08.920
 you don't need to build in additional flexibility.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.640
 Well, I think by the end of today's episode,

08:11.640 --> 08:14.240
 you'll realize that almost all of us can benefit

08:14.240 --> 08:17.240
 from having some sort of understanding about flexibility

08:17.240 --> 08:19.380
 and having some stretching protocol

08:19.380 --> 08:21.400
 that we incorporate into our life,

08:21.400 --> 08:24.520
 if not just for physical performance reasons

08:24.520 --> 08:26.020
 and for postural reasons,

08:26.020 --> 08:29.560
 then also for cognitive and mental reasons.

08:29.560 --> 08:32.080
 And I'll be sure to clarify what all of that means.

08:33.040 --> 08:34.240
 Right now, I'd like to take a moment

08:34.240 --> 08:37.380
 and just highlight the flexibility that you already have.

08:37.380 --> 08:40.420
 For instance, if you were to move your arm

08:40.420 --> 08:42.120
 behind your torso a little bit,

08:42.120 --> 08:44.320
 and then sort of let go

08:44.320 --> 08:47.560
 or stop exerting any effort in doing that,

08:47.560 --> 08:49.480
 you would find that the limb would return

08:49.480 --> 08:51.560
 more or less to a position next to your torso.

08:51.560 --> 08:53.300
 At least I would hope so.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.440
 Now, why is that?

08:54.440 --> 08:56.020
 Well, it turns out that there are aspects

08:56.020 --> 08:57.360
 of your nervous system,

08:57.360 --> 09:00.160
 aspects of your skeletal system,

09:00.160 --> 09:01.920
 aspects of your muscles,

09:01.920 --> 09:04.120
 and aspects of the connective tissue

09:04.120 --> 09:06.680
 that binds all of that together,

09:06.680 --> 09:10.520
 that try and restore a particular order or position

09:10.520 --> 09:14.260
 to your limbs and your limbs relative to one another.

09:14.260 --> 09:17.540
 So that reflects a very specific set of processes

09:17.540 --> 09:20.080
 that it turns out are the same set of processes

09:20.080 --> 09:21.400
 that you use when you are trying

09:21.400 --> 09:24.100
 to enhance flexibility and stretching.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.800
 So I'd like to just take a moment

09:25.800 --> 09:29.840
 and review the basic elements of nervous system,

09:29.840 --> 09:34.640
 muscle, connective tissue, and skeletal tissue, bone,

09:34.640 --> 09:38.040
 that allow for flexibility and stretching.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.840
 And here we can point to two major mechanisms

09:40.840 --> 09:44.520
 by which your nervous system, neurons, meaning nerve cells,

09:44.520 --> 09:46.520
 communicate with muscles,

09:46.520 --> 09:50.200
 and those muscles communicate back to your nervous system

09:50.200 --> 09:52.840
 to make sure that your limbs don't stretch too far,

09:52.840 --> 09:56.500
 they don't move too far such that you get injured.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.680
 And in addition to that,

09:58.680 --> 10:01.800
 mechanisms that ensure that you don't overload your muscles

10:01.800 --> 10:05.160
 too much with weight or with tension or with effort

10:05.160 --> 10:06.680
 and damage them that way.

10:06.680 --> 10:09.800
 Because it turns out that the second security mechanism

10:09.800 --> 10:11.920
 of making sure that you don't overload muscles

10:11.920 --> 10:14.960
 can be leveraged toward increasing your flexibility

10:14.960 --> 10:16.640
 almost immediately.

10:16.640 --> 10:17.480
 That's right.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.400
 There are protocols and tools that I'll share with you

10:19.400 --> 10:22.060
 that are going to allow you to vastly improve

10:22.060 --> 10:24.960
 your flexibility over time,

10:24.960 --> 10:26.740
 but there are also mechanisms that allow you

10:26.740 --> 10:30.880
 to quite significantly increase your degree of flexibility

10:30.880 --> 10:34.360
 in a very short period of time, within just a few seconds.

10:34.360 --> 10:38.400
 So let's establish some of the basic biological mechanisms.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.920
 In time we talk about biology or physiology,

10:40.920 --> 10:42.520
 we're going to talk about structure,

10:42.520 --> 10:44.200
 meaning the cells and their connections,

10:44.200 --> 10:46.300
 and functions, what they do.

10:46.300 --> 10:47.900
 They're just a few names to understand,

10:47.900 --> 10:50.240
 you do not have to memorize these names.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.080
 The important thing that I'd like you to know

10:52.080 --> 10:54.560
 is that flexibility and the process of stretching

10:54.560 --> 10:58.780
 and getting more flexible involves three major components.

10:58.780 --> 11:01.200
 Neural, meaning of the nervous system,

11:01.200 --> 11:04.280
 muscular, muscles, and connective tissue.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.840
 Connective tissue is the stuff that surrounds

11:06.840 --> 11:09.400
 the neural stuff and the muscular stuff,

11:09.400 --> 11:11.080
 although it's all kind of weaved together

11:11.080 --> 11:13.340
 and braided together in complicated ways.

11:13.340 --> 11:14.980
 Some of you may have heard of fascia.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.720
 We're going to talk a little bit about fascia today,

11:16.720 --> 11:18.980
 although it's such an interesting tissue

11:18.980 --> 11:21.840
 that's really deserving of its own episode.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.000
 Facial tissue, we're going to talk about

11:24.000 --> 11:25.920
 some of the stuff that surrounds muscles

11:25.920 --> 11:27.400
 that really gives you your shape

11:27.400 --> 11:28.680
 and holds everything together

11:28.680 --> 11:31.440
 and allows for flexibility to occur.

11:31.440 --> 11:33.720
 So here's a key thing that everyone should know,

11:33.720 --> 11:37.120
 whether or not you're talking about flexibility or not.

11:37.120 --> 11:40.200
 Your nervous system controls your muscles.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.760
 It's what gets your muscles to contract.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.280
 So within your spinal cord,

11:44.280 --> 11:46.900
 you have a category of neurons, nerve cells,

11:46.900 --> 11:48.940
 that are called motor neurons.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.160
 To be precise, they are lower motor neurons

11:51.160 --> 11:53.480
 because they're in your spinal cord.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.040
 We call them lower to distinguish them

11:55.040 --> 11:57.680
 from the motor neurons that are in your brain

11:57.680 --> 11:58.880
 up in your skull.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.920
 Those lower motor neurons,

12:01.920 --> 12:04.820
 hereafter, I'll just refer to them as motor neurons.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.680
 If I want to talk about the other kind of motor neurons,

12:06.680 --> 12:07.720
 I'll say upper motor neurons.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.760
 So if I say motor neurons,

12:08.760 --> 12:10.860
 I just mean the ones in your spinal cord.

12:10.860 --> 12:14.200
 Those motor neurons send a little wire

12:14.200 --> 12:17.020
 or set of wires out to your muscles,

12:17.020 --> 12:20.400
 and that creates what's called a neuromuscular junction,

12:20.400 --> 12:22.340
 which just means that the neurons meet the muscles

12:22.340 --> 12:23.880
 at a particular place.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.880
 Those neurons release a chemical.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.860
 That chemical is called acetylcholine.

12:28.860 --> 12:31.080
 Some of you may have heard about acetylcholine before.

12:31.080 --> 12:33.620
 Acetylcholine also exists in your brain

12:33.620 --> 12:35.120
 and does other things in your brain.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.160
 Mainly, it's involved in focus and attention,

12:38.160 --> 12:40.180
 but at the neuromuscular junction,

12:40.180 --> 12:43.140
 the release of acetylcholine from these nerve cells,

12:43.140 --> 12:44.980
 these neurons, onto the muscles

12:44.980 --> 12:46.800
 causes the muscles to contract.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.380
 And when muscles contract,

12:48.380 --> 12:53.380
 they are able to move limbs by way of changing the length

12:54.860 --> 12:59.040
 of the muscle, adjusting the function of connective tissue,

12:59.040 --> 13:00.600
 like tendons and ligaments.

13:00.600 --> 13:01.640
 And for instance,

13:01.640 --> 13:04.040
 if you're bringing your wrist closer to your shoulder,

13:04.040 --> 13:08.160
 that biceps muscle is contracting, it's getting shorter.

13:08.160 --> 13:10.680
 I mean, in reality, it hasn't gotten shorter overall.

13:10.680 --> 13:13.120
 It's just temporarily shorter, of course.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.920
 All of that is controlled by neurons,

13:15.920 --> 13:18.720
 and it's those motor neurons from the spinal cord

13:18.720 --> 13:21.720
 that are really responsible for the major movement

13:21.720 --> 13:25.460
 of your limbs by way of causing contraction

13:25.460 --> 13:27.640
 of specific muscles at specific times.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.960
 So the key thing to take away is that nerve controls

13:30.960 --> 13:33.360
 the contraction of muscles.

13:33.360 --> 13:36.420
 Now, within the muscles themselves,

13:36.420 --> 13:39.280
 there are nerve connections,

13:39.280 --> 13:41.400
 and these are nerve connections that arise

13:41.400 --> 13:43.500
 from a different set of neurons in the spinal cord

13:43.500 --> 13:45.740
 that we call sensory neurons.

13:45.740 --> 13:48.340
 The sensory neurons exist in a different part

13:48.340 --> 13:50.960
 of the spinal cord, and they send a little wire

13:50.960 --> 13:53.060
 or set of wires into the muscles.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.840
 And there's a particular kind of sensory neuron

13:55.840 --> 13:58.420
 that comes out of your spinal cord and into your muscles,

13:58.420 --> 14:01.840
 which are called spindle neurons.

14:01.840 --> 14:06.400
 They create, or they actually wrap around muscle fibers,

14:06.400 --> 14:08.020
 kind of corkscrew around them.

14:08.020 --> 14:10.120
 They give kind of a spring-like appearance.

14:10.120 --> 14:12.140
 If for you aficionados out there,

14:12.140 --> 14:15.780
 these are intrafusal connections or neurons,

14:15.780 --> 14:18.040
 intrafusal means within the muscle,

14:18.040 --> 14:19.840
 but you really don't need to know that

14:19.840 --> 14:21.740
 unless you're really curious about it,

14:21.740 --> 14:23.080
 or you're going to become a neuroscientist

14:23.080 --> 14:25.320
 or you're in medical school or something.

14:25.320 --> 14:29.840
 These spindle connections within the muscle

14:29.840 --> 14:33.440
 that wrap around the muscle fibers sense the stretch

14:33.440 --> 14:35.800
 of those muscle fibers.

14:35.800 --> 14:39.260
 So now we have two parts to the system that I've described.

14:39.260 --> 14:42.080
 You've got motor neurons that can cause muscles to contract

14:42.080 --> 14:46.040
 and shorten, and we have these spindles

14:46.040 --> 14:48.200
 within the muscles themselves

14:48.200 --> 14:50.240
 that wrap around the muscle fibers,

14:50.240 --> 14:53.160
 and that information is sent from the muscle

14:53.160 --> 14:55.120
 back to the spinal cord.

14:55.120 --> 14:58.760
 It's a form of sensing what's going on in the muscle,

14:58.760 --> 15:01.080
 much in the same way that you have neurons in your eye

15:01.080 --> 15:03.960
 that sense light in your external environment.

15:03.960 --> 15:06.840
 You have neurons in your ear that sense sound waves

15:06.840 --> 15:08.320
 in your external environment.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.720
 You have neurons in your spinal cord

15:10.720 --> 15:12.800
 that are sensory neurons that are sensing

15:12.800 --> 15:16.540
 the amount of stretch in the muscles.

15:16.540 --> 15:21.080
 What happens is if a given muscle is stretching really far,

15:21.080 --> 15:24.860
 those sensory neurons, those spindles within the muscle

15:24.860 --> 15:28.840
 will activate and will send a electrical potential,

15:28.840 --> 15:31.800
 literally a bit of electricity along that wire's length

15:31.800 --> 15:35.160
 into the spinal cord, and then within the spinal cord,

15:35.160 --> 15:37.480
 that sensory neuron communicates

15:37.480 --> 15:39.120
 through a series of intermediate steps,

15:39.120 --> 15:42.160
 but to the motor neuron

15:42.160 --> 15:45.200
 and make sure that that motor neuron contracts.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.680
 Now, why would that be useful?

15:46.680 --> 15:49.240
 Well, what this does is it creates a situation

15:49.240 --> 15:52.600
 where if a muscle is stretching too much

15:52.600 --> 15:56.760
 because the range of motion of a limb is increased too much,

15:56.760 --> 15:58.440
 then the muscle will contract

15:58.440 --> 16:03.440
 to bring that limb range of motion into a safe range again.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.120
 Now, what determines whether or not a range of motion

16:06.120 --> 16:08.280
 is quote-unquote safe or not

16:08.280 --> 16:10.120
 is dictated by a number of things.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.720
 It's dictated by things that are happening

16:11.720 --> 16:13.720
 in this kind of loop of neural connections

16:13.720 --> 16:15.160
 in the spinal cord and muscle.

16:15.160 --> 16:18.400
 It's also determined by what's going on in your head,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.120
 literally in your mind, cognitively,

16:20.120 --> 16:22.640
 about whether or not the movement of that limb,

16:22.640 --> 16:25.420
 its increasing range of motion is good for you,

16:25.420 --> 16:27.120
 whether or not you're doing it deliberately,

16:27.120 --> 16:28.160
 whether or not it's bad for you,

16:28.160 --> 16:31.360
 and then there are also some basic safety mechanisms

16:31.360 --> 16:32.480
 that are put in there

16:32.480 --> 16:35.800
 that really try and restrict our limb range of motion.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.560
 Okay, so just to clarify,

16:37.560 --> 16:39.000
 this whole thing looks like a loop,

16:39.000 --> 16:41.280
 and the essential components of the loop are

16:41.280 --> 16:43.520
 motor neurons contract muscles,

16:44.760 --> 16:46.300
 sensory neurons,

16:46.300 --> 16:47.840
 of which there are a bunch of different varieties,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.560
 of in this case, what we're calling the spindles,

16:49.560 --> 16:51.560
 are sensing stretch within the muscles,

16:51.560 --> 16:55.080
 and if a given muscle is elongating

16:55.080 --> 16:58.760
 because of the increased range of motion of a limb,

16:58.760 --> 17:01.080
 those sensory neurons send an electrical signal

17:01.080 --> 17:02.400
 into the spinal cord

17:02.400 --> 17:05.540
 such that there is an activation of the motor neuron,

17:05.540 --> 17:07.680
 which by now should make perfect sense

17:07.680 --> 17:08.680
 as to why that's useful.

17:08.680 --> 17:10.680
 It then shortens up the muscle.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.960
 It actually doesn't really shorten the muscle,

17:11.960 --> 17:13.040
 but it contracts the muscle

17:13.040 --> 17:17.080
 that brings the limb back into a safe range of motion.

17:17.080 --> 17:21.440
 Okay, so this process is very fast.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.920
 It was designed to keep your body together and safe.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.960
 It's designed to make sure that you don't, you know,

17:27.960 --> 17:29.820
 take your arm and swing it behind your torso,

17:29.820 --> 17:31.840
 and it just goes all the way back to the middle of your back.

17:31.840 --> 17:33.100
 I mean, unless you're a contortionist,

17:33.100 --> 17:35.560
 or you've trained that kind of level of flexibility,

17:35.560 --> 17:36.400
 that would be terrible

17:36.400 --> 17:38.360
 because it could provide a lot of damage

17:38.360 --> 17:41.860
 to the muscles and to the connective tissue and so forth.

17:42.880 --> 17:46.400
 So that's one basic mechanism that we want to hold in mind,

17:46.400 --> 17:48.520
 this idea of a spindle that senses stretch

17:48.520 --> 17:50.480
 and can activate contraction of the muscles

17:50.480 --> 17:51.760
 and shorten the muscles.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.640
 The next mechanism I want to describe,

17:53.640 --> 17:55.360
 and once again, there are only two

17:55.360 --> 17:58.320
 that you need to hold in mind for this episode,

17:58.320 --> 18:01.000
 this other mechanism has a lot of the same features

18:01.000 --> 18:02.640
 as the one I just described,

18:02.640 --> 18:04.780
 but it has less to do with stretch.

18:04.780 --> 18:06.160
 In fact, it doesn't have to do with stretch

18:06.160 --> 18:09.720
 as much as it has to do with sensing loads.

18:09.720 --> 18:14.520
 So at the end of each muscles, you have tendons typically,

18:14.520 --> 18:19.520
 and there are neurons that are closely associated

18:19.600 --> 18:23.640
 with those tendons that are called Golgi tendon organs.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.400
 These are neurons that are sensory neurons

18:26.400 --> 18:29.480
 that sense how much load is on a given muscle.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.920
 So if you're lifting up something very, very heavy,

18:31.920 --> 18:33.700
 these neurons are going to fire,

18:33.700 --> 18:35.280
 meaning they're going to send electrical activity

18:35.280 --> 18:36.640
 into the spinal cord.

18:36.640 --> 18:41.120
 And then those neurons have the ability to shut down,

18:41.120 --> 18:44.280
 not activate, but shut down motor neurons

18:44.280 --> 18:47.800
 and to prevent the contraction of a given muscle.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.720
 So for instance, if you were to walk over

18:49.720 --> 18:53.880
 and try and pick up a weight that is much too heavy for you,

18:53.880 --> 18:56.440
 meaning you could not do it without injuring yourself

18:56.440 --> 19:00.440
 and you start to try and heave that weight off the ground,

19:00.440 --> 19:02.160
 there are a number of reasons why you might not be able

19:02.160 --> 19:03.720
 to lift it, but let's say you start to get it

19:03.720 --> 19:04.940
 a little bit off the ground,

19:04.940 --> 19:08.360
 or you start to get some force generated

19:08.360 --> 19:10.260
 that would allow it to move,

19:10.260 --> 19:13.480
 but the force that you're generating could potentially

19:13.480 --> 19:16.920
 rip your muscles or your tendons off of the bone, right?

19:16.920 --> 19:20.000
 That it could disrupt the joints and it could tear ligaments.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.720
 Well, you have a safety mechanism in place.

19:21.720 --> 19:25.240
 It's these Golgi tendon organs, these GTOs as they're called

19:25.240 --> 19:27.600
 that get activated and shut down the motor neurons

19:27.600 --> 19:30.920
 and make it impossible for those muscles to contract.

19:30.920 --> 19:31.880
 Okay, so on the one hand,

19:31.880 --> 19:33.760
 we have a mechanism that senses stretch

19:33.760 --> 19:36.840
 and can figure out when stretch is excessive

19:36.840 --> 19:40.460
 and when the system detects that stretch is excessive,

19:40.460 --> 19:43.360
 it activates the contraction of muscles.

19:44.360 --> 19:47.560
 And then we have a second mechanism that senses loads.

19:47.560 --> 19:51.180
 And when tension or loads is deemed excessive

19:51.180 --> 19:52.120
 by these circuits,

19:52.120 --> 19:53.480
 and remember these circuits don't have a mind.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.040
 They don't go, oh, this is excessive.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.240
 They just sense loads.

19:56.240 --> 19:58.620
 And when those loads exceed a certain threshold,

19:58.620 --> 20:01.960
 well then those GTOs, those Golgi tendon organs

20:01.960 --> 20:03.400
 send signals into the spinal cord

20:03.400 --> 20:06.320
 that shut down your motor neurons' ability

20:06.320 --> 20:08.040
 to contract muscles so that you no longer

20:08.040 --> 20:09.720
 can lift that heavy load.

20:09.720 --> 20:12.220
 So both of these are protective mechanisms,

20:12.220 --> 20:16.160
 but both of these can be leveraged in a very logical way

20:16.160 --> 20:17.440
 and in a very safe way

20:17.440 --> 20:20.200
 in order to increase your limb range of motion.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.000
 So there are a couple of things I want to point out

20:22.000 --> 20:24.040
 before going a little bit further

20:24.040 --> 20:26.520
 into how your nervous system controls

20:26.520 --> 20:28.240
 flexibility and stretching.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.960
 And those key points are the following.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.200
 There are now dozens, if not hundreds of studies

20:34.200 --> 20:38.840
 that show that a dedicated stretching practice

20:38.840 --> 20:41.200
 can improve limb range of motion.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.960
 Now, for many of you listening, you're probably saying duh,

20:43.960 --> 20:46.300
 but I think it's important to point that out,

20:46.300 --> 20:48.200
 that a dedicated stretching practice

20:48.200 --> 20:50.560
 can increase limb range of motion.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.980
 And as you'll soon learn,

20:51.980 --> 20:55.120
 there are specific mechanisms that can explain that effect.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.600
 The second point is one of longevity.

20:57.600 --> 20:58.960
 And when I say longevity,

20:58.960 --> 21:02.320
 I don't necessarily mean late-stage aging.

21:02.320 --> 21:06.240
 We all undergo a decrease in limb range of motion

21:06.240 --> 21:09.120
 unless we do something to offset that decrease.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.740
 And the current numbers vary from study to study,

21:11.740 --> 21:14.580
 but if you look en masse, you look at all of those studies,

21:14.580 --> 21:17.100
 and what you basically find is that

21:17.100 --> 21:19.680
 we start to experience a decrease in flexibility

21:19.680 --> 21:23.140
 from about age 20 until about age 49.

21:23.140 --> 21:24.520
 That's pretty dramatic.

21:24.520 --> 21:27.660
 And then of course it will continue after age 49,

21:27.660 --> 21:30.960
 but basically it's a 10% decrease every 10 years.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.720
 So we could say it's a 1% decrease per year,

21:33.720 --> 21:35.520
 although it's not necessarily linear.

21:35.520 --> 21:36.360
 What do I mean by that?

21:36.360 --> 21:39.620
 Well, it's not necessarily that on your 21st birthday,

21:39.620 --> 21:43.120
 you are 1% less flexible than you were on your 20th birthday

21:43.120 --> 21:45.240
 and it decreased by 1% per year.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.160
 Some of these changes can be non-linear.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.020
 So you can imagine the person who's doing just fine

21:49.020 --> 21:51.840
 in terms of flexibility between 20 and 30,

21:51.840 --> 21:53.920
 and then they get to 32

21:53.920 --> 21:56.220
 and suddenly they've lost 5% of their flexibility.

21:56.220 --> 21:58.760
 Now, of course, there will be a ton of lifestyle factors

21:58.760 --> 22:00.560
 if you're a regular practitioner of yoga,

22:00.560 --> 22:02.340
 if you have a dedicated stretching practice,

22:02.340 --> 22:03.380
 if you're doing other things

22:03.380 --> 22:06.120
 to improve your muscle contractibility,

22:06.120 --> 22:07.380
 so you're doing resistance training,

22:07.380 --> 22:11.720
 it turns out can actually indirectly improve flexibility.

22:11.720 --> 22:13.360
 There are a number of different factors,

22:13.360 --> 22:15.180
 but the key point is that

22:15.180 --> 22:17.420
 maintaining some degree of flexibility

22:17.420 --> 22:21.400
 and maybe even enhancing range of motion and flexibility

22:21.400 --> 22:23.920
 is of immense benefit for offsetting injury

22:23.920 --> 22:26.700
 provided it's not pushed too far.

22:26.700 --> 22:27.640
 There are a number of people

22:27.640 --> 22:31.320
 who have pushed their limb range of motion so far

22:31.320 --> 22:33.840
 that they experience all sorts of injuries,

22:33.840 --> 22:35.520
 both acute and chronic injuries.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.420
 Today, we'll also talk about how to avoid those scenarios.

22:38.420 --> 22:40.160
 Okay, so we've established that there are mechanisms

22:40.160 --> 22:43.360
 within the spinal cord, muscles, and connective tissue.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.100
 Remember, it's the motor neurons, the spindles, the GTOs,

22:47.100 --> 22:49.360
 and of course, the muscles themselves

22:49.360 --> 22:51.760
 and connective tissue, tendons,

22:51.760 --> 22:54.180
 but also other forms of connective tissue

22:54.180 --> 22:57.080
 that establish whether or not a limb

22:57.080 --> 22:59.900
 is going to stay within a particular range of motion or not,

22:59.900 --> 23:03.200
 and whether or not a limb is going to be allowed

23:03.200 --> 23:07.800
 by the nervous system to pursue or handle a given load,

23:07.800 --> 23:08.840
 a given tension.

23:09.800 --> 23:11.360
 There are also mechanisms

23:11.360 --> 23:14.720
 that arrive to the neuromuscular system

23:14.720 --> 23:18.120
 from higher up in the nervous system, from the brain.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.060
 And those mechanisms involve a couple of different facets

23:21.060 --> 23:23.120
 that are really interesting,

23:23.120 --> 23:24.960
 and I think that we should all know about.

23:24.960 --> 23:25.960
 In fact, today, I'm going to teach you

23:25.960 --> 23:29.960
 about a set of neurons that I'm guessing 99.9% of you

23:29.960 --> 23:30.800
 have never heard of,

23:30.800 --> 23:32.920
 including all you neuroscientists out there,

23:32.920 --> 23:36.420
 if you're out there, and I know you're out there,

23:36.420 --> 23:40.540
 that seem uniquely enriched in humans

23:40.540 --> 23:43.280
 and probably perform essential roles

23:43.280 --> 23:45.440
 in our ability to regulate our physiology

23:45.440 --> 23:47.040
 and our emotional state.

23:47.040 --> 23:48.120
 So within the brain,

23:48.120 --> 23:51.300
 we have the ability to sense things in the external world,

23:51.300 --> 23:53.320
 something we called exteroception,

23:53.320 --> 23:55.040
 and we have the ability to sense things

23:55.040 --> 23:57.120
 in our internal world, within our body,

23:57.120 --> 23:58.520
 called interoception.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.340
 Interoception can be the volume of food in your gut,

24:01.340 --> 24:03.400
 whether or not you're experiencing any organ pain

24:03.400 --> 24:05.760
 or discomfort, whether or not you feel good in your gut

24:05.760 --> 24:06.600
 and in your organs,

24:06.600 --> 24:07.920
 that's actually kind of feeling,

24:07.920 --> 24:10.920
 mm, I feel great, I feel sated, I feel relaxed,

24:10.920 --> 24:13.980
 those are all different forms of interoception.

24:13.980 --> 24:16.440
 The main brain area that's associated

24:16.440 --> 24:18.520
 with interpreting what's going on in our body

24:18.520 --> 24:21.220
 is called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.

24:21.220 --> 24:22.780
 It's a very interesting brain region.

24:22.780 --> 24:24.120
 It's got two major parts.

24:24.120 --> 24:29.120
 The front of it is mainly concerned with things like smell

24:29.780 --> 24:33.160
 and to some extent, vision, and to some extent,

24:33.160 --> 24:36.160
 other things that are arriving from the external world

24:36.160 --> 24:39.000
 and combining with what's going on internally

24:39.000 --> 24:41.120
 and making sense of all that,

24:41.120 --> 24:42.720
 or at least routing that information

24:42.720 --> 24:44.720
 elsewhere in your nervous system to make decision,

24:44.720 --> 24:46.460
 like if you smell something good to approach it,

24:46.460 --> 24:48.240
 or if you smell something bad to avoid it.

24:48.240 --> 24:50.240
 The front of the insula is really doing

24:50.240 --> 24:53.720
 all of that kind of stuff, along with other brain areas.

24:53.720 --> 24:57.840
 The posterior insula, the back of the insula, that is,

24:57.840 --> 25:01.760
 has a very interesting and distinct set of functions.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.400
 The posterior insula is mainly concerned

25:04.400 --> 25:07.960
 with what's going on with your somatic experience.

25:07.960 --> 25:12.560
 How do you feel internally and how is the movement

25:12.560 --> 25:13.960
 that you happen to be doing,

25:14.880 --> 25:19.120
 combining with your internal state to allow you to feel,

25:19.120 --> 25:22.080
 as I like to say, the nervous system mainly batches things

25:22.080 --> 25:25.520
 into yum, like, oh, this is really good for me, yuck,

25:25.520 --> 25:27.600
 this is really bad for me and I need to stop,

25:27.600 --> 25:29.860
 or meh, this is kind of neutral, okay?

25:29.860 --> 25:31.280
 So this isn't about food,

25:31.280 --> 25:34.600
 but we could say for most stimuli, most senses,

25:34.600 --> 25:36.300
 whether or not they're senses of things internally

25:36.300 --> 25:38.560
 or externally, our nervous system is trying

25:38.560 --> 25:40.800
 to make decisions about what to do with that information.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.360
 And so it mainly batches information into yum,

25:43.360 --> 25:46.040
 I want to keep doing this or approach this thing,

25:46.040 --> 25:50.480
 or continue down some path of movement or eating

25:50.480 --> 25:53.560
 or staying in a temperature environment, et cetera,

25:53.560 --> 25:55.240
 or yuck, I need to get out of here,

25:55.240 --> 25:56.360
 I don't want any more of this,

25:56.360 --> 25:57.400
 I don't want to keep doing this,

25:57.400 --> 26:01.160
 this is painful or aversive or stressful, and then meh.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.160
 So if it doesn't really matter,

26:02.160 --> 26:03.720
 I can just kind of stay right here or not.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.420
 Yum, yuck, and meh.

26:05.420 --> 26:09.880
 Well, in your posterior insula,

26:09.880 --> 26:11.960
 you have a very interesting population

26:11.960 --> 26:13.500
 of very large neurons,

26:13.500 --> 26:16.000
 these are exceptionally large neurons

26:16.000 --> 26:18.700
 called van economone neurons.

26:18.700 --> 26:21.120
 These are neurons that are, again,

26:21.120 --> 26:22.940
 unbeknownst to most neuroscientists,

26:22.940 --> 26:26.400
 and they seem uniquely enriched in humans.

26:26.400 --> 26:28.040
 Chimpanzees have them,

26:28.040 --> 26:30.240
 and some other large animals have them.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.480
 So they're found in whales, chimpanzees,

26:33.480 --> 26:35.580
 elephants, and in humans.

26:35.580 --> 26:38.680
 But even though we are much smaller than most whales,

26:38.680 --> 26:41.560
 and even though we are much smaller than most elephants,

26:41.560 --> 26:43.480
 I mean, remember there are baby elephants,

26:43.480 --> 26:45.480
 as far as I know, they haven't bred up

26:45.480 --> 26:47.040
 like mini elephants yet,

26:47.040 --> 26:49.100
 they seem to have a teacup version

26:49.100 --> 26:50.940
 of pretty much every dog breed.

26:52.020 --> 26:53.280
 You can look that up,

26:53.280 --> 26:55.800
 I certainly have mixed feelings about this notion

26:55.800 --> 26:57.960
 of trying to downsize everything to the point

26:57.960 --> 27:00.120
 where you could kind of like the pocket-sized bulldog,

27:00.120 --> 27:01.360
 I think, someday will arrive.

27:01.360 --> 27:03.360
 I'm not a fan of that kind of downsizing

27:03.360 --> 27:04.520
 of different breeds,

27:04.520 --> 27:06.420
 but because there aren't teacup elephants

27:06.420 --> 27:10.260
 and teacup gorillas and teacup chimpanzees and so forth,

27:10.260 --> 27:13.100
 most all of those other species are larger than us.

27:13.100 --> 27:15.900
 They have these van economone neurons,

27:15.900 --> 27:18.020
 and we have these van economone neurons,

27:18.020 --> 27:22.440
 but we have in upwards of 80,000 of these things

27:22.440 --> 27:24.000
 in our posterior insula.

27:24.000 --> 27:26.360
 These other species tend to have somewhere in the range

27:26.360 --> 27:29.200
 of 1,000 to maybe 10,000 or so.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.760
 Why is that interesting?

27:30.760 --> 27:35.580
 Well, these van economone neurons have the unique property

27:35.580 --> 27:40.580
 of integrating our knowledge about our body movements,

27:40.780 --> 27:43.240
 our sense of pain and discomfort,

27:43.240 --> 27:46.640
 and can drive motivational processes that allow us

27:46.640 --> 27:49.560
 to lean into discomfort and indeed to overcome

27:49.560 --> 27:51.880
 any discomfort if we decide that the discomfort

27:51.880 --> 27:54.000
 that we are experiencing is good for us

27:54.000 --> 27:57.020
 or directed toward a specific goal.

27:57.020 --> 27:58.760
 This knowledge turns out to be very important

27:58.760 --> 28:01.880
 to keep in mind because as we migrate this conversation

28:01.880 --> 28:04.600
 toward the things that we can do to enhance flexibility

28:04.600 --> 28:08.480
 and stretching, you'll soon learn that there are moments

28:08.480 --> 28:11.880
 within a stretching protocol where you have the opportunity

28:11.880 --> 28:14.520
 to either override pain and discomfort,

28:14.520 --> 28:18.100
 to kind of relax through it or push through it, right?

28:18.100 --> 28:21.200
 There's a decision fork in the road there,

28:21.200 --> 28:23.880
 and I'll tell you which fork in the road to take,

28:23.880 --> 28:26.720
 or to say, uh-uh, I'm not going to do that.

28:26.720 --> 28:29.320
 I'm going to allow these natural reflexes of the spindle

28:29.320 --> 28:32.480
 to kick in and just essentially stop me from stretching

28:32.480 --> 28:34.640
 if a given limb isn't designed

28:34.640 --> 28:37.360
 or shouldn't be stretched that far.

28:37.360 --> 28:41.180
 So I'd like you to keep these van economone neurons in mind.

28:42.660 --> 28:44.200
 I should mention they're named van economone

28:44.200 --> 28:46.360
 because the guy, Constantine van economone,

28:46.360 --> 28:51.160
 that discovered them at the end of the 1800s, early 1900s,

28:51.160 --> 28:54.080
 decided to name them after himself, as many scientists do,

28:54.080 --> 28:57.240
 or certainly the neurologists and physicians are famous

28:57.240 --> 28:58.860
 for naming things after themselves.

28:58.860 --> 29:01.760
 These van economone neurons turn out to be very important

29:01.760 --> 29:04.760
 to keep in mind as we embark on our exploration

29:04.760 --> 29:09.520
 of what sorts of stretching practices can be best applied

29:09.520 --> 29:13.080
 to increase flexibility, because whether or not

29:13.080 --> 29:16.300
 you undertake a mild, moderate,

29:16.300 --> 29:19.560
 or intense flexibility training,

29:19.560 --> 29:23.500
 you will no doubt encounter a scenario at some point

29:23.500 --> 29:26.100
 where you will have to ask yourself,

29:26.100 --> 29:29.340
 do I quote unquote relax into this stretch,

29:29.340 --> 29:31.900
 or do I try and push through just a little bit

29:31.900 --> 29:33.000
 of discomfort?

29:33.000 --> 29:35.400
 And I'll explain how to gauge that decision

29:35.400 --> 29:38.880
 in a very specific and ideally safe way.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.240
 And I'll give you some tools that will allow you

29:40.240 --> 29:42.920
 to make that decision in the way that best preserves

29:42.920 --> 29:44.860
 the integrity of those neural circuits

29:44.860 --> 29:47.560
 that I described earlier and can keep you safe.

29:47.560 --> 29:51.760
 These van economone neurons sit in the exact position

29:51.760 --> 29:54.180
 that one would want to be able to evaluate

29:54.180 --> 29:55.840
 what's going on in the body,

29:55.840 --> 29:58.360
 in particular what's going on in terms of limb movements,

29:58.360 --> 30:00.680
 how that relates to our feelings of discomfort.

30:00.680 --> 30:03.580
 And then there's the other aspect

30:03.580 --> 30:04.960
 of these van economone neurons,

30:04.960 --> 30:07.800
 which is that these van economone neurons

30:07.800 --> 30:10.800
 are connected to a number of different brain areas

30:10.800 --> 30:12.760
 that can shift our internal state

30:12.760 --> 30:15.160
 from one of so-called sympathetic activation.

30:15.160 --> 30:19.540
 So this is a pattern of alertness and even stress,

30:19.540 --> 30:23.040
 sometimes even panic, but typically alertness and stress

30:23.040 --> 30:26.680
 to one of so-called parasympathetic activation

30:26.680 --> 30:28.800
 to one of relaxation.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.740
 Oftentimes you'll hear that stretching should be done

30:32.740 --> 30:34.880
 by relaxing into the stretch.

30:34.880 --> 30:37.660
 Well, what does it actually mean to relax into the stretch?

30:37.660 --> 30:40.960
 Well, these van economone neurons sit at this junction

30:40.960 --> 30:43.080
 where they're able to evaluate what's going on

30:43.080 --> 30:47.000
 inside our body and allow us to access neural circuitries

30:47.000 --> 30:50.920
 by which we can shift our relative level of alertness

30:50.920 --> 30:55.240
 down a bit or our relative level of stress down a bit

30:55.240 --> 30:59.520
 and thereby to increase so-called parasympathetic activation

30:59.520 --> 31:04.380
 and to literally override some of those spindle mechanisms,

31:04.380 --> 31:05.860
 even the GTO mechanisms,

31:05.860 --> 31:08.320
 but especially the spindle mechanisms

31:08.320 --> 31:12.880
 at the neuromuscular and musculospinal junction.

31:12.880 --> 31:17.880
 And in that way, gently, subtly override the reflex

31:18.400 --> 31:20.960
 that would otherwise cause us to contract those muscles back.

31:20.960 --> 31:25.340
 The reason that's possible is because your brain

31:25.340 --> 31:27.000
 has those other kinds of motor neurons,

31:27.000 --> 31:30.720
 the upper motor neurons that can both direct,

31:30.720 --> 31:34.940
 meaning control, and can override lower motor neurons.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.320
 I'll give you a brief example of this

31:37.320 --> 31:39.000
 that you've already done in your life

31:39.000 --> 31:41.600
 and that we all have the capacity for.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.600
 What I'm referring to is the monosynaptic stretch reflex.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.200
 This is something that every first year

31:48.200 --> 31:50.000
 neuroscience graduate student learns,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.040
 which is that if you were to step on a sharp object

31:53.040 --> 31:56.740
 with a bare foot, you would not need to make the decision

31:56.740 --> 31:58.080
 to retract your foot.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.960
 You would automatically do that

31:59.960 --> 32:02.140
 provided you have a healthy nervous system.

32:02.140 --> 32:03.840
 There are mechanisms in place

32:03.840 --> 32:06.680
 that cause the retraction of that limb

32:06.680 --> 32:10.560
 by way of ensuring that the proper muscles contract

32:10.560 --> 32:13.040
 and other muscles do not contract.

32:13.040 --> 32:14.800
 In fact, that they fully relax, okay?

32:14.800 --> 32:17.360
 So in the case of stepping on a sharp object,

32:17.360 --> 32:19.800
 like a piece of glass or a nail or a tack,

32:19.800 --> 32:22.080
 you would essentially activate the hip flexor

32:22.080 --> 32:25.500
 to lift up your foot as quickly as possible.

32:25.500 --> 32:29.660
 In doing so, that same neural circuit

32:29.660 --> 32:32.220
 would activate a contralateral,

32:32.220 --> 32:34.960
 meaning opposite side of the body circuit

32:34.960 --> 32:37.120
 to ensure that the leg, the foot,

32:37.120 --> 32:39.160
 that's not stepping on the sharp object

32:39.160 --> 32:41.760
 would do exactly the opposite and would extend

32:42.600 --> 32:44.600
 to make sure that you don't fall over.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.520
 All of that happens reflexively.

32:46.520 --> 32:50.240
 It does not require any thought or decision-making.

32:50.240 --> 32:54.580
 In fact, humans without any neocortex,

32:54.580 --> 32:56.560
 literally who are discerebrate

32:57.760 --> 32:59.640
 or an animal that doesn't have,

32:59.640 --> 33:02.600
 and when I say discerebrate, I mean lack of cerebral cortex,

33:04.400 --> 33:05.400
 they can perform that

33:05.400 --> 33:07.120
 because it's all controlled by circuits

33:07.120 --> 33:11.280
 that are basically below the brain and in the spinal cord.

33:11.280 --> 33:12.780
 There's a little bit of activation of circuits

33:12.780 --> 33:14.440
 in the kind of deeper parts of the brain,

33:14.440 --> 33:16.880
 but basically you don't need to think or decide

33:16.880 --> 33:18.180
 in order to do that.

33:18.180 --> 33:21.460
 However, if your life depended

33:21.460 --> 33:24.160
 on walking across some sharp objects,

33:24.160 --> 33:26.360
 let's say, let's make it a little less dramatic

33:26.360 --> 33:28.200
 so it's not like the Die Hard movie or something

33:28.200 --> 33:30.840
 where he has to run barefoot across the glass,

33:30.840 --> 33:32.620
 although that's a pretty good example

33:32.620 --> 33:34.060
 of what I'm describing here,

33:34.060 --> 33:37.420
 but let's say you had to walk across some very hot stones

33:37.420 --> 33:40.880
 to get away from something that you wanted to avoid.

33:40.880 --> 33:43.880
 You could override that stretch reflex

33:43.880 --> 33:46.480
 by way of a decision made with your upper motor neurons,

33:46.480 --> 33:47.880
 your insula, and your cognition,

33:47.880 --> 33:50.080
 and almost certainly those van econimo neurons,

33:50.080 --> 33:51.020
 which would be screaming,

33:51.020 --> 33:52.440
 don't do this, don't do this, don't do this,

33:52.440 --> 33:54.920
 could shuttle that information to brain areas

33:54.920 --> 33:57.440
 that would allow you to override the reflex

33:57.440 --> 33:59.480
 and essentially push through the pain

33:59.480 --> 34:02.660
 and maybe even, in fact, even,

34:02.660 --> 34:06.440
 not experience the pain to the same degree or even at all.

34:06.440 --> 34:08.320
 So these van econimo neurons

34:08.320 --> 34:11.280
 sit at a very important junction within the brain.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.520
 They pay attention to what's going on in your body,

34:14.520 --> 34:17.580
 pain, pleasure, et cetera,

34:17.580 --> 34:19.480
 and that includes what's going on with your limbs

34:19.480 --> 34:21.200
 and your limb range of motion.

34:21.200 --> 34:23.560
 They also are paying attention

34:23.560 --> 34:27.120
 and can control the amount of activation,

34:27.120 --> 34:28.580
 kind of alertness or calmness

34:28.580 --> 34:32.440
 that you are able to create within your body

34:32.440 --> 34:35.520
 in response to a given sensory experience.

34:35.520 --> 34:37.320
 And as I mentioned before,

34:37.320 --> 34:39.480
 they seem to be uniquely enriched in humans.

34:39.480 --> 34:43.880
 They seem to be related to the aspects of our evolution

34:43.880 --> 34:46.140
 that allow us to make decisions

34:46.140 --> 34:47.800
 about what to do with our body

34:47.800 --> 34:50.560
 in ways that other animals just simply can't.

34:50.560 --> 34:51.520
 Before we go any further,

34:51.520 --> 34:53.420
 I want to give you a practical tool

34:53.420 --> 34:55.280
 that you can, of course, use,

34:55.280 --> 34:58.840
 but that will also give you insight and experience

34:58.840 --> 35:03.380
 into your muscle spindle spinal cord circuit mechanisms.

35:03.380 --> 35:05.520
 So what I'd like you to do

35:05.520 --> 35:07.860
 is if you're in a proper place to do this,

35:07.860 --> 35:10.260
 you're going to stand with legs straight,

35:10.260 --> 35:11.740
 meaning knees not bent,

35:11.740 --> 35:13.860
 and you're going to try and touch your toes,

35:13.860 --> 35:16.280
 or for some of you, that's going to be very easy,

35:16.280 --> 35:18.440
 and you might even be able to put your hands

35:18.440 --> 35:20.040
 flat on the floor.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.200
 I don't have that kind of flexibility.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.160
 It's pretty easy for me to touch my toes.

35:23.160 --> 35:24.900
 I don't care if you round your back or not,

35:24.900 --> 35:27.740
 although ideally I would say don't round your back,

35:27.740 --> 35:29.760
 not because it's bad to do so necessarily,

35:29.760 --> 35:32.720
 but just to try and keep this the same

35:32.720 --> 35:34.860
 from trial to trial, as it were.

35:34.860 --> 35:37.980
 So try and get a sense of what your range of motion is

35:37.980 --> 35:40.560
 in terms of bending over at the waist

35:40.560 --> 35:41.860
 while maintaining a flat back

35:41.860 --> 35:43.960
 and trying to touch your toes or even touch the floor.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.720
 Maybe again, you can even go hands flat to the floor,

35:46.720 --> 35:48.760
 maybe even far out in front of you.

35:48.760 --> 35:52.240
 Okay, now what I'd like you to do is stand back up,

35:52.240 --> 35:56.760
 and I'd like you to contract your quadriceps

35:56.760 --> 36:01.240
 as hard as you possibly can for about five to 15 seconds,

36:01.240 --> 36:02.300
 let's say 10 seconds,

36:02.300 --> 36:04.880
 just to keep things more or less normalized.

36:04.880 --> 36:08.120
 This obviously is not a super controlled experiment.

36:08.120 --> 36:09.840
 So to contract your quadriceps, for those of you

36:09.840 --> 36:13.320
 that don't know, you're going to extend your lower limb out.

36:13.320 --> 36:14.620
 So this would be like kicking,

36:14.620 --> 36:15.740
 although don't do it too quickly.

36:15.740 --> 36:18.920
 You're going to kick out your foot.

36:18.920 --> 36:20.760
 You should feel your quadriceps contract

36:20.760 --> 36:22.040
 on the top of your thighs,

36:22.040 --> 36:24.740
 and you're going to try and consciously contract them

36:24.740 --> 36:26.280
 as hard as you can.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.960
 Okay, typically if you want to point your toe

36:28.960 --> 36:30.400
 back towards your knee or shin,

36:30.400 --> 36:32.160
 that's also going to help somewhat

36:32.160 --> 36:34.520
 to contract even harder and harder.

36:34.520 --> 36:36.880
 Okay, so do that for about 10 seconds.

36:37.860 --> 36:40.040
 A lot of you will do this just while standing,

36:40.040 --> 36:41.080
 contract, contract, contract.

36:41.080 --> 36:42.640
 Okay, then release it.

36:42.640 --> 36:47.160
 And then now go ahead and repeat that stretch

36:47.160 --> 36:49.460
 where you're trying to touch your toes or touch the floor.

36:49.460 --> 36:51.480
 So this is again relying more or less

36:51.480 --> 36:54.640
 on hamstring flexibility among other things.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.800
 Okay, what most of you will find

36:56.800 --> 36:59.560
 is that you have an immediate increase

36:59.560 --> 37:01.060
 in hamstring flexibility,

37:01.060 --> 37:04.280
 or your range of motion has increased.

37:04.280 --> 37:05.560
 If you didn't experience that,

37:05.560 --> 37:06.800
 then I would encourage you to try

37:06.800 --> 37:09.360
 and contract your quadriceps harder and longer,

37:09.360 --> 37:11.040
 so maybe 20 or 30 seconds,

37:11.040 --> 37:13.760
 and then try this so-called experiment again.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.280
 Why would contracting your quadriceps

37:17.280 --> 37:21.840
 allow your hamstring flexibility to suddenly increase?

37:21.840 --> 37:25.120
 Well, the way that our muscles are organized

37:25.120 --> 37:27.560
 is such that we have muscles

37:27.560 --> 37:30.000
 that are antagonistic to one another.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.040
 So our quadriceps and our hamstrings

37:33.040 --> 37:36.680
 work in sort of a push-pull fashion, if you will.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.500
 They can antagonize one another.

37:38.500 --> 37:42.160
 So when you move your heel towards your glutes,

37:42.160 --> 37:43.720
 you are using your hamstring.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.540
 The hamstring obviously also does other things

37:45.540 --> 37:46.860
 related to hip movement.

37:46.860 --> 37:49.840
 And when you lift your knee,

37:49.840 --> 37:54.840
 or when you extend your foot and contract your quadriceps,

37:54.960 --> 37:58.300
 you are essentially relaxing the hamstrings.

37:58.300 --> 37:59.860
 Now, of course, most movements involve

37:59.860 --> 38:02.740
 both quadricep and hamstring in synchrony,

38:02.740 --> 38:04.920
 and that synchrony is really an elegant one,

38:04.920 --> 38:07.060
 but here we're more or less isolating the quadriceps

38:07.060 --> 38:08.880
 from the hamstrings, at least to the extent

38:08.880 --> 38:12.120
 that it can leverage these spindle stretch mechanisms.

38:12.120 --> 38:15.480
 So what happens is when you contract your quadriceps hard,

38:15.480 --> 38:20.480
 you are relaxing or releasing some of the stretch

38:20.840 --> 38:24.440
 that's occurring in those intrafusal spindle sensory fibers

38:24.440 --> 38:25.800
 going into your spinal cord.

38:25.800 --> 38:29.680
 And as a consequence, you're able then

38:29.680 --> 38:33.420
 to stretch your hamstrings further,

38:33.420 --> 38:37.320
 or we can be more accurate and say that your range of motion

38:37.320 --> 38:40.980
 about the hamstring and its related joints is greater

38:40.980 --> 38:43.980
 when you aren't engaging that spindle reflex,

38:43.980 --> 38:46.560
 which would cause the hamstrings to contract, okay?

38:46.560 --> 38:48.760
 So if you are somebody who has tight hamstrings,

38:48.760 --> 38:50.980
 there could be a variety of reasons for that,

38:50.980 --> 38:54.560
 but part of the reason is likely to be neural,

38:54.560 --> 38:57.600
 and you can release that neural spindle reflex

38:57.600 --> 39:01.480
 by contracting the opposite antagonistic muscle,

39:01.480 --> 39:03.280
 which in this case is the quadriceps.

39:03.280 --> 39:05.640
 The same thing is true and can be leveraged

39:05.640 --> 39:07.040
 for stretching other muscles.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.800
 So for instance, if you're going to do a tricep stretch,

39:08.800 --> 39:11.000
 the typical kind of overhead where you grab your elbow

39:11.000 --> 39:13.640
 and move it toward the midline of your body

39:13.640 --> 39:16.360
 with the other, using your opposite hand,

39:16.360 --> 39:17.680
 well, you can do that,

39:17.680 --> 39:21.080
 and then I would suggest trying to flex your bicep,

39:21.080 --> 39:23.680
 contract your bicep, that is, while doing that.

39:23.680 --> 39:26.560
 And for most people, you'll notice a increase

39:26.560 --> 39:29.120
 in the tricep range of motion or ability

39:29.120 --> 39:32.800
 to kind of lean into or to relax into

39:32.800 --> 39:36.780
 or to push that stretch a little bit further.

39:36.780 --> 39:38.900
 Now, for you physios out there,

39:38.900 --> 39:42.000
 and for those of you that have backgrounds in kinesiology,

39:42.000 --> 39:43.160
 I want to acknowledge, of course,

39:43.160 --> 39:45.720
 there are other mechanisms that are coming into play.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.840
 There are actually neural connections

39:47.840 --> 39:49.280
 within the joints themselves

39:49.280 --> 39:51.120
 that are providing proprioceptive feedback,

39:51.120 --> 39:52.120
 et cetera, et cetera.

39:52.120 --> 39:54.320
 But this is simply to illustrate

39:54.320 --> 39:58.280
 that part of our range of motion is determined

39:58.280 --> 39:59.900
 by these spindle mechanisms

39:59.900 --> 40:03.040
 that I spent some time focusing on earlier.

40:03.040 --> 40:05.800
 And indeed, this approach can be leveraged

40:05.800 --> 40:09.340
 toward creating increased limb range of motion,

40:09.340 --> 40:11.960
 not just for the hamstrings, but for your quadriceps.

40:11.960 --> 40:14.620
 So for instance, if you have tight quadriceps,

40:14.620 --> 40:15.680
 you can do the opposite.

40:15.680 --> 40:19.600
 You can contract your hamstring very intensely

40:19.600 --> 40:23.040
 for let's say 10 seconds or 20 seconds or 30 seconds.

40:23.040 --> 40:24.560
 So that would take some conscious effort

40:24.560 --> 40:28.540
 of bringing your heel up towards your glutes.

40:28.540 --> 40:29.540
 You could do that in a way

40:29.540 --> 40:31.600
 that you're really trying to contract those muscles hard.

40:31.600 --> 40:33.900
 You'd have to use some deliberate hamstring activation

40:33.900 --> 40:36.280
 there, meaning you have to use those upper motor neurons

40:36.280 --> 40:39.960
 and the other aspects of your upper brain power, as it were,

40:39.960 --> 40:42.800
 to try and really contract your hamstrings

40:42.800 --> 40:44.720
 as intensely as possible.

40:44.720 --> 40:46.640
 Then you would relax that,

40:46.640 --> 40:49.000
 and then you would do your quadricep stretch again.

40:49.000 --> 40:52.140
 And if you did a pre-hamstring contraction measurement

40:52.140 --> 40:54.640
 of your quadricep flexibility,

40:54.640 --> 40:58.400
 and then you did a post-hamstring contraction measure

40:58.400 --> 41:00.880
 of your quadricep flexibility,

41:00.880 --> 41:01.880
 almost certainly you would find

41:01.880 --> 41:03.880
 that that flexibility had increased.

41:03.880 --> 41:06.880
 Now, of course, the muscle really didn't change much.

41:06.880 --> 41:08.560
 The tendons didn't change much.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.900
 What changed was the patterns of neural activation

41:10.900 --> 41:13.880
 that were restricting you from, in the first case,

41:13.880 --> 41:16.760
 stretching your hamstring or having a,

41:16.760 --> 41:18.120
 to be more accurate, we should say,

41:18.120 --> 41:22.120
 to having a certain range of motion about the hamstring

41:22.120 --> 41:23.340
 and its related joints.

41:24.580 --> 41:26.780
 And those break mechanisms were removed.

41:26.780 --> 41:28.520
 And of course, then when you contract your hamstring,

41:28.520 --> 41:30.400
 you're removing some of the neural breaks,

41:30.400 --> 41:33.400
 the spindle acting as a break

41:33.400 --> 41:37.200
 and inhibiting that quadricep range of motion.

41:37.200 --> 41:39.000
 Okay, so you can imagine this,

41:39.000 --> 41:40.040
 and in fact, you can apply this

41:40.040 --> 41:41.760
 for any number of different muscles.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.600
 The larger muscles and the sort of biceps, triceps,

41:44.600 --> 41:48.600
 and hamstrings, quadriceps are sort of the simplest place

41:48.600 --> 41:50.340
 to think about this and to apply it.

41:50.340 --> 41:52.980
 But in theory, and indeed in practice,

41:52.980 --> 41:55.740
 it really works for all the various muscle groups.

41:55.740 --> 41:57.320
 It's just sometimes harder to access

41:57.320 --> 42:00.160
 these so-called antagonistic muscle groups.

42:00.160 --> 42:04.080
 Now, we should take a moment and just discuss

42:04.080 --> 42:06.440
 what actually happens as we get more flexible

42:06.440 --> 42:07.520
 in the short term and long term.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.620
 I just mentioned what happens in the short term.

42:09.620 --> 42:13.920
 Clearly, those don't involve lengthening of the muscles.

42:13.920 --> 42:16.020
 It's not like the muscles slide along the bones

42:16.020 --> 42:19.160
 or that the tendons really stretch out that much more

42:19.160 --> 42:22.880
 than they had prior to that kind of exercise.

42:22.880 --> 42:27.880
 But it is the case that if people stretch consistently

42:27.880 --> 42:30.740
 over a given period of several weeks or more,

42:30.740 --> 42:33.320
 that there are changes in the muscles.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.600
 This gets a little bit tricky in terms of nomenclature,

42:35.600 --> 42:36.960
 and I just want to highlight that

42:36.960 --> 42:41.320
 because I think that a number of people get frustrated

42:41.320 --> 42:43.160
 and confused, in fact,

42:43.160 --> 42:46.720
 when we talk about muscles getting longer.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.820
 The whole concept of a muscle getting longer

42:48.820 --> 42:50.760
 isn't really in keeping with reality,

42:50.760 --> 42:53.220
 but there are elements within the muscles

42:53.220 --> 42:55.480
 that can change their conformation.

42:55.480 --> 42:57.300
 So to get a little bit detailed here,

42:57.300 --> 42:58.600
 and we won't spend too much time on this,

42:58.600 --> 42:59.760
 but I just want to acknowledge this

42:59.760 --> 43:00.720
 for those of you that are interested

43:00.720 --> 43:02.040
 in neuromuscular physiology

43:02.040 --> 43:04.480
 and how it relates to flexibility.

43:04.480 --> 43:05.840
 You have your muscle fibers

43:05.840 --> 43:08.600
 and then you have your so-called myofibrils.

43:08.600 --> 43:12.060
 So you can imagine kind of a single fiber.

43:12.060 --> 43:12.900
 That fiber, of course,

43:12.900 --> 43:14.920
 will get input from those motor neurons.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.360
 And then within those fibers,

43:17.360 --> 43:18.840
 you have what are called sarcomeres.

43:18.840 --> 43:20.320
 And you can kind of think about sarcomeres

43:20.320 --> 43:22.560
 as little segments, kind of like the segments of bamboo.

43:22.560 --> 43:25.340
 If you ever look at bamboo, it's not just one big stalk.

43:25.340 --> 43:28.520
 It's got those little out pouchings along the way

43:28.520 --> 43:32.860
 that kind of break up what would be

43:32.860 --> 43:35.500
 just one big stalk of bamboo into different segments,

43:35.500 --> 43:37.080
 but they're all connected.

43:37.080 --> 43:40.520
 The sarcomeres are somewhat like that.

43:40.520 --> 43:41.960
 And within the sarcomeres,

43:41.960 --> 43:43.440
 you have a couple of different components.

43:43.440 --> 43:46.800
 One thing is called myosin, which is like a thick layer,

43:46.800 --> 43:48.160
 and then the other is actin.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.920
 And those are interdigitated, as we say.

43:50.920 --> 43:52.380
 They're kind of connected to one another,

43:52.380 --> 43:54.160
 kind of like if you put your fingers together

43:54.160 --> 43:55.740
 from your two hands,

43:55.740 --> 43:58.160
 if you put your fingers in between one another,

43:58.160 --> 44:01.040
 that's interdigitate, literally interdigitate in this case.

44:01.040 --> 44:02.980
 So pun intended.

44:02.980 --> 44:07.940
 And the myosin and actin kind of move relative

44:07.940 --> 44:09.500
 to one another, and they have a lot to do

44:09.500 --> 44:11.600
 with your ability to contract muscles.

44:11.600 --> 44:14.540
 When we stretch muscles,

44:14.540 --> 44:16.420
 when we go through a stretching practice,

44:16.420 --> 44:19.160
 there are a number of things that change, some neural,

44:19.160 --> 44:21.540
 some related directly to connective tissue,

44:21.540 --> 44:23.680
 but also it appears from really nice work,

44:23.680 --> 44:26.080
 mainly done from McGill University.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.540
 I'll provide a link to a couple of these studies

44:27.540 --> 44:30.140
 if you want to dig in there more deeply,

44:30.140 --> 44:32.700
 that change the conformation,

44:32.700 --> 44:35.720
 the relative size and spacing of some of these things

44:35.720 --> 44:38.680
 like sarcomeres and the way that myosin and actin

44:38.680 --> 44:40.380
 kind of work together.

44:40.380 --> 44:44.360
 But we don't want to think of muscles as lengthening.

44:44.360 --> 44:48.460
 We can, however, think about the resting state of a muscle

44:48.460 --> 44:51.540
 being slightly different or indeed very different

44:51.540 --> 44:54.800
 than the resting state of a muscle of somebody

44:54.800 --> 44:57.020
 or of a limb that has not undergone

44:57.020 --> 44:58.620
 regular flexibility training.

44:58.620 --> 45:00.480
 So that's as much time as I want to spend on that

45:00.480 --> 45:01.860
 because we could spend an entire hour

45:01.860 --> 45:03.820
 getting right down into the details.

45:03.820 --> 45:05.500
 But I do want to emphasize, however,

45:05.500 --> 45:07.040
 that muscles have different parts.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.560
 They have fibers, they have sarcomeres,

45:09.560 --> 45:11.520
 they have myosin, they have actin.

45:11.520 --> 45:13.860
 But the idea of making our muscles longer,

45:13.860 --> 45:16.380
 that reflects a number of processes that occur

45:16.380 --> 45:19.860
 basically within an existing muscle length.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.720
 The length of our muscle bellies

45:21.720 --> 45:24.900
 and where our insertions are relative

45:24.900 --> 45:26.620
 to our connective tissue in our limbs

45:26.620 --> 45:29.500
 is genetically determined, right?

45:29.500 --> 45:30.820
 Some people have, for instance,

45:30.820 --> 45:34.020
 a bicep that goes all the way from the crook of their elbow

45:34.020 --> 45:36.340
 up to their shoulder, right?

45:36.340 --> 45:38.180
 And some people can, you know,

45:38.180 --> 45:40.500
 if they were to put their arm at a 90 degree angle,

45:40.500 --> 45:41.880
 could put two or three fingers

45:41.880 --> 45:44.300
 between their bicep and their elbow.

45:44.300 --> 45:48.340
 They have a, we can say, a shorter bicep, relatively shorter.

45:48.340 --> 45:49.540
 Now, the reason I mention

45:49.540 --> 45:52.080
 these highly detailed cellular mechanisms

45:52.080 --> 45:56.300
 is because as we start to embark on different protocols

45:56.300 --> 45:59.460
 for using stretching to increase flexibility

45:59.460 --> 46:00.940
 and range of motion,

46:00.940 --> 46:02.580
 we need to ask ourselves,

46:02.580 --> 46:06.660
 what is preventing our ability to extend range of motion?

46:06.660 --> 46:08.060
 Is it the spindle, right?

46:08.060 --> 46:10.880
 Is it because the muscle is stretching too much?

46:10.880 --> 46:12.460
 Oftentimes it can be because of that

46:12.460 --> 46:14.540
 and or because of a sense of pain

46:14.540 --> 46:18.820
 or simply a sense that the muscle is not in a position

46:18.820 --> 46:20.220
 that it's been in before

46:20.220 --> 46:23.340
 that's unrelated to pain or to spindle activation.

46:23.340 --> 46:27.260
 And oftentimes it can be related directly

46:27.260 --> 46:31.300
 to these changes in the confirmation of myosin and actin

46:31.300 --> 46:34.080
 and within the context of the sarcomeres.

46:34.080 --> 46:35.820
 Now, of course you can't peer into

46:35.820 --> 46:37.960
 or sense your individual sarcomeres.

46:37.960 --> 46:41.660
 However, you do have neurons that innervate these areas

46:41.660 --> 46:43.400
 and that send that sensory information

46:43.400 --> 46:44.420
 back into the spinal cord

46:44.420 --> 46:45.980
 and up to your brain to interpret.

46:45.980 --> 46:48.220
 So you'll find that as we move along,

46:48.220 --> 46:50.900
 there are specific adjustments that you can make

46:50.900 --> 46:52.740
 at both the macro level,

46:52.740 --> 46:56.660
 meaning how much movement to insert into your stretching,

46:56.660 --> 46:58.300
 right, is it going to be a static or dynamic

46:58.300 --> 47:00.040
 or even a ballistic stretch?

47:00.040 --> 47:03.220
 Or for instance, at the micro level

47:03.220 --> 47:08.060
 that even just a slight sub millimeter or millimeter increase

47:08.060 --> 47:12.700
 in the stretching of a given muscle and related tissues

47:12.700 --> 47:16.140
 can translate into an increased range of motion performance.

47:16.140 --> 47:17.500
 As a quick but relevant aside,

47:17.500 --> 47:19.620
 I thought I'd share with you something useful

47:19.620 --> 47:22.020
 that's also grounded in this notion

47:22.020 --> 47:24.260
 of antagonistic muscles.

47:24.260 --> 47:26.900
 So for those of you that do resistance training,

47:26.900 --> 47:28.220
 whether or not it's with body weight

47:28.220 --> 47:31.660
 or with physical weights or machines, what have you,

47:31.660 --> 47:32.980
 you may have found that if you,

47:32.980 --> 47:35.780
 let's say were to do three sets of a pushing exercise,

47:35.780 --> 47:38.940
 so this could be pushups, this could be bench presses,

47:38.940 --> 47:41.800
 this could be shoulder presses, something of that sort.

47:41.800 --> 47:45.100
 And then later in the workout, you were to do,

47:45.100 --> 47:48.100
 let's say machine pull downs or pull ups

47:48.100 --> 47:51.220
 or chin ups of some sort, so a pulling exercise.

47:51.220 --> 47:53.300
 Typically what you would find is if you were to do

47:53.300 --> 47:55.420
 what's often called straight sets,

47:55.420 --> 47:57.500
 so you would do three sets of pushups,

47:57.500 --> 48:00.580
 let's say with two minutes of rest in between,

48:00.580 --> 48:02.220
 that you might be able to get a certain number

48:02.220 --> 48:04.320
 of repetitions on the first set.

48:04.320 --> 48:07.160
 Just for sake of example, let's say you can get

48:07.160 --> 48:09.100
 10 repetitions on the first set,

48:09.100 --> 48:12.700
 and then you get eight repetitions on the second set,

48:12.700 --> 48:14.660
 and then you get six repetitions on the third set

48:14.660 --> 48:16.460
 with two minutes in between.

48:16.460 --> 48:18.900
 And then you would move on at some point

48:18.900 --> 48:20.620
 to your pulling exercises.

48:20.620 --> 48:22.900
 And similarly, let's say you were doing chin ups

48:22.900 --> 48:25.220
 or pull downs, and you would get 10 repetitions,

48:25.220 --> 48:26.940
 rest two minutes, eight repetitions,

48:26.940 --> 48:28.780
 rest two minutes and six repetitions.

48:28.780 --> 48:30.060
 Okay, fine.

48:30.060 --> 48:33.180
 Well, typically what people discover

48:33.180 --> 48:35.460
 is that if they interleave their pushing

48:35.460 --> 48:38.260
 and pulling exercises, provided they do that

48:38.260 --> 48:40.860
 for muscles that are antagonistic to one another,

48:40.860 --> 48:43.860
 so in this case, pushing with the chest,

48:43.860 --> 48:46.300
 shoulders and triceps for the pushing exercises

48:46.300 --> 48:48.480
 and pulling with the back and biceps,

48:48.480 --> 48:50.600
 and of course there are other muscles involved as well,

48:50.600 --> 48:52.580
 but because those muscle groups are at least

48:52.580 --> 48:54.820
 in part antagonistic to one another,

48:54.820 --> 48:57.520
 what people often find is that if they were to say,

48:57.520 --> 49:00.720
 do their pushing set, get 10 repetitions,

49:00.720 --> 49:05.720
 then move to a pulling set after just say 60 seconds

49:07.100 --> 49:09.320
 and perform that pulling set,

49:09.320 --> 49:13.040
 then go back to the pushing set,

49:13.040 --> 49:16.180
 then go back to a pulling set, push, pull, push, pull,

49:16.180 --> 49:18.080
 in other words, interleaving their sets,

49:18.080 --> 49:21.540
 even if they were to maintain the same amount of rest

49:21.540 --> 49:24.420
 between sets of pushing and sets of pulling,

49:25.320 --> 49:28.780
 what they discover often is that the drop

49:28.780 --> 49:31.280
 in the number of repetitions that they get

49:31.280 --> 49:34.860
 is somewhat offset, so rather than get 10, eight, six,

49:34.860 --> 49:39.860
 as it were with the straight sets, it will be 10, nine, eight.

49:39.880 --> 49:43.780
 So what this means is not that you're increasing

49:43.780 --> 49:45.980
 the total rest time to four minutes between sets,

49:45.980 --> 49:48.840
 because then of course it wouldn't be equivalent,

49:48.840 --> 49:52.020
 but rather that while maintaining the same amount of rest

49:52.020 --> 49:55.480
 between sets for this same muscle group,

49:55.480 --> 49:58.160
 by going from push, pull, push, pull

49:58.160 --> 50:00.360
 of antagonistic muscles,

50:00.360 --> 50:03.940
 you're able to have improved performance.

50:03.940 --> 50:06.140
 And the reason for that has everything to do

50:06.140 --> 50:08.100
 with what we were describing before,

50:08.100 --> 50:12.020
 which is that typically if you were to do push set,

50:12.020 --> 50:14.980
 rest, push set, rest, push set, rest,

50:14.980 --> 50:17.420
 well, in between those sets,

50:17.420 --> 50:20.500
 and in fact, actually during those sets of pushing,

50:20.500 --> 50:23.180
 the pulling muscles that would be involved

50:23.180 --> 50:25.420
 in the chin ups or pull downs, et cetera,

50:25.420 --> 50:27.700
 are actually relaxing,

50:27.700 --> 50:29.940
 or at least are being released of some tension,

50:29.940 --> 50:32.780
 including the activation of the spindles,

50:32.780 --> 50:34.180
 among other things.

50:34.180 --> 50:36.220
 So that's a long-winded way of saying

50:36.220 --> 50:40.280
 that interleaving push and pull of antagonistic sets

50:40.280 --> 50:42.560
 can leverage some of the same neural circuits

50:42.560 --> 50:43.720
 that we're talking about leveraging

50:43.720 --> 50:45.620
 for sake of increasing flexibility.

50:45.620 --> 50:49.140
 Now, I offer this to you as a tool that you can try.

50:49.140 --> 50:51.420
 One of the challenges with using this tool, however,

50:51.420 --> 50:54.260
 is that you often have to occupy multiple sites

50:54.260 --> 50:56.140
 within the gym.

50:56.140 --> 50:57.980
 If you're doing this at home and you have your own gym,

50:57.980 --> 50:58.940
 that's one thing.

50:58.940 --> 50:59.820
 If you're doing this in a gym

50:59.820 --> 51:01.580
 where you have multiple pieces of equipment,

51:01.580 --> 51:02.900
 well, then you become that person

51:02.900 --> 51:05.340
 who has essentially taken over some small corner

51:05.340 --> 51:08.340
 or multiple corners or machines within the gym.

51:08.340 --> 51:10.080
 And oftentimes you'll find that you'll walk back

51:10.080 --> 51:11.460
 to a machine or you'll walk back

51:11.460 --> 51:14.660
 to a given resistance exercise and someone has now taken it

51:14.660 --> 51:16.180
 over and the whole thing could be thrown off.

51:16.180 --> 51:18.580
 So it takes a little bit of orchestrating

51:18.580 --> 51:20.240
 in order to do properly.

51:20.240 --> 51:23.380
 But in general, what people find is that this can allow you

51:23.380 --> 51:26.700
 to enhance performance overall of these individual movements

51:26.700 --> 51:30.900
 again, while maintaining the same amount of rest.

51:30.900 --> 51:32.940
 And even if you choose not to do this,

51:32.940 --> 51:36.900
 I encourage you to pay attention to this as a concept

51:36.900 --> 51:39.300
 because again, it's leveraging this idea

51:39.300 --> 51:42.340
 of antagonistic muscles, flexors and extensors,

51:42.340 --> 51:44.660
 antagonistic neural relationships

51:44.660 --> 51:46.680
 between the spinal cord mechanisms

51:46.680 --> 51:48.900
 that control one set of muscles

51:48.900 --> 51:50.180
 and activating those muscles,

51:50.180 --> 51:53.980
 allowing the opposite antagonistic muscle to relax

51:53.980 --> 51:57.620
 and therefore to perform better on its next set.

51:57.620 --> 51:59.160
 So now I'd like to shift to the question

51:59.160 --> 52:01.900
 of what types of stretching can and should we do

52:01.900 --> 52:04.380
 to increase limb range of motion?

52:04.380 --> 52:07.140
 If our goal is to do that in the most efficient way possible

52:07.140 --> 52:09.380
 because I realized that most people don't have

52:09.380 --> 52:12.340
 endless amounts of time to dedicate to a stretching practice

52:13.260 --> 52:14.900
 and even for those of us that do,

52:14.900 --> 52:18.020
 I'm sure that you want to get the most outcome

52:18.020 --> 52:19.700
 for a given effort.

52:19.700 --> 52:21.580
 And what are the modes of stretching

52:21.580 --> 52:24.300
 that are going to allow us to increase our flexibility

52:24.300 --> 52:27.100
 and limb range of motion most safely?

52:27.100 --> 52:29.060
 Now, there are a number of different types of stretching

52:29.060 --> 52:31.020
 or methods of stretching.

52:31.020 --> 52:35.940
 Broadly defined, we can describe these as dynamic,

52:35.940 --> 52:40.640
 ballistic, static, and what's called PNF stretching.

52:40.640 --> 52:45.100
 PNF stands for proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation,

52:45.100 --> 52:48.460
 and it involves and leverages many of the mechanisms

52:48.460 --> 52:50.080
 that I described to you earlier.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.100
 The first two that I mentioned,

52:51.100 --> 52:52.700
 dynamic and ballistic stretching,

52:52.700 --> 52:55.940
 both involve some degree of momentum

52:55.940 --> 52:59.700
 and can be distinguished from static and PNF type stretching.

52:59.700 --> 53:02.020
 Now, to distinguish dynamic stretching

53:02.020 --> 53:03.720
 from ballistic stretching,

53:03.720 --> 53:06.420
 like to focus on this element of momentum.

53:06.420 --> 53:11.340
 Both involve moving a limb through a given range of motion.

53:12.460 --> 53:14.700
 In dynamic stretching, however,

53:14.700 --> 53:17.420
 it tends to be more controlled, less use of momentum,

53:17.420 --> 53:19.960
 especially towards the end range of motion.

53:19.960 --> 53:22.100
 Whereas in ballistic stretching,

53:22.100 --> 53:25.540
 there tends to be a bit more swinging of the limb

53:25.540 --> 53:27.260
 or use of momentum.

53:27.260 --> 53:29.420
 So I invite you to visualize what dynamic

53:29.420 --> 53:31.560
 and ballistic stretching might look like in your mind.

53:31.560 --> 53:33.860
 You can even try it if it's safe for you to try it.

53:33.860 --> 53:36.780
 You could imagine swinging your arm up overhead

53:36.780 --> 53:38.300
 as much as possible and bringing it down.

53:38.300 --> 53:39.500
 I'm doing this because I'm seated

53:39.500 --> 53:41.440
 as kind of ridiculous movement to do while seated

53:41.440 --> 53:42.840
 or perhaps at all.

53:42.840 --> 53:45.200
 But for instance, you can see dynamic

53:45.200 --> 53:47.880
 and ballistic stretching anytime someone, for instance,

53:47.880 --> 53:49.820
 is holding onto something with one arm

53:49.820 --> 53:53.640
 or maybe not holding on and swinging out their foot.

53:53.640 --> 53:57.660
 So essentially getting movement about the hip joint.

53:57.660 --> 54:00.260
 And you'll notice that some people raise it up and pause it

54:00.260 --> 54:01.240
 and bring it down.

54:01.240 --> 54:03.820
 That's one form of dynamic stretching.

54:03.820 --> 54:07.180
 Whereas others will swing it up

54:07.180 --> 54:10.260
 and sort of let it carry itself a bit further

54:10.260 --> 54:11.980
 due to the momentum at the top of the movement

54:11.980 --> 54:13.380
 and then just let it drop back down

54:13.380 --> 54:14.940
 or maybe even control the descent.

54:14.940 --> 54:18.620
 There is an enormous range of parameter space here

54:18.620 --> 54:20.620
 or variables that one could imagine.

54:20.620 --> 54:22.100
 And there's just simply no way

54:22.100 --> 54:23.300
 that we could subdivide all those.

54:23.300 --> 54:25.460
 But again, dynamic and ballistic stretching

54:25.460 --> 54:27.640
 both involve movement.

54:27.640 --> 54:29.240
 So we have to generate some force

54:29.240 --> 54:31.460
 in order to create that movement.

54:31.460 --> 54:33.980
 Ballistic stretching involving a bit more momentum

54:33.980 --> 54:35.420
 or sometimes a lot more momentum

54:35.420 --> 54:38.060
 especially at the end range of motion.

54:38.060 --> 54:40.100
 Now, both of those are highly distinct

54:40.100 --> 54:41.380
 from static stretching

54:41.380 --> 54:44.220
 which involves holding the end range of motion.

54:44.220 --> 54:47.020
 So minimizing the amount of momentum that's used.

54:47.020 --> 54:48.820
 So to stay with a simple example

54:48.820 --> 54:50.860
 that we are all now familiar with

54:50.860 --> 54:52.360
 from our earlier discussion,

54:53.380 --> 54:55.420
 slowly bending over at the waist

54:55.420 --> 54:57.420
 and trying to touch your toes

54:57.420 --> 54:59.320
 or putting your hands to the floor

54:59.320 --> 55:01.800
 and then holding that end position

55:01.800 --> 55:05.260
 before coming up in a slow and controlled way

55:05.260 --> 55:09.380
 such that you reduce the amount of momentum to near zero

55:10.760 --> 55:13.240
 would be one example of static stretching.

55:13.240 --> 55:15.540
 Static stretching can be further subdivided

55:15.540 --> 55:17.900
 into active or passive, right?

55:17.900 --> 55:21.340
 There are different names for these kinds of approaches.

55:21.340 --> 55:23.000
 You can hear about the Anderson approach

55:23.000 --> 55:24.020
 or the Jonda approach.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.060
 You can look these sorts of things up online.

55:26.060 --> 55:28.100
 And again, people tend to name things after themselves.

55:28.100 --> 55:29.760
 So some of these are proprietary

55:29.760 --> 55:31.060
 related to specific programs.

55:31.060 --> 55:32.380
 I'm not focusing on those.

55:32.380 --> 55:34.620
 Others come to be named after the physiologists

55:34.620 --> 55:38.140
 or the practitioners that initially popularized them.

55:38.140 --> 55:39.520
 As is always the case,

55:39.520 --> 55:41.060
 there's always a naming and renaming

55:41.060 --> 55:43.520
 and claiming of territory with these things.

55:43.520 --> 55:44.360
 For the time being,

55:44.360 --> 55:46.780
 I'd like to just emphasize that static stretching

55:46.780 --> 55:48.440
 can be both active

55:48.440 --> 55:51.740
 where there's a dedicated effort

55:51.740 --> 55:54.820
 on the part of the stretcher, you,

55:54.820 --> 55:59.360
 to put force behind the hold to kind of extend

55:59.360 --> 56:02.020
 or literally to extend the range of motion.

56:02.020 --> 56:05.760
 And then there's also passive static stretching

56:05.760 --> 56:07.820
 in which it's more of a relaxation

56:07.820 --> 56:09.940
 into a further range of motion.

56:09.940 --> 56:11.380
 And that can be a subtle distinction.

56:11.380 --> 56:13.700
 And there are other ways in which we can further distinguish

56:13.700 --> 56:15.900
 active and passive static stretching.

56:15.900 --> 56:18.660
 But nonetheless, static stretching involves

56:18.660 --> 56:21.380
 both those types of elements, active and passive,

56:21.380 --> 56:24.260
 but is really about eliminating momentum.

56:24.260 --> 56:26.500
 And then there's the PNF,

56:26.500 --> 56:28.660
 the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation.

56:28.660 --> 56:31.760
 And proprioception has several different meanings

56:31.760 --> 56:34.400
 in the context of neuroscience and physiology

56:34.400 --> 56:36.800
 to just keep it really simple for today.

56:36.800 --> 56:40.120
 Proprioception involves both a knowledge and understanding

56:40.120 --> 56:44.460
 of where our limbs are in space and relative to our body,

56:44.460 --> 56:45.880
 typically relative to the midline.

56:45.880 --> 56:48.020
 So the brain is often trying to figure out

56:48.020 --> 56:50.700
 where are our limbs relative to our midline

56:50.700 --> 56:52.500
 down the center of our body.

56:52.500 --> 56:54.880
 And we know where our limbs are

56:54.880 --> 56:57.100
 based on so-called proprioceptive feedback.

56:57.100 --> 57:00.800
 So that's feedback that comes from sensory neurons, right?

57:00.800 --> 57:02.500
 Now you know what sensory neurons

57:02.500 --> 57:06.820
 that are essentially monitoring or responding to

57:06.820 --> 57:08.600
 events within the joints,

57:08.600 --> 57:11.260
 the connective tissue and the muscles,

57:11.260 --> 57:14.940
 and within the deep components of the muscles,

57:14.940 --> 57:16.100
 like the spindle reflex,

57:16.100 --> 57:18.460
 and within the tendons like the GTO,

57:18.460 --> 57:20.060
 the Golgi tendon organ.

57:20.060 --> 57:25.060
 So PNF type stretching leverages these sorts of mechanisms,

57:25.740 --> 57:29.940
 these neural circuits by way of, for instance,

57:29.940 --> 57:32.100
 you would lie on your back.

57:32.100 --> 57:35.300
 And if your goal is to increase your hamstring flexibility

57:35.300 --> 57:37.580
 and the flexibility and range of motion

57:37.580 --> 57:40.180
 of other related muscle systems,

57:40.180 --> 57:42.320
 you might put a strap around your ankle

57:42.320 --> 57:46.260
 and pull that muscle, or I should say, excuse me,

57:46.260 --> 57:47.460
 that limb towards you.

57:47.460 --> 57:48.300
 You're not going to pull the muscle towards you.

57:48.300 --> 57:50.380
 You're going to pull that limb, your ankle towards you

57:50.380 --> 57:52.620
 to try and get it sort of back over your head,

57:52.620 --> 57:55.500
 and then progressively relaxing into that,

57:55.500 --> 57:58.420
 or maybe even putting some additional force

57:58.420 --> 58:01.820
 to push the end range of motion and then relaxing it,

58:01.820 --> 58:04.740
 and then actually trying to stretch that same limb

58:04.740 --> 58:08.180
 or increase the limb range of motion without the strap,

58:08.180 --> 58:09.020
 right?

58:09.020 --> 58:11.500
 Sometimes these are assisted by other people.

58:11.500 --> 58:13.700
 So people will even use loads.

58:13.700 --> 58:15.780
 Sometimes they'll even use machines.

58:15.780 --> 58:17.660
 There are a number of different apparati

58:17.660 --> 58:18.900
 that have been designed for this.

58:18.900 --> 58:21.780
 Sometimes it'll involve a training partner.

58:21.780 --> 58:25.160
 There's a huge range of PNF protocols,

58:25.160 --> 58:28.900
 and those protocols can be done both by oneself

58:28.900 --> 58:32.680
 with or without straps, with machines, with actual weights,

58:32.680 --> 58:34.460
 or with training partners.

58:34.460 --> 58:36.900
 If you're interested in the variation of exercises

58:36.900 --> 58:39.940
 to say target your hamstrings versus your quadriceps

58:39.940 --> 58:42.620
 versus your shoulders versus your chest muscles, et cetera,

58:42.620 --> 58:44.660
 your neck muscles, and so on,

58:44.660 --> 58:48.500
 there is an enormous range of information on dynamic,

58:48.500 --> 58:50.580
 ballistic, static, and PNF stretches

58:50.580 --> 58:52.620
 for all the various muscle groups.

58:52.620 --> 58:55.300
 And I should say there are some excellent books

58:55.300 --> 58:56.180
 on those topics.

58:56.180 --> 58:58.780
 There are also some excellent videos on YouTube

58:58.780 --> 58:59.860
 and elsewhere.

58:59.860 --> 59:03.300
 Nowadays, it's pretty easy to find exercises

59:03.300 --> 59:06.820
 that allow you to target specific muscle groups.

59:06.820 --> 59:09.300
 Again, I encourage you to be safe in how you approach this,

59:09.300 --> 59:11.820
 and I would encourage you also to pay attention

59:11.820 --> 59:13.520
 to the information that soon follows

59:13.520 --> 59:15.940
 as to what sorts of protocols one would use

59:15.940 --> 59:17.780
 to apply those exercises.

59:17.780 --> 59:20.940
 But the number of exercises and the availability

59:20.940 --> 59:23.220
 of those exercises for targeting different muscle groups

59:23.220 --> 59:25.320
 with these four different kinds of stretching

59:25.320 --> 59:29.860
 is both immense and fortunately, thankfully,

59:29.860 --> 59:32.780
 immediately accessible to all of us, often at zero cost.

59:32.780 --> 59:36.080
 So specific exercises to target specific muscle groups

59:36.080 --> 59:38.660
 aside, we've now established that there are

59:38.660 --> 59:40.340
 four major categories of stretching,

59:40.340 --> 59:42.380
 or at least those are the four major categories

59:42.380 --> 59:46.900
 I'm defining today, and we can further divide

59:46.900 --> 59:49.500
 those categories into which are the ones

59:49.500 --> 59:51.020
 that are going to be most effective

59:51.020 --> 59:53.700
 for increasing range of motion in the long-term,

59:53.700 --> 59:56.300
 not just in one individual session.

59:56.300 --> 59:59.340
 And there've been a number of studies exploring this.

59:59.340 --> 1:00:01.980
 I can list out at least four, and we'll put those four

1:00:01.980 --> 1:00:04.260
 as a kind of a cluster under one heading

1:00:04.260 --> 1:00:07.300
 in the show note captions that arrive

1:00:07.300 --> 1:00:09.140
 at essentially the same answer,

1:00:09.140 --> 1:00:12.820
 which is that for increasing limb range of motion,

1:00:12.820 --> 1:00:17.600
 it does appear that static type, including PNF,

1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:21.980
 but static type stretching is going to be more effective

1:00:21.980 --> 1:00:24.880
 than dynamic and ballistic stretching.

1:00:25.740 --> 1:00:28.660
 So at least to my mind, this is good news.

1:00:28.660 --> 1:00:29.820
 Why is it good news to me?

1:00:29.820 --> 1:00:32.660
 Well, while dynamic and ballistic stretching

1:00:32.660 --> 1:00:36.400
 can be immensely useful for improving performance

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:39.180
 of specific movements, in particular,

1:00:39.180 --> 1:00:42.460
 in the context of particular sports like tennis

1:00:42.460 --> 1:00:45.520
 or in sprinting, or frankly, for any sport,

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:48.540
 they do carry with them a certain amount of risk

1:00:48.540 --> 1:00:50.480
 because of the use of momentum.

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.620
 So you don't need to be highly trained

1:00:52.620 --> 1:00:53.700
 in order to perform them.

1:00:53.700 --> 1:00:56.340
 In fact, there is a place, and we will describe

1:00:56.340 --> 1:00:58.220
 when one would want to apply dynamic

1:00:58.220 --> 1:00:59.940
 or ballistic stretching.

1:00:59.940 --> 1:01:01.820
 I'll just give away for now,

1:01:01.820 --> 1:01:03.660
 I think that most physios out there,

1:01:03.660 --> 1:01:07.060
 and certainly the ones that I spoke to Dr. Andy Galpin,

1:01:07.060 --> 1:01:11.420
 Dr. Kelly Starrett, and a few others point to the fact

1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:16.420
 that doing some safe dynamic and ballistic stretching

1:01:16.420 --> 1:01:19.920
 prior to say a resistance training session,

1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:23.340
 or maybe even prior to a cardiovascular training session

1:01:23.340 --> 1:01:27.540
 can be useful, both in terms of range of motion effects

1:01:27.540 --> 1:01:30.580
 and in terms of neural activation effects.

1:01:30.580 --> 1:01:31.920
 I don't want to use the words warm up

1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:33.820
 because warming up is typically associated

1:01:33.820 --> 1:01:37.020
 with increasing core body temperature, as it should be,

1:01:37.020 --> 1:01:40.500
 but for engaging the neural circuits

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:43.220
 and becoming familiarized with the neural circuits

1:01:43.220 --> 1:01:45.160
 that you're about to use in other movements,

1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:47.500
 while also increasing the range of motion

1:01:47.500 --> 1:01:48.880
 of the joints involved in those movements

1:01:48.880 --> 1:01:50.460
 so that you can perform them more safely

1:01:50.460 --> 1:01:51.800
 and more confidently.

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:54.580
 So I'm certainly not saying, I want to repeat,

1:01:54.580 --> 1:01:55.900
 I'm certainly not saying that dynamic

1:01:55.900 --> 1:01:57.500
 and ballistic stretching are not useful.

1:01:57.500 --> 1:01:59.100
 They absolutely are.

1:01:59.100 --> 1:02:01.580
 But in terms of increasing limb range of motion

1:02:01.580 --> 1:02:06.140
 in the longterm of truly becoming more flexible

1:02:06.140 --> 1:02:08.380
 as opposed to transiently more flexible,

1:02:09.980 --> 1:02:12.660
 static stretching, which includes PNF,

1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:15.780
 appears to be the best route to go.

1:02:15.780 --> 1:02:18.400
 So if your goal is to increase your limb range of motion

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:21.800
 for a given muscle group, or perhaps for all muscle groups,

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.600
 although you can imagine that'd be pretty tough.

1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:25.260
 I mean, you're not going to spend time,

1:02:25.260 --> 1:02:28.320
 I could imagine working on your tongue muscle control

1:02:28.320 --> 1:02:30.980
 or neck muscle control and every muscle control,

1:02:30.980 --> 1:02:34.100
 but most of us want to reduce so-called tightness,

1:02:34.100 --> 1:02:36.700
 in air quotes, and increase limb range of motion

1:02:36.700 --> 1:02:38.500
 for certain muscle groups.

1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:41.740
 And it appears that the best way to do that

1:02:41.740 --> 1:02:44.420
 is going to be static stretching of some kind,

1:02:44.420 --> 1:02:46.540
 which raises the question of how often

1:02:46.540 --> 1:02:47.760
 to do that static stretching

1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:51.040
 and how long to hold those static stretches.

1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:52.820
 And we can also ask the question,

1:02:52.820 --> 1:02:54.620
 we should ask the question,

1:02:54.620 --> 1:02:56.580
 where to hold those static stretches?

1:02:56.580 --> 1:02:59.720
 Is it always a good idea to hold those static stretches

1:02:59.720 --> 1:03:04.140
 at the end or the point of maximal range of motion?

1:03:04.140 --> 1:03:05.540
 We're going to address that now.

1:03:05.540 --> 1:03:07.660
 There's some terrific science around this.

1:03:07.660 --> 1:03:10.940
 A slightly older study, but nonetheless, a powerful one,

1:03:10.940 --> 1:03:12.760
 because it provided a foundation

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:14.060
 for a lot of subsequent work,

1:03:14.060 --> 1:03:15.960
 which basically served to just confirm

1:03:15.960 --> 1:03:17.340
 the answer they got here,

1:03:17.340 --> 1:03:21.540
 is a study from Bandy et al, and the title of this study

1:03:21.540 --> 1:03:24.460
 is The Effect of Time and Frequency of Static Stretching

1:03:24.460 --> 1:03:27.740
 on the Flexibility of the Hamstring Muscles.

1:03:27.740 --> 1:03:30.000
 It was a study involving 93 subjects,

1:03:30.000 --> 1:03:34.820
 so 61 men, 32 women, ranging in age from 21 to 39 years,

1:03:34.820 --> 1:03:37.220
 so a pretty broad demographic,

1:03:37.220 --> 1:03:39.640
 who had limited hamstring muscle flexibility,

1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:40.660
 here I'm paraphrasing,

1:03:40.660 --> 1:03:43.140
 and randomly assigned to one of five groups.

1:03:43.140 --> 1:03:47.520
 So the four stretching groups stretched five days per week

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:48.360
 for six weeks.

1:03:48.360 --> 1:03:51.500
 The fifth group, which served as a control, did not stretch.

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:54.460
 The results clearly show that, quote,

1:03:54.460 --> 1:03:56.740
 "'The change in flexibility' appeared to be dependent

1:03:56.740 --> 1:03:58.700
 on the duration and frequency of stretching."

1:03:58.700 --> 1:03:59.540
 This is great.

1:03:59.540 --> 1:04:02.620
 This tells us that stretching for a given amount of time

1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:05.700
 scales with the amount of limb range of motion improvement

1:04:05.700 --> 1:04:06.820
 that one will see.

1:04:06.820 --> 1:04:09.500
 There were many interesting findings within this study,

1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:13.060
 but the one that I'd like to highlight most is, quote,

1:04:13.060 --> 1:04:14.780
 "'The results of this study suggest

1:04:14.780 --> 1:04:18.720
 that a 30-second duration is an effective amount of time

1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:20.560
 to sustain a hamstring muscle stretch

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:23.320
 in order to increase range of motion.

1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:25.460
 No increase in flexibility occurred

1:04:25.460 --> 1:04:27.300
 when the duration of stretching was increased

1:04:27.300 --> 1:04:30.240
 from 30 seconds to 60 seconds,

1:04:30.240 --> 1:04:32.560
 or when the frequency of stretching was increased

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:35.060
 from one to three times per day."

1:04:35.060 --> 1:04:38.280
 Okay, so now we're starting to lay down some parameters.

1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:41.460
 What this study reveals and what subsequent studies tell us,

1:04:41.460 --> 1:04:44.100
 and we will get into those subsequent studies,

1:04:44.100 --> 1:04:48.340
 is that ideally one would do static stretches

1:04:48.340 --> 1:04:51.740
 that are held for 30 seconds,

1:04:51.740 --> 1:04:53.400
 perhaps more in certain instances,

1:04:53.400 --> 1:04:55.180
 and I'll explain when that can be useful,

1:04:55.180 --> 1:04:59.420
 but here, holding those stretches for more than 30 seconds

1:04:59.420 --> 1:05:02.580
 did not turn out to be additionally useful.

1:05:02.580 --> 1:05:04.860
 So if you're going to stretch your quadricep, for instance,

1:05:04.860 --> 1:05:07.540
 and you're going to hold that stretch in static fashion,

1:05:07.540 --> 1:05:09.860
 remember, not using momentum,

1:05:09.860 --> 1:05:12.580
 and you can use the mental tricks

1:05:12.580 --> 1:05:14.860
 of either trying to push through the pain,

1:05:14.860 --> 1:05:16.980
 which I don't recommend necessarily,

1:05:16.980 --> 1:05:19.540
 I think that makes us prone to injury,

1:05:19.540 --> 1:05:21.220
 or to relax into the stretch,

1:05:21.220 --> 1:05:23.480
 but nonetheless, providing some force,

1:05:23.480 --> 1:05:26.600
 typically with a hand in order to pull your ankle back,

1:05:26.600 --> 1:05:27.860
 if you're doing a quadricep stretch,

1:05:27.860 --> 1:05:29.740
 some people might do this on the edge of a sofa.

1:05:29.740 --> 1:05:31.600
 Remember, there are a lot of different exercises

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:34.260
 and ways to do this that you can explore elsewhere.

1:05:34.260 --> 1:05:37.700
 Well, holding that static stretch for 30 seconds

1:05:37.700 --> 1:05:41.780
 appears to be sufficient to stimulate an increase

1:05:41.780 --> 1:05:44.060
 in limb range of motion over time.

1:05:44.060 --> 1:05:44.940
 Again, these are protocols

1:05:44.940 --> 1:05:46.360
 that were used repeatedly over time,

1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:48.640
 and we'll talk about how often to repeat them

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:50.260
 in order to get maximum effect,

1:05:50.260 --> 1:05:52.920
 but 30-second holds for static stretches

1:05:52.920 --> 1:05:54.820
 is the number that I think we want to focus on

1:05:54.820 --> 1:05:56.940
 and that most of us are going to want to utilize.

1:05:56.940 --> 1:06:00.860
 So now let's explore how many sets of static stretching

1:06:00.860 --> 1:06:03.380
 one ought to do in order to get

1:06:03.380 --> 1:06:06.140
 a maximum range of motion improvement

1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:08.740
 while not placing us into a system

1:06:08.740 --> 1:06:10.260
 that's going to create injury,

1:06:10.260 --> 1:06:12.860
 nor a situation where we have to be

1:06:12.860 --> 1:06:14.700
 constantly stretching throughout the day,

1:06:14.700 --> 1:06:17.100
 because again, most of us don't have time to do that.

1:06:17.100 --> 1:06:19.500
 This issue of sets is an important one.

1:06:19.500 --> 1:06:21.500
 In the context of cardiovascular exercise,

1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:25.380
 we've talked about the data that support the fact that

1:06:25.380 --> 1:06:28.700
 doing at least 150 and ideally

1:06:28.700 --> 1:06:30.300
 as much as 200 minutes per week

1:06:30.300 --> 1:06:32.340
 of zone two cardiovascular exercise

1:06:32.340 --> 1:06:34.100
 is very useful for cardiovascular health

1:06:34.100 --> 1:06:35.860
 and for other aspects of health.

1:06:35.860 --> 1:06:36.960
 And of course, there are other aspects

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:38.180
 of cardiovascular exercise

1:06:38.180 --> 1:06:39.980
 that could be layered onto and into that

1:06:39.980 --> 1:06:43.340
 that can be useful like 90-second maximal sprints, et cetera.

1:06:43.340 --> 1:06:46.220
 Discuss this a lot in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin

1:06:46.220 --> 1:06:48.180
 and on our episode about endurance.

1:06:48.180 --> 1:06:50.100
 And we also talked about sets

1:06:50.100 --> 1:06:52.800
 in the context of strength and hypertrophy building,

1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:55.380
 building muscle size and or strength

1:06:55.380 --> 1:06:57.300
 in the episode about that

1:06:57.300 --> 1:07:00.140
 and in particular in the episode with Dr. Andy Galpin.

1:07:00.140 --> 1:07:03.000
 And there, we could also arrive at some specific parameters

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.720
 and it's going to vary, of course, between individuals,

1:07:05.720 --> 1:07:07.100
 depending on how hard you train,

1:07:07.100 --> 1:07:08.740
 whether or not you take sets to failure,

1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:10.580
 your repetition range, et cetera.

1:07:10.580 --> 1:07:12.980
 But in the context of strength and hypertrophy building,

1:07:12.980 --> 1:07:16.740
 we arrived at approximately six,

1:07:16.740 --> 1:07:19.860
 maybe as many as 10 sets per week per muscle group,

1:07:19.860 --> 1:07:21.620
 some of that work is done as direct work

1:07:21.620 --> 1:07:24.300
 to a given muscle group, some of that work is indirect.

1:07:24.300 --> 1:07:26.300
 So doing a certain pulling exercise, of course,

1:07:26.300 --> 1:07:30.960
 will target the latissimus dorsi muscles,

1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:31.980
 but also the biceps.

1:07:31.980 --> 1:07:34.940
 So that doesn't necessarily mean you have to do 10 sets

1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:36.460
 for the biceps and for the lats.

1:07:36.460 --> 1:07:38.340
 Sometimes you're getting some indirect work, et cetera.

1:07:38.340 --> 1:07:40.300
 All of that was delineated in the episode

1:07:40.300 --> 1:07:41.740
 with Dr. Andy Galpin.

1:07:41.740 --> 1:07:44.300
 And we arrived at those numbers of sets

1:07:44.300 --> 1:07:47.340
 according to the same criteria that we will apply here.

1:07:47.340 --> 1:07:52.120
 What is the minimum number of sets both to maintain

1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:56.620
 and to improve a given mode of performance?

1:07:56.620 --> 1:07:59.340
 Strength and hypertrophy or cardiovascular health.

1:07:59.340 --> 1:08:01.280
 Again, to either maintain or improve.

1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:04.340
 And we can do the same thing for improving

1:08:04.340 --> 1:08:06.200
 or maintaining range of motion.

1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:07.740
 Because as I mentioned earlier,

1:08:07.740 --> 1:08:10.300
 the data points to the fact that if we don't do

1:08:10.300 --> 1:08:13.740
 some dedicated work to improve range of motion over time,

1:08:13.740 --> 1:08:17.260
 we will lose our flexibility and limb range of motion

1:08:17.260 --> 1:08:19.640
 over time just by virtue of the fact

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:21.700
 that we're not doing anything to offset that.

1:08:21.700 --> 1:08:25.620
 So whether or not you want to maintain, reestablish,

1:08:25.620 --> 1:08:29.060
 or gain limb range of motion,

1:08:29.060 --> 1:08:33.940
 static stretching of holds of 30 seconds appear to be best.

1:08:33.940 --> 1:08:36.860
 Now the question is, how long should you do that?

1:08:36.860 --> 1:08:37.700
 And how many sets should you do that?

1:08:37.700 --> 1:08:40.180
 And how many times a week should you do that?

1:08:40.180 --> 1:08:42.300
 And to answer those questions,

1:08:42.300 --> 1:08:43.740
 I'm going to turn to what I think

1:08:43.740 --> 1:08:45.420
 is a really spectacular review.

1:08:45.420 --> 1:08:48.100
 This was a review that was published in the year 2018.

1:08:48.100 --> 1:08:49.300
 So it's fairly recent.

1:08:49.300 --> 1:08:52.880
 First author, Thomas, Edwin Thomas, last author, Palma.

1:08:52.880 --> 1:08:55.060
 We will put a link to this in the show note caption.

1:08:55.060 --> 1:08:56.920
 The title of the paper is the relation

1:08:56.920 --> 1:08:59.800
 between stretching typology and stretching duration,

1:08:59.800 --> 1:09:01.340
 the effects on range of motion.

1:09:01.340 --> 1:09:02.980
 It's a very straightforward title.

1:09:04.140 --> 1:09:07.340
 This is a review article that explored

1:09:07.340 --> 1:09:08.920
 a number of different studies,

1:09:10.340 --> 1:09:12.060
 had criteria for whether or not those studies

1:09:12.060 --> 1:09:15.480
 could be evaluated in the context of the questions here,

1:09:15.480 --> 1:09:17.620
 had some quality standards and some other standards

1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:18.460
 that they applied,

1:09:18.460 --> 1:09:22.420
 and basically winnowed down a large collection of studies

1:09:22.420 --> 1:09:24.860
 to a remaining 23 articles

1:09:24.860 --> 1:09:27.200
 that were able to be considered, quote,

1:09:27.200 --> 1:09:29.960
 eligible and included in the quantitative synthesis

1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:30.880
 done here.

1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:35.740
 So key points from that quantification and synthesis

1:09:35.740 --> 1:09:37.100
 done in this paper.

1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:38.560
 First of all, and I quote,

1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:42.180
 all stretching typologies showed range of motion improvements

1:09:42.180 --> 1:09:43.220
 over a long-term period.

1:09:43.220 --> 1:09:46.920
 However, the static protocols showed significant gains

1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:48.580
 with a P value less than 0.05,

1:09:48.580 --> 1:09:52.180
 which means a probability that cannot be explained

1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:55.060
 by chance alone when compared to ballistic

1:09:55.060 --> 1:09:56.500
 or PNF protocols.

1:09:56.500 --> 1:09:58.700
 So again, what we're hearing is that static stretching

1:09:58.700 --> 1:10:02.060
 is the preferred mode for increasing limb range of motion.

1:10:02.060 --> 1:10:04.620
 Although here they make the additional point

1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:07.700
 that static stretching might even be superior,

1:10:07.700 --> 1:10:09.800
 not just to ballistic stretching,

1:10:09.800 --> 1:10:12.900
 but also to PNF protocols.

1:10:12.900 --> 1:10:14.980
 Because before, as you may recall,

1:10:14.980 --> 1:10:19.940
 there was a distinction between ballistic and dynamic

1:10:19.940 --> 1:10:21.300
 and static and PNF.

1:10:21.300 --> 1:10:23.020
 And so here, it appears again,

1:10:23.020 --> 1:10:25.620
 that static stretching is sort of rising

1:10:25.620 --> 1:10:28.580
 to the top of the list as the optimal approach

1:10:28.580 --> 1:10:31.700
 relative to all other stretching approaches,

1:10:31.700 --> 1:10:34.880
 at least in the context of increasing limb range of motion.

1:10:34.880 --> 1:10:39.760
 The authors go on to say time spent stretching per week

1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:42.700
 seems fundamental to elicit range of movement improvements

1:10:42.700 --> 1:10:44.800
 when stretches are applied for at least

1:10:44.800 --> 1:10:47.680
 or more than five minutes per week.

1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:48.860
 Okay, this is critical.

1:10:48.860 --> 1:10:50.900
 This is not five minutes per stretch.

1:10:50.900 --> 1:10:53.080
 Remember, 30 seconds per static stretch,

1:10:53.080 --> 1:10:55.440
 but at least five minutes per week.

1:10:55.440 --> 1:10:58.660
 Whereas the time spent stretching within a single session

1:10:58.660 --> 1:11:00.440
 does not seem to have a significant effects

1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:01.600
 for range of motion gains.

1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:02.940
 If this is getting confusing,

1:11:02.940 --> 1:11:05.000
 I'll make sure that you soon understand

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.100
 exactly what we can export from these conclusions.

1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:11.680
 The data indicate that performing stretching

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:13.720
 at least five days a week.

1:11:14.600 --> 1:11:16.600
 Now, some of you may already be groaning

1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:18.740
 for at least five minutes per week.

1:11:18.740 --> 1:11:21.100
 Okay, so five days per week, that's a lot,

1:11:21.100 --> 1:11:23.160
 but at least five minutes per week,

1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:25.020
 five minutes per week is not that much.

1:11:25.020 --> 1:11:27.360
 Using static stretching may be beneficial

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:30.240
 to promote range of motion improvements.

1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:33.000
 Okay, I've read this study in detail now.

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.300
 They highlight, again, the reduction in flexibility

1:11:35.300 --> 1:11:38.800
 that occurs from 20 to 49 years of age and so on,

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:41.080
 how acute bouts of short-term stretching

1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:43.380
 up to three weeks can improve stretch tolerance.

1:11:43.380 --> 1:11:46.000
 I think that's a key point that in the short term,

1:11:46.000 --> 1:11:47.360
 the first three weeks of embarking

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:49.980
 on a stretching and flexibility program,

1:11:49.980 --> 1:11:51.440
 much of the improvements come

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:53.120
 from the short-term neural improvements

1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:54.080
 that we talked about before

1:11:54.080 --> 1:11:55.940
 of inhibiting the spindle reflex and so on,

1:11:55.940 --> 1:11:57.540
 and also a stretch tolerance,

1:11:57.540 --> 1:11:59.060
 a comfort with doing the movements

1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:00.660
 and maybe even a comfort in overriding

1:12:00.660 --> 1:12:01.740
 some of the pain mechanisms.

1:12:01.740 --> 1:12:04.120
 I'll talk a little bit more about that in just a bit

1:12:04.120 --> 1:12:07.680
 and the particular utility of yoga,

1:12:07.680 --> 1:12:09.820
 something that I don't often practice,

1:12:09.820 --> 1:12:11.340
 but that after reading this article

1:12:11.340 --> 1:12:12.720
 that I'll mention in a little bit,

1:12:12.720 --> 1:12:14.440
 I'm considering perhaps taking up

1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:17.260
 some form of yoga protocol.

1:12:17.260 --> 1:12:19.600
 Now, I've already highlighted some of the key takeaways

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:22.560
 from the study, namely that we need to get

1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:25.120
 at least five minutes per week

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:27.680
 of static stretching per muscle group.

1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:31.960
 And based on the previous paper that we talked about,

1:12:31.960 --> 1:12:33.520
 we need to divide that five minutes

1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:36.580
 into sets of 30 seconds each.

1:12:36.580 --> 1:12:38.680
 And as I mentioned earlier,

1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:40.080
 it doesn't seem to be the case

1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:44.080
 that you can do all of that in one day, unfortunately.

1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:46.320
 It does seem important that the frequency

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:48.060
 of stretching practice distributed

1:12:48.060 --> 1:12:50.080
 throughout the week is important.

1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:52.160
 So let's talk protocols.

1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:54.240
 We are now talking about doing static stretching,

1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:56.000
 so holding, so limiting momentum

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.460
 and holding a stretch for 30 seconds per set.

1:12:58.460 --> 1:13:02.800
 We're talking about trying to achieve five minutes per week

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:03.960
 of those static holds,

1:13:03.960 --> 1:13:08.020
 but that we can't do it all in one session

1:13:08.020 --> 1:13:10.740
 because the frequency of sessions distributed

1:13:10.740 --> 1:13:12.000
 throughout the week correlates

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.360
 with the improvements in limb range of motion.

1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:17.640
 So what this means is that we should probably be doing

1:13:17.640 --> 1:13:20.600
 anywhere from two to four sets

1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:23.640
 of 30 second static hold stretches,

1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:28.640
 five days per week, or some variant thereof.

1:13:29.640 --> 1:13:31.560
 And I do say some variant thereof,

1:13:31.560 --> 1:13:33.200
 because it turns out that even though there was

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:35.160
 that earlier study that we talked about,

1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:37.960
 that holding a stretch for more than 30 seconds,

1:13:37.960 --> 1:13:39.580
 in that case, 60 seconds,

1:13:39.580 --> 1:13:42.400
 didn't turn out to be additionally beneficial.

1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:45.060
 It appears that if you do hold those stretches

1:13:45.060 --> 1:13:49.080
 for 60 seconds per static stretching set, for instance,

1:13:49.080 --> 1:13:53.460
 you can get away with stretching fewer days per week overall.

1:13:53.460 --> 1:13:56.900
 So in order to make this as clear as possible,

1:13:56.900 --> 1:13:59.320
 because I do realize there are a lot of parameters,

1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:00.500
 and you might be asking,

1:14:00.500 --> 1:14:01.660
 why didn't you just make me a list

1:14:01.660 --> 1:14:03.000
 of the exact things I should do?

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.120
 Well, it doesn't work that way

1:14:04.120 --> 1:14:06.080
 because once you understand the mechanisms

1:14:06.080 --> 1:14:08.400
 and once you understand your particular goals,

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:10.680
 this information is designed for you to be able

1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:12.360
 to construct a stretching program

1:14:12.360 --> 1:14:14.560
 that is tailored to your specific goals.

1:14:14.560 --> 1:14:16.960
 If I just gave you the stretching program that I'm doing,

1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:18.480
 or I should say that I'm soon to be doing,

1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:21.520
 because I'm soon to be doing one based on the research

1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:23.520
 for this particular episode,

1:14:23.520 --> 1:14:25.440
 well, that wouldn't be beneficial for you.

1:14:25.440 --> 1:14:28.360
 Because for instance, if you have very flexible hamstrings,

1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:30.320
 but not very flexible quadriceps,

1:14:30.320 --> 1:14:32.920
 or you are somebody who is engaged in sport

1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:34.900
 or not engaged in sport,

1:14:34.900 --> 1:14:36.920
 what you need to do is going to vary somewhat.

1:14:36.920 --> 1:14:40.340
 So what would effective stretching protocol look like?

1:14:40.340 --> 1:14:42.580
 We're all trying to improve limb range of motion

1:14:42.580 --> 1:14:45.900
 for different limbs and different muscle groups,

1:14:45.900 --> 1:14:47.160
 but just by way of example,

1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:48.400
 and that's because the one we've been using,

1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:51.540
 let's talk about hamstrings for the time being.

1:14:51.540 --> 1:14:54.240
 This could of course be applied to other muscle groups.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:57.040
 Let's say you want to improve hamstring flexibility

1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:00.000
 and limb range of motion about and around the hamstring

1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:02.400
 and involving the hamstring.

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:06.720
 You would want to do three sets

1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:09.020
 of static stretching for the hamstring.

1:15:09.020 --> 1:15:11.880
 Again, easy to find such exercises on the internet.

1:15:13.700 --> 1:15:18.200
 You would do that by holding the stretch for 30 seconds,

1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:20.480
 resting some period of time and doing it again,

1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:23.100
 holding for 30 seconds, resting some period of time,

1:15:23.100 --> 1:15:26.280
 and then holding it for 30 seconds.

1:15:26.280 --> 1:15:28.680
 That would be one training session for the hamstrings.

1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:30.800
 I have to imagine that you'd probably want to stretch

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:33.520
 other muscle groups as well in that same session.

1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:34.960
 Although at least as far as I could tell,

1:15:34.960 --> 1:15:36.920
 there were no data pointing to the fact

1:15:36.920 --> 1:15:38.860
 that you couldn't do your hamstring stretching

1:15:38.860 --> 1:15:39.700
 one part of the day

1:15:39.700 --> 1:15:42.000
 and your quadriceps stretching another part of the day,

1:15:42.000 --> 1:15:44.160
 but presumably you're going to want to combine

1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:47.900
 your flexibility training into one single session.

1:15:47.900 --> 1:15:52.900
 So three sets of 30 seconds each, get 90 seconds,

1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:56.960
 and you would do that ideally five times a week,

1:15:56.960 --> 1:15:59.680
 or maybe even more, because it does seem like frequency

1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:02.000
 distributed throughout the week is an important parameter.

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.440
 Now, one thing that we have not highlighted

1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:07.160
 or at least described is how long to rest

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:09.140
 between stretching sets.

1:16:09.140 --> 1:16:11.320
 And despite my efforts,

1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:15.560
 I could not find research back information

1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:18.740
 that pointed to whether or not 30 seconds of rest

1:16:18.740 --> 1:16:20.160
 for every 30 seconds stretching

1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:23.480
 or 60 seconds rest for every 30 seconds stretching

1:16:23.480 --> 1:16:24.800
 was ideal.

1:16:24.800 --> 1:16:26.960
 I think it's reasonable to assume that

1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:30.700
 doubling the amount of time for the interleaving rest

1:16:30.700 --> 1:16:33.700
 would be appropriate or at least doable.

1:16:33.700 --> 1:16:35.520
 If anyone out there has knowledge about

1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:39.420
 rest between stretching sets and has some physiology

1:16:39.420 --> 1:16:42.720
 or some biology or some experiential information

1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:46.960
 as to why a given ratio of duration of static stretch

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:50.200
 to rest in between static stretch sets ought to be used,

1:16:50.200 --> 1:16:52.400
 please put it in the comments on YouTube.

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:54.460
 That'd be a terrific way for us to get that information.

1:16:54.460 --> 1:16:57.220
 I'd love to do any follow-up to links that you provide

1:16:57.220 --> 1:16:58.620
 and so on.

1:16:58.620 --> 1:17:02.060
 But now we're starting to build into a protocol

1:17:02.060 --> 1:17:04.920
 that is backed by the scientific data.

1:17:04.920 --> 1:17:08.920
 Three sets of 30 seconds of holds done five times

1:17:08.920 --> 1:17:11.360
 or maybe even six times per week.

1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:14.740
 One thing that did show up in my exploration

1:17:14.740 --> 1:17:16.260
 of the peer-reviewed research

1:17:16.260 --> 1:17:18.360
 is this notion of warming up for all this.

1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:20.720
 We haven't talked about that yet.

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.120
 In general, to avoid injury,

1:17:22.120 --> 1:17:24.440
 it's a good idea to raise your core body temperature a bit

1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:27.120
 before doing these kinds of stretches,

1:17:27.120 --> 1:17:28.440
 even these static stretches,

1:17:28.440 --> 1:17:29.860
 which we can sort of ease into

1:17:29.860 --> 1:17:33.840
 and don't involve ballistic movement by definition.

1:17:33.840 --> 1:17:38.600
 And the basic takeaway that I was able to find was that

1:17:38.600 --> 1:17:42.180
 if we are already warm from running or from weight training

1:17:42.180 --> 1:17:44.440
 or from some other activity,

1:17:44.440 --> 1:17:47.120
 that doing the static stretching practice

1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:50.320
 at the end of that weight training or cardiovascular

1:17:50.320 --> 1:17:53.240
 or other physical session would allow us to go immediately

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:54.720
 into the stretching session

1:17:55.560 --> 1:17:57.800
 because we're already warm, so to speak.

1:17:57.800 --> 1:18:01.520
 Otherwise, raising one's core body temperature by a bit

1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:04.620
 by doing five to seven, maybe even 10 minutes

1:18:04.620 --> 1:18:08.420
 of easy cardiovascular exercise or calisthenic movements

1:18:08.420 --> 1:18:11.100
 provided you can do those without getting injured,

1:18:11.100 --> 1:18:13.680
 seems to be an ideal way to warm up the body for stretching.

1:18:13.680 --> 1:18:16.520
 We should be warm or warm up to stretch,

1:18:16.520 --> 1:18:19.200
 although those warmups don't have to be extremely extensive.

1:18:19.200 --> 1:18:20.840
 And then just by way of logic,

1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:23.640
 doing the static stretching after resistance training

1:18:23.640 --> 1:18:26.300
 or cardiovascular training seems to be most beneficial.

1:18:26.300 --> 1:18:28.400
 In fact, and unfortunately we don't have time

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:30.400
 to go into this in too much detail today,

1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:34.240
 I was able to find a number of papers that make the argument

1:18:34.240 --> 1:18:38.060
 that static stretching prior to cardiovascular training,

1:18:38.060 --> 1:18:41.800
 and maybe even prior to resistance training

1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:44.960
 can limit our performance in running

1:18:44.960 --> 1:18:46.040
 and resistance training.

1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:48.240
 I realize that's a controversial area.

1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:51.320
 You have those who say, no, it's immensely beneficial.

1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:53.780
 You have those who say, no, it inhibits performance.

1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:56.800
 And those that say, no, it's a matter of how exactly

1:18:56.800 --> 1:18:59.280
 you perform that static stretching and which muscle groups

1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:02.360
 and how you're doing this and how much time in between

1:19:02.360 --> 1:19:03.720
 static stretching and performance.

1:19:03.720 --> 1:19:06.560
 But to leave all that aside, doing static stretching

1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:09.560
 after some other form of exercise,

1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:12.800
 and if not after some form of exercise,

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:15.520
 after a brief warmup to raise your core body temperature,

1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:17.520
 definitely seems like the right way to go.

1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:18.640
 Now, for some of you out there,

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.680
 and I confess for me as well,

1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:23.200
 doing something five days a week seems like a big commitment

1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:26.000
 even if that commitment is one to only do three sets

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.820
 of 30 second static stretches.

1:19:28.820 --> 1:19:31.320
 I say this because you've got the warmup.

1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:33.480
 I generally like to bring a kind of a focus

1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:35.060
 and dedication to a practice.

1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:39.100
 And of course, because when doing these kinds of protocols,

1:19:39.960 --> 1:19:41.960
 it's likely that you're not just stretching your hamstrings.

1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:43.660
 So it's not just 90 seconds of work

1:19:43.660 --> 1:19:45.560
 with a minute of rest in between,

1:19:45.560 --> 1:19:48.440
 but very likely that we're also doing quadriceps stretching

1:19:48.440 --> 1:19:50.200
 and also doing stretching for the shoulders

1:19:50.200 --> 1:19:52.320
 and stretching for the back and the neck and so on.

1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:54.960
 And so that entire session is going to take some time.

1:19:54.960 --> 1:19:57.440
 And five days a week is a pretty serious commitment for most,

1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:00.200
 especially for those of us that don't exercise

1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:03.600
 or do athletics for a living, which I don't.

1:20:03.600 --> 1:20:06.360
 So there is some evidence from the literature

1:20:06.360 --> 1:20:08.040
 that one can get away with,

1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:09.680
 or I don't even know that we should think about it

1:20:09.680 --> 1:20:10.500
 as getting away with,

1:20:10.500 --> 1:20:14.120
 but that one can do longer hold static stretches

1:20:14.120 --> 1:20:17.240
 of up to say 60 seconds,

1:20:17.240 --> 1:20:20.920
 but do fewer total sessions per week.

1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:24.200
 So rather than three 30 second static holds,

1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:27.480
 doing three 60 second static holds

1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:30.080
 and doing those every other day.

1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:32.720
 And there really hasn't been a systematic exploration

1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:34.960
 of this, the article that I was referring to

1:20:34.960 --> 1:20:36.200
 just a few moments ago,

1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:40.680
 this analysis of the 23 articles

1:20:40.680 --> 1:20:43.120
 was combined into this enormous set of tables

1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:45.320
 and some really quite nice graphs

1:20:45.320 --> 1:20:46.720
 that you're welcome to look at

1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:49.040
 since we're going to provide a link to the study.

1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:52.040
 There are a couple of key takeaways that I want to mention

1:20:52.040 --> 1:20:53.720
 that are separate from this issue of

1:20:53.720 --> 1:20:55.920
 how long to stretch and how often.

1:20:55.920 --> 1:20:59.600
 First of all, they describe in their discussion

1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:04.120
 that there were improvements in range of motion independent

1:21:04.120 --> 1:21:07.040
 of whether or not people did static stretching,

1:21:07.040 --> 1:21:08.800
 active stretching, passive stretching,

1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:11.920
 ballistic stretching, or PNF stretching.

1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:13.600
 So all of those forms of stretching

1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:15.480
 will improve limb range of motion.

1:21:15.480 --> 1:21:17.140
 This is essential to point out,

1:21:17.140 --> 1:21:19.280
 and I want to emphasize this.

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:20.820
 Static stretching, however,

1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:25.920
 gave the greatest degree of gains in limb range of motion.

1:21:25.920 --> 1:21:29.760
 And on average, they saw a 20.9% increase,

1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:32.200
 but some of the other increases they observed

1:21:32.200 --> 1:21:34.160
 were also quite substantial.

1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:36.640
 So ballistic stretching can also provide

1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:40.480
 some pretty impressive limb range of motion improvements.

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:43.240
 However, they tended to be in the range of,

1:21:43.240 --> 1:21:45.920
 here they point out 11.65% increase,

1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:48.360
 or in the case of PNF, a 15% increase.

1:21:48.360 --> 1:21:51.280
 So it appears that the greatest improvements

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:54.020
 in limb range of motion for your time spent

1:21:54.020 --> 1:21:57.040
 and effort spent is going to be this minimum

1:21:57.040 --> 1:22:00.100
 of five minutes per week to elicit a significant response,

1:22:00.100 --> 1:22:01.640
 with five days being the minimum

1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:03.220
 weekly recommended frequency

1:22:03.220 --> 1:22:07.420
 to achieve significant range of motion improvements.

1:22:07.420 --> 1:22:10.320
 I confess this was pretty surprising to me

1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:13.960
 when I compare flexibility training to, say,

1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:16.360
 resistance training for strength and hypertrophy.

1:22:16.360 --> 1:22:17.360
 I've had the experience,

1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:19.100
 and I know that other people have had the experience,

1:22:19.100 --> 1:22:23.260
 and I think Dr. Andy Galpin would probably agree

1:22:23.260 --> 1:22:27.060
 that provided one trains hard enough and appropriately,

1:22:27.060 --> 1:22:30.680
 that you don't need to train resistance training

1:22:30.680 --> 1:22:33.740
 five days a week in order to get significant improvements

1:22:33.740 --> 1:22:34.840
 in strength and hypertrophy.

1:22:34.840 --> 1:22:36.180
 Some people might need to,

1:22:36.180 --> 1:22:39.080
 but you can get a lot of positive results

1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:42.160
 in those variables with less frequent training,

1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:45.600
 certainly with three or four days a week of training.

1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:47.260
 And for cardiovascular training,

1:22:47.260 --> 1:22:49.200
 I'm not aware of anyone having tested

1:22:49.200 --> 1:22:51.360
 whether or not one very long run each week

1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:53.240
 can actually increase cardiovascular fitness

1:22:53.240 --> 1:22:54.260
 and you're not doing anything else,

1:22:54.260 --> 1:22:55.940
 although I have to imagine you'd probably see

1:22:55.940 --> 1:22:58.020
 some improvement compared to not doing anything.

1:22:58.020 --> 1:23:01.620
 But most people are doing repeated training sessions

1:23:01.620 --> 1:23:04.100
 of cardiovascular strength training.

1:23:04.100 --> 1:23:06.860
 Not a lot of people are doing five days a week

1:23:06.860 --> 1:23:09.500
 of strength training, at least that I'm aware of.

1:23:09.500 --> 1:23:12.140
 Some people are, but most people I think are not.

1:23:12.140 --> 1:23:15.400
 And some people are doing five or more days a week

1:23:15.400 --> 1:23:17.400
 of cardiovascular training.

1:23:17.400 --> 1:23:20.680
 I'm guessing that most people are not doing five days a week

1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:24.100
 of dedicated static stretch range of motion

1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:25.740
 directed training.

1:23:25.740 --> 1:23:29.200
 But it does appear that that frequency about the week,

1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:30.440
 getting those repeated sessions,

1:23:30.440 --> 1:23:32.780
 even if they are short for an individual muscle group

1:23:32.780 --> 1:23:34.020
 turns out to be important.

1:23:34.020 --> 1:23:37.460
 And so that points to the, perhaps the reason

1:23:37.460 --> 1:23:40.480
 why so few people are doing dedicated range of motion work.

1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:44.560
 But it also reminds me that all of the studies

1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:46.620
 that were described, at least in this review

1:23:46.620 --> 1:23:48.700
 and some of the other ones that were not

1:23:48.700 --> 1:23:52.120
 really show impressive changes in limb range of motion.

1:23:52.120 --> 1:23:56.140
 I mean, 20 plus percent or even 15% with PNF.

1:23:56.140 --> 1:23:59.040
 I mean, these are big changes that are going to benefit us.

1:23:59.040 --> 1:24:01.460
 They're going to offset the age-related losses

1:24:01.460 --> 1:24:03.280
 in flexibility for sure,

1:24:03.280 --> 1:24:05.540
 if one is dedicated about these practices.

1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:08.780
 And in many cases, they're going to increase limb range

1:24:08.780 --> 1:24:11.420
 of motion in ways that are going to allow us

1:24:11.420 --> 1:24:13.780
 better performance in certain physical endeavors,

1:24:13.780 --> 1:24:15.140
 certainly better balance.

1:24:15.140 --> 1:24:17.300
 Or we haven't really talked about balance and stability,

1:24:17.300 --> 1:24:21.200
 but range of motion can impair balance and stability

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:22.740
 in some extreme circumstances.

1:24:22.740 --> 1:24:24.760
 But by and large, limb range of motion,

1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:26.420
 lack of tightness, improved posture,

1:24:26.420 --> 1:24:29.260
 improved physical performance, excuse me,

1:24:29.260 --> 1:24:31.940
 and things of that sort is something that I think

1:24:31.940 --> 1:24:34.580
 we can all benefit from and that are key features

1:24:34.580 --> 1:24:35.600
 of longevity.

1:24:35.600 --> 1:24:37.900
 We don't often think of them because we so prioritize

1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:39.660
 cardiovascular health and the relationship

1:24:39.660 --> 1:24:41.960
 between the heart and brain health and resistance training

1:24:41.960 --> 1:24:46.960
 and musculoskeletal hypertrophy or strength, et cetera.

1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:49.260
 But as I delved into this literature,

1:24:49.260 --> 1:24:51.940
 it really highlighted for me the extent to which

1:24:51.940 --> 1:24:54.600
 having really good limb range of motion,

1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:56.700
 at least maintaining limb range of motion

1:24:56.700 --> 1:24:58.820
 as we age from year to year,

1:24:58.820 --> 1:25:01.220
 and maybe even improving limb range of motion

1:25:01.220 --> 1:25:04.500
 can be immensely beneficial for reducing pain,

1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:06.980
 for again, improving posture,

1:25:06.980 --> 1:25:10.180
 improving our ability to perform, to walk, et cetera.

1:25:10.180 --> 1:25:12.220
 And indeed there's a whole literature

1:25:12.220 --> 1:25:14.460
 that relates our limb range of motion

1:25:14.460 --> 1:25:17.140
 to things like pain management of things related

1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:19.140
 to headache and so on and so forth.

1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:22.160
 So limb range of motion is not just about becoming

1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:25.300
 a contortionist or being able to complete the yoga class.

1:25:25.300 --> 1:25:27.820
 It really is about maintaining the integrity and the health

1:25:27.820 --> 1:25:31.340
 of the neuromuscular system, the connective tissue,

1:25:31.340 --> 1:25:33.860
 and the neuromuscular connective network,

1:25:33.860 --> 1:25:35.300
 because those are indeed working

1:25:35.300 --> 1:25:37.140
 as an ecosystem and a network.

1:25:37.140 --> 1:25:40.020
 I'd like to just briefly touch on PNF stretching

1:25:40.020 --> 1:25:40.860
 for a moment.

1:25:40.860 --> 1:25:44.820
 Again, this is a vast landscape with many parameters

1:25:44.820 --> 1:25:45.780
 and different practitioners,

1:25:45.780 --> 1:25:50.780
 a lot of competing opinions out there to put it lightly.

1:25:52.260 --> 1:25:54.340
 Nonetheless, I do want to emphasize

1:25:54.340 --> 1:25:57.480
 that the PNF training leverages those spindle mechanisms

1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:00.540
 and GTO mechanisms that we talked about earlier.

1:26:00.540 --> 1:26:02.420
 But I realized that in describing

1:26:02.420 --> 1:26:05.920
 the quadricep contraction hamstring stretch,

1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:08.720
 little mini experiment that hopefully you did,

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:11.220
 that I didn't really highlight the role of the GTOs,

1:26:11.220 --> 1:26:13.220
 the Golgi tendon organs that much.

1:26:13.220 --> 1:26:16.220
 And I just would like to just briefly do that for a moment.

1:26:16.220 --> 1:26:20.300
 The GTOs have multiple functions.

1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:22.180
 In fact, I think even though GTOs are

1:26:22.180 --> 1:26:24.740
 in every medical textbook, every physiology textbook,

1:26:24.740 --> 1:26:27.640
 every first year neuroscientist learns about them

1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:29.420
 when learning about the neuromuscular junctions

1:26:29.420 --> 1:26:32.180
 and the mechanisms of interoception, et cetera,

1:26:32.180 --> 1:26:34.660
 they are likely to have other functions as well.

1:26:34.660 --> 1:26:39.260
 And one of the reasons why PNF stretching does work,

1:26:39.260 --> 1:26:42.260
 whether or not you're doing that by using a strap

1:26:42.260 --> 1:26:43.980
 to pull back a limb,

1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:46.420
 or whether or not you're actively contracting

1:26:46.420 --> 1:26:48.620
 your quadriceps to then release

1:26:48.620 --> 1:26:52.580
 and emphasize stretch range of motion for your hamstrings

1:26:52.580 --> 1:26:54.140
 and related muscle groups,

1:26:54.140 --> 1:26:58.020
 is that activation of those GTOs,

1:26:58.020 --> 1:27:02.500
 meaning putting loads and tension into that system,

1:27:02.500 --> 1:27:04.780
 can inhibit the spindles

1:27:04.780 --> 1:27:07.980
 in the opposite antagonistic muscle groups.

1:27:07.980 --> 1:27:11.280
 And so one of the reasons why flexing,

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:14.460
 or I should say contracting your quadriceps

1:27:14.460 --> 1:27:16.700
 really intensely for some period of time,

1:27:16.700 --> 1:27:19.940
 allows your hamstrings to subsequently experience

1:27:19.940 --> 1:27:21.580
 greater range of motion.

1:27:21.580 --> 1:27:22.980
 And again, it's not just the hamstrings,

1:27:22.980 --> 1:27:24.780
 but the related connective tissue

1:27:24.780 --> 1:27:27.140
 and neural circuits, et cetera,

1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:32.060
 is because yes, it's quote unquote relaxing

1:27:32.060 --> 1:27:34.240
 the hamstrings and the spindle,

1:27:34.240 --> 1:27:37.920
 but there's also a direct relationship

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:42.060
 between activation of the GTOs in the quadricep

1:27:42.060 --> 1:27:45.740
 and release of the spindles

1:27:45.740 --> 1:27:47.380
 in the hamstring and related muscles.

1:27:47.380 --> 1:27:49.900
 This has a name, it's called autogenic inhibition.

1:27:49.900 --> 1:27:53.700
 It's a fancy name for contraction of one muscle group,

1:27:53.700 --> 1:27:56.300
 providing a relaxation of the other muscle group

1:27:57.140 --> 1:27:59.260
 that's antagonistic to it.

1:27:59.260 --> 1:28:01.820
 And it relates back to this idea of interleaving sets

1:28:01.820 --> 1:28:02.660
 in the gym.

1:28:02.660 --> 1:28:05.020
 So if you think back to that example,

1:28:05.020 --> 1:28:08.280
 now it should make sense as to why, for instance,

1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:10.740
 if you do, let's say a set of bench presses

1:28:10.740 --> 1:28:13.000
 or shoulder presses, and you,

1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:16.020
 let's say you get 10 repetitions and you fail on the 11th,

1:28:16.020 --> 1:28:18.300
 that muscle is very, very fatigued.

1:28:18.300 --> 1:28:20.220
 If you were to rest some period of time

1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:22.020
 and then go back and do another set,

1:28:22.860 --> 1:28:26.100
 well, during the rest, that muscle group has been relaxing.

1:28:26.100 --> 1:28:27.940
 It's obviously not contracting the same way it was

1:28:27.940 --> 1:28:29.820
 during the resistance set.

1:28:29.820 --> 1:28:32.540
 But by going and doing a pulling exercise

1:28:32.540 --> 1:28:34.500
 that involves the antagonistic muscle group,

1:28:34.500 --> 1:28:37.320
 so strongly contracting the back muscles through a pull,

1:28:37.320 --> 1:28:41.620
 like a pull down or a chin up or a row type exercise,

1:28:41.620 --> 1:28:45.980
 you're activating or near activating the GTO system

1:28:45.980 --> 1:28:47.860
 in those pulling muscles in a way

1:28:47.860 --> 1:28:52.760
 that provides autogenic inhibition for the pushing muscles.

1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:55.480
 Now, again, the physios out there

1:28:55.480 --> 1:28:58.100
 are probably either screaming or banging their heads

1:28:58.100 --> 1:28:59.940
 against whatever sound system

1:28:59.940 --> 1:29:01.540
 this happens to be arriving through

1:29:01.540 --> 1:29:04.140
 to them saying, wait, but in many cases,

1:29:04.140 --> 1:29:05.800
 the GTOs aren't activated enough

1:29:05.800 --> 1:29:07.580
 to provide that autogenic inhibition.

1:29:07.580 --> 1:29:11.660
 That's true, but even the sub-threshold activation

1:29:11.660 --> 1:29:13.480
 of those intraspinal circuits,

1:29:13.480 --> 1:29:15.700
 so the place where the GTO circuit

1:29:15.700 --> 1:29:17.500
 and the spindle circuit interact,

1:29:17.500 --> 1:29:20.860
 can provide an additional replenishment

1:29:20.860 --> 1:29:22.900
 of say the pushing muscles

1:29:22.900 --> 1:29:24.700
 while you're activating those pulling muscles.

1:29:24.700 --> 1:29:26.660
 And this is at least one, not the only,

1:29:26.660 --> 1:29:28.980
 but at least one mechanisms by which interleaving

1:29:28.980 --> 1:29:30.940
 push and pull, push and pull

1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:33.060
 for both strength and hypertrophy training,

1:29:33.060 --> 1:29:37.540
 but also for range of motion stretching type training

1:29:37.540 --> 1:29:40.620
 can allow you to achieve better results

1:29:40.620 --> 1:29:42.300
 in a shorter period of time.

1:29:42.300 --> 1:29:44.920
 And I raise this because I want to keep in mind

1:29:44.920 --> 1:29:47.220
 the efficiency of any training program.

1:29:47.220 --> 1:29:50.420
 We just a moment ago established that doing,

1:29:50.420 --> 1:29:53.280
 for example, three sets of 30 seconds static holds

1:29:53.280 --> 1:29:54.900
 can be very useful for the hamstrings

1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:58.980
 with let's just say for sake of simplicity and practicality,

1:29:58.980 --> 1:30:00.620
 a minute's rest in between.

1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:02.500
 But during that minute's rest,

1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:06.340
 you can stretch the opposite antagonistic muscle group,

1:30:06.340 --> 1:30:08.340
 such as the quadriceps.

1:30:08.340 --> 1:30:10.740
 Or if you want to use PNF training,

1:30:10.740 --> 1:30:13.800
 you could do loading of the quadriceps in between.

1:30:13.800 --> 1:30:15.020
 So there are a number of different ways

1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:19.100
 in which you can start to interleave static stretching

1:30:19.100 --> 1:30:20.840
 with PNF stretching.

1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:24.500
 You can start to interleave even PNF type protocols

1:30:24.500 --> 1:30:25.500
 with resistance training,

1:30:25.500 --> 1:30:27.760
 although that gets a bit more complicated.

1:30:27.760 --> 1:30:30.300
 You can really start to construct and build protocols

1:30:30.300 --> 1:30:31.800
 that are ideal for you.

1:30:32.700 --> 1:30:36.840
 What we will do is for an upcoming neural network newsletter.

1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:38.160
 So for those of you that aren't familiar,

1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:39.180
 the Huberman Lab Podcast

1:30:39.180 --> 1:30:40.920
 has a so-called neural network newsletter.

1:30:40.920 --> 1:30:42.160
 These are monthly newsletters

1:30:42.160 --> 1:30:45.400
 where we put distilled points from the podcast

1:30:45.400 --> 1:30:48.860
 and oftentimes protocols in a downloadable PDF form.

1:30:48.860 --> 1:30:50.380
 You can access it by giving us your email.

1:30:50.380 --> 1:30:51.900
 We don't share your email with anybody.

1:30:51.900 --> 1:30:53.060
 If you want to see examples of these,

1:30:53.060 --> 1:30:54.560
 you can go to HubermanLab.com

1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:56.260
 and go to the menu and see newsletter.

1:30:56.260 --> 1:30:57.360
 You don't have to sign up for anything

1:30:57.360 --> 1:30:59.500
 to see examples of what these are like.

1:30:59.500 --> 1:31:01.880
 I'll provide a couple of different protocols,

1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:04.620
 one that is pure static stretching,

1:31:04.620 --> 1:31:07.800
 one that involves PNF type stretching.

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:10.780
 And I'll also put down a protocol

1:31:10.780 --> 1:31:13.980
 that involves the antagonistic interleaved muscle training

1:31:13.980 --> 1:31:15.180
 of the sort that I've been describing

1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:16.900
 a few times throughout this episode.

1:31:16.900 --> 1:31:19.900
 And then you can try and apply those either separately

1:31:19.900 --> 1:31:21.660
 or maybe combine them in some way

1:31:21.660 --> 1:31:23.220
 that's useful for your goals.

1:31:23.220 --> 1:31:24.740
 There are a couple of key elements

1:31:24.740 --> 1:31:27.580
 that are essential for building a safe and effective

1:31:27.580 --> 1:31:30.580
 range of motion increasing program

1:31:30.580 --> 1:31:33.260
 that arrived to us both through the peer reviewed research

1:31:33.260 --> 1:31:35.980
 and admittedly from people that have been involved

1:31:35.980 --> 1:31:38.500
 in teaching and training range of motion

1:31:38.500 --> 1:31:40.340
 for a very long period of time.

1:31:40.340 --> 1:31:41.580
 Some of you may be familiar

1:31:41.580 --> 1:31:43.180
 with the so-called Anderson Method.

1:31:43.180 --> 1:31:45.180
 It's been around for a long time.

1:31:45.180 --> 1:31:46.700
 I actually have never met Anderson.

1:31:46.700 --> 1:31:48.020
 I don't, I should know this.

1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:49.280
 I don't even know if he's still alive.

1:31:49.280 --> 1:31:50.480
 I hope he's still alive.

1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:53.060
 But in any event, there are a lot of different features

1:31:53.060 --> 1:31:55.160
 to the Anderson and other protocols.

1:31:55.160 --> 1:31:57.720
 But one of the aspects of the Anderson protocol

1:31:57.720 --> 1:31:59.300
 that I think is highly relevant,

1:31:59.300 --> 1:32:01.500
 in fact, I know is relevant to the peer reviewed research

1:32:01.500 --> 1:32:03.580
 that we're going to talk about in a few moments,

1:32:03.580 --> 1:32:06.820
 is this notion of pushing through pain

1:32:06.820 --> 1:32:10.740
 and how active or how passive to be about static stretching.

1:32:10.740 --> 1:32:12.780
 Now this is somewhat subjective, right?

1:32:12.780 --> 1:32:15.700
 If you think about getting into a stretch,

1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:17.540
 again, we'll just use the hamstrings for example.

1:32:17.540 --> 1:32:19.700
 So you're either reaching for your toes

1:32:19.700 --> 1:32:23.820
 while seated, or maybe you're using a strap

1:32:23.820 --> 1:32:27.100
 and you're raising your foot overhead while lying down,

1:32:27.100 --> 1:32:31.220
 or maybe you're doing a toe touch type exercise.

1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:34.020
 How far should you reach?

1:32:34.020 --> 1:32:36.220
 Where is the end range of motion?

1:32:36.220 --> 1:32:37.060
 Should you bounce?

1:32:37.060 --> 1:32:37.880
 Should you not bounce?

1:32:37.880 --> 1:32:38.720
 We're going to talk a little bit more

1:32:38.720 --> 1:32:40.020
 about that in a moment.

1:32:40.020 --> 1:32:42.660
 But Anderson has an interesting idea and principle

1:32:42.660 --> 1:32:44.980
 which is thread through a lot of his teachings

1:32:44.980 --> 1:32:47.220
 that I think are very much in keeping

1:32:47.220 --> 1:32:49.660
 with the study that I'm about to describe next.

1:32:49.660 --> 1:32:53.180
 Where he emphasizes to yes,

1:32:53.180 --> 1:32:56.520
 to stretch to the end of the range of motion,

1:32:56.520 --> 1:32:59.340
 but not to focus so much on where that range of motion

1:32:59.340 --> 1:33:01.300
 happens to be that day.

1:33:01.300 --> 1:33:03.820
 So for instance, not thinking,

1:33:03.820 --> 1:33:06.880
 oh, I can always touch my toes, for instance,

1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:09.240
 and therefore that's the starting place

1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:11.820
 for my flexibility training today.

1:33:11.820 --> 1:33:15.120
 But rather to take the entirety of your system

1:33:15.120 --> 1:33:17.060
 into account each day and understand that,

1:33:17.060 --> 1:33:19.780
 okay, provided you're warmed up appropriately,

1:33:19.780 --> 1:33:21.420
 that you're now going to stretch your hamstrings,

1:33:21.420 --> 1:33:24.500
 for instance, and you're going to reach down for your toes,

1:33:24.500 --> 1:33:27.580
 but that your range of motion might be adjusted that day

1:33:27.580 --> 1:33:29.660
 by way of tension and stress,

1:33:29.660 --> 1:33:31.900
 or by way of ambient temperature in the room.

1:33:31.900 --> 1:33:34.660
 And to basically define the end range of motion

1:33:34.660 --> 1:33:37.780
 as the place where you can feel the stretch

1:33:37.780 --> 1:33:39.380
 in the relevant muscle groups.

1:33:39.380 --> 1:33:43.140
 I think this is important because unlike resistance training

1:33:43.140 --> 1:33:44.780
 or cardiovascular training,

1:33:44.780 --> 1:33:47.400
 where we can measure distance traveled over time

1:33:47.400 --> 1:33:48.860
 in the case of cardiovascular training,

1:33:48.860 --> 1:33:50.620
 or how much weight is on the bar

1:33:50.620 --> 1:33:52.860
 and count repetitions, et cetera,

1:33:52.860 --> 1:33:54.840
 with range of motion training,

1:33:54.840 --> 1:33:56.980
 of course, range of motion is the feature

1:33:56.980 --> 1:33:58.200
 that we're interested in,

1:33:58.200 --> 1:34:02.220
 but there is likely to be a lot of variation from day to day

1:34:02.220 --> 1:34:04.060
 based on a number of different internal

1:34:04.060 --> 1:34:05.500
 and external factors.

1:34:05.500 --> 1:34:07.820
 And so the Anderson method is really about

1:34:07.820 --> 1:34:10.500
 getting into static and other forms of stretching.

1:34:10.500 --> 1:34:12.080
 I think today we've mainly been focusing

1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:15.300
 on static stretching and holding the end range of motion,

1:34:15.300 --> 1:34:18.140
 but really paying attention to the feel of the stretch

1:34:18.140 --> 1:34:19.500
 and the muscles involved.

1:34:19.500 --> 1:34:21.520
 And there are parallels in resistance

1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:23.820
 in cardiovascular training too, I realize, right?

1:34:23.820 --> 1:34:26.220
 In the case of trying to build hypertrophy,

1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:29.160
 or I should say improve hypertrophy muscle size,

1:34:29.160 --> 1:34:32.180
 oftentimes the best advice that one can give

1:34:32.180 --> 1:34:33.940
 is to don't try to lift weights,

1:34:33.940 --> 1:34:35.400
 but rather to challenge muscles.

1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:37.220
 Now, of course, you need to provide adequate loads

1:34:37.220 --> 1:34:38.760
 in order to get hypertrophy,

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:40.400
 but when you're training purely for strength,

1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:42.480
 it's about moving weights.

1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:44.160
 When you're training purely for hypertrophy

1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:45.260
 or mainly for hypertrophy,

1:34:45.260 --> 1:34:47.260
 it's really about challenging muscles

1:34:47.260 --> 1:34:49.500
 using weights or other forms of resistance.

1:34:49.500 --> 1:34:54.040
 And similarly, and in keeping with this Anderson method,

1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:57.260
 when trying to build limb range of motion,

1:34:57.260 --> 1:35:00.740
 doing static stretching at a place where it's difficult,

1:35:00.740 --> 1:35:03.780
 but that you can experience the stretch of the muscle

1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:05.700
 cognitively, consciously,

1:35:05.700 --> 1:35:08.800
 being able to focus on the muscles and their stretch

1:35:08.800 --> 1:35:12.660
 is at least as useful as is evaluating

1:35:12.660 --> 1:35:14.660
 the current range of motion you're able to achieve.

1:35:14.660 --> 1:35:15.500
 So what does this mean?

1:35:15.500 --> 1:35:17.400
 This means feel the muscles as you stretch them,

1:35:17.400 --> 1:35:18.700
 don't just go through the motions.

1:35:18.700 --> 1:35:21.340
 And this means don't get so attached

1:35:21.340 --> 1:35:23.700
 to being able to always achieve, for instance,

1:35:23.700 --> 1:35:26.900
 a stretch of a given distance within a given session.

1:35:26.900 --> 1:35:30.220
 You might actually find that by just finding the place

1:35:30.220 --> 1:35:32.100
 where you can't get much further

1:35:32.100 --> 1:35:34.260
 and holding the static stretch there,

1:35:34.260 --> 1:35:35.680
 that on the second and third set

1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:36.820
 that you happen to be doing that day,

1:35:36.820 --> 1:35:40.100
 that your range of motion will be increased considerably.

1:35:40.100 --> 1:35:42.580
 Maybe not, but very likely, yes, you will.

1:35:42.580 --> 1:35:46.180
 And of course, evaluating range of motion over time

1:35:46.180 --> 1:35:47.320
 is the key parameter,

1:35:47.320 --> 1:35:49.640
 because that's the goal of all this type of work.

1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:52.900
 Now, along these lines,

1:35:52.900 --> 1:35:55.220
 there is this variable that we've mentioned a few times

1:35:55.220 --> 1:35:57.340
 of passive versus active stretching.

1:35:57.340 --> 1:36:00.340
 And there's this even more nebulous variable,

1:36:00.340 --> 1:36:02.120
 this even more kind of subjective thing

1:36:02.120 --> 1:36:05.500
 of how much effort to put into it.

1:36:05.500 --> 1:36:07.640
 Should you push into the stretch?

1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:09.500
 Do you even want to bounce a tiny bit?

1:36:09.500 --> 1:36:12.600
 Would you want to reach into that end point

1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:15.960
 and try and extend it within a given set and session?

1:36:15.960 --> 1:36:20.520
 And for that reason, I was excited to find this paper

1:36:20.520 --> 1:36:22.820
 entitled, A Comparison of Two Stretching Modalities

1:36:22.820 --> 1:36:24.900
 on Lower Limb Range of Motion Measurements

1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:26.900
 in Recreational Dancers.

1:36:26.900 --> 1:36:28.640
 It happens to be done in recreational dancers.

1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:30.680
 It's a six-week intervention program

1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:32.640
 that compared low-intensity stretching,

1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:34.900
 which they call micro stretching.

1:36:34.900 --> 1:36:35.940
 They used a capital M,

1:36:35.940 --> 1:36:37.940
 so I don't know if that means that it's proprietary,

1:36:37.940 --> 1:36:41.640
 although I didn't see evidence of conflict of interest,

1:36:41.640 --> 1:36:43.420
 but they call it micro stretching.

1:36:43.420 --> 1:36:46.460
 But to be very clear,

1:36:46.460 --> 1:36:48.740
 micro stretching in the case of this manuscript

1:36:48.740 --> 1:36:50.820
 is low-intensity stretching.

1:36:50.820 --> 1:36:52.940
 And they compared that with moderate intensity

1:36:52.940 --> 1:36:56.860
 static stretching on an active and passive ranges of motion.

1:36:56.860 --> 1:36:58.900
 Okay, so there are a lot of different variables are here,

1:36:58.900 --> 1:37:01.420
 but I'll just highlight a few of the things

1:37:01.420 --> 1:37:03.120
 that are really most relevant to us.

1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:05.060
 And I'll give you the takeaway at the outset

1:37:05.060 --> 1:37:06.500
 and then return to it at the end

1:37:06.500 --> 1:37:09.420
 so that if I lose any of your attention

1:37:09.420 --> 1:37:10.380
 in the next couple of minutes,

1:37:10.380 --> 1:37:14.100
 at least you have that key takeaway.

1:37:14.100 --> 1:37:15.580
 Basically, what they found was that

1:37:15.580 --> 1:37:17.020
 a six-week training program

1:37:17.020 --> 1:37:19.780
 using very low-intensity stretching

1:37:19.780 --> 1:37:22.900
 had a greater positive effect on lower limb range of motion

1:37:22.900 --> 1:37:26.040
 than did moderate intensity static stretching.

1:37:26.040 --> 1:37:27.420
 I find that incredibly interesting.

1:37:27.420 --> 1:37:28.800
 So very low intensity,

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:31.060
 and we'll define what that means in a moment.

1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:33.640
 Here I'm quoting them.

1:37:33.640 --> 1:37:35.260
 The most interesting aspect of the study

1:37:35.260 --> 1:37:37.780
 was the greater increase in active range of motion

1:37:37.780 --> 1:37:39.360
 compared to passive range of motion

1:37:39.360 --> 1:37:40.720
 by the micro stretching group.

1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:42.620
 So this relates to what we were just talking about

1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:45.780
 a few moments ago as it relates to the Anderson method,

1:37:45.780 --> 1:37:49.940
 which is that very low-intensity stretching,

1:37:49.940 --> 1:37:53.660
 meaning effort that feels not painful,

1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:56.860
 and in fact might even feel easy

1:37:56.860 --> 1:38:01.860
 or at least not straining to exceed a given range of motion,

1:38:02.700 --> 1:38:04.920
 turns out to not just be as effective,

1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:08.660
 but more effective than moderate intensity stretching.

1:38:08.660 --> 1:38:11.080
 So what is low-intensity static stretching?

1:38:11.080 --> 1:38:13.620
 Well, they define this as the stretches were completed

1:38:13.620 --> 1:38:17.320
 at an intensity of 30 to 40%,

1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:20.820
 where 100% equals the point of pain, right?

1:38:20.820 --> 1:38:24.460
 So 30 to 40% in these individuals,

1:38:24.460 --> 1:38:25.660
 and again, I'm paraphrasing,

1:38:25.660 --> 1:38:28.620
 induced a relaxed state within the individual

1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:29.700
 and the specific muscle,

1:38:29.700 --> 1:38:31.700
 and here they were holding these static stretches,

1:38:31.700 --> 1:38:35.380
 I should mention, for one minute, not 30 seconds.

1:38:35.380 --> 1:38:37.560
 Now, the control group was doing

1:38:37.560 --> 1:38:39.580
 the exact same overall protocol,

1:38:39.580 --> 1:38:44.340
 so daily stretching for six weeks, the same exercises,

1:38:44.340 --> 1:38:47.180
 holding each set for 60 seconds,

1:38:47.180 --> 1:38:51.340
 but we're using an intensity of stretch of 80%,

1:38:51.340 --> 1:38:54.860
 where again, 100 represents the point of pain

1:38:54.860 --> 1:38:58.300
 to the point where the person would want to stop stretching.

1:38:58.300 --> 1:38:59.940
 I find these data incredibly interesting

1:38:59.940 --> 1:39:02.520
 for I think what ought to be obvious reasons.

1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:05.400
 If you're going to embark on a flexibility

1:39:05.400 --> 1:39:07.780
 and stretching training program,

1:39:07.780 --> 1:39:09.920
 you don't need to push to the point of pain.

1:39:09.920 --> 1:39:12.620
 In fact, it seems that even just approaching

1:39:12.620 --> 1:39:15.100
 the point of pain is going to be less effective

1:39:15.100 --> 1:39:20.100
 than operating at this 30 to 40% of intensity

1:39:20.380 --> 1:39:21.980
 prior to reaching that pain threshold,

1:39:21.980 --> 1:39:23.620
 the pain threshold being 100%.

1:39:23.620 --> 1:39:25.100
 Now, of course, this is pretty subjective,

1:39:25.100 --> 1:39:27.940
 but I think all of us should be able to register

1:39:27.940 --> 1:39:31.540
 within ourselves as to whether a given range of motion

1:39:31.540 --> 1:39:32.940
 or extending a given range of motion

1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:35.740
 brings us to that threshold of pain or near pain,

1:39:35.740 --> 1:39:39.780
 and according to this study, at least, operating

1:39:39.780 --> 1:39:43.300
 or performing stretching at an intensity that's quite low,

1:39:43.300 --> 1:39:46.940
 that's very relaxing, turns out to be more beneficial

1:39:46.940 --> 1:39:51.420
 in increasing range of motion than is doing exercises

1:39:51.420 --> 1:39:54.360
 aimed at increasing range of motion at a higher intensity.

1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:56.780
 Okay, so lower intensity stretching,

1:39:56.780 --> 1:39:59.340
 I should say lower intensity static stretching

1:39:59.340 --> 1:40:02.340
 appears to be the most beneficial way to approach stretching,

1:40:02.340 --> 1:40:05.600
 and I think that's a relief probably to many of us

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:08.700
 because it also suggests that the injury risk

1:40:08.700 --> 1:40:10.780
 is going to be lower than if one were pushing

1:40:10.780 --> 1:40:12.960
 into the pain zone, so to speak.

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:15.160
 The authors offer a number of different explanations

1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:17.900
 as to why this approach, this microstretching approach

1:40:17.900 --> 1:40:19.120
 might be more effective.

1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:22.440
 Here, I'm paraphrasing from their discussion

1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:25.760
 where they mentioned that it could be hypothesized

1:40:25.760 --> 1:40:28.640
 that they had improved reciprocal inhibition

1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:29.840
 within the hamstring muscle group,

1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:31.960
 so this gets right back to the sorts of neural mechanisms

1:40:31.960 --> 1:40:33.740
 that we talked about before, that somehow,

1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:35.760
 by doing this low intensity stretching,

1:40:35.760 --> 1:40:37.720
 that they were able to access some of those spindle

1:40:37.720 --> 1:40:41.000
 and GTO-type mechanisms that we were referring to earlier

1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:44.600
 and the inhibition of hamstring and quadricep stretches.

1:40:44.600 --> 1:40:47.120
 They also offer a number of different ideas

1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:50.640
 about how this could shift the activation

1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:51.840
 of the so-called sympathetic,

1:40:51.840 --> 1:40:55.520
 remember the kind of stress division of our nervous system,

1:40:55.520 --> 1:40:59.620
 and to reduce that relative to activation

1:40:59.620 --> 1:41:01.940
 of the parasympathetic arm of the nervous system.

1:41:01.940 --> 1:41:03.640
 I confess they have a couple of arguments

1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:05.300
 around sympathetic, parasympathetic

1:41:05.300 --> 1:41:06.900
 that are somewhat convoluted.

1:41:06.900 --> 1:41:10.900
 I will just, in fairness to the neuroscience

1:41:10.900 --> 1:41:15.260
 on those systems, I wouldn't suggest putting too much weight

1:41:15.260 --> 1:41:17.980
 on their arguments about sympathetic and parasympathetic.

1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:20.320
 To my mind, they didn't really hold much water,

1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:22.340
 but here I'm not trying to be disparaging

1:41:22.340 --> 1:41:24.960
 of the overall work, which I think is really quite sound,

1:41:24.960 --> 1:41:28.480
 which is that low intensity so-called microstretching

1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:30.360
 is going to be the most effective way

1:41:30.360 --> 1:41:33.200
 to increase limb range of movement over time.

1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:35.220
 I want to just briefly return to this idea

1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:37.900
 of whether or not to do ballistic or static stretching

1:41:37.900 --> 1:41:41.920
 before some sort of skill training or weight training

1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:45.600
 or any kind of sport or even cardiovascular exercise

1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:47.200
 like running.

1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:49.240
 Again, the data are really split out there.

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:50.940
 There are even folks who suggest

1:41:50.940 --> 1:41:53.460
 that doing any kind of stretching prior to running

1:41:53.460 --> 1:41:55.240
 is going to lower running efficiency.

1:41:55.240 --> 1:41:57.120
 It's going to require essentially more work

1:41:57.120 --> 1:41:59.180
 and more oxygen uptake at a given speed

1:42:00.060 --> 1:42:01.200
 for a variety of reasons.

1:42:01.200 --> 1:42:04.660
 And runners and that community argue about this endlessly.

1:42:04.660 --> 1:42:06.760
 There are papers in both sides, in both directions.

1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:09.040
 I'm sure I'll hear about some of this in the comments.

1:42:09.040 --> 1:42:12.120
 I'm not really going to take a stance on this as a consequence

1:42:12.120 --> 1:42:14.560
 because the data are all over the place.

1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:16.900
 However, I think there's a general logic

1:42:16.900 --> 1:42:17.960
 that we can apply in here.

1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:20.400
 I'm borrowing from some conversations

1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:23.200
 and some information put out there by Dr. Andy Galpin,

1:42:23.200 --> 1:42:25.920
 who I think is, of course, both an expert

1:42:25.920 --> 1:42:27.680
 and thinks about these things in a really sound

1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:30.480
 and flexible way, no pun intended.

1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:34.920
 There are instances, for example,

1:42:34.920 --> 1:42:37.720
 where an individual might want to do some static stretching

1:42:37.720 --> 1:42:39.520
 to increase limb range of motion

1:42:39.520 --> 1:42:41.120
 prior to doing weight training,

1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:44.660
 even if it's going to inhibit that person's ability

1:42:44.660 --> 1:42:46.320
 to lift as much weight.

1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:47.340
 Why would you want to do that?

1:42:47.340 --> 1:42:50.160
 Well, for instance, if somebody has a tightness

1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:52.840
 or a limitation in their neuromuscular connective

1:42:52.840 --> 1:42:56.600
 tissue system someplace in their body and system

1:42:56.600 --> 1:43:00.000
 that prevents them from using proper form

1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:03.720
 that they can overcome by doing some static stretching,

1:43:03.720 --> 1:43:07.600
 well, that would be a great idea, as Dr. Galpin points out.

1:43:07.600 --> 1:43:11.480
 Or, for instance, if proper stability within the movement

1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:14.520
 requires increasing limb range of motion in some way,

1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:18.720
 well, then compromising the use of greater loads

1:43:18.720 --> 1:43:22.000
 could be greatly offset by doing some static stretching

1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:23.840
 to improve, say, hamstring flexibility

1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:25.560
 or another muscle group flexibility.

1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:28.320
 So we can't always think about just what's going to allow us

1:43:28.320 --> 1:43:30.960
 or inhibit us from using the maximal amount of weight

1:43:30.960 --> 1:43:33.680
 or from running as far as we want to run

1:43:33.680 --> 1:43:35.240
 as fast as we want to run.

1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:36.880
 There are instances where people are trying

1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:39.920
 to overcome injuries, where they're trying to come back

1:43:39.920 --> 1:43:42.840
 from a reparative surgery or something of that sort,

1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:44.040
 coming back from a layoff,

1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:47.080
 where some additional static stretching

1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:49.920
 prior to cardiovascular weight training or skill training

1:43:49.920 --> 1:43:52.640
 or sport of some kind is going to be useful

1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:54.600
 because it's going to put us in a position

1:43:54.600 --> 1:43:58.180
 of greater safety and confidence and performance overall,

1:43:58.180 --> 1:44:00.680
 even if it's adjusting down our speed

1:44:00.680 --> 1:44:02.880
 or the total amount of loads that we use.

1:44:02.880 --> 1:44:05.600
 So it's you that needs to consider

1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:09.420
 whether or not for you and within a given training session,

1:44:09.420 --> 1:44:12.160
 you want to do static training,

1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:15.000
 I should say static stretching range of motion training

1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:18.560
 prior to or after that training session.

1:44:18.560 --> 1:44:22.840
 And similarly, there are a lot of data points in the fact

1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:25.880
 that doing some dynamic or even ballistic stretching

1:44:25.880 --> 1:44:28.600
 prior to skill training or cardiovascular weight training

1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:31.200
 can be beneficial in part to warm up

1:44:31.200 --> 1:44:32.360
 the relevant neural circuits,

1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:35.000
 joints and connective tissue and muscles,

1:44:35.000 --> 1:44:38.760
 and as well to perhaps improve range of motion

1:44:38.760 --> 1:44:42.120
 or ability to perform those movements more accurately

1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:45.160
 with more stability and therefore with more confidence.

1:44:45.160 --> 1:44:46.840
 And while Dr. Andy Galpin

1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:49.200
 would never name any protocol after himself,

1:44:49.200 --> 1:44:50.720
 he's far too humble to do that,

1:44:50.720 --> 1:44:52.780
 I've named a couple of protocols after him,

1:44:52.780 --> 1:44:55.640
 particularly the Galpin equation for hydration,

1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:58.000
 because he was willing to stick his neck out there

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:02.280
 and put down some specific numbers that people could follow

1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:04.920
 in order to ensure proper hydration during training,

1:45:04.920 --> 1:45:07.320
 you can look up the Galpin equation elsewhere,

1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:10.680
 you can just Google it or look elsewhere, you'll find it.

1:45:10.680 --> 1:45:15.280
 And Dr. Galpin has also been very thoughtful and generous,

1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:17.780
 and I think very accurate in offering

1:45:17.780 --> 1:45:20.600
 a kind of a general organizational logic

1:45:20.600 --> 1:45:22.880
 for how to think about the goals

1:45:22.880 --> 1:45:25.280
 of a particular training session

1:45:25.280 --> 1:45:27.780
 and thereby to decide whether or not

1:45:27.780 --> 1:45:29.680
 you're going to do ballistic or static stretching

1:45:29.680 --> 1:45:31.040
 and so on and so forth.

1:45:31.040 --> 1:45:33.720
 So we can refer to this general approach

1:45:33.720 --> 1:45:37.480
 as Galpinian, Galpinian, is that right?

1:45:37.480 --> 1:45:41.560
 Galpinian logic, Galpinian logic.

1:45:41.560 --> 1:45:43.220
 Thus far we've been talking about stretching

1:45:43.220 --> 1:45:46.500
 for sake of increasing limb flexibility and range of motion,

1:45:46.500 --> 1:45:49.520
 but there are other reasons perhaps

1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:52.120
 to embark on a stretching protocol

1:45:52.120 --> 1:45:55.760
 that include both our ability to relax

1:45:55.760 --> 1:45:58.120
 and access deep relaxation quickly,

1:45:58.120 --> 1:46:01.680
 as well as even to reduce inflammation

1:46:01.680 --> 1:46:04.600
 and perhaps even combat certain forms of cancer.

1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:07.360
 And if that sounds really far-fetched,

1:46:07.360 --> 1:46:08.740
 I want to emphasize that the study

1:46:08.740 --> 1:46:10.440
 I'm about to share with you in a moment

1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:13.200
 was actually carried out by one of the directors

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:17.400
 of a division of the National Institutes of Health.

1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:21.100
 And this was the work of Helene Langevin,

1:46:21.100 --> 1:46:25.280
 who's a medical doctor, has done really important work

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:29.960
 on the mechanisms underlying things like acupuncture

1:46:29.960 --> 1:46:34.240
 and has approached all that from a very mechanistic viewpoint

1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:36.400
 so not looking just at the effects of acupuncture,

1:46:36.400 --> 1:46:39.400
 but really trying to understand what sorts of cytokines,

1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:43.000
 inflammatory molecules and pathways are activated,

1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:46.000
 what sorts of neural mechanisms get engaged

1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:49.300
 by things like acupuncture that impinges

1:46:49.300 --> 1:46:52.160
 on the fascial tissues and so forth.

1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:54.320
 And Dr. Langevin is currently a director

1:46:54.320 --> 1:46:57.160
 of the National Institutes of Complementary Health

1:46:57.160 --> 1:47:00.660
 and Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.

1:47:00.660 --> 1:47:03.700
 So this is a major division supported by tax dollars

1:47:03.700 --> 1:47:07.140
 that support systematic mechanistic exploration

1:47:07.140 --> 1:47:11.400
 of things like respiration, meditation, yoga, acupuncture.

1:47:11.400 --> 1:47:14.260
 So this is serious science applied to protocols

1:47:14.260 --> 1:47:16.080
 and approaches that have been used for some period of time,

1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:17.740
 but really aimed at trying to understand

1:47:17.740 --> 1:47:21.660
 what would the best protocols be to evolve new protocols.

1:47:21.660 --> 1:47:25.280
 So there's a really interesting study done in animal models,

1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:27.460
 but I think it's a powerful enough result

1:47:27.460 --> 1:47:29.620
 that I think we all should pay attention to it.

1:47:29.620 --> 1:47:31.020
 The title of this paper, and again,

1:47:31.020 --> 1:47:33.720
 the last author is Dr. Langevin herself,

1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:36.420
 is stretching reduces tumor growth

1:47:36.420 --> 1:47:38.600
 in a mouse breast cancer model.

1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:40.580
 And yes, you can get mice to stretch.

1:47:40.580 --> 1:47:44.020
 It turns out that if you gently lift up mice by their tail

1:47:44.020 --> 1:47:45.020
 and they'll hold onto their cage,

1:47:45.020 --> 1:47:47.420
 there's a way in which you can mechanically stretch them

1:47:47.420 --> 1:47:48.860
 in a way that doesn't harm them.

1:47:48.860 --> 1:47:51.240
 First, I should mention that Dr. Langevin and others

1:47:51.240 --> 1:47:54.060
 have shown that just a brief whole body stretch

1:47:54.060 --> 1:47:58.100
 of that sort induces an increase in activation

1:47:58.100 --> 1:48:01.900
 of the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.

1:48:01.900 --> 1:48:03.460
 Again, not arm limb arm,

1:48:03.460 --> 1:48:05.840
 but the aspect of the autonomic nervous system

1:48:05.840 --> 1:48:09.980
 that creates a whole body, whole nervous system shift

1:48:09.980 --> 1:48:11.820
 toward more relaxation.

1:48:11.820 --> 1:48:16.140
 So yes, indeed, stretching induces relaxation

1:48:16.140 --> 1:48:19.380
 at a systemic level, not just at a local level.

1:48:19.380 --> 1:48:21.100
 And I think that's important,

1:48:21.100 --> 1:48:22.620
 probably not surprising to those of you

1:48:22.620 --> 1:48:24.260
 that use stretching regularly,

1:48:24.260 --> 1:48:26.340
 but yes, it does indeed relax us.

1:48:26.340 --> 1:48:29.580
 Yes, you can do this in mice and see that in mice as well.

1:48:29.580 --> 1:48:31.940
 Here's what they did for this current study,

1:48:31.940 --> 1:48:35.660
 or I should say this was a study published in 2018

1:48:35.660 --> 1:48:37.020
 in Scientific Reports.

1:48:38.760 --> 1:48:40.860
 They write, recent studies have shown

1:48:40.860 --> 1:48:42.580
 that gentle daily stretching for 10 minutes

1:48:42.580 --> 1:48:45.380
 can reduce local connective tissue inflammation and fibrosis.

1:48:45.380 --> 1:48:49.700
 Now that's local tissue inflammation and fibrosis.

1:48:49.700 --> 1:48:53.760
 As well, we now know as systemic inflammation

1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:56.780
 and can induce relaxation systemically.

1:48:57.740 --> 1:49:00.840
 In this case, they focused on mice, not humans.

1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:02.140
 And mice were randomized

1:49:02.140 --> 1:49:04.220
 to a stretch versus no stretch condition

1:49:04.220 --> 1:49:07.020
 and were treated for 10 minutes,

1:49:07.020 --> 1:49:08.420
 once a day for four weeks.

1:49:08.420 --> 1:49:11.700
 So it's 10 minutes of this passive whole body stretching

1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:14.700
 a day for four weeks.

1:49:14.700 --> 1:49:17.120
 What's remarkable, I mean, just I have to say

1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:20.440
 is just striking is that tumor volume in these mice,

1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:22.100
 they were able to induce tumors in these mice

1:49:22.100 --> 1:49:24.100
 and the tumor volume at the end point

1:49:24.100 --> 1:49:27.480
 was 52% smaller in the stretch group

1:49:27.480 --> 1:49:29.280
 compared to the no stretch group.

1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:31.560
 This is a highly significant effect.

1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:34.940
 And they point out in the absence of any other treatment.

1:49:34.940 --> 1:49:36.140
 And they explored whether or not

1:49:36.140 --> 1:49:38.500
 cytotoxic immune responses were activated

1:49:38.500 --> 1:49:40.500
 and a number of other features.

1:49:40.500 --> 1:49:41.740
 They weren't able to get too deeply

1:49:41.740 --> 1:49:43.900
 into the underlying mechanisms,

1:49:43.900 --> 1:49:45.540
 but this is pretty remarkable.

1:49:45.540 --> 1:49:47.980
 Even three weeks into this stretching protocol,

1:49:47.980 --> 1:49:49.800
 this daily stretching protocol for these mice,

1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:51.020
 tumor volume was reduced.

1:49:51.020 --> 1:49:54.040
 I mean, by, you know, it's almost halved.

1:49:54.040 --> 1:49:55.620
 This is pretty incredible.

1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:57.740
 So they have these measures of tumor volume

1:49:58.740 --> 1:50:01.340
 and the only difference in the way these animals

1:50:01.340 --> 1:50:02.960
 were treated and handled

1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:06.220
 was the introduction of this daily stretch.

1:50:06.220 --> 1:50:10.260
 I find this result to be, of course, limited

1:50:10.260 --> 1:50:12.140
 to the extent that it's done in an animal model,

1:50:12.140 --> 1:50:14.100
 not in humans, we have to point that out.

1:50:14.100 --> 1:50:16.200
 But as they point out in their discussion,

1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:18.300
 our results demonstrate a 52% reduction

1:50:18.300 --> 1:50:20.380
 in mammary tumor growth over one month

1:50:20.380 --> 1:50:22.560
 in mice undergoing stretching for 10 minutes a day

1:50:22.560 --> 1:50:24.660
 without any other form of therapy.

1:50:24.660 --> 1:50:26.980
 Do they think that stretching itself

1:50:26.980 --> 1:50:28.500
 is changing the tumor size?

1:50:28.500 --> 1:50:29.340
 No.

1:50:29.340 --> 1:50:31.820
 In fact, they raised the possibility that stretching,

1:50:31.820 --> 1:50:33.700
 because of its impact on the fascia,

1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:35.380
 might even create micro environments

1:50:35.380 --> 1:50:37.720
 that are more permissive for tumor growth

1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:38.820
 in certain instances.

1:50:38.820 --> 1:50:41.240
 So they're careful to emphasize

1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:42.880
 what I also believe to be the case,

1:50:42.880 --> 1:50:45.020
 which is that it's unlikely that the stretching itself

1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:47.560
 was directly acting to reduce tumor size,

1:50:47.560 --> 1:50:50.320
 but rather that there's this possible link

1:50:50.320 --> 1:50:53.580
 between inflammation and immune exhaustion mechanisms

1:50:53.580 --> 1:50:58.020
 that if you can periodically relax a nervous system,

1:50:58.020 --> 1:50:59.260
 here through stretching,

1:50:59.260 --> 1:51:02.280
 that it can affect certain pathways

1:51:02.280 --> 1:51:03.400
 related to the immune system

1:51:03.400 --> 1:51:05.140
 that would allow the immune system

1:51:05.140 --> 1:51:07.820
 to combat tumor growth to a significant degree.

1:51:07.820 --> 1:51:10.060
 So again, even though this is a study in mice,

1:51:10.060 --> 1:51:12.860
 it argues that relaxation induced by stretching

1:51:12.860 --> 1:51:15.520
 can have a powerful influence on mammary tumor growth.

1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:18.100
 Again, a huge effect carried out

1:51:18.100 --> 1:51:21.900
 by one of the premier labs and individuals

1:51:22.780 --> 1:51:25.060
 who do this sort of work and think about this sort of thing.

1:51:25.060 --> 1:51:26.040
 And of course, I want to point out,

1:51:26.040 --> 1:51:28.120
 it wasn't just Dr. Langevin that did this study.

1:51:28.120 --> 1:51:29.640
 There are a number of co-authors on the study.

1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:32.140
 We'll provide a link to the co-authors,

1:51:32.140 --> 1:51:34.300
 excuse me, we will provide a link to the study

1:51:34.300 --> 1:51:37.100
 so that you can peruse it in more detail if you like.

1:51:37.100 --> 1:51:40.460
 Now, as a related and somewhat final point,

1:51:40.460 --> 1:51:43.500
 I'd like to return to this idea and this place,

1:51:43.500 --> 1:51:45.480
 this real estate within our brain

1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:48.140
 that we call the insular cortex, the insula.

1:51:48.140 --> 1:51:51.140
 As you recall, way back at the beginning of this episode,

1:51:51.140 --> 1:51:53.020
 we were talking about the von Economo neurons,

1:51:53.020 --> 1:51:54.700
 that Constantine von Economo,

1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:58.100
 the Austrian scientist discovered.

1:51:58.100 --> 1:52:01.260
 And the fact that we are able to make

1:52:01.260 --> 1:52:05.540
 and perform interpretations of our internal landscape, pain,

1:52:05.540 --> 1:52:08.780
 our dedication to a practice, for instance,

1:52:08.780 --> 1:52:12.680
 whether or not we are in pain because it's a practice

1:52:12.680 --> 1:52:14.100
 that we are doing intentionally

1:52:14.100 --> 1:52:15.540
 and want to improve ourselves,

1:52:15.540 --> 1:52:17.380
 or whether or not it's pain that's arriving

1:52:17.380 --> 1:52:20.880
 through some externally imposed demands or situations.

1:52:20.880 --> 1:52:23.400
 Well, the insula is handling all that.

1:52:23.400 --> 1:52:26.120
 And fortunately, there's a wonderful paper

1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:28.840
 that was published, it was a few years ago now

1:52:28.840 --> 1:52:31.380
 in the journal Cerebral Cortex, which is a fine journal.

1:52:31.380 --> 1:52:34.740
 This is the year 2014, entitled Insular Cortex Mediates

1:52:34.740 --> 1:52:37.380
 Increased Pain Tolerance in Yoga Practitioners.

1:52:37.380 --> 1:52:39.200
 I'll tell you why I like this study.

1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:41.100
 I'm personally not a practitioner of yoga.

1:52:41.100 --> 1:52:42.940
 I've taken a few yoga classes over the years.

1:52:42.940 --> 1:52:44.900
 I've done some of the hot yoga classes.

1:52:45.860 --> 1:52:49.440
 Those rooms can get really, really warm, I confess.

1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:51.820
 And I've done the kind of standard yoga every now and again.

1:52:51.820 --> 1:52:54.180
 It's not something that I've kept up regularly.

1:52:55.180 --> 1:53:00.180
 This study explored the effects on brain structure volume

1:53:01.540 --> 1:53:03.700
 in yoga practitioners.

1:53:03.700 --> 1:53:05.340
 And for those of you out there

1:53:05.340 --> 1:53:06.680
 that are aficionados in yoga,

1:53:06.680 --> 1:53:11.420
 they pulled subjects from having backgrounds in the,

1:53:11.420 --> 1:53:12.700
 here I'm probably going to mispronounce

1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:14.440
 these different things and forgive me,

1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:17.020
 the vinyasa yogas, the ashtanga yogas,

1:53:17.020 --> 1:53:19.300
 the yangar yogas, the sunanda yogas.

1:53:19.300 --> 1:53:21.580
 Okay, so some people were new to these practices.

1:53:21.580 --> 1:53:24.060
 Some were experienced.

1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:26.240
 The important takeaways were that

1:53:26.240 --> 1:53:28.180
 they took these yoga practitioners

1:53:28.180 --> 1:53:30.260
 and they didn't explore their brain structure

1:53:30.260 --> 1:53:31.560
 in the context of yoga itself.

1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:34.460
 They looked at things like pain tolerance.

1:53:34.460 --> 1:53:36.460
 So they used thermal stimulation,

1:53:36.460 --> 1:53:37.940
 basically they put people into conditions

1:53:37.940 --> 1:53:40.340
 where they gave them very hot or very cold stimuli

1:53:40.340 --> 1:53:43.120
 and compared those yoga practitioners

1:53:43.120 --> 1:53:44.940
 of varying levels of yoga experience

1:53:44.940 --> 1:53:47.260
 to those that had no experience with yoga,

1:53:47.260 --> 1:53:48.380
 so-called controls.

1:53:48.380 --> 1:53:51.060
 And they found some really interesting things.

1:53:51.060 --> 1:53:52.760
 I got a lot of data on this paper,

1:53:52.760 --> 1:53:55.760
 but here's something I'd like to highlight.

1:53:55.760 --> 1:53:59.220
 The pain tolerance of yoga practitioners

1:53:59.220 --> 1:54:04.220
 was double or more to that of non-yoga practitioners,

1:54:04.220 --> 1:54:07.220
 even for those that weren't doing the so-called hot yoga.

1:54:07.220 --> 1:54:10.540
 They also found that pain tolerance was significantly greater

1:54:10.540 --> 1:54:13.300
 both for heat pain and for cold pain.

1:54:13.300 --> 1:54:17.800
 They also found significant increases in insular,

1:54:18.780 --> 1:54:21.860
 again, the insula, this brain region, gray matter volume.

1:54:21.860 --> 1:54:23.400
 Typically, when we talk about gray matter,

1:54:23.400 --> 1:54:25.360
 we're talking about the so-called cell bodies,

1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:29.940
 the location in neurons where the genome is housed

1:54:29.940 --> 1:54:33.060
 and where all the housekeeping stuff is there.

1:54:33.060 --> 1:54:36.020
 And then white matter volume tends to be the axons,

1:54:36.020 --> 1:54:37.440
 the wires, because they're in sheaths

1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:40.220
 with this stuff that appears white in MRIs

1:54:40.220 --> 1:54:42.000
 and indeed is white under the microscope

1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:42.840
 and indeed is white.

1:54:42.840 --> 1:54:44.700
 It's actually lipid, which is myelin.

1:54:44.700 --> 1:54:48.260
 So increased gray matter volume of the insula

1:54:48.260 --> 1:54:51.700
 is a significant finding because what it suggests

1:54:51.700 --> 1:54:53.580
 is that people that are doing yoga

1:54:53.580 --> 1:54:56.460
 have an increased volume of these areas of the brain

1:54:56.460 --> 1:54:59.100
 that are associated with interoceptive awareness

1:54:59.100 --> 1:55:02.060
 and for being able to make judgments about pain

1:55:02.060 --> 1:55:03.920
 and why one is experiencing pain,

1:55:03.920 --> 1:55:05.260
 not just to lean away from pain,

1:55:05.260 --> 1:55:08.660
 but to utilize or leverage or even overcome pain.

1:55:08.660 --> 1:55:12.940
 So there are many studies of yoga and meditation out there,

1:55:12.940 --> 1:55:15.940
 few that have as much mechanistic detail as this one.

1:55:15.940 --> 1:55:18.380
 And in fact, there's a beautiful figure,

1:55:18.380 --> 1:55:19.860
 figure three in this paper,

1:55:19.860 --> 1:55:21.700
 that shows that the gray matter volume

1:55:21.700 --> 1:55:24.460
 of this particular brain region scales

1:55:24.460 --> 1:55:28.300
 in an almost linear way with the duration of yoga practice

1:55:28.300 --> 1:55:29.980
 that somebody has been taking on in years.

1:55:29.980 --> 1:55:32.320
 So people that had, they had a few subjects

1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:35.340
 that have up to 15 or 16 years of yoga practice

1:55:35.340 --> 1:55:39.240
 had much larger left insular gray matter volume,

1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.660
 bigger brain areas associated with these abilities.

1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:44.180
 And I find this interesting

1:55:44.180 --> 1:55:46.860
 because there are a lot of activities out there

1:55:46.860 --> 1:55:50.540
 that don't create these kinds of changes in brain volume,

1:55:50.540 --> 1:55:52.060
 especially within the insula.

1:55:52.060 --> 1:55:54.380
 So it appears that it's not just the performance

1:55:54.380 --> 1:55:57.000
 of the yogic movements, but the overcoming

1:55:57.000 --> 1:55:59.860
 or the kind of pushing into the end ranges of motion

1:55:59.860 --> 1:56:03.460
 and to push through discomfort to some extent,

1:56:03.460 --> 1:56:06.700
 of course, we want people doing that in a healthy safe way,

1:56:06.700 --> 1:56:08.660
 but that's allows yoga practitioners

1:56:08.660 --> 1:56:13.180
 to build up the structure and function of these brain areas

1:56:13.180 --> 1:56:15.340
 that allow them to cope with pain better

1:56:15.340 --> 1:56:17.980
 than other individuals and to cope with other kinds

1:56:17.980 --> 1:56:21.280
 of interoceptive challenges, if you will,

1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:24.620
 not just pain, but cold, not just pain,

1:56:24.620 --> 1:56:27.220
 but discomfort of being in a particular position

1:56:27.220 --> 1:56:28.060
 to do that.

1:56:28.060 --> 1:56:30.260
 And again, we wouldn't want people placing themselves

1:56:30.260 --> 1:56:33.900
 into a compromised position literally that would harm them,

1:56:33.900 --> 1:56:37.540
 especially given that earlier we heard that micro stretching

1:56:37.540 --> 1:56:39.820
 of the kind of non-painful sort, low intensity sort

1:56:39.820 --> 1:56:41.220
 is actually going to be more effective

1:56:41.220 --> 1:56:42.960
 for increasing end range of motion.

1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:45.020
 But this study really emphasizes the extent

1:56:45.020 --> 1:56:49.980
 to which practitioners of yoga don't just learn movements,

1:56:49.980 --> 1:56:52.980
 they learn how to control their nervous system in ways

1:56:52.980 --> 1:56:56.960
 that really reshapes their relationship to pain,

1:56:56.960 --> 1:56:59.900
 to flexibility and to the kinds of things

1:56:59.900 --> 1:57:03.180
 that the neuromuscular system was designed to do.

1:57:03.180 --> 1:57:04.940
 And as a final point,

1:57:04.940 --> 1:57:07.700
 there's a beautiful graph in this paper, beautiful,

1:57:07.700 --> 1:57:09.100
 I think, because it explores some

1:57:09.100 --> 1:57:13.120
 of the more subjective dimensions of yoga

1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:15.980
 and insular function, which is a,

1:57:15.980 --> 1:57:18.560
 here I'll read it out in the nerdy form,

1:57:18.560 --> 1:57:19.940
 and then I'll explain what it means.

1:57:19.940 --> 1:57:22.340
 This is a frequency histogram of categories

1:57:22.340 --> 1:57:25.700
 of mental strategies used by yogis versus controls

1:57:25.700 --> 1:57:27.740
 during the cold pain tolerance task.

1:57:27.740 --> 1:57:32.740
 What they're describing here and showing is quantitatively

1:57:32.780 --> 1:57:36.220
 how people are conceptualizing cold pain

1:57:36.220 --> 1:57:37.860
 in order to get through it.

1:57:37.860 --> 1:57:39.500
 And the different categories are,

1:57:39.500 --> 1:57:41.640
 for instance, distraction, right?

1:57:41.640 --> 1:57:44.500
 Some people just choose to distract themselves from pain

1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:46.900
 or to attempt to, other people will try to ignore it.

1:57:46.900 --> 1:57:50.940
 It's a lot like distraction, but nonetheless,

1:57:50.940 --> 1:57:53.100
 to engage in a negative emotion,

1:57:53.100 --> 1:57:55.980
 sort of like, I'm going to dig, I'm going to be in resistance

1:57:55.980 --> 1:57:56.820
 to this.

1:57:57.900 --> 1:58:00.740
 Control subjects tended to use those approaches,

1:58:00.740 --> 1:58:04.540
 whereas practitioners of yoga tended to use other sorts

1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:07.540
 of subjective approaches like positive imagery

1:58:07.540 --> 1:58:10.560
 to some extent, the ability to relax

1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:13.500
 despite the extreme cold,

1:58:13.500 --> 1:58:15.940
 the ability to quote unquote accept,

1:58:15.940 --> 1:58:18.780
 like this is just happening despite the extreme cold,

1:58:18.780 --> 1:58:21.220
 to observe, to third person themselves,

1:58:21.220 --> 1:58:24.940
 and the greatest effect of course was to breathe,

1:58:24.940 --> 1:58:27.960
 to focus on their respiration as a way to deal

1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:31.380
 with this challenge, this cold challenge.

1:58:31.380 --> 1:58:34.260
 Now, all of that is our subjective data,

1:58:34.260 --> 1:58:38.460
 but I want to remind you that the practitioners of yoga

1:58:38.460 --> 1:58:41.320
 are not just using entirely different mental strategies,

1:58:41.320 --> 1:58:44.940
 but they are far more effective at dealing with pain.

1:58:44.940 --> 1:58:48.480
 Their pain tolerance is much higher as evidenced

1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:51.340
 by the other data in the previous graphs in the paper.

1:58:51.340 --> 1:58:54.660
 So while this podcast episode is most certainly not

1:58:54.660 --> 1:58:58.580
 about yoga per se, it's about flexibility and stretching.

1:58:58.580 --> 1:59:00.240
 Flexibility and stretching are elements

1:59:00.240 --> 1:59:02.360
 within yogic practices.

1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:04.700
 And of course, yoga practices involve breathing

1:59:04.700 --> 1:59:07.460
 and mental work and a lot of other things,

1:59:07.460 --> 1:59:08.420
 balance, et cetera.

1:59:08.420 --> 1:59:11.220
 It's a vast landscape as many of you know.

1:59:11.220 --> 1:59:14.400
 But I think that if ever there was a manuscript

1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:17.780
 that pointed to the utility of something like yoga

1:59:17.780 --> 1:59:21.940
 for sake of tapping into a particular set of brain circuits

1:59:21.940 --> 1:59:24.200
 and mechanisms that could wick out

1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:26.460
 into multiple dimensions of life,

1:59:26.460 --> 1:59:30.440
 so day-to-day life, stress, challenges in dealing

1:59:30.440 --> 1:59:33.420
 with all sorts of external stressors, career related,

1:59:33.420 --> 1:59:38.400
 family related, relationally, et cetera, excuse me,

1:59:38.400 --> 1:59:41.820
 but as well for increasing range of motion,

1:59:41.820 --> 1:59:43.320
 for increasing flexibility.

1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:46.740
 So if ever there was a practice that one could embark on

1:59:46.740 --> 1:59:48.920
 that would not only increase flexibility

1:59:48.920 --> 1:59:49.940
 and limb range of motion,

1:59:49.940 --> 1:59:52.280
 but would also allow one to cultivate

1:59:52.280 --> 1:59:54.300
 some improved mental functioning

1:59:54.300 --> 1:59:55.780
 as it relates to pain tolerance

1:59:55.780 --> 1:59:58.160
 and other features of stress management

1:59:58.160 --> 2:00:01.140
 that no doubt wick out into other areas of life,

2:00:01.140 --> 2:00:04.340
 appears that yoga is a quite useful practice.

2:00:04.340 --> 2:00:06.060
 And so for those of you that are interested

2:00:06.060 --> 2:00:07.580
 in increasing limb range of motion

2:00:07.580 --> 2:00:10.060
 and you're already a practitioner of yoga, great.

2:00:10.060 --> 2:00:12.460
 I can imagine that someday there'll be another study

2:00:12.460 --> 2:00:15.880
 like this one and you'll be in that 10 or 15

2:00:15.880 --> 2:00:18.520
 to 16 year practitioner graph.

2:00:18.520 --> 2:00:21.780
 You'll be that dot way out on the far end of the graph

2:00:21.780 --> 2:00:23.720
 that shows that your insula is that much bigger

2:00:23.720 --> 2:00:25.020
 than the rest of ours.

2:00:25.020 --> 2:00:27.980
 And therefore your internal awareness and pain thresholds

2:00:27.980 --> 2:00:30.140
 and stress management will be that much better.

2:00:30.140 --> 2:00:32.880
 But of course, yoga isn't the only way

2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:35.720
 to increase limb range of motion and flexibility.

2:00:36.900 --> 2:00:39.140
 Up until now, we've described a number of different ways

2:00:39.140 --> 2:00:41.540
 to do that and we've arrived at some general themes

2:00:41.540 --> 2:00:42.360
 and protocols.

2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:44.980
 Again, those themes and protocols will be distilled

2:00:44.980 --> 2:00:47.900
 into some specific and precise lists

2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:49.380
 in our neural network newsletter,

2:00:49.380 --> 2:00:51.340
 but we can revisit a couple of them now

2:00:51.340 --> 2:00:54.200
 just in summary and synthesis.

2:00:54.200 --> 2:00:56.700
 Static stretching appears to be at least among

2:00:56.700 --> 2:00:58.400
 the more useful forms of stretching.

2:00:58.400 --> 2:01:01.200
 So low or zero momentum stretching,

2:01:01.200 --> 2:01:03.800
 typically at end range of motion.

2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:07.060
 I love this concept of micro stretching,

2:01:07.060 --> 2:01:08.840
 even though it's just a couple of studies

2:01:08.840 --> 2:01:11.120
 that have addressed whether or not high intensity

2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:14.260
 or low intensity static stretch holds are more beneficial.

2:01:14.260 --> 2:01:18.160
 The idea and indeed the data that low intensity,

2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:23.160
 so 30 to 40% of what one would consider painful

2:01:23.380 --> 2:01:27.360
 appears to be more effective than 80% of that threshold.

2:01:27.360 --> 2:01:28.720
 Find that incredibly interesting.

2:01:28.720 --> 2:01:30.960
 And then there's this idea of frequency.

2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:35.120
 It really does appear that getting at least five minutes

2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:37.880
 per week total of stretching for a given muscle group

2:01:37.880 --> 2:01:41.160
 is important for creating meaningful lasting changes

2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:42.720
 in limb range of motion.

2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:46.560
 And that is best achieved by five day a week

2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:49.280
 or six day a week, or even seven day a week protocols.

2:01:49.280 --> 2:01:51.360
 But those can be very short protocols,

2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:54.240
 limited to say three sets of 30,

2:01:54.240 --> 2:01:57.500
 maybe in 45 or 60 seconds of static hold.

2:01:57.500 --> 2:02:01.520
 Although 30 seconds seems to be a key threshold there

2:02:01.520 --> 2:02:03.720
 that can get you maximum benefit.

2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:05.720
 There is no need to do full 60 second holds

2:02:05.720 --> 2:02:08.400
 unless you're doing fewer total sessions per week.

2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:10.540
 And of course, to always warm up

2:02:10.540 --> 2:02:12.960
 or to arrive at the stretching session warm.

2:02:12.960 --> 2:02:15.240
 And then of course, there are the other forms of stretching

2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:18.260
 that we touched upon a bit, things like PNF.

2:02:18.260 --> 2:02:20.280
 And we talked about why PNF works,

2:02:20.280 --> 2:02:23.620
 things like the spindle and the Golgi tendon organ reflexes

2:02:23.620 --> 2:02:24.960
 that are built into all of us

2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:26.720
 that we arrive in this world with.

2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:28.360
 And of course, the other forms of stretching

2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:30.920
 that are known to be effective and important,

2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:34.140
 such as dynamic and ballistic stretching.

2:02:34.140 --> 2:02:37.880
 Again, stretching protocols that involve a lot of momentum

2:02:37.880 --> 2:02:39.940
 in order to improve range of motion

2:02:39.940 --> 2:02:42.840
 for performance of particular types of work

2:02:42.840 --> 2:02:44.720
 that one is about to embark on.

2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:46.560
 Typically that would be physical work,

2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:50.500
 but a whole interesting and unexplored landscape

2:02:50.500 --> 2:02:53.740
 is the extent to which changing limb range of motion

2:02:53.740 --> 2:02:55.160
 and different types of body movement

2:02:55.160 --> 2:02:57.600
 actually shape our cognitive abilities.

2:02:57.600 --> 2:02:59.900
 And that will be the topic of a future episode

2:02:59.900 --> 2:03:01.000
 of this podcast.

2:03:01.000 --> 2:03:03.400

2:03:37.640 --> 2:03:39.100
 at the beginning of today's episode.

 That's the best way to support this podcast.

2:03:41.840 --> 2:03:43.300
 Not so much on today's episode,

2:03:43.300 --> 2:03:45.920
 but in many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:03:45.920 --> 2:03:47.260
 we talk about supplements.

2:03:47.260 --> 2:03:49.500
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:03:49.500 --> 2:03:51.720
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:03:51.720 --> 2:03:54.240
 for things like improving the transition time

2:03:54.240 --> 2:03:57.600
 and depth of sleep, or for improving focus,

2:03:57.600 --> 2:03:58.880
 or for a variety of other things,

2:03:58.880 --> 2:04:00.840
 including things like anxiety management.

2:04:00.840 --> 2:04:02.480
 For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:04:02.480 --> 2:04:05.520
 has decided to partner with Momentus supplements.

2:04:05.520 --> 2:04:06.720
 First of all, Momentus supplements

2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:08.680
 are of the very highest quality.

2:04:08.680 --> 2:04:10.960
 They're used by various professional sports teams

2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:12.300
 and they have contracts

2:04:12.300 --> 2:04:13.880
 with various government organizations

2:04:13.880 --> 2:04:15.680
 exploring the role of particular supplements

2:04:15.680 --> 2:04:17.400
 in human performance.

2:04:17.400 --> 2:04:19.400
 Second of all, they ship internationally

2:04:19.400 --> 2:04:21.760
 because we know a number of you are outside the country

2:04:21.760 --> 2:04:23.240
 of the United States.

2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:25.240
 We hope that will be useful to you.

2:04:25.240 --> 2:04:28.100
 As well, we wanted to have a single location

2:04:28.100 --> 2:04:30.440
 where people could go to access

2:04:30.440 --> 2:04:33.080
 the most often discussed supplements

2:04:33.080 --> 2:04:34.920
 here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:04:34.920 --> 2:04:37.020
 So while the full catalog of those supplements

2:04:37.020 --> 2:04:40.680
 isn't quite available yet, many of them are available.

2:04:40.680 --> 2:04:43.200
 You can find them by going to livemomentus.com

2:04:43.200 --> 2:04:44.240
 slash Huberman.

2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:46.800
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman

2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:48.400
 to find supplements for sleep,

2:04:48.400 --> 2:04:50.440
 for recovery from exercise, for focus,

2:04:50.440 --> 2:04:53.060
 and many other features that impact mental health,

2:04:53.060 --> 2:04:54.640
 physical health, and performance.

2:04:54.640 --> 2:04:56.340
 If you're not already following Huberman Lab

2:04:56.340 --> 2:04:59.180
 on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

2:04:59.180 --> 2:05:01.380
 At both places, I describe science

2:05:01.380 --> 2:05:03.000
 and science related tools

2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:04.920
 that relate to some of the themes covered here

2:05:04.920 --> 2:05:06.120
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:05:06.120 --> 2:05:07.680
 but oftentimes I'll do posts

2:05:07.680 --> 2:05:09.280
 that include information and tools

2:05:09.280 --> 2:05:12.060
 not detailed here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:05:12.060 --> 2:05:13.160
 We also have a newsletter.

2:05:13.160 --> 2:05:15.560
 I've mentioned this a few times during today's episode.

2:05:15.560 --> 2:05:17.740
 It is the neural network newsletter.

2:05:17.740 --> 2:05:21.000
 You can access that newsletter completely zero of cost.

2:05:21.000 --> 2:05:22.520
 By going to HubermanLab.com,

2:05:22.520 --> 2:05:24.300
 go to the menu and sign up for our newsletter.

2:05:24.300 --> 2:05:25.760
 You supply your email.

2:05:25.760 --> 2:05:27.800
 We do not share your email with anybody else.

2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:30.880
 We have a very clear privacy policy that you can find there.

2:05:30.880 --> 2:05:34.080
 If you want to see examples of previous newsletters,

2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:36.280
 you can find them there without having to sign up.

2:05:36.280 --> 2:05:37.800
 Again, that neural network newsletter

2:05:37.800 --> 2:05:39.440
 comes out about once a month,

2:05:39.440 --> 2:05:42.760
 and we use it to distill out essential protocols

2:05:42.760 --> 2:05:45.940
 from the podcast, to synthesize information from the podcast.

2:05:45.940 --> 2:05:47.720
 We do believe many people find them useful.

2:05:47.720 --> 2:05:49.740
 So sign up for the neural network newsletter

2:05:49.740 --> 2:05:50.760
 if you're interested.

2:05:50.760 --> 2:05:52.840
 So thank you once again for joining me today

2:05:52.840 --> 2:05:56.400
 for a discussion about the neural and neuromuscular

2:05:56.400 --> 2:05:58.920
 and connective tissue and skeletal aspects

2:05:58.920 --> 2:06:01.560
 of flexibility and stretching.

2:06:01.560 --> 2:06:04.480
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
