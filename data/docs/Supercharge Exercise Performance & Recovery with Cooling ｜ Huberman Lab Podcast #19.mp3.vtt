00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.680
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.680 --> 00:13.760
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.760 --> 00:15.840
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.000
 This podcast is separate

00:17.000 --> 00:19.440
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.620
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.620 --> 00:23.740
 to bring you zero cost to consumer information

00:23.740 --> 00:25.840
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.840 --> 00:27.540
 to the general public.

00:27.540 --> 00:28.680
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.680 --> 00:31.740
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.740 --> 00:34.460
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

00:34.460 --> 00:37.100
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

00:37.100 --> 00:39.600
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:39.600 --> 00:41.320
 to help you better understand your body

00:41.320 --> 00:43.760
 and help you reach your health goals.

00:43.760 --> 00:46.940
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood tests,

00:46.940 --> 00:48.660
 and the simple reason for that

00:48.660 --> 00:50.240
 is that so many of the factors

00:50.240 --> 00:53.120
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

00:53.120 --> 00:56.200
 and wellbeing can only be analyzed from blood.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.540
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

00:58.540 --> 01:00.780
 you can get additional layers of information

01:00.780 --> 01:02.460
 that can really support your understanding

01:02.460 --> 01:06.480
 about what's going on deep under the hood, so to speak,

01:06.480 --> 01:10.600
 inside your body and brain and what to do about it.

01:10.600 --> 01:12.240
 And I think that's really where Inside Tracker

01:12.240 --> 01:15.660
 sets itself apart from other similar tests.

01:15.660 --> 01:17.560
 What Inside Tracker offers is,

01:17.560 --> 01:19.880
 first of all, they make the tests very easy.

01:19.880 --> 01:22.200
 They can come to your home to take your blood and DNA test,

01:22.200 --> 01:25.260
 or you can go to a testing center nearby you.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.840
 Then you get the information back,

01:26.840 --> 01:28.640
 and rather than just getting information

01:28.640 --> 01:30.520
 about whether or not the levels of various things

01:30.520 --> 01:32.220
 are high or low,

01:32.220 --> 01:35.200
 you also get to find out what to do about it.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.840
 So it offers directives related to nutrition,

01:37.840 --> 01:40.120
 to exercise, and so forth.

01:40.120 --> 01:44.080
 It really allow you to be in control of your overall health,

01:44.080 --> 01:47.800
 both where you are now and its long-term trajectory.

01:47.800 --> 01:50.920
 With Inside Tracker, they also have something

01:50.920 --> 01:53.600
 which is it can give you a readout of your inner age.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.200
 They have something called the inner age test

01:55.200 --> 01:57.440
 that really compares your biological age

01:57.440 --> 01:58.620
 to your chronological age,

01:58.620 --> 02:00.840
 something that's of extreme importance and interest

02:00.840 --> 02:04.320
 because it has to do with lifespan or predicted lifespan.

02:04.320 --> 02:05.800
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

02:05.800 --> 02:08.600

02:22.520 --> 02:25.640
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.280
 Helix Sleep is a company that makes mattresses and pillows

02:28.280 --> 02:30.760
 ideally suited to your sleep needs.

02:30.760 --> 02:32.400
 I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress

02:32.400 --> 02:34.920
 for the last six months, and I can honestly say

02:34.920 --> 02:37.360
 it's the best sleep that I've ever gotten.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.440
 Helix Sleep has a quiz that can match you

02:39.440 --> 02:42.840
 to the ideal mattress and pillows for you.

02:42.840 --> 02:45.080
 It's a quiz that takes just about two minutes,

02:45.080 --> 02:47.600
 asks you questions like, do you tend to sleep on your side

02:47.600 --> 02:50.600
 or your back, on your stomach, or maybe you don't know

02:50.600 --> 02:52.620
 whether or not you tend to wake up feeling too warm

02:52.620 --> 02:56.400
 or too cold, various questions about your sleep habits.

02:56.400 --> 02:57.960
 At the end of that quiz, it matches you

02:57.960 --> 03:01.160
 to a specific mattress that's perfect for your sleep needs.

03:01.160 --> 03:04.220
 For me, it matched me to the DUSK, D-U-S-K,

03:04.220 --> 03:06.600
 because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm

03:06.600 --> 03:09.200
 nor too soft, and I really love the mattress.

03:09.200 --> 03:11.340
 As I mentioned, I've been sleeping terrifically well

03:11.340 --> 03:13.280
 ever since I got that mattress.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.980
 If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

03:14.980 --> 03:17.580
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

03:17.580 --> 03:19.080
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

03:19.080 --> 03:20.960
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress,

03:20.960 --> 03:24.180
 and then you'll get up to $200 off all mattresses,

03:24.180 --> 03:26.580
 and you'll get two free pillows.

03:26.580 --> 03:27.920
 They have a 10-year warranty.

03:27.920 --> 03:30.360
 You get to try it out for 100 nights risk-free.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.440
 If you don't like it, they'll even pick it up for free,

03:32.440 --> 03:34.800
 take it away, but I really think you will.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.120
 I certainly love mine.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.400
 Again, if you're interested, you can go

03:37.400 --> 03:40.780
 to helixsleep.com slash Huberman for up to $200 off

03:40.780 --> 03:42.640
 and two free pillows.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.720
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.200
 Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device

03:48.200 --> 03:50.660
 that releases deep muscle tension.

03:50.660 --> 03:53.820
 I first learned about Theragun on a lab expedition.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.780
 We were actually headed out to Ocean,

03:55.780 --> 03:58.320
 where we were doing diving with great white sharks,

03:58.320 --> 04:02.240
 filming those for our VR fear experiments in the laboratory,

04:02.240 --> 04:05.720
 and it was very long days of carrying Pelican cases.

04:05.720 --> 04:09.080
 Those are cases, these hard plastic cases with equipment.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.440
 It was diving.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.960
 We were all sore and tired all the time,

04:12.960 --> 04:15.280
 and someone had brought along a Theragun.

04:15.280 --> 04:16.640
 It was the first time I had seen one,

04:16.640 --> 04:18.440
 and pretty soon that thing was getting passed along

04:18.440 --> 04:21.120
 and became one of the more coveted devices on board.

04:21.120 --> 04:23.020
 Everyone wanted time with this thing because it was great.

04:23.020 --> 04:26.020
 You could give yourself a really terrific massage

04:26.020 --> 04:28.760
 and get deep into the tissue and relieve soreness.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.440
 When I got back, I got a Theragun,

04:30.440 --> 04:33.740
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.960
 Whether or not you want to treat your muscles

04:35.960 --> 04:37.480
 because they're tense from working out

04:37.480 --> 04:39.060
 or whether or not you just want to release stress,

04:39.060 --> 04:40.800
 it's a terrific tool.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.680
 Many of you are familiar probably

04:42.680 --> 04:45.720
 with professional massages, but Theragun is interesting

04:45.720 --> 04:46.920
 because you can basically give yourself

04:46.920 --> 04:49.560
 a deep tissue massage anytime, anywhere.

04:49.560 --> 04:51.240
 It's also very quiet.

04:51.240 --> 04:54.040
 If you want to try Theragun, you can try it for 30 days.

04:54.040 --> 04:56.200
 They start at only $199.

04:56.200 --> 04:59.640
 You can go to theragun.com slash Huberman right now,

04:59.640 --> 05:01.640
 and you can get your Gen 4 Theragun today.

05:01.640 --> 05:03.880
 That's the one that I use or another one of their models.

05:03.880 --> 05:08.600
 That's theragun.com slash Huberman to try Theragun.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.440
 This episode marks the beginning of a new topic

05:11.440 --> 05:13.800
 for the Huberman Lab Podcast.

05:13.800 --> 05:15.800
 As many of you already know,

05:15.800 --> 05:18.360
 we go deep into a particular topic over four,

05:18.360 --> 05:20.380
 sometimes even five episodes.

05:20.380 --> 05:23.280
 We just closed out the episodes on hormones.

05:23.280 --> 05:24.760
 Now we are going to talk about

05:24.760 --> 05:28.700
 how to optimize physical performance and skill learning.

05:28.700 --> 05:31.080
 We're going to look deep at the science behind this

05:31.080 --> 05:33.520
 as well as specific practices.

05:33.520 --> 05:36.400
 In fact, today, you're going to hear about specific tools

05:36.400 --> 05:40.000
 that you can use to improve endurance and strength

05:40.000 --> 05:42.160
 by up to, I'm not making this up,

05:42.160 --> 05:45.200
 three or four times your current capacity.

05:45.200 --> 05:47.720
 This is based on studies that were done at Stanford

05:47.720 --> 05:50.280
 and are currently in use by collegiate

05:50.280 --> 05:51.660
 and professional teams.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.420
 If you're not a professional athlete or a serious athlete,

05:55.420 --> 05:56.260
 that's okay.

05:56.260 --> 05:57.320
 The topics this month

05:57.320 --> 05:59.280
 and all the information we are going to cover

05:59.280 --> 06:02.080
 are going to make you a better recreational exerciser

06:02.080 --> 06:03.660
 as well.

06:03.660 --> 06:04.920
 If you're not an exerciser

06:04.920 --> 06:06.360
 and you're thinking about getting into that,

06:06.360 --> 06:08.060
 or if you live in the Northern hemisphere

06:08.060 --> 06:10.560
 and you're just thinking about the beach this summer,

06:10.560 --> 06:13.640
 fat loss, muscle building, that sort of thing,

06:13.640 --> 06:16.360
 this month, we're going to cover all of that as well.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.100
 There's so much confusion out there

06:18.100 --> 06:21.180
 about how to optimize fat loss, muscle building,

06:21.180 --> 06:23.280
 improvements in flexibility, for instance,

06:23.280 --> 06:24.400
 or skill learning.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.080
 I know many of you aren't so focused

06:26.080 --> 06:29.200
 on the cosmetic aspects of physical exercise,

06:29.200 --> 06:31.380
 but are interested in actual skill learning.

06:31.380 --> 06:33.120
 We're going to talk about that too.

06:34.020 --> 06:35.700
 I want to just take a moment

06:35.700 --> 06:38.560
 to reflect on something that came up last episode.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.320
 If you didn't see that episode, that's quite all right.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.180
 But last episode,

06:42.180 --> 06:45.120
 we were talking about the hormones adrenaline and cortisol

06:45.120 --> 06:48.760
 and how to leverage those towards attention and learning.

06:48.760 --> 06:50.380
 And there was a little bit of confusion

06:50.380 --> 06:51.800
 that I want to clarify.

06:51.800 --> 06:54.340
 I mentioned an optimal protocol for learning

06:54.340 --> 06:56.560
 that involved leveraging adrenaline,

06:56.560 --> 06:58.000
 also called epinephrine.

06:58.000 --> 07:00.300
 And it involved four steps.

07:00.300 --> 07:02.340
 The four steps that I spelled out

07:02.340 --> 07:04.960
 were to be calm and focused

07:04.960 --> 07:08.680
 while one is trying to acquire or learn the new skill,

07:08.680 --> 07:10.480
 cognitive skill or motor skill.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.480
 Then to have a spike in adrenaline,

07:13.480 --> 07:15.040
 I mentioned ways to do that,

07:15.040 --> 07:18.020
 using cold or breathing or other tools.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.700
 Immediately after the learning episode,

07:20.700 --> 07:24.040
 then to incorporate what I call non-sleep deep rest,

07:24.040 --> 07:27.800
 a 20 minute episode of a shallow nap

07:27.800 --> 07:30.440
 or some other protocol like NSDR,

07:30.440 --> 07:32.160
 non-sleep deep rest protocol,

07:32.160 --> 07:35.080
 of which we always provide links in the captions.

07:35.080 --> 07:38.320
 And then to try and optimize sleep later that night

07:38.320 --> 07:39.780
 and the subsequent night.

07:39.780 --> 07:43.400
 Some of you heard this and it sunk in right away

07:43.400 --> 07:44.600
 and it was straightforward.

07:44.600 --> 07:47.280
 Others said, wait, I thought from a previous episode,

07:47.280 --> 07:48.120
 even before that,

07:48.120 --> 07:49.920
 you said you're supposed to do non-sleep deep rest

07:49.920 --> 07:51.080
 immediately after learning.

07:51.080 --> 07:54.440
 No, we added another step.

07:54.440 --> 07:55.880
 The logic still follows

07:55.880 --> 07:59.040
 that you want to be calm and focused during learning.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.960
 Then you want to spike adrenaline at the end.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.320
 Most people get that backward.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.620
 They're drinking too much coffee

08:03.620 --> 08:05.240
 or even taking nootropics and things,

08:05.240 --> 08:07.140
 trying to be really focused while learning.

08:07.140 --> 08:09.660
 Some people are taking Adderall recreationally,

08:09.660 --> 08:11.040
 something I don't recommend.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.160
 That's actually getting the whole process backwards

08:13.160 --> 08:15.040
 if you look at the data and the physiology.

08:15.040 --> 08:17.320
 You want to spike adrenaline at the end

08:17.320 --> 08:20.060
 or immediately after a learning episode

08:20.060 --> 08:24.400
 and then non-sleep deep rest and then sleep itself.

08:24.400 --> 08:25.420
 Okay, four steps.

08:25.420 --> 08:27.000
 Hope that clarifies things for you.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.360
 If you have any additional questions,

08:28.360 --> 08:31.280
 please put them in the comment section below.

08:31.280 --> 08:34.900
 Okay, so let's talk about physical performance.

08:34.900 --> 08:37.920
 There are so many variables to physical performance

08:37.920 --> 08:41.680
 and we can manage physical performance and skill learning

08:41.680 --> 08:43.840
 from a variety of contexts.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.600
 I made just a short list of some of the things

08:45.600 --> 08:47.920
 that come to mind that can powerfully impact

08:47.920 --> 08:50.240
 physical performance and skill learning.

08:50.240 --> 08:53.160
 Some of them are what I would consider foundational.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.680
 They allow you to show up with your current ability.

08:56.680 --> 08:58.720
 And if you were to disrupt those,

08:58.720 --> 09:00.540
 you would perform less well.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.360
 So things like getting a good night's sleep,

09:03.360 --> 09:05.960
 things like being properly hydrated,

09:05.960 --> 09:08.060
 things like being well-nourished,

09:08.060 --> 09:09.160
 whatever that means to you.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.120
 I know some of you like to exercise fasted.

09:11.120 --> 09:14.640
 Some of you prefer to have food in your stomach

09:14.640 --> 09:16.540
 or have eaten a couple hours before.

09:17.560 --> 09:19.220
 There are supplements, there are drugs,

09:19.220 --> 09:20.740
 there are different ways to breathe.

09:20.740 --> 09:24.300
 There are so many tools related to mindset visualization.

09:24.300 --> 09:25.900
 There are machines and devices.

09:25.900 --> 09:30.320
 It's just a vast space, but it's not infinite.

09:30.320 --> 09:33.880
 And there are a few things in the list of things

09:33.880 --> 09:37.440
 that can impact and even optimize physical performance

09:37.440 --> 09:41.040
 and skill learning that have an outsized effect

09:41.040 --> 09:42.400
 that any of you can use.

09:42.400 --> 09:45.840
 Many of them, most of them are low to zero cost.

09:45.840 --> 09:48.880
 So today we are going to focus on what I believe

09:48.880 --> 09:52.460
 to be one of the most powerful tools

09:52.460 --> 09:55.600
 to improve physical performance and skill learning

09:55.600 --> 09:57.520
 and recovery.

09:57.520 --> 10:00.400
 We'll talk about why that's important.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.560
 And that's temperature.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.780
 Now, many of you might think, oh, that's kind of boring.

10:04.780 --> 10:07.380
 I want to know about the magic pill that I can take

10:07.380 --> 10:09.040
 that's going to allow me a dunk of basketball

10:09.040 --> 10:11.080
 if I currently can't, or I want to know about the thing

10:11.080 --> 10:12.780
 that's going to let me run further and faster,

10:12.780 --> 10:14.200
 is going to shed fat.

10:14.200 --> 10:18.840
 Believe it or not, temperature is the most powerful variable

10:18.840 --> 10:23.160
 for improving physical performance and for recovery.

10:23.160 --> 10:25.840
 I would argue it's even more important than sleep

10:25.840 --> 10:28.880
 because temperature itself is going to dictate

10:28.880 --> 10:30.680
 how well and when you sleep

10:30.680 --> 10:32.580
 and the depth of your total recovery.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.140
 There are two aspects to temperature, of course.

10:36.140 --> 10:38.780
 There's heat and there's cold.

10:38.780 --> 10:41.640
 We are mainly going to focus on cold

10:41.640 --> 10:44.000
 as a way to buffer heat.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.940
 In a previous podcast episode,

10:45.940 --> 10:47.780
 I talked all about growth hormone.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.180
 You can find that episode about thyroid and growth hormone

10:50.180 --> 10:52.480
 and how heat can be a powerful stimulus

10:52.480 --> 10:54.520
 for increasing growth hormone,

10:54.520 --> 10:56.860
 which is involved in tissue repair and et cetera,

10:56.860 --> 11:00.700
 can burn fat and improve metabolism in various ways.

11:00.700 --> 11:03.680
 However, cold, I would argue,

11:03.680 --> 11:06.520
 is even more powerful than heat as a tool.

11:06.520 --> 11:08.600
 And I'm not just talking about putting ice packs

11:08.600 --> 11:13.360
 on sore muscles or slightly sprained limbs and ankles

11:13.360 --> 11:14.780
 and things of that sort.

11:14.780 --> 11:16.180
 We're going to talk about cold

11:16.180 --> 11:19.840
 from the standpoint of thermal physiology.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.680
 This is a literature that's rich in scientific information

11:23.680 --> 11:27.680
 that goes back very deep into the last century

11:27.680 --> 11:30.560
 where physiologists and neuroscientists figured out

11:30.560 --> 11:33.320
 that there are different compartments in your body

11:33.320 --> 11:35.440
 that heat and cool you differently

11:35.440 --> 11:38.600
 and that you can leverage those in order to double,

11:38.600 --> 11:39.440
 and as I mentioned before,

11:39.440 --> 11:41.720
 even triple or quadruple your work output,

11:41.720 --> 11:44.840
 both strength, repetitions, and endurance.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.400
 So this is not weak sauce, as they say.

11:47.400 --> 11:50.940
 This is the stuff that can really shift the needle

11:50.940 --> 11:51.780
 quite a bit.

11:51.780 --> 11:54.640
 And it's not just about performing well once,

11:54.640 --> 11:56.320
 it's about being able to perform well

11:56.320 --> 11:57.900
 and recover from that performance

11:57.900 --> 11:59.480
 so that you do even better

11:59.480 --> 12:02.080
 when you're not incorporating these tools.

12:02.080 --> 12:05.620
 On days where, for instance, you can't access cold

12:05.620 --> 12:08.880
 or an ice pack or an ice bath or things of that sort.

12:08.880 --> 12:10.600
 Okay, so we're going to cover cold.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.160
 We're going to talk a little bit about

12:12.160 --> 12:15.300
 the physiology of cold and heat and how they work,

12:15.300 --> 12:19.120
 because as you've probably heard me say before,

12:19.120 --> 12:21.240
 if you can understand some mechanism,

12:21.240 --> 12:22.320
 if you can just push yourself

12:22.320 --> 12:23.740
 through a little bit of new knowledge

12:23.740 --> 12:26.480
 into understanding a little bit of mechanism

12:26.480 --> 12:27.680
 about how you work,

12:27.680 --> 12:31.560
 you will be in a far better position to implement the tools

12:31.560 --> 12:34.760
 in the best and most flexible ways for your needs.

12:34.760 --> 12:37.220
 This is why at the Huberman Lab Podcast,

12:37.220 --> 12:41.320
 I never ever do a just list of the things that you should do.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.600
 I don't believe in the just tell me what to do.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.840
 First, I tell you why you should do something.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.200
 What's the logical framework that it's grounded in?

12:48.200 --> 12:51.640
 And then we distill that down to specific protocols.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.300
 For those of you that are too impatient for that,

12:53.300 --> 12:55.440
 there are millions, if not billions

12:55.440 --> 12:56.560
 of other resources out there

12:56.560 --> 12:58.620
 that will take you into the cul-de-sac

12:58.620 --> 13:01.680
 of one protocol that will work and then stop working

13:01.680 --> 13:03.280
 or might work for you indefinitely.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.940
 That's not how we work here.

13:04.940 --> 13:07.580
 This is about really understanding the mechanism

13:07.580 --> 13:10.280
 so that you can tweak things and modify things,

13:10.280 --> 13:12.400
 adjust the timing and the dosage of things

13:12.400 --> 13:16.120
 and really get the most out of these tools and protocols.

13:16.120 --> 13:18.400
 Everything I'm going to talk about

13:18.400 --> 13:21.000
 pertains to both endurance exercise

13:21.000 --> 13:24.560
 and strength and speed type exercise.

13:24.560 --> 13:27.560
 So sprints, weightlifting, endurance work,

13:27.560 --> 13:29.100
 and to some extent flexibility,

13:29.100 --> 13:32.040
 but we are going to cover flexibility in depth

13:32.040 --> 13:34.360
 as well as another feature that's not often talked about

13:34.360 --> 13:37.280
 which is suppleness or smoothness of movement

13:37.280 --> 13:40.920
 over different ranges of movement in a subsequent episode.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.980
 Let's start by talking about temperature.

13:43.980 --> 13:45.700
 What is temperature?

13:45.700 --> 13:48.400
 How does temperature impact the body

13:48.400 --> 13:52.320
 and its ability to perform, including learn new skills?

13:52.320 --> 13:54.540
 So everyone probably remembers

13:54.540 --> 13:58.260
 or has at least heard of the word homeostasis, right?

13:58.260 --> 14:00.080
 That the body wants to remain

14:00.080 --> 14:02.720
 in a particular range of temperatures,

14:02.720 --> 14:05.680
 that it doesn't like to be too hot or too cold.

14:05.680 --> 14:08.240
 And I want to emphasize from the outset

14:08.240 --> 14:12.080
 that there are many mechanisms that are installed into us

14:12.080 --> 14:16.280
 by way of our evolutionary design and our genome,

14:16.280 --> 14:18.640
 meaning we were just born with this stuff ready

14:18.640 --> 14:21.740
 to keep our body temperature in a particular narrow range.

14:22.680 --> 14:26.380
 Heating up too much is just plain bad.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.240
 It's not just bad for physical performance,

14:28.240 --> 14:31.640
 it's bad for all tissue health.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.980
 If your brain heats up too much,

14:32.980 --> 14:37.800
 neurons start dying and those neurons don't come back, okay?

14:37.800 --> 14:39.440
 You may have heard about neurogenesis,

14:39.440 --> 14:42.040
 the ability for the brain to regenerate itself

14:42.040 --> 14:43.640
 or generate new neurons in adulthood.

14:43.640 --> 14:48.380
 There's very little neurogenesis, excuse me, in adulthood,

14:48.380 --> 14:50.880
 even any time after puberty, really.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.580
 And you don't want to lose neurons

14:53.580 --> 14:54.920
 in the central nervous system.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.680
 If you get too hot, that'll happen.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.240
 It's called hyperthermia.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.660
 You want to avoid hyperthermia.

14:59.660 --> 15:02.960
 And you have many mechanisms that are built into you

15:02.960 --> 15:05.800
 to avoid becoming hyperthermic.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.560
 The other thing that happens when we get too warm

15:08.560 --> 15:13.560
 is that we have in all of our cells what are called enzymes.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.580
 You generally know if something's an enzyme

15:16.580 --> 15:19.920
 because it ends in the letters A-S-E, right?

15:19.920 --> 15:24.920
 So lipase is an enzyme that exists to digest fats.

15:25.160 --> 15:29.920
 You have proteases that are there to digest proteins, right?

15:29.920 --> 15:34.920
 So anytime you see A-S-E, chances are it's an enzyme.

15:34.920 --> 15:39.920
 Enzymes are proteins and they have a particular structure

15:41.100 --> 15:46.100
 and their structure becomes modified when heat increases.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.440
 And that's not good.

15:47.440 --> 15:50.340
 You want their structure to be of a particular type.

15:50.340 --> 15:52.580
 Imagine a car with four wheels.

15:52.580 --> 15:55.020
 Let's just say the car is the enzyme.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.480
 If it gets too hot, it's like two of the wheels fall off

15:58.480 --> 15:59.840
 and that thing can't function.

15:59.840 --> 16:02.960
 So one of the reasons why the body and nature

16:02.960 --> 16:05.800
 goes through so much effort to build in mechanisms

16:05.800 --> 16:07.960
 to make sure that we don't become too warm

16:07.960 --> 16:10.000
 is because when we get too warm,

16:10.000 --> 16:13.460
 these enzymes don't function, cells stop functioning,

16:13.460 --> 16:15.720
 they stop being able to generate energy,

16:15.720 --> 16:18.400
 they stop being able to digest things,

16:18.400 --> 16:20.280
 you stop being able to think

16:20.280 --> 16:24.480
 and eventually those cells start dying off entirely.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.600
 So keeping temperature in a particular range is really good.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.440
 You don't want to get too hot.

16:29.440 --> 16:32.760
 We have much more flexibility in terms of getting cold.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.060
 Now you don't want to become hypothermic either.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.460
 You can die from hypothermia

16:36.460 --> 16:39.140
 just like you can die from hyperthermia.

16:39.140 --> 16:44.140
 However, that you have a lot more range to be cold

16:44.240 --> 16:46.800
 than you do to be too warm, okay?

16:46.800 --> 16:50.620
 And in general, the idea is to keep the body and brain

16:50.620 --> 16:53.900
 in a particular range, but anytime we do anything,

16:54.760 --> 16:56.840
 our body temperature can shift.

16:56.840 --> 17:01.000
 So for instance, if you were to stand next to a campfire

17:01.000 --> 17:03.060
 or you were outside on a hot day,

17:03.060 --> 17:06.960
 various things would happen to dump heat from your body.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.580
 If you were outside on a cold day

17:08.580 --> 17:11.720
 or you were to get into a cold shower or a cold lake,

17:11.720 --> 17:13.700
 various things would happen to insulate heat

17:13.700 --> 17:14.540
 within your body.

17:14.540 --> 17:17.040
 This is all pretty straightforward and obvious, I realize.

17:17.040 --> 17:18.640
 Now, what are those things?

17:18.640 --> 17:21.160
 Well, there are a huge category of them.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.000
 When you get into cold water, you secrete adrenaline.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.200
 On a hot day, if it's really hot or in a very hot sauna

17:27.200 --> 17:28.040
 or in the hot desert,

17:28.040 --> 17:30.460
 you will generate what are called heat shock proteins,

17:30.460 --> 17:33.520
 which will set off other sets of cascades,

17:33.520 --> 17:36.240
 metabolic cascades, biological cascades.

17:37.560 --> 17:40.360
 But the simplest way to think about this process

17:40.360 --> 17:45.320
 is that when we get cold, we tend to vasoconstrict.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.640
 Our blood vessels tend to constrict

17:47.640 --> 17:51.120
 and we tend to push energy toward the core of our body

17:51.120 --> 17:53.280
 to preserve our core organs, okay?

17:53.280 --> 17:56.120
 So our periphery, our hands and our feet and our toes

17:56.120 --> 17:59.080
 and our legs become colder and our core,

17:59.080 --> 18:01.600
 therefore, can maintain blood to that area

18:01.600 --> 18:03.540
 and we are insulating our core.

18:04.440 --> 18:08.760
 Conversely, when we heat up, our blood vessels vasodilate.

18:08.760 --> 18:13.000
 They expand a bit and more blood flows to our periphery

18:13.000 --> 18:16.200
 and more blood can move throughout the body generally

18:16.200 --> 18:19.560
 and we will perspire, we will sweat.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.000
 Water will actually get pulled out of the blood

18:22.000 --> 18:24.620
 to some extent, moved up through sweat glands

18:24.620 --> 18:27.160
 and will be brought to the skin surface

18:27.160 --> 18:28.780
 so that it can be dumped.

18:28.780 --> 18:30.800
 We are dumping heat.

18:30.800 --> 18:34.600
 Animals, as you know, vary in their capacity to sweat.

18:34.600 --> 18:38.320
 Some animals like camels won't start sweating at first.

18:38.320 --> 18:40.520
 If they heat up, what they'll do is they'll spit.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.200
 They'll dump heat by spitting, okay?

18:43.200 --> 18:46.320
 Dogs pant, Costello is off to my left here.

18:46.320 --> 18:48.720
 He pants when he gets too warm.

18:48.720 --> 18:52.680
 He can't sweat or dogs can maybe sweat a little bit

18:52.680 --> 18:56.640
 but we can sweat and you've probably noticed

18:56.640 --> 19:01.320
 that on a humid hot day, you'll feel much warmer

19:01.320 --> 19:03.800
 just walking or running than you would

19:03.800 --> 19:06.560
 with the equivalent exercise or movement

19:06.560 --> 19:08.080
 that you would on a cold day.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.360
 And some of you probably know this, but if you don't,

19:10.360 --> 19:13.300
 the reason is you sweat on a cold day

19:13.300 --> 19:16.680
 but because the air is dry typically,

19:16.680 --> 19:19.800
 you will bring that sweat to the surface

19:19.800 --> 19:21.780
 and provided you're wearing clothes

19:21.780 --> 19:26.720
 that allow some air to get out away from the body.

19:26.720 --> 19:29.500
 So you're not wearing really tight spandex type clothing

19:29.500 --> 19:30.340
 or something like that

19:30.340 --> 19:32.800
 or seal type saran wrap type clothing.

19:33.660 --> 19:37.440
 That sweat will evaporate off into the dry atmosphere.

19:37.440 --> 19:40.140
 Whereas on a humid day, the reason you see people

19:40.140 --> 19:42.640
 in New York and Florida on a humid summer day

19:42.640 --> 19:44.360
 and they're like moving their shirts off themselves

19:44.360 --> 19:46.120
 and you see people with big sweat stains

19:46.120 --> 19:49.320
 and back sweat stains and all this kind of stuff

19:49.320 --> 19:52.440
 is because they're sweating as they normally would

19:52.440 --> 19:55.900
 but it's humid and so the humidity of the air

19:55.900 --> 19:58.000
 doesn't allow transfer of that sweat

19:58.000 --> 20:02.640
 into the atmosphere as readily and so you're hot, okay?

20:02.640 --> 20:06.480
 So without the evaporation, you're going to be warmer.

20:06.480 --> 20:09.400
 So we evaporate off sweat, we sweat

20:09.400 --> 20:11.680
 and we vasodilate when we want to dump heat.

20:11.680 --> 20:13.280
 When we want to maintain heat,

20:13.280 --> 20:16.600
 we vasoconstrict and we tend to not sweat.

20:16.600 --> 20:19.480
 The other thing that happens is you'll get goosebumps,

20:19.480 --> 20:21.960
 so-called goose pimples they're sometimes called.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.280
 Those are a throwback to the time

20:24.280 --> 20:27.760
 where we had fur over most, not all of our body.

20:27.760 --> 20:31.800
 All mammals in the cold have a process

20:31.800 --> 20:34.900
 whereby adrenaline is released at low levels,

20:34.900 --> 20:36.560
 typically into the body.

20:36.560 --> 20:40.600
 That adrenaline activates what are called sympathetic fibers.

20:40.600 --> 20:42.280
 They have nothing to do with sympathy.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.400
 Those little fibers, which are neurons,

20:44.400 --> 20:46.820
 those fibers that what I'm saying are fibers are neurons,

20:46.820 --> 20:49.440
 not clothing fibers, reach up into the skin.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.940
 So your whole body is covered with these little tiny neurons

20:51.940 --> 20:54.780
 that reach up into the skin and when we are cold,

20:54.780 --> 20:57.840
 they actually mechanically take the hair follicle

20:57.840 --> 21:00.120
 and bend it up.

21:00.120 --> 21:05.120
 It's a process called piloerection, P-I-L-O, erection, okay?

21:05.320 --> 21:09.520
 So on a hot day, you want to dump heat, okay?

21:09.520 --> 21:11.920
 So on a hot day, what would happen is

21:11.920 --> 21:14.440
 you'd actually not see those goose pimples

21:14.440 --> 21:16.480
 because you want the hairs lying down,

21:16.480 --> 21:18.820
 which actually you would think that might insulate you more,

21:18.820 --> 21:20.780
 but would actually let more heat dissipate

21:20.780 --> 21:22.360
 out through the skin.

21:22.360 --> 21:25.620
 On a cold day, you get these goose pimples or goosebumps,

21:25.620 --> 21:27.860
 which are really just an ancient carryover

21:27.860 --> 21:32.040
 from the body's attempt to make hair stand up on end.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.200
 And when hair step stand up on end

21:34.200 --> 21:35.140
 and they're very close together,

21:35.140 --> 21:36.920
 that traps air in between them

21:36.920 --> 21:40.540
 and actually creates a sort of insulated blanket of warm air.

21:40.540 --> 21:45.540
 If you've ever seen an animal like a malamute or a husky,

21:45.800 --> 21:48.280
 you might think, oh, that poor thing on a hot day,

21:48.280 --> 21:50.100
 what does it do with all that hair?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.880
 Well, it can be warm, so the animal will typically pant

21:52.880 --> 21:54.800
 and its hair will lay down,

21:54.800 --> 21:56.980
 which you might think would act as more of a blanket,

21:56.980 --> 21:59.160
 but on a cold day, what'll happen is

21:59.160 --> 22:01.800
 they'll become very puffy.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.280
 Their hair will stand up on end

22:03.280 --> 22:05.620
 and that's actually trapping heat between the hairs

22:05.620 --> 22:07.640
 and they're actually quite well insulated.

22:07.640 --> 22:11.260
 So it's very important that if you want to understand

22:11.260 --> 22:15.520
 how you can leverage temperature for physical performance,

22:15.520 --> 22:18.160
 you have to understand that you have vasoconstriction

22:18.160 --> 22:20.540
 to conserve heat, vasodilation to dump heat,

22:20.540 --> 22:22.200
 that you have sweating to dump heat

22:22.200 --> 22:24.680
 and you have conservation of fluids

22:24.680 --> 22:26.480
 in order to preserve heat.

22:27.880 --> 22:29.480
 That's the most important thing

22:29.480 --> 22:31.460
 in terms of understanding the mechanisms

22:31.460 --> 22:33.480
 of maintaining and dumping heat.

22:33.480 --> 22:36.440
 And now the most important thing to understand is that

22:36.440 --> 22:37.980
 if you get too hot,

22:37.980 --> 22:40.480
 not only do those enzymes stop working,

22:40.480 --> 22:45.200
 but your ability to contract your muscles stops, okay?

22:45.200 --> 22:47.960
 I'm going to repeat this because it's vitally important.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.560
 ATP is involved in the process

22:52.560 --> 22:54.280
 of generating muscle contractions.

22:54.280 --> 22:55.920
 Doesn't matter if you're running a marathon,

22:55.920 --> 22:57.480
 doesn't matter if you're doing a yoga class,

22:57.480 --> 23:01.200
 doesn't matter if you're going for a 700 pound squat.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.940
 The range of temperatures within which ATP can function

23:04.940 --> 23:07.880
 and muscles can contract is very narrow.

23:07.880 --> 23:11.600
 Somewhere around 39 or 40 degrees Celsius,

23:11.600 --> 23:13.760
 it drops off and you will not be able

23:13.760 --> 23:16.260
 to generate more contractions.

23:16.260 --> 23:17.300
 Now that's pretty hot,

23:17.300 --> 23:21.080
 but that temperature can be generated locally really fast.

23:21.080 --> 23:22.960
 Now, if you're too cold, it's true,

23:22.960 --> 23:24.600
 it's hard to generate muscle contractions.

23:24.600 --> 23:28.400
 I got into doing some cold water swimming a little while ago

23:28.400 --> 23:30.460
 and we would joke that you come out of the water,

23:30.460 --> 23:32.200
 we do no wetsuits.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.040
 I'm not recommending people do this necessarily

23:34.040 --> 23:35.620
 unless you're certainly with somebody else

23:35.620 --> 23:37.720
 who's skilled at doing it, which I was.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.240
 And you come out and you feel like you have claws for hands.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.200
 You could never text on a phone for the first few minutes.

23:43.200 --> 23:45.180
 I mean, the water was very, very cold

23:45.180 --> 23:46.640
 and you can't even move your face.

23:46.640 --> 23:48.800
 And so muscles will become rigid,

23:48.800 --> 23:52.460
 but heating up muscles causes them to fail

23:52.460 --> 23:55.360
 to be able to generate more contractions.

23:55.360 --> 23:59.360
 Put simply, if you get too hot, you stop exercising.

23:59.360 --> 24:00.720
 You may not even realize it,

24:00.720 --> 24:03.360
 but your will to exercise further,

24:03.360 --> 24:05.880
 your ability to push harder

24:05.880 --> 24:08.860
 is entirely dependent on the heat of the muscle,

24:08.860 --> 24:11.740
 both locally and your whole system.

24:11.740 --> 24:14.300
 So let's talk about your whole system

24:14.300 --> 24:18.080
 because I just described heat dumping and heat maintaining.

24:18.080 --> 24:20.680
 I told you that increasing heat

24:20.680 --> 24:22.720
 makes it hard for muscles to contract.

24:22.720 --> 24:26.600
 It will stop you from being able to run further and faster.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.440
 It will stop you from being able to lift more weights,

24:29.440 --> 24:31.500
 more sets, more repetitions.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.760
 If you can keep temperature in range, however,

24:34.760 --> 24:38.800
 in a proper range, you will be able to do more work.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.540
 You will be able to create greater output.

24:41.540 --> 24:45.140
 You'll be able to lift more weight, more sets, more reps,

24:45.140 --> 24:47.560
 and you'll be able to run further.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.440
 Now, there are data that I'm going to talk about

24:49.440 --> 24:51.880
 in a little bit that are absolutely striking

24:51.880 --> 24:53.160
 that underscore that statement.

24:53.160 --> 24:55.200
 There are data from my colleague, Craig Heller's lab

24:55.200 --> 24:57.280
 in the Department of Biology at Stanford.

24:57.280 --> 24:59.840
 And there are data that are now being implemented.

24:59.840 --> 25:03.120
 They were first implemented in a grant funded by DARPA,

25:03.120 --> 25:05.080
 but now in professional sports teams.

25:05.080 --> 25:07.520
 Many, if not all the NFL teams

25:07.520 --> 25:10.720
 are now using this technology as well as military uses it.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.520
 And not just for sports performance,

25:12.520 --> 25:15.360
 but also firefighters, construction workers,

25:15.360 --> 25:18.680
 other professions where elevated heat

25:18.680 --> 25:20.620
 becomes a barrier to performance.

25:20.620 --> 25:23.880
 And you can leverage this to really improve your workouts.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.020
 And when I say really improve, it is striking.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.600
 I'm going to give away a little hint of this now,

25:27.600 --> 25:28.440
 and then I'm going to tell you

25:28.440 --> 25:29.720
 a little bit more of the data later

25:29.720 --> 25:31.320
 after I tell you the protocols.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.640
 Proper cooling of the body,

25:35.640 --> 25:38.500
 which has to be done in a very specific way,

25:38.500 --> 25:40.960
 has allowed recreational athletes,

25:40.960 --> 25:43.040
 so college students and typical adults,

25:43.040 --> 25:45.100
 as well as professional athletes

25:45.100 --> 25:48.260
 to go from doing their usual output.

25:48.260 --> 25:50.360
 In this case, what comes to mind best

25:50.360 --> 25:52.680
 would be a particular professional athlete,

25:52.680 --> 25:55.080
 he's a member of the 49ers at the time,

25:55.080 --> 25:58.600
 was able to do 40 dips on his first set, 30, 20, 20,

25:58.600 --> 26:00.520
 basically did 10 sets of dips,

26:00.520 --> 26:01.840
 unassisted with anything else.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.120
 That's an impressive,

26:04.120 --> 26:06.880
 especially since he's a really large guy.

26:06.880 --> 26:08.420
 40 dips is respectable.

26:08.420 --> 26:10.680
 These are strict, full range dips.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.120
 And then by the 10th set, there's a steep drop-off.

26:14.120 --> 26:18.680
 Using proper cooling of particular body compartments,

26:18.680 --> 26:23.280
 he was able to triple that within less than a week

26:23.280 --> 26:25.320
 and maintain that performance

26:25.320 --> 26:26.780
 even without the cooling approach.

26:26.780 --> 26:29.860
 So it was actually a conditioning effect, all right?

26:29.860 --> 26:31.400
 I'll get back to this in a little bit,

26:31.400 --> 26:35.360
 but there are other fantastic leaps of effort

26:35.360 --> 26:38.800
 and leaps of performance that were demonstrated,

26:38.800 --> 26:40.580
 including endurance running.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.360
 Before I continue any further,

26:43.360 --> 26:47.000
 I just want to underscore again that overheating is terrible.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.460
 There's a famous example of this.

26:50.460 --> 26:52.440
 This was about 10, 15 years ago

26:52.440 --> 26:54.620
 when a number of dietary supplements

26:54.620 --> 26:56.520
 that included things like epinephrine,

26:56.520 --> 26:57.760
 which is a stimulant.

26:57.760 --> 27:00.800
 It's a beta adrenergic stimulant.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.320
 Drugs like glenbuterol,

27:02.320 --> 27:04.340
 which were then banned from the Olympics,

27:04.340 --> 27:06.380
 which are still out there a bit in recreational use,

27:06.380 --> 27:08.880
 which were beta adrenergic agonists.

27:08.880 --> 27:11.740
 So these are drugs that sort of mimic

27:11.740 --> 27:13.600
 epinephrine adrenaline to some extent.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.360
 I know I'm oversimplifying this here.

27:15.360 --> 27:18.560
 They improve flat loss because of the effects on metabolism,

27:18.560 --> 27:20.160
 but they heat up the body.

27:20.160 --> 27:22.680
 And what happened was, this hit the press very widely,

27:22.680 --> 27:24.560
 is high school football players

27:24.560 --> 27:26.840
 and various professional athletes were dropping dead

27:26.840 --> 27:27.800
 because they were overheating

27:27.800 --> 27:29.840
 during practice or in competition.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.720
 So much so that glenbuterol was banned.

27:32.720 --> 27:33.640
 Although every once in a while,

27:33.640 --> 27:36.680
 somebody gets in trouble for using this.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.000
 There was an instance of this recently

27:38.000 --> 27:39.040
 in professional boxing,

27:39.040 --> 27:41.160
 which was attributed to a bad meat

27:41.160 --> 27:42.840
 that contained the glenbuterol.

27:42.840 --> 27:44.480
 I don't know what the source was.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.580
 I don't have any commentary about that,

27:47.580 --> 27:48.840
 but it still is in use.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.740
 But these drugs increase body temperature,

27:51.740 --> 27:53.560
 increase fat loss,

27:53.560 --> 27:55.940
 but carry a severe danger.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.560
 And that's the danger of hyperthermia.

27:58.560 --> 27:59.680
 In fact, I would argue,

27:59.680 --> 28:01.760
 and I think in talking to some folks

28:01.760 --> 28:03.920
 at various professional fighting organizations,

28:03.920 --> 28:05.660
 it's very clear that a lot of the deaths

28:05.660 --> 28:07.960
 that one sees in professional combat sports

28:08.880 --> 28:13.040
 may have to do as much with dehydration and overheating

28:13.040 --> 28:15.360
 as it does with getting hit in the head,

28:15.360 --> 28:16.480
 which is also bad,

28:16.480 --> 28:17.800
 but that things can compound,

28:17.800 --> 28:19.920
 they can have a synergistic effect.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.800
 And just a note about that

28:21.800 --> 28:24.480
 and hyperthermia and its dangers as well,

28:24.480 --> 28:26.240
 my first project ever in science

28:26.240 --> 28:30.260
 was to evaluate the thermogenic effects of MDMA, of ecstasy.

28:30.260 --> 28:33.640
 That was my senior thesis in college, actually.

28:33.640 --> 28:37.640
 And so what we found was that indeed drugs

28:37.640 --> 28:41.920
 that remove your understanding of how warm you are

28:41.920 --> 28:45.560
 cause you to not take on the appropriate behaviors

28:45.560 --> 28:47.240
 to cool yourself, right?

28:47.240 --> 28:50.680
 So your vasoconstriction and your sweating,

28:50.680 --> 28:51.840
 those are autonomic.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.280
 Those are going to happen no matter what,

28:53.280 --> 28:56.420
 unless you happen to take something that blocks that effect.

28:56.420 --> 28:59.140
 However, there are a lot of things that we as humans do

28:59.140 --> 29:01.080
 to prevent ourselves from overheating.

29:01.080 --> 29:04.080
 And the main one is stop.

29:04.080 --> 29:05.960
 When we are running in the desert

29:05.960 --> 29:09.180
 or when we're running very hard and suddenly we stop,

29:09.180 --> 29:12.040
 oftentimes that's because the muscles are overheating.

29:12.040 --> 29:13.460
 It's a subconscious thing.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.920
 We won't often think, oh, I'm really much too warm.

29:15.920 --> 29:17.600
 It's just that we stop

29:17.600 --> 29:19.760
 and it's a self-preservation mechanism.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.120
 Sometimes it kicks in too early.

29:21.120 --> 29:23.320
 Sometimes it kicks in too late.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.400
 Kicks in too late, you can die.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.380
 There's an instance in the 1984 Olympics

29:27.380 --> 29:30.100
 where that was the first year, I believe,

29:30.100 --> 29:32.360
 that there was a women's marathon.

29:32.360 --> 29:33.560
 I think that's correct.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.980
 And one of the front runners or top picks for winning

29:36.980 --> 29:38.440
 was heading into the stadium.

29:38.440 --> 29:41.240
 And all of a sudden it seemed as if she was lost.

29:41.240 --> 29:42.620
 She was kind of wandering around

29:42.620 --> 29:44.120
 not knowing where she should go.

29:44.120 --> 29:46.160
 And in fact, she was in a position to win

29:46.160 --> 29:48.720
 or at least take second place, at least take silver.

29:48.720 --> 29:52.040
 Got totally disoriented and did miserably in the race.

29:52.040 --> 29:53.720
 And she was hyperthermic.

29:53.720 --> 29:56.680
 She was running against that reflex to stop.

29:56.680 --> 29:58.600
 So dumping heat is key.

29:58.600 --> 30:00.600
 So how do you dump heat

30:00.600 --> 30:04.600
 in order to perform longer safely?

30:04.600 --> 30:06.280
 Well, in order to understand that,

30:06.280 --> 30:07.840
 you have to understand that the body

30:07.840 --> 30:11.600
 has three main compartments for regulating temperature.

30:11.600 --> 30:13.680
 We don't just have a center and a periphery.

30:13.680 --> 30:15.400
 We have three main compartments.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.600
 And there's one compartment in particular

30:17.600 --> 30:22.400
 that all of you or most all of you, I have to assume have.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.360
 And if you can understand how that works,

30:25.360 --> 30:27.880
 you can do tremendous things for your performance

30:27.880 --> 30:29.600
 and for your recovery.

30:29.600 --> 30:31.660
 So what I'm about to tell you will allow you

30:31.660 --> 30:34.740
 to perform better in all forms of exercise.

30:34.740 --> 30:37.520
 And it is not commonly known, unfortunately.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.740
 I'm here to try and change that.

30:39.740 --> 30:41.080
 You have three compartments

30:41.080 --> 30:44.960
 for increasing or dumping heat in your body.

30:44.960 --> 30:46.420
 One is your core.

30:46.420 --> 30:48.140
 We already talked about that.

30:48.140 --> 30:49.860
 Your core organs, your heart, your lungs,

30:49.860 --> 30:54.000
 your pancreas, your liver, the core of your body.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.260
 The other is your periphery,

30:56.260 --> 30:58.680
 which are obviously your arms and your legs

30:58.680 --> 31:00.260
 and your feet and your hands.

31:00.260 --> 31:02.780
 But then there's a third component,

31:02.780 --> 31:06.080
 which is there are three locations on your body

31:06.080 --> 31:09.880
 that are far better at passing heat out of the body

31:09.880 --> 31:12.760
 and bringing cool into the body

31:12.760 --> 31:16.720
 such that you can heat up or cool your body

31:16.720 --> 31:19.280
 everywhere very quickly.

31:19.280 --> 31:22.760
 Those three areas are your face,

31:22.760 --> 31:26.680
 the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.780
 Now the skin on your hands and on the bottoms of your feet

31:29.780 --> 31:33.280
 and to some extent on your face are called glaborous skin.

31:33.280 --> 31:38.280
 That's G-L-A-B-O-R-O-U-S, glaborous skin.

31:39.040 --> 31:42.320
 And what's special about those areas of your body

31:42.320 --> 31:46.520
 and the glaborous skin is that the arrangement

31:46.520 --> 31:49.800
 of vasculature of blood vessels, capillaries

31:49.800 --> 31:51.920
 and arteries that serve those regions

31:51.920 --> 31:55.840
 is very different than it is elsewhere in your body.

31:55.840 --> 31:59.340
 Now this has ancient roots.

31:59.340 --> 32:01.720
 Typically, if you were another mammal

32:01.720 --> 32:04.720
 like a bear or some sort of ape,

32:04.720 --> 32:06.920
 you would have hair all over your body.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.720
 Now we all know some pretty hairy people

32:08.720 --> 32:11.060
 or presumably you've heard that there are these hairy people.

32:11.060 --> 32:14.240
 I know a few excessively hairy people

32:14.240 --> 32:15.720
 and Costello is excessively hairy

32:15.720 --> 32:17.900
 but he's not a person obviously.

32:17.900 --> 32:21.800
 But all mammals have hair on their bodies.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.260
 Just some people have very light hair or very fine hair.

32:26.780 --> 32:29.860
 We don't have hair on these glaborous skin regions.

32:29.860 --> 32:33.040
 Now, of course you can have beard or facial hair growth

32:33.040 --> 32:35.280
 but there are still regions like the cheeks

32:35.280 --> 32:38.720
 and other areas that maintain this special vasculature.

32:38.720 --> 32:41.840
 So technically the hands and feet are real glabrous skin

32:41.840 --> 32:45.820
 and the face is not always quite classified as glabrous

32:45.820 --> 32:47.000
 but these three locations,

32:47.000 --> 32:51.680
 face, palms of hands, not tops and bottoms of feet

32:51.680 --> 32:56.360
 are very good at dumping heat and bringing in cool.

32:56.360 --> 33:01.280
 And the reason is there's a rule in vascular biology

33:01.280 --> 33:04.880
 that blood moves from arteries to capillaries

33:04.880 --> 33:07.960
 and then to veins and then back to the heart.

33:07.960 --> 33:10.980
 So arteries, which are the big ones obviously,

33:10.980 --> 33:13.120
 capillaries, which are the little fine ones

33:13.120 --> 33:16.400
 where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged

33:16.400 --> 33:20.880
 and veins, which then bring blood back to the heart

33:20.880 --> 33:22.380
 and other tissues of course.

33:24.140 --> 33:27.920
 In these three regions of your hands, your face

33:27.920 --> 33:29.760
 and the bottoms of your feet,

33:29.760 --> 33:32.040
 we have what are called AVAs.

33:32.040 --> 33:36.400
 AVAs are a very special pattern of vasculature.

33:36.400 --> 33:38.920
 AVAs are described in the medical textbooks.

33:38.920 --> 33:41.720
 You can find them in Gray's Anatomy, not the television show

33:41.720 --> 33:44.240
 but the actual Gray's Anatomy textbook

33:44.240 --> 33:46.160
 which is a real thing that exists

33:46.160 --> 33:49.620
 and in all medical textbooks, okay?

33:49.620 --> 33:52.400
 So let's talk about AVAs and what they are

33:52.400 --> 33:54.980
 and why they allow these three regions of the body

33:54.980 --> 33:58.280
 to heat or cool ourselves more readily.

33:59.460 --> 34:01.760
 So what are AVAs?

34:01.760 --> 34:05.560
 AVAs are arteriovenous osteomoses.

34:05.560 --> 34:08.920
 So if you want to look that up, you can just look up AVAs,

34:08.920 --> 34:11.880
 veins, capillaries, arteries, if you like

34:11.880 --> 34:13.520
 but I'll spell it for you.

34:14.840 --> 34:19.840
 A-R-T-E-R-I-O, arteriovenous, V-E-N-O-U-S,

34:22.500 --> 34:27.500
 arteriovenous anastomoses, A-N-A-S-T-O-M-O-S-E-S.

34:30.080 --> 34:32.520
 Arteriovenous osteomoses, okay?

34:32.520 --> 34:36.640
 You want to know about arteriovenous osteomoses, trust me.

34:36.640 --> 34:39.120
 And you want to remember that they are in your hands,

34:39.120 --> 34:41.340
 the bottoms of your feet and on your face

34:41.340 --> 34:43.340
 and in particular on the palms of your hands,

34:43.340 --> 34:44.720
 not the tops of your hands.

34:44.720 --> 34:47.760
 Now, before I said blood flows typically

34:47.760 --> 34:49.820
 from arteries to capillaries to veins

34:49.820 --> 34:51.400
 and then back to the heart

34:51.400 --> 34:53.620
 but AVAs are direct connections

34:53.620 --> 34:56.620
 between the small arteries and the small veins.

34:56.620 --> 35:00.040
 They bypass the capillaries to some extent.

35:00.040 --> 35:02.360
 They're little short vessel segments.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.240
 They have a big large inner diameter

35:05.240 --> 35:08.260
 and they have this very thick muscular wall

35:08.260 --> 35:12.200
 and they get input from what are called adrenergic neurons.

35:12.200 --> 35:15.760
 They get input from neurons that release norepinephrine

35:15.760 --> 35:20.040
 and epinephrine, which allows them to contract or dilate.

35:20.040 --> 35:21.920
 Now there's some rules of physics that talk

35:21.920 --> 35:24.500
 about how the radius of a pipe

35:24.500 --> 35:27.320
 and small changes in the radius of a pipe

35:27.320 --> 35:31.140
 leads to massive increases in the rate

35:31.140 --> 35:35.280
 and amount of stuff that can flow through that pipe, okay?

35:35.280 --> 35:37.220
 That's a rule of physics that says essentially

35:37.220 --> 35:40.200
 that the radius is proportional

35:40.200 --> 35:42.360
 to the amount of stuff that can flow

35:42.360 --> 35:44.440
 through something to the fourth power.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.920
 We're not going to make this a physics class

35:45.920 --> 35:47.960
 but if you want to look that up, you can.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.420
 You can just look up how does the radius of a tube

35:50.420 --> 35:52.120
 or a pipe relate to how quickly

35:52.120 --> 35:54.840
 or how much stuff can flow through it.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.340
 What you need to know,

35:56.340 --> 35:58.200
 even if you don't want to know any of the underlying physics

35:58.200 --> 36:02.700
 is that these AVAs allow more heat to leave the body

36:02.700 --> 36:07.360
 more quickly and more cool to enter the body more quickly

36:07.360 --> 36:12.360
 than other venous arterial capillary beds

36:12.880 --> 36:13.720
 throughout the body.

36:13.720 --> 36:16.840
 In other words, you can heat up best at the face,

36:16.840 --> 36:18.800
 the palms and the bottoms of the feet

36:18.800 --> 36:22.740
 and you can cool down best at the face, the palms

36:22.740 --> 36:23.600
 and the bottoms of the feet

36:23.600 --> 36:25.680
 than you can anywhere else on your body.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.120
 When I say heat up or cool down,

36:27.120 --> 36:31.760
 I mean actually heat or cool the core and your brain, okay?

36:31.760 --> 36:33.180
 So this is vitally important.

36:33.180 --> 36:35.600
 I realize we're getting down into the mechanistic weeds here

36:35.600 --> 36:38.360
 but you need to know that these three compartments

36:38.360 --> 36:40.560
 of your body, palms, bottoms of feet

36:40.560 --> 36:44.400
 and face are your best leverage points

36:44.400 --> 36:46.120
 for manipulating temperature

36:46.120 --> 36:50.280
 to vastly improve physical performance, okay?

36:50.280 --> 36:52.960
 I also want to point out that the work

36:52.960 --> 36:54.280
 that I'm going to tell you about

36:54.280 --> 36:55.920
 is not work from my laboratory.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.440
 It's the work of, as I mentioned,

36:57.440 --> 37:00.180
 my colleague Craig Heller's laboratory at Stanford

37:00.180 --> 37:02.360
 and we're going to have Craig on as a guest

37:02.360 --> 37:04.660
 to talk more about these discoveries.

37:04.660 --> 37:07.240
 They are his and his colleagues discoveries

37:08.400 --> 37:09.700
 and how you can leverage them.

37:09.700 --> 37:12.340
 They're building out some amazing technology.

37:12.340 --> 37:14.500
 I had a conversation with Craig yesterday

37:14.500 --> 37:17.080
 as a prelude to this episode

37:17.080 --> 37:19.240
 and to the future conversation with him.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.740
 So you're getting the very latest on this topic.

37:22.740 --> 37:24.680
 So what Craig and his colleagues did

37:24.680 --> 37:26.560
 really illustrates perfectly

37:26.560 --> 37:29.560
 what these body surfaces can do and why.

37:30.680 --> 37:35.080
 They were studying overheating in athletes

37:35.080 --> 37:38.160
 and in military and in construction workers

37:38.160 --> 37:39.980
 and trying to prevent it.

37:39.980 --> 37:41.660
 And they did a bunch of experiments.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.320
 I won't go into all of them now

37:43.320 --> 37:47.160
 but what they essentially found was that cooling the palms,

37:47.160 --> 37:51.940
 Palmer cooling allowed people, athletes

37:51.940 --> 37:56.000
 and recreational athletes to run much further,

37:56.000 --> 37:59.680
 to lift more weight and to do more sets and reps

37:59.680 --> 38:02.780
 to a absolutely staggering degree.

38:04.680 --> 38:09.160
 Let's talk for a second a bit more about why we stop,

38:09.160 --> 38:13.620
 why we shut off effort when we get too hot.

38:13.620 --> 38:16.280
 Because in doing so you'll really understand

38:16.280 --> 38:18.920
 how and why the best protocols exist

38:18.920 --> 38:21.040
 for being able to do more work,

38:21.040 --> 38:23.760
 to be able to exercise longer

38:23.760 --> 38:25.400
 and actually to feel good doing it.

38:25.400 --> 38:28.080
 You actually can make a doubling of your dips

38:28.080 --> 38:30.320
 or believe it or not a tripling or quadrupling

38:30.320 --> 38:33.560
 or more of your pull-ups fairly straightforward.

38:34.760 --> 38:37.920
 I mentioned before that when muscle heats up

38:39.220 --> 38:41.880
 enzymes start getting disrupted

38:41.880 --> 38:44.840
 and ATP and muscles can't work so well

38:44.840 --> 38:46.640
 and those muscles can't contract.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.440
 Let's get a little more specific about that.

38:48.440 --> 38:50.480
 The enzyme that's involved here

38:50.480 --> 38:52.680
 is something called pyruvate kinase.

38:52.680 --> 38:54.360
 You don't need to know about pyruvate kinase

38:54.360 --> 38:56.640
 but what you do need to know is that it ends ASE

38:56.640 --> 38:58.840
 which means it's an enzyme

38:58.840 --> 39:03.840
 and pyruvate kinase is essentially a rate limiting step.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.120
 It's a critical step that you can't bypass

39:07.120 --> 39:08.480
 if you want muscles to contract

39:08.480 --> 39:10.440
 and it's very temperature sensitive.

39:12.800 --> 39:16.280
 Therefore, if you can keep temperature lower

39:16.280 --> 39:19.080
 you can do more work per unit time.

39:19.080 --> 39:20.760
 You can do more pull-ups

39:20.760 --> 39:23.960
 and that actually was done by Craig and his colleagues.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.000
 Excuse me, the pull-ups weren't actually done by Craig.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.360
 I don't know how many pull-ups Craig can do.

39:27.360 --> 39:29.960
 I'll ask him next time, both cooled and uncooled

39:29.960 --> 39:31.640
 how many pull-ups he can do.

39:31.640 --> 39:33.280
 But what they essentially did

39:33.280 --> 39:36.040
 is they brought someone into their laboratory

39:36.040 --> 39:39.380
 who could do 10 pull-ups on the first set

39:39.380 --> 39:42.260
 and they were able to get 10 rest two or three minutes,

39:42.260 --> 39:44.080
 get another 10 rest two or three minutes

39:44.080 --> 39:45.000
 and if you've ever tried this

39:45.000 --> 39:46.420
 what you find is that you start dropping

39:46.420 --> 39:49.320
 to eight, seven, six, et cetera.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.880
 Now the person might not necessarily feel

39:51.880 --> 39:55.340
 like they're overheating, but the muscle is heating up.

39:55.340 --> 39:59.240
 Then with their knowledge that these AVAs,

39:59.240 --> 40:02.960
 that these portals in the palms

40:02.960 --> 40:05.880
 are a great way to both heat the body

40:05.880 --> 40:08.360
 but also to dump heat from the body,

40:08.360 --> 40:10.080
 they used a device

40:10.080 --> 40:12.120
 and I'll talk about what you can do at home

40:12.120 --> 40:14.600
 but a device where they had people hold on

40:14.600 --> 40:18.400
 to what was essentially a cold tube.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.340
 Now this is crucial.

40:20.340 --> 40:24.360
 The tube can't be so cold that it causes vasoconstriction

40:24.360 --> 40:27.280
 because then the cold won't pass from the tube

40:27.280 --> 40:29.080
 to the hand and to the core.

40:30.080 --> 40:32.160
 But if it's the right temperature,

40:32.160 --> 40:34.800
 it's neither too hot nor too cold,

40:34.800 --> 40:39.800
 that cool from the cold tube passes into the hand,

40:40.020 --> 40:44.360
 these so-called palmar regions and then cools the core

40:44.360 --> 40:47.040
 and in theory, by lowering body temperature

40:47.040 --> 40:50.320
 would allow the person or the athlete to do more work

40:50.320 --> 40:51.920
 and indeed that's what they saw.

40:53.100 --> 40:55.760
 The actual data, the specific data showed

40:55.760 --> 40:57.200
 that subjects could do,

40:57.200 --> 40:58.640
 at least the subjects they worked with

40:58.640 --> 41:00.920
 on their first day with no cooling,

41:00.920 --> 41:02.280
 about a hundred pull-ups

41:02.280 --> 41:06.600
 across the timeframe that they had, okay?

41:06.600 --> 41:10.000
 So it might've taken anywhere from 10 to 15

41:10.000 --> 41:13.120
 or maybe more sets depending on how skilled that person was

41:13.120 --> 41:14.880
 but in a fixed amount of time.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.280
 Then they came back and did the cooling.

41:18.280 --> 41:19.640
 They did it the very next day,

41:19.640 --> 41:22.840
 which if you've ever trained a muscle the very next day,

41:22.840 --> 41:25.960
 typically you wouldn't do as well in its training

41:25.960 --> 41:27.920
 if it took any damage from the previous session

41:27.920 --> 41:29.080
 or you at least do as well

41:29.080 --> 41:32.160
 but you probably wouldn't do what they then observed

41:32.160 --> 41:34.720
 which was they started cooling after every other set.

41:34.720 --> 41:37.160
 The person would just hold the cold tube,

41:37.160 --> 41:39.680
 cool down the body after every other set,

41:39.680 --> 41:42.080
 rest, everything else was kept the same

41:42.080 --> 41:45.540
 and they found that they went to 180 pull-ups

41:45.540 --> 41:48.080
 which is incredible, it's a near doubling.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.960
 And by doing this repeatedly over several sessions,

41:50.960 --> 41:55.040
 over several weeks, they quickly went in the cooling group

41:55.040 --> 41:58.240
 from a maximum of somewhere between 180 and 200

41:58.240 --> 42:00.200
 as I recall I'm sort of estimating now

42:00.200 --> 42:03.560
 to 600 pull-ups in the equivalent amount of time

42:03.560 --> 42:06.080
 which is absolutely incredible.

42:06.080 --> 42:09.520
 They then repeated this in a study on the bench press

42:09.520 --> 42:11.680
 and actually the bench press study was pretty interesting

42:11.680 --> 42:13.620
 because they actually had a control group

42:13.620 --> 42:16.920
 that was admittedly taking specific amounts

42:16.920 --> 42:17.960
 of anabolic steroids.

42:17.960 --> 42:20.600
 The anabolic steroid was testosterone sipinate

42:20.600 --> 42:23.400
 which is essentially testosterone

42:23.400 --> 42:25.400
 and indeed the testosterone sipinate,

42:25.400 --> 42:30.240
 the steroid group improved at a rate of about 1% per week.

42:30.240 --> 42:32.840
 In other words, there were differences

42:32.840 --> 42:36.780
 and the cooling group basically left all other groups

42:36.780 --> 42:38.680
 in the dust, it was just remarkable.

42:38.680 --> 42:41.580
 So cooling the core, I want to be very clear

42:41.580 --> 42:42.880
 that it's not cooling the muscle,

42:42.880 --> 42:44.720
 it wasn't about cooling the chest alone

42:44.720 --> 42:46.360
 or just cooling the palms.

42:46.360 --> 42:49.700
 It was about allowing cold to pass through the palms

42:49.700 --> 42:52.920
 because of the unique vasculature that's there,

42:52.920 --> 42:55.880
 these AVAs allowed these subjects

42:55.880 --> 42:58.600
 to do far more work per unit time.

42:58.600 --> 43:02.620
 And the important thing is that if they were to come back

43:02.620 --> 43:05.700
 after doing 600 pull-ups or 500 pull-ups,

43:05.700 --> 43:08.400
 you might say, well, wow, that's going to create a situation

43:08.400 --> 43:11.600
 where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible.

43:11.600 --> 43:13.640
 They could come back, not use the cooling

43:13.640 --> 43:16.180
 and they still saw a highly significant increase

43:16.180 --> 43:19.040
 in the amount or the number of pull-ups or dips

43:19.040 --> 43:21.840
 or bench press weight that they could do, okay?

43:21.840 --> 43:23.280
 So what that meant is that it was both

43:23.280 --> 43:27.120
 an excellent performance and an excellent training stimulus

43:27.120 --> 43:29.820
 that they were able to recover from, okay?

43:29.820 --> 43:31.360
 I don't know if all of you are following this

43:31.360 --> 43:35.280
 but these are the sorts of increases in exercise output

43:35.280 --> 43:37.120
 that are absolutely staggering

43:37.120 --> 43:39.000
 and that's why professional teams

43:39.000 --> 43:41.960
 and the military and others capitalized

43:41.960 --> 43:44.720
 on them very quickly and use these, okay?

43:44.720 --> 43:49.680
 Now you may be asking, what about endurance, right?

43:49.680 --> 43:52.440
 Not everyone wants to be able to bench press a lot

43:52.440 --> 43:54.060
 for multiple reps and sets.

43:55.040 --> 43:56.880
 And I should just mention for the bench pressing,

43:56.880 --> 43:58.680
 it was, I believe they found people

43:58.680 --> 44:01.820
 that could bench press 225, so that's two 45 pound plates

44:01.820 --> 44:03.960
 on the 45 pound standard Olympic bar

44:03.960 --> 44:05.880
 for repetitions of anywhere from six to 10

44:05.880 --> 44:07.080
 and then they had them do the same thing.

44:07.080 --> 44:09.360
 They did a set, they'd rest two or three minutes,

44:09.360 --> 44:11.360
 sometimes up to four minutes, then do another set,

44:11.360 --> 44:13.560
 repeat, repeat, repeat, and with cooling,

44:13.560 --> 44:16.400
 they were able to increase the amount of work,

44:16.400 --> 44:19.080
 the number of reps with the same weight,

44:19.080 --> 44:21.340
 sometimes they did have to increase sets

44:21.340 --> 44:25.240
 to approximately double, so it's pretty fantastic.

44:25.240 --> 44:29.880
 So with endurance, similar increases have been shown

44:29.880 --> 44:32.280
 and the way that they would do those tests

44:32.280 --> 44:34.160
 are a little bit different and they also point

44:34.160 --> 44:38.040
 to a really important mechanism of why we stop doing work

44:38.040 --> 44:41.480
 at all when we perceive that we are putting

44:41.480 --> 44:43.480
 in too much effort, so it gets right to the heart

44:43.480 --> 44:46.360
 of the relationship between temperature and muscle

44:46.360 --> 44:49.320
 and your willpower, those are directly related.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.880
 Your body heat and your willpower

44:51.880 --> 44:54.000
 are linked in a physiological way,

44:54.000 --> 44:55.280
 so I'm not talking about the kind of stuff

44:55.280 --> 44:57.180
 that you see as kind of like clickbait on the internet

44:57.180 --> 45:00.720
 or like increase willpower now or become resilient now

45:00.720 --> 45:03.020
 or never do this again if you want to be mentally strong,

45:03.020 --> 45:05.560
 I'm talking about a physiological mechanism

45:05.560 --> 45:09.000
 that exists in the body and brain that causes you to stop

45:09.000 --> 45:12.000
 or that will allow you to continue to go harder

45:12.000 --> 45:14.400
 and further than you normally would.

45:14.400 --> 45:16.780
 Okay, so let's talk about willpower and heat

45:16.780 --> 45:20.480
 and how heat shuts you down, in other words,

45:20.480 --> 45:23.120
 if you are cool, if your body temperature

45:23.120 --> 45:26.360
 is in a particular range, not only can you go further

45:26.360 --> 45:29.080
 but you will go further if you want to.

45:29.080 --> 45:34.080
 I said differently, if you heat up too much,

45:34.400 --> 45:38.360
 you will stop or you will die, typically people stop.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.200
 There are individuals who will push to the point

45:40.200 --> 45:42.720
 where they black out and die in the same way that,

45:42.720 --> 45:44.520
 and please don't do this experiment,

45:45.760 --> 45:48.520
 there are people who can sit down face to face

45:48.520 --> 45:50.040
 and say, let's hold our breath

45:50.040 --> 45:53.480
 and whoever breathes first loses.

45:53.480 --> 45:55.640
 Some people will just go until it's painful

45:55.640 --> 45:58.120
 and then they'll gasp and take a big breath.

45:58.120 --> 45:59.360
 There are always those individuals

45:59.360 --> 46:01.160
 who can override that reflex

46:01.160 --> 46:03.880
 and they will go until they pass out, okay?

46:03.880 --> 46:06.520
 And if you do that in water, you can very easily die.

46:06.520 --> 46:09.120
 So please don't do that experiment.

46:09.120 --> 46:14.120
 But there's a reflex that relates the body to the brain

46:14.400 --> 46:17.220
 and the brain to the body that shuts off our effort

46:17.220 --> 46:18.920
 when we get too hot.

46:18.920 --> 46:21.920
 So what Craig and his colleagues and now others have done

46:21.920 --> 46:23.520
 is to do a test in the laboratory

46:23.520 --> 46:26.460
 where rather than ask people to run outside

46:26.460 --> 46:29.620
 until they absolutely don't want to run anymore,

46:29.620 --> 46:32.600
 you put them on a treadmill and you set the speed, okay?

46:32.600 --> 46:34.560
 So they have to keep up with the treadmill

46:34.560 --> 46:36.580
 and at some point they quit.

46:38.100 --> 46:41.200
 And you take groups and you do those

46:41.200 --> 46:44.260
 in different temperature environments.

46:44.260 --> 46:48.360
 So some people are running in a nice chilly laboratory,

46:48.360 --> 46:49.400
 they get their heart rate up

46:49.400 --> 46:53.400
 so maybe their heart rate goes from 40 or 50

46:53.400 --> 46:56.080
 baseline heart rate, maybe it gets up to 80 or 100

46:56.080 --> 46:59.760
 and then they keep the rate of the treadmill going the same

46:59.760 --> 47:00.800
 and they will just plateau.

47:00.800 --> 47:03.480
 So they'll get into a steady state cadence or rhythm

47:03.480 --> 47:05.600
 and their heart is beating at more or less a steady state.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.240
 Eventually they'll probably stop

47:07.240 --> 47:08.880
 because they have something else to do

47:08.880 --> 47:13.880
 but people will continue at that temperature

47:13.920 --> 47:15.760
 and at that heart rate

47:15.760 --> 47:18.800
 unless you start turning up the temperature in the room.

47:18.800 --> 47:20.920
 And at some point they will stop

47:20.920 --> 47:24.020
 and they'll stop much earlier when it gets hot

47:24.020 --> 47:27.040
 because of something called cardiac drift, okay?

47:27.040 --> 47:28.680
 So let's say I'm running

47:28.680 --> 47:31.280
 and I'm running at a steady cadence on this treadmill

47:31.280 --> 47:33.220
 and my heart rate is 85 beats per minute

47:33.220 --> 47:34.680
 or 100 beats per minute, doesn't matter.

47:34.680 --> 47:37.440
 Let's say 100 just for sake of example.

47:37.440 --> 47:39.640
 Well, just making the room hotter

47:39.640 --> 47:42.380
 is going to increase my heart rate further

47:42.380 --> 47:44.760
 even though I'm at the same output.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.180
 And the brain does a computation,

47:48.180 --> 47:51.600
 it somehow figures out that there's a heat component

47:51.600 --> 47:52.820
 that's increasing heart rate

47:52.820 --> 47:55.160
 and there's an effort component from running

47:55.160 --> 47:56.720
 that's driving heart rate.

47:56.720 --> 47:58.200
 And if the heat component

47:58.200 --> 48:01.120
 and the heart rate output from the effort

48:01.120 --> 48:04.840
 get to hit a certain threshold, I stop, okay?

48:04.840 --> 48:06.200
 And some of you may think, well,

48:06.200 --> 48:08.180
 there are people who just run and run and run

48:08.180 --> 48:11.340
 and never stop, eventually everyone stops.

48:11.340 --> 48:12.600
 Maybe it's because the race ended,

48:12.600 --> 48:15.060
 maybe it's because everyone else quit.

48:15.060 --> 48:16.860
 I actually saw some stuff online,

48:16.860 --> 48:19.040
 there are these races where people just will continuously

48:19.040 --> 48:21.240
 do the same loop until everyone else drops out

48:21.240 --> 48:25.380
 and then one guy or gal keeps going past everybody.

48:25.380 --> 48:27.520
 But typically it stops because the race is over

48:27.520 --> 48:29.160
 or because people quit.

48:29.160 --> 48:33.600
 Increasing temperature increases the rate of quitting

48:33.600 --> 48:35.200
 in part, not entirely,

48:35.200 --> 48:38.160
 but in part because of this thing called cardiac drift,

48:38.160 --> 48:40.100
 which you've probably experienced

48:40.100 --> 48:42.200
 if you've been out on a hot day and you're walking uphill,

48:42.200 --> 48:44.120
 you might stop to take a breath.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.720
 If you sit in a sauna, your heart rate will increase.

48:46.720 --> 48:48.820
 Heat increases heart rate,

48:48.820 --> 48:51.960
 effort increases heart rate at a steady effort,

48:51.960 --> 48:55.300
 you'll have a steady heart rate if you increase the heat

48:55.300 --> 48:57.680
 in the environment that you're engaging

48:57.680 --> 48:58.880
 in that steady heart rate,

48:58.880 --> 49:01.800
 your heart rate will now go up due to cardiac drift

49:01.800 --> 49:03.980
 and you will quit, okay?

49:03.980 --> 49:07.200
 So Heller and colleagues have done experiments

49:07.200 --> 49:10.920
 where they do Palmer cooling under these environments.

49:10.920 --> 49:15.240
 And that's wonderful because not only does it enable people

49:15.240 --> 49:20.240
 to go further and faster for much longer,

49:20.320 --> 49:23.680
 that's been shown statistically significant every time,

49:23.680 --> 49:26.060
 but it also protects the brain and body

49:26.060 --> 49:29.600
 against hyperthermia, overheating, coma, nerve injury,

49:29.600 --> 49:32.720
 nerve death, and actual death, okay?

49:32.720 --> 49:35.680
 So you can see why this is such a valuable tool.

49:35.680 --> 49:37.680
 So what are they doing?

49:37.680 --> 49:41.820
 Well, in this case too, they're having them cool their hands

49:41.820 --> 49:43.380
 and they're cooling the palms.

49:43.380 --> 49:45.660
 Cooling the bottoms of the feet is a little trickier,

49:45.660 --> 49:48.240
 but cooling the face could actually work as well.

49:48.240 --> 49:49.640
 And we're going to talk about cooling the face

49:49.640 --> 49:51.200
 and how to incorporate this.

49:51.200 --> 49:53.500
 So at this point, I've just really wanted

49:53.500 --> 49:58.500
 to impress upon you, not impress you, but impress upon you,

49:58.560 --> 50:01.160
 the fact that you have these three surfaces of your body

50:01.160 --> 50:04.280
 that are very good at passing cold into the body

50:04.280 --> 50:06.520
 such that it cools the core body temperature.

50:06.520 --> 50:09.840
 And that's a good thing for health and safety

50:09.840 --> 50:14.080
 and in order to maintain work output over longer periods

50:14.080 --> 50:16.080
 of time, or actually just do more work.

50:16.080 --> 50:18.100
 I mean, to me, the result is just so staggering

50:18.100 --> 50:21.400
 is the 100 to 180 pull-ups in the controls

50:21.400 --> 50:25.960
 and then 600 pull-ups in the cooled individuals, right?

50:25.960 --> 50:30.120
 They actually also feel mentally as if they can do more work.

50:30.120 --> 50:34.040
 It's not just that they can, their willpower is adjusted

50:34.040 --> 50:36.820
 somehow by these shifts in temperature.

50:36.820 --> 50:39.960
 Now, before we continue and get to the exact ways

50:39.960 --> 50:43.520
 that any number of us can start to use this information,

50:43.520 --> 50:47.120
 I want to talk about the opposite thing, which is heating.

50:47.120 --> 50:50.420
 And you have to remember that these surfaces,

50:50.420 --> 50:52.640
 the palms and the bottoms of the feet and the face

50:52.640 --> 50:55.800
 were not just arranged with these AVAs,

50:55.800 --> 51:00.800
 these special ways to pass blood from arteries to veins

51:01.520 --> 51:04.320
 in order to cool us for better athletic performance

51:04.320 --> 51:09.200
 or to heat us on cold days, but for both of those things.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.880
 Now, Heller and colleagues and others have also explored

51:12.880 --> 51:16.080
 how these can be used to heat up the core.

51:16.080 --> 51:19.240
 There are times when we want to heat up our core.

51:19.240 --> 51:22.500
 Typically, we hear that most of the heat escapes

51:22.500 --> 51:25.740
 through our head, so we'll put on a hat when we go outside.

51:25.740 --> 51:27.880
 That's actually not true.

51:27.880 --> 51:30.480
 Most of your heat escapes through your face,

51:30.480 --> 51:33.320
 the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet.

51:33.320 --> 51:35.400
 Now, you should know why that's the case.

51:36.400 --> 51:40.800
 What this means is that for post-surgery patients

51:40.800 --> 51:43.240
 or for people that are hypothermic,

51:43.240 --> 51:45.540
 indeed, you want to heat the core, right?

51:45.540 --> 51:47.800
 But actually, I was on a swim recently

51:47.800 --> 51:50.120
 where a friend became hypothermic.

51:50.120 --> 51:52.040
 He was kind of slurring his words

51:52.040 --> 51:53.200
 and kind of staggering around

51:53.200 --> 51:54.920
 when we got him back on the beach.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.880
 We brought him over to the lifeguard station.

51:56.880 --> 51:57.880
 He turned out to be fine.

51:57.880 --> 51:59.600
 Again, this is why cold water swims

51:59.600 --> 52:01.460
 are something that you really need to do in groups,

52:01.460 --> 52:04.120
 not alone, and you really have to know what you're doing.

52:04.120 --> 52:07.980
 There were reasons for why this happened that day,

52:07.980 --> 52:11.000
 but basically, people thought we were a little strange

52:11.000 --> 52:12.520
 until they realized what was happening.

52:12.520 --> 52:13.520
 We were walking down the beach,

52:13.520 --> 52:16.180
 basically sandwiching him at our chest

52:16.180 --> 52:19.320
 because we were still warmer than the ambient environment,

52:19.320 --> 52:20.320
 the environment around us,

52:20.320 --> 52:23.120
 and we were pushing our chest against him

52:23.120 --> 52:25.480
 to try and warm him up to warm up his core.

52:25.480 --> 52:28.180
 In retrospect, that was the wrong thing to do.

52:28.180 --> 52:30.840
 In talking with Craig and talking to other colleagues

52:30.840 --> 52:33.000
 that work on thermogenesis,

52:33.000 --> 52:36.320
 what we should have done was warm the palms of his hands,

52:36.320 --> 52:38.760
 the bottoms of his feet, and his face

52:38.760 --> 52:41.640
 because that would insulate the heat loss.

52:41.640 --> 52:42.860
 Now, he was very cold,

52:42.860 --> 52:45.400
 so presumably, there was vasoconstriction

52:45.400 --> 52:47.880
 of the veins at these locations,

52:47.880 --> 52:49.680
 and so it's not clear

52:49.680 --> 52:51.780
 that that would have been the only strategy to use,

52:51.780 --> 52:56.120
 but they have explored how to heat up post-surgery patients,

52:56.120 --> 52:57.520
 and one of the best ways to do that

52:57.520 --> 53:00.080
 is to get warm socks on the bottoms of the feet,

53:00.080 --> 53:01.400
 get gloves on the hands,

53:01.400 --> 53:03.560
 and if it can be done safely, to warm the face.

53:03.560 --> 53:05.480
 Now, of course, you don't want to obstruct respiration

53:05.480 --> 53:06.920
 and things of that sort,

53:06.920 --> 53:11.360
 but again, the ability to pass heat into the body

53:11.360 --> 53:12.900
 or to remove heat to the body

53:12.900 --> 53:15.400
 is best done through these three surfaces.

53:15.400 --> 53:17.280
 I can't emphasize that enough.

53:17.280 --> 53:20.840
 So I mentioned before that you want to cool the palms

53:20.840 --> 53:21.920
 or the bottoms of the feet,

53:21.920 --> 53:23.660
 although that's a little harder to do, or the face,

53:23.660 --> 53:28.000
 but not so much that the blood vessels constrict

53:28.000 --> 53:30.400
 because then you won't be able to pass cool into the body

53:30.400 --> 53:32.680
 because those pipes got smaller,

53:32.680 --> 53:35.760
 and therefore, you can't pass cool into the body.

53:35.760 --> 53:37.660
 So how can you start to incorporate this?

53:37.660 --> 53:40.380
 Well, Craig and colleagues have a company

53:40.380 --> 53:43.080
 that they've spun out through Stanford.

53:43.080 --> 53:45.180
 We'll talk about that when we sit down with Craig,

53:45.180 --> 53:49.280
 that has made engineered devices that are optimal for this

53:49.280 --> 53:52.640
 that are going to keep those passages open,

53:52.640 --> 53:55.040
 keep the size of those veins correct

53:55.040 --> 53:56.820
 to pass cool into the body quickly

53:56.820 --> 53:58.320
 for sake of elite sports performance

53:58.320 --> 54:00.180
 and even recreational sports performance,

54:00.180 --> 54:02.720
 but you can actually start to incorporate this.

54:02.720 --> 54:05.720
 First of all, I always get asked,

54:05.720 --> 54:07.140
 how cold should the water be?

54:07.140 --> 54:08.600
 Should it be ice water?

54:08.600 --> 54:10.760
 Should it be very cold water?

54:10.760 --> 54:12.000
 The answer is no.

54:13.400 --> 54:15.740
 If you want to experience some of this effect

54:15.740 --> 54:16.920
 without a device,

54:16.920 --> 54:19.760
 one thing you could do would be, for instance, to do,

54:19.760 --> 54:22.160
 I don't know, I'll use the gym or the treadmill

54:22.160 --> 54:23.000
 as an example.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.720
 You could do your maximum number of pull-ups,

54:25.720 --> 54:29.960
 stop, and then you could actually put your hands into

54:29.960 --> 54:34.920
 or on the surface of a sink that is presumably stopped up

54:34.920 --> 54:37.240
 with cool water.

54:37.240 --> 54:42.120
 So not ice water, not freezing cold, but cool water.

54:42.120 --> 54:45.400
 Slightly cooler than body temperature

54:45.400 --> 54:48.960
 before you started training would be a good place to start.

54:48.960 --> 54:50.860
 You do that for 10 to 30 seconds,

54:51.720 --> 54:54.180
 then you could go back and do your next set.

54:54.180 --> 54:55.680
 You would repeat the cooling.

54:55.680 --> 54:57.980
 You would want to extend the amount of cooling somewhat,

54:57.980 --> 55:00.680
 so you might want to do that for 30 seconds to a minute.

55:00.680 --> 55:01.780
 This is not going to be perfect.

55:01.780 --> 55:04.620
 You're going to have to play with how cold to make it

55:04.620 --> 55:06.600
 in order to get the optimal effect,

55:06.600 --> 55:09.440
 but you ought to see an effect nonetheless.

55:09.440 --> 55:12.880
 The same is true if you're running and you're fatiguing.

55:12.880 --> 55:15.320
 Obviously, you don't want to become hyperthermic.

55:15.320 --> 55:18.840
 Cooling the hands or the bottoms of your feet or the face

55:18.840 --> 55:20.640
 would be the ideal way to dump heat

55:20.640 --> 55:23.760
 in order to be able to generate more output.

55:23.760 --> 55:26.120
 Now, the face is something that we haven't talked

55:26.120 --> 55:27.600
 a lot about.

55:27.600 --> 55:29.620
 Everything I've told you up until now also says

55:29.620 --> 55:31.800
 that if you are somebody who tends to get cold

55:31.800 --> 55:34.240
 when you are outside, say in the winter,

55:34.240 --> 55:37.000
 or even in the fall, you tend to run cold,

55:37.000 --> 55:39.560
 warming your face is going to be the most important thing

55:39.560 --> 55:40.820
 that you can do.

55:40.820 --> 55:43.240
 Now, it's kind of hard to do that without looking strange,

55:43.240 --> 55:45.280
 like wearing a ski mask or something like that,

55:45.280 --> 55:47.320
 but that is going to be more effective

55:47.320 --> 55:50.500
 than covering and warming any other part of your body,

55:50.500 --> 55:51.580
 although it would be quite strange

55:51.580 --> 55:52.920
 if you only had a ski mask on

55:52.920 --> 55:54.900
 and you weren't wearing clothes anywhere else on your body.

55:54.900 --> 55:56.940
 I don't recommend doing that outside.

55:56.940 --> 55:59.200
 That will get you into all sorts of other kinds of trouble.

55:59.200 --> 56:00.920
 It wouldn't be good for anybody.

56:00.920 --> 56:04.500
 But now you understand the principle and the locations

56:04.500 --> 56:06.640
 at which to deliver heat and cold.

56:06.640 --> 56:09.720
 So let's say that you are out for a run

56:09.720 --> 56:12.360
 and you want to incorporate this cooling mechanism.

56:12.360 --> 56:13.460
 I talked to Craig about this.

56:13.460 --> 56:16.720
 I said, what would be the kind of poor person's approach

56:16.720 --> 56:19.160
 to this before this device is commercially available?

56:19.160 --> 56:24.160
 And he said, well, you could take a frozen juice can,

56:24.320 --> 56:26.980
 if you have one of those, or a very cold can of soda,

56:26.980 --> 56:29.960
 and you would want to pass it back and forth

56:29.960 --> 56:31.640
 between your two hands.

56:31.640 --> 56:34.320
 The reason the passing back and forth is really important

56:34.320 --> 56:36.400
 is because you, again, you don't want it to be so cold

56:36.400 --> 56:40.240
 that you constrict those venous portals

56:40.240 --> 56:43.280
 that will allow cold to go into the body.

56:43.280 --> 56:45.600
 Now, there are certainly people

56:45.600 --> 56:47.320
 that are working on bike handles

56:47.320 --> 56:49.720
 and that can actually cool the hands.

56:49.720 --> 56:51.360
 You can expect with the Olympics coming up,

56:51.360 --> 56:52.960
 people are aware of these data

56:52.960 --> 56:55.540
 and are starting to incorporate it into a number of things.

56:55.540 --> 56:57.280
 Here's what you don't want to do.

56:57.280 --> 56:59.220
 And there are sports teams that I won't mention

56:59.220 --> 57:01.320
 by name or brand that have made this mistake

57:01.320 --> 57:02.920
 and it costs them dearly.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.320
 You don't want to cool the core

57:06.320 --> 57:09.220
 if you want to cool the body, right?

57:09.220 --> 57:11.660
 If it's a very hot day and you're going to train,

57:11.660 --> 57:13.280
 getting into an ice bath first,

57:13.280 --> 57:16.460
 sure, it will cool you down,

57:16.460 --> 57:18.680
 but that's not going to be as effective

57:18.680 --> 57:21.700
 as cooling the palms, the bottoms, the feet and the face.

57:22.840 --> 57:26.440
 I have a friend who does some important work in this space

57:26.440 --> 57:29.140
 with people in various, let's just say cultures

57:29.140 --> 57:31.040
 where heat is generated quite a lot

57:31.040 --> 57:32.200
 and they need to dump heat.

57:32.200 --> 57:34.440
 Ice packs delivered to the face

57:34.440 --> 57:36.160
 are something that they actually use

57:36.160 --> 57:38.000
 in order to dump heat quickly.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.880
 Now, again, you don't want to keep the ice pack on your face.

57:40.880 --> 57:43.720
 These are people that are very high work output, right?

57:43.720 --> 57:47.460
 Firefighters and similar at very high work output.

57:47.460 --> 57:49.080
 And then they'll put this,

57:49.080 --> 57:53.040
 essentially it's like a cool face mask on their face.

57:53.040 --> 57:54.860
 It'll allow their core body temperature to come down

57:54.860 --> 57:55.700
 and then they remove it.

57:55.700 --> 57:57.080
 They're not keeping it on there so long

57:57.080 --> 57:59.800
 that they're getting the vasoconstriction, okay?

57:59.800 --> 58:02.040
 So there are a number of ways that you could do this.

58:02.040 --> 58:04.740
 And again, I'm not giving specific temperatures

58:04.740 --> 58:06.200
 because it depends on how hot that day

58:06.200 --> 58:07.620
 and how hot your body temperature is.

58:07.620 --> 58:08.720
 So you can see why there's a need

58:08.720 --> 58:11.040
 to create more devices for this,

58:11.040 --> 58:15.280
 but you can see a considerable improvement

58:15.280 --> 58:17.760
 in endurance, in strength,

58:17.760 --> 58:20.100
 and in all kinds of explosive

58:20.100 --> 58:24.360
 and sort of explosive power type output in athletics

58:24.360 --> 58:27.480
 by using these surfaces of the hands

58:27.480 --> 58:30.000
 and bottoms of the feet and face.

58:30.000 --> 58:31.520
 The one that I've tried

58:31.520 --> 58:33.880
 because in anticipation of this episode

58:33.880 --> 58:37.480
 was the dips where then I would cool my hands.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.600
 I actually decided to cool the bottoms of my feet as well

58:39.600 --> 58:40.480
 because it just feels good

58:40.480 --> 58:41.740
 and it's particularly hot out lately.

58:41.740 --> 58:43.800
 So no shoes or socks on,

58:43.800 --> 58:46.640
 put my feet into the bottoms of my feet

58:46.640 --> 58:49.120
 just kind of hovering about a centimeter or two

58:49.120 --> 58:51.320
 below the surface of a bucket of water

58:51.320 --> 58:53.280
 that was just slightly, it felt cool,

58:53.280 --> 58:56.800
 slightly cooler than body temperature or so.

58:56.800 --> 58:58.600
 It just basically what came out of the spigot

58:58.600 --> 59:00.580
 after I let it run for a little bit.

59:00.580 --> 59:04.440
 And indeed I saw a 60% increase in the number of dips

59:04.440 --> 59:05.960
 that I can do in a single session.

59:05.960 --> 59:08.520
 So it's actually a quite significant effect

59:08.520 --> 59:11.560
 and you don't have to be perfectly precise in order to do it.

59:11.560 --> 59:14.080
 And of course, if you want to heat up for whatever reason,

59:14.080 --> 59:16.040
 like you're in, you're camping

59:16.040 --> 59:17.560
 or you're lost in the environment,

59:17.560 --> 59:19.280
 remember these three surfaces

59:19.280 --> 59:22.360
 are going to be the best way to heat your core as well.

59:22.360 --> 59:24.320
 So up until now, we've been talking about

59:24.320 --> 59:26.520
 how to use cold during a workout

59:26.520 --> 59:28.440
 in order to improve performance.

59:28.440 --> 59:31.960
 And indeed cold applied to the appropriate parts of the body

59:31.960 --> 59:36.680
 the appropriate times can vastly improve our performance

59:36.680 --> 59:39.080
 and endurance and strength.

59:39.080 --> 59:41.180
 Now I want to talk about the use of temperature

59:41.180 --> 59:44.960
 in particular cold to improve the speed

59:44.960 --> 59:47.880
 and the depth of recovery.

59:47.880 --> 59:50.440
 Recovery is obviously vital, right?

59:50.440 --> 59:51.880
 During a weight training session

59:51.880 --> 59:53.580
 or during an endurance session,

59:53.580 --> 59:56.420
 that's just the stimulus for getting better the next time.

59:56.420 --> 59:57.680
 And if you don't recover,

59:57.680 --> 1:00:00.280
 you not only won't get better, but you'll get worse.

1:00:01.340 --> 1:00:04.400
 There's a lot of interest in the use of cold

1:00:04.400 --> 1:00:08.400
 in order to improve recovery in the short term.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:10.840
 We see this and probably the best example of this

1:00:10.840 --> 1:00:14.520
 would be fighters in combat sports between rounds

1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:19.200
 or athletes in between quarters or halftime.

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:20.640
 That's one form of recovery.

1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:23.700
 The ability to go back into the sport very soon

1:00:23.700 --> 1:00:26.280
 on an order of minutes, anywhere from like one minute

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:28.800
 in between rounds in typical combat sports

1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:31.340
 or several minutes at a halftime, et cetera.

1:00:31.340 --> 1:00:36.340
 Typically, what we see is people cooling their core,

1:00:37.380 --> 1:00:39.000
 cooling the back of their neck,

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:40.000
 cooling the top of their head.

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.880
 So it might be a sponge with cold water

1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:44.880
 over the top of the head or an ice pack

1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:45.960
 on the back of the neck,

1:00:45.960 --> 1:00:49.640
 or in some cases even wearing cold ice vests.

1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:51.580
 This has actually been done.

1:00:51.580 --> 1:00:53.720
 That's going to be a very inefficient way

1:00:53.720 --> 1:00:56.080
 to improve recovery of that kind.

1:00:56.080 --> 1:00:58.980
 Far better would be to cool the face,

1:00:58.980 --> 1:01:00.820
 the palms of the hands or the bottoms of the feet

1:01:00.820 --> 1:01:03.160
 for the reasons that I described up until now.

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:07.460
 Submerging the body in an ice bath or taking a cold shower,

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:11.360
 say up to the neck or up to the chest

1:01:11.360 --> 1:01:12.720
 or getting under cold water

1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:15.320
 or jumping in a cold lake or something of that sort

1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:17.760
 or in the locker room, getting under the cold shower

1:01:17.760 --> 1:01:21.880
 also would be a terrible way to cool off the body quickly

1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:24.400
 compared to the ways that I described

1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:25.680
 through the palms of the hands,

1:01:25.680 --> 1:01:29.300
 the bottoms of the feet or the face for the following reason.

1:01:29.300 --> 1:01:31.880
 First of all, it's not optimizing those portals

1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:34.100
 of the face, palms, the hands and the feet.

1:01:34.100 --> 1:01:38.000
 And in addition, if it's very cold and you submerge

1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:41.680
 or you cover a lot of the body with that cold,

1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:43.680
 you're going to cause constriction

1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:46.080
 of the very vessels and pathways

1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:49.180
 that allow the body to efficiently dump heat.

1:01:49.180 --> 1:01:54.180
 So again, the key thing is to cool these one or two

1:01:54.240 --> 1:01:55.780
 or three of these surfaces,

1:01:55.780 --> 1:01:59.680
 but not so cold that you cause the vasoconstriction.

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:01.280
 So what does this mean for you?

1:02:02.440 --> 1:02:04.920
 It means that getting in an ice bath or a cold shower

1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:07.460
 or putting an ice pack on the back of your neck,

1:02:07.460 --> 1:02:09.740
 in most cases is not going to be as good

1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:11.540
 as splashing cold water on your face

1:02:11.540 --> 1:02:15.080
 or even just holding your face with a damp cool cloth

1:02:15.080 --> 1:02:16.680
 or something of that sort.

1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:19.380
 It's so kind of counterintuitive.

1:02:19.380 --> 1:02:21.600
 You think, oh, if I just jump into an ice bath,

1:02:21.600 --> 1:02:23.480
 I'm going to cool down much faster

1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:27.000
 than if I just cooled these one or two or three

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:28.360
 of these select regions of the body,

1:02:28.360 --> 1:02:30.240
 but that's actually not the case.

1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:31.640
 And then of course there's recovery

1:02:31.640 --> 1:02:33.760
 that occurs from session to session.

1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:35.680
 So outside of the game or the match

1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:39.420
 or the exercise session.

1:02:39.420 --> 1:02:43.720
 And many people are now relying on things like cryotherapy,

1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:45.480
 which requires a lot of expensive equipment,

1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:49.800
 big liquid nitrogen driven machine.

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:51.640
 Those aren't so common for most people

1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:53.100
 or accessible for most people,

1:02:53.100 --> 1:02:54.600
 but a lot of people are using cold baths

1:02:54.600 --> 1:02:56.800
 or ice baths or cold showers.

1:02:56.800 --> 1:02:59.940
 And again, that's not going to optimize recovery.

1:02:59.940 --> 1:03:02.320
 In fact, it's going to have an additional effect

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:06.200
 that is going to potentially block the training stimulus.

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:07.640
 When you get into an ice bath,

1:03:07.640 --> 1:03:11.900
 indeed there are provided it's not very, very cold.

1:03:11.900 --> 1:03:12.880
 If you get into a cold shower

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:14.280
 provided it's not very, very cold,

1:03:14.280 --> 1:03:17.700
 you are indeed blocking some of the inflammation

1:03:17.700 --> 1:03:20.260
 that occurs because of the training session.

1:03:20.260 --> 1:03:24.040
 But in doing so, you also are blocking pathways

1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:27.420
 such as mTOR, mammalian targeted rapamycin,

1:03:27.420 --> 1:03:29.480
 which are involved in the adaptation

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:32.060
 for a muscle to become stronger or bigger.

1:03:32.060 --> 1:03:35.220
 Put simply, covering the body in cold

1:03:35.220 --> 1:03:38.940
 or immersing the body in cold after training

1:03:38.940 --> 1:03:41.500
 can short circuit or prevent the hypertrophy

1:03:41.500 --> 1:03:43.500
 or muscle growth response.

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:46.000
 It has other effects that can be positive, right?

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.320
 It can induce thermogenesis, et cetera.

1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:49.640
 It can reduce inflammation,

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:53.680
 but it can prevent some of the positive effects of exercise.

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:56.920
 Now, it hasn't been examined so much for endurance work,

1:03:56.920 --> 1:04:00.040
 but let's say you come back from a round of endurance work,

1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:02.940
 a run or a bike or a swim,

1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:07.160
 getting into a cool bath or cooling the palms,

1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:08.480
 the bottoms of the feet or the face,

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:10.240
 in my opinion, based on the science,

1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:13.780
 would be better than completely immersing the body

1:04:13.780 --> 1:04:16.540
 in the ice bath or the cold shower.

1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:18.160
 There is a time and a place

1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:20.380
 for the use of the ice bath or the cold shower

1:04:20.380 --> 1:04:21.380
 or the cold plunge.

1:04:22.460 --> 1:04:25.240
 Those tend to be when you want to deliberately increase

1:04:25.240 --> 1:04:27.140
 brown fat thermogenesis

1:04:27.140 --> 1:04:31.700
 or when you want to deliberately work on mental resilience.

1:04:31.700 --> 1:04:33.740
 And in a subsequent episode on fat loss,

1:04:33.740 --> 1:04:36.040
 I'm going to talk about how to optimize the use of cold

1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:40.060
 specifically for increasing metabolism and fat loss.

1:04:40.060 --> 1:04:43.260
 But for now, since we're talking about the use of cold

1:04:43.260 --> 1:04:46.300
 for improving performance and recovery,

1:04:46.300 --> 1:04:48.300
 the suggestion that I'm going to provide

1:04:48.300 --> 1:04:51.040
 is based on the work of Craig Heller and colleagues

1:04:51.040 --> 1:04:51.880
 that I've been talking about,

1:04:51.880 --> 1:04:53.920
 as well as a excellent book.

1:04:53.920 --> 1:04:57.820
 I mainly rely on textbooks and special volume books,

1:04:57.820 --> 1:04:59.360
 which are collections of papers

1:04:59.360 --> 1:05:00.920
 from experts in a particular area

1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:03.840
 that go beyond standard kind of college level textbooks.

1:05:03.840 --> 1:05:04.900
 The one that I've been relying on

1:05:04.900 --> 1:05:07.480
 is called thermal regulation and human performance,

1:05:07.480 --> 1:05:11.360
 physiological and biological aspects by F.E. Marino.

1:05:11.360 --> 1:05:13.800
 I don't know the publisher, I don't know the author.

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:15.140
 I do recognize some of the names

1:05:15.140 --> 1:05:16.380
 of the particular papers there,

1:05:16.380 --> 1:05:17.520
 but I just want to be clear

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:20.280
 there's no sort of business relationship or deal with them,

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:21.300
 but it's an excellent text.

1:05:21.300 --> 1:05:23.360
 It's called thermal regulation and human performance.

1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:25.080
 You can find it online

1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:26.920
 if you want to go really deep into this.

1:05:26.920 --> 1:05:28.460
 But basically what they show is that

1:05:28.460 --> 1:05:32.240
 if you can cool the body back to its resting temperature,

1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:35.120
 and by resting temperature,

1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:37.040
 I mean within the range that you would see

1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:40.520
 at any time of waking day, but not in exercise.

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:44.620
 So just bringing the body temperature down to baseline.

1:05:44.620 --> 1:05:45.640
 If you can do that,

1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:47.800
 the sooner you can do that after a workout,

1:05:47.800 --> 1:05:50.440
 the sooner that the muscle will recover,

1:05:50.440 --> 1:05:51.760
 that the tendons will recover,

1:05:51.760 --> 1:05:53.320
 and that the person, you,

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:55.520
 can get back into more endurance training,

1:05:55.520 --> 1:05:57.120
 more weight training, et cetera.

1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:01.040
 So cold actually can be a very powerful tool for recovery,

1:06:01.040 --> 1:06:04.760
 but to maximize return to baseline levels of temperature,

1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:08.320
 it's my belief based on the studies

1:06:08.320 --> 1:06:09.780
 that are published in this book,

1:06:09.780 --> 1:06:12.160
 as well as my discussions with my colleague, Craig Heller,

1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:14.960
 and in reviewing the literature overall,

1:06:14.960 --> 1:06:16.920
 that just simply cooling the entire body

1:06:16.920 --> 1:06:19.000
 by jumping into an ice bath or a cold shower

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:20.480
 is not the best way to go.

1:06:20.480 --> 1:06:21.800
 You really want to rely

1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:24.960
 on one of these three glabrous skin portals of the palms,

1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:27.000
 the bottoms of the feet, or the face.

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:30.400
 So now you probably know more than you ever wanted to know

1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:32.240
 about how we regulate body temperature

1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:34.800
 and how it can be applied to exercise,

1:06:34.800 --> 1:06:37.120
 both during the exercise session

1:06:37.120 --> 1:06:39.620
 and afterward to optimize recovery.

1:06:39.620 --> 1:06:43.640
 Many of us, all of us presumably,

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:45.500
 are also eating and drinking things

1:06:45.500 --> 1:06:47.380
 and taking things at various times

1:06:47.380 --> 1:06:49.660
 that can impact this process.

1:06:49.660 --> 1:06:52.320
 And so because of that,

1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:54.140
 we should ask whether or not those things

1:06:54.140 --> 1:06:56.660
 are impacting body temperature.

1:06:56.660 --> 1:06:57.700
 And when we do that,

1:06:57.700 --> 1:06:59.380
 we find that there are certain things

1:06:59.380 --> 1:07:00.360
 that many of us are doing

1:07:00.360 --> 1:07:03.380
 that are actually impairing our performance.

1:07:03.380 --> 1:07:06.580
 So for instance, if you are taking a pre-workout drink

1:07:06.580 --> 1:07:09.940
 or you're ingesting a lot of caffeine or other substance

1:07:09.940 --> 1:07:13.600
 to bring your body temperature up before exercise,

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:16.700
 you are limiting the amount of exercise that you can do.

1:07:17.960 --> 1:07:19.600
 I can recall a time in college

1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:22.220
 when I would drink a lot of espresso.

1:07:22.220 --> 1:07:25.860
 Back then, ephedrine was sold over the counter.

1:07:25.860 --> 1:07:26.980
 I remember taking it.

1:07:26.980 --> 1:07:30.140
 It will really energize you for workouts.

1:07:30.140 --> 1:07:33.060
 You can generate a lot of energy

1:07:33.060 --> 1:07:35.180
 and get extremely focused taking those things.

1:07:35.180 --> 1:07:36.300
 They do increase heart rate.

1:07:36.300 --> 1:07:37.820
 They can be quite dangerous.

1:07:37.820 --> 1:07:39.180
 I don't recommend people take them.

1:07:39.180 --> 1:07:41.640
 In fact, I think ephedrine is now off the shelves

1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:44.660
 as a non-prescription compound

1:07:44.660 --> 1:07:46.520
 because various people died from taking it

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:49.220
 who were sensitive to it or exercised in heat.

1:07:49.220 --> 1:07:50.700
 But looking back at that,

1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:53.100
 I realized it was a foolish approach.

1:07:53.100 --> 1:07:55.300
 It was increasing core thermogenesis.

1:07:55.300 --> 1:07:57.820
 Sure, I might've burned a few more calories,

1:07:57.820 --> 1:08:00.240
 but actually when I look at the data

1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:02.940
 that are coming from specific cooling

1:08:02.940 --> 1:08:06.520
 and how that can so increase in performance

1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:07.940
 if done properly,

1:08:07.940 --> 1:08:10.020
 and then I compare that to the effects

1:08:10.020 --> 1:08:12.460
 of taking some sort of thermogenic compound,

1:08:12.460 --> 1:08:15.020
 whatever it is, some pre-workout or some pill

1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:17.140
 or high levels of caffeine,

1:08:17.140 --> 1:08:20.340
 it's very clear that increasing body temperature

1:08:20.340 --> 1:08:22.940
 prior to working out is the exact wrong thing

1:08:22.940 --> 1:08:24.360
 that one would want to do.

1:08:24.360 --> 1:08:25.900
 You don't want to stay so cold

1:08:25.900 --> 1:08:27.940
 that you can't generate good muscle contractions.

1:08:27.940 --> 1:08:31.540
 You don't want to be like I am coming out of the cold ocean

1:08:31.540 --> 1:08:33.100
 with claws for hands,

1:08:33.100 --> 1:08:36.580
 but one wants to have your body temperature in a range

1:08:36.580 --> 1:08:40.020
 that still allows you to work hard and perform well.

1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:43.580
 Now, in terms of recovery,

1:08:43.580 --> 1:08:46.980
 things like alcohol, we know are vasodilators.

1:08:46.980 --> 1:08:50.420
 So those are going to cause people to drop body temperature.

1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:52.540
 So you might think, oh, well, that sounds great for recovery

1:08:52.540 --> 1:08:54.500
 and I don't think people should be drinking

1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:57.700
 who have problems with alcohol intake,

1:08:57.700 --> 1:09:00.380
 alcoholics or they're not of drinking age, et cetera.

1:09:00.380 --> 1:09:01.420
 I'm not a drinker,

1:09:01.420 --> 1:09:03.420
 but I do have a good friend who's a quite accomplished

1:09:03.420 --> 1:09:06.460
 athlete who basically drinks a beer or two

1:09:06.460 --> 1:09:09.720
 after his long runs or cycling.

1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:12.640
 And his argument is, well, I'm dumping body heat

1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:15.060
 and I like a beer and he's probably right.

1:09:15.060 --> 1:09:16.480
 It's probably a really good tool

1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:18.400
 provided you don't have issues with alcohol

1:09:18.400 --> 1:09:20.140
 that would preclude that as a tool

1:09:20.140 --> 1:09:21.660
 or you're not of drinking age.

1:09:22.860 --> 1:09:26.300
 But anything that you ingest after exercise

1:09:26.300 --> 1:09:28.040
 that would increase body temperature

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:29.980
 is going to impede recovery.

1:09:29.980 --> 1:09:32.200
 Anything that you do that lowers body temperature

1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:33.800
 provided it's in safe ranges

1:09:34.660 --> 1:09:37.220
 is going to accelerate recovery.

1:09:37.220 --> 1:09:39.860
 And that brings us to the whole host of compounds

1:09:39.860 --> 1:09:44.300
 that people take that can increase body temperature.

1:09:44.300 --> 1:09:45.900
 And many people are taking these things

1:09:45.900 --> 1:09:49.180
 in order to increase fat burning and increase metabolism.

1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:50.420
 But in my opinion,

1:09:50.420 --> 1:09:53.380
 it's impeding their ability to perform well.

1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:55.980
 And especially if the performance is something

1:09:55.980 --> 1:09:57.380
 that you're focused on,

1:09:57.380 --> 1:10:01.620
 aside from body recomposition, losing fat building muscle.

1:10:01.620 --> 1:10:04.000
 But even if you're focused on losing fat building muscle,

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:05.020
 you have to ask yourself,

1:10:05.020 --> 1:10:07.120
 is the body temperature increase

1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:10.180
 that I'm getting from these compounds really worth it?

1:10:10.180 --> 1:10:14.220
 Given that it can block or prevent my performance

1:10:14.220 --> 1:10:16.400
 from being as good as it could.

1:10:16.400 --> 1:10:17.240
 In other words,

1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:18.340
 is it worth taking something

1:10:18.340 --> 1:10:20.380
 that makes you feel very energized to go work out,

1:10:20.380 --> 1:10:23.540
 but then you now know that you are stopping earlier

1:10:23.540 --> 1:10:24.980
 and you're performing less well,

1:10:24.980 --> 1:10:27.860
 fewer reps, fewer steps overall.

1:10:27.860 --> 1:10:29.020
 Is it worth it?

1:10:29.020 --> 1:10:30.620
 If you had not taken that thing,

1:10:30.620 --> 1:10:33.700
 then you could perform much longer

1:10:33.700 --> 1:10:36.020
 and at much higher capacity.

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:38.380
 Some of you are probably saying,

1:10:38.380 --> 1:10:39.260
 well, that's ridiculous

1:10:39.260 --> 1:10:41.980
 because when I drink a quadruple espresso

1:10:41.980 --> 1:10:45.420
 and I pop a whatever pre-workout or drink a pre-workout,

1:10:45.420 --> 1:10:47.660
 then I know I can go much further.

1:10:47.660 --> 1:10:49.920
 Ah, that might be true,

1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:51.340
 but the increase in temperature

1:10:51.340 --> 1:10:53.940
 is also costing you on the recovery side.

1:10:53.940 --> 1:10:56.120
 And unless you're doing other things

1:10:56.120 --> 1:10:57.540
 to improve your recovery,

1:10:57.540 --> 1:10:59.340
 and I know many people that are, I don't judge,

1:10:59.340 --> 1:11:00.880
 but many people who are doing those things

1:11:00.880 --> 1:11:02.340
 are also augmenting their recovery

1:11:02.340 --> 1:11:03.840
 through hormone augmentation

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:07.340
 and other performance enhancing tools.

1:11:07.340 --> 1:11:09.700
 Then for the typical person who's not doing that,

1:11:09.700 --> 1:11:11.700
 it's probably shooting yourself in the foot.

1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:14.080
 So let's take a look at what some of those compounds are

1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:15.340
 and what they do,

1:11:15.340 --> 1:11:16.620
 and just briefly review

1:11:16.620 --> 1:11:19.380
 whether or not they would be a good or a bad idea to include

1:11:19.380 --> 1:11:21.640
 if your main goals are performance

1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:24.580
 or your main goals are body recomposition or both.

1:11:24.580 --> 1:11:26.580
 So let's just briefly discuss stimulants.

1:11:26.580 --> 1:11:27.620
 This could be caffeine.

1:11:27.620 --> 1:11:30.220
 This could be any other kind of stimulant

1:11:30.220 --> 1:11:33.220
 that are typically in a pre-workout drink

1:11:33.220 --> 1:11:36.380
 or anything that might get you revved up before exercising.

1:11:36.380 --> 1:11:38.120
 This could even be very strong tea.

1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:40.180
 I've mentioned I'm a big consumer of mate.

1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:41.460
 I like a yerba mate.

1:11:41.460 --> 1:11:43.300
 I love that stuff.

1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:45.220
 And I also drink caffeine.

1:11:45.220 --> 1:11:46.940
 I drink, I love coffee of various kinds,

1:11:46.940 --> 1:11:49.540
 mushroom coffee, black coffee, espresso, et cetera.

1:11:49.540 --> 1:11:52.960
 I'm a chronic caffeine user.

1:11:52.960 --> 1:11:54.340
 I don't think I'm an addict,

1:11:54.340 --> 1:11:57.000
 but I'm a chronic caffeine user.

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:58.820
 Meaning when I drink caffeine,

1:11:58.820 --> 1:12:01.000
 my heart rate doesn't increase so much

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.640
 that it feels like a shock to my system.

1:12:03.640 --> 1:12:05.680
 Some people are not caffeine adapted

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:07.720
 or they're very caffeine sensitive.

1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:09.900
 Here's the straightforward rule.

1:12:09.900 --> 1:12:14.160
 Caffeine for somebody who doesn't drink caffeine very much

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:15.920
 will constrict the blood vessels

1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:18.800
 and will increase retention of body heat.

1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:21.720
 And it's probably a bad idea before exercise.

1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:24.520
 For somebody who's caffeine adapted

1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:26.600
 and is used to drinking caffeine,

1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:28.600
 it won't have that vasoconstriction effect.

1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:32.160
 That's what the data point to because I'm adapted to it.

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:34.480
 But it will cause vasodilation

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:35.960
 and will allow me to dump body heat.

1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:38.400
 So for me, I use it before I train

1:12:38.400 --> 1:12:39.800
 or do any kind of exercise

1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:41.320
 because I tend to do that early in the day.

1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:42.700
 It won't prevent me from sleeping

1:12:42.700 --> 1:12:44.840
 and it causes vasodilation.

1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:45.920
 And then afterwards,

1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:48.160
 I'm aware that it causes vasoconstriction

1:12:48.160 --> 1:12:50.020
 after the caffeine wears off.

1:12:50.020 --> 1:12:53.500
 So for somebody who drinks two or three or more

1:12:53.500 --> 1:12:55.360
 cups of coffee a day or mate a day,

1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:56.740
 so we're talking intake of anywhere

1:12:56.740 --> 1:12:59.120
 from 100 to 400 milligrams of caffeine,

1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:02.780
 what you want to do is you want to make sure

1:13:02.780 --> 1:13:06.120
 that you would do that before exercise

1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:08.560
 and probably not after exercise.

1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:10.360
 That just makes logical sense

1:13:10.360 --> 1:13:12.240
 given what we know about thermal regulation.

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:14.660
 And if you're somebody who doesn't drink caffeine,

1:13:14.660 --> 1:13:16.600
 drinking caffeine before a workout

1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:18.160
 is going to be about the worst thing

1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:18.980
 that you could possibly do

1:13:18.980 --> 1:13:21.080
 because it's going to increase core body temperature

1:13:21.080 --> 1:13:22.760
 through its thermogenic effects.

1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:25.200
 And it's going to constrict your blood vessels

1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:27.320
 and make it even harder to dump heat.

1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:31.200
 So I don't suggest that people drink caffeine or not.

1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.200
 I just suggest that you think about

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:35.620
 whether or not you're caffeine adapted or not

1:13:35.620 --> 1:13:37.880
 and decide whether or not you want to drink caffeine.

1:13:37.880 --> 1:13:39.700
 In general, you're going to be better

1:13:39.700 --> 1:13:43.380
 not drinking any caffeine than you are drinking caffeine

1:13:43.380 --> 1:13:45.880
 unless you're a heavy caffeine user or abuser,

1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:47.800
 in which case not drinking caffeine

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:49.400
 is going to give you vicious headaches

1:13:49.400 --> 1:13:51.800
 and is going to make it very hard to get motivated

1:13:51.800 --> 1:13:53.080
 because you're just not used to it.

1:13:53.080 --> 1:13:57.000
 It takes about three weeks to get used to no caffeine.

1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:57.840
 It's brutal.

1:13:57.840 --> 1:13:58.660
 I've done it before.

1:13:58.660 --> 1:13:59.960
 I've done caffeine fast.

1:13:59.960 --> 1:14:01.340
 I don't know that I ever want to do it again.

1:14:01.340 --> 1:14:02.960
 That's how painful it was.

1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:05.160
 But you get headaches because of the effects

1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:07.400
 on vasodilation and constriction.

1:14:07.400 --> 1:14:09.960
 If you like caffeine, use in moderate amounts

1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:11.980
 and use it before your workout's not after.

1:14:11.980 --> 1:14:14.220
 If you don't like caffeine or you don't use it very often,

1:14:14.220 --> 1:14:16.420
 stay away from it anywhere close to exercise

1:14:16.420 --> 1:14:18.840
 before or after for that matter.

1:14:18.840 --> 1:14:21.880
 One of the more commonly used compounds

1:14:21.880 --> 1:14:23.400
 that's sold over the counter

1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:26.240
 are non-steroid anti-inflammatories.

1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:29.000
 So things like Tylenol and Advil and other trade names

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.120
 and the Proxen sodium, things of that sort.

1:14:31.120 --> 1:14:36.080
 Almost all of those drop body temperature to some extent.

1:14:36.080 --> 1:14:38.600
 And that's why it's often recommended

1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:40.640
 that people take them when they have a fever.

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:43.720
 Although the whole business of dropping body temperature

1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:45.440
 artificially when you have a fever

1:14:45.440 --> 1:14:47.360
 is itself an interesting discussion

1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:50.300
 whether or not that's the most adaptive or best thing to do.

1:14:50.300 --> 1:14:51.920
 Certainly you don't want fever to go too high.

1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:53.920
 It can be very dangerous, can kill you.

1:14:53.920 --> 1:14:57.160
 But artificially dropping body temperature

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:59.520
 with these compounds can be tricky.

1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:02.760
 Now, a number of athletes, especially endurance athletes,

1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:06.200
 will rely on these non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:09.260
 specifically to keep body temperature lower

1:15:09.260 --> 1:15:11.540
 during long bouts of exertion.

1:15:11.540 --> 1:15:14.560
 This is a little bit of a pharmacologic version

1:15:14.560 --> 1:15:18.400
 of dumping heat instead of using Palmer cooling

1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:22.640
 or face ice pack cooling.

1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:24.100
 They're relying on pharmacology

1:15:24.100 --> 1:15:26.400
 to drop their core body temperature.

1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:29.960
 That has certain obvious advantages.

1:15:29.960 --> 1:15:32.000
 Those advantages should be obvious

1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:33.800
 and the reasons for them should be obvious

1:15:33.800 --> 1:15:35.720
 based on everything we've talked about up until now.

1:15:35.720 --> 1:15:37.600
 Lower temperature allows you to go further harder

1:15:37.600 --> 1:15:38.680
 with more intensity.

1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:42.460
 However, they do have effects on the liver

1:15:42.460 --> 1:15:45.000
 and they can also have effects on the kidneys

1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:46.800
 and during long bouts of exercise

1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:48.040
 or even short bouts of exercise,

1:15:48.040 --> 1:15:49.600
 water balance and salt balance

1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:52.500
 are also going to be vital to maintain

1:15:52.500 --> 1:15:55.360
 in order to perform well,

1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:57.040
 generate the best muscle contraction,

1:15:57.040 --> 1:15:59.440
 stay mentally alert and also to stay alive.

1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:02.080
 We will do an episode on salt electrolytes

1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:04.480
 and water and water balance,

1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:07.080
 but you probably want to think carefully

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:08.960
 about whether or not you want to use

1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:12.400
 non-steroid anti-inflammatories before any training session

1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:15.400
 just for the performance augmentation effect,

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:18.280
 unless you're working carefully with a coach,

1:16:18.280 --> 1:16:20.440
 whether or not you've done that in practices

1:16:20.440 --> 1:16:24.280
 and of course, whether or not you are in a situation

1:16:24.280 --> 1:16:26.880
 where monitoring your body temperature carefully

1:16:26.880 --> 1:16:27.840
 is going to be important.

1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:29.140
 You might ask, well, when would that be?

1:16:29.140 --> 1:16:34.120
 Well, desert races, summer training in races, winter rides,

1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:36.300
 you certainly don't want to get too cool either.

1:16:36.300 --> 1:16:41.260
 So alcohol, caffeine and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs

1:16:41.260 --> 1:16:42.920
 because of their effects on temperature

1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:45.200
 will impact performance and recovery,

1:16:45.200 --> 1:16:47.480
 but you want to be cautious about how you approach them.

1:16:47.480 --> 1:16:51.200
 I personally am more a fan of using caffeine

1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:54.020
 in moderate doses for the reasons I described before,

1:16:54.020 --> 1:16:56.680
 as well to use the cooling of the palms,

1:16:56.680 --> 1:17:00.120
 cooling of the bottoms of my feet, right?

1:17:00.120 --> 1:17:03.280
 By placing them into a bucket or into a cool bath

1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:07.200
 after training or cooling the face after training

1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:08.860
 or sometimes even during training.

1:17:08.860 --> 1:17:10.640
 It just seems like there's more of a margin

1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:12.720
 to play with the variables, to heat up the water

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:14.840
 or cool it down a little bit

1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:18.200
 to include one palm or the other palm.

1:17:18.200 --> 1:17:21.860
 There's just all sorts of good parameter space

1:17:21.860 --> 1:17:23.660
 as we call it in science that you can play with

1:17:23.660 --> 1:17:25.800
 and work with to find what works for you.

1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:29.520
 Whereas when you pop a pill, sure, you can adjust the dose

1:17:29.520 --> 1:17:31.000
 and you can adjust it next time,

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:32.400
 but once it's in you, it's in you

1:17:32.400 --> 1:17:34.080
 and there's going to be some period of time

1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:35.920
 before you can modulate it.

1:17:35.920 --> 1:17:38.240
 What I've offered today are ways

1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:39.940
 in which you can use temperature

1:17:39.940 --> 1:17:42.760
 to powerfully improve performance.

1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:43.600
 And if you think about it,

1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:45.360
 you can vary that from set to set.

1:17:45.360 --> 1:17:48.000
 You could do your pull-ups or your sprints

1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:49.720
 and then cool your palms

1:17:49.720 --> 1:17:52.680
 and then try and go with colder water the next round

1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:54.340
 or warmer water the next round

1:17:54.340 --> 1:17:56.360
 or do both feet and palms and face.

1:17:56.360 --> 1:17:58.600
 I mean, you can do all sorts of things moment to moment

1:17:58.600 --> 1:18:00.280
 and see what works for you.

1:18:00.280 --> 1:18:02.880
 Again, essentially zero cost or no cost.

1:18:02.880 --> 1:18:06.240
 Whereas when you pop something, you take a pill,

1:18:06.240 --> 1:18:08.360
 you're basically in that regimen

1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:10.480
 for the next hour or two or more.

1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:12.980
 You can always take more, but you can't really take less.

1:18:12.980 --> 1:18:15.160
 You can't really extract it from your body in real time.

1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:17.080
 So it doesn't give you a lot of opportunity

1:18:17.080 --> 1:18:19.640
 to play scientist, which is what I like to do

1:18:19.640 --> 1:18:21.160
 because what I'm always trying to do

1:18:21.160 --> 1:18:23.920
 is trying to dial in the best protocols possible

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:25.520
 based on the mechanisms and data.

1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:26.920
 And if you can do that moment to moment,

1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:29.240
 that places you in a position of power.

1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:31.880
 Once again, we've covered a lot of material.

1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:34.000
 By now, after seeing this episode

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:35.980
 or listening to this episode,

1:18:35.980 --> 1:18:37.160
 you should understand a lot

1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:39.920
 about how your body heats and cools itself

1:18:39.920 --> 1:18:43.240
 and the value of that for physical performance.

1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:44.480
 I hope you'll also appreciate

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:46.420
 that you have tools at your disposal

1:18:46.420 --> 1:18:49.480
 to vastly improve your physical performance.

1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:53.200
 And should you try those, please let us know how it goes.

1:18:53.200 --> 1:18:55.660
 If you decide to do Palmer cooling during your runs

1:18:55.660 --> 1:18:58.760
 or after your runs, during your weight workouts,

1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:01.240
 during your yoga sessions, whatever it is, let us know.

1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:03.380
 Please place that in the comments.

1:19:03.380 --> 1:19:06.760
 I've given you specific protocols and some direction,

1:19:06.760 --> 1:19:08.960
 but I've also left it slightly vague

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:11.000
 because as I mentioned earlier,

1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:12.760
 I don't know all the environmental conditions.

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:14.800
 I don't know how hot your yoga studio is

1:19:14.800 --> 1:19:16.520
 or how cool your gym happens to be

1:19:16.520 --> 1:19:19.340
 or your body temperature or time of day.

1:19:19.340 --> 1:19:21.080
 Remember, your temperature will vary

1:19:21.080 --> 1:19:22.240
 according to the time of day.

1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:24.700
 We did a whole episode about that related to sleep.

1:19:24.700 --> 1:19:27.800
 Typically your body temperature is rising early in the day

1:19:27.800 --> 1:19:30.800
 and is coming down as you approach the late evening

1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:32.500
 and late night hours for sleep.

1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:34.720
 In the middle of the night, your temperature is very low,

1:19:34.720 --> 1:19:35.720
 at its absolute lowest,

1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:37.440
 something we call the temperature minimum.

1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:40.100
 So we don't know exactly where you're at.

1:19:40.100 --> 1:19:42.860
 You need to take the information that you received today

1:19:42.860 --> 1:19:45.100
 and should you try and incorporate it,

1:19:45.100 --> 1:19:46.400
 try and do it intelligently.

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:50.680
 Don't cool yourself off so much that you become cryogenic

1:19:50.680 --> 1:19:52.520
 and please don't warm yourself up.

1:19:52.520 --> 1:19:55.520
 In fact, we didn't talk at all about warming yourself up

1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:58.980
 because warming yourself up too much can be quite dangerous.

1:19:58.980 --> 1:20:01.500
 You never, ever, ever want to be hypothermic.

1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:04.760
 That's what your body and your brain are trying to avoid.

1:20:04.760 --> 1:20:07.680
 We talked a little bit about supplements

1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:09.560
 but not the standard sorts of supplements

1:20:09.560 --> 1:20:11.520
 I usually list off on these episodes.

1:20:11.520 --> 1:20:14.000
 Rather, we talked about caffeine,

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:15.860
 non-steroid anti-inflammatories

1:20:15.860 --> 1:20:17.160
 and how those can impact temperature,

1:20:17.160 --> 1:20:19.240
 how alcohol can impact temperature.

1:20:19.240 --> 1:20:21.080
 And I should just mention in closing

1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:23.380
 that every time we eat, we also increase temperature.

1:20:23.380 --> 1:20:26.000
 There's a eating-induced thermogenic effect

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:27.080
 but that's a minor one.

1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:27.920
 That's a small one.

1:20:27.920 --> 1:20:31.740
 So you wouldn't worry about eating before training

1:20:31.740 --> 1:20:33.220
 because of its effects on temperature

1:20:33.220 --> 1:20:35.960
 because it tends to be really minor.

1:20:35.960 --> 1:20:38.400
 Going forward, we're going to talk more about temperature

1:20:38.400 --> 1:20:41.780
 and other ways to improve physical performance

1:20:41.780 --> 1:20:42.640
 and skill learning.

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:44.620
 We're going to talk about specific ways

1:20:44.620 --> 1:20:48.740
 to accelerate fat loss, to improve muscle growth,

1:20:48.740 --> 1:20:52.400
 to improve suppleness and flexibility.

1:20:52.400 --> 1:20:56.560
 These approaches and mechanisms are anchored deeply

1:20:56.560 --> 1:20:58.360
 in neuroscience and physiology

1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:00.800
 and the relationship between our peripheral organs

1:21:00.800 --> 1:21:03.840
 which include our skin and our brain

1:21:03.840 --> 1:21:05.640
 and all the organs in between.

1:21:05.640 --> 1:21:07.180
 So it's really a pleasure for me

1:21:07.180 --> 1:21:10.460
 because I'm able to look to the textbook literature

1:21:10.460 --> 1:21:12.280
 that exists and really came out

1:21:12.280 --> 1:21:14.400
 over the last 50 to 100 years.

1:21:14.400 --> 1:21:16.380
 And unlike a lot of areas of neuroscience

1:21:16.380 --> 1:21:18.260
 which are still sort of mystical

1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:20.160
 like consciousness and dreaming

1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:22.180
 of which we understand a little bit about,

1:21:22.180 --> 1:21:24.600
 these core mechanisms of temperature and physiology

1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:29.080
 which are so powerful involve very concrete studies

1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:31.720
 that as you learned today are very actionable.

1:21:32.680 --> 1:21:34.220

 but from time to time, we also release shorter content

1:21:56.280 --> 1:21:58.560
 and we will be releasing additional content

1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:00.460

1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:12.560
 and to leave us feedback.

1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:14.080
 They have a comment section there.

1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:16.240
 It's really a feedback section where you can rate

1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:19.580
 and describe the podcast as you experience it.

1:22:19.580 --> 1:22:21.100

 That's a terrific way to support us.

1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:26.720
 We also have a Patreon.

1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:30.720
 You can find it at patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:32.560
 that allows you to support the podcast

1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:34.640
 at any level that you like.

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:36.720
 Today, we didn't focus so heavily on supplements

1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:38.280
 but in other episodes I have

1:22:38.280 --> 1:22:40.960
 and there are certainly supplements that are beneficial

1:22:40.960 --> 1:22:44.000
 for sleep, for performance, for learning,

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:45.840
 immunity and so forth.

1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:50.840
 We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com

1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:54.000
 because Thorne supplements, we believe to be

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.100
 the most stringent in terms of what they put

1:22:57.100 --> 1:22:59.040
 on the bottle is actually what's in the bottle.

1:22:59.040 --> 1:23:00.300
 So the amounts are precise

1:23:00.300 --> 1:23:02.520
 and the quality of the ingredients is very precise.

1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:04.120
 They partner with the Mayo Clinic,

1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:05.320
 all the major sports teams.

1:23:05.320 --> 1:23:07.140
 So we're delighted that we're partnered with Thorne.

1:23:07.140 --> 1:23:09.080
 If you want to see the supplements that I take,

1:23:09.080 --> 1:23:13.760
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman

1:23:13.760 --> 1:23:15.460
 and you can see the supplements that I take.

1:23:15.460 --> 1:23:18.160
 You could get 20% off any of those supplements

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:19.400
 should you choose to order them

1:23:19.400 --> 1:23:21.880
 as well as 20% off any other supplements

1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:23.500
 that Thorne happens to make.

1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:28.040
 That's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com slash the letter U

1:23:28.040 --> 1:23:31.460
 slash Huberman to get 20% off any of the supplements

1:23:31.460 --> 1:23:33.240
 that Thorne makes.

1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:35.020
 And last but not least,

1:23:35.020 --> 1:23:36.820
 I want to thank you for your time and attention.

1:23:36.820 --> 1:23:38.960
 I realize this is a lot of information.

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:40.680
 I hope you'll find some of it to be actionable

1:23:40.680 --> 1:23:43.080
 and useful for you and for people that you know

1:23:43.080 --> 1:23:45.760
 and as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:23:45.760 --> 1:23:50.760
 I'll see you next time.
