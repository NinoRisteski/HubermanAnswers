00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.000
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.000 --> 00:12.700
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.700 --> 00:14.420
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.420 --> 00:17.500
 Today, we are discussing focus and concentration

00:17.500 --> 00:20.720
 and tools for improving your focus and concentration.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.520
 This is a topic that I've covered previously

00:22.520 --> 00:25.280
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast, but in different contexts.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.920
 For instance, we had a very popular episode on ADHD,

00:27.920 --> 00:30.120
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

00:30.120 --> 00:32.100
 which of course relates to the topic of focus

00:32.100 --> 00:33.520
 and how to improve focus.

00:33.520 --> 00:36.440
 We've also talked a lot about dopamine motivation and drive.

00:36.440 --> 00:37.720
 In fact, that's the title

00:37.720 --> 00:39.960
 of your previous also quite popular episode

00:39.960 --> 00:41.200
 of this podcast.

00:41.200 --> 00:44.180
 But never before have we had a single episode

00:44.180 --> 00:45.920
 solely devoted to the tools

00:45.920 --> 00:47.920
 to improve focus and concentration.

00:47.920 --> 00:49.960
 The rationale for recording this episode

00:49.960 --> 00:52.560
 is to provide people one location where they can go

00:52.560 --> 00:54.480
 and quickly access the specific tools

00:54.480 --> 00:56.480
 for increasing focus and concentration

00:56.480 --> 00:59.060
 that are known to be the most powerful tools

00:59.060 --> 01:00.760
 and the most up-to-date tools.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.520
 In fact, today's episode is going to include description

01:03.520 --> 01:05.380
 of several peer-reviewed studies

01:05.380 --> 01:06.540
 and the tools that emerge

01:06.540 --> 01:08.360
 from those scientific peer-reviewed studies

01:08.360 --> 01:12.040
 that point to new and fortunately even briefer protocols

01:12.040 --> 01:13.360
 than I've described before.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.080
 So what I'm basically describing here

01:15.080 --> 01:18.080
 is tools that in a very short amount of time

01:18.080 --> 01:20.200
 will allow you to significantly increase

01:20.200 --> 01:22.580
 your focus and concentration abilities.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.600
 Those tools will include behavioral tools,

01:24.600 --> 01:27.000
 nutrition-based tools, supplement-based tools,

01:27.000 --> 01:28.940
 brain machine interface-based tools,

01:28.940 --> 01:30.540
 and for those of you that are working

01:30.540 --> 01:33.120
 with physician prescription drug tools.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.160
 Today's episode ought to benefit anybody,

01:35.160 --> 01:37.360
 young or old or anything in between,

01:37.360 --> 01:40.000
 whether or not you have ADHD or not.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.720
 Today's episode is going to give you tools

01:41.720 --> 01:43.560
 that you can apply in your daily life.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.640
 Most all of them are completely zero cost

01:45.640 --> 01:47.920
 and those tools will allow you

01:47.920 --> 01:49.640
 to tap into the neurochemistry

01:49.640 --> 01:51.800
 and the neural circuits within your brain and body

01:51.800 --> 01:53.360
 that peer-reviewed science

01:53.360 --> 01:56.040
 has reliably shown can significantly improve

01:56.040 --> 01:58.480
 your focus and concentration abilities.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.200
 Just to give you a little teaser of the kinds of tools

02:00.200 --> 02:02.320
 that I'm going to provide you on today's episode,

02:02.320 --> 02:04.100
 a previous guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast

02:04.100 --> 02:05.400
 was Dr. Wendy Suzuki.

02:05.400 --> 02:08.660
 Dr. Suzuki is a professor of psychology and neuroscience

02:08.660 --> 02:12.080
 at New York University or NYU as it's commonly referred to.

02:12.080 --> 02:15.800
 She's also the Dean of Arts and Sciences at NYU.

02:15.800 --> 02:18.200
 Her laboratory made a very important discovery

02:18.200 --> 02:21.940
 which was that a very brief, just 12, actually 13

02:21.940 --> 02:23.520
 if you really count the intro,

02:23.520 --> 02:25.980
 but 13 minute daily meditation

02:25.980 --> 02:28.640
 performed for a period of about eight weeks

02:28.640 --> 02:30.880
 significantly increased people's focus

02:30.880 --> 02:32.160
 and concentration abilities.

02:32.160 --> 02:34.400
 And the great news is you didn't need all eight weeks.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.560
 It was just that's how long that you ran the study.

02:36.560 --> 02:37.700
 So during today's episode,

02:37.700 --> 02:39.840
 I will describe that protocol in detail.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.360
 I'll also provide you an even briefer alternative

02:42.360 --> 02:45.160
 to that protocol that you can use if, for instance,

02:45.160 --> 02:47.600
 you find yourself with only three minutes or four minutes

02:47.600 --> 02:49.760
 or five minutes a day to meditate.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.920
 The great news is there's quality peer-reviewed science

02:51.920 --> 02:54.160
 to support that form of meditation

02:54.160 --> 02:56.840
 for improving focus and concentration.

02:56.840 --> 02:59.920
 And that falls under the bin of these zero cost tools

02:59.920 --> 03:02.000
 that you can really use to tap into the neurochemistry

03:02.000 --> 03:04.480
 and neural circuits that really allow you to take control

03:04.480 --> 03:07.520
 of your cognitive abilities and improve them over time.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.080
 I'll also provide you important details

03:09.080 --> 03:10.680
 about that protocol and other protocols.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.120
 For instance, contrary to popular belief, it is not,

03:14.120 --> 03:15.960
 I repeat, it is not a good idea

03:15.960 --> 03:18.360
 to do a focused based meditation

03:18.360 --> 03:20.840
 within the four hours before bedtime.

03:20.840 --> 03:23.600
 Many people, including some of the subjects in that study

03:23.600 --> 03:26.040
 performed by the Suzuki lab,

03:26.040 --> 03:30.040
 found that when they did a focusing meditation protocol,

03:30.040 --> 03:31.640
 even if it was very calming,

03:31.640 --> 03:34.880
 it led to difficulties in falling and staying asleep.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.600
 So that runs counter to a lot of what we heard

03:36.600 --> 03:38.320
 about meditation being great for sleep.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.200
 It turns out meditation might be great for sleep.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.800
 It certainly is great for improving focus capacity,

03:42.800 --> 03:44.660
 but I highly recommend that if you're going to apply

03:44.660 --> 03:46.520
 a focused meditation tool

03:46.520 --> 03:48.840
 in order to improve your focus and concentration,

03:48.840 --> 03:50.600
 then you make sure that that's performed

03:50.600 --> 03:53.600
 not within four hours prior to bedtime.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.860
 So that's just a brief example

03:54.860 --> 03:56.680
 of the sorts of tools and protocols

03:56.680 --> 03:58.520
 and details about the tools and protocols

03:58.520 --> 04:00.540
 that I'll provide on today's episode.

04:00.540 --> 04:02.780
 I should mention that we have provided links

04:02.780 --> 04:03.980
 in the show note caption

04:03.980 --> 04:06.600
 so that you can quickly go to the studies that we describe,

04:06.600 --> 04:08.200
 as well as some of the behavioral tools

04:08.200 --> 04:10.620
 and other tools that we'll cover,

04:10.620 --> 04:13.360
 things like the use of binaural beats, supplements, et cetera.

04:13.360 --> 04:15.080
 Our goal here again is to provide you

04:15.080 --> 04:18.240
 the maximum number of tools for focus and concentration

04:18.240 --> 04:19.560
 that you can pick from and choose from

04:19.560 --> 04:20.740
 and apply in your life

04:20.740 --> 04:23.040
 and try and eliminate as much of the legwork

04:23.040 --> 04:26.000
 required to seek out and apply those tools.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.900
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

04:27.900 --> 04:30.220
 is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.

04:30.220 --> 04:32.440
 We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.140
 First of all, they ship internationally

04:34.140 --> 04:36.040
 because we know that many of you are located

04:36.040 --> 04:37.840
 outside of the United States.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.920
 That's valuable.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.940
 Second of all, and perhaps most important,

04:40.940 --> 04:43.480
 the quality of their supplements is second to none,

04:43.480 --> 04:45.160
 both in terms of purity and precision

04:45.160 --> 04:47.100
 of the amounts of the ingredients.

04:47.100 --> 04:49.740
 Third, we've really emphasized supplements

04:49.740 --> 04:51.920
 that are single ingredient supplements

04:51.920 --> 04:54.000
 and that are supplied in dosages

04:54.000 --> 04:56.960
 that allow you to build a supplementation protocol

04:56.960 --> 04:58.800
 that's optimized for cost,

04:58.800 --> 05:00.680
 that's optimized for effectiveness,

05:00.680 --> 05:02.160
 and that you can add things

05:02.160 --> 05:03.840
 and remove things from your protocol

05:03.840 --> 05:05.840
 in a way that's really systematic and scientific.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.180
 This is really hard to do

05:07.180 --> 05:09.060
 if you're taking blends of different supplements

05:09.060 --> 05:11.800
 or if the dosages are such that you can't titrate

05:11.800 --> 05:15.200
 or that is adjust the dosages of a given supplement.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.840
 So by using single ingredient supplements,

05:17.840 --> 05:19.520
 you can really build out the supplement kit

05:19.520 --> 05:22.620
 that's ideal for you and your specific needs.

05:22.620 --> 05:23.800
 If you'd like to see the supplements

05:23.800 --> 05:25.120
 that we partner with Momentus on,

05:25.120 --> 05:28.220
 you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

05:28.220 --> 05:29.360
 There you'll see those supplements.

05:29.360 --> 05:31.820
 And just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding

05:31.820 --> 05:34.520
 the library of supplements available through Momentus

05:34.520 --> 05:35.460
 on a regular basis.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.160
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

05:38.160 --> 05:40.560
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

05:40.560 --> 05:43.260
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.360
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

05:45.360 --> 05:47.820
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

05:47.820 --> 05:50.540
 and science-related tools to the general public.

05:50.540 --> 05:51.640
 In keeping with that theme,

05:51.640 --> 05:54.360
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.280
 Our first sponsor is Thesus.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.080
 Thesus makes custom nootropics.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.400
 And to be quite honest, I don't like the word nootropics

06:00.400 --> 06:03.840
 because the translation of nootropics is smart drugs.

06:03.840 --> 06:06.000
 And as a neuroscientist, I can tell you,

06:06.000 --> 06:08.840
 there is no neural circuit in the brain for being smart.

06:08.840 --> 06:10.740
 Rather, there are neural circuits

06:10.740 --> 06:12.080
 that are responsible for focus,

06:12.080 --> 06:13.920
 neural circuits for creativity,

06:13.920 --> 06:16.840
 neural circuits for task switching, and so on and so on.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.760
 Fortunately, Thesus understands this

06:18.760 --> 06:20.320
 and has developed custom nootropics

06:20.320 --> 06:21.980
 that are tailored to your specific goals

06:21.980 --> 06:23.560
 and your specific needs.

06:23.560 --> 06:26.400
 They use only the highest quality ingredients,

06:26.400 --> 06:28.860
 things of the sort that we'll talk about in today's podcast,

06:28.860 --> 06:31.360
 things like alpha-GPC, phosphatidylserine,

06:31.360 --> 06:33.000
 ginkgo biloba, et cetera.

06:33.000 --> 06:35.420
 However, I should mention that they are customized to you.

06:35.420 --> 06:37.800
 So you can go to Thesus, take a brief quiz,

06:37.800 --> 06:40.240
 and you can get a nootropic starter kit

06:40.240 --> 06:42.160
 that will allow you to try various nootropics

06:42.160 --> 06:43.960
 and determine which ones you like and work for you

06:43.960 --> 06:44.920
 and which ones don't.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.240
 I've been using Thesus nootropics customized for me

06:47.240 --> 06:48.520
 for close to six months now

06:48.520 --> 06:50.420
 and can confidently say that their nootropics

06:50.420 --> 06:52.200
 have been a total game changer.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.600
 My go-to formula is the clarity formula.

06:54.600 --> 06:56.240
 I like to use that before cognitive work,

06:56.240 --> 06:58.720
 and I use the energy formula before my workouts.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.600
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

07:00.600 --> 07:03.400
 go online to takethesus.com slash Huberman,

07:03.400 --> 07:04.640
 take that three-minute quiz,

07:04.640 --> 07:06.520
 and Thesus will send you four different formulas

07:06.520 --> 07:07.640
 to try in your first month.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.280
 Again, that's takethesus.com slash Huberman

07:10.280 --> 07:12.160
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

07:12.160 --> 07:14.380
 to get 10% off your first box.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.840
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.320
 Element is an electrolyte drink

07:18.320 --> 07:19.600
 that has all the things you need

07:19.600 --> 07:21.000
 and none of what you don't.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.280
 That means the electrolytes, salt, magnesium,

07:23.280 --> 07:27.080
 and potassium are in there, but it does not have sugar.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.520
 Electrolytes are key to cellular function,

07:29.520 --> 07:31.920
 in particular, neuronal or nerve cell function.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.180
 In fact, for your nerve cells

07:33.180 --> 07:35.000
 to be able to fire action potentials,

07:35.000 --> 07:36.560
 those are the electrical signals

07:36.560 --> 07:38.400
 that allow your brain and body to work

07:38.400 --> 07:40.680
 and move and think, et cetera, you need sodium.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.160
 A lot of people don't realize that.

07:42.160 --> 07:43.540
 And while, of course, there are people out there

07:43.540 --> 07:45.480
 that need to reduce their sodium intake,

07:45.480 --> 07:48.160
 these would be people with pre-hypertension or hypertension,

07:48.160 --> 07:50.040
 many people actually don't get enough sodium,

07:50.040 --> 07:52.800
 especially people that are following low carbohydrate diets,

07:52.800 --> 07:55.800
 drinking a lot of caffeine, or eating extremely clean.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.720
 Oftentimes, those people feel better

07:57.720 --> 07:59.160
 when they increase their sodium intake

07:59.160 --> 08:00.380
 and their health can actually improve

08:00.380 --> 08:01.860
 when they increase their sodium intake.

08:01.860 --> 08:03.880
 Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio

08:03.880 --> 08:06.420
 of one gram of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,

08:06.420 --> 08:08.360
 and 60 milligrams of magnesium.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.960
 If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,

08:10.960 --> 08:13.440
 that's lmnt.com slash Huberman,

08:13.440 --> 08:15.740
 to claim a free Element sample pack with any purchase.

08:15.740 --> 08:19.400
 Again, that's Drink Element, lmnt.com slash Huberman.

08:19.400 --> 08:21.980
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.

08:21.980 --> 08:23.520
 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

08:23.520 --> 08:26.520
 with heating, cooling, and sleep tracking capacity.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.880
 The reality is that sleep is the foundation

08:28.880 --> 08:31.400
 of mental health, physical health, and performance.

08:31.400 --> 08:32.840
 Now, I've talked before in this podcast

08:32.840 --> 08:34.980
 about the fact that there's a direct relationship

08:34.980 --> 08:38.120
 between temperature and our ability to fall and stay asleep.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.840
 In fact, our body temperature needs to drop

08:39.840 --> 08:42.400
 by about one to three degrees in order to fall asleep.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.460
 And then there are further decreases in our body temperature

08:45.460 --> 08:47.740
 that allow us to get into the deepest stages of sleep

08:47.740 --> 08:49.980
 and the so-called rapid eye movement, sleep,

08:49.980 --> 08:51.000
 all the aspects of sleep

08:51.000 --> 08:52.920
 that really restore our brain and body.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.200
 And then waking up actually involves a heating up

08:55.200 --> 08:56.740
 of core body temperature.

08:56.740 --> 08:58.800
 By sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover,

08:58.800 --> 09:00.360
 you're able to control the temperature

09:00.360 --> 09:02.320
 of your sleeping environment precisely.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.700
 I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover

09:04.700 --> 09:05.960
 for many months now,

09:05.960 --> 09:08.480
 and I can tell you it has completely changed my sleep.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.200
 I thought I was sleeping pretty well before,

09:10.200 --> 09:12.420
 and now, frankly, I don't even want to travel

09:12.420 --> 09:13.920
 because I don't want to be away from my Eight Sleep.

09:13.920 --> 09:17.320
 I can't wait until hotels and Airbnbs include Eight Sleep.

09:17.320 --> 09:18.320
 If you want to try Eight Sleep,

09:18.320 --> 09:20.600
 you can go to EightSleep.com slash Huberman

09:20.600 --> 09:22.620

09:25.440 --> 09:27.080
 now through September 11th.

09:27.080 --> 09:29.440
 Eight Sleep currently ships within the USA, Canada,

09:29.440 --> 09:30.580

09:30.580 --> 09:32.920
 Again, that's EightSleep.com slash Huberman

09:32.920 --> 09:35.440
 to save $250 off an Eight Sleep cover

09:35.440 --> 09:37.480
 now through September 11th.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.280
 Okay, let's talk about focus and concentration

09:40.280 --> 09:43.020
 and how you can improve your focus and concentration

09:43.020 --> 09:45.600
 using science-based protocols.

09:45.600 --> 09:48.360
 Now, because today's episode is mainly focused on tools

09:48.360 --> 09:50.780
 and not so much the underlying mechanisms,

09:50.780 --> 09:52.840
 I'm mainly going to focus on what to do and when

09:52.840 --> 09:54.120
 and how to do it.

09:54.120 --> 09:56.440
 But I just want to take about three minutes

09:56.440 --> 09:59.600
 and briefly describe a model that is a visual image

09:59.600 --> 10:01.360
 that you can put in your mind

10:01.360 --> 10:04.400
 that will help you incorporate the tools that I'll provide

10:04.400 --> 10:06.580
 and that generally will help you understand

10:06.580 --> 10:10.480
 at a mechanistic level how focus and concentration work.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.640
 So what I want you to imagine is an arrow.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.840
 And an arrow, of course, has an arrow head

10:15.840 --> 10:18.160
 and it has the shaft of that arrow.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.400
 And in the context of the neuroscience

10:20.400 --> 10:22.360
 of focus and concentration,

10:22.360 --> 10:25.440
 the neurochemical system that really represents

10:25.440 --> 10:28.360
 the shaft of that arrow, right, the straight line,

10:28.360 --> 10:30.760
 is epinephrine, also called adrenaline.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.480
 And today I'll refer to adrenaline

10:32.480 --> 10:34.200
 and epinephrine interchangeably.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.460
 It turns out that epinephrine slash adrenaline

10:36.460 --> 10:39.360
 are released within your brain from a little location,

10:39.360 --> 10:41.280
 a little cluster of neurons called locus coeruleus,

10:41.280 --> 10:43.320
 but you do not need to remember that name,

10:43.320 --> 10:46.400
 and from your body from the adrenal glands.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.600
 And the release of epinephrine from those two locations

10:50.600 --> 10:54.400
 overall increases energy, it increases alertness.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.520
 It does not alone increase focus, okay?

10:57.520 --> 11:01.320
 So the reason I've assigned epinephrine, adrenaline,

11:01.320 --> 11:05.560
 as the shaft of the arrow is that if focus is the arrow,

11:05.560 --> 11:08.640
 there is no focus without epinephrine.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.240
 So things, whether or not they're behavioral

11:11.240 --> 11:15.080
 or psychological or supplements or drugs

11:15.080 --> 11:18.440
 that increase epinephrine allow focus to occur.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.200
 They are necessary for focus,

11:20.200 --> 11:22.540
 but they are not sufficient for focus.

11:22.540 --> 11:23.640
 That is, they are required,

11:23.640 --> 11:26.220
 but they are not enough to create focus.

11:26.220 --> 11:28.680
 So we're going to need epinephrine in the equation.

11:28.680 --> 11:33.200
 Without epinephrine, there is no focus or concentration.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.540
 Now, the arrowhead on this metaphorical arrowhead

11:37.540 --> 11:39.680
 that represents focus and concentration

11:39.680 --> 11:42.980
 is going to be represented or related to the mechanisms

11:42.980 --> 11:46.060
 of acetylcholine, a different neurochemical

11:46.060 --> 11:47.520
 that also exists in the brain and body.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.000
 In fact, in the body, it's responsible

11:49.000 --> 11:51.600
 for the contraction and movement of your muscles.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.320
 But today we're talking about acetylcholine

11:53.320 --> 11:55.280
 not in that context, but rather in the context

11:55.280 --> 11:57.040
 of it's released within the brain.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.680
 Acetylcholine is released from a couple

11:58.680 --> 12:00.080
 of different locations in the brain.

12:00.080 --> 12:03.400
 And the best way to think about it is it's like a spotlight.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.500
 It highlights specific neurons, nerve cells,

12:06.500 --> 12:09.000
 that should be active or more active, I should say,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.900
 than the other neurons in the environment.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.720
 So the reason I've assigned the arrowhead

12:13.720 --> 12:17.240
 to acetylcholine and acetylcholine to the arrowhead

12:17.240 --> 12:20.880
 is that if you have an arrow with a very big arrowhead

12:20.880 --> 12:22.560
 that's really broad, really blunt,

12:22.560 --> 12:24.600
 imagine a mile wide arrowhead,

12:24.600 --> 12:26.520
 that's not very focused on any one location.

12:26.520 --> 12:29.200
 It's not really pointing to any one location, is it?

12:29.200 --> 12:33.440
 But with a narrow, really tightly focused arrowhead,

12:33.440 --> 12:35.420
 well, that's focused on one location.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.740
 So we have alertness, epinephrine,

12:37.740 --> 12:40.600
 and then we have the actual direction

12:40.600 --> 12:43.660
 in which our concentration and focus is placed.

12:43.660 --> 12:46.040
 And that's, at least in this mental model,

12:46.040 --> 12:47.720
 I'm creating acetylcholine.

12:47.720 --> 12:51.920
 And then in order to have ongoing focus,

12:51.920 --> 12:53.440
 we need another neurochemical.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.580
 And it turns out that that third neurochemical is dopamine,

12:56.580 --> 13:00.000
 a molecule often associated with pleasure and reward,

13:00.000 --> 13:03.200
 but it's really the molecule of motivation.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.480
 So here, I want you to imagine in your mind an arrow

13:05.480 --> 13:08.320
 with an arrowhead, think acetylcholine in the arrowhead,

13:08.320 --> 13:10.600
 a shaft or a line behind that arrowhead,

13:10.600 --> 13:13.080
 which is epinephrine, also called adrenaline,

13:13.080 --> 13:15.240
 and then behind it, a sort of an engine

13:15.240 --> 13:17.420
 that keeps that focus moving forward, right?

13:17.420 --> 13:19.680
 Because we don't just want to be focused for a moment,

13:19.680 --> 13:22.480
 we want to be able to focus for 10 minutes or for an hour,

13:22.480 --> 13:24.160
 or maybe even for two hours.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.140
 Turns out there's an optimal duration to focus,

13:26.140 --> 13:28.040
 I'll teach you that in just a little bit.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.960
 But these three neurochemicals together,

13:29.960 --> 13:32.120
 acetylcholine, epinephrine, and dopamine,

13:32.120 --> 13:37.120
 really allow you to get focused, to focus very precisely,

13:37.840 --> 13:40.600
 and in fact, increasingly precisely over time

13:40.600 --> 13:42.520
 to really narrow and narrow and narrow your focus

13:42.520 --> 13:45.400
 progressively within a single bout of focus,

13:45.400 --> 13:47.000
 and to continue to do that

13:47.000 --> 13:49.560
 and to be able to do that repeatedly whenever you want.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.780
 So here, I'm purely talking in metaphor

13:51.780 --> 13:53.960
 and in models and mental models of arrows,

13:53.960 --> 13:54.800
 but in a moment or two,

13:54.800 --> 13:57.120
 I'll start transitioning to discussing tools

13:57.120 --> 13:59.320
 in which I'll talk about increasing dopamine

13:59.320 --> 14:02.520
 and acetylcholine, or increasing epinephrine and dopamine

14:02.520 --> 14:05.200
 in various combinations with various approaches.

14:05.200 --> 14:07.320
 And what I'd like you to conceptualize

14:07.320 --> 14:09.080
 is how those are contributing

14:09.080 --> 14:11.720
 to creating a very narrowly pointed arrow

14:11.720 --> 14:14.040
 that has the capacity to continue moving forward

14:14.040 --> 14:16.680
 over and over so that you can focus as sharply

14:16.680 --> 14:18.580
 and as long as you like.

14:18.580 --> 14:19.600
 And of course, for those of you

14:19.600 --> 14:21.580
 that want to get really down in the weeds

14:21.580 --> 14:22.800
 of how dopamine works,

14:22.800 --> 14:25.240
 we have an entire episode about dopamine motivation

14:25.240 --> 14:27.960
 and drive that really gets into neurotransmitter release

14:27.960 --> 14:30.000
 and dopamine baselines and thresholds

14:30.000 --> 14:31.640
 and all of that sort of thing.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.480
 We also have episodes on focus,

14:34.480 --> 14:36.600
 much longer episodes, I should say, on focus,

14:36.600 --> 14:39.160
 that incorporate a lot of the biology of acetylcholine.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.000
 It turns out acetylcholine

14:40.000 --> 14:42.320
 is also involved in neuroplasticity, et cetera.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.840
 And epinephrine, of course, relates to stress

14:44.840 --> 14:47.080
 and our capacity to deal with and buffer stress

14:47.080 --> 14:48.380
 and on and on.

14:48.380 --> 14:51.320
 Those episodes are all available to you in their long form

14:51.320 --> 14:53.000
 at hubermanlab.com.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.000
 You can find them very easily.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.160
 They are all timestamps.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.840
 You can navigate to the particular topics

14:56.840 --> 14:57.960
 most of interest to you.

14:57.960 --> 15:00.000
 I mentioned this all not as a diversion

15:00.000 --> 15:01.400
 from what we want to cover today,

15:01.400 --> 15:02.720
 but I know that some of you are hungry

15:02.720 --> 15:04.180
 for a lot more mechanism,

15:04.180 --> 15:06.880
 but today's episode is really mainly focused on the tools.

15:06.880 --> 15:09.220
 I will, of course, touch on mechanism,

15:09.220 --> 15:11.440
 but if you really want to do the deep dive on mechanism,

15:11.440 --> 15:13.800
 go to hubermanlab.com and you'll have more

15:13.800 --> 15:16.800
 than you ever could want about those mechanisms.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.380
 Let's jump into the tools for concentration and focus.

15:20.380 --> 15:23.700
 If you want to think about tools of any kind

15:23.700 --> 15:26.920
 to modify your biology or physiology in any way,

15:26.920 --> 15:28.200
 whether or not it's for cognitive function

15:28.200 --> 15:29.720
 or you want to get better at exercising

15:29.720 --> 15:30.560
 or you want to build muscle

15:30.560 --> 15:32.160
 or you want to improve your hormones,

15:32.160 --> 15:35.560
 you need to think and understand tools

15:35.560 --> 15:38.960
 in the context of modulation and mediation.

15:38.960 --> 15:39.840
 What do I mean by that?

15:39.840 --> 15:42.480
 Well, it's quite simple, really.

15:42.480 --> 15:46.560
 Mediation is how specific types of chemicals and cells

15:46.560 --> 15:49.840
 and circuits and organs control very specific things

15:49.840 --> 15:51.080
 in your brain and body.

15:51.080 --> 15:54.400
 Whereas modulation is the ability of chemicals

15:54.400 --> 15:58.940
 and cells and circuits to adjust how different things change,

15:58.940 --> 16:01.040
 how different things work in your brain and body,

16:01.040 --> 16:02.660
 but to do it more broadly.

16:02.660 --> 16:03.500
 What do I mean by this?

16:03.500 --> 16:04.780
 Let me give an example.

16:04.780 --> 16:07.560
 For instance, I'm going to tell you now

16:07.560 --> 16:11.360
 that one of the most important things to build

16:11.360 --> 16:14.040
 and maintain your focus and concentration

16:14.040 --> 16:17.320
 is to optimize your sleeping behavior.

16:17.320 --> 16:20.000
 That is to get enough quality sleep,

16:20.000 --> 16:22.080
 I would say 80% of the nights of your life.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.400
 Not everyone can get optimal sleep 100%

16:24.400 --> 16:25.240
 of the nights of their life.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.280
 Nobody, truly nobody achieves that.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.040
 However, sleep has been shown to relate

16:31.040 --> 16:33.800
 to cognitive performance, physical performance,

16:33.800 --> 16:36.640
 hormone output, and so many other things,

16:36.640 --> 16:38.400
 including immune system function.

16:38.400 --> 16:42.520
 What we can reliably say is that sleep modulates

16:42.520 --> 16:45.880
 just about every process in your brain and body.

16:45.880 --> 16:47.120
 So you have to get great sleep.

16:47.120 --> 16:50.260
 There's simply no tool that's going to allow you

16:50.260 --> 16:53.060
 to overcome chronic sleep deprivation

16:53.060 --> 16:54.560
 and allow you to remain focused.

16:54.560 --> 16:58.840
 No pill, no device, no supplement, no protocol whatsoever.

16:58.840 --> 17:01.000
 There are tools to overcome one night

17:01.000 --> 17:02.600
 or maybe two nights of sleep deprivation,

17:02.600 --> 17:04.040
 and we'll talk about those.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.560
 But at a fundamental level,

17:06.560 --> 17:09.160
 we need to do the things that modulate our focus

17:09.160 --> 17:11.200
 and attention in powerful ways,

17:11.200 --> 17:13.200
 and sleep really is that thing.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.200
 So we've done two episodes, one called Master Your Sleep,

17:16.200 --> 17:18.920
 and the other episode is Perfect Your Sleep.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.260
 The Perfect Your Sleep is a little bit more

17:20.260 --> 17:22.120
 like this episode, more focused on protocols.

17:22.120 --> 17:24.460
 Master Your Sleep includes protocols and mechanism.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.200
 Again, you can find those at HubermanLab.com.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.020
 We also have a sleep toolkit,

17:28.020 --> 17:29.440
 a distilled list of things to do

17:29.440 --> 17:30.720
 in order to optimize your sleep.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.800
 I highly recommend that you download that.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.040
 You can go to HubermanLab.com,

17:34.040 --> 17:35.360
 go to the Neural Network newsletter.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.200
 It is listed there.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.680
 If you want, you can sign up for the newsletter,

17:37.680 --> 17:38.580
 but you don't have to.

17:38.580 --> 17:41.080
 You can simply download the PDF of that toolkit

17:41.080 --> 17:42.880
 for zero cost.

17:42.880 --> 17:45.960
 Why do I say sleep modulates focus and attention?

17:45.960 --> 17:47.920
 Well, I'll give an analogy.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.840
 If right now someone pulled a fire alarm in this building,

17:50.840 --> 17:52.140
 or if we had a fire in this building,

17:52.140 --> 17:54.120
 my attention would drift.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.240
 It would not be on recording this podcast.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.800
 It would be on something else.

17:57.800 --> 18:01.120
 But would I say that the fire alarm mediates attention?

18:01.120 --> 18:03.520
 I mean, fire alarms are not really involved in attention.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.680
 No, rather they modulate my attention.

18:06.680 --> 18:08.920
 The noise in the room modulates my attention.

18:08.920 --> 18:10.320
 That's quite a bit different

18:10.320 --> 18:11.660
 than a tool that I'll provide later,

18:11.660 --> 18:13.220
 and I'll just give you a little hint of now.

18:13.220 --> 18:14.600
 In fact, I'll give it to you now,

18:14.600 --> 18:17.720
 which is that 40 hertz binaural beats

18:17.720 --> 18:20.040
 have been shown in a number of peer-reviewed studies

18:20.040 --> 18:22.420
 to increase focus and concentration.

18:22.420 --> 18:25.360
 And if you'd like to access 40 hertz binaural beats

18:25.360 --> 18:27.740
 in order to improve your focus and concentration,

18:27.740 --> 18:28.580
 you can do that.

18:28.580 --> 18:30.200
 You can actually get it at zero cost.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.240
 You can go into the App Store.

18:32.240 --> 18:34.040
 For instance, the Apple App Store.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.660
 This is also available for Android phone.

18:35.660 --> 18:37.940
 There's an app called Brainwave, and you can go there.

18:37.940 --> 18:39.580
 You can dial in 40 hertz,

18:39.580 --> 18:41.500
 and it'll play these binaural beats.

18:41.500 --> 18:43.920
 It's been shown in multiple quality peer-reviewed studies

18:43.920 --> 18:45.720
 that playing a pattern of sound waves

18:45.720 --> 18:47.320
 to one ear, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

18:47.320 --> 18:49.660
 and the other ear, which is slightly offset in frequency,

18:49.660 --> 18:51.000
 meaning not quite the same frequency,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.580
 so more like doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,

18:52.580 --> 18:54.240
 that that combination of frequencies

18:54.240 --> 18:56.340
 played to the different ears

18:56.340 --> 18:59.280
 actually get integrated within deep brain centers

18:59.280 --> 19:01.440
 and can increase focus and concentration

19:01.440 --> 19:04.000
 in part by increasing levels

19:04.000 --> 19:06.360
 of the neurochemical dopamine and acetylcholine,

19:06.360 --> 19:07.740
 which we talked about a little bit earlier

19:07.740 --> 19:09.920
 in this aero model of focus.

19:09.920 --> 19:12.840
 So we'll provide a link to that app.

19:12.840 --> 19:15.900
 I don't have any relationship to that app I should mention,

19:15.900 --> 19:16.760
 but it's an excellent one.

19:16.760 --> 19:18.160
 It's one that I've used for many years.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.560
 There are also additional functions within the app,

19:20.560 --> 19:22.680
 such as for sleep and for other things,

19:22.680 --> 19:27.420
 but the 40 hertz, 40HZ, is the way it reads out.

19:27.420 --> 19:29.400
 40 hertz stimulation has been shown

19:29.400 --> 19:31.440
 to improve focus and concentration.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.600
 Here is my recommendation in the way that I use it.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.320
 I would not use 40 hertz binaural beats

19:36.320 --> 19:38.620
 every time I'm doing a bout of work.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.120
 What I tend to do is use it for about five minutes

19:41.120 --> 19:45.160
 prior to that work and then turn it off and then do the work

19:45.160 --> 19:47.780
 and I'll talk about other tools to use during that work,

19:47.780 --> 19:49.000
 whether or not it's reading or math

19:49.000 --> 19:50.360
 or even just emailing or something

19:50.360 --> 19:53.380
 where I require a bunch of focus for awhile.

19:53.380 --> 19:56.320
 However, there are times in which I'm in an area

19:56.320 --> 19:58.600
 or I'm in a state of mind where I'm feeling very distractible

19:58.600 --> 20:00.400
 and then I'll keep the 40 hertz binaural beats

20:00.400 --> 20:04.260
 on the entire time I'm doing that bout of cognitive work.

20:04.260 --> 20:06.360
 I'll also sometimes use the 40 hertz binaural beats

20:06.360 --> 20:08.400
 prior to a workout, in particular weight workouts

20:08.400 --> 20:09.880
 where I really want to be able to focus on

20:09.880 --> 20:11.440
 and contract specific muscles.

20:11.440 --> 20:13.000
 So it's a very useful tool,

20:13.000 --> 20:15.620
 again, supported by quality peer-reviewed science,

20:15.620 --> 20:17.600
 zero cost available out there,

20:17.600 --> 20:20.520
 not just in the Brainwave app, but in multiple apps.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.980
 I think many of you will benefit from it.

20:22.980 --> 20:25.320
 Some of you might not experience it immediately

20:25.320 --> 20:28.400
 as a total dropping into a tunnel of focus

20:28.400 --> 20:30.440
 in the same way that you might with say,

20:31.320 --> 20:33.200
 the sorts of neurochemicals that we'll talk about later,

20:33.200 --> 20:35.300
 like alpha GPC and some of these other things

20:35.300 --> 20:37.600
 that change neurochemicals directly,

20:37.600 --> 20:39.960
 but nonetheless, 40 hertz binaural beats

20:39.960 --> 20:41.320
 are a very powerful tool,

20:41.320 --> 20:43.580
 again, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool

20:43.580 --> 20:45.440
 that tap into your own endogenous,

20:45.440 --> 20:49.040
 meaning within you or exists within you physiology

20:49.040 --> 20:50.640
 in order to increase acetylcholine

20:50.640 --> 20:51.960
 and some other neurochemicals

20:51.960 --> 20:54.600
 and they have been shown to work quite well.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.640
 Okay, so assuming that you are sleeping well

20:56.640 --> 20:58.020
 80% of the nights of your life

20:58.020 --> 21:01.720
 or at least working on the various protocols and tools

21:01.720 --> 21:04.540
 to sleep well and sufficiently long,

21:04.540 --> 21:06.500
 80% of the nights of your life,

21:06.500 --> 21:09.420
 and you are interested in additional tools

21:09.420 --> 21:11.040
 that are sound-based

21:11.040 --> 21:14.460
 in order to improve your ability to concentrate and focus.

21:14.460 --> 21:16.840
 There are quality peer-reviewed studies

21:16.840 --> 21:20.280
 supporting the idea that white noise or pink noise,

21:20.280 --> 21:22.120
 and believe it or not, there is something called pink noise.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.200
 It has to do with the specific frequencies of sound

21:25.200 --> 21:27.560
 that are in the noise.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.360
 Well, white noise and pink noise

21:29.360 --> 21:33.360
 have been shown to not improve concentration per se,

21:33.360 --> 21:35.840
 but to improve people's ability to transition

21:35.840 --> 21:37.900
 into concentrated states.

21:37.900 --> 21:40.040
 So I don't tend to use white noise and pink noise

21:40.040 --> 21:42.380
 while I work, but I know a number of people that do.

21:42.380 --> 21:45.120
 I know people that also use what's called brown noise.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.040
 The folks I know from the engineering

21:47.040 --> 21:49.840
 and computer science side get really into these details

21:49.840 --> 21:51.660
 of white noise, pink noise, brown noise.

21:51.660 --> 21:54.140
 You can find white noise, pink noise, or brown noise

21:54.140 --> 21:57.280
 and listen to it through headphones or in the room.

21:57.280 --> 22:00.480
 There is indeed some data to support the fact

22:00.480 --> 22:02.680
 that white noise and to some extent pink noise

22:02.680 --> 22:04.540
 and brown noise can support the release

22:04.540 --> 22:05.620
 of particular neurochemicals,

22:05.620 --> 22:09.280
 but more data showing that they can amplify the activity

22:09.280 --> 22:11.920
 of neurons in the so-called prefrontal cortex,

22:11.920 --> 22:13.480
 this front area, this sort of the bumper

22:13.480 --> 22:17.400
 behind your forehead that is directly related

22:17.400 --> 22:19.660
 to your ability to direct your own focus

22:19.660 --> 22:21.960
 and remain focused on certain things.

22:21.960 --> 22:26.540
 So you have the option of either using binaural beats before

22:26.540 --> 22:29.360
 but not during your work, that is 40 hertz binaural beats

22:29.360 --> 22:31.060
 or 40 hertz binaural beats

22:31.060 --> 22:33.980
 throughout your attempt to focus.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.880
 You also have the option of not using binaural beats

22:36.880 --> 22:39.440
 but using white noise, pink noise, or brown noise.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.500
 Again, there are a lot of zero cost apps.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.640
 You can find also white noise, pink noise,

22:43.640 --> 22:45.320
 and brown noise on YouTube.

22:45.320 --> 22:48.080
 Again, these are tools that really have been shown

22:48.080 --> 22:51.460
 over and over in humans to allow people to focus

22:51.460 --> 22:53.440
 with more depth and to decrease

22:53.440 --> 22:55.520
 the transition time into focus.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.620
 This is a really key point.

22:56.620 --> 22:58.060
 A lot of people are challenged

22:58.060 --> 23:00.660
 with getting into a mode of focus.

23:00.660 --> 23:03.880
 None of us, however, should be expected to just sit down

23:03.880 --> 23:05.740
 and drop directly into a state of focus.

23:05.740 --> 23:09.600
 I think that's completely an unfair request of ourselves.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.120
 I mean, for instance, you wouldn't expect yourself

23:11.120 --> 23:14.240
 to go out on the track or go out for a run and not warm up.

23:14.240 --> 23:15.360
 You might jog for a few minutes

23:15.360 --> 23:16.840
 or even walk before you would jog

23:16.840 --> 23:18.620
 and then jog before you would run, right?

23:18.620 --> 23:20.020
 I would hope you would do that.

23:20.020 --> 23:21.760
 And if you're doing resistance training,

23:21.760 --> 23:23.360
 I doubt that you go over and load up the bar

23:23.360 --> 23:24.840
 or the machine with the maximum amount of weight

23:24.840 --> 23:26.280
 that you can move and then just drop right into that.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.160
 You always do a warmup.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.680
 And I think it's very important to understand mental work,

23:29.680 --> 23:32.640
 focus, and concentration as requiring that warmup.

23:32.640 --> 23:34.140
 What is that warmup?

23:34.140 --> 23:36.340
 Well, you know what that warmup is.

23:36.340 --> 23:40.120
 That warmup is the ramping up or the increase

23:40.120 --> 23:45.120
 of epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, and dopamine.

23:46.180 --> 23:48.300
 The way that neurochemicals work is we don't just get

23:48.300 --> 23:50.340
 to flip switches in our brain because we decide to.

23:50.340 --> 23:51.180
 That's a fantasy.

23:51.180 --> 23:55.320
 That's sort of the limitless movie or movies and ideas

23:55.320 --> 23:57.000
 that suddenly you're going to flip a switch on your arm

23:57.000 --> 23:58.840
 and all of a sudden you're going to be in a laser focus.

23:58.840 --> 24:01.440
 That is just not the way that your nervous system works.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.820
 There's a gradual dropping into any state,

24:03.820 --> 24:05.240
 whether or not that state is sleep, right?

24:05.240 --> 24:06.720
 You go from shallow sleep to deep sleep

24:06.720 --> 24:08.520
 and then out eventually.

24:08.520 --> 24:11.860
 Focus too, you go from shallow focus

24:11.860 --> 24:13.720
 to increasingly deep focus.

24:13.720 --> 24:18.680
 That is in our metaphor of the arrow, it's very broad.

24:18.680 --> 24:19.780
 It's pointed at a lot of things.

24:19.780 --> 24:21.520
 And over time, as we drop into focus,

24:21.520 --> 24:24.220
 that arrow is narrowing and narrowing and narrowing.

24:24.220 --> 24:26.800
 In fact, probably better to think about it narrowing

24:26.800 --> 24:29.920
 and then sometimes oscillating and getting wider again.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.720
 You know, we might hear something down the hallway

24:31.720 --> 24:34.240
 or more typically our phone will buzz or we'll think,

24:34.240 --> 24:35.520
 oh, I wonder what so-and-so is doing

24:35.520 --> 24:37.600
 or I hadn't contacted them about something.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.920
 Your focus is dynamic.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.720
 It is not what we call a step function.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.640
 It's not like you go from unfocused to focused

24:43.640 --> 24:45.880
 and then you drop into your maximal focus.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.040
 By understanding that it's dynamic,

24:48.040 --> 24:50.600
 by understanding that you are going to be continually going

24:50.600 --> 24:55.600
 in and out of progressively but varying levels of focus,

24:55.880 --> 24:58.920
 you will greatly release the pressure on yourself

24:58.920 --> 25:02.160
 to feel focused all the time when you want to be.

25:02.160 --> 25:03.000
 This is very key.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.520
 People who are very good at focusing understand this

25:05.520 --> 25:09.280
 and understand that they can't expect themselves

25:09.280 --> 25:10.560
 to just immediately focus

25:10.560 --> 25:13.220
 and then snap into or out of focus, okay?

25:13.220 --> 25:14.640
 So be patient with yourself

25:14.640 --> 25:17.820
 and also understand that focus is an ability,

25:17.820 --> 25:19.920
 that you can improve your ability to focus

25:19.920 --> 25:22.040
 by engaging the neural circuits responsible

25:22.040 --> 25:24.280
 for focus repeatedly over time

25:24.280 --> 25:25.640
 through so-called neuroplasticity,

25:25.640 --> 25:27.800
 the ability of your nervous system to change

25:27.800 --> 25:28.840
 in response to experience.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.680
 And that has a couple of different components,

25:30.680 --> 25:32.000
 but put very simply,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.680
 what we repeat gets etched into our nervous system

25:34.680 --> 25:36.520
 and becomes easier over time.

25:36.520 --> 25:40.000
 And the more emotionally important

25:40.000 --> 25:41.680
 or vital something feels to us,

25:41.680 --> 25:43.560
 the more likely it is to trigger neuroplasticity.

25:43.560 --> 25:44.520
 We're going to talk a little bit more

25:44.520 --> 25:46.600
 about how to increase neural circuits for focus later,

25:46.600 --> 25:49.440
 but right now, what you have in hand is the key importance

25:49.440 --> 25:51.440
 of sleep, and I, again, will direct you

25:51.440 --> 25:53.800
 to HubermanLab.com and the Neural Network Newsletter

25:53.800 --> 25:57.400
 to really work on optimizing your sleep.

25:57.400 --> 26:01.080
 We've also got two auditory sound-based tools

26:01.080 --> 26:01.920
 for improving focus.

26:01.920 --> 26:04.160
 There's 40 hertz binaural beats used before

26:04.160 --> 26:06.600
 or during bouts of focus and concentration.

26:06.600 --> 26:09.300
 And if you don't like those, or even if you do,

26:09.300 --> 26:10.400
 you might alternate them with

26:10.400 --> 26:13.080
 or occasionally use white noise, pink noise, or brown noise,

26:13.080 --> 26:15.240
 also readily available at zero cost.

26:15.240 --> 26:18.300
 A question I often get is how long should I try to focus?

26:18.300 --> 26:20.820
 Well, the research literature point to the key importance

26:20.820 --> 26:22.520
 of so-called ultradian cycles.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.280
 You've all probably heard of circadian cycles

26:25.280 --> 26:27.880
 or circadian biology, circa the day,

26:27.880 --> 26:30.720
 circadian is about 24 hour cycle.

26:30.720 --> 26:33.800
 Well, our brain and body operate within that day

26:33.800 --> 26:36.680
 or within each and every day, I should say,

26:36.680 --> 26:39.360
 with 90 minute ultradian cycles.

26:39.360 --> 26:41.920
 So my suggestion would be anytime you're going to sit down

26:41.920 --> 26:43.360
 and try and focus, you're going to try

26:43.360 --> 26:45.620
 and do a focused bout of physical exercise

26:45.620 --> 26:47.660
 or skill learning or musical learning,

26:47.660 --> 26:49.320
 or maybe you're even just having a conversation.

26:49.320 --> 26:51.280
 Maybe you're a therapist or you're attending therapy

26:51.280 --> 26:53.160
 or a class, how long should it be?

26:53.160 --> 26:56.020
 And the ideal duration is about 90 minutes,

26:56.020 --> 26:57.580
 not exactly 90 minutes,

26:57.580 --> 27:00.880
 but we can reliably say 90 minutes or less, okay?

27:00.880 --> 27:02.840
 It doesn't have to be the full 90 minutes,

27:02.840 --> 27:04.760
 but trying to push yourself to be able to drop

27:04.760 --> 27:07.540
 into two hours of focus or three hours of focus

27:07.540 --> 27:11.200
 while possible is not really in line

27:11.200 --> 27:13.240
 with what we know about the underlying biology.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.080
 Everything from our sleep states

27:15.080 --> 27:16.780
 or the different stages of sleep

27:16.780 --> 27:18.460
 and our waking states is divided

27:18.460 --> 27:21.520
 into these 90 minute cycles or so-called ultradian cycles.

27:21.520 --> 27:24.200
 So what I like to do is set a timer for 90 minutes.

27:24.200 --> 27:26.200
 I acknowledge and accept the fact

27:26.200 --> 27:27.900
 that under most conditions,

27:27.900 --> 27:29.920
 unless I'm really pressed for a deadline

27:29.920 --> 27:32.140
 and I'm optimally caffeinated, et cetera,

27:32.140 --> 27:34.640
 the first five to 10 minutes of that 90 minutes

27:34.640 --> 27:35.720
 are a transition time.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.100
 It's like the warmup for focus,

27:37.100 --> 27:39.080
 but I do include it in that 90 minutes.

27:39.080 --> 27:40.600
 And then I really try and drop

27:40.600 --> 27:44.480
 into doing focused mental work or learning of some sort.

27:44.480 --> 27:45.940
 Again, this could be physical as well,

27:45.940 --> 27:47.120
 motor skill learning,

27:47.120 --> 27:49.680
 or I think we're running or lifting weights, et cetera,

27:49.680 --> 27:52.540
 and really try and drop into that across the full 90 minutes

27:52.540 --> 27:54.880
 again, accepting the fact, okay?

27:54.880 --> 27:55.760
 It's not just an idea,

27:55.760 --> 27:58.800
 the fact that occasionally our focus will flicker.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.120
 It will jump out of focus.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.840
 And then a big part of being able to focus

28:01.840 --> 28:03.080
 is to go back to focusing.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.400
 The way I'd like you to conceptualize this perhaps

28:05.400 --> 28:07.820
 is that arrowhead suddenly getting very, very broad,

28:07.820 --> 28:09.080
 that you're focusing on many things

28:09.080 --> 28:12.260
 or that arrow shifts to a different location in the room.

28:12.260 --> 28:14.240
 The key is to be able to shift it back

28:14.240 --> 28:15.520
 and to narrow it once again.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.400
 And that's an active process,

28:17.400 --> 28:20.360
 so much so that it requires a lot of metabolic energy.

28:20.360 --> 28:25.360
 Your brain is the chief consumer of metabolic energy.

28:25.640 --> 28:26.840
 The calories that you consume

28:26.840 --> 28:28.160
 is so-called basal metabolic rate.

28:28.160 --> 28:29.700
 Most of that isn't related to movement

28:29.700 --> 28:30.680
 or heartbeat or breathing.

28:30.680 --> 28:32.520
 It's related to brain function.

28:32.520 --> 28:35.880
 Your brain is a glutton with respect to caloric need.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.800
 So understand that at the end of 90 minutes

28:37.800 --> 28:39.400
 or maybe even after 45 minutes,

28:39.400 --> 28:42.080
 you might feel rather tired or even exhausted.

28:42.080 --> 28:45.140
 And it's very important that after about a focus,

28:45.140 --> 28:46.880
 that you take at least 10 minutes

28:46.880 --> 28:48.960
 and ideally as long as 30 minutes

28:48.960 --> 28:51.620
 and go through what I call deliberate defocus.

28:51.620 --> 28:54.220
 You really want to focus on somewhat menial tasks

28:54.220 --> 28:55.800
 or things that really don't require

28:55.800 --> 28:57.880
 a ton of your concentration.

28:57.880 --> 29:00.040
 This is starting to become a little bit of a movement

29:00.040 --> 29:02.180
 out there in the kind of pop psychology

29:02.180 --> 29:04.000
 and optimization world.

29:04.000 --> 29:06.260
 This idea of not looking at your phone

29:06.260 --> 29:07.600
 as you walk down the hall to the bathroom,

29:07.600 --> 29:09.100
 certainly not looking at your phone in the bathroom.

29:09.100 --> 29:10.500
 And I should mention, by the way,

29:10.500 --> 29:12.680
 this is a particular annoyance of mine.

29:12.680 --> 29:15.600
 Have you noticed that wait times for restrooms

29:15.600 --> 29:17.560
 in public places has increased substantially

29:17.560 --> 29:18.800
 in the last 10 years?

29:18.800 --> 29:21.640
 The reason for that is not digestive, okay?

29:21.640 --> 29:23.160
 It's not the gut microbiome.

29:23.160 --> 29:24.640
 I mean, it might be the gut microbiome,

29:24.640 --> 29:26.440
 but chances are it's because people are on their phones

29:26.440 --> 29:27.280
 in the bathroom.

29:27.280 --> 29:30.040
 So you're doing yourself and everybody else a favor

29:30.040 --> 29:32.440
 by staying off your phone in the restroom,

29:32.440 --> 29:35.360
 staying off your phone while walking down the hall.

29:35.360 --> 29:38.440
 Try and give yourself some time to deliberately decompress,

29:38.440 --> 29:41.200
 to let your mental states idle,

29:41.200 --> 29:43.040
 to not be focused on any one thing.

29:43.040 --> 29:46.020
 That period of idling is essential

29:46.020 --> 29:47.400
 for your ability to focus,

29:47.400 --> 29:49.480
 much in the same way that rest between sets

29:49.480 --> 29:52.560
 of resistance training or rest between exercise

29:52.560 --> 29:55.240
 is vital to being able to focus and perform

29:55.240 --> 29:57.780
 during the actual sets or during the actual bouts

29:57.780 --> 30:00.080
 of running or cycling or whatever

30:00.080 --> 30:02.200
 your particular form of exercise might be.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.360
 So deliberate decompression is key.

30:04.360 --> 30:06.800
 And I know this is hard because we're all being drawn in

30:06.800 --> 30:11.160
 by the incredible rich array of sensory information

30:11.160 --> 30:13.480
 available on our phones and other devices,

30:13.480 --> 30:15.400
 but I can't emphasize this enough.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.920
 Our ability to focus is not just related

30:17.920 --> 30:19.800
 to what happens during the entry

30:19.800 --> 30:21.880
 and movement through those focus bouts,

30:21.880 --> 30:23.760
 but after those focus bouts,

30:23.760 --> 30:25.540
 we really need to deliberately decompress.

30:25.540 --> 30:27.320
 And of course, the ultimate decompress,

30:27.320 --> 30:29.400
 the time in which we are not directing our thinking

30:29.400 --> 30:30.840
 and our action is during sleep.

30:30.840 --> 30:32.240
 And so it's no wonder,

30:32.240 --> 30:34.240
 or I should say it holds together logically

30:34.240 --> 30:37.440
 that that deep long lasting duration

30:37.440 --> 30:39.960
 of not controlling where our mind is at

30:39.960 --> 30:42.480
 is in fact the ultimate form of restoration

30:42.480 --> 30:44.320
 even if we have very intense dreams.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.680
 So take that period after each 90 minute

30:46.680 --> 30:47.880
 or less focus bout, right?

30:47.880 --> 30:50.160
 Remember those focus bouts don't have to be full 90 minutes.

30:50.160 --> 30:51.880
 Let's say you do 45 minutes of work.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.140
 You're just done with it, set it down

30:53.140 --> 30:55.320
 and go do something for maybe five, 10,

30:55.320 --> 30:59.280
 maybe even 30 minutes that is functional for your day, right?

30:59.280 --> 31:00.940
 Just not just walking around in circles

31:00.940 --> 31:02.920
 or staring up at the sky, although if you can do that,

31:02.920 --> 31:05.260
 do that, but most of us have other things to do,

31:05.260 --> 31:06.900
 but do things that are rather automatic

31:06.900 --> 31:08.000
 or reflexive for you

31:08.000 --> 31:10.420
 and try not to do any focused reading,

31:10.420 --> 31:13.260
 try not to bring your vision into a tight location

31:13.260 --> 31:16.400
 such as your phone and try and deliberately decompress

31:16.400 --> 31:19.680
 because that will allow you to drop into intense bouts

31:19.680 --> 31:22.640
 of focus again repeatedly and repeatedly throughout the day.

31:22.640 --> 31:25.160
 I'm often asked how many ultradian cycles

31:25.160 --> 31:26.780
 one can perform throughout the day.

31:26.780 --> 31:28.760
 That depends on how well you've slept,

31:28.760 --> 31:29.880
 how well you are nourished,

31:29.880 --> 31:31.320
 which we'll talk about in a moment

31:31.320 --> 31:34.520
 and how well trained up your focus capacity is.

31:34.520 --> 31:37.040
 And here's the paradox.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.560
 If you are very trained at focusing,

31:39.560 --> 31:41.600
 if you're very good at dropping into focus,

31:41.600 --> 31:42.760
 you're actually going to need

31:42.760 --> 31:45.280
 more deliberate decompression and defocus.

31:45.280 --> 31:47.400
 And I recommend only doing about two,

31:47.400 --> 31:51.080
 maybe three deep work sessions per day.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.320
 So not one 90-minute session

31:53.320 --> 31:55.120
 then expecting yourself to do another one

31:55.120 --> 31:55.960
 and another one, another one,

31:55.960 --> 31:58.360
 but rather one deep work 90-minute session

31:58.360 --> 32:00.100
 and maybe another in the afternoon.

32:00.100 --> 32:01.900
 A lot of people get surprised by this and say,

32:01.900 --> 32:03.360
 wait, how many people can afford

32:03.360 --> 32:04.640
 to just work three hours a day?

32:04.640 --> 32:06.080
 I'm not saying just work three hours a day.

32:06.080 --> 32:08.360
 I'm really talking about the hard mental work.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.120
 And again, somewhat paradoxically,

32:11.120 --> 32:12.600
 the more you can concentrate,

32:12.600 --> 32:14.400
 the more deeply you can concentrate,

32:14.400 --> 32:16.840
 the fewer deep work concentration bouts

32:16.840 --> 32:19.200
 you can actually perform each day.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.440
 It makes sense, however,

32:20.440 --> 32:21.800
 if you think about it in the context of say,

32:21.800 --> 32:22.640
 resistance training,

32:22.640 --> 32:25.360
 if you are stronger and stronger in the gym

32:25.360 --> 32:26.720
 or you're an endurance athlete

32:26.720 --> 32:30.540
 and you can run ultra marathons 100 miles or so,

32:30.540 --> 32:33.760
 you are essentially cutting a deeper cut

32:33.760 --> 32:36.000
 into your recovery capacity

32:36.000 --> 32:38.260
 than somebody who's not very skilled at those things

32:38.260 --> 32:40.720
 or can't perform as much intense work.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.560
 So the intensity of the work scales directly

32:43.560 --> 32:46.080
 with how long you need to rest after that work.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.640
 I, at this stage of my life,

32:47.640 --> 32:49.540
 am pretty good at dropping into

32:49.540 --> 32:52.180
 and maintaining focus bouts of concentration,

32:52.180 --> 32:54.040
 provided the landscape of my life is right.

32:54.040 --> 32:55.600
 I don't have some burning, stressful thing

32:55.600 --> 32:58.040
 that's essential or an emergency that I'm tending to

32:58.040 --> 33:00.360
 and that I put my phone away or turn it off.

33:00.360 --> 33:03.880
 I can do three 90-minute focus bouts per day,

33:03.880 --> 33:04.920
 but that's about it.

33:04.920 --> 33:06.880
 And then in between those focus bouts,

33:06.880 --> 33:09.260
 I'm doing other things that require less focus.

33:09.260 --> 33:11.120
 Some of you may be able to perform four.

33:11.120 --> 33:15.060
 What I highly recommend is that you try doing at least one,

33:15.060 --> 33:18.520
 that is one 90-minute or less bout

33:18.520 --> 33:21.520
 of focused, concentrated work per day.

33:21.520 --> 33:23.080
 And yes, that means the weekends too.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.100
 And on the weekends, I like to read a book

33:25.100 --> 33:27.520
 with my phone nowhere in sight, not on a device.

33:27.520 --> 33:28.680
 That's what I do.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.320
 Or I'll listen to an audio book sometimes

33:30.320 --> 33:31.320
 while taking a walk,

33:31.320 --> 33:34.160
 but really concentrating on what I'm trying to learn,

33:34.160 --> 33:35.920
 what I'm hearing and what I'm seeing.

33:35.920 --> 33:39.080
 So again, a daily 90-minute bout is one to start with.

33:39.080 --> 33:40.780
 And I would say after about four weeks of that,

33:40.780 --> 33:42.080
 if you're able to stay concentrated

33:42.080 --> 33:43.420
 and work through the agitation,

33:43.420 --> 33:46.560
 then I would consider increasing the number of focus bouts.

33:46.560 --> 33:49.400
 Again, this is not to say that you should go to your teacher

33:49.400 --> 33:52.560
 or your PhD advisor or your parent or your friends

33:52.560 --> 33:54.320
 and say, listen, I can't really concentrate

33:54.320 --> 33:56.740
 or think about anything for more than 90 minutes per day.

33:56.740 --> 33:57.580
 That's not what I'm saying.

33:57.580 --> 33:58.880
 These are deep focus bouts.

33:58.880 --> 34:02.640
 These are bouts of work or I should say mental work

34:02.640 --> 34:05.120
 or physical work where you're really forcing yourself

34:05.120 --> 34:07.880
 to focus and refocus, to sharpen the head of that arrowhead,

34:07.880 --> 34:09.960
 to redirect it to what you're trying to concentrate on.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.520
 And it is indeed hard work.

34:11.520 --> 34:13.020
 I would even think about it more or less

34:13.020 --> 34:15.220
 like a workout of any kind.

34:15.220 --> 34:16.960
 Before we continue with today's discussion,

34:16.960 --> 34:18.560
 we're going to take a brief pause

34:18.560 --> 34:21.080
 to acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens,

34:21.080 --> 34:22.840
 also called AG1.

34:22.840 --> 34:26.140
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.

34:26.140 --> 34:29.560
 So I'm delighted that they've been a sponsor of this podcast.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.360
 Athletic Greens contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics,

34:32.360 --> 34:35.080
 digestive medicines, and adaptogens.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.360
 So it's got a lot of things in there.

34:36.360 --> 34:38.000
 And that's actually the reason I started taking it.

34:38.000 --> 34:40.680
 And the reason I still take it once or twice a day

34:40.680 --> 34:42.800
 essentially covers all of my nutritional bases.

34:42.800 --> 34:45.040
 And the probiotics in particular are important to me

34:45.040 --> 34:46.380
 because of the critical importance

34:46.380 --> 34:47.980
 of what's called the gut brain axis.

34:47.980 --> 34:51.220
 That is neurons and other cell types in the gut,

34:51.220 --> 34:53.760
 in the digestive tract that communicate with the brain

34:53.760 --> 34:56.000
 and the brain back to the digestive tract

34:56.000 --> 34:59.400
 in order to control things like mood, immune function,

34:59.400 --> 35:01.380
 hormone function, and on and on.

35:01.380 --> 35:02.840
 Whenever somebody has asked me,

35:02.840 --> 35:05.040
 what's the one supplement they should take?

35:05.040 --> 35:06.680
 I always answer Athletic Greens.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.040
 I gave that answer long before I ever had this podcast.

35:09.040 --> 35:10.820
 And it's the answer I still give now

35:10.820 --> 35:13.600
 for all the reasons that I detailed just a moment ago.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.000
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.840

 while you're on the road,

35:23.160 --> 35:25.960
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2,

35:25.960 --> 35:28.160
 which are also very important for a huge number

35:28.160 --> 35:30.280
 of bodily factors and brain factors

35:30.280 --> 35:32.160
 that impact your immediate and long-term health.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.800
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

35:36.360 --> 35:37.840
 I'd like to call your attention to a new

35:37.840 --> 35:40.120
 and extremely useful tool for learning

35:40.120 --> 35:42.840
 and applying science-based protocols for mental health,

35:42.840 --> 35:44.480
 physical health, and performance.

35:44.480 --> 35:48.440
 It's called Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, and it's an app.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.200
 And inside the app, you'll find what are called journeys.

35:51.200 --> 35:53.580
 Each journey is aimed at a specific goal,

35:53.580 --> 35:56.780
 such as improving your sleep or tracking your sleep,

35:56.780 --> 35:59.920
 or improving your ability to focus and concentrate,

35:59.920 --> 36:04.640
 or improving your nutrition, or specific exercise programs.

36:04.640 --> 36:07.080
 The Virtusan app makes a lot of the protocols

36:07.080 --> 36:09.140
 that you've seen here on the Huberman Lab Podcast

36:09.140 --> 36:11.600
 and elsewhere very easy to understand

36:11.600 --> 36:13.040
 and access and practice.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.080
 And in fact, it tracks your progress

36:15.080 --> 36:16.760
 with each of these protocols.

36:16.760 --> 36:19.600
 I and several other researchers have been directly involved

36:19.600 --> 36:22.080
 in developing the specific journeys and protocols

36:22.080 --> 36:23.820
 that you'll find within the Virtusan app.

36:23.820 --> 36:26.580
 In fact, a lot of it involves direct video tutorials

36:26.580 --> 36:28.600
 from me and others that you'll recognize

36:28.600 --> 36:30.560
 from social media and from podcasts.

36:30.560 --> 36:32.760
 Everything that you'll find within the Virtusan app

36:32.760 --> 36:34.840
 is geared towards giving you the latest science

36:34.840 --> 36:37.220
 in simple, straightforward protocols

36:37.220 --> 36:38.840
 to allow you to improve your mental health,

36:38.840 --> 36:40.920
 physical health, and performance.

36:40.920 --> 36:41.760
 If you want to check it out,

36:41.760 --> 36:44.280
 you can go to the app store under Virtusan.

36:44.280 --> 36:47.120
 Again, that's spelled V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N,

36:47.120 --> 36:50.600
 or you can go to virtusan.com slash Huberman.

36:50.600 --> 36:53.280
 Again, that's virtusan.com slash Huberman.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.000
 I mentioned the topic of nutrition a little bit ago,

36:56.000 --> 36:58.080
 and of course, nutrition is a complicated topic.

36:58.080 --> 36:59.440
 In fact, one of the quickest ways

36:59.440 --> 37:01.540
 to get yourself into a battle online

37:01.540 --> 37:03.920
 is to say something definitive about nutrition.

37:03.920 --> 37:06.320
 I just want to clearly state my stance about nutrition.

37:06.320 --> 37:08.280
 I fully support and applaud those of you

37:08.280 --> 37:09.720
 that are vegans for whatever reason,

37:09.720 --> 37:11.920
 those of you that are pure carnivore for whatever reason,

37:11.920 --> 37:14.040
 and those of you that are omnivores for whatever reason.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.400
 I happen to be an omnivore.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.240
 My goal is always to eat high quality,

37:17.240 --> 37:19.160
 minimally or non-processed foods,

37:19.160 --> 37:20.400
 and to eat things in moderation.

37:20.400 --> 37:23.260
 So I do eat some meat from sustainable sources

37:23.260 --> 37:24.700
 or from organic sources.

37:24.700 --> 37:27.920
 I eat some starches and I eat vegetables and I eat fruits.

37:27.920 --> 37:29.240
 I try not to eat sugars,

37:29.240 --> 37:30.760
 and I don't really like highly processed foods

37:30.760 --> 37:31.800
 at this point in my life.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.000
 That's me, that's what I do,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.360
 but I'm certainly not dictating what people should eat.

37:35.360 --> 37:36.920
 I know certain people are ketogenic,

37:36.920 --> 37:40.040
 and I can say that for people who achieve ketosis

37:40.040 --> 37:42.320
 and can get into ketosis, yes, indeed,

37:42.320 --> 37:44.820
 there is a mental state associated with ketosis

37:44.820 --> 37:46.760
 that will allow your brain to function

37:46.760 --> 37:48.060
 and to think really clearly,

37:48.060 --> 37:49.860
 that many people find very attractive

37:49.860 --> 37:52.160
 and keep them going back over and over again

37:52.160 --> 37:53.440
 to a ketogenic diet.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.540
 I'm somebody who, for instance,

37:54.540 --> 37:57.040
 has not been in ketosis many times in my life,

37:57.040 --> 37:58.680
 at least not deliberately so,

37:58.680 --> 38:01.340
 but I actually will ingest liquid ketones from time to time

38:01.340 --> 38:03.680
 because of the further cognitive enhancement

38:03.680 --> 38:05.320
 or physical enhancement that I experience

38:05.320 --> 38:08.740
 on top of nutrition that does include some carbohydrates.

38:08.740 --> 38:11.100
 So there are a lot of different ways to approach all this.

38:11.100 --> 38:12.820
 Whether or not you're a vegan, omnivore,

38:12.820 --> 38:14.800
 vegetarian, carnivore, et cetera,

38:14.800 --> 38:17.760
 the point is this, your ability to focus,

38:17.760 --> 38:19.660
 and in fact, your ability of neurons

38:19.660 --> 38:22.460
 to encode specific information in your environment,

38:22.460 --> 38:25.160
 that is to represent what's out there in the world,

38:25.160 --> 38:28.080
 is actually related to your blood glucose level.

38:28.080 --> 38:31.600
 Now, here I'm setting aside the discussion of ketosis

38:31.600 --> 38:33.880
 and ketogenic diets for the moment,

38:33.880 --> 38:34.880
 but there's a beautiful study

38:34.880 --> 38:36.460
 that was published in Neuron not long ago

38:36.460 --> 38:37.520
 that showed that the tuning,

38:37.520 --> 38:40.340
 that is the precision with which neurons in the brain

38:40.340 --> 38:42.400
 will represent things in our environment,

38:42.400 --> 38:44.720
 is actually much greater

38:44.720 --> 38:47.040
 when there is sufficient glucose in the brain.

38:47.040 --> 38:48.120
 Translated into English,

38:48.120 --> 38:50.040
 this means that when we are fasted

38:50.040 --> 38:52.000
 or when our blood glucose is very low,

38:52.000 --> 38:54.880
 we aren't able to perceive and think about things

38:54.880 --> 38:56.040
 as clearly.

38:56.040 --> 38:57.740
 Now, there's a twist to this, however.

38:57.740 --> 38:59.840
 Many people who practice intermittent fasting,

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
 and I should say I practice

39:00.840 --> 39:02.440
 a sort of pseudo-intermittent fasting.

39:02.440 --> 39:03.640
 I generally eat my meals

39:03.640 --> 39:05.860
 between the hours of 11 a.m. and 8 p.m.,

39:05.860 --> 39:07.920
 although sometimes there's some wiggle around that.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.280
 Occasionally I have an early breakfast.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.700
 I'm not super rigid about it,

39:10.700 --> 39:12.040
 but I know there are a number of people

39:12.040 --> 39:13.240
 who are doing longer fasts

39:13.240 --> 39:15.680
 or they're eating in a six-hour window.

39:15.680 --> 39:17.840
 We did an entire episode about fasting.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.000
 You can, again, find that at HubermanLab.com.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.800
 We'll likely have Sachin Panda,

39:21.800 --> 39:24.800
 who's an expert in intermittent fasting on the podcast.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.240
 Intermittent fasting

39:26.240 --> 39:29.060
 has a lot of different potential benefits.

39:29.060 --> 39:30.460
 For some people, it's a convenient way

39:30.460 --> 39:31.460
 to restrict their calories.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.660
 For other people, it's a convenient way to avoid eating.

39:33.660 --> 39:35.200
 That is, it's easier to not eat

39:35.200 --> 39:36.300
 than to eat a small portion,

39:36.300 --> 39:38.500
 so they opt for intermittent fasting,

39:38.500 --> 39:39.880
 and so on and so forth.

39:39.880 --> 39:41.720
 But one of the things that you hear very often

39:41.720 --> 39:43.440
 is that some people like being fasted

39:43.440 --> 39:46.680
 because they like the clarity of mind that it provides.

39:46.680 --> 39:48.060
 Here's the situation.

39:48.060 --> 39:50.000
 Neurons, unless you're in a ketogenic diet,

39:50.000 --> 39:51.560
 really thrive on glucose.

39:51.560 --> 39:53.160
 They love glucose.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.680
 And as I mentioned before,

39:54.680 --> 39:56.520
 your ability to think and perceive things

39:56.520 --> 39:57.880
 is actually enhanced

39:57.880 --> 40:00.060
 by having sufficient glucose in your bloodstream.

40:00.060 --> 40:02.480
 So why would it be that some people experience

40:02.480 --> 40:05.120
 a heightened state of mental clarity when they are fasted?

40:05.120 --> 40:06.940
 I've certainly experienced that before.

40:06.940 --> 40:09.540
 Well, I should say that provided you're well-hydrated enough

40:09.540 --> 40:11.480
 and you have enough electrolytes in your system,

40:11.480 --> 40:14.120
 what tends to happen is that when you ingest food,

40:14.120 --> 40:15.640
 there's a shift in your nervous system

40:15.640 --> 40:17.680
 towards so-called parasympathetic mode.

40:17.680 --> 40:19.200
 That is, the more relaxed,

40:19.200 --> 40:20.800
 you probably heard it as rest and digest,

40:20.800 --> 40:21.640
 although it does other things,

40:21.640 --> 40:24.520
 a more relaxed mode that can indeed make us very sleepy.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.840
 If we have too many carbohydrates,

40:25.840 --> 40:27.440
 it actually can make us quite sleepy.

40:27.440 --> 40:31.140
 However, if we have any food, if we have enough of it,

40:31.140 --> 40:34.040
 that is, if our gut is full, it diverts blood to our gut

40:34.040 --> 40:36.440
 and we become sleepy and we can't focus as well.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.400
 So a lot of people really like fasting

40:38.400 --> 40:41.680
 in the state of being fasted for focus and concentration

40:41.680 --> 40:43.600
 because they don't have

40:43.600 --> 40:45.920
 as much of that parasympathetic activation.

40:45.920 --> 40:46.960
 They're just not as sleepy.

40:46.960 --> 40:48.560
 And in fact, under those conditions,

40:48.560 --> 40:51.320
 half as much caffeine will give you just as much lift

40:51.320 --> 40:53.120
 as twice as much caffeine

40:53.120 --> 40:54.720
 will give you on a full belly of pasta.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.500
 And that's just the way that caffeine interacts

40:56.500 --> 40:57.360
 with blood glucose.

40:57.360 --> 40:58.940
 So what I'd like you to imagine

40:58.940 --> 41:02.320
 is if you had a measure of focus from zero to 10,

41:02.320 --> 41:04.800
 these are arbitrary units, 10 being maximally focused

41:04.800 --> 41:06.960
 and zero being not focused at all,

41:06.960 --> 41:10.040
 imagine a U-shaped function, right?

41:10.040 --> 41:11.880
 Where if you're very fasted,

41:11.880 --> 41:14.840
 you're going to have a high degree of focus and concentration

41:14.840 --> 41:17.360
 but then if you ingest some food and your belly is full,

41:17.360 --> 41:19.700
 your focus and concentration is reduced.

41:19.700 --> 41:22.220
 But having enough blood glucose

41:22.220 --> 41:24.320
 and maybe even elevated blood glucose

41:24.320 --> 41:25.820
 will increase cognitive function.

41:25.820 --> 41:27.060
 So there are two ends of the spectrum.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.320
 On one end of the spectrum,

41:28.320 --> 41:31.140
 blood glucose is relatively low and you're fasted

41:31.140 --> 41:34.700
 and you can think and behave in a very concentrated way.

41:34.700 --> 41:36.300
 And on the other end of the spectrum,

41:36.300 --> 41:37.720
 you have a lot of blood glucose

41:37.720 --> 41:39.160
 or I should say sufficient blood glucose.

41:39.160 --> 41:41.440
 You never want your blood glucose to be too high.

41:41.440 --> 41:45.200
 And that allows your neurons to encode and perceive

41:45.200 --> 41:47.420
 and basically allow you to think really clearly.

41:47.420 --> 41:49.520
 So you sort of have to pick your condition.

41:49.520 --> 41:52.800
 What do you want for your bouts of focus and concentration?

41:52.800 --> 41:53.840
 I actually do both.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.360
 So what I do is, as I mentioned before,

41:55.360 --> 41:57.360
 I eat my meals sometime around 11 a.m.,

41:57.360 --> 41:58.480
 my first meal typically,

41:58.480 --> 42:00.080
 unless I'm very hungry when I wake up.

42:00.080 --> 42:04.540
 And so I will do my workout and one bout of focused work.

42:04.540 --> 42:07.560
 I always think of this as my hard work early in the day.

42:07.560 --> 42:08.980
 And I do that fasted.

42:08.980 --> 42:11.240
 I'll be consuming water with electrolytes,

42:11.240 --> 42:12.680
 maybe Element or other electrolytes,

42:12.680 --> 42:14.720
 maybe some caffeine as well

42:14.720 --> 42:17.200
 in the form of Yerba Mate or coffee.

42:17.200 --> 42:20.380
 That's my first focus bout of 90 minutes or less.

42:20.380 --> 42:21.880
 That is essentially done fasted.

42:21.880 --> 42:22.920
 And then I'll eat.

42:22.920 --> 42:24.760
 And then I do notice after I eat,

42:24.760 --> 42:26.920
 I actually have a diminished capacity to focus.

42:26.920 --> 42:28.240
 But then again in the afternoon,

42:28.240 --> 42:30.220
 I will do another 90 minute bout of focus.

42:30.220 --> 42:31.760
 And I'll talk about some of the tools I use

42:31.760 --> 42:34.140
 to make sure that that bout of focus is optimal

42:34.140 --> 42:37.480
 for getting the most amount of focused work done,

42:37.480 --> 42:39.340
 whether or not it's mental work or physical work,

42:39.340 --> 42:41.580
 although I tend to do my physical work early in the day

42:41.580 --> 42:44.580
 and my mental work both early and late in the day.

42:44.580 --> 42:48.380
 So to make this very simple or as simple as I can for you,

42:48.380 --> 42:52.080
 being fasted is great for focus and concentration

42:52.080 --> 42:55.160
 provided you're not thinking about food the entire time.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.280
 And being fed is terrific for focus and concentration,

42:58.280 --> 43:00.560
 actually can improve neuronal function

43:00.560 --> 43:03.000
 provided that you didn't eat too much food.

43:03.000 --> 43:06.280
 So one way to manage this is if you're going to have a lunch

43:06.280 --> 43:08.420
 to make sure that you don't stuff yourself at lunch,

43:08.420 --> 43:11.780
 that you're not overeating and to not get quite so full

43:11.780 --> 43:14.880
 that you put your nervous system into this parasympathetic

43:14.880 --> 43:17.240
 mode and make it hard to focus in the afternoon.

43:17.240 --> 43:18.600
 I know a lot of people experience a dip

43:18.600 --> 43:20.320
 or even a crash in energy in the afternoon

43:20.320 --> 43:21.920
 that make it really hard to focus.

43:21.920 --> 43:23.900
 For that reason, I'll just remind people of a tool

43:23.900 --> 43:25.640
 I've talked about many times before,

43:25.640 --> 43:27.360
 which is based on the biology of adenosine

43:27.360 --> 43:28.600
 and caffeine, et cetera,

43:28.600 --> 43:31.120
 which is to delay your first caffeine intake

43:31.120 --> 43:33.680
 to 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.

43:33.680 --> 43:35.700
 I know that can be painful for certain people.

43:35.700 --> 43:37.680
 I violate that rule when I'm working out

43:37.680 --> 43:38.760
 very early in the morning,

43:38.760 --> 43:41.260
 I'll drink my caffeine before my workout,

43:41.260 --> 43:45.200
 which often occurs within 30 to 60 minutes of waking.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.940
 But in general, unless I'm working out very early,

43:47.940 --> 43:50.940
 I will ingest my caffeine 90 to 120 minutes

43:50.940 --> 43:52.500
 after I wake up.

43:52.500 --> 43:55.200
 So again, I want to emphasize that if you hear somebody

43:55.200 --> 43:57.660
 out there say being fasted is optimal

43:57.660 --> 43:59.640
 for focus and concentration.

43:59.640 --> 44:02.200
 Well, that is true in one context

44:02.200 --> 44:04.800
 and perhaps ideal for a certain part of the day.

44:04.800 --> 44:08.000
 And other people will say, no, neurons run on glucose.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.880
 You need glucose in your bloodstream

44:09.880 --> 44:12.380
 in order to get those neurons to be tuned.

44:12.380 --> 44:14.540
 That is to respond with electrical activity

44:14.540 --> 44:16.940
 in the optimal way when you're reading something

44:16.940 --> 44:18.220
 or when you're trying to perform exercise.

44:18.220 --> 44:19.300
 Well, that's also true.

44:19.300 --> 44:21.360
 And of course you can incorporate both.

44:21.360 --> 44:23.800
 I, in fact, as I just described,

44:23.800 --> 44:27.120
 incorporate both fasted states and fed states

44:27.120 --> 44:30.920
 in order to optimize my concentration and focus.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.200
 And as a brief note about ketosis,

44:33.200 --> 44:35.440
 for those of you that actually managed to transition

44:35.440 --> 44:38.640
 into ketosis and are maintaining a ketogenic state,

44:38.640 --> 44:43.200
 that, as I mentioned earlier, can enhance brain function,

44:43.200 --> 44:45.800
 concentration and focus because of the way

44:45.800 --> 44:47.480
 in which ketones can be used

44:47.480 --> 44:50.840
 as a so-called optimal fuel for neurons.

44:50.840 --> 44:54.200
 The ketogenic diet was originally designed, if you will,

44:54.200 --> 44:57.040
 for epilepsy as a whole relationship to epilepsy

44:57.040 --> 44:58.720
 and controlling epileptic seizures.

44:58.720 --> 45:00.980
 And it can in fact allow people

45:00.980 --> 45:03.340
 to achieve focus concentrated brain states.

45:03.340 --> 45:05.380
 So in the future, I'll do an episode about ketosis

45:05.380 --> 45:07.580
 and be sure to circle back on how to optimize ketosis

45:07.580 --> 45:08.800
 for focus and concentration.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.560
 Although I have to believe that most of the people

45:10.560 --> 45:12.780
 listening to this are probably not in ketosis

45:12.780 --> 45:14.020
 or following a ketogenic diet.

45:14.020 --> 45:17.420
 So that's why I mainly focused on fasted states

45:17.420 --> 45:18.860
 and fed states.

45:18.860 --> 45:20.720
 And just to make sure that I'm thorough,

45:20.720 --> 45:22.680
 a fasted state to me would be a state

45:22.680 --> 45:25.240
 in which you haven't ingested any calories,

45:25.240 --> 45:27.100
 but may have ingested caffeine

45:27.100 --> 45:29.160
 or maybe even a small amount of artificial sweetener

45:29.160 --> 45:30.520
 or something like that,

45:30.520 --> 45:33.000
 but really haven't ingested any significant number

45:33.000 --> 45:35.620
 of calories in the previous four to eight

45:35.620 --> 45:36.860
 or maybe even 12 hours.

45:36.860 --> 45:38.720
 And again, there's tremendous variation here

45:38.720 --> 45:40.420
 depending on how long people have fasted,

45:40.420 --> 45:41.680
 whether or not we're talking about the state

45:41.680 --> 45:43.400
 right after people wake up, et cetera.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.140
 Again, if you're interested in intermittent fasting,

45:45.140 --> 45:48.680
 both for sake of mental and physical health and performance,

45:48.680 --> 45:51.500
 check out our episode on fasting at hubermanlab.com.

45:51.500 --> 45:53.160
 I also want to touch back on this idea

45:53.160 --> 45:55.600
 of which foods can increase focus.

45:55.600 --> 45:58.440
 You know, in the episode on ADHD that I did,

45:58.440 --> 46:00.400
 I touched on this quite a bit

46:00.400 --> 46:02.200
 as it relates to elimination diets.

46:02.200 --> 46:04.200
 You know, there's a whole industry

46:04.200 --> 46:06.520
 and a ton of interest for obvious reasons

46:06.520 --> 46:08.960
 into what sorts of things kids and adults

46:08.960 --> 46:09.900
 should and shouldn't eat

46:09.900 --> 46:12.040
 in order to reduce symptoms of ADHD.

46:12.040 --> 46:14.920
 I think that the sum total of those data

46:14.920 --> 46:17.300
 point to the fact that reducing simple sugar intake

46:17.300 --> 46:19.320
 and certainly highly processed foods,

46:19.320 --> 46:22.040
 so ice cream, candy, chips, et cetera,

46:22.040 --> 46:24.520
 those sorts of things really does seem to improve symptoms

46:24.520 --> 46:26.920
 of ADHD in both children and adults.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.960
 But once you move past that and you start to say,

46:28.960 --> 46:31.840
 well, which foods can improve concentration and focus?

46:31.840 --> 46:35.440
 Well, foods that, for instance, include a lot of tyrosine,

46:35.440 --> 46:36.880
 which is a precursor to dopamine,

46:36.880 --> 46:40.160
 and now you know why dopamine is important in this context,

46:40.160 --> 46:42.720
 are certainly going to increase concentration and focus.

46:42.720 --> 46:44.800
 So things like Parmesan cheese,

46:44.800 --> 46:46.040
 certain meats, certain nuts,

46:46.040 --> 46:47.880
 you can look up which foods contain

46:47.880 --> 46:48.960
 high amounts of tyrosine.

46:48.960 --> 46:50.720
 There are also some fruits and vegetables

46:50.720 --> 46:52.620
 that include higher amounts of tyrosine.

46:52.620 --> 46:55.260
 But to be quite direct,

46:55.260 --> 46:59.120
 it doesn't matter whether or not you're ingesting foods

46:59.120 --> 47:01.720
 that are rich in the precursor amino acids

47:01.720 --> 47:04.020
 to dopamine, acetylcholine, et cetera,

47:04.020 --> 47:07.040
 if you're consuming large amounts of those foods.

47:07.040 --> 47:09.960
 That is, one can look and see, for instance,

47:09.960 --> 47:13.460
 that a steak includes a lot of the precursors

47:13.460 --> 47:14.720
 to acetylcholine.

47:14.720 --> 47:17.640
 It has amino acid precursors to dopamine as well,

47:17.640 --> 47:19.540
 and there are other foods that will do that as well.

47:19.540 --> 47:22.560
 But if I were to ingest, say, two ribeye steaks,

47:22.560 --> 47:24.040
 that's a lot of meat,

47:24.040 --> 47:26.880
 and it will direct a lot of blood to my gut,

47:26.880 --> 47:29.120
 and it will cause me to be sleepy,

47:29.120 --> 47:31.440
 and that will create challenges in me

47:31.440 --> 47:33.980
 being able to achieve states of focus and concentration.

47:33.980 --> 47:35.400
 So the simple way to put this is,

47:35.400 --> 47:38.680
 if you eat too much or you eat a very large volume of food,

47:38.680 --> 47:42.680
 you are going to diminish your focus and concentration.

47:42.680 --> 47:44.960
 The key is to eat enough that you're nourished

47:44.960 --> 47:47.480
 for the certain activities, mental and physical,

47:47.480 --> 47:48.940
 that you need to perform.

47:48.940 --> 47:50.520
 But if you're eating large meals,

47:50.520 --> 47:53.700
 you are going to diminish your concentration and focus,

47:53.700 --> 47:54.540
 period.

47:54.540 --> 47:57.160
 I know many people are curious as to whether or not caffeine

47:57.160 --> 47:59.720
 can improve focus and concentration,

47:59.720 --> 48:01.720
 and indeed, it can.

48:01.720 --> 48:04.980
 There is an immense amount of data supporting the idea

48:04.980 --> 48:06.720
 that caffeine, provided it's consumed

48:06.720 --> 48:08.240
 in the appropriate dosages,

48:08.240 --> 48:11.160
 can improve mental performance and physical performance,

48:11.160 --> 48:12.960
 and it largely does that

48:12.960 --> 48:16.120
 through improvements in focus and concentration.

48:17.040 --> 48:18.560
 The dosage of caffeine, of course,

48:18.560 --> 48:21.280
 is going to depend on how caffeine-adapted you are,

48:21.280 --> 48:23.480
 how much caffeine tolerance you have,

48:23.480 --> 48:26.440
 and that is going to vary tremendously

48:26.440 --> 48:28.920
 depending on whether or not you ingest that caffeine

48:28.920 --> 48:31.400
 with or without food, as I mentioned earlier.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.600
 But there is a kind of general range

48:33.600 --> 48:35.600
 in which we can talk about caffeine

48:35.600 --> 48:37.800
 as being useful for focus and concentration.

48:37.800 --> 48:40.820
 And the range is basically from 100 milligrams

48:40.820 --> 48:42.320
 to 400 milligrams.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.040
 I want to caution everybody out there.

48:44.040 --> 48:46.480
 If you're somebody who suffers from anxiety

48:46.480 --> 48:49.400
 or panic attacks, and you're not used to ingesting caffeine,

48:49.400 --> 48:52.080
 and you run out and ingest 400 milligrams of caffeine

48:52.080 --> 48:54.920
 in the form of espresso or yerba mate or an energy drink

48:54.920 --> 48:58.120
 or in pill form, that is going to be very uncomfortable

48:58.120 --> 48:59.880
 for you, you're going to be sweating profusely,

48:59.880 --> 49:01.140
 your heart rate is going to increase,

49:01.140 --> 49:04.080
 you're going to be quite panicked, in fact,

49:04.080 --> 49:05.440
 or at least anxious.

49:05.440 --> 49:09.240
 So be cautious with your use and adopting of caffeine

49:09.240 --> 49:11.480
 if you're not already caffeine-adapted.

49:11.480 --> 49:14.560
 But most people do quite well to ingest 100 to 200 milligrams

49:14.560 --> 49:17.620
 of caffeine prior to doing some focused work.

49:17.620 --> 49:20.320
 And again, I recommend delaying your caffeine intake

49:20.320 --> 49:22.480
 to 90 to 120 minutes after waking

49:22.480 --> 49:24.340
 unless you are using that caffeine

49:24.340 --> 49:28.180
 to really jolt your system before a workout.

49:28.180 --> 49:31.020
 Caffeine can, of course, be ingested in various forms,

49:31.020 --> 49:32.920
 even pill form, but most people ingest it

49:32.920 --> 49:35.680
 in the form of coffee, or my particular favorite way

49:35.680 --> 49:37.880
 to ingest caffeine is yerba mate.

49:37.880 --> 49:40.040
 It is important, and I should note

49:40.040 --> 49:43.420
 that you should actively avoid the smoked versions

49:43.420 --> 49:44.920
 of yerba mate as they contain a lot

49:44.920 --> 49:47.380
 of carcinogenic cancer-promoting compounds.

49:47.380 --> 49:49.720
 There's some great yerba mate brands out there.

49:49.720 --> 49:52.700
 The most cost-effective way to consume it would be

49:52.700 --> 49:55.960
 to use the loose leaf tea and to pour water over that.

49:55.960 --> 49:57.680
 There's one particular brand that I like.

49:57.680 --> 50:00.100
 I don't have any affiliation to them whatsoever,

50:00.100 --> 50:01.160
 but I've been using it for years.

50:01.160 --> 50:02.040
 It's Anna Park.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.180
 It's an organic brand that is sold.

50:04.180 --> 50:06.320
 I buy mine on Amazon, but you can find it elsewhere

50:06.320 --> 50:07.380
 on the internet as well.

50:07.380 --> 50:09.000
 Again, I don't have any affiliation to them.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.720
 It's just very cost-effective, very clean.

50:10.720 --> 50:12.560
 It doesn't have the smoked flavor.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.500
 At least the one that I buy is not the smoked variety,

50:14.500 --> 50:16.840
 so none of the carcinogenic compounds are in there,

50:16.840 --> 50:18.320
 at least that I'm aware of.

50:18.320 --> 50:20.160
 And I like the way it tastes,

50:20.160 --> 50:23.960
 and it provides a very even lift and stimulant

50:23.960 --> 50:25.640
 that I think certainly works for me

50:25.640 --> 50:27.100
 and that a number of people I know

50:27.100 --> 50:29.440
 that I've suggested to also enjoy.

50:29.440 --> 50:34.320
 Yerba mate or caffeine also have other additional benefits.

50:34.320 --> 50:38.000
 In particular, the caffeine in yerba mate and coffee

50:38.000 --> 50:40.120
 and other sources of caffeine are known to increase

50:40.120 --> 50:43.600
 the density and efficacy that is the number

50:43.600 --> 50:46.720
 and the function of dopamine receptors.

50:46.720 --> 50:49.340
 And this has been shown in humans several times.

50:49.340 --> 50:51.300
 So by ingesting caffeine pretty regularly,

50:51.300 --> 50:53.600
 you're actually increasing the ability of dopamine

50:53.600 --> 50:57.920
 to have this effect of increasing motivation and drive.

50:57.920 --> 51:00.400
 I tend to ingest caffeine only early in the day.

51:00.400 --> 51:01.960
 I tend to cut off my caffeine intake

51:01.960 --> 51:03.660
 somewhere around one or 2 p.m.

51:03.660 --> 51:05.840
 to ensure that I can get into a good night's sleep.

51:05.840 --> 51:07.240
 But I realized that there are people out there

51:07.240 --> 51:09.300
 that ingest caffeine as late as two or three

51:09.300 --> 51:11.340
 in the afternoon and can still sleep fine.

51:11.340 --> 51:12.880
 I will caution those of you that think

51:12.880 --> 51:15.040
 that you can drink caffeine in the evening or nighttime

51:15.040 --> 51:16.660
 and still fall asleep.

51:16.660 --> 51:18.560
 All of the research points to the fact

51:18.560 --> 51:20.000
 that the architecture of your sleep

51:20.000 --> 51:21.640
 and the depth of your sleep is disrupted

51:21.640 --> 51:24.340
 even if you're able to fall and stay asleep.

51:24.340 --> 51:26.000
 The sleep you're getting is simply not as good

51:26.000 --> 51:26.880
 as the sleep you would get

51:26.880 --> 51:29.560
 if you were to shut off your caffeine intake

51:29.560 --> 51:31.240
 at least eight hours before bedtime

51:31.240 --> 51:33.940
 and ideally more like 10 or even 12 hours before bedtime.

51:33.940 --> 51:36.800
 But of course there are practical constraints as well.

51:36.800 --> 51:41.020
 Okay, so caffeine is increasing dopamine's function

51:41.020 --> 51:45.280
 by changing the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors.

51:45.280 --> 51:47.120
 But of course it also increases our wakefulness,

51:47.120 --> 51:48.120
 our alertness.

51:48.120 --> 51:51.200
 And that is largely through the neurochemical systems

51:51.200 --> 51:52.560
 related to adenosine,

51:52.560 --> 51:54.680
 which is a molecule that builds up in our brain and body

51:54.680 --> 51:55.720
 the longer we are awake.

51:55.720 --> 51:58.560
 It's part of the sleepiness system, if you will.

51:58.560 --> 52:00.800
 It makes us feel fatigued or tired.

52:00.800 --> 52:05.120
 And caffeine also operates on the epinephrine,

52:05.120 --> 52:06.460
 the adrenaline system.

52:06.460 --> 52:08.060
 In fact, if we ingest too much caffeine,

52:08.060 --> 52:09.820
 we'll sometimes get the jitters.

52:09.820 --> 52:12.880
 Those jitters are really the sympathetic,

52:12.880 --> 52:15.760
 as it's called, nervous systems biased toward movement.

52:15.760 --> 52:18.240
 And our pupils will dilate.

52:18.240 --> 52:19.480
 They actually get broader.

52:19.480 --> 52:21.960
 Now, somewhat paradoxically,

52:21.960 --> 52:23.880
 when our pupils get bigger,

52:23.880 --> 52:25.960
 the pupils of our eyes, that is,

52:25.960 --> 52:27.840
 our visual world actually narrows.

52:27.840 --> 52:29.360
 It becomes more tunnel-like.

52:29.360 --> 52:30.280
 A lot of people don't realize this.

52:30.280 --> 52:31.400
 When our pupils are really small,

52:31.400 --> 52:32.680
 that means we are relaxed.

52:32.680 --> 52:34.160
 So if you ever see someone with really tiny

52:34.160 --> 52:36.840
 or pin-sized pupils, they are very relaxed.

52:36.840 --> 52:39.280
 If their pupils are very big, they're very dilated,

52:39.280 --> 52:42.000
 well then they are very amped up.

52:42.000 --> 52:44.080
 They are very, very alert.

52:44.080 --> 52:47.400
 Caffeine increases alertness by increasing epinephrine,

52:47.400 --> 52:51.080
 adrenaline release, both in the brain and within the body.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.040
 And so that's another way

52:52.040 --> 52:55.760
 that it facilitates focus and concentration.

52:55.760 --> 52:58.120
 Now, there are other ways to increase epinephrine

52:58.120 --> 53:01.000
 in the brain and body besides caffeine or other stimulants.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.900
 And in fact, that has been studied.

53:02.900 --> 53:05.320
 There's an excellent study that was carried out

53:05.320 --> 53:08.100
 not that long ago on how stress itself

53:08.100 --> 53:11.160
 can increase our ability to focus and concentrate.

53:11.160 --> 53:12.680
 That's right, how stress itself

53:12.680 --> 53:14.760
 can increase focus and concentration.

53:14.760 --> 53:17.240
 Most people think of stress as impairing our ability

53:17.240 --> 53:19.300
 to focus, but that's actually not true.

53:19.300 --> 53:22.240
 When we are stressed, it involves the deployment,

53:22.240 --> 53:24.560
 the release of adrenaline, epinephrine,

53:24.560 --> 53:27.920
 and that adrenaline both changes our visual field.

53:27.920 --> 53:29.700
 In other words, it narrows our vision

53:29.700 --> 53:32.100
 to a more tunnel-like focus.

53:32.100 --> 53:35.220
 That is, it makes the arrow in our metaphor

53:35.220 --> 53:40.220
 of the arrow more sharp and it improves our concentration.

53:40.280 --> 53:42.320
 This makes sense given what we know about stress.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.520
 When we're stressed, we tend to be stressed

53:43.520 --> 53:44.440
 about a specific thing.

53:44.440 --> 53:46.400
 We start anticipating or wondering

53:46.400 --> 53:47.840
 or thinking about what's going to happen next.

53:47.840 --> 53:48.840
 What led up to this?

53:48.840 --> 53:49.900
 How is this going to impact me?

53:49.900 --> 53:51.360
 How do I feel right now?

53:51.360 --> 53:53.160
 It really narrows the context

53:53.160 --> 53:55.120
 of our thinking and our behavior.

53:55.120 --> 53:57.100
 So one of my favorite studies that really illustrates

53:57.100 --> 54:00.460
 how stress can improve concentration and performance

54:00.460 --> 54:02.160
 is one that was published not that long ago.

54:02.160 --> 54:04.560
 And I will provide a link to this in the show notes.

54:04.560 --> 54:05.880
 It's a paper published

54:05.880 --> 54:08.820
 in the journal Experimental Psychology in 2020.

54:08.820 --> 54:11.040
 The title of the paper is, not surprisingly,

54:11.040 --> 54:14.080
 acute stress improves concentration performance.

54:14.080 --> 54:18.320
 First author DeGroote, D-E-G-R-O-O-T-E.

54:18.320 --> 54:21.240
 And this study involved taking a number of subjects

54:21.240 --> 54:23.520
 and stressing them out or not

54:23.520 --> 54:27.000
 prior to a cognitive or concentration task.

54:27.000 --> 54:28.660
 And there are a lot of data in this paper,

54:28.660 --> 54:31.760
 but I'm just going to home in on one specific set of data.

54:31.760 --> 54:33.260
 And I should mention as I go there

54:33.260 --> 54:35.800
 that they measured things like cortisol, a stress hormone,

54:35.800 --> 54:37.320
 they measured anxiety.

54:37.320 --> 54:38.840
 It was a quite thorough study.

54:38.840 --> 54:42.000
 And what they found was that concentration performance

54:42.000 --> 54:44.720
 improved manifold, I should say,

54:44.720 --> 54:48.080
 from there was a greater than doubling of concentration

54:48.080 --> 54:50.480
 and performance in the stress group.

54:50.480 --> 54:52.620
 And stress in this context was provided

54:52.620 --> 54:55.200
 using a standard way of inducing stress.

54:55.200 --> 54:56.720
 What they basically do is they bring subjects

54:56.720 --> 55:00.680
 into the laboratory and they have to either do something

55:00.680 --> 55:03.160
 fairly mundane in the control group,

55:03.160 --> 55:06.400
 or they have to do a simulated job interview

55:06.400 --> 55:07.560
 and arithmetic task,

55:07.560 --> 55:09.360
 and they're being evaluated as they're doing this.

55:09.360 --> 55:12.560
 So this isn't intense psychosocial stress.

55:12.560 --> 55:14.140
 They're not watching anything disturbing.

55:14.140 --> 55:16.000
 They're not being traumatized in any kind of way.

55:16.000 --> 55:18.400
 This is fairly low levels of stress

55:18.400 --> 55:20.680
 that rates their levels of epinephrine,

55:20.680 --> 55:22.560
 and we know this from this study,

55:22.560 --> 55:25.200
 and other levels of cortisol and other stress hormone

55:25.200 --> 55:28.240
 modestly within their brain and blood.

55:28.240 --> 55:31.360
 But that even modest increase in these stress hormones

55:31.360 --> 55:34.600
 and their reported psychological levels of stress

55:34.600 --> 55:37.520
 really enhance their focus and concentration.

55:37.520 --> 55:39.720
 This may come as surprising because you,

55:39.720 --> 55:40.560
 like many people think,

55:40.560 --> 55:42.800
 gosh, stress really diminishes cognitive performance,

55:42.800 --> 55:44.080
 but that's absolutely wrong.

55:44.080 --> 55:46.460
 Stress improves cognitive performance.

55:46.460 --> 55:47.300
 Now, of course,

55:47.300 --> 55:49.340
 there are other ways to increase stress levels

55:49.340 --> 55:50.600
 and to do that in healthy ways

55:50.600 --> 55:52.760
 to improve concentration and performance.

55:52.760 --> 55:54.800
 And one of the best ways to do that,

55:54.800 --> 55:58.060
 because it's so sure fire and it's generally safe,

55:58.060 --> 56:01.680
 provided you do it safely, is deliberate cold exposure.

56:01.680 --> 56:04.420
 This is something I've talked about on the podcast before,

56:04.420 --> 56:06.280
 but deliberate cold exposure can be achieved

56:06.280 --> 56:09.320
 by getting into a cold shower for one to five minutes.

56:09.320 --> 56:10.200
 If you're not used to it,

56:10.200 --> 56:11.960
 you probably want to start with one minute,

56:11.960 --> 56:13.660
 or you can get into an ice bath,

56:13.660 --> 56:15.420
 or nowadays there are a number of different commercial

56:15.420 --> 56:17.160
 sources of circulating cold water,

56:17.160 --> 56:19.840
 or if you have access to a body of cold water,

56:19.840 --> 56:22.240
 like a lake or a pool or an ocean,

56:22.240 --> 56:26.300
 we know that getting into cold water or under cold water

56:26.300 --> 56:28.720
 greatly increases epinephrine levels

56:28.720 --> 56:31.320
 and dopamine levels in the brain and blood.

56:31.320 --> 56:32.920
 There's a beautiful study that was published

56:32.920 --> 56:35.000
 in the European Journal of Physiology

56:35.000 --> 56:37.720
 that showed that the increases in dopamine are massive,

56:37.720 --> 56:40.760
 you know, near doubling or more of dopamine levels

56:40.760 --> 56:42.960
 that are very long lasting for hours,

56:42.960 --> 56:46.120
 and epinephrine and indeed cortisol levels

56:46.120 --> 56:49.800
 are also increased, and in ways that support

56:49.800 --> 56:53.760
 not just immune system function, because they do that,

56:53.760 --> 56:55.360
 and mood, because it does that,

56:55.360 --> 56:57.980
 but it can really improve concentration and focus.

56:57.980 --> 57:01.200
 I touched on this a little bit in an episode about memory,

57:01.200 --> 57:03.960
 that there is an age-old practice,

57:03.960 --> 57:06.040
 really dating back to medieval times,

57:06.040 --> 57:08.520
 of putting people into cold water

57:08.520 --> 57:11.480
 right after they learn something in order to spike,

57:11.480 --> 57:12.800
 to increase their epinephrine

57:12.800 --> 57:14.680
 as a way to consolidate those memories.

57:14.680 --> 57:16.360
 For sake of today's discussion,

57:16.360 --> 57:18.920
 if you're interested in ways to improve focus

57:18.920 --> 57:23.040
 and concentration, you need to increase your epinephrine,

57:23.040 --> 57:24.920
 your adrenaline levels.

57:24.920 --> 57:28.580
 Cold water exposure is one of the most efficient ways

57:28.580 --> 57:29.920
 to do that.

57:29.920 --> 57:31.620
 This is not a bio hack.

57:31.620 --> 57:33.160
 I don't like the word hack.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.380
 I know it's commonly used,

57:34.380 --> 57:36.720
 but a hack is something where you're using one thing

57:36.720 --> 57:38.900
 for a different purpose than it was originally intended for.

57:38.900 --> 57:40.480
 And here, I'm not referring to the shower

57:40.480 --> 57:42.520
 or the cold bath, I'm referring to epinephrine.

57:42.520 --> 57:46.000
 Epinephrine is a neurochemical that will place your vision

57:46.000 --> 57:47.520
 into more of a tunnel mode,

57:47.520 --> 57:49.440
 which will allow you to focus on cognitive work

57:49.440 --> 57:51.480
 or physical work in a more specific way.

57:51.480 --> 57:53.040
 You're not going to be as distractible.

57:53.040 --> 57:56.480
 And it's very easy to achieve by getting into a cold shower

57:56.480 --> 58:00.020
 or a cold body of water for a brief period of time.

58:00.020 --> 58:04.760
 People always ask how long to get under or into cold water

58:04.760 --> 58:05.920
 and how cold to make it.

58:05.920 --> 58:07.880
 Here's the thing, it should be uncomfortably cold,

58:07.880 --> 58:10.840
 but safe to stay in for one to five minutes.

58:10.840 --> 58:13.040
 Okay, so uncomfortably cold that you really want to get out,

58:13.040 --> 58:13.880
 but safe to stay in,

58:13.880 --> 58:15.880
 not so cold that it's going to give you a heart attack

58:15.880 --> 58:17.680
 and not so warm that it's comfortable

58:17.680 --> 58:20.060
 that it doesn't create that adrenaline release.

58:20.060 --> 58:22.480
 Cold water exposure, I should say deliberate cold water

58:22.480 --> 58:25.000
 or non-deliberate cold water exposure

58:25.000 --> 58:28.060
 reliably increases epinephrine levels.

58:28.060 --> 58:31.200
 It is incredibly useful as a tool for this.

58:31.200 --> 58:35.840
 And it is in fact zero cost or even negative zero cost.

58:35.840 --> 58:37.120
 How could it be negative zero cost?

58:37.120 --> 58:39.200
 Well, you can certainly save on your heating bill

58:39.200 --> 58:41.640
 by taking a cold shower, so that's one way.

58:41.640 --> 58:44.160
 And for those of you that have access to devices

58:44.160 --> 58:46.120
 or locations where you can get into cold water,

58:46.120 --> 58:48.440
 you can submerge, well, then that can work.

58:48.440 --> 58:51.120
 For those of you that don't, maybe you take a cold bath,

58:51.120 --> 58:52.080
 you get in up to your neck,

58:52.080 --> 58:53.200
 that's going to be most efficient.

58:53.200 --> 58:54.640
 For those of you that can't do that,

58:54.640 --> 58:55.760
 you'll get under a cold shower.

58:55.760 --> 58:59.400
 Again, it should be uncomfortably cold

58:59.400 --> 59:00.800
 to the point where you want to get out,

59:00.800 --> 59:04.120
 but that you can safely stay in for one to five minutes.

59:04.120 --> 59:06.020
 How long should you do it before a work bout?

59:06.020 --> 59:08.640
 Well, if you get into really cold water,

59:08.640 --> 59:10.040
 it's uncomfortably cold and get out

59:10.040 --> 59:12.400
 after about three minutes, you're probably good to go,

59:12.400 --> 59:14.400
 dry off and get to work.

59:14.400 --> 59:16.480
 Some of you might think this is a little bit silly

59:16.480 --> 59:18.540
 as a tool for focus and concentration,

59:18.540 --> 59:21.600
 but if you look at the data on epinephrine

59:21.600 --> 59:24.100
 and how powerfully it can increase focus,

59:24.100 --> 59:26.040
 I think you'd be very impressed.

59:26.040 --> 59:28.480
 I mean, it certainly can increase one's ability

59:28.480 --> 59:30.280
 to attend to specific visual stimuli.

59:30.280 --> 59:32.720
 So for reading or math work, et cetera,

59:32.720 --> 59:34.160
 it's going to be very useful.

59:34.160 --> 59:35.480
 And of course, you don't want to make it so cold

59:35.480 --> 59:37.800
 that you're shivering and chattering the whole time.

59:37.800 --> 59:39.500
 And of course you could, if you like,

59:39.500 --> 59:41.320
 combine this with 40 Hertz binaural beats.

59:41.320 --> 59:42.860
 There's no reason why you couldn't combine

59:42.860 --> 59:44.040
 the two protocols.

59:44.040 --> 59:46.880
 But the point here is that a lot of people would love to,

59:46.880 --> 59:50.280
 and I think ought to leverage the health promoting

59:50.280 --> 59:52.600
 and powerful effects of increasing epinephrine

59:52.600 --> 59:54.560
 on focus and concentration.

59:54.560 --> 59:57.000
 And running out and getting stressed by a life event

59:57.000 --> 59:59.200
 or getting into an argument or something like that

59:59.200 --> 1:00:01.480
 simply as a way to increase focus and concentration

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:03.040
 doesn't seem that adaptive to me.

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:04.280
 So deliberate cold exposure

1:00:04.280 --> 1:00:05.840
 is a straightforward way to do that.

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:07.300
 It doesn't involve anyone else.

1:00:07.300 --> 1:00:08.600
 I suppose you could do it with somebody else,

1:00:08.600 --> 1:00:10.280
 but it doesn't require anyone else.

1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:12.760
 And again, there are zero, low,

1:00:12.760 --> 1:00:14.960
 and even negative cost ways to approach that.

1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:17.800
 If you'd like to know how long the positive effects

1:00:17.800 --> 1:00:21.600
 of epinephrine last toward improving focus and concentration,

1:00:21.600 --> 1:00:23.540
 well, if we look to that study from DeGroote et al,

1:00:23.540 --> 1:00:26.280
 the acute stress improves cognitive performance study,

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:29.560
 they measured concentration before and 30 minutes

1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:32.400
 after the stress was induced.

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:34.760
 And there does appear to be a quite long lasting,

1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:37.240
 really up to an hour or more effect

1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:39.440
 of increasing epinephrine.

1:00:39.440 --> 1:00:42.200
 So how might you apply these sorts of protocols

1:00:42.200 --> 1:00:44.560
 early in the day or later in the day?

1:00:44.560 --> 1:00:47.800
 Well, one suggestion or one potential protocol would be

1:00:47.800 --> 1:00:49.600
 if you're going to sit down and do some work,

1:00:49.600 --> 1:00:51.400
 if you're already feeling alert and focused,

1:00:51.400 --> 1:00:52.760
 no need to reach to this tool,

1:00:52.760 --> 1:00:55.160
 but if you're feeling like your focus and alertness

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:56.800
 isn't quite where you'd like it to be,

1:00:56.800 --> 1:00:59.040
 you could take a three minute very cold shower

1:00:59.040 --> 1:01:01.080
 or submerge yourself in cold water for three minutes.

1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:02.800
 You might have a cup of coffee as well

1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:04.100
 and then sit down and do that work,

1:01:04.100 --> 1:01:06.700
 maybe even throw in the 40 Hertz binaural beats.

1:01:06.700 --> 1:01:09.840
 All of that would be layering in the different systems,

1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:13.000
 the different neurochemicals, such as acetylcholine,

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.120
 epinephrine, and dopamine that are going to lend themselves

1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:19.360
 to a really terrific 90 minute or less work bout.

1:01:19.360 --> 1:01:22.200
 Now I'd like to discuss some of the purely behavioral tools

1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:24.240
 that quality peer-reviewed science say

1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:27.920
 can improve focus and concentration significantly.

1:01:27.920 --> 1:01:29.740
 At the beginning of today's episode,

1:01:29.740 --> 1:01:32.440
 I talked about the study from Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab,

1:01:32.440 --> 1:01:36.280
 where they explored a 13 minute meditation done every day

1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:38.200
 for a period of eight weeks.

1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:40.700
 That meditation led to significant improvements

1:01:40.700 --> 1:01:42.880
 in focus and concentration ability,

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:45.520
 as well as other aspects of cognitive performance.

1:01:45.520 --> 1:01:48.580
 It also improved mood and reduced stress.

1:01:48.580 --> 1:01:51.320
 So you might be wondering what exactly is this meditation?

1:01:51.320 --> 1:01:52.960
 The meditation is very simple,

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:55.220
 and it's one that anyone can perform.

1:01:55.220 --> 1:01:57.400
 What you would want to do is set a timer

1:01:57.400 --> 1:01:58.860
 for about 13 minutes.

1:01:58.860 --> 1:02:00.820
 I don't think it has to be exactly 13 minutes,

1:02:00.820 --> 1:02:03.340
 but since that's what they included in the study,

1:02:03.340 --> 1:02:05.760
 you would set a timer for 13 minutes.

1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:09.100
 You would sit or lie down, close your eyes,

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:12.240
 and you would simply focus on your breathing.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:13.480
 Most people are going to benefit

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:15.880
 from only doing that breathing through their nose,

1:02:15.880 --> 1:02:18.080
 but if you have some sort of obstruction

1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:19.720
 or inability to breathe just through your nose,

1:02:19.720 --> 1:02:21.140
 you could probably also do it by breathing

1:02:21.140 --> 1:02:23.420
 through your nose and mouth or just your mouth.

1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:25.900
 But ideally, you would do just nasal breathing

1:02:25.900 --> 1:02:27.180
 for a period of 13 minutes,

1:02:27.180 --> 1:02:30.060
 concentrating on that breathing and concentrating,

1:02:30.060 --> 1:02:32.220
 meaning bringing your awareness,

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:34.380
 your so-called interoceptive awareness,

1:02:34.380 --> 1:02:37.040
 if you wanted to get really technical about it,

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:39.340
 your interoceptive awareness to a point

1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:42.220
 just about an inch inside of your forehead.

1:02:42.220 --> 1:02:44.000
 Now, of course, that might sound kind of gory

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:45.940
 to some of you who've never actually been

1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:49.560
 inside your forehead, but just about an inch

1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:50.880
 behind your forehead is where you would want

1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:52.340
 to place your concentration

1:02:52.340 --> 1:02:54.820
 while also concentrating on your breathing.

1:02:54.820 --> 1:02:56.960
 Now, here's the thing about meditation

1:02:56.960 --> 1:02:59.820
 that all studies of meditation show,

1:02:59.820 --> 1:03:04.080
 which is that unless you are a very experienced meditator,

1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:07.480
 your concentration, your focus will drift away

1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:10.460
 from your breathing and away from that location

1:03:10.460 --> 1:03:14.140
 about an inch inside your head, inside your brain,

1:03:14.140 --> 1:03:16.480
 about just behind your forehead.

1:03:17.780 --> 1:03:20.140
 That will happen maybe every 10 seconds,

1:03:20.140 --> 1:03:22.660
 every 20 seconds, maybe even every five seconds.

1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:25.700
 But an important part of such a meditation practice

1:03:25.700 --> 1:03:27.640
 to improve concentration and focus

1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:31.180
 is that you are continually refocusing

1:03:31.180 --> 1:03:32.720
 back to that specific location

1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:35.420
 and refocusing back on your breath.

1:03:35.420 --> 1:03:37.900
 This is something that, again, is not often discussed.

1:03:37.900 --> 1:03:39.540
 People think that if you do a meditation

1:03:39.540 --> 1:03:41.420
 and you're supposed to concentrate on your breath,

1:03:41.420 --> 1:03:42.440
 that if your mind drifts,

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:44.340
 that somehow you failed in that meditation,

1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:46.140
 but actually that's not the case.

1:03:46.140 --> 1:03:49.640
 A huge component of improving your ability

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:52.740
 to focus and concentrate by way of neural plasticity,

1:03:52.740 --> 1:03:55.860
 rewiring of the circuits for focus and concentration

1:03:55.860 --> 1:03:59.520
 is the repeated return to a state of focus

1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:03.220
 from a state of non-focus or diminished focus.

1:04:03.220 --> 1:04:06.600
 So think about it like trying to drive down the freeway

1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:09.500
 and staying between the lane lines, excuse me,

1:04:09.500 --> 1:04:10.560
 and every once in a while,

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:13.020
 because there's a bit of drift on the vehicle,

1:04:13.020 --> 1:04:14.500
 maybe the wheels aren't aligned correctly

1:04:14.500 --> 1:04:16.320
 or there's something else wrong with the chassis

1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:17.340
 or the steering device,

1:04:17.340 --> 1:04:19.060
 it starts to drift right a little bit.

1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:20.660
 Then you hit the rumble strip to go,

1:04:20.660 --> 1:04:22.380
 and then you pull back to the center.

1:04:22.380 --> 1:04:25.880
 That's really what a focused meditation practice is about

1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:28.360
 as opposed to expecting yourself

1:04:28.360 --> 1:04:31.360
 to stay between the mental lane lines, so to speak.

1:04:31.360 --> 1:04:33.460
 So if you're somebody who's going to do a practice

1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:34.580
 of the sort that I described,

1:04:34.580 --> 1:04:37.340
 you know, 13 minute meditation practice every day,

1:04:37.340 --> 1:04:39.360
 you'd want to sit or lie down, close your eyes,

1:04:39.360 --> 1:04:40.760
 start to concentrate on your breath,

1:04:40.760 --> 1:04:42.980
 focus your attention on a location

1:04:42.980 --> 1:04:45.280
 about an inch behind your forehead,

1:04:45.280 --> 1:04:48.120
 and then fully expect that at some point

1:04:48.120 --> 1:04:49.820
 you'll be thinking about something else,

1:04:49.820 --> 1:04:52.820
 and that's a cue to focus back to that location

1:04:52.820 --> 1:04:54.260
 just about an inch behind your forehead

1:04:54.260 --> 1:04:56.200
 and back to your breath.

1:04:56.200 --> 1:04:57.780
 By doing that repeatedly over and over,

1:04:57.780 --> 1:04:59.400
 what you're really training up

1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:02.140
 is the network within your brain

1:05:02.140 --> 1:05:04.540
 that indeed includes that prefrontal cortex

1:05:04.540 --> 1:05:05.380
 that you're focusing on,

1:05:05.380 --> 1:05:06.580
 as well as some other structures,

1:05:06.580 --> 1:05:08.260
 the infratemporal cortex,

1:05:08.260 --> 1:05:10.900
 indeed the hippocampus, a structure associated with memory,

1:05:10.900 --> 1:05:13.220
 and other components of the neural circuit

1:05:13.220 --> 1:05:14.900
 that are involved in directing

1:05:14.900 --> 1:05:17.100
 our mental focus and concentration.

1:05:17.100 --> 1:05:20.340
 Again, I can't emphasize the importance of this practice

1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:22.860
 being one of focusing and refocusing.

1:05:22.860 --> 1:05:25.180
 In fact, I would prefer to call such a practice

1:05:25.180 --> 1:05:29.620
 a refocus-focused meditation or a constantly refocusing,

1:05:29.620 --> 1:05:31.940
 or maybe you all can come up with a better name for it.

1:05:31.940 --> 1:05:33.880
 I'm certainly not that good at naming things.

1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:36.020
 But this sort of meditation practice

1:05:36.020 --> 1:05:38.420
 has been shown in the study by the Suzuki Lab

1:05:38.420 --> 1:05:42.700
 and other studies to really improve people's ability

1:05:42.700 --> 1:05:45.300
 to focus and remain focused,

1:05:45.300 --> 1:05:49.140
 so much so that in the beautiful book, Altered States,

1:05:49.140 --> 1:05:51.460
 they describe a number of different meditation practices,

1:05:51.460 --> 1:05:54.740
 some a little bit longer than the one that I described,

1:05:54.740 --> 1:05:57.000
 one that's 17 minutes, another one that's 30 minutes.

1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:58.980
 Some people meditate as long as 60 minutes a day,

1:05:58.980 --> 1:06:01.080
 although that's quite a long time in my opinion.

1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:03.840
 The point here isn't how long you focus

1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:06.840
 or somehow trying to achieve total focus

1:06:06.840 --> 1:06:09.740
 for the entire 13 minute or 17 minute

1:06:09.740 --> 1:06:12.400
 or 60 minute bout of meditation.

1:06:12.400 --> 1:06:13.740
 While that would be wonderful,

1:06:13.740 --> 1:06:15.820
 and I think many people aspire to do that,

1:06:15.820 --> 1:06:17.320
 that's a lot of hard mental work.

1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:19.740
 I think for most people out there, including myself,

1:06:19.740 --> 1:06:24.180
 a relatively short meditation practice of about 13 minutes

1:06:24.180 --> 1:06:27.500
 in which you fully expect your focus

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:28.740
 and concentration to drift,

1:06:28.740 --> 1:06:30.640
 but that you are continually refocusing

1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:32.540
 is going to be the most effective.

1:06:32.540 --> 1:06:36.040
 Yes, indeed the most effective at teaching yourself

1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:37.740
 to focus and stay concentrated.

1:06:37.740 --> 1:06:40.540
 In fact, I invite you to interpret every time

1:06:40.540 --> 1:06:42.920
 that you focus off that location

1:06:42.920 --> 1:06:44.860
 about one inch behind your forehead

1:06:44.860 --> 1:06:46.340
 as an opportunity to refocus

1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:49.300
 and think about the refocusing as the trigger

1:06:49.300 --> 1:06:51.020
 for teaching your neural circuits

1:06:51.020 --> 1:06:53.620
 how to focus for extended periods of time.

1:06:53.620 --> 1:06:56.340
 And as a bonus to that sort of meditation practice,

1:06:56.340 --> 1:06:57.940
 the study from Wendy Suzuki's lab

1:06:57.940 --> 1:07:01.140
 also showed that people experience improvements in sleep

1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:02.600
 and improvements in memory.

1:07:02.600 --> 1:07:05.040
 So not just improvements in mood and reduction in stress

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:07.460
 and improvements in focus and concentration,

1:07:07.460 --> 1:07:09.120
 but all these other positive benefits

1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:12.220
 from just doing that 13 minute a day meditation practice.

1:07:12.220 --> 1:07:14.060
 It's one that I've started to adopt

1:07:14.060 --> 1:07:15.760
 and have felt tremendous benefit from

1:07:15.760 --> 1:07:18.180
 and that I encourage many of you to try as well.

1:07:18.180 --> 1:07:20.060
 The one cautionary note is the one that I mentioned

1:07:20.060 --> 1:07:21.180
 at the beginning of the episode,

1:07:21.180 --> 1:07:24.760
 which is because the refocus, as I'll call it,

1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:28.520
 meditation does involve a significant amount of effort

1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:31.100
 and engagement of these prefrontal cortical circuits,

1:07:31.100 --> 1:07:33.500
 it is disruptive to sleep

1:07:33.500 --> 1:07:35.040
 if performed too closely to sleep.

1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:36.640
 So if you are going to do that practice,

1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:38.400
 I recommend that you not do it

1:07:38.400 --> 1:07:40.780
 within the four hours prior to your bedtime.

1:07:40.780 --> 1:07:42.300
 Earlier, I mentioned that I would talk about

1:07:42.300 --> 1:07:45.460
 ways to improve focus if you are sleep deprived.

1:07:45.460 --> 1:07:47.780
 This is something that I'm all too familiar with.

1:07:47.780 --> 1:07:50.240
 I put a lot of effort into optimizing my sleep.

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:51.800
 That's something that with each passing year,

1:07:51.800 --> 1:07:53.340
 I put more and more effort into,

1:07:53.340 --> 1:07:55.720
 again, because sleep is so vital for mental health,

1:07:55.720 --> 1:07:58.100
 physical health, and performance of all kinds.

1:07:58.100 --> 1:08:00.840
 But certainly in my role as a student,

1:08:00.840 --> 1:08:03.940
 in my role as a professor, and in my role in life,

1:08:03.940 --> 1:08:06.340
 I've had numerous times in which

1:08:06.340 --> 1:08:07.900
 I simply did not get enough sleep

1:08:07.900 --> 1:08:10.980
 or my sleep was terrible for whatever reason.

1:08:10.980 --> 1:08:13.540
 And yet I still had work demands and social demands,

1:08:13.540 --> 1:08:14.380
 et cetera.

1:08:15.300 --> 1:08:17.060
 One practice that is very effective

1:08:17.060 --> 1:08:20.960
 at allowing you to focus better than you would otherwise

1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:23.020
 under conditions of sleep deprivation

1:08:23.020 --> 1:08:26.280
 is so-called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.

1:08:26.280 --> 1:08:29.100
 This is also referred to sometimes as yoga nidra.

1:08:29.100 --> 1:08:31.100
 Yoga nidra actually means yoga sleep.

1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:35.220
 Yoga nidra is a practice of lying down for about 10 to 30,

1:08:35.220 --> 1:08:37.280
 sometimes even as long as 60 minutes.

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:39.720
 You listen to a script, it's an audio script,

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:42.380
 that takes you through a progressive deep relaxation.

1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:45.220
 It involves a body scan, some long exhale breathing.

1:08:45.220 --> 1:08:47.580
 It is very restorative in the sense that

1:08:47.580 --> 1:08:50.500
 one tends to emerge from yoga nidra or NSDR

1:08:50.500 --> 1:08:52.320
 feeling greatly refreshed

1:08:52.320 --> 1:08:54.900
 compared to how you felt prior to it.

1:08:54.900 --> 1:08:57.260
 There is also terrific neuroimaging data

1:08:57.260 --> 1:08:59.860
 from laboratories in Denmark

1:08:59.860 --> 1:09:02.280
 showing that there's a restoration of dopamine levels

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:05.140
 in the so-called basal ganglia after NSDR,

1:09:05.140 --> 1:09:06.500
 AKA yoga nidra.

1:09:06.500 --> 1:09:09.220
 Whether or not you call it yoga nidra or NSDR,

1:09:09.220 --> 1:09:11.840
 which is what I refer to it as, non-sleep deep rest,

1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:15.380
 you can find these scripts at zero cost, multiple places.

1:09:15.380 --> 1:09:17.180
 You can find, there are certain apps

1:09:17.180 --> 1:09:20.040
 that are NSDR or yoga nidra apps.

1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:24.420
 There is a NSDR protocol that was put out there by Made For,

1:09:24.420 --> 1:09:27.140
 which is on YouTube, that you can access for free.

1:09:27.140 --> 1:09:31.040
 There is a NSDR, or I should say a number of NSDR protocols

1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:32.860
 through the Virtusan app.

1:09:32.860 --> 1:09:34.720
 There are, again, a number of different places

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:38.000
 that one can access NSDR protocols.

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:42.240
 I do NSDR for 10 to 30 minutes per day every single day,

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:44.540
 not just on days where I'm sleep deprived.

1:09:44.540 --> 1:09:45.820
 If I happen to be sleep deprived,

1:09:45.820 --> 1:09:49.280
 I would extend that NSDR to 30 or 60 minutes.

1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:51.280
 And when you do that NSDR will depend on

1:09:51.280 --> 1:09:53.380
 when you have time for that NSDR.

1:09:53.380 --> 1:09:54.380
 When I haven't slept well,

1:09:54.380 --> 1:09:56.340
 what I'll try and do is find a quiet place

1:09:56.340 --> 1:10:00.240
 where I can do NSDR for 30 or ideally 60 minutes.

1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:02.580
 Sometimes I will fall back asleep during that NSDR.

1:10:02.580 --> 1:10:04.740
 That's fine if you do that,

1:10:04.740 --> 1:10:07.900
 but most people will stay awake during the NSDR

1:10:07.900 --> 1:10:10.260
 and then I'll emerge from that and go about my day.

1:10:10.260 --> 1:10:12.420
 If in the afternoon I'm very fatigued

1:10:12.420 --> 1:10:13.300
 because of lack of sleep,

1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:17.540
 I might do another NSDR of 10 to 30 or 60 minutes

1:10:17.540 --> 1:10:18.820
 and then another workout.

1:10:18.820 --> 1:10:21.420
 Again, NSDR is something I do every day.

1:10:21.420 --> 1:10:24.220
 I talk a lot about this in the episodes related to sleep

1:10:24.220 --> 1:10:26.480
 because it can help you get better at falling

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:28.020
 and staying asleep at night

1:10:28.020 --> 1:10:31.000
 in addition to feeling restorative

1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.960
 in that immediate timeframe of the day in which you do NSDR.

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:35.960
 So it's immensely beneficial at various times

1:10:35.960 --> 1:10:37.540
 and for various purposes.

1:10:37.540 --> 1:10:40.100
 But here within the context of trying to concentrate

1:10:40.100 --> 1:10:42.260
 and focus when you're sleep deprived,

1:10:42.260 --> 1:10:46.940
 NSDR, AKA yoga nidra, is an immensely beneficial practice.

1:10:46.940 --> 1:10:49.420
 There's growing amounts of quality science

1:10:49.420 --> 1:10:52.780
 pointing to the neurochemical replenishing effects,

1:10:52.780 --> 1:10:54.460
 as I mentioned before, dopamine,

1:10:54.460 --> 1:10:57.340
 but also the potential for NSDR

1:10:57.340 --> 1:10:59.300
 to replace sleep that you've lost.

1:10:59.300 --> 1:11:01.380
 I would never want anyone to try and use NSDR

1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:03.100
 as a total replacement for sleep,

1:11:03.100 --> 1:11:05.740
 but under conditions in which you cannot control your sleep,

1:11:05.740 --> 1:11:08.660
 NSDR is going to be the best way that I am aware of

1:11:08.660 --> 1:11:11.680
 to restore your ability to focus and concentrate

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:13.060
 for whatever purpose.

1:11:13.060 --> 1:11:14.860
 And if you emerge from your NSDR

1:11:14.860 --> 1:11:15.940
 and then drink some caffeine,

1:11:15.940 --> 1:11:18.940
 you'll notice an even greater capacity

1:11:18.940 --> 1:11:20.180
 for focus and concentration

1:11:20.180 --> 1:11:22.700
 for all the reasons directly related to caffeine.

1:11:22.700 --> 1:11:25.720
 So again, NSDR is a general tool

1:11:25.720 --> 1:11:28.260
 for enhancing your ability to sleep.

1:11:28.260 --> 1:11:31.820
 And it's a tool that you can use in order to compensate for,

1:11:31.820 --> 1:11:34.740
 at least to some degree, compensate for lost sleep

1:11:34.740 --> 1:11:36.660
 when you need to focus and concentrate.

1:11:36.660 --> 1:11:39.860
 One thing that really contrasts NSDR and yoga nidra

1:11:39.860 --> 1:11:41.700
 with the sort of focus meditation

1:11:41.700 --> 1:11:42.960
 that I talked about a few minutes ago,

1:11:42.960 --> 1:11:44.760
 the 13-minute meditation,

1:11:44.760 --> 1:11:46.660
 is that during the 13-minute meditation,

1:11:46.660 --> 1:11:48.940
 you're actively trying to refocus and focus,

1:11:48.940 --> 1:11:50.660
 whereas during NSDR and yoga nidra,

1:11:50.660 --> 1:11:52.780
 you're actually trying to defocus.

1:11:52.780 --> 1:11:54.800
 So you can think of the 13-minute meditation

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:59.220
 for refocusing and focusing as directly tapping into

1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:01.700
 and mediating improvements in the circuitry

1:12:01.700 --> 1:12:02.940
 for focus and concentration,

1:12:02.940 --> 1:12:05.960
 whereas you can think of NSDR and yoga nidra

1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:08.780
 as modulating your brain and body state

1:12:08.780 --> 1:12:12.220
 to allow you to focus and concentrate better.

1:12:12.220 --> 1:12:14.060
 Now, another tool that you can use

1:12:14.060 --> 1:12:17.260
 to directly tap into the circuits for focus and concentration

1:12:17.260 --> 1:12:20.380
 and to greatly accelerate neuroplasticity,

1:12:20.380 --> 1:12:22.460
 the improvements, or I should say,

1:12:22.460 --> 1:12:23.780
 the changes in those circuits

1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:26.140
 that will allow you to focus and concentrate better

1:12:26.140 --> 1:12:27.220
 is hypnosis.

1:12:27.220 --> 1:12:28.500
 A lot of people hear hypnosis

1:12:28.500 --> 1:12:29.820
 and they think stage hypnosis,

1:12:29.820 --> 1:12:31.020
 people squawking like chickens

1:12:31.020 --> 1:12:32.620
 and doing things against their will.

1:12:32.620 --> 1:12:35.940
 But actually, hypnosis is a atypical

1:12:35.940 --> 1:12:37.500
 but highly accessible brain state

1:12:37.500 --> 1:12:40.520
 that's been studied with a lot of rigor

1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:42.620
 at Stanford University School of Medicine

1:12:42.620 --> 1:12:44.340
 by my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel.

1:12:44.340 --> 1:12:46.540
 He's been a guest on this podcast previously.

1:12:46.540 --> 1:12:48.200
 Hypnosis is a unique brain state

1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:51.100
 because it's one in which you are deeply focused

1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:52.640
 and yet deeply relaxed.

1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:55.180
 So to just sort of set up the array of practices here

1:12:55.180 --> 1:12:56.920
 so you can think about them logically,

1:12:56.920 --> 1:13:00.260
 the focus refocus meditation is based on

1:13:00.260 --> 1:13:02.620
 and focused on focus, no pun intended.

1:13:02.620 --> 1:13:06.820
 NSDR and yoga nidra are aimed at deep relaxation.

1:13:06.820 --> 1:13:10.400
 Hypnosis is this atypical, very powerful brain state

1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:13.300
 in which you combine high levels of focus

1:13:13.300 --> 1:13:15.660
 and deep relaxation.

1:13:15.660 --> 1:13:16.920
 Now, it's a little bit of a tough one

1:13:16.920 --> 1:13:18.540
 to just take oneself into,

1:13:18.540 --> 1:13:20.060
 but fortunately there's a tool

1:13:20.060 --> 1:13:22.220
 based on a lot of quality peer-reviewed research

1:13:22.220 --> 1:13:23.740
 from the Spiegel Lab and other labs

1:13:23.740 --> 1:13:26.660
 and that is the Reverie app, R-E-V-E-R-I.

1:13:26.660 --> 1:13:30.260
 The Reverie app is available for no cost,

1:13:30.260 --> 1:13:31.360
 at least for a period of time

1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:33.500
 and then I think they place certain elements of it

1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:37.100
 behind a paywall, but you can try at zero cost.

1:13:37.100 --> 1:13:38.820
 It's available for Apple soon, I think,

1:13:38.820 --> 1:13:40.700
 also to be available for Android

1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:43.340
 and they have specific hypnosis protocols

1:13:43.340 --> 1:13:46.500
 that you listen to and these are very brief protocols,

1:13:46.500 --> 1:13:48.020
 follow the instructions,

1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:49.780
 you're listening to a particular audio script

1:13:49.780 --> 1:13:53.020
 of David Spiegel himself and some progressive breathing

1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:54.620
 and actually some eye movements

1:13:54.620 --> 1:13:56.860
 that are directly linked to the neural circuits

1:13:56.860 --> 1:13:59.820
 that allow for these highly focused, deeply relaxed states

1:13:59.820 --> 1:14:02.220
 and there are components within the Reverie app

1:14:02.220 --> 1:14:04.780
 specifically geared towards improving focus

1:14:04.780 --> 1:14:06.020
 and concentration.

1:14:06.020 --> 1:14:08.980
 So again, there's meditation for focus,

1:14:08.980 --> 1:14:12.020
 there's deliberate decompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,

1:14:12.020 --> 1:14:13.540
 which take you into deep relaxation

1:14:13.540 --> 1:14:17.620
 and then hypnosis is this very special, very directed state

1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:20.860
 of highly focused and highly relaxed

1:14:20.860 --> 1:14:22.480
 or I should say deeply relaxed

1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:24.640
 that allow access to the neural circuits

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:26.340
 for focus and concentration

1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:29.180
 and allow you to tune those up and to improve those

1:14:29.180 --> 1:14:32.040
 very significantly in a very brief amount of time

1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:33.880
 and again, some of those hypnosis scripts

1:14:33.880 --> 1:14:35.100
 are as short as eight minutes,

1:14:35.100 --> 1:14:36.860
 some are as long as 13 minutes.

1:14:36.860 --> 1:14:38.660
 So what we're really talking about here

1:14:38.660 --> 1:14:41.120
 are zero cost tools that directly tap

1:14:41.120 --> 1:14:42.540
 into the neural circuits,

1:14:42.540 --> 1:14:44.120
 the components within your brain

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:47.520
 that allow for deep relaxation, allow for deep focus

1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:51.020
 and improve your ability to focus and concentrate over time

1:14:51.020 --> 1:14:53.020
 simply by repeating these.

1:14:53.020 --> 1:14:56.700
 How often do you need to repeat the Reverie hypnosis

1:14:56.700 --> 1:14:58.940
 for focus and concentration before you see benefits?

1:14:58.940 --> 1:15:01.420
 Well, that will vary from person to person.

1:15:01.420 --> 1:15:04.000
 I tend to use it once every third or fourth day

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:06.580
 and I've experienced tremendous benefits from it.

1:15:06.580 --> 1:15:08.060
 I don't think I'm unique in that sense,

1:15:08.060 --> 1:15:10.180
 they have a lot of data to support this.

1:15:10.180 --> 1:15:13.280
 Reverie app and the protocols within it.

1:15:13.280 --> 1:15:15.220
 How long do you have to do NSDR

1:15:15.220 --> 1:15:16.660
 before you experience those benefits?

1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:18.340
 There I would say the first time and every time

1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:20.580
 because it's so deeply relaxing that you emerge from it

1:15:20.580 --> 1:15:23.980
 feeling quite restored relative to how you went into it.

1:15:23.980 --> 1:15:26.980
 And as I mentioned earlier in the study on meditation,

1:15:26.980 --> 1:15:28.780
 it took about eight weeks to see the effects

1:15:28.780 --> 1:15:30.460
 that they observed in that study

1:15:30.460 --> 1:15:32.460
 but they didn't observe shorter time points.

1:15:32.460 --> 1:15:36.020
 So I highly encourage people to explore meditation

1:15:36.020 --> 1:15:37.420
 geared towards focus and refocus,

1:15:37.420 --> 1:15:40.580
 also NSDR, non-sleep deep breast, AKA yoga nidra

1:15:40.580 --> 1:15:41.620
 and the Reverie app,

1:15:41.620 --> 1:15:44.680
 specifically the hypnosis within the Reverie app

1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:47.300
 that's geared towards improving focus and concentration.

1:15:47.300 --> 1:15:49.740
 All of these have terrific science to support them.

1:15:49.740 --> 1:15:52.100
 This is not woo science or hacks

1:15:52.100 --> 1:15:53.860
 or just something that people came up with.

1:15:53.860 --> 1:15:55.460
 This is all grounded in work

1:15:55.460 --> 1:15:58.180
 from some of the best universities in the world,

1:15:58.180 --> 1:15:59.560
 from excellent groups

1:15:59.560 --> 1:16:01.440
 who've looked at underlying neural mechanisms

1:16:01.440 --> 1:16:04.140
 and measured things with a lot of rigor, et cetera, et cetera.

1:16:04.140 --> 1:16:05.380
 These tools are available to you.

1:16:05.380 --> 1:16:07.500
 I highly recommend that you use them.

1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:09.860
 And if you're interested in the optimal time of day

1:16:09.860 --> 1:16:11.380
 to do these, we already mentioned

1:16:11.380 --> 1:16:14.400
 that the focus, refocus meditation

1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:16.440
 shouldn't be done too close to sleep.

1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:20.320
 The Reverie hypnosis app can be done at any time.

1:16:20.320 --> 1:16:21.980
 Really, in fact, there's a component

1:16:21.980 --> 1:16:23.740
 of falling back asleep in there.

1:16:23.740 --> 1:16:25.420
 In other words, a hypnosis specifically geared

1:16:25.420 --> 1:16:27.980
 toward helping people teach themselves to fall back asleep

1:16:27.980 --> 1:16:29.420
 when they wake up in the middle of the night.

1:16:29.420 --> 1:16:31.860
 NSDR, I always say, can be done first thing in the morning,

1:16:31.860 --> 1:16:33.540
 in the afternoon, or any time of day.

1:16:33.540 --> 1:16:34.860
 And in fact, I'll sometimes do that

1:16:34.860 --> 1:16:36.420
 in the middle of the night if I happen to wake up

1:16:36.420 --> 1:16:38.100
 and need to get back to sleep.

1:16:38.100 --> 1:16:41.340
 So really, these tools can be applied most any time of day,

1:16:41.340 --> 1:16:42.800
 except for that one caveat

1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:44.580
 about the focus, refocus meditation

1:16:44.580 --> 1:16:46.540
 not being done too close to sleep.

1:16:46.540 --> 1:16:48.480
 Now, there's another set of behavioral tools

1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:51.420
 that can really help enhance one's ability to focus,

1:16:51.420 --> 1:16:54.180
 and those are visual-based tools.

1:16:54.180 --> 1:16:55.820
 In fact, the tools I'm about to describe

1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:58.780
 are actually being employed in a number of schools

1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:01.660
 in China and elsewhere in order to teach children

1:17:01.660 --> 1:17:05.360
 to focus better and for longer periods of time.

1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:07.620
 Now, the key principle here

1:17:07.620 --> 1:17:10.620
 is that much of our cognitive focus,

1:17:10.620 --> 1:17:13.120
 our ability to think about something in a very specific way

1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:17.140
 and stay focused on it, to read or to follow a line

1:17:17.140 --> 1:17:20.260
 of conversation or math or music, et cetera,

1:17:20.260 --> 1:17:24.020
 is going to be directed by our visual system.

1:17:24.020 --> 1:17:26.540
 Our visual system has two forms of attention and focus.

1:17:26.540 --> 1:17:29.440
 One is overt focus, which is very straightforward.

1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:30.780
 If I'm looking at the tip of my pen,

1:17:30.780 --> 1:17:31.800
 for those of you who are listening right now,

1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:33.860
 I'm looking at the tip of my pen, that's overt focus.

1:17:33.860 --> 1:17:35.780
 I'm focusing on it with my eyes,

1:17:35.780 --> 1:17:38.220
 and of course, the rest of my brain then will follow

1:17:38.220 --> 1:17:40.700
 and start to analyze the details of what I'm seeing,

1:17:40.700 --> 1:17:42.620
 the contours of the pen, et cetera.

1:17:42.620 --> 1:17:44.660
 It seems sort of obvious when you first hear it,

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:47.220
 but our cognitive focus tends to follow

1:17:47.220 --> 1:17:49.540
 our overt visual focus.

1:17:49.540 --> 1:17:51.760
 That's also why they put blinders on horses.

1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:54.960
 That's also why sometimes wearing a hoodie or a hat

1:17:54.960 --> 1:17:57.940
 or limiting your visual field in some way

1:17:57.940 --> 1:18:00.320
 can help you enhance your cognitive focus.

1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:01.700
 It can help limit distraction.

1:18:01.700 --> 1:18:03.900
 You're just not seeing as much.

1:18:03.900 --> 1:18:05.740
 It's also why when we ingest caffeine

1:18:05.740 --> 1:18:07.620
 or any kind of stimulant or we are stressed

1:18:07.620 --> 1:18:09.780
 and our pupils dilate and our vision becomes

1:18:09.780 --> 1:18:12.660
 more tunnel-like, less panoramic, but more tunnel-like,

1:18:12.660 --> 1:18:14.260
 they say a soda straw view of the world

1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:16.260
 or you're looking through a tunnel,

1:18:16.260 --> 1:18:18.180
 your focus, your visual focus,

1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:19.960
 is actually driving your cognitive focus.

1:18:19.960 --> 1:18:23.140
 Your cognitive focus is narrower than it would be

1:18:23.140 --> 1:18:25.020
 if you were seeing the whole scene that you're in.

1:18:25.020 --> 1:18:26.460
 So when you hear this, it sounds obvious,

1:18:26.460 --> 1:18:28.620
 but for many people, including many scientists,

1:18:28.620 --> 1:18:30.420
 it's just not obvious that this would be the case.

1:18:30.420 --> 1:18:31.880
 However that is the case,

1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:34.780
 your visual focus drives your cognitive focus.

1:18:34.780 --> 1:18:38.140
 So what is a practice that has been studied

1:18:38.140 --> 1:18:40.420
 in various laboratories and that's being employed

1:18:40.420 --> 1:18:44.100
 in various schools is to have children or adults

1:18:44.100 --> 1:18:48.560
 visually focus on one location for a given period of time.

1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:49.580
 How long?

1:18:49.580 --> 1:18:52.300
 Anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes.

1:18:52.300 --> 1:18:53.940
 And believe it or not, three minutes is a long time

1:18:53.940 --> 1:18:57.060
 to maintain visual focus at one location.

1:18:57.060 --> 1:18:58.140
 If you were to try that right now,

1:18:58.140 --> 1:19:00.160
 you'd probably find it to be a bit of a strain,

1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:01.780
 but if you want to try it, you can.

1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:05.100
 Keep in mind, you, yes, are allowed to blink,

1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:08.700
 but also keep in mind that meditation refocusing practice

1:19:08.700 --> 1:19:10.280
 that we talked about earlier,

1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:13.580
 that the refocusing is the key component

1:19:13.580 --> 1:19:16.260
 of teaching yourself or your brain,

1:19:16.260 --> 1:19:17.420
 you are your brain, your brain is you,

1:19:17.420 --> 1:19:19.860
 but to teach yourself how to focus better.

1:19:19.860 --> 1:19:23.180
 So if you're going to incorporate this practice,

1:19:23.180 --> 1:19:25.380
 what you would want to do is pick a location.

1:19:25.380 --> 1:19:26.460
 It could be on a wall,

1:19:26.460 --> 1:19:28.220
 it could be on your computer in front of you,

1:19:28.220 --> 1:19:30.140
 although I would encourage it to not be the contents

1:19:30.140 --> 1:19:31.020
 of your computer screen.

1:19:31.020 --> 1:19:32.660
 You might just want to blank your screen.

1:19:32.660 --> 1:19:33.860
 You might want to put a piece of paper

1:19:33.860 --> 1:19:36.660
 with a cross hatch there, any sort of visual target,

1:19:36.660 --> 1:19:38.140
 or you can imagine a visual target,

1:19:38.140 --> 1:19:40.540
 and then focus your visual attention on that target

1:19:40.540 --> 1:19:43.020
 and try to breathe normally, try and stay relaxed,

1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:44.420
 and certainly allow yourself to blink

1:19:44.420 --> 1:19:45.880
 so that your eyes don't dry out.

1:19:45.880 --> 1:19:49.240
 This is not a test of how long you can go without blinking.

1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:51.900
 By focusing on that particular location

1:19:51.900 --> 1:19:54.460
 and by forcing yourself to refocus on that location,

1:19:54.460 --> 1:19:58.740
 anytime your gaze, your vision drifts from that location,

1:19:58.740 --> 1:20:02.120
 you are encouraging the circuits for focus

1:20:02.120 --> 1:20:04.340
 to get better at focusing for longer and longer

1:20:04.340 --> 1:20:06.840
 and at refocusing when your focus drifts off

1:20:06.840 --> 1:20:08.060
 of that location.

1:20:08.060 --> 1:20:09.620
 This is incorporating neural circuits,

1:20:09.620 --> 1:20:11.040
 including the prefrontal cortex,

1:20:11.040 --> 1:20:12.580
 things like the frontal eye field.

1:20:12.580 --> 1:20:15.080
 For those of you curious about the underlying biology,

1:20:15.080 --> 1:20:18.000
 this practice is recruiting certain elements

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:19.500
 of your so-called prefrontal cortex,

1:20:19.500 --> 1:20:21.460
 also the frontal eye fields,

1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:24.140
 which are locations not far from the prefrontal cortex

1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:26.620
 that are involved in deliberately directing your gaze

1:20:26.620 --> 1:20:30.100
 to particular locations in space, not outer space,

1:20:30.100 --> 1:20:32.820
 although you could do this by focusing on stars, I suppose,

1:20:32.820 --> 1:20:35.100
 but in visual space.

1:20:35.100 --> 1:20:39.040
 Now, I mentioned before that this is overt visual focus

1:20:39.040 --> 1:20:39.880
 and attention.

1:20:39.880 --> 1:20:42.020
 You are overtly looking at that location,

1:20:42.020 --> 1:20:44.380
 but one also very powerful practice

1:20:44.380 --> 1:20:48.080
 for improving focus and concentration

1:20:48.080 --> 1:20:50.620
 is to use covert focus.

1:20:50.620 --> 1:20:53.180
 Covert focus is where my gaze,

1:20:53.180 --> 1:20:56.300
 my eyes are focused on one location such as my pen,

1:20:56.300 --> 1:20:59.740
 but my focus is actually directed elsewhere

1:20:59.740 --> 1:21:01.500
 in the room or location that I'm in.

1:21:01.500 --> 1:21:04.060
 My mind and to some extent,

1:21:04.060 --> 1:21:07.380
 my peripheral vision is focused in this case on the door

1:21:07.380 --> 1:21:09.340
 just to my left in the room that I'm in.

1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:10.740
 That takes a little bit more effort.

1:21:10.740 --> 1:21:12.780
 This is something that all old world primates

1:21:12.780 --> 1:21:15.620
 of which we are old world primates are able to do.

1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:18.040
 And it probably evolved as part of the mechanism

1:21:18.040 --> 1:21:21.860
 by which animals could evaluate their scene,

1:21:21.860 --> 1:21:25.820
 evaluate predators, evaluate other primates

1:21:25.820 --> 1:21:28.620
 while not necessarily staring at them directly

1:21:28.620 --> 1:21:30.340
 so they can obtain information.

1:21:30.340 --> 1:21:31.460
 We can obtain information

1:21:31.460 --> 1:21:32.860
 without having to direct our gaze

1:21:32.860 --> 1:21:34.220
 specifically to one location.

1:21:34.220 --> 1:21:37.120
 Maybe we can obtain information from multiple locations.

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:38.780
 Indeed, we can.

1:21:38.780 --> 1:21:41.480
 Without getting too far down the rabbit hole

1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:44.660
 of how vision and cognition relate

1:21:44.660 --> 1:21:47.220
 because we've done episodes on that previously

1:21:47.220 --> 1:21:49.980
 and simply focusing on the tools

1:21:49.980 --> 1:21:53.380
 that can be incorporated to improve focus and concentration,

1:21:53.380 --> 1:21:55.140
 here's what I recommend.

1:21:55.140 --> 1:21:57.860
 Set yourself a low bar at first

1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:02.300
 and set a timer and try to focus on one location

1:22:02.300 --> 1:22:05.140
 for 30 seconds and that's it for that day.

1:22:05.140 --> 1:22:07.160
 The next day, you might add five seconds

1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:09.300
 and then the next day, five seconds after that.

1:22:09.300 --> 1:22:11.180
 If you miss a day, no big deal,

1:22:11.180 --> 1:22:14.520
 simply do the practice for the same amount of time

1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:16.700
 that you did the last time that you did the practice

1:22:16.700 --> 1:22:19.800
 and then gradually try and increase the amount of time

1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:23.100
 that you can focus on one visual location overtly

1:22:23.100 --> 1:22:24.940
 by looking directly at that location.

1:22:25.980 --> 1:22:28.020
 If you like and if you feel you have the ability,

1:22:28.020 --> 1:22:30.860
 you can try and do this through covert attention and focus

1:22:30.860 --> 1:22:32.780
 by looking straightforward, for instance,

1:22:32.780 --> 1:22:34.580
 and attending to something in the corner of the room

1:22:34.580 --> 1:22:36.820
 and trying to do that for 30 seconds.

1:22:36.820 --> 1:22:38.460
 You'll find that that's quite a bit harder

1:22:38.460 --> 1:22:40.580
 and then extending that by five seconds

1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:42.360
 every time you do the practice.

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:43.460
 This is something that I don't think

1:22:43.460 --> 1:22:45.580
 you necessarily have to build up to being able to do

1:22:45.580 --> 1:22:47.740
 for a full hour in order to extract the benefits.

1:22:47.740 --> 1:22:50.520
 In fact, the best way to think about this practice

1:22:50.520 --> 1:22:53.420
 is as a means to get into a focused state.

1:22:53.420 --> 1:22:56.620
 If you remember back about an hour or so ago,

1:22:56.620 --> 1:22:59.060
 I was talking about how focused states

1:22:59.060 --> 1:23:03.500
 are not a drop all the way in and then exit type phenomenon.

1:23:03.500 --> 1:23:05.160
 We don't just drop into a focused state

1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:07.180
 the same way we don't drop into the peak performance

1:23:07.180 --> 1:23:08.860
 of a workout, we warm up.

1:23:08.860 --> 1:23:12.460
 So what I recommend is having a 30 second

1:23:12.460 --> 1:23:17.460
 to three minute period at the beginning of about a focus

1:23:17.460 --> 1:23:19.600
 where you're going to do work or physical work

1:23:19.600 --> 1:23:23.500
 and anchoring your vision to one location

1:23:23.500 --> 1:23:24.800
 somewhere in the room,

1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:26.880
 or if you want to do it covertly, you can do that.

1:23:26.880 --> 1:23:28.520
 Setting a timer and trying to do that

1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:30.720
 for anywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes.

1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:34.960
 What you're doing when you exercise that practice

1:23:34.960 --> 1:23:38.160
 is you are ramping up neural activity

1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:39.680
 within the neural circuits

1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:41.920
 that create focus and concentration.

1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:44.520
 Then I would stop looking at that location

1:23:44.520 --> 1:23:45.720
 or that covert location,

1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:47.520
 and then I would move to the work that you're trying to do,

1:23:47.520 --> 1:23:49.720
 either mental work or physical work.

1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:52.480
 And if about halfway through your 90 minute bout

1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:55.200
 or at some point in your 90 minute bout of work or exercise,

1:23:55.200 --> 1:23:57.080
 you feel that your concentration is drifting,

1:23:57.080 --> 1:23:58.360
 rather than look at your phone

1:23:58.360 --> 1:24:01.080
 and scroll through the thousands of contexts

1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:03.400
 that exist within social media or your phone,

1:24:03.400 --> 1:24:05.800
 try just picking a location again on the wall,

1:24:05.800 --> 1:24:07.680
 focusing back on that location,

1:24:07.680 --> 1:24:10.840
 using that as a ramp up to then direct your focus

1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:13.200
 back towards if your weight training sets and reps

1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:14.120
 that you might be performing,

1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:16.420
 if you're running, you might do this,

1:24:16.420 --> 1:24:18.020
 or cycling, you might do this

1:24:18.020 --> 1:24:19.700
 by focusing on a particular location

1:24:19.700 --> 1:24:23.000
 and really homing in on that location physically.

1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:25.680
 And this is a practice that a lot of athletes use in fact.

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:28.520
 And if you're say doing musical practice or math,

1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:30.200
 well then you'd want to focus on something

1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:32.520
 other than the task that you're trying to perform.

1:24:32.520 --> 1:24:35.960
 But again, using visual focus as a way to ramp up

1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:39.560
 and increase your overall ability to focus and concentrate

1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:41.460
 and then applying that to whatever it is

1:24:41.460 --> 1:24:43.480
 that you're trying to learn or perform.

1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:45.080
 Next, I'd like to talk about compounds

1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:47.720
 that can improve concentration and focus.

1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:50.120
 And these are most often consumed as supplements,

1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:51.720
 although some of them I should mention

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:54.000
 can also be derived from food.

1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.920
 Again, I just want to remind you that there are things,

1:24:56.920 --> 1:24:58.000
 in this case compounds,

1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.680
 that can modulate a biological mechanism,

1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:03.440
 that is can modulate focus and concentration.

1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:06.760
 And there are compounds that can mediate,

1:25:06.760 --> 1:25:11.380
 can directly contribute to concentration and focus.

1:25:11.380 --> 1:25:14.480
 One of the key compounds that supports concentration

1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:17.160
 and focus because it generally supports mood,

1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:20.800
 concentration and focus and brain function in general

1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:23.340
 are the omega-3 essential fatty acids.

1:25:23.340 --> 1:25:25.920
 I've talked about the omega-3 essential fatty acids

1:25:25.920 --> 1:25:27.840
 in a variety of contexts, in particular depression,

1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:31.320
 but also ADHD, there are interesting data on that.

1:25:31.320 --> 1:25:33.160
 And it's really clear that getting somewhere

1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:36.420
 between one and three grams of EPA,

1:25:36.420 --> 1:25:39.860
 that is one to three grams of EPA essential fatty acid

1:25:39.860 --> 1:25:43.000
 per day can improve outcomes,

1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.740
 that is can improve mood and can improve cognitive function.

1:25:46.740 --> 1:25:48.680
 And while there's some debate about

1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:50.680
 whether or not I can improve cardiac function,

1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:52.740
 it's very clear, at least to me,

1:25:52.740 --> 1:25:54.840
 that ingesting one to three grams

1:25:54.840 --> 1:25:58.000
 of EPA essential fatty acids per day is beneficial.

1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.920
 But again, in the context of focus and concentration,

1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:04.820
 it's in modulating the neural circuits and brain function

1:26:04.820 --> 1:26:07.160
 that are going to support focus and concentration.

1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:10.680
 It's not as if taking one to three grams of EPA

1:26:10.680 --> 1:26:14.000
 essential fatty acids per day is going to tap directly

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.000
 into only the circuits for focus and concentration.

1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:20.720
 That said, and as discussed on the episode

1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:23.560
 of the Huberman Lab podcast with Dr. Rhonda Patrick,

1:26:23.560 --> 1:26:26.680
 and on the episode on ADHD that I did,

1:26:26.680 --> 1:26:28.600
 and on the episode on depression that I did,

1:26:28.600 --> 1:26:30.280
 I make it a point to ingest

1:26:30.280 --> 1:26:33.580
 one to three grams of EPAs per day.

1:26:33.580 --> 1:26:36.720
 You can get those EPAs from other sources

1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:39.000
 besides supplements, of course,

1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.240
 but supplements are going to be the easiest way to do that.

1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:42.600
 You could do that through liquid form,

1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:44.220
 fish oil, cod liver oil.

1:26:44.220 --> 1:26:47.240
 Some people who are vegan opt for other sources of EPAs.

1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:48.800
 You can find those out there, certainly.

1:26:48.800 --> 1:26:50.680
 Some people even use prescription EPAs

1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:53.080
 to get the dosage really high.

1:26:53.080 --> 1:26:55.720
 Dr. Rhonda Patrick talked about this in the episode with me.

1:26:55.720 --> 1:26:57.140
 That's actually something that she does.

1:26:57.140 --> 1:26:58.440
 I don't take the prescription form.

1:26:58.440 --> 1:27:00.400
 I get them through pill form

1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:03.600
 through our supplement affiliate, which is Momentus.

1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:05.960
 But there are a number of different quality sources

1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:07.840
 of EPAs out there.

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:09.080
 And some of those quality sources

1:27:09.080 --> 1:27:11.560
 also include things like fatty fish, algae,

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:12.660
 and things of that sort.

1:27:12.660 --> 1:27:13.960
 So I'll leave it to you as to whether or not

1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:16.320
 you supplement with omega-3 fatty acids

1:27:16.320 --> 1:27:17.960
 in order to get that one to three grams per day,

1:27:17.960 --> 1:27:19.480
 or whether or not you do it through food.

1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:22.660
 But I would encourage you to try and reach that threshold

1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:25.440
 because there are a number of known positive effects

1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:27.700
 for mood and brain function generally.

1:27:27.700 --> 1:27:31.080
 The other thing that can positively modulate brain function

1:27:31.080 --> 1:27:35.120
 and that actually works as a fuel for neurons to function

1:27:35.120 --> 1:27:36.720
 and can improve cognitive performance

1:27:36.720 --> 1:27:38.880
 and particularly within the brain circuits,

1:27:38.880 --> 1:27:40.800
 such as the prefrontal cortex that are involved

1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:43.300
 in concentration and focus is creatine.

1:27:43.300 --> 1:27:45.860
 I know many people are familiar with creatine monohydrate

1:27:45.860 --> 1:27:48.420
 for its effects on muscle growth

1:27:48.420 --> 1:27:50.120
 and strength and performance,

1:27:50.120 --> 1:27:52.600
 but it's quite clear that the bulk of scientific studies

1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:55.680
 have examined the role of creatine in the clinical context

1:27:55.680 --> 1:27:58.480
 and as its role in improving cognitive performance.

1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:00.680
 So my read of the literature has led to a practice

1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:03.040
 in which I ingest five grams per day

1:28:03.040 --> 1:28:04.640
 of creatine monohydrate,

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:07.480
 the sort of standard form that's available in,

1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:09.400
 this is generally available as a powder.

1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:10.520
 That's certainly how I take it.

1:28:10.520 --> 1:28:11.960
 I take the creatine powder,

1:28:11.960 --> 1:28:14.300
 I'll mix it with water or with my athletic greens

1:28:14.300 --> 1:28:16.060
 or some sort of electrolyte drink,

1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:18.920
 whatever liquid happens to be convenient to ingest that in.

1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:20.820
 The time of day doesn't really seem to be important.

1:28:20.820 --> 1:28:22.000
 Some people are strong believers

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:25.120
 in consuming creatine post-workout.

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:26.460
 While that might be beneficial,

1:28:26.460 --> 1:28:29.740
 I simply take it in the morning or post-workout.

1:28:29.740 --> 1:28:32.300
 It sort of depends on when I remember to take it.

1:28:32.300 --> 1:28:34.740
 But that five grams of creatine per day,

1:28:34.740 --> 1:28:37.260
 in my case, really isn't geared towards muscle growth

1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:40.360
 or strength or performance as much as geared toward

1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:43.640
 tapping into the creatine phosphate system within the brain

1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:46.920
 and specifically the benefits of creatine

1:28:46.920 --> 1:28:48.300
 for prefrontal cortical networks.

1:28:48.300 --> 1:28:50.760
 Again, modulating, not directly mediating,

1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:54.880
 but modulating and generally supporting the brain networks

1:28:54.880 --> 1:28:56.680
 that are going to allow me to generate

1:28:56.680 --> 1:28:58.240
 focus and concentration.

1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:01.960
 So much like sleep, much like omega-3 fatty acids,

1:29:01.960 --> 1:29:04.000
 creatine monohydrate, five grams a day,

1:29:04.000 --> 1:29:06.200
 seems to generally support brain function,

1:29:06.200 --> 1:29:09.760
 which will generally support concentration and focus.

1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:12.480
 Now, in terms of compounds that more specifically

1:29:12.480 --> 1:29:14.640
 mediate concentration and focus,

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:16.760
 we have to go back to that aero metaphor model

1:29:16.760 --> 1:29:18.760
 that we talked about at the beginning of the episode

1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:22.960
 that included epinephrine, adrenaline, acetylcholine,

1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:25.000
 which acts as this attentional spotlight.

1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:28.280
 In fact, acetylcholine and elevated levels of acetylcholine

1:29:28.280 --> 1:29:30.040
 have been shown over and over again

1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:33.120
 through beautiful work from Mike Merzenich's lab at UCSF

1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:36.080
 and the Kilgard lab down in Houston

1:29:36.080 --> 1:29:37.320
 and a number of other labs,

1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:40.040
 including Norm Weinberger's lab at UC Irvine,

1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:45.040
 again to improve or even directly gate neural plasticity

1:29:46.720 --> 1:29:49.400
 by increasing focus directly.

1:29:49.400 --> 1:29:50.440
 That's a lot of word soup,

1:29:50.440 --> 1:29:51.760
 but basically what happens is

1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:54.260
 if acetylcholine transmission is increased

1:29:54.260 --> 1:29:56.080
 even transiently within the brain,

1:29:56.080 --> 1:29:57.600
 there's a greater opportunity

1:29:57.600 --> 1:29:59.520
 for neural plasticity to take place.

1:29:59.520 --> 1:30:01.880
 And the reason there's a greater opportunity

1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:05.160
 for neural plasticity, AKA learning to take place

1:30:05.160 --> 1:30:08.080
 is by way of the increased focus

1:30:08.080 --> 1:30:11.000
 that spiking acetylcholine can provide.

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:11.840
 As I mentioned earlier,

1:30:11.840 --> 1:30:14.040
 there are a number of different foods which contain choline.

1:30:14.040 --> 1:30:15.560
 You can look those up online.

1:30:15.560 --> 1:30:18.840
 Choline acting as an amino acid precursor to acetylcholine,

1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:19.980
 but of course there are compounds,

1:30:19.980 --> 1:30:21.520
 there are supplements that can further

1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:23.400
 and more acutely increase acetylcholine.

1:30:23.400 --> 1:30:25.080
 And indeed I use these myself.

1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:28.640
 The most effective one I've found is alpha-GPC.

1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:33.060
 Alpha-GPC consumed at dosages of 300 milligrams

1:30:33.060 --> 1:30:35.880
 to 600 milligrams prior to a workout

1:30:35.880 --> 1:30:38.880
 or prior to a workout greatly increase

1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:40.600
 one's ability to focus and concentrate.

1:30:40.600 --> 1:30:42.000
 At least that's been my experience.

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:44.260
 And there are some good data in humans.

1:30:44.260 --> 1:30:46.240
 So how would I use alpha-GPC?

1:30:46.240 --> 1:30:49.960
 I would use alpha-GPC by taking it about 10 to 20 minutes

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:52.600
 prior to any time I want to focus

1:30:52.600 --> 1:30:54.700
 or concentrate very deeply.

1:30:54.700 --> 1:30:57.860
 I've taken as much as 600 milligrams at one time.

1:30:57.860 --> 1:31:00.080
 Although I find that 300 milligrams is enough for me

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:02.700
 and I tend to be quite sensitive to supplements

1:31:02.700 --> 1:31:04.060
 and caffeine in general.

1:31:04.060 --> 1:31:07.460
 So I'll sometimes take it alongside yerba mate

1:31:07.460 --> 1:31:10.800
 or with yerba mate or with coffee prior to a workout

1:31:10.800 --> 1:31:12.800
 or prior to a bout of work

1:31:12.800 --> 1:31:15.260
 in which I'm focusing on mental work.

1:31:15.260 --> 1:31:17.240
 So it could be reading, writing, could be math,

1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:18.880
 could be data analysis, could be anything

1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:21.000
 where I need a lot of focus and concentration.

1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:22.640
 Now, a number of people have contacted me

1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:26.900
 about a recent study suggesting that alpha-GPC

1:31:26.900 --> 1:31:28.680
 when taken chronically over many years

1:31:28.680 --> 1:31:32.180
 could increase one's vulnerability to stroke.

1:31:32.180 --> 1:31:35.720
 I've looked at those data and my read of the data

1:31:35.720 --> 1:31:37.600
 is that they're not very conclusive.

1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:40.480
 Although anytime you see something like that,

1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:42.240
 you know, a study that's pointing to the fact

1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:44.680
 that a given compound might increase the propensity

1:31:44.680 --> 1:31:47.360
 for stroke, you obviously want to be concerned.

1:31:47.360 --> 1:31:50.680
 So we have to ask ourselves how, by what mechanism that is,

1:31:50.680 --> 1:31:54.720
 could alpha-GPC be increasing the susceptibility to stroke?

1:31:54.720 --> 1:31:57.960
 And it seems to be related to increases in TMAO,

1:31:57.960 --> 1:32:01.860
 which is a marker related to the cardiovascular system.

1:32:01.860 --> 1:32:06.160
 And one known way to offset increases in TMAO

1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:08.480
 that are associated either with alpha-GPC

1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:11.520
 or increases due to other things,

1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:13.920
 so ingestion of particular food compounds

1:32:13.920 --> 1:32:15.680
 actually can increase TMAO,

1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:20.160
 is to offset that by taking 600 milligrams of garlic.

1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:23.080
 Now, I've been taking alpha-GPC pretty consistently

1:32:23.080 --> 1:32:23.940
 for a number of years.

1:32:23.940 --> 1:32:25.260
 I do not take it every day.

1:32:25.260 --> 1:32:27.360
 I would say I take it about four days per week,

1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:30.400
 again, prior to workouts or bouts of cognitive work.

1:32:30.400 --> 1:32:33.040
 I have not seen my TMAO spike

1:32:33.040 --> 1:32:36.400
 and I've evaluated that by way of blood tests,

1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:39.380
 but nonetheless, I take 600 milligrams of garlic

1:32:39.380 --> 1:32:42.480
 in capsule form anytime I eat anyway,

1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:44.640
 and I do that for general cardiovascular function.

1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:45.640
 And there's some interesting data

1:32:45.640 --> 1:32:48.680
 on immune system function, et cetera, for garlic.

1:32:48.680 --> 1:32:52.600
 So I've been consuming 600 milligram capsules of garlic

1:32:52.600 --> 1:32:54.720
 for some period of time, some days I'll ingest

1:32:54.720 --> 1:32:57.880
 just one 600 milligram capsule, other times I'll take two.

1:32:57.880 --> 1:33:02.480
 But based on this recent study and the concerns about TMAO,

1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:05.920
 I make it a point to always ingest a 600 milligram capsule

1:33:05.920 --> 1:33:09.120
 of garlic anytime I take alpha-GPC,

1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:11.660
 which again for me is about four days per week.

1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:14.560
 So in our model of attention and focus,

1:33:14.560 --> 1:33:16.960
 you can now clearly see why taking alpha-GPC,

1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:19.120
 which increases acetylcholine transmission

1:33:19.120 --> 1:33:21.560
 would be beneficial for concentration and focus

1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:24.360
 and why taking it with a double espresso

1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:26.680
 or why taking it with yerba mate

1:33:26.680 --> 1:33:29.780
 would further increase concentration and focus

1:33:29.780 --> 1:33:31.640
 because as I mentioned earlier,

1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:34.600
 caffeine is going to increase epinephrine,

1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:36.320
 it's also going to increase the density

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:38.840
 of dopamine receptors and the alpha-GPC

1:33:38.840 --> 1:33:40.120
 is going to increase acetylcholine,

1:33:40.120 --> 1:33:41.640
 this spotlighting for cognition,

1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:44.520
 this ability to really amplify the activity

1:33:44.520 --> 1:33:45.940
 of specific neural networks,

1:33:45.940 --> 1:33:47.600
 which is largely what's happening

1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:50.360
 when you're trying to focus and pay attention

1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:51.680
 to something specifically.

1:33:51.680 --> 1:33:53.700
 So if one wants to increase the amount

1:33:53.700 --> 1:33:56.500
 of dopamine transmission in the brain and body

1:33:56.500 --> 1:33:59.440
 for sake of increasing concentration and focus,

1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:01.440
 one of the most efficient ways to do that

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:04.460
 is by ingestion of the amino acid L-tyrosine.

1:34:04.460 --> 1:34:06.840
 Again, L-tyrosine can be derived from food sources,

1:34:06.840 --> 1:34:08.760
 I invite you to look up those various food sources

1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:10.280
 on the web, simply go to a web browser

1:34:10.280 --> 1:34:12.440
 and put in foods that contain a lot of L-tyrosine

1:34:12.440 --> 1:34:15.480
 and you'll get a rich array of choices to select from.

1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:19.500
 But in my case, I use L-tyrosine in capsule form,

1:34:19.500 --> 1:34:22.080
 I will take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,

1:34:22.080 --> 1:34:25.140
 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC and a cup of coffee,

1:34:25.140 --> 1:34:27.220
 I'm careful to do this early in the day,

1:34:27.220 --> 1:34:28.900
 certainly not after two or 3 p.m.

1:34:28.900 --> 1:34:31.000
 because I don't want to diminish my ability

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:33.040
 to fall and stay asleep that night,

1:34:33.040 --> 1:34:34.760
 do this early in the day before a workout

1:34:34.760 --> 1:34:39.060
 or before a bout of concentrated mental work.

1:34:39.060 --> 1:34:41.720
 Again, I tend to do this about four days per week,

1:34:41.720 --> 1:34:45.720
 so certainly not every time I sit down to do work.

1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:47.720
 And I should also mention

1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:49.640
 that I still tend to do the behavioral tools,

1:34:49.640 --> 1:34:51.800
 I'll tend to use five minutes of binaural beats

1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:53.980
 or binaural beats throughout the work session,

1:34:53.980 --> 1:34:56.840
 sometimes do an ice bath or a cold shower before,

1:34:56.840 --> 1:34:58.320
 I don't want to give the impression

1:34:58.320 --> 1:35:01.760
 that I combine every tool that I've talked about today

1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:02.920
 for a given workout,

1:35:02.920 --> 1:35:04.920
 I mean, that would be pretty wild too,

1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:07.060
 take a cold shower, pop an L-tyrosine,

1:35:07.060 --> 1:35:09.240
 take an alpha-GPC, drink two espresso,

1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:10.360
 listen to binaural beats,

1:35:10.360 --> 1:35:13.440
 that to me seems like a very inefficient way

1:35:13.440 --> 1:35:14.820
 to go about life.

1:35:14.820 --> 1:35:16.560
 In fact, I make it a point

1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:19.960
 to try and use tools to increase my ability

1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:21.800
 to concentrate and focus,

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:24.060
 but not to combine more than two or three of them

1:35:24.060 --> 1:35:24.900
 at any one time.

1:35:24.900 --> 1:35:25.800
 And when I say two or three,

1:35:25.800 --> 1:35:27.200
 what I mean is I will use supplements

1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:30.040
 like alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine, and caffeine together

1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:31.800
 before certain work bouts,

1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:33.720
 I might use the visual practice

1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:35.500
 of focusing on a given location for a minute

1:35:35.500 --> 1:35:37.640
 before I begin that work bout,

1:35:37.640 --> 1:35:38.920
 I might combine those,

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:41.720
 then another time I might take a cold shower

1:35:41.720 --> 1:35:43.100
 prior to doing some work.

1:35:43.100 --> 1:35:45.800
 Other days, I confess, I've slept very well,

1:35:45.800 --> 1:35:48.720
 or my enthusiasm about what I'm about to work on

1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:51.480
 is such that I don't require any of these tools.

1:35:51.480 --> 1:35:53.840
 Again, there's no requirement,

1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:55.800
 there's no pressure to use any of these tools,

1:35:55.800 --> 1:35:59.040
 behavioral, supplement-based, or otherwise.

1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:02.000
 It's simply a matter of using the tools

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:03.740
 that are going to allow you to achieve the states

1:36:03.740 --> 1:36:06.600
 you want to achieve and to improve your ability

1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:09.240
 to go into those states without any help at all.

1:36:09.240 --> 1:36:11.760
 And this is what I find particularly attractive

1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:12.600
 about supplements.

1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:14.040
 It's not so much that they put you

1:36:14.040 --> 1:36:16.280
 into the ideal state for that work,

1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:18.160
 and then you accomplish that work,

1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:20.440
 and then you always rely on those supplements.

1:36:20.440 --> 1:36:22.720
 I prefer to look at supplements of the sort

1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:24.720
 that I just described as a route

1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:28.080
 into a deeper trench of focus and concentration

1:36:28.080 --> 1:36:30.780
 that I use as a tool to teach myself

1:36:30.780 --> 1:36:32.380
 to focus and concentrate more deeply,

1:36:32.380 --> 1:36:35.560
 such that I don't need those tools every single time

1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:37.280
 I try and focus and concentrate.

1:36:38.100 --> 1:36:39.380
 I think this is an important point

1:36:39.380 --> 1:36:41.840
 because I think that many people think of supplements

1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:46.840
 as a crutch or a way of simply getting into a state

1:36:47.540 --> 1:36:50.840
 for which no other tool will suffice or replace.

1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:53.360
 But in that context, I want to remind you

1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:55.200
 of the larger context of pharmacology,

1:36:55.200 --> 1:36:58.640
 which is the vast landscape of prescription pharmacology

1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:01.880
 for ADHD, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:05.360
 Now, I covered that landscape in intense detail

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:08.400
 on the episode on ADHD and focus.

1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:12.720
 And just to summarize, there is, of course, Adderall,

1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:16.000
 Ritalin, Vyvanse, Modafinil, R-modafinil,

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.680
 a number of different compounds,

1:37:17.680 --> 1:37:21.120
 all of which generally increase dopamine transmission

1:37:21.120 --> 1:37:22.720
 in the brain, so increasing dopamine,

1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:25.280
 and all of which generally increase epinephrine,

1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:27.940
 adrenaline transmission in the brain and body.

1:37:27.940 --> 1:37:32.520
 And many of those compounds have been of tremendous benefit

1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:35.480
 to children and even some adults who suffer from ADHD.

1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:38.920
 So properly prescribed at the appropriate dosage,

1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:41.920
 those compounds can really help people

1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:44.760
 with clinically diagnosed ADHD.

1:37:44.760 --> 1:37:48.280
 The way they help those people is a bit surprising, however.

1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:50.800
 You might think, well, they turn on the brain chemicals

1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:53.400
 that allow those people to concentrate and focus.

1:37:53.400 --> 1:37:56.600
 That's true, but they also have the benefit

1:37:56.600 --> 1:38:00.500
 of teaching those brain circuits how to engage.

1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:02.920
 And that's one of the reasons why,

1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:05.800
 somewhat paradoxically, giving a stimulant

1:38:05.800 --> 1:38:08.580
 like Ritalin or Adderall to a kid

1:38:08.580 --> 1:38:09.960
 that legitimately needs it,

1:38:09.960 --> 1:38:12.700
 obviously you don't want to do this without the oversight

1:38:12.700 --> 1:38:15.820
 and careful evaluation of a psychiatrist,

1:38:15.820 --> 1:38:19.560
 but giving that to a kid who has severe ADHD,

1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:22.220
 you would think would make them more rambunctious,

1:38:22.220 --> 1:38:24.780
 less able to focus, and more distractible overall.

1:38:24.780 --> 1:38:28.360
 After all, Ritalin, Modafinil, R-modafinil,

1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:29.480
 all these things are stimulant.

1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:31.520
 So you take a kid who has attention deficit

1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:35.160
 hyperactivity disorder and give them these drugs

1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:37.400
 that increase transmission of dopamine and epinephrine,

1:38:37.400 --> 1:38:38.760
 and you think, wow, it's going to make them

1:38:38.760 --> 1:38:40.560
 even more distractible and hyperactive,

1:38:40.560 --> 1:38:42.200
 and indeed it has the opposite effect.

1:38:42.200 --> 1:38:44.440
 It doesn't necessarily make them feel calm,

1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:47.460
 but it makes them feel that they can focus.

1:38:47.460 --> 1:38:49.440
 They really can anchor their attention.

1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:52.660
 And the idea is that it's teaching those neural circuits,

1:38:52.660 --> 1:38:55.320
 or those neural circuits, rather, are teaching themselves

1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:57.700
 to engage and to focus and concentrate.

1:38:57.700 --> 1:38:59.580
 And the ideal situation is one in which

1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:02.480
 the total dosage of those compounds, those drugs,

1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:04.700
 can be reduced over time as those circuits

1:39:04.700 --> 1:39:07.220
 learn to come online through purely behavioral tools.

1:39:07.220 --> 1:39:09.680
 Now, oftentimes there's a maintenance of those drugs

1:39:09.680 --> 1:39:10.900
 over long periods of time,

1:39:10.900 --> 1:39:12.720
 although there is a common practice nowadays

1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:15.360
 of trying to diminish the dosage overall.

1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:18.040
 That's in the context of ADHD and prescription medication,

1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:22.520
 and I acknowledge that a lot, indeed 80% or more,

1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:25.960
 of college students, say the statistics,

1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:28.440
 are using prescription drugs

1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:30.260
 when they are not, in fact,

1:39:30.260 --> 1:39:32.040
 prescribed those prescription drugs.

1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:34.400
 So basically what I'm saying is there are a lot of people

1:39:34.400 --> 1:39:37.300
 using drugs designed for ADHD and narcolepsy

1:39:37.300 --> 1:39:40.760
 because those drugs will effectively increase

1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:41.940
 focus and concentration,

1:39:41.940 --> 1:39:45.060
 but I strongly discourage the use

1:39:45.060 --> 1:39:47.000
 of powerful prescription drugs

1:39:47.000 --> 1:39:48.240
 that have not been prescribed to you.

1:39:48.240 --> 1:39:49.080
 First of all, it's illegal.

1:39:49.080 --> 1:39:52.440
 Second of all, it's quite dangerous to hit the accelerator

1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:55.240
 of those neural circuits with such vigor

1:39:55.240 --> 1:39:57.240
 because it can increase dependency

1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:58.860
 and they can have a number of other side effects

1:39:58.860 --> 1:40:01.040
 outside the context of clinically diagnosed

1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:04.800
 and prescribed ADHD medication.

1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:07.360
 But in the context of supplementation,

1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:12.360
 the increase in dopamine, acetylcholine, and epinephrine

1:40:12.440 --> 1:40:14.080
 that one can achieve from, say,

1:40:14.080 --> 1:40:15.640
 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,

1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:20.200
 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC, and a cup of coffee

1:40:20.200 --> 1:40:22.360
 is going to be substantially less

1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:24.040
 than one would see for prescription drugs.

1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:26.500
 So you're getting a modest effect

1:40:26.500 --> 1:40:29.880
 that can similarly teach those brain circuits

1:40:29.880 --> 1:40:33.000
 for focus and concentration, how to engage better.

1:40:33.000 --> 1:40:35.800
 But as a general backdrop to all of this,

1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:38.400
 I always say, and I'll say it again and again,

1:40:38.400 --> 1:40:39.920
 probably until the day I die,

1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:41.320
 which hopefully is a long time from now,

1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:43.920
 but regardless, it'll be the same message.

1:40:43.920 --> 1:40:47.400
 I always believe that behavioral tools should come first.

1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:48.640
 Behavioral tools should come first.

1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:50.240
 Then focus on nutrition.

1:40:50.240 --> 1:40:52.500
 In fact, I would say behavioral and nutrition tools,

1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:55.140
 and of course, get excellent sleep.

1:40:55.140 --> 1:40:57.560
 Then focus on supplementation.

1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:01.840
 And then, and only if those are failing

1:41:01.840 --> 1:41:04.580
 to bring your brain and body to the state you need to be in

1:41:04.580 --> 1:41:08.000
 to perform well in school and work and life, et cetera,

1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.240
 do I recommend that people lean on prescription drugs?

1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:13.280
 Now, there's a caveat to that,

1:41:13.280 --> 1:41:17.240
 which is under conditions like severe eating disorders,

1:41:17.240 --> 1:41:21.400
 obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, depression,

1:41:21.400 --> 1:41:25.520
 where people are truly at risk of suicide

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:27.480
 or severe mental health effects

1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:29.140
 or behavioral health effects,

1:41:29.140 --> 1:41:31.920
 and they're really, their lives are at risk

1:41:31.920 --> 1:41:34.400
 and their overall mood and wellbeing is at risk,

1:41:34.400 --> 1:41:37.040
 it's often the case that people cannot access

1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:40.040
 the brain states required to shift themselves

1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:42.200
 purely with behavioral tools, nutrition, et cetera.

1:41:42.200 --> 1:41:45.840
 So again, for the typical person who's not suffering

1:41:45.840 --> 1:41:48.320
 from one of the psychiatric disorders that I mentioned

1:41:48.320 --> 1:41:50.680
 before or other psychiatric disorders,

1:41:50.680 --> 1:41:51.980
 schizophrenia, et cetera,

1:41:53.260 --> 1:41:56.760
 I strongly encourage you to look to behavioral tools first,

1:41:56.760 --> 1:41:59.600
 nutrition, then supplementation,

1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:02.920
 then and only if there's a remaining need

1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:04.800
 to prescription drugs.

1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:07.400
 This contrasts very much with the typical scenario

1:42:07.400 --> 1:42:09.860
 I hear about these days where college students

1:42:09.860 --> 1:42:10.800
 or other people will say,

1:42:10.800 --> 1:42:13.400
 oh yeah, I hear that there's this drug, you know,

1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:15.760
 Ritalin or Vyvanse that can immediately put me

1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:17.860
 into a state of heightened focus and concentration.

1:42:17.860 --> 1:42:21.000
 Now, listen, if you have ADHD, by all means,

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:23.440
 talk to a physician, talk to a great psychiatrist

1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:25.280
 and figure out whether or not that's right for you.

1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:27.640
 But if you don't, again, behavioral tools,

1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:31.880
 nutrition, supplementation, and in particular,

1:42:31.880 --> 1:42:33.840
 those behavioral tools are going to be the ones

1:42:33.840 --> 1:42:36.660
 that are going to allow you to teach your neural circuits

1:42:36.660 --> 1:42:38.120
 how to focus and concentrate better.

1:42:38.120 --> 1:42:40.240
 And I cannot overstate the importance of that,

1:42:40.240 --> 1:42:42.160
 that the behavioral tools and to some extent,

1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:45.360
 the supplementation combined with behavioral tools

1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:48.620
 really allow you to train up your neural circuits

1:42:48.620 --> 1:42:51.160
 so that you can focus and concentrate

1:42:51.160 --> 1:42:53.520
 to the depth and the degree and the duration

1:42:53.520 --> 1:42:56.440
 that's going to best serve your mental and physical goals.

1:42:56.440 --> 1:42:58.280
 Now there's one other compound that I've used

1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:00.940
 from time to time and that I continue to use

1:43:00.940 --> 1:43:03.880
 in order to increase focus and concentration.

1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:06.120
 And I will use this in combination

1:43:06.120 --> 1:43:08.000
 with the other supplements that I talked about before

1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:09.760
 and that's phenylethylamine.

1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:12.800
 Phenylethylamine is in the dopamine synthesis pathway,

1:43:12.800 --> 1:43:14.720
 so it increases dopamine transmission

1:43:14.720 --> 1:43:16.560
 and tends to function a little bit differently

1:43:16.560 --> 1:43:17.780
 than L-tyrosine.

1:43:17.780 --> 1:43:20.840
 So every once in a while, I'll swap out L-tyrosine

1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:23.860
 and put in 500 milligrams of phenylethylamine,

1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:27.200
 or sometimes if I really want to push a little bit harder

1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:28.880
 on the dopamine system,

1:43:28.880 --> 1:43:32.180
 and I'm going to be doing a long bout of intense work,

1:43:32.180 --> 1:43:35.040
 I will take the 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC,

1:43:35.040 --> 1:43:37.360
 the 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,

1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:39.840
 I'll generally take that with some caffeine.

1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:40.760
 And I should mention,

1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:43.560
 I don't go past about 100 or 200 milligrams of caffeine

1:43:43.560 --> 1:43:45.360
 because I don't really like feeling too jittery.

1:43:45.360 --> 1:43:46.360
 That's not really my goal.

1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:48.380
 It's the goal to be alert,

1:43:48.380 --> 1:43:51.360
 but not so alert that I really can't focus on anything.

1:43:51.360 --> 1:43:54.520
 I'm not interested in having an anxiety attack after all.

1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:56.820
 But I'll sometimes either swap in

1:43:56.820 --> 1:44:00.120
 or I will add that 500 milligrams of phenylethylamine.

1:44:00.120 --> 1:44:03.400
 Phenylethylamine is in the PEA pathway.

1:44:03.400 --> 1:44:05.180
 I've talked about this in a previous podcast

1:44:05.180 --> 1:44:07.840
 on dopamine motivation and drive.

1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:10.560
 And it's a very short-lived compound,

1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:12.920
 so what I'll tend to do is take it once

1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:14.000
 at the beginning of the workout

1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:15.960
 and sometimes in the middle of the workout,

1:44:15.960 --> 1:44:18.160
 I'll take another 500 milligram capsule.

1:44:18.160 --> 1:44:19.200
 But what I just described

1:44:19.200 --> 1:44:21.240
 with combining all of those compounds,

1:44:21.240 --> 1:44:24.880
 Alpha-GPC, L-tyrosine, phenylethylamine, and caffeine,

1:44:25.760 --> 1:44:28.320
 that's a fairly rare occurrence that I'll combine all four

1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:29.640
 and really only under conditions

1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:32.960
 in which I have to do an intensely challenging bout

1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:34.860
 of mental or physical work.

1:44:34.860 --> 1:44:36.640
 I would say the frequency at which I combine

1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:38.240
 all four of those things

1:44:38.240 --> 1:44:40.880
 is probably about once every two weeks

1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:43.160
 and typically more like once a month.

1:44:43.160 --> 1:44:45.260
 Again, being careful to do that

1:44:45.260 --> 1:44:46.320
 in the early part of the day,

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:48.440
 certainly before the noon hour

1:44:48.440 --> 1:44:51.000
 so that I am in no way going to disrupt my sleep.

1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:53.160
 I realize that many of you are probably wondering about

1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:56.000
 or hoping that I'll discuss things like lion's mane

1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:59.540
 or the racetams or some of the other compounds

1:44:59.540 --> 1:45:01.480
 that are known to powerfully modulate

1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:05.240
 the dopamine epinephrine and acetylcholine systems.

1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:06.120
 To be quite direct,

1:45:06.120 --> 1:45:08.040
 there are far too many of these compounds

1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:09.680
 to review in a single episode,

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:13.560
 and they all generally tap into the same set of processes.

1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:16.520
 Again, epinephrine, that shaft of the arrowhead

1:45:16.520 --> 1:45:18.360
 that we're thinking of as focus,

1:45:18.360 --> 1:45:20.520
 acetylcholine, which is the arrowhead itself,

1:45:20.520 --> 1:45:21.980
 and then dopamine,

1:45:21.980 --> 1:45:24.640
 which is the sort of propeller behind the arrow

1:45:24.640 --> 1:45:26.900
 that allows it to continually drive forward

1:45:26.900 --> 1:45:29.540
 through a bout of mental or physical work.

1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:31.720
 There is a wonderful site,

1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:34.260
 I've mentioned it several times before on this podcast,

1:45:34.260 --> 1:45:36.540
 that is examine.com.

1:45:36.540 --> 1:45:39.120
 That wonderful site that is examine.com

1:45:39.120 --> 1:45:40.560
 has recently been updated.

1:45:40.560 --> 1:45:42.460
 They've changed their format.

1:45:42.460 --> 1:45:43.920
 It was terrific before.

1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:46.700
 It provided links to relevant studies.

1:45:46.700 --> 1:45:48.220
 It talked about specific compounds.

1:45:48.220 --> 1:45:49.800
 It talked about the magnitude of effect.

1:45:49.800 --> 1:45:51.320
 It talked about the human effect matrix.

1:45:51.320 --> 1:45:52.680
 It really focused on human studies

1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:55.380
 with links to those studies and on and on.

1:45:55.380 --> 1:45:59.000
 The new revamped version of examine.com is even better.

1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:00.640
 It's really next, next level.

1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:03.460
 I really applaud them for doing such a terrific job

1:46:03.460 --> 1:46:04.720
 in organizing the information.

1:46:04.720 --> 1:46:06.920
 There are a lot of interesting pages

1:46:06.920 --> 1:46:08.780
 that you can read there about different compounds.

1:46:08.780 --> 1:46:10.040
 So you can put in any compound,

1:46:10.040 --> 1:46:14.120
 ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine, alpha-GPC,

1:46:14.120 --> 1:46:16.160
 and you're going to get a rich array of information

1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:17.360
 about those compounds.

1:46:17.360 --> 1:46:19.900
 And if you were to put in a specific goal state,

1:46:19.900 --> 1:46:23.760
 that is focus or concentration or sleep

1:46:23.760 --> 1:46:26.180
 or hormones like testosterone, et cetera,

1:46:26.180 --> 1:46:30.920
 you're going to get a rich array of compounds, supplements,

1:46:30.920 --> 1:46:33.000
 as well as links to the studies on those compounds

1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:34.960
 and some details about those particular studies.

1:46:34.960 --> 1:46:36.720
 It's an absolutely phenomenal site.

1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:39.280
 It's one that I rely on and that I know thousands,

1:46:39.280 --> 1:46:41.420
 if not millions of other people rely on,

1:46:41.420 --> 1:46:42.780
 and I encourage you to check it out.

1:46:42.780 --> 1:46:46.000
 Again, the URL is examine.com.

1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:48.560
 So today we've talked about a number of different tools

1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:50.240
 and to some extent, some mechanisms

1:46:50.240 --> 1:46:52.720
 involved in concentration and focus.

1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:54.720
 And really the goal has been to provide you

1:46:54.720 --> 1:46:56.740
 an understanding of the neurochemical systems

1:46:56.740 --> 1:46:58.560
 and a little bit about the neural circuits

1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:03.040
 that can allow you to achieve states of attention and focus.

1:47:03.040 --> 1:47:04.480
 In contrast to previous episodes

1:47:04.480 --> 1:47:05.640
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:08.740
 where I've covered these topics in tremendous depth

1:47:08.740 --> 1:47:11.880
 as it relates to mechanism and also focused on tools today,

1:47:11.880 --> 1:47:14.640
 I largely focused on tools.

1:47:14.640 --> 1:47:16.760
 We talked about behavioral tools,

1:47:16.760 --> 1:47:20.400
 like a meditation that's 13 minutes long,

1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:23.140
 done daily specifically to improve your ability to focus.

1:47:23.140 --> 1:47:25.680
 And in fact, there are data to support that it will.

1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:26.740
 Talked about hypnosis.

1:47:26.740 --> 1:47:29.680
 We talked about visual focus, overt and covert.

1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:31.380
 We talked about various supplements,

1:47:31.380 --> 1:47:35.080
 such as Alpha-GPC, phenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,

1:47:35.080 --> 1:47:37.640
 supplements that I use to directly modulate

1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:40.200
 the neural circuits for concentration and focus.

1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:42.480
 We also talked about creatine, the Omega-3s.

1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:43.800
 Talked about the importance of sleep,

1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:46.900
 which modulates our ability to function mentally

1:47:46.900 --> 1:47:48.320
 and physically overall.

1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:50.520
 So optimize that sleep.

1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:52.940
 And we talked about a number of other protocols

1:47:52.940 --> 1:47:54.160
 that you can incorporate.

1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:55.860
 My hope in giving you all this information

1:47:55.860 --> 1:47:59.120
 in one single location is that you will be able to pick

1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:01.340
 and choose which of these protocols

1:48:01.340 --> 1:48:03.920
 you would like to incorporate into your attempts

1:48:03.920 --> 1:48:05.960
 to improve your focus and concentration.

1:48:05.960 --> 1:48:09.480
 Again, I don't recommend doing all of these protocols

1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:10.640
 all at once.

1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:12.640
 What I recommend is picking a handful of them,

1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:14.920
 maybe one or two, maybe three or four,

1:48:14.920 --> 1:48:17.240
 and trying them in different combinations

1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:19.260
 at different times of day and for different purposes,

1:48:19.260 --> 1:48:21.080
 for mental work, for physical work, et cetera,

1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:22.840
 and find what is best for you.

1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:25.920
 Once again, the goal is to teach your brain,

1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:30.200
 that is to increase neuroplasticity in the neural circuits

1:48:30.200 --> 1:48:31.840
 that allow you not just to focus,

1:48:31.840 --> 1:48:33.880
 but to refocus your attention.

1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:36.440
 And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

1:48:36.440 --> 1:48:39.320
 that it's also critical to be able to defocus.

1:48:39.320 --> 1:48:43.000
 I highly encourage people to take a period of time each day

1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:44.840
 to daydream, to walk down the hall

1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:46.620
 without looking at your phone,

1:48:46.620 --> 1:48:49.940
 to not have to incorporate more sensory information,

1:48:49.940 --> 1:48:52.720
 to not place increasing demands on yourself to focus,

1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:55.760
 and see and realize how having a period

1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:58.760
 of deliberate decompression and defocusing

1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:01.320
 can allow your brain to focus so much better

1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:04.740
 when you do decide to return to about a focused,

1:49:04.740 --> 1:49:07.200
 concentrated work or physical work.

1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:09.600
 So I want to thank you for joining me for this discussion

1:49:09.600 --> 1:49:12.800
 about tools for focus and concentration.

1:49:12.800 --> 1:49:15.120

 That's the best way to support this podcast.

1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:50.440
 During today's episode and on many previous episodes

1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:53.180
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.

1:49:53.180 --> 1:49:55.300
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:49:55.300 --> 1:49:57.460
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

1:49:57.460 --> 1:49:59.560
 for things like sleep and enhancing focus

1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:01.760
 and hormone augmentation and so forth.

1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:03.700
 As mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,

1:50:03.700 --> 1:50:05.400
 the Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered

1:50:05.400 --> 1:50:06.540
 with Momentous Supplements

1:50:06.540 --> 1:50:08.940
 because they are of the very highest quality,

1:50:08.940 --> 1:50:10.160
 they ship internationally,

1:50:10.160 --> 1:50:13.200
 and they have single ingredient formulations in dosages

1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:15.840
 that will allow you to construct the best,

1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:17.640
 most biologically and cost-effective

1:50:17.640 --> 1:50:19.940
 supplementation protocol for your needs.

1:50:19.940 --> 1:50:21.480
 If you're interested in the supplements

1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:23.460
 covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:50:23.460 --> 1:50:26.200
 you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,

1:50:26.200 --> 1:50:29.000
 so livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.160
 If you're not already following us on social media,

1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:32.600
 we are Huberman Lab on Twitter

1:50:32.600 --> 1:50:34.720
 and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram.

1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:37.760
 Both places I talk about science and science-related tools,

1:50:37.760 --> 1:50:40.760
 some of which overlap with the contents and topics

1:50:40.760 --> 1:50:42.240
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:44.240
 much of which is unique from the content

1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:45.600
 and it's certainly the format covered

1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:46.720
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:48.520
 Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram

1:50:48.520 --> 1:50:50.200
 and Huberman Lab on Twitter.

1:50:50.200 --> 1:50:52.480
 The Huberman Lab Podcast has a newsletter

1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:55.560
 in which we provide summaries and essential protocols

1:50:55.560 --> 1:50:57.840
 from the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.

1:50:57.840 --> 1:50:59.800
 You can access it totally free of charge

1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:01.680
 by going to HubermanLab.com,

1:51:01.680 --> 1:51:04.940
 go to the menu and click on newsletter, provide your email.

1:51:04.940 --> 1:51:06.900
 We do not share your email with anybody

1:51:06.900 --> 1:51:08.640
 and you'll receive our monthly newsletter.

1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:10.960
 There are also examples of previous newsletters there

1:51:10.960 --> 1:51:12.920
 that you can download as PDFs right away

1:51:12.920 --> 1:51:14.500
 without even having to sign up.

1:51:14.500 --> 1:51:15.960
 So thank you once again for joining me

1:51:15.960 --> 1:51:18.220
 for today's discussion all about the mechanisms

1:51:18.220 --> 1:51:19.600
 and especially the tools

1:51:19.600 --> 1:51:22.200
 for enhancing concentration and focus.

1:51:22.200 --> 1:51:24.380
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:51:24.380 --> 1:51:26.280
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:51:26.280 --> 1:51:28.280
 We'll see you next time.
