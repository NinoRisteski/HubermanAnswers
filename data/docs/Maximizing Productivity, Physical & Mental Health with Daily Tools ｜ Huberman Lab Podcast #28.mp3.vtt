00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.340 --> 00:12.060
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.060 --> 00:15.320
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.320 --> 00:18.460
 Today, we are going to talk about science-based protocols

00:18.460 --> 00:23.460
 for sleep, mood, learning, nutrition,

00:23.460 --> 00:26.620
 exercise of various kinds, strength and endurance,

00:26.620 --> 00:28.020
 and hypertrophy.

00:28.020 --> 00:30.080
 And we are going to talk about some protocols

00:30.080 --> 00:32.300
 that relate to creativity.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.260
 We're going to talk about behavioral protocols,

00:34.260 --> 00:36.020
 supplement-based protocols,

00:36.020 --> 00:39.420
 all science backed by quality peer review literature.

00:39.420 --> 00:41.140
 The reason that we're holding this episode now

00:41.140 --> 00:43.360
 is that in the recent previous episodes,

00:43.360 --> 00:46.380
 we've covered some pretty intense and in-depth topics.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.860
 We've talked about vision and how we see

00:48.860 --> 00:51.420
 and how to get better at seeing and how to maintain vision.

00:51.420 --> 00:53.660
 We've talked about hearing and balance.

00:53.660 --> 00:55.700
 We've talked about chemical sensing,

00:55.700 --> 00:56.860
 and we had a guest episode

00:56.860 --> 00:58.340
 that covered a lot of information

00:58.340 --> 01:01.100
 about new and emerging technologies in neuroscience

01:01.100 --> 01:02.620
 as well as mental health.

01:02.620 --> 01:06.220
 That was the interview episode with Dr. Karl Deisseroth.

01:06.220 --> 01:09.260
 So given that we've covered so much detailed information

01:09.260 --> 01:13.340
 in the previous 27 episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

01:13.340 --> 01:16.200
 I decided that we would hold office hours.

01:16.200 --> 01:18.020
 Office hours in the university setting

01:18.020 --> 01:20.840
 are when students come to the professor's office

01:20.840 --> 01:24.460
 or you meet outdoors on campus or in the classroom

01:24.460 --> 01:27.500
 to review the material and questions from lecture

01:27.500 --> 01:29.380
 in more detail.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.320
 Now, unfortunately, we don't have the opportunity

01:31.320 --> 01:34.220
 to meet face-to-face in real life,

01:34.220 --> 01:37.280
 but nonetheless, you've been sending your questions,

01:37.280 --> 01:40.860
 putting them in the comments section on YouTube, et cetera,

01:40.860 --> 01:43.220
 and I've prepared a number of answers to the questions

01:43.220 --> 01:45.580
 that have shown up most frequently.

01:45.580 --> 01:48.980
 Now, in order to provide context and structure

01:48.980 --> 01:52.260
 to the way that we will address these questions,

01:52.260 --> 01:56.020
 I've arranged the science and science-based protocols

01:56.020 --> 01:58.660
 that relate to various aspects of life,

01:58.660 --> 02:02.140
 such as mood, exercise, sleep, waking, anxiety,

02:02.140 --> 02:06.600
 creativity, et cetera, into the context of a day.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.820
 Selecting the unit of a day

02:08.820 --> 02:12.220
 in order to deliver this science information and protocols

02:12.220 --> 02:15.460
 is not a haphazard decision on my part.

02:15.460 --> 02:17.580
 It's actually the case that every cell in our body,

02:17.580 --> 02:21.140
 every organ in our body and our brain is modulated

02:21.140 --> 02:23.680
 or changes across the 24-hour day

02:23.680 --> 02:27.020
 in a very regular and predictable rhythm,

02:27.020 --> 02:29.320
 and it's no coincidence that the earth spins once

02:29.320 --> 02:31.620
 on its axis every 24 hours.

02:32.500 --> 02:35.460
 These two things are coordinated by virtue of genes

02:35.460 --> 02:37.660
 and different proteins and things that are expressed

02:37.660 --> 02:39.700
 in every cell of your body,

02:39.700 --> 02:41.700
 and so selecting the unit of the day

02:41.700 --> 02:43.160
 is not just a practical one,

02:43.160 --> 02:46.340
 but it's one that's related to our deeper biology.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.940
 You may have heard in my interview episode

02:49.940 --> 02:53.660
 with Dr. Karl Deisseroth that he himself,

02:53.660 --> 02:57.180
 in order to juggle a tremendous workload,

02:57.180 --> 03:00.380
 a full-time clinical practice, a lab of 40-plus people,

03:00.380 --> 03:02.400
 a family of five children, et cetera,

03:03.580 --> 03:06.460
 breaks up his life into units of days,

03:06.460 --> 03:10.020
 and so today we are going to further dissect the day

03:10.020 --> 03:14.340
 as a unit that one can manage and manage extremely well

03:14.340 --> 03:16.340
 and, in fact, can optimize.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.220
 So we're basically going to talk about

03:18.220 --> 03:21.140
 how to leverage science-based protocols,

03:21.140 --> 03:23.340
 and when I say science, I mean quality,

03:23.340 --> 03:26.540
 peer-reviewed science published in excellent journals.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.500
 We're going to talk about how to take that science,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.740
 convert it into specific protocols

03:30.740 --> 03:33.540
 that break up along the course of a single day

03:33.540 --> 03:36.140
 and direct certain types of behaviors

03:36.140 --> 03:39.300
 in order to optimize the various features of life.

03:39.300 --> 03:42.700
 I will couch this in the context of what I do

03:42.700 --> 03:44.920
 across a daily 24-hour rhythm.

03:44.920 --> 03:47.260
 That doesn't mean that you have to follow this schedule

03:47.260 --> 03:49.260
 at all or even in part.

03:49.260 --> 03:50.660
 It's just by way of example.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.600
 Any number of the different things that I describe

03:52.600 --> 03:53.940
 could be applied to any number

03:53.940 --> 03:56.300
 of different schedules or frameworks,

03:56.300 --> 03:58.860
 but if there's one truth that applies to all of us

03:58.860 --> 04:01.540
 is that we all have to exist within the context

04:01.540 --> 04:04.180
 of this 24-hour rhythm that we all possess,

04:04.180 --> 04:06.120
 so that's what we'll focus on.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.900
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

04:07.900 --> 04:09.140
 that this podcast is separate

04:09.140 --> 04:11.500
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.780
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:13.780 --> 04:16.580
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:16.580 --> 04:19.540
 and science-related tools to the general public.

04:19.540 --> 04:20.660
 In keeping with that theme,

04:20.660 --> 04:23.520
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.540
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

04:25.540 --> 04:28.020
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

04:28.020 --> 04:31.340
 that I believe are the very highest quality possible.

04:31.340 --> 04:33.780
 Developed by two All-American swimmers from Stanford,

04:33.780 --> 04:36.420
 Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses were developed

04:36.420 --> 04:39.000
 with their intention to create sunglasses and eyeglasses

04:39.000 --> 04:40.160
 that could be worn anywhere,

04:40.160 --> 04:43.100
 so while exercising or while working, at home,

04:43.100 --> 04:44.320
 while driving.

04:44.320 --> 04:46.700
 The reason I like Roca glasses so much

04:46.700 --> 04:49.120
 is that, first of all, they're extremely lightweight.

04:49.120 --> 04:51.900
 The optical clarity of the lenses is excellent,

04:51.900 --> 04:55.380
 and so I often just forget that I even have them on.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.780
 When I'm outside and I'm wearing sunglasses,

04:57.780 --> 04:59.040
 they have this really terrific feature,

04:59.040 --> 05:00.900
 which is that I can move in and out of shadows

05:00.900 --> 05:02.460
 or the cloud cover can change,

05:02.460 --> 05:04.980
 and I can see perfectly well the entire time.

05:04.980 --> 05:07.180
 You know, many eyeglasses and sunglasses that I've tried,

05:07.180 --> 05:09.860
 depending on what we call the ambient lighting conditions,

05:09.860 --> 05:11.760
 the local lighting conditions outside,

05:11.760 --> 05:13.440
 I have to take them off or put them back on.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.560
 It's really annoying for me,

05:14.560 --> 05:16.680
 but with Roca glasses, somehow,

05:16.680 --> 05:18.740
 I'm assuming because they really understand

05:18.740 --> 05:20.900
 the science of the visual system,

05:20.900 --> 05:23.420
 the eyeglasses and sunglasses work seamlessly

05:23.420 --> 05:24.820
 with whatever environment you're in,

05:24.820 --> 05:26.440
 so that's absolutely terrific.

05:26.440 --> 05:29.140
 Another thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:29.140 --> 05:31.700
 is that their aesthetic is really terrific.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.120
 I don't think I'm alone in saying

05:33.120 --> 05:36.140
 that many performance glasses, as they're called,

05:36.140 --> 05:38.000
 end up making people look like a cyborg,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.500
 but the sunglasses are of the sort

05:39.500 --> 05:41.780
 that you can wear while running or biking

05:41.780 --> 05:44.280
 or driving or out to dinner.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.440
 I don't typically wear sunglasses while out to dinner,

05:46.440 --> 05:47.280
 but you get the idea.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.900
 You can wear them anywhere, and they look very natural.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.940
 They have a huge number of different styles to select from.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.520
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

05:54.520 --> 05:57.620
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A,.com,

05:57.620 --> 06:01.440

 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.180
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:09.180 --> 06:11.580
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:11.580 --> 06:14.180
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:14.180 --> 06:15.740
 to help you better understand your body

06:15.740 --> 06:17.940
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:17.940 --> 06:20.900
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

06:20.900 --> 06:23.480
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

06:23.480 --> 06:25.700
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

06:25.700 --> 06:28.820
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

06:28.820 --> 06:31.940
 With Inside Tracker, it alleviates a specific problem

06:31.940 --> 06:33.940
 that's associated with most, if not all,

06:33.940 --> 06:36.440
 of the other blood tests and DNA tests out there,

06:36.440 --> 06:38.700
 and that problem is you get information back

06:38.700 --> 06:40.060
 about the levels of various things,

06:40.060 --> 06:42.620
 metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,

06:42.620 --> 06:44.620
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.900
 With Inside Tracker, they have this terrific dashboard

06:46.900 --> 06:49.820
 that allows you to both see your levels of hormones,

06:49.820 --> 06:51.660
 metabolic factors, and the rest,

06:51.660 --> 06:54.020
 but also it suggests specific things

06:54.020 --> 06:55.700
 that you can do with your nutrition,

06:55.700 --> 06:58.300
 your exercise, and lifestyle, and so forth

06:58.300 --> 07:00.540
 in order to bring those levels into the ranges

07:00.540 --> 07:03.460
 that are best for your immediate and long-term health.

07:03.460 --> 07:04.940
 In addition, they make the whole process

07:04.940 --> 07:08.020
 of getting your blood and DNA taken very easy.

07:08.020 --> 07:10.500
 They'll even come to your home to take the sample.

07:10.500 --> 07:12.260
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

07:12.260 --> 07:15.220
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman,

07:15.220 --> 07:16.060
 and if you do that,

07:16.060 --> 07:19.300
 you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.460
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

07:21.460 --> 07:24.180
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman

07:24.180 --> 07:27.540
 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

07:27.540 --> 07:30.540
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

07:30.540 --> 07:32.860
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

07:32.860 --> 07:35.780
 that are ideally matched to your sleep needs.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.580
 I started sleeping on a Helix mattress

07:37.580 --> 07:39.260
 about eight months ago,

07:39.260 --> 07:41.540
 and I can honestly say it's the best sleep

07:41.540 --> 07:43.820
 that I've ever had in my entire life,

07:43.820 --> 07:46.820
 and that's because the mattress was actually designed for me

07:46.820 --> 07:48.900
 and you can have a mattress designed for you.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.660
 If you go to helixsleep.com,

07:50.660 --> 07:53.580
 they have this free, very brief two-minute quiz

07:53.580 --> 07:55.140
 that asks you a number of questions,

07:55.140 --> 07:56.940
 like do you sleep on your side or your back?

07:56.940 --> 07:58.500
 Do you tend to run warm while you sleep

07:58.500 --> 08:01.880
 or do you tend to get cold in the middle of the night?

08:01.880 --> 08:03.500
 Maybe you don't know the answers to those questions,

08:03.500 --> 08:05.260
 and that's fine too.

08:05.260 --> 08:06.260
 After taking that quiz,

08:06.260 --> 08:08.880
 they will match you to a specific mattress

08:08.880 --> 08:11.180
 that's ideal for your sleep needs.

08:11.180 --> 08:14.300
 I matched to the so-called dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,

08:14.300 --> 08:16.560
 because I wanted a mattress that was not too firm,

08:16.560 --> 08:19.420
 not too soft, and as I mentioned, I absolutely love it.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.160
 If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

08:22.160 --> 08:25.240
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

08:25.240 --> 08:26.660
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

08:26.660 --> 08:28.900
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress,

08:28.900 --> 08:31.540
 and you'll get up to $200 off your mattress order

08:31.540 --> 08:32.700
 and two free pillows.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.820
 They also make these terrific pillows.

08:34.820 --> 08:36.100
 They have a 10-year warranty,

08:36.100 --> 08:37.480
 and you get to try out the mattress

08:37.480 --> 08:39.020
 for 100 nights risk-free.

08:39.020 --> 08:40.980
 If you don't like it, they'll come pick it up

08:40.980 --> 08:43.100
 and they'll take it away, but I think you'll love it.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.340
 I certainly love mine.

08:44.340 --> 08:45.300
 Again, if you're interested,

08:45.300 --> 08:48.260
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

08:48.260 --> 08:51.340
 for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

08:51.340 --> 08:52.620
 So let's talk about how to apply

08:52.620 --> 08:55.180
 quality peer-reviewed science to your day

08:55.180 --> 08:58.500
 and how to optimize everything from sleep to learning,

08:58.500 --> 09:01.600
 creativity, meal timing, et cetera.

09:02.700 --> 09:03.660
 As I mentioned earlier,

09:03.660 --> 09:06.060
 I'm going to do this in the context of my day

09:06.060 --> 09:07.880
 and what I typically do.

09:07.880 --> 09:10.180
 However, the specific protocols

09:10.180 --> 09:13.460
 for any number of different things, sleep relaxation,

09:13.460 --> 09:15.280
 meal timing, exercise, et cetera,

09:16.240 --> 09:18.540
 any one or all of those could be rearranged

09:18.540 --> 09:20.940
 to suit your specific needs.

09:20.940 --> 09:24.100
 I'm going to tell you what I do from morning until waking

09:24.100 --> 09:26.060
 and even what I do while I sleep

09:26.060 --> 09:28.260
 in order to optimize my sleep.

09:28.260 --> 09:31.500
 So let's start with getting up in the morning.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.660
 Now, for me, I tend to wake up sometime around 6 a.m.,

09:34.660 --> 09:37.200
 6.30, sometimes as late as 7 a.m.

09:37.200 --> 09:40.500
 I don't typically sleep much later than 7 a.m.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.740
 The first thing I do after I wake up

09:42.740 --> 09:45.240
 is I take the pen that's on my nightstand

09:45.240 --> 09:47.140
 and the pad of paper on my nightstand

09:47.140 --> 09:50.220
 and I write down the time in which I woke up.

09:50.220 --> 09:52.700
 Now, I do sleep with my phone in my room.

09:52.700 --> 09:54.860
 I realize this is considered a sin

09:54.860 --> 09:57.900
 and has certain hazards associated with it,

09:57.900 --> 09:59.660
 but I put my phone on airplane mode

09:59.660 --> 10:02.020
 about an hour before I go to sleep.

10:02.020 --> 10:05.380
 And then I set my alarm typically for 6.30 a.m.,

10:05.380 --> 10:07.300
 and some days the alarm wakes me up,

10:07.300 --> 10:09.740
 other days I wake up before the alarm,

10:09.740 --> 10:11.520
 and yes, some days the alarm goes off

10:11.520 --> 10:13.100
 and I hit snooze a few times,

10:13.100 --> 10:16.940
 and then usually by 7 a.m. I am up and out of bed.

10:16.940 --> 10:20.100
 The reason for writing down what time I wake up

10:20.100 --> 10:23.240
 is because I want to know that average wake-up time.

10:24.300 --> 10:25.980
 That average wake-up time

10:25.980 --> 10:28.860
 informs what's called my temperature minimum.

10:28.860 --> 10:31.900
 It tells me when my body temperature was lowest.

10:31.900 --> 10:36.900
 The temperature minimum is the time in each 24-hour cycle

10:37.940 --> 10:40.300
 that your body temperature is lowest.

10:40.300 --> 10:43.260
 I don't sleep with a thermometer in my mouth or elsewhere,

10:43.260 --> 10:45.260
 and I don't think you should either.

10:45.260 --> 10:48.660
 Instead, I know that the lowest temperature

10:48.660 --> 10:52.860
 that my body will be at across the 24-hour cycle

10:52.860 --> 10:57.060
 tends to be two hours before my typical wake-up time,

10:57.060 --> 10:58.820
 and I want to know that number.

10:58.820 --> 11:01.220
 It's called our temperature minimum.

11:01.220 --> 11:04.580
 So if you're somebody that typically wakes up at 8 a.m.,

11:04.580 --> 11:07.260
 then your temperature minimum is sometime around 6 a.m.

11:07.260 --> 11:08.660
 Remember, the temperature minimum

11:08.660 --> 11:11.700
 is a time in the 24-hour cycle.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.640
 I don't care what my actual temperature is.

11:14.640 --> 11:17.220
 I care when my lowest temperature is,

11:17.220 --> 11:19.900
 and I know that that lowest temperature

11:19.900 --> 11:24.000
 is approximately two hours before my average wake-up time.

11:25.340 --> 11:29.860
 So I highly recommend that you write down when you wake up

11:29.860 --> 11:32.940
 or track that in some way that works for you

11:32.940 --> 11:35.100
 and use that as a reference point

11:35.100 --> 11:37.460
 to determine your temperature minimum.

11:37.460 --> 11:39.780
 We will return to the temperature minimum

11:39.780 --> 11:42.200
 and how you can leverage the temperature minimum

11:42.200 --> 11:45.180
 for several things, shifting your clock,

11:45.180 --> 11:48.060
 shifting your circadian sleep schedule and wake schedule,

11:48.060 --> 11:51.120
 also for shifting your eating schedule, et cetera.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.320
 We will return to that, but even if you don't travel,

11:54.320 --> 11:56.900
 even if you don't care about things like jet lag,

11:56.900 --> 11:59.820
 even if you sleep fabulously all year round,

11:59.820 --> 12:01.540
 never have a poor night's sleep.

12:01.540 --> 12:02.960
 Knowing your temperature minimum,

12:02.960 --> 12:05.340
 that time when your temperature is at its lowest point,

12:05.340 --> 12:07.980
 is a valuable thing to know.

12:07.980 --> 12:10.000
 The second thing I do after I wake up

12:10.000 --> 12:12.520
 is to get into forward ambulation,

12:12.520 --> 12:15.600
 which is just nerd-speak for taking a walk.

12:15.600 --> 12:19.580
 I have a dog, and as many of you know, he's a bulldog,

12:19.580 --> 12:21.420
 and he doesn't really like to walk,

12:21.420 --> 12:23.080
 especially not in the morning,

12:23.080 --> 12:26.420
 but for humans and for animals,

12:26.420 --> 12:28.180
 there's a phenomenon whereby

12:28.180 --> 12:31.100
 when we generate our own forward motion,

12:31.100 --> 12:36.100
 forward ambulation, visual images pass by us on our eyes,

12:37.360 --> 12:39.400
 so-called optic flow.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.760
 And for those of you that are low vision or no vision,

12:41.760 --> 12:44.280
 the same phenomenon occurs in the auditory system.

12:44.280 --> 12:48.240
 Sounds pass by us in so-called auditory flow.

12:50.240 --> 12:54.240
 Getting into a mode of forward ambulation

12:54.240 --> 12:58.200
 and especially experiencing visual flow

12:58.200 --> 13:01.880
 has a powerful effect on the nervous system.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.920
 The effect it has is essentially to quiet

13:04.920 --> 13:07.240
 or reduce the amount of neural activity

13:07.240 --> 13:10.180
 in this brain structure called the amygdala.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.640
 Amygdala means almond,

13:11.640 --> 13:14.440
 and many of you have probably heard about the amygdala

13:14.440 --> 13:18.000
 for its role in anxiety and fear and threat detection,

13:18.000 --> 13:21.840
 and indeed, the amygdala is part of the network in the brain

13:21.840 --> 13:24.960
 that generates feelings of fear and threat and anxiety.

13:24.960 --> 13:26.240
 It does a bunch of other things too,

13:26.240 --> 13:28.360
 but that's one of its primary functions.

13:28.360 --> 13:31.500
 There are now at least half a dozen quality papers

13:31.500 --> 13:33.740
 published in quality peer review journals

13:33.740 --> 13:36.040
 that show that forward ambulation,

13:36.040 --> 13:38.240
 walking or biking or running,

13:38.240 --> 13:41.080
 and generating optic flow in particular

13:41.080 --> 13:44.200
 has this incredible property of lowering activity

13:44.200 --> 13:47.720
 in the amygdala and thereby reducing levels of anxiety.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.640
 There are two papers that I'd like to highlight

13:49.640 --> 13:52.480
 in particular that relate to this phenomenon.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.620
 The first one was published in the journal Neuron,

13:54.620 --> 13:55.580
 and the title of this paper

13:55.580 --> 13:57.760
 is Whole Brain Functional Ultrasound Imaging.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.360
 That just means they have a cool technique

13:59.360 --> 14:02.660
 to evaluate the activity of structures in the brain

14:02.660 --> 14:04.240
 across the entire brain,

14:04.240 --> 14:07.320
 reveals brain modules for visual motor integration.

14:08.660 --> 14:09.980
 What they found in this study,

14:09.980 --> 14:11.680
 and I should mention the first author is Massey.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.300
 This comes from Boton-Roska's group.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.180
 This was work done in mice,

14:16.180 --> 14:18.400
 but I will talk about other species in a moment.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.800
 What they found was essentially

14:19.800 --> 14:23.020
 that when these mice walk forward

14:23.020 --> 14:24.640
 and their eyes move from side to side,

14:24.640 --> 14:26.880
 which is a natural consequence of moving forward,

14:26.880 --> 14:30.880
 so-called optic flow is flowing past their eyes,

14:30.880 --> 14:32.800
 many brain areas are activated,

14:32.800 --> 14:34.640
 increase in their level of firing,

14:34.640 --> 14:37.760
 but the amygdala in particular reduced its levels of firing.

14:38.680 --> 14:41.200
 That's a very interesting finding, but it is in mice.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.520
 However, another paper,

14:44.520 --> 14:46.680
 Eye Movement Intervention Enhances Extinction

14:46.680 --> 14:49.060
 via Amygdala Deactivation

14:49.060 --> 14:51.820
 was published in the Journal of Neuroscience,

14:51.820 --> 14:55.260
 a strong journal, and shows that, again,

14:55.260 --> 14:57.320
 these eye movements, these lateral eye movements

14:57.320 --> 15:00.780
 from side to side reduce activity levels

15:00.780 --> 15:04.760
 in this fear slash threat slash anxiety center in the brain,

15:04.760 --> 15:05.600
 the amygdala.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.720
 Now, those are eye movements.

15:08.720 --> 15:11.680
 They didn't specifically look at forward ambulation,

15:11.680 --> 15:13.960
 and yet other papers have looked at forward ambulation,

15:13.960 --> 15:16.840
 and we know that forward ambulation, walking forward,

15:16.840 --> 15:21.480
 generates the sorts of eye movements that cause optic flow

15:21.480 --> 15:24.160
 and reductions in amygdala activation.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.920
 So for me, this process of taking a walk each morning

15:26.920 --> 15:28.580
 isn't about exercise.

15:28.580 --> 15:30.040
 It's not about burning calories.

15:30.040 --> 15:31.540
 It's not about any of that.

15:31.540 --> 15:34.440
 It's really about getting into optic flow

15:34.440 --> 15:38.120
 and reducing the levels of amygdala activation.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.920
 Now, I don't have anxiety,

15:40.920 --> 15:42.580
 at least I don't have chronic anxiety

15:42.580 --> 15:44.120
 or generalized anxiety.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.560
 I tend to have a lot of energy,

15:45.560 --> 15:47.240
 but at these points in the morning,

15:47.240 --> 15:48.580
 I'm not very energetic.

15:48.580 --> 15:51.040
 Sometimes I'm sort of shuffling more than I'm walking,

15:51.040 --> 15:53.340
 in fact, and Costello is almost always shuffling,

15:53.340 --> 15:54.960
 and I'm almost always trying to drag him

15:54.960 --> 15:56.520
 first thing in the morning,

15:56.520 --> 16:00.020
 but that walk is a particularly important protocol each day

16:00.020 --> 16:03.720
 because it really serves to push my neurology

16:03.720 --> 16:05.340
 in the direction that I'd like it to go,

16:05.340 --> 16:08.320
 which is alert but not anxious,

16:08.320 --> 16:09.840
 and it's kind of a fine line sometimes,

16:09.840 --> 16:12.320
 especially as events surface throughout the day,

16:12.320 --> 16:14.680
 emails come in, text messages come in,

16:14.680 --> 16:16.280
 get bombarded with a number of things.

16:16.280 --> 16:18.900
 I want to be alert and responsive.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.000
 I want to be able to focus,

16:20.000 --> 16:24.640
 but I don't want to feel anxious or reactive to these things.

16:24.640 --> 16:28.260
 So the forward ambulation and this optic flow

16:28.260 --> 16:32.280
 is the way that I ensure, based on quality peer review data,

16:32.280 --> 16:35.440
 that my amygdala activation is slightly suppressed.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.540
 Now, at the same time, I also want the alertness.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.160
 I want alert and focused.

16:40.160 --> 16:44.020
 I don't just want to be sleepy or super relaxed.

16:44.020 --> 16:46.620
 I want to have a high degree of focus and alertness

16:46.620 --> 16:50.120
 because I'm soon going to move into a bout of work.

16:50.120 --> 16:51.980
 I need to lean into the day.

16:51.980 --> 16:53.480
 So in order to do that,

16:54.440 --> 16:57.960
 I make sure that the walking is done outdoors.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.440
 That might be sort of a duh,

16:59.440 --> 17:01.440
 but many people get up and start moving around their house,

17:01.440 --> 17:03.360
 their apartment, and they don't go anywhere,

17:03.360 --> 17:05.640
 and just walking around inside,

17:05.640 --> 17:07.320
 it will generate some optic flow,

17:07.320 --> 17:09.080
 but nothing like the sort of optic flow

17:09.080 --> 17:11.660
 that you can generate in larger environments,

17:11.660 --> 17:13.240
 like outdoors environments.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.320
 If you can't get outdoors,

17:14.320 --> 17:16.720
 doing it indoors is perfectly fine,

17:16.720 --> 17:19.120
 but it's not going to have the same magnitude

17:19.120 --> 17:20.840
 of positive effect.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.600
 Now, in order to get the alertness,

17:22.600 --> 17:25.840
 I do it outdoors because I also want sunlight in my eyes.

17:25.840 --> 17:28.880
 I know many of you have heard me talk about this ad nauseum

17:28.880 --> 17:31.300
 on various podcasts and this podcast,

17:31.300 --> 17:35.000
 but getting sunlight in your eyes first thing

17:35.000 --> 17:37.120
 in the morning is absolutely vital

17:37.120 --> 17:38.960
 to mental and physical health.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.920
 It is perhaps the most important thing

17:40.920 --> 17:43.360
 that any and all of us can and should do

17:43.360 --> 17:46.480
 in order to promote metabolic wellbeing,

17:46.480 --> 17:49.500
 promote the positive functioning of your hormone system,

17:49.500 --> 17:52.840
 get your mental health steering in the right direction.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.120
 There are a number of reasons for this,

17:54.120 --> 17:56.780
 but before I get into those reasons,

17:56.780 --> 17:59.560
 let me just emphasize what the protocol is.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.200
 The protocol is get outdoors,

18:02.200 --> 18:04.940
 ideally with no sunglasses if you can do that safely,

18:04.940 --> 18:06.760
 even if there's cloud cover.

18:06.760 --> 18:08.960
 More photons, light information are coming through that

18:08.960 --> 18:10.280
 cloud cover than would be coming

18:10.280 --> 18:12.720
 from a very bright indoor bulb.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.540
 So getting outdoors is absolutely key.

18:14.540 --> 18:15.920
 How long should you do this?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.920
 It's going to depend on the brightness of the environment.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.520
 It's going to depend on a number of different factors.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.600
 Two minutes would be a minimum.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.560
 10 minutes would be even better.

18:24.560 --> 18:28.440
 And if you can, 30 minutes would be fantastic.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.400
 Now it's a very bright day or you live in a place

18:31.400 --> 18:33.980
 where there's bright sunlight, clear day on a snow field,

18:33.980 --> 18:36.220
 you would only need something like 60 seconds,

18:36.220 --> 18:39.360
 but most people aren't living in those sorts of conditions.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.860
 So getting outside for a 10 minute walk or a 15 minute walk

18:42.860 --> 18:45.160
 will basically ensure that you're getting

18:45.160 --> 18:47.320
 adequate stimulation of these neurons in the eye

18:47.320 --> 18:48.720
 that are called the melanopsin

18:48.720 --> 18:50.680
 intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.820
 I know that's a mouthful.

18:51.820 --> 18:54.080
 These are neurons that don't care about shapes of objects

18:54.080 --> 18:55.440
 or the motion of objects.

18:55.440 --> 18:58.120
 These are neurons that convey to the brain

18:58.120 --> 19:00.600
 that it's daytime and it's time to be alert.

19:00.600 --> 19:04.600
 And it sets in motion a huge number of biological cascades

19:04.600 --> 19:07.080
 within every cell and organ of your body,

19:07.080 --> 19:09.640
 from your liver to your gut, to your heart, to your brain.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.800
 It really sets things down the right path.

19:13.320 --> 19:17.600
 Early in the day, we experience a natural and healthy bump

19:17.600 --> 19:19.360
 in a hormone called cortisol.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.740
 Cortisol comes from the amygdala.

19:21.740 --> 19:24.160
 That cortisol, as I mentioned, is healthy and normal

19:24.160 --> 19:25.920
 and promotes wakefulness.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.760
 It actually promotes a healthy immune system.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.720
 So I know you've heard that stress and cortisol

19:30.720 --> 19:31.720
 disrupt the immune system,

19:31.720 --> 19:34.280
 but not the short little pulse of cortisol

19:34.280 --> 19:35.560
 that you get each morning.

19:35.560 --> 19:38.320
 It's very important that that pulse of cortisol

19:38.320 --> 19:40.140
 arrive early in the day.

19:41.300 --> 19:42.440
 I want to emphasize this again.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.680
 It's very important that that pulse of cortisol

19:44.680 --> 19:46.360
 arrive early in the day.

19:46.360 --> 19:48.400
 And that pulse of cortisol is going to happen

19:48.400 --> 19:51.520
 once every 24 hours, no matter what.

19:51.520 --> 19:53.440
 It's going to happen and you get to time it.

19:53.440 --> 19:54.600
 How do you time it?

19:54.600 --> 19:57.920
 Primarily by when you view bright sunlight

19:57.920 --> 20:00.280
 or bright light of another kind.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.960
 And we'll talk about that in a moment.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.300
 So you want that cortisol pushed early.

20:04.300 --> 20:07.140
 If you wake up before the sun comes out,

20:07.140 --> 20:09.080
 it's fine to turn on artificial lights,

20:09.080 --> 20:12.000
 but then you would want to get outside as soon as you can

20:12.000 --> 20:15.920
 to get this natural light stimulation of your eyes.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.680
 And it does have to be to your eyes.

20:18.680 --> 20:21.520
 Just to really drill down into the details for a moment,

20:22.400 --> 20:24.080
 you don't want to stare directly at the sun

20:24.080 --> 20:26.460
 or any light that's so bright that it feels painful.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.360
 If you feel like you have to close your eyes or blink,

20:29.360 --> 20:32.560
 please do, you don't want to damage your retinas.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.880
 The point here is to get the sunlight indirectly.

20:35.880 --> 20:38.760
 It's going to essentially be scattered everywhere

20:38.760 --> 20:40.040
 through the cloud cover,

20:40.040 --> 20:43.400
 but you know from looking at a flashlight

20:43.400 --> 20:44.620
 directly into that flashlight

20:44.620 --> 20:46.800
 versus looking at the beam that flashlight generates

20:46.800 --> 20:50.240
 on the ground, that if you're standing in the shade,

20:50.240 --> 20:52.400
 you're going to get less of that sunlight than you are

20:52.400 --> 20:54.560
 if you're out in an open field.

20:54.560 --> 20:56.380
 So this is why the time outside,

20:56.380 --> 20:57.520
 it's going to need to vary

20:57.520 --> 21:00.080
 depending on your particular environment.

21:00.080 --> 21:01.960
 But do your best to do this every day.

21:01.960 --> 21:03.200
 If you miss a day, no big deal,

21:03.200 --> 21:06.400
 but try not to miss more than one day.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.580
 Otherwise your mental and physical health

21:08.580 --> 21:10.120
 will start to suffer.

21:10.120 --> 21:13.000
 And doing this each day costs nothing, it's just time.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.920
 You can combine it with the forward ambulation with the walk

21:15.920 --> 21:17.840
 and the optic flow that I talked about before.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.840
 And that's what I do each morning

21:19.840 --> 21:22.600
 to generate a sense of alertness in my body

21:22.600 --> 21:26.920
 and brain to generate a sense of calm yet alert.

21:26.920 --> 21:30.080
 And that's also what I do with Costello, with my bulldog.

21:30.080 --> 21:30.920
 People have asked me,

21:30.920 --> 21:33.480
 do these same mechanisms apply to animals?

21:33.480 --> 21:36.240
 Well, the reality is many of these mechanisms

21:36.240 --> 21:38.200
 were actually discovered in animals

21:38.200 --> 21:40.320
 and then were tested in humans

21:40.320 --> 21:42.720
 and verified that they also exist in humans.

21:42.720 --> 21:44.720
 Not always, sometimes it was the reverse

21:44.720 --> 21:46.440
 where they were tested first in humans

21:46.440 --> 21:48.120
 and then brought to animals,

21:48.120 --> 21:51.240
 but indeed your dog, your horse,

21:52.360 --> 21:54.320
 I don't know what other animals are out there,

21:54.320 --> 21:55.520
 they need this.

21:55.520 --> 21:58.560
 Now, if you have a hamster or a nocturnal animal,

21:58.560 --> 22:00.840
 the reason why they like to run on their wheels at night

22:00.840 --> 22:02.360
 is because they're nocturnal,

22:02.360 --> 22:03.440
 they don't like being in the light.

22:03.440 --> 22:05.900
 Light actually causes them to freeze, right?

22:05.900 --> 22:09.280
 Actually, if you are into aquaria, you like fish,

22:09.280 --> 22:11.200
 they always say, don't overfeed your fish,

22:11.200 --> 22:12.440
 you'll kill the fish, that's true.

22:12.440 --> 22:14.800
 But guess what the fastest way to kill a fish is?

22:14.800 --> 22:17.020
 To keep the lights on 24 hours a day.

22:17.020 --> 22:21.280
 They also need circadian rhythms, these 24 hour rhythms.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.700
 So we'll do an entire month at some point about pet health,

22:24.700 --> 22:27.740
 but meanwhile, get that morning sunlight.

22:27.740 --> 22:29.500
 So now we have our first protocol,

22:29.500 --> 22:31.400
 which is to write down the time of day that you wake up.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.080
 The second protocol is to take a walk

22:34.080 --> 22:35.240
 first thing in the morning.

22:35.240 --> 22:38.400
 And the third protocol is woven in with that walk,

22:38.400 --> 22:43.320
 at least for me, which is to get that sunlight exposure.

22:43.320 --> 22:44.920
 Now, if you can't get sunlight exposure,

22:44.920 --> 22:46.800
 you absolutely can't.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.260
 I don't necessarily recommend

22:48.260 --> 22:50.860
 buying one of these dawn alarm lights.

22:51.740 --> 22:53.160
 And I'm sorry to say this,

22:53.160 --> 22:55.840
 but they're just vastly overpriced

22:55.840 --> 22:56.740
 relative to what they are.

22:56.740 --> 22:58.720
 They're basically a bright LED.

22:58.720 --> 23:03.000
 I instead use, I have a pad that's a 930 lux light pad.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.140
 I think it was designed for drawing.

23:05.140 --> 23:07.680
 Those are available at a fraction of the cost

23:07.680 --> 23:11.360
 that a morning light simulator would provide.

23:11.360 --> 23:14.540
 And yet it's really bright enough, at least for me.

23:14.540 --> 23:17.620
 I tend to put it on my desk while I work each morning.

23:17.620 --> 23:20.920
 So here's a principle that you can leverage.

23:20.920 --> 23:23.540
 If you want to be alert, view bright lights

23:23.540 --> 23:27.200
 and make those lights above you or in front of you.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.040
 If you want to go to sleep soon

23:29.040 --> 23:32.080
 or you don't want to be awake for whatever reason,

23:32.080 --> 23:33.980
 try and eliminate your exposure to light.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.000
 And this is, again, is not about exposure

23:36.000 --> 23:37.960
 of the skin to light.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.840
 This is about exposure of your eyes,

23:39.840 --> 23:42.200
 of your neural retinas to light.

23:42.200 --> 23:44.320
 For those of you that are concerned about blue light,

23:44.320 --> 23:46.840
 I want to emphasize that blue light

23:46.840 --> 23:48.620
 is precisely the wavelength of light

23:48.620 --> 23:50.760
 that is optimal for stimulating these neurons

23:50.760 --> 23:53.960
 in your eye, which set your circadian rhythms properly.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.040
 So you don't want to shield yourself

23:56.040 --> 23:58.560
 from blue light early in the day or throughout the day

23:58.560 --> 24:00.760
 or anytime you want to be awake.

24:00.760 --> 24:01.960
 In fact, that could have a number

24:01.960 --> 24:03.900
 of detrimental consequences.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.320
 Fortunately, all those consequences

24:05.320 --> 24:07.980
 are going to be reversible after a short period of time

24:07.980 --> 24:10.240
 of making sure that you don't wear your blue blockers

24:10.240 --> 24:11.700
 during the day, please.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.900
 The time to wear blue blockers, if you do,

24:15.280 --> 24:16.640
 is at night and in the evening

24:16.640 --> 24:18.480
 when you're headed towards sleep.

24:18.480 --> 24:21.040
 My colleague, Samir Hattar, who is head

24:21.040 --> 24:22.180
 of the Chronobiology Unit

24:22.180 --> 24:24.380
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health,

24:24.380 --> 24:27.160
 has spoken about this before on my Instagram.

24:27.160 --> 24:28.720
 We held an Instagram Live and I said,

24:28.720 --> 24:30.880
 Samir, what do you think about blue blockers?

24:30.880 --> 24:33.480
 And he said, I don't think that's a good idea at all

24:33.480 --> 24:34.980
 unless it's really late at night

24:34.980 --> 24:36.560
 and you're in a bright environment

24:36.560 --> 24:38.400
 and you're trying to limit the amount of bright light

24:38.400 --> 24:39.980
 that impacts the eyes.

24:41.340 --> 24:43.680
 Eliminating specific wavelengths of light,

24:43.680 --> 24:46.500
 in Samir's opinion, and also in my opinion,

24:46.500 --> 24:49.280
 is not a natural thing for the visual system

24:49.280 --> 24:50.840
 and the brain to experience.

24:50.840 --> 24:53.960
 Some people get headaches while they work on the computer

24:53.960 --> 24:55.880
 all day or staring at screens,

24:55.880 --> 24:57.920
 and so they get blue blockers thinking

24:57.920 --> 25:00.300
 that's going to protect them from their headaches.

25:00.300 --> 25:03.540
 However, any protection that you get from headaches

25:03.540 --> 25:05.960
 from blue blockers is going to be minimal

25:05.960 --> 25:08.440
 in comparison to what's really going on there,

25:08.440 --> 25:10.300
 which is that people are viewing devices

25:10.300 --> 25:12.960
 and screens up close for too many hours

25:12.960 --> 25:14.680
 throughout the 24-hour cycle.

25:14.680 --> 25:18.880
 A better remedy would be to step away from that computer

25:18.880 --> 25:20.480
 from time to time and to make sure

25:20.480 --> 25:22.280
 that you can look far off into the distance,

25:22.280 --> 25:24.520
 ideally a distance longer than 20 feet,

25:24.520 --> 25:26.560
 like view a horizon, go out on a balcony,

25:26.560 --> 25:28.200
 things of that sort, take a walk around,

25:28.200 --> 25:29.500
 get into optic flow.

25:30.420 --> 25:32.240
 So if you're into blue blockers,

25:32.240 --> 25:33.500
 make sure you're only wearing them

25:33.500 --> 25:35.520
 in the late evening and at night.

25:35.520 --> 25:37.360
 I personally don't wear blue blockers at all.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.920
 I prefer to just control my light viewing behavior

25:39.920 --> 25:41.040
 by doing this.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.320
 I do the other form of circadian control,

25:43.320 --> 25:45.200
 which is to dim the lights.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.800
 And I do that because dimming the lights

25:47.800 --> 25:50.280
 and setting them lower in the environment

25:50.280 --> 25:52.640
 sets up the brain and body for sleep much better

25:52.640 --> 25:56.560
 than simply just wearing some blue blockers, excuse me.

25:56.560 --> 25:59.120
 And please know if you do wear blue blockers

25:59.120 --> 26:01.880
 that if the light in your environment is bright enough,

26:01.880 --> 26:04.180
 it doesn't matter if you're blocking out the blues.

26:04.180 --> 26:05.860
 These cells in the eye will respond

26:05.860 --> 26:07.880
 to other wavelengths of light.

26:07.880 --> 26:10.840
 So I have no vendetta against the blue blockers

26:10.840 --> 26:13.760
 and I fully expect the blue blockingistas to come after me

26:13.760 --> 26:15.680
 with, I guess, blue blockers.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.200
 But as you do that, please understand

26:18.200 --> 26:20.000
 that the biology points in the direction

26:20.000 --> 26:21.880
 of get a lot of bright light throughout the day,

26:21.880 --> 26:23.480
 including blue light, and at night,

26:23.480 --> 26:25.580
 just limit the total amount of overall light

26:25.580 --> 26:27.760
 that you're exposed to, including from screens.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.080
 So then Costello and I get back from our walk.

26:30.080 --> 26:31.520
 Sometimes that walk was 10 minutes,

26:31.520 --> 26:33.080
 sometimes it was 60 minutes,

26:33.080 --> 26:36.060
 depending on how slowly Costello was walking that day.

26:36.060 --> 26:37.800
 Indeed, many mornings,

26:37.800 --> 26:40.600
 I'm the guy carrying his bulldog back up the hill.

26:40.600 --> 26:43.000
 My neighbors know me so well, they know Costello so well,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.220
 that they've since stopped pulling over

26:45.220 --> 26:47.100
 and asking if the dog is okay.

26:47.100 --> 26:48.800
 Sometimes they'll ask if I'm okay.

26:49.800 --> 26:53.420
 Nonetheless, we get back, I give him his food,

26:53.420 --> 26:57.000
 I give him his water, and I give me my water.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.600
 I'm a big believer based on quality peer review data

27:01.600 --> 27:05.240
 that hydration is essential for mental performance.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.340
 Now, I confess, I don't really like drinking big glasses

27:08.340 --> 27:10.160
 or big jugs of water first thing in the morning.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.000
 I don't know why,

27:11.000 --> 27:13.160
 but my thirst doesn't tend to kick in first thing.

27:13.160 --> 27:14.200
 You may be different.

27:15.380 --> 27:19.680
 Either way, I force myself essentially to drink at least 16

27:19.680 --> 27:23.240
 and most days, 32 ounces of water.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.840
 I also put a little bit of sea salt in the water.

27:25.840 --> 27:29.600
 As many of you know, neurons require ionic flow.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.240
 What that means is neurons need sodium,

27:32.240 --> 27:33.160
 they need magnesium,

27:33.160 --> 27:35.800
 and they need potassium in order to function.

27:35.800 --> 27:38.980
 We do tend to get dehydrated at night,

27:38.980 --> 27:40.800
 even if the day is not very hot,

27:40.800 --> 27:44.000
 I try and top off or I try and make sure

27:44.000 --> 27:47.520
 that I'm hydrated early in the day before I begin any work.

27:47.520 --> 27:50.440
 So I make myself drink this water

27:50.440 --> 27:51.640
 with a little bit of sea salt.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.880
 How much sea salt, if you really want to get detailed,

27:53.880 --> 27:57.200
 I suppose it's about half a teaspoon, it's not much.

27:57.200 --> 27:58.440
 That's what I do.

27:58.440 --> 28:01.140
 And I drink that more or less room temperature.

28:01.140 --> 28:02.720
 I find that drinking really cold water

28:02.720 --> 28:05.360
 first thing in the day kind of like cramps up my insides,

28:05.360 --> 28:07.240
 so I don't do that.

28:07.240 --> 28:09.300
 At that point, I start thinking about

28:09.300 --> 28:11.840
 and fantasizing about and craving caffeine,

28:11.840 --> 28:14.320
 but I don't drink that caffeine yet.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.600
 I purposely delay my caffeine intake

28:17.600 --> 28:21.380
 to 90 minutes to 120 minutes after I wake up.

28:21.380 --> 28:23.300
 Of course, I know when I wake up because I wrote it down,

28:23.300 --> 28:26.360
 although it's pretty easy to commit to memory.

28:26.360 --> 28:30.240
 The reason I delay caffeine is because one of the factors

28:30.240 --> 28:32.580
 that induces a sense of sleepiness

28:32.580 --> 28:34.920
 is the buildup of adenosine,

28:34.920 --> 28:39.640
 or as some people call it adenosine in our system.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.780
 The buildup of adenosine accumulates

28:42.780 --> 28:44.660
 the longer we are awake.

28:44.660 --> 28:46.200
 So when I wake up in the morning,

28:46.200 --> 28:47.560
 when you wake up in the morning,

28:47.560 --> 28:51.440
 your adenosine levels are likely to be very low.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.840
 However, caffeine is an adenosine blocker.

28:55.840 --> 28:58.640
 It's actually a competitive antagonist for you aficionados.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.560
 It sort of parks in the receptor

29:00.560 --> 29:03.120
 that adenosine normally would park at

29:03.120 --> 29:06.320
 and prevents adenosine from acting on that receptor.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.580
 That's why you feel more alert

29:07.580 --> 29:10.400
 because it's essentially blocking the effect

29:10.400 --> 29:13.020
 of this sleepiness factor that we all create

29:13.020 --> 29:13.940
 called adenosine.

29:15.160 --> 29:17.000
 The reason for delaying caffeine intake

29:17.000 --> 29:19.160
 90 minutes to two hours after waking

29:19.160 --> 29:23.660
 is I want to make sure that I don't have a late afternoon

29:23.660 --> 29:26.920
 or even early afternoon crash from caffeine.

29:26.920 --> 29:30.380
 One of the best ways to ensure a caffeine crash

29:30.380 --> 29:32.360
 is to drink a bunch of caffeine,

29:32.360 --> 29:34.160
 block all those adenosine receptors,

29:34.160 --> 29:36.800
 and then by early or late afternoon,

29:36.800 --> 29:38.720
 when that caffeine starts to wear off

29:38.720 --> 29:40.760
 and gets dislodged from the receptors,

29:41.600 --> 29:43.280
 a lower level of adenosine

29:43.280 --> 29:46.980
 is able to create a greater level of sleepiness.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.560
 It took me years to figure this out.

29:48.560 --> 29:50.020
 I used to wake up and I'd think,

29:50.020 --> 29:51.960
 oh, I don't want to drink caffeine too close to bedtime,

29:51.960 --> 29:54.060
 so I'm going to start drinking my caffeine really early.

29:54.060 --> 29:57.240
 I let my cortisol naturally come up in the morning.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.040
 I avoid drinking caffeine

29:59.040 --> 30:02.800
 until about 90 minutes or two hours after waking.

30:02.800 --> 30:03.760
 And when I do that,

30:03.760 --> 30:07.720
 I find that I don't experience the afternoon crash.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.600
 At least I don't experience that crash

30:09.600 --> 30:11.020
 unless I do something foolish

30:11.020 --> 30:13.160
 like ingest far too much food at lunch

30:13.160 --> 30:15.640
 or I stay up all night the night before.

30:15.640 --> 30:17.980
 But provided I don't do anything foolish like that,

30:17.980 --> 30:20.400
 delaying caffeine at 90 minutes to two hours

30:20.400 --> 30:23.120
 optimizes this relationship between adenosine

30:23.120 --> 30:24.920
 and wakefulness and sleepiness

30:24.920 --> 30:28.680
 in a way that really provides a nice consistent arc

30:28.680 --> 30:30.160
 of energy throughout the day

30:30.160 --> 30:33.200
 and brings energy down as I'm headed toward sleep

30:33.200 --> 30:34.760
 and falling asleep.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.960
 My primary objective early in the day

30:36.960 --> 30:39.920
 is to get into a mode of being focused yet alert

30:39.920 --> 30:41.320
 so that I can get work done.

30:42.560 --> 30:45.360
 I found that the best way for me to achieve that state

30:45.360 --> 30:46.860
 is through fasting.

30:46.860 --> 30:51.480
 So I don't eat anything until about 11 a.m. or 12 noon.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.440
 I'm not absolutely religious about it.

30:53.440 --> 30:55.440
 There are days when I'll have a few Brazil nuts

30:55.440 --> 30:59.360
 or a spoonful or three of almond butter, for instance,

30:59.360 --> 31:01.400
 but most days I'm not doing that.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.300
 I'm just not eating anything.

31:03.300 --> 31:05.280
 I'm drinking some caffeine.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.560
 Caffeine source for me is yerba mate, guayusa tea.

31:08.560 --> 31:09.960
 Those are my preferred sources.

31:09.960 --> 31:11.680
 I tend to avoid coffee these days.

31:11.680 --> 31:12.680
 Occasionally I'll have a cup,

31:12.680 --> 31:15.740
 but most often I stick to the teas.

31:15.740 --> 31:19.720
 I drink water as much as I feel I need to and want to.

31:19.720 --> 31:21.560
 And I also drink my athletic greens,

31:21.560 --> 31:24.040
 which is compatible at least for me with fasting.

31:24.040 --> 31:28.240
 Let's talk about why fasting works to create

31:28.240 --> 31:31.580
 this heightened state of alertness yet calm brain state.

31:32.720 --> 31:35.760
 Fasting increases levels of adrenaline,

31:35.760 --> 31:38.200
 also called epinephrine in the brain and body.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.720
 And when our levels of epinephrine and adrenaline

31:40.720 --> 31:43.960
 are increased, we learn better, we can focus better.

31:43.960 --> 31:46.440
 There's terrific data supporting that.

31:46.440 --> 31:51.240
 You don't want epinephrine, aka adrenaline, too high.

31:51.240 --> 31:53.240
 That feels like stress and panic.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.320
 You get jittery, you can't focus.

31:55.320 --> 31:57.440
 But in its optimal range,

31:57.440 --> 32:00.840
 adrenaline really provides a heightened sense of focus

32:00.840 --> 32:02.800
 and the ability to encode,

32:02.800 --> 32:06.240
 meaning bring in and retain, remember information.

32:06.240 --> 32:08.960
 And so since my job is mainly a cerebral one

32:08.960 --> 32:11.440
 where I'm writing grants and working on papers, et cetera,

32:11.440 --> 32:13.920
 I fast in the early part of the day.

32:13.920 --> 32:17.840
 I mentioned ingesting things like guayusa or yerba mate,

32:17.840 --> 32:20.520
 or in my case, athletic greens.

32:20.520 --> 32:21.800
 Many people ask, in fact,

32:21.800 --> 32:24.600
 there's a whole community and discussion boards, et cetera,

32:24.600 --> 32:26.400
 and YouTube comments on the internet

32:26.400 --> 32:29.440
 about what breaks a fast and what doesn't.

32:29.440 --> 32:30.600
 The fact of the matter is

32:30.600 --> 32:32.400
 that's going to be highly individual

32:32.400 --> 32:34.340
 because it's going to depend

32:34.340 --> 32:37.520
 on how sensitive your blood sugar is.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.480
 And more accurately, it's going to depend

32:39.480 --> 32:41.760
 on things like your insulin sensitivity.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.440
 So for instance,

32:43.440 --> 32:45.560
 if you're somebody who gets up in the morning,

32:45.560 --> 32:48.900
 hydrates and goes out for a six mile run,

32:48.900 --> 32:52.720
 you could probably eat a jar of almond butter

32:52.720 --> 32:55.000
 and still be what's called fat fasted.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.920
 Your insulin levels will still be very low

32:56.920 --> 32:59.660
 because even though that is a large volume of almond butter,

32:59.660 --> 33:02.300
 even to me and Costello,

33:02.300 --> 33:05.360
 that large number of calories come from a source

33:05.360 --> 33:07.520
 that doesn't increase blood sugar very much

33:07.520 --> 33:09.520
 and insulin very much.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.440
 Now, I'm not suggesting you do that,

33:11.440 --> 33:14.260
 but what I just described is a vastly different situation

33:14.260 --> 33:17.080
 than somebody that ate their last meal at 2 a.m.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.580
 and that meal was essentially a feast.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.280
 And for that person,

33:22.160 --> 33:25.040
 fasting until 10 or 11 a.m.,

33:25.040 --> 33:27.800
 their blood sugar might still actually be pretty high

33:27.800 --> 33:30.680
 or even low-ish such that they might eat one almond

33:30.680 --> 33:32.680
 and it would bump them out of fasting.

33:32.680 --> 33:33.520
 So you get the idea.

33:33.520 --> 33:36.520
 It's going to depend on your recent eating history,

33:36.520 --> 33:38.080
 your blood sugar history,

33:38.080 --> 33:40.280
 your glycogen stores, et cetera.

33:40.280 --> 33:43.920
 So if anyone tells you that breaks a fast or that doesn't,

33:43.920 --> 33:44.740
 that's kind of silly.

33:44.740 --> 33:46.760
 Would one grain of sugar break your fast?

33:46.760 --> 33:47.600
 No.

33:47.600 --> 33:49.720
 Would an entire tablespoon of sugar break your fast?

33:49.720 --> 33:50.560
 Yes.

33:50.560 --> 33:53.520
 You'll get a big blip in blood sugar and insulin from that.

33:53.520 --> 33:55.160
 However, how long that lasts,

33:55.160 --> 33:57.040
 how long it breaks your fast will depend

33:57.040 --> 33:59.080
 on how glycogen depleted you are

33:59.080 --> 34:00.760
 and a number of other factors.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.200
 So for me, I just keep it fairly simple.

34:03.200 --> 34:07.120
 I ingest water, caffeine from yerba mate and guayusa,

34:07.120 --> 34:09.640
 and I drink my athletic greens with some lemon juice in it.

34:09.640 --> 34:12.960
 That constitutes my fasting.

34:12.960 --> 34:15.400
 And there are days when I do all those things.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.100
 There are days when I do none of those things.

34:17.100 --> 34:18.080
 Although most days,

34:18.080 --> 34:21.840
 I would say about 355 days out of the year,

34:21.840 --> 34:25.780
 I'm ingesting water, caffeine, and athletic greens

34:25.780 --> 34:27.720
 during this period of fasting early in the day.

34:27.720 --> 34:30.440
 And that's the period of time when I do my work.

34:30.440 --> 34:33.500
 One interesting fact about yerba mate and guayusa teas

34:33.500 --> 34:36.880
 is that they increase release of something called GLP-1.

34:36.880 --> 34:40.000
 GLP-1 is related to glucagon.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.920
 Glucagon is a hormone that you can sort of think about

34:42.920 --> 34:45.200
 as opposite to insulin and blood sugar.

34:45.200 --> 34:46.360
 It's more complex than that,

34:46.360 --> 34:50.240
 but GLP-1 has a couple of positive properties.

34:50.240 --> 34:52.200
 One is it increases lipolysis

34:52.200 --> 34:55.780
 and mobilization of body fat stores, so burning of fat.

34:55.780 --> 34:58.600
 In fact, there are now a number of clinical trials

34:58.600 --> 34:59.820
 that are achieving good success,

34:59.820 --> 35:02.900
 and there are drugs out there only available by prescription

35:02.900 --> 35:04.640
 which mimic GLP-1

35:04.640 --> 35:07.200
 and are being used to treat quite successfully

35:08.120 --> 35:10.740
 certain types of diabetes and obesity.

35:10.740 --> 35:11.680
 Now, I'm not diabetic,

35:11.680 --> 35:13.920
 nor am I trying to shed a ton of body fat,

35:13.920 --> 35:16.800
 but I figure as long as I'm fasting,

35:16.800 --> 35:19.160
 and as long as I like yerba mate and guayusa,

35:19.160 --> 35:20.760
 which I do, they're delicious,

35:20.760 --> 35:23.300
 I'll tell you which type I use in a moment,

35:23.300 --> 35:25.300
 I might as well increase my GLP-1

35:25.300 --> 35:27.400
 because it's probably not as good as getting out

35:27.400 --> 35:28.720
 and doing some cardio work,

35:28.720 --> 35:30.640
 but nonetheless, if I'm fasted,

35:30.640 --> 35:32.560
 increasing GLP-1 in my system,

35:32.560 --> 35:34.120
 I'm going to be alert from the caffeine,

35:34.120 --> 35:35.800
 the adrenaline, et cetera,

35:35.800 --> 35:38.920
 and I'm going to be burning body fat while I'm doing my work.

35:38.920 --> 35:42.320
 So for me, it's just an efficient biochemically rational,

35:42.320 --> 35:45.240
 or I should say grounded in quality biochemistry

35:45.240 --> 35:47.120
 sort of approach.

35:47.120 --> 35:49.440
 Yerba mate comes in a lot of different forms.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.120
 There are a lot of different brands out there, et cetera.

35:52.120 --> 35:54.840
 I don't have any relationship whatsoever

35:54.840 --> 35:57.360
 in a business sense to any of these brands.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.740
 Some of them are very smoky.

36:00.740 --> 36:03.760
 I, just because of something in my genetic makeup,

36:03.760 --> 36:06.080
 or I don't know, maybe it was some sort of Y chromosome

36:06.080 --> 36:08.480
 associated lesion early in life,

36:08.480 --> 36:11.040
 but I don't like smoky flavors,

36:11.040 --> 36:13.200
 so I'm not a Gouda cheese guy.

36:13.200 --> 36:14.420
 I don't like smoky stuff.

36:14.420 --> 36:19.160
 You may love it, but I tend to avoid smoky tasting mates.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.020
 Instead, there's a particular brand

36:21.020 --> 36:23.460
 that I just found on the internet called Anna Park.

36:23.460 --> 36:24.300
 I don't know Anna.

36:24.300 --> 36:25.320
 I don't know if she has a park,

36:25.320 --> 36:27.080
 and I certainly don't know what Anna Park is,

36:27.080 --> 36:29.200
 but for me, that's the best tasting Yerba mate.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.320
 Again, I don't have any relationship to them,

36:32.320 --> 36:35.920
 but it's affordable in the context of Yerba mate,

36:35.920 --> 36:37.560
 and it's the one that I use,

36:37.560 --> 36:39.700
 and I should mention along the lines of affordability

36:39.700 --> 36:43.800
 and GLP-1 is there's a nice feature of Yerba mate,

36:43.800 --> 36:47.160
 which is if you put it in a filter or a metal strainer

36:47.160 --> 36:51.360
 and you pour hot water over it and then drink it,

36:51.360 --> 36:53.200
 keep the leaves.

36:53.200 --> 36:55.280
 The Yerba mate leaves can be used over and over again.

36:55.280 --> 36:59.200
 It seems that the GLP-1 stimulating aspects of mate

36:59.200 --> 37:02.640
 actually are enhanced with subsequent pour overs,

37:02.640 --> 37:04.640
 so there's something interesting about these teas

37:04.640 --> 37:07.740
 that my tea aficionado friends tell me

37:07.740 --> 37:09.780
 allows the tea to release more of some

37:09.780 --> 37:13.640
 of the beneficial compounds by reusing the tea leaves.

37:13.640 --> 37:14.900
 Now, eventually, it'll grow mold

37:14.900 --> 37:17.040
 and other sorts of disgusting things.

37:17.040 --> 37:18.480
 You don't really want to run that experiment.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.400
 I would say you can use it for a day or two

37:21.400 --> 37:22.720
 before it starts to go bad,

37:22.720 --> 37:24.540
 but that's a feature that will extend the life

37:24.540 --> 37:27.040
 of whatever Yerba mate you happen to use

37:27.040 --> 37:29.840
 if you decide to use it, and that's certainly what I do.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.520
 Next, I want to talk about what I'm doing

37:31.520 --> 37:33.120
 while I'm drinking all this Yerba mate,

37:33.120 --> 37:34.060
 because I'm not just sitting there

37:34.060 --> 37:37.100
 thinking about all the GLP-1 circulating in my system.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.560
 I'm working.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.940
 A couple of things for optimizing workspace

37:40.940 --> 37:44.440
 that are grounded in neuroscience and physiology.

37:44.440 --> 37:46.280
 I've talked before about the fact

37:46.280 --> 37:48.920
 that when our eyes are directed upward,

37:48.920 --> 37:51.820
 literally when our eyelids are open, no surprise there,

37:51.820 --> 37:54.760
 and when our eyes are directed upward,

37:54.760 --> 37:57.720
 it creates a state of heightened alertness,

37:57.720 --> 38:00.920
 and this has a relationship to the brainstem neurons

38:00.920 --> 38:05.360
 that create alertness and their control

38:05.360 --> 38:06.720
 over the muscles of the eye

38:06.720 --> 38:08.920
 and, believe it or not, the eyelids.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.980
 Now, it's not the case that if you are absolutely exhausted

38:11.980 --> 38:13.560
 and you need to feel more alert,

38:13.560 --> 38:17.040
 that looking upward is going to make you feel wide awake,

38:17.040 --> 38:19.940
 although it will help support your levels of alertness.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.920
 The point here is that you can optimize your workstation

38:24.920 --> 38:28.600
 in a physical way that leverages this aspect

38:28.600 --> 38:30.720
 of the visual system and your level of alertness.

38:30.720 --> 38:33.360
 Since most of us want to be awake while we're working,

38:33.360 --> 38:37.520
 try and position your screen or your tablet,

38:37.520 --> 38:39.960
 whatever device you happen to be working on,

38:39.960 --> 38:44.060
 at least at eye level and ideally slightly higher.

38:44.060 --> 38:46.120
 If you think about it, most people are not doing this.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.740
 Most people are looking down at their computer or tablet

38:48.740 --> 38:51.800
 or are angling their eyes at their screen

38:51.800 --> 38:53.200
 at about 30 degrees.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.920
 That is not going to support heightened states of alertness

38:56.920 --> 38:58.480
 and optimal attention.

38:58.480 --> 39:02.360
 In fact, the opposite relationship between eye position

39:02.360 --> 39:03.560
 and alertness is also true.

39:03.560 --> 39:07.100
 When we look down, when our eyelids are slightly closed,

39:07.100 --> 39:09.160
 it tends to decrease our levels of alertness

39:09.160 --> 39:11.240
 and increase our levels of sleepiness.

39:11.240 --> 39:12.600
 I really want to emphasize this,

39:12.600 --> 39:15.680
 that there's a bi-directional or reciprocal relationship

39:15.680 --> 39:19.000
 between the brainstem areas that control alertness

39:19.000 --> 39:20.800
 and the eyes, meaning how alert you are

39:20.800 --> 39:22.920
 controls how open or close your eyes are,

39:22.920 --> 39:26.400
 no surprise there, but also that how open

39:26.400 --> 39:28.540
 and upward directed your eyes are

39:28.540 --> 39:30.780
 will increase your levels of alertness.

39:30.780 --> 39:32.320
 And if your eyes are pointed downward

39:32.320 --> 39:36.780
 and your eyelids are hooded, like they're slowly closing,

39:36.780 --> 39:40.400
 like Costello's always are, you'll feel more sleepy,

39:40.400 --> 39:42.560
 especially if you're somebody who tends to have

39:42.560 --> 39:45.760
 that mid-morning sleepiness or mid-morning crash.

39:45.760 --> 39:47.840
 So what I do is I have a standing desk,

39:47.840 --> 39:50.080
 but I also prop the computer up

39:50.080 --> 39:52.760
 such that it's at least at eye level.

39:52.760 --> 39:55.920
 And I haven't figured out yet how to develop a workstation

39:55.920 --> 39:58.180
 where the computer is above me.

39:58.180 --> 39:59.780
 I think the only way to really do that

39:59.780 --> 40:01.900
 is actually to tilt one's body back,

40:01.900 --> 40:04.320
 but actually that's not a good idea either.

40:05.380 --> 40:08.160
 They have done studies recording from areas of the brain

40:08.160 --> 40:10.720
 associated with alertness, areas like locus coeruleus

40:10.720 --> 40:12.840
 and the so-called reticular activating system.

40:12.840 --> 40:15.880
 They found is that depending on how reclined you are

40:15.880 --> 40:19.560
 or upright you are, you will decrease with reclining

40:19.560 --> 40:23.780
 and increase with sitting forward your levels of alertness.

40:23.780 --> 40:26.920
 So body posture and whether or not you're upright

40:26.920 --> 40:30.800
 or reclining will impact your levels of alertness

40:30.800 --> 40:32.820
 in the predictable ways.

40:32.820 --> 40:34.640
 And where you position your eyes,

40:34.640 --> 40:37.080
 whether or not your eyes are upright, so to speak,

40:37.080 --> 40:38.960
 looking up or directly forward,

40:38.960 --> 40:42.200
 or looking down will dictate whether or not

40:42.200 --> 40:45.980
 you are feeling more alert or more sleepy respectively.

40:45.980 --> 40:49.420
 So try and arrange a workstation or a position

40:49.420 --> 40:51.760
 of your body and your chair or your standing desk,

40:51.760 --> 40:54.040
 whatever it is, that allows you to work

40:54.040 --> 40:56.360
 with a heightened state of alertness.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.680
 This is really, really key for me

40:58.680 --> 41:00.440
 because I found that when I would sit down,

41:00.440 --> 41:03.120
 not only would my hip flexors start to get sore,

41:03.120 --> 41:05.060
 I'd feel tight in the back, et cetera,

41:05.060 --> 41:08.640
 but if I was staring down at my screen all day

41:08.640 --> 41:10.080
 or even for short periods of the day,

41:10.080 --> 41:11.440
 I would start to feel sleepy

41:11.440 --> 41:12.680
 and I couldn't figure out what was going on.

41:12.680 --> 41:14.080
 I also thought maybe I needed glasses.

41:14.080 --> 41:17.280
 I do wear readers at night, but it was really a problem.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.200
 And simply by getting the screen directly in front of me

41:20.200 --> 41:23.220
 at eye level, it's been completely transformative.

41:23.220 --> 41:26.440
 So we're now at the description of my day

41:26.440 --> 41:28.280
 and these protocols in which I would do

41:28.280 --> 41:30.940
 a 90-minute bout of work.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.140
 Now, why 90 minutes?

41:32.140 --> 41:35.020
 Well, the brain is going through these 90-minute

41:35.020 --> 41:36.500
 so-called ultradian cycles

41:36.500 --> 41:38.200
 throughout the entire day and night.

41:38.200 --> 41:42.360
 Every 90 minutes, we shift over from being very alert

41:42.360 --> 41:44.100
 to being less alert and then back to alert again.

41:44.100 --> 41:45.640
 Here's how it works.

41:45.640 --> 41:49.320
 At the start of one of these 90-minute ultradian cycles,

41:49.320 --> 41:52.300
 my brain is not quite engaged

41:52.300 --> 41:53.880
 in whatever it is I'm trying to do.

41:53.880 --> 41:56.900
 Oftentimes, I have things jumping into my mind.

41:56.900 --> 41:58.860
 I've got distractions, et cetera.

41:58.860 --> 42:00.480
 I'll talk about how to deal with those distractions

42:00.480 --> 42:05.240
 in a moment, but I set a timer for 90 minutes

42:05.240 --> 42:08.500
 and I try and get a strong bout of work done

42:08.500 --> 42:10.960
 inside of that 90 minutes with the full understanding

42:10.960 --> 42:13.800
 that the entire 90 minutes is not going to be uniform

42:13.800 --> 42:15.440
 in terms of my ability of focus.

42:15.440 --> 42:18.260
 There will be kind of peaks and valleys within that,

42:18.260 --> 42:22.040
 but that 90 minutes is about what the brain can handle

42:22.040 --> 42:26.320
 in terms of a dedicated effort for high degree of focus.

42:26.320 --> 42:28.140
 Some people can push out a little bit further.

42:28.140 --> 42:30.280
 Some people can't handle more than 10 minutes,

42:30.280 --> 42:32.840
 but that's what I'm striving toward.

42:32.840 --> 42:34.960
 You'd be amazed how much you can get done in 90 minutes

42:34.960 --> 42:35.800
 if you are focused.

42:35.800 --> 42:37.240
 So how do you increase that focus

42:37.240 --> 42:40.060
 and how do you use the timer feature?

42:40.060 --> 42:41.560
 Well, you can combine those.

42:41.560 --> 42:43.280
 I use a program called Freedom.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.080
 It shuts me out of the internet completely.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.720
 So that means no checking the markets,

42:48.720 --> 42:53.720
 no checking social media, no checking the news,

42:53.720 --> 42:56.340
 no checking email, none of that.

42:56.340 --> 42:59.060
 I get a dedicated bout of work done.

43:00.060 --> 43:02.300
 I confess, I don't allow myself to go to the restroom

43:02.300 --> 43:04.200
 in that period of time.

43:04.200 --> 43:05.460
 Here's an interesting little tip

43:05.460 --> 43:07.920
 that's grounded in physiology.

43:07.920 --> 43:11.680
 You have a direct neural connection from your bladder

43:11.680 --> 43:15.300
 to your brainstem areas that increase alertness.

43:15.300 --> 43:17.960
 This is why when you have to go to the bathroom,

43:17.960 --> 43:21.640
 when you have to urinate, it is extremely agitating, right?

43:21.640 --> 43:23.920
 It can be very, very agitating.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.980
 I'm not encouraging you to get so agitated

43:26.980 --> 43:28.680
 by filling your bladder so much

43:28.680 --> 43:30.040
 and resisting going to the bathroom

43:30.040 --> 43:32.360
 that you are uncomfortable and can't focus.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.360
 But I generally will just drink liquids

43:35.360 --> 43:36.520
 and work away and work away

43:36.520 --> 43:38.560
 and I won't walk away to go use the bathroom

43:38.560 --> 43:40.760
 unless I absolutely have to.

43:40.760 --> 43:41.960
 Sort of odd that we're talking about this,

43:41.960 --> 43:43.960
 but this is one way in which I've learned

43:43.960 --> 43:47.400
 to funnel my attention into whatever it is I'm doing.

43:47.400 --> 43:48.240
 Because as you all know,

43:48.240 --> 43:50.000
 the moment you sit down to do some serious work

43:50.000 --> 43:51.420
 and you flip off the internet,

43:51.420 --> 43:53.680
 all of a sudden it's as if the phone has a voice.

43:53.680 --> 43:54.520
 It starts calling you.

43:54.520 --> 43:56.980
 It's almost as if the restroom has a voice.

43:56.980 --> 43:58.900
 But we all are familiar with the fact

43:58.900 --> 44:00.920
 that if we are focused on something

44:00.920 --> 44:02.800
 that all that just kind of melts away.

44:02.800 --> 44:04.940
 So the goal is to get into what I call the tunnel,

44:04.940 --> 44:07.600
 to really get into a tunnel of quality work.

44:07.600 --> 44:09.620
 The brain loves that state,

44:09.620 --> 44:12.440
 but it's very hard for many of us to access.

44:12.440 --> 44:14.720
 My phone is absolutely off.

44:14.720 --> 44:15.880
 It's not on airplane mode.

44:15.880 --> 44:18.640
 It's absolutely off during this time.

44:18.640 --> 44:20.480
 If I've been struggling with that

44:20.480 --> 44:23.920
 and I confess there are times when for whatever reason,

44:23.920 --> 44:25.040
 something going on in life,

44:25.040 --> 44:27.080
 it's been harder to put away the phone.

44:27.080 --> 44:28.880
 I will sometimes put it in my car.

44:28.880 --> 44:31.300
 I used to joke that I used to throw it up on the roof

44:31.300 --> 44:32.360
 or something like that.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.240
 Look, I've done and I suggest people do whatever they need

44:35.240 --> 44:38.440
 to in order to self-regulate that activity.

44:38.440 --> 44:39.560
 And if you're somebody that feels

44:39.560 --> 44:41.600
 that you absolutely need to be on your phone

44:41.600 --> 44:43.840
 and on the computer for this work bout

44:43.840 --> 44:45.100
 or the work that you do,

44:45.100 --> 44:46.440
 well, that's a different matter altogether.

44:46.440 --> 44:48.000
 This is just simply how I work.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.160
 So I will do 90 minutes

44:50.160 --> 44:52.360
 and I do set a timer and I turn on the program.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.640
 Freedom locks me out of the internet.

44:54.640 --> 44:56.680
 If someone rings on the doorbell,

44:57.560 --> 44:59.740
 I will often shout not coming to the doorbell,

44:59.740 --> 45:00.580
 leave it there.

45:00.580 --> 45:02.720
 I mean, unless there's a real emergency,

45:02.720 --> 45:04.800
 I'm not going to step away from that work.

45:04.800 --> 45:07.280
 I learned how to do this when I was a graduate student

45:07.280 --> 45:09.600
 under different conditions where I used to slice brains

45:09.600 --> 45:11.040
 on what's called a microtome.

45:11.040 --> 45:14.400
 So I used to spend time just cutting very thin slices.

45:14.400 --> 45:15.440
 It's like a deli slicer,

45:15.440 --> 45:19.200
 but for a brain of various types of brains

45:19.200 --> 45:20.960
 and I've sectioned through a lot of brains.

45:20.960 --> 45:22.040
 And we had a rule,

45:22.040 --> 45:26.440
 which is that when the blade hits the brain,

45:26.440 --> 45:29.880
 you don't stop pulling, even though it's very, very slow,

45:29.880 --> 45:32.400
 even if a nuclear bomb goes off,

45:32.400 --> 45:33.760
 even if a fire alarm goes off.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.880
 Now, I don't want anyone burning to a crisp

45:35.880 --> 45:38.480
 because they didn't step away from their workflow.

45:38.480 --> 45:39.320
 That would be foolish.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.920
 But that's the mentality that I've embedded in myself

45:41.920 --> 45:44.640
 that there's nothing more important

45:44.640 --> 45:46.940
 than what I'm doing in that 90 minute block.

45:46.940 --> 45:47.840
 And that's what works for me.

45:47.840 --> 45:50.400
 You can try various other things.

45:50.400 --> 45:52.040
 That's what works for me.

45:52.040 --> 45:55.880
 In addition, I use low-level white noise.

45:55.880 --> 45:57.640
 This is something that is supported

45:57.640 --> 45:59.860
 by quality peer-reviewed data.

45:59.860 --> 46:03.340
 We covered this on the episode on hearing and balance,

46:03.340 --> 46:05.560
 but it turns out that white noise,

46:05.560 --> 46:08.120
 which is essentially all frequencies of sound,

46:09.040 --> 46:11.560
 or all frequencies of sound that we can perceive,

46:11.560 --> 46:14.200
 mixed up kind of randomly, there's no structure to it,

46:14.200 --> 46:16.120
 turned on at a low volume,

46:16.120 --> 46:18.480
 not with headphones most of the time,

46:18.480 --> 46:20.160
 puts the brain into a state

46:20.160 --> 46:22.700
 that's optimal for learning and workflow.

46:22.700 --> 46:25.720
 And I covered two papers during that episode,

46:25.720 --> 46:27.560
 one that showed that indeed,

46:28.700 --> 46:30.420
 brain area is involved in attention,

46:30.420 --> 46:33.320
 brain area is involved in focus and cognition and memory.

46:33.320 --> 46:36.800
 Those are engaged to a greater degree

46:36.800 --> 46:39.400
 when there is low levels of white noise

46:39.400 --> 46:40.680
 playing in the background.

46:40.680 --> 46:43.440
 The other paper that's really interesting did brain imaging

46:43.440 --> 46:44.700
 and showed that areas of the brain

46:44.700 --> 46:47.840
 that are associated with dopamine release

46:47.840 --> 46:50.600
 are increased by low levels of white noise.

46:50.600 --> 46:53.640
 Dopamine release is associated not just with pleasure,

46:53.640 --> 46:55.920
 but with motivation and craving.

46:55.920 --> 46:57.800
 So everything about this 90-minute block

46:57.800 --> 46:59.200
 from the low levels of white noise

46:59.200 --> 47:01.880
 to the position of my computer, how I'm standing,

47:01.880 --> 47:02.920
 where my eyes are positioned,

47:02.920 --> 47:05.760
 is geared towards putting me in this tunnel of work.

47:05.760 --> 47:07.760
 And I have to say that while it can be a challenge

47:07.760 --> 47:10.560
 to try and achieve this state and this tunnel of work,

47:10.560 --> 47:13.480
 some days you start to get kind of addicted to it.

47:13.480 --> 47:14.880
 It feels really good.

47:14.880 --> 47:16.360
 It's like a workout for the mind.

47:16.360 --> 47:19.920
 And it is something that as you exit that 90 minutes,

47:19.920 --> 47:22.080
 you really feel like you've accomplished a lot

47:22.080 --> 47:23.940
 because often you have,

47:23.940 --> 47:26.020
 and it just feels deeply satisfying.

47:26.020 --> 47:28.360
 And I'm convinced that that's because of the release

47:28.360 --> 47:31.680
 of neuromodulators like dopamine and the norepinephrine

47:31.680 --> 47:33.740
 that's circulating in your system.

47:33.740 --> 47:34.760
 And I want to be clear

47:34.760 --> 47:36.800
 that I'm not perfect about this 90 minutes.

47:36.800 --> 47:38.500
 Occasionally I get drawn away.

47:38.500 --> 47:40.860
 Occasionally something will happen

47:40.860 --> 47:43.120
 or I'll go use the restroom

47:43.120 --> 47:45.180
 or Costello will have a need

47:45.180 --> 47:48.220
 or somebody will have a need that I will have to respond to.

47:48.220 --> 47:49.860
 But I really try and achieve this

47:49.860 --> 47:52.280
 most if not every day that I'm alive

47:52.280 --> 47:55.580
 because for me, that work session is kind of holy.

47:55.580 --> 47:57.680
 It's where I set up a relationship,

47:57.680 --> 48:00.400
 not just between me and the work that I'm doing,

48:00.400 --> 48:03.920
 but between me and my ability to control

48:03.920 --> 48:06.880
 my own state of mind using these various supports

48:06.880 --> 48:08.120
 of the white noise, et cetera.

48:08.120 --> 48:10.760
 But really those supports are peripheral

48:10.760 --> 48:13.600
 to the fact that I'm creating this space.

48:13.600 --> 48:16.560
 I'm funneling my brain into a state

48:16.560 --> 48:19.600
 rather than allowing whatever events and contexts

48:19.600 --> 48:21.360
 on social media and elsewhere

48:21.360 --> 48:22.480
 might be occurring in the world

48:22.480 --> 48:25.640
 that would yank me out of what for me is my purpose

48:25.640 --> 48:26.520
 and my mission in life,

48:26.520 --> 48:28.400
 which is to do the sorts of work that I do.

48:28.400 --> 48:31.080
 There's a powerful way in which you can place the timing

48:31.080 --> 48:34.400
 of this 90 minute work bout in an optimal way.

48:35.720 --> 48:39.240
 You have access to a very important piece of data

48:39.240 --> 48:43.600
 that dictates when this bout should start more or less

48:43.600 --> 48:44.720
 and when it should end.

48:46.140 --> 48:48.680
 That piece of data is your temperature minimum.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.840
 If you're somebody who wakes up on average at 7 a.m.,

48:51.840 --> 48:54.680
 well then your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.

48:54.680 --> 48:57.400
 And you can be reasonably sure,

48:57.400 --> 48:58.440
 I won't underscore reasonably,

48:58.440 --> 49:01.720
 but you can be reasonably sure that your best work

49:01.720 --> 49:05.600
 is going to be done anywhere from four to six hours

49:05.600 --> 49:07.320
 after your temperature minimum.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.920
 So for me, I tend to wake up around 6.30 a.m.

49:09.920 --> 49:12.960
 That means my temperature minimum is at 4.30 a.m.

49:12.960 --> 49:15.060
 You can add five hours to that.

49:15.060 --> 49:17.400
 So that means that a 90 minute work bout

49:17.400 --> 49:22.400
 could fall at 9.30 a.m. and it would be fairly optimized.

49:22.440 --> 49:24.880
 Or I could do it at 10.30 a.m.

49:24.880 --> 49:28.520
 Or I could do it at 8.30 a.m., somewhere in there.

49:28.520 --> 49:30.680
 We can't say that it's exactly six hours

49:30.680 --> 49:31.720
 after your temperature minimum.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.220
 You will find it, however,

49:33.220 --> 49:36.160
 there is a precise and best time for you

49:36.160 --> 49:38.660
 to do this 90 minute work bout.

49:38.660 --> 49:41.000
 Whether or not it's five or six hours

49:41.000 --> 49:42.040
 after your temperature minimum

49:42.040 --> 49:44.120
 is going to vary from person to person.

49:44.120 --> 49:44.960
 How do I know this?

49:44.960 --> 49:46.120
 How do I know this relationship

49:46.120 --> 49:48.920
 between temperature minimum and focused cognition?

49:48.920 --> 49:52.400
 Well, temperature minimum defines the trough,

49:52.400 --> 49:56.280
 the nadir, as they say, of your temperature

49:56.280 --> 49:57.740
 across the 24 hour cycle.

49:57.740 --> 49:59.520
 And immediately after that,

49:59.520 --> 50:01.920
 your temperature will start to rise.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.580
 That temperature rise is actually what triggers

50:04.580 --> 50:07.420
 the initial cortisol release that you experience

50:07.420 --> 50:08.680
 and wakes you up further.

50:08.680 --> 50:10.680
 And then of course that sunlight that you're getting

50:10.680 --> 50:14.120
 is going to further enhance that healthy release of cortisol.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.380
 That cortisol will then provide fuel, if you will,

50:17.380 --> 50:18.840
 for that increase in temperature.

50:18.840 --> 50:21.400
 And your body will continue to increase in temperature

50:21.400 --> 50:23.920
 throughout the day toward the afternoon.

50:23.920 --> 50:27.200
 What you're trying to do in this idea

50:27.200 --> 50:29.740
 of optimizing this 90 minute work bout

50:29.740 --> 50:30.960
 to a particular time of day

50:30.960 --> 50:33.680
 is catch the portion of the steepest slope

50:33.680 --> 50:35.320
 of that temperature rise.

50:35.320 --> 50:38.880
 Now, again, you're not walking around with a thermocouple

50:38.880 --> 50:42.920
 or a thermometer in some orifice of your body.

50:42.920 --> 50:45.620
 So you don't have accurate information about temperature,

50:45.620 --> 50:48.560
 but you can make very good guesses

50:48.560 --> 50:51.980
 about when your body temperature is rising fastest

50:51.980 --> 50:53.560
 by virtue of that temperature minimum.

50:53.560 --> 50:56.560
 So again, just to be clear, it's a 90 minute work bout.

50:56.560 --> 50:58.040
 That's about what the brain can handle

50:58.040 --> 50:59.780
 for a very intense work bout.

51:00.960 --> 51:02.120
 Do understand again,

51:02.120 --> 51:03.880
 that there are going to be portions of that 90 minute

51:03.880 --> 51:05.820
 that your brain is flickering in and out of focus,

51:05.820 --> 51:07.720
 other portions where you're going to be entirely focused,

51:07.720 --> 51:09.040
 that's entirely normal.

51:09.040 --> 51:11.320
 But when to place that 90 minute work bout,

51:11.320 --> 51:13.840
 when to start it and when to end it

51:13.840 --> 51:15.760
 will depend on that temperature minimum.

51:15.760 --> 51:19.280
 So if you're somebody who wakes up at 8 a.m. each morning,

51:19.280 --> 51:21.200
 your temperature minimum is 6 a.m.,

51:21.200 --> 51:24.020
 chances are you're going to want to start this work bout

51:24.020 --> 51:28.320
 somewhere around 10 a.m. or 11 a.m.

51:28.320 --> 51:31.060
 Now, some people wake up and feel very alert

51:31.060 --> 51:31.900
 first thing in the morning.

51:31.900 --> 51:33.340
 They can really do their best work

51:33.340 --> 51:34.760
 first thing in the morning.

51:34.760 --> 51:37.480
 Please, if that's you, continue to do that.

51:37.480 --> 51:40.000
 Leverage that time, use that time.

51:40.000 --> 51:43.360
 But if you're somebody who struggles to find focus,

51:43.360 --> 51:45.400
 definitely let your physiology

51:45.400 --> 51:47.400
 and this rise in your body temperature

51:47.400 --> 51:49.680
 support your efforts to focus

51:49.680 --> 51:53.520
 rather than trying to do your best work at times of day

51:53.520 --> 51:57.440
 when your physiology is actually directing your body

51:57.440 --> 51:58.980
 and your brain toward defocus

51:58.980 --> 52:00.400
 and towards being more lethargic.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.940
 It just is setting yourself up for success

52:03.940 --> 52:05.040
 when you try and capture

52:05.040 --> 52:07.080
 this rising phase of your temperature.

52:07.080 --> 52:10.080
 So up until now, we've been emphasizing practices

52:10.080 --> 52:12.640
 that allow you to optimize your level of alertness

52:12.640 --> 52:14.540
 and your levels of mental focus.

52:15.980 --> 52:20.260
 Data going back to the 1990s supports the idea

52:20.260 --> 52:23.120
 that physical movement of particular kinds

52:23.120 --> 52:25.440
 can support brain health and brain function,

52:25.440 --> 52:28.600
 both in the immediate term and in the longterm.

52:28.600 --> 52:30.600
 Now, this is at a profound impact

52:30.600 --> 52:32.360
 on the field of neuroscience,

52:32.360 --> 52:34.360
 but frankly, it's also at a profound impact

52:34.360 --> 52:36.120
 on how I structure my day.

52:36.120 --> 52:39.300
 So after I've finished a bout of work,

52:39.300 --> 52:41.780
 this 90-minute bout of work,

52:41.780 --> 52:43.940
 I force myself some days, other days I want to,

52:43.940 --> 52:47.240
 but I force myself to do some sort of physical exercise

52:47.240 --> 52:49.800
 that is going to be supportive of my brain health

52:49.800 --> 52:51.800
 and brain function and organ health

52:51.800 --> 52:53.900
 and bodily function in general.

52:53.900 --> 52:55.360
 So I just briefly want to touch on

52:55.360 --> 52:58.640
 what the structure of that exercise looks like,

52:58.640 --> 52:59.960
 how it's structured within the day

52:59.960 --> 53:03.340
 and how it's structured across the weeks, in fact,

53:04.220 --> 53:06.160
 based on the scientific data

53:06.160 --> 53:10.040
 and what the scientific data say is best or optimal

53:10.040 --> 53:12.240
 in order to promote longevity of the brain,

53:12.240 --> 53:14.760
 ability to focus, as well as cardiovascular health

53:14.760 --> 53:17.520
 and all the other things that we know exercise supports.

53:17.520 --> 53:20.000
 Now, there are various forms of physical activity,

53:20.000 --> 53:21.740
 or what we call exercise,

53:21.740 --> 53:25.200
 but those can generally be batched into two categories.

53:25.200 --> 53:28.200
 First is strength and hypertrophy work,

53:28.200 --> 53:30.480
 so physical movements that are designed

53:30.480 --> 53:33.640
 to make you stronger and or make your muscles larger.

53:34.720 --> 53:37.200
 There's also endurance work,

53:37.200 --> 53:39.580
 physical exercise and movements that are designed

53:39.580 --> 53:42.940
 to allow you to do more work over time

53:42.940 --> 53:45.960
 or to extend the amount of time that you can do work

53:45.960 --> 53:49.340
 of any kind, both physical and mental.

53:49.340 --> 53:51.760
 And we did two full podcast episodes

53:51.760 --> 53:53.440
 on the details and the science

53:53.440 --> 53:55.860
 and the protocols related to these topics.

53:55.860 --> 53:59.440
 We did an episode on the science of strength

53:59.440 --> 54:03.060
 and hypertrophy, of building strength and muscle building,

54:03.060 --> 54:04.960
 and that included a lot of protocols.

54:04.960 --> 54:07.400
 And we did an episode on endurance,

54:07.400 --> 54:11.280
 how to build any one or all of the four types of endurance,

54:11.280 --> 54:13.880
 which are muscular endurance, anaerobic, aerobic,

54:13.880 --> 54:15.720
 long-distance endurance, et cetera.

54:15.720 --> 54:17.400
 So if you're interested in the specifics

54:17.400 --> 54:19.700
 of those protocols, please see those episodes.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.920
 However, right now, I just want to emphasize

54:22.920 --> 54:27.440
 how the data impact my day and how I structure my day

54:27.440 --> 54:30.000
 in a way that I can incorporate physical movement

54:30.000 --> 54:32.360
 in a way that supports my brain and health.

54:32.360 --> 54:35.620
 Basically, after I finish that cognitive workout,

54:35.620 --> 54:37.300
 that 90-minute workout,

54:37.300 --> 54:41.120
 I do some form of physical exercise for about an hour.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.700
 The data all point to the fact that working out hard

54:43.700 --> 54:46.680
 for longer than an hour can actually be detrimental

54:46.680 --> 54:49.160
 because of the way that it raises cortisol,

54:49.160 --> 54:50.560
 and cortisol can be a good thing

54:50.560 --> 54:53.480
 if it's appropriately timed and in the appropriate low levels

54:53.480 --> 54:56.160
 but you don't want to have your cortisol levels up

54:56.160 --> 54:57.980
 throughout the day or have big spikes

54:57.980 --> 55:00.080
 of cortisol repeatedly.

55:00.080 --> 55:02.000
 So keeping workouts relatively short

55:02.000 --> 55:03.680
 can definitely help with that.

55:03.680 --> 55:06.360
 And certainly, if you're training hard,

55:06.360 --> 55:08.960
 60 minutes or less should be more than sufficient.

55:08.960 --> 55:10.360
 And for many people, including myself,

55:10.360 --> 55:13.520
 45 minutes or 50 minutes is probably even more optimal.

55:14.500 --> 55:16.920
 The basic design of this physical exercise

55:16.920 --> 55:19.500
 is that it be approximately 60 minutes,

55:19.500 --> 55:21.640
 so maybe 60 plus or minus 15 minutes

55:21.640 --> 55:23.420
 should be well within the margins

55:23.420 --> 55:27.160
 of keeping hormonal health proper and not going too long

55:27.160 --> 55:30.560
 nor making the workout so short that it's not beneficial.

55:30.560 --> 55:32.680
 And essentially, what the data tell us

55:32.680 --> 55:35.560
 is that in order to optimize cardiovascular and brain health

55:35.560 --> 55:37.220
 and other systems of the body,

55:37.220 --> 55:40.880
 we want to exercise at least five days per week.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.660
 I know that seems like a lot.

55:42.660 --> 55:44.660
 It certainly is a lot for certain people.

55:44.660 --> 55:48.320
 Some of you, you compulsive exercisers might gasp

55:48.320 --> 55:49.880
 at the idea of taking two days off.

55:49.880 --> 55:52.860
 I personally find that taking two full days off per week

55:52.860 --> 55:55.140
 is actually both beneficial

55:55.140 --> 55:59.640
 to my exercise training performance as well as pleasant.

55:59.640 --> 56:00.900
 I like those rest days.

56:01.800 --> 56:05.060
 But essentially, the structure of the exercise regimen

56:05.060 --> 56:06.780
 that works for sake of supporting health

56:06.780 --> 56:09.640
 is going to be one in which there's a three to two ratio,

56:09.640 --> 56:14.520
 where for a 12-week period or so, maybe 10 to 12 weeks,

56:14.520 --> 56:16.460
 three of those five workouts per week

56:16.460 --> 56:18.240
 emphasize strength and hypertrophy,

56:18.240 --> 56:21.000
 and the other two emphasize endurance.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.600
 Then after 10 or 12 weeks,

56:22.600 --> 56:25.120
 one switches over to a 10 or 12-week regimen

56:25.120 --> 56:27.720
 of doing a three to two ratio

56:27.720 --> 56:29.840
 where you're prioritizing endurance work.

56:29.840 --> 56:31.940
 So primarily, the sorts of workouts

56:31.940 --> 56:33.760
 that are described in the endurance episode

56:33.760 --> 56:35.520
 and those protocols and the other two days,

56:35.520 --> 56:37.780
 you're focusing on strength and hypertrophy work

56:37.780 --> 56:40.760
 merely to maintain strength and hypertrophy,

56:40.760 --> 56:44.240
 to not lose the strength and hypertrophy that you've created.

56:44.240 --> 56:46.560
 And there are a lot of data now supporting the fact

56:46.560 --> 56:49.840
 that maintaining muscular health and bone health

56:49.840 --> 56:51.500
 is supported by resistance training,

56:51.500 --> 56:53.000
 weight training of various kinds.

56:53.000 --> 56:54.520
 It can also be done with body weight

56:54.520 --> 56:56.240
 if you don't have access to equipment.

56:56.240 --> 56:59.580
 And of course, that doing cardiovascular endurance work

56:59.580 --> 57:02.500
 is very beneficial both to the muscles of the body,

57:02.500 --> 57:05.320
 the organs of the body, but also to the brain.

57:05.320 --> 57:06.740
 Many of you have probably heard

57:06.740 --> 57:11.020
 that doing physical exercise of various kinds

57:11.020 --> 57:13.720
 can support the production of new neurons in the brain.

57:13.720 --> 57:18.160
 Frankly, those data are specific to research animals.

57:18.160 --> 57:21.880
 As far as we know, increases in neuron number

57:21.880 --> 57:25.440
 are not supported by exercise in humans.

57:25.440 --> 57:27.120
 There's a little bit of data that supports

57:27.120 --> 57:29.140
 that maybe a few neurons might get created

57:29.140 --> 57:31.520
 by running or weightlifting or things of that sort

57:31.520 --> 57:34.700
 in human beings, but there's still a host of other reasons

57:34.700 --> 57:37.200
 to have this hour or so per day

57:37.200 --> 57:39.960
 where one is doing physical exercise.

57:39.960 --> 57:43.320
 And those include increased blood flow to the brain.

57:43.320 --> 57:44.880
 Remember, the brain is an organ too.

57:44.880 --> 57:47.920
 It's the most metabolically demanding organ in your body,

57:47.920 --> 57:51.320
 and it's receiving those metabolic factors.

57:51.320 --> 57:54.080
 It's receiving its fuels by way of vasculature,

57:54.080 --> 57:55.960
 of blood vessels and capillaries and veins

57:55.960 --> 57:57.300
 and things of that sort.

57:57.300 --> 58:00.060
 So movement is very crucial

58:00.060 --> 58:02.000
 to get your brain to function properly.

58:02.900 --> 58:05.080
 Movement of various kinds is very important

58:05.080 --> 58:07.040
 to get your brain to function properly.

58:07.040 --> 58:09.640
 Resistance training turns out to be as important

58:09.640 --> 58:12.180
 as endurance training because of the way

58:12.180 --> 58:14.540
 that it stimulates the release of particular hormones

58:14.540 --> 58:17.580
 actually from bones, things like osteocalcin,

58:17.580 --> 58:20.080
 which can positively impact brain function

58:20.080 --> 58:22.560
 and can support the health of existing neurons

58:22.560 --> 58:24.540
 as opposed to increasing the number of neurons.

58:24.540 --> 58:26.220
 Turns out increasing the number of neurons

58:26.220 --> 58:28.000
 may not actually be as beneficial as we think.

58:28.000 --> 58:30.280
 It all sounds great, more neurons, more neurons.

58:30.280 --> 58:33.380
 Certainly more neurons is better than fewer neurons

58:33.380 --> 58:36.240
 and losing neurons, but incorporating new neurons

58:36.240 --> 58:38.640
 into existing brain circuitry is actually very challenging

58:38.640 --> 58:39.680
 for the brain to do.

58:39.680 --> 58:43.000
 I make sure that after that work about,

58:43.000 --> 58:47.200
 I get this one hour or so of exercise five days per week

58:47.200 --> 58:49.900
 because of the ways that it supports my general health.

58:49.900 --> 58:53.320
 And there are now hundreds of studies supporting the fact

58:53.320 --> 58:58.000
 that both endurance work and strength training

58:58.000 --> 59:01.340
 or hypertrophy training done in combination,

59:01.340 --> 59:03.340
 meaning not necessarily in the same workout,

59:03.340 --> 59:07.040
 but done across the week is immensely beneficial

59:07.040 --> 59:08.120
 for the production of things

59:08.120 --> 59:10.220
 like brain-derived nootropic factor,

59:10.220 --> 59:14.360
 for limiting inflammatory cytokines like IL-6,

59:14.360 --> 59:17.660
 for promoting anti-inflammatory cytokines like IL-10,

59:17.660 --> 59:20.860
 provided that exercise is of the proper duration

59:20.860 --> 59:23.120
 and that it's not so intense

59:23.120 --> 59:25.020
 that you're actually creating damage

59:25.020 --> 59:26.940
 to the various systems of the body.

59:26.940 --> 59:28.540
 Now, where is the threshold

59:28.540 --> 59:33.440
 between optimal sub-threshold and detrimental?

59:33.440 --> 59:36.020
 This is a complicated theme

59:36.020 --> 59:37.660
 if we don't put some structure around it.

59:37.660 --> 59:39.020
 So let's put a little bit of structure around it.

59:39.020 --> 59:41.060
 We already said that about 60 minutes,

59:41.060 --> 59:43.940
 so 60 minutes plus or minus 15 minutes

59:43.940 --> 59:47.020
 is going to be optimal for all these health benefits.

59:48.140 --> 59:49.980
 What about the structure of the actual workouts?

59:49.980 --> 59:53.340
 Well, we need to address this issue of intensity.

59:54.240 --> 59:56.940
 A good rule of thumb based on the literature,

59:56.940 --> 59:58.740
 and I discussed this with Dr. Andy Galpin

59:58.740 --> 1:00:00.260
 prior to the strength and hypertrophy

1:00:00.260 --> 1:00:01.660
 and the endurance episodes,

1:00:01.660 --> 1:00:03.380
 and the literature that's published

1:00:03.380 --> 1:00:04.700
 in quality peer-reviewed journals

1:00:04.700 --> 1:00:05.820
 really points to the fact

1:00:05.820 --> 1:00:10.540
 that approximately 80% of the resistance training you do

1:00:10.540 --> 1:00:11.820
 should be resistance training

1:00:11.820 --> 1:00:13.540
 that doesn't go to what they call failure,

1:00:13.540 --> 1:00:17.980
 where you can't actually move the resistance anymore.

1:00:17.980 --> 1:00:20.700
 The other 20% can be of the higher intensity

1:00:20.700 --> 1:00:22.580
 to failure type training.

1:00:22.580 --> 1:00:24.500
 Now, with respect to endurance work,

1:00:25.680 --> 1:00:27.380
 one can build up endurance

1:00:27.380 --> 1:00:30.480
 without having to log long, long mileage

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:33.380
 or extensive mileage in the pool or by running,

1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:35.780
 and that's because there are these other forms of endurance

1:00:35.780 --> 1:00:37.300
 that can build up, for instance,

1:00:37.300 --> 1:00:38.920
 the capillary beds within the muscles.

1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:40.820
 Building up the capillary beds within the muscles

1:00:40.820 --> 1:00:44.260
 will allow more oxygen utilization within the muscles,

1:00:44.260 --> 1:00:46.360
 and thereby will increase your endurance,

1:00:46.360 --> 1:00:47.200
 both of the muscles,

1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:50.060
 but also will improve brain metabolism

1:00:50.060 --> 1:00:52.140
 and the way that the heart functions

1:00:52.140 --> 1:00:53.500
 of cardiovascular function.

1:00:54.540 --> 1:00:59.500
 That 80-20 rule of less than failure and work to failure

1:00:59.500 --> 1:01:01.760
 in the resistance exercise regime

1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:04.020
 can be transported or translated

1:01:04.020 --> 1:01:06.300
 to the endurance exercise portion

1:01:06.300 --> 1:01:08.460
 by focusing on that thing that we're familiar with,

1:01:08.460 --> 1:01:09.300
 which is the burn.

1:01:09.300 --> 1:01:11.020
 When we're running hard or cycling hard,

1:01:11.020 --> 1:01:12.820
 we'll experience a kind of burning of the muscles

1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:15.980
 that's associated with the lactate system.

1:01:15.980 --> 1:01:17.140
 During the episode on endurance,

1:01:17.140 --> 1:01:22.020
 I pointed out that that burn is not lactic acid.

1:01:22.020 --> 1:01:25.560
 Contrary to common belief, it is not lactic acid.

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:27.620
 It's associated with lactate metabolism,

1:01:27.620 --> 1:01:31.080
 and again, about 80% of the endurance work

1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:33.980
 should not incorporate that so-called burn,

1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:36.660
 but if 20% of that work or so,

1:01:36.660 --> 1:01:39.140
 I should say approximately 20% of that work

1:01:39.140 --> 1:01:42.040
 does include the so-called burning sensation,

1:01:42.980 --> 1:01:46.440
 that burning sensation actually triggers the activation

1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:50.820
 of release of certain compounds and molecules from glia,

1:01:50.820 --> 1:01:54.140
 this brain cell type that supports neuron health,

1:01:54.140 --> 1:01:56.080
 and actually the lactate system

1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:58.460
 is its own form of fuel for the brain,

1:01:58.460 --> 1:02:00.220
 and so there's increasing interest

1:02:00.220 --> 1:02:04.440
 in generating the lactate or pushing past

1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:06.460
 that lactate threshold for small portion,

1:02:06.460 --> 1:02:08.340
 20% or so of endurance work

1:02:08.340 --> 1:02:10.540
 in order to support brain health and function.

1:02:10.540 --> 1:02:14.080
 So what does this all look like as a protocol?

1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:16.660
 Well, as I mentioned before, this three to two ratio,

1:02:16.660 --> 1:02:20.160
 so maybe you spend 10 weeks or so or 12 weeks or so

1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:21.620
 focusing mainly on endurance work,

1:02:21.620 --> 1:02:23.780
 three workouts per week on endurance work,

1:02:23.780 --> 1:02:27.060
 80% of those workouts, meaning 80% of the time

1:02:27.060 --> 1:02:29.060
 you're below that burn threshold,

1:02:29.060 --> 1:02:32.100
 you are not experiencing a burning sensation,

1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:34.840
 but that for 20% of it, you are,

1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:37.220
 that based on the scientific data

1:02:37.220 --> 1:02:39.860
 should support lactate metabolism, brain health, et cetera,

1:02:39.860 --> 1:02:42.380
 as well as cardiovascular health and oxygen utilization,

1:02:42.380 --> 1:02:45.540
 all the forms of endurance that we're aware of,

1:02:45.540 --> 1:02:47.060
 and then the other two workouts

1:02:47.060 --> 1:02:48.660
 would involve resistance training,

1:02:48.660 --> 1:02:50.860
 again, with this 80-20 split,

1:02:50.860 --> 1:02:54.420
 where 80% of the work is not to failure and 20% is,

1:02:54.420 --> 1:02:56.980
 and then maybe after 10, 12 weeks, you switch,

1:02:56.980 --> 1:02:59.820
 where you start emphasizing strength and hypertrophy work

1:02:59.820 --> 1:03:00.860
 for three of the workouts

1:03:00.860 --> 1:03:03.680
 and endurance work for two of the workouts.

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:04.980
 Now, of course, some of you will be able

1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:06.340
 to train six days a week,

1:03:06.340 --> 1:03:08.700
 or you'll compulsively need to train seven days a week.

1:03:08.700 --> 1:03:10.000
 If you decide to do that,

1:03:10.900 --> 1:03:12.940
 please be aware that this cortisol threshold

1:03:12.940 --> 1:03:13.760
 is a real thing.

1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:16.820
 So for me, the three to two ratio works out perfectly

1:03:16.820 --> 1:03:18.580
 because I like two full days off a week.

1:03:18.580 --> 1:03:20.540
 When I take those really depends on my schedule

1:03:20.540 --> 1:03:21.380
 and how I'm feeling.

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:22.440
 Sometimes it's two days in a row,

1:03:22.440 --> 1:03:24.480
 sometimes they're interspersed throughout the week,

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:26.640
 but in reviewing the scientific literature

1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:29.580
 for those two episodes of the podcast

1:03:29.580 --> 1:03:32.580
 and in talking to people who are really informed

1:03:32.580 --> 1:03:36.160
 in the world of resistance training and endurance training

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:39.020
 and how that relates to brain health and body health,

1:03:39.020 --> 1:03:41.480
 this seems to be the most rational and grounded protocol.

1:03:41.480 --> 1:03:42.980
 So that's the one that I follow.

1:03:42.980 --> 1:03:47.080
 So on any given day, I finish that work block and I train.

1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:49.400
 I do some sort of resistance or endurance training.

1:03:49.400 --> 1:03:52.940
 I put those on alternate days or different days, rather.

1:03:52.940 --> 1:03:55.340
 So we've now talked about the arc that spans

1:03:55.340 --> 1:04:00.340
 all the way from waking to a morning bout of focused work

1:04:00.900 --> 1:04:02.320
 to physical training.

1:04:03.620 --> 1:04:06.840
 I have not mentioned ingesting anything or nutrients.

1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:08.160
 One of the most common questions I get

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:10.220
 are what should I eat for my brain?

1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:12.220
 Well, ironically enough,

1:04:12.220 --> 1:04:13.660
 one of the best things you can do for your brain

1:04:13.660 --> 1:04:14.780
 is to not eat.

1:04:14.780 --> 1:04:16.980
 But of course we all have to eat sooner or later

1:04:16.980 --> 1:04:18.140
 and eating is wonderful.

1:04:18.140 --> 1:04:19.460
 I absolutely love eating.

1:04:19.460 --> 1:04:22.100
 I even enjoy the mere act of chewing.

1:04:22.100 --> 1:04:25.260
 But the question of what to eat is an important one

1:04:25.260 --> 1:04:28.460
 as it relates to brain health and brain function.

1:04:28.460 --> 1:04:29.980
 Before we talk about that,

1:04:29.980 --> 1:04:33.260
 I want to emphasize that training fasted

1:04:33.260 --> 1:04:37.060
 actually has some immediate and long-term benefits.

1:04:37.060 --> 1:04:39.060
 Prior to having my lab at Stanford,

1:04:39.060 --> 1:04:41.660
 I was down in San Diego at UC San Diego

1:04:41.660 --> 1:04:42.660
 and had an appointment

1:04:42.660 --> 1:04:44.980
 at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies.

1:04:44.980 --> 1:04:47.180
 I had a colleague there by the name of Sachin Panda.

1:04:47.180 --> 1:04:49.660
 He wrote a wonderful book called The Circadian Code.

1:04:49.660 --> 1:04:52.140
 He runs a serious biology laboratory

1:04:52.140 --> 1:04:55.300
 focusing on metabolism, circadian rhythms, and so forth,

1:04:55.300 --> 1:04:57.360
 as well as the effects of fasting.

1:04:59.260 --> 1:05:02.080
 Sachin and his book, The Circadian Code,

1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:06.300
 describe how engaging in physical exercise while fasted

1:05:06.300 --> 1:05:08.660
 can amplify the effects of that exercise,

1:05:08.660 --> 1:05:11.100
 not just for sake of increasing the percentage

1:05:11.100 --> 1:05:13.320
 of things like body fat burned, et cetera,

1:05:13.320 --> 1:05:15.840
 but for cellular health, liver health,

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:17.820
 and the health of other organs.

1:05:17.820 --> 1:05:19.580
 So where possible,

1:05:19.580 --> 1:05:24.580
 I do strive to do my workout without eating anything first.

1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:27.060
 However, some days I'm very, very hungry,

1:05:27.060 --> 1:05:31.860
 and so I do ingest water, which contains electrolytes.

1:05:31.860 --> 1:05:34.100
 So that means sodium, magnesium, potassium,

1:05:34.100 --> 1:05:37.560
 for the simple reason that sodium, magnesium, potassium

1:05:37.560 --> 1:05:40.820
 are required for neurons to function properly.

1:05:40.820 --> 1:05:43.860
 It's part of the way they generate electrical activity.

1:05:44.880 --> 1:05:49.180
 As well, ingesting electrolytes for me can quell hunger.

1:05:49.180 --> 1:05:51.220
 And this points to a whole other topic

1:05:51.220 --> 1:05:53.140
 we could do another episode on at some point,

1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:55.040
 which is many times people will think

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:56.340
 that their blood sugar is low,

1:05:56.340 --> 1:05:58.400
 and actually that's not the case.

1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:02.380
 And frankly, one wouldn't want their blood sugar to be high.

1:06:02.380 --> 1:06:04.200
 You don't want your blood sugar too low,

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:06.020
 but you also don't want it too high.

1:06:06.020 --> 1:06:08.180
 Very low blood sugar is terrible,

1:06:08.180 --> 1:06:10.140
 but low-ish blood sugar tends to give us

1:06:10.140 --> 1:06:12.200
 a sense of mental clarity and focus

1:06:12.200 --> 1:06:14.500
 related to this adrenaline phenomenon

1:06:14.500 --> 1:06:16.300
 that we talked about earlier.

1:06:16.300 --> 1:06:18.880
 In order to be able to focus on exercise or work

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:21.860
 or anything else, you need sufficient electrolytes.

1:06:21.860 --> 1:06:24.660
 And so many people find that if they simply ingest

1:06:24.660 --> 1:06:26.140
 some water with salt,

1:06:26.140 --> 1:06:28.460
 maybe a 99 milligram potassium tablet,

1:06:28.460 --> 1:06:30.760
 all of a sudden they feel very mentally clear

1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:33.300
 and able to do physical work and mental work.

1:06:33.300 --> 1:06:37.360
 So what I do is prior to this morning exercise,

1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:40.860
 although it's now late morning in this way I'm describing it

1:06:40.860 --> 1:06:42.940
 and typically it does occur late morning,

1:06:42.940 --> 1:06:45.140
 I'll have some water with either

1:06:45.140 --> 1:06:47.860
 so little, maybe half a teaspoon of sea salt

1:06:47.860 --> 1:06:50.540
 with a 99 milligram potassium tablet,

1:06:50.540 --> 1:06:52.500
 or these days I'm fond of taking

1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:54.820
 what's called Element, L-M-N-T, Element.

1:06:54.820 --> 1:06:56.660
 I learned about this from Lex Friedman's podcast.

1:06:56.660 --> 1:06:58.220
 I know many of you are familiar with Lex.

1:06:58.220 --> 1:07:01.260
 He's an excellent podcast, excellent scientist.

1:07:01.260 --> 1:07:03.540
 I don't have any business relationship to Element.

1:07:03.540 --> 1:07:05.280
 They're not a sponsor of the podcast,

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:07.820
 but Element is a product that essentially

1:07:07.820 --> 1:07:10.860
 contains electrolytes, sodium, potassium,

1:07:10.860 --> 1:07:12.380
 as well as magnesium malate,

1:07:12.380 --> 1:07:14.220
 which has been shown to offset things

1:07:14.220 --> 1:07:16.140
 like delayed onset muscle soreness.

1:07:16.140 --> 1:07:19.520
 That form of magnesium doesn't make people drowsy.

1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:22.480
 It's not an anxiolytic like some other forms of magnesium.

1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:25.320
 An anxiolytic is just one that reduces anxiety.

1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:26.320
 So whether or not it's Element

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:27.460
 or whether or not you're just putting a little bit

1:07:27.460 --> 1:07:30.300
 of salt into some water and ingesting that

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:31.920
 prior to training, that can be an excellent way

1:07:31.920 --> 1:07:34.060
 to ensure that you're able to complete

1:07:34.060 --> 1:07:36.820
 the physical exercise even though

1:07:36.820 --> 1:07:37.940
 you haven't eaten anything.

1:07:37.940 --> 1:07:40.180
 And I confess some days I will eat a little bit before

1:07:40.180 --> 1:07:43.440
 my workout just because I can't seem to resist eating.

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:46.520
 I want to mention the use of stimulants

1:07:46.520 --> 1:07:47.800
 before physical training.

1:07:48.680 --> 1:07:52.120
 This has certain benefits and certain drawbacks.

1:07:52.120 --> 1:07:55.540
 The benefits are sometimes it can facilitate motivation

1:07:55.540 --> 1:07:58.300
 because things like caffeine can increase

1:07:58.300 --> 1:07:59.320
 the release of dopamine,

1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:01.200
 can increase the release of epinephrine,

1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:03.480
 can reduce that adenosine level in the bloodstream.

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:06.120
 So some people use caffeine before training

1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:07.320
 in ways that benefit them.

1:08:07.320 --> 1:08:09.480
 It can also increase fat oxidation

1:08:09.480 --> 1:08:12.380
 and kind of fat metabolism and things if that's your goal.

1:08:12.380 --> 1:08:16.020
 I am not a particular fan of ingesting stimulants

1:08:16.020 --> 1:08:19.140
 before training because of a whole set of problems

1:08:19.140 --> 1:08:22.680
 associated with most forms of stimulants

1:08:22.680 --> 1:08:24.380
 in the form of energy drinks, et cetera.

1:08:24.380 --> 1:08:25.760
 I am not a fan of energy drinks.

1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:29.900
 I did a decent portion of a previous episode

1:08:29.900 --> 1:08:31.620
 on food and mood on energy drinks

1:08:31.620 --> 1:08:33.980
 and some of the detrimental things they contain.

1:08:33.980 --> 1:08:37.420
 Rather, I try and train simply by ingesting

1:08:37.420 --> 1:08:39.300
 the caffeine sources I mentioned before,

1:08:39.300 --> 1:08:43.540
 guayusa, mate, some electrolytes, some water.

1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:45.660
 Occasionally I'll have an espresso or a cup of coffee

1:08:45.660 --> 1:08:46.740
 before I train.

1:08:46.740 --> 1:08:51.440
 And on rare occasions, I should emphasize rare occasions,

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:54.140
 if I really need help increasing my motivation

1:08:54.140 --> 1:08:56.260
 or I decide I want to push extremely hard,

1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:58.580
 I will ingest something like alpha-GPC.

1:08:58.580 --> 1:09:01.980
 Alpha-GPC supports the release of a neuromodulator

1:09:01.980 --> 1:09:03.020
 called acetylcholine.

1:09:03.020 --> 1:09:05.600
 So 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC has been shown

1:09:05.600 --> 1:09:07.460
 to increase physical performance,

1:09:07.460 --> 1:09:09.280
 but also cognitive performance.

1:09:09.280 --> 1:09:11.840
 Some people might not be interested in ingesting anything

1:09:11.840 --> 1:09:14.080
 to improve their physical performance or anything at all,

1:09:14.080 --> 1:09:15.820
 but they might be addressing

1:09:15.820 --> 1:09:18.360
 how they can improve cognitive performance and focus.

1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:21.320
 And alpha-GPC is a non-stimulant way to approach that.

1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:23.000
 Again, definitely check with your doctor

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.580
 before taking anything or stopping to take anything,

1:09:25.580 --> 1:09:28.420
 but alpha-GPC has been shown in various studies

1:09:28.420 --> 1:09:30.020
 to improve cognitive performance

1:09:30.020 --> 1:09:33.480
 and in people who have age-related cognitive decline,

1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:35.940
 there have been some positive benefits

1:09:35.940 --> 1:09:38.740
 reported in quality peer-reviewed journals.

1:09:38.740 --> 1:09:40.780
 If you want to explore those references,

1:09:40.780 --> 1:09:44.140
 please go to examine.com, please put in alpha-GPC,

1:09:44.140 --> 1:09:45.660
 go to the Human Effect Matrix,

1:09:45.660 --> 1:09:48.700
 and there you can find details of those studies,

1:09:48.700 --> 1:09:50.620
 references to PubMed, et cetera.

1:09:50.620 --> 1:09:52.980
 So let's talk about food timing first.

1:09:52.980 --> 1:09:56.280
 As I mentioned, I eat my first meal sometime around noon,

1:09:56.280 --> 1:09:59.160
 plus or minus an hour for the reasons we've discussed.

1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:02.780
 The volume of food is also important.

1:10:02.780 --> 1:10:06.480
 If you eat a large volume of anything,

1:10:06.480 --> 1:10:09.280
 because it diverts blood to your gut,

1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:10.800
 you will feel lethargic

1:10:10.800 --> 1:10:13.560
 and you will have less blood going to your brain.

1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:15.400
 That seems like a simple and trivial fact,

1:10:15.400 --> 1:10:17.480
 but if you want to be able to think,

1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:20.820
 you can't ingest large volumes of anything into your gut.

1:10:20.820 --> 1:10:22.840
 So the discussion about what foods give you energy

1:10:22.840 --> 1:10:26.500
 is kind of moot if you eat enormous volumes of that food.

1:10:26.500 --> 1:10:29.900
 Now, the volumes are going to depend on you and your needs

1:10:29.900 --> 1:10:31.780
 and your activity levels.

1:10:31.780 --> 1:10:36.280
 I'm going to discuss what I do in terms of food content,

1:10:36.280 --> 1:10:38.000
 but I'm not going to discuss food volume.

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.660
 I sort of know where that mostly full, like 80% full line is

1:10:42.660 --> 1:10:45.120
 and I usually eat a little bit past that, frankly,

1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:48.480
 and I'm able to maintain a decent degree of alertness

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:49.440
 into the afternoon.

1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:50.280
 And that's my goal.

1:10:50.280 --> 1:10:51.800
 And I think that's the goal of most people

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:55.640
 to not work out in the morning or do some work

1:10:55.640 --> 1:10:57.280
 and then just collapse into a slumber

1:10:57.280 --> 1:10:58.340
 that lasts all afternoon,

1:10:58.340 --> 1:11:02.440
 but to be able to generate alert, calm, focused states

1:11:02.440 --> 1:11:04.020
 throughout the day.

1:11:04.020 --> 1:11:08.300
 So for lunch, I do emphasize slightly lower carbohydrate

1:11:08.300 --> 1:11:11.580
 or low carbohydrate intake for the simple reason

1:11:11.580 --> 1:11:14.460
 that adrenaline and dopamine

1:11:14.460 --> 1:11:16.840
 and their associated neuromodulators

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:18.960
 are going to support alertness.

1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:22.740
 So for me, I fast up until about noon.

1:11:22.740 --> 1:11:25.800
 Then I eat a lunch that consists of some sort

1:11:25.800 --> 1:11:28.600
 of protein thing, like some meat or some chicken

1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:31.720
 or some salmon and some vegetables, et cetera.

1:11:31.720 --> 1:11:34.700
 And if I've exercised previously,

1:11:34.700 --> 1:11:37.140
 which I do, as I mentioned, five days a week,

1:11:37.140 --> 1:11:39.040
 then I will ingest some starches.

1:11:39.040 --> 1:11:43.240
 I'll ingest some bread or rice or oatmeal

1:11:43.240 --> 1:11:45.000
 and butter and nuts and things like that.

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.340
 I will consume the various food groups, as they say,

1:11:49.340 --> 1:11:52.520
 but I will keep the total amount of carbohydrate

1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:54.120
 a little bit on the low side,

1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:56.640
 or if I haven't trained, I won't have any carbohydrate

1:11:56.640 --> 1:11:59.680
 at all, not because I'm ketogenic,

1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:01.640
 not because I'm anti-carbohydrate,

1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:04.600
 not because I'm on a pure carnivore diet, far from it,

1:12:04.600 --> 1:12:09.600
 but because starches cause the release of serotonin

1:12:09.880 --> 1:12:13.000
 in the brain and lend themselves to a state of sleepiness.

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:16.840
 Now, I should mention that about 25% of individuals

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:20.020
 have genes that encode for enzymes that allow them

1:12:20.020 --> 1:12:22.160
 to eat large amounts of carbohydrate

1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:24.240
 and not suffer from this lethargy,

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:26.500
 this kind of sedation from carbohydrates,

1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:28.780
 but I don't have that gene.

1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:34.300
 And so for me, eating a noon-ish meal

1:12:34.300 --> 1:12:36.620
 that is not enormous, but is decent in size,

1:12:36.620 --> 1:12:39.920
 but that is mainly protein, healthy fats,

1:12:39.920 --> 1:12:42.140
 and low-ish carbohydrates or no carbohydrates

1:12:42.140 --> 1:12:45.600
 is what allows me to achieve heightened states of alertness

1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:48.800
 throughout the day, which is what I need for my purposes.

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:52.280
 So just knowing that meats and nuts support alertness,

1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:53.960
 provided you don't eat too much of them,

1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:55.880
 that vegetables are healthy for us

1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:57.360
 and therefore we should eat them,

1:12:57.360 --> 1:12:58.880
 and I happen to like them as well,

1:12:58.880 --> 1:13:00.680
 and that carbohydrates tend to have

1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:04.080
 a kind of sedative-like quality to them,

1:13:04.080 --> 1:13:07.280
 that should help you kind of guide your food choices

1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:08.960
 in an intelligent way that's grounded

1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:12.860
 in the scientific literature as it relates to alertness.

1:13:12.860 --> 1:13:14.900
 Now, what about components of foods

1:13:14.900 --> 1:13:17.480
 that are not about alertness, but are about mood?

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:19.720
 We did an entire episode on mood and food,

1:13:19.720 --> 1:13:23.480
 and it's very clear, based on now dozens of studies,

1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:28.480
 that ingesting sufficient levels of omega-3 fatty acids

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:30.900
 is going to support healthy mood

1:13:30.900 --> 1:13:33.820
 and even can act as an antidepressant.

1:13:33.820 --> 1:13:35.900
 More than a dozen studies have shown

1:13:35.900 --> 1:13:39.200
 that ingesting at least 1,000 milligrams per day

1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:42.700
 of the EPA form of essential fatty acid

1:13:42.700 --> 1:13:46.520
 is as effective as prescription antidepressants

1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:48.200
 in relieving depression.

1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:49.100
 And if you're somebody

1:13:49.100 --> 1:13:51.520
 who requires prescription antidepressants,

1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:53.400
 Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera,

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:56.960
 it can allow people to take lower doses

1:13:56.960 --> 1:13:58.880
 of those medications, which in many cases

1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:01.520
 is a positive thing or a good thing to do

1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:03.220
 because of the side-effect profiles

1:14:03.220 --> 1:14:04.880
 that many of those drugs carry.

1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:08.360
 So I find these data remarkably compelling.

1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:12.640
 I mean, here we have a food or a substance from food

1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:15.720
 that can improve our mood and our sense of wellbeing,

1:14:15.720 --> 1:14:18.160
 and it does that by way of increasing

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:19.620
 certain neuromodulators in the brain,

1:14:19.620 --> 1:14:20.760
 in particular dopamine,

1:14:20.760 --> 1:14:23.160
 but also some other related neuromodulators.

1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:26.440
 So if you're eating fatty salmon regularly,

1:14:26.440 --> 1:14:28.840
 if you're eating krill regularly,

1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:31.560
 meaning if you're a whale,

1:14:31.560 --> 1:14:34.400
 if you're ingesting foods

1:14:34.400 --> 1:14:36.240
 that tend to have a lot of omega-3s,

1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:38.980
 you probably don't need to supplement with omega-3.

1:14:38.980 --> 1:14:42.820
 Most people are not ingesting sufficient levels of omega-3s,

1:14:42.820 --> 1:14:44.880
 and I'm certainly one of those people.

1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:46.360
 Despite an effort to eat good foods

1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:49.120
 and whole foods, et cetera, and unprocessed foods,

1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:51.480
 I've made the choice to ingest

1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:53.760
 at least 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA.

1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:55.080
 I do that in the form of fish oil

1:14:55.080 --> 1:14:57.640
 and the EPA, DHA combination fish oil,

1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:00.160
 but the threshold of 1,000 milligrams

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:02.280
 is not 1,000 milligrams of fish oil,

1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:04.680
 it's 1,000 milligrams of EPA.

1:15:04.680 --> 1:15:07.480
 Now, for those of you that don't want to consume fish oils

1:15:07.480 --> 1:15:11.080
 and prefer to get your omega-3s from non-animal sources,

1:15:11.080 --> 1:15:13.500
 there are non-animal sources,

1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:15.000
 various forms of algae, et cetera.

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.840
 You can just look that up online

1:15:16.840 --> 1:15:18.020
 and you should be able to find that.

1:15:18.020 --> 1:15:19.480
 There are also a number of foods

1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:21.640
 that include these essential omega-3s.

1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:23.240
 We did an episode on food and mood

1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:26.520
 where I go into more detail than you could ever want on that

1:15:26.520 --> 1:15:29.440
 as well as some additional recommendations.

1:15:29.440 --> 1:15:31.600
 We also did an episode on thyroid function,

1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:33.980
 this hormone that's important for metabolism,

1:15:33.980 --> 1:15:36.160
 and that pointed to the importance

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:37.680
 of getting sufficient iodine,

1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:39.200
 which you should naturally get

1:15:39.200 --> 1:15:40.520
 from the salts you're ingesting

1:15:40.520 --> 1:15:42.240
 provided you're ingesting enough salt.

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:47.000
 I'm not somebody who eats a lot of kelp or seaweed,

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:48.380
 although I don't mind the taste of seaweed,

1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:50.000
 I don't ingest it regularly,

1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:53.560
 but ingesting sufficient selenium or selenium

1:15:53.560 --> 1:15:55.080
 has been shown to be important

1:15:55.080 --> 1:15:57.300
 for proper thyroid production, thyroid function,

1:15:57.300 --> 1:16:00.160
 which is why I tend to eat a few Brazil nuts each day,

1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:02.720
 typically with my lunch or sometimes before my workout,

1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:03.820
 doesn't really matter.

1:16:05.420 --> 1:16:10.420
 The point is that the volume, the amount, the content,

1:16:10.420 --> 1:16:14.420
 and indeed the ratios of protein to fat to carbohydrates

1:16:14.420 --> 1:16:15.900
 are going to impact how you feel,

1:16:15.900 --> 1:16:18.260
 and they're going to impact your brain health.

1:16:18.260 --> 1:16:19.600
 And of course, the timing.

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:22.520
 We know that allowing periods of 12 hours or more

1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:24.980
 each 24-hour cycle where you're not ingesting anything

1:16:24.980 --> 1:16:26.700
 is beneficial for your brain and body health.

1:16:26.700 --> 1:16:29.640
 That's what Sachin Panda and his colleagues' work

1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:33.020
 has shown over and over again in these quality studies.

1:16:33.020 --> 1:16:36.980
 So when people ask me, what should I eat for my brain?

1:16:36.980 --> 1:16:39.660
 More often than not, it's really a question

1:16:39.660 --> 1:16:41.140
 of how you're structuring your day,

1:16:41.140 --> 1:16:42.660
 when you're eating for the first time,

1:16:42.660 --> 1:16:44.400
 how long you're allowing yourself to fast

1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:49.020
 each 24-hour cycle, and also whether or not

1:16:49.020 --> 1:16:50.420
 you're getting sufficient omega-3s,

1:16:50.420 --> 1:16:52.900
 whether or not you're getting sufficient selenium

1:16:52.900 --> 1:16:55.420
 to support things like thyroid function,

1:16:55.420 --> 1:16:58.660
 which has an impact both on the metabolism of the body,

1:16:58.660 --> 1:17:00.420
 but also the metabolism in the brain.

1:17:00.420 --> 1:17:03.300
 And when I say metabolism, I don't just mean burning energy.

1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:06.440
 I actually mean the rebuilding of things.

1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:09.380
 So in the episode on growth hormone and thyroid hormone,

1:17:09.380 --> 1:17:13.680
 we talked about how metabolism means not just the breakdown

1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:16.060
 of fats and carbohydrates, but also the building up,

1:17:16.060 --> 1:17:19.240
 the repair of muscle tissue, the repair of bone,

1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:21.820
 the reinforcing of bone, and the repair

1:17:21.820 --> 1:17:23.940
 and the buildup of brain tissue.

1:17:23.940 --> 1:17:26.220
 And so those are the things that I emphasize

1:17:26.220 --> 1:17:28.080
 because they're so strongly supported

1:17:28.080 --> 1:17:33.080
 by the scientific data done in mice, studies done in humans.

1:17:33.580 --> 1:17:37.380
 And basically, there's a lot of biochemical evidence

1:17:37.380 --> 1:17:39.620
 that supports everything that I just described.

1:17:39.620 --> 1:17:42.200
 Along the lines of health and wellbeing,

1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:45.100
 I'd be remiss if I didn't mention hormones.

1:17:45.100 --> 1:17:48.340
 Hormones have broad effects on the body and brain.

1:17:48.340 --> 1:17:50.280
 We did an entire month on hormones.

1:17:50.280 --> 1:17:52.740
 If you want to hear about any of those hormones in detail,

1:17:52.740 --> 1:17:53.820
 we talked about testosterone

1:17:53.820 --> 1:17:56.320
 and optimizing testosterone, estrogen, et cetera.

1:17:57.700 --> 1:17:59.060
 The sex steroid hormones,

1:17:59.060 --> 1:18:02.500
 which include testosterone and estrogen,

1:18:02.500 --> 1:18:05.500
 which of course are present in varying ratios,

1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:09.900
 but in both men and women and in kids,

1:18:09.900 --> 1:18:12.500
 they are manufactured from cholesterol.

1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:14.360
 We hear about cholesterol as this terrible thing,

1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:16.160
 but they are actually made from cholesterol.

1:18:16.160 --> 1:18:19.820
 And so if you don't get sufficient levels of cholesterol,

1:18:19.820 --> 1:18:21.480
 that can be problematic for your hormones

1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:22.780
 and that can be problematic

1:18:22.780 --> 1:18:25.500
 for your brain and your body health.

1:18:25.500 --> 1:18:28.340
 So without going into too much detail,

1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:30.680
 I'll just point to a couple of things that I do

1:18:30.680 --> 1:18:33.300
 that at least from my blood work

1:18:33.300 --> 1:18:34.740
 and from my subjective experience

1:18:34.740 --> 1:18:36.140
 have been very beneficial for me

1:18:36.140 --> 1:18:38.860
 that some of you might want to consider.

1:18:38.860 --> 1:18:41.780
 First of all, I'm not shy about my love for butter.

1:18:41.780 --> 1:18:43.820
 I will eat pats of butter directly.

1:18:43.820 --> 1:18:46.140
 I believe if people are going to eat cheese

1:18:46.140 --> 1:18:48.840
 without a cracker, I will eat butter without a cracker.

1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:52.060
 Butter is high in cholesterol, so I don't eat a ton of it,

1:18:52.060 --> 1:18:55.200
 but at least for me and for my lipid profiles, it's fine.

1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:57.500
 Butter has cholesterol,

1:18:57.500 --> 1:18:59.620
 which is a precursor to the sex steroid hormones,

1:18:59.620 --> 1:19:03.320
 and men and women need testosterone and estrogen

1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:05.700
 in order to feel good and to be able to think.

1:19:05.700 --> 1:19:08.180
 You do not want your estrogen too low

1:19:08.180 --> 1:19:09.820
 or your testosterone too low.

1:19:09.820 --> 1:19:11.840
 So I eat butter in order to ensure

1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:13.100
 that I get sufficient cholesterol.

1:19:13.100 --> 1:19:15.920
 Butter also has some other things that are beneficial,

1:19:15.920 --> 1:19:19.700
 various small fatty acids that are interesting

1:19:19.700 --> 1:19:22.780
 in terms of their effects on metabolism, et cetera.

1:19:22.780 --> 1:19:24.860
 You can look those up, the benefits of butter,

1:19:24.860 --> 1:19:28.420
 but again, volume is important and you can't overdo it.

1:19:28.420 --> 1:19:30.580
 Costello incidentally loves butter as well.

1:19:30.580 --> 1:19:34.480
 Along the lines of hormones and testosterone,

1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:37.200
 I get a lot of questions about this, I think,

1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:39.060
 because a lot of online communities

1:19:39.060 --> 1:19:40.840
 are sort of obsessed with testosterone.

1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:43.520
 And I just want to emphasize that, yes,

1:19:43.520 --> 1:19:46.040
 having sufficient levels of testosterone

1:19:46.040 --> 1:19:48.360
 is vitally important for brain function

1:19:48.360 --> 1:19:50.560
 and having sufficient levels of estrogen

1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:53.120
 will allow your brain to actually function.

1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:56.340
 It turns out that estrogen is one of the main ways

1:19:56.340 --> 1:19:59.420
 in which the brain maintains longevity

1:19:59.420 --> 1:20:01.540
 and maintains its ability to think.

1:20:01.540 --> 1:20:04.820
 So we should all be seeking optimal testosterone levels

1:20:04.820 --> 1:20:08.260
 for ourselves, both testosterone and estrogen.

1:20:08.260 --> 1:20:11.440
 And many of the things that we've discussed up until now,

1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:15.440
 morning sunlight, exercise, fasting,

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:18.640
 those can support testosterone and estrogen

1:20:18.640 --> 1:20:21.700
 in meaningful and positive ways.

1:20:21.700 --> 1:20:24.440
 I get a lot of questions about hormone optimization.

1:20:24.440 --> 1:20:26.760
 We did an entire month on this topic.

1:20:26.760 --> 1:20:29.260
 We did an entire episode on testosterone

1:20:29.260 --> 1:20:31.400
 and estrogen optimization.

1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:34.200
 I just want to briefly highlight two things

1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:35.600
 that could be relevant.

1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:36.780
 And then if you want more details,

1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:37.920
 please go see that episode.

1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:40.720
 The first is that testosterone

1:20:40.720 --> 1:20:42.640
 can exert its various functions

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:46.420
 only in its unbound form, free testosterone.

1:20:46.420 --> 1:20:49.460
 We all make a particular binding protein

1:20:49.460 --> 1:20:51.860
 called sex hormone binding globulin

1:20:51.860 --> 1:20:53.680
 that essentially binds up testosterone,

1:20:53.680 --> 1:20:55.320
 prevents it from being free.

1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:56.460
 This sounds like a terrible thing,

1:20:56.460 --> 1:20:57.300
 but actually it's a good thing

1:20:57.300 --> 1:20:59.420
 because it allows testosterone to be transported

1:20:59.420 --> 1:21:01.300
 to the various tissues, including the brain,

1:21:01.300 --> 1:21:03.980
 where it can exert its various functions.

1:21:05.740 --> 1:21:10.420
 For those that have lower than desired levels of testosterone

1:21:10.420 --> 1:21:12.900
 or too much sex hormone binding globulin,

1:21:12.900 --> 1:21:15.120
 it turns out that 400 milligrams per day

1:21:15.120 --> 1:21:16.900
 of something called tongat ali,

1:21:16.900 --> 1:21:17.980
 which is a form of ginseng,

1:21:17.980 --> 1:21:21.140
 can actually help increase levels of free testosterone.

1:21:21.140 --> 1:21:23.900
 Many people experience a positive subjective effect

1:21:23.900 --> 1:21:26.180
 and some objective effects as well,

1:21:26.180 --> 1:21:28.160
 meaning increases in free testosterone

1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:29.900
 when they do blood analysis.

1:21:30.980 --> 1:21:32.120
 There are some data on that,

1:21:32.120 --> 1:21:34.060
 not a ton in the peer-reviewed literatures.

1:21:34.060 --> 1:21:37.800
 And again, always approach these with a sense of caution

1:21:37.800 --> 1:21:39.880
 and definitely talk to your doctor.

1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:41.100
 If you want to learn more about that,

1:21:41.100 --> 1:21:42.420
 you can go to examine.com.

1:21:42.420 --> 1:21:45.060
 There's a lot of information there listed about that.

1:21:45.060 --> 1:21:48.180
 The other compound that's relevant both to men and women,

1:21:48.180 --> 1:21:50.020
 or I should say people that are trying to optimize

1:21:50.020 --> 1:21:52.620
 testosterone and or estrogen is Fidogia.

1:21:52.620 --> 1:21:56.900
 Fidogia agrestis is actually an herb that increases

1:21:56.900 --> 1:21:58.700
 the levels of what's called luteinizing hormone.

1:21:58.700 --> 1:22:00.580
 Luteinizing hormone is a hormone that's released

1:22:00.580 --> 1:22:02.900
 from the hypothalamus within the brain

1:22:02.900 --> 1:22:06.240
 that travels to the gonads,

1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:07.980
 either the ovaries or the testes,

1:22:07.980 --> 1:22:12.560
 to stimulate the release of estrogen or testosterone.

1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:14.940
 And Fidogia agrestis has been shown,

1:22:14.940 --> 1:22:16.520
 albeit in a limited number of studies,

1:22:16.520 --> 1:22:18.280
 to increase levels of luteinizing hormone

1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:20.260
 and thereby levels of testosterone and estrogen

1:22:20.260 --> 1:22:22.980
 in ways that some people find beneficial.

1:22:22.980 --> 1:22:24.160
 So I just want to mention those two.

1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:25.900
 And again, if you want a lot more information

1:22:25.900 --> 1:22:27.720
 about hormone optimization,

1:22:27.720 --> 1:22:30.220
 please see the episodes on hormone optimization.

1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:34.560
 A key aspect to the midday meal,

1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:36.980
 if you want that meal to benefit you,

1:22:36.980 --> 1:22:39.500
 is to take a brief walk afterwards.

1:22:39.500 --> 1:22:42.380
 It turns out that brief walks of five to 30 minutes

1:22:42.380 --> 1:22:45.300
 after ingesting food can accelerate metabolism

1:22:45.300 --> 1:22:49.380
 and actually can accelerate and improve nutrient utilization

1:22:49.380 --> 1:22:51.060
 which is essentially the same as metabolism.

1:22:51.060 --> 1:22:53.860
 But nonetheless, that's something that I do

1:22:53.860 --> 1:22:55.780
 after I finish my noon meal.

1:22:55.780 --> 1:22:59.660
 I do force myself to stand up and go outside

1:22:59.660 --> 1:23:00.620
 and take a brief walk.

1:23:00.620 --> 1:23:02.620
 That also gets me again into optic flow.

1:23:02.620 --> 1:23:03.820
 It also has another benefit,

1:23:03.820 --> 1:23:06.260
 which is that I am giving my brain

1:23:06.260 --> 1:23:09.340
 and thereby my body more information

1:23:09.340 --> 1:23:10.580
 about light and time of day,

1:23:10.580 --> 1:23:12.740
 which is always better than less information

1:23:12.740 --> 1:23:14.200
 about light and time of day.

1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:17.920
 Much of our circadian rhythm and our health rhythms

1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:20.540
 and all of our cognitive rhythms, et cetera,

1:23:20.540 --> 1:23:25.080
 are supported by our cells knowing where they are in time.

1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:27.460
 And light is the primary zeitgeber,

1:23:27.460 --> 1:23:29.200
 that's German for timekeeper,

1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:33.980
 is the primary way in which the body learns information

1:23:33.980 --> 1:23:36.620
 or about what function should be turned on

1:23:36.620 --> 1:23:38.220
 and what function should be turned off.

1:23:38.220 --> 1:23:39.500
 So getting that morning light pulse,

1:23:39.500 --> 1:23:42.380
 but then also leaving the house or apartment or workplace

1:23:42.380 --> 1:23:43.980
 and getting out for a few minutes after lunch

1:23:43.980 --> 1:23:45.600
 is beneficial for metabolism,

1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:47.700
 beneficial for nutrient utilization,

1:23:47.700 --> 1:23:51.460
 and beneficial for all the organs and tissues of the body

1:23:51.460 --> 1:23:54.220
 because you're getting that outside light exposure.

1:23:54.220 --> 1:23:55.500
 Now I'd like to shift our attention

1:23:55.500 --> 1:23:57.920
 towards science-supported protocols

1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:00.180
 that increase the effectiveness

1:24:00.180 --> 1:24:02.460
 and our performance in everything.

1:24:02.460 --> 1:24:04.320
 And by everything, I mean sleep,

1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:08.160
 I mean physical performance, I mean mental performance,

1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:12.740
 I mean less anxiety, all the things, truly all the things.

1:24:12.740 --> 1:24:16.980
 And that is something called non-sleep deep rest.

1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:19.760
 Non-sleep deep rest or NSDR

1:24:19.760 --> 1:24:22.940
 is an acronym that I coined as an umbrella term

1:24:22.940 --> 1:24:25.760
 to encompass many protocols

1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:29.100
 that all have been shown in one form or another

1:24:29.100 --> 1:24:32.300
 to support better brain and body function.

1:24:32.300 --> 1:24:34.920
 Now these protocols have names that you've heard before,

1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:38.460
 things like meditation, things like yoga nidra,

1:24:38.460 --> 1:24:40.060
 and things like hypnosis.

1:24:41.260 --> 1:24:44.160
 All of these protocols and these activities, however,

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:45.360
 share something in common,

1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:48.840
 which is they involve a deliberate

1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:51.720
 and directed shift in one's state,

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:54.520
 and the shift tends to be toward a state

1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:56.160
 of deeper relaxation.

1:24:57.240 --> 1:24:58.540
 We certainly don't have time now

1:24:58.540 --> 1:25:01.000
 to dissect out the literature on all of these.

1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:02.800
 There is ample literature,

1:25:02.800 --> 1:25:05.480
 I should say there is robust and ample literature

1:25:05.480 --> 1:25:08.040
 supporting the fact that a regular meditation practice

1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:10.960
 is beneficial, but meditation itself has many forms,

1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:14.400
 transcendental meditation, loving kindness meditation,

1:25:14.400 --> 1:25:16.780
 third eye meditation, walking meditation.

1:25:16.780 --> 1:25:19.100
 Yoga nidra is a practice I've talked about

1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:21.580
 many times before, which involves simply lying down.

1:25:21.580 --> 1:25:22.600
 It doesn't involve any movement,

1:25:22.600 --> 1:25:24.200
 no down dogs or up dogs or anything.

1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:26.080
 It just involves lying on your back

1:25:26.080 --> 1:25:28.440
 and doing some specific long exhale breathing.

1:25:28.440 --> 1:25:30.040
 There are a lot of yoga nidra scripts out there

1:25:30.040 --> 1:25:31.780
 that are quite good,

1:25:31.780 --> 1:25:35.960
 but there's one NSDR type protocol

1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:39.440
 that has been shown by the greatest number

1:25:39.440 --> 1:25:41.980
 of scientific studies to promote not just states

1:25:41.980 --> 1:25:46.360
 of deep relaxation, not just states of heightened focus,

1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:49.140
 but also to accelerate plasticity

1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:52.080
 and learning within the brain, and that's hypnosis.

1:25:52.080 --> 1:25:53.880
 And I've become increasingly excited

1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:57.200
 and interested in hypnosis as a tool,

1:25:57.200 --> 1:25:59.680
 and not just a tool of any kind,

1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:01.600
 but a tool that really can be directed

1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:03.760
 toward particular goals and outcomes.

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:06.300
 And I think that's really what sets hypnosis apart

1:26:06.300 --> 1:26:08.920
 as an NSDR, non-sleep deep breath protocol,

1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:12.080
 from things like naps or things like yoga nidra

1:26:12.080 --> 1:26:13.960
 or things like meditation.

1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:16.400
 And I certainly believe and understand

1:26:16.400 --> 1:26:18.080
 that meditation naps and yoga nidra

1:26:18.080 --> 1:26:21.760
 can be directed toward less anxiety, et cetera,

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:26.760
 but hypnosis is unique in that it's very directed.

1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:30.520
 The essence of hypnosis is for the person,

1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:32.240
 you, to guide your brain toward

1:26:32.240 --> 1:26:35.020
 a particular outcome or change.

1:26:35.020 --> 1:26:36.940
 So I'd like to point out a particular resource.

1:26:36.940 --> 1:26:40.720
 It's a completely zero cost resource, which is reveri.com.

1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:43.440
 That's R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:46.580
 Reveri.com obviously is a website

1:26:46.580 --> 1:26:48.160
 where there are links to an app

1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:50.280
 that's available in Apple and Android.

1:26:50.280 --> 1:26:51.620
 This is a hypnosis app,

1:26:51.620 --> 1:26:53.200
 but this isn't just any hypnosis app.

1:26:53.200 --> 1:26:54.720
 This is a hypnosis app

1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:58.160
 that contains multiple hypnosis protocols

1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:01.040
 that are all backed by very high quality science.

1:27:01.040 --> 1:27:03.160
 The science was done by my colleague

1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:04.720
 and our associate chair of psychiatry

1:27:04.720 --> 1:27:05.920
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

1:27:05.920 --> 1:27:08.440
 That's David Spiegel is responsible for that work.

1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:11.720
 I'm not associated with that scientific work.

1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:14.440
 They've examined what brain areas

1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:16.240
 get activated during hypnosis,

1:27:16.240 --> 1:27:19.520
 what the outcomes are for various hypnosis protocols.

1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:21.840
 And within Reveri, you will find hypnosis protocols

1:27:21.840 --> 1:27:24.800
 for enhancing your focus, enhancing creativity,

1:27:24.800 --> 1:27:28.600
 reducing pain, getting better at sleeping, reducing anxiety.

1:27:28.600 --> 1:27:31.660
 Most of these are about 10 or 15 minutes long.

1:27:31.660 --> 1:27:34.080
 Some of them are extremely brief, one minute long.

1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:36.600
 They have a one minute hypnosis that you can do.

1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:38.920
 Those one minute hypnosis scripts work best

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:41.560
 if you've been doing the 10 and 15 minute ones

1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:43.920
 regularly or semi-regularly.

1:27:43.920 --> 1:27:45.560
 It's a really wonderful resource

1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:48.980
 for which there is a lot of peer-reviewed published data.

1:27:49.980 --> 1:27:52.500
 One study I'd like to emphasize in particular

1:27:52.500 --> 1:27:55.360
 is Jiang et al, J-I-A-N-G.

1:27:55.360 --> 1:27:57.520
 That is a reference you can find

1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:00.600
 on the Reveri.com website under our research.

1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:01.920
 And the title of this paper is

1:28:01.920 --> 1:28:04.120
 Brain Activity and Functional Connectivity Associated

1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:05.400
 with Hypnosis, and it was published

1:28:05.400 --> 1:28:07.020
 in the journal Cerebral Cortex.

1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:12.280
 What this paper essentially shows is that specific areas

1:28:12.280 --> 1:28:14.840
 of our brain that are involved in executive function,

1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:16.800
 which is associated with our ability to focus,

1:28:16.800 --> 1:28:19.400
 as well as what's called the default mode network,

1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:21.320
 which is sort of the way that your brain idles.

1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:23.280
 Does your brain tend to idle

1:28:23.280 --> 1:28:26.760
 at a level of high anxiety or calm,

1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:29.820
 as well as activation of a brain area called the insula.

1:28:29.820 --> 1:28:31.380
 That's I-N-S-U-L-A.

1:28:31.380 --> 1:28:33.240
 The insula is extremely interesting.

1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:35.880
 Hypnosis has been shown to activate the insula,

1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:38.360
 which can enhance our sense of interoception,

1:28:38.360 --> 1:28:40.320
 our sense of internal state,

1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:42.260
 which might sound like a annoying thing.

1:28:42.260 --> 1:28:44.480
 You don't want to be thinking about your heartbeat

1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:45.480
 or your breathing.

1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:47.880
 But what's really interesting about hypnosis

1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:49.840
 is that it increases areas of the brain

1:28:49.840 --> 1:28:51.780
 that are responsible for deep relaxation,

1:28:51.780 --> 1:28:54.200
 focus, and self-awareness,

1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:56.760
 this interoception, simultaneously.

1:28:56.760 --> 1:29:00.160
 And that's very unusual compared to other states,

1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:02.200
 any other states of any kind.

1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:05.480
 So I've made it a practice, a daily practice, in fact,

1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:07.960
 that after lunch and after this walk,

1:29:07.960 --> 1:29:10.960
 I do a brief 10-minute hypnosis script

1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:14.960
 because of what I found is that in contrast to naps

1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:17.200
 and in contrast to other forms of NSDR,

1:29:17.200 --> 1:29:20.480
 it really allows me to enter a state of deep relaxation,

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:23.220
 but also to then exit that state

1:29:23.220 --> 1:29:25.000
 in a very focused and deliberate way

1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:28.040
 that allows me to lean into my afternoon in an alert way,

1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:30.960
 in a way that I can function and do mental work

1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:33.400
 and interact with people, et cetera.

1:29:33.400 --> 1:29:35.880
 So there's no brain fog, there's no grogginess.

1:29:35.880 --> 1:29:37.600
 And I want to emphasize that the hypnosis

1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:40.860
 that I'm referring to here and that Reverie provides

1:29:40.860 --> 1:29:43.080
 is not stage hypnosis.

1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:45.640
 This isn't you being programmed to squawk like a chicken

1:29:45.640 --> 1:29:46.800
 or do anything against your will.

1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:49.320
 This is you teaching your brain how to access

1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:52.500
 these focused, relaxed, interoceptive states.

1:29:52.500 --> 1:29:56.040
 This is also an extremely valuable aspect to hypnosis

1:29:56.040 --> 1:29:58.760
 because it can increase plasticity,

1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:01.120
 the brain's ability to change in response to experience.

1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:02.960
 It's essentially opening up pathways

1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:04.980
 that allow you to change your brain

1:30:04.980 --> 1:30:06.480
 in the ways that you want.

1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:09.880
 And it's very directed toward particular outcomes.

1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:12.160
 So I am an, as you can probably tell,

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:15.360
 I'm very enthusiastic about hypnosis

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:17.480
 as an optimal NSDR protocol.

1:30:17.480 --> 1:30:19.480
 And so I do that every single day.

1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:21.260
 There are days that I don't manage to do it

1:30:21.260 --> 1:30:22.840
 for whatever reason, I forget,

1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:25.540
 or interference from email or et cetera,

1:30:25.540 --> 1:30:28.760
 but that is essentially how I enter my early afternoon.

1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:33.560
 I do this post-lunch, post-walk NSDR

1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:35.540
 in the form of a Reverie hypnosis.

1:30:35.540 --> 1:30:39.440
 Again, a completely zero-cost resource to you.

1:30:39.440 --> 1:30:40.920
 There are excellent data.

1:30:40.920 --> 1:30:43.840
 All those data can be found on the Reverie site.

1:30:43.840 --> 1:30:45.920
 And you can also learn a lot more about hypnosis

1:30:45.920 --> 1:30:48.040
 and what sorts of hypnosis protocols

1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:49.620
 might be optimal for you.

1:30:49.620 --> 1:30:52.800
 So if you are looking for a science-backed, zero-cost,

1:30:52.800 --> 1:30:56.120
 very effective tool for getting better at focusing,

1:30:56.120 --> 1:30:57.420
 better at sleeping,

1:30:57.420 --> 1:31:00.120
 better at all the things that I believe people want,

1:31:00.120 --> 1:31:01.880
 I do believe that is the best tool

1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:03.980
 that one can access at this point in time.

1:31:03.980 --> 1:31:06.840
 So then after I exit hypnosis,

1:31:06.840 --> 1:31:09.140
 usually give Costell a little scratch behind the ear,

1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:11.060
 and then I make sure that I hydrate.

1:31:12.120 --> 1:31:15.800
 Hydration, again, is vitally important for brain function.

1:31:15.800 --> 1:31:18.120
 It's vitally important for all bodily functions.

1:31:18.120 --> 1:31:19.720
 And I often forget to do it.

1:31:19.720 --> 1:31:23.240
 So I've just sort of linked the drinking of water

1:31:23.240 --> 1:31:25.000
 to my hypnosis practice.

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:26.600
 As soon as I'm done, I hydrate,

1:31:26.600 --> 1:31:30.440
 and then I tend to focus on another work bout.

1:31:30.440 --> 1:31:31.800
 So this would be, for me,

1:31:31.800 --> 1:31:34.600
 sometime around 2.30 or three o'clock in the afternoon,

1:31:34.600 --> 1:31:37.520
 when normally I would be quite sleepy and passing out.

1:31:37.520 --> 1:31:41.080
 However, the protocol of shifting my morning caffeine

1:31:41.080 --> 1:31:43.520
 to 90 minutes, two hours after waking,

1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:46.280
 as well as the use of this hypnosis protocol

1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:49.020
 has really allowed me to move through the afternoon

1:31:49.020 --> 1:31:51.880
 in a way that I don't experience that dip in energy.

1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:52.960
 Every once in a while,

1:31:52.960 --> 1:31:54.700
 I'll feel kind of sleepy or kind of out of it,

1:31:54.700 --> 1:31:59.640
 but I've been really pleasantly surprised

1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:02.000
 at the extent to which one can avoid that afternoon dip

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:03.800
 if you do certain things properly

1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:06.880
 prior to the arrival of two or three p.m.

1:32:06.880 --> 1:32:09.880
 Now, if you're a napper and you want to nap, no big deal.

1:32:10.780 --> 1:32:12.760
 Naps can be wonderfully beneficial.

1:32:12.760 --> 1:32:14.320
 Here are the rules around napping

1:32:14.320 --> 1:32:15.560
 according to the sleep science.

1:32:15.560 --> 1:32:17.120
 Stanford has an excellent sleep clinic.

1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:19.120
 I consulted with Jamie Zeitzer,

1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:22.420
 my colleague in the Stanford Sleep Laboratory,

1:32:22.420 --> 1:32:24.620
 as well as Matt Walker out at Berkeley,

1:32:24.620 --> 1:32:26.800
 whose name I'm sure most of you are familiar with,

1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:29.020
 wrote this wonderful book, Why We Sleep.

1:32:29.020 --> 1:32:32.240
 Naps should be 90 minutes or less,

1:32:32.240 --> 1:32:34.460
 and 20-minute naps are fine,

1:32:34.460 --> 1:32:36.120
 but not longer than 90 minutes.

1:32:36.120 --> 1:32:38.560
 And there are essentially two varieties of people,

1:32:38.560 --> 1:32:40.720
 people for whom napping interferes

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:44.960
 with falling asleep later that night and staying asleep,

1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:47.560
 and people for whom the nap does not interfere.

1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:49.160
 You have to decide who you are,

1:32:49.160 --> 1:32:51.660
 and if you're somebody who can nap

1:32:51.660 --> 1:32:54.460
 and not have any trouble falling asleep and staying asleep

1:32:54.460 --> 1:32:56.600
 later that night, well, by all means, nap.

1:32:56.600 --> 1:32:57.860
 Just make it 90 minutes or less.

1:32:57.860 --> 1:33:00.860
 Again, these 90-minute cycles are really a vital constraint

1:33:00.860 --> 1:33:02.480
 that we should all obey.

1:33:02.480 --> 1:33:04.320
 If it's 91 minutes, don't worry.

1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:05.940
 You won't dissolve into a puddle of tears,

1:33:05.940 --> 1:33:06.920
 but if you're starting to sleep

1:33:06.920 --> 1:33:08.680
 for an hour or more in the afternoon,

1:33:08.680 --> 1:33:10.120
 that can be problematic.

1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:14.240
 If you're somebody who can nap for 10, 20 minutes,

1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:17.380
 that's probably better than getting a full 90-minute cycle

1:33:17.380 --> 1:33:19.940
 unless you didn't get enough sleep the night before.

1:33:19.940 --> 1:33:21.800
 But you really have to figure out what's right for you.

1:33:21.800 --> 1:33:22.840
 There's a lot of variety there,

1:33:22.840 --> 1:33:25.320
 but that's essentially what the science says.

1:33:25.320 --> 1:33:27.040
 Now, whether or not you nap or whether or not

1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:31.080
 you do not nap, a key protocol for sleep health

1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:34.360
 and wakefulness and metabolism and hormone health

1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:37.520
 is viewing light in the afternoon.

1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:39.320
 So here's the reason for doing this.

1:33:40.520 --> 1:33:43.580
 As we progress into the evening hours,

1:33:43.580 --> 1:33:46.080
 there's a phenomenon where our retina,

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:49.360
 our eyes become very sensitive to light

1:33:49.360 --> 1:33:52.560
 such that if we view bright lights

1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:54.760
 or even not so bright lights

1:33:54.760 --> 1:33:58.600
 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,

1:33:58.600 --> 1:34:01.000
 that is strongly disruptive,

1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.860
 very disruptive for our dopamine production.

1:34:04.860 --> 1:34:06.960
 It can really screw up our sleep.

1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:09.040
 And it's actually been shown in data

1:34:09.040 --> 1:34:11.840
 from David Berson's lab at Brown University,

1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:14.560
 one of the foremost circadian biology laboratories,

1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:16.520
 as well as Sameer Tarr's laboratory

1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:19.240
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health,

1:34:19.240 --> 1:34:22.880
 that viewing bright light or even not so bright light

1:34:22.880 --> 1:34:25.640
 between these hours of 11 p.m. and 4 a.m.

1:34:25.640 --> 1:34:29.360
 or even 10 p.m. and 4 a.m. can disrupt learning and memory,

1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:31.120
 can disrupt the immune system,

1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:34.180
 and can disrupt mood in very long-lasting ways.

1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:38.160
 There are ways to offset that, however,

1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:41.200
 what I call your Netflix inoculation.

1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:43.360
 For those of you that like to stay up late on the tablet

1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:45.720
 or computer or watching Netflix,

1:34:45.720 --> 1:34:49.080
 getting a little bit of afternoon light in your eyes

1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:54.080
 somewhat counterintuitively can prevent this disruption

1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:57.800
 of bright light later in the evening at least somewhat.

1:34:57.800 --> 1:34:59.160
 What do I mean by that?

1:34:59.160 --> 1:35:03.480
 Well, if you view light as the sun is starting to go down,

1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:06.100
 so if you step outside around 4 p.m., 5 p.m.,

1:35:06.100 --> 1:35:08.920
 again, what time exactly will depend on time of year

1:35:08.920 --> 1:35:11.440
 and where you are located on our planet,

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:14.140
 but as the sun starts to head down,

1:35:14.140 --> 1:35:16.000
 you don't necessarily have to see the sunset.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:17.880
 It'd be lovely if you could.

1:35:17.880 --> 1:35:20.700
 Sunsets are beautiful, but if you can get outside

1:35:20.700 --> 1:35:23.240
 and see the sun as it arcs down

1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:24.720
 or if you can't see the sun directly,

1:35:24.720 --> 1:35:28.420
 get some sunlight in your eyes in the afternoon hours,

1:35:28.420 --> 1:35:32.160
 so maybe 4 p.m.-ish, and do that for 20, 30 minutes,

1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:34.800
 maybe reading outside or taking a walk.

1:35:34.800 --> 1:35:35.900
 I walk the dog again.

1:35:35.900 --> 1:35:38.360
 That's my protocol in order to get that evening light.

1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:43.260
 What it does is it lowers the sensitivity of your retina

1:35:43.260 --> 1:35:44.800
 in the late evening hours,

1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:47.600
 which allows you to buffer yourself

1:35:47.600 --> 1:35:50.740
 against the negative effects of bright light later at night.

1:35:50.740 --> 1:35:52.320
 Now, it won't allow you

1:35:52.320 --> 1:35:54.100
 to blast your eyes with bright light.

1:35:54.100 --> 1:35:56.520
 You still need to dim the lights in the evening,

1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:58.960
 but there's a very nice study that was published

1:35:58.960 --> 1:36:02.160
 in Scientific Reports that illustrates

1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:06.220
 that if one does this, if you go outside and view sunlight

1:36:06.220 --> 1:36:10.320
 in the evening hours for anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes,

1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:12.400
 and I realize that people have a range

1:36:12.400 --> 1:36:14.640
 of constraints on their schedule,

1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:16.760
 but from 5 to 30 minutes,

1:36:16.760 --> 1:36:19.640
 what happens is that your melatonin rhythm

1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:20.980
 stays appropriate.

1:36:20.980 --> 1:36:22.640
 Now, we haven't talked too much about melatonin,

1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:27.140
 but melatonin is a hormone that is inhibited by light.

1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:29.320
 It's actually prevented by light,

1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:31.600
 and melatonin is the hormone

1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:33.980
 that allows you to fall asleep easily.

1:36:33.980 --> 1:36:36.260
 Now, I'm not talking about supplementing melatonin.

1:36:36.260 --> 1:36:38.080
 I'm talking about melatonin

1:36:38.080 --> 1:36:40.560
 that you naturally produce from your pineal.

1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:42.640
 So the protocol is very simple.

1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:45.040
 Get outside in the afternoon or evening

1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:46.800
 for 10 to 30 minutes.

1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:49.420
 Take your sunglasses off, get some bright light,

1:36:49.420 --> 1:36:50.840
 get some natural light in your eyes.

1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:54.760
 If you can't do that, probably better to just stay

1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:57.440
 with standard artificial lights inside.

1:36:57.440 --> 1:37:00.800
 Don't crank them up, but just start to dim them.

1:37:00.800 --> 1:37:03.740
 Again, this would be a time to avoid blue blockers.

1:37:03.740 --> 1:37:05.140
 People are popping on blue blockers

1:37:05.140 --> 1:37:06.280
 at four o'clock in the afternoon

1:37:06.280 --> 1:37:07.360
 because you're worried that blue light

1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:08.520
 is going to disrupt your sleep.

1:37:08.520 --> 1:37:11.140
 Well, you're making your eyes more sensitive

1:37:11.140 --> 1:37:13.500
 to any light that you might see later in the evening,

1:37:13.500 --> 1:37:15.120
 blue light or otherwise.

1:37:15.120 --> 1:37:16.940
 So get that afternoon light.

1:37:16.940 --> 1:37:20.440
 So what you'll probably notice is that the optimal protocols

1:37:20.440 --> 1:37:23.080
 for optimizing your brain and body health

1:37:23.080 --> 1:37:25.160
 and performance and sleep, et cetera,

1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:27.280
 are actually really simple.

1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:28.480
 But just because they're simple

1:37:28.480 --> 1:37:30.900
 does not mean that they are not powerful.

1:37:30.900 --> 1:37:32.160
 In fact, they are very powerful

1:37:32.160 --> 1:37:35.360
 because they leverage the most powerful technology

1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:37.640
 that exists, which is your nervous system.

1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:40.320
 We always think about technologies as devices,

1:37:40.320 --> 1:37:42.640
 and indeed there are some wonderful devices out there.

1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:44.640
 Some people are really into tracking their sleep

1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:45.560
 and their sleep time.

1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:46.440
 If you're into that, great.

1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:48.220
 That's not something that I personally do,

1:37:48.220 --> 1:37:51.560
 although I keep telling myself that I should do that.

1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:54.480
 There are devices that can control brain waves

1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:55.320
 and things of that sort.

1:37:55.320 --> 1:37:56.960
 But what we are talking about today

1:37:56.960 --> 1:38:00.440
 are really basic things that we can all do

1:38:00.440 --> 1:38:03.200
 that can steer our neurology and our biology

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:06.720
 in the directions that are going to support workflow,

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:08.040
 that are going to support hormones,

1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:10.480
 that are going to support brain function.

1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:13.640
 So this afternoon light viewing is yet another example

1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:16.760
 of leveraging a technology that you were born with

1:38:16.760 --> 1:38:17.760
 and that you will die with

1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:20.360
 and that you will have every day in between

1:38:20.360 --> 1:38:24.300
 in order to tweak the hormones of your system,

1:38:24.300 --> 1:38:26.080
 in this case, the hormone melatonin,

1:38:26.080 --> 1:38:28.000
 so that it's released at the appropriate times

1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:29.560
 and not at the wrong times.

1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:32.520
 Because we know that when hormones and systems of the body

1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:36.000
 are well aligned with the 24 hour schedule,

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.200
 beautiful things happen.

1:38:37.200 --> 1:38:39.800
 And when they are misaligned, terrible things happen.

1:38:39.800 --> 1:38:42.640
 Sometimes those terrible things are subtle at first,

1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:44.680
 but disrupting your circadian rhythms

1:38:44.680 --> 1:38:48.140
 is really bad for every system in your body.

1:38:48.140 --> 1:38:50.100
 Getting it right, and as you can tell,

1:38:50.100 --> 1:38:52.140
 getting it right doesn't take much,

1:38:52.140 --> 1:38:55.040
 can really serve to quote unquote optimize you.

1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:55.960
 When I say optimize,

1:38:55.960 --> 1:38:58.160
 I mean it puts you into a better mood overall,

1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:00.880
 better state for learning, et cetera.

1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:03.060
 So get that afternoon light as well.

1:39:03.060 --> 1:39:05.140
 So at some point in the evening,

1:39:05.140 --> 1:39:07.440
 I eat that thing that we call dinner.

1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:11.340
 And while it feels sort of strange to talk about my dinner,

1:39:11.340 --> 1:39:13.260
 the reason I want to talk about my dinner

1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:15.740
 and what I eat for dinner is that for me,

1:39:15.740 --> 1:39:18.120
 dinner of course is about eating.

1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:19.720
 I'll mention again, I love eating,

1:39:19.720 --> 1:39:24.560
 but also about optimizing the transition to sleep and sleep.

1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:27.100
 So obviously I eat foods that I enjoy.

1:39:27.100 --> 1:39:29.380
 I'm not one of these people that will eat anything

1:39:29.380 --> 1:39:34.380
 or avoid eating anything simply to benefit from that.

1:39:34.380 --> 1:39:36.400
 I do enjoy food very, very much.

1:39:36.400 --> 1:39:40.140
 And so my dinner generally is comprised of things

1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:43.200
 that are going to support rest and deep sleep.

1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:46.240
 And that means starchy carbohydrates.

1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:49.140
 It's absolutely clear that one of the major ways

1:39:49.140 --> 1:39:50.960
 that we can increase serotonin,

1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:52.960
 which helps in the transition to sleep,

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:56.140
 is by ingesting starchy carbohydrates.

1:39:56.140 --> 1:39:58.060
 Now, I realize that starchy carbohydrates

1:39:58.060 --> 1:40:00.300
 are kind of a demonized term nowadays,

1:40:00.300 --> 1:40:01.460
 and everyone's anti-carbs,

1:40:01.460 --> 1:40:05.860
 but we really should distinguish between refined sugars

1:40:05.860 --> 1:40:07.220
 and complex carbohydrates.

1:40:07.220 --> 1:40:08.580
 And we did an episode about this.

1:40:08.580 --> 1:40:10.100
 We talked about how refined sugars

1:40:10.100 --> 1:40:12.660
 disrupt not just metabolism,

1:40:12.660 --> 1:40:15.620
 but they actually disrupt some of the neurons in the gut

1:40:15.620 --> 1:40:17.840
 that sense fatty acids and amino acids

1:40:17.840 --> 1:40:19.220
 from fats and proteins.

1:40:19.220 --> 1:40:22.220
 But those same neurons can actually respond to sugar

1:40:22.220 --> 1:40:25.620
 and create a situation where you actually start craving

1:40:25.620 --> 1:40:28.500
 more sugar because those neurons in your gut

1:40:28.500 --> 1:40:31.860
 communicate via a nerve pathway for your aficionados

1:40:31.860 --> 1:40:33.740
 called the vagus nerve,

1:40:33.740 --> 1:40:36.140
 and a little cluster of neurons called the nodose ganglia,

1:40:36.140 --> 1:40:38.580
 N-O-D-O-S-E, nodose ganglia,

1:40:38.580 --> 1:40:41.540
 sort of right next to the corner of your jaw,

1:40:41.540 --> 1:40:43.020
 and can trigger the activation

1:40:43.020 --> 1:40:44.520
 and the release of dopamine in your brain,

1:40:44.520 --> 1:40:47.400
 which basically makes you crave more sugar

1:40:47.400 --> 1:40:49.260
 independent of how something tastes.

1:40:49.260 --> 1:40:50.420
 So when I say carbohydrates,

1:40:50.420 --> 1:40:53.340
 what I really mean is starchy carbohydrates,

1:40:53.340 --> 1:40:54.760
 non-refined sugars.

1:40:54.760 --> 1:40:59.100
 And in the episode about food and mood

1:40:59.100 --> 1:41:00.700
 and metabolism as well,

1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:02.980
 I referenced a really spectacular lecture

1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:04.240
 by Dr. Robert Lustig,

1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:06.540
 who's a pediatric endocrinologist at UCSF,

1:41:06.540 --> 1:41:09.940
 UC San Francisco, absolutely spectacular talk.

1:41:09.940 --> 1:41:11.660
 You can find it on YouTube easily,

1:41:11.660 --> 1:41:14.900
 where he talks about the science of refined sugars.

1:41:14.900 --> 1:41:18.100
 And this isn't in any kind of conspiracy or paranoid way.

1:41:18.100 --> 1:41:21.160
 This is really the medical and scientific literature.

1:41:21.160 --> 1:41:24.620
 So my dinner is carbohydrates and some protein.

1:41:24.620 --> 1:41:26.540
 So maybe some chicken or fish or something like that,

1:41:26.540 --> 1:41:27.460
 maybe some eggs,

1:41:27.460 --> 1:41:30.800
 or sometimes just pasta or just rice and vegetables.

1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:33.220
 And that's because I enjoy those foods,

1:41:33.220 --> 1:41:36.540
 but also because I want to increase

1:41:36.540 --> 1:41:38.020
 the amount of serotonin in my brain

1:41:38.020 --> 1:41:39.920
 so that I can actually fall asleep that night.

1:41:39.920 --> 1:41:41.980
 Many people who are on low carbohydrate diets

1:41:41.980 --> 1:41:44.380
 struggle with falling and staying asleep.

1:41:44.380 --> 1:41:46.380
 And that's because it's hard to achieve

1:41:46.380 --> 1:41:48.380
 heightened levels of serotonin,

1:41:48.380 --> 1:41:51.120
 which are necessary to enter sleep.

1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:53.740
 I should also mention that melatonin and serotonin

1:41:53.740 --> 1:41:55.280
 fall in the same pathway.

1:41:55.280 --> 1:41:58.760
 They are related hormones and neuromodulators.

1:41:58.760 --> 1:42:00.940
 We won't go into their biosynthesis now,

1:42:00.940 --> 1:42:02.720
 but essentially what we're talking about

1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:06.200
 is a system that's biasing us towards rest and relaxation,

1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:08.220
 as opposed to wakefulness.

1:42:08.220 --> 1:42:10.420
 You might ask, well, can't I just take serotonin?

1:42:10.420 --> 1:42:13.240
 Can't I just take 5-HTP or a precursor to serotonin

1:42:13.240 --> 1:42:14.080
 or tryptophan?

1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:15.620
 And indeed you can.

1:42:15.620 --> 1:42:17.480
 However, many people, including myself,

1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:19.380
 find that when they supplement with serotonin

1:42:19.380 --> 1:42:20.680
 in the evening or at night,

1:42:20.680 --> 1:42:24.140
 that can cause problems in the architecture

1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:26.260
 or the structure of sleep.

1:42:26.260 --> 1:42:27.900
 It can cause a lot of people, including me,

1:42:27.900 --> 1:42:29.660
 to fall asleep very fast,

1:42:29.660 --> 1:42:31.340
 sleep very deeply for three or four hours,

1:42:31.340 --> 1:42:33.660
 and then wake up and have a terrible time

1:42:33.660 --> 1:42:34.820
 falling back asleep.

1:42:34.820 --> 1:42:38.540
 And that effect, at least for me, can last several days.

1:42:38.540 --> 1:42:39.620
 It's really disruptive.

1:42:39.620 --> 1:42:41.860
 So I don't like to supplement with anything

1:42:41.860 --> 1:42:45.560
 that is directly dopamine or a precursor to dopamine

1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:48.060
 at any time or directly serotonin

1:42:48.060 --> 1:42:49.420
 or a precursor to serotonin.

1:42:49.420 --> 1:42:51.400
 Rather, there are other things that can enhance

1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:53.020
 the transition to sleep safely,

1:42:53.020 --> 1:42:54.700
 which we will talk about in a few minutes.

1:42:54.700 --> 1:42:57.580
 But the evening meal consists largely of carbohydrates

1:42:57.580 --> 1:43:02.580
 for that specific purpose of generating a sense of calm.

1:43:02.580 --> 1:43:04.380
 And of course, carbohydrates are delicious.

1:43:04.380 --> 1:43:06.980
 And because I'm doing some physical training,

1:43:06.980 --> 1:43:08.420
 and presumably you are as well,

1:43:08.420 --> 1:43:12.000
 I hope you are, because it's so beneficial to one's health,

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.740
 that's also going to replenish my glycogen stores,

1:43:14.740 --> 1:43:17.060
 which is one of the primary fuel sources

1:43:17.060 --> 1:43:19.140
 for moving one's muscles and moving around

1:43:19.140 --> 1:43:21.220
 and doing exercise, as well as for the brain

1:43:21.220 --> 1:43:22.620
 and for cognitive function.

1:43:22.620 --> 1:43:26.340
 So low carbohydrates throughout the 24-hour period

1:43:26.340 --> 1:43:28.380
 are not something that are attractive to me.

1:43:28.380 --> 1:43:30.780
 I realize that some people will do much better

1:43:30.780 --> 1:43:32.920
 on a low carbohydrate or even ketogenic diet,

1:43:32.920 --> 1:43:37.460
 but for me, and I do believe for most people,

1:43:37.460 --> 1:43:40.100
 creating a situation of maybe fasting

1:43:40.100 --> 1:43:42.500
 and then low carb or no carb diets

1:43:42.500 --> 1:43:45.180
 for states of alertness and focus

1:43:45.180 --> 1:43:46.660
 at one portion of the day,

1:43:46.660 --> 1:43:49.600
 and then ingesting starch carbohydrates

1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:52.420
 for sake of inducing rest and relaxation

1:43:52.420 --> 1:43:57.320
 is a at least scientifically rationally-based protocol.

1:43:57.320 --> 1:43:59.980
 It's grounded in real neurochemistry.

1:43:59.980 --> 1:44:03.060
 It's grounded in things that we can point to and say,

1:44:03.060 --> 1:44:08.060
 ah, this food substance, this thing can support my brain,

1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:10.340
 not directly because it's some magic substance

1:44:10.340 --> 1:44:13.740
 that's going to make all my neurons extremely robust,

1:44:13.740 --> 1:44:16.060
 but rather it's going to support sleep,

1:44:16.060 --> 1:44:18.440
 which is perhaps the foundation

1:44:18.440 --> 1:44:19.840
 of all mental and physical health.

1:44:19.840 --> 1:44:23.500
 In fact, we can point to sleep as the primary way

1:44:23.500 --> 1:44:25.380
 in which we can ensure our overall health,

1:44:25.380 --> 1:44:27.100
 including our brain health.

1:44:27.100 --> 1:44:30.340
 So let's talk about sleep and how to access sleep,

1:44:30.340 --> 1:44:31.780
 how to fall asleep easily,

1:44:31.780 --> 1:44:33.580
 and how to make sure that the sleep we have

1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:36.740
 is of sufficient duration and quality.

1:44:36.740 --> 1:44:39.900
 One way to do that is to leverage the drop in temperature

1:44:39.900 --> 1:44:42.980
 that's necessary to fall and stay asleep.

1:44:42.980 --> 1:44:46.780
 So as I mentioned earlier, in the early parts of the day

1:44:46.780 --> 1:44:49.980
 after waking, our body temperature is rising,

1:44:49.980 --> 1:44:51.140
 and that continues throughout the day.

1:44:51.140 --> 1:44:52.900
 And then sometime late in the afternoon,

1:44:52.900 --> 1:44:56.740
 our temperature peaks, and then it starts to drop.

1:44:56.740 --> 1:45:00.100
 That drop in temperature of one to three degrees

1:45:00.100 --> 1:45:01.520
 is vitally important for us

1:45:01.520 --> 1:45:03.320
 to be able to fall asleep easily.

1:45:04.180 --> 1:45:07.660
 One way that we can decrease our transition time into sleep

1:45:07.660 --> 1:45:10.580
 is to accelerate that drop in temperature.

1:45:10.580 --> 1:45:13.520
 And one way to accelerate that drop in temperature

1:45:13.520 --> 1:45:17.780
 somewhat counterintuitively is to use hot baths,

1:45:17.780 --> 1:45:21.160
 hot showers, or if you have access to one, a sauna.

1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:22.900
 Now, this is counterintuitive because you'd say,

1:45:22.900 --> 1:45:25.380
 well, hot baths, so it's going to heat me up.

1:45:25.380 --> 1:45:28.020
 But actually, if you are to get into a sauna

1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:30.700
 or a hot shower or a hot bath and then get out,

1:45:30.700 --> 1:45:33.660
 your body is going to engage particular mechanisms

1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:37.060
 for cooling itself off that are going to allow you

1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:38.780
 to drop your temperature more quickly

1:45:38.780 --> 1:45:40.660
 and fall asleep more easily.

1:45:40.660 --> 1:45:42.740
 And this is why many people find that falling asleep

1:45:42.740 --> 1:45:45.100
 after a nice hot shower or bath or sauna

1:45:45.100 --> 1:45:49.100
 is really, really easy and really terrific.

1:45:49.100 --> 1:45:50.660
 It's sort of a natural state

1:45:50.660 --> 1:45:53.700
 that follows hot baths, saunas, and showers.

1:45:53.700 --> 1:45:54.740
 So how would you do this?

1:45:54.740 --> 1:45:58.020
 Well, we did an entire episode on this topic as well,

1:45:58.020 --> 1:46:00.180
 the use of sauna for sake of growth hormone release.

1:46:00.180 --> 1:46:02.100
 If you want to check that out and all the details,

1:46:02.100 --> 1:46:05.940
 you can look at the episode on growth hormone.

1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:08.060
 You will experience a growth hormone release

1:46:08.060 --> 1:46:10.240
 from sauna, hot bath, and hot shower,

1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:12.540
 provided they're done for sufficient duration

1:46:12.540 --> 1:46:14.860
 and sufficiently high temperature.

1:46:14.860 --> 1:46:17.220
 For all the details of that, please go to that episode.

1:46:17.220 --> 1:46:18.140
 It's all laid out there.

1:46:18.140 --> 1:46:19.060
 It's all timestamped.

1:46:19.060 --> 1:46:21.860
 It's all captioned in English and Spanish, et cetera.

1:46:21.860 --> 1:46:23.340
 But basically what we're talking about

1:46:23.340 --> 1:46:25.380
 is 20 minutes in the sauna,

1:46:25.380 --> 1:46:27.120
 or if you're one of those folks

1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:29.060
 who's really chasing growth hormone release,

1:46:29.060 --> 1:46:30.280
 you could do 20 minutes,

1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:31.980
 then get out of the sauna for 10 minutes

1:46:31.980 --> 1:46:33.660
 and just cool off at room temperature

1:46:33.660 --> 1:46:35.940
 and then get back into the sauna, then get out,

1:46:35.940 --> 1:46:39.360
 and then shower or dry off and head to bed.

1:46:41.300 --> 1:46:43.660
 Shorter bouts of sauna will work also.

1:46:43.660 --> 1:46:46.180
 The longer bouts of sauna cooling, sauna cooling

1:46:46.180 --> 1:46:48.780
 have been shown to lead to huge increases in growth hormone.

1:46:48.780 --> 1:46:49.740
 And growth hormone, of course,

1:46:49.740 --> 1:46:51.720
 is involved both in muscle growth,

1:46:51.720 --> 1:46:54.860
 but also growth and metabolism of all tissues,

1:46:54.860 --> 1:46:57.640
 fat metabolism, and repair of various tissues.

1:46:57.640 --> 1:46:58.860
 So it's not just about growth.

1:46:58.860 --> 1:47:00.780
 You hear growth hormone, you think hypertrophy,

1:47:00.780 --> 1:47:03.440
 but the enhancement of metabolism and health and repair

1:47:03.440 --> 1:47:05.040
 in a number of tissues.

1:47:05.040 --> 1:47:07.660
 So that's one way you can leverage heat

1:47:07.660 --> 1:47:09.640
 toward the transition to sleep

1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:11.780
 by the ways in which exposure to heat

1:47:11.780 --> 1:47:14.040
 actually cools off your body.

1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:15.980
 Now let's talk about actually getting to sleep.

1:47:15.980 --> 1:47:18.840
 And let's talk about behavioral protocols first.

1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:21.780
 It is absolutely true that keeping the room very dark

1:47:21.780 --> 1:47:22.620
 is beneficial.

1:47:22.620 --> 1:47:25.060
 Some people, including myself, have thin eyelids,

1:47:25.060 --> 1:47:26.620
 and it doesn't take much light

1:47:26.620 --> 1:47:28.780
 to wake up the brain and body.

1:47:28.780 --> 1:47:31.260
 So keeping a room very dark is essential.

1:47:31.260 --> 1:47:33.220
 The other thing is keeping the room cool.

1:47:33.220 --> 1:47:34.440
 You've probably heard this before.

1:47:34.440 --> 1:47:37.660
 Keep the room cool, get under warm blankets.

1:47:37.660 --> 1:47:38.920
 But rarely is it discussed

1:47:38.920 --> 1:47:41.700
 why keeping the room cool is useful.

1:47:41.700 --> 1:47:44.500
 The reason keeping the room cool is useful

1:47:44.500 --> 1:47:46.660
 for getting into and staying asleep

1:47:46.660 --> 1:47:48.920
 is that throughout the night,

1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:51.220
 there are phases of sleep where you are paralyzed,

1:47:51.220 --> 1:47:52.140
 so-called REM sleep.

1:47:52.140 --> 1:47:53.800
 That's a healthy paralysis,

1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:55.960
 presumably so you can't act out your dreams.

1:47:55.960 --> 1:47:57.820
 But there are portions of the night where you can move.

1:47:57.820 --> 1:47:59.220
 And one of the more important movements

1:47:59.220 --> 1:48:01.020
 that you do in the middle of the night

1:48:01.020 --> 1:48:04.100
 is put your hand out or your foot out,

1:48:04.100 --> 1:48:06.660
 or you take your face out from under the covers

1:48:06.660 --> 1:48:08.580
 as a means to cool yourself,

1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:10.420
 and you do this while you are asleep.

1:48:10.420 --> 1:48:13.060
 If you are in a cool room,

1:48:13.060 --> 1:48:15.860
 you can put yourself under the blankets to stay warm.

1:48:15.860 --> 1:48:17.860
 And then if you want to cool off,

1:48:17.860 --> 1:48:19.620
 you can simply remove a limb

1:48:19.620 --> 1:48:21.640
 or you can toss the covers off entirely.

1:48:23.020 --> 1:48:25.820
 However, if you are in a room that's too warm,

1:48:25.820 --> 1:48:27.980
 it's very hard to cool off.

1:48:27.980 --> 1:48:29.820
 You would need a bucket of ice water

1:48:29.820 --> 1:48:32.180
 or to get up and turn on the air conditioning

1:48:32.180 --> 1:48:34.300
 or something of that sort, or turn on the fan.

1:48:34.300 --> 1:48:37.060
 So it's a simple but non-trivial way

1:48:37.060 --> 1:48:40.380
 in which we can improve our entrance to sleep

1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:41.760
 and staying asleep.

1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:45.940
 So keep the room cool or cold and get under warm blankets.

1:48:45.940 --> 1:48:48.140
 And if you want to understand more

1:48:48.140 --> 1:48:50.780
 about why putting a hand out or a foot out

1:48:50.780 --> 1:48:52.540
 is valuable for cooling,

1:48:52.540 --> 1:48:55.940
 I did an episode on the role of cooling

1:48:55.940 --> 1:48:58.980
 in something called heat dumping

1:48:58.980 --> 1:49:02.540
 or bringing heat into the body through the palms,

1:49:02.540 --> 1:49:03.940
 the face, and the bottoms of the feet.

1:49:03.940 --> 1:49:08.240
 You've got these portals, these radiators, if you will,

1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:11.420
 that allow us to bring heat into the body and to dump heat.

1:49:11.420 --> 1:49:12.660
 I don't want to go into the details now,

1:49:12.660 --> 1:49:14.120
 but that episode is entitled

1:49:14.120 --> 1:49:16.480
 Supercharge Your Exercise with Cold.

1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:18.860
 This is based on work that was done by Craig Heller's lab

1:49:18.860 --> 1:49:20.540
 at Stanford University.

1:49:20.540 --> 1:49:24.000
 Absolutely incredible data showing that the proper use

1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.620
 of palmar cooling, so the palms or the upper half

1:49:26.620 --> 1:49:28.440
 of the face or the bottoms of the feet,

1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:33.440
 can vastly, I mean, vastly increase the volume of exercise

1:49:33.500 --> 1:49:36.540
 that one can do and still recover from that exercise

1:49:36.540 --> 1:49:38.100
 and derive benefits from it.

1:49:38.100 --> 1:49:41.140
 But this method of cooling for exercise is grounded

1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:43.880
 in a basic physiological function of our palms,

1:49:43.880 --> 1:49:45.660
 the bottoms of our feet and our face,

1:49:45.660 --> 1:49:48.860
 which is to dump heat or to allow cool

1:49:48.860 --> 1:49:50.200
 to pass into the body.

1:49:50.200 --> 1:49:52.260
 So that's why in the middle of the night,

1:49:53.100 --> 1:49:54.420
 as long as you're not in REM sleep,

1:49:54.420 --> 1:49:57.180
 if you get too warm, you put your foot out

1:49:57.180 --> 1:49:58.540
 or you put your arms out,

1:49:58.540 --> 1:50:01.340
 you're actually allowing cooling of the body

1:50:01.340 --> 1:50:06.340
 through what are called AVAs, arteriovenous ostomoses,

1:50:06.900 --> 1:50:09.580
 is the technical name, that are in the palms,

1:50:09.580 --> 1:50:11.780
 the upper half of the face and the bottoms of the feet.

1:50:11.780 --> 1:50:14.060
 And that's a very efficient way to cool off your body,

1:50:14.060 --> 1:50:15.960
 so you do that subconsciously.

1:50:15.960 --> 1:50:19.840
 Now, there are things that one can take

1:50:19.840 --> 1:50:21.340
 to enhance the transition to sleep.

1:50:21.340 --> 1:50:23.500
 I am not a fan of melatonin

1:50:23.500 --> 1:50:25.300
 for enhancing the transition to sleep

1:50:25.300 --> 1:50:26.140
 for a couple of reasons.

1:50:26.140 --> 1:50:28.420
 One, dosages of melatonin are far too high

1:50:28.420 --> 1:50:30.140
 in most supplements.

1:50:30.140 --> 1:50:32.140
 Melatonin can have some negative effects

1:50:32.140 --> 1:50:34.980
 on the sex steroid hormones, testosterone, and estrogen.

1:50:34.980 --> 1:50:37.140
 That's a serious concern.

1:50:37.140 --> 1:50:40.120
 Third, melatonin's role during puberty or around puberty

1:50:40.120 --> 1:50:42.100
 is to suppress the onset of puberty.

1:50:42.100 --> 1:50:44.200
 So that's concerning.

1:50:44.200 --> 1:50:45.840
 I don't know that people should be taking this hormone

1:50:45.840 --> 1:50:48.160
 that has all these other effects.

1:50:48.160 --> 1:50:49.900
 The other reason is that melatonin

1:50:49.900 --> 1:50:51.260
 will aid the transition to sleep,

1:50:51.260 --> 1:50:52.300
 but it won't keep you asleep.

1:50:52.300 --> 1:50:53.580
 And many people that take melatonin

1:50:53.580 --> 1:50:55.400
 find that they fall asleep more quickly,

1:50:55.400 --> 1:50:58.600
 but then they wake up unable to fall back asleep.

1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:00.640
 Three compounds that could be very beneficial

1:51:00.640 --> 1:51:02.540
 for aiding the transition to sleep

1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:05.500
 and for which there are wide safety margins,

1:51:05.500 --> 1:51:07.100
 although please do check with your physician

1:51:07.100 --> 1:51:08.620
 before taking anything,

1:51:08.620 --> 1:51:11.080
 are specific forms of magnesium,

1:51:11.080 --> 1:51:14.120
 something called apigenin and theanine.

1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:15.740
 Magnesium comes in many forms.

1:51:15.740 --> 1:51:20.060
 Magnesium malate has been shown to improve recovery

1:51:20.060 --> 1:51:21.320
 from sore muscles.

1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:23.220
 For instance, magnesium citrate

1:51:23.220 --> 1:51:25.900
 is an excellent laxative, for instance.

1:51:25.900 --> 1:51:27.460
 Magnesium threonate,

1:51:27.460 --> 1:51:30.060
 that's T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, threonate,

1:51:30.060 --> 1:51:34.060
 and magnesium biglycinate have transporters

1:51:34.060 --> 1:51:36.220
 that allow them to cross the blood-brain barrier

1:51:36.220 --> 1:51:38.260
 more readily than other forms of magnesium.

1:51:38.260 --> 1:51:40.080
 And there within the brain,

1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:42.920
 they promote the release of a neurotransmitter called GABA,

1:51:42.920 --> 1:51:44.660
 which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter

1:51:44.660 --> 1:51:47.580
 which shuts off the forebrain to some extent.

1:51:47.580 --> 1:51:48.620
 It doesn't shut off completely,

1:51:48.620 --> 1:51:51.220
 but it essentially shuts down thinking, rumination,

1:51:51.220 --> 1:51:53.820
 planning, and what we call executive function.

1:51:53.820 --> 1:51:58.020
 So for many people taking 300 to 400 milligrams

1:51:58.020 --> 1:52:00.980
 of magnesium biglycinate or magnesium threonate,

1:52:00.980 --> 1:52:03.540
 and there I'm referring to the elemental magnesium,

1:52:03.540 --> 1:52:05.460
 for you aficionados,

1:52:05.460 --> 1:52:08.240
 many people find that doing that 30 to 60 minutes

1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:11.200
 before sleep can aid them in falling asleep,

1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:14.060
 can really help them fall asleep faster and stay asleep.

1:52:14.060 --> 1:52:15.460
 Some people, however,

1:52:15.460 --> 1:52:19.360
 achieve some gastrointestinal discomfort from magnesium

1:52:19.360 --> 1:52:21.600
 and therefore should avoid it.

1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:24.240
 Magnesium threonate and magnesium biglycinate

1:52:25.240 --> 1:52:27.180
 for many people work, however,

1:52:27.180 --> 1:52:30.420
 and when coupled with apigenin and theanine

1:52:30.420 --> 1:52:33.840
 provide a sort of synergy or a sleep cocktail

1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:36.380
 that seems to be very effective

1:52:36.380 --> 1:52:38.700
 in aiding the transition to sleep.

1:52:38.700 --> 1:52:42.620
 So apigenin is the substance that's found in chamomile,

1:52:42.620 --> 1:52:46.440
 and 50 milligrams of apigenin taken 30 minutes before sleep

1:52:46.440 --> 1:52:50.100
 can act as another way to shut off the forebrain

1:52:50.100 --> 1:52:52.300
 and reduce rumination, reduce anxiety,

1:52:52.300 --> 1:52:55.340
 and allow people to fall and stay asleep.

1:52:55.340 --> 1:52:58.280
 I did a podcast with Dr. Daria Rose.

1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:00.040
 She's got an excellent podcast

1:53:00.040 --> 1:53:01.380
 that I highly recommend you check out,

1:53:01.380 --> 1:53:02.580
 covers a number of different health,

1:53:02.580 --> 1:53:04.900
 scientific, and other subjects,

1:53:04.900 --> 1:53:06.540
 and she's a PhD in neuroscience,

1:53:06.540 --> 1:53:08.300
 terrific scientist, et cetera.

1:53:08.300 --> 1:53:11.180
 She's a big fan of apigenin, as am I.

1:53:11.180 --> 1:53:14.960
 And then the third compound is theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.

1:53:14.960 --> 1:53:19.960
 Theanine is a compound that can also increase GABA,

1:53:21.440 --> 1:53:23.200
 but also increases activation

1:53:23.200 --> 1:53:24.940
 of something called chloride channels.

1:53:24.940 --> 1:53:26.320
 Chloride channels are another way

1:53:26.320 --> 1:53:28.820
 in which neurons turn themselves off

1:53:28.820 --> 1:53:31.480
 or turn each other off, not turn each other off

1:53:31.480 --> 1:53:32.720
 in the way that we're typically heard,

1:53:32.720 --> 1:53:34.100
 like that turns me off, but turn them off

1:53:34.100 --> 1:53:36.840
 and then shut them down, lower their levels of activity.

1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:38.840
 So magnesium threonate or by glycinate,

1:53:38.840 --> 1:53:42.160
 apigenin and theanine in combination

1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:45.040
 can be very effective for aiding the transition to sleep.

1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:47.720
 And I realize that not everyone wants to take supplements.

1:53:47.720 --> 1:53:49.600
 I certainly am not pushing any of these.

1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:52.640
 I would hope that everybody be able to fall asleep easily

1:53:52.640 --> 1:53:55.220
 and stay asleep for the duration of time that they want

1:53:55.220 --> 1:53:57.080
 without any supplemental help.

1:53:57.080 --> 1:53:59.400
 But I do think it's important to point out some things

1:53:59.400 --> 1:54:01.320
 that lie somewhere between doing nothing

1:54:01.320 --> 1:54:02.840
 and taking prescription drugs,

1:54:02.840 --> 1:54:04.180
 because many of the prescription drugs

1:54:04.180 --> 1:54:08.480
 associated with sleep, and you all know what those are,

1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:10.340
 carry other side effects.

1:54:10.340 --> 1:54:15.120
 They can create bad dreams, often very disturbing dreams.

1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:17.660
 They can be addictive or at least habit forming.

1:54:17.660 --> 1:54:19.640
 They can create grogginess in the morning.

1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:20.780
 Some are safer than others.

1:54:20.780 --> 1:54:22.480
 There's a variety of them out there.

1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:25.480
 But for those that want to explore supplements

1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:26.640
 and how they can impact sleep,

1:54:26.640 --> 1:54:29.160
 this combination of about 300, 400 milligrams

1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:31.840
 of magnesium threonate or by glycinate,

1:54:31.840 --> 1:54:33.480
 50 milligrams of apigenin,

1:54:33.480 --> 1:54:36.280
 and 100 to 200 milligrams of theanine alone

1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:39.660
 or in combination have been beneficial to many people.

1:54:39.660 --> 1:54:42.560
 And there are excellent studies to support those statements.

1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:44.920
 Again, I suggest you go to examine.com

1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:46.960
 and look up the human effect matrix

1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:49.440
 for each of those compounds and you can explore them.

1:54:49.440 --> 1:54:52.860
 One of the more interesting aspects to magnesium threonate

1:54:52.860 --> 1:54:55.080
 and by glycinate is that it seems to have

1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:57.040
 some neuroprotective effects as well.

1:54:57.040 --> 1:54:58.200
 There aren't many studies on it,

1:54:58.200 --> 1:55:00.280
 but the few studies that are there point to the fact

1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:02.660
 that magnesium threonate and magnesium by glycinate

1:55:02.660 --> 1:55:05.800
 can also support neuron health and neuron longevity,

1:55:05.800 --> 1:55:07.960
 which is just an added bonus in my opinion.

1:55:07.960 --> 1:55:10.280
 Now, what if you wake up in the middle of the night?

1:55:10.280 --> 1:55:12.480
 This is a very common occurrence

1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:14.840
 and there are two general themes

1:55:14.840 --> 1:55:16.720
 around waking up in the middle of the night

1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:20.380
 that one can use tools to counteract.

1:55:20.380 --> 1:55:22.440
 The first theme is if you're somebody

1:55:22.440 --> 1:55:24.600
 who is tired in the evenings

1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:27.320
 and you're kind of pushing yourself to stay awake,

1:55:27.320 --> 1:55:28.940
 so you're going to the party

1:55:28.940 --> 1:55:31.460
 or you're pushing yourself to study your work,

1:55:31.460 --> 1:55:33.080
 when in fact you'd like to get into bed at eight,

1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:33.920
 three, or nine,

1:55:33.920 --> 1:55:36.160
 and then you're falling asleep around 10, 30, 11

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:38.040
 and waking up at 2.30 or three in the morning

1:55:38.040 --> 1:55:39.860
 and you can't fall back asleep,

1:55:39.860 --> 1:55:42.640
 chances are that your melatonin pulse

1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:45.080
 was initiated early in the night.

1:55:45.080 --> 1:55:50.080
 So that melatonin pulse started probably around 8.30 or nine

1:55:50.240 --> 1:55:53.080
 but you're staying up, you're battling that melatonin.

1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:57.160
 And then sometime around 2.30 or three in the morning,

1:55:57.160 --> 1:55:59.240
 that melatonin is no longer present,

1:55:59.240 --> 1:56:01.120
 it's sufficiently high levels in your bloodstream

1:56:01.120 --> 1:56:02.200
 and you're waking up,

1:56:02.200 --> 1:56:03.920
 you're getting your morning cortisol pulse

1:56:03.920 --> 1:56:07.300
 shifted into those wee hours of the morning.

1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:09.920
 You may not like this advice,

1:56:09.920 --> 1:56:11.560
 but one of the things that you can do to offset that

1:56:11.560 --> 1:56:13.860
 is to simply go to bed earlier.

1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:15.240
 By going to bed earlier,

1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:17.440
 you're going to get the longer duration of sleep.

1:56:17.440 --> 1:56:19.120
 But I realize that there are social reasons

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:22.160
 and work-related reasons why going to bed at 8.30 or nine

1:56:22.160 --> 1:56:25.600
 is not necessarily beneficial to your life.

1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:26.760
 So in that case,

1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:29.500
 you might be one of the rare individuals

1:56:29.500 --> 1:56:31.680
 for whom getting a little bit more bright light

1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:33.600
 in the evening could be a good thing.

1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:36.980
 So this would be around the hours of seven or 8 p.m.

1:56:36.980 --> 1:56:40.780
 And in that way, causing that pulse in melatonin

1:56:40.780 --> 1:56:45.780
 to be delayed because again, light inhibits melatonin.

1:56:45.780 --> 1:56:47.240
 Now, the other thing is

1:56:47.240 --> 1:56:49.060
 many people wake up in the middle of the night

1:56:49.060 --> 1:56:52.500
 because of anxiety or because they have to use the restroom.

1:56:52.500 --> 1:56:54.200
 It's perfectly fine to flip on the lights

1:56:54.200 --> 1:56:56.380
 but keep the lights dim.

1:56:56.380 --> 1:56:57.760
 But if you flip on those lights,

1:56:57.760 --> 1:57:00.200
 try and flip them off as soon as possible

1:57:00.200 --> 1:57:01.960
 and try and get back into bed.

1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:03.960
 And if you have trouble falling asleep again

1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:05.440
 and you absolutely need to sleep,

1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:07.060
 that's where these NSDR,

1:57:07.060 --> 1:57:08.720
 these non-sleep deep rest protocols

1:57:08.720 --> 1:57:10.080
 can really be beneficial.

1:57:10.080 --> 1:57:13.300
 Even though the NS, the non-sleep part

1:57:13.300 --> 1:57:15.260
 might make you think that

1:57:15.260 --> 1:57:17.280
 they will prevent you from falling asleep,

1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:19.960
 rather than trying to fight your mind,

1:57:19.960 --> 1:57:21.800
 trying to fight anxiety,

1:57:21.800 --> 1:57:23.360
 which is always a terrible thing to do.

1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:25.000
 I always say it's very hard to control the mind

1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:25.820
 with the mind.

1:57:25.820 --> 1:57:28.480
 Look to the body and that's what NSDR scripts do.

1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:32.380
 Things like yoga nidra, even the sleep hypnosis

1:57:32.380 --> 1:57:33.420
 done in the middle of the night

1:57:33.420 --> 1:57:35.160
 if you wake up and want to fall back asleep,

1:57:35.160 --> 1:57:39.160
 oftentimes will help you fall back asleep immediately.

1:57:39.160 --> 1:57:40.200
 And if they don't,

1:57:40.200 --> 1:57:42.000
 they will at least put your brain and body

1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:43.920
 into a state of deep relaxation

1:57:43.920 --> 1:57:46.180
 that more closely mimics the sleep state

1:57:46.180 --> 1:57:47.400
 that you ought to be in,

1:57:47.400 --> 1:57:48.920
 than the awake ruminating,

1:57:48.920 --> 1:57:51.480
 stressing about the fact that you're not sleeping state.

1:57:51.480 --> 1:57:53.240
 So if you wake up in the middle of the night,

1:57:53.240 --> 1:57:55.000
 really try and get back to sleep.

1:57:55.000 --> 1:57:57.920
 And if you can't do that by doing, for instance,

1:57:57.920 --> 1:58:00.320
 long exhale breathing, which can work,

1:58:00.320 --> 1:58:04.020
 use some other tool of the body to shift the mind.

1:58:04.020 --> 1:58:05.720
 And the tools that I'm recommending

1:58:05.720 --> 1:58:08.440
 are of the non-sleep deep rest variety.

1:58:08.440 --> 1:58:11.480
 So now we've essentially traveled around the clock,

1:58:11.480 --> 1:58:14.400
 so to speak, from the time where one wakes up

1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:16.980
 until the time they start working,

1:58:16.980 --> 1:58:20.400
 until the time they exercise, eat lunch,

1:58:20.400 --> 1:58:23.760
 do an NSDR, head to sleep, get to sleep,

1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:27.120
 maybe wake up, get back to sleep, et cetera.

1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:30.400
 I want to emphasize that although people's schedules vary,

1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:34.520
 most people are doing more than one or two workouts per day.

1:58:34.520 --> 1:58:36.600
 And indeed, I'm doing more than one

1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:38.160
 or two workouts per day.

1:58:38.160 --> 1:58:41.120
 I really emphasize that morning 90-minute work block

1:58:41.120 --> 1:58:44.140
 because I think most people would agree

1:58:44.140 --> 1:58:46.440
 that there's a portion of each day

1:58:46.440 --> 1:58:48.620
 in which we need to do the hardest thing

1:58:48.620 --> 1:58:50.380
 or the most important thing,

1:58:50.380 --> 1:58:54.780
 or the thing that demands the most of our cognitive self.

1:58:54.780 --> 1:58:56.360
 I position that early in the day,

1:58:56.360 --> 1:58:58.640
 and I position everything around that

1:58:58.640 --> 1:59:00.680
 in order to ensure that it happens

1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:03.600
 and that it happens with the highest degree of efficiency.

1:59:03.600 --> 1:59:05.960
 And yes, I make sure that it happens every day.

1:59:05.960 --> 1:59:08.820
 And that brings about two other important points.

1:59:08.820 --> 1:59:12.380
 First of all, we do have this thing called weekends,

1:59:12.380 --> 1:59:16.060
 and I tend to take one day off per week, not both,

1:59:16.060 --> 1:59:19.960
 much to the dismay of people in my life and Costello.

1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:24.000
 But nonetheless, there is something called weekend drift,

1:59:24.000 --> 1:59:26.520
 which is that we can be very regimented

1:59:26.520 --> 1:59:28.000
 on a Monday or a Tuesday,

1:59:28.000 --> 1:59:31.120
 and then even if we're good about maintaining a schedule,

1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:32.980
 Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, et cetera,

1:59:32.980 --> 1:59:35.420
 most of us, I would hope,

1:59:35.420 --> 1:59:37.800
 would alter their schedule somewhat on the weekends

1:59:37.800 --> 1:59:40.880
 in order to recover and get some additional rest.

1:59:40.880 --> 1:59:43.480
 And I want to emphasize, I absolutely do that.

1:59:43.480 --> 1:59:46.520
 I take one day per week where I go full Costello,

1:59:46.520 --> 1:59:49.120
 where I essentially do nothing in a structured way.

1:59:49.120 --> 1:59:52.160
 At least if I have my way, I'm not making any plans.

1:59:52.160 --> 1:59:55.200
 I'm completely free to explore what I want to do

1:59:55.200 --> 1:59:56.500
 and when I want to do it.

1:59:56.500 --> 1:59:57.800
 That's not the way life works out.

1:59:57.800 --> 2:00:00.440
 Oftentimes there are social engagements and other things

2:00:00.440 --> 2:00:02.680
 that get in the way or that I enjoy,

2:00:02.680 --> 2:00:04.360
 and that breaks up the day.

2:00:04.360 --> 2:00:06.260
 But I do take rest.

2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:08.880
 I don't think that one has to follow the same schedule

2:00:08.880 --> 2:00:09.840
 every single day.

2:00:09.840 --> 2:00:11.600
 However, I do think there are a few things

2:00:11.600 --> 2:00:15.240
 that people should do every single day, if possible.

2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:18.280
 And those are get morning sunlight,

2:00:18.280 --> 2:00:20.120
 because if you don't, your circadian rhythms

2:00:20.120 --> 2:00:21.520
 and your health, et cetera, and your mood

2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:23.440
 are going to start to drift

2:00:23.440 --> 2:00:26.840
 and to try and get sleep on a regular basis.

2:00:26.840 --> 2:00:29.480
 And of course, some of the greatest of things in life

2:00:29.480 --> 2:00:31.320
 happen after 10 p.m.,

2:00:31.320 --> 2:00:33.940
 and some of those even involve sleepless nights

2:00:33.940 --> 2:00:36.000
 of various kinds.

2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:37.720
 I certainly don't want to discourage people

2:00:37.720 --> 2:00:41.560
 from having a social life or from having a robust party life

2:00:41.560 --> 2:00:44.720
 if that's your thing, or for enjoying life,

2:00:44.720 --> 2:00:47.360
 because that's certainly one of the main things

2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:49.760
 that we should all be pursuing is to enjoy life.

2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:52.840
 The only point I want to make about sleep

2:00:52.840 --> 2:00:56.360
 is that if you happen to stay up late,

2:00:56.360 --> 2:00:59.200
 it's still best to get up at your regular wake-up time.

2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:01.280
 It's a very simple solution to a problem

2:01:01.280 --> 2:01:02.520
 that a lot of people have,

2:01:02.520 --> 2:01:04.320
 which is they stay up till two or three in the morning,

2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:05.720
 and then they tend to sleep late,

2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:07.780
 and then it tends to disrupt their rhythm.

2:01:07.780 --> 2:01:11.040
 Try on most days and most nights

2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:13.120
 to wake up at more or less the same time

2:01:13.120 --> 2:01:15.920
 and try to go to sleep at more or less the same time.

2:01:15.920 --> 2:01:18.860
 In fact, I was talking to Matt Walker about this recently,

2:01:18.860 --> 2:01:21.300
 and he was also surprised to see these new data,

2:01:21.300 --> 2:01:22.840
 and I was surprised to see these new data

2:01:22.840 --> 2:01:25.880
 that emphasized that if you get a poor night's sleep,

2:01:25.880 --> 2:01:29.080
 or if you're up late the previous night for good reasons,

2:01:29.080 --> 2:01:30.960
 many people feel like they just want to go to bed

2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:32.040
 early the next night,

2:01:32.040 --> 2:01:34.480
 but it turns out that's not the best thing to do

2:01:34.480 --> 2:01:36.560
 for your immediate and long-term health.

2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:37.840
 Try and stay up to the point

2:01:37.840 --> 2:01:40.400
 where you would normally stay up and then get to sleep.

2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:41.960
 If you go to bed a couple hours earlier,

2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:43.380
 it's probably not going to kill you,

2:01:43.380 --> 2:01:46.900
 but try to not go to bed, for instance, at 6 p.m.

2:01:46.900 --> 2:01:48.560
 because you were up the entire night before.

2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:50.840
 That can really be disruptive.

2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:52.680
 The other thing I want to emphasize is that

2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:57.440
 even though that morning 90-minute work block is so vital,

2:01:57.440 --> 2:01:59.440
 of course, there's a second work block,

2:01:59.440 --> 2:02:01.380
 and in fact, I described one in the afternoon

2:02:01.380 --> 2:02:02.620
 after the NSDR.

2:02:02.620 --> 2:02:04.800
 For me, that's reverie hypnosis.

2:02:04.800 --> 2:02:08.760
 There's a 90-minute work block in which I drop in again

2:02:08.760 --> 2:02:12.760
 in a no internet connection, no phone kind of way

2:02:12.760 --> 2:02:15.640
 to complete some work that's important to me.

2:02:15.640 --> 2:02:18.160
 So combined, that's just three hours of focused work,

2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:20.180
 which may not seem like a lot,

2:02:20.180 --> 2:02:22.140
 but if you were to dissect your day

2:02:22.140 --> 2:02:24.760
 and kind of look at the arc and structure of your day,

2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:28.660
 I'd be willing to bet that if we added up

2:02:28.660 --> 2:02:31.400
 the total period of time in which you were in

2:02:31.400 --> 2:02:33.760
 what Cal Newport would call deep work,

2:02:33.760 --> 2:02:35.580
 really focused, dedicated work,

2:02:35.580 --> 2:02:39.040
 that it would probably amount to about three or four hours.

2:02:39.040 --> 2:02:42.080
 If you can squeeze in another 90-minute work block,

2:02:42.080 --> 2:02:44.720
 or if you can get four 90-minute work blocks,

2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:45.800
 well, then more power to you,

2:02:45.800 --> 2:02:48.320
 but I think most people find that one or two

2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:51.360
 of these really deep focused 90-minute work blocks

2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:55.400
 are about what one's schedule and even mind can handle.

2:02:55.400 --> 2:02:56.920
 And of course, throughout the day,

2:02:56.920 --> 2:02:58.440
 there are other things happening

2:02:58.440 --> 2:03:00.840
 outside of those 90-minute work blocks.

2:03:00.840 --> 2:03:03.360
 I'm checking my text messages, I'm checking my email,

2:03:03.360 --> 2:03:05.060
 I'm responding to various demands,

2:03:05.060 --> 2:03:08.000
 I'm working and tending to life.

2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:11.080
 So while I've carved some boundaries

2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:13.560
 or delineated some boundaries around those work blocks,

2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:15.520
 and I'm certain that if you do too,

2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:16.800
 you will benefit from them,

2:03:16.800 --> 2:03:19.640
 they are certainly not the only periods of time each day

2:03:19.640 --> 2:03:21.640
 in which I, or I believe other people

2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:24.220
 should be trying to learn or trying to focus.

2:03:24.220 --> 2:03:26.400
 And I want to emphasize that even though my job

2:03:26.400 --> 2:03:29.640
 is to discover knowledge and distribute knowledge,

2:03:29.640 --> 2:03:30.680
 because I'm a scientist,

2:03:30.680 --> 2:03:32.980
 I realized that 90-minute work blocks

2:03:32.980 --> 2:03:35.280
 of the sort that I'm describing

2:03:35.280 --> 2:03:37.920
 may not apply specifically to the kinds of work you do

2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:39.800
 if you're an artist or a sculptor,

2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:40.800
 where you build furniture,

2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:42.200
 or whatever it is that you happen to,

2:03:42.200 --> 2:03:44.140
 you teach children or they teach you,

2:03:44.140 --> 2:03:45.880
 whatever it happens to be.

2:03:45.880 --> 2:03:50.360
 Of course, please adapt and modify what I've described today

2:03:50.360 --> 2:03:52.780
 in ways that best serve you and your schedule.

2:03:52.780 --> 2:03:55.580
 What I've tried to do is provide you a picture

2:03:55.580 --> 2:03:58.480
 of the 24-hour schedule that I follow

2:03:58.480 --> 2:04:01.720
 and why I do certain things at particular times

2:04:01.720 --> 2:04:03.680
 and why I do those particular things.

2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:05.120
 And I've really tried to emphasize

2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:07.640
 the scientific rationale behind those things,

2:04:07.640 --> 2:04:09.300
 the peer-reviewed data.

2:04:09.300 --> 2:04:11.440
 In some cases, I pointed out the specific papers,

2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:14.240
 in other cases, I've referred to large bodies of work

2:04:14.240 --> 2:04:16.080
 that support these practices.

2:04:16.080 --> 2:04:17.960
 When I say large bodies of work,

2:04:17.960 --> 2:04:21.060
 I'm a big fan of looking to the scientific literature

2:04:21.060 --> 2:04:23.920
 and asking where is the center of mass

2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:25.720
 for a particular topic?

2:04:25.720 --> 2:04:30.720
 For instance, where is there 50 or 100 or 1,000 papers

2:04:30.780 --> 2:04:34.180
 that, for instance, support morning light viewing

2:04:34.180 --> 2:04:38.880
 in order to optimize melatonin secretion later in the day,

2:04:38.880 --> 2:04:40.960
 cortisol secretion early in the day,

2:04:40.960 --> 2:04:43.140
 mood, metabolism, et cetera.

2:04:43.140 --> 2:04:47.640
 If one were to put into PubMed light, metabolism, and mood,

2:04:47.640 --> 2:04:50.560
 you would literally get tens of thousands,

2:04:50.560 --> 2:04:52.360
 maybe even hundreds of thousands of studies.

2:04:52.360 --> 2:04:53.720
 So when I say the center of mass,

2:04:53.720 --> 2:04:56.960
 what I've really tried to do is examine the literature

2:04:56.960 --> 2:05:00.940
 and figure out where there's a sort of a directive protocol

2:05:00.940 --> 2:05:02.920
 that emerges from all these various studies

2:05:02.920 --> 2:05:06.800
 that used, in some cases, animals, in many cases, humans,

2:05:06.800 --> 2:05:09.840
 and explore different, what we call dependent variables.

2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:11.920
 Some studies were looking at effects on blood sugar,

2:05:11.920 --> 2:05:13.320
 other on mood.

2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:16.520
 So I hope that makes clear why the rationale

2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:18.280
 behind what I provided today.

2:05:18.280 --> 2:05:20.680

2:06:01.820 --> 2:06:04.820
 During today's episode, I describe various supplements

2:06:04.820 --> 2:06:06.960
 that one might want to consider taking.

2:06:06.960 --> 2:06:10.780
 We've partnered with Thorne, that's T-H-O-R-N-E.com,

2:06:10.780 --> 2:06:12.760
 because Thorne supplements are known to be

2:06:12.760 --> 2:06:15.720
 of the very highest stringency and quality.

2:06:15.720 --> 2:06:17.160
 When I say stringency and quality,

2:06:17.160 --> 2:06:20.080
 that means the quality of the individual ingredients,

2:06:20.080 --> 2:06:23.360
 as well as the amounts of those ingredients match precisely

2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:25.280
 with what's listed on the packaging.

2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:27.860
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I personally take,

2:06:27.860 --> 2:06:32.600
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman,

2:06:32.600 --> 2:06:34.820
 and there you'll see all the supplements that I take,

2:06:34.820 --> 2:06:37.720
 and you can get 20% off any of those supplements

2:06:37.720 --> 2:06:40.680
 or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

2:06:40.680 --> 2:06:42.040
