00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.160 --> 00:13.040
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.040 --> 00:14.880
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.560
 Today, my guest is Dr. Rhonda Patrick.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.560
 Dr. Patrick is known to some of you as a podcaster

00:20.560 --> 00:23.760
 and one of the premier educators in the landscape

00:23.760 --> 00:26.840
 of mitochondria, metabolism, stress,

00:26.840 --> 00:29.480
 and other aspects of brain and body health.

00:29.480 --> 00:31.960
 Her podcast, Found My Fitness,

00:31.960 --> 00:34.000
 is one of the premier podcasts in the world

00:34.000 --> 00:36.560
 for disseminating knowledge about how the brain

00:36.560 --> 00:39.520
 and body work and how we can use behavioral tools,

00:39.520 --> 00:42.880
 micronutrients, supplements, and other protocols

00:42.880 --> 00:46.200
 in order to maximize our immediate and long-term health.

00:46.200 --> 00:49.500
 Dr. Patrick did her formal training in cell biology,

00:49.500 --> 00:52.760
 exploring the links between mitochondrial metabolism,

00:52.760 --> 00:55.600
 apoptosis, which is naturally occurring cell death,

00:55.600 --> 00:57.960
 which is a healthy form of cell death

00:57.960 --> 01:00.200
 that occurs in our brain and body throughout the lifespan,

01:00.200 --> 01:02.460
 and cancer biology.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.660
 She then went on to do postdoctoral training

01:04.660 --> 01:06.960
 with Dr. Bruce Ames investigating the effects

01:06.960 --> 01:09.480
 of micronutrients, meaning vitamins and minerals,

01:09.480 --> 01:12.520
 and how they affect metabolism, inflammation,

01:12.520 --> 01:15.060
 DNA damage, and the aging process.

01:15.060 --> 01:17.520
 She has published landmark review articles

01:17.520 --> 01:21.160
 and primary research, meaning original research articles,

01:21.160 --> 01:22.880
 in some of the premier journals in the world,

01:22.880 --> 01:25.680
 including Science, Nature Cell Biology,

01:25.680 --> 01:28.060
 Trends in Cell Biology, and FASEB.

01:28.060 --> 01:30.240
 Indeed, Dr. Patrick is an expert

01:30.240 --> 01:33.320
 in an extraordinarily broad range of topics

01:33.320 --> 01:34.840
 that impact our health.

01:34.840 --> 01:35.840
 For today's episode,

01:35.840 --> 01:38.400
 we focus primarily on the major categories

01:38.400 --> 01:40.760
 of micronutrients that are essential

01:40.760 --> 01:42.640
 for brain and body health.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.560
 I have to confess that before the discussion

01:44.560 --> 01:47.540
 with Dr. Patrick, I was aware of only one of the categories

01:47.540 --> 01:49.380
 of micronutrients that we discuss.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.880
 And so you'll notice that I am wrapped with attention

01:51.880 --> 01:53.580
 throughout the discussion.

01:53.580 --> 01:56.120
 And I think that you'll want to have a pen and paper handy

01:56.120 --> 01:59.920
 because she offers not only a very clear understanding

01:59.920 --> 02:01.440
 of the biological mechanisms

02:01.440 --> 02:04.100
 by which other micronutrients operate,

02:04.100 --> 02:07.280
 but some very clear and actionable tools

02:07.280 --> 02:09.780
 and items that we can all embark on

02:09.780 --> 02:12.640
 if we are to optimize our brain and body health.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.220
 We also discuss behavioral protocols.

02:15.220 --> 02:17.440
 Dr. Patrick is well-known for her understanding

02:17.440 --> 02:19.640
 of the scientific literature on sauna

02:19.640 --> 02:22.680
 and the use of heat and cold for optimizing things

02:22.680 --> 02:25.840
 like metabolism, longevity, cardiovascular health.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.600
 And I'm delighted to say that we discussed that as well

02:28.600 --> 02:31.920
 and how behavioral protocols can interface

02:31.920 --> 02:34.880
 with supplement-based and nutritional protocols.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.840
 I'm confident that you'll learn a tremendous amount

02:36.840 --> 02:38.920
 of information from Dr. Patrick,

02:38.920 --> 02:41.340
 much of which is immediately actionable.

02:41.340 --> 02:43.080
 And if you're not already following and listening

02:43.080 --> 02:46.040
 to her excellent podcast, you'll absolutely want to do that.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.940
 It's foundmyfitness.com is the website

02:48.940 --> 02:50.660
 where you can get access to that podcast.

02:50.660 --> 02:53.840
 It's also on Apple and Spotify and YouTube

02:53.840 --> 02:55.400
 as foundmyfitness.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.340
 Dr. Patrick also has a terrific newsletter

02:57.340 --> 02:58.660
 that I recommend signing up for.

02:58.660 --> 03:01.660
 It's foundmyfitness.com slash newsletter

03:01.660 --> 03:03.040
 is where you'll find it.

03:03.040 --> 03:06.720
 And it includes research on fasting, micronutrients,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.960
 sleep, depression, fitness, longevity, and far more,

03:09.960 --> 03:12.540
 along of course with actionable protocols.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.040
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:15.040 --> 03:17.700
 is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

03:17.700 --> 03:19.880
 Our motivation for partnering with Momentous

03:19.880 --> 03:22.760
 is to provide people one location where they can go

03:22.760 --> 03:25.520
 to access the highest quality supplements

03:25.520 --> 03:28.540
 in the specific dosages that are best supported

03:28.540 --> 03:31.240
 by the scientific research and that are discussed

03:31.240 --> 03:33.880
 during various episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

03:33.880 --> 03:37.280
 If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

03:37.280 --> 03:38.840
 you will see those formulations.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.320
 I should mention that we are going to add more formulations

03:41.320 --> 03:43.040
 in the months to come,

03:43.040 --> 03:45.580
 and you will see specific suggestions

03:45.580 --> 03:47.480
 about how best to take those supplements,

03:47.480 --> 03:49.600
 meaning what dosages and times of day,

03:49.600 --> 03:52.400
 and in fact, how to combine those supplements

03:52.400 --> 03:54.660
 with specific behavioral protocols

03:54.660 --> 03:56.320
 that have been discussed on the podcast

03:56.320 --> 03:58.560
 and are science supported in order to derive

03:58.560 --> 04:01.600
 the maximum benefit from those supplements.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.640
 And many of you will probably also be pleased to learn

04:04.640 --> 04:07.240
 that Momentous ships not just within the United States,

04:07.240 --> 04:08.920
 but also internationally.

04:08.920 --> 04:12.640
 So once again, if you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

04:12.640 --> 04:14.160
 you will find what we firmly believe

04:14.160 --> 04:19.160
 to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages

04:19.160 --> 04:22.840
 and the best protocols for taking those supplements,

04:22.840 --> 04:25.660
 along with the ideal behavioral protocols

04:25.660 --> 04:27.760
 to combine with those supplement formulations.

04:27.760 --> 04:28.600
 I'm pleased to announce

04:28.600 --> 04:31.440
 that I'm hosting two live events this May.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.960
 The first live event will be hosted

04:32.960 --> 04:35.640
 in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.240
 The second live event will be hosted

04:37.240 --> 04:39.640
 in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.640
 Both are part of a lecture series entitled

04:41.640 --> 04:43.240
 The Brain-Body Contract,

04:43.240 --> 04:46.280
 during which I will discuss science and science-based tools

04:46.280 --> 04:48.920
 for mental health, physical health, and performance.

04:48.920 --> 04:49.960
 And I should point out

04:49.960 --> 04:52.160
 that while some of the material I'll cover

04:52.160 --> 04:54.020
 will overlap with information covered here

04:54.020 --> 04:55.640
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast

04:55.640 --> 04:57.480
 and on various social media posts,

04:57.480 --> 04:59.140
 most of the information I will cover

04:59.140 --> 05:01.400
 is going to be distinct from information

05:01.400 --> 05:03.520
 covered on the podcast or elsewhere.

05:03.520 --> 05:06.040
 So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,

05:06.040 --> 05:07.400
 Portland on May 18th.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.480
 You can access tickets by going to HubermanLab.com slash tour

05:11.480 --> 05:12.800
 and I hope to see you there.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.320
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

05:15.320 --> 05:18.260
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

05:18.260 --> 05:20.480
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

05:20.480 --> 05:23.120
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

05:23.120 --> 05:25.880
 and science-related tools to the general public.

05:25.880 --> 05:26.960
 In keeping with that theme,

05:26.960 --> 05:29.700
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.920
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

05:31.920 --> 05:33.440
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

05:33.440 --> 05:35.880
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

05:35.880 --> 05:38.760
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

05:38.760 --> 05:41.220
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

05:41.220 --> 05:42.920
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

05:42.920 --> 05:44.360
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

05:44.360 --> 05:46.640
 once or twice a day is that it helps me cover

05:46.640 --> 05:48.400
 all of my basic nutritional needs.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.880
 It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.

05:50.880 --> 05:52.900
 In addition, it has probiotics,

05:52.900 --> 05:55.500
 which are vital for microbiome health.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.360
 I've done a couple of episodes now

05:57.360 --> 05:59.280
 on the so-called gut microbiome

05:59.280 --> 06:02.040
 and the ways in which the microbiome interacts

06:02.040 --> 06:05.120
 with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,

06:05.120 --> 06:07.280
 and essentially with every biological system

06:07.280 --> 06:10.040
 relevant to health throughout your brain and body.

06:10.040 --> 06:11.820
 With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,

06:11.820 --> 06:12.840
 the minerals I need,

06:12.840 --> 06:15.600
 and the probiotics to support my microbiome.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.000
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

06:17.000 --> 06:19.640
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:19.640 --> 06:21.120
 and claim a special offer.

06:21.120 --> 06:22.880
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

06:22.880 --> 06:24.620
 which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens

06:24.620 --> 06:25.760
 while you're on the road,

06:25.760 --> 06:29.040
 plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.380
 There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3

06:31.380 --> 06:33.640
 is essential for various aspects of our brain

06:33.640 --> 06:34.500
 and body health.

06:34.500 --> 06:36.600
 Even if we're getting a lot of sunshine,

06:36.600 --> 06:38.980
 many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3.

06:38.980 --> 06:41.400
 And K2 is also important because it regulates things

06:41.400 --> 06:42.600
 like cardiovascular function,

06:42.600 --> 06:44.960
 calcium in the body, and so on.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.760
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:47.760 --> 06:50.240
 to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs

06:50.240 --> 06:52.740
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:52.740 --> 06:55.400
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.

06:55.400 --> 06:57.720
 Thesis makes what are called nootropics,

06:57.720 --> 06:59.480
 which means smart drugs.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.800
 Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.

07:02.800 --> 07:05.440
 I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that

07:05.440 --> 07:07.340
 I don't believe that there's any one substance

07:07.340 --> 07:10.440
 or collection of substances that can make us smarter.

07:10.440 --> 07:12.800
 I do believe based on science, however,

07:12.800 --> 07:15.120
 that there are particular neural circuits and brain functions

07:15.120 --> 07:18.200
 that allow us to be more focused, more alert,

07:18.200 --> 07:20.600
 access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.000
 That's just the way that the brain works.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.520
 Different neural circuits for different brain states.

07:24.520 --> 07:25.880
 And so the idea of a nootropic

07:25.880 --> 07:27.680
 that's just going to make us smarter all around

07:27.680 --> 07:30.920
 fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things, right?

07:30.920 --> 07:33.000
 If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.200
 you're doing accounting, at different part of the day,

07:35.200 --> 07:36.040
 you need to be creative.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.240
 These are all different brain processes.

07:38.240 --> 07:39.760
 Thesis understands this.

07:39.760 --> 07:42.120
 And as far as I know, they're the first nootropics company

07:42.120 --> 07:45.400
 to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.940
 They only use the highest quality ingredients,

07:46.940 --> 07:48.280
 which of course is essential.

07:48.280 --> 07:49.960
 Some of those I've talked about on the podcast,

07:49.960 --> 07:53.860
 things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine.

07:53.860 --> 07:55.940
 They give you the ability to try several different blends

07:55.940 --> 07:57.200
 over the course of a month,

07:57.200 --> 07:58.940
 discover which nootropics work best

07:58.940 --> 08:02.240
 for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.160
 And with that personalization,

08:04.160 --> 08:07.060
 design a kit of nootropics that's ideal

08:07.060 --> 08:09.520
 for the different brain and body states you want to access.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.840
 I've been using thesis for more than six months now,

08:11.840 --> 08:13.760
 and I can confidently say that the nootropics

08:13.760 --> 08:15.440
 have been a total game changer.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.120
 My go-to formula is the clarity formula,

08:18.120 --> 08:21.260
 or sometimes I'll use their energy formula before training.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.300
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

08:23.300 --> 08:26.240
 go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

08:26.240 --> 08:27.220
 take a three minute quiz,

08:27.220 --> 08:29.220
 and thesis will send you four different formulas

08:29.220 --> 08:30.860
 to try in your first month.

08:30.860 --> 08:33.040
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

08:33.040 --> 08:34.680
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

08:34.680 --> 08:36.800
 for 10% off your first order.

08:36.800 --> 08:39.760
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.420
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

08:42.420 --> 08:45.040
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

08:45.040 --> 08:46.600
 to help you better understand your body

08:46.600 --> 08:48.500
 and help you reach your health goals.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.280
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

08:51.280 --> 08:53.600
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

08:53.600 --> 08:55.680
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

08:55.680 --> 08:58.200
 can only be assessed with a quality blood test.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.820
 What's unique about Inside Tracker is that

08:59.820 --> 09:02.080
 while there are a lot of different tests out there

09:02.080 --> 09:04.760
 for hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,

09:04.760 --> 09:06.720
 with Inside Tracker, you get the numbers back

09:06.720 --> 09:07.900
 in terms of your levels,

09:07.900 --> 09:09.920
 but they also give you very clear directives

09:09.920 --> 09:12.600
 in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation

09:12.600 --> 09:15.240
 that can help you bring those values into the ranges

09:15.240 --> 09:17.320
 that are best for you and your health goals.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.560
 And that's very different than a lot of the other programs

09:19.560 --> 09:20.560
 where you get a lot of information,

09:20.560 --> 09:22.720
 but you don't really know what to do with that information.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.380
 Inside Tracker makes that all very easy to understand

09:25.380 --> 09:28.940
 and very actionable based on the very easy to use dashboard

 And now for my discussion with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.

09:42.400 --> 09:43.700
 Rhonda, welcome.

09:43.700 --> 09:45.460
 This has been a long time coming,

09:45.460 --> 09:46.520
 even longer than you know,

09:46.520 --> 09:49.220
 because even before we discussed you coming

09:49.220 --> 09:50.600
 on this podcast as a guest,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.040
 I've been watching your content for a very long time.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.860
 So I want to start off by saying thank you.

09:54.860 --> 09:58.360
 You were the spearhead to break through

09:58.360 --> 10:01.700
 from academic science to public education.

10:01.700 --> 10:04.560
 So I consider you first in,

10:04.560 --> 10:06.660
 and the rest of us are just in your wake.

10:06.660 --> 10:08.000
 So thank you for that.

10:08.000 --> 10:08.840
 That's been-

10:08.840 --> 10:09.940
 Oh, that is so kind.

10:09.940 --> 10:10.780
 Thank you.

10:10.780 --> 10:11.600
 Thank you so much.

10:11.600 --> 10:12.440
 It's absolutely true.

10:12.440 --> 10:14.480
 I am so excited to be here having a conversation with you.

10:14.480 --> 10:15.880
 Thank you.

10:15.880 --> 10:16.880
 It's absolutely true.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.860
 If anyone does their research,

10:18.860 --> 10:20.760
 they will realize that the statement I just made

10:20.760 --> 10:21.600
 is absolutely true.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.680
 And there isn't even a close second, you know,

10:23.680 --> 10:26.200
 any other public facing educators

10:26.200 --> 10:28.320
 that have formal science training

10:28.320 --> 10:33.320
 and do regular posting of content came in several years

10:33.320 --> 10:34.880
 after you initiated it.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.060
 So we're all grateful.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.060
 I have so many questions,

10:39.060 --> 10:43.080
 but I want to start off with a kind of a new,

10:43.080 --> 10:46.340
 but old theme that you're very familiar with.

10:46.340 --> 10:49.400
 So temperature is a powerful stimulus,

10:49.400 --> 10:50.880
 as we know for biology.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.540
 And you've covered a lot of material related

10:53.540 --> 10:56.200
 to the utility of cold,

10:56.200 --> 10:58.240
 but also the utility of heat.

10:58.240 --> 11:01.280
 And as I learn more and more from your content

11:01.280 --> 11:02.980
 and from the various papers,

11:02.980 --> 11:07.080
 it seems that there's a bit of a conundrum

11:07.080 --> 11:10.520
 in that cold can stimulate a number of things

11:10.520 --> 11:12.280
 like increases in metabolism, brown fat,

11:12.280 --> 11:13.120
 et cetera, et cetera.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.900
 Hopefully you'll tell us more about those,

11:14.900 --> 11:18.340
 but heat seems to be able to do a lot of the same things.

11:18.340 --> 11:22.640
 And I wonder whether or not the discomfort of cold,

11:22.640 --> 11:25.060
 deliberate cold exposure and the discomfort of heat

11:25.060 --> 11:28.200
 might be anchoring to the same pathway.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.080
 So would you mind sharing with us a little bit

11:30.080 --> 11:33.940
 about what happens when we get into a cold environment

11:33.940 --> 11:35.980
 on purpose and what happens when we get

11:35.980 --> 11:37.960
 into a hot environment on purpose?

11:37.960 --> 11:40.100
 And I'm hoping that this might eventually lead us

11:40.100 --> 11:43.040
 to some point of convergent understanding.

11:43.040 --> 11:44.980
 So if you would.

11:44.980 --> 11:47.100
 I would love to, let's take a step back.

11:47.100 --> 11:49.960
 And I think you brought up a really important point here.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.400
 And I think that point has to do

11:51.400 --> 11:55.120
 with the intermittent challenging of yourself

11:55.120 --> 11:58.600
 and whether that is through temperature changes

11:58.600 --> 12:02.880
 like cold or heat or through other types of stressors

12:02.880 --> 12:07.120
 like physical activity or perhaps even dietary compounds

12:07.120 --> 12:08.900
 that are bound in plants.

12:08.900 --> 12:12.000
 These are things like polyphenols or flavanols.

12:12.000 --> 12:16.920
 Humans, we evolved to intermittently challenge ourselves.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.600
 And before we had Instacart where you could basically

12:20.600 --> 12:22.260
 just get your food delivered to you,

12:22.260 --> 12:26.020
 before the industrial revolution occurred,

12:26.020 --> 12:31.020
 we were out hunting, and I say we, not us, but humans.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.840
 We were out gathering, we were moving,

12:34.840 --> 12:36.240
 and we had to be physically fit.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.960
 You couldn't catch your prey

12:37.960 --> 12:40.160
 if you were a sedentary slob, right?

12:40.160 --> 12:42.880
 We're moving and you had to pick your berries,

12:42.880 --> 12:43.700
 you had to move.

12:43.700 --> 12:48.380
 And so physical activity was a part of everyday life.

12:48.380 --> 12:51.120
 And caloric restriction or intermittent fasting

12:51.120 --> 12:52.040
 was also a part of it.

12:52.040 --> 12:54.280
 This is another type of challenge.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.680
 We didn't always have a prey that we caught

12:57.680 --> 13:00.120
 or maybe temperatures were such that

13:00.120 --> 13:02.060
 there was nothing for us to gather, right?

13:02.060 --> 13:04.740
 So food scarcity was something common

13:04.740 --> 13:06.240
 as well as eating plants.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.920
 So getting these compounds that I mentioned.

13:07.920 --> 13:12.580
 So these are all types of stress, intermittent challenges

13:12.580 --> 13:16.340
 that activate genetic pathways in our bodies.

13:16.340 --> 13:18.720
 These are often referred to in science

13:18.720 --> 13:20.860
 as stress response pathways

13:20.860 --> 13:23.340
 because they respond to a little bit of stress.

13:23.340 --> 13:25.060
 Physical activity is strenuous.

13:25.060 --> 13:26.400
 Fasting is a little bit stressful.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.540
 Heat, cold, these things are all types

13:28.540 --> 13:30.620
 of little intermittent challenges.

13:30.620 --> 13:35.620
 And there is a lot of crosstalk between these stressors

13:36.000 --> 13:38.680
 and the genetic pathways that they activate.

13:38.680 --> 13:41.120
 And these genetic pathways that are activated

13:41.120 --> 13:42.640
 help you deal with stress.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.840
 And they do it in a way that is not only beneficial

13:46.840 --> 13:48.960
 to help you deal with that little stressor,

13:48.960 --> 13:51.960
 exercise or heat, it stays active

13:51.960 --> 13:53.580
 and it helps you deal with the stress

13:53.580 --> 13:57.040
 of normal metabolism, normal immune function happening,

13:57.040 --> 13:58.680
 just life, aging, right?

13:58.680 --> 14:01.440
 So this concept is referred to as hormesis, right?

14:01.440 --> 14:04.800
 This is a little bit of stressful challenge

14:04.800 --> 14:06.840
 that activates these stress response pathways

14:06.840 --> 14:09.120
 in a beneficial way that is a net positive

14:09.120 --> 14:13.200
 that actually has a very profound antioxidant,

14:13.200 --> 14:16.660
 anti-inflammatory response or whatever the response is.

14:16.660 --> 14:19.200
 It could be the production of more stem cells.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.940
 These are cells that help regenerate different cells

14:21.940 --> 14:24.560
 within tissues or something like autophagy,

14:24.560 --> 14:26.480
 which is a process that can clear away

14:26.480 --> 14:28.320
 all the gunk inside of our cells,

14:28.320 --> 14:30.760
 pieces of DNA, protein aggregates.

14:30.760 --> 14:34.480
 So you'll find that these stress response pathways

14:34.480 --> 14:37.960
 are activated by a variety of stressors.

14:37.960 --> 14:41.280
 So for example, one pathway is called heat shock proteins.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.960
 And as their name would apply, one would go,

14:42.960 --> 14:44.760
 oh, they're activated by heat.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.440
 Well, correct, they are activated very robustly by heat.

14:47.440 --> 14:48.300
 And we can talk about that.

14:48.300 --> 14:53.080
 But you can eat a plant like broccoli sprouts,

14:53.080 --> 14:55.000
 which is high in something called sulforaphane.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.840
 This is a compound that is sort of like a hormetic compound

14:58.840 --> 15:00.160
 or as David Sinclair likes to say,

15:00.160 --> 15:02.040
 it's a xenohormetic compound.

15:02.040 --> 15:03.560
 I love that, I love that term.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.760
 And it activates heat shock proteins, among other things.

15:07.760 --> 15:10.880
 It also activates a very powerful detoxification pathway

15:10.880 --> 15:14.280
 called NRF2, which helps you detoxify things

15:14.280 --> 15:15.840
 like carcinogens that you're exposed to.

15:15.840 --> 15:16.680
 Well, guess what?

15:16.680 --> 15:17.760
 Heat activates that.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.360
 So what I'm getting at is there is overlap.

15:20.360 --> 15:23.040
 Like cold also activates heat shock proteins.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.040
 You're like, really, cold?

15:24.040 --> 15:25.320
 Yes, it activates.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.720
 These are stress response pathways

15:27.720 --> 15:30.620
 and they are activated by various types of stressors.

15:30.620 --> 15:34.360
 Now, you're gonna more robustly activate heat shock proteins

15:34.360 --> 15:39.320
 from heat versus cold, but there is some overlap.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.920
 So I think that sort of forms a foundation there.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.400
 Yeah, that's very helpful.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.760
 And it brings to mind in the context of the nervous system,

15:47.760 --> 15:51.080
 I always tell people, you only have a small kit

15:51.080 --> 15:52.840
 of neurochemicals to work with.

15:52.840 --> 15:55.800
 There isn't dopamine for Netflix

15:55.800 --> 15:57.260
 and then dopamine for relationship

15:57.260 --> 15:59.640
 and dopamine for work, et cetera.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.600
 Dopamine is a generic pathway by which motivation,

16:02.600 --> 16:05.840
 craving and pursuit emerge, et cetera.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.000
 Just like adrenaline is a generic theme

16:09.000 --> 16:10.160
 of many different behaviors.

16:10.160 --> 16:13.720
 And it seems that it is the job of biological systems

16:13.720 --> 16:15.960
 to be able to take a diverse range of inputs,

16:15.960 --> 16:18.720
 even unknown inputs, like we don't know

16:18.720 --> 16:20.840
 what technology will look like in three years,

16:20.840 --> 16:22.700
 but you can bet that some of those novel technologies

16:22.700 --> 16:25.000
 will tap into the very systems that I'm talking about now.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.760
 And there certainly will be other stressors to come about

16:28.760 --> 16:30.420
 that will tap into these pathways.

16:30.420 --> 16:33.180
 I have two questions related to what you just said

16:33.180 --> 16:36.560
 before we talk a little bit more about cold and heat.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.520
 You mentioned plants as a route

16:39.520 --> 16:42.200
 to creating intermittent challenge.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.200
 There's a lot of debate, mostly online,

16:45.200 --> 16:46.640
 about whether or not plants are our friends

16:46.640 --> 16:48.360
 or plants are trying to kill us.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.500
 The extreme version from the carnivore types,

16:51.500 --> 16:52.760
 pure carnivore diet types,

16:52.760 --> 16:54.420
 is that plants are trying to kill us.

16:54.420 --> 16:56.040
 From the plant-based diet folks,

16:56.040 --> 16:58.860
 it seems like it's more about what's healthy

16:58.860 --> 17:01.180
 for the plant and animals and maybe for us.

17:01.180 --> 17:03.480
 But if we set aside that argument

17:03.480 --> 17:05.560
 and we just raise the hypothesis

17:05.560 --> 17:09.420
 that plants have compounds that are bad for us,

17:09.420 --> 17:12.100
 but maybe by consuming them in small amounts,

17:12.100 --> 17:15.500
 they're creating this hormesis type scenario.

17:15.500 --> 17:20.060
 So then I think we conceivably solve the problem.

17:20.060 --> 17:24.360
 We could say, yes, plants are bad for us,

17:24.360 --> 17:26.980
 but in small amounts, they provide this hormetic response

17:26.980 --> 17:28.240
 and they're good for us, right?

17:28.240 --> 17:31.620
 So in the same way that too much heat is bad for us,

17:31.620 --> 17:34.060
 too much cold is bad for us, can kill us, can kill neurons,

17:34.060 --> 17:37.300
 but appropriately dosed in an intermittent challenge

17:37.300 --> 17:38.940
 type of scenarios can be good for us.

17:38.940 --> 17:41.340
 Is that how I should think about plants in these compounds?

17:41.340 --> 17:45.220
 Do you think of them as good for us or as bad for us?

17:45.220 --> 17:48.220
 They're a very sharp blade and we want to use them potently.

17:48.220 --> 17:52.120
 I actually, I think that it's almost impossible.

17:52.120 --> 17:56.080
 I mean, you'd have to eat nothing but the same plant

17:56.080 --> 17:57.780
 all day, every day in large.

17:57.780 --> 18:01.420
 I mean, the bioavailability of these compounds

18:01.420 --> 18:04.500
 in the plants, they're attached to a food matrix.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.020
 You know, it's not like taking it

18:06.020 --> 18:07.620
 in a supplement form as well.

18:07.620 --> 18:12.620
 It's such that it's very difficult to make it toxic.

18:14.740 --> 18:17.020
 Now, there are some cases, for example,

18:17.020 --> 18:19.620
 if you eat cabbage, and I think there's some group

18:19.620 --> 18:22.580
 in Africa or somewhere that that's all they eat is cabbage,

18:22.580 --> 18:24.660
 and there is a goitrogen in cabbage.

18:24.660 --> 18:26.900
 It's not sulforaphane, it's another compound,

18:26.900 --> 18:28.900
 but that's all they eat every day.

18:28.900 --> 18:29.720
 Nothing but that.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.620
 And they get, yeah, and they're like iodine deficient

18:32.620 --> 18:33.460
 on top of that.

18:33.460 --> 18:38.460
 So I do think you can, of course, make,

18:38.500 --> 18:40.460
 I mean, there are types of plants that are toxic

18:40.460 --> 18:41.780
 in small quantities, right?

18:41.780 --> 18:42.620
 I mean, that-

18:42.620 --> 18:43.460
 Hemlock.

18:43.460 --> 18:44.280
 Hemlock, exactly.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.120
 We'll kill you.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.780
 Folks, don't play this game with hemlock.

18:46.780 --> 18:49.660
 But you're not gonna get poisoned from eating,

18:49.660 --> 18:53.500
 you know, your serving of broccoli at dinner, right?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.180
 So, I mean, it depends on the plant.

18:57.300 --> 19:00.660
 These generalizations are kind of, they're just not useful.

19:00.660 --> 19:03.500
 And I think that a lot of people online,

19:03.500 --> 19:07.340
 in the blogosphere, they gravitate towards them

19:07.340 --> 19:10.900
 because it's just easier and it's a lot more sensational.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.380
 Plants, meat, and starches,

19:12.380 --> 19:15.100
 I'm one of those rare omnivores out there now.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.740
 I feel like I'm a rare, or it's rare to be an omnivore,

19:17.740 --> 19:20.420
 but I think once you step out of the social media,

19:20.420 --> 19:23.340
 as you said, the blogosphere, most people,

19:23.340 --> 19:25.980
 I would say 99% of people on the planet

19:25.980 --> 19:27.500
 are probably omnivores.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.340
 Right.

19:28.340 --> 19:29.260
 And someone will probably correct me,

19:29.260 --> 19:33.260
 but I doubt the number falls below 98.

19:33.260 --> 19:35.900
 I think if you look at data,

19:35.900 --> 19:39.180
 and when we have carnivore data,

19:39.180 --> 19:41.900
 I can't wait to see it, but right now it's a lot of,

19:41.900 --> 19:44.980
 okay, well, this is a lot of anecdotal evidence

19:44.980 --> 19:49.500
 and there's a lot of good starts with anecdotes,

19:49.500 --> 19:51.820
 but people change a thousand things at once

19:51.820 --> 19:55.140
 and they don't realize that, but they do.

19:55.140 --> 19:58.180
 And so anecdotal data is only so good, right?

19:58.180 --> 19:59.700
 It's a starting point.

19:59.700 --> 20:02.300
 And so we don't really know long-term

20:02.300 --> 20:04.340
 what carnivore diets are gonna do.

20:04.340 --> 20:06.820
 They may be beneficial short-term,

20:06.820 --> 20:09.420
 they may be beneficial for reasons of elimination

20:09.420 --> 20:11.060
 of other things, like who knows, right?

20:11.060 --> 20:12.140
 Lots of possibilities.

20:12.140 --> 20:14.140
 But I do think with respect to plants,

20:17.340 --> 20:19.700
 there's so much evidence, like for example,

20:19.700 --> 20:21.900
 sulforaphane is one that I really like

20:21.900 --> 20:25.980
 because there's just evidence that sulforaphane

20:25.980 --> 20:29.220
 is a very powerful activator of the Nrf2 pathway.

20:29.220 --> 20:31.980
 And this is a pathway that regulates a lot of genes

20:31.980 --> 20:33.100
 and a lot of genes that are related

20:33.100 --> 20:35.260
 to like glutathione production,

20:35.260 --> 20:38.220
 genes that are involved in detoxifying compounds

20:38.220 --> 20:39.540
 that we're exposed to from our food,

20:39.540 --> 20:40.860
 like heterocyclic amines.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.540
 In fact, there have been GWAS studies.

20:43.540 --> 20:45.380
 So these are genetically,

20:45.380 --> 20:48.620
 these are studies that are genome-wide associated studies

20:48.620 --> 20:51.140
 for people listening that aren't familiar.

20:51.140 --> 20:54.300
 People have a variety of versions of genes

20:54.300 --> 20:59.300
 and we have a gene that's able to make heterocyclic amines

20:59.820 --> 21:03.940
 to basically detoxify it so it's not as harmful.

21:03.940 --> 21:07.820
 And people that don't have a certain version of that

21:07.820 --> 21:09.780
 that's doing it well are very prone

21:09.780 --> 21:12.660
 to like colon cancer and increased cancer risk.

21:12.660 --> 21:14.740
 But if they eat a lot of broccoli

21:14.740 --> 21:16.860
 and cruciferous vegetables, it negates that risk

21:16.860 --> 21:18.980
 because they're getting sulforaphane,

21:18.980 --> 21:22.500
 which activates a lot of the glutathione transfer,

21:22.500 --> 21:24.940
 glutathione transferase and synthase genes.

21:24.940 --> 21:28.180
 So glutathione is a major antioxidant in our brain

21:28.180 --> 21:31.660
 and in our vascular system and our body basically.

21:31.660 --> 21:36.220
 So there's evidence that eating things

21:36.220 --> 21:39.500
 like compounds that are like sulforaphane

21:39.500 --> 21:41.700
 or broccoli or broccoli spouts,

21:41.700 --> 21:44.220
 which have like up to 100 times more sulforaphane

21:44.220 --> 21:47.140
 than broccoli are activating glutathione in the brain.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.140
 There's human evidence of that.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.220
 I mean, that's amazing.

21:49.220 --> 21:50.060
 That is amazing.

21:50.060 --> 21:51.380
 And plasma, yeah.

21:51.380 --> 21:52.220
 Sorry to interrupt.

21:52.220 --> 21:53.820
 I want to make sure when,

21:53.820 --> 21:55.740
 so broccoli sprouts are different than broccoli.

21:55.740 --> 21:58.980
 And you just told us that they have much,

21:58.980 --> 22:02.620
 they're much richer in these compounds.

22:02.620 --> 22:05.180
 So note to self, I should have broccoli sprouts,

22:05.180 --> 22:06.380
 not just broccoli.

22:06.380 --> 22:08.580
 Can we cook the broccoli and still get these nutrients

22:08.580 --> 22:09.420
 or do we have to eat it raw?

22:09.420 --> 22:12.460
 I confess eating raw broccoli is really aversive to me.

22:13.540 --> 22:17.620
 So the sulforaphane is formed

22:17.620 --> 22:19.700
 from a compound called glucoraphanin,

22:19.700 --> 22:21.580
 which is in the broccoli.

22:21.580 --> 22:23.980
 And the enzyme that converts it into sulforaphane

22:23.980 --> 22:26.700
 is myrosinase and it's heat sensitive.

22:26.700 --> 22:29.980
 So you do somewhat lower the sulforaphane levels

22:29.980 --> 22:31.900
 when you cook the broccoli.

22:31.900 --> 22:34.700
 However, there was a study a few years back

22:34.700 --> 22:37.780
 that showed adding one gram of mustard seed powder,

22:37.780 --> 22:39.780
 ground mustard seed powder,

22:39.780 --> 22:42.700
 which also contains the myrosinase enzyme,

22:42.700 --> 22:44.580
 to your cooked broccoli

22:44.580 --> 22:47.020
 increases the sulforaphane by fourfold.

22:47.020 --> 22:49.420
 So this is great.

22:49.420 --> 22:51.940
 Because I confess, I like broccoli if it's cooked

22:51.940 --> 22:54.220
 to the appropriate density,

22:54.220 --> 22:56.420
 not too mushy, but definitely not raw.

22:56.420 --> 22:58.940
 The idea of eating raw broccoli to me just sounds horrible,

22:58.940 --> 23:01.140
 but I like the way mustard seed sounds.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.820
 So just a little bit of mustard seed powder

23:03.820 --> 23:05.100
 added to the cooked broccoli

23:05.100 --> 23:07.260
 can recover some of these compounds.

23:07.260 --> 23:11.580
 Yes, so what I do is I will lightly steam my broccoli

23:11.580 --> 23:15.100
 and then I add a little bit of my Kerrygold butter

23:15.100 --> 23:18.420
 and then I add some mustard seed powder on the top of that.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.060
 And it's got a little kick.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.820
 Like it's just a little spice, you know?

23:21.820 --> 23:23.860
 And if you don't taste that, it's expired.

23:23.860 --> 23:25.620
 Like it should have a little kick.

23:25.620 --> 23:26.980
 And because I know people will want to know

23:26.980 --> 23:29.380
 how often and how much, you know,

23:29.380 --> 23:32.980
 are you eating this every day or most days of the week?

23:32.980 --> 23:37.980
 Well, I had shifted to supplementation with sulforaphane.

23:38.300 --> 23:40.940
 I'm admitting right now

23:40.940 --> 23:42.460
 that I've been terrible about it the past,

23:42.460 --> 23:44.820
 like, I don't know, six months or so.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.740
 The supplementation or the broccoli?

23:46.740 --> 23:48.100
 Yes, the supplementation.

23:48.100 --> 23:52.660
 And so there's another way to get,

23:52.660 --> 23:55.980
 there's another compound and it's actually called moringa.

23:55.980 --> 24:00.980
 And Dr. Jed Fahey, who's really the expert on sulforaphane,

24:01.460 --> 24:02.300
 he's a good friend of mine.

24:02.300 --> 24:03.700
 He's been on the podcast a couple of times.

24:03.700 --> 24:08.660
 He basically thinks and, you know,

24:08.660 --> 24:10.820
 has done a lot of research on moringa as well

24:10.820 --> 24:14.700
 that it's like a cousin and it activates the NRF2 pathway

24:14.700 --> 24:16.780
 similarly to sulforaphane.

24:16.780 --> 24:19.980
 And so I've been buying this Cooley Cooley moringa powder.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.260
 I don't have any affiliation with them.

24:21.260 --> 24:22.220
 Cooley Cooley is a brand.

24:22.220 --> 24:23.300
 Cooley Cooley is a brand.

24:23.300 --> 24:24.300
 That you have no affiliation to.

24:24.300 --> 24:25.340
 I have no affiliation,

24:25.340 --> 24:29.100
 but Jed Fahey has researched it like that specific brand.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.180
 And so it's like, it's legit, you know,

24:31.180 --> 24:32.860
 it's like science-backed

24:32.860 --> 24:35.220
 in terms of actually containing moringa

24:35.220 --> 24:39.060
 and activating NRF2 and I add it to my smoothies.

24:39.060 --> 24:41.100
 So that's what I've been doing.

24:41.100 --> 24:44.180
 What are some dose ranges?

24:44.180 --> 24:46.020
 And of course we give the usual recommendations

24:46.020 --> 24:47.260
 that people should talk to their physician,

24:47.260 --> 24:48.100
 et cetera, et cetera.

24:48.100 --> 24:51.420
 But if people are going to, what do you take?

24:51.420 --> 24:55.780
 That's always the, let's take the David Sinclairian approach

24:55.780 --> 24:58.380
 where he'll talk about what he does

24:58.380 --> 24:59.620
 as a way to deal with this.

24:59.620 --> 25:01.780
 And of course, everybody's different and should,

25:01.780 --> 25:03.740
 in all seriousness, should,

25:03.740 --> 25:07.260
 anytime you add or delete something from your consumption

25:07.260 --> 25:10.700
 should consult some trusted healthcare professional,

25:10.700 --> 25:12.180
 trusted by you.

25:12.180 --> 25:14.220
 What, do you recall the dosages?

25:14.220 --> 25:16.780
 I do a big heaping tablespoon.

25:16.780 --> 25:19.900
 So moringa, coolly coolly moringa, it sounds like a song.

25:19.900 --> 25:21.100
 It's with a K, I know.

25:23.460 --> 25:25.780
 But, you know, for people also listening,

25:25.780 --> 25:26.780
 it's like, well, why would I do that?

25:26.780 --> 25:28.340
 You know, I mentioned the glutathione in the brain.

25:28.340 --> 25:30.900
 I mentioned it in plasma.

25:30.900 --> 25:33.220
 It's been shown to lower DNA damage in people

25:33.220 --> 25:35.460
 and white blood cells.

25:35.460 --> 25:36.580
 It's also been shown,

25:36.580 --> 25:38.860
 there's been several different studies in China.

25:38.860 --> 25:40.580
 You know, in China, there's a lot of air pollution.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.660
 And I mentioned that, you know,

25:41.660 --> 25:43.820
 it's a very powerful activator of NRF2

25:43.820 --> 25:45.260
 and I know you're familiar with NRF2,

25:45.260 --> 25:48.180
 but NRF2 is like, it's your transcription factor

25:48.180 --> 25:52.500
 that is, it is binding to a little specific sequence

25:52.500 --> 25:53.780
 in a variety of different genes

25:53.780 --> 25:55.580
 and it's like turning them on,

25:55.580 --> 25:57.220
 or in some cases, turning them off.

25:57.220 --> 25:59.220
 It's regulating what's being activated

25:59.220 --> 26:01.460
 or what's not being activated or being turned off.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.100
 And some of the genes are basically

26:04.100 --> 26:06.180
 these detoxifying pathways.

26:06.180 --> 26:07.700
 We talked a little bit about the glutathione,

26:07.700 --> 26:09.220
 but there's also ones that are involved

26:09.220 --> 26:13.420
 in airborne carcinogens like benzene.

26:13.420 --> 26:15.260
 So benzene is found in air pollution,

26:15.260 --> 26:17.020
 I mean, cigarette smoke.

26:17.020 --> 26:18.580
 If you're smoking cigarettes still,

26:18.580 --> 26:19.820
 like please try to quit.

26:19.820 --> 26:20.660
 Yeah, you're mutating your DNA.

26:20.660 --> 26:21.500
 I mean, yeah.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.220
 Like just say nothing of the lung cancer,

26:23.220 --> 26:24.340
 you're mutating your DNA.

26:24.340 --> 26:26.220
 And heart disease risk, heart disease risk.

26:26.220 --> 26:29.780
 But anyways, people, and this has been repeated

26:29.780 --> 26:31.220
 in more than one study,

26:31.220 --> 26:33.980
 that literally after 24 hours of taking,

26:33.980 --> 26:35.380
 I can't remember off the top of my head

26:35.380 --> 26:39.660
 what the dose of sulforaphane from broccoli extract,

26:39.660 --> 26:44.460
 broccoli seed extract was, or broccoli sprouts extract,

26:44.460 --> 26:46.500
 not the seed, it was the sprouts.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.900
 Anyways, they started excreting

26:47.900 --> 26:50.020
 like 60% benzene and acrolein.

26:50.020 --> 26:51.500
 I mean, that's something that we get in cooked food.

26:51.500 --> 26:52.420
 It's coming out in their urine?

26:52.420 --> 26:53.940
 Coming out in their urine.

26:53.940 --> 26:54.780
 Yeah.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.620
 Well, I'm not a smoker and I have to be honest,

26:56.620 --> 26:59.420
 it's rare that I hear of a supplement for the first time

26:59.420 --> 27:02.740
 because I've been deep diving on supplements

27:02.740 --> 27:04.460
 since I was in my teens.

27:04.460 --> 27:05.940
 This is fascinating.

27:05.940 --> 27:08.980
 And it brings me back to this question that we had before.

27:08.980 --> 27:12.340
 And I appreciate that you answered it very clearly.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.180
 Plants have compounds that are good for us.

27:14.180 --> 27:15.460
 They're not just stressing us.

27:15.460 --> 27:18.500
 They're activating pathways that are reparative.

27:18.500 --> 27:19.980
 That's what I'm taking away

27:19.980 --> 27:21.260
 from everything you're telling me.

27:21.260 --> 27:22.100
 Right.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.900
 And that our bodies,

27:24.900 --> 27:27.620
 we're supposed to be getting that stress

27:27.620 --> 27:29.340
 to have those pathways activated.

27:29.340 --> 27:32.060
 Like it is like, you know, right?

27:32.060 --> 27:34.580
 I mean, this is conserved among different animals.

27:34.580 --> 27:38.540
 Like this is something that is,

27:38.540 --> 27:39.660
 it's supposed to happen.

27:39.660 --> 27:42.540
 And in our modern day world,

27:42.540 --> 27:45.380
 we don't have to eat plants.

27:45.380 --> 27:48.100
 We don't have to move anywhere or exercise.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.180
 We don't have to go through periods of not eating food

27:50.180 --> 27:52.340
 because we can have it at our fingertips at any second.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.180
 Right?

27:53.180 --> 27:57.220
 So, I mean, we've got this conundrum of

27:57.220 --> 27:59.260
 we're never activating these stress response pathways

27:59.260 --> 28:01.340
 that we're supposed to activate.

28:01.340 --> 28:02.180
 We're supposed to.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.140
 I find that fascinating.

28:03.140 --> 28:07.300
 And again, drawing a parallel to the nervous system.

28:07.300 --> 28:10.420
 So what I'm hearing you say is that historically,

28:10.420 --> 28:12.180
 we would have to go through some stress,

28:12.180 --> 28:14.180
 some confront cold or confront heat

28:14.180 --> 28:17.060
 or confront effort or hunger

28:17.060 --> 28:18.980
 and have to exercise essentially

28:18.980 --> 28:20.900
 in order to obtain these compounds.

28:20.900 --> 28:22.740
 And then those compounds are reparative.

28:22.740 --> 28:27.300
 Yeah, I feel that resembles the dopamine pathway.

28:27.300 --> 28:28.140
 I always say, you know,

28:28.140 --> 28:29.140
 there's nothing wrong with dopamine.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.620
 People think about dopamine hits as bad or dopamine is bad.

28:31.620 --> 28:33.740
 There's absolutely nothing wrong with dopamine.

28:33.740 --> 28:35.540
 The problem is dopamine,

28:35.540 --> 28:37.380
 especially high levels of dopamine,

28:38.260 --> 28:40.500
 released without the need for effort

28:40.500 --> 28:42.940
 to access that dopamine is problematic.

28:42.940 --> 28:45.220
 So a line of cocaine gives you a ton of dopamine

28:45.220 --> 28:47.500
 with no effort except to ingest the drug.

28:47.500 --> 28:51.460
 Whereas working for four years or more to get your degree

28:51.460 --> 28:53.220
 will release a lot of dopamine

28:53.220 --> 28:56.220
 and a lot of cortisol along the way, as we know.

28:56.220 --> 28:59.900
 And it's considered a healthy accomplishment in most cases.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.620
 A tremendous amount of,

29:01.620 --> 29:02.860
 we're approaching the spring

29:02.860 --> 29:04.140
 and there'll be a lot of graduations.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.020
 Weddings are coming up now that the pandemic

29:06.020 --> 29:08.100
 is kind of hopefully slowing

29:08.100 --> 29:09.500
 and there'll be a lot of dopamine.

29:09.500 --> 29:10.820
 High levels of dopamine are great,

29:10.820 --> 29:13.980
 but only after the effort of having done something

29:13.980 --> 29:14.940
 in order to access it.

29:14.940 --> 29:17.060
 And so that's what I'm taking away from what you're saying

29:17.060 --> 29:20.340
 is that we need to go through this intermittent,

29:20.340 --> 29:22.140
 the different types of intermittent challenge.

29:22.140 --> 29:26.420
 And we are rewarded with particular compounds

29:26.420 --> 29:28.380
 that are reparative both for the challenge,

29:28.380 --> 29:29.620
 but then make us stronger.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.220
 It is, hormesis really is, it seems,

29:31.220 --> 29:34.540
 the case of what doesn't kill us makes us stronger.

29:34.540 --> 29:35.860
 What, so you mentioned-

29:35.860 --> 29:37.380
 Can I add to that one thing you just said?

29:37.380 --> 29:40.500
 Because this has been shown with, for example,

29:40.500 --> 29:42.420
 sulforaphane in animal studies,

29:42.420 --> 29:44.860
 you precondition, give the animal sulforaphane

29:44.860 --> 29:47.460
 and then you expose them to like hypoxia

29:47.460 --> 29:50.060
 or some kind of ischemic stroke condition,

29:50.060 --> 29:51.620
 whatever they do to induce that.

29:51.620 --> 29:55.460
 And the sulforaphane, it basically protects them.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.900
 Like their precondition

29:56.900 --> 29:59.980
 and their stress response pathways are primed.

29:59.980 --> 30:03.060
 And so when they're then exposed to the ischemic stroke,

30:03.060 --> 30:05.740
 their outcomes are so much better,

30:05.740 --> 30:07.540
 so much better than the animals

30:07.540 --> 30:09.580
 that didn't get the sulforaphane 48 hours before,

30:09.580 --> 30:10.740
 whatever it was.

30:10.740 --> 30:13.460
 And this has been shown in multiple animal studies

30:13.460 --> 30:15.900
 with sulforaphane specifically in the brain.

30:15.900 --> 30:18.140
 I know Mark Mattson, Dr. Mark Mattson,

30:18.140 --> 30:21.900
 he's often thought of as the intermittent fasting king,

30:21.900 --> 30:26.100
 but he's a neuroscientist and he did publish some work

30:26.100 --> 30:28.180
 and talks about sulforaphane as well.

30:28.180 --> 30:30.940
 I'm really glad you brought that example up

30:30.940 --> 30:34.100
 because many of the questions I get on social media

30:34.100 --> 30:36.700
 and elsewhere are about traumatic brain injury

30:36.700 --> 30:40.500
 and TBI is just one example.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.980
 And people always think, oh, sports, it's football.

30:42.980 --> 30:44.820
 Whenever you say TBI, people always think football.

30:44.820 --> 30:48.820
 And I just want to just take a moment to editorialize.

30:48.820 --> 30:51.220
 90% or more of traumatic brain injury

30:51.220 --> 30:54.940
 is construction work, at-home accidents.

30:54.940 --> 30:56.140
 Football players are,

30:56.140 --> 30:59.500
 hockey players are, martial artists are a tiny fraction

30:59.500 --> 31:03.060
 of the people who have TBI and concussion of various kinds.

31:03.060 --> 31:05.260
 It just so happens that within those communities,

31:05.260 --> 31:08.060
 many of them, 75% or more, experience those.

31:08.060 --> 31:09.740
 So it's salient within those communities,

31:09.740 --> 31:12.260
 but concussion is prominent.

31:12.260 --> 31:13.100
 People are always asking,

31:13.100 --> 31:17.060
 what can I do in order to offset brain injury?

31:17.060 --> 31:19.100
 I had a concussion two years ago, what can I do?

31:19.100 --> 31:21.100
 And it's been a tough question

31:21.100 --> 31:23.280
 because we really don't have anything for them.

31:23.280 --> 31:27.020
 I mean, you tell them sleep well, eat well, exercise,

31:27.020 --> 31:30.180
 but it sounds like some of these reparative pathways

31:30.180 --> 31:33.300
 either should be explored in the context of brain injury

31:33.300 --> 31:35.020
 or I'm guessing are being explored

31:35.020 --> 31:36.140
 in the context of brain injury.

31:36.140 --> 31:38.100
 Yeah, so a couple of things there.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.820
 One is that, I mean, traumatic brain injury,

31:40.820 --> 31:43.260
 I mean, it's terrible, but it's also,

31:43.260 --> 31:45.380
 it's so interesting because it's also

31:45.380 --> 31:48.660
 like literal real-time brain aging.

31:48.660 --> 31:50.100
 Like, you know, like it's,

31:50.100 --> 31:52.620
 you're able to like accelerate it and understand.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.300
 So I often think of,

31:54.300 --> 31:56.220
 when I think of traumatic brain injury,

31:56.220 --> 31:59.020
 I think of so much overlap between Alzheimer's disease

31:59.020 --> 32:01.020
 and dementia and these neurodegenerative diseases

32:01.020 --> 32:04.820
 because there are a lot of similarities there, you know?

32:04.820 --> 32:08.060
 And so sulforaphane, I personally think,

32:08.060 --> 32:11.060
 and I do think there's been some animal research with TBI,

32:11.060 --> 32:13.780
 I mean, and sulforaphane,

32:13.780 --> 32:17.580
 mostly preconditioning rather than treatment.

32:17.580 --> 32:20.260
 So again, it's like, well, I mean, if you're gonna,

32:20.260 --> 32:21.700
 if you want a healthy lifestyle thing

32:21.700 --> 32:22.940
 and you're a construction worker

32:22.940 --> 32:25.300
 or you're fill in the blank, that's, you know, gonna,

32:25.300 --> 32:26.700
 I mean, anyone that drives into a car,

32:26.700 --> 32:28.220
 I mean, you're at risk to some degree, right?

32:28.220 --> 32:29.060
 Or bicycle.

32:29.060 --> 32:29.900
 Bicycle, yeah.

32:29.900 --> 32:31.460
 Around Stanford, we have, you know,

32:31.460 --> 32:34.420
 I would say people demonize motorcycles.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.940
 People demonize a lot of things,

32:35.940 --> 32:39.820
 but moving fast through space on a small object

32:39.820 --> 32:43.340
 next to a 3,000 pound vehicle, I mean, we've lost,

32:43.340 --> 32:44.600
 we have a number of friends that have died.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.740
 We have a number of people with traumatic brain injury.

32:46.740 --> 32:48.200
 I'm not against cycling or cyclists,

32:48.200 --> 32:53.200
 but it is, it's a risky sport by any stretch.

32:53.740 --> 32:56.780
 So in taking things like moringa

32:56.780 --> 32:59.240
 or eating my broccoli sprouts,

32:59.240 --> 33:00.380
 maybe cooking them a little less

33:00.380 --> 33:01.380
 than I'm currently cooking them,

33:01.380 --> 33:03.180
 putting on the mustard seed,

33:04.380 --> 33:05.980
 is there evidence that,

33:05.980 --> 33:09.500
 well, first of all, NRF2 is expressed in neurons, right?

33:09.500 --> 33:11.100
 So those cells should be protected.

33:11.100 --> 33:12.460
 Are there other cells of the body

33:12.460 --> 33:15.900
 that could possibly gain protection from these pathways?

33:15.900 --> 33:20.900
 Well, lungs, for one, but just even in plasma cells,

33:21.180 --> 33:22.940
 I mean, I think it's pretty,

33:22.940 --> 33:25.940
 NRF2 is pretty ubiquitously expressed.

33:25.940 --> 33:28.340
 Liver, so there's, I mean,

33:28.340 --> 33:29.700
 there's so many animal studies

33:29.700 --> 33:30.660
 that have looked at all those things.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.660
 I try to kind of gravitate towards human ones

33:32.660 --> 33:34.500
 because it's a lot more relevant.

33:35.860 --> 33:37.180
 But I think, you know, overall,

33:37.180 --> 33:40.420
 like I mentioned, you know, DNA damage lower,

33:40.420 --> 33:44.980
 it's like 24 or 34% lower in human blood cells

33:44.980 --> 33:49.140
 after broccoli sprout powder supplementation.

33:49.140 --> 33:53.180
 And I made a video on this like years ago, 2016 maybe,

33:53.180 --> 33:54.900
 and I think I have like the references on there

33:54.900 --> 33:56.860
 to exact amounts, I can't remember.

33:56.860 --> 34:00.420
 But it's kind of an old video, it's 2016.

34:00.420 --> 34:02.620
 But I also had Jed on the podcast

34:02.620 --> 34:04.660
 and he did talk about this.

34:04.660 --> 34:05.980
 But you know, it's also been shown

34:05.980 --> 34:07.100
 in randomized controlled trials

34:07.100 --> 34:09.380
 to help treat autism and autistic symptoms.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.440
 And yet again, it's doing interesting things in the brain.

34:12.440 --> 34:15.940
 And I think it does have something to do

34:15.940 --> 34:18.180
 with the oxidative stress and the glutathione,

34:18.180 --> 34:21.300
 which would be relevant for TBI treatment.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.540
 It hasn't been shown empirically

34:23.540 --> 34:25.440
 that that helps with treatment,

34:25.440 --> 34:28.300
 but I do think someone could do that study.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.860
 I think that it should be done, honestly,

34:31.860 --> 34:33.260
 because it's a low-hanging fruit.

34:33.260 --> 34:34.880
 I mean, if there's any impact,

34:34.880 --> 34:37.100
 and there is at least one preliminary study

34:37.100 --> 34:39.100
 that glutathione is increased in the brain

34:39.100 --> 34:43.580
 after humans are basically taking sulforaphane, so.

34:43.580 --> 34:45.180
 Which is really, for people listening,

34:45.180 --> 34:47.340
 that's so important because a number of compounds

34:47.340 --> 34:49.080
 that people take in supplement form

34:49.080 --> 34:50.940
 don't cross the blood brain barrier,

34:50.940 --> 34:52.620
 or they get metabolized in ways

34:52.620 --> 34:55.260
 that what's listed on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant

34:55.260 --> 34:57.420
 for what your cells actually experience.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.460
 So that's very reassuring.

34:59.460 --> 35:00.800
 We will get back to heat and cold

35:00.800 --> 35:02.420
 and this theme that I tried to surface,

35:02.420 --> 35:03.840
 but I just find this too interesting

35:03.840 --> 35:08.460
 to diverge at this point from these themes.

35:08.460 --> 35:11.740
 So what other compounds or micronutrients

35:11.740 --> 35:16.580
 do you place in the top tier of useful, interesting,

35:17.700 --> 35:18.700
 there are animal studies,

35:18.700 --> 35:21.140
 maybe there are hopefully also some human studies.

35:21.140 --> 35:22.700
 We've talked about a few.

35:22.700 --> 35:25.180
 I know you've talked a lot about omega-3 fatty acids.

35:25.180 --> 35:27.900
 So if you had to do your kind of top three,

35:28.740 --> 35:32.760
 your superstars of nutrients for the brain and body,

35:32.760 --> 35:35.060
 sounds like we've got one set.

35:35.060 --> 35:37.280
 What would you put in alongside them?

35:37.280 --> 35:40.500
 Omega-3, the marine omega-3 fatty acids.

35:40.500 --> 35:45.500
 So these are found in marine types of animals,

35:45.540 --> 35:47.820
 fish, cold water fish, fatty fish.

35:47.820 --> 35:50.020
 So there's three fatty acids.

35:50.020 --> 35:53.460
 There's one from a plant and that's often referred to

35:53.460 --> 35:56.580
 as ALA, people call it short, affilinoic acid.

35:56.580 --> 35:59.100
 And then there's eicosapentaenoic acid,

35:59.100 --> 36:02.380
 or EPA, and docahexaenoic acid, which is DHA.

36:02.380 --> 36:03.220
 Yeah, but EPA-

36:03.220 --> 36:04.060
 I'm amazed you can pronounce two

36:04.060 --> 36:06.900
 of the most difficult words to pronounce right next to it

36:06.900 --> 36:09.180
 and spell right next to ophthalmology,

36:09.180 --> 36:10.620
 which if you can spell it.

36:10.620 --> 36:12.220
 I know people who have appointments

36:12.220 --> 36:13.420
 in ophthalmology departments

36:13.420 --> 36:15.660
 that don't know how to spell ophthalmology.

36:15.660 --> 36:18.580
 Little secret, there's an extra P in there.

36:18.580 --> 36:23.040
 So the ALA, I'm not going to attempt to pronounce it

36:23.040 --> 36:24.560
 because your pronunciation was perfect,

36:24.560 --> 36:26.580
 of both of these two compounds.

36:26.580 --> 36:28.160
 And you said are marine sources.

36:28.160 --> 36:30.620
 So fish, so sardines, cod, this sort of thing.

36:30.620 --> 36:31.940
 But what about krill?

36:31.940 --> 36:33.220
 I've seen krill oil.

36:33.220 --> 36:34.980
 And there was a few years back,

36:34.980 --> 36:36.840
 people were saying krill is a better source

36:36.840 --> 36:41.340
 for omega-3s than is fish oil.

36:41.340 --> 36:46.340
 I took some krill oil capsules, made me itch all over.

36:46.380 --> 36:47.220
 So I stopped.

36:47.220 --> 36:48.300
 Do you have a shellfish allergy?

36:48.300 --> 36:49.500
 No, I don't think so.

36:49.500 --> 36:50.340
 I don't think so.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.160
 I'm not a big fan of shellfish,

36:51.160 --> 36:53.220
 but I like, you know, I'll have oysters every now and again,

36:53.220 --> 36:55.780
 or shrimp or something and feel fine, so.

36:55.780 --> 36:57.040
 Yeah, we can talk about sources.

36:57.040 --> 37:02.040
 So krill is a source mostly of a type of DHA and EPA

37:02.040 --> 37:04.320
 that's in phospholipid form.

37:04.320 --> 37:08.200
 So it's a phosphatidylcholine omega-3 fatty acid.

37:08.200 --> 37:12.640
 And that's different than most of the,

37:12.640 --> 37:14.600
 well, if we're talking about fish oil supplements,

37:14.600 --> 37:15.440
 that's a different story.

37:15.440 --> 37:18.800
 But if you're talking about comparing fish to eating krill,

37:18.800 --> 37:19.640
 like we're talking about the foods.

37:19.640 --> 37:20.480
 Oh, I would never eat krill.

37:20.480 --> 37:21.800
 Okay, are we talking about the supplements?

37:21.800 --> 37:22.640
 Okay, so fish oil supplements.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.480
 Yes, I apologize.

37:23.480 --> 37:27.400
 Yeah, krill supplement versus fish oil supplement.

37:27.400 --> 37:31.080
 And if it fits, if it's a fish oil supplement,

37:31.080 --> 37:33.600
 if it fits in the conversation,

37:33.600 --> 37:37.920
 talking about great sources of omega-3s in their whole form,

37:37.920 --> 37:41.440
 I have a bad feeling you're going to tell me sardines.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.440
 Sardines are, yeah, they're awesome.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.920
 Anyways, except for the taste.

37:45.920 --> 37:48.260
 And for the potential contaminants,

37:49.080 --> 37:50.880
 mercury, I think, was one.

37:50.880 --> 37:52.820
 No, Joe was, yeah, it was mercury.

37:52.820 --> 37:55.400
 And Joe was telling me about,

37:55.400 --> 37:56.680
 like he used to eat sardines every day.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.640
 Joe Rogan was telling me that he used to eat sardines

37:58.640 --> 38:02.840
 every day, and then he had really high mercury levels.

38:02.840 --> 38:06.520
 And I was really shocked, because sardines are low

38:06.520 --> 38:09.560
 in the fish groups.

38:09.560 --> 38:12.880
 So the higher up you get, swordfish and sharks,

38:12.880 --> 38:13.720
 really high mercury,

38:13.720 --> 38:16.200
 because they're eating all the other fish, right?

38:16.200 --> 38:18.440
 But I think some brands,

38:18.440 --> 38:20.840
 and if you look at Consumer Lab,

38:20.840 --> 38:23.200
 Consumer Lab, it's like a third-party site

38:23.200 --> 38:25.800
 that I'm affiliated with, but I use them

38:25.800 --> 38:29.360
 because they do a lot of analysis of different foods

38:29.360 --> 38:30.240
 and supplements.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.720
 And so you can look at some of their sardines,

38:32.720 --> 38:35.600
 and they have a list of ones that are pretty decent.

38:35.600 --> 38:37.800
 But anyways, back to your question

38:37.800 --> 38:41.400
 about fish oil supplements versus krill oil supplements.

38:41.400 --> 38:46.200
 So one of the major differences is that fish oil supplements,

38:46.200 --> 38:50.200
 if you get a high-quality one, it's in a triglyceride form.

38:50.200 --> 38:54.920
 So you've got a glycerol backbone with three fatty acids,

38:54.920 --> 38:58.360
 and that's attached, and those are either DHA or the EPA.

39:00.480 --> 39:03.280
 Or if you have a lower-quality fish oil supplement,

39:03.280 --> 39:05.840
 then you have what's called ethyl ester form.

39:05.840 --> 39:07.560
 And typically, the reason for that,

39:07.560 --> 39:10.800
 it's when fish oil is purified,

39:10.800 --> 39:13.760
 it's run through this column with alcohol or something,

39:13.760 --> 39:15.720
 they cleave it off the glycerol backbone,

39:15.720 --> 39:18.000
 and then it's just kind of easier to leave it like that

39:18.000 --> 39:20.600
 than re-esterifying it, which costs more money.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.600
 So you can get it in ethyl ester form,

39:22.600 --> 39:25.600
 which isn't as bioavailable.

39:25.600 --> 39:28.200
 And in fact, if you don't take it with food,

39:28.200 --> 39:29.280
 you're going to be in trouble.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.880
 You're not going to absorb much of it at all.

39:31.880 --> 39:33.400
 Would you see this on the packaging?

39:33.400 --> 39:35.920
 Is it going to say it's in this ethyl form?

39:35.920 --> 39:40.120
 Some fish oil brands will put it on their website,

39:40.120 --> 39:43.000
 perhaps on their packaging, but most of the time,

39:43.000 --> 39:46.520
 you'll have to dig for it on the website and or call them.

39:46.520 --> 39:49.640
 But I think, for the most part, ones that are higher end

39:49.640 --> 39:51.920
 will market it like triglyceride form.

39:51.920 --> 39:53.480
 And it's not that ethyl ester is bad,

39:53.480 --> 39:54.480
 it just means take it with food.

39:54.480 --> 39:59.480
 So one of the major prescription omega-3s out there

39:59.600 --> 40:01.040
 is both of them, actually.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.720
 Lavazza, which is a mixture of DHA and EPA,

40:04.720 --> 40:07.360
 as well as Vasipa, which is a highly purified EPA.

40:07.360 --> 40:10.440
 These are both prescribed by physicians to patients

40:10.440 --> 40:12.200
 with hypertriglyceridemia.

40:12.200 --> 40:14.960
 So high triglycerides, among other things,

40:14.960 --> 40:18.640
 I think maybe dysregulation of lipids as well.

40:18.640 --> 40:22.120
 This is amazing for people, so these are prescription drugs

40:22.120 --> 40:25.500
 that are essentially very high potency purified omega-3s,

40:25.500 --> 40:27.920
 but they're given to people for lipid issues.

40:27.920 --> 40:31.100
 So this is the treatment of issues with fat metabolism

40:31.100 --> 40:32.640
 by giving people fat.

40:32.640 --> 40:35.200
 Just to really, I just want to push home,

40:35.200 --> 40:36.840
 again, I'm not carnivore keto or anything,

40:36.840 --> 40:41.240
 I'm an omnivore, but to just push home that we,

40:41.240 --> 40:43.200
 one thing that's so wonderful that you've done

40:43.200 --> 40:44.880
 over the years and that you continue to do

40:44.880 --> 40:49.880
 is to move away from these very broad sweeping statements

40:49.920 --> 40:51.200
 about fat is bad.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.680
 I mean, here's a case where we're saying fat

40:52.680 --> 40:56.420
 is not only good, it can be used to combat issues

40:56.420 --> 40:57.880
 with that metabolism.

40:57.880 --> 41:02.120
 And then fats are not just one thing, they're many things.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.200
 So anyway, I just want to put a little highlighter

41:04.200 --> 41:06.180
 and a point of appreciation there and make sure

41:06.180 --> 41:10.520
 that people are sensitized to the fact that if you hear

41:10.520 --> 41:13.080
 that fat is bad, you have to ask what kind of fat, right?

41:13.080 --> 41:15.400
 And here we're talking about these omega-3s.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.680
 Okay, so the triglyceride form can be taken

41:17.680 --> 41:22.480
 with or without food, and there's prescription forms.

41:22.480 --> 41:25.480
 What's, I can't get, I don't know if I can get ahold

41:25.480 --> 41:27.380
 of the prescription form unless-

41:27.380 --> 41:28.680
 You have high triglycerides.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.640
 Or I have a friend with high triglycerides.

41:30.640 --> 41:33.280
 It's illegal folks, don't share prescription drugs.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.600
 Or you talk to your doctor and you say,

41:34.600 --> 41:36.600
 I'm already taking this from,

41:36.600 --> 41:37.520
 I mean, I don't know how it works.

41:37.520 --> 41:38.360
 Anyways.

41:38.360 --> 41:40.960
 What's the dosage that you recommend people get?

41:40.960 --> 41:41.800
 So-

41:41.800 --> 41:42.720
 One way or another.

41:42.720 --> 41:43.560
 All right.

41:43.560 --> 41:46.080
 Okay, so the dosage that physicians prescribe

41:46.080 --> 41:50.040
 for high triglycerides, for example, is four grams a day.

41:50.040 --> 41:51.440
 Four grams of EPA?

41:51.440 --> 41:55.160
 Of, yes, of the Veseepa.

41:55.160 --> 41:58.240
 I think Lavazza's also prescribed at four grams a day.

41:58.240 --> 42:01.800
 And you can get either of those from your physician.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.360
 My father-in-law just got one of them prescribed

42:03.360 --> 42:05.580
 because we were buying our own omega-3 for years and years.

42:05.580 --> 42:07.040
 It's like, hey, you can actually get this

42:07.040 --> 42:08.560
 and health insurance can cover it.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.960
 And it's a really purified form,

42:09.960 --> 42:11.200
 but you have to take it with food.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.000
 That was the bottom line.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.540
 I've totally gone on tangents,

42:14.540 --> 42:16.880
 but you're asking more interesting questions anyways.

42:16.880 --> 42:18.560
 Well, normally I ask about mechanism

42:18.560 --> 42:21.000
 and then I talk about protocols, but in the-

42:21.000 --> 42:21.840
 Or the why.

42:21.840 --> 42:22.680
 Or the why.

42:22.680 --> 42:23.760
 I mean, we haven't gotten there yet.

42:23.760 --> 42:25.960
 But I think that, and we definitely will get there,

42:25.960 --> 42:27.800
 but I think a number of people nowadays

42:27.800 --> 42:30.620
 are just really excited about what they can do

42:30.620 --> 42:31.460
 for their health.

42:31.460 --> 42:34.560
 And so here we're just raising the importance of omega-3s

42:34.560 --> 42:35.760
 and then we'll definitely get to the why

42:35.760 --> 42:37.040
 and the underlying mechanism.

42:37.040 --> 42:39.160
 I think four grams is,

42:39.160 --> 42:44.160
 I mean, and in fact, Bill Harris, Dr. Bill Harris,

42:44.720 --> 42:46.280
 he's just one of the pioneers

42:46.280 --> 42:47.920
 on omega-3 fatty acid research.

42:47.920 --> 42:51.320
 He was on our podcast last August.

42:51.320 --> 42:54.460
 And he was saying the reason FDA chose that

42:54.460 --> 42:56.720
 was literally just because how much

42:56.720 --> 42:58.200
 they could get people to take.

42:59.480 --> 43:00.800
 It wasn't like an upper end,

43:00.800 --> 43:02.880
 oh, anything above that is unsafe.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.400
 That wasn't the case.

43:04.400 --> 43:07.640
 I mean, it was just purely cost

43:07.640 --> 43:11.080
 and like compliance.

43:11.080 --> 43:13.080
 So like what they can get into a pill,

43:13.080 --> 43:13.900
 the amount they can get

43:13.900 --> 43:15.960
 and how many pills they can get people to take.

43:15.960 --> 43:18.400
 I'm smiling because our good friend,

43:18.400 --> 43:20.560
 Sachin Panda at the Salk Institute,

43:20.560 --> 43:22.720
 who's done a lot of important work on intermittent fasting

43:22.720 --> 43:26.720
 and other incredible work on circadian rhythms, et cetera.

43:26.720 --> 43:29.040
 When I was talking to him in preparation

43:29.040 --> 43:31.160
 for an episode on intermittent fasting,

43:31.160 --> 43:33.360
 I said, why the eight hour feeding window?

43:33.360 --> 43:34.980
 And he said, well, the graduate student

43:34.980 --> 43:37.240
 who ran those studies had a partner,

43:37.240 --> 43:38.880
 I think it was a girlfriend as I recall,

43:38.880 --> 43:40.240
 hope I didn't get that backward.

43:40.240 --> 43:42.860
 And the partner said, listen,

43:42.860 --> 43:45.740
 you can be in lab 10 hours a day,

43:45.740 --> 43:47.480
 but you can't be in lab 14 hours a day

43:47.480 --> 43:49.200
 if you want this relationship to work.

43:49.200 --> 43:50.940
 And so it was eight hours of feeding window

43:50.940 --> 43:53.580
 plus some measurements and time to walk into the lab,

43:53.580 --> 43:54.760
 park the car, et cetera.

43:54.760 --> 43:56.080
 And so the eight hour feeding window

43:56.080 --> 43:57.840
 that everyone holds so wholly

43:57.840 --> 44:00.580
 was actually just born out of this relationship

44:00.580 --> 44:02.000
 between these two graduate students.

44:02.000 --> 44:03.600
 Had they been single,

44:03.600 --> 44:05.400
 I was single all through graduate school

44:05.400 --> 44:06.560
 or most of it anyway.

44:06.560 --> 44:07.700
 And I lived in the lab.

44:07.700 --> 44:09.280
 So if it'd been me, we'd all be,

44:09.280 --> 44:11.760
 intermittent fasting would mean eating 14 hours a day.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.360
 That was a joke, not a good one,

44:13.360 --> 44:15.280
 but I just want to make clear I'm joking.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.160
 But the point that you're making is a really good one

44:17.160 --> 44:22.160
 that the four gram amount is not a threshold

44:23.120 --> 44:25.200
 based on anything except the threshold

44:25.200 --> 44:28.400
 of people's willingness to actually take the stop.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.900
 So, and I think that's important for people to hear

44:30.900 --> 44:33.200
 because so often we hear the eight hour feeding window,

44:33.200 --> 44:37.480
 four grams of EPA, you know, 150 minutes of cardio.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.180
 And it's really a question of what you can reasonably do

44:40.180 --> 44:41.460
 in a study.

44:41.460 --> 44:42.840
 So I take four grams a day.

44:42.840 --> 44:44.880
 I take two in the morning, two grams in the morning

44:44.880 --> 44:46.280
 and I take two grams in the evening.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.960
 I take my EPA in the morning

44:47.960 --> 44:49.800
 and I take my DHA in the evening.

44:49.800 --> 44:50.720
 You split them.

44:50.720 --> 44:53.440
 I do, I don't know if,

44:53.440 --> 44:55.960
 I don't think it's necessary, not necessarily.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.080
 I just happen to buy,

44:57.080 --> 44:59.080
 I happen to get a certain fish oil supplement

44:59.080 --> 45:00.480
 that's like separates them.

45:00.480 --> 45:02.740
 And so, you know, like Lavazza,

45:02.740 --> 45:04.720
 Lavazza is a great one and it's all like in one

45:04.720 --> 45:05.560
 and it's easier.

45:05.560 --> 45:07.040
 What if someone doesn't have a prescription?

45:07.040 --> 45:09.720
 So I take over the counter fish oil.

45:09.720 --> 45:10.940
 I know I feel better

45:10.940 --> 45:12.640
 because I've done the experiment of going on and off.

45:12.640 --> 45:14.980
 I take the mainly for, I don't have depression,

45:14.980 --> 45:18.120
 but my mood is better.

45:18.120 --> 45:19.640
 My joints feel better.

45:19.640 --> 45:21.440
 I just feel better.

45:21.440 --> 45:23.480
 And I like to think that my platelets are slipperier

45:23.480 --> 45:27.760
 and they're cruising through any little obstructions

45:27.760 --> 45:29.000
 in my veins or arteries.

45:29.000 --> 45:30.360
 That's the image I have in my head,

45:30.360 --> 45:32.440
 but I don't have any data to support that part.

45:32.440 --> 45:33.280
 Yeah.

45:33.280 --> 45:35.240
 I mean, so if you're asking for like,

45:35.240 --> 45:36.640
 where do people get these?

45:36.640 --> 45:38.400
 Well, let's say I look at the bottle

45:38.400 --> 45:41.760
 and it says two grams per serving,

45:41.760 --> 45:46.760
 but then I look and it's 750 milligrams of EPA, right?

45:48.080 --> 45:49.600
 Or a thousand milligrams of EPA.

45:49.600 --> 45:50.800
 Let's say half of it is EPA.

45:50.800 --> 45:53.780
 Then do I want to hit a threshold of EPA

45:53.780 --> 45:58.780
 or a threshold of what's listed on the bottle, right?

45:58.780 --> 46:00.560
 On the front of the bottle.

46:00.560 --> 46:02.620
 And because my understanding is that we need

46:02.620 --> 46:05.220
 to hit a threshold level of EPA

46:05.220 --> 46:08.260
 in order to derive these important benefits.

46:08.260 --> 46:11.460
 I think two grams is a good threshold.

46:11.460 --> 46:15.460
 Now, the International Fish Oil Standards, IFSO,

46:17.160 --> 46:20.220
 they have a website where they do third-party testing

46:20.220 --> 46:23.860
 of a ton of different fish oil supplements

46:23.860 --> 46:25.380
 from around the world.

46:25.380 --> 46:29.320
 And they measure the concentration of the omega-3 fatty acids

46:29.320 --> 46:30.460
 in the actual supplement

46:30.460 --> 46:33.780
 because nothing is ever what it says on the bottle.

46:33.780 --> 46:36.620
 And then they also measure contaminants.

46:36.620 --> 46:38.960
 So mercury, PCBs, dioxins,

46:38.960 --> 46:41.340
 things that you'd find potentially in fish

46:41.340 --> 46:43.340
 that are harmful to humans.

46:43.340 --> 46:47.580
 And they also measure mercury and then oxidized fatty acids.

46:47.580 --> 46:49.500
 So these omega-3 fatty acids

46:49.500 --> 46:51.740
 are polyunsaturated fatty acids,

46:51.740 --> 46:54.360
 which are extremely prone to oxidation.

46:54.360 --> 46:57.380
 So please keep your fish oil in the refrigerator

46:57.380 --> 46:58.460
 because it's colder.

46:58.460 --> 46:59.780
 Yeah, they're extremely prone.

46:59.780 --> 47:01.620
 Mine's in the cupboard, so now I know.

47:01.620 --> 47:03.940
 The shelf life's increased.

47:03.940 --> 47:05.540
 It's lower oxidation.

47:05.540 --> 47:06.380
 It makes perfect sense.

47:06.380 --> 47:07.700
 Right.

47:07.700 --> 47:10.420
 So anyways, they measure that.

47:10.420 --> 47:12.180
 And I typically like to look for,

47:12.180 --> 47:13.920
 they give you a total oxidation number.

47:13.920 --> 47:15.620
 It's called TOTOX.

47:15.620 --> 47:19.180
 No, T-O-T-O-X, TOTOX is what we call it for short.

47:19.180 --> 47:23.540
 And I like it to be at the least under 10, ideally under six.

47:23.540 --> 47:26.860
 It's really hard to find all the right mixtures of things.

47:26.860 --> 47:30.140
 But people can go to this website

47:30.140 --> 47:31.740
 and they can browse through the products.

47:31.740 --> 47:34.380
 I have put together an Excel sheet,

47:34.380 --> 47:37.700
 which I have a YouTube little screencast

47:37.700 --> 47:40.060
 that I'm yet to publish, press the publish button on.

47:40.060 --> 47:42.580
 But it basically, you have to go back and check and update

47:42.580 --> 47:44.980
 because these are from different lot numbers

47:44.980 --> 47:45.940
 of the products.

47:45.940 --> 47:48.960
 They do have up to like 20, 27 or something.

47:48.960 --> 47:51.780
 And so I've gone through and found my top picks

47:51.780 --> 47:54.580
 of high EPA brands and high DHA brands

47:54.580 --> 47:57.380
 if I were to buy some, the ones that I would choose

47:57.380 --> 47:59.740
 because of the low total oxidation

47:59.740 --> 48:02.380
 and the high concentration of either EPA or DHA.

48:02.380 --> 48:05.220
 Now, people can go and do this themselves.

48:05.220 --> 48:06.240
 It just takes some work.

48:06.240 --> 48:07.900
 No, I'm glad that you did the work.

48:07.900 --> 48:12.900
 I'm going to put up a tweet every week with you tagged

48:13.300 --> 48:15.180
 until this list is published online.

48:15.180 --> 48:16.980
 Sorry, Rhonda, but I'm going to do it.

48:16.980 --> 48:18.380
 I know it's very sadistic of me,

48:18.380 --> 48:21.180
 but in service to the community and myself.

48:21.180 --> 48:23.100
 And I chose five brands from each and I tried to choose.

48:23.100 --> 48:25.460
 I tried to find one in like Europe and one in Canada.

48:25.460 --> 48:28.580
 So there was like a great selection of US and other.

48:28.580 --> 48:31.260
 I don't want to do that work and I trust you.

48:31.260 --> 48:35.020
 So yeah, I try and get two grams per day of EPA

48:35.020 --> 48:36.180
 from supplementation.

48:36.180 --> 48:38.000
 I'll now put it in the refrigerator.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.840
 Mood is better.

48:38.840 --> 48:42.000
 I made that decision mainly based on the data

48:42.000 --> 48:45.380
 that I'm aware of looking at comparison

48:45.380 --> 48:47.980
 of people doing that anywhere from two to four grams

48:47.980 --> 48:51.460
 of EPA per day compared to SSRIs,

48:51.460 --> 48:54.060
 serotonin selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors

48:54.060 --> 48:55.700
 and treatment of depression.

48:55.700 --> 48:57.940
 And I don't want to take an SSRI if I don't have to.

48:57.940 --> 48:59.220
 And fortunately I don't have to,

48:59.220 --> 49:02.140
 but the data by my read are remarkable.

49:02.140 --> 49:04.460
 People that take these things in sufficient doses,

49:04.460 --> 49:08.860
 meaning the EPAs are able to get by with much lower dosages

49:08.860 --> 49:11.500
 of SSRIs for depression relief,

49:11.500 --> 49:14.340
 or in some cases to come off their SSRIs completely

49:14.340 --> 49:18.060
 or avoid going on antidepressant medication.

49:18.060 --> 49:20.280
 Now, of course, this is not something people should cowboy.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.080
 You know, mental health issues are serious,

49:22.080 --> 49:25.880
 but what other reasons,

49:25.880 --> 49:27.960
 I'd love your thoughts on that, on the mental health part.

49:27.960 --> 49:30.440
 And so maybe you could tell us what are some things

49:30.440 --> 49:33.020
 that getting two to four grams of EPA per day

49:33.020 --> 49:35.960
 is going to help with in our brain and the rest of our body?

49:35.960 --> 49:37.880
 So do you know?

49:37.880 --> 49:41.400
 So I actually published a paper back in 2015

49:41.400 --> 49:45.360
 about the role of omega-3 and vitamin D in depression,

49:45.360 --> 49:49.560
 bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and impulsive behavior.

49:49.560 --> 49:52.760
 But so like within that paper,

49:52.760 --> 49:55.000
 like doing background research,

49:55.000 --> 49:56.200
 and this was a review article, by the way,

49:56.200 --> 49:58.040
 I was just connecting dots because I love it.

49:58.040 --> 49:59.040
 I'm going to grab it.

49:59.040 --> 50:00.500
 I confess I don't know the paper,

50:00.500 --> 50:03.420
 but I love quality reviews

50:03.420 --> 50:06.080
 because the references they're in are so useful.

50:06.080 --> 50:09.480
 Well, there's a huge role for inflammation,

50:09.480 --> 50:11.600
 and the cause of inflammation and depression.

50:11.600 --> 50:15.080
 And I think we did a short animated video on this as well

50:15.080 --> 50:18.260
 like years ago back when I was publishing that work

50:18.260 --> 50:22.200
 where people are injected with lipopolysaccharide.

50:22.200 --> 50:24.880
 I mean, this is something that we're generating

50:24.880 --> 50:28.480
 from our gut, mostly from our gut permeability,

50:28.480 --> 50:30.680
 which happens a lot.

50:30.680 --> 50:32.080
 Endotoxin, it's also called,

50:32.080 --> 50:34.080
 it's like it's endotoxin lipopolysaccharide.

50:34.080 --> 50:36.800
 It's basically the outer membrane of bacterial cells

50:36.800 --> 50:38.520
 when bacteria die.

50:38.520 --> 50:40.240
 So like when the immune cells in our gut

50:40.240 --> 50:42.160
 come into contact with the bacteria

50:42.160 --> 50:46.360
 because we drank alcohol five days in a row or whatever,

50:47.320 --> 50:49.920
 we release endotoxin or something stressed us out.

50:49.920 --> 50:51.980
 We release endotoxin into our body,

50:51.980 --> 50:53.440
 and that causes inflammation.

50:53.440 --> 50:56.760
 And so you can inject people with lipopolysaccharide

50:56.760 --> 50:58.800
 and cause depressive symptoms.

50:58.800 --> 51:01.660
 However, if you take those same cohort of people,

51:01.660 --> 51:02.760
 give them EPA,

51:02.760 --> 51:04.840
 and I think it was somewhere around two grams,

51:04.840 --> 51:06.640
 and then inject them with lipopolysaccharide.

51:06.640 --> 51:09.040
 You're establishing causation here, right?

51:09.040 --> 51:11.480
 It totally, the depressive symptoms versus the placebo.

51:11.480 --> 51:13.480
 So the placebo was saline control.

51:13.480 --> 51:15.000
 So this was a placebo control

51:15.000 --> 51:18.040
 because obviously it's hugely important for depression.

51:18.040 --> 51:20.160
 It ameliorated the depressive symptoms

51:20.160 --> 51:21.840
 that was caused by lipopolysaccharide.

51:21.840 --> 51:25.880
 Amazing, and LPS, lipopolysaccharide, is no joke.

51:25.880 --> 51:28.440
 Years ago, when I was working on thermal regulation,

51:29.940 --> 51:33.200
 we would inject animals with LPS to induce fever.

51:34.760 --> 51:36.200
 The vagus nerve registers

51:36.200 --> 51:37.600
 the presence of LPS signals

51:37.600 --> 51:40.600
 to these particular hypothalamic areas

51:40.600 --> 51:41.840
 and cranks up body temperature,

51:41.840 --> 51:43.040
 because basically it's a signal

51:43.040 --> 51:45.220
 that the body is infected, right?

51:46.500 --> 51:47.760
 Amazing.

51:47.760 --> 51:51.040
 So I will continue with my two grams per day.

51:51.040 --> 51:52.480
 Maybe I'll ramp it up to four.

51:52.480 --> 51:55.480
 I'm not doing the DHA separately.

51:55.480 --> 51:58.400
 There's DHA in the same supplement.

51:58.400 --> 51:59.240
 Is that okay?

51:59.240 --> 52:00.080
 Yes, yeah, yeah.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.120
 And to kind of,

52:02.120 --> 52:04.100
 boy, we've got a lot of things to hit back on,

52:04.100 --> 52:06.640
 because one of your original questions was

52:06.640 --> 52:08.280
 krill oil versus fish oil.

52:08.280 --> 52:09.720
 Yes, it's still in the queue.

52:09.720 --> 52:14.720
 DHA specifically is in phospholipid form.

52:15.720 --> 52:17.760
 It's more bioavailable.

52:17.760 --> 52:21.720
 So our bodies, if you're comparing exact quantity

52:21.720 --> 52:24.820
 or concentration in triglyceride form

52:24.820 --> 52:27.120
 versus phospholipid form,

52:27.120 --> 52:30.400
 you will get more in your plasma cells,

52:30.400 --> 52:31.520
 in your plasma, not plasma cell,

52:31.520 --> 52:34.280
 in your plasma, with krill oil.

52:34.280 --> 52:39.280
 However, krill oil supplements are so low dose.

52:39.320 --> 52:43.440
 Like, I mean, good luck getting two grams

52:43.440 --> 52:45.600
 of omega-3 from krill oil.

52:45.600 --> 52:49.160
 And also krill oil supplements are notoriously rancid.

52:49.160 --> 52:50.000
 I don't know for whatever reason.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.120
 Maybe that's what made me itchy all over.

52:52.120 --> 52:54.280
 I think they're just,

52:54.280 --> 52:57.760
 I haven't found a good krill oil supplement.

52:57.760 --> 52:59.420
 I pretty much stay away from it.

52:59.420 --> 53:00.800
 I mean, if you smell it too,

53:00.800 --> 53:03.660
 I mean, it's just like, it just smells rancid.

53:04.960 --> 53:06.080
 So, but the thing is,

53:06.080 --> 53:09.080
 and I also published a paper on this back in 2019 or,

53:11.440 --> 53:13.600
 yeah, something like that,

53:13.600 --> 53:18.080
 about DHA in phospholipid form getting into the brain

53:19.520 --> 53:20.600
 through a different mechanism

53:20.600 --> 53:22.200
 than DHA in triglyceride form.

53:22.200 --> 53:24.240
 And so it's going through a transporter

53:24.240 --> 53:26.120
 called the MFS-D2A transporter.

53:26.120 --> 53:27.120
 And I think it's very relevant

53:27.120 --> 53:29.260
 for people with an ApoE4 allele.

53:29.260 --> 53:30.960
 So I kind of-

53:30.960 --> 53:32.160
 With an Alzheimer's susceptibility.

53:32.160 --> 53:36.080
 Right, so like 25% of the population has an allele

53:36.080 --> 53:38.600
 and a gene called ApoE4.

53:38.600 --> 53:41.900
 And basically it's ApoE,

53:41.900 --> 53:46.840
 but the four is referred to as the bad kind of version of it.

53:46.840 --> 53:48.640
 This is something in our bodies.

53:48.640 --> 53:49.840
 It's also in our brain.

53:49.840 --> 53:52.240
 And if people have one of these versions,

53:52.240 --> 53:53.920
 if they got one from their mom or their dad,

53:53.920 --> 53:56.280
 they have a twofold increased risk for Alzheimer's disease

53:56.280 --> 53:57.320
 if they get two,

53:57.320 --> 54:00.640
 which is much more, it's less common.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.240
 I think it's like 2% of the population

54:02.240 --> 54:03.360
 or something has two alleles.

54:03.360 --> 54:04.920
 But they have like a 10 or 11 fold

54:04.920 --> 54:06.840
 increased risk of Alzheimer's disease.

54:06.840 --> 54:10.840
 So there is a role for phospholipid form,

54:10.840 --> 54:11.680
 DHA in the brain,

54:11.680 --> 54:14.200
 but you also make phospholipid DHA inside your body.

54:14.200 --> 54:16.800
 And you can do that by taking in more triglyceride form.

54:16.800 --> 54:19.040
 So two grams like the magic,

54:19.040 --> 54:21.680
 two grams or more is the magic number, I think.

54:22.880 --> 54:26.720
 So kind of back to like the Y for fish oil

54:26.720 --> 54:31.080
 and I personally think it is one of the most powerful

54:32.280 --> 54:36.440
 anti-inflammatory things, dietary lifestyle,

54:36.440 --> 54:41.000
 things that we can get easily, relatively easily

54:41.000 --> 54:45.460
 that is gonna powerfully modulate the way you think,

54:45.460 --> 54:48.360
 the way you feel and the way you age.

54:48.360 --> 54:52.680
 And a variety of different types of studies

54:52.680 --> 54:54.680
 kind of led me to that conclusion.

54:54.680 --> 54:57.320
 A variety of observational studies.

54:57.320 --> 54:59.400
 So there's been lots of work by Dr. Bill Harris

54:59.400 --> 55:01.640
 and his collaborators looking at

55:01.640 --> 55:03.880
 what is called the omega-3 index.

55:03.880 --> 55:07.880
 So this is actually the omega-3 level in red blood cells.

55:07.880 --> 55:10.940
 So red blood cells turn over about every 120 days.

55:10.940 --> 55:14.140
 So it's a long-term marker of omega-3 status.

55:14.140 --> 55:19.140
 This is very different from 99.9% of any study you see

55:19.600 --> 55:22.040
 or any lab that you go to

55:22.040 --> 55:23.360
 to get your omega-3 levels tested.

55:23.360 --> 55:25.960
 You're getting your plasma phospholipid levels tested,

55:25.960 --> 55:28.500
 which is kind of like, you can think of it as,

55:28.500 --> 55:30.120
 what did I eat a couple of days before?

55:30.120 --> 55:31.440
 Oh, I had fish.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.280
 My omega-3 levels are great,

55:33.280 --> 55:36.140
 but did you eat fish like that every week?

55:36.140 --> 55:38.740
 Or was it like you went out to dinner?

55:38.740 --> 55:43.740
 So it's not a great biomarker for long-term omega-3 status.

55:44.160 --> 55:47.680
 It's kind of like the fasting blood glucose levels

55:47.680 --> 55:50.680
 versus the HbA1c, which is like a long-term marker, right,

55:50.680 --> 55:52.320
 of your blood glucose levels.

55:52.320 --> 55:55.800
 So the omega-3 index, he's done a variety of studies,

55:55.800 --> 55:56.840
 observational studies,

55:56.840 --> 55:59.000
 so for people listening, these are studies

55:59.000 --> 56:00.480
 that are obviously flawed

56:00.480 --> 56:04.360
 because they're not establishing causality.

56:04.360 --> 56:08.120
 You're looking at people's lifestyles.

56:08.120 --> 56:10.700
 But in the case of Bill Harris's work,

56:10.700 --> 56:11.880
 he's measuring something.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.040
 So he's measuring the omega-3 index.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.600
 And he's measuring the omega-3 index in people

56:16.600 --> 56:19.000
 and then looking at their mortality risk, for example,

56:19.000 --> 56:21.200
 or their cardiovascular disease risk.

56:21.200 --> 56:24.840
 And what he has found is that most,

56:24.840 --> 56:27.200
 first of all, standard American diet

56:27.200 --> 56:29.840
 has an omega-3 index of 5%.

56:29.840 --> 56:32.920
 Japan, by contrast, has an omega-3 index

56:32.920 --> 56:35.760
 of around 10 to 11%.

56:35.760 --> 56:36.800
 Big difference there.

56:36.800 --> 56:39.160
 And they also have about a five-year

56:39.160 --> 56:42.560
 increased life expectancy compared to people in the US.

56:42.560 --> 56:43.380
 And that's-

56:43.380 --> 56:44.220
 Do you think that's mainly due

56:44.220 --> 56:45.280
 to their fish intake, seafood intake?

56:45.280 --> 56:49.720
 So what he showed was, I think it's a big part of it.

56:49.720 --> 56:51.680
 I mean, you can't always say it's the only thing,

56:51.680 --> 56:54.680
 but what he showed in his data was that in,

56:54.680 --> 56:56.880
 and I think it was Framingham's study,

56:56.880 --> 56:59.280
 where he looked at the omega-3 index

56:59.280 --> 57:03.520
 in people that had a omega-3 index of 4% or lower,

57:03.520 --> 57:05.080
 so close to what the standard American is,

57:05.080 --> 57:07.000
 but a little bit lower,

57:07.000 --> 57:10.900
 they had a five-year decreased life expectancy

57:10.900 --> 57:14.600
 compared to people that had an 8% omega-3 index.

57:14.600 --> 57:17.080
 And so, big difference there, right?

57:17.080 --> 57:18.980
 Five years life expectancy.

57:18.980 --> 57:21.000
 But here's the really interesting thing, Andrew.

57:21.000 --> 57:22.840
 He also looked at smokers,

57:22.840 --> 57:25.120
 and smokers and their omega-3 levels.

57:25.120 --> 57:26.240
 And so he stratified it, right?

57:26.240 --> 57:30.720
 And he found smokers that had no omega-3

57:30.720 --> 57:31.800
 were like the worst of all.

57:31.800 --> 57:33.720
 I mean, it was just like the worst, right?

57:33.720 --> 57:35.720
 We all know smoking is bad for us

57:35.720 --> 57:38.240
 and will take years off our life expectancy.

57:38.240 --> 57:40.480
 But smokers that had the high level,

57:40.480 --> 57:42.340
 like smokers that were taking their fish oil

57:42.340 --> 57:43.840
 or eating fish or whatever it was they were doing

57:43.840 --> 57:45.760
 to get them up to 8%,

57:45.760 --> 57:47.560
 they had the same life expectancy

57:47.560 --> 57:50.440
 as non-smokers with the low omega-3 index.

57:50.440 --> 57:51.560
 Right?

57:51.560 --> 57:52.400
 Wow.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.840
 And that's amazing.

57:55.840 --> 57:56.760
 And it's also amazing to me

57:56.760 --> 57:58.300
 that people still smoke cigarettes,

57:58.300 --> 58:00.240
 but I see a lot of people vaping.

58:00.240 --> 58:05.240
 And I know a lot of people consume cannabis, right?

58:05.300 --> 58:08.400
 Has there been any studies of specifically of vaping

58:08.400 --> 58:13.400
 or people smoking marijuana and all-cause mortality?

58:14.120 --> 58:15.400
 I haven't seen those.

58:15.400 --> 58:16.240
 I haven't seen those.

58:16.240 --> 58:19.120
 They're not motivated enough to come in as research subjects.

58:19.120 --> 58:21.740
 That was, again, a poor joke.

58:21.740 --> 58:24.720
 It is hard to study people marijuana use,

58:24.720 --> 58:27.480
 unless I'm told by my colleagues that study this stuff,

58:27.480 --> 58:29.000
 unless you offer people marijuana,

58:29.000 --> 58:31.020
 in which case they'll do it.

58:31.020 --> 58:33.720
 But again, they're actually not very good research subjects

58:33.720 --> 58:34.560
 in all seriousness,

58:34.560 --> 58:36.320
 because they are not very motivated or consistent

58:36.320 --> 58:38.360
 and they forget their appointments.

58:38.360 --> 58:41.480
 So that's incredible.

58:41.480 --> 58:43.440
 And you mentioned that the data on pollution

58:43.440 --> 58:45.560
 related to the plant compounds earlier.

58:45.560 --> 58:47.720
 So it's almost like these things are, again,

58:47.720 --> 58:49.920
 are acting in a reparative way.

58:52.680 --> 58:57.240
 The omega-3s are, I mean, they are resolving inflammation.

58:57.240 --> 58:59.320
 They're like blunting inflammation.

58:59.320 --> 59:01.640
 They're doing so many different,

59:01.640 --> 59:03.980
 like they affect so many different parts

59:03.980 --> 59:05.080
 of the inflammatory pathway,

59:05.080 --> 59:09.000
 which is, I think it plays a huge role in the way we age,

59:09.000 --> 59:11.020
 the way our brain ages, the way we feel, our mood,

59:11.020 --> 59:12.880
 just our joints, all that.

59:12.880 --> 59:17.000
 And so it's amazing, but it's not...

59:17.000 --> 59:18.400
 I love fish oil.

59:18.400 --> 59:19.720
 I feel better when I take it.

59:19.720 --> 59:23.800
 I try to eat some fatty fish a couple of times a week.

59:23.800 --> 59:26.440
 I do want to just touch on food sources for a moment.

59:27.480 --> 59:31.680
 First of all, are there plants that are rich in omega-3s?

59:31.680 --> 59:36.500
 And second, I have some friends who are really into meat.

59:36.500 --> 59:38.480
 And I like meat a lot.

59:38.480 --> 59:40.860
 My dad's Argentine, but I don't eat very much of it.

59:40.860 --> 59:43.800
 I try and eat high quality meats in relatively limited

59:43.800 --> 59:46.480
 amounts, but I do eat pretty often.

59:46.480 --> 59:50.840
 But I've been told by these sources

59:50.840 --> 59:52.560
 of questionable authority,

59:52.560 --> 59:55.480
 that if an animal grazes on really good grasses,

59:55.480 --> 59:59.280
 for instance, that the meat can contain a lot of omega-3s,

59:59.280 --> 1:00:02.520
 which in principle makes sense based on this omega-3 index.

1:00:02.520 --> 1:00:03.760
 Cause you're telling me that a lot of it,

1:00:03.760 --> 1:00:06.600
 this omega-3 is sequestered into the red blood cells.

1:00:06.600 --> 1:00:09.240
 So if I'm eating high quality grass fed meat

1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:11.800
 and the grasses had omega-3s,

1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:14.780
 do my steaks have omega-3s or no?

1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:17.880
 So there was a study published that compared

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:19.680
 conventional meat.

1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:23.000
 So meat that is, that animals are fed, you know,

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.200
 corn or soy or whatever it is.

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:27.840
 Which is terrible, but for animals and people,

1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:31.700
 as far as I can tell, I'm sure I'll get some attacks,

1:00:31.700 --> 1:00:32.540
 but that's okay.

1:00:32.540 --> 1:00:33.680
 I won't read those comments.

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:37.120
 The, again, a joke, I read all the comments,

1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:42.080
 but it seems to me that these animals have to get,

1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:45.240
 either be taking fish oil or eat plants

1:00:45.240 --> 1:00:48.340
 that are very rich in omega-3s in order for the meat

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:50.480
 to actually contain sufficient omega-3s.

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:52.960
 So the meat, comparing the conventional meat

1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:57.960
 to like the grass fed or pasture raised cows or cattle,

1:00:59.200 --> 1:01:03.080
 there were higher levels of alpha linoleic acid.

1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:08.080
 And ALA is, it can be converted into EPA and DHA.

1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:13.180
 But the conversion is very inefficient

1:01:13.180 --> 1:01:15.880
 and very dependent on a variety of factors,

1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.640
 including genetics.

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:20.640
 Genetics, a huge, you know, regulator.

1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:23.180
 Like some people can do it much better.

1:01:23.180 --> 1:01:27.940
 Others, like you're getting like 5% of conversion to EPA.

1:01:27.940 --> 1:01:32.800
 Estrogen is a major regulator of making that more efficient

1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:35.280
 and it makes sense because pregnancy,

1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:37.480
 when your estrogen just goes through the roof,

1:01:37.480 --> 1:01:39.880
 I mean, these omega-3 fatty acids

1:01:39.880 --> 1:01:42.020
 play a very important role in brain development.

1:01:42.020 --> 1:01:46.040
 So you're, you know, women are supposed to be converting

1:01:46.040 --> 1:01:49.040
 any ALA they can into the longer chain

1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:50.400
 omega-3 fatty acids, right?

1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:53.400
 So estrogen does affect that.

1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:55.200
 But I would say plant sources,

1:01:55.200 --> 1:01:57.960
 so if you're looking for the ALA,

1:01:57.960 --> 1:02:01.440
 plant sources would be walnuts, flax seeds,

1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:03.120
 those are probably the highest.

1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:06.880
 But if a person is a vegan or a vegetarian,

1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:10.200
 their best bet is to actually get microalgae oil.

1:02:10.200 --> 1:02:12.120
 And you can supplement with microalgae oil

1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:16.800
 because microalgae do, they do make the DHA.

1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:20.720
 And so that would be a better source

1:02:20.720 --> 1:02:23.960
 for people that are vegetarian and vegan

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:26.360
 rather than doing the flax seed oil.

1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:28.160
 Because that conversion inefficiency,

1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:32.280
 you know, the enzymes that convert ALA into EPA and DHA,

1:02:32.280 --> 1:02:33.920
 again, it's inefficient.

1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:38.240
 And then for people that eat fish, sardines, you said?

1:02:38.240 --> 1:02:39.080
 Salmon.

1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:42.320
 Salmon, and you have to eat the skin, as I understand.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:44.080
 You don't have to, but it's good.

1:02:44.080 --> 1:02:45.520
 It's rich with the oil.

1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:47.440
 Yeah, and the reason I say,

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:52.160
 like, I think the best would be wild Alaskan salmon

1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:54.120
 versus the farm-raised because the farm-raised,

1:02:54.120 --> 1:02:57.280
 again, they're feeding them, they're feeding them corn,

1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:59.120
 they're feeding them like green and stuff.

1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:00.720
 And then they give them astaxanthin.

1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:02.840
 So astaxanthin is a carotenoid.

1:03:02.840 --> 1:03:04.640
 It's the carotenoid that's in things like

1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:07.160
 krill crustaceans that make their red pigment.

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:09.960
 Yeah, it's also being used now as a supplement

1:03:09.960 --> 1:03:12.000
 and there's a prescription form

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.200
 to try and rescue some age-related vision loss

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:18.480
 because of the role of the vitamin A pathway

1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:20.080
 in photoreceptors.

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:22.520
 Yeah, well, you know, actually the carotenoids themselves,

1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:23.800
 so like luteinine, zeaxanthin,

1:03:23.800 --> 1:03:26.720
 they're really good at sequestering singlet oxygen,

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:29.000
 which is some damaging, right?

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.120
 Yeah, as we age, because the retinal cells,

1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:35.240
 cells of the eye are so metabolically active,

1:03:35.240 --> 1:03:38.200
 they accumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:43.120
 and mitochondrial repair and limiting reactive oxygen species

1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:46.680
 is a major theme of trying to rescue vision.

1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:49.120
 I think that's a whole other podcast and story.

1:03:49.120 --> 1:03:50.560
 There's some really interesting data now

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:53.200
 on the use of red light to try and trigger these pathways.

1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:54.240
 I've seen some.

1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:56.640
 That's my good friend of many years

1:03:56.640 --> 1:03:58.480
 and amazing scientist Glenn Jeffrey's lab

1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:00.640
 at the University College London.

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:02.480
 We should talk about that at some point, if not today.

1:04:02.480 --> 1:04:04.320
 I saw that study like 2020, was it?

1:04:04.320 --> 1:04:05.160
 Now they have a second study.

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:06.000
 Oh, do they?

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:07.560
 Yeah, it's looking real.

1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:09.480
 I mean, you know, they're cautious.

1:04:09.480 --> 1:04:12.320
 They're appropriately British and cautious about it.

1:04:12.320 --> 1:04:13.800
 You know, I always joke

1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:15.120
 if those studies had been done over here,

1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:16.880
 everyone would already know about it.

1:04:16.880 --> 1:04:19.040
 Glenn is a very conservative guy,

1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:22.080
 but they've done this stuff now in pigs and rodent models

1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:23.760
 and now also two studies in humans.

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:25.760
 It's looking pretty interesting.

1:04:25.760 --> 1:04:29.440
 So sardines, but also anchovies.

1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:30.440
 I mean, by the way,

1:04:30.440 --> 1:04:32.480
 I hate all the food items that I'm describing.

1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:34.200
 I can barely tolerate salmon.

1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:35.520
 I don't like fish at all.

1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:37.000
 Actually, I like live fish.

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:38.440
 I had fish tanks when I was a kid.

1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:39.280
 I just don't.

1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:41.360
 No, I find fish, unless it's in sushi form,

1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:43.640
 I find it absolutely repulsive.

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:44.480
 And I don't know why.

1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:45.640
 I probably have some mutation.

1:04:45.640 --> 1:04:48.920
 So raw fish is actually higher in mercury than cooked.

1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:49.760
 Okay, well, that's good.

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:52.240
 I don't really like sushi that much anyway.

1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:54.680
 You're giving me great reasons to not eat fish,

1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:56.840
 but except I should eat these other fish sources

1:04:56.840 --> 1:04:58.160
 or supplement more heavily.

1:04:58.160 --> 1:04:59.320
 That's the message I'm getting.

1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:01.560
 I eat sardines like every day.

1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:04.360
 My like first meal almost is like a can of sardines

1:05:04.360 --> 1:05:05.760
 and an avocado with like-

1:05:05.760 --> 1:05:07.080
 Avocado is good.

1:05:07.080 --> 1:05:08.200
 Yeah, with a little bit of lemon

1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:10.760
 and then some little hot sauce, like, you know.

1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:12.440
 Does avocado have omega-3s?

1:05:12.440 --> 1:05:15.680
 Avocado is very good in monounsaturated fat.

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:17.360
 It's not really high in polyunsaturated fat.

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:21.920
 Omega-3 really, I mean, it's either the DHA and EPA

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:24.160
 that's in the marine sources fish

1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:26.080
 or it's the plant ALA source,

1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:29.560
 which is like the flaxseed or the walnuts, so.

1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:30.400
 It's rough.

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:32.320
 I mean, all these companies now

1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:37.200
 are making these plant-based products that taste like meat.

1:05:37.200 --> 1:05:39.080
 My wish is that they would just make a fish

1:05:39.080 --> 1:05:41.080
 that tastes like a steak, but that's-

1:05:41.080 --> 1:05:43.320
 The fish come out albino, the ones that they farm raise

1:05:43.320 --> 1:05:45.360
 because they don't eat any of the-

1:05:45.360 --> 1:05:46.200
 I'm joking.

1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:48.120
 I don't want a genetically modified fish

1:05:48.120 --> 1:05:49.040
 that tastes like a steak.

1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:51.480
 Although, you know, I love the taste of steak.

1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:53.280
 The point here is that if you don't,

1:05:53.280 --> 1:05:56.040
 if one doesn't see themselves

1:05:56.040 --> 1:06:01.040
 regularly consuming these fish sources of omega-3s,

1:06:01.760 --> 1:06:04.600
 it seems to me that the only way to really get them

1:06:04.600 --> 1:06:07.200
 is from supplementation.

1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:10.960
 And supplementation is a good way to get a high dose

1:06:10.960 --> 1:06:13.320
 and to get back to your dose point.

1:06:13.320 --> 1:06:18.320
 There was a couple of studies that basically, you know,

1:06:18.400 --> 1:06:20.560
 I think there was some way they showed that people

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:23.560
 that are in the 4% omega-3 index range,

1:06:23.560 --> 1:06:25.200
 in order to get to the 8%, right,

1:06:25.200 --> 1:06:27.520
 the five-year increased life expectancy

1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:29.320
 if we're comparing the two groups,

1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:31.960
 was to supplement with at least two grams.

1:06:31.960 --> 1:06:33.600
 It was about two grams a day.

1:06:33.600 --> 1:06:35.760
 And I think it was a little bit less

1:06:35.760 --> 1:06:36.680
 if it was triglyceride form,

1:06:36.680 --> 1:06:39.880
 but I think two grams is a good, safe number.

1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:43.480
 So most Americans that are not eating a lot of fish

1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:44.320
 and they're not supplementing

1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:47.400
 are probably around a 4% to 5% omega-3 index.

1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:48.960
 And to get to the 8%,

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:52.680
 and I think that's a good empirical way

1:06:52.680 --> 1:06:53.760
 of thinking about it, right?

1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:55.120
 Okay, well, I want to get to that 8%.

1:06:55.120 --> 1:06:57.600
 By the way, I'm almost 16% omega-3 index.

1:06:57.600 --> 1:06:59.920
 Yeah, I was going to ask about testing.

1:06:59.920 --> 1:07:03.160
 So where can somebody measure,

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.960
 where and how can somebody measure their omega-3 index?

1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:07.120
 Which again, just to remind people,

1:07:07.120 --> 1:07:09.640
 is essentially the percentage of omega-3s

1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:12.960
 that you have in your blood with the caveat

1:07:12.960 --> 1:07:16.760
 that the omega-3 index will be heavily biased

1:07:16.760 --> 1:07:18.720
 by what you ate in the previous days.

1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:19.960
 Not the omega-3 index.

1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:20.800
 Okay, so the omega-3-

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:21.640
 Sorry, I misunderstood.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:22.800
 I thought you said in red blood cells.

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.160
 If I ate salmon two days ago,

1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:25.800
 my omega-3 index is going to go up.

1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:27.080
 No, that was plasma.

1:07:27.080 --> 1:07:28.240
 I misunderstood.

1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:30.120
 So most people are measuring,

1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:31.700
 like if you look at a lot of studies,

1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:32.540
 and honestly, Andrew,

1:07:32.540 --> 1:07:35.320
 I think a lot of the reason for conflicting data

1:07:35.320 --> 1:07:39.560
 is because people are measuring plasma omega-3 levels.

1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:40.400
 Okay.

1:07:40.400 --> 1:07:41.880
 The phospholipids, it's in a phospholipid, right?

1:07:41.880 --> 1:07:44.280
 So your phospholipids are carrying things.

1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:45.720
 These are lipoproteins.

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:47.460
 They're carrying things like omega-3

1:07:47.460 --> 1:07:49.400
 and triglycerides and stuff and shuttling them around.

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:53.800
 So the omega-3 index is actually in the red blood cells,

1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:56.880
 and red blood cells take 120 days to turn over.

1:07:56.880 --> 1:07:59.760
 So if you're going to do a baseline test,

1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:01.640
 if you want to know before supplementing

1:08:01.640 --> 1:08:02.720
 what your level is,

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:06.160
 you have to wait 120 days before doing the second test

1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:08.240
 after supplementing to know how much you went up,

1:08:08.240 --> 1:08:10.640
 because that's how long it takes

1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:12.440
 for your red blood cell to turn over.

1:08:12.440 --> 1:08:17.240
 So the omega-3 index, Bill Harris has a company

1:08:17.240 --> 1:08:19.440
 that he co-founded.

1:08:19.440 --> 1:08:21.400
 It's called Omega Quant,

1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:23.440
 and they measure the omega-3 index.

1:08:23.440 --> 1:08:25.840
 They have a variety of different index tests.

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:27.680
 You can do a basic one or a little more advanced.

1:08:27.680 --> 1:08:28.640
 This is from a blood draw.

1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:29.480
 It is.

1:08:29.480 --> 1:08:31.200
 It's a little blood spot thing, yeah.

1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:35.200
 And he uses money to funnel back into doing lipid research.

1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:37.760
 He's out there doing all sorts of interesting studies

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:38.600
 on omega-3s.

1:08:38.600 --> 1:08:39.420
 It's great.

1:08:39.420 --> 1:08:41.320
 But the omega-3 index is great.

1:08:41.320 --> 1:08:45.400
 I think that, honestly, more people and more researchers

1:08:45.400 --> 1:08:49.600
 should be using it, because the conflicting data,

1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:52.480
 it always comes down to what we're measuring,

1:08:52.480 --> 1:08:53.800
 the sensitivity of it.

1:08:54.760 --> 1:08:56.140
 Are we even measuring anything?

1:08:56.140 --> 1:09:00.000
 So you're giving someone 500 milligrams of DHA,

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.000
 and you don't see any effect.

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.840
 Well, did you measure what their levels were,

1:09:02.840 --> 1:09:05.840
 and did you measure the omega-3 index?

1:09:05.840 --> 1:09:07.200
 There's all sorts of problems

1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:09.440
 with randomized controlled trials,

1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:12.280
 and I think that we need to,

1:09:12.280 --> 1:09:14.160
 as scientists, we need to come together

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:16.040
 and make some progress.

1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:18.360
 I mean, let's all talk to each other.

1:09:18.360 --> 1:09:20.520
 Let's figure things out.

1:09:20.520 --> 1:09:22.400
 This test is out there.

1:09:22.400 --> 1:09:23.360
 It should be used.

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:25.120
 It should be used not just by Bill's group,

1:09:25.120 --> 1:09:26.280
 but like everyone.

1:09:26.280 --> 1:09:29.320
 Yeah, well, and I'm learning so much from you,

1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:32.020
 and I agree we need more collaboration.

1:09:32.020 --> 1:09:34.500
 I've always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:35.640
 in my lab at Stanford,

1:09:35.640 --> 1:09:37.960
 and collaborating is just so much more fun.

1:09:37.960 --> 1:09:41.640
 Online, there seems to be a bias more towards creating silos

1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:43.800
 as opposed to bridges,

1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:46.920
 but I appreciate that you bring up the need

1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:47.840
 for more collaboration,

1:09:47.840 --> 1:09:50.040
 and knowing which measures are best,

1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:52.380
 and in this case, now I'll thank you for the clarification.

1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:54.920
 I understand this omega-3 index is going to be best.

1:09:54.920 --> 1:09:57.000
 You mentioned you, so basically when now I look at you,

1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.120
 I think you are 16% omega-3.

1:09:59.120 --> 1:10:00.760
 And dolphins are 19%.

1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:01.600
 I'm almost-

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:02.420
 Is that your goal?

1:10:02.420 --> 1:10:03.260
 You're trying to get there?

1:10:03.260 --> 1:10:04.100
 It is.

1:10:04.100 --> 1:10:06.760
 To do the interesting.

1:10:06.760 --> 1:10:07.880
 Actually, they should probably do something

1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:10.960
 where you're trying to achieve the omega-3 ratio

1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:14.280
 of your favorite species.

1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:17.060
 Now that we've covered a bit of how to get these things

1:10:17.060 --> 1:10:20.040
 into one system, depending on what one eats, et cetera,

1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:21.840
 and some of the better measurements,

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:27.540
 how is omega-3 and some of these other related lipids,

1:10:27.540 --> 1:10:29.300
 how are they having these positive effects?

1:10:29.300 --> 1:10:33.120
 In my mind, and this is incredibly elementary,

1:10:33.120 --> 1:10:35.060
 but my understanding is that at some level,

1:10:35.060 --> 1:10:37.060
 they're making platelets more slippery.

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:38.060
 Is that true or not?

1:10:38.060 --> 1:10:40.440
 I hope, I'm happy to be wrong.

1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:43.040
 How is it possibly impacting my mood?

1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:45.840
 Is it through the synthesis of membrane on neurons

1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:48.520
 that allows neurons to release more transmitter,

1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:50.480
 like serotonin and dopamine?

1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:53.680
 What are some of the purported, reported,

1:10:53.680 --> 1:10:55.520
 and known mechanisms?

1:10:55.520 --> 1:10:59.640
 I think some of the most well-known mechanisms

1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:02.760
 do have to do with the omega-3 fatty acids

1:11:02.760 --> 1:11:07.520
 being very powerful regulators of the inflammatory process

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:09.160
 in some way, shape, or form,

1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:11.920
 whether that has to do with resolvins that are produced.

1:11:11.920 --> 1:11:16.080
 So from the metabolites of like DHA, for example,

1:11:16.080 --> 1:11:19.720
 resolvins play a role in resolving inflammation.

1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:22.400
 Like you want your inflammatory response to be activated

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:23.640
 when it's supposed to be,

1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:25.240
 but you want to resolve that inflammation

1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:29.040
 and the inflammatory response in a timely manner, right?

1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:30.660
 And resolvins help do that.

1:11:30.660 --> 1:11:32.720
 And so resolvins are one.

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:34.760
 And then there's these specialized

1:11:34.760 --> 1:11:36.840
 pro-mediating molecules, the SPMs,

1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:39.480
 that also help resolve the inflammation.

1:11:39.480 --> 1:11:40.520
 There's, like you mentioned,

1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:42.200
 the leukotrienes and prostaglandins,

1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:44.080
 and these things are being affected by EPA,

1:11:44.080 --> 1:11:47.360
 and they do affect platelets and platelet aggregation,

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:50.840
 and they do affect that whole pathway as well.

1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:52.200
 And so there's just,

1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:53.040
 and there's, you know,

1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:57.220
 I think there's just so many different ways and inputs.

1:11:57.220 --> 1:11:59.000
 And so when we talk about inflammation,

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.640
 honestly, it's a big general term,

1:12:01.640 --> 1:12:02.800
 but you're talking about,

1:12:02.800 --> 1:12:05.340
 when you're talking about serotonin release,

1:12:05.340 --> 1:12:07.200
 you know, at the level of neurons,

1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:09.280
 you know, we know that these inflammatory molecules

1:12:09.280 --> 1:12:10.480
 cross the blood-brain barrier.

1:12:10.480 --> 1:12:12.360
 And I just mentioned ago about injecting people

1:12:12.360 --> 1:12:15.120
 with lipopolysaccharide and causing depressive symptoms.

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:19.400
 You know, it's known that omega-3,

1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.560
 actually, specifically EPA,

1:12:21.560 --> 1:12:24.000
 is able to help serotonin,

1:12:24.000 --> 1:12:26.680
 inflammation inhibits the release of serotonin.

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:31.400
 And so EPA is actually able to blunt inflammatory responses,

1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:32.520
 along with DHA as well.

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.440
 DHA does that through resolvins and stuff,

1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:37.520
 and this then helps more serotonin be released

1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:40.180
 because you're not having so much inflammation

1:12:40.180 --> 1:12:41.320
 getting into the brain

1:12:41.320 --> 1:12:43.200
 and affecting serotonin release, right?

1:12:43.200 --> 1:12:44.080
 That's one mechanism.

1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:45.000
 And then another would be,

1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:46.840
 well, DHA itself has been shown,

1:12:46.840 --> 1:12:49.640
 it's a very important fatty acid

1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:51.640
 that makes up cell membranes, many cell membranes,

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:53.100
 including in our neurons.

1:12:53.100 --> 1:12:55.120
 And as you very well know, Andrew,

1:12:55.120 --> 1:12:58.740
 the structure and function of receptors, of transporters,

1:12:58.740 --> 1:13:02.680
 these membrane-bound proteins on the surface of our cells,

1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:06.600
 including neurons, are affected by the membrane fluidity,

1:13:06.600 --> 1:13:10.880
 like how rigid and how fluid the cell membrane is.

1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:12.800
 And DHA plays a role in that.

1:13:12.800 --> 1:13:14.680
 And so, for example, in animal studies,

1:13:14.680 --> 1:13:17.280
 if you make an animal deficient in DHA,

1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:20.000
 their serotonin receptors, dopamine receptors,

1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:23.600
 they're affected because the structure of them is affected

1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:25.960
 through the fluidity of the membrane.

1:13:25.960 --> 1:13:29.320
 And so I think that's another mechanism.

1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:31.320
 And I'm talking sort of general

1:13:31.320 --> 1:13:32.800
 because I'm not a neuroscientist.

1:13:32.800 --> 1:13:33.880
 No, but it makes perfect sense.

1:13:33.880 --> 1:13:37.200
 I mean, we know, for instance, neuroplasticity,

1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:40.520
 and almost always, involves the recruitment

1:13:40.520 --> 1:13:42.860
 of more receptors or an improvement

1:13:42.860 --> 1:13:46.620
 in some feature of receptors to neurotransmitters,

1:13:46.620 --> 1:13:49.280
 and they literally move laterally in the membrane.

1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:50.960
 They kind of float around like little rafts.

1:13:50.960 --> 1:13:53.020
 Sometimes they are, in fact, in lipid rafts.

1:13:53.020 --> 1:13:56.300
 And so it makes perfect sense that these molecules like DHA,

1:13:56.300 --> 1:13:58.920
 which are part of the structural fat of the neuron,

1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:00.480
 because of course the outsides of neurons

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:01.520
 are basically fat,

1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:03.480
 not just the myelin that people have heard of,

1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:07.920
 but the actual membranes, that getting that right,

1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:09.680
 you wouldn't want it as rigid as concrete,

1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:12.600
 but you wouldn't want it as soft as,

1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:14.040
 need to come up with something here.

1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:15.920
 What's that gooey stuff that kids play with?

1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:17.200
 It's like that goo.

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:19.800
 Anyway, it's disgusting,

1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:22.000
 and it's too soft to be a membrane for a neuron.

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:22.840
 That's what we know.

1:14:22.840 --> 1:14:24.880
 Someone put it in the comments

1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:27.360
 and tell me what that disgusting gooey stuff is.

1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:29.640
 You don't want your neurons to be that gooey,

1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:31.800
 and yet you don't want them to be like concrete either.

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:32.640
 It's a balance.

1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:34.200
 It's a balance.

1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:37.040
 And in mentioning DHA,

1:14:37.040 --> 1:14:38.800
 I'm just going to realize I'm backtracking,

1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:40.060
 but I want to make sure that we close

1:14:40.060 --> 1:14:42.040
 all the hatches for people.

1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:44.480
 We talked a lot about EPA,

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:47.640
 but are food sources of DHA

1:14:48.520 --> 1:14:51.040
 that you find particularly attractive

1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:53.720
 either by taste or by potency for DHA,

1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:55.880
 what are just a few that we could throw out?

1:14:55.880 --> 1:14:58.560
 Because I am aware that there are supplements

1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:00.960
 where you can get a nice ratio of EPA to DHA,

1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:02.680
 or you take them separately as you do.

1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:05.000
 But if I want to make sure that I'm getting enough DHA,

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.240
 what do I need to be sure I'm eating on a regular basis?

1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:11.200
 Well, the fish is packaging the DHA and EPA in the ratio.

1:15:11.200 --> 1:15:14.300
 But I also do eat salmon roe,

1:15:14.300 --> 1:15:16.340
 which is very salty,

1:15:16.340 --> 1:15:18.720
 and it's a really high source

1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:22.480
 of the phosphatidylcholine DHA that we talked about.

1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:23.440
 So this is fish eggs?

1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:24.280
 It is.

1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:25.100
 Yeah.

1:15:25.100 --> 1:15:25.940
 And actually-

1:15:25.940 --> 1:15:26.760
 That I like for some reason.

1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:27.600
 Oh, do you?

1:15:27.600 --> 1:15:30.400
 Yeah, so I'm discovering something about myself.

1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:33.240
 This was not meant to be nutritional psychotherapy,

1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:34.880
 but you're doing that for me anyway.

1:15:34.880 --> 1:15:37.560
 I'm discovering that, yeah, I like eating embryonic fish.

1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:39.520
 I just don't like eating the actual fish.

1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:40.560
 Okay, well.

1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:42.720
 Okay, so fish eggs are okay.

1:15:42.720 --> 1:15:43.680
 So caviar, basically.

1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:44.520
 Caviar, yes.

1:15:44.520 --> 1:15:47.040
 And that's a good source of the phospholipid form.

1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:48.420
 And I was consuming that a lot

1:15:48.420 --> 1:15:51.160
 because I wanted to get the phospholipid form.

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:52.480
 So, and it's actually really good.

1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:53.760
 There's been some animal studies

1:15:53.760 --> 1:15:55.840
 and piglets and rodents as well

1:15:55.840 --> 1:16:00.080
 showing that consuming phospholipid DHA

1:16:01.200 --> 1:16:02.960
 during fetal brain development

1:16:02.960 --> 1:16:06.080
 like gets like 10 times more DHA in the brain.

1:16:06.080 --> 1:16:07.180
 Again, it's-

1:16:07.180 --> 1:16:09.840
 Makes sense based on fetal development.

1:16:09.840 --> 1:16:13.440
 So do I need to buy Beluga caviar?

1:16:13.440 --> 1:16:15.280
 Stuff can get pretty expensive at $200 a tin.

1:16:15.280 --> 1:16:17.040
 I don't think you need to, yeah.

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:20.120
 I think it's a matter of preference.

1:16:20.120 --> 1:16:22.320
 And if you're supplementing

1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:25.260
 with your two to four grams of fish oil,

1:16:25.260 --> 1:16:28.400
 I mean, you're going to get phospholipid form anyway

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:29.560
 because your body's going to make it.

1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:31.100
 Okay, I've seen some containers

1:16:31.100 --> 1:16:34.120
 of what I assume to be quality fish eggs

1:16:34.120 --> 1:16:36.600
 that are not at the caviar level

1:16:36.600 --> 1:16:38.680
 that you can find in the better grocery stores

1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:40.360
 that aren't super expensive.

1:16:40.360 --> 1:16:42.520
 I wouldn't dip as low as to go eat, for instance,

1:16:42.520 --> 1:16:44.360
 like fishing bait.

1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:45.800
 Like when we were kids, we used to go fishing

1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.120
 and you'd put the fish egg on the thing.

1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:48.280
 That's probably not good.

1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:50.120
 Although it's good enough for the fish, apparently.

1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:52.520
 Okay, only half joking here, folks.

1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:54.500
 I'm just trying to protect you from yourselves.

1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:57.040
 Don't get any crazy ideas about eating fishing bait.

1:16:57.960 --> 1:17:00.560
 Okay, so that's great to know.

1:17:00.560 --> 1:17:02.320
 So we have these plant-based compounds.

1:17:02.320 --> 1:17:04.840
 We have the omega-3s, so EPA, DHA.

1:17:04.840 --> 1:17:07.180
 And then you mentioned there's a third category.

1:17:07.180 --> 1:17:09.200
 What would you place in your third category

1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:14.200
 of foods or supplement-based nutrients

1:17:14.200 --> 1:17:17.800
 that our health, brain and or body health

1:17:17.800 --> 1:17:19.040
 can really benefit from?

1:17:19.040 --> 1:17:21.560
 I mean, I think the most obvious would be vitamin D,

1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:24.760
 which is actually, as you know, a steroid hormone

1:17:24.760 --> 1:17:28.000
 that we produce when we're in the sun.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:31.720
 Depending on the time of year, we can make it in our skin.

1:17:31.720 --> 1:17:34.160
 And depending on how much melanin we have in our skin

1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:35.440
 or whether or not we're wearing sunscreen

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:39.240
 or how old we are, there's a sliding scale

1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:41.120
 on how efficient that process is.

1:17:41.120 --> 1:17:43.520
 And as I understand, there's an inverse relationship

1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:48.240
 where the darker your skin is naturally,

1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:50.440
 the more vitamin D you need to consume.

1:17:50.440 --> 1:17:51.320
 Is that right?

1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:54.560
 Well, the darker your skin is, the harder it is.

1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:56.920
 So there was a study out of the University of Chicago,

1:17:56.920 --> 1:17:58.680
 this was several years ago, where they looked

1:17:58.680 --> 1:18:03.000
 at African Americans and compared African Americans

1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.600
 to Caucasians with light skin, fair skin,

1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:09.060
 and how well they could make vitamin D from sun exposure

1:18:09.060 --> 1:18:11.800
 and how long they had to be in the sun

1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:13.400
 to make X amount, right?

1:18:13.400 --> 1:18:15.680
 And it turns out that African Americans

1:18:15.680 --> 1:18:17.920
 with darker pigmentation, which protects them

1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:20.640
 from the burning rays of the sun, it's a natural sunscreen,

1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:23.880
 had to stay in the sun like six times as long

1:18:23.880 --> 1:18:26.960
 as someone with none of that natural sunscreen.

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:31.960
 So I think the take home there is a lot of people

1:18:32.200 --> 1:18:34.680
 with darker skin living in sub-Saharan Africa

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:37.200
 or people living in India with darker skin

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:39.740
 or in the Philippines, these equatorial regions

1:18:39.740 --> 1:18:42.680
 where you tend to see darker skin

1:18:42.680 --> 1:18:44.400
 because it's protection from the burning rays of sun.

1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:45.240
 And adaptation.

1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:46.560
 They are in the sun war.

1:18:46.560 --> 1:18:47.400
 Right, yeah.

1:18:47.400 --> 1:18:48.880
 And they're getting more vitamin D.

1:18:48.880 --> 1:18:51.240
 But people that maybe moved to the United States

1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:55.640
 to like Minnesota or in a place where UVB radiation

1:18:55.640 --> 1:18:58.920
 isn't getting to the atmosphere 12 months out of the year,

1:18:58.920 --> 1:19:02.000
 it's only getting there four months, for example.

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.480
 Or even living in our modern day society

1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:04.960
 where people just don't go outside anymore.

1:19:04.960 --> 1:19:07.800
 I mean, we're inside, we're at our laptops in school,

1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:09.520
 we're at work, we're in our cubicle, whatever.

1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:12.400
 So supplementation does play a major role,

1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:15.040
 not only for people with darker skin

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:17.120
 that aren't outside all the time, but for everyone.

1:19:17.120 --> 1:19:21.800
 70% of the U.S. population has inadequate vitamin D levels.

1:19:21.800 --> 1:19:24.360
 70 of the whole U.S.

1:19:24.360 --> 1:19:25.840
 So this is everyone.

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:29.360
 And so I think that insufficient levels defined

1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:32.800
 as less than 30 nanograms per milliliter,

1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:38.160
 and that's sort of defined by the endocrine society

1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:41.480
 looking at a lot of different aggregate studies

1:19:41.480 --> 1:19:43.960
 and all-cause mortality, for example.

1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:46.160
 There's been a lot of different meta-analyses

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:47.680
 of all-cause mortality studies

1:19:47.680 --> 1:19:51.360
 where vitamin D levels really seem to be ideal

1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:54.840
 between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter.

1:19:54.840 --> 1:19:57.960
 And so in order to get to that level,

1:19:57.960 --> 1:20:01.240
 if you are not outside all the time,

1:20:01.240 --> 1:20:03.760
 live in Southern California where you're always outside

1:20:03.760 --> 1:20:05.800
 without sunscreen on, I always wear sunscreen

1:20:05.800 --> 1:20:07.640
 because I'm trying to protect my skin

1:20:07.640 --> 1:20:09.600
 from so many wrinkles and stuff, right?

1:20:09.600 --> 1:20:13.160
 But also skin cancer is somewhat of an issue as well.

1:20:13.160 --> 1:20:16.680
 So basically the point is that vitamin D

1:20:16.680 --> 1:20:17.520
 is a steroid hormone,

1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:21.600
 meaning it actually binds to a receptor

1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:24.840
 and another receptor dimerizes with it,

1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:26.240
 the retinoid receptor.

1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:29.880
 And that complex goes into the nucleus of a cell

1:20:29.880 --> 1:20:33.840
 where your DNA is, and it recognizes little sequences

1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:36.000
 of DNA called vitamin D response elements,

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:37.440
 they're called VDREs.

1:20:37.440 --> 1:20:39.480
 They're specific sequences of DNA

1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:42.920
 that this complex, bound to the vitamin D receptor,

1:20:42.920 --> 1:20:44.480
 goes inside and recognizes

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:46.560
 and turns on a whole host of genes,

1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:47.880
 turns off a whole host of genes.

1:20:47.880 --> 1:20:51.280
 I mean, this is important stuff.

1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:53.760
 Like imagine 70% of the population

1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:56.400
 having insufficient testosterone, right?

1:20:56.400 --> 1:20:57.960
 It's a steroid hormone.

1:20:57.960 --> 1:21:01.000
 We might be headed there, but probably not.

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.040
 No, I think that its names are very important.

1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:07.120
 And I think that one of the issues is that vitamin D

1:21:07.120 --> 1:21:09.360
 is called vitamin D.

1:21:09.360 --> 1:21:13.800
 It's not called DHEA or variant, blah, blah, blah.

1:21:13.800 --> 1:21:15.320
 It doesn't sound like a hormone.

1:21:15.320 --> 1:21:18.120
 I also, I'm glad that you're mentioning skin

1:21:18.120 --> 1:21:20.200
 as the major kind of interface

1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:22.560
 between the environment and vitamin D synthesis,

1:21:22.560 --> 1:21:24.400
 because a lot of people think of skin

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:26.920
 as just a protective sheath around us

1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:28.840
 or something to adorn ourselves with earrings

1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:30.200
 or tattoos or whatever.

1:21:30.200 --> 1:21:32.480
 But skin obviously serves those roles,

1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:35.000
 but the skin is an endocrine organ.

1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:38.200
 It has the capacity to make things that impact hormones

1:21:38.200 --> 1:21:39.720
 and to make hormones.

1:21:39.720 --> 1:21:42.080
 There's this beautiful study out this last year

1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:44.240
 where this took place over in Israel

1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:45.640
 where they had people get outside

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:49.080
 for 20 or 30 minutes a day, three times a week,

1:21:49.080 --> 1:21:52.440
 exposing a culturally acceptable,

1:21:52.440 --> 1:21:56.000
 yet substantial amount of their skin during that time

1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:59.560
 and saw big increases in testosterone and estrogen.

1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:02.000
 And this is through a keratinocyte linked pathway

1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:03.840
 involving P53.

1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:04.720
 This was done in humans,

1:22:04.720 --> 1:22:06.400
 but they did some knockout studies in parallel.

1:22:06.400 --> 1:22:08.400
 And what this study told me or reminded me

1:22:08.400 --> 1:22:09.920
 is that skin is an endocrine organ.

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:12.440
 So the idea that sun could trigger the activation

1:22:12.440 --> 1:22:16.560
 of a production of a hormone is really interesting

1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:17.800
 and makes total sense.

1:22:17.800 --> 1:22:20.200
 So when vitamin D gets into cells

1:22:20.200 --> 1:22:22.040
 and it's binding to these VDREs,

1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:27.800
 what sorts of things are they triggering?

1:22:27.800 --> 1:22:28.840
 So like for testosterone,

1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:30.600
 we know it's going to trigger protein synthesis,

1:22:30.600 --> 1:22:32.320
 muscle growth, tendon strength, et cetera.

1:22:32.320 --> 1:22:35.360
 With estrogen, it's going to be keep your neurons going,

1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:36.720
 your joints feeling good.

1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:39.000
 I always remind people that, by the way,

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.360
 because guys always seem to want to increase

1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:43.080
 their testosterone and reduce their estrogen.

1:22:43.080 --> 1:22:45.800
 Just remind people, if you reduce your estrogen, guys,

1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:47.800
 your libido will plummet to near zero.

1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:49.620
 Don't crush your estrogen.

1:22:49.620 --> 1:22:50.920
 It'll also make you stupid.

1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:54.920
 If you're not already stupid, it will make you stupid.

1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:58.900
 So estrogen is vitally important for males and females.

1:22:58.900 --> 1:23:01.480
 When vitamin D gets into cells,

1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:03.920
 what sorts of things is it stimulating?

1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:07.000
 Okay, so first of all, it's regulating more than 5%

1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:09.120
 of the protein-encoded human genome.

1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:11.680
 More than, and this was, I say more than

1:23:11.680 --> 1:23:15.080
 because when I was looking at this data really in depth

1:23:15.080 --> 1:23:20.080
 back in, starting in 2012 to 2014, it was that,

1:23:21.200 --> 1:23:22.800
 and then it's now grown.

1:23:22.800 --> 1:23:25.800
 But one of the important things that you'll find interesting

1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:27.420
 that I published on back in 2014

1:23:27.420 --> 1:23:32.420
 was that I'd gone through this big published database

1:23:32.420 --> 1:23:34.760
 where someone had published all these genes

1:23:34.760 --> 1:23:36.520
 they found VDREs in.

1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:41.520
 And basically I found that tryptophan hydroxylase one

1:23:42.220 --> 1:23:44.920
 and tryptophan hydroxylase two was on there.

1:23:44.920 --> 1:23:46.320
 And so then I started looking at the sequence

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:48.120
 and I was doing some in silico work,

1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:51.000
 and it turns out that the VDREs

1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.960
 and tryptophan hydroxylase two,

1:23:52.960 --> 1:23:56.840
 so for people listening, tryptophan hydroxylase

1:23:56.840 --> 1:24:00.880
 is an enzyme that converts tryptophan into serotonin.

1:24:00.880 --> 1:24:05.080
 So tryptophan is an amino acid that we get from our food.

1:24:05.080 --> 1:24:09.520
 You convert tryptophan into serotonin in the gut,

1:24:09.520 --> 1:24:11.300
 but you also do it in the brain.

1:24:11.300 --> 1:24:13.880
 However, serotonin does not cross the blood-brain barrier.

1:24:13.880 --> 1:24:16.480
 So tryptophan has to get into your brain

1:24:16.480 --> 1:24:19.000
 and then you have to convert it to serotonin in your brain.

1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.640
 Well, the enzyme that does that in your brain

1:24:21.640 --> 1:24:23.720
 is called tryptophan hydroxylase two,

1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:26.720
 and it's activated by vitamin D.

1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:30.600
 The one in the gut is actually tryptophan hydroxylase one.

1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:33.400
 Some of my published work hypothesized

1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:35.840
 that it might actually be repressed by vitamin D

1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:37.700
 because it has a sequence.

1:24:37.700 --> 1:24:41.480
 The sequence itself, this 12-nucleotide sequence,

1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:44.000
 it can determine to some degree

1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:45.520
 whether it's gonna be activated or turned off.

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:47.280
 And so I was able to kind of look at that

1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:48.640
 and think, oh, maybe this and that.

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:50.640
 And so since then, there have been some groups

1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:53.340
 that have confirmed more with in vivo

1:24:53.340 --> 1:24:54.640
 and or in vitro studies,

1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:57.120
 because mine was all in silico and all that stuff.

1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:00.840
 But anyways, so serotonin, a really important one.

1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:03.040
 But most people, I mean, this is regulating

1:25:03.040 --> 1:25:05.520
 our immune cell, immune system.

1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:09.160
 It's regulating our blood pressure,

1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:12.160
 all that water retention.

1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:16.200
 I mean, bone, of course, homeostasis, 5%, more than 5%.

1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:19.400
 I mean, I can't tell you so much.

1:25:19.400 --> 1:25:23.640
 And with 70% of the US population deficient,

1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:27.360
 I'm beginning to think that this could be the linchpin

1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:29.940
 in a number of really important issues.

1:25:29.940 --> 1:25:34.940
 So supplementing vitamin D3 is what I normally hear is the,

1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:39.480
 I do, I take, I think I end up taking 5,000 IUs,

1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:42.300
 sometimes 10 IUs of vitamin D3 per day.

1:25:42.300 --> 1:25:43.440
 Just done that for a long time,

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:45.780
 and I've had my levels tested and they're in range.

1:25:45.780 --> 1:25:48.120
 But I have a family member, I'll just mention this.

1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:51.000
 I have a family member who was not feeling well,

1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:52.960
 just kind of feeling off, a little low,

1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:54.360
 had some digestive issues.

1:25:54.360 --> 1:25:56.560
 This went on a long period of time,

1:25:56.560 --> 1:26:01.320
 was taking, on my recommendation, 15,000 IUs of D3

1:26:01.320 --> 1:26:03.740
 and was still deficient in D3.

1:26:03.740 --> 1:26:06.000
 Now takes, and I'm not suggesting anyone do this

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:07.800
 as a special case, perhaps,

1:26:07.800 --> 1:26:11.160
 but no chronic illness that we're aware of,

1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:13.780
 needs to take 30,000 IUs per day

1:26:13.780 --> 1:26:18.060
 in order to bring their D3 range just into normal.

1:26:18.060 --> 1:26:20.440
 Which is, to me, is striking because they eat quite well,

1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:22.240
 they're a healthy weight, et cetera.

1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:24.040
 And it's made a tremendous difference

1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:24.880
 in terms of their mood.

1:26:24.880 --> 1:26:25.920
 Now, of course, this is correlative.

1:26:25.920 --> 1:26:27.200
 Now they feel better, they're doing it.

1:26:27.200 --> 1:26:28.040
 Who knows?

1:26:28.040 --> 1:26:29.300
 They're probably also getting outside more.

1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:32.960
 But I mean, I think people need to get tested.

1:26:32.960 --> 1:26:35.520
 They need to get their D3 levels tested.

1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:38.620
 But where and what is a good starting range

1:26:38.620 --> 1:26:41.240
 for people to think about D3 supplementation?

1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:45.440
 And again, foods that can increase D3.

1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:48.920
 So vitamin D3 is a good way to supplement with it.

1:26:48.920 --> 1:26:50.960
 Their vitamin D2 would be a plant source.

1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:54.360
 You often find it as fortified in foods like milk,

1:26:54.360 --> 1:26:55.200
 usually D2.

1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:56.040
 There's been a few-

1:26:56.040 --> 1:26:58.100
 Does anyone still drink milk besides kids?

1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:02.240
 Oh, here, it's like you can't find cow's milk.

1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:04.080
 I mean, all the latkes that you're getting.

1:27:04.080 --> 1:27:06.120
 Oat milk, soy milk, what's the other one?

1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:07.840
 They're fortified in those as well.

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:08.680
 Oh, they are, okay.

1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:09.760
 They are, yeah, they're fortified in-

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:10.600
 I have a hard time finding cow's milk.

1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:12.880
 Almond milk and oat milk and all that stuff.

1:27:12.880 --> 1:27:14.680
 Yeah, they're in all that stuff.

1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:19.120
 Vitamin D is naturally, to some degree, in fatty fish.

1:27:19.120 --> 1:27:23.040
 You think about cod liver oil, it has vitamin D,

1:27:23.040 --> 1:27:26.640
 but you're not going to correct a deficiency

1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:29.520
 with eating fish for your vitamin D.

1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:31.960
 You're either going to correct it with sun exposure,

1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:34.320
 being in the right area, having the right amount of sun,

1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:37.120
 and being the right age, because as you get old,

1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:39.600
 you become very inefficient at doing that,

1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:43.760
 converting vitamin D, making vitamin D3 in your skin.

1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:45.360
 Well, that's probably what was going on here,

1:27:45.360 --> 1:27:47.080
 because this person is getting up in their area.

1:27:47.080 --> 1:27:50.400
 There's a lot of single nucleotide polymorphisms.

1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:52.160
 We talked about ApoE4 previously,

1:27:52.160 --> 1:27:56.320
 but there's a variety of genes that people have,

1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:57.520
 very common, actually.

1:27:57.520 --> 1:27:58.800
 In fact, I've had many people

1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:01.120
 that have done that exact same thing.

1:28:01.120 --> 1:28:04.560
 So measuring your vitamin D levels

1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:06.320
 before and after supplementation

1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:08.440
 is the only way you're going to figure that out, right?

1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:09.280
 Very important.

1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:11.320
 If you don't measure it, you don't know.

1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:13.400
 You can't know what you don't measure.

1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:17.400
 So there's a variety of SNPs that basically

1:28:17.400 --> 1:28:19.160
 make that conversion inefficient.

1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:21.320
 And in fact, there have been a lot

1:28:21.320 --> 1:28:23.400
 of these Mendelian randomization studies.

1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:26.440
 So these are studies where people,

1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:30.680
 scientists will look at common SNPs,

1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:33.320
 people that have these common variations of a gene

1:28:33.320 --> 1:28:35.880
 that's more than 1% of the population.

1:28:35.880 --> 1:28:37.280
 So it's not a random mutation.

1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:41.320
 It's actually found in a sizable percent of the population.

1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:43.440
 And then they've looked at various outcomes.

1:28:43.440 --> 1:28:45.400
 And a lot of times, they'll look at genes

1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:47.960
 that are also involved in some kind of lifestyle factors,

1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:52.040
 so vitamin D and SNPs that basically make the conversion

1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:55.520
 of either vitamin D precursor into D3

1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:58.240
 or in D3 into 25-hydroxy vitamin D

1:28:58.240 --> 1:28:59.840
 or into the active steroid hormone,

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:02.160
 which is 125-hydroxy vitamin D.

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:05.640
 And there's a variety of different SNPs that show people.

1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:07.720
 So you're not looking at vitamin D levels at all.

1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:08.920
 You're looking at just the SNPs.

1:29:08.920 --> 1:29:11.560
 And you know if they have it, they have low vitamin D.

1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:14.520
 So it's really a way of doing

1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:17.400
 a beautifully randomized controlled trial

1:29:17.400 --> 1:29:22.280
 with an observational study because you're not biased.

1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:24.520
 Vitamin D levels are also associated with health.

1:29:24.520 --> 1:29:27.560
 People that have higher vitamin D are either outside more,

1:29:27.560 --> 1:29:28.720
 they're more physically active,

1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:30.440
 or they're aware of their health

1:29:30.440 --> 1:29:31.480
 and their supplementing, right?

1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:33.600
 So you always have to worry about that

1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:35.480
 when you're doing an observational study.

1:29:35.480 --> 1:29:37.800
 But Mendelian randomization is beautiful for that reason

1:29:37.800 --> 1:29:41.400
 where you now just, people randomly have these genes

1:29:41.400 --> 1:29:43.720
 and it's not like, there's no health status.

1:29:43.720 --> 1:29:46.560
 Like if you have the SNP, like your family member

1:29:46.560 --> 1:29:48.520
 was healthy and all that, they were healthy

1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:50.720
 and yet they couldn't get their D levels up, right?

1:29:50.720 --> 1:29:53.680
 So these Mendelian randomization studies have found

1:29:53.680 --> 1:29:58.000
 that people that can't convert into the precursor,

1:29:58.000 --> 1:29:59.360
 the 25-hydroxy vitamin D,

1:29:59.360 --> 1:30:00.440
 which is usually what's measured,

1:30:00.440 --> 1:30:03.560
 it's the most stable form of vitamin D in the body,

1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:06.280
 they have a higher all-cause mortality if they can't do it.

1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:08.040
 So people that don't have it

1:30:08.040 --> 1:30:09.600
 have a lower all-cause mortality.

1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:12.960
 They have a higher respiratory-related mortality.

1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:15.160
 They have a higher cancer-related mortality.

1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:19.200
 So to me, now why did I get on this rant?

1:30:19.200 --> 1:30:21.120
 Oh, because you're a family member.

1:30:21.120 --> 1:30:23.480
 So basically, they also are more likely

1:30:23.480 --> 1:30:24.480
 to get multiple sclerosis.

1:30:24.480 --> 1:30:26.320
 This has all been done with Mendelian randomization.

1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:29.600
 And so it really does hammer home the importance

1:30:29.600 --> 1:30:31.720
 of measuring your vitamin D levels

1:30:31.720 --> 1:30:34.840
 and being very proactive about that.

1:30:34.840 --> 1:30:36.840
 I mean, you can get it done anyway.

1:30:36.840 --> 1:30:37.680
 Your doctor will do it.

1:30:37.680 --> 1:30:39.160
 You ask them to do it.

1:30:39.160 --> 1:30:40.840
 So supplementation-wise,

1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:44.600
 typically if you don't have one of those SNPs,

1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:47.880
 for the most part, taking 1,000 IUs of vitamin D

1:30:47.880 --> 1:30:49.480
 will raise blood levels

1:30:49.480 --> 1:30:52.000
 by around five nanograms per milliliter.

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:53.200
 So let's say you're deficient,

1:30:53.200 --> 1:30:55.200
 you're 20 nanograms per milliliter

1:30:55.200 --> 1:30:57.060
 and you wanna get to 40.

1:30:57.060 --> 1:30:59.040
 You're gonna need at least 4,000 IUs

1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:02.600
 if you don't have any of these SNPs

1:31:02.600 --> 1:31:04.440
 that change your metabolism of vitamin D, right?

1:31:04.440 --> 1:31:08.240
 Does it matter when you take it relative to sun exposure,

1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:11.160
 time of day, with or without food?

1:31:11.160 --> 1:31:15.880
 I've seen some not so great preliminary evidence

1:31:15.880 --> 1:31:18.920
 suggesting maybe time of day is important.

1:31:18.920 --> 1:31:20.080
 I don't think it really,

1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:24.560
 like I can't seem to find anything that really suggests

1:31:24.560 --> 1:31:26.640
 because like for it to actually be converted

1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:28.600
 into the hormone, I mean, it's stored.

1:31:28.600 --> 1:31:29.440
 It's a slow acting.

1:31:29.440 --> 1:31:31.080
 These steroid hormones are slow acting.

1:31:31.080 --> 1:31:33.400
 Yeah, it's not like a media thing, right?

1:31:33.400 --> 1:31:37.000
 So like maybe we'll get some new data that's like otherwise,

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:38.400
 but I just don't, yeah.

1:31:38.400 --> 1:31:40.080
 It simplifies the problem anyway.

1:31:40.080 --> 1:31:42.520
 So for people who are going to be stubborn

1:31:42.520 --> 1:31:44.560
 and not get their D3 levels tested

1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:48.240
 or their D levels tested and simply say,

1:31:48.240 --> 1:31:49.980
 oh, I'll just take some D3.

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:55.080
 That was me, by the way, until I got tested.

1:31:55.080 --> 1:31:57.400
 I threw 5,000 IUs into the mix and figured,

1:31:57.400 --> 1:31:58.300
 well, it's not gonna kill me.

1:31:58.300 --> 1:32:00.180
 It'll bring my vitamin D levels up.

1:32:00.180 --> 1:32:03.480
 And I realized that's a bit of a coarse way to approach it,

1:32:03.480 --> 1:32:06.720
 but I feel fine and I'm still breathing an ambulatory.

1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:09.540
 So is that reasonable?

1:32:09.540 --> 1:32:12.580
 1,000 to 5,000 IUs for most people will be reasonably safe.

1:32:12.580 --> 1:32:13.840
 Again, we're not making,

1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:16.480
 just assuming that people are gonna just jump to it

1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:17.840
 without the blood test.

1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:18.680
 Of course.

1:32:18.680 --> 1:32:22.800
 I think that if we look at the literature,

1:32:22.800 --> 1:32:24.480
 the scientific literature,

1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:27.840
 it is extremely hard to get like hypercalcemia,

1:32:27.840 --> 1:32:30.660
 which would be the major concern with really high levels

1:32:30.660 --> 1:32:32.360
 of vitamin D3 supplementation.

1:32:32.360 --> 1:32:35.560
 I mean, we're talking like hundreds of thousands of IU

1:32:35.560 --> 1:32:38.040
 a day for a long time.

1:32:38.040 --> 1:32:38.860
 So-

1:32:38.860 --> 1:32:39.700
 Hundreds of thousands.

1:32:39.700 --> 1:32:40.720
 Yes, yes.

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:43.480
 Now the upper tolerable intake was set

1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:48.480
 by the Medicine Institute to be 4,000.

1:32:48.920 --> 1:32:49.960
 It was just like the safe,

1:32:49.960 --> 1:32:52.480
 it was kind of like one of those things where it's safe.

1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:55.560
 I personally take 5,000 IUs a day as well.

1:32:55.560 --> 1:32:59.960
 And my levels really hover around 50 nanograms per mil.

1:32:59.960 --> 1:33:04.560
 And I do out, I don't put sunscreen on like all the time.

1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:06.040
 Like I do put it on my face and I wear a hat,

1:33:06.040 --> 1:33:07.840
 but like some of my skin is being exposed.

1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:10.580
 So I do make it from the sun as well.

1:33:10.580 --> 1:33:11.420
 But-

1:33:11.420 --> 1:33:13.640
 I'm glad you brought up the fact

1:33:13.640 --> 1:33:15.320
 that you keep arms exposed if you,

1:33:15.320 --> 1:33:18.360
 because in these studies that I mentioned before,

1:33:18.360 --> 1:33:20.320
 looking at sun exposure on skin

1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:22.520
 and increases in other hormones,

1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:24.560
 testosterone, estrogen mainly,

1:33:24.560 --> 1:33:26.840
 it became clear from looking at those data

1:33:26.840 --> 1:33:30.000
 that the amount of skin that you expose is important,

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:31.680
 which makes perfect sense once you hear that.

1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:32.600
 But I think most people are thinking,

1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:34.240
 oh, I'm out in the sun,

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:37.040
 but are you wearing shorts and a t-shirt

1:33:37.040 --> 1:33:39.160
 or are you wearing a sweatshirt and it's a hoodie

1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:41.460
 or are you all covered up out in the sun?

1:33:41.460 --> 1:33:43.640
 Well, that might be great for setting your circadian rhythm

1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:45.440
 by way of a light to through the eyes

1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:47.360
 because that's the primary mechanism for that.

1:33:47.360 --> 1:33:51.060
 But it seems to me that the more of your body surface

1:33:51.060 --> 1:33:54.120
 that you can safely and appropriately,

1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:57.360
 please folks, appropriately exposed to the sun,

1:33:57.360 --> 1:33:59.700
 the more vitamin D you're going to create, right?

1:33:59.700 --> 1:34:03.840
 So laying out on your back deck in shorts and a t-shirt

1:34:03.840 --> 1:34:05.400
 with arms exposed and legs exposed

1:34:05.400 --> 1:34:07.440
 is a very different stimulus

1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:10.240
 than walking around in jeans and a sweatshirt.

1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:11.080
 Right?

1:34:11.080 --> 1:34:11.900
 Okay.

1:34:11.900 --> 1:34:12.740
 Okay.

1:34:12.740 --> 1:34:13.900
 Especially if you have sunscreen on your face.

1:34:13.900 --> 1:34:16.060
 I know it almost seems like trivially simple,

1:34:16.060 --> 1:34:18.040
 but I'm not sure that people are used to thinking

1:34:18.040 --> 1:34:22.800
 about their skin as a interface to create these hormones.

1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:24.440
 So surface area matters.

1:34:24.440 --> 1:34:27.600
 And by the way, there have been studies

1:34:27.600 --> 1:34:31.500
 looking at people that are deficient in vitamin D.

1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:33.360
 In this case, it was African-Americans

1:34:33.360 --> 1:34:36.540
 that were given a 4,000 IU a day vitamin D supplement

1:34:36.540 --> 1:34:38.940
 to bring them back to sufficient levels.

1:34:38.940 --> 1:34:43.360
 And this was a smaller study than I would like,

1:34:43.360 --> 1:34:47.840
 but it reversed their epigenetic aging by like three years

1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:51.180
 because again, it's a hormone.

1:34:51.180 --> 1:34:53.240
 It's regulating more than 5%

1:34:53.240 --> 1:34:55.560
 of your protein encoding human genome.

1:34:55.560 --> 1:34:57.200
 There's been studies looking at

1:34:57.200 --> 1:34:59.800
 vitamin D receptor knockout mice.

1:34:59.800 --> 1:35:01.720
 And I use this a lot in my presentations

1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:03.420
 when I'm talking about vitamin D and longevity.

1:35:03.420 --> 1:35:05.800
 But if you look at these animals,

1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:08.720
 the vitamin D receptor, as I mentioned earlier,

1:35:08.720 --> 1:35:10.520
 vitamin D binds to the receptor

1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:12.560
 and then it complexes with the retinoid receptor

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:14.080
 and they go into the nucleus of the complex

1:35:14.080 --> 1:35:16.140
 and you turn on and turn off genes.

1:35:16.140 --> 1:35:17.440
 Well, if you get rid of that receptor,

1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:20.320
 which is what you can do in animal studies,

1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:23.000
 you can sort of determine like what effects

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.120
 there will be with no vitamin D, right?

1:35:25.120 --> 1:35:27.040
 Like how do you study no vitamin D?

1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:31.000
 And so what was found was that these animals,

1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:34.080
 and in fact, I don't think it was a complete knockout

1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:36.160
 because I think it might be embryonic lethal, but-

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:37.720
 Some hypomorphism. Yes.

1:35:37.720 --> 1:35:40.400
 Which is basically geek speak for a gene

1:35:40.400 --> 1:35:44.800
 is vastly reduced in its number and function,

1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:46.320
 number, people know what I mean,

1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:48.940
 but isn't eliminated completely, yeah.

1:35:48.940 --> 1:35:50.400
 Right, well, these animals,

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:53.480
 if you look at them after the age of four months,

1:35:53.480 --> 1:35:56.520
 I mean, the mice look like,

1:35:56.520 --> 1:35:59.000
 I mean, they're accelerated aging, they're wrinkled,

1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.960
 they have no hair, I mean, they just,

1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:02.560
 I mean, their lifespan's shorter.

1:36:02.560 --> 1:36:04.560
 I mean, they just, you can look at this animal

1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:06.640
 and not know anything about mice or work with them

1:36:06.640 --> 1:36:10.160
 and be like, that animal looks like it's, you know,

1:36:10.160 --> 1:36:11.800
 of course, mice lifespans are only like two,

1:36:11.800 --> 1:36:14.440
 two and a half years, but like 500 years old.

1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:17.520
 Right, it looks like it went to graduate school twice.

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:19.200
 Actually graduate school is a lot of fun.

1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:21.120
 I like to think I age backwards in graduate school,

1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:21.940
 which is not true.

1:36:21.940 --> 1:36:24.160
 I look at the photos, I definitely aged forward.

1:36:24.160 --> 1:36:26.200
 You on the other hand look exactly the same way

1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:27.240
 you did 10 years ago.

1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:29.700
 I'm not saying that to flatter you, but it's absolutely true.

1:36:29.700 --> 1:36:32.360
 I mean, the data are the data, it's remarkable.

1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:34.320
 So I think it's, I'm definitely gonna try

1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:36.560
 and get my omega-3 percentage up there.

1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:38.560
 I'm not gonna, you know, hinge at all on that,

1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:40.900
 but clearly you're doing a lot of things right.

1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:44.720
 So if I'm taking vitamin D3,

1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:48.640
 I still need to get out into the sun, correct?

1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:50.840
 Okay, I think a lot of people don't know that,

1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:52.160
 or at least I have family members

1:36:52.160 --> 1:36:53.280
 that have been a little bit resistance.

1:36:53.280 --> 1:36:54.360
 Like I take my vitamin D,

1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:56.400
 so I don't need to get outside as much.

1:36:56.400 --> 1:36:58.160
 I think people are really afraid of getting out

1:36:58.160 --> 1:37:00.720
 into the sun because they're worried about melanomas.

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:04.880
 And I'm as, to be honest, I'm as scared of sunscreen

1:37:04.880 --> 1:37:06.360
 as I am of melanoma.

1:37:06.360 --> 1:37:09.420
 Like that some of the things in sunscreen are really spooky,

1:37:09.420 --> 1:37:10.800
 mainly the compound.

1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:12.600
 And here, I'm not one of these conspiracy,

1:37:12.600 --> 1:37:14.320
 I drink tap water with some folks.

1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:15.380
 Like people cringe with it.

1:37:15.380 --> 1:37:16.920
 I drink tap water.

1:37:16.920 --> 1:37:18.600
 I have the occasional croissant or donut.

1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:21.660
 I'm not, you know, I'm 90%, 80% of the time

1:37:21.660 --> 1:37:23.560
 I'm doing the right things the right way, I think,

1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:24.880
 although I'm now gonna improve on them

1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:25.720
 with this new knowledge.

1:37:25.720 --> 1:37:30.720
 But I don't like what I see in most sunscreens

1:37:30.840 --> 1:37:32.820
 because if you look at these compounds,

1:37:32.820 --> 1:37:35.040
 they cross the blood-brain barrier.

1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:38.080
 I don't want compounds crossing the blood-brain barrier.

1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:39.160
 Titanium dioxide?

1:37:39.160 --> 1:37:40.920
 Dioxide, some of the triclosans

1:37:40.920 --> 1:37:42.640
 that are also in these cleansers.

1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:46.600
 I mean, once you know a little bit about neurons, folks,

1:37:46.600 --> 1:37:48.200
 you realize that the neurons you got

1:37:48.200 --> 1:37:50.700
 are basically the ones you've got for your entire life.

1:37:50.700 --> 1:37:52.740
 You know, there's a reason why there's a blood-brain barrier,

1:37:52.740 --> 1:37:54.920
 a blood ovary, and a blood testes barrier

1:37:54.920 --> 1:37:56.600
 is because the genetic material resides

1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:57.680
 in the testes, the ovaries,

1:37:57.680 --> 1:37:59.400
 and the brain, those neurons don't turn over.

1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:00.560
 There are a few new neurons,

1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:03.440
 but not that many unless you're a mouse, frankly.

1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:05.220
 And so protecting those is very key.

1:38:05.220 --> 1:38:07.160
 And a lot of the things in sunscreen

1:38:08.380 --> 1:38:10.040
 are downright dangerous.

1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:12.600
 So I think there are sunscreens that are safe,

1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:14.680
 but it's very hard to figure out

1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:17.840
 which sunscreens are free of these compounds.

1:38:17.840 --> 1:38:20.160
 I'm amazed that they're still on the market, frankly.

1:38:20.160 --> 1:38:22.800
 I've always geared towards the ones

1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:26.440
 with the minerals that are like reflecting it.

1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:29.560
 It is somewhat difficult to penetrate things

1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:32.620
 all the way through the skin, get into the bloodstream.

1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:33.920
 I don't, but I don't know,

1:38:33.920 --> 1:38:35.760
 maybe some of these compounds get in there easily.

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:38.280
 I have seen the evidence with some of those things.

1:38:38.280 --> 1:38:41.640
 Yeah, there is some evidence they go transdermal.

1:38:41.640 --> 1:38:42.960
 And they get in, okay, well,

1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:45.880
 I know that some of them react with the sun.

1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:49.120
 And while they do protect from the UVA and or B,

1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:51.600
 they like form massive reactive oxygen species

1:38:51.600 --> 1:38:53.160
 and carcinogen.

1:38:53.160 --> 1:38:54.280
 I mean, it's like the very thing

1:38:54.280 --> 1:38:56.320
 you're trying to protect yourself from

1:38:56.320 --> 1:38:59.040
 might actually cause, we don't know.

1:38:59.040 --> 1:39:01.240
 I mean, like it's completely speculation.

1:39:01.240 --> 1:39:04.360
 But there is like, I think some more and more evidence

1:39:04.360 --> 1:39:05.480
 coming out with some of those compounds.

1:39:05.480 --> 1:39:08.240
 And I can't remember all of them off the top of my head,

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:12.060
 but a lot of high-end ones also have,

1:39:12.060 --> 1:39:14.880
 it's the chemical sunscreen ones, the chemical ones.

1:39:14.880 --> 1:39:17.360
 We should do, I'm proposing that we do a journal club.

1:39:17.360 --> 1:39:19.520
 A journal club, folks, is where academics get together

1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:21.920
 and read papers and they get together

1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:23.680
 and they pick apart the papers.

1:39:23.680 --> 1:39:25.240
 There's a strong correlation

1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:27.080
 between being an early graduate student

1:39:27.080 --> 1:39:28.200
 and being the most critical.

1:39:28.200 --> 1:39:29.640
 Because once you've actually published some papers,

1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:33.320
 you realize that most studies, people are doing their best

1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:34.980
 within the context of what they can do.

1:39:34.980 --> 1:39:37.360
 But it'd be great to do a journal club at some point

1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:38.880
 about sunscreens.

1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:40.180
 Because I'd love to really figure out

1:39:40.180 --> 1:39:41.360
 what's in these compounds.

1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:43.120
 I mean, people are using them like crazy.

1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:44.400
 And I'm not one of these people who's like,

1:39:44.400 --> 1:39:47.920
 oh, I won't use commercial toothpaste or anything like that.

1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:49.240
 Like I said, I drink tap water,

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:50.800
 I use commercial toothpaste, whatever.

1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:52.700
 But when it comes to sunscreen, it freaks me out

1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:55.760
 because some of these compounds do go transdermal

1:39:55.760 --> 1:39:57.920
 and some of them cross the blood brain barrier.

1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:00.760
 And I'd like to keep my neurons free of that stuff.

1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:02.360
 Anyway, we're speculating now.

1:40:02.360 --> 1:40:03.180
 Wear a hat.

1:40:03.180 --> 1:40:04.020
 Wear a hat.

1:40:04.020 --> 1:40:08.060
 But get out in the sun and get your D3 levels up.

1:40:08.060 --> 1:40:10.620
 Okay, so we've talked about these plant-based compounds,

1:40:10.620 --> 1:40:13.240
 the omega-3s and D3.

1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:16.620
 Unless there's something else that you just absolutely

1:40:16.620 --> 1:40:18.180
 must throw into the mix,

1:40:18.180 --> 1:40:21.060
 I probably will return us to the conversation

1:40:21.060 --> 1:40:23.100
 that I opened up with, which is about cold and heat,

1:40:23.100 --> 1:40:25.860
 which admittedly I pulled us off that path.

1:40:25.860 --> 1:40:28.340
 So I want to take full responsibility for that.

1:40:28.340 --> 1:40:29.740
 But before I do that,

1:40:29.740 --> 1:40:31.100
 I just want to offer you the opportunity.

1:40:31.100 --> 1:40:36.100
 Is there anything that fit to supplement-based

1:40:36.680 --> 1:40:40.620
 or food-based compounds that you think

1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:43.660
 are especially useful for brain and or body health?

1:40:43.660 --> 1:40:46.460
 I do think magnesium is important in there as well.

1:40:46.460 --> 1:40:48.980
 I mean, I think, you know, again,

1:40:48.980 --> 1:40:50.960
 about 40% of the U.S. population

1:40:50.960 --> 1:40:52.500
 doesn't get enough magnesium.

1:40:52.500 --> 1:40:55.060
 It's an essential mineral we're supposed to be getting

1:40:55.060 --> 1:40:56.460
 from our diet and it's-

1:40:56.460 --> 1:40:57.700
 Involved in everything.

1:40:57.700 --> 1:40:58.700
 It is.

1:40:58.700 --> 1:41:01.300
 It's also involved in vitamin D metabolism.

1:41:01.300 --> 1:41:04.460
 And in fact, being deficient in magnesium

1:41:04.460 --> 1:41:06.380
 may make it more difficult for you

1:41:06.380 --> 1:41:09.740
 to actually make vitamin D hormone,

1:41:09.740 --> 1:41:12.020
 so that 125-hydroxyvitamin D.

1:41:12.020 --> 1:41:14.540
 So one of those other factors, again,

1:41:14.540 --> 1:41:15.520
 we talked about genetics,

1:41:15.520 --> 1:41:17.660
 but there's also magnesium status as well.

1:41:17.660 --> 1:41:20.700
 Considering 40%, that's a big number.

1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:25.700
 Now, you know, magnesium's also involved in making ATP,

1:41:26.260 --> 1:41:28.660
 the energetic currency of our cells.

1:41:28.660 --> 1:41:29.820
 They're, you know, basically,

1:41:29.820 --> 1:41:31.860
 all of our cells need ATP to do anything.

1:41:31.860 --> 1:41:35.300
 And it's also involved in utilizing ATP,

1:41:35.300 --> 1:41:36.920
 as well as DNA repair enzymes.

1:41:36.920 --> 1:41:38.080
 These are enzymes that are involved

1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:40.020
 in repairing damage to our DNA.

1:41:40.020 --> 1:41:43.460
 I personally think that magnesium insufficiency

1:41:45.460 --> 1:41:48.260
 causes an insidious type of damage daily

1:41:48.260 --> 1:41:50.380
 that you can't look in the mirror and see.

1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:53.260
 Like, when you're deficient in vitamin C,

1:41:53.260 --> 1:41:55.460
 you're like, my gums are falling apart.

1:41:55.460 --> 1:41:56.640
 I have scurvy, right?

1:41:56.640 --> 1:41:58.580
 But like, you can't see DNA damage.

1:41:58.580 --> 1:41:59.640
 You can't see it, but it's happening.

1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:00.860
 It's happening right now in my body,

1:42:00.860 --> 1:42:01.700
 and it's happening in your body.

1:42:01.700 --> 1:42:03.900
 It's happening, normal metabolism is happening,

1:42:03.900 --> 1:42:05.740
 you know, every day.

1:42:05.740 --> 1:42:07.140
 But we repair that damage.

1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:09.220
 We have repair enzymes in our body

1:42:09.220 --> 1:42:10.860
 called DNA repair enzymes.

1:42:10.860 --> 1:42:12.260
 They require magnesium.

1:42:12.260 --> 1:42:15.220
 Magnesium is a cofactor for them.

1:42:15.220 --> 1:42:16.380
 What that means is, you know,

1:42:16.380 --> 1:42:19.660
 a cofactor means enzymes need it to function properly.

1:42:19.660 --> 1:42:22.700
 And so without that cofactor,

1:42:22.700 --> 1:42:23.820
 they're not doing it properly.

1:42:23.820 --> 1:42:27.140
 And I like, the way I like to think about magnesium,

1:42:27.140 --> 1:42:29.260
 it's easy because people go, what food should I eat, right?

1:42:29.260 --> 1:42:30.780
 Naturally, that's the next question.

1:42:30.780 --> 1:42:34.160
 Well, magnesium is at the center of a chlorophyll molecule.

1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:36.720
 Chlorophyll is what gives plants their green color.

1:42:36.720 --> 1:42:41.140
 So dark leafy greens are high in magnesium.

1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:42.480
 It's one of the, and basically,

1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:46.620
 what does the 40% insufficiency in the U.S. tell us?

1:42:46.620 --> 1:42:47.820
 People aren't eating their greens.

1:42:47.820 --> 1:42:48.780
 They're not eating their greens.

1:42:48.780 --> 1:42:49.780
 They're eating their packaged food.

1:42:49.780 --> 1:42:50.740
 They're eating their processed food.

1:42:50.740 --> 1:42:52.480
 Standard American diet isn't really high

1:42:52.480 --> 1:42:54.160
 in dark leafy greens.

1:42:54.160 --> 1:42:57.780
 So dark leafy greens are how I like to get my magnesium.

1:42:57.780 --> 1:43:00.560
 I think it comes along with all these other important,

1:43:00.560 --> 1:43:03.660
 I mean, you get calcium in them, you get vitamin K1,

1:43:03.660 --> 1:43:05.220
 you're getting a lot of other micronutrients,

1:43:05.220 --> 1:43:07.540
 and you're getting other compounds that we don't know about

1:43:07.540 --> 1:43:10.380
 and ones that we know about, like sulforaphane, right?

1:43:12.300 --> 1:43:15.860
 As with broccoli, do I need to eat

1:43:15.860 --> 1:43:18.020
 the dark leafy greens raw?

1:43:18.020 --> 1:43:19.860
 And in this case, I'm a little more open to it

1:43:19.860 --> 1:43:22.640
 because I actually like the taste of, dare I say, kale.

1:43:22.640 --> 1:43:25.260
 And kale is a dark leafy green, right?

1:43:25.260 --> 1:43:26.100
 It's obviously-

1:43:26.100 --> 1:43:27.920
 And it's high in lutein and zeaxanthin as well.

1:43:27.920 --> 1:43:29.020
 Yeah, no, I'm going to try chromatin,

1:43:29.020 --> 1:43:30.380
 meaning I'm not colorblind,

1:43:30.380 --> 1:43:31.940
 but I just want to make sure it falls

1:43:31.940 --> 1:43:33.060
 under the strict category.

1:43:33.060 --> 1:43:34.100
 Because every once in a while, I'm like,

1:43:34.100 --> 1:43:34.940
 oh, I eat my vegetables.

1:43:34.940 --> 1:43:35.780
 I like avocados.

1:43:35.780 --> 1:43:37.660
 And people were reminding me avocados is not a vegetable.

1:43:37.660 --> 1:43:39.540
 I love vegetables also.

1:43:39.540 --> 1:43:41.820
 But so kale, what are some other examples?

1:43:41.820 --> 1:43:44.380
 Kale, spinach, chard, like Swiss chard,

1:43:44.380 --> 1:43:47.140
 rainbow chard, romaine lettuce.

1:43:47.140 --> 1:43:49.140
 Is the bitterness an important component to this?

1:43:49.140 --> 1:43:49.980
 I know everything-

1:43:49.980 --> 1:43:53.060
 I don't know, but for sulforaphane,

1:43:53.060 --> 1:43:54.840
 sulforaphane for cruciferous vegetables,

1:43:54.840 --> 1:43:58.700
 that would be the brassica family.

1:43:58.700 --> 1:44:02.060
 But your question about cooking them,

1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:05.420
 so magnesium is, it is bound to the food matrix.

1:44:05.420 --> 1:44:10.420
 And it can be somewhat less bioavailable.

1:44:11.700 --> 1:44:16.700
 But so cooking it can somewhat release the magnesium,

1:44:17.180 --> 1:44:18.940
 but it goes into the water too.

1:44:18.940 --> 1:44:21.700
 So you have to either steam it

1:44:21.700 --> 1:44:24.740
 or kind of get your water in with it.

1:44:24.740 --> 1:44:26.140
 You can drink it.

1:44:26.140 --> 1:44:28.860
 Yeah, I personally don't worry about it.

1:44:28.860 --> 1:44:29.700
 I just don't worry.

1:44:29.700 --> 1:44:30.520
 Great.

1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:31.360
 Well, if you don't worry, I'm not gonna worry.

1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:33.260
 But I also like, I too supplement with magnesium.

1:44:33.260 --> 1:44:37.220
 I do take around, so supplementation with magnesium,

1:44:37.220 --> 1:44:39.220
 I mean, we could go on and on.

1:44:39.220 --> 1:44:40.700
 Let's keep this short and sweet

1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:42.100
 because we're gonna get back to the other stuff.

1:44:42.100 --> 1:44:45.820
 But it can cause GI distress at high doses.

1:44:45.820 --> 1:44:50.820
 I personally like to take around 130 or 135 milligrams.

1:44:50.980 --> 1:44:53.900
 That way it's not like a huge bolus to my gut.

1:44:53.900 --> 1:44:55.900
 But I think it depends on the form of magnesium too.

1:44:55.900 --> 1:44:56.860
 Yes, yeah.

1:44:56.860 --> 1:45:00.080
 I mean, you can take like magnesium 3N8, for example,

1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:04.660
 and it doesn't affect the gut as much.

1:45:04.660 --> 1:45:06.020
 Magnesium citrate.

1:45:06.020 --> 1:45:07.040
 Citrate is what I take.

1:45:07.040 --> 1:45:12.040
 Yeah, it's a pretty potent gut stimulus.

1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:14.060
 I mean, I feel like it's a little bit harder to digest.

1:45:14.060 --> 1:45:16.940
 Well, I take 135 milligrams should be pretty good.

1:45:16.940 --> 1:45:19.660
 And citrate actually, oh boy, do we wanna go here?

1:45:19.660 --> 1:45:20.500
 So-

1:45:20.500 --> 1:45:23.460
 I mean, it's up to you and we can, we don't have to.

1:45:23.460 --> 1:45:25.840
 I personally, I've been supplementing with magnesium

1:45:25.840 --> 1:45:26.680
 for a long time.

1:45:26.680 --> 1:45:28.260
 Yeah.

1:45:28.260 --> 1:45:33.260
 I use 3N8 and bisglycinate and malate for different reasons.

1:45:35.220 --> 1:45:37.660
 So I, yes, I would love to go there if you're willing.

1:45:37.660 --> 1:45:39.180
 I would say malate would be the best.

1:45:39.180 --> 1:45:42.380
 And that has to do with the short chain fatty acids

1:45:42.380 --> 1:45:44.180
 being good for the gut and a lot of work done

1:45:44.180 --> 1:45:45.820
 by a former colleague of mine and good friend,

1:45:45.820 --> 1:45:48.380
 Mark Shiganaga, showing that the short chain fatty acid

1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:51.860
 citrate, malate, lactate, but specifically malate,

1:45:51.860 --> 1:45:53.780
 really, and lactate are the other major ones

1:45:53.780 --> 1:45:56.780
 that get into the gut epithelial cells

1:45:56.780 --> 1:45:59.020
 and are an energy source for the mitochondria

1:45:59.020 --> 1:46:00.460
 and the goblet cells.

1:46:00.460 --> 1:46:03.580
 So anyways, whole other topic.

1:46:03.580 --> 1:46:04.420
 That's okay.

1:46:04.420 --> 1:46:06.140
 Yeah, I take malate because I was told

1:46:06.140 --> 1:46:08.660
 that it would be helpful.

1:46:08.660 --> 1:46:10.180
 First of all, it doesn't make me sleepy

1:46:10.180 --> 1:46:12.180
 like some of the other forms of magnesium,

1:46:12.180 --> 1:46:14.960
 which act as a mild sedative for me.

1:46:15.820 --> 1:46:18.940
 They do tap into the GABAergic pathway,

1:46:18.940 --> 1:46:21.620
 neurotransmitter folks that in general,

1:46:21.620 --> 1:46:23.040
 broad sweeping generalization here,

1:46:23.040 --> 1:46:26.200
 can have somewhat of a sedative quality,

1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:28.860
 which is why I take magnesium 3N8

1:46:28.860 --> 1:46:31.320
 and or bisglycinate before sleep,

1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:32.620
 30 to 60 minutes before sleep.

1:46:32.620 --> 1:46:35.620
 Definitely enhances my transition time to sleep

1:46:36.540 --> 1:46:37.380
 and the depth of sleep.

1:46:37.380 --> 1:46:40.060
 No question in my experience.

1:46:40.060 --> 1:46:44.080
 There's some data that 3N8 can be neuroprotective,

1:46:44.080 --> 1:46:46.780
 although those studies are still ongoing.

1:46:46.780 --> 1:46:48.340
 I'm getting the sense that maybe

1:46:48.340 --> 1:46:50.420
 you're a little more skeptical of that than I am.

1:46:50.420 --> 1:46:53.700
 Yeah, no, I've seen the studies with the 3N8.

1:46:53.700 --> 1:46:56.060
 I think like looking at the actual data

1:46:56.060 --> 1:46:59.160
 from the one clinical study,

1:46:59.160 --> 1:47:01.100
 there wasn't statistical significance

1:47:01.100 --> 1:47:04.780
 until all three of the pieces of data were pulled together,

1:47:04.780 --> 1:47:05.740
 but that really could just be

1:47:05.740 --> 1:47:07.860
 because their sample size was too small, right?

1:47:07.860 --> 1:47:10.140
 So I mean- Yeah, I'm thinking that that paired with the-

1:47:10.140 --> 1:47:10.980
 The animal stuff.

1:47:10.980 --> 1:47:13.180
 Yeah, the Guosong Liu's work on with,

1:47:13.180 --> 1:47:15.300
 so in the, this is getting kind of

1:47:15.300 --> 1:47:17.580
 into inside ball of neuroscience,

1:47:17.580 --> 1:47:19.940
 the quality of the labs matters, folks,

1:47:19.940 --> 1:47:21.560
 and that's something that's not accessible

1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:22.680
 to people outside of fields.

1:47:22.680 --> 1:47:25.740
 And Guosong Liu and some of the other folks

1:47:25.740 --> 1:47:29.380
 at that time at MIT, I think very highly of their work.

1:47:29.380 --> 1:47:32.500
 And so the animal studies are indeed just animal studies,

1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:34.620
 but I was pretty impressed by what they did

1:47:34.620 --> 1:47:36.500
 in those studies, very pioneering

1:47:36.500 --> 1:47:40.260
 when you think about this being done 10, 12, 15 years ago.

1:47:40.260 --> 1:47:42.780
 And then, yes, we need more human clinical data,

1:47:42.780 --> 1:47:46.300
 but for me, I figured that given the safety profile

1:47:46.300 --> 1:47:48.580
 of MAG3N8, given that it helps me sleep better

1:47:48.580 --> 1:47:52.780
 and sleeping better is just better for everything, frankly,

1:47:52.780 --> 1:47:53.660
 that's why I take it.

1:47:53.660 --> 1:47:56.980
 And bisglycinate and 3N8 seem to be somewhat interchangeable,

1:47:56.980 --> 1:47:58.860
 but I don't know of any reports

1:47:58.860 --> 1:48:00.980
 that bisglycinate can be neuroprotective.

1:48:00.980 --> 1:48:03.060
 But malate, I take sure in the daytime,

1:48:04.300 --> 1:48:06.000
 for me, and again, this is subjective,

1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.380
 it has a tangible effect in improving

1:48:08.380 --> 1:48:10.420
 the recovery time from exercise.

1:48:10.420 --> 1:48:13.340
 So I don't know that I've been sore from a workout

1:48:13.340 --> 1:48:14.860
 since I started taking malate,

1:48:14.860 --> 1:48:17.020
 and I used to get very sore

1:48:17.020 --> 1:48:19.380
 from even kind of trivial workouts.

1:48:19.380 --> 1:48:20.740
 So I don't know what's going on there,

1:48:20.740 --> 1:48:22.380
 but I keep taking it.

1:48:22.380 --> 1:48:24.920
 Malate, again, the short chain fatty acid,

1:48:24.920 --> 1:48:28.900
 and I mean, when you do intense exercise,

1:48:28.900 --> 1:48:31.780
 you release endotoxin from your gut.

1:48:31.780 --> 1:48:33.500
 I'm just going back to the interesting work

1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:35.940
 because the malate being the short chain fatty acid

1:48:35.940 --> 1:48:38.860
 and Mark Sugarnog is showing,

1:48:38.860 --> 1:48:40.940
 this is all in animal research, by the way,

1:48:40.940 --> 1:48:43.940
 but I mean, it was like feeding these animals malate,

1:48:43.940 --> 1:48:46.540
 and it really protected the gut, endotoxin release,

1:48:46.540 --> 1:48:49.460
 and it affected metabolic syndrome and all sorts of things.

1:48:49.460 --> 1:48:50.940
 But I think malate's awesome,

1:48:50.940 --> 1:48:52.660
 and I always try to eat green apples.

1:48:52.660 --> 1:48:53.940
 They're really high in malic acid.

1:48:53.940 --> 1:48:54.780
 Oh, good to know.

1:48:54.780 --> 1:48:57.340
 And tart cherries, tart cherries are really high in it

1:48:57.340 --> 1:48:58.180
 as well, so.

1:48:58.180 --> 1:48:59.020
 They also taste really good.

1:48:59.020 --> 1:49:00.420
 But I was really interested

1:49:00.420 --> 1:49:01.740
 in the magnesium 3N8 stuff.

1:49:01.740 --> 1:49:05.780
 I take a supplement called Magnesium by Moon Juice,

1:49:05.780 --> 1:49:07.820
 and it's like a little powder.

1:49:07.820 --> 1:49:09.980
 It's got a little bit of monk fruit, but it tastes good,

1:49:09.980 --> 1:49:13.260
 so I do it a little bit before bedtime as well,

1:49:13.260 --> 1:49:14.900
 probably several more hours though,

1:49:14.900 --> 1:49:16.860
 because I don't like to drink tons and tons of fluids

1:49:16.860 --> 1:49:17.700
 before I go to bed,

1:49:17.700 --> 1:49:19.540
 and it has magnesium 3N8

1:49:19.540 --> 1:49:23.020
 and a variety of other versions of magnesium in it as well,

1:49:23.020 --> 1:49:24.060
 and I really like it.

1:49:24.060 --> 1:49:25.940
 But I thought the magnesium 3N8 stuff

1:49:25.940 --> 1:49:27.540
 was super interesting.

1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:29.500
 I would love to see more clinical data as well,

1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:31.140
 but I think once we get it,

1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:31.980
 it'll probably be like,

1:49:31.980 --> 1:49:33.300
 oh, yeah, it's getting into the brain,

1:49:33.300 --> 1:49:35.220
 and it's awesome, so why wait?

1:49:35.220 --> 1:49:37.420
 Right, and along those lines,

1:49:37.420 --> 1:49:40.140
 I once put out a post that said,

1:49:40.140 --> 1:49:41.460
 you know, I feel like there are a number

1:49:41.460 --> 1:49:45.020
 of different categories of health information consumers

1:49:45.020 --> 1:49:47.380
 online and understanding which one you're in

1:49:47.380 --> 1:49:49.460
 for which topic can alleviate a lot of the strain

1:49:49.460 --> 1:49:50.940
 and stress of finding the information.

1:49:50.940 --> 1:49:52.980
 There's some people that are perfectly comfortable

1:49:52.980 --> 1:49:54.140
 with data from a mouse study.

1:49:54.140 --> 1:49:56.420
 It's like if it's done in mice, great, I'll try it.

1:49:56.420 --> 1:49:59.220
 Other people say, no, it has to be done in humans,

1:49:59.220 --> 1:50:01.380
 double-blind placebo-controlled studies,

1:50:01.380 --> 1:50:04.100
 randomized clinical trials, et cetera.

1:50:04.100 --> 1:50:05.660
 And other people are just say, you know what?

1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:06.860
 I don't even care about any of that.

1:50:06.860 --> 1:50:08.500
 Just tell me what you do.

1:50:08.500 --> 1:50:09.620
 And then other people are saying, you know what?

1:50:09.620 --> 1:50:10.580
 I don't even care what you do.

1:50:10.580 --> 1:50:12.060
 Just tell me what to do.

1:50:12.060 --> 1:50:13.740
 And then there's this other category,

1:50:13.740 --> 1:50:15.700
 which are if it's in pill form or powder form,

1:50:15.700 --> 1:50:16.620
 they'll take it.

1:50:16.620 --> 1:50:18.420
 And so I think a lot of the battles

1:50:18.420 --> 1:50:20.980
 of people picking apart people's posts and things

1:50:20.980 --> 1:50:23.540
 have to do with the fact that people don't realize

1:50:23.540 --> 1:50:26.700
 that people are showing up to the table

1:50:26.700 --> 1:50:29.940
 in one or some combination of those stances.

1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:31.380
 We know people that will try anything,

1:50:31.380 --> 1:50:33.220
 and we know people that won't take anything.

1:50:33.220 --> 1:50:38.220
 So the idea here is to create an array of possibilities

1:50:38.300 --> 1:50:40.180
 for people, and I think the animal data

1:50:40.180 --> 1:50:41.900
 are very impressive.

1:50:41.900 --> 1:50:43.020
 We should have you back on to talk-

1:50:43.020 --> 1:50:44.380
 I take it with the hope of,

1:50:44.380 --> 1:50:47.020
 because I feel like the animal data is very promising.

1:50:47.020 --> 1:50:50.020
 And so I'm like, it probably is, so why not?

1:50:50.020 --> 1:50:52.420
 Well, and obviously you're doing things right.

1:50:53.460 --> 1:50:58.460
 So cold and heat converge on some common pathways

1:50:59.220 --> 1:51:02.260
 related to what you called intermittent challenge,

1:51:02.260 --> 1:51:03.100
 which I love.

1:51:03.100 --> 1:51:08.100
 I think if intermittent fasting, cold, heat, exercise,

1:51:08.100 --> 1:51:10.060
 I mean, maybe even intermittent sleep deprivation,

1:51:10.060 --> 1:51:11.140
 I keep waiting for the intermittent

1:51:11.140 --> 1:51:12.220
 sleep deprivation movement.

1:51:12.220 --> 1:51:15.180
 I will say I pull a few all-nighters per year

1:51:15.180 --> 1:51:18.580
 just for work demands and procrastination and deadlines.

1:51:18.580 --> 1:51:22.140
 And I'm the worst combination of academic

1:51:22.140 --> 1:51:24.700
 because I'm both a procrastinator and a perfectionist.

1:51:24.700 --> 1:51:26.900
 So you end up pulling some all-nighters.

1:51:26.900 --> 1:51:29.780
 The sleep I get the next night is pretty amazing.

1:51:29.780 --> 1:51:31.820
 I must say it's the sleep of gods,

1:51:31.820 --> 1:51:34.020
 but I don't recommend anyone use sleep deprivation for that.

1:51:34.020 --> 1:51:35.940
 But I could imagine that we also evolved

1:51:35.940 --> 1:51:37.900
 having some sleepless nights.

1:51:37.900 --> 1:51:40.060
 So this idea of intermittent challenges

1:51:40.060 --> 1:51:41.020
 is a really attractive one.

1:51:41.020 --> 1:51:42.340
 And I want to make sure that we credit you

1:51:42.340 --> 1:51:43.820
 with the phrase intermittent challenge.

1:51:43.820 --> 1:51:45.700
 No, credit Dr. Mark Mattson.

1:51:45.700 --> 1:51:47.540
 Okay, Dr. Mark Mattson gets credit.

1:51:47.540 --> 1:51:49.820
 Who has published and he has used that phrase.

1:51:49.820 --> 1:51:50.980
 Okay, great, we'll make sure.

1:51:50.980 --> 1:51:54.100
 Just like Dr. David Sinclair, I love the xenohormesis.

1:51:54.100 --> 1:51:56.540
 He was in like one of his publications just so many years ago

1:51:56.540 --> 1:51:57.380
 and I just love it.

1:51:57.380 --> 1:51:59.020
 It's brilliant, a brilliant term.

1:51:59.020 --> 1:52:00.860
 So Mark Mattson gets credit for that.

1:52:00.860 --> 1:52:02.060
 Those are pretty smart.

1:52:03.060 --> 1:52:05.700
 I mean, it's a good school, I guess.

1:52:05.700 --> 1:52:07.740
 Of course, it's a good school.

1:52:07.740 --> 1:52:09.460
 We will credit the appropriate people.

1:52:09.460 --> 1:52:11.340
 Thank you for that clarification.

1:52:11.340 --> 1:52:16.340
 So you've talked a lot about the use of deliberate,

1:52:16.420 --> 1:52:17.900
 what I call deliberate cold exposure,

1:52:17.900 --> 1:52:19.780
 only to distinguish it from cold

1:52:19.780 --> 1:52:21.580
 that you might just be accidentally exposed to.

1:52:21.580 --> 1:52:24.740
 But it's sort of obvious when we say cold exposure.

1:52:24.740 --> 1:52:27.420
 There are some amazing data on cold.

1:52:27.420 --> 1:52:29.140
 The other day I saw a post from you

1:52:29.140 --> 1:52:30.480
 and you've included this in talks

1:52:30.480 --> 1:52:32.820
 before I did not know this until I learned it from you.

1:52:32.820 --> 1:52:33.940
 So credit to you.

1:52:33.940 --> 1:52:38.340
 That even 20 seconds of immersion in,

1:52:38.340 --> 1:52:39.740
 I think it was four degree.

1:52:39.740 --> 1:52:41.020
 49 degree Fahrenheit.

1:52:41.020 --> 1:52:42.720
 49 degree Fahrenheit.

1:52:42.720 --> 1:52:43.940
 Okay, I was translating this.

1:52:43.940 --> 1:52:45.260
 49 degree Fahrenheit water.

1:52:45.260 --> 1:52:48.340
 So cold water can lead to long lasting increases

1:52:48.340 --> 1:52:49.700
 in epinephrine, adrenaline.

1:52:50.980 --> 1:52:54.500
 And I have to presume other neuromodulators

1:52:54.500 --> 1:52:55.860
 and neurochemicals as well.

1:52:56.760 --> 1:52:58.900
 What are some cold protocols

1:52:58.900 --> 1:53:02.460
 that you find particularly interesting or attractive

1:53:02.460 --> 1:53:05.020
 from the standpoint of, I don't know,

1:53:05.020 --> 1:53:10.020
 pick your favorite metabolism, neuro slash mood effects,

1:53:11.660 --> 1:53:12.840
 brown fat stimulation,

1:53:12.840 --> 1:53:15.620
 which of course weaves back to metabolism.

1:53:15.620 --> 1:53:17.860
 We could do an entire episode all about cold,

1:53:17.860 --> 1:53:21.740
 but what I'd love to know is what sort of activity

1:53:21.740 --> 1:53:24.540
 or stimulus do you think is a reasonable

1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:28.940
 and particularly potent one to use in terms of cold?

1:53:28.940 --> 1:53:32.620
 So today I did three minutes at 49 degrees Fahrenheit.

1:53:32.620 --> 1:53:33.820
 I have a cold tub.

1:53:33.820 --> 1:53:35.340
 So you get in up to your neck?

1:53:35.340 --> 1:53:36.180
 Well, I try.

1:53:36.180 --> 1:53:37.940
 I keep floating up.

1:53:37.940 --> 1:53:40.200
 And so I'm like, it's like really hard.

1:53:40.200 --> 1:53:45.200
 So like I would say like maybe most of my shoulder.

1:53:45.580 --> 1:53:46.780
 I mean, really I'm floating up.

1:53:46.780 --> 1:53:49.020
 I was telling my husband, I was like,

1:53:49.020 --> 1:53:50.260
 there's too much water in here for me.

1:53:50.260 --> 1:53:51.420
 I can't- Or too much salt in there?

1:53:51.420 --> 1:53:53.700
 Is it like the Dead Sea where you float on top?

1:53:53.700 --> 1:53:54.540
 Is there salt in there?

1:53:54.540 --> 1:53:55.380
 I don't know.

1:53:55.380 --> 1:53:57.220
 He takes care of all the stuff that,

1:53:57.220 --> 1:53:59.700
 it's the plunge.

1:53:59.700 --> 1:54:01.260
 Yeah, and by the way,

1:54:01.260 --> 1:54:03.060
 the podcast where I am sponsored by Plunge,

1:54:03.060 --> 1:54:03.940
 they did give me one.

1:54:03.940 --> 1:54:05.080
 That thing is fantastic.

1:54:05.080 --> 1:54:06.500
 Also because it circulates the water.

1:54:06.500 --> 1:54:07.340
 It does.

1:54:07.340 --> 1:54:08.460
 Which makes sure that you break up the thermal layer

1:54:08.460 --> 1:54:09.580
 and it's even colder.

1:54:09.580 --> 1:54:10.540
 It is even colder.

1:54:10.540 --> 1:54:11.460
 It sucks.

1:54:11.460 --> 1:54:16.160
 Anyways, so look, I'll give it a,

1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:17.220
 I'll be honest here.

1:54:17.220 --> 1:54:19.020
 I wish I did more cold than I do.

1:54:19.020 --> 1:54:21.500
 I do cold when I'm gonna go on a podcast.

1:54:21.500 --> 1:54:24.100
 I definitely do cold when I'm gonna do a podcast,

1:54:24.100 --> 1:54:26.820
 when I'm gonna give a talk or when I'm anxious.

1:54:26.820 --> 1:54:28.960
 I need to make it more of a ritual.

1:54:28.960 --> 1:54:30.940
 I love doing the sauna.

1:54:30.940 --> 1:54:31.780
 I hate the cold.

1:54:31.780 --> 1:54:32.600
 I hate it.

1:54:32.600 --> 1:54:33.440
 Unless it's summertime.

1:54:33.440 --> 1:54:34.620
 It's a lot easier for me to get in the cold

1:54:34.620 --> 1:54:35.440
 in the summertime.

1:54:35.440 --> 1:54:40.440
 But what I do love about the cold is how I feel after.

1:54:40.700 --> 1:54:44.460
 And I feel less anxious.

1:54:44.460 --> 1:54:45.940
 I feel good.

1:54:45.940 --> 1:54:47.100
 I feel more focused,

1:54:47.100 --> 1:54:49.540
 which is why I usually do it before,

1:54:49.540 --> 1:54:54.540
 any type of public speaking or just when I'm just anxious.

1:54:54.620 --> 1:54:55.460
 I'll just get in there.

1:54:55.460 --> 1:54:59.060
 And so the 20 seconds at 49 degrees,

1:54:59.060 --> 1:55:01.060
 I think it was 49 degrees Fahrenheit,

1:55:01.060 --> 1:55:06.060
 was really a good number because time and temperature do,

1:55:06.300 --> 1:55:08.980
 time or duration, I guess would be a better word,

1:55:08.980 --> 1:55:11.180
 and temperature do matter.

1:55:11.180 --> 1:55:16.180
 But you can do 20 seconds at a colder temperature,

1:55:16.340 --> 1:55:17.220
 which is I prefer.

1:55:17.220 --> 1:55:21.020
 Or you can do a minute or longer at a warmer temperature.

1:55:21.020 --> 1:55:23.460
 I think there was another study showing

1:55:23.460 --> 1:55:25.780
 59 degrees Fahrenheit at one hour.

1:55:25.780 --> 1:55:26.860
 It was like two, three, four.

1:55:26.860 --> 1:55:28.300
 But who wants to do one hour?

1:55:28.300 --> 1:55:30.380
 Yeah, I'm familiar with that study.

1:55:30.380 --> 1:55:31.940
 I love, so this is really,

1:55:31.940 --> 1:55:34.900
 reveals just how absolutely nerdy I am

1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:37.580
 and maybe why some times and relationships in my life

1:55:37.580 --> 1:55:38.400
 were challenged.

1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:41.100
 I love reading the method sections of papers.

1:55:41.100 --> 1:55:43.220
 So people can come at me with a number of things

1:55:43.220 --> 1:55:45.540
 about papers and I might miss something.

1:55:45.540 --> 1:55:47.860
 Surely I miss certain things like anybody does.

1:55:47.860 --> 1:55:49.860
 But the methods I sort of,

1:55:49.860 --> 1:55:51.340
 I relish in reading the methods.

1:55:51.340 --> 1:55:52.660
 And that paper is really interesting

1:55:52.660 --> 1:55:55.660
 because they had people sit in lawn chairs, basically,

1:55:55.660 --> 1:55:58.500
 in swimming pools for an hour.

1:55:58.500 --> 1:56:00.260
 And it wasn't really, it was chilly.

1:56:00.260 --> 1:56:01.540
 It wasn't super cold.

1:56:01.540 --> 1:56:03.840
 I mean, 60 is not, it's not warm,

1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:06.060
 but it's not ice cold, obviously.

1:56:06.060 --> 1:56:09.060
 But an hour is ridiculous at some level.

1:56:09.060 --> 1:56:13.980
 But the increases in dopamine were massive and lasted hours.

1:56:13.980 --> 1:56:16.680
 So it's really, so the mood enhancing effects

1:56:16.680 --> 1:56:19.380
 that you report are, they're not,

1:56:19.380 --> 1:56:20.860
 you're not imagining that.

1:56:20.860 --> 1:56:23.660
 Those are almost certainly a,

1:56:23.660 --> 1:56:26.140
 the consequence of having slowly elevating,

1:56:26.140 --> 1:56:29.620
 but significantly elevated dopamine that goes on for hours.

1:56:29.620 --> 1:56:32.780
 That's almost a dream-like profile for dopamine

1:56:32.780 --> 1:56:34.620
 because most everything else, like an Adderall,

1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:38.500
 a Ritalin, a cup of coffee and a workout drink

1:56:38.500 --> 1:56:40.260
 or pre-workout drink or something is gonna give you

1:56:40.260 --> 1:56:43.700
 a big spike in adrenaline and dopamine and a big crash.

1:56:43.700 --> 1:56:47.940
 And somehow it creates this really nice contoured profile.

1:56:47.940 --> 1:56:49.880
 So I, whatever you're experiencing there

1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:52.460
 is very nicely supported by the data.

1:56:52.460 --> 1:56:54.780
 Well, I need to get, I need to get doing it more.

1:56:54.780 --> 1:56:57.580
 I've had a couple of scary experiences

1:56:57.580 --> 1:57:02.420
 going from hot to cold where blood pressure changes.

1:57:02.420 --> 1:57:05.100
 I think where I basically went straight

1:57:05.100 --> 1:57:06.940
 from a really hot jacuzzi.

1:57:06.940 --> 1:57:08.660
 I was in there for like 30 minutes.

1:57:08.660 --> 1:57:09.940
 I mean, I was, I was doing heat stress.

1:57:09.940 --> 1:57:10.780
 Jacuzzi, okay.

1:57:10.780 --> 1:57:12.560
 Yeah, 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:13.400
 That's toasty.

1:57:13.400 --> 1:57:14.820
 And then I had for 30 minutes.

1:57:14.820 --> 1:57:18.140
 And then I went straight into, at the time,

1:57:18.140 --> 1:57:18.980
 it was our pool.

1:57:18.980 --> 1:57:20.900
 It was in like February, it was like winter time.

1:57:20.900 --> 1:57:24.300
 And it was 50, it was in the 50s.

1:57:24.300 --> 1:57:25.920
 It was cold.

1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:28.900
 And I was in there and I was like listening

1:57:28.900 --> 1:57:29.740
 to Simon Garfunkel.

1:57:29.740 --> 1:57:31.700
 I was like trying to stay in a long time, get on my cold.

1:57:31.700 --> 1:57:32.540
 And I was trying to impress Dan

1:57:32.540 --> 1:57:34.220
 because he like goes in there for like,

1:57:34.220 --> 1:57:36.220
 he'll stay in there for like 15 minutes.

1:57:37.360 --> 1:57:40.620
 But I started to feel really like blinky,

1:57:40.620 --> 1:57:42.180
 like low blood pressure or something.

1:57:42.180 --> 1:57:43.940
 And I got scared, so I got out.

1:57:43.940 --> 1:57:47.220
 And then I couldn't stand like I had vertigo or something.

1:57:47.220 --> 1:57:50.460
 And I was so scared, I was so scared.

1:57:50.460 --> 1:57:52.860
 And so, and I've had a couple of times too

1:57:52.860 --> 1:57:55.380
 where just going straight from the sauna to it,

1:57:55.380 --> 1:57:57.940
 to the cold plunge, where I'm starting to feel,

1:57:57.940 --> 1:58:00.060
 I'm like, ooh, I feel a little blood pressure change

1:58:00.060 --> 1:58:00.880
 or something.

1:58:00.880 --> 1:58:01.720
 And it makes sense.

1:58:01.720 --> 1:58:04.620
 The sauna is causing vasodilation

1:58:04.620 --> 1:58:06.420
 and the cold plunge is,

1:58:06.420 --> 1:58:09.340
 or cold exposure is causing vasoconstriction.

1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:12.980
 So it's like a very, you know, just shock to my system.

1:58:12.980 --> 1:58:14.580
 And so now I wait.

1:58:14.580 --> 1:58:17.100
 Like I wait like a few minutes before going in.

1:58:17.100 --> 1:58:19.420
 But I do need to kind of like make it more,

1:58:19.420 --> 1:58:20.540
 the cold more routine.

1:58:20.540 --> 1:58:22.260
 Because I talk all about the science.

1:58:22.260 --> 1:58:23.600
 I'm familiar with all the science.

1:58:23.600 --> 1:58:26.920
 And you know, the norepinephrine or noradrenaline,

1:58:26.920 --> 1:58:29.500
 you know, it's affecting brain and mood.

1:58:29.500 --> 1:58:31.960
 And you know way more about that than I do.

1:58:31.960 --> 1:58:32.860
 I know how I feel.

1:58:32.860 --> 1:58:34.720
 And I know it's a neurotransmitter.

1:58:34.720 --> 1:58:37.140
 And you know, it is released,

1:58:37.140 --> 1:58:38.780
 at least in rats they've shown,

1:58:38.780 --> 1:58:39.620
 or was it mice?

1:58:39.620 --> 1:58:40.440
 I think it might've been rats,

1:58:40.440 --> 1:58:42.940
 but multiple studies showing in that it's released

1:58:42.940 --> 1:58:44.380
 from the cold in the brain.

1:58:44.380 --> 1:58:46.100
 And now in humans as well.

1:58:46.100 --> 1:58:49.420
 So in that study, we can put a link to this.

1:58:49.420 --> 1:58:52.800
 It's published in 2000, European Journal of Physiology.

1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:53.980
 That big dopamine increase.

1:58:53.980 --> 1:58:56.020
 They also looked at epinephrine and cortisol

1:58:56.020 --> 1:58:57.300
 and saw some really, yeah.

1:58:57.300 --> 1:58:58.140
 So this has been done in humans.

1:58:58.140 --> 1:58:58.980
 They did brain.

1:58:58.980 --> 1:58:59.800
 Oh, I didn't know.

1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:00.640
 Oh, no, no, not yet.

1:59:00.640 --> 1:59:01.480
 The plasma.

1:59:01.480 --> 1:59:02.300
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:59:02.300 --> 1:59:03.940
 Very hard to measure dopamine directly from the brain

1:59:03.940 --> 1:59:05.140
 unless you're doing micro dialysis.

1:59:05.140 --> 1:59:08.540
 Unfortunately, their skulls were intact.

1:59:08.540 --> 1:59:09.660
 Fortunately for them,

1:59:09.660 --> 1:59:11.100
 unfortunately for the research committee,

1:59:11.100 --> 1:59:12.140
 their skulls were intact.

1:59:12.140 --> 1:59:14.020
 So they couldn't measure directly in the brain.

1:59:14.020 --> 1:59:17.760
 But obviously there's a correlate there.

1:59:18.860 --> 1:59:20.740
 You know, it's a very real effect.

1:59:20.740 --> 1:59:22.520
 I think that,

1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:25.420
 but the advantage of not doing it too often

1:59:25.420 --> 1:59:27.340
 is that you're not cold adapted.

1:59:27.340 --> 1:59:30.520
 Now it's very hard for anyone to get truly cold adapted.

1:59:30.520 --> 1:59:32.540
 Some people start to look forward to the cold.

1:59:32.540 --> 1:59:33.900
 And what I think they're looking forward to

1:59:33.900 --> 1:59:37.660
 is the feeling afterward, that dopamine rush.

1:59:37.660 --> 1:59:39.700
 But if you get cold adapted,

1:59:39.700 --> 1:59:42.940
 then it certainly blunts some of the effect.

1:59:42.940 --> 1:59:44.420
 But I want to be cold adapted

1:59:44.420 --> 1:59:46.980
 because that means I have more mitochondria

1:59:46.980 --> 1:59:50.500
 in my adipose tissue and perhaps even muscle.

1:59:50.500 --> 1:59:52.020
 Like that's been shown.

1:59:52.020 --> 1:59:54.260
 So maybe there's a good opportunity to,

1:59:54.260 --> 1:59:57.460
 so cold and UCP1, if you could educate us on UCP1,

1:59:57.460 --> 1:59:58.380
 I find this really interesting.

1:59:58.380 --> 1:59:59.860
 And I learned about it from you.

1:59:59.860 --> 2:00:02.260
 Yeah, well, so norepinephrine

2:00:02.260 --> 2:00:03.580
 actually released in the plasma.

2:00:03.580 --> 2:00:05.500
 It does act as a hormone.

2:00:05.500 --> 2:00:07.020
 Vasoconstriction is one thing it does,

2:00:07.020 --> 2:00:11.020
 but it also regulates a variety of molecular functions

2:00:11.020 --> 2:00:13.500
 that have to do with adaption to cold.

2:00:13.500 --> 2:00:15.420
 One happening to be,

2:00:16.580 --> 2:00:19.780
 shivering is a very inefficient way to produce heat,

2:00:19.780 --> 2:00:20.860
 which is what your body's trying to do

2:00:20.860 --> 2:00:22.240
 when it's exposed to cold.

2:00:22.240 --> 2:00:24.380
 And your muscles are basically contracting

2:00:24.380 --> 2:00:26.980
 and producing heat from that,

2:00:26.980 --> 2:00:28.440
 but that's just not very efficient.

2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:31.260
 So the more eloquent way to do it,

2:00:31.260 --> 2:00:33.180
 or elegant, I guess, way to do it

2:00:33.180 --> 2:00:37.180
 is to basically have your mitochondria produce

2:00:37.180 --> 2:00:38.700
 tons and tons of heat.

2:00:38.700 --> 2:00:41.880
 So the way it does this is by activating a gene

2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:44.620
 called UCP1, uncoupling protein one.

2:00:44.620 --> 2:00:46.760
 Norepinephrine is upstream of that, activating it.

2:00:46.760 --> 2:00:49.780
 So what that does is essentially,

2:00:49.780 --> 2:00:51.900
 so mitochondria are these little organelles

2:00:51.900 --> 2:00:54.340
 inside of your cells that are responsible

2:00:54.340 --> 2:00:55.380
 for producing energy.

2:00:55.380 --> 2:01:00.060
 Usually that's in the form of adenosine triphosphate, ATP,

2:01:00.060 --> 2:01:02.220
 and that's what lets everything function

2:01:02.220 --> 2:01:04.580
 inside of your body, from your neurotransmitter production

2:01:04.580 --> 2:01:07.100
 to your heart beating, et cetera.

2:01:07.100 --> 2:01:10.540
 However, you can uncouple your mitochondria.

2:01:10.540 --> 2:01:12.740
 Basically, your mitochondria,

2:01:12.740 --> 2:01:13.860
 they're like a little battery.

2:01:13.860 --> 2:01:16.480
 So they have, well, they have a double membrane,

2:01:16.480 --> 2:01:17.420
 first of all, their structure,

2:01:17.420 --> 2:01:19.740
 but they have a negative charge on the inside,

2:01:19.740 --> 2:01:22.580
 and they have a positive charge on the inner membrane,

2:01:22.580 --> 2:01:26.820
 so in between the outer membrane and the inside part.

2:01:26.820 --> 2:01:27.920
 Like a neuron.

2:01:27.920 --> 2:01:28.760
 Like a neuron, yeah.

2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:30.040
 So I guess it's like a neuron.

2:01:30.040 --> 2:01:31.860
 It's like a battery, negative and positive.

2:01:31.860 --> 2:01:34.140
 Well, basically, you can uncouple that charge,

2:01:34.140 --> 2:01:35.260
 and so that positive charge,

2:01:35.260 --> 2:01:37.420
 protons start leaking out of the mitochondria,

2:01:37.420 --> 2:01:39.060
 and your mitochondria freak out.

2:01:39.060 --> 2:01:41.400
 So this is called uncoupling it,

2:01:41.400 --> 2:01:45.300
 and they start to, it's maximum respiration, as we call it.

2:01:45.300 --> 2:01:47.420
 They try to make as much energy.

2:01:47.420 --> 2:01:49.900
 They're like, I gotta get that proton back,

2:01:49.900 --> 2:01:52.100
 that gradient, the electrochemical gradient,

2:01:52.100 --> 2:01:54.520
 and so they just go insane,

2:01:54.520 --> 2:01:56.740
 and in this case, it's uncoupled energy,

2:01:56.740 --> 2:02:00.280
 so the energy they're making is actually heat, not ATP,

2:02:00.280 --> 2:02:03.420
 but heat is, but you're essentially burning substrate,

2:02:03.420 --> 2:02:04.260
 so who cares?

2:02:04.260 --> 2:02:07.420
 You're burning glucose, you're burning lipids,

2:02:07.420 --> 2:02:10.460
 you're basically burning things and making heat,

2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:12.740
 and so that's what uncoupling it does,

2:02:12.740 --> 2:02:14.620
 and that is a much more efficient way

2:02:14.620 --> 2:02:16.460
 of producing heat than shivering,

2:02:16.460 --> 2:02:19.140
 so as you become more adapted,

2:02:19.140 --> 2:02:22.420
 maybe the longer duration that you've stayed in the cold

2:02:22.420 --> 2:02:23.640
 or the more times you've done it,

2:02:23.640 --> 2:02:25.500
 you'll no longer shiver anymore.

2:02:25.500 --> 2:02:28.060
 You will start to then just do this uncoupling type

2:02:28.060 --> 2:02:30.180
 of thermogenesis, as it's called,

2:02:30.180 --> 2:02:33.340
 and another type of adaptation that occurs

2:02:33.340 --> 2:02:35.780
 is you actually produce more mitochondria

2:02:35.780 --> 2:02:37.500
 in your adipose tissue,

2:02:37.500 --> 2:02:40.580
 and that actually happens also regulated

2:02:40.580 --> 2:02:42.620
 by norepinephrine or noradrenaline

2:02:42.620 --> 2:02:46.580
 through a protein called PGC1 alpha,

2:02:46.580 --> 2:02:51.580
 and what that protein does is it makes more mitochondria

2:02:51.660 --> 2:02:54.460
 in your adipose cells, so per adipose cell,

2:02:54.460 --> 2:02:55.820
 you're getting more mitochondria.

2:02:55.820 --> 2:02:59.300
 It's a beautiful way to basically make more heat

2:02:59.300 --> 2:03:02.060
 when you're, it's one of those things where it's like,

2:03:02.060 --> 2:03:03.420
 your body's going, okay,

2:03:03.420 --> 2:03:05.420
 I'm gonna be exposed to this cold next time.

2:03:05.420 --> 2:03:07.620
 How can I make sure I don't die?

2:03:07.620 --> 2:03:09.300
 Oh, I can have more mitochondria,

2:03:09.300 --> 2:03:10.380
 and I'm gonna make more heat,

2:03:10.380 --> 2:03:12.380
 and so you're making more mitochondria

2:03:12.380 --> 2:03:13.440
 in your adipose tissue,

2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.100
 and this is often referred to as like the browning of fat,

2:03:17.100 --> 2:03:18.460
 and the reason for that is because

2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:21.620
 if you look under a microscope at a lipid droplet,

2:03:21.620 --> 2:03:26.620
 basically a fat cell, not a lipid droplet, adipocyte,

2:03:26.620 --> 2:03:29.500
 you'll find that it looks darker

2:03:29.500 --> 2:03:31.300
 because there's more mitochondria in there,

2:03:31.300 --> 2:03:33.820
 so it's referred to as browning fat,

2:03:33.820 --> 2:03:36.940
 and so I don't want to get into the whole beige fat,

2:03:36.940 --> 2:03:38.740
 brown, you know, there's this whole,

2:03:38.740 --> 2:03:40.860
 I'm sure you've had experts on that talk all about that,

2:03:40.860 --> 2:03:41.700
 but-

2:03:41.700 --> 2:03:42.520
 No, not yet.

2:03:42.520 --> 2:03:43.700
 I mean, I always think of white fat, beige fat, brown fat,

2:03:43.700 --> 2:03:45.200
 and beige is kind of intermediate.

2:03:45.200 --> 2:03:46.860
 White can be converted into beige, but-

2:03:46.860 --> 2:03:48.020
 Right, and beige can take on

2:03:48.020 --> 2:03:50.140
 thermogenic characteristics, essentially,

2:03:50.140 --> 2:03:54.340
 and so you can activate beige fat so that it's thermogenic

2:03:54.340 --> 2:03:57.220
 in the sense that it's burning glucose

2:03:57.220 --> 2:04:01.000
 and or, you know, fatty acids and producing heat.

2:04:01.000 --> 2:04:05.500
 So the more you expose yourself to cold,

2:04:05.500 --> 2:04:08.400
 the more you can brown your fat, so to speak,

2:04:08.400 --> 2:04:12.320
 and therefore you can tolerate the cold for longer periods,

2:04:12.320 --> 2:04:13.920
 which people do notice,

2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:17.480
 and you can then have the thermogenic qualities

2:04:17.480 --> 2:04:20.180
 of having more brown adipose tissue or beige,

2:04:20.180 --> 2:04:22.020
 activated beige adipose tissue,

2:04:22.020 --> 2:04:24.660
 which is, you know, you'll get a lot of naysayers

2:04:24.660 --> 2:04:26.380
 out there saying, oh, brown fat

2:04:26.380 --> 2:04:28.820
 doesn't regulate metabolism at all.

2:04:28.820 --> 2:04:31.180
 The reality is there's like thousands of researchers

2:04:31.180 --> 2:04:35.100
 trying to pill up brown fat and thermogenic,

2:04:35.100 --> 2:04:36.660
 like they're trying to make it a pill

2:04:36.660 --> 2:04:38.940
 because it does affect metabolism.

2:04:38.940 --> 2:04:40.220
 You know, it's not the only thing.

2:04:40.220 --> 2:04:42.940
 It's certainly, if you're obese and trying to lose weight,

2:04:42.940 --> 2:04:45.780
 you're not gonna like do that just by doing cold exposure.

2:04:45.780 --> 2:04:48.820
 You need to do dietary and exercise changes,

2:04:48.820 --> 2:04:52.500
 you know, predominantly, but it does affect metabolism,

2:04:52.500 --> 2:04:56.640
 and, you know, this has been shown in human studies,

2:04:56.640 --> 2:04:59.420
 so it is an interesting,

2:05:00.700 --> 2:05:04.220
 it's another possible mechanism for affecting metabolism,

2:05:04.220 --> 2:05:05.940
 and that's in adipose tissue,

2:05:05.940 --> 2:05:09.580
 but you also make more mitochondria and muscle tissue,

2:05:09.580 --> 2:05:12.340
 and this is regulated not via norepinephrine,

2:05:12.340 --> 2:05:14.580
 but it is still PGC1 alpha, interestingly.

2:05:15.740 --> 2:05:17.420
 Not like, not that anyone else really cares,

2:05:17.420 --> 2:05:19.780
 but maybe you do, Andrew.

2:05:19.780 --> 2:05:21.460
 I'm eating this up.

2:05:21.460 --> 2:05:25.980
 So PGC1 alpha is response to norepinephrine

2:05:25.980 --> 2:05:28.120
 and adipose tissue to make more mitochondria,

2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:32.280
 but in muscle tissue, it's unclear what the regulator is.

2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:35.460
 Cold exposure does it, so this was shown

2:05:35.460 --> 2:05:37.660
 at least in a couple of studies I've seen

2:05:37.660 --> 2:05:40.500
 where people that were exercising, I believe,

2:05:40.500 --> 2:05:43.080
 or maybe it may have been men only that were exercising,

2:05:43.080 --> 2:05:46.300
 did some sort of training, and then did cold water immersion,

2:05:46.300 --> 2:05:49.420
 something like 50 degrees Fahrenheit, 15 minutes,

2:05:49.420 --> 2:05:51.540
 and PGC1 alpha, which is a biomarker

2:05:51.540 --> 2:05:52.980
 for mitochondrial biogenesis,

2:05:52.980 --> 2:05:55.300
 which is the generation of new mitochondria.

2:05:55.300 --> 2:05:56.700
 By the way, that's awesome.

2:05:56.700 --> 2:05:58.200
 You want more mitochondria in your muscle.

2:05:58.200 --> 2:06:01.100
 It's associated with improved muscle mass,

2:06:01.100 --> 2:06:02.140
 improved endurance.

2:06:02.140 --> 2:06:04.540
 I mean, mitochondria are essentially

2:06:04.540 --> 2:06:05.900
 either the making energy in your cell,

2:06:05.900 --> 2:06:09.260
 and we, you know, we don't make more mitochondria normally.

2:06:09.260 --> 2:06:10.740
 Like, you have certain inputs,

2:06:10.740 --> 2:06:12.740
 high-intensity interval training exercise can do it.

2:06:12.740 --> 2:06:14.920
 You can actually make more mitochondria.

2:06:14.920 --> 2:06:17.580
 Yes, yeah, and that's been shown in people.

2:06:17.580 --> 2:06:20.540
 Weight training or just high-intensity interval training?

2:06:20.540 --> 2:06:23.340
 I haven't seen weight training.

2:06:23.340 --> 2:06:25.540
 I've seen it in high-intensity interval training,

2:06:25.540 --> 2:06:28.180
 endurance training, but that doesn't mean

2:06:28.180 --> 2:06:29.460
 that it hasn't been shown.

2:06:29.460 --> 2:06:31.280
 I just haven't seen it, or that it hasn't been looked at.

2:06:31.280 --> 2:06:32.120
 It's good to know.

2:06:32.120 --> 2:06:34.300
 I'm always looking for reasons to finally do

2:06:34.300 --> 2:06:37.680
 more HIIT-type high-intensity interval training work.

2:06:37.680 --> 2:06:40.460
 I do weight training, and I do low-intensity cardio.

2:06:40.460 --> 2:06:43.420
 There was a brilliant study by,

2:06:43.420 --> 2:06:45.900
 at the time he was a postdoc, Matthew Robinson,

2:06:45.900 --> 2:06:49.900
 and he's now gone on to start his own lab

2:06:49.900 --> 2:06:53.460
 at the University of Oregon Health Science Center.

2:06:53.460 --> 2:06:54.940
 Great place, yeah.

2:06:54.940 --> 2:06:59.940
 And he did this study where both young and older people,

2:07:00.860 --> 2:07:02.480
 they had this whole high-intensity protocol,

2:07:02.480 --> 2:07:03.780
 which I can't remember what it was,

2:07:03.780 --> 2:07:07.120
 but their protocol for X amount of time,

2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:08.980
 I'm sure it was at least a month,

2:07:09.860 --> 2:07:13.400
 they then measured biomarkers of mitochondrial biogenesis

2:07:13.400 --> 2:07:14.240
 in their muscle tissue.

2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:17.540
 And the amount of mitochondrial biogenesis

2:07:17.540 --> 2:07:19.100
 in old people specifically,

2:07:19.100 --> 2:07:20.860
 it happened in both young and old from HIIT,

2:07:20.860 --> 2:07:22.560
 from the high-intensity interval training,

2:07:22.560 --> 2:07:26.940
 was, I mean, it was like enormous, at least 50%, I think.

2:07:26.940 --> 2:07:29.060
 So I mean, it was just like, whoa.

2:07:29.060 --> 2:07:30.620
 And so like, why would you want that?

2:07:30.620 --> 2:07:34.660
 Well, you know, mitochondria, you don't make,

2:07:34.660 --> 2:07:36.620
 your cells are turning over, you make new cells,

2:07:36.620 --> 2:07:39.020
 you replace old ones with your mitochondria.

2:07:39.020 --> 2:07:41.180
 You don't really do that for the most part.

2:07:41.180 --> 2:07:43.160
 You can, mitochondrial biogenesis does happen,

2:07:43.160 --> 2:07:45.180
 but you have to stimulate it to happen.

2:07:45.180 --> 2:07:46.820
 And the way your mitochondria,

2:07:46.820 --> 2:07:48.220
 like what happens with your mitochondria

2:07:48.220 --> 2:07:50.760
 is they essentially are bobbing around inside of your cells,

2:07:50.760 --> 2:07:53.740
 and then they fuse with other mitochondria,

2:07:53.740 --> 2:07:55.700
 exchange all their content and mitochondrial DNA,

2:07:55.700 --> 2:07:56.580
 and then fizz back apart.

2:07:56.580 --> 2:07:58.820
 And that's how they kind of stay young-ish.

2:07:58.820 --> 2:07:59.820
 But like, as you age,

2:07:59.820 --> 2:08:02.660
 you keep doing that with the same pool of mitochondria,

2:08:02.660 --> 2:08:04.260
 then you're gonna get a bunch of old mitochondria

2:08:04.260 --> 2:08:06.200
 mixing old stuff together, right?

2:08:06.200 --> 2:08:10.340
 So why wouldn't you wanna like bring up new, healthy,

2:08:10.340 --> 2:08:13.420
 young mitochondria into that pool, right?

2:08:13.420 --> 2:08:16.140
 So in my mind, when I hear mitochondrial biogenesis,

2:08:16.140 --> 2:08:19.100
 I'm like aging, like, that's the first thing I think of.

2:08:19.100 --> 2:08:20.860
 So anyways, cold exposure does that,

2:08:22.060 --> 2:08:23.900
 other things as well, so.

2:08:23.900 --> 2:08:27.180
 And please, thank you for offering to, you know,

2:08:27.180 --> 2:08:29.240
 somehow filter the level of detail,

2:08:29.240 --> 2:08:31.820
 but I assure you that listeners of this podcast

2:08:31.820 --> 2:08:34.040
 are familiar with getting,

2:08:34.040 --> 2:08:36.100
 drinking from the fire hose of mechanism,

2:08:36.100 --> 2:08:37.700
 and that was really helpful.

2:08:37.700 --> 2:08:40.780
 And again, this is just one example of maybe four

2:08:40.780 --> 2:08:43.580
 or five other things that you've said, at least,

2:08:43.580 --> 2:08:46.300
 that are gonna inspire me to change my behaviors.

2:08:46.300 --> 2:08:48.100
 I'm gonna start doing some high intensity interval training.

2:08:48.100 --> 2:08:50.820
 Dr. Andy Galpin was on this podcast recently,

2:08:50.820 --> 2:08:53.540
 and he told me that the subtle zone two cardio

2:08:53.540 --> 2:08:54.780
 and the weight training is great,

2:08:54.780 --> 2:08:55.940
 but that I really should be doing

2:08:55.940 --> 2:08:58.740
 some max heart rate work per week,

2:08:58.740 --> 2:09:00.780
 you know, going into max heart rate for 90 seconds

2:09:00.780 --> 2:09:03.660
 and resting and repeating that, maybe even mild repeats.

2:09:03.660 --> 2:09:05.180
 I'm just curious as a brief aside

2:09:05.180 --> 2:09:10.180
 before we talk about heat, what sort of cardiovascular

2:09:11.020 --> 2:09:13.020
 or other types of training do you do?

2:09:13.020 --> 2:09:13.860
 Do you do HIIT?

2:09:13.860 --> 2:09:16.020
 I imagine you are doing high intensity interval training.

2:09:16.020 --> 2:09:18.120
 If you could just give us a sense of the contour

2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:20.460
 of your week as it relates to exercise,

2:09:20.460 --> 2:09:22.620
 and because you've been very gracious

2:09:22.620 --> 2:09:24.980
 in sharing some of what you do for supplements and food,

2:09:24.980 --> 2:09:26.980
 what about exercise?

2:09:26.980 --> 2:09:29.420
 So I, it all depends on my week, of course,

2:09:29.420 --> 2:09:31.900
 and what I've got going on with my son

2:09:31.900 --> 2:09:33.900
 and my work schedule, but I typically,

2:09:33.900 --> 2:09:37.500
 I do a lot of high intensity interval Tabatas

2:09:37.500 --> 2:09:38.700
 on a stationary cycle.

2:09:38.700 --> 2:09:43.280
 I use Peloton because I just like that instructor there,

2:09:43.280 --> 2:09:44.120
 like telling me what to do

2:09:44.120 --> 2:09:45.540
 and then me competing with everyone else.

2:09:45.540 --> 2:09:46.620
 I'm like, nah, you know?

2:09:46.620 --> 2:09:47.460
 So it works for me.

2:09:47.460 --> 2:09:48.940
 You're revealing something about your psychology.

2:09:48.940 --> 2:09:49.760
 This is good.

2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:50.600
 We just learned about,

2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:52.700
 so this podcast is actually just a decoy

2:09:52.700 --> 2:09:55.140
 for a psychological assessment of the guests.

2:09:55.140 --> 2:09:57.580
 No, I'm kidding, but so now we know you're competitive.

2:09:57.580 --> 2:09:58.420
 Good?

2:09:58.420 --> 2:10:01.780
 That explains a lot of how you got through graduate school

2:10:01.780 --> 2:10:03.340
 and then do what you do.

2:10:03.340 --> 2:10:04.700
 So you're getting on the Peloton

2:10:04.700 --> 2:10:05.540
 and what does it look like

2:10:05.540 --> 2:10:07.260
 for someone who's not familiar with Peloton?

2:10:07.260 --> 2:10:10.260
 I know what they are, but I've never been on one.

2:10:10.260 --> 2:10:12.520
 You are peddling against the instructor

2:10:12.520 --> 2:10:13.620
 for how many seconds?

2:10:13.620 --> 2:10:16.300
 So you're, there's a bunch of people that are online

2:10:16.300 --> 2:10:18.460
 either doing the class with you at the same time

2:10:18.460 --> 2:10:20.220
 or have all time doing it

2:10:20.220 --> 2:10:22.900
 so you can kind of toggle on what you want

2:10:22.900 --> 2:10:24.360
 and like, you can try to compete

2:10:24.360 --> 2:10:25.200
 against the all time number.

2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:26.020
 Oh, so it's really competitive.

2:10:26.020 --> 2:10:26.860
 Oh yeah.

2:10:26.860 --> 2:10:27.680
 Okay.

2:10:27.680 --> 2:10:29.360
 And the instructor is just there to like whip you,

2:10:29.360 --> 2:10:31.860
 like, you know, make you,

2:10:31.860 --> 2:10:36.300
 there's a part of, the brilliance with Peloton is,

2:10:36.300 --> 2:10:39.140
 like I used to do rush, what's called rush cycle

2:10:39.140 --> 2:10:40.660
 and I used to go in, it's basically you go in

2:10:40.660 --> 2:10:42.940
 and group cycle and have an instructor there

2:10:42.940 --> 2:10:44.980
 and you do all this high intensity interval training stuff.

2:10:44.980 --> 2:10:48.940
 And I loved it because there was a competitive aspect to it

2:10:48.940 --> 2:10:52.180
 that had me working harder than I would work

2:10:52.180 --> 2:10:53.380
 if it was just me in the room,

2:10:53.380 --> 2:10:56.200
 like without an instructor or anyone there

2:10:56.200 --> 2:10:59.320
 and it was just like, I'm at a gym, any gym

2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:00.700
 and I'm just on a stationary cycle

2:11:00.700 --> 2:11:02.020
 listening to a podcast doing something,

2:11:02.020 --> 2:11:03.860
 which is fine if that's your group, right?

2:11:03.860 --> 2:11:07.580
 But there is something about that group setting

2:11:07.580 --> 2:11:10.780
 that kind of holds you accountable too, right?

2:11:10.780 --> 2:11:14.700
 And the Peloton made it somehow virtual, it was amazing.

2:11:14.700 --> 2:11:16.420
 And I remember being back at rush cycle,

2:11:16.420 --> 2:11:17.640
 this is before a pandemic

2:11:17.640 --> 2:11:19.580
 and people talking about Peloton in my class

2:11:19.580 --> 2:11:21.220
 and I'm like, oh, it's ridiculous, why would I do that?

2:11:21.220 --> 2:11:23.900
 Like, that's never gonna work, I need to like be here.

2:11:23.900 --> 2:11:24.940
 And then the pandemic hit

2:11:24.940 --> 2:11:27.160
 and I was like all over the Peloton

2:11:27.160 --> 2:11:29.380
 and it works for me really well.

2:11:29.380 --> 2:11:33.420
 So I tend to do that at least three times a week.

2:11:33.420 --> 2:11:35.980
 Sometimes I do it more, like I'll do four

2:11:35.980 --> 2:11:39.860
 and I do a 10 minute, just 10 because it's efficient

2:11:39.860 --> 2:11:42.660
 and I push my ass, I push myself really hard.

2:11:42.660 --> 2:11:43.500
 That's the Tabata.

2:11:43.500 --> 2:11:46.820
 It's 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off and it's 10 minutes.

2:11:46.820 --> 2:11:48.060
 And on means you're pedaling

2:11:48.060 --> 2:11:48.900
 like your life depended on it.

2:11:48.900 --> 2:11:50.060
 You're maxing it.

2:11:50.060 --> 2:11:52.220
 And there's a lot of resistance in the pedals?

2:11:52.220 --> 2:11:53.940
 Well, so you basically, there's a part where you're,

2:11:53.940 --> 2:11:55.900
 I always do resistance, I'm like the power,

2:11:55.900 --> 2:11:57.020
 I do the power for,

2:11:57.020 --> 2:11:59.020
 there's a part where you're sitting cycling

2:11:59.020 --> 2:12:00.100
 and you're trying to go really fast

2:12:00.100 --> 2:12:01.620
 but I always crank the resistance up.

2:12:01.620 --> 2:12:03.420
 I always go above what they give me.

2:12:03.420 --> 2:12:05.980
 And then there's a part where you're standing

2:12:05.980 --> 2:12:07.580
 and then you really crank the resistance up

2:12:07.580 --> 2:12:09.540
 which I really do and like you feel it in your glutes.

2:12:09.540 --> 2:12:10.380
 It's like going up a hill.

2:12:10.380 --> 2:12:11.220
 Yeah, exactly.

2:12:11.220 --> 2:12:12.220
 And so they like break it up

2:12:12.220 --> 2:12:15.180
 and most of the time you'll have like those two parts.

2:12:15.180 --> 2:12:17.420
 And I love the efficiency of it.

2:12:17.420 --> 2:12:18.980
 You just, you get it done

2:12:18.980 --> 2:12:21.100
 and people sometimes hear me go 10 minutes

2:12:21.100 --> 2:12:22.700
 or really you think you work and I'm like,

2:12:22.700 --> 2:12:26.180
 look, like you max, you do max, you do Tabata for 10 minutes

2:12:26.180 --> 2:12:28.180
 and it's like, it's intense.

2:12:28.180 --> 2:12:29.420
 Yeah, most people can't sprint

2:12:29.420 --> 2:12:33.180
 for the gate of an airplane they're about to miss

2:12:33.180 --> 2:12:35.020
 carrying a backpack.

2:12:35.020 --> 2:12:37.100
 So if you think about, if I think about that

2:12:37.100 --> 2:12:39.100
 and then I've just described myself

2:12:39.100 --> 2:12:40.700
 sprinting through the airport and going,

2:12:40.700 --> 2:12:41.620
 all right, Andy Galpin,

2:12:41.620 --> 2:12:43.940
 I got my 90 seconds max heart rate in for you

2:12:43.940 --> 2:12:45.540
 carrying this thing.

2:12:45.540 --> 2:12:48.180
 But 20 seconds on, 10 seconds off,

2:12:48.180 --> 2:12:50.180
 repeating that over and over for 10 minutes.

2:12:50.180 --> 2:12:51.980
 So by the time you're done, you're cooked.

2:12:51.980 --> 2:12:54.860
 And then I, because I'm competitive during the recovery

2:12:54.860 --> 2:12:56.180
 that they give you at the minute at the end,

2:12:56.180 --> 2:12:58.820
 I'm pushing it max because I want to keep the numbers higher.

2:12:58.820 --> 2:13:00.780
 Great, so three times a week?

2:13:00.780 --> 2:13:01.700
 Yeah, three times a week.

2:13:01.700 --> 2:13:04.940
 And then I always have my sauna on preheating up.

2:13:04.940 --> 2:13:06.020
 It takes about an hour and a half

2:13:06.020 --> 2:13:09.100
 and I get it to about 189 degrees Fahrenheit.

2:13:09.100 --> 2:13:12.620
 I hop right in the sauna after my Peloton.

2:13:12.620 --> 2:13:14.140
 So the elevated heart rate continues.

2:13:14.140 --> 2:13:14.980
 Is that the rationale?

2:13:14.980 --> 2:13:17.780
 Yeah, I mean, I literally like down a bunch of water

2:13:17.780 --> 2:13:20.300
 and then I get in and then I like either

2:13:21.460 --> 2:13:24.420
 read a science paper, prepare for a presentation

2:13:24.420 --> 2:13:28.700
 or a podcast, or I hash over things in my mind.

2:13:28.700 --> 2:13:32.660
 And it's interesting because something about

2:13:32.660 --> 2:13:35.940
 getting in the sauna, I think the stress,

2:13:35.940 --> 2:13:37.980
 the heat stress of it, I used to,

2:13:37.980 --> 2:13:41.260
 so I started doing the sauna in 2009 in graduate school.

2:13:41.260 --> 2:13:42.380
 You're an early adopter.

2:13:42.380 --> 2:13:44.220
 I started doing it every day.

2:13:44.220 --> 2:13:45.060
 I lived across the street.

2:13:45.060 --> 2:13:47.380
 I lived in a studio apartment with Dan.

2:13:47.380 --> 2:13:48.940
 We lived in the small studio apartment,

2:13:48.940 --> 2:13:50.500
 smallest apartment you could ever imagine.

2:13:50.500 --> 2:13:52.700
 And it was across the street from a YMCA

2:13:52.700 --> 2:13:55.140
 because I was poor in graduate school, very poor, very poor.

2:13:55.140 --> 2:13:56.900
 I mean, so, you know.

2:13:56.900 --> 2:14:01.020
 I recall, I recall being, I lived in my lab.

2:14:01.020 --> 2:14:01.860
 Wow, really?

2:14:01.860 --> 2:14:03.900
 But then again, I lived in my lab as a postdoc

2:14:03.900 --> 2:14:06.740
 and as a, I admit, I lived in my lab with my bulldog

2:14:06.740 --> 2:14:11.300
 as a faculty member for other reasons, but I get it.

2:14:11.300 --> 2:14:12.980
 When you're a graduate student, you're poor.

2:14:12.980 --> 2:14:16.980
 Yes, and so I used to go to the sauna

2:14:16.980 --> 2:14:21.980
 before going into the lab, and I started noticing

2:14:23.100 --> 2:14:26.380
 that I was all of a sudden able to handle stress better,

2:14:26.380 --> 2:14:30.300
 like the stress of my six-month setback

2:14:30.300 --> 2:14:33.460
 because of a failed experiment, which is crushing

2:14:33.460 --> 2:14:37.460
 on top of the pressure from my advisor

2:14:37.460 --> 2:14:40.140
 and my own pressure, because I'm very competitive

2:14:40.140 --> 2:14:41.540
 with myself, and I put a lot of pressure on myself.

2:14:41.540 --> 2:14:43.860
 So I was having a hard time.

2:14:43.860 --> 2:14:45.500
 I mean, I was very stressed out in graduate school,

2:14:45.500 --> 2:14:49.140
 and the sauna started to really noticeably affect

2:14:49.140 --> 2:14:52.460
 my anxiety and my ability to handle stress,

2:14:52.460 --> 2:14:55.020
 and I was like, what is going on here?

2:14:55.020 --> 2:14:57.060
 So I started looking into the literature,

2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:01.140
 and started getting interested in the effects on the brain,

2:15:01.140 --> 2:15:03.420
 and in fact, at the time, I had a friend

2:15:03.420 --> 2:15:05.740
 who was not actually experimentally,

2:15:05.740 --> 2:15:10.740
 but theoretically looking into the opioid system,

2:15:10.980 --> 2:15:13.660
 and basically, so when you get in the sauna,

2:15:13.660 --> 2:15:16.020
 you release a lot of endorphins.

2:15:16.020 --> 2:15:19.540
 Endorphins are the feel-good opioids

2:15:19.540 --> 2:15:22.580
 that make you feel good, but you also release

2:15:22.580 --> 2:15:25.140
 something called dynorphin, and dynorphin

2:15:25.140 --> 2:15:28.780
 is an endogenous opioid that binds to a receptor

2:15:28.780 --> 2:15:30.900
 called the kappa opioid receptor,

2:15:30.900 --> 2:15:34.780
 which dynorphin is responsible for that dysphoric feeling

2:15:34.780 --> 2:15:36.300
 when you're in the sauna and you're hot

2:15:36.300 --> 2:15:38.020
 and when you're running, doing exercise,

2:15:38.020 --> 2:15:40.580
 and you're like, you feel uncomfortable.

2:15:40.580 --> 2:15:43.300
 Well, I think that's dynorphin, I'm speaking in absolute,

2:15:43.300 --> 2:15:44.140
 I think it is.

2:15:44.140 --> 2:15:44.980
 I think it is.

2:15:44.980 --> 2:15:47.460
 I mean, there's evidence in alcoholics

2:15:47.460 --> 2:15:49.340
 that some of the symptoms of withdrawal

2:15:49.340 --> 2:15:51.700
 that they experience are related to dynorphin,

2:15:51.700 --> 2:15:55.460
 and dynorphin is known to negatively impact

2:15:55.460 --> 2:15:57.660
 the dopamine receptor system.

2:15:57.660 --> 2:16:00.300
 So basically, it's the feel-like-garbage pathway.

2:16:00.300 --> 2:16:01.220
 Right, you feel like garbage,

2:16:01.220 --> 2:16:04.900
 and so you think that that would not be good,

2:16:04.900 --> 2:16:07.260
 but this is where my friend that comes in,

2:16:07.260 --> 2:16:10.060
 he was looking at the effects of treating

2:16:10.060 --> 2:16:12.660
 morphine or heroin addiction,

2:16:12.660 --> 2:16:15.220
 and people that are using those drugs,

2:16:15.220 --> 2:16:20.220
 they basically, the endorphins or the morphine or heroin,

2:16:21.740 --> 2:16:23.340
 they bind to a receptor in the brain

2:16:23.340 --> 2:16:25.140
 called the mu opioid receptor,

2:16:25.140 --> 2:16:27.740
 and as they take these drugs,

2:16:27.740 --> 2:16:30.740
 that mu opioid receptor becomes down-regulated,

2:16:30.740 --> 2:16:33.540
 and so you need more and more of the drug

2:16:33.540 --> 2:16:34.940
 to feel as good as you did, right?

2:16:34.940 --> 2:16:37.460
 Well, endorphins also bind to that receptor,

2:16:37.460 --> 2:16:41.060
 and he was looking into some of the other drugs

2:16:41.060 --> 2:16:46.060
 that are like salvinoram or something, salvia, it's called.

2:16:46.100 --> 2:16:48.340
 It binds to the opioid receptor.

2:16:48.340 --> 2:16:49.860
 It also makes you kind of feel uncomfortable.

2:16:49.860 --> 2:16:53.580
 Anyways, he had put some studies in front of me

2:16:53.580 --> 2:16:58.580
 that showed basically binding of either dynorphin

2:16:58.660 --> 2:17:02.060
 or whatever ligand to the kappa opioid receptor

2:17:02.060 --> 2:17:05.100
 basically sensitizes the mu opioid receptor

2:17:05.100 --> 2:17:06.740
 to the feel-good endorphins,

2:17:06.740 --> 2:17:11.300
 and also changes, I think it also up-regulates it

2:17:11.300 --> 2:17:12.420
 or something, so basically,

2:17:12.420 --> 2:17:14.060
 there's a lasting effect of feeling good.

2:17:14.060 --> 2:17:15.700
 So the endorphins that you release later

2:17:15.700 --> 2:17:18.700
 from hugging someone or a joke you're laughing at

2:17:18.700 --> 2:17:21.980
 or whatever, you feel it for longer, right?

2:17:21.980 --> 2:17:25.220
 And so, anyways, this is a, with the sauna,

2:17:25.220 --> 2:17:26.060
 with respect to the sauna,

2:17:26.060 --> 2:17:27.460
 it's a big sort of hypothesis of mine.

2:17:27.460 --> 2:17:30.700
 I did kind of publish that part of my hypothesis

2:17:30.700 --> 2:17:33.660
 in a review article, but I do wish more people

2:17:33.660 --> 2:17:36.900
 to kind of look into that, that'd be amazing.

2:17:36.900 --> 2:17:38.540
 But what I was getting at, I think,

2:17:38.540 --> 2:17:43.540
 was I would use the sauna to memorize things.

2:17:44.660 --> 2:17:46.740
 This is way back in the day, and I still do it.

2:17:46.740 --> 2:17:48.220
 And I wanted to talk to you about this

2:17:48.220 --> 2:17:50.900
 because you're a neuroscientist,

2:17:50.900 --> 2:17:54.740
 that there's something about being in the sauna,

2:17:54.740 --> 2:17:56.020
 and I think, I don't know if it has to do

2:17:56.020 --> 2:17:58.380
 with the stress response,

2:17:58.380 --> 2:18:00.900
 like when you have an emotional trigger,

2:18:00.900 --> 2:18:02.580
 like you remember things better, right?

2:18:02.580 --> 2:18:06.980
 Absolutely, there is a clear and known explanation

2:18:06.980 --> 2:18:08.340
 for mechanism for this, yeah.

2:18:08.340 --> 2:18:12.140
 So in the sauna, I mean, you also release norepinephrine,

2:18:12.140 --> 2:18:14.340
 just like you do in the cold, there's a lot of overlap.

2:18:14.340 --> 2:18:16.900
 You know, you're really, I mean, it is a stressor,

2:18:16.900 --> 2:18:20.540
 but I like use it to remember things,

2:18:20.540 --> 2:18:21.700
 like I'm going through something,

2:18:21.700 --> 2:18:23.500
 I want to go through a presentation or a talk

2:18:23.500 --> 2:18:26.100
 or a podcast or whatever, and I go in that sauna,

2:18:26.100 --> 2:18:27.540
 and I mean, you should try it,

2:18:27.540 --> 2:18:28.940
 like if you haven't already, I don't know if you have.

2:18:28.940 --> 2:18:30.580
 I have a sauna and a cold plunge now,

2:18:30.580 --> 2:18:33.860
 I haven't tried prepare, I read books in the sauna

2:18:33.860 --> 2:18:36.220
 in the evening, it's a time I insist

2:18:36.220 --> 2:18:38.580
 on having my phone out of there,

2:18:38.580 --> 2:18:39.820
 mostly because I, initially,

2:18:39.820 --> 2:18:41.380
 because I thought I'd cook the phone,

2:18:41.380 --> 2:18:43.300
 but also just to get some separation from the phone

2:18:43.300 --> 2:18:45.100
 and screens in the evening, so I read books.

2:18:45.100 --> 2:18:46.740
 The only challenge sometimes is you're dripping sweat

2:18:46.740 --> 2:18:48.020
 onto the books, but I'm willing to forego

2:18:48.020 --> 2:18:49.200
 a few pages of a book.

2:18:50.060 --> 2:18:55.060
 The idea that being in this semi-stressful environment

2:18:55.580 --> 2:18:59.020
 would aid in the learning and retention of information

2:18:59.020 --> 2:19:01.500
 is really well substantiated by this beautiful work

2:19:01.500 --> 2:19:02.940
 by a guy named James McGaugh.

2:19:02.940 --> 2:19:04.220
 I don't know if his lab's still active,

2:19:04.220 --> 2:19:06.740
 but he was at UC Irvine for a while,

2:19:06.740 --> 2:19:10.360
 and then I think at University of Arizona as well.

2:19:10.360 --> 2:19:12.460
 They have a great memory group at both places,

2:19:12.460 --> 2:19:15.320
 very strong in learning and memory, both places.

2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:18.180
 And he was the one that really defined this

2:19:18.180 --> 2:19:20.780
 kind of inverted U-shaped function

2:19:20.780 --> 2:19:24.140
 for the relationship between adrenaline and memory.

2:19:24.140 --> 2:19:27.860
 Basically, if you're too relaxed and not stressed enough,

2:19:27.860 --> 2:19:29.860
 you're not going to remember any information.

2:19:29.860 --> 2:19:34.700
 At peak levels of stress, you actually are a memory machine,

2:19:34.700 --> 2:19:36.280
 at least within the context of whatever it is

2:19:36.280 --> 2:19:37.220
 you're trying to learn.

2:19:37.220 --> 2:19:41.260
 So what you're describing very well matches with that.

2:19:41.260 --> 2:19:42.420
 And then of course it tapers off

2:19:42.420 --> 2:19:45.020
 as you really increase adrenaline to the point

2:19:45.020 --> 2:19:47.440
 where people are starting to lose autonomic function,

2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:49.840
 where they're just, they're panicking basically,

2:19:49.840 --> 2:19:51.220
 but obviously you're keeping it in range.

2:19:51.220 --> 2:19:53.220
 The other thing that I'd like to ask you about

2:19:53.220 --> 2:19:55.420
 is in the sauna, of course, there's vasodilation,

2:19:55.420 --> 2:19:56.940
 and perfusion of blood to the brain

2:19:56.940 --> 2:19:58.860
 is a wonderful way to enhance cognition.

2:19:58.860 --> 2:20:00.380
 There's even some really nice data

2:20:00.380 --> 2:20:03.660
 showing that during inhales, as opposed to exhales,

2:20:03.660 --> 2:20:06.780
 people are better at learning information.

2:20:06.780 --> 2:20:08.340
 Believe it or not, during the inhale,

2:20:08.340 --> 2:20:10.380
 you're taking in and absorbing and remembering

2:20:10.380 --> 2:20:11.460
 more than during exhales.

2:20:11.460 --> 2:20:15.060
 And these are beautiful studies done in humans, of course.

2:20:15.060 --> 2:20:17.740
 So I can imagine that vasodilation,

2:20:17.740 --> 2:20:19.580
 getting more perfusion of blood to the brain,

2:20:19.580 --> 2:20:21.140
 plus a little bit of stress,

2:20:21.140 --> 2:20:23.460
 or maybe a lot of stress from the epinephrine,

2:20:24.500 --> 2:20:25.900
 and yet it's, and then of course,

2:20:25.900 --> 2:20:27.780
 there's going to be the, I don't want to call it placebo,

2:20:27.780 --> 2:20:29.660
 but there's going to be the context,

2:20:29.660 --> 2:20:31.980
 the conditioned place context of it.

2:20:31.980 --> 2:20:34.220
 Like if we had a good experience

2:20:34.220 --> 2:20:35.860
 remembering something in the sauna once,

2:20:35.860 --> 2:20:37.620
 we tend to, the positive association effect

2:20:37.620 --> 2:20:38.820
 of that location is real.

2:20:38.820 --> 2:20:42.220
 Just like if people go to a new city and they get robbed,

2:20:42.220 --> 2:20:43.340
 like if you go to Cincinnati,

2:20:43.340 --> 2:20:44.180
 I've never been to Cincinnati,

2:20:44.180 --> 2:20:45.380
 but you get robbed in Cincinnati,

2:20:45.380 --> 2:20:47.220
 your purse gets taken or your wallet gets taken,

2:20:47.220 --> 2:20:49.420
 you kind of hate Cincinnati as a tourist,

2:20:49.420 --> 2:20:51.980
 but that could happen in any number of different cities.

2:20:51.980 --> 2:20:53.380
 The opposite is also true.

2:20:53.380 --> 2:20:55.100
 So if something good happens someplace,

2:20:55.100 --> 2:20:57.340
 so I'm imagining that it's a combination of those effects,

2:20:57.340 --> 2:20:59.340
 but I'll start, it would be very hard

2:20:59.340 --> 2:21:00.860
 to do this in the cold.

2:21:00.860 --> 2:21:03.220
 I feel like the cold is a very potent,

2:21:03.220 --> 2:21:04.980
 I think it takes you too far down that curve,

2:21:04.980 --> 2:21:05.820
 the McGaugh curve.

2:21:05.820 --> 2:21:07.660
 I have to sing songs or something when I'm in there.

2:21:07.660 --> 2:21:08.500
 Distract yourself.

2:21:08.500 --> 2:21:09.340
 Oh yeah, I sing songs.

2:21:09.340 --> 2:21:10.860
 But afterward, you're very efficient at learning.

2:21:10.860 --> 2:21:11.700
 After I am.

2:21:11.700 --> 2:21:13.540
 And with respect to the sauna,

2:21:13.540 --> 2:21:15.420
 the vasodilation does occur,

2:21:15.420 --> 2:21:18.260
 so there's a lot of overlap between moderate intensity,

2:21:18.260 --> 2:21:20.500
 aerobic exercise and heat stress.

2:21:20.500 --> 2:21:21.740
 And as you can imagine,

2:21:21.740 --> 2:21:22.580
 when you're exercising,

2:21:22.580 --> 2:21:24.620
 you're elevating your core body temperature,

2:21:24.620 --> 2:21:26.020
 you're sweating.

2:21:26.020 --> 2:21:28.500
 And when you're actually in the sauna,

2:21:28.500 --> 2:21:31.380
 blood does get redistributed to the skin

2:21:31.380 --> 2:21:32.580
 to facilitate sweating.

2:21:32.580 --> 2:21:34.860
 But much like exercise,

2:21:34.860 --> 2:21:38.260
 blood flow in general is improved to the brain,

2:21:38.260 --> 2:21:39.580
 to the muscles, everywhere.

2:21:39.580 --> 2:21:42.860
 So I think generally speaking that,

2:21:42.860 --> 2:21:45.760
 and there's studies showing that sauna use

2:21:45.760 --> 2:21:47.940
 is associated with a much lower risk

2:21:47.940 --> 2:21:49.380
 of dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

2:21:49.380 --> 2:21:52.220
 Like people that use it four to seven times a week

2:21:52.220 --> 2:21:55.700
 have greater than 60% reduction in dementia

2:21:55.700 --> 2:21:57.820
 and Alzheimer's disease risk compared to once.

2:21:57.820 --> 2:21:59.060
 Oh sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

2:21:59.060 --> 2:22:00.660
 You said people who use it,

2:22:00.660 --> 2:22:03.060
 I apologize, but maybe you tell us again,

2:22:03.060 --> 2:22:05.980
 people who use it four to seven times per week have?

2:22:05.980 --> 2:22:10.220
 They have a greater than 60% reduction in dementia risk

2:22:10.220 --> 2:22:11.420
 and Alzheimer's disease risk

2:22:11.420 --> 2:22:14.340
 compared to people that use it only one time a week.

2:22:14.340 --> 2:22:16.340
 People that use it two to three times a week

2:22:16.340 --> 2:22:19.940
 have something like a little greater than 20% reduction

2:22:19.940 --> 2:22:23.380
 so there's a dose-dependent effect on dementia risk

2:22:23.380 --> 2:22:25.460
 and Alzheimer's disease risk.

2:22:25.460 --> 2:22:27.940
 It also has a profound,

2:22:27.940 --> 2:22:29.220
 like there's a big link

2:22:29.220 --> 2:22:31.820
 between the cardiovascular system and the brain.

2:22:31.820 --> 2:22:33.460
 Obviously blood flow, a big one, right?

2:22:33.460 --> 2:22:36.000
 You know, like you need to get blood to your brain.

2:22:36.880 --> 2:22:39.700
 But cardiovascular mortality,

2:22:39.700 --> 2:22:42.020
 so mortality from cardiovascular disease,

2:22:42.020 --> 2:22:43.780
 if people use, or actually this was men,

2:22:43.780 --> 2:22:46.420
 if men use the sauna four to seven times a week,

2:22:46.420 --> 2:22:50.140
 it's a 50% reduction in cardiovascular-related mortality

2:22:50.140 --> 2:22:51.800
 compared to one time a week.

2:22:51.800 --> 2:22:54.260
 Again, dose-dependent manner two to three times a week

2:22:54.260 --> 2:22:57.660
 is something like 24% lower death

2:22:57.660 --> 2:22:58.940
 from cardiovascular disease.

2:22:58.940 --> 2:23:02.100
 There's also lower, you know, sudden cardiac death.

2:23:02.100 --> 2:23:03.160
 It's like a heart attack.

2:23:03.160 --> 2:23:05.740
 That's like 60-something, greater than 60% lower

2:23:05.740 --> 2:23:09.460
 if men use it four to seven times a week versus once.

2:23:09.460 --> 2:23:10.720
 Again, a dose-dependent thing.

2:23:10.720 --> 2:23:13.540
 And the thing that's so profound there also to me,

2:23:13.540 --> 2:23:15.140
 when again, looking at the methods,

2:23:15.140 --> 2:23:16.740
 when I look at the data,

2:23:16.740 --> 2:23:19.500
 and this is all work from Dr. Jari Laukonen.

2:23:19.500 --> 2:23:22.700
 He's in the University of Eastern Finland

2:23:22.700 --> 2:23:25.940
 and just one of the world experts on sauna use,

2:23:25.940 --> 2:23:28.060
 especially with respect to cardiovascular health.

2:23:28.060 --> 2:23:31.660
 What some of his data has also shown is that

2:23:31.660 --> 2:23:35.060
 if you look at the duration, the time spent in the sauna,

2:23:35.060 --> 2:23:36.980
 so I mentioned the temperature I do is about,

2:23:36.980 --> 2:23:39.420
 I do like 189 degrees Fahrenheit.

2:23:39.420 --> 2:23:42.860
 Typically I go in there, I'm pretty heat adapted.

2:23:42.860 --> 2:23:46.140
 And so the more you do the sauna

2:23:46.140 --> 2:23:47.680
 or any sort of heat stress,

2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:51.260
 whether it's a hot tub or jacuzzi, you become adapted.

2:23:51.260 --> 2:23:53.900
 You basically start to sweat at a lower core body temperature

2:23:53.900 --> 2:23:55.180
 to cool yourself down.

2:23:55.180 --> 2:23:56.580
 All these sort of physiological changes

2:23:56.580 --> 2:23:58.340
 start to happen earlier.

2:23:58.340 --> 2:24:01.540
 And so I stay in for like 30 minutes.

2:24:01.540 --> 2:24:03.020
 So I stay in a long time.

2:24:03.020 --> 2:24:03.860
 That's a lot.

2:24:03.860 --> 2:24:04.860
 You have to listen to your body.

2:24:04.860 --> 2:24:07.140
 Most of the studies that I just talked about

2:24:07.140 --> 2:24:11.340
 were from the duration, the time spent in the sauna.

2:24:11.340 --> 2:24:13.020
 And I said 50% reduction

2:24:13.020 --> 2:24:15.620
 in cardiovascular disease-related death.

2:24:15.620 --> 2:24:18.020
 What was shown was that men that were in the sauna

2:24:18.020 --> 2:24:19.780
 for only 11 minutes,

2:24:19.780 --> 2:24:21.620
 even if they used it four to seven times a week,

2:24:21.620 --> 2:24:24.760
 that reduction was only like 8% instead of 50.

2:24:24.760 --> 2:24:28.180
 It had to be greater than 19 minutes.

2:24:28.180 --> 2:24:29.860
 So like 20 minutes is the sweet spot

2:24:29.860 --> 2:24:33.340
 at about 174 degrees Fahrenheit.

2:24:33.340 --> 2:24:36.540
 And most of the saunas in Finland, by the way,

2:24:36.540 --> 2:24:40.860
 they're humid so they put hot water,

2:24:40.860 --> 2:24:43.620
 they put water on hot rocks to create steam.

2:24:43.620 --> 2:24:46.700
 And so it's usually between 10 to 20% humidity

2:24:46.700 --> 2:24:48.100
 in the Finnish sauna.

2:24:48.100 --> 2:24:50.220
 So those studies were, I would say,

2:24:50.220 --> 2:24:51.340
 most of the time you're gonna find

2:24:51.340 --> 2:24:53.600
 that their humidity is also elevated.

2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:56.740
 But to me, the dose-dependent nature of it

2:24:56.740 --> 2:24:59.260
 and the duration, knowing like, you know,

2:24:59.260 --> 2:25:02.100
 to me that's a very strong data

2:25:02.100 --> 2:25:05.740
 that this is more causal than some corollary thing.

2:25:05.740 --> 2:25:07.340
 Because that's always the problem

2:25:07.340 --> 2:25:09.900
 with observational studies, including these,

2:25:09.900 --> 2:25:12.340
 which they corrected for a whole host of factors

2:25:12.340 --> 2:25:14.540
 like cholesterol, you know, exercise,

2:25:14.540 --> 2:25:16.220
 just everything, everything under the sun.

2:25:16.220 --> 2:25:17.340
 I mean, they corrected for those.

2:25:17.340 --> 2:25:19.980
 And on top of that, you have the dose-dependent nature

2:25:19.980 --> 2:25:22.060
 of the duration, the time spent in the sauna,

2:25:22.060 --> 2:25:23.520
 and the frequency.

2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:26.220
 So to me it's like, something's going on here.

2:25:26.220 --> 2:25:28.180
 Plus there's been studies, intervention studies

2:25:28.180 --> 2:25:30.140
 where it's like, you know, comparing directly

2:25:30.140 --> 2:25:33.100
 head-to-head moderate intensity aerobic exercise

2:25:33.100 --> 2:25:37.020
 on a stationary cycle to 20 minutes in a sauna.

2:25:37.020 --> 2:25:39.540
 They're physiologically the same things happen.

2:25:39.540 --> 2:25:44.380
 So heart rate elevates while you're doing the activity.

2:25:44.380 --> 2:25:46.460
 Blood pressure increases while you're doing the activity.

2:25:46.460 --> 2:25:49.320
 But then after, heart rate decreases,

2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:51.680
 resting heart rate decreases below baseline.

2:25:51.680 --> 2:25:54.420
 Blood pressure is improved, so it decreases below baseline.

2:25:54.420 --> 2:25:55.620
 This is happening the same

2:25:55.620 --> 2:25:58.260
 in moderate intensity cycling versus sauna.

2:25:58.260 --> 2:26:01.060
 So again, this sauna, like this heat stress,

2:26:01.060 --> 2:26:03.840
 there's something about it that really mimics

2:26:03.840 --> 2:26:06.460
 this moderate intensity aerobic exercise,

2:26:06.460 --> 2:26:07.940
 which is really great for people

2:26:07.940 --> 2:26:12.440
 that can't go for a run, that can't even get on a bike.

2:26:12.440 --> 2:26:13.780
 So you know, disabled people,

2:26:13.780 --> 2:26:15.660
 granted there are some safety concerns,

2:26:15.660 --> 2:26:18.820
 they're pretty mild, but they do exist.

2:26:18.820 --> 2:26:20.340
 So people that had a recent heart attack

2:26:20.340 --> 2:26:23.340
 or have some rare kind of heart disease or problem,

2:26:23.340 --> 2:26:24.500
 drinking alcohol, never do that.

2:26:24.500 --> 2:26:27.380
 Elderly people prone to low blood pressure

2:26:27.380 --> 2:26:29.700
 always talk to a physician before doing the sauna.

2:26:29.700 --> 2:26:31.020
 It is stressful.

2:26:31.020 --> 2:26:31.860
 Pregnant.

2:26:31.860 --> 2:26:34.340
 Pregnant women, oh yeah, I definitely avoided saunas

2:26:34.340 --> 2:26:35.340
 when I was pregnant.

2:26:35.340 --> 2:26:39.540
 But I think it's very relevant for disabled people

2:26:39.540 --> 2:26:41.220
 and also people that are sedentary.

2:26:41.220 --> 2:26:42.340
 I've been sedentary most of her life.

2:26:42.340 --> 2:26:45.900
 Like my mother, I've been able to get her in the sauna

2:26:45.900 --> 2:26:48.660
 because she's not, I mean, I did get her

2:26:48.660 --> 2:26:50.800
 on the Peloton once, but it's really much easier.

2:26:50.800 --> 2:26:53.100
 She feels like it's a spa treatment

2:26:53.100 --> 2:26:55.780
 and it's like she can listen to her music in there

2:26:55.780 --> 2:26:57.860
 and I care about her health,

2:26:57.860 --> 2:27:00.180
 but she's mostly been a sedentary person.

2:27:00.180 --> 2:27:03.940
 And so I find it much easier to convince her

2:27:03.940 --> 2:27:06.360
 to get in the sauna than to get on Peloton.

2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:07.380
 Ideally, you do both.

2:27:07.380 --> 2:27:10.060
 The question would be, well, I exercise, I run,

2:27:10.060 --> 2:27:12.160
 I do my high intensity interval training,

2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:13.860
 why do I need to get in the sauna?

2:27:13.860 --> 2:27:17.260
 And the reality is, and so I published all this

2:27:17.260 --> 2:27:21.300
 in a review in the experimental gerontology last year,

2:27:21.300 --> 2:27:23.140
 I guess, late last year.

2:27:23.140 --> 2:27:27.400
 And basically, cardiorespiratory fitness,

2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:31.420
 which is a marker of, it's a marker of health.

2:27:31.420 --> 2:27:34.460
 You know, cardiorespiratory fitness is improved

2:27:34.460 --> 2:27:37.420
 in people that do exercise and sauna

2:27:37.420 --> 2:27:40.060
 compared to exercise alone or sauna alone.

2:27:40.060 --> 2:27:43.020
 So for those healthy, fit people out there

2:27:43.020 --> 2:27:47.340
 already exercising, there's a synergistic effect

2:27:47.340 --> 2:27:49.860
 by also adding a sauna into that routine.

2:27:49.860 --> 2:27:51.700
 And to me, that's great.

2:27:51.700 --> 2:27:55.620
 And there's so many beneficial things happening

2:27:55.620 --> 2:27:57.300
 with the heat stress in addition

2:27:57.300 --> 2:27:59.100
 to like mimicking aerobic exercise.

2:27:59.100 --> 2:28:01.660
 There's the heat check proteins that we talked about earlier

2:28:01.660 --> 2:28:03.420
 and those, it kind of brings me back

2:28:03.420 --> 2:28:06.100
 to my early days of science when I was

2:28:06.100 --> 2:28:08.680
 at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies

2:28:08.680 --> 2:28:11.620
 doing research on little nematode worms

2:28:11.620 --> 2:28:16.620
 that we, or someone else, injected amyloid beta 42,

2:28:17.820 --> 2:28:21.160
 the peptide, the 42 amino acid peptide

2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:24.860
 that is involved in amyloid plaques found in the brain

2:28:24.860 --> 2:28:26.220
 correlated with Alzheimer's disease

2:28:26.220 --> 2:28:28.180
 and other, you know, brain disorders.

2:28:28.180 --> 2:28:31.500
 We injected those into the muscle tissue of worms.

2:28:31.500 --> 2:28:34.740
 And basically, these worms become paralyzed with age

2:28:34.740 --> 2:28:39.740
 because the aggregated proteins, these proteins aggregate.

2:28:40.260 --> 2:28:43.100
 Well, heat shock proteins, one of the main things they do

2:28:43.100 --> 2:28:45.140
 is they basically make sure the proteins

2:28:45.140 --> 2:28:47.740
 inside of your cells maintain their proper

2:28:47.740 --> 2:28:50.540
 three-dimensional structure and are folded right

2:28:50.540 --> 2:28:54.100
 and so they don't, they're not prone to aggregating

2:28:54.100 --> 2:28:56.740
 and forming these plaques in your arteries

2:28:56.740 --> 2:28:57.980
 and also in the brain.

2:28:57.980 --> 2:29:02.100
 And there's, back to my worm studies I was doing,

2:29:02.100 --> 2:29:04.920
 I would elevate heat shock proteins in those worms

2:29:04.920 --> 2:29:07.420
 and it would totally, you know, correct the problem

2:29:07.420 --> 2:29:09.780
 where they would no longer become paralyzed.

2:29:09.780 --> 2:29:11.140
 They'd move around like they were young.

2:29:11.140 --> 2:29:13.720
 So many animal studies have been done looking

2:29:13.720 --> 2:29:18.720
 at Alzheimer's disease, you know, like a human-like

2:29:18.820 --> 2:29:20.300
 Alzheimer's disease in a rodent

2:29:20.300 --> 2:29:22.420
 and heat shock proteins protecting from it, you know.

2:29:22.420 --> 2:29:26.460
 So heat shock proteins are robustly activated in humans.

2:29:26.460 --> 2:29:31.420
 This has been shown to even, you know, 50% higher

2:29:31.420 --> 2:29:33.680
 over baseline levels after just 30 minutes

2:29:33.680 --> 2:29:36.660
 at 163 degrees Fahrenheit in the sauna.

2:29:36.660 --> 2:29:39.780
 So, and they stay activated at least in rodents

2:29:39.780 --> 2:29:43.120
 for, you know, 48 hours at least.

2:29:43.120 --> 2:29:47.020
 So, you know, having these heat shock proteins around,

2:29:47.020 --> 2:29:50.100
 making sure they're properly taking care of our proteins

2:29:50.100 --> 2:29:51.500
 so they're not aggregating in our brains

2:29:51.500 --> 2:29:54.340
 and in our plaques could be another potential way

2:29:54.340 --> 2:29:57.340
 that sauna's protecting from Alzheimer's disease

2:29:57.340 --> 2:30:00.420
 and other, you know, cardiovascular health

2:30:00.420 --> 2:30:01.800
 as well as longevity.

2:30:01.800 --> 2:30:05.260
 So, you know, there's people that have SNPs

2:30:05.260 --> 2:30:08.180
 in heat shock protein factor 70

2:30:08.180 --> 2:30:10.340
 that if they have one of them,

2:30:10.340 --> 2:30:11.500
 so they got one from their parents

2:30:11.500 --> 2:30:13.680
 where they have more active heat shock protein 70,

2:30:13.680 --> 2:30:15.380
 they live on average one year longer

2:30:15.380 --> 2:30:16.860
 than people that don't have that SNP.

2:30:16.860 --> 2:30:18.180
 And if they have two versions,

2:30:18.180 --> 2:30:20.400
 if they got one from their mom and one from their dad,

2:30:20.400 --> 2:30:21.820
 they live on average two years longer

2:30:21.820 --> 2:30:23.060
 than people that don't have that SNP.

2:30:23.060 --> 2:30:25.420
 So, it's also been associated with human longevity

2:30:25.420 --> 2:30:26.820
 as well as in lower organisms.

2:30:26.820 --> 2:30:28.780
 So, you can heat shock a worm or a fly

2:30:28.780 --> 2:30:30.900
 and they live 15% longer.

2:30:30.900 --> 2:30:32.500
 This is work done by Gordon Lithgow

2:30:32.500 --> 2:30:34.780
 at the Buck Institute years and years ago.

2:30:36.020 --> 2:30:38.880
 So, anyways, I guess what I was getting at

2:30:38.880 --> 2:30:40.980
 was the heat shock proteins

2:30:40.980 --> 2:30:42.540
 are part of that stress response pathway

2:30:42.540 --> 2:30:43.860
 that we talked about earlier.

2:30:43.860 --> 2:30:46.900
 And, you know, they're also activated by cold as well.

2:30:46.900 --> 2:30:49.100
 Cold shock does activate heat shock proteins.

2:30:49.100 --> 2:30:50.020
 Not as robust.

2:30:50.020 --> 2:30:51.560
 Sulfuraphane activates them.

2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:52.500
 Again, it's one of the reasons

2:30:52.500 --> 2:30:54.300
 I think we should get all of these things

2:30:54.300 --> 2:30:57.100
 because they are more robust inputs.

2:30:57.100 --> 2:30:59.860
 You know, their input activating mechanisms

2:30:59.860 --> 2:31:02.060
 are more robust for, you know, different ones.

2:31:02.060 --> 2:31:03.340
 So, there is crosstalk.

2:31:03.340 --> 2:31:04.860
 There is, you know, I mean,

2:31:04.860 --> 2:31:08.860
 I guess it'd be more accurate to say there's overlap.

2:31:08.860 --> 2:31:11.860
 But, you know, it's also like

2:31:11.860 --> 2:31:14.060
 you want to get the most robust from all of them, right?

2:31:14.060 --> 2:31:14.900
 I do.

2:31:14.900 --> 2:31:18.120
 So, I mean, that's why I want to do the sauna and exercise

2:31:18.120 --> 2:31:23.120
 and eat my broccoli sprouts and all that stuff.

2:31:23.380 --> 2:31:25.220
 It's super interesting.

2:31:25.220 --> 2:31:28.220
 A couple of questions came up for me.

2:31:28.220 --> 2:31:31.300
 One is, you mentioned these SNPs,

2:31:31.300 --> 2:31:33.200
 these nucleotide repeats.

2:31:33.200 --> 2:31:34.780
 Basically genes that some people have,

2:31:34.780 --> 2:31:37.020
 more of or less of, than others

2:31:37.020 --> 2:31:40.120
 that can predict longevity in some sense.

2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:42.600
 Is that the FOXO3 pathway?

2:31:42.600 --> 2:31:44.120
 That's one that can, yeah.

2:31:44.120 --> 2:31:46.460
 I mean, FOXO3 is,

2:31:46.460 --> 2:31:48.140
 in fact, if you go back to the worm studies

2:31:48.140 --> 2:31:48.980
 I was talking about,

2:31:48.980 --> 2:31:50.620
 that was like one of the first things

2:31:50.620 --> 2:31:51.860
 when you see it with your own eyes,

2:31:51.860 --> 2:31:53.460
 you can take these worms

2:31:53.460 --> 2:31:56.020
 that you basically decrease

2:31:56.020 --> 2:31:59.060
 their insulin signaling pathway and their IGF-1.

2:31:59.060 --> 2:32:01.540
 Worms have what are called homologous genes.

2:32:01.540 --> 2:32:04.220
 So, they have a lot of similarities to humans.

2:32:04.220 --> 2:32:05.980
 They have an insulin-like receptor.

2:32:05.980 --> 2:32:07.780
 They have an IGF-1-like receptor.

2:32:07.780 --> 2:32:10.500
 And they make something like FOXO3, which we have.

2:32:10.500 --> 2:32:14.620
 And basically if you decrease that insulin signaling pathway

2:32:14.620 --> 2:32:17.460
 their FOXO3 is always active in those worms.

2:32:17.460 --> 2:32:19.340
 And they live like 100% longer.

2:32:19.340 --> 2:32:21.260
 And not only do they live longer,

2:32:21.260 --> 2:32:25.140
 I mean, they are like a very young worm.

2:32:25.140 --> 2:32:26.220
 I mean, they are like,

2:32:26.220 --> 2:32:27.660
 you look at this thing and you're like,

2:32:27.660 --> 2:32:30.980
 this looks like the worm that was just born like hours ago.

2:32:30.980 --> 2:32:31.800
 What's going on?

2:32:31.800 --> 2:32:33.540
 This thing's at the end of its life.

2:32:33.540 --> 2:32:35.740
 Now, as a side note,

2:32:35.740 --> 2:32:37.820
 the thing that always got me on this was,

2:32:37.820 --> 2:32:39.800
 by the way, this was discovered by Cynthia Kenyon,

2:32:39.800 --> 2:32:42.200
 and this was like back in the 90s.

2:32:42.200 --> 2:32:44.480
 And honestly, I'm not sure that anything

2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:46.620
 has been as exciting in the worm world since then,

2:32:46.620 --> 2:32:50.180
 but I thought, I mean, it was a really big finding.

2:32:50.180 --> 2:32:52.740
 The only caveat there is that the worms

2:32:52.740 --> 2:32:55.740
 go through this dour, it's called a dour stage

2:32:55.740 --> 2:32:56.800
 when this happens,

2:32:56.800 --> 2:32:58.980
 when you decrease their insulin signaling and stuff.

2:32:58.980 --> 2:33:01.400
 And they like go into this like metabolic stasis.

2:33:01.400 --> 2:33:03.580
 Like they're not eating as much or moving.

2:33:03.580 --> 2:33:05.580
 And so it's like, okay, well, they live 100% longer,

2:33:05.580 --> 2:33:08.620
 but like they go into this weird state.

2:33:08.620 --> 2:33:11.660
 I know people like this, some in the longevity community,

2:33:11.660 --> 2:33:13.300
 they know who they are.

2:33:13.300 --> 2:33:14.420
 But they'll get the last laugh

2:33:14.420 --> 2:33:16.780
 because I'll be dead, well-fed, but dead.

2:33:16.780 --> 2:33:18.780
 And they'll still be going.

2:33:19.820 --> 2:33:23.580
 So in terms of the many data on sauna,

2:33:23.580 --> 2:33:27.380
 and I also just want to acknowledge these Finnish groups

2:33:27.380 --> 2:33:29.260
 that did this work is really pioneering, right?

2:33:29.260 --> 2:33:30.500
 When you think 20 years ago,

2:33:30.500 --> 2:33:32.720
 long before social media or any of this,

2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:35.900
 and they're up there, I should say,

2:33:35.900 --> 2:33:38.180
 measuring cortisol and growth hormone

2:33:38.180 --> 2:33:41.900
 and all this stuff in people getting in and out of sauna.

2:33:41.900 --> 2:33:43.960
 Very, very interesting.

2:33:43.960 --> 2:33:46.980
 So 20 minutes seems like the threshold

2:33:46.980 --> 2:33:49.360
 at 170 degrees Fahrenheit.

2:33:51.000 --> 2:33:53.560
 More times per week seems to be better than fewer

2:33:53.560 --> 2:33:55.640
 when you think, in terms of all-cause mortality,

2:33:55.640 --> 2:33:58.260
 cardiovascular risk, according to what I just learned

2:33:58.260 --> 2:33:59.100
 from you.

2:33:59.100 --> 2:34:01.380
 Four would be a good, I think, minimum effective dose.

2:34:01.380 --> 2:34:02.220
 Four times a week.

2:34:02.220 --> 2:34:04.060
 And you combine it with the cold.

2:34:04.060 --> 2:34:06.660
 I've also seen a protocol where,

2:34:06.660 --> 2:34:08.100
 it's a very extreme protocol.

2:34:08.100 --> 2:34:09.880
 I don't recommend this to people right off the bat,

2:34:09.880 --> 2:34:12.660
 where they had human subjects get into the sauna

2:34:12.660 --> 2:34:14.360
 for 30 minutes, get out for five,

2:34:14.360 --> 2:34:16.140
 30 minutes, get out for five, 30 minutes,

2:34:16.140 --> 2:34:18.500
 for a total of two hours of exposure.

2:34:18.500 --> 2:34:21.540
 But that was what led to these massive

2:34:21.540 --> 2:34:24.140
 16-fold increases in growth hormone.

2:34:24.140 --> 2:34:27.180
 I actually have a, and they had to do it very seldom.

2:34:27.180 --> 2:34:28.860
 So it sounds like these protocols you're describing,

2:34:28.860 --> 2:34:31.360
 20 minutes done four times per week,

2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:33.820
 far more reasonable for most people to access.

2:34:33.820 --> 2:34:37.280
 But I know people are probably desperate to know

2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:38.780
 what if they don't have a sauna?

2:34:38.780 --> 2:34:40.700
 You know, a sauna is kind of a unique item.

2:34:40.700 --> 2:34:41.980
 So I have a couple of questions.

2:34:41.980 --> 2:34:43.420
 Can people use hot baths?

2:34:44.420 --> 2:34:45.860
 With the appropriate warning, of course,

2:34:45.860 --> 2:34:48.140
 that without getting into description

2:34:48.140 --> 2:34:50.200
 of the mechanics and the underlying biology,

2:34:50.200 --> 2:34:54.360
 it's pretty obvious that the testes,

2:34:54.360 --> 2:34:57.500
 if they get too warm, you'll kill sperm.

2:34:57.500 --> 2:35:00.500
 That's the reason why the testes are housed in a structure

2:35:00.500 --> 2:35:02.220
 called the scrotum that can move around.

2:35:02.220 --> 2:35:03.860
 So just to be, you know, here we are,

2:35:03.860 --> 2:35:06.780
 biologists just talking about realities here.

2:35:06.780 --> 2:35:08.900
 So if you're trying to conceive children

2:35:08.900 --> 2:35:10.820
 or keep your sperm healthy,

2:35:10.820 --> 2:35:13.260
 guys should probably stay out of warm, hot baths.

2:35:13.260 --> 2:35:14.180
 For at least six months.

2:35:14.180 --> 2:35:15.020
 That's been shown.

2:35:15.020 --> 2:35:15.860
 Six months.

2:35:15.860 --> 2:35:20.620
 So sperm motility goes down and sperm production goes down,

2:35:20.620 --> 2:35:23.420
 but that is completely like corrected

2:35:23.420 --> 2:35:25.740
 if they stay out of the sauna for six months.

2:35:25.740 --> 2:35:27.620
 So through six months later, it's back to normal.

2:35:27.620 --> 2:35:28.460
 Great.

2:35:28.460 --> 2:35:29.940
 That's very useful information, I'm sure,

2:35:29.940 --> 2:35:32.260
 to a number of people out there.

2:35:32.260 --> 2:35:37.020
 So if people don't have access to a sauna,

2:35:37.020 --> 2:35:38.340
 and we get this about cold too.

2:35:38.340 --> 2:35:40.000
 You always say, what about cold showers?

2:35:40.000 --> 2:35:40.840
 And I always say, well,

2:35:40.840 --> 2:35:42.820
 the studies have mainly been done on immersion

2:35:42.820 --> 2:35:44.540
 because it's hard to keep things controlled

2:35:44.540 --> 2:35:45.540
 in cold showers.

2:35:45.540 --> 2:35:46.980
 It just doesn't make for a very good experiment

2:35:46.980 --> 2:35:49.100
 because you get a bigger person,

2:35:49.100 --> 2:35:50.480
 less of them is under the shower.

2:35:50.480 --> 2:35:51.900
 And so it doesn't make for a good experiment.

2:35:51.900 --> 2:35:53.600
 So it's not as good as immersion.

2:35:53.600 --> 2:35:54.860
 But with heat,

2:35:54.860 --> 2:35:58.020
 I could imagine that a hot bath would work almost as well.

2:35:58.020 --> 2:35:59.780
 Yeah, so there's been some studies looking at,

2:35:59.780 --> 2:36:01.660
 for example, activation of heat shock proteins,

2:36:01.660 --> 2:36:03.840
 also brain drive neurotrophic factor increases

2:36:03.840 --> 2:36:04.980
 with heat stress.

2:36:04.980 --> 2:36:09.540
 And so the hot bath at around 104 degrees Fahrenheit,

2:36:09.540 --> 2:36:12.380
 which is typically what studies will use for temperature,

2:36:12.380 --> 2:36:15.180
 which is actually cooler than when I crank my bath hot.

2:36:15.180 --> 2:36:16.420
 It's so hot.

2:36:16.420 --> 2:36:17.820
 But you're very heat adapted.

2:36:17.820 --> 2:36:19.140
 I'm very heat adapted, yeah.

2:36:19.140 --> 2:36:21.860
 And it's 20 minutes from the shoulders down.

2:36:21.860 --> 2:36:24.180
 And that is like a very robust activation

2:36:24.180 --> 2:36:26.780
 in heat shock proteins and in brain drive

2:36:26.780 --> 2:36:28.140
 neurotrophic factor.

2:36:28.140 --> 2:36:30.500
 And then heat shock proteins are also protecting

2:36:30.500 --> 2:36:31.580
 against muscle atrophy.

2:36:31.580 --> 2:36:33.620
 So that's also having to do with the protein structure

2:36:33.620 --> 2:36:34.740
 in the muscle tissue as well.

2:36:34.740 --> 2:36:38.340
 And this has been studies in animal data,

2:36:38.340 --> 2:36:40.620
 as well as some recent human data as well.

2:36:40.620 --> 2:36:43.200
 It was local hyperthermia or local heat treatment,

2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:45.620
 but essentially it showed that it protected.

2:36:45.620 --> 2:36:46.860
 I mean, it was like,

2:36:46.860 --> 2:36:50.080
 there was a study where they were looking at muscle disuse

2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:53.180
 and it was something like the local heat treatment

2:36:53.180 --> 2:36:56.460
 prevented like almost 40% of the muscle atrophy

2:36:56.460 --> 2:36:57.300
 from disuse.

2:36:57.300 --> 2:36:59.420
 So like, and it's funny because I used to use this on

2:36:59.420 --> 2:37:00.400
 when I was injured and stuff.

2:37:00.400 --> 2:37:04.340
 I would go in the sauna because I didn't know at the time

2:37:04.340 --> 2:37:05.500
 because I was a graduate student,

2:37:05.500 --> 2:37:07.700
 but I knew just from experiments

2:37:07.700 --> 2:37:11.220
 that like I'm not losing as much muscle, I feel better.

2:37:11.220 --> 2:37:13.540
 Like at the time I was reading a little

2:37:13.540 --> 2:37:15.300
 about the growth hormone and stuff back then,

2:37:15.300 --> 2:37:17.900
 but, and I knew about heat shock proteins.

2:37:17.900 --> 2:37:21.640
 And so I kind of knew, but that data wasn't around yet.

2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:24.780
 And so now we have the data and I've always like,

2:37:24.780 --> 2:37:27.780
 felt like I wasn't losing my muscle

2:37:27.780 --> 2:37:29.540
 like I should have been when I was doing the sauna.

2:37:29.540 --> 2:37:32.640
 And I was doing it literally seven days a week.

2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:33.660
 It was like hardcore.

2:37:33.660 --> 2:37:35.580
 This is also during graduate school.

2:37:35.580 --> 2:37:40.580
 Yeah, now I'm doing the sauna like a bare, bare minimum.

2:37:40.620 --> 2:37:42.900
 I do three, but I try to do four because of the,

2:37:42.900 --> 2:37:45.220
 it all depends on my schedule.

2:37:45.220 --> 2:37:46.620
 I also like to do long runs.

2:37:46.620 --> 2:37:49.460
 I really, it's like long being like three miles,

2:37:49.460 --> 2:37:52.340
 not like Cam Hanes long.

2:37:52.340 --> 2:37:55.940
 But I really, for me, and we were talking about this earlier

2:37:55.940 --> 2:38:00.500
 like off camera that the runs for me are for my brain.

2:38:00.500 --> 2:38:03.860
 And I get this mind wandering effect

2:38:03.860 --> 2:38:05.380
 where I daydream and I think about things.

2:38:05.380 --> 2:38:06.540
 I work through problems.

2:38:06.540 --> 2:38:07.380
 I get creative.

2:38:07.380 --> 2:38:10.520
 I come up with ideas and this is all happening on the runs.

2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:15.100
 And so I just, I miss my runs if I don't do them

2:38:15.100 --> 2:38:19.020
 and I miss it because of the brain effects I get from it.

2:38:19.020 --> 2:38:22.620
 And when I exercise, it's funny because I'm a female

2:38:22.620 --> 2:38:25.460
 and you think that I'd be exercising to stay fit

2:38:25.460 --> 2:38:27.420
 and in shape and care about my figure.

2:38:27.420 --> 2:38:30.340
 But when I exercise, literally what I'm thinking about

2:38:30.340 --> 2:38:32.460
 is my brain and I'm like,

2:38:32.460 --> 2:38:34.820
 this is the best longevity drug there is.

2:38:34.820 --> 2:38:36.500
 This is it right here, Rhonda.

2:38:36.500 --> 2:38:37.340
 You're always wandering.

2:38:37.340 --> 2:38:38.160
 You're always wanting to know.

2:38:38.160 --> 2:38:39.000
 You're wanting to do the best.

2:38:39.000 --> 2:38:42.180
 If you don't exercise, you're missing that essential dose.

2:38:42.180 --> 2:38:45.380
 And so that for me is the motivation,

2:38:45.380 --> 2:38:48.260
 the doping seeking thing I'm looking for.

2:38:48.260 --> 2:38:52.340
 Admittedly, I do not do enough strength training

2:38:52.340 --> 2:38:54.380
 and I have to do it, have to, have to, have to.

2:38:54.380 --> 2:38:57.780
 I'm like, I'm so after the endurance and the hit

2:38:57.780 --> 2:39:00.260
 and I really need to add that in

2:39:00.260 --> 2:39:02.820
 because muscle mass is also extremely important

2:39:02.820 --> 2:39:04.180
 for aging as well.

2:39:04.180 --> 2:39:06.540
 So that's my fault.

2:39:06.540 --> 2:39:09.960
 Well, the brain effects are really interesting.

2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:11.180
 I also run.

2:39:11.180 --> 2:39:13.420
 I try and get one longer run per week and a few other runs

2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:15.300
 and I do it without a phone.

2:39:15.300 --> 2:39:16.620
 I don't listen to podcasts.

2:39:16.620 --> 2:39:18.180
 I occasionally will listen to music,

2:39:18.180 --> 2:39:19.700
 but I really try not to.

2:39:19.700 --> 2:39:22.100
 I also find that my mind solves problems.

2:39:22.100 --> 2:39:26.260
 I feel like it washes out the cobwebs, so to speak.

2:39:26.260 --> 2:39:31.060
 Some of the most brilliant and prolific neuroscientists

2:39:31.060 --> 2:39:34.220
 that I know who've had very long careers, Eric Kandel,

2:39:34.220 --> 2:39:35.940
 Nobel prize winner at Columbia comes to mind

2:39:35.940 --> 2:39:39.300
 for all his work on memory, used to swim a mile a day.

2:39:39.300 --> 2:39:41.260
 And now I think swims half a mile a day,

2:39:41.260 --> 2:39:44.580
 but he's in his late 90s and he's still sharp,

2:39:44.580 --> 2:39:45.880
 which is incredible.

2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:47.900
 And his lab has done some work showing that

2:39:47.900 --> 2:39:50.260
 any load bearing exercise repeated.

2:39:50.260 --> 2:39:52.820
 So endurance work, unlike the Peloton or cycling,

2:39:52.820 --> 2:39:53.700
 that's really load bearing,

2:39:53.700 --> 2:39:55.780
 although you're cycling really hard with the resistance,

2:39:55.780 --> 2:40:00.780
 but causes the release of osteocalcin from the bones,

2:40:00.780 --> 2:40:04.060
 which acts in an endocrine way, sort of like a hormone,

2:40:04.060 --> 2:40:06.100
 can actually travel to the hippocampus.

2:40:06.100 --> 2:40:08.300
 And at least in these animal studies,

2:40:08.300 --> 2:40:11.740
 induce the proliferation of neurons, growth of synapses,

2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:13.380
 BDNF, a number of downstream things,

2:40:13.380 --> 2:40:15.100
 which kind of makes sense.

2:40:15.100 --> 2:40:18.340
 If we were to put a just so evolutionary story on this,

2:40:18.340 --> 2:40:21.220
 a body that's active can signal to the brain

2:40:21.220 --> 2:40:23.260
 that the body still needs cognition.

2:40:23.260 --> 2:40:27.460
 An inactive body in some ways is depriving the brain

2:40:27.460 --> 2:40:30.180
 of any signal of what the body is doing, right?

2:40:30.180 --> 2:40:33.380
 This is obviously I'm making this up as conjecture,

2:40:33.380 --> 2:40:37.020
 but we know in various ocean animals

2:40:37.020 --> 2:40:38.980
 that they'll swim around for some period of their life

2:40:38.980 --> 2:40:41.300
 and then they'll have a completely stationary portion

2:40:41.300 --> 2:40:42.140
 of their life.

2:40:42.140 --> 2:40:44.420
 And basically the brain degenerates there.

2:40:44.420 --> 2:40:45.780
 You don't need much of a nervous system

2:40:45.780 --> 2:40:46.760
 if you're not moving.

2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:48.060
 So I think there's really something there

2:40:48.060 --> 2:40:51.260
 and also just letting your ideas and mind drift.

2:40:51.260 --> 2:40:52.220
 I love that you,

2:40:52.220 --> 2:40:54.300
 and I appreciate that you shared your protocols

2:40:54.300 --> 2:40:57.360
 because I think right now we're in an interesting time

2:40:57.360 --> 2:40:59.700
 in public health information history

2:40:59.700 --> 2:41:02.060
 where people are just kind of getting bombarded

2:41:02.060 --> 2:41:05.580
 with cold is good, heat is gold, cold is good,

2:41:05.580 --> 2:41:08.520
 heat is good, excuse me, I misspoke.

2:41:08.520 --> 2:41:10.020
 There are all these micronutrients

2:41:10.020 --> 2:41:11.940
 and of course, macronutrients are important too.

2:41:11.940 --> 2:41:15.260
 And today you've really enriched us

2:41:15.260 --> 2:41:18.640
 with the description of the underlying mechanisms

2:41:18.640 --> 2:41:19.620
 and the logic behind them.

2:41:19.620 --> 2:41:22.200
 But also sharing what you do is really informative

2:41:22.200 --> 2:41:24.820
 because I think people need a jumping off place

2:41:24.820 --> 2:41:27.640
 and obviously they need to start someplace

2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:29.780
 and getting heat adapted, et cetera, it takes time.

2:41:29.780 --> 2:41:31.340
 But I really appreciate that you're willing

2:41:31.340 --> 2:41:33.260
 to share your protocols and that you do the things

2:41:33.260 --> 2:41:36.540
 that you teach and educate people about.

2:41:36.540 --> 2:41:40.100
 As a final question, because I have to ask,

2:41:41.680 --> 2:41:44.560
 red light sauna or no red light sauna?

2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:46.780
 I've been a little bit vocal about my feelings

2:41:46.780 --> 2:41:49.020
 that none of the red light saunas I've ever been in

2:41:49.020 --> 2:41:51.340
 got hot enough and it was frustrating.

2:41:51.340 --> 2:41:53.740
 So I feel like it's neither here nor there.

2:41:53.740 --> 2:41:55.940
 However, I do acknowledge that red light

2:41:55.940 --> 2:41:59.300
 and low level light therapies are now known

2:41:59.300 --> 2:42:00.660
 to do a number of interesting things.

2:42:00.660 --> 2:42:03.820
 It was a Nobel Prize in 1908 for phototherapy for lupus.

2:42:03.820 --> 2:42:05.620
 So it's not like a new thing,

2:42:05.620 --> 2:42:08.380
 the idea that red light and light could do things

2:42:08.380 --> 2:42:09.860
 positive for our biology.

2:42:09.860 --> 2:42:12.220
 But do you have a red light in your sauna?

2:42:12.220 --> 2:42:13.300
 Do you think it's useful?

2:42:13.300 --> 2:42:16.700
 And I mention this because this is the number one question

2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:19.740
 I get about sauna, red light or no red light

2:42:19.740 --> 2:42:22.140
 or some intermediate answer.

2:42:22.140 --> 2:42:26.820
 So I don't have an infrared sauna,

2:42:26.820 --> 2:42:29.980
 but I have a sauna that has lights, it makes red light,

2:42:29.980 --> 2:42:30.920
 but I don't think it's the red light

2:42:30.920 --> 2:42:31.760
 that you're talking about.

2:42:31.760 --> 2:42:35.460
 It's not activating it at a specific wavelength, which is-

2:42:35.460 --> 2:42:38.280
 It's usually so that the range that seems to be helpful,

2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:41.880
 and I confess, I use a red light panel for other things,

2:42:42.900 --> 2:42:47.900
 is 670 nanometer out to about 720 nanometer.

2:42:47.900 --> 2:42:52.900
 So it looks like red and very dim lights,

2:42:53.620 --> 2:42:55.300
 dim red and bright red.

2:42:55.300 --> 2:42:57.340
 And the idea is that red light can travel,

2:42:57.340 --> 2:42:59.880
 the photon and energy is such that it can travel down

2:42:59.880 --> 2:43:02.820
 through the deep layers of the dermis of the skin.

2:43:02.820 --> 2:43:06.180
 I don't have a red light in my sauna.

2:43:06.180 --> 2:43:09.940
 I don't know if it's essential or not.

2:43:09.940 --> 2:43:11.460
 I don't think so based on all the studies

2:43:11.460 --> 2:43:12.300
 I've talked about.

2:43:12.300 --> 2:43:13.460
 I think that would be as-

2:43:13.460 --> 2:43:17.760
 The potential effect on mitochondria is interesting.

2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:21.980
 I do think there's a lack of really good solid evidence

2:43:21.980 --> 2:43:25.820
 in humans, but that might only be

2:43:25.820 --> 2:43:27.740
 because it's just not studied enough,

2:43:27.740 --> 2:43:29.080
 and that's usually the case.

2:43:29.080 --> 2:43:32.260
 So perhaps like there's the Juve, right?

2:43:32.260 --> 2:43:34.860
 The Juve, they have those red light panels and stuff.

2:43:34.860 --> 2:43:38.380
 Juve and Cozy are the two ones I know, K-O-Z and Juve.

2:43:38.380 --> 2:43:40.260
 They're, as far as I know,

2:43:40.260 --> 2:43:41.760
 I'm probably going to insult both companies

2:43:41.760 --> 2:43:43.360
 at the same time, but I'd rather insult them both

2:43:43.360 --> 2:43:47.020
 at the same time than just compliment one or insult one.

2:43:47.020 --> 2:43:48.580
 Both of them seem excellent

2:43:48.580 --> 2:43:50.500
 for getting the appropriate wavelengths of red light,

2:43:50.500 --> 2:43:52.220
 and I do not have a relationship to either of those.

2:43:52.220 --> 2:43:55.500
 Yeah, well, I personally think that the sauna

2:43:55.500 --> 2:43:57.400
 in and of itself, it's about the heat stress.

2:43:57.400 --> 2:43:59.300
 And typically the question I get

2:43:59.300 --> 2:44:02.220
 is infrared sauna or regular sauna.

2:44:02.220 --> 2:44:04.360
 And there are some differences as well.

2:44:04.360 --> 2:44:06.860
 Infrared saunas, maybe the infrared saunas

2:44:06.860 --> 2:44:07.900
 are the ones that have the red light

2:44:07.900 --> 2:44:09.060
 that you're talking about.

2:44:09.060 --> 2:44:10.980
 Infrared saunas only get up to around

2:44:10.980 --> 2:44:13.900
 140 degrees Fahrenheit.

2:44:13.900 --> 2:44:17.220
 So as I mentioned, the studies were about 174 degrees

2:44:17.220 --> 2:44:21.300
 Fahrenheit, and so you really have to stay

2:44:21.300 --> 2:44:22.820
 in a longer period of time.

2:44:22.820 --> 2:44:26.100
 However, there have been some studies coming out of Japan.

2:44:26.100 --> 2:44:29.420
 They use infrared sauna.

2:44:29.420 --> 2:44:30.340
 They have this whole protocol.

2:44:30.340 --> 2:44:31.940
 It's called Weigh On Therapy,

2:44:31.940 --> 2:44:35.140
 and they get people in infrared saunas,

2:44:35.140 --> 2:44:36.660
 and then they wrap them in a towel,

2:44:36.660 --> 2:44:38.980
 and they stay warm for X amount.

2:44:38.980 --> 2:44:42.260
 So the whole protocol ends up being like an hour long.

2:44:42.260 --> 2:44:44.260
 Again, it's 140 degrees Fahrenheit,

2:44:44.260 --> 2:44:46.180
 so it's an infrared sauna, and it's been shown

2:44:46.180 --> 2:44:50.180
 to improve a variety of coronary heart disease

2:44:50.180 --> 2:44:52.180
 and heart-related conditions.

2:44:52.180 --> 2:44:53.620
 There have been some improvements.

2:44:53.620 --> 2:44:56.840
 So obviously there's evidence that infrared saunas

2:44:56.840 --> 2:44:59.500
 can be beneficial for cardiovascular health.

2:44:59.500 --> 2:45:03.100
 I've used infrared saunas many times at my in-laws.

2:45:03.100 --> 2:45:05.200
 They have an infrared sauna, and I have to crank

2:45:05.200 --> 2:45:07.660
 that thing up for a while until it's maxed.

2:45:07.660 --> 2:45:11.060
 And then I have to sit in there for an hour at least.

2:45:11.060 --> 2:45:13.060
 I do sweat a lot, and that's another thing

2:45:13.060 --> 2:45:13.900
 we didn't talk about.

2:45:13.900 --> 2:45:15.580
 You do sweat some heavy metals,

2:45:15.580 --> 2:45:19.940
 and some heavy metals are excreted predominantly

2:45:19.940 --> 2:45:22.340
 through sweat and others through urine.

2:45:22.340 --> 2:45:26.920
 So for example, cadmium, there's like 125-fold increase

2:45:26.920 --> 2:45:30.660
 in cadmium excretion from sweat when you get in the sauna.

2:45:30.660 --> 2:45:34.760
 Also lead is something like 17-fold excretions higher.

2:45:34.760 --> 2:45:36.020
 Another one is aluminum.

2:45:36.020 --> 2:45:37.220
 It's about four-fold higher.

2:45:37.220 --> 2:45:39.620
 So infrared, you do sweat a lot too,

2:45:39.620 --> 2:45:41.300
 and that's because the main difference

2:45:41.300 --> 2:45:43.700
 is that you're heating your body up

2:45:43.700 --> 2:45:47.860
 through thermal radiation versus the ambient air.

2:45:47.860 --> 2:45:50.880
 Like a standard sauna is a heater,

2:45:50.880 --> 2:45:52.100
 and the heater's heating up the air,

2:45:52.100 --> 2:45:54.340
 and that's how you're heating yourself up.

2:45:54.340 --> 2:45:56.460
 So it is a little bit of a different mechanism.

2:45:56.460 --> 2:45:58.500
 I prefer regular saunas.

2:45:58.500 --> 2:46:01.520
 Most of the data out there is from the heat stress itself,

2:46:01.520 --> 2:46:03.780
 like your heart rate's elevating when you're in there.

2:46:03.780 --> 2:46:04.620
 You're feeling hot.

2:46:04.620 --> 2:46:05.660
 You're getting that cardiovascular.

2:46:05.660 --> 2:46:07.900
 I mean, that's what you're feeling when you're in a hot sauna

2:46:07.900 --> 2:46:10.300
 and that, for me, takes a really long time

2:46:10.300 --> 2:46:13.060
 in the infrared sauna to get at the very end.

2:46:13.060 --> 2:46:15.060
 But I do think there are some benefits from infrared,

2:46:15.060 --> 2:46:16.520
 and they are more affordable.

2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:18.140
 They're less of a fire hazard.

2:46:18.140 --> 2:46:20.020
 But again, hot baths are, I think,

2:46:20.020 --> 2:46:23.340
 a good alternative modality for heat stress

2:46:23.340 --> 2:46:25.620
 compared to like a regular sauna.

2:46:25.620 --> 2:46:27.740
 Great, that's a really helpful answer.

2:46:27.740 --> 2:46:30.940
 Like I said, I use the red light, but not in the sauna,

2:46:30.940 --> 2:46:32.820
 and thank you for reminding us

2:46:32.820 --> 2:46:35.760
 of that 174-degree Fahrenheit threshold

2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:38.960
 that was mainly used in all these studies.

2:46:38.960 --> 2:46:40.940
 So we covered a lot of territory,

2:46:40.940 --> 2:46:42.800
 but I just want to thank you again.

2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:45.180
 It was extremely thorough and extremely informative.

2:46:45.180 --> 2:46:48.740
 I now have, my notes always look a little bit

2:46:48.740 --> 2:46:51.500
 like they were drawn out by a macaque monkey

2:46:51.500 --> 2:46:53.160
 who has no knowledge of the English language,

2:46:53.160 --> 2:46:55.300
 but I can decipher this to tell you

2:46:55.300 --> 2:46:59.300
 that there are at least 10 additions

2:46:59.300 --> 2:47:01.500
 to my current protocols that I'm going to add,

2:47:01.500 --> 2:47:03.300
 and I'll have lots of questions.

2:47:03.300 --> 2:47:04.940
 So I apologize in advance for that.

2:47:04.940 --> 2:47:09.940
 But on behalf of the listeners and just directly from me,

2:47:10.060 --> 2:47:11.900
 thank you so much for your time.

2:47:11.900 --> 2:47:13.120
 I learned a ton.

2:47:13.120 --> 2:47:13.960
 My pleasure.

2:47:13.960 --> 2:47:14.780
 Thanks for having me on.

2:47:14.780 --> 2:47:16.060
 It was a really awesome conversation,

2:47:16.060 --> 2:47:17.620
 so I enjoyed it a lot.

2:47:17.620 --> 2:47:18.900
 Let's do it again.

2:47:18.900 --> 2:47:19.940
 Totally.

2:47:19.940 --> 2:47:20.800
 Great.

2:47:20.800 --> 2:47:21.640
 Thank you for joining me

2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:24.220
 for my discussion with Dr. Rhonda Patrick.

2:47:24.220 --> 2:47:26.140
 I hope you found it as interesting

 to be the highest quality supplements available

2:48:41.100 --> 2:48:44.580
 in the specific dosages that match the peer-reviewed science

2:48:44.580 --> 2:48:46.720
 and recommendations made on various episodes

2:48:46.720 --> 2:48:48.500
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:48:48.500 --> 2:48:50.740

 It's Huberman Lab on both Instagram and Twitter.

 There, I teach science and science-based tools,

2:49:13.900 --> 2:49:15.820
 some of which overlap with the content

2:49:15.820 --> 2:49:17.360
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:18.900
 but much of which is distinct

2:49:18.900 --> 2:49:21.260
 from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:49:21.260 --> 2:49:22.580
 Thank you once again for joining me
