00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.880
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:11.880 --> 00:14.960
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.960 --> 00:18.120
 Today, we are talking all about food and the brain.

00:18.120 --> 00:20.080
 We are going to talk about foods that are good

00:20.080 --> 00:22.720
 for your brain in terms of focus,

00:22.720 --> 00:24.560
 in terms of brain health generally,

00:24.560 --> 00:26.500
 and the longevity of your brain,

00:26.500 --> 00:28.600
 your ability to maintain cognition

00:28.600 --> 00:31.000
 and clear thinking over time.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.280
 We are also going to talk about why

00:33.280 --> 00:36.400
 and how you prefer certain foods to others.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.820
 And I'm going to talk about the three major signals

00:38.820 --> 00:42.800
 that combine to drive your food choices.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.160
 I'll give you a little hint of what those are.

00:45.160 --> 00:47.580
 One of those signals comes from your gut

00:47.580 --> 00:49.880
 and is completely subconscious.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.500
 This is not the gut microbiome per se.

00:52.500 --> 00:55.000
 These are neurons in your gut that are sending signals

00:55.000 --> 00:57.160
 to your brain that you are unaware of

00:57.160 --> 00:59.320
 about the nutrient contents of the foods

00:59.320 --> 01:00.480
 that you're eating.

01:00.480 --> 01:04.920
 The second signal is how metabolically accessible

01:04.920 --> 01:07.960
 a given food is, meaning how readily that food

01:07.960 --> 01:10.600
 can be converted into energy that your brain,

01:10.600 --> 01:13.880
 not your body, but that your brain can use.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.200
 And the third signal is perhaps the most interesting one.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.900
 It's the signal of belief.

01:18.900 --> 01:22.320
 It's the signal of what you perceive and believe,

01:22.320 --> 01:24.820
 the food that you're eating to contain,

01:24.820 --> 01:27.520
 and what you think it can do for you health-wise

01:27.520 --> 01:28.920
 and energy-wise.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.180
 And that might sound a little wishy-washy or vague,

01:31.180 --> 01:34.060
 but we're going to provide mechanistic data

01:34.060 --> 01:37.840
 to support the fact that you can change what you eat,

01:37.840 --> 01:42.460
 so much so that you can drive your brain and your body

01:42.460 --> 01:44.860
 to crave foods that are good for you,

01:44.860 --> 01:47.220
 or at least better for you than the foods

01:47.220 --> 01:48.880
 you might currently be eating.

01:48.880 --> 01:52.560
 This is an incredibly powerful mechanism that we all have.

01:52.560 --> 01:55.200
 It's one that I think is very underappreciated.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.880
 And today I'm going to review the data

01:56.880 --> 01:59.440
 from both animal models and fortunately more recently,

01:59.440 --> 02:02.960
 human studies that really do underscore the fact

02:02.960 --> 02:07.360
 that you can control your desire for particular foods.

02:07.360 --> 02:09.560
 Before we dive into today's topic,

02:09.560 --> 02:12.680
 I just want to briefly touch on some key takeaways

02:12.680 --> 02:14.580
 from a previous episode,

02:14.580 --> 02:17.520
 which is the episode on time-restricted feeding,

02:17.520 --> 02:20.160
 also called intermittent fasting.

02:20.160 --> 02:23.440
 The key elements of time-restricted feeding

02:23.440 --> 02:25.940
 that will benefit your health the most

02:25.940 --> 02:29.560
 in terms of weight loss or maintenance, fat loss,

02:29.560 --> 02:33.160
 organ health, quality sleep, and cognition

02:33.160 --> 02:35.240
 are that the feeding window begin

02:35.240 --> 02:38.180
 at least one hour after waking.

02:38.180 --> 02:40.760
 You could push that feeding window out to begin later,

02:40.760 --> 02:43.440
 but at least one hour after waking,

02:43.440 --> 02:48.400
 and that it end at least two and ideally three hours

02:48.400 --> 02:50.520
 before going to sleep.

02:50.520 --> 02:52.960
 Some people can end that feeding window

02:52.960 --> 02:56.280
 much further away from the beginning of sleep,

02:56.280 --> 02:58.860
 meaning they're finishing their last bite of food,

02:58.860 --> 03:00.080
 for instance, at 6 p.m.

03:00.080 --> 03:01.820
 and they're not going to sleep until midnight.

03:01.820 --> 03:04.640
 But many people struggle to get quality sleep

03:04.640 --> 03:07.660
 if that feeding window is set too early

03:07.660 --> 03:09.160
 relative to when they go to sleep.

03:09.160 --> 03:13.540
 So begin the feeding window at least one hour after waking,

03:13.540 --> 03:16.060
 end the feeding window at least two hours

03:16.060 --> 03:17.140
 before going to sleep.

03:17.140 --> 03:21.200
 And a key feature based on the scientific research

03:21.200 --> 03:24.760
 is that the feeding window itself fall more or less

03:24.760 --> 03:29.100
 at the same period of each 24-hour day from day to day,

03:29.100 --> 03:32.540
 meaning if you are going to eat over an eight-hour period,

03:32.540 --> 03:34.240
 that's your feeding window,

03:34.240 --> 03:36.840
 you wouldn't want to start that feeding window

03:36.840 --> 03:39.160
 at 10 a.m. one day and end it at 6 p.m.,

03:39.160 --> 03:42.040
 and then the next day start at noon and end it at 8 p.m.,

03:42.040 --> 03:44.420
 and the next day start it at 2 p.m.

03:44.420 --> 03:46.920
 and end it at 10 p.m. and so forth.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.740
 As much as is reasonably possible,

03:49.740 --> 03:51.760
 if you want to extract the maximum benefit

03:51.760 --> 03:53.360
 from time-restricted feeding,

03:53.360 --> 03:56.440
 the idea is to keep that feeding window

03:56.440 --> 03:59.340
 at more or less the same phase, as it's called,

03:59.340 --> 04:01.220
 of each 24-hour day.

04:01.220 --> 04:03.580
 If it slides around a little bit for social reasons

04:03.580 --> 04:06.520
 or whatever reasons, it doesn't seem to be a big deal,

04:06.520 --> 04:08.600
 but you don't want it sliding around

04:08.600 --> 04:10.800
 by many hours from day to day

04:10.800 --> 04:12.800
 because of the way that that feeding window

04:12.800 --> 04:15.040
 impacts other genes called clock genes

04:15.040 --> 04:18.360
 that regulate a bunch of other processes in the body.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.240
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

04:20.240 --> 04:21.760
 that this podcast is separate

04:21.760 --> 04:24.240
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.360
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:26.360 --> 04:28.640
 to bring zero-cost-to-consumer information

04:28.640 --> 04:30.840
 about science and science-related tools

04:30.840 --> 04:32.320
 to the general public.

04:32.320 --> 04:33.760
 In keeping with that theme,

04:33.760 --> 04:36.780
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:36.780 --> 04:38.960
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.140
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

04:41.140 --> 04:43.920
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.480
 I've spent a career working on the visual system,

04:46.480 --> 04:50.280
 and one of the key problems that Roca sunglasses has solved

04:50.280 --> 04:52.420
 is if you've ever worn sunglasses

04:52.420 --> 04:54.200
 and you've gone from a very bright region

04:54.200 --> 04:56.000
 to, say, a region with shadows,

04:56.000 --> 04:58.340
 oftentimes you have to take the sunglasses off.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.080
 They've designed their sunglasses in a way

05:00.080 --> 05:02.860
 that no matter whether you're standing in the shade

05:02.860 --> 05:05.060
 or in bright sunlight, you will always see things

05:05.060 --> 05:08.160
 with absolute crystal clarity, which is wonderful.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.320
 Their eyeglasses as well are designed

05:10.320 --> 05:12.100
 so that you can move from one region of brightness

05:12.100 --> 05:14.520
 to another without noticing it at all.

05:14.520 --> 05:15.880
 The other thing that's really terrific

05:15.880 --> 05:17.760
 about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:17.760 --> 05:19.220
 is that they are very lightweight.

05:19.220 --> 05:20.360
 Most of the time, you don't even remember

05:20.360 --> 05:21.700
 that they're on your face,

05:21.700 --> 05:23.320
 and you can wear them whether or not

05:23.320 --> 05:25.500
 you're exercising or working

05:25.500 --> 05:28.240
 because they won't slip off even if you get sweaty.

05:29.480 --> 05:30.840
 The other thing that's really wonderful

05:30.840 --> 05:32.640
 is that the aesthetic is terrific.

05:32.640 --> 05:35.560
 Unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses out there

05:35.560 --> 05:37.300
 that make people look like cyborgs,

05:37.300 --> 05:39.480
 or frankly, just look rather strange,

05:39.480 --> 05:42.400
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses have a terrific aesthetic.

05:42.400 --> 05:45.900
 You can wear them to dinner, to work, running, exercising,

05:45.900 --> 05:48.140
 and they'll work for all those situations.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.240
 If you'd like to try Roca, you can go to roca.com,

05:51.240 --> 05:54.780
 that's R-O-K-A.com, and enter the code Huberman

 to save 20% on your first order.

05:57.560 --> 06:00.560
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.700
 Athletic Greens is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink

06:03.700 --> 06:07.140
 that's designed to cover your foundational supplementation

06:07.140 --> 06:08.480
 and health needs.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.920
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,

06:10.920 --> 06:13.560
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

06:13.560 --> 06:15.320
 The reason I started using Athletic Greens

06:15.320 --> 06:17.080
 and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens

06:17.080 --> 06:18.600
 once or twice per day

06:18.600 --> 06:22.200
 is because it covers all of my vitamin mineral basic needs

06:22.200 --> 06:24.340
 and because of the probiotics.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.280
 There's now ample data supporting the fact

06:26.280 --> 06:30.080
 that probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome

06:30.080 --> 06:32.280
 and that the gut microbiome is important

06:32.280 --> 06:35.600
 for keeping inflammation low, which is good,

06:35.600 --> 06:37.560
 as well as for supporting the immune system

06:37.560 --> 06:39.320
 and for supporting brain health

06:39.320 --> 06:41.720
 through the so-called gut-brain axis.

06:41.720 --> 06:43.240
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

06:43.240 --> 06:46.200
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

06:46.200 --> 06:48.620
 and if you do that, you can claim a special offer.

06:48.620 --> 06:50.280
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

06:50.280 --> 06:52.740
 so these packs make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

06:52.740 --> 06:55.020
 when you're on the road, in the car, et cetera,

06:55.020 --> 06:58.760
 and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.320
 There's now a lot of data pointing to the fact

07:01.320 --> 07:05.200
 that vitamin D3 and K2 are important for hormonal health,

07:05.200 --> 07:06.880
 for cardiovascular function,

07:06.880 --> 07:09.840
 and so if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

07:09.840 --> 07:10.960
 you'll get the Athletic Greens,

07:10.960 --> 07:12.020
 the five free travel packs,

07:12.020 --> 07:15.180
 and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

07:15.180 --> 07:18.480
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.080
 Headspace is a meditation app

07:20.080 --> 07:23.740
 backed by 25 peer-reviewed published studies.

07:23.740 --> 07:26.040
 I think by now, most people have heard

07:26.040 --> 07:28.000
 of the benefits of meditation,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.000
 reduce stress, improve sleep, better cognition, et cetera.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
 I've been meditating for a long time,

07:34.000 --> 07:37.800
 but I have to admit it's been sort of an on and off thing.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.880
 There are periods of time over the last 10

07:39.880 --> 07:41.920
 or gosh, even 20 or 30 years

07:41.920 --> 07:43.540
 that I've meditated consistently,

07:43.540 --> 07:45.220
 and then I'll stop meditating.

07:45.220 --> 07:46.940
 One of the terrific things about Headspace

07:46.940 --> 07:48.160
 is that it has meditations

07:48.160 --> 07:50.280
 of different duration and different type,

07:50.280 --> 07:53.020
 so I found that as soon as I started using Headspace,

07:53.020 --> 07:55.960
 that I was meditating far more consistently.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.760
 One of the great things about meditation

07:57.760 --> 08:01.100
 is that it works the first time and it works every time,

08:01.100 --> 08:03.520
 and the more consistently I do it,

08:03.520 --> 08:06.340
 the more positive benefits I seem to derive.

08:06.340 --> 08:07.560
 If you'd like to try Headspace,

08:07.560 --> 08:10.720
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer,

08:10.720 --> 08:13.600
 and if you do that, you'll get a free one month trial

08:13.600 --> 08:16.880
 with all of Headspace's full library of meditations.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.280
 This is the best deal offer by Headspace right now,

08:19.280 --> 08:20.520
 so if you're interested,

08:20.520 --> 08:23.520
 go to headspace.com slash special offer.

08:23.520 --> 08:24.920
 I'd like to point you toward what I think

08:24.920 --> 08:28.520
 is a very valuable zero-cost resource online.

08:28.520 --> 08:31.400
 Recently, I took part in an event called

08:31.400 --> 08:34.480
 Rethink Education that was put on by Logitech,

08:34.480 --> 08:36.800
 and there I gave a 20-minute lecture

08:36.800 --> 08:39.200
 where I describe the classic

08:39.200 --> 08:42.080
 and modern neuroplasticity literature

08:42.080 --> 08:44.120
 in both animal models and humans.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.960
 The neuroplasticity literature is, of course,

08:45.960 --> 08:48.680
 the literature that describes how to rewire the brain

08:48.680 --> 08:50.600
 in order to learn.

08:50.600 --> 08:52.880
 During that 20-minute talk, I described that literature,

08:52.880 --> 08:55.000
 but I also spell out what I call

08:55.000 --> 08:57.160
 the neuroplasticity super protocol,

08:57.160 --> 08:59.920
 which is nine plus steps of things

08:59.920 --> 09:02.200
 that teachers can apply in the classroom

09:02.200 --> 09:03.920
 to teach any sort of information,

09:03.920 --> 09:06.860
 music, math, sports, anything,

09:06.860 --> 09:09.240
 and that students of any kind in any age

09:09.240 --> 09:12.240
 can use to enhance the speed and depth of learning.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.640
 You can find that talk on YouTube

09:14.640 --> 09:17.620
 by following the link in the caption to this episode,

09:17.620 --> 09:19.120
 or by simply going to YouTube

09:19.120 --> 09:22.160
 and entering the search terms Logitech Huberman.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.800
 Some of the most frequent questions I get

09:23.800 --> 09:26.320
 are about food and the brain.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.640
 Everybody seems to want to know what they should eat

09:28.640 --> 09:30.160
 and what they shouldn't eat

09:30.160 --> 09:32.080
 in order to have peak brain function,

09:32.080 --> 09:35.580
 to be able to focus and memorize things and so forth,

09:35.580 --> 09:38.380
 and in order to maintain brain health over time,

09:38.380 --> 09:40.600
 because nobody wants to lose their memory

09:40.600 --> 09:43.160
 or have troubles with cognition.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.320
 Fortunately, there are a lot of data now

09:45.320 --> 09:48.500
 from really good quality peer-reviewed studies

09:48.500 --> 09:50.800
 that indicate certain things that we can do,

09:50.800 --> 09:53.240
 including certain foods that we should eat,

09:53.240 --> 09:55.660
 and perhaps even some foods that we should avoid

09:55.660 --> 09:58.360
 in order to enhance our brain function.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.720
 And of course, when I say brain,

09:59.720 --> 10:01.700
 what I really mean is nervous system function,

10:01.700 --> 10:05.880
 because how we are able to move and remember things, et cetera

10:05.880 --> 10:07.480
 doesn't just depend on the neurons,

10:07.480 --> 10:08.780
 the nerve cells that are in our head,

10:08.780 --> 10:11.000
 it also depends on our spinal cord

10:11.000 --> 10:13.860
 and the neurons that connect to all the organs of our body.

10:13.860 --> 10:17.360
 So in general, there are two categories of things

10:17.360 --> 10:19.680
 that are going to improve brain health

10:19.680 --> 10:22.000
 from the perspective of nutrition.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.280
 The first category is the general category

10:25.280 --> 10:27.080
 of things that we eat and avoid

10:27.080 --> 10:29.360
 and things that we do and avoid doing

10:29.360 --> 10:32.180
 that will modulate brain health and function.

10:32.180 --> 10:33.600
 What do I mean by modulate?

10:33.600 --> 10:37.320
 Well, getting quality sleep on a regular basis,

10:38.180 --> 10:40.560
 making sure that you're socially connected,

10:40.560 --> 10:42.680
 making sure that you're not depressed.

10:42.680 --> 10:44.360
 All these things are vitally important

10:44.360 --> 10:45.560
 to our overall health,

10:45.560 --> 10:47.720
 and of course they will impact brain function,

10:47.720 --> 10:50.440
 but they do it more or less indirectly, okay?

10:50.440 --> 10:52.020
 There are a few things that happen in sleep

10:52.020 --> 10:56.100
 which directly benefit brain function and repair, et cetera.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.840
 But today I really want to concentrate

10:57.840 --> 11:00.840
 not on the things that modulate our overall health,

11:00.840 --> 11:04.640
 but rather the things that mediate brain health directly,

11:04.640 --> 11:05.840
 and in particular,

11:05.840 --> 11:08.680
 how certain foods enhance brain function.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.320
 And we are going to talk about

11:10.320 --> 11:12.720
 how we can change our relationship to food,

11:12.720 --> 11:15.760
 literally how we can start to prefer certain foods

11:15.760 --> 11:18.340
 that are better for us than others.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.940
 So just briefly,

11:19.940 --> 11:22.080
 I want to touch on the modulatory components

11:22.080 --> 11:24.040
 because they are vital.

11:24.040 --> 11:28.000
 First of all, getting quality sleep on a regular basis

11:28.000 --> 11:30.440
 and ample sleep on a regular basis

11:30.440 --> 11:34.720
 is the foundation of all mental health and physical health.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.320
 There's no question about that.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.040
 We have done several episodes,

11:38.040 --> 11:40.320
 including the Master Your Sleep episode,

11:40.320 --> 11:42.720
 which is episode two of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

11:42.720 --> 11:44.620
 and we've done a lot of other episodes

11:44.620 --> 11:47.780
 that are all about sleep and how to get better at sleeping.

11:47.780 --> 11:50.440
 So I just want to make crystal clear

11:50.440 --> 11:53.480
 that unless you're sleeping well on a regular basis,

11:53.480 --> 11:54.560
 your brain will suffer.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.740
 You won't be able to focus very well, learn very well,

11:56.740 --> 12:00.520
 and indeed there are data linking poor quality sleep

12:00.520 --> 12:04.820
 to dementia or at least exacerbating preexisting dementias

12:04.820 --> 12:05.660
 and things of that sort.

12:05.660 --> 12:07.280
 So get your sleep in order.

12:07.280 --> 12:10.880
 The other, of course, is cardiovascular health and exercise.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.840
 The general prescription that's out there in the literature

12:13.840 --> 12:15.400
 and I think is well-supported

12:15.400 --> 12:19.080
 is to get somewhere between 150 and 180 minutes

12:19.080 --> 12:21.200
 of cardiovascular exercise per week.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.540
 If you choose to also use resistance exercise, that's great,

12:24.540 --> 12:28.720
 but the 150 to 180 minutes minimum per week

12:28.720 --> 12:32.800
 of cardiovascular exercise is crucial for heart health

12:32.800 --> 12:35.440
 and heart health directly relates to brain health

12:35.440 --> 12:38.640
 because the brain consumes a lot of oxygen, glucose,

12:38.640 --> 12:41.520
 and other factors that are delivered via the blood.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.560
 So if your arteries are clogged up

12:43.560 --> 12:46.380
 and you've got poor vascular supply to the brain

12:46.380 --> 12:49.260
 in any region of the brain, your brain will suffer.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.400
 So get cardiovascular health in order.

12:52.320 --> 12:56.640
 Now, with those two modulatory elements set forth

12:56.640 --> 12:58.060
 so that we're all aware that they're there

12:58.060 --> 12:59.480
 and they are vitally important,

12:59.480 --> 13:02.160
 now I'd like to turn to the elements that have been shown

13:02.160 --> 13:04.960
 to be vitally important for directly controlling,

13:04.960 --> 13:07.260
 for mediating neuron function.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.600
 Neurons, of course, are nerve cells in the brain

13:09.600 --> 13:11.960
 and there are other cell types too, of course,

13:11.960 --> 13:13.960
 that will impact brain function.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.360
 The most prominent of which are the so-called glia.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.760
 Glia means glue, but even though for a long time

13:20.760 --> 13:21.660
 people thought that these cells

13:21.660 --> 13:23.560
 were just kind of holding things together passively,

13:23.560 --> 13:27.920
 the glia play a very active role in the metabolism neurons,

13:27.920 --> 13:31.100
 in brain function, and probably also in cognition,

13:31.100 --> 13:33.360
 in thinking and so forth.

13:33.360 --> 13:37.020
 So what are the things that directly impact brain health

13:37.020 --> 13:38.840
 and what are the foods that we can eat

13:38.840 --> 13:40.680
 that will support brain health?

13:40.680 --> 13:42.680
 Generally, when we think about neuron function

13:42.680 --> 13:46.940
 and brain function, we default to a discussion about fuel.

13:46.940 --> 13:50.920
 The fact that neurons use glucose, which is blood sugar,

13:50.920 --> 13:52.720
 and that they require a lot of it.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.560
 In some cases, they'll use ketones,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.200
 which we will talk about a little bit later,

13:56.200 --> 13:58.440
 especially in people that are following a low carbohydrate

13:58.440 --> 14:00.440
 or ketogenic diet.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.880
 But before we can even consider the fuels that neurons use

14:03.880 --> 14:07.400
 in order to function, we have to talk about the elements

14:07.400 --> 14:09.640
 that actually allow those neurons to be there

14:09.640 --> 14:12.760
 and to stay healthy, what actually makes up those neurons.

14:12.760 --> 14:14.680
 And that brings us to what I would argue

14:14.680 --> 14:19.400
 is the most important food element for brain function.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.200
 And that is fat.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.840
 And that might come as a surprise,

14:22.840 --> 14:26.100
 but unless one considers the water content of the brain,

14:26.100 --> 14:29.560
 which is very high, a lot of our brain

14:29.560 --> 14:31.780
 and a lot of the integrity of the nerve cells,

14:31.780 --> 14:33.840
 the so-called neurons in our brain,

14:33.840 --> 14:36.920
 and the other types of cells comes from fat.

14:36.920 --> 14:39.840
 And that's because nerve cells and other cells in the brain

14:39.840 --> 14:42.800
 have a external layer.

14:42.800 --> 14:46.560
 It's what's sometimes called a double-layered membrane.

14:46.560 --> 14:48.280
 It's essentially two thin layers

14:48.280 --> 14:50.160
 that serve as a boundary between those cells.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.680
 And that boundary is very important

14:51.680 --> 14:54.220
 because how things pass across that boundary

14:54.220 --> 14:57.560
 actually regulates the electrical activity of neurons,

14:57.560 --> 14:59.880
 which is the way that neurons fire and communicate

14:59.880 --> 15:01.120
 and keep you thinking and acting

15:01.120 --> 15:02.040
 and doing all the good things

15:02.040 --> 15:04.240
 that those neurons allow us to do.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.800
 And those membranes are made up of fats,

15:06.800 --> 15:08.040
 but they're not made up of the fats

15:08.040 --> 15:10.240
 that are around our belly,

15:10.240 --> 15:11.960
 around the other organs of our body.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.600
 They're not made up of storage fat.

15:13.600 --> 15:16.360
 They are made up of structural fat

15:16.360 --> 15:18.360
 and maintaining the so-called integrity

15:18.360 --> 15:19.840
 of that structural fat,

15:19.840 --> 15:21.960
 meaning the health of those neurons

15:21.960 --> 15:25.800
 is going to come in large part from the foods that we eat.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.960
 Now, this needs to be underscored.

15:27.960 --> 15:30.040
 What I'm saying is that the foods that we eat

15:30.040 --> 15:32.040
 actually provide the structural basis,

15:32.040 --> 15:34.120
 the building blocks of the very neurons

15:34.120 --> 15:36.640
 that allow us to think over time.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.440
 And as I mentioned earlier,

15:38.440 --> 15:40.880
 the fat that makes up those neurons and other nerve cells

15:40.880 --> 15:44.160
 is different than the other types of fat in the body.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.720
 So what type of fat is it and what should we eat

15:46.720 --> 15:50.520
 in order to support that fat and those neurons?

15:50.520 --> 15:53.280
 And the answer is the so-called essential fatty acids

15:53.280 --> 15:54.780
 and phospholipids.

15:54.780 --> 15:56.400
 Now, those are more or less the same thing,

15:56.400 --> 15:58.840
 but I just want to make a very large literature

15:58.840 --> 16:01.000
 very crystal clear.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.800
 Essential fatty acids can include the so-called EPA variety

16:04.800 --> 16:06.400
 or DHA variety.

16:06.400 --> 16:09.060
 You hear about omega-3s and omega-6s.

16:09.060 --> 16:12.480
 Most people are getting enough omega-6s from their diet.

16:12.480 --> 16:13.720
 Not everybody, but most people

16:13.720 --> 16:15.240
 are getting enough omega-6s.

16:15.240 --> 16:19.240
 However, most people are not getting enough omega-3s

16:19.240 --> 16:21.360
 in their diet to support healthy brain function

16:21.360 --> 16:23.000
 in the short and long term.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.720
 I've talked before about the benefits

16:24.720 --> 16:28.240
 of elevating the levels of omega-3s in one's diet

16:28.240 --> 16:31.840
 for sake of offsetting depression and for enhancing mood.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.360
 And indeed there's a wealth of literature now

16:34.360 --> 16:37.960
 pointing to the fact that ingesting at least one or two

16:37.960 --> 16:42.120
 or even three grams per day of EPA form

16:42.120 --> 16:45.200
 of essential fatty acid can have effects,

16:45.200 --> 16:47.200
 positive effects on mood and wellbeing

16:47.200 --> 16:48.280
 that are at least on par

16:48.280 --> 16:50.560
 with some of the major antidepressant treatments out there,

16:50.560 --> 16:52.620
 but without similar side effects

16:52.620 --> 16:54.160
 to those antidepressant treatments.

16:54.160 --> 16:57.880
 And that for people that are already taking antidepressants

16:57.880 --> 17:02.400
 that supplementing with one to two to three grams of EPA,

17:02.400 --> 17:05.880
 essential fatty acids can actually allow a lower dose

17:05.880 --> 17:08.000
 of antidepressant treatment to be used

17:08.000 --> 17:09.340
 and still be effective.

17:09.340 --> 17:10.940
 So that's depression,

17:10.940 --> 17:13.820
 but just in terms of maintaining normal cognitive function

17:13.820 --> 17:15.040
 in people that aren't depressed,

17:15.040 --> 17:19.240
 the EPAs and omega-3s seem to play a very important role.

17:19.240 --> 17:23.200
 Of course, you can supplement EPAs through various fish oils

17:23.200 --> 17:26.260
 and it could be liquid fish oil or capsule fish oil.

17:26.260 --> 17:29.060
 Some people, if they're not interested in eating fish

17:29.060 --> 17:31.920
 for whatever reason, they're allergic or for ethical reasons

17:31.920 --> 17:33.200
 they can take krill oil.

17:33.200 --> 17:34.760
 And if they don't want to use krill oil,

17:34.760 --> 17:37.680
 they can use algae and other forms of EPA.

17:37.680 --> 17:42.440
 However, I think it's clear that one can get a lot of EPA

17:42.440 --> 17:43.840
 from the proper foods.

17:43.840 --> 17:46.780
 And it turns out that those foods, not surprisingly,

17:46.780 --> 17:49.320
 don't just contain high levels of EPA,

17:49.320 --> 17:51.120
 but they also contain other things

17:51.120 --> 17:52.980
 that are beneficial for brain health.

17:52.980 --> 17:55.880
 So what are foods that are high in omega-3s

17:55.880 --> 17:58.000
 that we should all probably be consuming,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.760
 at least on a daily basis?

18:00.980 --> 18:03.360
 The number one is fish.

18:03.360 --> 18:07.120
 So things like mackerel and salmon and herring and oysters

18:07.120 --> 18:09.320
 and sardines and anchovies,

18:09.320 --> 18:12.240
 and perhaps the heavyweight champion of EPAs

18:12.240 --> 18:14.240
 per unit volume is caviar.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.640
 Now, I don't know about you,

18:15.640 --> 18:17.420
 but I'm not eating a lot of fish.

18:17.420 --> 18:19.560
 I'm not eating a lot of caviar.

18:19.560 --> 18:22.100
 I don't think, I can't remember the last time I had a caviar

18:22.100 --> 18:24.560
 unless it was sprinkled on a little bit of sushi.

18:24.560 --> 18:27.520
 I'm not a big fish eater personally.

18:27.520 --> 18:28.900
 I will from time to time,

18:28.900 --> 18:32.200
 but that's one reason why one might want to supplement

18:32.200 --> 18:34.640
 with EPAs from another source.

18:34.640 --> 18:39.600
 But also EPAs are found in chia seeds, in walnuts,

18:39.600 --> 18:41.980
 in soybeans and other plant-based foods.

18:41.980 --> 18:44.920
 You can look these up online and you'll immediately see

18:44.920 --> 18:47.540
 that there are a lot of sources of EPAs.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.760
 And many of the foods that I listed off

18:49.760 --> 18:51.040
 might be appetizing to you.

18:51.040 --> 18:52.760
 Some of them might be unappetizing to you,

18:52.760 --> 18:55.200
 or some of them you might be sort of neutral about,

18:55.200 --> 18:57.360
 but it's very clear that eating foods

18:57.360 --> 18:59.520
 that are rich in omega-3s and or supplementing

18:59.520 --> 19:02.880
 with omega-3s to get above that 1.5 grams,

19:02.880 --> 19:07.080
 and ideally up to two or even three grams per day of EPA,

19:07.080 --> 19:10.240
 can be very beneficial for cognitive function

19:10.240 --> 19:12.520
 in the short and long term.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.520
 Later in the episode, I'm going to talk about

19:14.520 --> 19:17.000
 how to actually change your relationship

19:17.000 --> 19:18.560
 to particular foods so that foods

19:18.560 --> 19:19.720
 that you don't particularly like,

19:19.720 --> 19:21.840
 you can actually start to like more.

19:21.840 --> 19:23.560
 And that might be important for those of you

19:23.560 --> 19:25.600
 that are thinking mackerel, sardines.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.740
 I mean, I'm making this face because frankly,

19:27.740 --> 19:30.300
 those are not foods that I naturally like.

19:30.300 --> 19:31.740
 But again, I want to emphasize

19:31.740 --> 19:34.480
 that you don't have to consume fish and animal products

19:34.480 --> 19:35.880
 in order to get sufficient EPAs.

19:35.880 --> 19:37.120
 You can get them from plants,

19:37.120 --> 19:41.240
 but I do believe based on the quality peer-reviewed research

19:41.240 --> 19:43.000
 that everybody should be striving

19:43.000 --> 19:45.800
 to get a minimum threshold of at least a gram and a half

19:45.800 --> 19:48.360
 of EPAs per day, one way or the other.

19:48.360 --> 19:49.880
 The great thing about omega-3s

19:49.880 --> 19:51.920
 is that they are also thought to be beneficial

19:51.920 --> 19:53.680
 for things like cardiovascular health.

19:53.680 --> 19:56.000
 And although there's some controversy there

19:56.000 --> 19:59.520
 as to whether or not two grams or three grams or six grams

19:59.520 --> 20:00.960
 is ideal for cardiovascular health,

20:00.960 --> 20:03.280
 I think the bulk of evidence points to the fact

20:03.280 --> 20:05.220
 that getting sufficient omega-3s in the diet

20:05.220 --> 20:07.760
 is going to support cardiovascular health.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.540
 Certainly not the only thing people should be doing

20:09.540 --> 20:11.480
 to support their cardiovascular health,

20:11.480 --> 20:14.640
 aerobic exercise and so forth being important also,

20:14.640 --> 20:17.640
 but it does seem to support cardiovascular health

20:17.640 --> 20:20.120
 and in doing so, supporting brain health.

20:20.120 --> 20:25.120
 However, what I'm emphasizing is ingestion of omega-3s

20:25.120 --> 20:27.760
 to support the very cells within the brain

20:27.760 --> 20:29.000
 that make up our cognition,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.660
 that allow for cognition and for movement and memory

20:31.660 --> 20:35.000
 and all the other marvelous things that the brain does.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.680
 The other compound that has been shown

20:36.680 --> 20:39.500
 to be directly supportive of neuronal function

20:39.500 --> 20:41.460
 is phosphatidylserine,

20:41.460 --> 20:44.900
 which is abundant in meats and in fish.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.800
 So here we are again, back to fish being an important source

20:47.800 --> 20:50.200
 of brain supporting food.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.200
 Phosphatidylserine is something that nowadays

20:53.200 --> 20:54.420
 people are supplementing.

20:54.420 --> 20:59.300
 It's a lipid-like compound that at least in three studies

20:59.300 --> 21:01.020
 have been shown to improve cognition.

21:01.020 --> 21:02.280
 These weren't huge effects,

21:02.280 --> 21:04.680
 but they were statistically significant effects.

21:04.680 --> 21:09.400
 And as well in more than three, at least five studies

21:09.400 --> 21:11.880
 to reduce cognitive decline.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.620
 And this is interesting, in every case,

21:13.620 --> 21:17.500
 it was 300 milligrams supplemented phosphatidylserine,

21:17.500 --> 21:21.120
 but one again, doesn't need to supplement phosphatidylserine.

21:21.120 --> 21:23.220
 Phosphatidylserine can be derived,

21:23.220 --> 21:24.920
 as I mentioned from meats and fish,

21:24.920 --> 21:27.280
 and to some extent from cabbage of all things.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.440
 I don't know how much cabbage people are ingesting,

21:29.440 --> 21:31.060
 but later when we talk about gut health

21:31.060 --> 21:34.400
 and the relationship between gut health and brain health,

21:34.400 --> 21:36.060
 I'll mention fermented foods.

21:36.060 --> 21:36.900
 And of course,

21:36.900 --> 21:40.120
 one of the most readily available fermented foods out there

21:40.120 --> 21:43.720
 that at least many people find appetizing is sauerkraut,

21:43.720 --> 21:46.440
 which is of course made from cabbage, it's fermented cabbage.

21:46.440 --> 21:49.680
 So for those of you that do consume meat and fish,

21:49.680 --> 21:50.880
 provided you're getting enough fish,

21:50.880 --> 21:52.860
 you're probably getting enough phosphatidylserine.

21:52.860 --> 21:54.000
 For those of you that are interested

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
 in supplementing phosphatidylserine

21:56.000 --> 21:57.900
 to get these effects that were reported

21:57.900 --> 22:00.580
 in these various manuscripts,

22:00.580 --> 22:03.040
 which by the way, I've read and looked solid.

22:03.040 --> 22:05.820
 I mean, I don't think we've seen the landmark studies

22:05.820 --> 22:08.000
 showing that supplementing with phosphatidylserine

22:08.000 --> 22:09.580
 at 300 milligrams per day

22:09.580 --> 22:12.640
 is going to create a huge offsetting

22:12.640 --> 22:14.220
 of a massive cognitive decline

22:14.220 --> 22:16.480
 or a massive increase in brain function.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.600
 These seem to be modest effects,

22:18.600 --> 22:20.640
 but the effects do appear to be real.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.080
 And for those of you that are interested

22:22.080 --> 22:23.920
 in supplementing with phosphatidylserine,

22:23.920 --> 22:25.960
 it's a relatively inexpensive supplement

22:25.960 --> 22:27.680
 that again is lipid-like.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.380
 So it's mimicking some of the same things

22:29.380 --> 22:32.580
 that you would get from food, but in higher concentration.

22:32.580 --> 22:37.580
 Now, after EPA, fatty acids and phosphatidylserine,

22:38.080 --> 22:41.720
 I would say third on the list of things that come from food

22:41.720 --> 22:45.400
 that can readily support brain function would be choline.

22:45.400 --> 22:47.680
 And that's because of the relationship to choline

22:47.680 --> 22:51.160
 in the biosynthesis pathway for acetylcholine.

22:51.160 --> 22:54.400
 Acetylcholine is a neuromodulator, not a neurotransmitter,

22:54.400 --> 22:56.680
 but a neuromodulator in the brain.

22:56.680 --> 23:00.220
 A neuromodulator is a chemical that modulates

23:00.220 --> 23:02.480
 the function of many brain circuits

23:02.480 --> 23:04.680
 and also circuits within the body.

23:04.680 --> 23:06.400
 I'll mention what those are in a moment,

23:06.400 --> 23:09.640
 but acetylcholine as a neuromodulator

23:09.640 --> 23:13.000
 tends to enhance the activity, the electrical activity

23:13.000 --> 23:15.700
 and chemical activity of certain sets of neurons

23:15.700 --> 23:18.720
 and downplay the activity of other neurons.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.680
 So it's sort of a conductor of sorts

23:20.680 --> 23:23.520
 leading to enhanced function and activity

23:23.520 --> 23:26.340
 in certain brain areas and circuits and others.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.960
 For instance, the brain areas that are involved

23:29.960 --> 23:31.520
 in focus and alertness.

23:31.520 --> 23:33.920
 We have multiple clusters of neurons in our brain

23:33.920 --> 23:35.840
 that make acetylcholine.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.600
 Two of the most prominent and well-known

23:37.600 --> 23:39.040
 are the so-called nucleus basalis,

23:39.040 --> 23:42.080
 which is a cluster of neurons deep in the basal forebrain

23:42.080 --> 23:44.860
 that highlight particular areas of our brain,

23:44.860 --> 23:47.660
 highlight meaning when acetylcholine is released

23:47.660 --> 23:49.840
 from those neurons at their nerve endings

23:49.840 --> 23:50.960
 in particular areas of the brain,

23:50.960 --> 23:52.680
 those particular areas of the brain

23:52.680 --> 23:54.720
 can undergo enhanced levels of activity

23:54.720 --> 23:56.260
 relative to surrounding area.

23:56.260 --> 23:59.120
 So it's kind of a electrical highlighter pen, if you will,

23:59.120 --> 24:00.040
 by analogy.

24:01.680 --> 24:05.360
 That is the basis of much of what we call focus

24:05.360 --> 24:08.640
 or our ability to concentrate on a particular batch

24:08.640 --> 24:10.440
 of information that's coming in through our eyes,

24:10.440 --> 24:11.280
 our ears, our nose,

24:11.280 --> 24:13.520
 or even things that we're just thinking in our head.

24:13.520 --> 24:17.600
 So having ample choline for production of acetylcholine

24:17.600 --> 24:21.200
 allows for focus through, of course, many intervening steps.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.960
 There are also regions of the brain

24:22.960 --> 24:25.220
 in the so-called back of the brain, the hindbrain,

24:25.220 --> 24:27.040
 that release acetylcholine

24:27.040 --> 24:30.200
 that are involved in general states of alertness.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.460
 And not surprisingly then,

24:32.460 --> 24:34.920
 many of the treatments for Alzheimer's disease,

24:34.920 --> 24:37.480
 which is an inability or challenges

24:37.480 --> 24:40.160
 with remembering things and focusing

24:40.160 --> 24:44.160
 are drugs that impact the acetylcholine pathway

24:44.160 --> 24:47.520
 and are aimed at enhancing the amount of acetylcholine

24:47.520 --> 24:49.500
 that's available to neurons.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.740
 And it can do that through a number of different mechanisms.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.800
 You can do that by enhancing the amount of acetylcholine

24:53.800 --> 24:54.840
 that's created,

24:54.840 --> 24:57.560
 or you can do that by taking a drug

24:57.560 --> 24:59.840
 that can reduce the amount of enzyme

24:59.840 --> 25:01.200
 that gobbles up the acetylcholine

25:01.200 --> 25:04.280
 and in doing so leading to more net acetylcholine.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.360
 But outside of the scenario

25:06.360 --> 25:09.360
 where somebody has cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's,

25:09.360 --> 25:13.000
 all of us are able to focus to some degree or not,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.780
 or are able to be alert to some degree or not

25:15.780 --> 25:18.960
 based on the amount of acetylcholine that we have.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.040
 Now, other processes of course are involved,

25:21.040 --> 25:23.640
 but what this means is that making sure

25:23.640 --> 25:25.920
 that we have enough of the substrates

25:25.920 --> 25:27.920
 to create acetylcholine is vital

25:27.920 --> 25:29.480
 if we want to be able to focus.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.720
 And that's why dietary choline is so vital.

25:31.720 --> 25:34.160
 And the primary source for dietary choline

25:34.160 --> 25:36.960
 would be eggs and in particular egg yolks.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.680
 And this again has a very interesting relationship

25:39.680 --> 25:41.080
 to our evolution as well.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.560
 We're always referred to as hunter-gatherers,

25:44.560 --> 25:45.920
 but when one hears hunters,

25:45.920 --> 25:48.520
 we often think about meat and animal sources.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.080
 And indeed, as a species,

25:50.080 --> 25:53.260
 we hunted many, many other species of animals

25:53.260 --> 25:55.220
 to consume them and still do.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.760
 But we also fished, we talked about that earlier

25:57.760 --> 26:01.040
 and consumed a lot of fish and we consumed a lot of eggs.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.800
 Eggs are an incredibly rich source

26:03.800 --> 26:06.820
 of nutrients for the brain.

26:06.820 --> 26:09.760
 And that's because the egg actually,

26:09.760 --> 26:10.600
 if you think about it,

26:10.600 --> 26:12.680
 contains all the nutrients that are required

26:12.680 --> 26:15.620
 in order for an organism to grow.

26:15.620 --> 26:18.960
 A bird that's in a egg shell, it's got the yolk there

26:18.960 --> 26:20.940
 and it's using that yolk for a reason.

26:20.940 --> 26:23.720
 It's using that yolk as a source of fuel.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.800
 It's using that yolk as a source of literally building blocks

26:26.800 --> 26:28.400
 in order to create its nervous system.

26:28.400 --> 26:31.500
 Many years ago, I worked on chick embryos.

26:31.500 --> 26:32.920
 And as these amazing experiments,

26:32.920 --> 26:34.880
 you could actually take an egg

26:34.880 --> 26:37.400
 and you could create a little window in the top.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.960
 And these were fertilized eggs and you'd see over time,

26:39.960 --> 26:42.380
 you could peer in there, literally look in with a microscope

26:42.380 --> 26:43.560
 or even with the naked eye

26:43.560 --> 26:45.840
 and you would see this little chick embryo

26:45.840 --> 26:47.660
 sitting on top of that yolk growing and growing

26:47.660 --> 26:48.500
 and growing and growing

26:48.500 --> 26:50.280
 and the yolk getting smaller and smaller

26:50.280 --> 26:52.040
 is really incredible.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.420
 They're using that as a source

26:53.420 --> 26:55.260
 for all the building blocks of the body,

26:55.260 --> 26:57.480
 but in particular, the nervous system.

26:57.480 --> 26:59.440
 So eggs are a rich source of choline.

26:59.440 --> 27:02.760
 Some people will supplement with choline.

27:02.760 --> 27:06.800
 However, food sources seem to be the best source of choline.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.400
 And as with the EPAs and the omega-3s,

27:09.400 --> 27:12.400
 there are plenty of foods that are non-animal based

27:12.400 --> 27:14.360
 that contain choline.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.520
 So if you're somebody who doesn't eat eggs

27:16.520 --> 27:17.800
 or doesn't want to eat eggs,

27:17.800 --> 27:20.920
 things like potatoes, nuts and seeds and grains and fruit,

27:20.920 --> 27:22.900
 they don't have as much choline as eggs,

27:22.900 --> 27:24.460
 but they do contain choline.

27:24.460 --> 27:26.240
 So you can look up the values of choline

27:26.240 --> 27:29.260
 that are present in those various foods

27:29.260 --> 27:31.000
 and make sure that you're reaching the threshold

27:31.000 --> 27:32.400
 amount of choline for you.

27:32.400 --> 27:34.580
 In general, most people should probably strive

27:34.580 --> 27:36.680
 to get somewhere between 500 milligrams

27:36.680 --> 27:38.620
 and a gram of choline per day.

27:38.620 --> 27:40.200
 So a thousand milligrams.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.240
 And some people rely on supplementation

27:42.240 --> 27:43.840
 in order to hit those levels

27:43.840 --> 27:45.520
 because they're not eating a lot of egg yolks

27:45.520 --> 27:47.940
 or they're not eating a lot of other foods.

27:47.940 --> 27:50.480
 Certain fish contain choline, for instance,

27:50.480 --> 27:52.900
 and the other foods I listed off a few minutes ago

27:52.900 --> 27:54.960
 from plant-based sources.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.680
 So some people will supplement with 50 to 100 milligrams

27:59.680 --> 28:01.760
 or whatever amount is necessary to get them

28:01.760 --> 28:04.680
 up to that one gram or even a two gram dose per day.

28:04.680 --> 28:08.700
 So we have three things that we know can support nerve cells.

28:09.640 --> 28:13.240
 EPA, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,

28:13.240 --> 28:16.240
 phosphatidylserine, and choline.

28:16.240 --> 28:19.680
 Those three things I would list off as the top three things

28:19.680 --> 28:23.880
 for enhancing neuron function and the integrity of neurons

28:23.880 --> 28:25.280
 in the short and long term.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.560
 And this is, again, is setting aside

28:27.560 --> 28:29.880
 the vitally important factors of hydration

28:29.880 --> 28:31.040
 and electrolytes.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.480
 I've said it before on other podcasts,

28:32.480 --> 28:34.800
 but if you're not ingesting enough water

28:34.800 --> 28:36.200
 and you're not getting enough sodium

28:36.200 --> 28:38.160
 and magnesium and potassium,

28:38.160 --> 28:40.080
 then obviously your neurons can't run

28:40.080 --> 28:42.600
 because a lot of the brain is water.

28:42.600 --> 28:44.200
 You need to maintain proper hydration

28:44.200 --> 28:47.000
 and sodium, potassium, and magnesium are important

28:47.000 --> 28:48.320
 in order for nerve cells to function.

28:48.320 --> 28:51.520
 In fact, they are actually the components,

28:51.520 --> 28:54.380
 the ions that pass across those lipid membranes,

28:54.380 --> 28:55.920
 those little fatty membranes

28:55.920 --> 28:57.040
 that we were talking about earlier

28:57.040 --> 28:59.960
 that allow the neurons to generate electrical activity

28:59.960 --> 29:01.520
 and communicate with one another.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.840
 So definitely you want to hydrate enough.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.360
 We will do an entire other episode

29:05.360 --> 29:07.060
 all about hydration and electrolytes,

29:07.060 --> 29:12.060
 but omega-3s, the EPAs, phosphatidylserine, and choline,

29:13.280 --> 29:17.100
 it's obvious, are going to improve brain function.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.600
 How much they will improve brain function

29:18.600 --> 29:19.520
 probably depends on how well

29:19.520 --> 29:20.880
 your brain was working previously.

29:20.880 --> 29:22.880
 In fact, many of the studies that have looked

29:22.880 --> 29:24.460
 at the effectiveness of these compounds

29:24.460 --> 29:26.440
 have looked in people that are suffering from mild

29:26.440 --> 29:28.680
 or even severe cognitive decline.

29:28.680 --> 29:31.920
 And while the outcomes of those studies vary,

29:31.920 --> 29:34.080
 given the interest in maintaining brain function,

29:34.080 --> 29:36.200
 given the fact that we don't make new neurons

29:36.200 --> 29:37.760
 throughout our entire life,

29:37.760 --> 29:40.280
 and given that everybody has to eat,

29:40.280 --> 29:42.080
 these are quality, healthy foods

29:42.080 --> 29:44.800
 that we should all be ingesting anyways,

29:44.800 --> 29:47.460
 and it's clear that they can support brain function

29:47.460 --> 29:48.880
 to some degree or another.

29:48.880 --> 29:53.080
 Many people ask what I do in light of this information.

29:53.080 --> 29:56.160
 And while I can only talk about what works for me,

29:56.160 --> 30:00.080
 I choose to ingest fish oil, mainly in liquid form,

30:00.080 --> 30:02.580
 because that turns out to be the easiest way

30:02.580 --> 30:05.760
 and the most economically affordable way to do it

30:05.760 --> 30:07.280
 for most people.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.760
 So there are various forms of liquid fish oil out there.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.360
 Some of them include some lemon flavoring,

30:11.360 --> 30:12.680
 so it doesn't taste like fish oil,

30:12.680 --> 30:16.000
 because frankly, fish oil to me is sort of noxious tasting.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.920
 And I'll take a tablespoon of that or two per day.

30:19.920 --> 30:22.780
 If I'm traveling, I'll use the capsule form

30:22.780 --> 30:25.160
 in order to hit that threshold of, for me,

30:25.160 --> 30:29.520
 about two, sometimes even three grams per day of EPA.

30:29.520 --> 30:32.400
 So not just two or three grams per day of fish oil,

30:32.400 --> 30:34.640
 but two or three grams per day of EPA.

30:34.640 --> 30:37.080
 Now, if I'm eating fish,

30:37.080 --> 30:39.000
 which as I mentioned earlier is not often,

30:39.000 --> 30:41.040
 then I might reduce the amount of fish oil that I take,

30:41.040 --> 30:43.280
 but that's my major source of fish oil.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.460
 Currently, I do not supplement with phosphatidylserine.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.240
 A number of people that I know and trust,

30:49.240 --> 30:51.440
 and indeed several colleagues of mine

30:51.440 --> 30:53.120
 do take phosphatidylserine.

30:53.120 --> 30:54.400
 I don't have any good explanation

30:54.400 --> 30:56.220
 for why I don't take it yet,

30:56.220 --> 30:58.480
 but I have not tried supplementing with it yet.

30:58.480 --> 30:59.600
 Maybe if some of you have,

30:59.600 --> 31:03.460
 you can place your experience in the comment section.

31:03.460 --> 31:04.600
 That would be of interest.

31:04.600 --> 31:06.600
 And then in terms of choline,

31:06.600 --> 31:08.600
 in order to get choline in my diet,

31:08.600 --> 31:12.060
 I do pay attention to the various foods that contain choline

31:12.060 --> 31:14.840
 and I try and get those foods on a semi-regular basis.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.480
 I do supplement with something called alpha-GPC,

31:18.480 --> 31:21.960
 which is essentially in the acetylcholine pathway

31:21.960 --> 31:23.800
 or biosynthesis pathway.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.240
 I don't take it very often,

31:25.240 --> 31:28.520
 but I will take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC

31:28.520 --> 31:29.360
 from time to time.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.200
 From time to time,

31:30.200 --> 31:33.280
 I mean anywhere from two to three times per week.

31:33.280 --> 31:34.680
 I'll generally do it early in the day

31:34.680 --> 31:35.520
 because it, for me,

31:35.520 --> 31:37.560
 can have a little bit of a stimulant effect,

31:37.560 --> 31:40.040
 although it's not nearly as stimulating, say,

31:40.040 --> 31:42.600
 as a double espresso or triple espresso.

31:42.600 --> 31:46.040
 But that's one way in which I enhance my choline function.

31:46.040 --> 31:48.440
 And some people choose to get it from supplementation

31:48.440 --> 31:50.120
 because it's straightforward.

31:50.120 --> 31:51.280
 There are a lot of supplements out there

31:51.280 --> 31:52.820
 that contain alpha-GPC.

31:52.820 --> 31:54.240
 Some people are taking dosages

31:54.240 --> 31:55.920
 as high as 900 milligrams per day.

31:55.920 --> 31:57.240
 That sounds very high to me.

31:57.240 --> 32:00.160
 The studies of offsetting cognitive decline

32:00.160 --> 32:04.100
 using alpha-GPC did use quite high dosages

32:04.100 --> 32:07.820
 of 600 to 900 or even 1200 milligrams per day.

32:07.820 --> 32:10.880
 So it has been used at those much higher concentrations,

32:10.880 --> 32:13.160
 but because fortunately,

32:13.160 --> 32:15.200
 at least not yet or not to my awareness,

32:15.200 --> 32:17.440
 I'm not suffering from any cognitive decline,

32:17.440 --> 32:20.760
 I will supplement with 300 milligrams every now and again.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.160
 Next on my list of compounds that have been shown

32:23.160 --> 32:24.520
 in peer-reviewed research

32:24.520 --> 32:28.480
 to improve neuronal and brain function is creatine.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.840
 Creatine can be derived from meat sources.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.500
 It can also be supplemented.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.000
 Some of you are probably familiar with creatine

32:36.000 --> 32:37.200
 or have heard about creatine

32:37.200 --> 32:39.840
 from the context of the health and fitness world

32:39.840 --> 32:44.200
 where creatine is used to bring more water into muscles,

32:44.200 --> 32:46.520
 which can enhance the strength of those muscles,

32:46.520 --> 32:49.560
 as well as bring water into other tissues.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.400
 So it doesn't just draw more water into muscle,

32:51.400 --> 32:54.080
 it can draw more water into the body generally.

32:55.660 --> 32:58.080
 Creatine has also been shown to have an important role

32:58.080 --> 32:59.360
 in brain function.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.040
 And once again, this is something that came up

33:01.040 --> 33:04.240
 during the discussion about depression a few episodes back.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.720
 Creatine can actually be used as a fuel source in the brain.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.080
 And there's some evidence that it can enhance the function

33:12.080 --> 33:16.540
 of certain frontal cortical circuits that feed down onto,

33:16.540 --> 33:18.900
 or rather connect to areas of the brain

33:18.900 --> 33:21.160
 that are involved in mood regulation and motivation.

33:21.160 --> 33:25.320
 And that's where creatine plays a role in depression,

33:25.320 --> 33:28.420
 or rather where creatine supplementation

33:28.420 --> 33:32.160
 seems to be able to assist in some forms of mild depression.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.360
 That's an emerging literature.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.280
 It's still not well-established.

33:35.280 --> 33:38.320
 However, there is now ample evidence

33:38.320 --> 33:41.320
 that creatine supplementation can enhance brain function

33:41.320 --> 33:42.720
 in certain contexts.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.000
 And if you're interested in learning more

33:45.000 --> 33:46.560
 about what those contexts are,

33:46.560 --> 33:48.560
 there's an excellent review that just came out,

33:48.560 --> 33:52.440
 the first author is Rochelle, R-O-S-C-H-E-L.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.600
 We will provide a link to this study,

33:54.600 --> 33:58.200
 rather this review, excuse me, in the caption.

33:58.200 --> 34:01.860
 This was published just very recently in 2021.

34:01.860 --> 34:05.400
 And one thing to make clear is that creatine supplementation

34:05.400 --> 34:07.940
 has been shown to be especially useful

34:07.940 --> 34:10.440
 for people that are not consuming any meat

34:10.440 --> 34:13.400
 or other sources of foods that are rich in creatine.

34:13.400 --> 34:15.940
 What is the threshold level of creatine to supplement

34:15.940 --> 34:18.000
 in order to get the cognitive benefit?

34:18.000 --> 34:21.120
 Appears to be at least five grams per day.

34:21.120 --> 34:22.560
 Now, the most typical form of creatine

34:22.560 --> 34:24.240
 is so-called creatine monohydrate.

34:24.240 --> 34:26.320
 There are other forms of creatine as well,

34:26.320 --> 34:28.460
 some of which are thought to not draw as much water

34:28.460 --> 34:30.480
 into non-muscle tissues.

34:30.480 --> 34:32.880
 And for some people that that's attractive to them,

34:32.880 --> 34:35.560
 they don't want water sitting below their skin, et cetera.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.760
 I should emphasize that the responses to creatine

34:37.760 --> 34:39.660
 in that sense can differ.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.680
 Some people get a little bit of water retention.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.520
 Some people experience more.

34:43.520 --> 34:45.880
 There's some evidence that creatine can impact

34:45.880 --> 34:47.060
 some of the hormonal pathways

34:47.060 --> 34:48.240
 that it might enhance levels

34:48.240 --> 34:50.880
 of so-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.520
 And therefore, because DHT is involved in hair loss,

34:53.520 --> 34:56.540
 there are these theories that creatine can cause hair loss.

34:56.540 --> 34:59.000
 And indeed, for people that are very DHT sensitive,

34:59.000 --> 35:00.380
 it might, you know,

35:01.340 --> 35:04.680
 there's going to be a lot of variation person-to-person

35:04.680 --> 35:07.200
 in terms of how much creatine impacts DHT

35:07.200 --> 35:09.600
 and how many DHT receptors they have on their scalp

35:09.600 --> 35:11.580
 and therefore whether or not they experience hair loss.

35:11.580 --> 35:13.060
 I'm just giving you all this information

35:13.060 --> 35:15.040
 so that you're aware of the various things

35:15.040 --> 35:16.500
 that creatine can do.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.440
 But nonetheless, I think it's interesting

35:18.440 --> 35:21.120
 that creatine supplementation of five grams per day,

35:21.120 --> 35:22.640
 that's creatine monohydrate,

35:22.640 --> 35:24.220
 has been shown to improve cognition

35:24.220 --> 35:27.200
 in people that aren't getting creatine from animal sources.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.840
 And there's some evidence detailed within the review

35:31.080 --> 35:32.520
 that I just described

35:32.520 --> 35:35.960
 that creatine supplementation can also enhance cognition

35:35.960 --> 35:40.000
 in people that are also eating animal products.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.880
 So I personally take creatine five grams per day

35:42.880 --> 35:44.560
 and have for a very long time.

35:44.560 --> 35:47.480
 I can't say that I've noticed a tremendous benefit

35:47.480 --> 35:49.880
 because I've actually never really come off it.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.640
 And so I've never done the control experiment.

35:51.640 --> 35:54.480
 I take it more as kind of a baseline insurance policy.

35:54.480 --> 35:57.120
 For me, I'm probably losing,

35:57.120 --> 35:58.520
 I'm certainly losing some of my hair,

35:58.520 --> 36:01.180
 whether or not that's due to creatine or not.

36:01.180 --> 36:03.160
 I've never done the analysis.

36:03.160 --> 36:06.820
 But what I can say is that I generally consume these things

36:06.820 --> 36:11.260
 like EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC,

36:11.260 --> 36:16.260
 to set a general context of support for my neurons,

36:16.300 --> 36:17.280
 for my brain.

36:17.280 --> 36:19.500
 And of course, I also pay attention to the foods

36:19.500 --> 36:21.240
 that contain these various compounds.

36:21.240 --> 36:23.660
 So I don't actively eat additional meat

36:23.660 --> 36:25.960
 just to obtain creatine.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.540
 I eat a fairly limited amount of meat.

36:27.540 --> 36:29.960
 I don't restrict it, and I do eat meat,

36:29.960 --> 36:33.380
 but I don't actively seek out creatine in my diet.

36:33.380 --> 36:34.640
 Rather, I use supplementation

36:34.640 --> 36:37.360
 in order to hit that five grams per day threshold.

36:37.360 --> 36:40.160
 Next on the list of foods that are beneficial

36:40.160 --> 36:42.840
 for brain health is one that you've probably seen pictures

36:42.840 --> 36:45.080
 of online because there seems to be a practice

36:45.080 --> 36:48.760
 of putting pictures of blueberries and other dark berries

36:48.760 --> 36:52.260
 next to any title that says foods that benefit your brain.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.040
 There are a lot of foods out there

36:55.040 --> 36:58.920
 that have been purported to improve brain function.

36:58.920 --> 37:02.240
 The interesting thing about blueberries and other berries,

37:02.240 --> 37:04.600
 blackberries, dark currants,

37:04.600 --> 37:09.600
 any of these thin-skinned berries that are purplish in color

37:09.600 --> 37:12.840
 is that they contain what are called anthocyanins.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.580
 Anthocyanins actually have some really nice data

37:15.580 --> 37:19.000
 to support the fact that they improve brain function.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.980
 Now, whether or not it is direct effects on neurons

37:22.980 --> 37:25.720
 or whether or not it is by lowering inflammation

37:26.820 --> 37:29.960
 or some other modulatory effect isn't quite clear,

37:29.960 --> 37:33.860
 but I think by now there's enough data to support the fact

37:33.860 --> 37:36.920
 that eating a cup or two of blueberries pretty often,

37:36.920 --> 37:39.480
 every day, or maybe you have blackberries

37:39.480 --> 37:40.920
 or maybe it's black currants,

37:40.920 --> 37:43.720
 that these anthocyanins are good for us,

37:43.720 --> 37:46.860
 that they are enhancing our overall wellbeing

37:46.860 --> 37:47.960
 at a number of different levels.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.520
 And just to give you a couple of examples

37:49.520 --> 37:51.840
 of where there are actually peer-reviewed studies

37:51.840 --> 37:53.900
 to support those statements,

37:53.900 --> 37:57.180
 the anthocyanins of which blueberries

37:57.180 --> 38:00.320
 and other dark berries are rich in

38:00.320 --> 38:04.400
 have been shown to reduce the amount of DNA damage,

38:04.400 --> 38:07.560
 has been shown to reduce significantly,

38:07.560 --> 38:11.640
 albeit slightly, excuse me, cognitive decline.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.960
 And that particular study was supplementation

38:13.960 --> 38:16.400
 of a blueberry extract.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.960
 I'll talk about the difference between extract

38:17.960 --> 38:19.360
 and actual blueberries in a moment,

38:19.360 --> 38:22.320
 but supplementation of blueberry extract

38:22.320 --> 38:26.180
 in offsetting cognitive decline in elderly people.

38:26.180 --> 38:29.120
 So, you know, what constitutes elderly

38:29.120 --> 38:32.500
 is always a little bit of a debate and a discussion,

38:32.500 --> 38:35.600
 but in this case, what they did is they supplemented

38:35.600 --> 38:39.480
 with somewhere between 428,

38:39.480 --> 38:41.080
 I don't know why they selected 428,

38:41.080 --> 38:45.520
 and 598 milligrams of anthocyanins daily for 12 weeks

38:45.520 --> 38:46.840
 was associated with improvements

38:46.840 --> 38:48.340
 on verbal learning and memory.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.800
 And they had some other beneficial changes

38:51.800 --> 38:53.560
 that were within the bodily organs

38:53.560 --> 38:57.160
 and blood glucose regulation and so forth, positive changes.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.920
 But that's one study.

38:58.920 --> 39:02.080
 In this case, elderly meant 65 or older.

39:02.080 --> 39:04.840
 That study and a number of studies like it,

39:04.840 --> 39:08.560
 looking at things like mildly enhanced memory,

39:08.560 --> 39:13.360
 reduced insulin levels, reduced oxidation of LDL,

39:13.360 --> 39:16.920
 these sorts of things have basically created a situation

39:16.920 --> 39:21.920
 where anytime you Google or look up foods

39:22.000 --> 39:23.240
 that enhance brain function,

39:23.240 --> 39:25.000
 you're going to see a picture of a blueberry

39:25.000 --> 39:28.020
 or some other berry because of these anthocyanins.

39:28.020 --> 39:31.160
 I personally don't supplement anthocyanins.

39:31.160 --> 39:32.200
 I do like blueberries.

39:32.200 --> 39:34.720
 I eat blueberries when they're in season.

39:34.720 --> 39:35.560
 I love them.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.480
 I'm what you would call a drive-by blueberry eater.

39:37.480 --> 39:40.440
 Like if there are blueberries in a bowl on a table

39:40.440 --> 39:42.700
 and I'm walking by, I just have to scoop them up

39:42.700 --> 39:44.760
 like some sort of bear or other animal

39:44.760 --> 39:45.720
 and pop them in my mouth.

39:45.720 --> 39:48.160
 So blueberries don't last long around me.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.540
 One of the issues with berries,

39:49.540 --> 39:51.240
 like blueberries and blackberries and so forth

39:51.240 --> 39:53.880
 is that quality sources of them can be pretty expensive.

39:53.880 --> 39:55.760
 And then of course, when they're not in season,

39:55.760 --> 39:56.600
 they're hard to get.

39:56.600 --> 39:59.040
 And so that's why some people will supplement with them.

39:59.040 --> 40:04.040
 So that range of about 400 to about 600 milligrams per day,

40:04.800 --> 40:07.240
 seems to be the minimum threshold

40:07.240 --> 40:12.240
 for getting a cognitive effect in these elderly patients.

40:12.360 --> 40:14.000
 In that case, they were patients.

40:14.000 --> 40:15.960
 A good review about the anthocyanins

40:15.960 --> 40:19.880
 potentially contributing to offsetting cognitive decline

40:19.880 --> 40:21.480
 in things like Alzheimer's

40:21.480 --> 40:23.940
 and also enhancing brain function

40:23.940 --> 40:26.260
 in people that don't have Alzheimer's

40:26.260 --> 40:29.320
 is a review by Afzal, A-F-Z-A-L,

40:29.320 --> 40:31.180
 that was published in 2019.

40:31.180 --> 40:34.160
 We will also provide a link to that study in the caption.

40:35.040 --> 40:38.240
 When one looks across the total batch of studies

40:38.240 --> 40:39.980
 that are out there on this,

40:39.980 --> 40:43.160
 it appears that if one is going to supplement

40:43.160 --> 40:44.680
 with blueberry extract

40:44.680 --> 40:47.460
 to get the anthocyanin effect on cognition,

40:49.000 --> 40:51.560
 dosages of somewhere between five and a half

40:51.560 --> 40:55.480
 or about 11 grams seem optimal with the higher end,

40:55.480 --> 40:59.400
 closer to 10 or 11 grams being more beneficial.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.360
 The blueberry eaters out there like me

41:02.360 --> 41:05.280
 who prefer to get their anthocyanins from the actual berries,

41:05.280 --> 41:08.400
 it appears that somewhere between 60 to 120 grams

41:08.400 --> 41:10.480
 of fresh blueberries each day

41:10.480 --> 41:13.160
 is the way that you can get sufficient anthocyanins

41:13.160 --> 41:16.920
 to at least shift your system or bias your brain

41:16.920 --> 41:18.880
 towards these enhanced cognitive effects.

41:18.880 --> 41:20.840
 So we've got EPA fatty acids,

41:20.840 --> 41:23.760
 we've got phosphatidylserine, we've got choline,

41:23.760 --> 41:28.120
 we've got creatine, and we have the anthocyanins.

41:28.120 --> 41:30.900
 And the last item that I'd like to place

41:30.900 --> 41:33.600
 in this list of food-derived things

41:33.600 --> 41:37.480
 that can enhance brain function is glutamine.

41:37.480 --> 41:39.680
 Glutamine is a very interesting amino acid.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.920
 I've talked about glutamine on here before.

41:41.920 --> 41:45.080
 There's some evidence, although somewhat scant,

41:45.080 --> 41:48.000
 there's some evidence that glutamine

41:48.000 --> 41:49.840
 can enhance immune system function.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.520
 So people will supplement with glutamine

41:51.520 --> 41:53.840
 or people can get glutamine from foods.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.200
 Foods that contain a lot of glutamine

41:55.200 --> 41:56.640
 are things like cottage cheese.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.040
 There are also other sources of glutamine.

41:59.040 --> 42:01.680
 Glutamine is rich in protein-rich foods,

42:01.680 --> 42:04.240
 things like beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs,

42:04.240 --> 42:09.240
 but also for you non-animal food-consuming people out there,

42:10.680 --> 42:13.680
 vegetables, including beans, cabbage once again,

42:13.680 --> 42:17.040
 spinach, parsley, things of that sort.

42:17.040 --> 42:19.480
 So those foods contain glutamine.

42:19.480 --> 42:21.380
 For people that supplement with glutamine,

42:21.380 --> 42:23.600
 generally they will take anywhere from a gram

42:23.600 --> 42:26.120
 as much as 10 grams per day.

42:26.120 --> 42:27.100
 Why would they want to do that?

42:27.100 --> 42:30.360
 Well, there's also some evidence starting to emerge

42:30.360 --> 42:33.400
 that glutamine can help offset sugar cravings.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.540
 And I've talked about this on the podcast before.

42:35.540 --> 42:38.160
 We're going to talk more about the basis for this

42:38.160 --> 42:39.260
 a little bit later.

42:39.260 --> 42:43.600
 But in brief, we all have neurons in our gut

42:43.600 --> 42:46.760
 that sense the amino acid content, the fat content,

42:46.760 --> 42:48.620
 and the sugar content of the foods that we eat

42:48.620 --> 42:51.360
 and signal in a subconscious way to our brain

42:51.360 --> 42:53.760
 whether or not the foods that we are eating

42:53.760 --> 42:57.640
 contain certain levels of certain amino acids.

42:57.640 --> 43:01.260
 And so we actually have glutamine-sensing neurons

43:01.260 --> 43:04.260
 in our gut that actually have their little processes,

43:04.260 --> 43:06.800
 their little axons and dendrites as we call them

43:06.800 --> 43:08.220
 in the mucosal lining of the gut.

43:08.220 --> 43:09.560
 They're not just sensing glutamine,

43:09.560 --> 43:12.040
 but when they do sense glutamine, they respond

43:12.040 --> 43:13.660
 and they send signals to the brain

43:13.660 --> 43:17.400
 that are signals of satiation, of satisfaction.

43:17.400 --> 43:20.120
 And in doing so can offset some of the sugar cravings

43:20.120 --> 43:22.080
 that many people suffer from.

43:22.080 --> 43:23.460
 Now, here we're talking about glutamine

43:23.460 --> 43:25.960
 for sake of enhancing cognitive function.

43:25.960 --> 43:28.920
 And this is interesting because it's been shown

43:28.920 --> 43:31.340
 that glutamine supplementation can offset

43:31.340 --> 43:36.340
 some of the negative effects on cognition caused by altitude

43:37.800 --> 43:41.360
 and oxygen deprivation of other sorts.

43:41.360 --> 43:43.840
 Well, that's kind of a strange and unique situation

43:43.840 --> 43:45.720
 if you're going up to altitude,

43:45.720 --> 43:47.280
 should you supplement with glutamine

43:47.280 --> 43:48.960
 in order to be able to think more clearly?

43:48.960 --> 43:52.240
 Well, it appears that there's good rationale for doing that.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.360
 But the reason I bring this up,

43:54.360 --> 43:56.020
 assuming that most people, including me,

43:56.020 --> 43:59.760
 are not going up to high altitudes very often,

43:59.760 --> 44:02.520
 is that it's been well-established

44:02.520 --> 44:06.200
 that apnea, failure to breathe properly during sleep,

44:06.200 --> 44:08.320
 can contribute to age-related

44:08.320 --> 44:10.860
 and even non-age-related cognitive decline.

44:10.860 --> 44:12.720
 There are a lot of reasons for apneas,

44:13.880 --> 44:18.560
 ranging from obesity to obstruction of the airways

44:18.560 --> 44:19.580
 for other reasons.

44:20.960 --> 44:24.000
 There are a tremendous number of underlying causes of apnea

44:24.000 --> 44:25.440
 and it's something to be taken seriously.

44:25.440 --> 44:27.080
 I mean, heart attacks,

44:27.080 --> 44:30.340
 all sorts of metabolic issues are caused by apnea.

44:30.340 --> 44:33.660
 Apnea is a serious issue that disrupts the depth of sleep

44:33.660 --> 44:36.280
 and it's a serious health issue in general.

44:36.280 --> 44:40.000
 In any event, apnea is associated with cognitive decline

44:40.000 --> 44:42.880
 and cognitive dysfunction, even in young people.

44:42.880 --> 44:46.080
 And it does appear that glutamine supplementation

44:46.080 --> 44:49.200
 can offset some of the cognitive deficits

44:49.200 --> 44:52.520
 that are associated with reduced oxygenation of the brain.

44:52.520 --> 44:55.240
 If you'd like to learn more about how apnea

44:55.240 --> 44:57.760
 can negatively impact cognition,

44:57.760 --> 44:58.920
 there's an excellent paper

44:58.920 --> 45:00.760
 that was published on this in 2018.

45:00.760 --> 45:04.280
 The first author is Sharma, S-H-A-R-M-A.

45:04.280 --> 45:05.360
 It should be easy to find.

45:05.360 --> 45:06.200
 The title of the paper is

45:06.200 --> 45:10.080
 Obstructive Sleep Apnea Severity Effects Amyloid Burden

45:10.080 --> 45:12.120
 in cognitively normal elderly.

45:12.120 --> 45:13.760
 This was a longitudinal study.

45:13.760 --> 45:17.520
 Amyloid burden is a correlate of Alzheimer's

45:17.520 --> 45:20.560
 and other forms of neurodegeneration and cognitive decline

45:20.560 --> 45:22.420
 associated with memory deficits.

45:22.420 --> 45:25.800
 So obstructive sleep apnea, excuse me,

45:25.800 --> 45:30.080
 is a very serious issue for which glutamine appears

45:30.080 --> 45:33.880
 to be able to offset some of the negative symptomology.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.680
 So how is it that glutamine,

45:35.680 --> 45:38.440
 either from food or through supplementation,

45:38.440 --> 45:41.760
 can offset some of these so-called hypoxic effects

45:41.760 --> 45:42.840
 caused by sleep apnea,

45:42.840 --> 45:45.640
 hypoxia being a lack of oxygen for the brain

45:45.640 --> 45:47.480
 that relate to cognitive decline.

45:47.480 --> 45:51.040
 It appears to have this positive impact

45:51.040 --> 45:53.540
 by way of reducing inflammation.

45:53.540 --> 45:56.160
 So if you want to look more deeply

45:56.160 --> 45:58.920
 into the various biological pathways

45:58.920 --> 46:01.400
 and the supplementation regimes for this,

46:01.400 --> 46:04.660
 the paper that I think is really spectacular is a paper.

46:04.660 --> 46:09.660
 Last author is Quaresma, Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.

46:10.020 --> 46:12.600
 That's Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.560
 It's a review,

46:13.560 --> 46:15.760
 the possible importance of glutamine supplementation

46:15.760 --> 46:19.520
 to mood and cognition in hypoxia from high altitude.

46:19.520 --> 46:21.080
 And even though the paper is about

46:21.080 --> 46:23.200
 high altitude induced hypoxia,

46:23.200 --> 46:25.240
 it does seem to have direct relevance

46:25.240 --> 46:29.120
 to the sorts of apnea that are related to Alzheimer's

46:29.120 --> 46:30.920
 and other forms of cognitive decline.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.660
 Now I've been taking glutamine as a supplement, gosh,

46:33.660 --> 46:34.640
 since I was in college,

46:34.640 --> 46:38.640
 mostly because I felt either by superstition or by reality

46:38.640 --> 46:43.320
 that it protected me from various flus and colds

46:43.320 --> 46:44.340
 and things of that sort

46:44.340 --> 46:47.680
 because of the purported immune enhancing effects.

46:48.520 --> 46:50.160
 Again, those immune enhancing effects

46:50.160 --> 46:53.160
 have some data to support them, not a ton.

46:53.160 --> 46:55.280
 However, I got into the habit of taking glutamine

46:55.280 --> 46:57.600
 and now that I've learned that glutamine

46:57.600 --> 47:00.320
 seems to also have some cognitive enhancing effects,

47:00.320 --> 47:03.400
 possibly, it's a supplement that I continue to take.

47:03.400 --> 47:04.960
 I take very small amounts of it,

47:04.960 --> 47:07.640
 but I do take it on a regular basis.

47:07.640 --> 47:10.640
 So that more or less completes the list of things

47:10.640 --> 47:13.920
 that at least by my read of the literature

47:13.920 --> 47:16.680
 are things that are supported by at least three

47:16.680 --> 47:19.780
 and in some cases, as many as hundreds of studies

47:19.780 --> 47:21.280
 in various populations

47:21.280 --> 47:24.480
 that have been explored in mouse studies often,

47:24.480 --> 47:27.200
 but also in a number of human studies.

47:27.200 --> 47:28.320
 I want to emphasize again,

47:28.320 --> 47:30.120
 that all of the things I listed out,

47:30.120 --> 47:31.600
 whether or not it's EPAs,

47:31.600 --> 47:33.280
 whether or not it's phosphatidylserine,

47:33.280 --> 47:34.260
 whether or not it's choline,

47:34.260 --> 47:37.560
 whether or not it's the various compounds

47:37.560 --> 47:38.880
 that are in berries, et cetera,

47:38.880 --> 47:41.080
 all of those can be extracted from food.

47:41.080 --> 47:43.200
 There is not any law that says

47:43.200 --> 47:45.000
 that you have to get them from supplementation.

47:45.000 --> 47:47.920
 Supplementation can help you get to the very high levels

47:47.920 --> 47:50.320
 of those things if you want to work on the higher end,

47:50.320 --> 47:51.320
 if that's right for you,

47:51.320 --> 47:53.520
 obviously check with your doctor before taking anything

47:53.520 --> 47:56.320
 or removing anything from your diet or supplement regime.

47:56.320 --> 48:01.000
 But in general, you can get these things from foods.

48:01.000 --> 48:04.660
 It's just so happens that for some of these compounds,

48:04.660 --> 48:06.280
 the foods that they're contained in like fish

48:06.280 --> 48:09.000
 are not foods that I particularly enjoy.

48:09.000 --> 48:11.180
 And so I rely on, excuse me,

48:11.180 --> 48:12.980
 I rely on supplements in order

48:12.980 --> 48:15.160
 to get sufficient levels for me.

48:15.160 --> 48:17.580
 But again, you can get these levels from food.

48:17.580 --> 48:20.520
 And the reason I made this list,

48:20.520 --> 48:23.240
 the reason that I emphasize these things

48:23.240 --> 48:27.960
 in this particular order is that they support

48:27.960 --> 48:29.960
 the structure of neurons.

48:29.960 --> 48:32.780
 They support the structure of the other cells of the brain

48:32.780 --> 48:34.160
 that make up our cognition

48:34.160 --> 48:36.120
 and that are important for our focus

48:36.120 --> 48:38.880
 and our ability to remember things and so forth.

48:38.880 --> 48:40.960
 And they are less so in the category

48:40.960 --> 48:44.280
 of so-called modulatory effects.

48:44.280 --> 48:47.300
 They will also have modulatory effects on sleep,

48:47.300 --> 48:49.220
 on inflammation or reducing inflammation

48:49.220 --> 48:51.640
 throughout the body, on cardiovascular function,

48:51.640 --> 48:55.300
 all of which I believe are positive effects,

48:55.300 --> 48:57.080
 at least what the literature tells us

48:57.080 --> 48:58.560
 is that none of these compounds

48:58.560 --> 49:00.480
 are harming other systems of the body

49:00.480 --> 49:04.080
 provided they are taken at a reasonable levels.

49:04.080 --> 49:07.240
 But everything in this list is directed

49:07.240 --> 49:10.240
 towards answering the question, what can I eat?

49:10.240 --> 49:14.000
 What can I ingest by way of food and or food supplement

49:14.000 --> 49:15.920
 that can support brain function

49:15.920 --> 49:17.720
 in the short-term and in the long-term?

49:17.720 --> 49:19.600
 So I hope you find that list beneficial for you,

49:19.600 --> 49:22.920
 if not for use, at least for consideration.

49:22.920 --> 49:25.440
 So now having talked about some of the foods

49:25.440 --> 49:27.380
 and micronutrients that are beneficial

49:27.380 --> 49:30.480
 to our immediate and long-term brain health,

49:30.480 --> 49:32.040
 I'd like to shift gears somewhat

49:32.040 --> 49:36.400
 and talk about why it is that we like the foods that we like.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.560
 We've all heard before that we are hardwired

49:39.560 --> 49:42.920
 to pursue sugar and to like fatty foods

49:42.920 --> 49:45.080
 and that calorie-rich foods are attractive to us

49:45.080 --> 49:46.260
 for all sorts of reasons,

49:46.260 --> 49:48.640
 surviving famines and things of that sort.

49:48.640 --> 49:51.080
 And while that is true,

49:51.080 --> 49:53.800
 the actual mechanisms that underlie food seeking

49:53.800 --> 49:57.640
 and food preference are far more interesting than that.

49:57.640 --> 49:59.360
 There are basically three channels

49:59.360 --> 50:01.800
 in our body and nervous system

50:01.800 --> 50:04.480
 by which we decide what foods to pursue,

50:04.480 --> 50:05.480
 how much to eat,

50:05.480 --> 50:09.720
 and whether or not we will find a particular food attractive,

50:09.720 --> 50:12.160
 whether or not we will want to consume more of it,

50:12.160 --> 50:14.340
 whether or not we want to avoid it,

50:14.340 --> 50:16.460
 or whether or not it's just sort of so-so,

50:16.460 --> 50:21.460
 what I refer to as the yum, yuck, or meh analysis.

50:21.600 --> 50:24.480
 And indeed, that's what our nervous system is doing

50:24.480 --> 50:25.500
 with respect to food.

50:25.500 --> 50:28.420
 It's trying to figure out whether or not yum,

50:28.420 --> 50:29.840
 I want more of this,

50:29.840 --> 50:31.860
 yuck, I want to avoid this,

50:31.860 --> 50:33.840
 or meh, it's so-so.

50:33.840 --> 50:37.380
 Now, while that may seem like a overly simplified version

50:37.380 --> 50:39.620
 of food seeking and food preference,

50:39.620 --> 50:42.040
 it's actually not that far from the truth.

50:42.040 --> 50:46.560
 It actually correctly captures much of the biology

50:46.560 --> 50:48.240
 of food preference.

50:48.240 --> 50:50.160
 So let's talk about what these three channels

50:50.160 --> 50:52.040
 for food preference are.

50:52.040 --> 50:54.080
 The first one is an obvious one.

50:54.080 --> 50:56.140
 It's taste on the mouth.

50:56.140 --> 50:58.640
 It is the sensation that we have of the foods

50:58.640 --> 51:00.880
 that we eat while we're chewing them.

51:00.880 --> 51:02.320
 And those sensations,

51:02.320 --> 51:05.300
 which are literally just somatosensory touch sensations,

51:05.300 --> 51:08.720
 you know, the palatability of food

51:08.720 --> 51:11.920
 as it relates to the consistency of food.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.280
 That's important.

51:13.280 --> 51:15.040
 And as you've all heard before,

51:15.040 --> 51:18.280
 we have sensors on our tongue and elsewhere in our mouth

51:18.280 --> 51:21.380
 that detect the various chemicals contained within food

51:21.380 --> 51:24.560
 and lead to the senses of taste,

51:24.560 --> 51:28.200
 which we call bittersweet, umami, salty, and sour.

51:28.200 --> 51:30.880
 Now, most of us are familiar with the sense of bitterness

51:30.880 --> 51:33.760
 that comes from something like a raw radish,

51:33.760 --> 51:36.720
 sweet, which comes obviously from sugars of different kinds,

51:36.720 --> 51:38.920
 fructose, glucose, et cetera,

51:38.920 --> 51:42.180
 salty, salty, and sour.

51:43.040 --> 51:46.000
 Think lemon or lemon juice, for instance.

51:46.000 --> 51:48.040
 And then I mentioned umami.

51:48.040 --> 51:51.520
 The umami receptor is a receptor that responds

51:51.520 --> 51:53.720
 to the savory taste of things.

51:53.720 --> 51:55.460
 So that's what you might find

51:55.460 --> 51:58.480
 in a really wonderfully rich tomato sauce

51:58.480 --> 52:01.480
 for those of you that eat meat and like meat,

52:01.480 --> 52:04.920
 a really well-cooked, not necessarily well done,

52:04.920 --> 52:08.540
 but properly cooked, I should say, steak,

52:08.540 --> 52:09.800
 if that's your thing.

52:09.800 --> 52:13.480
 And umami is present in both plant and animal foods

52:13.480 --> 52:16.320
 and gives us that sensation of savoriness.

52:16.320 --> 52:19.780
 It almost has a kind of little bit of a briny taste to it

52:19.780 --> 52:21.400
 or braised taste to it.

52:21.400 --> 52:24.280
 And indeed, braising of meats and braising of vegetables

52:24.280 --> 52:29.280
 is done specifically to activate that umami receptor.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.660
 So we have those five basic tastes.

52:31.660 --> 52:34.660
 Those are chemical sensors on the tongue

52:34.660 --> 52:37.440
 that what we call transduce those chemicals,

52:37.440 --> 52:40.800
 those chemicals literally in food bind to those receptors,

52:40.800 --> 52:42.880
 and it is transduced,

52:43.860 --> 52:46.860
 meaning the binding of those chemicals to the receptors

52:46.860 --> 52:48.960
 is converted into an electrical signal

52:48.960 --> 52:50.760
 that travels in from the tongue

52:50.760 --> 52:52.940
 along what's called the gustatory nerve,

52:52.940 --> 52:55.600
 the gustatory nerve, then synapses,

52:55.600 --> 52:58.320
 meaning it makes connections in our brainstem,

52:58.320 --> 53:00.940
 in the so-called nucleus of the solitary tract.

53:00.940 --> 53:02.560
 There are other nuclei back there.

53:02.560 --> 53:04.560
 Nuclei are just aggregates of neurons.

53:04.560 --> 53:06.120
 And then it sends information up

53:06.120 --> 53:08.560
 to the so-called insular cortex, to the insula.

53:08.560 --> 53:11.640
 I want to highlight the insula this episode

53:11.640 --> 53:14.680
 because we are going to return to the insula

53:14.680 --> 53:17.460
 again and again in this episode and later.

53:17.460 --> 53:21.480
 The insular cortex is a incredible structure

53:21.480 --> 53:24.560
 that we all have that mainly is concerned

53:24.560 --> 53:26.480
 with so-called interoception,

53:26.480 --> 53:29.800
 or our perception of what's going on inside our body.

53:29.800 --> 53:31.480
 So it could be the amount of pressure in our gut

53:31.480 --> 53:33.200
 because of how much food we've eaten.

53:33.200 --> 53:36.420
 It could be the acidity of our gut

53:36.420 --> 53:38.820
 if we're having a little bit of indigestion, for instance.

53:38.820 --> 53:42.840
 It can also be the case that neurons within the insula

53:42.840 --> 53:44.760
 are paying attention to how stressed you are

53:44.760 --> 53:46.800
 or how alert you are or how tired you are.

53:46.800 --> 53:49.920
 So it's really an inward focusing structure.

53:49.920 --> 53:52.000
 It focuses on how we feel internally.

53:52.000 --> 53:56.920
 And not surprisingly, the taste system sends information

53:56.920 --> 54:00.600
 up to the insular cortex to give us a sense, literally,

54:00.600 --> 54:02.680
 of what we've ingested,

54:02.680 --> 54:06.040
 whether or not what we're tasting tastes good or not.

54:06.040 --> 54:09.080
 We will return to insular cortex in a few moments.

54:09.080 --> 54:12.480
 A very important thing to understand is that the neurons

54:12.480 --> 54:15.080
 in the areas of the cortex, your cortex and mine,

54:15.080 --> 54:16.960
 that respond to particular tastes

54:16.960 --> 54:21.940
 are providing an internal representation

54:21.940 --> 54:24.840
 of an external sense.

54:24.840 --> 54:25.820
 What do I mean by that?

54:25.820 --> 54:27.780
 I don't want to be at all abstract.

54:27.780 --> 54:30.340
 We take these foods, we break them down in our mouth

54:31.420 --> 54:33.440
 by chewing them or sucking on them,

54:33.440 --> 54:35.920
 whatever it is the food happens to be.

54:35.920 --> 54:37.620
 Those chemicals bind to those receptors

54:37.620 --> 54:39.960
 and electrical signals are sent into the brain,

54:39.960 --> 54:41.640
 but they are just electrical signals,

54:41.640 --> 54:45.000
 just like notes being played on the keys of a piano.

54:45.000 --> 54:48.060
 There's no unique signature for salty or sweet.

54:48.060 --> 54:53.060
 It is the relative activation of one set of neurons

54:53.120 --> 54:54.900
 that was activated by sweet,

54:54.900 --> 54:57.540
 or another set of neurons that was activated by umami.

54:57.540 --> 55:00.540
 It's that relative activation traveling into the brain

55:00.540 --> 55:05.500
 in essentially the same form, the same electrical signals.

55:05.500 --> 55:06.580
 This is really incredible, right?

55:06.580 --> 55:08.320
 Electrical signals are sent into the brain and you say,

55:08.320 --> 55:10.960
 aha, that's sweet and I want more of it,

55:10.960 --> 55:12.500
 or that's bitter or I want less of it,

55:12.500 --> 55:15.380
 or that's umami flavored and I really, really like that,

55:15.380 --> 55:17.840
 really like savory foods as I happen to.

55:19.160 --> 55:21.960
 That should immediately strike you as incredible

55:21.960 --> 55:24.000
 because it means that your representation

55:24.000 --> 55:27.240
 of what you want more of or less of is electrical in nature.

55:27.240 --> 55:31.040
 And to really tamp this issue down,

55:31.040 --> 55:36.000
 studies that were done by Charles Zucker, Z-U-K-E-R,

55:36.000 --> 55:39.120
 he's a absolutely phenomenal neuroscientist

55:39.120 --> 55:43.100
 at Columbia University in New York.

55:43.100 --> 55:47.000
 Studies done by the Zucker lab have shown that,

55:47.000 --> 55:49.840
 first of all, they could identify the neurons

55:49.840 --> 55:52.300
 in the cortex, deep in the brain,

55:52.300 --> 55:55.360
 that respond to a sweet taste or to a bitter taste.

55:55.360 --> 55:58.440
 It turns out they are non-overlapping populations of neurons.

55:58.440 --> 56:01.040
 And then using some molecular tricks,

56:01.040 --> 56:05.600
 they were able to either silence or activate the neurons

56:05.600 --> 56:09.400
 that, for instance, respond to sweet.

56:09.400 --> 56:13.040
 When they do this, they see incredible consequences

56:13.040 --> 56:16.880
 on perception that indeed occur in your brain

56:16.880 --> 56:18.680
 and my brain as well all the time

56:18.680 --> 56:20.180
 without these kinds of manipulations.

56:20.180 --> 56:21.280
 Here's the experiment.

56:22.240 --> 56:27.240
 They have a subject drink water that contains sugar

56:27.440 --> 56:29.640
 or drink water that contains a salty substance

56:29.640 --> 56:31.720
 or drink water that contains a bitter substance,

56:31.720 --> 56:33.840
 for instance, okay, I'm sort of paraphrasing

56:33.840 --> 56:36.040
 a large amount of work.

56:36.040 --> 56:39.940
 They identify the neurons that respond to sweet tastes.

56:41.440 --> 56:44.760
 They see, as many researchers have seen,

56:44.760 --> 56:47.920
 that subjects prefer sweet taste to other tastes

56:47.920 --> 56:49.480
 and certainly sweet taste to bitter

56:49.480 --> 56:52.060
 or sweet taste to nothing, so to plain water.

56:53.280 --> 56:55.380
 And then they go in and they are able

56:55.380 --> 57:00.140
 to selectively silence the neurons that represent sweet.

57:00.140 --> 57:04.300
 And when they do that, they eliminate the preference

57:04.300 --> 57:06.100
 for that sweet taste.

57:07.220 --> 57:08.580
 Now, that might seem obvious.

57:08.580 --> 57:09.680
 The neurons respond to sweet.

57:09.680 --> 57:11.660
 You silence those neurons.

57:11.660 --> 57:14.620
 They no longer seek out sweet.

57:14.620 --> 57:17.740
 But that should strike you also as incredible

57:17.740 --> 57:19.260
 because they're not actually changing

57:19.260 --> 57:20.500
 what's happening on the tongue

57:20.500 --> 57:22.300
 or in the deeper layers of the brain.

57:23.260 --> 57:27.600
 Conversely, they can have subjects drink bitter water

57:27.600 --> 57:30.740
 or plain water while activating,

57:30.740 --> 57:34.100
 selectively activating the neurons that respond to sweet.

57:34.100 --> 57:36.680
 And what they find is that then subjects

57:36.680 --> 57:41.680
 will actively prefer bitter or plain water

57:42.340 --> 57:46.360
 to actual preferences such as sweet.

57:46.360 --> 57:49.000
 So what this means is that your perception

57:49.000 --> 57:51.400
 of what you like is a central,

57:51.400 --> 57:54.500
 meaning deep within the brain, phenomenon.

57:54.500 --> 57:57.500
 It's not about how things taste on your mouth.

57:57.500 --> 57:59.200
 Now, of course, under normal conditions

57:59.200 --> 58:01.260
 where there aren't these experimental manipulations

58:01.260 --> 58:04.440
 being done, those things are positively correlated.

58:04.440 --> 58:07.180
 Sweet tastes trigger the activation of sweet neurons,

58:07.180 --> 58:10.760
 for instance, neurons in the mouth that respond to umami

58:10.760 --> 58:12.820
 trigger the activation of neurons in the brain

58:12.820 --> 58:14.640
 that respond to umami and so forth.

58:15.740 --> 58:19.100
 So they're correlated in a way that makes you seek out

58:19.100 --> 58:20.700
 the things that you like and avoid the things

58:20.700 --> 58:22.220
 that you don't like.

58:22.220 --> 58:24.720
 But as we'll see in a few minutes,

58:24.720 --> 58:28.060
 turns out that that is not a direct relationship

58:28.060 --> 58:29.500
 that is hardwired.

58:29.500 --> 58:32.460
 You can actually uncouple the preference

58:32.460 --> 58:36.380
 for particular tastes with the reward systems in the brain

58:36.380 --> 58:40.900
 in a way that, for instance, would allow you to eat,

58:40.900 --> 58:42.340
 or I should use myself as an example

58:42.340 --> 58:43.780
 because I don't particularly like fish.

58:43.780 --> 58:46.200
 I've had a few meals that include a fish

58:46.200 --> 58:49.200
 that were pretty good, but none of them were memorable

58:49.200 --> 58:50.340
 in the kind of positive way,

58:50.340 --> 58:53.000
 like some other events in my life are memorable.

58:53.000 --> 58:56.660
 But by way of these circuitries and the way they link up

58:56.660 --> 58:59.380
 with one another, it's actually possible to rewire

58:59.380 --> 59:03.220
 one's sense of taste and preference for particular foods.

59:03.220 --> 59:04.800
 If this is seeming at all vague to you,

59:04.800 --> 59:07.220
 just hang in with me a little bit longer

59:07.220 --> 59:08.920
 because I will provide you with the information,

59:08.920 --> 59:13.100
 tools, and resources with which to navigate this process.

59:13.100 --> 59:16.780
 But the most important thing to understand is that

59:16.780 --> 59:20.300
 like with our hearing, like with vision,

59:20.300 --> 59:25.300
 like with smell, taste is an internal representation

59:27.660 --> 59:31.780
 that has particular goals for you.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.760
 Your sense of what tastes good is related

59:33.760 --> 59:35.540
 to particular things that are occurring

59:35.540 --> 59:37.740
 in your brain and body and that are likely

59:37.740 --> 59:41.500
 to give your brain and body the things that it needs.

59:41.500 --> 59:44.500
 It is not simply a matter of what you quote unquote like

59:44.500 --> 59:47.140
 or what tastes good or what doesn't taste good.

59:47.140 --> 59:50.100
 Let me give you a relatively simple example

59:50.100 --> 59:53.220
 of how your body and your brain are acting

59:53.220 --> 59:56.960
 in a coordinated way to make you prefer certain foods

59:56.960 --> 59:59.360
 and indeed to pursue certain foods more.

1:00:00.340 --> 1:00:02.500
 So I just mentioned you have neurons on your tongue

1:00:02.500 --> 1:00:04.240
 that respond to different tastes,

1:00:04.240 --> 1:00:06.880
 but of course your digestive tract isn't just your tongue,

1:00:06.880 --> 1:00:09.220
 it's also your throat, it goes all the way down

1:00:09.220 --> 1:00:11.900
 to your stomach and of course your intestines.

1:00:11.900 --> 1:00:13.700
 Here's a long tube of digestion.

1:00:14.700 --> 1:00:17.640
 All along that tube, there are neurons.

1:00:17.640 --> 1:00:22.240
 Some of the neurons are responding to the mechanical size

1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:25.660
 of whatever portion of the digestive tract it happens to be.

1:00:25.660 --> 1:00:28.700
 So for instance, how distended or empty or full rather,

1:00:28.700 --> 1:00:30.700
 and it doesn't have to be distended,

1:00:30.700 --> 1:00:31.580
 depends on how much you ate,

1:00:31.580 --> 1:00:34.820
 but how full or empty your gut happens to be,

1:00:34.820 --> 1:00:38.380
 whether or not something you just ate is temperature hot,

1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:41.080
 you know, is hot in the sense of hot to the touch,

1:00:41.080 --> 1:00:42.940
 or whether or not it's spicy hot,

1:00:42.940 --> 1:00:44.220
 whether or not it's soothing,

1:00:44.220 --> 1:00:46.660
 whether or not it's kind of hard to swallow,

1:00:46.660 --> 1:00:47.560
 this kind of thing.

1:00:47.560 --> 1:00:49.540
 So you have neurons all along your gut

1:00:49.540 --> 1:00:51.480
 that are responding to the mechanics

1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:53.020
 related to food and digestion,

1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:56.020
 and that are related to the chemistry of food and digestion.

1:00:56.980 --> 1:01:01.400
 There's a population of neurons, nerve cells in your gut

1:01:01.400 --> 1:01:04.180
 that are exquisitely tuned to the chemistry

1:01:04.180 --> 1:01:06.160
 of whatever it is in your gut.

1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:09.560
 And these are neurons called neuropod cells.

1:01:09.560 --> 1:01:12.460
 They were discovered many, many years ago,

1:01:12.460 --> 1:01:17.460
 but really defined and classified with modern tools

1:01:17.660 --> 1:01:19.420
 by Diego Borges.

1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:21.220
 I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly, Diego.

1:01:21.220 --> 1:01:22.460
 We've spoken many times,

1:01:22.460 --> 1:01:24.120
 but I can't ever seem to quite capture

1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:26.240
 the proper pronunciation just right.

1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:30.420
 But Diego Borges at Duke University,

1:01:30.420 --> 1:01:35.420
 who discovered that these cells reside within the gut

1:01:35.460 --> 1:01:37.020
 and place little processes,

1:01:37.020 --> 1:01:39.580
 they're little axons and dendrites

1:01:39.580 --> 1:01:43.060
 within the mucosal lining of the gut.

1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:45.800
 And there they are paying attention to,

1:01:45.800 --> 1:01:50.800
 meaning they respond to amino acids, sugars,

1:01:51.100 --> 1:01:52.780
 and fatty acids.

1:01:52.780 --> 1:01:54.980
 So as your food is digested,

1:01:54.980 --> 1:01:57.180
 as food lands within your gut,

1:01:57.180 --> 1:02:00.940
 neurons there are sensing what types of foods are available

1:02:00.940 --> 1:02:03.340
 and what types of things are making their way

1:02:03.340 --> 1:02:06.020
 through the gut environment.

1:02:06.020 --> 1:02:08.460
 Now, those neurons aren't actually taking those foods

1:02:08.460 --> 1:02:09.380
 and doing much with them.

1:02:09.380 --> 1:02:13.980
 What they're doing is they're essentially surveying

1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:16.620
 what qualities of food are there.

1:02:16.620 --> 1:02:18.220
 And these particular neurons

1:02:18.220 --> 1:02:20.980
 that Diego and his group discovered

1:02:20.980 --> 1:02:24.620
 send electrical signals up into the brain

1:02:24.620 --> 1:02:27.620
 through a little passage that we call the nodos ganglion.

1:02:27.620 --> 1:02:30.240
 The nodos ganglion is a cluster of neurons

1:02:30.240 --> 1:02:33.660
 that then go send up their own process into the brain

1:02:33.660 --> 1:02:35.320
 and trigger the release of dopamine,

1:02:35.320 --> 1:02:39.220
 which is a molecule that inspires motivation,

1:02:39.220 --> 1:02:41.900
 reward, and more seeking for whatever it is

1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:43.280
 led to their activation.

1:02:45.060 --> 1:02:46.820
 These are super interesting neurons

1:02:46.820 --> 1:02:48.940
 because what they're essentially doing

1:02:48.940 --> 1:02:53.300
 is they are providing a subconscious signal

1:02:53.300 --> 1:02:55.660
 about the quality of the food that you're eating,

1:02:55.660 --> 1:02:56.900
 what it contains,

1:02:56.900 --> 1:02:59.140
 and then triggering the release of a molecule

1:02:59.140 --> 1:03:01.380
 within your brain, dopamine,

1:03:01.380 --> 1:03:04.160
 that leads you to go seek more of those foods.

1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:09.160
 Now, this has profound impact on a number of things.

1:03:09.900 --> 1:03:12.420
 First of all, there's the consideration

1:03:12.420 --> 1:03:14.340
 of so-called hidden sugars.

1:03:14.340 --> 1:03:17.440
 Dr. Robert Lustig, who's a pediatric endocrinologist

1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:19.720
 at University of California, San Francisco,

1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:23.160
 has been among the most prominent researchers

1:03:23.160 --> 1:03:24.640
 to talk about the fact that there are

1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:26.420
 the so-called hidden sugars in foods.

1:03:26.420 --> 1:03:29.160
 Now, these are not just sugars that they sneak in

1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:30.380
 just to be sneaky.

1:03:30.380 --> 1:03:32.840
 These are sugars that are literally snuck in

1:03:32.840 --> 1:03:35.480
 in a way that you can't taste them.

1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:37.120
 That's why they're called hidden sugars.

1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:39.160
 It's not that they just put them in there for fun.

1:03:39.160 --> 1:03:42.740
 These are sugars that are placed into processed foods

1:03:42.740 --> 1:03:46.840
 that are designed to trigger activation of these mechanisms

1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:50.080
 to lead you to want to eat more of these foods,

1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:54.240
 but not because they necessarily taste sweet or delicious,

1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:56.240
 but because they are activating

1:03:56.240 --> 1:03:58.560
 these subconscious mechanisms that are driving you

1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:00.040
 to pursue more of these foods.

1:04:00.040 --> 1:04:01.960
 Sounds like a very diabolical strategy.

1:04:01.960 --> 1:04:04.600
 And indeed, it is somewhat of a diabolical strategy.

1:04:05.780 --> 1:04:08.440
 However, these neurons are also involved

1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:10.600
 in signaling to your brain when, for instance,

1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:15.480
 you are eating a food that is rich in omega-3 fatty acids,

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:17.820
 the fatty acids that we were talking about earlier.

1:04:17.820 --> 1:04:19.840
 So why is it that you don't crave salmon?

1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:21.280
 Why is it that I don't sit around

1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:23.000
 daydreaming about mackerel?

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.840
 Well, because there's also the influence

1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:26.600
 of the actual taste on the mouth.

1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:28.960
 Under normal conditions, it's a combination

1:04:28.960 --> 1:04:30.360
 of the taste of the thing on the mouth

1:04:30.360 --> 1:04:33.040
 plus the subconscious signaling from the gut.

1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:37.280
 And while this isn't a discussion about gut microbiome,

1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:40.140
 I should just mention that it's very clear

1:04:40.140 --> 1:04:42.600
 that having a healthy gut microbiome

1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:46.280
 allows these neurons to function in a way

1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:50.840
 that serves our seeking of healthy foods in positive ways.

1:04:50.840 --> 1:04:53.520
 And without getting into a lot of detail about this,

1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:56.040
 the best way to ensure a healthy gut microbiome

1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:59.560
 that I am aware of is not necessarily

1:04:59.560 --> 1:05:03.240
 to take supplemental prebiotics or probiotics.

1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:04.200
 There are actually some reasons

1:05:04.200 --> 1:05:06.200
 why you might not want to do that,

1:05:06.200 --> 1:05:08.460
 but rather to ingest two to four servings

1:05:08.460 --> 1:05:11.300
 of fermented foods that are low in sugar each day.

1:05:12.260 --> 1:05:14.080
 There is a recent study published in Cell

1:05:14.080 --> 1:05:16.680
 showing that the ingestion of fermented foods,

1:05:16.680 --> 1:05:19.140
 two to four servings each day,

1:05:20.400 --> 1:05:24.880
 can enhance the quality of the mucosal lining of the gut

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:28.400
 that allows certain gut microbiota to flourish

1:05:28.400 --> 1:05:31.120
 and the gut microbiota that are not good for us

1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:31.960
 to not flourish,

1:05:31.960 --> 1:05:33.880
 because that's the environment that they settle down into.

1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:35.400
 This is work that was carried out

1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:38.280
 by my colleagues Justin Sonnenberg,

1:05:38.280 --> 1:05:40.920
 which is in the laboratory upstairs from me,

1:05:40.920 --> 1:05:43.640
 as well as Chris Gardner and others at Stanford.

1:05:44.720 --> 1:05:46.900
 They're certainly not the only researchers exploring this,

1:05:46.900 --> 1:05:49.360
 but it does appear that two to four servings

1:05:49.360 --> 1:05:52.240
 of fermented foods each day,

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:55.240
 so these would be things like natto, sauerkraut,

1:05:55.240 --> 1:05:59.400
 low sugar fermented foods is great for the gut microbiome,

1:05:59.400 --> 1:06:01.440
 and separate studies, not their study,

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:02.580
 but separate studies have shown

1:06:02.580 --> 1:06:05.560
 that the correct gut microbiome conditions

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:07.820
 allow these neurons that signal to the brain

1:06:07.820 --> 1:06:11.140
 to signal at the right times and in the right ways

1:06:11.140 --> 1:06:13.680
 to promote healthy food seeking.

1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:18.460
 Many people opt to supplement with capsule form probiotics.

1:06:18.460 --> 1:06:20.960
 There are some data that suggest

1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:24.320
 that maybe those don't contain the correct prebiotics

1:06:24.320 --> 1:06:26.200
 and probiotics for setting

1:06:26.200 --> 1:06:28.900
 the correct gut microbiota conditions.

1:06:28.900 --> 1:06:31.660
 That's a little bit of a controversial issue.

1:06:31.660 --> 1:06:36.280
 Nonetheless, getting probiotics from fermented foods

1:06:36.280 --> 1:06:38.440
 is probably the simplest and most straightforward way.

1:06:38.440 --> 1:06:41.660
 It's also the way that we evolved to do that over many,

1:06:41.660 --> 1:06:43.240
 at least hundreds and probably thousands

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:45.140
 or even tens or hundreds of thousands of years

1:06:45.140 --> 1:06:47.320
 people have been ingesting fermented foods,

1:06:47.320 --> 1:06:48.200
 not just for their taste,

1:06:48.200 --> 1:06:50.500
 but for their health benefits as well.

1:06:50.500 --> 1:06:53.440
 So now I've mentioned two of the three mechanisms

1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:55.900
 by which we prefer certain foods.

1:06:55.900 --> 1:06:58.900
 One is from the actual taste that we're familiar with,

1:06:58.900 --> 1:07:00.780
 the taste on our tongue and in our mouth

1:07:00.780 --> 1:07:04.200
 and the sensations that make us go mm, or ugh,

1:07:04.200 --> 1:07:07.080
 or eh, the yum, yuck, meh responses

1:07:07.080 --> 1:07:08.320
 as I referred to them earlier.

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:10.320
 And then there's this subconscious signaling

1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:11.760
 coming from the gut that's really based

1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:13.720
 on the nutrient content of the foods.

1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:19.980
 There's a third pathway, which is the learned association

1:07:19.980 --> 1:07:24.280
 of a particular taste with the particular quality

1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:25.920
 or value that a food has.

1:07:25.920 --> 1:07:29.000
 And this is where things get really interesting

1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.140
 and where there's actually a leverage point

1:07:31.140 --> 1:07:35.820
 for you to rewire what it is that you find tasty

1:07:35.820 --> 1:07:37.640
 and that you want to seek more of.

1:07:37.640 --> 1:07:39.020
 The work I'd like to talk about next

1:07:39.020 --> 1:07:41.460
 has been carried out in mouse models

1:07:41.460 --> 1:07:46.280
 and has been carried out in parallel experiments in humans.

1:07:46.280 --> 1:07:48.360
 This is largely, not exclusively,

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:53.360
 but largely the work of Ivan de Araujo and Dana Small.

1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:58.700
 Ivan de Araujo is at Mount Sinai School of Medicine,

1:07:58.700 --> 1:08:00.900
 and Dana Small is at Yale.

1:08:00.900 --> 1:08:02.760
 And they and others in their field

1:08:02.760 --> 1:08:04.860
 have done incredible experiments

1:08:04.860 --> 1:08:08.280
 exploring how taste and food value,

1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:10.340
 the nutritional value of food,

1:08:10.340 --> 1:08:15.120
 and the impact of that food on metabolism in the brain

1:08:15.120 --> 1:08:17.000
 drives our food choices

1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.240
 and allows us to change our food choices for the better.

1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:23.160
 Their groups have done some really amazing studies

1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:26.800
 involving ingestion of a particular substance

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:29.000
 that either contains sugar

1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:33.900
 and thereby can elevate glucose, blood sugar, or not,

1:08:33.900 --> 1:08:37.240
 and varying, meaning changing the taste

1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:41.120
 associated with that ingestion of sugar.

1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:43.280
 So let me just give you a simple example

1:08:43.280 --> 1:08:45.800
 where they have subjects,

1:08:45.800 --> 1:08:47.400
 these could be mice or these could be humans,

1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:50.280
 because they've done both sets of studies,

1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:55.280
 drink sweet water as an alternative or a choice

1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:59.600
 to non-sweetened water or bitter water or some other flavor.

1:08:59.600 --> 1:09:01.620
 What they find is that mice and humans

1:09:01.620 --> 1:09:05.080
 will prefer to consume the sweet beverage.

1:09:05.080 --> 1:09:06.520
 Now it's not always sweet water.

1:09:06.520 --> 1:09:09.920
 Mice like sweet water, but humans will prefer,

1:09:09.920 --> 1:09:13.720
 for instance, a milkshake, a fatty sweet drink.

1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:16.720
 They'll consume more of that.

1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:19.700
 And not surprisingly, dopamine levels in the brain

1:09:19.700 --> 1:09:21.740
 increase in response to that.

1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:26.640
 So the taste and the nutrient content

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:29.640
 of what it is that they're ingesting are aligned.

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:30.600
 They are matched.

1:09:32.060 --> 1:09:36.300
 They've also done experiments where they have no taste,

1:09:36.300 --> 1:09:39.220
 but subjects are being infused with sugar

1:09:39.220 --> 1:09:41.200
 directly into the gut.

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:44.200
 And not surprisingly, based on everything I've told you

1:09:44.200 --> 1:09:48.960
 up until now, subjects will pursue more of that thing

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:51.600
 relative to some other taste,

1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:54.200
 either neutral or negative taste,

1:09:54.200 --> 1:09:57.640
 because that sugar in the gut is triggering the activation

1:09:57.640 --> 1:09:58.880
 of the neurons I mentioned earlier,

1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:01.920
 which is signaling to the brain to pursue more of that thing.

1:10:01.920 --> 1:10:03.480
 So this tells us something important.

1:10:03.480 --> 1:10:06.060
 It tells us that we are driven,

1:10:06.060 --> 1:10:08.180
 meaning we have mechanisms in our brain

1:10:08.180 --> 1:10:10.480
 that make us motivated to pursue more

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:13.360
 of what brings both a taste of sweetness,

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:15.680
 but also that brings actual changes

1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:18.720
 in blood glucose levels up, okay?

1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:20.560
 So we are motivated to eat sweet things,

1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:22.040
 not just because they taste good,

1:10:22.040 --> 1:10:24.840
 but because they change our blood sugar level.

1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:26.960
 They increase our blood sugar level.

1:10:26.960 --> 1:10:29.440
 This is important because it needn't be the case.

1:10:29.440 --> 1:10:31.400
 It could have been that we were just wired

1:10:31.400 --> 1:10:34.300
 to pursue things that taste good.

1:10:34.300 --> 1:10:37.200
 But what this tells us is that we are actually wired

1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:40.280
 to pursue things that increase our blood glucose,

1:10:41.440 --> 1:10:46.440
 so much so that when the small lab,

1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:48.200
 it's not a small lab, it's actually a big lab,

1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:52.440
 but when Dana Small's lab and or Ivan de Araujo's lab

1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:56.560
 have done experiments where they use a compound

1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:58.280
 called 2-deoxyglucose.

1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:01.660
 This is a compound that can prevent glucose

1:11:01.660 --> 1:11:03.960
 from being metabolized by neurons.

1:11:03.960 --> 1:11:06.960
 So blood glucose is going up, but neurons can't use it.

1:11:06.960 --> 1:11:09.040
 What they find is that the reinforcing

1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:12.920
 or the rewarding properties of a food or taste

1:11:12.920 --> 1:11:14.320
 are eliminated.

1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:17.080
 Put simply, it is not sufficient

1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:20.320
 for a food to taste good consciously.

1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:24.700
 It is not sufficient for a food to increase blood sugar.

1:11:24.700 --> 1:11:29.200
 You need blood sugar to go up and that blood sugar,

1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:32.840
 glucose, has to be utilized by the neurons,

1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:36.360
 even if it's not associated with a good taste

1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:39.880
 and to make it even simpler, if this isn't sinking in,

1:11:39.880 --> 1:11:41.580
 this should make it very clear.

1:11:41.580 --> 1:11:45.920
 What your brain, meaning what you are seeking when you eat

1:11:45.920 --> 1:11:49.160
 is not taste, is not dopamine,

1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:51.620
 is not even a rise in blood glucose.

1:11:51.620 --> 1:11:54.200
 What you're seeking, even though you don't realize it

1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:57.300
 because it's subconscious, is you are seeking things

1:11:57.300 --> 1:12:00.880
 that allow your neurons to be metabolically active.

1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:04.520
 And this is fundamentally important for understanding

1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:08.960
 why you eat particular foods

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:11.840
 and how you can change your relationship to those foods.

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:15.000
 Now, earlier, I referred to circuits that are wired

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.840
 for a particular outcome.

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:19.100
 And in biology and in particular neuroscience,

1:12:19.100 --> 1:12:22.000
 we refer to things that are either hardwired,

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.140
 meaning immutable and unchangeable, or softwired.

1:12:26.460 --> 1:12:28.820
 A good example of soft wiring would be the areas

1:12:28.820 --> 1:12:32.260
 of your brain that are responsible for speech and language

1:12:32.260 --> 1:12:37.260
 are always more or less in the same place in your brain

1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:39.460
 and everyone else's brain.

1:12:39.460 --> 1:12:43.400
 However, they are not hardwired to speak French

1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:46.740
 or to speak English or to speak Chinese or to speak German,

1:12:46.740 --> 1:12:48.600
 because depending on where you were born

1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:50.600
 and the parents that you're born to,

1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:52.260
 you need to be able to speak one

1:12:52.260 --> 1:12:54.780
 or maybe even more languages.

1:12:54.780 --> 1:12:57.580
 The taste system and this general system

1:12:57.580 --> 1:13:01.620
 of seeking particular foods similarly is hardwired

1:13:01.620 --> 1:13:04.180
 to obtain certain types of nutrients.

1:13:04.180 --> 1:13:05.700
 It tends to like sweet things.

1:13:05.700 --> 1:13:07.500
 Most children naturally like sweet things,

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:08.860
 some more than others,

1:13:08.860 --> 1:13:12.460
 but naturally most people from childhood onward

1:13:12.460 --> 1:13:15.100
 don't particularly crave very bitter substances,

1:13:15.100 --> 1:13:17.340
 maybe mildly bitter, but not very bitter.

1:13:17.340 --> 1:13:19.640
 So there's some hard wiring of preference,

1:13:19.640 --> 1:13:22.260
 but there's also some soft wiring in the system

1:13:22.260 --> 1:13:23.620
 that allows it to change.

1:13:25.140 --> 1:13:26.180
 The groups I mentioned earlier

1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:28.180
 have done some really beautiful experiments

1:13:28.180 --> 1:13:31.780
 looking at how artificial sweeteners interact

1:13:31.780 --> 1:13:34.460
 with the actual sweet sensing system.

1:13:34.460 --> 1:13:37.080
 And this gets right down to a number of issues.

1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:38.960
 First of all, it gets to the issue

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:42.180
 of how we can rewire our taste system

1:13:42.180 --> 1:13:44.900
 in ways that serve us for better or for worse.

1:13:44.900 --> 1:13:47.500
 Second of all, it gets right down to the issue

1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:49.580
 of whether or not artificial sweeteners

1:13:49.580 --> 1:13:51.480
 are good for us or bad for us.

1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:54.700
 And indeed, as of just this last year,

1:13:54.700 --> 1:13:57.980
 we now have an answer to that question.

1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:00.020
 And turns out it depends.

1:14:00.020 --> 1:14:02.460
 And I will tell you in a few minutes

1:14:02.460 --> 1:14:06.120
 when it is okay to ingest artificial sweeteners

1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:07.980
 and when it is very detrimental

1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:10.340
 to ingest artificial sweeteners of any kind.

1:14:11.300 --> 1:14:13.100
 Regardless, I'm not going to name off brand names,

1:14:13.100 --> 1:14:14.180
 but there are different forms

1:14:14.180 --> 1:14:16.940
 of these artificial sweeteners nowadays.

1:14:16.940 --> 1:14:18.560
 And there are various forms

1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:21.220
 of non-caloric plant-based sweeteners

1:14:21.220 --> 1:14:22.620
 for which the same information

1:14:22.620 --> 1:14:24.920
 that I'm about to tell you applies.

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:27.860
 Okay, so the experiments that were done

1:14:27.860 --> 1:14:31.340
 beautifully illustrate that you seek out particular foods

1:14:31.340 --> 1:14:33.260
 because of the way they taste,

1:14:33.260 --> 1:14:36.340
 because of their impact on blood glucose levels,

1:14:36.340 --> 1:14:40.580
 but also on their impact on the dopamine system,

1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:43.180
 even if your blood glucose levels don't change.

1:14:43.180 --> 1:14:45.460
 So here's the experiment.

1:14:45.460 --> 1:14:47.840
 One group of subjects is given a sweet taste

1:14:47.840 --> 1:14:50.300
 of a substance that also raises blood glucose levels,

1:14:50.300 --> 1:14:53.640
 blood sugar, and dopamine goes up, not surprisingly.

1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:57.140
 Second condition, separate subjects,

1:14:57.140 --> 1:15:01.180
 consume an artificial sweetener or a non-caloric sweetener.

1:15:01.180 --> 1:15:04.580
 It is not preferred much over other substances,

1:15:04.580 --> 1:15:07.580
 but it is sweet, so it's preferred somewhat,

1:15:07.580 --> 1:15:10.700
 and it does not cause an increase in blood glucose levels.

1:15:11.660 --> 1:15:15.340
 And not surprisingly, dopamine levels don't go up.

1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:17.360
 So initially, we don't tend to like

1:15:17.360 --> 1:15:18.660
 artificial sweeteners that much.

1:15:18.660 --> 1:15:20.060
 That's the simple way of putting it.

1:15:20.060 --> 1:15:22.780
 However, if subjects continue

1:15:22.780 --> 1:15:24.520
 to ingest artificial sweeteners,

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:27.660
 even though there's no increase in blood glucose level,

1:15:27.660 --> 1:15:29.960
 and therefore no increase in brain metabolism,

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:34.200
 dopamine levels eventually start to rise.

1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:37.520
 And when those dopamine levels eventually start to rise,

1:15:37.520 --> 1:15:40.020
 you've essentially conditioned or reinforced

1:15:40.020 --> 1:15:43.880
 that artificial or non-caloric sweetener,

1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:45.840
 and then subjects start to consume more of it,

1:15:45.840 --> 1:15:48.660
 and they actually get a dopamine increase from it.

1:15:49.540 --> 1:15:50.380
 So that's interesting.

1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:52.780
 It says that consuming more of these artificial sweeteners

1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:55.120
 or consuming them for a longer period of time

1:15:55.120 --> 1:15:56.980
 can start to tap into the dopamine system

1:15:56.980 --> 1:15:58.580
 and lead us to seek out or consume

1:15:58.580 --> 1:15:59.860
 more of these artificial sweeteners.

1:15:59.860 --> 1:16:02.000
 Many people are probably familiar with this

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:05.320
 because we tend to, or I should say,

1:16:05.320 --> 1:16:07.080
 people report that when they ingest

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:08.080
 these artificial sweeteners,

1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:09.280
 at first they don't taste very good,

1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:11.400
 but then over time, they seem kind of tolerable,

1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:12.560
 and then maybe even pleasurable,

1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:14.960
 and then some people feel quote unquote addicted

1:16:14.960 --> 1:16:17.960
 to various diet sodas and things of that sort.

1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:21.920
 Now, there's another condition that's been explored,

1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:23.800
 and that's the really interesting condition.

1:16:23.800 --> 1:16:26.720
 And it's the condition where an artificial sweetener

1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:31.240
 is paired with a substance that can increase blood sugar,

1:16:31.240 --> 1:16:33.720
 but not because it tastes sugary

1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:34.960
 like a normal sweet substance.

1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:37.780
 So now there's an artificial sweetener

1:16:37.780 --> 1:16:42.080
 that's coupled with an actual increase in blood glucose.

1:16:42.080 --> 1:16:45.160
 The natural world scenario where this would happen

1:16:45.160 --> 1:16:48.520
 would be drinking a diet soda, which contains no calories

1:16:48.520 --> 1:16:50.220
 and therefore would not increase blood glucose,

1:16:50.220 --> 1:16:54.620
 but is sweet with a food that increases blood glucose.

1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:58.280
 And when that happens, what you're essentially doing

1:16:58.280 --> 1:17:00.000
 is tapping into the dopamine system,

1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:04.000
 this non-chloric sweet taste is paired with it,

1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:07.540
 and there's an increase in neuron metabolism.

1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:10.440
 So you have all of the components for reinforcement.

1:17:10.440 --> 1:17:14.000
 And as a consequence, you get in a sort of Pavlovian

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:17.760
 conditioning way, a situation where later,

1:17:17.760 --> 1:17:20.600
 when you ingest that artificial sweetener,

1:17:20.600 --> 1:17:23.760
 you actually get not only the increase in dopamine,

1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:27.260
 but you get alterations in blood sugar management.

1:17:27.260 --> 1:17:31.440
 Now, blood sugar cannot go up if you don't ingest something

1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:32.600
 that makes blood sugar go up.

1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:35.160
 So it's not as if you ingest artificial sweetener

1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:38.360
 with some food that contains calories or sugar,

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.380
 and then later you remove the food

1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:44.300
 and you just drink the soda and your blood glucose goes up.

1:17:44.300 --> 1:17:47.620
 Rather, it's a much worse situation.

1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:51.760
 If you, I'll make this in the natural world context,

1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:53.400
 if you ingest an artificial sweetener,

1:17:53.400 --> 1:17:56.920
 say drink diet soda while consuming foods

1:17:56.920 --> 1:18:01.280
 that increase blood glucose, then later,

1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:04.120
 even if you just drink the diet soda,

1:18:04.120 --> 1:18:08.080
 it's been shown that you secrete much more insulin,

1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:10.940
 the hormone that regulates blood glucose

1:18:10.940 --> 1:18:13.120
 in response to that diet soda.

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:16.080
 Studies have been done in both adult humans

1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:17.600
 and in human children.

1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:19.680
 In general, when we say children, we mean human children,

1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:22.420
 but just to be very clear what we're talking about,

1:18:22.420 --> 1:18:25.660
 exploring consuming diet soda with or without food,

1:18:25.660 --> 1:18:28.760
 then later consuming just the diet soda.

1:18:28.760 --> 1:18:31.920
 And what they found was having previously consumed

1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:34.680
 diet soda with food and then later only consuming

1:18:34.680 --> 1:18:37.980
 the diet soda, of course, there isn't an increase

1:18:37.980 --> 1:18:39.960
 in blood glucose because they're not bringing in

1:18:39.960 --> 1:18:42.440
 any calories when they just drink the diet soda,

1:18:42.440 --> 1:18:46.940
 but there is a significant increase in insulin release.

1:18:46.940 --> 1:18:50.360
 And that is serious in a terrible way

1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:52.300
 because increased release of insulin

1:18:52.300 --> 1:18:54.920
 and so-called insulin sensitivity is the basis

1:18:54.920 --> 1:18:56.760
 for type two diabetes.

1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:00.280
 So much so that in the study with the children,

1:19:00.280 --> 1:19:04.020
 consuming non-caloric beverages in this way,

1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:07.040
 first with food and then on their own,

1:19:07.040 --> 1:19:10.140
 led to increases in insulin that made them pre-diabetic

1:19:10.140 --> 1:19:12.280
 and they actually had to halt the study.

1:19:12.280 --> 1:19:15.780
 So I want to zoom out from this and just really illustrate

1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:18.480
 the major findings and then talk about how this can be

1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:19.740
 applied in the positive sense.

1:19:19.740 --> 1:19:22.080
 I also want to mention what this means in terms of your

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:25.460
 consumption of artificial sweeteners of any kind.

1:19:25.460 --> 1:19:27.480
 So first of all, the direct takeaway

1:19:27.480 --> 1:19:29.880
 about artificial sweeteners.

1:19:29.880 --> 1:19:32.580
 Artificial sweeteners are not bad for you.

1:19:32.580 --> 1:19:34.260
 I'm not going to say that.

1:19:34.260 --> 1:19:36.580
 What I am going to say is that whether or not you ingest

1:19:36.580 --> 1:19:40.640
 them alone or you ingest them in combination with foods

1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:44.160
 or as part of foods that raise blood glucose

1:19:44.160 --> 1:19:47.000
 is vitally important for your insulin management.

1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:51.340
 And the simple extract or tool from this is if you're going

1:19:51.340 --> 1:19:53.600
 to consume artificial sweeteners,

1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:58.500
 it's very likely best to consume those away from any food

1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:00.620
 that raises blood glucose levels.

1:20:00.620 --> 1:20:04.200
 So if you're going to enjoy diet soda, be my guest,

1:20:04.200 --> 1:20:07.140
 but do it while not while consuming food,

1:20:07.140 --> 1:20:09.440
 in particular foods that raise blood glucose,

1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:11.160
 because what these studies show,

1:20:11.160 --> 1:20:13.080
 and I will provide references for these,

1:20:13.080 --> 1:20:18.080
 is that they can vastly disrupt blood sugar management

1:20:18.080 --> 1:20:20.820
 by way of the insulin glucose system, okay?

1:20:20.820 --> 1:20:22.780
 And actually I'll just give you the reference now.

1:20:22.780 --> 1:20:25.420
 This is a paper from Dana Small's lab.

1:20:25.420 --> 1:20:30.080
 The first author is Dallenberg, D-A-L-E-N-B-E-R-G.

1:20:30.080 --> 1:20:32.660
 And the title of the paper is short-term consumption

1:20:32.660 --> 1:20:35.400
 of sucralose with, but not without carbohydrate impairs

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:39.720
 neural and metabolic sensitivity to sugar in humans.

1:20:39.720 --> 1:20:41.560
 This is a paper published in Cell Metabolism

1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:42.800
 in March of 2020.

1:20:42.800 --> 1:20:46.520
 I think it's a very important paper and similar findings

1:20:46.520 --> 1:20:49.200
 have been addressed in mice and in other studies.

1:20:49.200 --> 1:20:50.540
 And now because of this paper,

1:20:50.540 --> 1:20:54.920
 there's now a bunch of other groups working on this issue.

1:20:54.920 --> 1:20:58.800
 There's some evidence previously published in Nature,

1:20:58.800 --> 1:21:02.620
 excellent top tier journal among the Super Bowl

1:21:02.620 --> 1:21:05.720
 of top three journals being Nature Science and Cell.

1:21:05.720 --> 1:21:07.840
 Paper published in Nature a few years back

1:21:07.840 --> 1:21:10.960
 showing that particular artificial sweeteners

1:21:10.960 --> 1:21:12.720
 can disrupt the gut microbiome

1:21:12.720 --> 1:21:14.560
 and have deleterious health effects.

1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:17.160
 That result, I think, stands,

1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:20.640
 although there are some results that may not agree

1:21:20.640 --> 1:21:21.920
 with that depending on whether or not

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:24.040
 the artificial sweetener is saccharin or sucralose

1:21:24.040 --> 1:21:27.620
 or aspartame or stevia, that's the gut microbiome.

1:21:27.620 --> 1:21:30.720
 But what we are talking about here is independent

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:33.280
 of the form of artificial or non-chloric sweetener

1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:35.000
 because it has everything to do with whether or not

1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:39.280
 there is a match or a mismatch between the perceived taste

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:42.640
 and the effect of the thing that you are consuming

1:21:42.640 --> 1:21:45.240
 on blood sugar and metabolism.

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:48.920
 So the first takeaway from this is

1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:51.760
 if you're going to consume artificial sweeteners,

1:21:51.760 --> 1:21:53.500
 it's really important that you do that,

1:21:53.500 --> 1:21:57.680
 not in conjunction with foods that increase blood glucose.

1:21:57.680 --> 1:22:00.140
 Second of all, it points to the fact

1:22:00.140 --> 1:22:01.840
 that the foods that we prefer

1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:05.800
 and the activation of the dopamine system,

1:22:06.840 --> 1:22:11.300
 both through the gut and at the level of conscious taste,

1:22:11.300 --> 1:22:15.000
 in other words, what we like is very plastic,

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.440
 it's mutable, and we can change it.

1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:18.640
 How can we change it?

1:22:18.640 --> 1:22:22.300
 Well, earlier I mentioned a structure in the brain

1:22:22.300 --> 1:22:24.480
 called the insula, this incredible structure

1:22:24.480 --> 1:22:26.760
 that's involved in interoception

1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:28.120
 and interoception of all kinds.

1:22:28.120 --> 1:22:31.920
 In fact, just as an aside, a year or so ago,

1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:34.320
 my lab published a paper showing that

1:22:34.320 --> 1:22:39.320
 activity within certain compartments of the insula of humans

1:22:41.040 --> 1:22:44.140
 is responding to a heightened state of anxiety in the body.

1:22:44.140 --> 1:22:46.600
 It can respond to changes in our respiration,

1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:47.720
 changes in our heart rate.

1:22:47.720 --> 1:22:51.160
 So this is, again, it's a readout of our internal state,

1:22:51.160 --> 1:22:54.460
 not just of taste, but of many, many different aspects

1:22:54.460 --> 1:22:58.600
 of the mechanics and chemistry of our internal milieu

1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:00.280
 within our body.

1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:02.680
 All of the work that I was describing previously

1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:06.440
 has also been addressed at the neural level.

1:23:06.440 --> 1:23:09.680
 And using a broad brush to explain these results,

1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:14.400
 what we can say is when there is dopamine increase,

1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:19.000
 one sees activation of the so-called nucleus accumbens,

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:22.360
 which is part of the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway.

1:23:22.360 --> 1:23:24.480
 If you'd like to learn more about the mesolimbic reward

1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:27.920
 pathway and dopamine in general and humans

1:23:27.920 --> 1:23:31.640
 and in animal studies and all the various incredible

1:23:32.940 --> 1:23:35.960
 and challenging things that dopamine can do for us,

1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:39.000
 there's a episode all about dopamine that you can look up.

1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.700
 It's easy to find at hubermanlab.com.

1:23:41.700 --> 1:23:45.700
 The increases in dopamine associated with sweet taste

1:23:45.700 --> 1:23:49.560
 and or blood glucose elevating foods and drinks

1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:52.740
 cause activation of the nucleus accumbens.

1:23:52.740 --> 1:23:54.540
 That's not surprising.

1:23:54.540 --> 1:23:56.740
 Also in the circuit is activation

1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:59.860
 of the so-called arcuate nuclei within the hypothalamus.

1:23:59.860 --> 1:24:02.060
 These are areas of the hypothalamus that respond

1:24:02.060 --> 1:24:05.540
 to hormones from the body and respond to hormones

1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:06.940
 and neuropeptides in the brain,

1:24:06.940 --> 1:24:09.180
 as well as neural signals in the brain

1:24:09.180 --> 1:24:12.340
 to drive us to eat more or to stop eating.

1:24:12.340 --> 1:24:14.860
 So it's hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens.

1:24:14.860 --> 1:24:17.800
 These are sort of the hypothalamus and the arcuate

1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:22.740
 being the motivating to eat or motivating to stop eating.

1:24:22.740 --> 1:24:25.340
 Both sets of neurons are contained there.

1:24:25.340 --> 1:24:27.480
 There are other areas like the lateral hypothalamus as well,

1:24:27.480 --> 1:24:29.180
 but hypothalamus is sort of the accelerator

1:24:29.180 --> 1:24:30.300
 and the brake on eating.

1:24:30.300 --> 1:24:33.100
 And then the nucleus accumbens and dopamine release

1:24:33.100 --> 1:24:37.820
 can be thought of as kind of a nitro boost, if you will,

1:24:37.820 --> 1:24:39.420
 like the kids say, do the kids say that anymore?

1:24:39.420 --> 1:24:43.900
 Anyway, a nitro boost to increase what we call the gain

1:24:43.900 --> 1:24:47.780
 or the volume of how much you want more of something, okay?

1:24:47.780 --> 1:24:50.840
 When dopamine is present, it's this kind of generic signal

1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:54.260
 to go seek out more of whatever caused that release.

1:24:54.260 --> 1:24:55.900
 And then there's the insula,

1:24:55.900 --> 1:24:58.800
 this very thoughtful, rational, not really,

1:24:58.800 --> 1:25:00.800
 it's not thinking, it's a brain area, you're thinking,

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:02.420
 but it's part of the areas of your brain

1:25:02.420 --> 1:25:05.360
 that are interpreting what's going on in your body,

1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:06.900
 whether or not you feel good or not good,

1:25:06.900 --> 1:25:11.700
 whether or not you feel anxious, excited, or fearful.

1:25:11.700 --> 1:25:14.300
 It's integrating all that information

1:25:14.300 --> 1:25:18.340
 and fed into this entire circuit as well

1:25:18.340 --> 1:25:20.520
 are the inputs from your prefrontal cortex,

1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:24.380
 which is your thinking, rational, neuronal structure,

1:25:24.380 --> 1:25:27.680
 if you will, informing you, for instance,

1:25:27.680 --> 1:25:31.580
 ah, well, I don't really like salmon very much,

1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:36.580
 or I'm not so crazy about kale, but it has omega-3s,

1:25:36.940 --> 1:25:41.520
 or it's rich in these polyphenols that are good for me.

1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:46.180
 And if one decides that they are going to eat these things,

1:25:46.180 --> 1:25:48.300
 not just because they are good for them,

1:25:48.300 --> 1:25:52.840
 but believe it or not, if one takes the perception

1:25:52.840 --> 1:25:56.060
 or adopts the perception that they are both good for you

1:25:56.060 --> 1:25:59.540
 and that in being good for you,

1:25:59.540 --> 1:26:01.380
 they are good for your brain metabolism,

1:26:01.380 --> 1:26:06.380
 and that you desire to be healthy, as crazy as it sounds,

1:26:06.900 --> 1:26:09.860
 those subjective signals of what you tell yourself

1:26:09.860 --> 1:26:11.700
 about the foods that you're eating

1:26:11.700 --> 1:26:16.120
 can actually impact how those foods will taste,

1:26:16.120 --> 1:26:18.100
 maybe not immediately, but eventually,

1:26:18.100 --> 1:26:20.020
 and can impact the way in which

1:26:20.020 --> 1:26:22.300
 your body utilizes those foods.

1:26:22.300 --> 1:26:25.520
 Now, that might seem like a absolute pipe dream.

1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:27.620
 If I just imagine that I like mackerel,

1:26:27.620 --> 1:26:29.060
 mackerel will start to taste good.

1:26:29.060 --> 1:26:29.980
 I'm not saying that.

1:26:29.980 --> 1:26:34.140
 I didn't say that you could override yuck signals

1:26:34.140 --> 1:26:36.260
 with this mechanism.

1:26:36.260 --> 1:26:38.580
 I didn't say that you could take a food

1:26:38.580 --> 1:26:41.420
 that would be absolutely noxious to you

1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:43.320
 or make you want to vomit and override that.

1:26:43.320 --> 1:26:46.300
 However, foods that are somewhat neutral to you

1:26:47.700 --> 1:26:51.420
 can take on a different value

1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:54.360
 based on the activation of the dopamine system.

1:26:54.360 --> 1:26:56.360
 And now, knowing what you know,

1:26:56.360 --> 1:26:58.900
 there are a couple of ways that you could imagine doing that.

1:26:58.900 --> 1:27:02.900
 First of all, you could, in this so-called gedanken

1:27:02.900 --> 1:27:05.260
 or thought experiment, you could, for instance,

1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:09.600
 swap out sucralose because sucralose is just a taste, right?

1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:11.460
 It's an artificial sweet taste.

1:27:11.460 --> 1:27:15.380
 You could swap that out and insert kale,

1:27:15.380 --> 1:27:19.780
 but eat the kale with something that raises blood glucose

1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:20.980
 to some degree or another.

1:27:20.980 --> 1:27:23.140
 Now, I'm not encouraging anyone to run out there

1:27:23.140 --> 1:27:25.660
 and spike their blood glucose like crazy.

1:27:25.660 --> 1:27:29.060
 And in fact, blood glucose isn't really the goal.

1:27:29.060 --> 1:27:31.900
 If you recall, the goal is to get neurons

1:27:31.900 --> 1:27:35.180
 to be metabolically active with that blood glucose, okay?

1:27:35.180 --> 1:27:38.300
 That's what's actually rewarded at a subconscious level,

1:27:38.300 --> 1:27:40.980
 meaning at a deep subconscious level.

1:27:40.980 --> 1:27:44.140
 But consuming these foods with other foods

1:27:44.140 --> 1:27:47.380
 that increase blood glucose and thereby brain metabolism,

1:27:47.380 --> 1:27:51.800
 or I suppose if you're ketogenic, you're in a ketosis,

1:27:52.720 --> 1:27:53.900
 I don't know what the range of foods

1:27:53.900 --> 1:27:55.180
 that are allowed on ketosis are,

1:27:55.180 --> 1:27:58.220
 so I don't want to misspeak here and say cracker,

1:27:58.220 --> 1:28:00.900
 which would probably be a sin in the context of ketosis,

1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:02.420
 and no knock against ketosis.

1:28:02.420 --> 1:28:04.420
 I'm offering this in part

1:28:04.420 --> 1:28:06.060
 because I think that there are a number of people

1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:10.260
 that have and can positively benefit from a ketogenic diet.

1:28:10.260 --> 1:28:11.100
 But for instance,

1:28:11.100 --> 1:28:14.220
 if there's a food that you want to consume more of,

1:28:14.220 --> 1:28:18.880
 but that you find somewhat meh or mildly yuck even,

1:28:20.060 --> 1:28:21.920
 pairing it with ketones,

1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:25.860
 if indeed you are using ketones for your brain metabolism,

1:28:25.860 --> 1:28:27.980
 because that's what happens on the ketogenic diet,

1:28:27.980 --> 1:28:31.280
 over time, that food will be reinforced

1:28:31.280 --> 1:28:32.260
 by the dopamine pathway.

1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:34.780
 We know this from these studies where sucralose

1:28:34.780 --> 1:28:38.940
 was the substance paired with the glucose elevating,

1:28:38.940 --> 1:28:39.780
 in other words,

1:28:39.780 --> 1:28:44.780
 metabolically elevating food substance or liquid substance.

1:28:44.780 --> 1:28:46.980
 So how does one go about doing this?

1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:49.320
 Well, first of all,

1:28:49.320 --> 1:28:51.060
 I want to emphasize that this experiment

1:28:51.060 --> 1:28:54.580
 actually has been done in a slightly different context.

1:28:56.100 --> 1:28:58.780
 Studies by my colleague Alia Crum

1:28:58.780 --> 1:29:01.220
 in the psychology department at Stanford

1:29:01.220 --> 1:29:04.620
 have explored the bodily response

1:29:04.620 --> 1:29:06.180
 in terms of insulin release

1:29:06.180 --> 1:29:09.880
 and the release of other food and eating related hormones,

1:29:10.740 --> 1:29:14.980
 as well as overall feelings of satisfaction, et cetera,

1:29:14.980 --> 1:29:19.640
 in groups of people that drink a milkshake

1:29:19.640 --> 1:29:22.280
 and are either told that it's a low calorie shake

1:29:22.280 --> 1:29:25.540
 that contains various nutrients that are good for them,

1:29:25.540 --> 1:29:27.500
 or a higher calorie shake

1:29:27.500 --> 1:29:30.100
 that has a lot of nutrients, et cetera,

1:29:30.100 --> 1:29:33.800
 and what they found was that the different groups,

1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:34.640
 and here again,

1:29:34.640 --> 1:29:37.340
 I'm being very general with my description of these studies,

1:29:37.340 --> 1:29:40.980
 but what they found is that the physiological response,

1:29:40.980 --> 1:29:43.420
 the insulin response, the blood glucose response,

1:29:43.420 --> 1:29:45.560
 and the subjective measures

1:29:45.560 --> 1:29:48.100
 of whether or not people enjoyed something or not

1:29:48.100 --> 1:29:50.580
 were heavily influenced by what they were told

1:29:50.580 --> 1:29:52.020
 were in these milkshakes.

1:29:52.020 --> 1:29:54.240
 So blood glucose would go up, insulin would go up

1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:56.200
 when people were told it was a high calorie shake

1:29:56.200 --> 1:29:57.240
 with lots of nutrients,

1:29:57.240 --> 1:29:59.260
 less so when people ingested a shake

1:29:59.260 --> 1:30:04.260
 that they were told had less nutrients and so forth,

1:30:05.320 --> 1:30:09.660
 when in reality, it was the identical shake.

1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:10.500
 This is incredible.

1:30:10.500 --> 1:30:11.800
 This is a belief effect.

1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:13.520
 This is not placebo, right?

1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:15.100
 A placebo effect is different.

1:30:15.100 --> 1:30:16.860
 Placebo effect is in comparison.

1:30:16.860 --> 1:30:18.140
 It's where the control condition

1:30:18.140 --> 1:30:22.420
 actually influences outcomes to a same,

1:30:22.420 --> 1:30:26.500
 or to some degree, just like the experimental condition.

1:30:26.500 --> 1:30:27.700
 This is not a placebo effect.

1:30:27.700 --> 1:30:29.460
 This is a belief effect

1:30:29.460 --> 1:30:32.700
 where the belief and the subjective thoughts

1:30:32.700 --> 1:30:35.260
 about what a given food will do

1:30:35.260 --> 1:30:38.340
 has a direct impact on a physiological measure

1:30:38.340 --> 1:30:41.020
 like blood sugar and blood glucose, okay?

1:30:41.020 --> 1:30:43.060
 So let's zoom out from this for a second

1:30:43.060 --> 1:30:45.780
 and think about how we can incorporate this

1:30:45.780 --> 1:30:50.140
 into adopting consumption of healthy foods

1:30:50.140 --> 1:30:53.680
 that serve our brain health in the immediate and long-term.

1:30:53.680 --> 1:30:54.900
 And if you're wondering what those are,

1:30:54.900 --> 1:30:56.820
 I listed them out at the beginning of the episode

1:30:56.820 --> 1:30:59.160
 and their justification for being on that list.

1:31:00.260 --> 1:31:01.860
 What this means is,

1:31:01.860 --> 1:31:04.780
 obviously you want to consume foods that you like,

1:31:04.780 --> 1:31:07.700
 but because brain health is very important

1:31:07.700 --> 1:31:10.580
 and many of the foods that promote brain health

1:31:11.780 --> 1:31:13.980
 perhaps are not the most palatable to you

1:31:13.980 --> 1:31:16.060
 or desirable to you,

1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:19.340
 the key would be to ingest the foods

1:31:19.340 --> 1:31:21.380
 that you want to ingest more of

1:31:21.380 --> 1:31:23.320
 simply because they're good for you

1:31:23.320 --> 1:31:25.220
 and not because they taste good to you.

1:31:25.220 --> 1:31:28.900
 Alongside foods that increase

1:31:28.900 --> 1:31:31.400
 whatever fuel system you happen to be relying on,

1:31:31.400 --> 1:31:33.480
 I think that's the most nutritionally

1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:34.860
 politically correct way to say it.

1:31:34.860 --> 1:31:37.660
 So if you're keto, that would mean ketones, okay?

1:31:37.660 --> 1:31:39.220
 If you're not ketogenic,

1:31:39.220 --> 1:31:41.540
 and I think most people probably are not in ketosis

1:31:41.540 --> 1:31:43.340
 or trying to maintain ketosis,

1:31:43.340 --> 1:31:45.220
 but for instance, people that are on a purely

1:31:45.220 --> 1:31:47.100
 plant-based diet, that would be one set of foods.

1:31:47.100 --> 1:31:49.420
 For people that are omnivores, a different set of foods,

1:31:49.420 --> 1:31:50.800
 and for people that are carnivores,

1:31:50.800 --> 1:31:52.080
 yet another set of foods.

1:31:53.220 --> 1:31:55.060
 If you want to eat more of a particular food

1:31:55.060 --> 1:31:55.960
 because it's good for you,

1:31:55.960 --> 1:31:58.500
 pair it with something in the same meal.

1:31:58.500 --> 1:32:02.360
 You don't have to hide it physically or in the flavor sense.

1:32:02.360 --> 1:32:04.220
 You don't have to hide it within that other food,

1:32:04.220 --> 1:32:06.300
 but pair it with that other food

1:32:06.300 --> 1:32:09.860
 that provides you a shift in brain metabolism

1:32:09.860 --> 1:32:13.040
 because that's really what your brain and you are seeking

1:32:13.040 --> 1:32:14.800
 even though you don't realize it.

1:32:14.800 --> 1:32:16.180
 How long will this take?

1:32:16.180 --> 1:32:19.940
 Well, according to the data in humans on sucralose

1:32:19.940 --> 1:32:23.920
 and the conditioning for sucralose to have these effects,

1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:26.740
 which in many cases were detrimental, right?

1:32:26.740 --> 1:32:28.380
 Because they were increasing insulin.

1:32:28.380 --> 1:32:29.460
 But in this case,

1:32:29.460 --> 1:32:33.620
 you're trying to hijack this conditioning of food preference

1:32:33.620 --> 1:32:36.820
 for healthy purposes, not with sucralose,

1:32:36.820 --> 1:32:39.160
 but by ingesting things that are good for you,

1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:41.940
 then the data really points to the fact

1:32:41.940 --> 1:32:44.900
 that even within a short period of time of about seven days,

1:32:44.900 --> 1:32:47.100
 but certainly within 14 days,

1:32:47.100 --> 1:32:50.620
 that food will take on a subjective experience

1:32:50.620 --> 1:32:54.900
 of tasting at least better to you, if not good to you.

1:32:54.900 --> 1:32:57.440
 Now, I believe this has important implications

1:32:57.440 --> 1:33:00.600
 for much of the controversy and food wars

1:33:00.600 --> 1:33:02.060
 that we see out there.

1:33:02.060 --> 1:33:04.180
 Food wars being, of course,

1:33:04.180 --> 1:33:08.960
 these groups that ardently subscribe to the idea

1:33:08.960 --> 1:33:12.300
 that their diet and the things that they are eating

1:33:12.300 --> 1:33:13.900
 are the foods that are good for us

1:33:13.900 --> 1:33:15.580
 and that are the most pleasureful

1:33:15.580 --> 1:33:18.500
 and the things that everyone should be eating.

1:33:18.500 --> 1:33:23.100
 We see this with every community within the nutrition realm.

1:33:23.100 --> 1:33:25.940
 Now, of course, there are studies that point to the fact

1:33:25.940 --> 1:33:28.940
 that certain foods and food components are healthier

1:33:28.940 --> 1:33:31.080
 probably for us and for the planet,

1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:32.940
 but you really see it on both ends of the spectrum.

1:33:32.940 --> 1:33:34.900
 You've got people who are on a pure carnivore diet

1:33:34.900 --> 1:33:37.700
 who are arguing with a lot of biomedical evidence

1:33:37.700 --> 1:33:40.380
 that that's what's best for us and beneficial.

1:33:40.380 --> 1:33:41.220
 And then you've got people

1:33:41.220 --> 1:33:44.060
 that are arguing the same general sets of arguments,

1:33:44.060 --> 1:33:45.600
 but for a purely plant-based diet.

1:33:45.600 --> 1:33:48.600
 And then I think most people fall into the omnivore category.

1:33:50.340 --> 1:33:51.880
 What's very clear, however,

1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:55.460
 is that what we consume on a regular basis

1:33:55.460 --> 1:33:59.580
 and what leads to increases in brain metabolism

1:33:59.580 --> 1:34:01.660
 leads to increases in dopamine

1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:04.380
 and thereby our motivation to eat them.

1:34:04.380 --> 1:34:08.560
 So what this really says is that what we tend to do regularly

1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:11.220
 becomes reinforcing in and of itself.

1:34:11.220 --> 1:34:14.140
 And I think in large part can explain the fact that,

1:34:14.140 --> 1:34:15.960
 yes, indeed, for certain people,

1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:18.660
 a given diet not only feels good,

1:34:18.660 --> 1:34:21.380
 but they heavily subscribe to the nutrient

1:34:21.380 --> 1:34:24.700
 and kind of health beneficial effects of that diet.

1:34:24.700 --> 1:34:27.240
 And they often will provide evidence for that,

1:34:27.240 --> 1:34:29.660
 whether or not you ask them for it or not.

1:34:29.660 --> 1:34:32.020
 But that's true of every subcategory

1:34:32.020 --> 1:34:34.420
 within the nutrition realm.

1:34:35.300 --> 1:34:36.740
 Again, this is not to take away

1:34:36.740 --> 1:34:39.260
 from some of the beautiful data emphasizing

1:34:39.260 --> 1:34:42.500
 that certain foods and micronutrients, et cetera,

1:34:42.500 --> 1:34:45.540
 are better for us or worse for us and for the planet.

1:34:45.540 --> 1:34:47.380
 That's not a debate I want to get into right now.

1:34:47.380 --> 1:34:52.380
 What this emphasizes is that foods impact our brain

1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:53.640
 and its health,

1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:57.880
 but they also impact how our brain functions

1:34:57.880 --> 1:34:59.700
 and responds to food.

1:34:59.700 --> 1:35:02.580
 And that is largely a learned response.

1:35:02.580 --> 1:35:05.460
 We can't completely override, for instance,

1:35:05.460 --> 1:35:09.460
 that certain foods evoke a strong yuck component.

1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:11.660
 Certain foods are truly putrid to us.

1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:13.540
 I should just say certain things are putrid to us

1:35:13.540 --> 1:35:15.280
 and we should not consume them, right?

1:35:15.280 --> 1:35:17.860
 And that's at the far end of the spectrum,

1:35:17.860 --> 1:35:19.860
 it's hardwired for us to avoid those

1:35:19.860 --> 1:35:21.940
 because they can be dangerous for us.

1:35:21.940 --> 1:35:24.120
 They can make us very, very sick.

1:35:24.120 --> 1:35:27.700
 But it's also true that if we continue to eat foods

1:35:27.700 --> 1:35:29.500
 that are progressively sweeter and sweeter

1:35:29.500 --> 1:35:32.740
 and highly palatable, it shifts our dopamine system

1:35:32.740 --> 1:35:34.940
 because it activates our dopamine system

1:35:34.940 --> 1:35:37.620
 to make us believe that those foods are the only foods

1:35:37.620 --> 1:35:39.920
 that can trigger this reward system

1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:41.300
 and make us feel good and taste,

1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:42.140
 and that they taste good.

1:35:42.140 --> 1:35:46.020
 But after consuming foods that perhaps are less sweet

1:35:46.020 --> 1:35:49.860
 or even less savory that are not what we would call highly,

1:35:49.860 --> 1:35:52.280
 or I would say nowadays it's super palatable foods,

1:35:52.280 --> 1:35:57.280
 we can adjust our sense literally of what we perceive

1:35:57.740 --> 1:35:59.780
 as an attractive and rewarding food.

1:35:59.780 --> 1:36:01.600
 And indeed the dopamine system

1:36:01.600 --> 1:36:04.260
 will reward those foods accordingly.

1:36:04.260 --> 1:36:07.420
 I can't emphasize enough how much this learning

1:36:07.420 --> 1:36:10.960
 of associated food reward is important

1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:13.740
 for not just understanding why we like the foods

1:36:13.740 --> 1:36:15.860
 that we eat and how to eat more of foods

1:36:15.860 --> 1:36:19.020
 that are healthy for us and enjoy them.

1:36:19.020 --> 1:36:24.020
 But it also speaks to the fact that our brain as a whole

1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:26.780
 is a perceptual device trying to make guesses

1:36:26.780 --> 1:36:29.140
 or estimations about what certain foods

1:36:29.140 --> 1:36:30.420
 are going to do for us.

1:36:30.420 --> 1:36:33.180
 So put simply, we don't just like sweet foods

1:36:33.180 --> 1:36:34.000
 because they taste good.

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:35.300
 We like them because they predict

1:36:35.300 --> 1:36:37.200
 a certain kind of metabolic response.

1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:41.960
 This is important also because Dana Small

1:36:41.960 --> 1:36:45.520
 and Ivan de Araujo and others have been exploring

1:36:45.520 --> 1:36:47.440
 whether or not people, for instance,

1:36:47.440 --> 1:36:50.400
 that have type 2 diabetes or that suffer

1:36:50.400 --> 1:36:52.320
 from any number of different metabolic disorders,

1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:54.800
 whether or not somehow these food reward systems

1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:56.600
 are permanently disrupted.

1:36:56.600 --> 1:36:58.480
 And through a beautiful set of experiments

1:36:58.480 --> 1:37:01.560
 that have been done mainly by Dana Small's group at Yale,

1:37:01.560 --> 1:37:05.760
 but also by the de Araujo group and others,

1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:10.280
 exploring how the reward pathways are altered

1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:12.760
 in various metabolic disorders, et cetera,

1:37:12.760 --> 1:37:14.880
 people suffering from type 2 diabetes.

1:37:16.060 --> 1:37:18.040
 We don't have time to go into all those data now,

1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:21.240
 but the takeaway is that food preference

1:37:21.240 --> 1:37:23.720
 and the ability to reshape these circuits

1:37:23.720 --> 1:37:26.640
 is not disrupted in these people to the point

1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:28.200
 where it can't be rewired.

1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:30.640
 And that's very encouraging because what it means is that

1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:33.320
 for people that are suffering from these syndromes

1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:36.760
 through some simple alterations in dietary choice,

1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:39.860
 provided those are carried out over time

1:37:39.860 --> 1:37:43.080
 and in the correct way by pairing with the foods

1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:46.440
 that will appropriately shift metabolism of the brain,

1:37:46.440 --> 1:37:48.760
 one can actually rewire what they consider

1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:51.480
 not just palatable, but attractive as foods.

1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:55.560
 If you want to learn more about food reward

1:37:55.560 --> 1:37:56.800
 and food reinforcement,

1:37:56.800 --> 1:37:59.120
 because it turns out those are slightly different things,

1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:02.920
 there's a wonderful review written by Ivan de Araujo.

1:38:02.920 --> 1:38:06.040
 They have a middle author, Mark Schachter and Dana Small.

1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:07.840
 It's called Rethinking Food Reward,

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:10.800
 and it was published in the Annual Reviews of Psychology.

1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:12.220
 You can find it very easily online.

1:38:12.220 --> 1:38:14.040
 It was published in 2019.

1:38:14.040 --> 1:38:16.240
 And it's a beautiful deep dive,

1:38:16.240 --> 1:38:18.440
 although quite accessible to most people,

1:38:18.440 --> 1:38:22.520
 about how different foods and the way that we perceive them

1:38:22.520 --> 1:38:24.000
 impacts our brain and body

1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:25.760
 and why we like the things we like

1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:28.020
 and how to reshape what we like.

1:38:28.020 --> 1:38:31.120
 So once again, we've done a fairly extensive deep dive

1:38:31.120 --> 1:38:33.680
 into food and your brain,

1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:36.800
 focusing first on how particular foods

1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:39.560
 and compounds within foods that are available

1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:41.240
 also through supplementation

1:38:41.240 --> 1:38:44.120
 can impact immediate and long-term brain health.

1:38:44.120 --> 1:38:46.760
 Came up with a relatively short list

1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:48.760
 of what I would call super foods,

1:38:48.760 --> 1:38:52.880
 only because there are ample data to support their role

1:38:52.880 --> 1:38:55.260
 in enhancing short and long-term cognition

1:38:55.260 --> 1:38:57.280
 and neuronal health and so on.

1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:00.280
 And we also talked about food preference

1:39:00.280 --> 1:39:02.440
 and why particular tastes

1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:04.240
 and particular events within the gut

1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:06.420
 and particular events within the brain

1:39:06.420 --> 1:39:10.880
 combine to lead us to pursue particular foods

1:39:10.880 --> 1:39:12.680
 and to avoid other foods

1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:15.340
 and how you can leverage those pathways

1:39:15.340 --> 1:39:17.140
 in order to pursue more of the foods

1:39:17.140 --> 1:39:18.640
 that are going to be good for you

1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:20.380
 and good not just for your brain,

1:39:20.380 --> 1:39:22.120
 but for your overall body health

1:39:22.120 --> 1:39:23.980
 and to enjoy them along the way.

1:39:23.980 --> 1:39:26.680

 And there I do neuroscience tutorials

1:39:53.140 --> 1:39:55.200
 that sometimes have overlap with the podcast,

1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:58.060
 but often are original content altogether.

1:39:58.060 --> 1:40:00.920
 We are also Huberman Lab on Twitter.

1:40:00.920 --> 1:40:02.480

1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:16.940
 During today's podcast and on many other previous episodes,

1:40:16.940 --> 1:40:18.800
 we talked about various supplements.

1:40:18.800 --> 1:40:20.980
 One of the major issues with supplements

1:40:20.980 --> 1:40:23.280
 is that supplement companies don't always have

1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:24.760
 the highest quality standards

1:40:24.760 --> 1:40:27.280
 and or the amounts of the supplements

1:40:27.280 --> 1:40:28.380
 that they list on the bottle

1:40:28.380 --> 1:40:30.140
 aren't what actually are contained

1:40:30.140 --> 1:40:33.060
 in the capsules and pills and powders of those supplements.

1:40:33.060 --> 1:40:35.840
 For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:40:35.840 --> 1:40:38.880
 because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency

1:40:38.880 --> 1:40:42.000
 with respect to the quality of the supplements they use

1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.360
 and the quantity of the supplements they use.

1:40:44.360 --> 1:40:46.160
 They've partnered with all the major sports teams

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:47.200
 and with the Mayo Clinic,

1:40:47.200 --> 1:40:48.600
 and we have tremendous confidence

1:40:48.600 --> 1:40:49.940
 in the quality of their supplements.

1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:52.140
