00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.200
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.200 --> 00:13.080
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.080 --> 00:14.980
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.980 --> 00:17.520
 Today, my guest is Dr. Andy Galpin.

00:17.520 --> 00:20.020
 Dr. Galpin is a full and tenured professor

00:20.020 --> 00:21.600
 in the Department of Kinesiology

00:21.600 --> 00:24.160
 at California State University in Fullerton.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.920
 He is also a world expert

00:25.920 --> 00:29.480
 in all things exercise science and kinesiology.

00:29.480 --> 00:30.580
 Today, you are going to hear

00:30.580 --> 00:34.200
 what is essentially a masterclass in how to build fitness,

00:34.200 --> 00:36.960
 no matter what level of fitness you happen to have.

00:36.960 --> 00:38.960
 He talks about how to build endurance

00:38.960 --> 00:40.760
 and the multiple types of endurance.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.200
 He talks about how to build strength and hypertrophy,

00:43.200 --> 00:45.200
 which is the growth of muscle fibers.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.720
 So if you're seeking to get stronger

00:46.720 --> 00:48.960
 or build bigger muscles or build endurance

00:48.960 --> 00:52.160
 or all of those things, today, you're going to learn how.

00:52.160 --> 00:55.080
 You're also going to learn how to build flexibility,

00:55.080 --> 00:57.320
 how to hydrate properly for exercise.

00:57.320 --> 01:00.700
 And we'll also talk about nutrition and supplementation.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.280
 What makes Dr. Galpin so unique is his ability

01:03.280 --> 01:06.120
 to span all levels of exercise science.

01:06.120 --> 01:09.120
 He has the ability to clearly communicate the sets

01:09.120 --> 01:11.400
 and repetition schemes that one would want to follow,

01:11.400 --> 01:13.180
 for instance, to build more strength

01:13.180 --> 01:14.760
 or to build larger muscles.

01:14.760 --> 01:17.960
 He also clearly describes exactly how to train

01:17.960 --> 01:19.760
 if you want to build more endurance

01:19.760 --> 01:22.320
 or enhance cardiovascular function.

01:22.320 --> 01:24.480
 What's highly unique about Dr. Galpin

01:24.480 --> 01:26.080
 and the information he teaches

01:26.080 --> 01:28.560
 and the way he communicates that information

01:28.560 --> 01:31.760
 is that he can take specific recommendations

01:31.760 --> 01:34.100
 of how recreational exercisers

01:34.100 --> 01:36.200
 or even professional athletes ought to train

01:36.200 --> 01:38.640
 for their specific goals and link that

01:38.640 --> 01:40.100
 to specific mechanisms.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.680
 That is the specific changes that need to occur

01:42.680 --> 01:44.720
 in the nervous system and in muscle fibers

01:44.720 --> 01:47.560
 and indeed right down to the genetics of individual cells

01:47.560 --> 01:48.640
 in your brain and body

01:48.640 --> 01:51.760
 in order for those exercise adaptations to occur.

01:51.760 --> 01:54.040
 It's truly rare to find somebody that can span

01:54.040 --> 01:56.200
 so many different levels of analysis

01:56.200 --> 01:58.540
 and who is able to communicate all those levels

01:58.540 --> 02:01.860
 of understanding in such a clear and actionable way.

02:01.860 --> 02:05.380
 Indeed, Dr. Galpin is one of just a handful of people

02:05.380 --> 02:08.880
 to which I and many others look when they want to make sure

02:08.880 --> 02:11.760
 that the information that they're getting about exercise

02:11.760 --> 02:14.480
 is gleaned from quality peer-reviewed studies,

02:14.480 --> 02:16.960
 hands-on experience with a wide variety

02:16.960 --> 02:19.200
 of research subjects, meaning everyday people,

02:19.200 --> 02:20.800
 all the way up to professional athletes

02:20.800 --> 02:22.260
 in a wide variety of sports.

02:22.260 --> 02:24.240
 So it's no surprise that he's not only one

02:24.240 --> 02:25.520
 of the most knowledgeable,

02:25.520 --> 02:28.500
 but also the most trusted voices in exercise science.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.480
 Dr. Galpin is also an avid communicator

02:30.480 --> 02:34.360
 of zero cost to consumer information about exercise science.

02:34.360 --> 02:37.720
 You can find him on Instagram at Dr. Andy Galpin

02:37.720 --> 02:40.300
 and also on Twitter at Dr. Andy Galpin.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.720
 Both places he provides terrific information

02:42.720 --> 02:45.080
 about recent studies, both from his laboratory

02:45.080 --> 02:47.040
 and from other laboratories,

02:47.040 --> 02:48.740
 more in-depth protocols of the sort

02:48.740 --> 02:50.120
 that you'll hear about today.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.520
 So if you're not already following him,

02:51.520 --> 02:52.760
 be sure to do so.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.160
 He provides only the best information.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.760
 He's extremely nuanced and precise and clear

02:57.760 --> 02:59.760
 in delivering that information.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.960
 I'm certain that by the end of today's conversation,

03:01.960 --> 03:04.660
 you'll come away with a tremendous amount of new knowledge

03:04.660 --> 03:07.080
 that you can devote to your exercise pursuits.

03:07.080 --> 03:07.920
 I'm pleased to announce

03:07.920 --> 03:10.760
 that I'm hosting two live events this May.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.280
 The first live event will be hosted

03:12.280 --> 03:14.960
 in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.560
 The second live event will be hosted

03:16.560 --> 03:18.960
 in Portland, Oregon on May 18th.

03:18.960 --> 03:20.960
 Both are part of a lecture series entitled

03:20.960 --> 03:22.560
 The Brain Body Contract,

03:22.560 --> 03:24.280
 during which I will discuss science

03:24.280 --> 03:26.440
 and science-based tools for mental health,

03:26.440 --> 03:28.240
 physical health, and performance.

03:28.240 --> 03:30.000
 And I should point out that while some

03:30.000 --> 03:32.180
 of the material I'll cover will overlap

03:32.180 --> 03:34.960
 with information covered here on the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:34.960 --> 03:36.800
 and on various social media posts,

03:36.800 --> 03:39.960
 most of the information I will cover is going to be distinct

03:39.960 --> 03:42.840
 from information covered on the podcast or elsewhere.

03:42.840 --> 03:45.360
 So once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,

03:45.360 --> 03:46.720
 Portland on May 18th.

03:46.720 --> 03:50.840
 You can access tickets by going to hubermanlab.com slash tour

03:50.840 --> 03:52.120
 and I hope to see you there.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.820
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

03:53.820 --> 03:55.400
 that this podcast is separate

03:55.400 --> 03:57.580
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:57.580 --> 03:59.160
 It is, however, part of my desire

03:59.160 --> 04:01.720
 and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information

04:01.720 --> 04:03.840
 about science and science-related tools

04:03.840 --> 04:05.200
 to the general public.

04:05.200 --> 04:06.280
 In keeping with that theme,

04:06.280 --> 04:09.020
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:09.020 --> 04:11.240
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.760
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

04:12.760 --> 04:15.200
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

04:15.200 --> 04:18.120
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

04:18.120 --> 04:20.520
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:20.520 --> 04:22.240
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

04:22.240 --> 04:23.680
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

04:23.680 --> 04:25.960
 once or twice a day is that it helps me cover

04:25.960 --> 04:27.720
 all of my basic nutritional needs.

04:27.720 --> 04:30.200
 It makes up for any deficiencies that I might have.

04:30.200 --> 04:32.220
 In addition, it has probiotics,

04:32.220 --> 04:34.820
 which are vital for microbiome health.

04:34.820 --> 04:36.680
 I've done a couple of episodes now

04:36.680 --> 04:38.600
 on the so-called gut microbiome

04:38.600 --> 04:41.360
 and the ways in which the microbiome interacts

04:41.360 --> 04:44.440
 with your immune system, with your brain to regulate mood,

04:44.440 --> 04:46.600
 and essentially with every biological system

04:46.600 --> 04:49.360
 relevant to health throughout your brain and body.

04:49.360 --> 04:51.140
 With Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins I need,

04:51.140 --> 04:52.160
 the minerals I need,

04:52.160 --> 04:54.920
 and the probiotics to support my microbiome.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.320
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

04:56.320 --> 04:58.960
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:58.960 --> 05:00.440
 and claim a special offer.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.200
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

05:02.200 --> 05:03.940
 which make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens

05:03.940 --> 05:05.060
 while you're on the road,

05:05.060 --> 05:08.360
 plus a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:08.360 --> 05:10.720
 There are a ton of data now showing that vitamin D3

05:10.720 --> 05:12.960
 is essential for various aspects of our brain

05:12.960 --> 05:15.920
 and body health, even if we're getting a lot of sunshine.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.300
 Many of us are still deficient in vitamin D3,

05:18.300 --> 05:19.760
 and K2 is also important

05:19.760 --> 05:21.920
 because it regulates things like cardiovascular function,

05:21.920 --> 05:24.280
 calcium in the body, and so on.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.080
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

05:27.080 --> 05:29.560
 to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs

05:29.560 --> 05:32.060
 and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:32.060 --> 05:34.740
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.

05:34.740 --> 05:37.040
 Thesis makes what are called nootropics,

05:37.040 --> 05:38.800
 which means smart drugs.

05:38.800 --> 05:42.120
 Now, to be honest, I am not a fan of the term nootropics.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.740
 I don't believe in smart drugs in the sense that

05:44.740 --> 05:46.660
 I don't believe that there's any one substance

05:46.660 --> 05:49.800
 or collection of substances that can make us smarter.

05:49.800 --> 05:52.160
 I do believe based on science, however,

05:52.160 --> 05:53.680
 that there are particular neural circuits

05:53.680 --> 05:56.240
 and brain functions that allow us to be more focused,

05:56.240 --> 05:59.960
 more alert, access creativity, be more motivated, et cetera.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.360
 That's just the way that the brain works.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.880
 Different neural circuits for different brain states.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.220
 And so the idea of a nootropic

06:05.220 --> 06:07.040
 that's just going to make us smarter all around

06:07.040 --> 06:10.280
 fails to acknowledge that smarter is many things, right?

06:10.280 --> 06:12.340
 If you're an artist, you're a musician, you're doing math,

06:12.340 --> 06:14.560
 you're doing accounting, at different part of the day,

06:14.560 --> 06:15.400
 you need to be creative.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.560
 These are all different brain processes.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.080
 Thesis understands this.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.440
 And as far as I know, they're the first nootropics company

06:21.440 --> 06:24.720
 to create targeted nootropics for specific outcomes.

06:24.720 --> 06:26.260
 They only use the highest quality ingredients,

06:26.260 --> 06:27.600
 which of course is essential.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.280
 Some of those I've talked about on the podcast,

06:29.280 --> 06:33.180
 things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylserine.

06:33.180 --> 06:35.260
 They give you the ability to try several different blends

06:35.260 --> 06:36.520
 over the course of a month,

06:36.520 --> 06:38.260
 discover which nootropics work best

06:38.260 --> 06:41.560
 for your unique brain chemistry and genetics and goals.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.480
 And with that personalization,

06:43.480 --> 06:46.380
 design a kit of nootropics that's ideal

06:46.380 --> 06:48.840
 for the different brain and body states you want to access.

06:48.840 --> 06:51.160
 I've been using thesis for more than six months now,

06:51.160 --> 06:53.080
 and I can confidently say that nootropics

06:53.080 --> 06:54.760
 have been a total game changer.

06:54.760 --> 06:57.440
 My go-to formula is the clarity formula,

06:57.440 --> 07:00.580
 or sometimes I'll use their energy formula before training.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.620
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

07:02.620 --> 07:05.560
 go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

07:05.560 --> 07:06.540
 take a three minute quiz,

07:06.540 --> 07:08.540
 and thesis will send you four different formulas

07:08.540 --> 07:10.180
 to try in your first month.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.360
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman,

07:16.120 --> 07:19.080
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

07:19.080 --> 07:21.740
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

07:21.740 --> 07:24.360
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

07:24.360 --> 07:25.920
 to help you better understand your body

07:25.920 --> 07:27.820
 and help you reach your health goals.

07:27.820 --> 07:30.600
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

07:30.600 --> 07:32.920
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

07:32.920 --> 07:35.000
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

07:35.000 --> 07:37.520
 can only be assessed with a quality blood test.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.140
 What's unique about Inside Tracker is that

07:39.140 --> 07:41.400
 while there are a lot of different tests out there

07:41.400 --> 07:44.080
 for hormones and metabolic factors, et cetera,

07:44.080 --> 07:44.920
 with Inside Tracker,

07:44.920 --> 07:47.220
 you get the numbers back in terms of your levels,

07:47.220 --> 07:49.240
 but they also give you very clear directives

07:49.240 --> 07:51.920
 in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, and supplementation

07:51.920 --> 07:54.560
 that can help you bring those values into the ranges

07:54.560 --> 07:56.640
 that are best for you and your health goals.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.880
 And that's very different than a lot of the other programs

07:58.880 --> 07:59.880
 where you get a lot of information,

07:59.880 --> 08:02.040
 but you don't really know what to do with that information.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.700
 Inside Tracker makes that all very easy to understand

08:04.700 --> 08:07.600
 and very actionable based on the very easy to use

08:07.600 --> 08:09.300
 dashboard at Inside Tracker.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.760
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

08:10.760 --> 08:13.320

 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

08:18.080 --> 08:21.680
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin.

08:21.680 --> 08:25.280
 Welcome, Dr. Professor Andy Galpin.

08:25.280 --> 08:26.380
 It's been a long time coming.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.440
 We have friends in common,

08:27.440 --> 08:28.600
 but this is actually the first time

08:28.600 --> 08:29.940
 we've sat down face to face.

08:29.940 --> 08:31.760
 Yeah, I'm very excited.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.360
 Yeah, there are only a handful,

08:33.360 --> 08:38.360
 meaning about three or four people who I trust enough

08:38.360 --> 08:42.720
 in the exercise physiology space that when they speak,

08:42.720 --> 08:45.280
 I not only listen, but I modify my protocols.

08:45.280 --> 08:47.420
 And you are among those three or four people.

08:47.420 --> 08:50.320
 So first of all, a debt of gratitude.

08:50.320 --> 08:51.440
 Thank you.

08:51.440 --> 08:54.240
 You've greatly shaped the protocols that I use.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.020
 And I know there's far more for me and for others to learn.

08:58.020 --> 09:01.780
 So you're a professor, you teach in university,

09:01.780 --> 09:05.560
 and you have a tremendous range of levels of exploration.

09:05.560 --> 09:08.720
 Muscle biopsy, literally images down the microscope,

09:08.720 --> 09:11.380
 all the way to training professional athletes

09:11.380 --> 09:12.800
 and everything in between.

09:12.800 --> 09:14.960
 So you are truly an N of one.

09:14.960 --> 09:17.680
 And just to start us off,

09:17.680 --> 09:20.080
 I would love to have you share with us

09:20.080 --> 09:22.400
 what you think most everybody,

09:22.400 --> 09:24.100
 or even everybody should know

09:24.100 --> 09:27.720
 about principles of strength training,

09:27.720 --> 09:30.480
 principles of endurance training,

09:30.480 --> 09:34.760
 and principles of let's call it hypertrophy power

09:34.760 --> 09:37.200
 and the other sort of categories of training.

09:37.200 --> 09:38.640
 And this could be very top contour,

09:38.640 --> 09:40.920
 but what do you think everybody on planet earth

09:40.920 --> 09:42.580
 should know about these categories

09:42.580 --> 09:45.000
 of personal and athletic development?

09:45.000 --> 09:46.880
 Well, that's a great first question.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.200
 Holy cow, I think I'll start it this way.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.840
 I tend to think about,

09:52.840 --> 09:54.480
 there's about nine different adaptations

09:54.480 --> 09:56.160
 you can get from exercise.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.860
 Fat loss is not one of those.

09:57.860 --> 09:58.840
 It is a by-product,

09:58.840 --> 10:01.480
 but that's not really what I'm getting at.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.600
 And so we can kind of categorize everything like that.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.080
 And what we can talk about

10:05.080 --> 10:06.040
 are what are the concepts

10:06.040 --> 10:08.760
 that you need to hit within each one.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.500
 And then you could have infinite discussion

10:10.500 --> 10:11.760
 of the different methodologies, right?

10:11.760 --> 10:13.760
 And so that first thing to hit

10:13.760 --> 10:16.520
 is the concepts are actually fairly few,

10:16.520 --> 10:17.800
 but the methods are many, right?

10:17.800 --> 10:21.480
 People have said that in iterations throughout time.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.120
 So if you walk from the very beginning,

10:23.120 --> 10:24.400
 the first one to think about

10:24.400 --> 10:25.960
 is what we'll just call skill.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.780
 So this is improving anything from say a golf swing

10:28.780 --> 10:30.840
 to a squatting technique to running.

10:30.840 --> 10:33.000
 And this is just simply moving mechanically

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
 how you want your body to move.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.040
 I'm just gonna globally call that skill.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.780
 From there, we're gonna get into speed.

10:38.780 --> 10:41.240
 So this is moving as fast as possible.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.780
 The next one is power.

10:42.780 --> 10:44.780
 And power is a function of speed,

10:44.780 --> 10:47.840
 but it's also a function of the next one, which is strength.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.540
 So if you actually multiply strength by speed,

10:50.540 --> 10:52.120
 you get power.

10:52.120 --> 10:54.000
 And the reason I'm making this distinction, by the way,

10:54.000 --> 10:55.340
 is some of these are very close

10:55.340 --> 10:57.680
 and I'm going in a specific order on purpose here.

10:57.680 --> 11:00.480
 For example, power is, like I just said,

11:00.480 --> 11:01.700
 it's a function of speed and strength.

11:01.700 --> 11:05.680
 So if you improve speed, you've also likely improved power,

11:05.680 --> 11:07.240
 but not necessarily, right?

11:07.240 --> 11:09.580
 Cause it could have come from the force direction either.

11:09.580 --> 11:10.520
 So there's carry over.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.800
 So like a lot of things that you would do

11:11.800 --> 11:14.380
 for the development of strength and power,

11:15.720 --> 11:17.880
 they are somewhat similar, but then there's differences,

11:17.880 --> 11:18.720
 right?

11:18.720 --> 11:20.760
 So things that you would do correctly for power

11:20.760 --> 11:23.680
 would really not develop much strength and vice versa.

11:23.680 --> 11:26.000
 So we can get into all these details later.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.240
 Once you get past strength,

11:27.240 --> 11:29.400
 and the next one kind of down the list is hypertrophy.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.580
 This is muscle size, right?

11:30.580 --> 11:33.560
 Growing muscle mass is one way to think about it.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.200
 After hypertrophy, you get into these categories

11:36.200 --> 11:37.560
 of the next one is,

11:37.560 --> 11:40.080
 these are all globally endurance based issues.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.760
 And the very first one is called muscular endurance.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.840
 So this is your ability to do,

11:43.840 --> 11:46.240
 how many pushups can you do in one minute?

11:46.240 --> 11:47.880
 You know, things like that.

11:47.880 --> 11:51.400
 Past muscular endurance,

11:51.400 --> 11:53.320
 you're now into more of an energetic

11:53.320 --> 11:55.200
 or even cardiovascular fatigue.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.740
 So you've left the local muscle

11:56.740 --> 11:59.440
 and you're now into the entire physiological system

11:59.440 --> 12:02.640
 and its ability to produce and sustain work.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.640
 And we can get into a bunch of differentiations

12:04.640 --> 12:05.520
 with an endurance,

12:05.520 --> 12:08.200
 but just to keep it really simple right now,

12:08.200 --> 12:11.160
 the very first one, think about this as,

12:11.160 --> 12:13.160
 I call this anaerobic power, right?

12:13.160 --> 12:16.320
 So this is your ability to produce a lot of work

12:16.320 --> 12:19.600
 for say 30 seconds to maybe one minute,

12:19.600 --> 12:21.520
 kind of two minutes like that.

12:21.520 --> 12:23.520
 The next one down then is more closely aligned

12:23.520 --> 12:25.560
 to what we'll call your VO2 max.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.720
 So this is your ability to kind of do the same thing,

12:27.720 --> 12:31.540
 but more of a time domain of say three to 12 minutes.

12:31.540 --> 12:33.280
 So this is gonna be a maximum heart rate,

12:33.280 --> 12:36.600
 but it's gonna be well past just max heart rate.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.440
 Then after that,

12:37.440 --> 12:39.280
 we have what I call long duration endurance.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.520
 So this is your ability to sustain work.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.040
 The time domain doesn't matter

12:43.040 --> 12:44.860
 in terms of how fast you're going.

12:44.860 --> 12:46.820
 It's how long can you sustain work?

12:46.820 --> 12:50.780
 This is 30 plus minutes of no break like that.

12:50.780 --> 12:53.180
 So as just an high level overview,

12:53.180 --> 12:56.280
 those are the different things you can target.

12:56.280 --> 12:58.560
 And again, some of those cross over

12:58.560 --> 13:00.320
 and some are actually a little bit

13:00.320 --> 13:01.400
 contrary to the other ones.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.840
 So pushing towards one

13:02.840 --> 13:05.000
 is maybe gonna sacrifice something else.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.680
 So as an overall start,

13:06.680 --> 13:08.780
 that's really what we're looking at.

13:08.780 --> 13:09.920
 Within all of those though,

13:09.920 --> 13:12.280
 they do have similar concepts in terms of,

13:12.280 --> 13:14.960
 there's a handful of things you have got to do

13:14.960 --> 13:16.560
 to make all of those things work.

13:16.560 --> 13:18.280
 And we could talk about as many of those as you want,

13:18.280 --> 13:21.240
 but one of them is functionally called progressive overload.

13:22.380 --> 13:25.080
 So whichever one you're trying to improve at,

13:25.080 --> 13:26.960
 if you want to continue to improve,

13:26.960 --> 13:29.460
 you have to have some method of overload.

13:29.460 --> 13:32.500
 And as you well know, you've talked about a lot,

13:32.500 --> 13:34.580
 adaptation physiologically happens

13:34.580 --> 13:36.360
 as a by-product of stress.

13:36.360 --> 13:37.720
 So you have to push a system.

13:37.720 --> 13:38.720
 So if you continue to do,

13:38.720 --> 13:41.400
 say the exact same workout over time,

13:41.400 --> 13:43.280
 you better not expect much improvement.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.280
 You can keep maintenance,

13:44.280 --> 13:46.940
 but you're not going to be adding additional stress.

13:46.940 --> 13:48.180
 So in general,

13:48.180 --> 13:50.060
 you have to have some sort of progressive overload.

13:50.060 --> 13:51.080
 And we can talk in detail

13:51.080 --> 13:53.160
 about what that means for each category,

13:53.160 --> 13:55.440
 but this could come from adding more weights.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.800
 This could come from adding more repetitions.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.700
 It could come from doing it more often in a week.

14:00.700 --> 14:04.040
 It could come from adding complexity to the movement.

14:04.040 --> 14:05.760
 So going from say a partial range of motion

14:05.760 --> 14:08.440
 to a full range of motion or adding other variables.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.760
 So there's a lot of different ways to progress,

14:10.760 --> 14:13.340
 but you have to have some sort of movement forward.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.680
 So if you have this kind of routine

14:14.680 --> 14:17.260
 where you've built Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday

14:17.260 --> 14:20.440
 or something, and you just do that infinitely,

14:20.440 --> 14:21.780
 you're not going to get very far.

14:21.780 --> 14:24.240
 So that's, I guess, the most high level overview

14:24.240 --> 14:26.600
 of all the things people can go after.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.440
 And then we can go from whatever direction

14:28.440 --> 14:29.840
 you want from there.

14:29.840 --> 14:31.200
 Well, I'd love to do the deep dive

14:31.200 --> 14:34.520
 on each one of these for several hours.

14:34.520 --> 14:39.040
 But, and I imagine that over time we probably will.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.120
 I'd love to chat about a couple of these

14:42.120 --> 14:43.120
 in a bit more depth.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.000
 So in terms of defining

14:45.000 --> 14:47.880
 what the progressive overload variables are

14:47.880 --> 14:49.200
 for these different categories,

14:49.200 --> 14:53.560
 maybe we could hit the two most common combinations

14:53.560 --> 14:54.440
 of these nine things.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.440
 The first one being strength and hypertrophy.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.920
 And maybe we could lump power in there.

15:00.920 --> 15:04.320
 Maybe not, you're the exercise physiologist.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.360
 But strength and hypertrophy,

15:05.360 --> 15:07.500
 which at least bear some relationship.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.280
 And then maybe separately,

15:09.280 --> 15:12.840
 we could explore sustained work endurance,

15:12.840 --> 15:14.600
 this 30 minutes or longer continuously,

15:14.600 --> 15:17.700
 because I think many people train in that regime.

15:17.700 --> 15:22.700
 And probably something like the VO2 max anaerobic as well,

15:23.440 --> 15:25.080
 because I know that a number of people now

15:25.080 --> 15:26.700
 incorporate so-called hit

15:26.700 --> 15:28.260
 or high intensity interval training.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.440
 I think with the hopes of either shortening their workouts

15:31.440 --> 15:35.400
 and or gaining some additional cardiovascular benefit.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.280
 So if we could start with strength and hypertrophy,

15:38.280 --> 15:40.480
 I know many people want to be stronger.

15:40.480 --> 15:42.000
 They want to grow larger muscles

15:42.000 --> 15:43.780
 or at least maintain what they have.

15:43.780 --> 15:46.580
 So what are the progressive overload principles

15:46.580 --> 15:49.800
 that are most effective over time

15:49.800 --> 15:51.560
 for strength and hypertrophy?

15:51.560 --> 15:54.720
 Yeah, okay, so I'll actually go a little step back.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.580
 With every one of those categories I talked about,

15:57.580 --> 16:00.080
 you have what we call your modifiable variables.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.440
 So this is a very short list

16:01.440 --> 16:04.940
 of all the things you can modify,

16:04.940 --> 16:06.520
 the different variables within your workout

16:06.520 --> 16:08.780
 that can be modified that will change the outcome.

16:08.780 --> 16:11.720
 Fancy way of saying, if you do this differently,

16:11.720 --> 16:14.080
 then you're gonna get a different result.

16:14.080 --> 16:15.600
 So modifiable variables.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.560
 The very first one of those is called choice.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.000
 So this is the exercise choice that you select.

16:20.000 --> 16:23.560
 Now, one of, I'm gonna go double back here.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.080
 So I'm kind of doing a little bit of inception.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.520
 So follow me here as I'm going up a layer

16:26.520 --> 16:27.960
 to come down a couple layers.

16:29.560 --> 16:31.840
 I have these fundamental laws of strength and conditioning

16:31.840 --> 16:35.240
 that are kind of like a little bit of a joke,

16:35.240 --> 16:36.960
 but progressive overload is one of those laws.

16:36.960 --> 16:40.760
 Another one of those laws is your exercises themselves

16:40.760 --> 16:42.840
 do not determine adaptations.

16:42.840 --> 16:43.780
 So here's what I mean.

16:43.780 --> 16:45.280
 If you're like, I want to get stronger,

16:45.280 --> 16:47.400
 you can't select an exercise.

16:47.400 --> 16:49.680
 That doesn't determine you getting strong.

16:49.680 --> 16:51.800
 If you don't do the exercise correctly,

16:51.800 --> 16:53.560
 and I'm not even referring to the technique,

16:53.560 --> 16:55.100
 that of course matters,

16:55.100 --> 16:57.620
 but if you don't execute it in the right fashion,

16:57.620 --> 16:59.100
 then you're not going to get that adaptation.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.540
 So if you choose, I want to get stronger,

17:00.540 --> 17:01.720
 I'm gonna do a bench press.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.580
 Well, if you do the wrong set range,

17:03.580 --> 17:05.120
 the wrong repetition range, the wrong speed,

17:05.120 --> 17:05.960
 you won't get strength.

17:05.960 --> 17:06.940
 You maybe get muscular endurance

17:06.940 --> 17:08.680
 and very little strength adaptation.

17:08.680 --> 17:11.540
 So the exercise selection itself is important,

17:11.540 --> 17:14.280
 but it does not determine the outcome adaptation.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.080
 So the very first thing that you need to think about

17:16.080 --> 17:18.560
 if you're like, I want to get stronger or add muscle

17:18.560 --> 17:20.840
 is not the exercise choice, right?

17:20.840 --> 17:22.480
 It is the application of the exercise.

17:22.480 --> 17:23.320
 What are the sets?

17:23.320 --> 17:24.140
 What are the reps?

17:24.140 --> 17:25.880
 What are the rest ranges that you're using?

17:25.880 --> 17:28.280
 That's gonna be your primary determinant.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.320
 Now, some exercises are certainly better

17:31.320 --> 17:32.160
 for some adaptations.

17:32.160 --> 17:35.720
 For example, a deadlift is probably not a great exercise

17:35.720 --> 17:37.360
 to do for long duration endurance.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.260
 Like you could theoretically do 30 straight minutes

17:39.260 --> 17:42.120
 of deadlifting, but it's probably not our best choice, right?

17:42.120 --> 17:44.360
 It's probably a pretty good choice for strength development,

17:44.360 --> 17:46.080
 right, because you're gonna do a low repetition

17:46.080 --> 17:47.360
 high set range.

17:47.360 --> 17:51.760
 You could theoretically do bicep curls for power,

17:51.760 --> 17:53.560
 but probably not your best choice, right?

17:53.560 --> 17:55.960
 Single joint isolation movement is not the best

17:55.960 --> 17:57.000
 for developing power.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
 If you've ever done a bicep curl as fast

17:59.000 --> 18:01.760
 as you possibly can, like that's not gonna go well.

18:01.760 --> 18:05.720
 So in theory, any exercise can produce any adaptation

18:05.720 --> 18:08.400
 given the execution is performed properly.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.000
 So now that we've understood that a little bit,

18:11.000 --> 18:14.280
 the exercise itself does not determine the adaptation.

18:14.280 --> 18:17.040
 Coming within each one of these categories,

18:17.040 --> 18:18.840
 exercise choice is an important variable

18:18.840 --> 18:21.220
 because it does lend you to things

18:21.220 --> 18:23.240
 like what movement pattern you're in.

18:23.240 --> 18:26.120
 So in other words, if you wanna get stronger

18:26.120 --> 18:28.720
 and you're thinking, okay, what exercise do I do?

18:28.720 --> 18:31.180
 You need to think a little bit about

18:31.180 --> 18:32.620
 what muscle groups do I wanna use?

18:32.620 --> 18:35.700
 And that's gonna be leading you towards the exercise choice.

18:35.700 --> 18:38.400
 For example, I wanna use my quads more.

18:38.400 --> 18:39.660
 Okay, fine.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.800
 Maybe you're gonna choose more of a front squat

18:41.800 --> 18:43.160
 type of variation, a goblet squat.

18:43.160 --> 18:45.360
 So the bar, the load is in front of you.

18:45.360 --> 18:47.400
 If you wanna emphasize maybe more of your hamstrings

18:47.400 --> 18:49.880
 and glutes, you're gonna maybe put a barbell on your back

18:49.880 --> 18:51.180
 or do a different one.

18:51.180 --> 18:54.980
 So the exercise choice is important to the prescription

18:54.980 --> 18:57.660
 because it's gonna determine a lot of your success.

18:57.660 --> 19:00.440
 Okay, another kind of simpler way to think about this.

19:01.380 --> 19:04.520
 If you're a beginner or moderate to intermediate,

19:04.520 --> 19:06.580
 or maybe you don't have a coach,

19:06.580 --> 19:09.800
 you probably wanna hedge towards an exercise selection

19:09.800 --> 19:12.280
 that is a little bit easier technically.

19:12.280 --> 19:14.000
 So you maybe don't wanna do a barbell back squat.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.880
 It's actually a pretty complicated movement.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.420
 Maybe you wanna do a little bit more of,

19:18.420 --> 19:20.900
 again, a goblet squat or even use some machines

19:20.900 --> 19:22.860
 or a split squat, something that's a little bit simpler

19:22.860 --> 19:23.980
 because you don't have a coach,

19:23.980 --> 19:25.980
 you're not a professional athlete.

19:25.980 --> 19:27.480
 The likelihood of success is higher

19:27.480 --> 19:30.000
 and the risk has now gone lower.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.940
 So the very first variable within all of these

19:31.940 --> 19:33.540
 is the exercise choice.

19:33.540 --> 19:34.980
 The second one is the intensity.

19:34.980 --> 19:39.100
 And that refers to, in this context, not perceived effort.

19:39.100 --> 19:40.940
 Like, wow, that was a really intense workout.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.460
 It is quite literally either a percentage

19:42.460 --> 19:44.180
 of your one rep at max

19:44.180 --> 19:46.620
 or a percentage of your maximum heart rate or VO2 max.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.780
 So for the strength-based things,

19:48.780 --> 19:50.180
 you wanna think about what's the percentage

19:50.180 --> 19:51.880
 of the maximum weight I could lift one time.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.500
 And that's what we're gonna call one rep max.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.140
 Or it's a percentage of my heart rate, right?

19:56.140 --> 19:57.540
 So if I tell you to get on a bike

19:57.540 --> 20:00.300
 and I want you to do intervals and I want you at 75%,

20:00.300 --> 20:02.900
 I'm typically referring to 75% of your max heart rate

20:02.900 --> 20:04.820
 or VO2 max or something like that.

20:04.820 --> 20:07.380
 If I tell you to do squats at 75%,

20:07.380 --> 20:09.480
 that means 75% of the maximum amount of weight

20:09.480 --> 20:12.700
 you could lift one time or close.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.780
 In terms of determining one rep max,

20:14.780 --> 20:17.700
 I confess I've never actually taken the one rep max

20:17.700 --> 20:19.140
 for any exercise,

20:19.140 --> 20:22.300
 but I have some internal sense of what that might be

20:22.300 --> 20:24.620
 or what range it might be.

20:24.620 --> 20:27.500
 Is it necessary for people to assess

20:27.500 --> 20:29.660
 their one repetition maximum

20:29.660 --> 20:32.840
 before going into these sorts of programs?

20:32.840 --> 20:33.860
 No, not at all.

20:33.860 --> 20:38.860
 I think a more intuitive way is to take a repetition range.

20:39.940 --> 20:41.260
 Well, you can do this a couple of different ways.

20:41.260 --> 20:44.080
 So there are equations you can run

20:44.080 --> 20:45.940
 and you can just Google these anywhere.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.500
 And these are called conversion charts.

20:47.500 --> 20:48.820
 And so it says, okay,

20:48.820 --> 20:51.200
 if I did 75 pounds on my bench press

20:51.200 --> 20:52.800
 and I did it eight times,

20:52.800 --> 20:54.220
 you can just run an estimate to say,

20:54.220 --> 20:55.700
 okay, you're probably going to be able to bench

20:55.700 --> 20:58.740
 about 95 pounds for one rep max or something.

20:58.740 --> 21:00.880
 So that's a very easy conversion chart.

21:00.880 --> 21:02.700
 So just pick a load that you feel comfortable with,

21:02.700 --> 21:05.860
 but it's kind of heavy, but not like crazy heavy.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.620
 And do as many repetitions as you can.

21:07.620 --> 21:08.980
 What a really good technique.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.080
 And then look what that number would be.

21:11.080 --> 21:11.920
 So conversion charts-

21:11.920 --> 21:14.680
 Are they safer than doing one repetition maximum?

21:14.680 --> 21:17.980
 For the general public who has, again, no coaching,

21:17.980 --> 21:18.800
 it's safer.

21:18.800 --> 21:20.800
 For a professional athlete, it's not any safer,

21:20.800 --> 21:22.860
 but, or not even a professional athlete,

21:22.860 --> 21:24.700
 but a trained person with a coach.

21:24.700 --> 21:25.900
 But for most people, yeah,

21:25.900 --> 21:27.060
 that's a good way to go about it.

21:27.060 --> 21:30.040
 You can also just kind of do it with feel

21:30.040 --> 21:31.560
 in the sense that,

21:31.560 --> 21:34.180
 say you want to do a set of five repetitions

21:34.180 --> 21:36.260
 and you do the load and you think,

21:36.260 --> 21:38.020
 I could have done one or two more.

21:38.020 --> 21:39.540
 And then you kind of have an idea

21:39.540 --> 21:41.460
 of what that number is going to be.

21:41.460 --> 21:43.140
 If you think, man, that last one,

21:43.140 --> 21:45.620
 I had to kind of really, really, really get after it,

21:45.620 --> 21:50.100
 then maybe just call that that number, right?

21:50.100 --> 21:51.780
 So you don't have to get overly concerned.

21:51.780 --> 21:55.000
 In fact, when we start getting into these number ranges,

21:55.000 --> 21:57.060
 you're going to see that they're all ranges.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.500
 We're not going to give a specific 95%

21:59.500 --> 22:01.140
 for one of these exact reasons.

22:01.140 --> 22:03.820
 It's not that precise for most of them.

22:03.820 --> 22:05.140
 In fact, some of them, like hypertrophy,

22:05.140 --> 22:08.740
 have enormous ranges that you almost can't miss.

22:08.740 --> 22:11.080
 So the intensity in that case doesn't even matter

22:11.080 --> 22:11.920
 for the most part,

22:11.920 --> 22:14.320
 because that's not the primary determinant.

22:14.320 --> 22:15.700
 Some of these you're going to see intensity

22:15.700 --> 22:16.540
 is the determinant,

22:16.540 --> 22:18.120
 and some of these you're going to see volume

22:18.120 --> 22:19.320
 is the true determinant.

22:20.460 --> 22:22.740
 So intensity though is the second one.

22:22.740 --> 22:24.220
 Choice was the very first one,

22:25.260 --> 22:26.620
 manipulatable variable.

22:26.620 --> 22:28.500
 Intensity was the second one.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.060
 The third one is what we call volume.

22:30.060 --> 22:31.300
 And so this is just how many reps

22:31.300 --> 22:32.620
 and how many sets are you doing, right?

22:32.620 --> 22:33.900
 So if you're going to do three sets of 10,

22:33.900 --> 22:36.180
 that volume would be 30, right?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.940
 Five sets of five, that volume is 25.

22:37.940 --> 22:39.740
 It's just a simple equation.

22:39.740 --> 22:41.940
 How much work are you totally doing?

22:41.940 --> 22:44.140
 The next one past that is called rest intervals.

22:44.140 --> 22:45.580
 So this is the amount of time you're taking

22:45.580 --> 22:47.160
 in between typically a set.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.840
 Then from there, you have progression,

22:49.840 --> 22:50.940
 which is what we started to talk about,

22:50.940 --> 22:51.940
 this progressive overload.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.020
 Are you increasing by weight or reps

22:54.020 --> 22:58.140
 or rest intervals or complexity or whatever?

22:58.140 --> 23:00.900
 So all of those things can be changed

23:02.660 --> 23:03.980
 as a method of progression.

23:03.980 --> 23:06.580
 And so maybe you want to go progressing

23:06.580 --> 23:08.380
 from a single joint exercise,

23:08.380 --> 23:11.380
 like a leg extension on a machine,

23:11.380 --> 23:12.660
 and you want to progress by moving

23:12.660 --> 23:15.860
 to a whole body movement like a squat.

23:15.860 --> 23:18.300
 That in and of itself, you don't have to change the load

23:18.300 --> 23:19.660
 or the reps or the rest.

23:19.660 --> 23:22.120
 That is a representation of progressive overload.

23:22.120 --> 23:23.940
 And it's probably a pretty good place to start

23:23.940 --> 23:26.780
 because number one, especially for beginners,

23:26.780 --> 23:29.820
 you want to make sure that the movement pattern is correct.

23:29.820 --> 23:30.920
 Don't worry about intensity.

23:30.920 --> 23:33.060
 Don't worry about rep ranges or any of these things.

23:33.060 --> 23:35.220
 You need to learn to move correctly

23:35.220 --> 23:37.060
 and you need to give your body some time

23:37.060 --> 23:39.020
 to develop some tissue tolerance

23:39.020 --> 23:41.740
 so that you're not getting overtly sore.

23:41.740 --> 23:44.320
 In general, soreness is a terrible proxy

23:44.320 --> 23:45.660
 for exercise quality.

23:45.660 --> 23:47.580
 It's a really bad way to estimate

23:47.580 --> 23:48.940
 whether it was a good or a bad workout,

23:48.940 --> 23:51.880
 especially for people in that beginner to middle

23:51.880 --> 23:52.720
 to moderate.

23:52.720 --> 23:55.100
 In fact, even for our professional athletes,

23:55.100 --> 23:57.800
 we do not use soreness as a metric of a good workout.

23:58.820 --> 24:01.060
 It's a really bad idea for a bunch of reasons.

24:02.180 --> 24:03.960
 On the same token, because stress is required

24:03.960 --> 24:06.820
 for adaptation, you don't want to leave at the gym

24:06.820 --> 24:09.380
 and feel like, I don't really do much.

24:09.380 --> 24:10.220
 There has to be there.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.860
 So if you think about soreness on a scale of one to 10,

24:12.860 --> 24:14.660
 you probably want to spend most of your time

24:14.660 --> 24:16.180
 in like the three.

24:16.180 --> 24:19.260
 You mean post-exercise, in between workouts.

24:19.260 --> 24:20.100
 Totally.

24:20.100 --> 24:23.100
 And I know we'll talk about recovery extensively later,

24:23.100 --> 24:27.360
 but if one body part or set of body parts is sore,

24:27.360 --> 24:30.980
 is that an indication that one should stay out of training?

24:30.980 --> 24:34.120
 I would imagine the answer is no in most cases.

24:35.180 --> 24:39.780
 And secondarily to that, if a particular muscle is sore,

24:39.780 --> 24:41.620
 does that mean that muscle is not ready

24:41.620 --> 24:42.740
 to be trained again?

24:42.740 --> 24:44.980
 Yeah, the answer to both of those is the same,

24:44.980 --> 24:46.780
 which is no, right?

24:46.780 --> 24:48.880
 You can certainly train a sore muscle.

24:48.880 --> 24:52.820
 You need to, I guess, have a little bit of feel on that.

24:52.820 --> 24:54.980
 So if you're a sore of like,

24:54.980 --> 24:56.600
 okay, and you're moving around a little bit

24:56.600 --> 24:58.060
 and you're like, man, this is a little bit sore,

24:58.060 --> 24:59.020
 you can train.

24:59.020 --> 25:01.980
 If you're like, I can't sit on the couch without crying

25:01.980 --> 25:03.380
 because my glutes are so sore,

25:03.380 --> 25:06.460
 like we probably don't need to train again, right?

25:06.460 --> 25:08.060
 Does whimpering count as crying?

25:09.660 --> 25:12.160
 Yeah, in that particular case, I'd say,

25:12.160 --> 25:14.780
 you've actually gone to a place of detriment

25:14.780 --> 25:17.620
 because now you're going to have to skip a training session

25:17.620 --> 25:18.680
 and now you're behind.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.380
 So your actual total volume, say across the month,

25:21.380 --> 25:23.620
 is actually gonna be lower because you went way too hard

25:23.620 --> 25:24.780
 in those workouts,

25:24.780 --> 25:27.060
 had to take too many days off in between.

25:27.060 --> 25:28.700
 You're going to see that you're going to cover less distance

25:28.700 --> 25:31.780
 over the course of a month or six months or even a year.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.560
 So you want to walk a pretty fine line.

25:33.560 --> 25:35.980
 And for most people, I would say hedge a little bit

25:35.980 --> 25:38.980
 on the side of less sore than more sore

25:38.980 --> 25:41.440
 because frequency is very, very important

25:41.440 --> 25:43.300
 for almost all these adaptations.

25:43.300 --> 25:44.660
 At training frequency.

25:44.660 --> 25:47.060
 Which is the last modifiable variable, right?

25:47.060 --> 25:50.340
 Frequency, which is how many times per week are you,

25:50.340 --> 25:51.940
 are you doing that thing?

25:51.940 --> 25:55.780
 So those are kind of our global things

25:55.780 --> 25:56.600
 that we can play with.

25:56.600 --> 25:57.940
 So when I'm trying to manipulate

25:57.940 --> 26:00.700
 and get strength versus hypertrophy,

26:00.700 --> 26:03.420
 or you know what, I want like a little bit of both,

26:03.420 --> 26:04.720
 all those variables are the things

26:04.720 --> 26:05.560
 that are going through my mind.

26:05.560 --> 26:07.540
 Which one do I need to move in which direction

26:07.540 --> 26:09.060
 so that I can get this outcome

26:09.060 --> 26:11.540
 and not this outcome over here?

26:11.540 --> 26:13.600
 For example, some folks might want to get stronger,

26:13.600 --> 26:15.820
 but not put muscle mass on.

26:15.820 --> 26:17.600
 Some folks are just kind of want both.

26:17.600 --> 26:18.860
 And that's a lot of the general public.

26:18.860 --> 26:20.500
 I want to get a little stronger and a little bit more muscle.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.320
 Great.

26:21.320 --> 26:23.060
 But there are instances where people

26:23.060 --> 26:26.540
 for performance reasons or for purely personal preference,

26:26.540 --> 26:28.380
 like I don't want to get any more muscle, great,

26:28.380 --> 26:29.820
 but I want to get stronger.

26:29.820 --> 26:30.660
 Awesome.

26:30.660 --> 26:31.860
 If you manipulate those variables correctly,

26:31.860 --> 26:33.300
 you can get exactly that.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.260
 Very little development in muscle size

26:35.260 --> 26:36.820
 and a lot of development in strength.

26:36.820 --> 26:39.300
 And this is why we continue to break world records

26:39.300 --> 26:40.980
 in sports like powerlifting and weightlifting

26:40.980 --> 26:42.500
 that have weight classes.

26:42.500 --> 26:44.260
 So there's a top number that we can hit

26:44.260 --> 26:45.540
 in terms of body size,

26:45.540 --> 26:47.980
 but yet we continue to get stronger and faster.

26:47.980 --> 26:49.780
 So this is very possible if you understand

26:49.780 --> 26:52.300
 how to manipulate all those variables.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.900
 So that being said, we can start off with,

26:53.900 --> 26:55.020
 you wanted to go strength and-

26:55.020 --> 26:55.860
 Yeah, strength.

26:55.860 --> 26:57.740
 And I love that you mentioned the fact

26:57.740 --> 26:59.440
 that it is possible to increase strength

26:59.440 --> 27:01.180
 without increasing muscle size,

27:01.180 --> 27:02.280
 at least not dramatically,

27:02.280 --> 27:04.420
 because I think it's not just weight class athletes.

27:04.420 --> 27:08.120
 I know a lot of people who, for aesthetic reasons,

27:08.120 --> 27:09.200
 they'd like to be stronger.

27:09.200 --> 27:10.720
 They're hearing that having strong bones

27:10.720 --> 27:11.820
 and strong muscles and tendons,

27:11.820 --> 27:13.860
 it's great for longevity and for avoiding injury

27:13.860 --> 27:15.980
 and so many other features of life.

27:15.980 --> 27:20.460
 And yet they don't want to fill out progressively larger

27:20.460 --> 27:23.060
 and larger sizes of clothing.

27:23.060 --> 27:24.620
 And we can go harder to the mechanisms

27:24.620 --> 27:25.460
 on that piece if you want,

27:25.460 --> 27:26.920
 and we can save that and come back to it.

27:26.920 --> 27:27.880
 Sure.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.980
 What I'd love to, both,

27:29.980 --> 27:31.460
 what I'd love to know,

27:31.460 --> 27:34.660
 if we could define some of these modifiable variables

27:34.660 --> 27:35.740
 in the context of strength.

27:35.740 --> 27:38.960
 So let's say I were somebody who,

27:38.960 --> 27:41.040
 I come to you and I say,

27:41.040 --> 27:44.160
 and let's just say for sake of balance here,

27:44.160 --> 27:45.740
 because she actually does do some weight training.

27:45.740 --> 27:47.820
 I bring my sister in and I say,

27:47.820 --> 27:50.660
 me and my sister both want to get stronger.

27:51.660 --> 27:54.120
 What modifiable variables should,

27:54.120 --> 27:55.980
 how should we modify the variables?

27:55.980 --> 27:57.240
 Love it. All right, great.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.340
 I'm going to do inception on you one more time.

27:59.340 --> 28:00.780
 So one of my other laws,

28:00.780 --> 28:01.980
 oh, this won't be fast, I promise,

28:01.980 --> 28:03.700
 of strength and conditioning,

28:03.700 --> 28:07.240
 is in general, the default is all joints

28:07.240 --> 28:09.420
 through all range of motion.

28:09.420 --> 28:10.780
 So this is important because it's going to answer

28:10.780 --> 28:13.740
 your very first question on this strength category.

28:13.740 --> 28:16.420
 So in general, the ankle should go

28:16.420 --> 28:17.740
 through the full range of motion of the ankle.

28:17.740 --> 28:19.320
 The knee should go through the full range of motion,

28:19.320 --> 28:21.940
 the knee, the hip, the elbow, et cetera, et cetera, right?

28:21.940 --> 28:24.420
 Across the workout, not in a single movement.

28:24.420 --> 28:25.760
 Well, right.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.140
 I would hope, unless there's an amazing exercise

28:28.140 --> 28:28.980
 I haven't heard about.

28:28.980 --> 28:30.080
 Well, there are some exercises

28:30.080 --> 28:32.380
 that we're going to call more full body.

28:32.380 --> 28:34.340
 Think about a full snatch.

28:34.340 --> 28:36.320
 Like you're going to take a lot of your muscles,

28:36.320 --> 28:39.240
 a lot of your joints through a lot of range of motions.

28:39.240 --> 28:40.540
 Other ones, like an isolation,

28:40.540 --> 28:42.100
 we call these single joint exercises.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.060
 So imagine a bicep curl.

28:44.060 --> 28:45.500
 You have one joint in that particular case,

28:45.500 --> 28:47.260
 the elbow moving, the shoulder,

28:47.260 --> 28:49.420
 and everything else is pretty much stable.

28:49.420 --> 28:51.380
 And this is how we'll differentiate multi-joint

28:51.380 --> 28:53.580
 from single joint movements.

28:53.580 --> 28:55.740
 But yeah, so across, I would even say

28:55.740 --> 28:57.380
 it doesn't even have to be the day,

28:57.380 --> 28:58.940
 but maybe throughout the week.

28:58.940 --> 29:02.280
 Try to get every joint through full range of motion.

29:02.280 --> 29:04.800
 Now, a couple of quick caveats to that.

29:04.800 --> 29:08.660
 I am not advocating using full range of motion

29:08.660 --> 29:11.560
 and allowing really bad exercise technique.

29:11.560 --> 29:13.540
 So when I say full range of motion, that's the default.

29:13.540 --> 29:14.980
 That doesn't mean every single person

29:14.980 --> 29:16.540
 can do that for every single exercise.

29:16.540 --> 29:19.320
 It means that's where we should be striving to,

29:19.320 --> 29:20.420
 and that's our starting point.

29:20.420 --> 29:22.700
 You're going to see a lot less injury

29:22.700 --> 29:24.780
 and a lot more productivity out of your training sessions.

29:24.780 --> 29:27.620
 In fact, the science is fairly clear on this one.

29:27.620 --> 29:29.300
 Strength development, as well as hypertrophy,

29:29.300 --> 29:30.380
 is generally enhanced

29:30.380 --> 29:32.900
 with a larger range of motion of training.

29:32.900 --> 29:37.900
 And the mechanisms are like somewhat understood on that.

29:38.340 --> 29:40.160
 So that being said,

29:40.160 --> 29:42.900
 if you have to get into, say, a bad position

29:42.900 --> 29:45.060
 with your, say, low back, the spine is a very good one.

29:45.060 --> 29:47.060
 In general, the spine should stay very neutral,

29:47.060 --> 29:47.900
 is what we call it.

29:47.900 --> 29:51.480
 So no flexion, no extension, especially in the lumbar region.

29:51.480 --> 29:54.160
 So if you're doing, say, a deadlift,

29:54.160 --> 29:55.300
 and in order to take your knee

29:55.300 --> 29:56.820
 through a full range of motion on a deadlift,

29:56.820 --> 29:59.160
 you have to compromise your back position.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.000
 That's no bueno.

30:01.020 --> 30:04.140
 So caveats there aside, don't kill me.

30:04.140 --> 30:05.220
 In good positions, always.

30:05.220 --> 30:08.040
 And don't kill yourselves, more importantly.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.320
 So why that matters is if we walk through strength,

30:10.320 --> 30:11.660
 the very first thing I'm gonna go through

30:11.660 --> 30:13.020
 is the exercise selection.

30:13.020 --> 30:14.460
 So let's choose an exercise

30:14.460 --> 30:17.980
 which ideally has a full range of motion or close to it

30:17.980 --> 30:19.640
 that doesn't induce injury for you,

30:19.640 --> 30:22.420
 that you can still maintain good neck and low back

30:22.420 --> 30:24.500
 and position and everything else,

30:24.500 --> 30:27.420
 you feel comfortable with, so you can feel strong,

30:27.420 --> 30:28.700
 but you don't feel like, oh my gosh,

30:28.700 --> 30:30.900
 if you've never snatched before,

30:30.900 --> 30:34.820
 having you do a snatch for a maximum, even 75%,

30:34.820 --> 30:35.660
 like it's a terrible idea.

30:35.660 --> 30:38.020
 You're not gonna feel confident it's gonna be a train wreck.

30:38.020 --> 30:40.420
 I would rather put you on a machine bench press.

30:40.420 --> 30:42.040
 So you can go, I feel stable, I feel safe here,

30:42.040 --> 30:44.980
 and I can just express my strength.

30:44.980 --> 30:48.780
 So exercise choice in general, full range of motion,

30:48.780 --> 30:51.740
 and you wanna kind of balance between the movement areas.

30:51.740 --> 30:53.380
 So this is an upper body press.

30:53.380 --> 30:55.940
 So this is pushing away from you, bench press,

30:55.940 --> 30:56.780
 things like that.

30:56.780 --> 30:59.700
 Upper body pull, pulling an implement towards you,

30:59.700 --> 31:01.220
 bent row, pull up.

31:02.100 --> 31:03.980
 The pressing should be horizontal,

31:03.980 --> 31:06.720
 so perpendicular to your body, as well as vertical.

31:06.720 --> 31:09.480
 So this is lifting a weight over top of your head,

31:09.480 --> 31:11.520
 lifting away from you.

31:11.520 --> 31:13.600
 The pull version is pulling horizontally to you

31:13.600 --> 31:17.020
 and pulling vertically down, pull up, things like that.

31:17.020 --> 31:20.540
 From the lower body, we typically call these hinges.

31:20.540 --> 31:21.920
 It's sort of a funny muscle thing

31:21.920 --> 31:22.880
 that no one's gonna laugh at,

31:22.880 --> 31:24.900
 but like maybe me and you here,

31:24.900 --> 31:28.180
 is we'll categorize muscles as, or movements, exercises,

31:28.180 --> 31:30.100
 as pushes and pulls, right?

31:30.100 --> 31:32.100
 So like a squat tends to be a push,

31:32.100 --> 31:33.520
 because you're pushing away the ground.

31:33.520 --> 31:34.420
 A deadlift is a pull,

31:34.420 --> 31:36.660
 because you're pulling the implement up to you.

31:36.660 --> 31:39.940
 But in reality, every single exercise is only ever a pull,

31:39.940 --> 31:41.540
 because muscle doesn't push things away.

31:41.540 --> 31:43.500
 Muscle can only contract and pull on itself.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.120
 And so, again, super nerdy thing

31:46.120 --> 31:47.380
 that like most people are like, yeah.

31:47.380 --> 31:48.680
 And everyone's like, that's so dumb.

31:48.680 --> 31:50.400
 No, but I think it's a really important point,

31:50.400 --> 31:52.400
 because it also speaks to something

31:52.400 --> 31:53.540
 I think we'll get into later,

31:53.540 --> 31:56.100
 which is that, you know, posterior chain, anterior chain.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.220
 Totally.

31:57.220 --> 31:58.860
 And if that's mysterious to people,

31:58.860 --> 32:00.800
 it'll become clear before long.

32:00.800 --> 32:04.460
 Posterior chain, anterior chain makes a lot of sense to me

32:04.460 --> 32:05.580
 because of the way it's grounded

32:05.580 --> 32:06.940
 and the firing of motor neurons,

32:06.940 --> 32:09.140
 which is ultimately what controls muscle.

32:09.140 --> 32:09.980
 So it's also, I think-

32:09.980 --> 32:10.940
 Feel your nerves all the time.

32:10.940 --> 32:11.780
 Exactly.

32:11.780 --> 32:12.780
 So it also depends on the lens

32:12.780 --> 32:15.240
 through which one looks at life and exercise.

32:15.240 --> 32:17.300
 Of course, my lens is primarily neuroscience.

32:17.300 --> 32:20.260
 So, but I realized that the importance,

32:20.260 --> 32:23.840
 I like this idea of pushing perpendicular to the body,

32:23.840 --> 32:28.840
 overhead, pulling both toward the body and from overhead.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.980
 That just makes really good intuitive sense,

32:30.980 --> 32:31.860
 especially since a lot of people

32:31.860 --> 32:33.420
 were just listening to this and not watching it.

32:33.420 --> 32:34.700
 So in your minds, folks,

32:34.700 --> 32:39.100
 you can think about pushing away like a punch or overhead,

32:39.100 --> 32:40.220
 like lifting something overhead

32:40.220 --> 32:43.020
 and then pulling toward your midline

32:43.020 --> 32:44.300
 or toward your body rather,

32:44.300 --> 32:47.220
 and then pulling yourself up like a pull-up in PE class

32:47.220 --> 32:48.640
 for those of you that-

32:48.640 --> 32:50.220
 So the lower body's the same thing, right?

32:50.220 --> 32:52.980
 It's some sort of pushing away like a squat

32:52.980 --> 32:55.860
 or a split squat or a lunge or something like that.

32:55.860 --> 32:59.060
 And then some sort of, again, what we'll call pull or hinge.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.340
 So a deadlift or a Romanian deadlift or a hamstring curl

33:02.340 --> 33:03.840
 or something where you're contracting

33:03.840 --> 33:05.780
 and pulling the thing in there.

33:05.780 --> 33:06.620
 And you could split these

33:06.620 --> 33:08.100
 into like a thousand different categories.

33:08.100 --> 33:09.820
 If you're really in that field,

33:09.820 --> 33:12.080
 you're gonna wanna add a bunch of other ones,

33:12.080 --> 33:13.860
 but that's just like a rough conception.

33:13.860 --> 33:15.940
 So if you were going to do a single workout,

33:15.940 --> 33:17.860
 you could choose four exercises

33:17.860 --> 33:18.900
 and you could choose one of each,

33:18.900 --> 33:22.060
 one press, upper body press, one upper body pull,

33:22.060 --> 33:25.500
 one lower body hinge, one lower body press.

33:25.500 --> 33:29.280
 And then that would be like a decently well-rounded exercise.

33:30.460 --> 33:31.940
 That's your exercise selection.

33:31.940 --> 33:33.500
 And if you're taking those through a full range of motion,

33:33.500 --> 33:35.740
 you're in a pretty good spot, as close as you can.

33:35.740 --> 33:37.000
 The next one is intensity.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.460
 So if you wanna develop strength,

33:38.460 --> 33:40.940
 this comes back to one of my favorite scientists

33:40.940 --> 33:43.380
 of all time, who happens to be a nerve guy, actually.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.820
 And generally I like to shit on nerves

33:44.820 --> 33:47.320
 as much as I possibly can, because I'm a muscle guy,

33:47.320 --> 33:49.500
 but I have to give Henneman some credit here, right?

33:49.500 --> 33:50.660
 And I know you know who that is.

33:50.660 --> 33:51.620
 Henneman's size principle.

33:51.620 --> 33:53.260
 Yeah, of course, right?

33:53.260 --> 33:54.500
 So this is a series of papers.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.020
 I think it was in nature.

33:57.020 --> 33:58.060
 At least some of them, yeah.

33:58.060 --> 34:01.380
 Yeah, in 1954, 56 or like something,

34:01.380 --> 34:04.180
 you can fact check me, I'm sure you will.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.660
 But he basically outlined this idea that,

34:06.660 --> 34:09.780
 okay, there's a certain recruitment threshold needed

34:09.780 --> 34:10.780
 for neurons to fire.

34:10.780 --> 34:13.780
 And we have muscle fibers in what we call

34:13.780 --> 34:16.120
 fast twitch muscle fibers and slow twitch muscle fibers.

34:16.120 --> 34:18.180
 And in general, you're going to activate

34:18.180 --> 34:20.460
 the slow twitch ones first, because they tend to be

34:20.460 --> 34:22.740
 associated with low threshold motor neurons.

34:22.740 --> 34:25.600
 It's not exactly that way, but it's close enough, right?

34:25.600 --> 34:27.200
 Well, the only way that you activate

34:27.200 --> 34:28.720
 some of these higher threshold neurons

34:28.720 --> 34:32.900
 is to demand the muscle to produce more force.

34:32.900 --> 34:34.800
 And it's fairly specific to force, right?

34:34.800 --> 34:38.020
 It's not something you can do over an endurance thing,

34:38.020 --> 34:41.520
 right, unless it gets really extreme and particularly happens.

34:41.520 --> 34:44.120
 So in general, the only way to use these big chunks

34:44.120 --> 34:46.700
 of your muscle, which are incredibly important

34:46.700 --> 34:48.840
 for aging, by the way, one of the major problems we have

34:48.840 --> 34:51.860
 with aging developing or development of aging related issues

34:51.860 --> 34:53.740
 with muscle is the fact that we lose

34:53.740 --> 34:55.560
 fast twitch fibers preferentially.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.200
 And then we have major problems as we go down the line,

34:58.200 --> 35:00.280
 because we've lost a big chunk of our strength and size.

35:00.280 --> 35:04.040
 So you want to make sure these fibers stay alive and intact.

35:04.040 --> 35:08.380
 Okay, so that being said, the only way to develop strength

35:08.380 --> 35:11.480
 is then to challenge the muscle to produce more total force.

35:12.520 --> 35:16.200
 If you are fairly untrained or new,

35:16.200 --> 35:17.320
 I guess I should have stated this all

35:17.320 --> 35:18.160
 at the beginning as well.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.540
 One more inception, then I'll stop.

35:20.540 --> 35:22.080
 When it comes to this level of detail

35:22.080 --> 35:25.640
 of exercise prescription, a fairly untrained person

35:25.640 --> 35:27.600
 is going to respond basically the same

35:27.600 --> 35:29.280
 to every single thing you do.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.880
 In fact, we've done this in the lab many times.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.780
 We've done training studies doing things

35:32.780 --> 35:35.920
 like 30 minutes of cycling and seen huge increases

35:35.920 --> 35:38.660
 in muscle strength and size, which is not a prescription

35:38.660 --> 35:40.920
 for most people to increase size,

35:40.920 --> 35:42.980
 but people that are really untrained,

35:42.980 --> 35:45.280
 if you did plyometrics or strength training

35:45.280 --> 35:48.600
 or endurance running, they all just get better at everything.

35:48.600 --> 35:51.580
 So that caveat kind of aside, if you want to be

35:51.580 --> 35:55.280
 more intentional and more specific to the goal of strength,

35:55.280 --> 35:58.840
 you need to produce more force, specificity matters.

35:58.840 --> 36:02.440
 So we have size principle to help understand this,

36:02.440 --> 36:04.240
 and we have our laws of specificity,

36:04.240 --> 36:07.460
 which say said principle, specific adaptation

36:07.460 --> 36:08.800
 to imposed demand.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.000
 So the adaptation you get or the result of your training

36:12.000 --> 36:15.640
 is going to be a reflection of the demand that you imposed.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.280
 So if you want to get stronger,

36:17.280 --> 36:21.820
 you need to impose a demand of strength, not repetitions.

36:21.820 --> 36:24.560
 So this has to be, the load has to be very high.

36:24.560 --> 36:27.600
 In general, you're probably looking at above 85%

36:27.600 --> 36:28.780
 of your one rep max.

36:29.960 --> 36:33.260
 If you're moderately trained, maybe 75% will work,

36:33.260 --> 36:35.400
 lowly trained again, everything works.

36:35.400 --> 36:38.080
 But in general, we want to be pressing a load

36:38.080 --> 36:38.920
 that's very high.

36:38.920 --> 36:42.480
 So because the intensity demand is so high,

36:42.480 --> 36:46.080
 that is going to enforce you to do a low repetition range.

36:46.080 --> 36:49.040
 You can't do 12 reps at 95%,

36:49.040 --> 36:50.900
 then it wouldn't be 95% of your one rep max.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.740
 So by definition, true strength training

36:53.740 --> 36:56.360
 is really going to be in like five repetitions per set

36:56.360 --> 36:58.000
 or less range.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.960
 That's where most of it's going to occur for specificity.

37:00.960 --> 37:05.960
 So we've covered choice, intensity and repetitions, right?

37:06.240 --> 37:08.400
 The total amount of sets that you do

37:08.400 --> 37:12.540
 is really kind of up to your personal fitness level, right?

37:12.540 --> 37:15.400
 If you did as little as like three sets per exercise,

37:15.400 --> 37:16.360
 that's probably enough.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.280
 Work sets.

37:17.280 --> 37:19.000
 Totally, yeah, totally work sets, right.

37:19.000 --> 37:21.560
 So get fully warmed up and build up to that 85%.

37:21.560 --> 37:24.440
 Don't just walk into the gym and throw 85% on and go,

37:24.440 --> 37:27.920
 thank you, that's an important distinction.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.320
 So work your way up, do some,

37:30.320 --> 37:32.600
 like a very classic warmup thing would be

37:32.600 --> 37:37.200
 like a set of 10 at 50%, a set of eight at 60%,

37:37.200 --> 37:39.360
 a set of maybe eight again at 70%,

37:39.360 --> 37:42.280
 and then maybe like a set of five at 75%.

37:42.280 --> 37:45.000
 So two or three or four sets kind of building intensity

37:45.000 --> 37:46.680
 and lowering the rep range.

37:46.680 --> 37:51.680
 And then you would go after your two or three working sets.

37:52.040 --> 37:54.680
 Also, in terms of rest intervals.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.200
 Now, because we're trying to,

37:56.200 --> 37:58.480
 the primary driver of strength is intensity.

37:59.500 --> 38:01.000
 It's not the volume, right?

38:01.000 --> 38:02.160
 It's the intensity.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.100
 So in order to maintain that,

38:03.100 --> 38:04.400
 we have to do a low repetition range.

38:04.400 --> 38:07.080
 But in addition, we also have to have a high rest interval

38:07.080 --> 38:08.320
 because if we start to,

38:08.320 --> 38:10.240
 if we have any amount of fatigue can occur

38:10.240 --> 38:12.400
 and we have to then either reduce the reps

38:12.400 --> 38:15.560
 or reduce the intensity, we've lost the primary driver.

38:15.560 --> 38:17.160
 We've lost that main signal.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.640
 So the number we're gonna throw out typically

38:18.640 --> 38:20.260
 is like two to four minutes.

38:21.240 --> 38:24.440
 So imagine you did, you know, your set of bench press

38:24.440 --> 38:27.200
 and you did five repetitions at 85%,

38:27.200 --> 38:29.240
 you probably wanna rest two to four minutes

38:29.240 --> 38:31.140
 before coming back to the bench.

38:31.140 --> 38:33.200
 That doesn't mean you have to sit there on your phone.

38:33.200 --> 38:34.600
 Like, in fact, please don't.

38:35.600 --> 38:38.880
 Everyone will thank you for not doing that, I promise.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.360
 You can engage other muscle groups.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.760
 This is what we call supersetting.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.000
 So you're doing your bench press

38:43.000 --> 38:46.560
 and while that two minute clock is running for your chest

38:46.560 --> 38:49.320
 to rest, you can go over and do your deadlifts.

38:49.320 --> 38:52.200
 And so, you know, you can kind of move back and forth

38:52.200 --> 38:54.680
 and this is how you can make strength training

38:54.680 --> 38:56.880
 not seven hour workout.

38:56.880 --> 38:57.720
 If you're a professional athlete,

38:57.720 --> 38:59.280
 you're gonna take that time

38:59.280 --> 39:01.340
 because you wanna maximize the outcome.

39:02.480 --> 39:03.560
 We've done this actually in our lab too.

39:03.560 --> 39:06.900
 Supersets will reduce the strength gains

39:06.900 --> 39:08.240
 but by a tiny amount.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.240
 And most of us don't care enough

39:10.240 --> 39:11.760
 relative to it's going to triple

39:11.760 --> 39:13.720
 the length of your training session.

39:13.720 --> 39:14.640
 It's not worth it.

39:14.640 --> 39:16.560
 So for the average person, I will tell them,

39:16.560 --> 39:17.400
 yeah, superset.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.920
 For someone who's trying to break a world record

39:19.920 --> 39:23.080
 in weightlifting or powerlifting, I don't superset.

39:23.080 --> 39:23.920
 Interesting.

39:23.920 --> 39:26.920
 Yeah, I think I've found that I don't recover

39:26.920 --> 39:29.680
 particularly well from strength and hypertrophy training.

39:29.680 --> 39:30.520
 So-

39:30.520 --> 39:32.200
 Like in the workout or the next day?

39:32.200 --> 39:33.400
 From workout to workout.

39:33.400 --> 39:37.240
 Unless I keep the total duration of those workouts,

39:37.240 --> 39:42.240
 I like to say no more than 60 minutes of work, of real work.

39:43.400 --> 39:46.920
 Maybe 75, past 75, I find that I just start to,

39:46.920 --> 39:49.420
 I have to introduce additional rest days

39:49.420 --> 39:51.860
 or I just get weaker over time.

39:51.860 --> 39:55.280
 So I'd set a kind of a limit at 50 minutes

39:55.280 --> 39:57.360
 and then I usually violate that limit

39:57.360 --> 39:59.260
 and end up doing 60 minutes.

39:59.260 --> 40:04.260
 So I'm excited to hear that one can superset exercises

40:04.260 --> 40:07.660
 as long as they work different muscle groups, of course.

40:07.660 --> 40:09.300
 So I wouldn't want to do like bench press

40:09.300 --> 40:10.580
 and overhead press superset it

40:10.580 --> 40:13.940
 because I think that goes without saying for most people,

40:13.940 --> 40:15.280
 but just to point that out.

40:15.280 --> 40:19.100
 But that I could do some push, pull, push, pull

40:19.100 --> 40:22.800
 without compromising total intensity that much.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.620
 And I certainly would be willing to give up a rep here

40:25.620 --> 40:28.260
 or there or a few pounds here or there.

40:29.100 --> 40:32.420
 And may I ask whether or not in doing that,

40:32.420 --> 40:37.420
 one gets any even tiny bit or more of additional benefit

40:38.580 --> 40:40.520
 in terms of cardiovascular work.

40:40.520 --> 40:43.560
 Because I imagine after all, even a one rep max,

40:43.560 --> 40:44.580
 which I've never done, as I mentioned,

40:44.580 --> 40:47.380
 but let's say I get three reps on the overhead press

40:47.380 --> 40:50.680
 and then I get four reps on a weighted pull up

40:50.680 --> 40:51.860
 and I'm going back and forth.

40:51.860 --> 40:53.900
 I'm no doubt going to be breathing harder

40:53.900 --> 40:56.540
 than if I was sitting there texting away on my phone

40:56.540 --> 40:57.580
 in between sets.

40:57.580 --> 40:58.700
 Yep, of course.

40:58.700 --> 41:00.420
 Yeah, and so in fact, in general,

41:00.420 --> 41:02.100
 one of the things that I'll present in my class

41:02.100 --> 41:05.900
 is a giant list of, in fact, on the top

41:05.900 --> 41:07.620
 is all of these different exercise adaptations

41:07.620 --> 41:09.180
 I started the conversation with.

41:09.180 --> 41:12.820
 And on the vertical column are as many

41:12.820 --> 41:15.780
 of the physiological potential adaptations one would get.

41:15.780 --> 41:19.220
 So changes in endogenous pH, blood pressure,

41:19.220 --> 41:22.180
 lymphatic changes, bone density, all these things, right?

41:22.180 --> 41:23.340
 And you just have this giant list.

41:23.340 --> 41:26.180
 And then you can run a matrix and you can start to look at,

41:26.180 --> 41:27.340
 okay, if I do speed training,

41:27.340 --> 41:30.140
 am I going to see changes in the nervous system?

41:30.140 --> 41:31.660
 Well, like very much so, right?

41:31.660 --> 41:34.460
 That's the primary actual reason those things work.

41:34.460 --> 41:36.020
 Very little change in the muscle system.

41:36.020 --> 41:37.700
 It's almost exclusively explained

41:37.700 --> 41:40.260
 by the central or peripheral nervous system, right?

41:41.260 --> 41:42.100
 On that same token,

41:42.100 --> 41:43.900
 are you going to expect many cardiovascular adaptations

41:43.900 --> 41:44.740
 from speed?

41:44.740 --> 41:45.580
 And the answer is no,

41:45.580 --> 41:47.420
 because although we didn't cover it,

41:47.420 --> 41:50.220
 speed is very low intensity, very low rep range,

41:50.220 --> 41:51.900
 very high rest.

41:51.900 --> 41:53.180
 Well, as you go to like strength

41:53.180 --> 41:54.140
 and then you go to hypertrophy,

41:54.140 --> 41:56.060
 you start seeing more and more increases

41:56.060 --> 41:57.300
 in cardiovascular adaptations

41:57.300 --> 41:59.300
 because you're doing exactly that, right?

41:59.300 --> 42:01.340
 You're starting to reduce stress

42:01.340 --> 42:03.660
 and you're starting to increase volume.

42:03.660 --> 42:06.100
 But you're going to lose things like

42:06.100 --> 42:07.620
 bone mineral adaptations

42:07.620 --> 42:09.460
 because the load starts to go down.

42:09.460 --> 42:10.860
 So you can look at this matrix

42:10.860 --> 42:13.900
 and kind of understand if I'm a person

42:13.900 --> 42:16.580
 who wants to kind of maximize the adaptations

42:16.580 --> 42:18.580
 I get across my entire physiology

42:18.580 --> 42:21.980
 for the least amount of work,

42:21.980 --> 42:25.180
 you can choose these different adaptations to go after

42:25.180 --> 42:26.980
 that are going to kind of land on these things, right?

42:26.980 --> 42:28.260
 And exactly as you mentioned,

42:28.260 --> 42:31.100
 if you're going to take five minutes rest between each rep,

42:31.100 --> 42:32.020
 so let's say the extreme,

42:32.020 --> 42:34.020
 you're going to do three sets of one repetition

42:34.020 --> 42:36.020
 for strength at 95%,

42:36.020 --> 42:37.100
 you're going to take probably five,

42:37.100 --> 42:39.940
 maybe seven minutes between each attempt.

42:39.940 --> 42:41.860
 Like you better not expect many like changes

42:41.860 --> 42:43.020
 in your resting blood pressure,

42:43.020 --> 42:45.180
 that there's no cardiovascular strain there.

42:45.180 --> 42:46.940
 You're going to put it together in a circuit

42:46.940 --> 42:49.180
 where you're going to lose some potential strength adaptation

42:49.180 --> 42:51.660
 but you're going to gain something there.

42:51.660 --> 42:52.820
 So all these things are,

42:52.820 --> 42:55.060
 it's not about good or bad or right or wrong,

42:55.060 --> 42:57.540
 it's always about what advantage do you want

42:57.540 --> 43:00.180
 and what disadvantage do you want?

43:00.180 --> 43:02.580
 And I can cut like really into the chase here

43:02.580 --> 43:04.500
 on one of these things,

43:04.500 --> 43:06.340
 because we'll get to this eventually.

43:06.340 --> 43:08.020
 If you want to know the ones that are going to generally

43:08.020 --> 43:10.340
 give you the most physiological adaptations

43:10.340 --> 43:11.980
 across the most categories,

43:11.980 --> 43:12.900
 you're almost always looking

43:12.900 --> 43:14.620
 for hypertrophy type of training

43:14.620 --> 43:17.500
 and then this anaerobic conditioning piece

43:17.500 --> 43:18.340
 that we're going to do,

43:18.340 --> 43:20.060
 that's going to hit the most systems at once.

43:20.060 --> 43:20.940
 That's great to know

43:20.940 --> 43:23.020
 and we should definitely go a little bit deeper

43:23.020 --> 43:26.940
 on those types of what the modifiable variables are

43:26.940 --> 43:27.820
 for those categories,

43:27.820 --> 43:29.820
 because I think that I'm guessing the vast majority

43:29.820 --> 43:31.620
 of people want to be a bit stronger,

43:31.620 --> 43:34.240
 maybe add a little bit of muscle or more,

43:35.460 --> 43:38.060
 make sure their heart is healthy and et cetera.

43:39.660 --> 43:40.580
 This is wonderful

43:40.580 --> 43:43.420
 and I think it's clarifying certainly a lot for me.

43:43.420 --> 43:47.260
 So for strength, I guess training frequency.

43:47.260 --> 43:49.380
 So what should determine training frequency?

43:49.380 --> 43:54.060
 And I had the great benefit of a long time ago

43:54.060 --> 43:55.780
 when I was in high school actually,

43:55.780 --> 43:59.540
 I paid for a session over the phone with Mike Mentzer.

43:59.540 --> 44:00.500
 Oh, lovely.

44:00.500 --> 44:01.340
 The Mike Mentzer.

44:01.340 --> 44:02.180
 Sure.

44:02.180 --> 44:03.000
 We got to be friends.

44:03.000 --> 44:04.180
 High intensity training.

44:04.180 --> 44:05.420
 At the time I was pretty young

44:05.420 --> 44:06.460
 and my mother kept saying like,

44:06.460 --> 44:09.260
 why is this like grown man calling the house?

44:09.260 --> 44:11.020
 And we would talk all the time about training,

44:11.020 --> 44:12.980
 but he tried to convince me

44:12.980 --> 44:16.100
 to train once every five to seven days,

44:16.100 --> 44:18.420
 very few sets, very high intensity.

44:19.540 --> 44:23.220
 And I must say it worked incredibly well.

44:23.220 --> 44:24.060
 Sure.

44:24.060 --> 44:26.940
 And I think with my recovery quotient,

44:26.940 --> 44:28.300
 which was not very good,

44:28.300 --> 44:30.100
 I think has improved over time, but was not very good.

44:30.100 --> 44:31.900
 It was remarkable.

44:31.900 --> 44:34.380
 But of course this was a time when I was-

44:34.380 --> 44:36.820
 Full of the most animalism you've ever had in your life.

44:36.820 --> 44:38.980
 I was 14 on my own version of anabolics.

44:40.540 --> 44:41.820
 I had a long arc of puberty.

44:41.820 --> 44:43.200
 And you were untrained.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.260
 And I was mostly untrained.

44:44.260 --> 44:45.740
 I've been running cross country

44:45.740 --> 44:47.700
 and skateboarding and playing soccer.

44:47.700 --> 44:48.600
 And doing all the things

44:48.600 --> 44:50.500
 that are like the antithesis of growing muscle.

44:50.500 --> 44:52.580
 It was literally, and people will probably say impossible.

44:52.580 --> 44:54.420
 It was something like 40 pounds of muscle

44:54.420 --> 44:55.500
 inside of 12 months.

44:55.500 --> 44:56.340
 It was crazy.

44:56.340 --> 44:58.120
 I wouldn't believe that.

44:58.120 --> 45:01.340
 And so then of course that stopped working over time.

45:01.340 --> 45:04.260
 And then you start going down the odyssey

45:04.260 --> 45:06.180
 of trying to find the thing that's going to work that well.

45:06.180 --> 45:07.220
 And you eventually realized

45:07.220 --> 45:10.020
 that it was because you were untrained, right?

45:10.020 --> 45:14.780
 So training frequency is crucial.

45:14.780 --> 45:17.340
 Let's say that people are doing these whole body workouts

45:17.340 --> 45:18.160
 as you've described them.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.020
 Not alternating upper body, lower body.

45:20.020 --> 45:21.160
 Cause there's so many different splits

45:21.160 --> 45:22.620
 so it probably doesn't make sense

45:22.620 --> 45:25.920
 to go into splits right now.

45:25.920 --> 45:30.400
 But how often can and should one train a muscle?

45:30.400 --> 45:33.740
 And how do you know if a muscle is recovered locally?

45:33.740 --> 45:35.340
 And how do you know if your nervous system

45:35.340 --> 45:36.580
 is recovered systemically?

45:36.580 --> 45:38.660
 Okay, this is a bunch of really interesting questions.

45:38.660 --> 45:40.240
 I'm not sure exactly what route you want to go.

45:40.240 --> 45:41.940
 So I'll start here.

45:41.940 --> 45:43.380
 As I mentioned earlier,

45:43.380 --> 45:45.820
 soreness is not a good barometer of exercise quality

45:45.820 --> 45:47.340
 because some types of training

45:47.340 --> 45:48.740
 are going to induce more soreness

45:48.740 --> 45:51.000
 and some are going to induce less.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.380
 That's important to this conversation

45:52.380 --> 45:54.540
 because when you ask about how do you know

45:54.540 --> 45:56.660
 if a muscle is ready to train again,

45:56.660 --> 45:59.100
 one of the question is, what are you training for?

45:59.100 --> 46:01.500
 If you're training for hypertrophy, right?

46:01.500 --> 46:03.440
 Muscle size, muscle growth.

46:03.440 --> 46:05.180
 We need to hedge towards recovery

46:05.180 --> 46:06.140
 because what you're trying to do

46:06.140 --> 46:07.780
 is cause a massive insult there.

46:08.660 --> 46:11.300
 Allow then protein synthesis to occur,

46:11.300 --> 46:13.580
 building of new tissue, which takes time,

46:13.580 --> 46:17.180
 48 to 72 hours, like kind of at a minimum,

46:17.180 --> 46:18.480
 that process needs to occur.

46:18.480 --> 46:20.380
 If you're doing actually more strength,

46:20.380 --> 46:21.580
 and this is a differentiation

46:21.580 --> 46:23.300
 between hypertrophy and strength,

46:23.300 --> 46:25.260
 then you didn't induce actually much damage.

46:25.260 --> 46:27.100
 In fact, you're generally not going to get very sore

46:27.100 --> 46:29.280
 from true strength training, very little,

46:29.280 --> 46:32.560
 unless you get really heavy, you did a lot.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.860
 The primary driver of hypertrophy

46:34.860 --> 46:37.440
 is not the same primary driver of strength.

46:37.440 --> 46:38.360
 We talked about that already.

46:38.360 --> 46:39.940
 That's intensity driven.

46:39.940 --> 46:43.020
 For hypertrophy, it's not intensity.

46:43.020 --> 46:45.100
 So because we have different mechanisms,

46:45.100 --> 46:46.420
 we have different outcomes,

46:46.420 --> 46:48.460
 even though they're closely aligned,

46:48.460 --> 46:50.280
 strength is not going to cause a lot of soreness.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.400
 Therefore, intensity is the driver.

46:52.400 --> 46:55.740
 Therefore, frequency can be as high as you want.

46:55.740 --> 46:57.660
 So you can train every single day,

46:57.660 --> 47:01.320
 the same exact muscle, if speed or power or strength

47:01.320 --> 47:03.340
 are the primary training tools,

47:03.340 --> 47:06.380
 because you need stimulus there, skill as well, right?

47:06.380 --> 47:10.060
 Practice, you know that as much as anybody.

47:10.060 --> 47:11.500
 Developing a new motor pattern

47:11.500 --> 47:13.660
 requires a lot of repetitions, right?

47:13.660 --> 47:15.460
 You don't need a tremendous amount of rest.

47:15.460 --> 47:17.860
 That's not a damage thing, right?

47:17.860 --> 47:19.540
 It's a repatterning issue.

47:19.540 --> 47:22.540
 So strength training, in fact, if you look at,

47:22.540 --> 47:24.860
 again, true strength professional athletes,

47:24.860 --> 47:27.860
 they're going to train the same muscles basically every day.

47:27.860 --> 47:28.700
 Wow.

47:28.700 --> 47:29.540
 They're going to squat every day.

47:29.540 --> 47:32.540
 And is that because the primary mode of adaptation

47:32.540 --> 47:35.260
 is recruitment of these high threshold motor units?

47:35.260 --> 47:37.020
 So it's mainly neural.

47:37.020 --> 47:38.160
 No.

47:38.160 --> 47:39.000
 So everyone's going to say that?

47:39.000 --> 47:40.620
 And this is where I get all feisty?

47:40.620 --> 47:41.700
 Well, I'm not saying that.

47:41.700 --> 47:43.380
 That was actually, there was a question mark there.

47:43.380 --> 47:44.220
 Okay, okay.

47:44.220 --> 47:45.820
 If we were online putting comments,

47:45.820 --> 47:46.980
 there'd be a question mark.

47:46.980 --> 47:47.820
 We would have fought.

47:47.820 --> 47:48.640
 Yeah.

47:48.640 --> 47:49.860
 I think I blocked you.

47:49.860 --> 47:50.700
 I was just kidding.

47:50.700 --> 47:51.820
 I think you already blocked me.

47:51.820 --> 47:52.720
 Probably twice.

47:55.400 --> 47:56.840
 Okay.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.780
 The early adaptations to exercise,

47:58.780 --> 48:00.620
 especially strength training,

48:00.620 --> 48:02.840
 are hedged towards the nervous system.

48:02.840 --> 48:03.680
 No question about it.

48:03.680 --> 48:04.860
 People always say central nervous system,

48:04.860 --> 48:07.100
 but it's probably more peripheral, right?

48:07.100 --> 48:09.260
 Whatever, semantics probably, but pedantic.

48:10.140 --> 48:10.980
 It's nerve.

48:10.980 --> 48:12.900
 If you train today, tomorrow morning,

48:12.900 --> 48:15.660
 you're not going to wake up with a actually increase

48:15.660 --> 48:17.440
 in contractile proteins in muscle.

48:17.440 --> 48:19.220
 Your muscle might be a little bit bigger

48:19.220 --> 48:21.020
 due to some acute swelling,

48:21.020 --> 48:25.900
 but you could have a pretty acute that persists change

48:25.900 --> 48:27.260
 in the nervous system, we'll call it,

48:27.260 --> 48:30.580
 that allows you to be stronger within a couple of days.

48:30.580 --> 48:32.980
 Sustained hypertrophy is probably more along the lines

48:32.980 --> 48:35.300
 of four weeks, where we can see that, right?

48:35.300 --> 48:38.100
 We can actually see changes like in the ultrasound.

48:38.100 --> 48:39.500
 Now you're making changes immediately.

48:39.500 --> 48:43.260
 That protein synthesis process is happening very fast,

48:43.260 --> 48:44.160
 and it's going to last.

48:44.160 --> 48:46.420
 It just takes us time to measure it

48:46.420 --> 48:49.380
 in terms of a noticeable change in your whole muscle size.

48:49.380 --> 48:51.220
 So that being said, the first four weeks,

48:51.220 --> 48:54.900
 we typically say are primarily nervous system.

48:54.900 --> 48:57.700
 After that, now we're starting to see most of the changes

48:57.700 --> 49:00.000
 coming from the muscle side of the equation.

49:00.000 --> 49:01.900
 So with strength development,

49:01.900 --> 49:03.540
 it's a combination of three areas.

49:03.540 --> 49:06.940
 In fact, all muscle contraction has these same three things.

49:06.940 --> 49:09.260
 It starts off with some signal, right?

49:09.260 --> 49:10.580
 From somewhere in the body,

49:10.580 --> 49:11.740
 whether it's all the way up the top

49:11.740 --> 49:13.060
 or at the level of the spine,

49:13.060 --> 49:14.560
 depending on if this is a reaction

49:14.560 --> 49:16.660
 or an actual conscious control.

49:17.780 --> 49:20.860
 From there, some signal has to tell the muscle to contract.

49:20.860 --> 49:22.240
 Okay, so signal is one.

49:22.240 --> 49:23.780
 Two, it's muscular contraction.

49:23.780 --> 49:26.100
 And there's a lot of variables inside the muscle tissue

49:26.100 --> 49:28.900
 itself that determine its functionality.

49:28.900 --> 49:30.740
 And so if we took an individual biopsy

49:30.740 --> 49:32.580
 and took a muscle fiber from you and took one from me,

49:32.580 --> 49:35.460
 and we took those muscles out and put them in a Petri dish,

49:35.460 --> 49:37.780
 and I tied one end to a force transducer,

49:37.780 --> 49:39.940
 the other end to a thing that pulls it,

49:39.940 --> 49:41.580
 and we soaked it in a bath of calcium

49:41.580 --> 49:42.960
 and a bunch of other stuff,

49:42.960 --> 49:44.560
 even if they were the same size,

49:44.560 --> 49:47.600
 your fibers might contract a lot faster than mine,

49:47.600 --> 49:50.600
 even relative to size, or not, or slower,

49:50.600 --> 49:52.160
 or there's various properties.

49:52.160 --> 49:55.040
 So the intrinsic fibers themselves

49:55.040 --> 49:57.240
 determine a lot of functionality.

49:57.240 --> 50:00.120
 From there, muscle fibers don't cause movements.

50:00.120 --> 50:02.000
 Muscle fibers simply contract.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.720
 They're all surrounded with connective tissue,

50:03.720 --> 50:04.560
 and that's all surrounded

50:04.560 --> 50:06.160
 with a bunch of more connective tissue,

50:06.160 --> 50:07.560
 and that all surrounds into a muscle.

50:07.560 --> 50:09.720
 That muscle is then surrounded with more connective tissue.

50:09.720 --> 50:12.640
 That all comes together into a giant tendon.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.120
 That tendon attaches to the bone.

50:14.120 --> 50:15.520
 It's pulling on those tendon

50:15.520 --> 50:17.840
 that actually move the bone that cause human movement.

50:17.840 --> 50:18.680
 So that's area three.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.560
 Area one, the nervous system, area two,

50:20.560 --> 50:22.000
 the muscle contraction, area three,

50:22.000 --> 50:24.840
 some sort of connective tissue thing.

50:24.840 --> 50:27.480
 Changes happen at all three of those levels,

50:27.480 --> 50:28.760
 and we're not even now talking,

50:28.760 --> 50:30.720
 we even entered the discussion of biomechanics,

50:30.720 --> 50:33.600
 and you changed, say, the panation angle of the muscle,

50:33.600 --> 50:35.840
 which is the angle at which the muscle fibers lay

50:35.840 --> 50:37.760
 relative to the bone, right?

50:37.760 --> 50:38.760
 So this is basic mechanics.

50:38.760 --> 50:40.640
 Is it pulling perpendicular to the bone?

50:40.640 --> 50:42.080
 Is it pulling horizontal to the bone,

50:42.080 --> 50:43.560
 or some sort of angle?

50:43.560 --> 50:46.920
 All of these things determine human performance.

50:46.920 --> 50:47.960
 So when you're talking about, again,

50:47.960 --> 50:49.680
 that strength development,

50:49.680 --> 50:51.840
 you can see tremendous improvements

50:51.840 --> 50:53.240
 in total force production

50:53.240 --> 50:56.000
 by manipulating all of those areas,

50:56.000 --> 50:59.040
 and you have not touched changes in muscle size.

51:00.640 --> 51:03.640
 If you change muscle size in a true sustained fashion,

51:03.640 --> 51:07.400
 whether this is sarcoplasmic or contractile proteins,

51:07.400 --> 51:09.360
 you have given yourself more opportunity

51:09.360 --> 51:10.200
 to produce more force.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.040
 It doesn't guarantee you produce more force.

51:13.040 --> 51:15.520
 Bodybuilders are not stronger than power lifters,

51:15.520 --> 51:17.160
 even though they have more muscle,

51:17.160 --> 51:20.240
 but bodybuilders are probably stronger than most people.

51:20.240 --> 51:23.720
 So there is a relationship between muscle size and strength.

51:23.720 --> 51:26.320
 It's just not a one-to-one guaranteed ratio,

51:26.320 --> 51:27.880
 and that's generally because,

51:29.160 --> 51:31.120
 although the muscle has been aided,

51:31.120 --> 51:33.520
 they may have not changed the biomechanical considerations,

51:33.520 --> 51:35.800
 they may have not changed the connective tissue,

51:35.800 --> 51:37.920
 nor the nervous system stuff.

51:37.920 --> 51:40.320
 And so that's why we see this giant relationship,

51:40.320 --> 51:43.240
 that R-value is pretty high between strength and hypertrophy,

51:43.240 --> 51:46.240
 but if you really wanna get to the ends of it, it's not,

51:46.240 --> 51:49.560
 and that matters to your actual question 10 minutes ago,

51:49.560 --> 51:52.720
 because again, you can train strength daily

51:52.720 --> 51:54.080
 on the same muscle,

51:54.080 --> 51:56.040
 but if you want to allow for that process

51:56.040 --> 51:59.680
 of contractile proteins to add and grow,

51:59.680 --> 52:01.320
 then you're gonna have to allow some recovery,

52:01.320 --> 52:03.880
 because if you go back into that muscle too soon,

52:03.880 --> 52:06.320
 you're gonna blunt the response, you're gonna stop it,

52:06.320 --> 52:07.440
 you're gonna cut it off.

52:07.440 --> 52:09.960
 You have all kinds of problems going on in the cell

52:09.960 --> 52:13.400
 that are gonna just attenuate that growth response.

52:13.400 --> 52:16.480
 So I gave you the answer for strength training.

52:16.480 --> 52:20.480
 The answer for hypertrophy is probably less than three

52:20.480 --> 52:23.120
 out of 10 on level of soreness, so you can go again.

52:23.120 --> 52:25.640
 In general, you're probably looking at 72 hours

52:25.640 --> 52:27.360
 is the optimal window.

52:27.360 --> 52:30.840
 So if you trained your shoulders on Monday,

52:30.840 --> 52:33.400
 you probably would don't wanna train them again on Tuesday.

52:33.400 --> 52:36.440
 If hypertrophy is the goal, maybe Wednesday,

52:36.440 --> 52:38.040
 maybe Thursday is best.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.520
 So something like an every two to three day window

52:40.520 --> 52:43.520
 is probably, and we know a little bit more now

52:43.520 --> 52:45.160
 about why that is.

52:45.160 --> 52:47.800
 The gene cascade, the signaling response happens,

52:47.800 --> 52:50.080
 well, the signaling happens instantaneously, right,

52:50.080 --> 52:51.320
 within seconds.

52:51.320 --> 52:53.480
 The gene cascade is probably in the,

52:53.480 --> 52:55.000
 peaked in the four hour window,

52:55.000 --> 52:58.280
 like depending on which gene you wanna look at,

52:58.280 --> 53:00.080
 but it's just kind of a snapshot.

53:00.080 --> 53:03.320
 But the protein synthesis process is 24 to 48 hours

53:03.320 --> 53:06.200
 thing, and so it tends to kind of look like,

53:06.200 --> 53:08.360
 let that thing finish and let that signal go back

53:08.360 --> 53:12.440
 to baseline, and then hit it again, and then hit it again.

53:12.440 --> 53:14.200
 And now as long as you're providing the nutrients,

53:14.200 --> 53:16.640
 the recovery should happen, and you should be able

53:16.640 --> 53:19.480
 to sustain the same work output in the training session

53:19.480 --> 53:22.080
 so the stimulus stays high and the recovery's there,

53:22.080 --> 53:24.080
 and you can now continue to grow muscle.

53:26.280 --> 53:29.320
 You mentioned 48 to 72 hours for hypertrophy.

53:29.320 --> 53:34.320
 What if, for whatever reasons,

53:35.400 --> 53:39.160
 the training split, lifestyle factors, et cetera,

53:39.160 --> 53:40.840
 somebody say, let's use your example,

53:40.840 --> 53:42.800
 trains shoulders on Monday.

53:44.000 --> 53:46.520
 Ideally, they would train them again on Thursday

53:46.520 --> 53:48.520
 in their particular instance, somewhere Wednesday

53:48.520 --> 53:50.960
 or Thursday, but they don't.

53:50.960 --> 53:55.240
 They wait until Saturday or Sunday for whatever reason.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.240
 Maybe it's more compatible with their work,

53:57.240 --> 54:00.920
 work another exercise schedule, whatever the reason.

54:00.920 --> 54:03.120
 Are they actually losing hypertrophy that they gained

54:03.120 --> 54:06.440
 or they've missed a window to induce further hypertrophy?

54:06.440 --> 54:09.000
 It's probably better to think about it the latter.

54:09.000 --> 54:11.080
 It's not that you've lost, it's just you've just kind

54:11.080 --> 54:13.760
 of lost an opportunity to make more progress.

54:16.520 --> 54:18.760
 I will save you a little bit, and kind of going back

54:18.760 --> 54:21.720
 to your HIIT program, this is the original high-intensity

54:21.720 --> 54:24.760
 training, the menstrual thing, right, which is not.

54:24.760 --> 54:27.040
 The HIIT with one eye, not the high-intensity interval

54:27.040 --> 54:28.480
 training, but high-intensity training,

54:28.480 --> 54:32.360
 like one set to absolute failure, maybe two

54:32.360 --> 54:34.160
 for each muscle group.

54:34.160 --> 54:35.160
 20-minute workouts.

54:35.160 --> 54:37.480
 Dividing your body into a three-way split,

54:37.480 --> 54:40.400
 and then literally training like six times a month,

54:40.400 --> 54:43.280
 which most people think that is absolutely crazy.

54:43.280 --> 54:44.520
 There's no way that's going to work.

54:44.520 --> 54:46.400
 And I can tell you, if you are untrained,

54:46.400 --> 54:49.520
 you grow like a weed, if you train hard enough.

54:49.520 --> 54:52.000
 Even if you're trained, look at the people Mike trained.

54:52.000 --> 54:54.880
 He put a lot of bodybuilders on really high levels.

54:54.880 --> 54:58.160
 Now, they had the same similar help you had

54:58.160 --> 54:59.000
 at that timeframe.

54:59.000 --> 55:00.440
 Wait, to be very clear, I was not

55:00.440 --> 55:01.800
 taking exogenous antibiotics.

55:01.800 --> 55:02.640
 In fact, I will-

55:02.640 --> 55:03.880
 No, but your endogenous was just as good.

55:03.880 --> 55:04.720
 I probably was.

55:04.720 --> 55:06.640
 I wasn't measuring my levels there, but I probably would.

55:06.640 --> 55:07.560
 I grew easy.

55:07.560 --> 55:10.840
 And in general, I tend to grow pretty easily

55:10.840 --> 55:13.640
 from weight training, but the, but,

55:13.640 --> 55:15.240
 and I should say that to Mike's credit,

55:15.240 --> 55:16.920
 and I think this is an important message,

55:16.920 --> 55:20.320
 that he was the one who really said,

55:20.320 --> 55:23.480
 look, unless you're going to make a professional career

55:23.480 --> 55:25.920
 out of it, do not run the health hazards

55:25.920 --> 55:27.720
 of exogenous hormones.

55:27.720 --> 55:29.240
 You know, it's certainly not at your age.

55:29.240 --> 55:31.040
 So he deterred me from that, which was great,

55:31.040 --> 55:32.400
 because it never entered my mind.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.480
 It just was one of those things where Mike Mentzer

55:34.480 --> 55:35.480
 said, don't do it.

55:35.480 --> 55:37.120
 And he had clearly done it, right?

55:37.120 --> 55:39.040
 And so he's speaking from an informed place.

55:39.040 --> 55:41.080
 It never entered my mind, but also I was,

55:41.080 --> 55:44.200
 what was really wild is I was continuing

55:44.200 --> 55:45.920
 to run cross country.

55:45.920 --> 55:49.040
 And so there was a, there was a trade off there

55:49.040 --> 55:49.880
 at some point.

55:49.880 --> 55:52.040
 But when you're young, you can get,

55:52.040 --> 55:55.200
 many people can get away with what at this age

55:55.200 --> 55:57.480
 would surely place me into a state of over-training,

55:57.480 --> 55:58.400
 even at low volume.

55:58.400 --> 55:59.240
 We'll see.

55:59.240 --> 56:00.320
 Yeah, well, I mean like the whole field

56:00.320 --> 56:03.880
 on interference effects has changed quite a bit recently,

56:03.880 --> 56:05.560
 which we can come back to if you want.

56:05.560 --> 56:08.080
 But just to finish out the idea here

56:08.080 --> 56:09.280
 with that last question,

56:11.680 --> 56:13.240
 if you want to take five days or six days

56:13.240 --> 56:15.560
 in between each muscle group, you can do that.

56:15.560 --> 56:16.600
 In fact, if you look at the research,

56:16.600 --> 56:19.160
 it's going to show that frequency is not that important.

56:19.160 --> 56:21.120
 It will, it's not that it's unimportant,

56:21.120 --> 56:23.960
 but it's, it can handle changes

56:24.880 --> 56:27.720
 as long as you get to the same total volume.

56:27.720 --> 56:29.480
 So you can do that.

56:29.480 --> 56:33.160
 You just have to do a lot more work in that one workout.

56:33.160 --> 56:35.640
 If you care about the six week, eight week thing,

56:35.640 --> 56:38.120
 if you're like, I'm in this for the next 60 years,

56:39.160 --> 56:40.800
 like it's probably okay, right?

56:41.800 --> 56:44.520
 But it can be there that the challenge with splitting up

56:44.520 --> 56:46.480
 your training sessions for hypertrophy

56:46.480 --> 56:50.440
 into smaller numbers, like once or twice a week,

56:50.440 --> 56:52.640
 it's just difficult to get that number.

56:52.640 --> 56:55.240
 It's typical to get that volume done.

56:55.240 --> 56:59.640
 Volume wise, the more recent meta-analyses are going to say

56:59.640 --> 57:03.360
 that you're probably looking at around 10 working sets

57:03.360 --> 57:05.120
 per muscle group per week.

57:05.120 --> 57:06.840
 Seems to be kind of the minimum threshold

57:06.840 --> 57:07.960
 that you're going to want to hit.

57:07.960 --> 57:11.320
 So if you did three sets of 10 at your shoulders on Monday,

57:11.320 --> 57:15.160
 three sets of 10 shoulders Wednesday and three on Friday,

57:15.160 --> 57:16.880
 that's nine working sets.

57:16.880 --> 57:20.200
 If you wanted to do three different shoulder work,

57:20.200 --> 57:23.360
 exercises on Monday and hit your nine sets,

57:23.360 --> 57:25.520
 it's not really actually going to be that much different.

57:25.520 --> 57:28.720
 The problem is 10 is kind of a minimum.

57:28.720 --> 57:31.360
 You probably want to look for more like 15 to 20.

57:31.360 --> 57:34.080
 And in fact, well-trained folks, 20, 25.

57:34.080 --> 57:37.000
 That becomes very challenging in one workout.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.160
 In fact, defunct though,

57:38.160 --> 57:39.320
 you're not going to be able to do it, right?

57:39.320 --> 57:42.320
 And so that is where it's not the frequency

57:42.320 --> 57:43.160
 that looks like it kills you.

57:43.160 --> 57:44.640
 It's just the fact you have got to get,

57:44.640 --> 57:46.880
 because the total driver of strength is intensity,

57:46.880 --> 57:49.640
 but the total driver of hypertrophy is volume.

57:49.640 --> 57:51.400
 Assume you're taking it to fatigue, right?

57:51.400 --> 57:52.480
 Or muscular failure.

57:52.480 --> 57:54.440
 So it's just tough to get enough done.

57:54.440 --> 57:56.680
 If you can, and if you want to set your schedule up

57:56.680 --> 57:58.600
 that way, like you probably remember,

57:58.600 --> 58:00.160
 if you do those types of training sessions

58:00.160 --> 58:02.920
 where you're just going to completely exhaust a muscle,

58:04.440 --> 58:06.520
 it's going to be sore for a while.

58:06.520 --> 58:08.440
 You're probably not going to come back.

58:08.440 --> 58:10.280
 And that's sort of the logic behind that was

58:10.280 --> 58:12.440
 let's take this thing to tremendous failure

58:13.480 --> 58:15.280
 and give it six days to recover.

58:16.760 --> 58:18.440
 It can work, it's just not the best,

58:18.440 --> 58:19.560
 I think is one way to think about it.

58:19.560 --> 58:20.400
 For most people.

58:20.400 --> 58:21.520
 It's also hard to do those workouts

58:21.520 --> 58:22.640
 without a training partner,

58:22.640 --> 58:24.080
 if you really want to do them correctly.

58:24.080 --> 58:25.480
 And stimulants and headphones

58:25.480 --> 58:27.160
 and all kinds of other things, right?

58:27.160 --> 58:29.200
 Well, anyway, yeah, stimulants are not,

58:29.200 --> 58:30.920
 I certainly don't recommend those.

58:31.760 --> 58:34.280
 It may be a cup of coffee or two, if that's your thing.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.840
 And maybe some of the safer supplements,

58:37.840 --> 58:40.000
 but certainly not the sorts of stimulants

58:40.000 --> 58:41.480
 that the guys in the seventies and eighties

58:41.480 --> 58:42.640
 were famous for taking.

58:42.640 --> 58:43.480
 Or still use.

58:44.560 --> 58:46.320
 You talked about repetition ranges

58:46.320 --> 58:49.320
 broadly for strength training, so five or less.

58:49.320 --> 58:52.120
 You said frequency could be as often as every day.

58:52.120 --> 58:53.520
 Rest, two to four minutes.

58:53.520 --> 58:55.160
 Maybe even longer if you're going

58:55.160 --> 58:56.760
 for one repetition maximum.

58:57.800 --> 59:00.960
 For hypertrophy, what are the repetition ranges

59:00.960 --> 59:01.880
 that are effective?

59:01.880 --> 59:04.160
 And what are the ones that are most effective

59:04.160 --> 59:07.640
 if one is trying to maximize some of the other variables?

59:07.640 --> 59:10.360
 Like people don't want to spend more than an hour

59:10.360 --> 59:11.960
 to 75 minutes in the gym.

59:11.960 --> 59:14.920
 Because I think that while the rep ranges

59:14.920 --> 59:17.320
 might be quite broad, as you alluded to earlier,

59:17.320 --> 59:20.680
 there's the practical, there are the practical constraints.

59:20.680 --> 59:23.200
 So what repetition ranges or percent

59:23.200 --> 59:26.840
 of one repetition maximum should people consider

59:26.840 --> 59:28.000
 when thinking about hypertrophy?

59:28.000 --> 59:28.840
 Right.

59:28.840 --> 59:30.320
 The quick answer there is anywhere between

59:30.320 --> 59:32.880
 like five to 30 reps per set.

59:32.880 --> 59:35.720
 That's going to show across the literature

59:35.720 --> 59:38.280
 pretty much equal hypertrophy gains.

59:38.280 --> 59:39.480
 And we could have a really interesting discussion

59:39.480 --> 59:42.840
 about why that is, but I'm just remembering one thing

59:42.840 --> 59:44.680
 from a second ago.

59:44.680 --> 59:46.760
 I want to give a better answer for the frequency.

59:46.760 --> 59:48.640
 You can do every single week for strength

59:48.640 --> 59:50.480
 or every single day for strength.

59:50.480 --> 59:52.400
 If you want though, like what's probably minimally viable,

59:52.400 --> 59:54.920
 two, twice per week per muscle.

59:54.920 --> 59:57.280
 So hamstrings, strength twice per week.

59:57.280 --> 1:00:00.320
 That's a good number to get most people really strong.

1:00:00.320 --> 1:00:02.080
 You can do every single day.

1:00:02.080 --> 1:00:02.920
 You don't need to though.

1:00:02.920 --> 1:00:04.480
 So I want to make sure that, like I wasn't saying

1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:07.920
 you have to train a muscle 85% every single day

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:08.760
 to get it strong.

1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:09.600
 Two is a good number.

1:00:09.600 --> 1:00:12.600
 Three is great, but probably even two is really effective.

1:00:12.600 --> 1:00:13.440
 Got it.

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:15.040
 And this explains the high frequency

1:00:15.040 --> 1:00:17.160
 of training for strength athletes.

1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:19.000
 That's always mystified me.

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.120
 And the very long workouts make sense because very long-

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:22.640
 They're going to even train twice a day.

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:23.680
 Like even though it's a squat,

1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:25.200
 in the morning squat in the afternoon, every day.

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:26.280
 With their eating and their sleeping,

1:00:26.280 --> 1:00:27.800
 they probably don't have time for anything else.

1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:28.800
 That's why they're pros.

1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:30.160
 So that's their job, right?

1:00:30.160 --> 1:00:31.000
 That's what they do.

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:32.240
 So yeah, hypertrophy.

1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:38.280
 Strength training programming is somewhat complicated, right?

1:00:38.840 --> 1:00:41.440
 Because of, that's not the danger,

1:00:41.440 --> 1:00:44.760
 but you're going to have to pay one way or the other, right?

1:00:44.760 --> 1:00:46.880
 The risk is a little bit higher because the load's higher

1:00:46.880 --> 1:00:49.680
 and you have to be a little bit more technically proficient.

1:00:49.680 --> 1:00:51.000
 When it comes to hypertrophy training,

1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.760
 the way I like to explain it is it's kind of idiot proof.

1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:55.040
 The programming is idiot proof.

1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:56.780
 The work is hard though.

1:00:56.780 --> 1:00:58.600
 So here's your range.

1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:02.280
 Anywhere between five reps and 30.

1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:03.200
 Can you hit somewhere in there?

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:04.040
 Perfect.

1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:04.860
 It's all equally effective.

1:01:04.860 --> 1:01:06.360
 You can't screw that up.

1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:08.040
 The only caveat for hypertrophy

1:01:08.040 --> 1:01:10.800
 is you have to take it to muscular failure.

1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:12.640
 And you need enough rest for the adaptation

1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:14.080
 and protein synthesis to occur?

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:14.920
 Yep.

1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:15.960
 All right, and if you recover faster,

1:01:15.960 --> 1:01:17.240
 you can maybe do it more frequently.

1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:19.460
 And if you don't, maybe less frequently.

1:01:19.460 --> 1:01:22.240
 By that logic, should people perhaps experiment

1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:24.440
 and figure out what repetition range

1:01:24.440 --> 1:01:27.760
 allows them to recover in concert

1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:30.840
 with the training frequency that they can do consistently?

1:01:30.840 --> 1:01:33.040
 My recommendation is I think you should actually

1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:37.460
 set your, use the repetition range

1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:40.200
 as a way to have some variation.

1:01:40.200 --> 1:01:41.560
 Because most people don't want to go in the gym

1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:42.400
 and do three sets of 10.

1:01:42.400 --> 1:01:43.800
 They're going to get very bored very quickly.

1:01:43.800 --> 1:01:46.240
 And so I think you should actually intentionally change

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:48.940
 the rep schemes for simple sake of having more fun.

1:01:48.940 --> 1:01:50.080
 It is a very different challenge.

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:53.280
 The mechanisms that are inducing hypertrophy are different,

1:01:53.280 --> 1:01:54.880
 but there's only a maximum amount of growth

1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:55.760
 that one can get, right?

1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:58.960
 And so you have, as best we think it now,

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:00.880
 and some people actually will espouse

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:03.420
 that we know really clearly about the mechanisms

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:05.160
 of muscle hypertrophy, we don't.

1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:06.920
 It's still very much a guessing game.

1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:10.360
 But the three most likely drivers are one,

1:02:10.360 --> 1:02:13.480
 metabolic stress, two, mechanical tension,

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:15.960
 and then three, muscular damage.

1:02:15.960 --> 1:02:17.640
 You don't have to have all three.

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:18.580
 One is sufficient.

1:02:18.580 --> 1:02:20.800
 You can have a little bit of one or two,

1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:23.060
 and you can kind of, so you get it to play here.

1:02:23.060 --> 1:02:24.560
 We've already talked about the muscular damage.

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:27.300
 Again, it's very clear, more damage is not better.

1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:31.680
 But it is somewhat a decent proxy, right?

1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:33.200
 Like again, a little bit of soreness is good.

1:02:33.200 --> 1:02:34.160
 Just don't get so sore,

1:02:34.160 --> 1:02:37.120
 it's compromising your total volume, all right?

1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:38.640
 Mechanical tension is kind of like strength.

1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:41.820
 And this is why if you do even set to five or eight,

1:02:41.820 --> 1:02:43.200
 and you're kind of close to that strength range,

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:45.080
 you will gain a little bit of muscle.

1:02:45.080 --> 1:02:47.080
 Not optimal muscle gain, but you're gonna gain some

1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:48.680
 because everything in these,

1:02:48.680 --> 1:02:50.520
 like physiology didn't cut off at four reps,

1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:52.080
 and then five reps is a different thing, right?

1:02:52.080 --> 1:02:53.000
 It's always a blend.

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.720
 So think of it as like a fading curve.

1:02:55.720 --> 1:02:59.040
 As you get closer to the end, it fades less effective.

1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:02.200
 As you get closer to the middle, it's more effective.

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.720
 Anywhere between eight reps per set to 30,

1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:05.680
 it's equally effective.

1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:07.680
 Past 30, it's gonna blend out.

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:09.820
 Past eight to five to four to three,

1:03:09.820 --> 1:03:13.200
 it's gonna blend lesser there.

1:03:13.200 --> 1:03:15.000
 So metabolic stress is one.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.480
 The damage is the other, or sorry,

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:19.080
 mechanical tension is the one that's heavy.

1:03:19.080 --> 1:03:20.240
 Muscle damage is the other one.

1:03:20.240 --> 1:03:22.120
 The third one is metabolic stress.

1:03:22.120 --> 1:03:27.120
 And this is, I get a bit of an area of scientific contention

1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:28.680
 but something's there.

1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:29.840
 I know something's there.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:32.440
 We're just kind of fumbling to figure out what exactly it is

1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:35.220
 and this is, metabolic stress is the burn, right?

1:03:35.220 --> 1:03:36.060
 It's there.

1:03:36.060 --> 1:03:40.180
 It's why blood flow restriction training probably works.

1:03:40.180 --> 1:03:41.380
 That's done very light.

1:03:41.380 --> 1:03:42.460
 So there's no mechanical tension.

1:03:42.460 --> 1:03:43.820
 There's very little damage,

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:46.180
 but somehow it induces a good amount of hypertrophy.

1:03:46.180 --> 1:03:47.020
 Very painful.

1:03:47.020 --> 1:03:48.100
 Oh boy.

1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:51.560
 I tried this, I have a friend, former special operator

1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:54.300
 who was on the East coast and took me

1:03:54.300 --> 1:03:57.940
 through a blood flow restriction training protocol

1:03:57.940 --> 1:03:58.780
 in a park.

1:03:58.780 --> 1:04:02.860
 And I don't think I actually cried, but-

1:04:02.860 --> 1:04:03.700
 You probably did.

1:04:03.700 --> 1:04:06.180
 I might've cried out once or twice.

1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:10.220
 It was unbelievable, especially the lower body movements.

1:04:10.220 --> 1:04:11.680
 Now it was a humid day.

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.580
 I'll claim a little bit of jet lag, but it was brutal.

1:04:14.580 --> 1:04:15.760
 It was really brutal.

1:04:15.760 --> 1:04:16.600
 And I also-

1:04:16.600 --> 1:04:17.880
 Do it on the best day of your life and it's still brutal.

1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:20.140
 Okay, well, that makes me feel a little bit better.

1:04:20.140 --> 1:04:21.100
 It was intense.

1:04:21.100 --> 1:04:24.620
 And people should know that it is important

1:04:24.620 --> 1:04:26.580
 to use the proper cuffs for these things.

1:04:26.580 --> 1:04:28.980
 I don't have any relationship to any of the companies

1:04:28.980 --> 1:04:30.780
 that sell these cuffs, but the reason is

1:04:30.780 --> 1:04:32.780
 that you actually need to block particular avenues

1:04:32.780 --> 1:04:33.620
 of blood flow.

1:04:33.620 --> 1:04:35.020
 You can't simply cinch off a muscle.

1:04:35.020 --> 1:04:37.100
 You can't tourniquet a muscle and train.

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:38.780
 You can actually kill yourself that way.

1:04:38.780 --> 1:04:39.620
 Yeah, you can get a blood clot.

1:04:39.620 --> 1:04:40.460
 Yeah.

1:04:40.460 --> 1:04:42.460
 And so if you're interested

1:04:42.460 --> 1:04:43.740
 in blood flow restriction training,

1:04:43.740 --> 1:04:45.340
 I imagine you have some content about this

1:04:45.340 --> 1:04:48.220
 or will at some point, but also there are resources online

1:04:48.220 --> 1:04:49.060
 that people can look up.

1:04:49.060 --> 1:04:50.620
 Yeah, yeah.

1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:52.700
 A question about hypertrophy training

1:04:52.700 --> 1:04:55.780
 that I think many people are wondering about.

1:04:56.940 --> 1:04:58.860
 Train to failure or don't train to failure?

1:04:58.860 --> 1:05:00.100
 Assuming good form.

1:05:00.100 --> 1:05:02.180
 Yeah, okay, assuming good form, great.

1:05:02.180 --> 1:05:03.740
 The answer is both.

1:05:03.740 --> 1:05:05.700
 So you wanna train to failure,

1:05:05.700 --> 1:05:09.060
 but you don't need to go to extreme failure.

1:05:09.060 --> 1:05:10.860
 So you don't need to necessarily go to that,

1:05:10.860 --> 1:05:14.900
 like a partner has to lift the barbell off my chest,

1:05:14.900 --> 1:05:16.820
 but you have to get close.

1:05:16.820 --> 1:05:21.500
 You have to drive either heavy, stress, damage, right,

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:22.860
 or pump.

1:05:22.860 --> 1:05:26.100
 And so a really easy practical way to think about this,

1:05:26.100 --> 1:05:28.020
 I heard Mike Isratil who runs a company

1:05:28.020 --> 1:05:29.620
 called Renaissance Periodization years ago

1:05:29.620 --> 1:05:32.900
 outlined this at a NSCA talk, and it was beautiful.

1:05:32.900 --> 1:05:34.300
 And I thought this is the most eloquent way

1:05:34.300 --> 1:05:37.100
 to explain the context about training hypertrophy.

1:05:37.100 --> 1:05:40.140
 So only to look for three things in your workout.

1:05:40.140 --> 1:05:43.540
 And let's say that you have a particular muscle to grow.

1:05:43.540 --> 1:05:45.420
 Let's say you want your glutes to get larger.

1:05:45.420 --> 1:05:47.660
 Okay, when you're doing your glute exercises,

1:05:47.660 --> 1:05:50.860
 number one, are you feeling the glute contract?

1:05:50.860 --> 1:05:52.020
 Okay, it doesn't have to be there,

1:05:52.020 --> 1:05:54.540
 but that's a good sign if it is.

1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:56.700
 Okay, let's say I didn't really feel my glute contract.

1:05:56.700 --> 1:05:58.940
 I felt it more in my quads or my back.

1:05:58.940 --> 1:06:00.260
 Okay.

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:03.400
 Did you feel a big pump afterwards?

1:06:03.400 --> 1:06:05.860
 No, I didn't really feel a pump there either, or during.

1:06:05.860 --> 1:06:06.700
 Okay, great.

1:06:06.700 --> 1:06:08.100
 Number three, next day,

1:06:08.100 --> 1:06:09.880
 did you feel a little bit of soreness there at all?

1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:10.860
 No, I didn't.

1:06:10.860 --> 1:06:11.980
 Well, that's a very good indication.

1:06:11.980 --> 1:06:13.100
 You didn't feel it during the workout.

1:06:13.100 --> 1:06:15.740
 You felt no sort of pump and it didn't get sore.

1:06:15.740 --> 1:06:17.740
 Don't expect much growth.

1:06:17.740 --> 1:06:18.580
 Didn't happen.

1:06:18.580 --> 1:06:20.500
 You distributed the work across a bunch of muscle groups.

1:06:20.500 --> 1:06:23.060
 Most likely other muscle groups were too involved, right?

1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:23.900
 Especially if you're like,

1:06:23.900 --> 1:06:26.400
 no, but man, my back got really,

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:27.740
 well, that's a really good indication

1:06:27.740 --> 1:06:29.980
 of telling you what the hell was moving.

1:06:29.980 --> 1:06:31.500
 And so in terms of targets,

1:06:31.500 --> 1:06:35.060
 if you were to put, again, a one to 10 scale,

1:06:35.060 --> 1:06:37.660
 how much should I feel it burning during?

1:06:37.660 --> 1:06:39.060
 Anything less than a three,

1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:42.040
 okay, it's probably not doing much, right?

1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:43.980
 But it doesn't, like seven is not,

1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:45.620
 a 10 is not better than seven.

1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:47.340
 You need to feel it, but it doesn't have to be like,

1:06:47.340 --> 1:06:49.540
 oh my gosh, I'm dying here.

1:06:49.540 --> 1:06:51.260
 Soreness, same barometer, right?

1:06:51.260 --> 1:06:54.300
 So if you can get like three, three and three,

1:06:54.300 --> 1:06:55.620
 you're probably in a pretty good spot.

1:06:55.620 --> 1:06:58.120
 Five, five and five is maybe better,

1:06:58.120 --> 1:07:00.100
 but you don't need to go much past that.

1:07:00.100 --> 1:07:02.780
 So I want you to feel the muscle group either working

1:07:02.780 --> 1:07:04.140
 or if you're like, oh, I didn't feel it much.

1:07:04.140 --> 1:07:04.980
 I didn't really get a pump,

1:07:04.980 --> 1:07:06.300
 but the next day it got really sore.

1:07:06.300 --> 1:07:08.740
 Well, then you're still, you know, you're on a good path.

1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:10.580
 Again, really sore as in like,

1:07:10.580 --> 1:07:13.540
 oh, a little tender, but next day it's okay.

1:07:13.540 --> 1:07:15.580
 Day after that, I could train, no problem.

1:07:15.580 --> 1:07:17.320
 That's really what you want to go after.

1:07:17.320 --> 1:07:18.880
 And in terms of understanding,

1:07:19.720 --> 1:07:22.980
 is this likely to produce some growth or not?

1:07:22.980 --> 1:07:25.900
 Excellent, excellent, very clear parameters

1:07:25.900 --> 1:07:28.060
 and recommendations I know are benefiting me

1:07:28.060 --> 1:07:30.300
 and will benefit a lot of people.

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:33.320
 If you'd be willing to throw out a few sort of sets

1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:36.940
 and rep parameters that could act as broad guidelines

1:07:36.940 --> 1:07:40.240
 for people who want to explore further,

1:07:41.220 --> 1:07:44.100
 I realized that with all these modifiable variables

1:07:44.100 --> 1:07:46.960
 that there's no one size fits all, four strength.

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:48.880
 I love this five to 30 for hypertrophy.

1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:49.720
 That's the prebital thing.

1:07:49.720 --> 1:07:51.940
 I don't think I've ever done a 30 rep set of anything,

1:07:51.940 --> 1:07:53.620
 but now that you've thrown that out there,

1:07:53.620 --> 1:07:54.460
 I see it as a bit of a challenge.

1:07:54.460 --> 1:07:56.540
 You want to know what's awesome about 30?

1:07:56.540 --> 1:07:58.380
 You're going to get an insane pump.

1:07:58.380 --> 1:07:59.620
 You're going to burn like crazy,

1:07:59.620 --> 1:08:01.660
 but you won't get super sore

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:03.660
 because the mechanical tension is so low.

1:08:03.660 --> 1:08:04.980
 It's so light.

1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:07.500
 So you can get away with those things and you,

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:09.640
 it's hard because your mind is going to wander.

1:08:09.640 --> 1:08:10.620
 You're going to get it like rep 20

1:08:10.620 --> 1:08:11.460
 and you're going to be like, I'm done.

1:08:11.460 --> 1:08:14.340
 And you're like, no, there's a lot left here to get to 30.

1:08:14.340 --> 1:08:16.500
 Where like a set of 10 is much easier.

1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:18.240
 Like you're just like, okay, two more, two more.

1:08:18.240 --> 1:08:20.660
 Set of 30 is like, I got 16 more.

1:08:20.660 --> 1:08:21.480
 It's awful, but you're not going to get this.

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:23.260
 It's terrible, right?

1:08:23.260 --> 1:08:25.060
 And people tend to just kind of like check out.

1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:28.220
 So 30 is possible, but a little bit extreme, extreme.

1:08:28.220 --> 1:08:29.860
 But I would recommend all of them.

1:08:29.860 --> 1:08:31.220
 Like it's a really fun play.

1:08:31.220 --> 1:08:33.900
 You can do different in the same workout too, by the way.

1:08:33.900 --> 1:08:37.780
 Like you could do one set of 10 pushups

1:08:37.780 --> 1:08:39.820
 and then take a little break and then do a set of 25.

1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:41.680
 You can mix and match these things.

1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:44.820
 There's no magic recipe that has to happen for all those

1:08:44.820 --> 1:08:45.660
 or do it different.

1:08:45.660 --> 1:08:47.380
 So Mondays are my sets of 10 days.

1:08:47.380 --> 1:08:48.940
 Wednesdays are my set of 20 days

1:08:48.940 --> 1:08:51.060
 and Fridays are my set of 30 days.

1:08:51.060 --> 1:08:52.260
 And you can have all kinds of fun there

1:08:52.260 --> 1:08:54.200
 and it's hard to screw up.

1:08:54.200 --> 1:08:56.920
 Great, I love that phrase is always reassuring.

1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:01.900
 So for strength, is there a sets and reps protocol

1:09:01.900 --> 1:09:04.540
 that is pretty surefire?

1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:08.040
 So a way to just think about a really fast answer

1:09:08.040 --> 1:09:11.020
 for power, well, speed, power and strength

1:09:11.860 --> 1:09:15.020
 is what I just call the three to five concept, right?

1:09:15.020 --> 1:09:17.060
 So pick three to five exercises.

1:09:17.060 --> 1:09:20.200
 If you're feeling better that day, choose on the higher end.

1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:21.540
 If you're feeling less that day

1:09:21.540 --> 1:09:24.260
 or you have a shorter timeframe to train, go less.

1:09:24.260 --> 1:09:27.160
 So this would be three sets or three exercises rather

1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:28.220
 or five exercises the most.

1:09:28.220 --> 1:09:32.540
 So three to five exercises, do three to five reps,

1:09:32.540 --> 1:09:35.800
 three to five sets, take three to five minutes rest

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:38.580
 in between and do it three to five times a week.

1:09:38.580 --> 1:09:41.140
 So that can be as little as three sets of three

1:09:42.040 --> 1:09:45.120
 for three exercises, three times a week.

1:09:45.120 --> 1:09:47.300
 That's a 20 minute workout three times a week.

1:09:47.300 --> 1:09:50.660
 It can be as high as five sets of five for five exercises,

1:09:50.660 --> 1:09:52.080
 five days a week.

1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:54.620
 So it's very broad and allows people to still stay

1:09:54.620 --> 1:09:57.340
 within the domains of strength and power

1:09:57.340 --> 1:10:00.140
 while still being able to move and contour toward

1:10:00.140 --> 1:10:03.300
 their lifestyle and soreness and time and all those things.

1:10:03.300 --> 1:10:05.020
 The only differentiator to pay attention to

1:10:05.020 --> 1:10:09.500
 between power and strength is intensity.

1:10:09.500 --> 1:10:11.060
 So if you want strength,

1:10:11.060 --> 1:10:14.460
 this is now 85% plus of your max, right?

1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:16.660
 If you want power, it needs to be a lot lighter

1:10:16.660 --> 1:10:19.220
 because you need to move more towards the velocity

1:10:19.220 --> 1:10:20.940
 into the spectrum because power is strength

1:10:20.940 --> 1:10:22.580
 multiplied by speed.

1:10:22.580 --> 1:10:26.260
 So while getting stronger by definition can help power,

1:10:26.260 --> 1:10:27.800
 you probably want to spend more of your time

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:32.800
 in the 40% to 70% range, like plus or minus.

1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:34.280
 So that's it.

1:10:34.280 --> 1:10:36.020
 Both of them conceptually they'll work everything else.

1:10:36.020 --> 1:10:38.860
 The exercise, the reps, the frequency,

1:10:38.860 --> 1:10:40.980
 all that can be still in the three to five range.

1:10:40.980 --> 1:10:42.220
 Just change the intensity depending

1:10:42.220 --> 1:10:43.500
 on which outcome you want.

1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:47.520
 So the nervous system obviously plays an important role

1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:49.320
 at the level of nerves controlling

1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:51.140
 the contraction of muscle fibers.

1:10:51.140 --> 1:10:53.320
 But of course we have these upper motor neurons,

1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:55.540
 which are the ones that reside in our brain

1:10:55.540 --> 1:10:58.360
 that control the lower motor neurons that control muscle.

1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:02.080
 And this takes us into the realm of where the mind is at

1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:04.080
 during a particular movement.

1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:08.040
 And to me, this is not an abstract thing.

1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:11.080
 I can imagine doing workouts that are mainly focused

1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:15.340
 on strength or mainly focused on hypertrophy.

1:11:15.340 --> 1:11:19.340
 And in the case of strength, am I trying to move weights?

1:11:19.340 --> 1:11:21.720
 And when I'm trying to generate hypertrophy,

1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:24.360
 am I trying to quote unquote, challenge muscles?

1:11:24.360 --> 1:11:27.440
 In other words, if I'm just trying to move a weight

1:11:27.440 --> 1:11:30.480
 away from my body, pushing a bench press

1:11:30.480 --> 1:11:34.160
 or an overhead press, I don't know that I want my mind

1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:36.240
 thinking about the contraction of my medial delts.

1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:39.060
 I think I want my mind in getting the weight overhead

1:11:39.060 --> 1:11:43.420
 with the best proper form, best, excuse me, and proper form.

1:11:43.420 --> 1:11:45.360
 And certainly with hypertrophy training,

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:49.080
 best improper form is going to be the target as well.

1:11:49.080 --> 1:11:54.080
 But that simple, or I should say subtle mental shift

1:11:54.240 --> 1:11:58.760
 changes the patterns of nerve fiber recruitment.

1:11:58.760 --> 1:12:02.640
 So can we say to get stronger, focus on moving weights,

1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:04.440
 still with proper form and safely,

1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:07.880
 and to get hypertrophy, focus on challenging muscles,

1:12:07.880 --> 1:12:10.640
 still with proper form and safely?

1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.120
 It's very fair.

1:12:12.120 --> 1:12:14.800
 Yeah, as a snapshot answer,

1:12:14.800 --> 1:12:16.960
 it is a very fair thing to think about.

1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:20.080
 Intentionality matters for both.

1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:23.280
 In other words, if you look at some interesting science

1:12:23.280 --> 1:12:26.440
 that's been done on power development and speed development,

1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:29.800
 the intent to move is actually more important

1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:31.440
 than the actual movement velocity.

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:35.240
 So if you're doing say something for power or strength,

1:12:35.240 --> 1:12:38.000
 and you're doing just enough to get the bar up,

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.600
 that will result in less improvements in strength

1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:43.180
 than even if you're moving at the exact same speed,

1:12:43.180 --> 1:12:45.480
 but you're intending to move faster.

1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:48.260
 And this is one of the reasons why good coaching matters.

1:12:48.260 --> 1:12:49.520
 So if you're coaching an athlete

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:51.560
 through a power workout especially,

1:12:51.560 --> 1:12:53.880
 and they're doing enough to just lift 50%

1:12:53.880 --> 1:12:54.720
 of their one rep max,

1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:56.800
 it's not going to generate as much speed development

1:12:56.800 --> 1:12:59.320
 as them trying to move that bar as fast as they can,

1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:02.560
 even if the net result is the same bar by velocity.

1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:04.400
 Turns out nerves matter.

1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:06.520
 That's a, I mean, I was about to say amazing,

1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:07.680
 but as a neuroscientist,

1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:09.240
 if I say amazing that nerves matter.

1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:12.040
 What's amazing to me is what, if I understand correctly,

1:13:12.040 --> 1:13:15.740
 what you're saying is that even if the bar is moving

1:13:15.740 --> 1:13:18.360
 at the same speed, same weight,

1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:21.700
 if my internal representation, my thoughts are,

1:13:21.700 --> 1:13:24.100
 I'm trying to move this as fast as possible

1:13:24.100 --> 1:13:27.200
 versus I'm just trying to get the bar away from me

1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:30.720
 and get the weight up, I'm going to get different outcomes.

1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:32.120
 Yep, this is quality of work, right?

1:13:32.120 --> 1:13:34.440
 This is, did you do enough to just check off the box

1:13:34.440 --> 1:13:39.060
 or did you actually strive for adaptation, right?

1:13:39.060 --> 1:13:41.780
 Similar concept actually works for hypertrophy

1:13:41.780 --> 1:13:45.200
 in terms of there is a handful of very recent studies

1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:46.040
 that have looked at what we'll call

1:13:46.040 --> 1:13:47.760
 the mind-muscle connection,

1:13:47.760 --> 1:13:50.600
 and this is doing things like imagine a bicep curl,

1:13:50.600 --> 1:13:53.160
 and you're simply looking at and watching your biceps

1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:54.840
 and you're thinking about contracting it harder.

1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:56.560
 Even though you execute the same repetitions

1:13:56.560 --> 1:13:58.280
 at the same exact intensity,

1:13:58.280 --> 1:14:01.680
 initial indications are the mind-body connection

1:14:01.680 --> 1:14:05.140
 are going to result in more growth than not.

1:14:05.140 --> 1:14:09.520
 You just gave authorization for people

1:14:09.520 --> 1:14:11.560
 to look at their muscles contracting in the gym.

1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:14.360
 Please do, yeah, of course, right?

1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:16.400
 But the selfie is still ruled out.

1:14:16.400 --> 1:14:18.760
 I'd rather you look at your muscles than your phone,

1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:20.080
 so I'm fine with it.

1:14:21.380 --> 1:14:24.960
 Those are initial, we don't have a large depth of research

1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:27.840
 to support that and maybe some stuff will come encounter it,

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:31.020
 but it does, it matches what folks in that community

1:14:31.020 --> 1:14:32.740
 have been saying for a very long time, right?

1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:36.000
 There's actually some stuff on simply flexing in between.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.520
 So if you've ever seen a bodybuilder,

1:14:37.520 --> 1:14:38.960
 they'll do their set of bicep curls

1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:40.360
 and then they'll get out and they'll flex and they'll check,

1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:42.160
 and they're literally, this is what Arnold did, right?

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:43.760
 This is, if you go back to pumping an iron.

1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:46.200
 Or college weight rooms, I should say.

1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:48.640
 For some reason, there's something about that age group.

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:51.740
 There's a lot of checking of biceps in college weight rooms

1:14:51.740 --> 1:14:53.280
 for reasons that escape me.

1:14:53.280 --> 1:14:55.860
 If you ever interact with my wife,

1:14:55.860 --> 1:14:56.900
 she will be the first to tell you,

1:14:56.900 --> 1:14:59.760
 I cannot walk past a mirror without like,

1:14:59.760 --> 1:15:00.600
 I'm checking something out.

1:15:00.600 --> 1:15:01.440
 You can't?

1:15:01.440 --> 1:15:02.260
 Or that she can't?

1:15:02.260 --> 1:15:03.100
 I can't.

1:15:03.100 --> 1:15:03.940
 Not her, me.

1:15:03.940 --> 1:15:04.760
 Like I'm the one that cannot walk past.

1:15:04.760 --> 1:15:05.600
 All right.

1:15:05.600 --> 1:15:06.440
 Well then I'll be careful not to disparage that.

1:15:06.440 --> 1:15:08.360
 It has nothing to do with the hypertrophy,

1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:09.780
 but I'm just like, I'm a muscle guy.

1:15:09.780 --> 1:15:12.360
 So I'm always like thinking and tinkering or whatever.

1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:17.200
 But yeah, it is, I think it's very much worth your time

1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:20.440
 to do a higher quality training session,

1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:23.560
 be more intentional, be present,

1:15:23.560 --> 1:15:25.520
 than just executing the same exact workout.

1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:28.560
 I think that's globally very clear to be to your advantage.

1:15:28.560 --> 1:15:31.480
 So if you're thinking, look, I'm gonna,

1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:33.120
 like I don't wanna work out today.

1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:34.840
 I got all this going on or I'm tired or whatever.

1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:37.280
 I'm just gonna do the workout anyways and get through it.

1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:38.660
 Okay.

1:15:38.660 --> 1:15:39.920
 If you can go, you know what though?

1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:42.840
 Like I'm gonna cut 15 minutes out of this thing.

1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:43.800
 I'm gonna get my head right.

1:15:43.800 --> 1:15:46.800
 I'm gonna go get 20 minutes of quality work done.

1:15:46.800 --> 1:15:48.620
 That's your best option by far.

1:15:49.920 --> 1:15:53.880
 You alluded to the fact that even just looking

1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:57.440
 at a particular muscle might benefit

1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:59.380
 in terms of the number of fibers you can recruit

1:15:59.380 --> 1:16:02.560
 or its potential for hypertrophy.

1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:05.080
 I've heard before and I certainly have experienced

1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:07.700
 that muscles that for whatever reason,

1:16:07.700 --> 1:16:11.020
 genetics or sports that one played, et cetera,

1:16:11.020 --> 1:16:13.940
 muscles that we find that we can contract

1:16:13.940 --> 1:16:16.520
 to the point of almost a slightly painful contraction

1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:18.860
 seem to grow more readily than muscles

1:16:18.860 --> 1:16:20.680
 that we can't recruit very easily.

1:16:20.680 --> 1:16:24.040
 And the reason I mentioned sports that we played earlier

1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:26.240
 is you just have to watch the Olympics

1:16:26.240 --> 1:16:27.840
 to see that swimmers obviously

1:16:27.840 --> 1:16:30.500
 are very good at engaging their lats.

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:31.340
 You look at the gymnasts,

1:16:31.340 --> 1:16:33.260
 they seem to be very good at engaging everything.

1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:34.460
 And they go through a huge number

1:16:34.460 --> 1:16:36.960
 of different dynamic movements that explains that.

1:16:38.320 --> 1:16:41.400
 So I find that if people say,

1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:43.160
 oh, I can't get stronger in this

1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:46.000
 or my whatever body part is weak

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:49.040
 in terms of its inability to engage hypertrophy,

1:16:49.040 --> 1:16:51.680
 that oftentimes that can be because of an inability

1:16:51.680 --> 1:16:54.480
 to engage those upper motor neurons

1:16:54.480 --> 1:16:57.360
 to deliberately isolate those muscles.

1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:59.720
 Are there ways that people can learn

1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:04.320
 to engage particular muscle groups more effectively

1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:06.800
 over time for sake of hypertrophy or strength

1:17:06.800 --> 1:17:10.560
 or for cases of trying to overcome injury potential

1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:13.880
 or injury because imbalances are bad across the board?

1:17:13.880 --> 1:17:15.400
 Yeah, this is actually very common

1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:18.080
 and I think everyone has probably gone through this.

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:20.080
 There's some part that you just can't get going.

1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:21.580
 For me, that was the lats.

1:17:21.580 --> 1:17:23.520
 That was the rhomboids, so my back muscles.

1:17:23.520 --> 1:17:26.880
 For years, I couldn't activate my lats or my rhomboids.

1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:27.920
 These are the muscle groups

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:29.080
 that connect your shoulder blades.

1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:30.920
 So if you try to squeeze your shoulder blades together,

1:17:30.920 --> 1:17:33.240
 that set of muscles there are called your rhomboids.

1:17:33.240 --> 1:17:35.040
 Your lats, of course, are more vertical

1:17:35.040 --> 1:17:36.680
 and pull you kind of up and down.

1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:39.260
 No matter how many lat pull-downs I did,

1:17:39.260 --> 1:17:42.200
 bent rows, pull-ups, I could never see any development there,

1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:43.800
 no increase in strength.

1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:47.400
 And it took me probably a decade to figure out

1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:48.880
 how the hell to actually get these things on.

1:17:48.880 --> 1:17:50.880
 In fact, if you would have asked me,

1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:53.600
 even in my college years as a college football player,

1:17:53.600 --> 1:17:55.380
 hey, flex your lats, like show me your lats,

1:17:55.380 --> 1:17:57.260
 you would have seen no movement there.

1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:01.300
 When I was doing a pull-up, in that particular case,

1:18:01.300 --> 1:18:02.640
 the only way I could get the bar to move

1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:05.520
 was by using my biceps, right?

1:18:05.520 --> 1:18:06.640
 So it's a synergistic muscle.

1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:08.760
 It's supposed to be a secondary or tertiary muscle

1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:11.160
 in that movement, but for me, it was primer

1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:14.700
 because of my overstrength in my biceps

1:18:14.700 --> 1:18:18.080
 coupled with my lack of activation in the lats.

1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:19.980
 So you're compensating the same movement.

1:18:19.980 --> 1:18:22.800
 Actually, kind of an easy way to think about this is,

1:18:22.800 --> 1:18:24.240
 imagine doing a bent row.

1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:26.580
 So imagine you're bent over kind of at a 45 degree

1:18:26.580 --> 1:18:28.600
 or a horizontal angle, and you're gonna pull

1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:31.520
 a barbell to your belly button, all right?

1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:33.440
 Now you can actually do that exact same movement

1:18:33.440 --> 1:18:36.520
 with very little back muscle activation

1:18:36.520 --> 1:18:38.460
 by simply flexing your elbows more.

1:18:38.460 --> 1:18:40.440
 And so you think the barbell's going all the way down,

1:18:40.440 --> 1:18:42.200
 it's coming all the way up to touching my belly,

1:18:42.200 --> 1:18:43.040
 and you think you're doing

1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:45.420
 a great back development exercise,

1:18:45.420 --> 1:18:46.860
 when in fact, because of the way

1:18:46.860 --> 1:18:48.520
 that you're executing the movement,

1:18:48.520 --> 1:18:50.400
 you're getting very little back development.

1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:52.160
 And this is a really good example

1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:54.720
 of why someone has done a specific exercise

1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:56.760
 many, many, many times, but yet failed

1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.960
 to see development in a muscle group,

1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:01.160
 which goes back to earlier part of our conversation,

1:19:01.160 --> 1:19:02.740
 which is why exercises themselves

1:19:02.740 --> 1:19:04.840
 do not determine the adaptation.

1:19:04.840 --> 1:19:07.000
 It's the execution that matters, right?

1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:08.720
 It's the technique, it's the rep range,

1:19:08.720 --> 1:19:11.720
 all of those are gonna determine your actual result.

1:19:11.720 --> 1:19:14.760
 So if any time you're banging your head against the wall

1:19:14.760 --> 1:19:18.200
 and thinking like, why am I not getting movement here,

1:19:18.200 --> 1:19:19.960
 growth or strength or whatever,

1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:21.380
 it's almost one of those,

1:19:21.380 --> 1:19:23.280
 it's guaranteed to be one of those areas, right?

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:27.080
 You're probably not getting the muscle groups to activate.

1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:30.000
 In that particular example, just because we're here,

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.100
 try, imagine doing that bent row.

1:19:32.100 --> 1:19:34.400
 Instead of pulling the barbell to your belly,

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:36.380
 squeeze your shoulder blades together first,

1:19:36.380 --> 1:19:38.280
 as far as they can possibly go,

1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:39.820
 and then bring your elbows up

1:19:39.820 --> 1:19:43.320
 without changing the angle of your elbow.

1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:44.740
 So in other words, without bringing your hand

1:19:44.740 --> 1:19:46.180
 closer to your shoulder.

1:19:46.180 --> 1:19:47.440
 So keep that same angle and come up

1:19:47.440 --> 1:19:49.140
 as high as you possibly can,

1:19:49.140 --> 1:19:50.680
 and then finish out the movement.

1:19:50.680 --> 1:19:53.520
 That's going to guarantee a utilization first

1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:56.680
 of the back muscles and a finishing with the biceps

1:19:57.900 --> 1:20:00.600
 at the end, which is how that movement is supposed to go.

1:20:00.600 --> 1:20:03.080
 So how do you coach into that?

1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:04.440
 Well, it can be a number of things.

1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:07.800
 Whenever I'm diagnosing movement quality,

1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:09.380
 I look for a handful of things,

1:20:09.380 --> 1:20:10.880
 but very first one is awareness.

1:20:10.880 --> 1:20:13.440
 You'd be surprised how many folks,

1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:15.520
 when you just simply tell them that muscle group right there

1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:17.520
 and maybe you give them a tactical prompt,

1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:19.820
 so you touch it or you put something against it.

1:20:19.820 --> 1:20:22.180
 This is actually why, sorry, I'm jumping over the place,

1:20:22.180 --> 1:20:26.160
 but this is why things like a belt work very well

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:28.880
 for actually increasing abdominal strength.

1:20:28.880 --> 1:20:31.320
 So a misconception out there is if you wear like a belt

1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:32.560
 when you're lifting,

1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:34.320
 then the belt kind of does all the work for you

1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:35.940
 and your abs get weaker.

1:20:35.940 --> 1:20:39.920
 That can happen, but the exact opposite can happen as well.

1:20:39.920 --> 1:20:41.800
 So if you take a belt, for example,

1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:43.800
 and you cinch it down really tight,

1:20:43.800 --> 1:20:46.360
 and then you just completely disregard your midsection,

1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:48.880
 you will see a loss of strength in your midsection

1:20:48.880 --> 1:20:50.520
 because now the belt is doing the work.

1:20:50.520 --> 1:20:52.800
 But if you put the belt on just a little bit,

1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:55.640
 kind of tight to where you get some sensory feedback

1:20:55.640 --> 1:20:58.480
 and you think about using that belt

1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:00.520
 as a way to activate the core musculature,

1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:01.640
 you will actually see a higher,

1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:04.160
 and if we look at like EMG activation,

1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:06.680
 the core muscles would be activated higher

1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:09.520
 to a greater extent than when the belt is off.

1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:11.040
 Because of proprioceptive feedback.

1:21:11.040 --> 1:21:11.880
 100%.

1:21:11.880 --> 1:21:14.560
 And for those that are wondering what proprioceptive feedback

1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:17.920
 is, proprioceptive feedback is that there are nerves

1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:19.160
 that extend out to the muscles

1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:20.400
 that control muscle contractions,

1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:23.160
 but then there are sensory inputs from the skin and muscle

1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:24.520
 that go back into the nervous system

1:21:24.520 --> 1:21:25.780
 and those work in concert.

1:21:25.780 --> 1:21:27.760
 And that feedback is proprioceptive.

1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:31.260
 I think it literally translates to a knowledge

1:21:31.260 --> 1:21:34.360
 of where one's limbs are and what's happening on those.

1:21:34.360 --> 1:21:35.500
 In space, yeah.

1:21:35.500 --> 1:21:39.440
 I've seen, I don't have a training partner,

1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:42.280
 but I've seen in gyms where someone will be training

1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:44.960
 and someone would tap the muscle of the person

1:21:44.960 --> 1:21:47.120
 who's doing the work in order to,

1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:49.200
 this is consensual tapping of other people's muscles,

1:21:49.200 --> 1:21:51.960
 not walking around touching people's muscles, please.

1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:56.380
 To provide that proprioceptive feedback

1:21:56.380 --> 1:21:58.400
 so that the person doing the exercises

1:21:58.400 --> 1:22:00.540
 becomes more aware of the muscle

1:22:00.540 --> 1:22:01.680
 that they're supposed to be training.

1:22:01.680 --> 1:22:04.480
 And it seems that that's probably an effective practice.

1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:05.480
 Yeah.

1:22:05.480 --> 1:22:06.680
 I'll give you two examples.

1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:08.320
 I'll go to the back with that pulling movement,

1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:09.900
 but then I'll stay on the belt really quickly.

1:22:09.900 --> 1:22:13.480
 So a very easy example that you can do right now listening,

1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:14.800
 and I learned this from Brian McKenzie,

1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:15.880
 our mutual friend, right?

1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:18.300
 So if you take your hands and open them up,

1:22:18.300 --> 1:22:20.960
 like you make an L with both your hands,

1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:23.180
 and I'll take those and put them around your waist

1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:25.160
 just above your hip bones.

1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:26.760
 Now, what I want you to do is press out

1:22:26.760 --> 1:22:29.760
 as hard as you can on your hands with your core.

1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:32.000
 And you can feel a lot of core activation.

1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:33.560
 Most people think core activation

1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:35.560
 is the front of your stomach, right?

1:22:35.560 --> 1:22:36.640
 Your six pack.

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:38.760
 What you need to do is create a cylinder around your back.

1:22:38.760 --> 1:22:42.360
 So it's the front, it's the side, and it's the back.

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:44.960
 So if you take your two fingers, point them.

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:47.280
 Now put them just outside your belly button.

1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:51.440
 Can you move your fingers by just moving your ab muscles?

1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:53.800
 90% of people can do yes.

1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:55.080
 Same exact thing.

1:22:55.080 --> 1:22:56.720
 Now go to that same position

1:22:56.720 --> 1:22:58.680
 just above what's called your ASIS,

1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:00.280
 so your anterior superior iliac spine,

1:23:00.280 --> 1:23:03.600
 right up that front of your hip bone, right in the front.

1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:05.580
 Can you now move?

1:23:05.580 --> 1:23:08.760
 Great, 50% of people are not gonna get any movement there.

1:23:08.760 --> 1:23:09.600
 Really?

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:12.900
 Take your thumb and go right above your PSIS.

1:23:12.900 --> 1:23:13.740
 My what?

1:23:13.740 --> 1:23:16.880
 PSIS, posterior superior iliac spine, right?

1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:18.160
 Now, can you move?

1:23:20.620 --> 1:23:21.720
 Most likely no.

1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:24.800
 Sort of if I do a mini little back extension.

1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:27.220
 Don't, just with your core musculature.

1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:29.000
 Barely.

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:31.480
 Yeah, 90% of people can't.

1:23:31.480 --> 1:23:34.080
 If you can't perform that contraction,

1:23:34.080 --> 1:23:36.160
 you can't stabilize your spine.

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:38.400
 So only way to get stabilization in your spine

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:41.160
 is then to go through hyperextension.

1:23:41.160 --> 1:23:42.560
 And now that's a compression strategy

1:23:42.560 --> 1:23:43.480
 you're putting on your spine.

1:23:43.480 --> 1:23:46.380
 It's better than rounding your back, like going forward,

1:23:46.380 --> 1:23:48.840
 but overextension is not great either.

1:23:48.840 --> 1:23:51.040
 So you wanna be able to flex the musculature

1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:53.800
 in a cylindric fashion so you have control.

1:23:53.800 --> 1:23:55.240
 So if you go back to our very first things

1:23:55.240 --> 1:23:57.120
 and with your hands open and you put them right here,

1:23:57.120 --> 1:23:59.480
 and if you're like, I can't get activation,

1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:02.240
 if you pay attention to your thumb, right?

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:04.520
 Now just move your thumb.

1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:07.040
 And now you see activation back there, right?

1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:07.880
 Boom.

1:24:07.880 --> 1:24:10.360
 Now if you can imagine turning that on just a little bit,

1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:12.460
 and now notice how I can do this, by the way,

1:24:12.460 --> 1:24:14.200
 at the same time I'm talking.

1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:15.040
 If you have to go,

1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:18.480
 we don't have control, right?

1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:22.680
 So you have to be able to separate breath from brace.

1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:24.700
 So now if I can put myself in a position,

1:24:24.700 --> 1:24:27.320
 and Kelly Starrett has always said 20%,

1:24:27.320 --> 1:24:29.440
 give me 20% activation here.

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:31.620
 And now I can squat, I can hinge, I can jump.

1:24:31.620 --> 1:24:34.400
 I don't need to be locked down to 100% scream

1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:35.820
 to be able to brace my spine.

1:24:35.820 --> 1:24:38.040
 That's gonna be ineffective and wasteful.

1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:39.100
 I wanna be here.

1:24:39.100 --> 1:24:41.600
 Well, the belt provides that proprioceptive feedback

1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:44.020
 where I can put it on 20%.

1:24:44.020 --> 1:24:45.940
 And it just is a reminder,

1:24:45.940 --> 1:24:47.360
 if I don't press against the belt,

1:24:47.360 --> 1:24:48.960
 the belt slides and falls down a little bit

1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:50.520
 because it's not on super tight.

1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:53.920
 If it's on so dang tight, it's doing the work and I forget.

1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:57.080
 So we just want a little bit of feedback there.

1:24:57.080 --> 1:24:58.400
 Same thing with your upper back.

1:24:58.400 --> 1:25:00.440
 If you're having a difficult time activating those rhomboids

1:25:00.440 --> 1:25:02.880
 or those lats, someone can do a simple thing

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:04.080
 where they take their finger,

1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:05.880
 put it right between your shoulder blades.

1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:07.040
 And you just tell them things like,

1:25:07.040 --> 1:25:09.320
 hey, squeeze my finger, squeeze my finger.

1:25:09.320 --> 1:25:11.600
 As you're doing your bent row where you're pulled down,

1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:13.080
 you can touch the lat.

1:25:13.080 --> 1:25:15.200
 You can do just visualization stuff.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:19.360
 So just imagine like a 3D rendering of that muscle group.

1:25:19.360 --> 1:25:21.000
 And you're watching that muscle group contract.

1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.360
 It's very powerful and very effective to do it.

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:25.340
 So a touch, a visual,

1:25:25.340 --> 1:25:29.520
 all this stuff can help get people to activate.

1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:31.700
 Outside of simple awareness,

1:25:31.700 --> 1:25:34.840
 typically eccentric overload is a very effective way

1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:38.120
 for activation of a difficult to target muscle.

1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:39.800
 So the lowering of the bar

1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:41.220
 or the lowering of the weight.

1:25:41.220 --> 1:25:43.680
 The movement of the weight away from the body

1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:45.040
 is not necessarily always lowering

1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:46.040
 because that kind of depends on what

1:25:46.040 --> 1:25:47.280
 muscle group you're doing.

1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:51.520
 Things like a pull-up.

1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:53.600
 Okay, so if I'm going to do a pull-up

1:25:53.600 --> 1:25:54.820
 and I have poor lat activation,

1:25:54.820 --> 1:25:57.080
 I can still get the pull-up muscle movement

1:25:57.080 --> 1:25:59.100
 executed by contraction of the biceps

1:25:59.100 --> 1:25:59.940
 and things like that.

1:25:59.940 --> 1:26:01.960
 However, to make the movement simpler,

1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:03.480
 I'm going to go all the way to the top.

1:26:03.480 --> 1:26:05.080
 So imagine stepping on a box or something,

1:26:05.080 --> 1:26:07.360
 going all the way to that top of that pull-up position.

1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:08.200
 And starting from there,

1:26:08.200 --> 1:26:11.480
 I want you to simply lower it under control.

1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:13.440
 And so you're just simply breaking the movement down

1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:14.800
 into smaller pieces that allow you

1:26:14.800 --> 1:26:17.600
 to focus on the execution more.

1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:18.440
 It's going to be great.

1:26:18.440 --> 1:26:20.400
 Eccentrics are great for strength development,

1:26:20.400 --> 1:26:22.040
 very good for hypertrophy,

1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:23.680
 and allow you to focus on control.

1:26:23.680 --> 1:26:26.600
 I'm willing to bet a huge percentage of you out there

1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:28.480
 who've like, I've never had a sore lat.

1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:30.840
 You know, I've done a lot of pull-ups and things like that.

1:26:30.840 --> 1:26:32.200
 If you do that eccentric only,

1:26:32.200 --> 1:26:33.280
 you'll probably wake up the next day going,

1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:36.560
 oh gosh, I feel it there.

1:26:36.560 --> 1:26:37.400
 And that's a sign,

1:26:37.400 --> 1:26:38.440
 even if you didn't feel it in the workout,

1:26:38.440 --> 1:26:40.840
 but I got a little sore the next day,

1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:41.920
 keep down that path.

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:45.200
 And then eventually you'll be able to do a concentric,

1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:46.560
 maybe take a break,

1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:49.320
 maybe do an isometric where you just hold that position,

1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:52.120
 and eventually work that into a progression

1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:53.800
 where you can do the concentric, eccentric,

1:26:53.800 --> 1:26:56.080
 and isometric portions and get activation.

1:26:56.080 --> 1:26:59.120
 So that may take you six weeks,

1:26:59.120 --> 1:27:00.640
 may take you six months,

1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:02.000
 but that's generally a pretty good strategy

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000
 for learning how to activate a muscle group.

1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:05.240
 Terrific suggestions.

1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:08.940
 Is it true that eccentric emphasized movements

1:27:08.940 --> 1:27:11.000
 might require a little bit longer recovery

1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:13.560
 or they lead to more soreness than concentric movements?

1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:14.720
 Yeah, they typically can,

1:27:14.720 --> 1:27:16.920
 but they're also higher force output.

1:27:16.920 --> 1:27:19.280
 So very good for strength development,

1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:22.520
 but they're going to lead on average to more soreness.

1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:25.840
 So more potential for intracellular disruption,

1:27:25.840 --> 1:27:27.200
 that is going to be associated with pain.

1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:28.320
 There's not as much,

1:27:28.320 --> 1:27:31.240
 people will like to explain muscle soreness

1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:34.200
 as a result of microtrauma and micro tears in the muscle.

1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:36.500
 That can happen, but that's not the norm.

1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:40.660
 Most of the time it is things like disruption of calcium

1:27:40.660 --> 1:27:42.480
 that's going to lead to excessive swelling,

1:27:42.480 --> 1:27:43.320
 excessive pressure,

1:27:43.320 --> 1:27:45.820
 and that's going to be then translated as extreme pain.

1:27:45.820 --> 1:27:48.000
 So that's probably explaining more of muscle soreness

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.840
 than actually microtrauma.

1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:51.680
 Terrific.

1:27:51.680 --> 1:27:53.360
 I was going to get to breathing later,

1:27:53.360 --> 1:27:54.800
 but maybe just for now,

1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:59.800
 if we can do a brief little foray into breathing

1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:02.600
 as it relates to weight training.

1:28:02.600 --> 1:28:05.920
 Is there a prescriptive for how to breathe

1:28:05.920 --> 1:28:07.960
 during resistance training?

1:28:07.960 --> 1:28:09.460
 Here I'm thinking with weights,

1:28:09.460 --> 1:28:11.280
 not necessarily body weight only movements,

1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:12.600
 although I suppose it could be,

1:28:12.600 --> 1:28:17.440
 that applies 75% of the time to 75% of the people.

1:28:17.440 --> 1:28:18.320
 What I was taught,

1:28:18.320 --> 1:28:19.920
 and I'm hoping you're going to tell me this was wrong,

1:28:19.920 --> 1:28:23.360
 because then there might be more benefits awaiting me,

1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:27.480
 is that I should exhale on the effort

1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:32.480
 and inhale on the lesser effort portion of an exercise.

1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:34.520
 Is that true?

1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:36.120
 Is there a better way to breathe?

1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:39.560
 There is a better way to think about it.

1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:43.200
 So number one, if you can breathe and brace,

1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:44.960
 then this conversation goes away.

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:48.880
 So if you can maintain intramuscular,

1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:51.720
 intra-abdominal pressure while breathing,

1:28:51.720 --> 1:28:53.980
 then I don't really care when you breathe.

1:28:53.980 --> 1:28:56.240
 Very challenging to do at very heavy weights.

1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:01.040
 If we flag this on two areas of a paradigm,

1:29:01.040 --> 1:29:04.400
 paradigm one over here, you're going to do a set of 30,

1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:05.480
 and you're going to do front squats

1:29:05.480 --> 1:29:08.280
 where a barbell is sitting on your throat.

1:29:08.280 --> 1:29:10.280
 If you don't take a breath,

1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:12.320
 this is going to end one way and one way only,

1:29:12.320 --> 1:29:13.820
 you passing out.

1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:15.280
 Clearly has to be some breathing strategy.

1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:16.400
 The other end of the spectrum is,

1:29:16.400 --> 1:29:18.520
 let's say you're going to do a vertical jump.

1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:19.960
 You don't need any amount of breath there.

1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:21.160
 It's never going to happen, right?

1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:23.720
 The question is, what about in the middle, right?

1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:25.740
 So I'm doing some sort of strength training there.

1:29:25.740 --> 1:29:27.680
 Well, number one, make sure you're braced

1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:32.160
 and then you can get away with less need to worry about it.

1:29:33.760 --> 1:29:38.480
 In general, a decent strategy is to maintain a breath hold

1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:40.440
 during the lowering or eccentric

1:29:40.440 --> 1:29:41.920
 or most dangerous part of the movement,

1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:44.000
 and then you can exhale on the concentric portion.

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.160
 So if the bench press is our example,

1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:50.600
 if you held in, braced, lowered under control,

1:29:50.600 --> 1:29:52.520
 and now started the concentric pushing away force,

1:29:52.520 --> 1:29:54.480
 and then you wanted to take an expiration,

1:29:55.720 --> 1:29:57.880
 during the last half of the concentric portion,

1:29:57.880 --> 1:29:58.800
 that's an okay strategy.

1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:01.040
 If you're going to do a single rep,

1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:02.500
 you don't need to worry about it.

1:30:02.500 --> 1:30:04.800
 You can just avoid or omit breathing entirely.

1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:05.840
 You're going to be just fine.

1:30:05.840 --> 1:30:07.140
 If you're doing more than that,

1:30:07.140 --> 1:30:09.720
 especially three to four to five to seven, eight,

1:30:09.720 --> 1:30:11.720
 you're going to have to have some breathing strategy.

1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:16.100
 A very common one is probably every third breath.

1:30:16.100 --> 1:30:17.100
 I'm going to do like,

1:30:17.100 --> 1:30:17.940
 exhale on the third.

1:30:17.940 --> 1:30:20.420
 Reset, re-breathe, something like that.

1:30:20.420 --> 1:30:21.940
 If you feel like you need to breathe after every one,

1:30:21.940 --> 1:30:23.540
 that's okay, but it's going to get wasteful

1:30:23.540 --> 1:30:25.580
 because you have to take time in between reps

1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:26.420
 of sitting there.

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:29.620
 If it's a squat, that's different versus a deadlift.

1:30:29.620 --> 1:30:30.660
 If you're resting at the bottom.

1:30:30.660 --> 1:30:32.020
 So there is a little bit of game here.

1:30:32.020 --> 1:30:35.180
 So in general, though, is that 75,

1:30:35.180 --> 1:30:37.820
 75 kind of really thrown out, you threw out.

1:30:37.820 --> 1:30:42.140
 Breathe in, do the lowering, and exhale on the out.

1:30:42.140 --> 1:30:43.460
 If you have to.

1:30:43.460 --> 1:30:44.220
 Less reps,

1:30:44.220 --> 1:30:47.220
 don't worry about more reps than you need to come up with some sort of breathing

1:30:47.220 --> 1:30:48.060
 strategy.

1:30:48.060 --> 1:30:52.700
 How about breathing in between sets and maybe even after the workout?

1:30:52.700 --> 1:30:53.540
 Yeah.

1:30:53.540 --> 1:30:55.460
 This is something I think a lot of people overlook.

1:30:55.460 --> 1:30:56.300
 Like,

1:30:56.300 --> 1:31:02.300
 and because that it is the case that recovery has to do both with the specific

1:31:02.300 --> 1:31:05.340
 activation and to muscles and the nervous system,

1:31:05.340 --> 1:31:09.860
 but also the attacks on the nervous system can also take place between sets.

1:31:09.860 --> 1:31:11.940
 I mean, if you're really geared up between sets,

1:31:11.940 --> 1:31:14.300
 and then you've got adrenaline, you know,

1:31:14.300 --> 1:31:17.340
 as high in between sets or close to it as you are during your sets,

1:31:17.340 --> 1:31:20.860
 you can imagine that the recovery would take longer or at least that you're not

1:31:20.860 --> 1:31:24.300
 spending adrenaline in the most efficient way if there is such a thing.

1:31:24.300 --> 1:31:25.980
 Yeah, fair.

1:31:25.980 --> 1:31:31.260
 You're not going to see any athlete that I work with just breathe in between,

1:31:31.260 --> 1:31:33.780
 whether it's in between innings or in between rounds,

1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:35.660
 every single one of them is going to go back,

1:31:35.660 --> 1:31:36.500
 sit in the stool,

1:31:36.500 --> 1:31:38.780
 and they're going to immediately be into a breathing routine.

1:31:38.780 --> 1:31:40.380
 A very intense routine.

1:31:40.380 --> 1:31:42.740
 A very intentional one. They're a little bit different for every athlete,

1:31:42.740 --> 1:31:44.140
 depending on the sport.

1:31:44.140 --> 1:31:46.500
 Even PGA golfer,

1:31:46.500 --> 1:31:48.020
 there's going to be a,

1:31:48.020 --> 1:31:49.740
 we just hit our ball,

1:31:49.740 --> 1:31:50.580
 we're moving to the next one,

1:31:50.580 --> 1:31:52.060
 we're going to go into a breathing strategy.

1:31:52.060 --> 1:31:52.900
 Every one of them.

1:31:52.900 --> 1:31:58.860
 It's a huge area of potential benefit and consequence if you're just ignoring it.

1:31:58.860 --> 1:31:59.700
 In general,

1:31:59.700 --> 1:32:03.620
 we want to do any sort of calming breath we want to restore.

1:32:03.620 --> 1:32:06.860
 It depends on if the,

1:32:06.860 --> 1:32:07.980
 it depends on what we're combating.

1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:10.060
 Are we combating low oxygen or high stress?

1:32:10.060 --> 1:32:11.380
 Or high CO2?

1:32:11.380 --> 1:32:12.940
 So that strategy is going to be a little bit different.

1:32:12.940 --> 1:32:13.580
 But in general,

1:32:13.580 --> 1:32:16.540
 that is a huge time opportunity to get better.

1:32:16.540 --> 1:32:18.340
 In fact,

1:32:18.340 --> 1:32:21.100
 people can go back and listen to some of your earlier episodes where you talked

1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:23.660
 about what you have spoken about,

1:32:23.660 --> 1:32:24.100
 I think,

1:32:24.100 --> 1:32:26.020
 on this show.

1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:29.340
 When neuroplasticity works.

1:32:29.340 --> 1:32:33.060
 And if you're losing that opportunity post exercise,

1:32:33.060 --> 1:32:34.500
 you're leaving gains on the table,

1:32:34.500 --> 1:32:34.900
 if you will.

1:32:34.900 --> 1:32:38.260
 So not only are you going to see every of the athletes that I work with mostly have

1:32:38.260 --> 1:32:40.980
 a breathing strategy in competition,

1:32:40.980 --> 1:32:42.740
 we're not going to just finish a workout,

1:32:42.740 --> 1:32:43.260
 high five,

1:32:43.260 --> 1:32:44.940
 drink water and walk out of the gym.

1:32:44.940 --> 1:32:48.700
 There will be a down regulation strategy that is heavily involved with some sort of

1:32:48.700 --> 1:32:51.100
 light control as well as breath control.

1:32:51.100 --> 1:32:53.660
 The individual prescription on that,

1:32:53.660 --> 1:32:56.460
 there's a ton of variation with what you can do.

1:32:56.460 --> 1:32:59.260
 The easiest thing is do something that calms you down.

1:32:59.260 --> 1:33:03.780
 Most likely that's going to be moved towards as much nasal breathing as you can possibly do.

1:33:03.780 --> 1:33:09.540
 And a really easy rule of thumb is a double exhale length relative to inhale.

1:33:09.540 --> 1:33:12.740
 So if you need to take a like four second inhale,

1:33:12.740 --> 1:33:15.460
 double that time and breathe out for eight seconds.

1:33:15.460 --> 1:33:16.740
 A box breathing is fine.

1:33:16.740 --> 1:33:18.220
 So equal inhale,

1:33:18.220 --> 1:33:19.380
 equal hold,

1:33:19.380 --> 1:33:20.740
 equal exhale,

1:33:20.740 --> 1:33:21.300
 equal hold.

1:33:21.300 --> 1:33:23.700
 So four second inhale for second exhale,

1:33:23.700 --> 1:33:24.220
 hold,

1:33:24.220 --> 1:33:24.580
 et cetera,

1:33:24.580 --> 1:33:25.300
 et cetera.

1:33:25.300 --> 1:33:26.540
 A triangle is fine too.

1:33:26.540 --> 1:33:29.660
 There's a lot of ways you can get really complicated.

1:33:29.660 --> 1:33:31.380
 Like what Brian McKenzie will do and Rob,

1:33:31.380 --> 1:33:32.380
 those guys have,

1:33:32.380 --> 1:33:36.100
 you can get all kinds of systems for inhale, exhale control.

1:33:36.100 --> 1:33:36.820
 It can be optimized,

1:33:36.820 --> 1:33:39.660
 but some strategy of calm.

1:33:39.660 --> 1:33:45.340
 We're going to almost always put you on your back or close and then we're going to cover light.

1:33:45.340 --> 1:33:46.660
 We can do some,

1:33:46.660 --> 1:33:51.380
 like we've done actually a number of musical interventions as well,

1:33:51.380 --> 1:33:58.820
 but you can as just as simple as sit down in a locker room if you have to and just breathe for five minutes.

1:33:58.820 --> 1:34:01.500
 That alone is going to be productive.

1:34:01.500 --> 1:34:01.900
 That's great.

1:34:01.900 --> 1:34:03.660
 If you're breathing in the locker room for five minutes,

1:34:03.660 --> 1:34:07.460
 I suggest closing your eyes or you get some funny looks and if you'll still get funny looks,

1:34:07.460 --> 1:34:08.620
 but you won't see people looking at you.

1:34:08.620 --> 1:34:08.780
 Yeah,

1:34:08.780 --> 1:34:09.820
 exactly.

1:34:09.820 --> 1:34:10.580
 I love this.

1:34:10.580 --> 1:34:18.220
 And I started doing this because you and Brian McKenzie informed me about this and it completely changed the rate of recovery for me.

1:34:18.220 --> 1:34:20.100
 I realized that I was leaving workouts,

1:34:20.100 --> 1:34:22.340
 both endurance workouts and strength,

1:34:22.340 --> 1:34:23.820
 hypertrophy workouts,

1:34:23.820 --> 1:34:25.180
 feeling great,

1:34:25.180 --> 1:34:26.220
 but looking at my phone,

1:34:26.220 --> 1:34:28.180
 getting right into email and meetings,

1:34:28.180 --> 1:34:29.660
 not concentrating on my breathing.

1:34:29.660 --> 1:34:34.980
 And all I did was to introduce on your recommendation a five minute down regulation.

1:34:34.980 --> 1:34:38.460
 So exhale emphasized breathing of a bunch of different varieties,

1:34:38.460 --> 1:34:39.300
 physiological size,

1:34:39.300 --> 1:34:40.140
 box breathing,

1:34:40.140 --> 1:34:44.620
 exhale emphasized twice as long as the inhale component for five minutes.

1:34:44.620 --> 1:34:46.580
 And I noticed two things.

1:34:46.580 --> 1:34:47.220
 One,

1:34:47.220 --> 1:34:48.660
 I recovered more quickly,

1:34:48.660 --> 1:34:49.380
 workout to workout.

1:34:49.380 --> 1:34:50.460
 No question about it.

1:34:50.460 --> 1:34:50.900
 Yeah.

1:34:50.900 --> 1:34:52.980
 The numbers told me that.

1:34:52.980 --> 1:35:00.660
 And the other is that I used to have this dip in energy that would occur three or four hours after a hard workout.

1:35:00.660 --> 1:35:04.980
 And I always thought that had to do with the fact that I had generally eaten a meal at some point post workout.

1:35:04.980 --> 1:35:06.820
 Turns out it wasn't the meal at all.

1:35:06.820 --> 1:35:11.340
 It's that that that adrenaline ramp up during the workouts.

1:35:11.340 --> 1:35:13.700
 I wasn't clamping that at the end.

1:35:13.700 --> 1:35:15.780
 And so I think eventually it just crashed.

1:35:15.780 --> 1:35:17.140
 And then three or four hours later,

1:35:17.140 --> 1:35:21.300
 I'm having a hard time even reading what's on the screen of my computer thinking maybe it's the screen.

1:35:21.300 --> 1:35:22.220
 Maybe it was what I ate for lunch.

1:35:22.220 --> 1:35:29.020
 Turns out the down regulations allowed me to work through the afternoon with no issues whatsoever.

1:35:29.020 --> 1:35:29.220
 Yeah.

1:35:29.220 --> 1:35:30.700
 It's really been quite powerful.

1:35:30.700 --> 1:35:32.140
 And so I'm grateful to you for that.

1:35:32.140 --> 1:35:36.460
 I think this is something that I think 98 percent of people are not doing.

1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:37.660
 And it's only five minutes.

1:35:37.660 --> 1:35:39.100
 You don't even have to do five.

1:35:39.100 --> 1:35:40.420
 Give me three.

1:35:40.420 --> 1:35:41.740
 If you really have to push it,

1:35:41.740 --> 1:35:42.580
 give me three.

1:35:42.580 --> 1:35:44.500
 And you can even do this.

1:35:44.500 --> 1:35:45.500
 You can save time.

1:35:45.500 --> 1:35:47.340
 You can do this in the shower if you have to.

1:35:47.340 --> 1:35:48.380
 So you're you're done.

1:35:48.380 --> 1:35:49.660
 You're finished.

1:35:49.660 --> 1:35:50.260
 Drink of water,

1:35:50.260 --> 1:35:51.020
 whatever it has to be.

1:35:51.020 --> 1:35:52.020
 And you're getting in a shower.

1:35:52.020 --> 1:35:53.380
 You're getting ready.

1:35:53.380 --> 1:35:55.220
 Just give me three minutes in the shower.

1:35:55.220 --> 1:35:59.220
 It's not ideal, but as little as that, it can pay huge dividends.

1:35:59.220 --> 1:36:03.540
 You need some sort of internal signal that we're safe.

1:36:03.540 --> 1:36:05.660
 Like throttle down here.

1:36:05.660 --> 1:36:06.860
 We're going to move on.

1:36:06.860 --> 1:36:08.780
 That has to happen.

1:36:08.780 --> 1:36:11.540
 I could go on and on here, but I think we're making the same point kind of over again.

1:36:11.540 --> 1:36:12.740
 It's a big deal to do it.

1:36:12.740 --> 1:36:12.980
 Yeah.

1:36:12.980 --> 1:36:14.060
 And you're saving energy.

1:36:14.060 --> 1:36:17.020
 I mean, the energy here is neural energy.

1:36:17.020 --> 1:36:18.140
 I think fighters do this.

1:36:18.140 --> 1:36:20.100
 Good fighters learn to do this between rounds.

1:36:20.100 --> 1:36:20.380
 Yeah.

1:36:20.380 --> 1:36:22.860
 Sprinters learn to do this between events.

1:36:22.860 --> 1:36:27.980
 I think humans should learn how to do this between any, you know, sort of interval type

1:36:27.980 --> 1:36:30.260
 activity, including work, social engagement.

1:36:30.260 --> 1:36:32.660
 I mean, this is such a powerful tool.

1:36:32.660 --> 1:36:40.580
 Do this for one minute after every important, whether it's an individual high volatile interaction

1:36:40.580 --> 1:36:44.700
 or if it's a, you just did a nice 45 minute sprint to work and you're deep into it or

1:36:44.700 --> 1:36:45.700
 whatever, fine.

1:36:45.700 --> 1:36:46.700
 Just give me one minute.

1:36:46.700 --> 1:36:51.260
 Set your alarm just one minute and that also will pay dividends.

1:36:51.260 --> 1:36:52.260
 I love it.

1:36:52.260 --> 1:36:59.300
 And as I said, it's made a outsize, a different positive difference on my training, but also

1:36:59.300 --> 1:37:02.620
 activities outside my training, which is for me, I'm not a professional athlete.

1:37:02.620 --> 1:37:06.820
 I trained for health and because I enjoy it, but when a really hard workout starts to interfere

1:37:06.820 --> 1:37:10.380
 with the ability to do the other things in life, that's not a good situation.

1:37:10.380 --> 1:37:12.940
 So this is really terrific.

1:37:12.940 --> 1:37:17.120
 There's a lot more in each of those categories of strength and hypertrophy, but you've given

1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:20.420
 us a tremendous amount of valuable information there.

1:37:20.420 --> 1:37:27.180
 Maybe now would be a good time to shift to endurance and of the four types of endurance.

1:37:27.180 --> 1:37:29.480
 And maybe you could remind us what those are.

1:37:29.480 --> 1:37:34.240
 What do you think are the two that most people are seeking or pursuing in terms of health

1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:35.240
 and aesthetics, right?

1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:40.080
 I mean, I realize that we probably have athletes out there as well, but I think when I think

1:37:40.080 --> 1:37:45.100
 health and aesthetics, I think, okay, the ability to do sustained endurance, 30 plus

1:37:45.100 --> 1:37:50.520
 minutes of some ongoing activity, how does one maximize that work?

1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:52.400
 What are the modifiable variables?

1:37:52.400 --> 1:37:56.500
 And then maybe you could tell us what the other major category is that people ought

1:37:56.500 --> 1:37:58.660
 to have in their kit.

1:37:58.660 --> 1:37:59.860
 Okay.

1:37:59.860 --> 1:38:02.620
 So starting off with exercise choice.

1:38:02.620 --> 1:38:06.460
 One thing, as soon as we cross into the endurance world, and this is true for all four of those

1:38:06.460 --> 1:38:12.740
 categories, exercise choice needs to be very concerned with eccentric landing, right?

1:38:12.740 --> 1:38:17.980
 So you don't need to avoid it, but you need to recognize it relative or compare it against

1:38:17.980 --> 1:38:20.180
 those other strength and speed ones.

1:38:20.180 --> 1:38:21.880
 The volume is low on those ones.

1:38:21.880 --> 1:38:24.140
 So if you have some eccentric absorption, it's okay.

1:38:24.140 --> 1:38:27.840
 But as we sort of talked about five minutes ago, more eccentric means greater chance of

1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:29.700
 muscle damage, soreness.

1:38:29.700 --> 1:38:35.980
 So if you take something and magnify it across 30 minutes or even five minutes, but have

1:38:35.980 --> 1:38:40.180
 maximal exertion, you have a recipe for blowing up.

1:38:40.180 --> 1:38:44.460
 You can imagine I haven't run in forever and I've listened to this Huberman Lab podcast

1:38:44.460 --> 1:38:48.620
 and I'm, okay, I'm going to get into my zone two training, whatever, whatever.

1:38:48.620 --> 1:38:49.620
 And I start jogging.

1:38:49.620 --> 1:38:52.900
 I'm going to do, you know, I remember when I used to be able to do 25 and you just do

1:38:52.900 --> 1:38:54.700
 a 25 minute jog.

1:38:54.700 --> 1:38:57.860
 The amount of eccentric landing that just occurred on every single step, because you're

1:38:57.860 --> 1:39:02.500
 never with running, even slow running, you never have two feet on the ground at the same

1:39:02.500 --> 1:39:03.500
 time.

1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:08.820
 One foot land, one foot land, your entire body mass plus gravity onto one leg at a time,

1:39:08.820 --> 1:39:11.300
 repeated now hundreds of times.

1:39:11.300 --> 1:39:14.660
 That eccentric landing is going to cause tremendous soreness.

1:39:14.660 --> 1:39:19.380
 Your quads are going to go, you're probably going to get shin splints, which is what,

1:39:19.380 --> 1:39:24.100
 this isn't, those are entirely caused by eccentric landing and when the tissue is not ready to

1:39:24.100 --> 1:39:25.420
 tolerate that.

1:39:25.420 --> 1:39:29.000
 If you're not landing correctly, this is when knee pain happens, back pain, shoulder neck

1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:31.740
 pain because of movement compensation.

1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:35.440
 Anytime we start pressing to fatigue, let's be very concerned with there.

1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:41.800
 So my initial recommendation is start with activities exercise choice wise that are mostly

1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:43.160
 concentric based.

1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:44.540
 So think about a cycle.

1:39:44.540 --> 1:39:48.740
 So when you're riding on a bike, you're pushing the pedal, but you're never landing and absorbing

1:39:48.740 --> 1:39:49.740
 it.

1:39:49.740 --> 1:39:52.760
 So you could go out and do a 45 minute bike ride and you're not going to get that sore

1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:55.300
 because there's not a lot of eccentric load.

1:39:55.300 --> 1:39:57.800
 Swimming, similar thing here, right?

1:39:57.800 --> 1:40:01.580
 There's some eccentrics when your hand hits the water, but fairly minimal.

1:40:01.580 --> 1:40:04.940
 It's mostly a push, push, push, push, push, no load.

1:40:04.940 --> 1:40:08.940
 Rowing, similar thing, mostly concentric.

1:40:08.940 --> 1:40:11.560
 Pushing a sled is fantastic.

1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:16.180
 Going uphill, running, or even walking hard uphill, all good because they're very minimal

1:40:16.180 --> 1:40:21.640
 landing relative to like running downhill, which would be a very, very bad idea to start.

1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:27.840
 So when you, if you're first jumping into these things, progress your volume for endurance

1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:31.060
 very slowly if it involves eccentric landing.

1:40:31.060 --> 1:40:36.220
 A really bad strategy would be to jump in and do say circuit training class that involves

1:40:36.220 --> 1:40:38.380
 a bunch of box jumps, right?

1:40:38.380 --> 1:40:44.900
 This is not a good way to do your first foray into conditioning.

1:40:44.900 --> 1:40:48.060
 You're going to get incredibly sore because you're jumping and landing.

1:40:48.060 --> 1:40:53.420
 You're now looking at three to 10 X body weight in terms of absorption with a single land,

1:40:53.420 --> 1:40:55.000
 even if you're just jumping.

1:40:55.000 --> 1:41:01.000
 So be careful of that in any of those endurance areas of exercise choice.

1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:02.640
 So what to pick?

1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:05.420
 Pick the one that you are most technically proficient in because you're going to do it

1:41:05.420 --> 1:41:06.420
 a lot.

1:41:06.420 --> 1:41:08.940
 It's going to be a lot of repetitions, whatever one you feel the most joy in.

1:41:08.940 --> 1:41:09.940
 If that's rowing, great.

1:41:09.940 --> 1:41:13.220
 If that's pushing a sled, it doesn't really matter.

1:41:13.220 --> 1:41:14.740
 You can do this actually with weights.

1:41:14.740 --> 1:41:17.440
 This is our preferred way, by the way, with our athletes.

1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:22.940
 So we might do a 30 minute circuit where we do a five minute farmer's carry with a pretty

1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:23.940
 light weight.

1:41:23.940 --> 1:41:25.740
 So you're just going to carry some weights in your hand and you're just going to walk

1:41:25.740 --> 1:41:26.980
 up and down the street for five minutes.

1:41:26.980 --> 1:41:31.180
 You're going to set that down and then you're going to do say a three minute plank and then

1:41:31.180 --> 1:41:34.900
 you're going to pick that up and you're going to do body weight squats, like slowly and

1:41:34.900 --> 1:41:35.900
 just tempo.

1:41:35.900 --> 1:41:38.660
 And you're going to do a handful of different exercises so the athletes don't get super

1:41:38.660 --> 1:41:44.700
 bored or a very simple one, if a 30 minute workout, 10 minutes on a treadmill, 10 minutes

1:41:44.700 --> 1:41:46.740
 on a bike, 10 minutes on a rower.

1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:49.820
 For those of you that are like, oh my God, I can't do 30 straight minutes of running.

1:41:49.820 --> 1:41:50.820
 Cool.

1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:53.660
 Break it up into three or four different exercises that are all fairly safe.

1:41:53.660 --> 1:41:57.960
 So that's how I would do that long duration piece for exercise choice.

1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:01.540
 And then in terms of heart rate during that period, I mean, how much tension should we

1:42:01.540 --> 1:42:02.540
 pay to this?

1:42:02.540 --> 1:42:06.900
 The kind of very broad prescriptive I've thrown out on this podcast a few times based on my

1:42:06.900 --> 1:42:10.600
 read of the literature is for most people that are oriented toward health, including

1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:15.780
 people that are working on size and strength gains, hypertrophy and strength, of course,

1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:22.420
 that getting 150 to 180 minutes of so-called zone two cardio, you know, can just barely

1:42:22.420 --> 1:42:25.300
 have a conversation, but if one were to push any harder, you wouldn't be able to.

1:42:25.300 --> 1:42:26.300
 That kind of thing.

1:42:26.300 --> 1:42:31.940
 It's just a, as a sort of a generic recommendation that almost everybody should follow in order

1:42:31.940 --> 1:42:34.360
 to just keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

1:42:34.360 --> 1:42:39.020
 But I know there's a lot of nuance there and some people would like to be able to run continuously

1:42:39.020 --> 1:42:40.740
 for an hour at speed, right?

1:42:40.740 --> 1:42:47.260
 Um, obviously not sprinting, but what are some of the, um, finer, finer points on long

1:42:47.260 --> 1:42:50.500
 distance endurance and how often should one do it?

1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:51.500
 Okay.

1:42:51.500 --> 1:42:53.200
 Um, obviously you could do it as daily, right?

1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:54.700
 Even when strength, doing strength and hypertrophy.

1:42:54.700 --> 1:42:55.700
 No question.

1:42:55.700 --> 1:42:57.680
 Well, that I think is an important point for people to hear it because a lot of people

1:42:57.680 --> 1:43:01.900
 think that they are going to greatly diminish their strength and hypertrophy gains as it's

1:43:01.900 --> 1:43:06.880
 often called, um, by doing in zone two cardio.

1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:11.180
 Zone two, you have almost no ability to block your hypertrophy.

1:43:11.180 --> 1:43:15.060
 Zone two truly, if it's within that category, if you're talking about conversational pace,

1:43:15.060 --> 1:43:19.900
 um, there is very, in fact, there's strong reason to think that is not going to influence

1:43:19.900 --> 1:43:22.900
 hypertrophy for the overwhelming majority of people.

1:43:22.900 --> 1:43:28.040
 It might even help it by increasing blood flow to the various, um, does it matter?

1:43:28.040 --> 1:43:30.740
 Let's say someone's doing primarily strength and hypertrophy.

1:43:30.740 --> 1:43:35.180
 Their primary goals are strength and hypertrophy, and then they're going to do, they're going

1:43:35.180 --> 1:43:38.740
 to hit that 150 to 180 minutes of zone two cardio per week, assuming they're breaking

1:43:38.740 --> 1:43:40.460
 that up into three or four sessions.

1:43:40.460 --> 1:43:44.180
 Does it matter if they do it in the same workout before or after?

1:43:44.180 --> 1:43:45.180
 Does that matter?

1:43:45.180 --> 1:43:50.500
 Um, I tend to do just by way of example for people, certainly I'm just one, uh, one example.

1:43:50.500 --> 1:43:53.420
 I tend to do, uh, resistance training one day.

1:43:53.420 --> 1:43:56.980
 Then I'll do zone two cardio and the next day I jog cause that's the thing I prefer.

1:43:56.980 --> 1:44:01.500
 Then I'll do strength hypertrophy training on the next day and then jog for my zone two

1:44:01.500 --> 1:44:02.500
 cardio.

1:44:02.500 --> 1:44:04.100
 And then I take one full day off a week.

1:44:04.100 --> 1:44:07.980
 I've never actually done the zone two cardio on the same day, but were I to do it on the

1:44:07.980 --> 1:44:09.720
 same day?

1:44:09.720 --> 1:44:13.180
 Would it matter if I did it before or after my, my strength hypertrophy training?

1:44:13.180 --> 1:44:14.180
 Not really.

1:44:14.180 --> 1:44:15.260
 You're going to be just fine.

1:44:15.260 --> 1:44:16.260
 Interference effects.

1:44:16.260 --> 1:44:18.380
 The interference effect is what this is called.

1:44:18.380 --> 1:44:22.740
 So this is all the way back to 1980, uh, Bob Hickman stuff, right?

1:44:22.740 --> 1:44:28.340
 And he was actually working in a lab with John Halazi, who's one of the fathers of exercise

1:44:28.340 --> 1:44:33.100
 biochemistry and the sort of the story goes that, uh, Hickman came in, he was a strength

1:44:33.100 --> 1:44:37.660
 training guy and Halazi and almost all those initial exercise physiologists were conditioning

1:44:37.660 --> 1:44:38.660
 folks, right?

1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:43.220
 So it's almost always swimmers and runners and that's why a bulk of the exercise physiology

1:44:43.220 --> 1:44:45.620
 historically is, is shaped in that direction.

1:44:45.620 --> 1:44:47.740
 That's what those scientists were interested in.

1:44:47.740 --> 1:44:52.660
 So Hickman was there in the lab and then the, how much of this is myth or not, who really

1:44:52.660 --> 1:44:53.660
 knows?

1:44:53.660 --> 1:44:58.100
 But so the story goes, um, that this is sort of chipping back and forth and you know how

1:44:58.100 --> 1:45:03.260
 from a PI to a postdoc and kind of that razzing works a little bit and eventually he was like,

1:45:03.260 --> 1:45:05.980
 you got to start running with us and he was like, you got to start lifting with me and

1:45:05.980 --> 1:45:06.980
 kind of goes back and forth.

1:45:06.980 --> 1:45:08.600
 Well, you know who wins in that equation.

1:45:08.600 --> 1:45:10.020
 It's not the postdoc, right?

1:45:10.020 --> 1:45:13.100
 So it's the PI gets in and says, Hickman says, okay, fine.

1:45:13.100 --> 1:45:17.100
 So he starts running with Halazi and then eventually starts to realize I'm getting weak.

1:45:17.100 --> 1:45:20.700
 I'm losing strength and I just can't, I think it was his bench press specifically was going

1:45:20.700 --> 1:45:21.700
 down or maybe a squat.

1:45:21.700 --> 1:45:22.700
 I can't remember.

1:45:22.700 --> 1:45:28.020
 Who knows if it's even real, but point is, so he's going along and so eventually starts

1:45:28.020 --> 1:45:31.340
 to create a little bit of animosity and it's like, actually I don't think it's good for

1:45:31.340 --> 1:45:32.340
 me and then blah, blah, blah.

1:45:32.340 --> 1:45:36.620
 And so they did what any good scientists would do and said, well, let's find out.

1:45:36.620 --> 1:45:37.620
 Right?

1:45:37.620 --> 1:45:41.940
 And so they, he run a really famous experiment where he took a group, three groups.

1:45:41.940 --> 1:45:44.380
 One group did a endurance piece, right?

1:45:44.380 --> 1:45:45.540
 The steady state cardio.

1:45:45.540 --> 1:45:49.140
 One group did a strength training piece and then the third group did both of those workouts

1:45:49.140 --> 1:45:50.140
 combined.

1:45:50.140 --> 1:45:51.140
 Not like a reduction.

1:45:51.140 --> 1:45:56.420
 So both volumes stacked on top of each other and the results are fairly predictable in

1:45:56.420 --> 1:46:01.520
 terms of the endurance group only had the greatest increases in VO2 max and endurance

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:02.520
 markers.

1:46:02.520 --> 1:46:05.940
 The strength training group had the greatest increases in muscle hypertrophy.

1:46:05.940 --> 1:46:09.860
 But where the interesting part was and where this whole field started was the combined

1:46:09.860 --> 1:46:10.860
 group.

1:46:10.860 --> 1:46:12.420
 So concurrent training is what it's generally called.

1:46:12.420 --> 1:46:16.700
 So you're doing concurrent things and typically that means hypertrophy and strength stacked

1:46:16.700 --> 1:46:22.040
 on top of some in steady state endurance in the same, same, same workout, two hour block

1:46:22.040 --> 1:46:23.460
 or same like week.

1:46:23.460 --> 1:46:26.820
 It doesn't really make it can be kind of all these.

1:46:26.820 --> 1:46:35.300
 Well, the concurrent group saw the same improvements in VO2 max as the endurance group.

1:46:35.300 --> 1:46:36.300
 And he's like, well, okay.

1:46:36.300 --> 1:46:39.820
 So the strength training did not compromise the endurance adaptations.

1:46:39.820 --> 1:46:45.060
 However, they saw much lower increases in strength and hypertrophy.

1:46:45.060 --> 1:46:52.620
 And so it was the conclusion was the addition of endurance work compromised muscle growth

1:46:52.620 --> 1:46:53.620
 and strength development.

1:46:53.620 --> 1:46:57.280
 However, the addition of strength training to your endurance work will not compromise

1:46:57.280 --> 1:46:59.100
 your endurance gains.

1:46:59.100 --> 1:47:02.680
 Now that second piece has been shown countless more times, right?

1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:07.140
 So if you're an endurance athlete, adding strength training is almost always going to

1:47:07.140 --> 1:47:09.020
 be massively beneficial.

1:47:09.020 --> 1:47:12.880
 Very little chance of detriment is why every endurance athlete is going to have some sort

1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:15.640
 of strength and power component to their training.

1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:18.020
 The controversy though, came in the interference effects.

1:47:18.020 --> 1:47:21.680
 So how much endurance training really blocks muscular development.

1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:26.460
 And for years, myself included, was we preached hard, you know, don't, don't do these two

1:47:26.460 --> 1:47:29.060
 things at the same time.

1:47:29.060 --> 1:47:32.720
 My friend, my colleague, Kevin Murek has a really nice review article, Jimmy Bagley.

1:47:32.720 --> 1:47:33.720
 Those two guys put this thing out.

1:47:33.720 --> 1:47:37.420
 You can go read that where they cover all these things and they've got some nice figures

1:47:37.420 --> 1:47:38.420
 in there.

1:47:38.420 --> 1:47:43.400
 And the general answer here is interference effect is sort of real, but it's probably

1:47:43.400 --> 1:47:45.400
 greatly overblown.

1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:46.400
 It matters.

1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:49.820
 So are you talking about a 20 minute jog at conversation pace?

1:47:49.820 --> 1:47:54.780
 That's probably doing very little with the assumption that are you doing an eccentric

1:47:54.780 --> 1:47:56.020
 based exercise like running?

1:47:56.020 --> 1:47:59.320
 Well, then you're going to have more of an interference effect than cycling.

1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:02.600
 That makes a ton of sense if you think about it, right?

1:48:02.600 --> 1:48:04.400
 What's your total energy intake.

1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:07.580
 If you're eating sufficient calories, you can still be in an anabolic state.

1:48:07.580 --> 1:48:13.660
 If the addition of extra energy expenditure, that's all it really is, mark the cardio,

1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:17.300
 put you in a negative energy state, it's been, it's going to become very difficult to go

1:48:17.300 --> 1:48:18.900
 through anabolism.

1:48:18.900 --> 1:48:20.820
 So those things matter.

1:48:20.820 --> 1:48:25.820
 If you're talking about doing like running a few laps around the track as a warmup, like

1:48:25.820 --> 1:48:27.180
 that's not interference effect.

1:48:27.180 --> 1:48:31.580
 What we're really talking about is a big volume performed consistently.

1:48:31.580 --> 1:48:35.580
 Now after Hickman came out with this pater paper in 1980, people followed it up in the

1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:38.380
 90s and 2000s with mechanism.

1:48:38.380 --> 1:48:43.180
 And we started to look and see, we started to see, hey, there's this cell signaling pathway

1:48:43.180 --> 1:48:47.140
 that goes down called mTOR and that's what leads to muscle growth.

1:48:47.140 --> 1:48:50.680
 And then on the other side of that equation, there's a thing called AMPK, which is more

1:48:50.680 --> 1:48:54.520
 associated with mitochondrial biogenesis and endurance.

1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:59.220
 And there's this little molecule in between at the time, most people would point to TSC2.

1:48:59.220 --> 1:49:03.560
 Well, turns out AMPK activation is fine.

1:49:03.560 --> 1:49:09.220
 If you activate mTOR, there's no bearing on AMPK, but if you activate AMPK, it's going

1:49:09.220 --> 1:49:11.900
 to activate TSC2, which inhibited mTOR.

1:49:11.900 --> 1:49:17.860
 And so it was like we had practical outcome, i.e. Hickman, you're going to get weaker.

1:49:17.860 --> 1:49:18.860
 Now we had mechanism.

1:49:18.860 --> 1:49:22.780
 So that story became very, very strong that this interference effect, and this is how

1:49:22.780 --> 1:49:23.780
 science should work, right?

1:49:23.780 --> 1:49:27.260
 When you see mechanism match up with practical human outcome, it's a strong thing.

1:49:27.260 --> 1:49:28.260
 That's what you want.

1:49:28.260 --> 1:49:29.260
 Yep.

1:49:29.260 --> 1:49:31.060
 It was still wrong though.

1:49:31.060 --> 1:49:32.060
 It just took more science, right?

1:49:32.060 --> 1:49:35.460
 And this is why we always have to give science a bit of time.

1:49:35.460 --> 1:49:38.980
 And you have to be willing to follow, right?

1:49:38.980 --> 1:49:44.020
 And again, even me in the field who has a practitioner background in science, I felt

1:49:44.020 --> 1:49:46.740
 very strongly, this is a big problem.

1:49:46.740 --> 1:49:48.340
 It just didn't turn out to be the case.

1:49:48.340 --> 1:49:52.620
 Enough studies came out where I'm like, okay, it's probably not that big a deal.

1:49:52.620 --> 1:49:57.860
 Unless the movement is heavily eccentric based, the volume is very high, you're trying to

1:49:57.860 --> 1:50:02.340
 maximize muscle growth and energy is not controlled.

1:50:02.340 --> 1:50:07.620
 If that's not all the case, interference effect is probably not something most people should

1:50:07.620 --> 1:50:08.620
 worry about.

1:50:08.620 --> 1:50:14.420
 Especially when you compare that against the well-roundedness that you need for total physiological

1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:15.420
 health.

1:50:15.420 --> 1:50:17.780
 Probably not a big deal.

1:50:17.780 --> 1:50:22.900
 Very reassuring for me to hear because I do enjoy lifting weights and I really enjoy running

1:50:22.900 --> 1:50:24.460
 and I love running outside.

1:50:24.460 --> 1:50:28.820
 I believe I used to experience the interference effect when I used to do a very long run on

1:50:28.820 --> 1:50:29.820
 Sundays.

1:50:29.820 --> 1:50:32.900
 I would just go out for two hours or something like that.

1:50:32.900 --> 1:50:35.300
 I don't know that I ate enough or who knows.

1:50:35.300 --> 1:50:37.340
 I always feel like I eat enough or more.

1:50:37.340 --> 1:50:39.200
 I love to eat.

1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:47.820
 But that long Sunday run always made it hard for me to make progressive gains in strength

1:50:47.820 --> 1:50:49.340
 and hypertrophy in the gym.

1:50:49.340 --> 1:50:54.660
 Whereas when I cut that to 30 minutes, three or four times a week, I don't see any interference

1:50:54.660 --> 1:50:55.660
 effect at all.

1:50:55.660 --> 1:50:56.660
 Probably very real.

1:50:56.660 --> 1:51:01.060
 And I haven't trained specifically for endurance in a very long time, so I haven't experienced

1:51:01.060 --> 1:51:06.100
 the non-interference effect, which as you said before, most, if not all endurance athletes

1:51:06.100 --> 1:51:09.780
 probably are or at least should be doing some sort of strength work just to keep the undercarriage

1:51:09.780 --> 1:51:10.780
 strong as I think.

1:51:10.780 --> 1:51:14.300
 Yeah, there's a bunch of reasons.

1:51:14.300 --> 1:51:19.580
 So what are some protocols that people could explore for continuous endurance training?

1:51:19.580 --> 1:51:24.380
 I mean, I've thrown out this 150 to 180 minute zone two cardio, but that's really the kind

1:51:24.380 --> 1:51:26.820
 of kindergarten of endurance.

1:51:26.820 --> 1:51:27.820
 And there I'm probably being generous.

1:51:27.820 --> 1:51:31.460
 It's probably the nursery school of endurance that everyone should do.

1:51:31.460 --> 1:51:35.460
 What sorts of other protocols, I realize that can be very goal-directed, but is it unreasonable

1:51:35.460 --> 1:51:42.460
 for instance, for somebody to do four hours of continuous endurance training with intervals

1:51:42.460 --> 1:51:47.740
 in there as well to get it kind of all around heart health and the ability to go long distances?

1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:48.740
 Yeah.

1:51:48.740 --> 1:51:49.740
 I'll answer this too.

1:51:49.740 --> 1:51:54.700
 Is the very first one to tackle the long duration endurance is how I ever heard of it.

1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.480
 You asked really about heart rate zones.

1:51:56.480 --> 1:51:59.040
 To me, that's almost totally irrelevant.

1:51:59.040 --> 1:52:00.040
 It doesn't matter, right?

1:52:00.040 --> 1:52:01.540
 If you're moving, you're moving.

1:52:01.540 --> 1:52:04.280
 That's the functional piece here.

1:52:04.280 --> 1:52:09.260
 If you want to push it and go at a non-conversational pace, that has tremendous health benefits.

1:52:09.260 --> 1:52:11.840
 If you want to do it a little bit slower, fine.

1:52:11.840 --> 1:52:14.580
 If you're at the pace where you can have a conversation, to me, I don't even count that

1:52:14.580 --> 1:52:15.880
 as exercise.

1:52:15.880 --> 1:52:18.560
 That's not a pejorative, by the way.

1:52:18.560 --> 1:52:22.340
 That is just general physical movement and it is extraordinarily clear.

1:52:22.340 --> 1:52:23.960
 You need a lot of that.

1:52:23.960 --> 1:52:26.420
 You need a lot more of that than we get.

1:52:26.420 --> 1:52:28.780
 You can do this in a couple of efficient ways.

1:52:28.780 --> 1:52:30.980
 Just taking your phone calls moving.

1:52:30.980 --> 1:52:34.260
 If you've got a 30 minute call every day or most days of the week and you can do that

1:52:34.260 --> 1:52:38.620
 while moving, you've checked not that whole box, but a pretty good chunk of it.

1:52:38.620 --> 1:52:42.020
 And that could even be done inside, pacing back and forth.

1:52:42.020 --> 1:52:43.020
 I'm a big pacer.

1:52:43.020 --> 1:52:44.020
 Yeah, me too.

1:52:44.020 --> 1:52:47.900
 Like you probably saw me, like I'm going to walk up and down all over the place.

1:52:47.900 --> 1:52:52.660
 Most of the time when I'm in my office working, I'm shadowboxing, like I'm doing air squats.

1:52:52.660 --> 1:52:53.660
 Not even intentionally.

1:52:53.660 --> 1:52:54.660
 I'm just like...

1:52:54.660 --> 1:52:55.780
 Do you have one of those treadmills under the dust?

1:52:55.780 --> 1:52:59.200
 I don't, but like every lab I ever came through, somebody did.

1:52:59.200 --> 1:53:03.180
 We did an episode on workspace optimization and the data on those treadmills are pretty

1:53:03.180 --> 1:53:04.180
 interesting.

1:53:04.180 --> 1:53:08.160
 They definitely increase alertness, which for obvious reasons, even a little bit of

1:53:08.160 --> 1:53:12.740
 movement is going to generate a little bit of adrenaline.

1:53:12.740 --> 1:53:17.080
 So pacing around, moving, taking calls, moving, getting walks when you can.

1:53:17.080 --> 1:53:20.820
 And then in terms of building endurance, let's say somebody wants to quote unquote get into

1:53:20.820 --> 1:53:22.700
 better shape.

1:53:22.700 --> 1:53:27.380
 They already may or may not already have some size and strength that they're happy with

1:53:27.380 --> 1:53:28.380
 and they just want to get in.

1:53:28.380 --> 1:53:29.780
 They want to improve their health.

1:53:29.780 --> 1:53:34.900
 So when does that 150, 180 minute thing tick over into a different protocol?

1:53:34.900 --> 1:53:35.900
 Yeah.

1:53:35.900 --> 1:53:42.260
 I think the way that I can outline a weekly schedule, just as a conceptual model here,

1:53:42.260 --> 1:53:45.140
 that long duration stuff is not even counting, as I mentioned, right?

1:53:45.140 --> 1:53:47.780
 It's just a, this is what you need to do as a human moving forward.

1:53:47.780 --> 1:53:49.220
 We haven't improved.

1:53:49.220 --> 1:53:53.100
 If you're extremely unfit, you may see some changes in cardiovascular health there, but

1:53:53.100 --> 1:53:56.020
 for the most part, this is just knocking out the general physical practice.

1:53:56.020 --> 1:53:57.980
 You need to be higher functioning.

1:53:57.980 --> 1:54:00.780
 So whatever that time domain is, I don't really care.

1:54:00.780 --> 1:54:02.980
 It's not a huge concern of mine.

1:54:02.980 --> 1:54:04.820
 What I think you need to hit are these nodes.

1:54:04.820 --> 1:54:08.780
 You need to do something once a week that gets you to a maximum heart rate.

1:54:08.780 --> 1:54:11.140
 Now I don't have to literally mean max, but close.

1:54:11.140 --> 1:54:13.940
 So this means really sucking for air?

1:54:13.940 --> 1:54:14.940
 Really.

1:54:14.940 --> 1:54:16.160
 Like as high as you can possibly get.

1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:20.180
 You can wear a heart rate monitor if you want, but maximum heart rate, the rough equation

1:54:20.180 --> 1:54:22.560
 we say is 220 minus your age.

1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:28.000
 So if you're 40 years old, your maximum heart rate is probably about 180 beats per minute.

1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:33.940
 Now I can tell you flat out right now, my max heart rate is close to 210, which means

1:54:33.940 --> 1:54:36.300
 I'm 10 years old.

1:54:36.300 --> 1:54:38.020
 So take that number with a grain of salt.

1:54:38.020 --> 1:54:42.340
 I have had a bunch of professional athletes who are in their twenties and their max heart

1:54:42.340 --> 1:54:45.620
 rate is 175 and they are in way better shape than I am.

1:54:45.620 --> 1:54:49.040
 So maximum heart rate is not a good proxy for physical fitness.

1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:50.040
 It's a rough number.

1:54:50.040 --> 1:54:53.320
 An easy way to do it is if you have a heart rate monitor or anything like that, do the

1:54:53.320 --> 1:54:55.900
 hardest workout you can possibly do.

1:54:55.900 --> 1:54:58.940
 See what the highest number you get as and assume that's close.

1:54:58.940 --> 1:55:02.060
 If you want to just start at 220 minus your age, that's fine too.

1:55:02.060 --> 1:55:05.340
 Do something though where you're like, yep, this is death.

1:55:05.340 --> 1:55:07.140
 Like this is really, really challenging.

1:55:07.140 --> 1:55:08.500
 For how long?

1:55:08.500 --> 1:55:09.700
 However long that takes you.

1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:13.260
 That can be a 30 second go on an aerodyne or an air assault bike.

1:55:13.260 --> 1:55:20.820
 That could be a, do one of those things where you kind of like sprint, run as hard as you

1:55:20.820 --> 1:55:23.100
 can during the straightaway on a track and then walk the corners.

1:55:23.100 --> 1:55:26.740
 Kind of an old classic back when you and I were kids, interval training.

1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:27.860
 They don't do that anymore?

1:55:27.860 --> 1:55:28.860
 I guess.

1:55:28.860 --> 1:55:29.860
 I don't know.

1:55:29.860 --> 1:55:30.860
 I don't even talk about it.

1:55:30.860 --> 1:55:33.740
 It's a big change and if you didn't bring running shoes, you had to do it barefoot.

1:55:33.740 --> 1:55:34.740
 Oh, I love it.

1:55:34.740 --> 1:55:36.140
 And I love your teacher.

1:55:36.140 --> 1:55:37.140
 Yeah.

1:55:37.140 --> 1:55:41.980
 It wasn't a, our football, basketball, baseball teams weren't that good, but anything like

1:55:41.980 --> 1:55:46.180
 running cross country just because of where I grew up, brutal, brutal coaches.

1:55:46.180 --> 1:55:49.060
 So that yeah, they'd make the all kids do these runs.

1:55:49.060 --> 1:55:50.060
 Yep.

1:55:50.060 --> 1:55:53.780
 So it can be in the 30 probably seconds at a minimum.

1:55:53.780 --> 1:55:57.640
 It's hard to get you to a true heart rate max in shorter than 30 seconds.

1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:02.780
 You can get the total suck in under 20 seconds, but getting to a true heart rate max is probably

1:56:02.780 --> 1:56:04.180
 going to take more than 30 seconds.

1:56:04.180 --> 1:56:07.060
 So it doesn't really matter what you want to do.

1:56:07.060 --> 1:56:09.700
 It can be again, a sprint uphill.

1:56:09.700 --> 1:56:13.340
 It could be, well, you're talking, it could be burpees to death, you know, like whatever,

1:56:13.340 --> 1:56:14.340
 whatever you want to do.

1:56:14.340 --> 1:56:15.820
 Those have an eccentric component, right?

1:56:15.820 --> 1:56:16.820
 Yeah, they do.

1:56:16.820 --> 1:56:17.820
 Yeah.

1:56:17.820 --> 1:56:19.100
 No question about it.

1:56:19.100 --> 1:56:20.100
 But if you did...

1:56:20.100 --> 1:56:22.640
 Not to actual death, by the way.

1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:26.560
 If you just did, I'm going to do as many burpees as I can for 90 seconds, it probably won't

1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:28.580
 take you much longer than that to get to close to max.

1:56:28.580 --> 1:56:30.020
 And is that the whole workout?

1:56:30.020 --> 1:56:31.020
 Could be.

1:56:31.020 --> 1:56:33.060
 So once a week, get to max heart rate.

1:56:33.060 --> 1:56:34.060
 Touch it.

1:56:34.060 --> 1:56:35.060
 I love it.

1:56:35.060 --> 1:56:36.060
 Touch it.

1:56:36.060 --> 1:56:37.700
 It's not the best, but it'll, it'll work.

1:56:37.700 --> 1:56:40.300
 And what are the specific benefits that that provides?

1:56:40.300 --> 1:56:41.300
 Okay.

1:56:41.300 --> 1:56:47.180
 So earlier in our, in our chat, we were, we outlined the rule of specificity, specific

1:56:47.180 --> 1:56:49.460
 adaptation to impose demand.

1:56:49.460 --> 1:56:53.340
 If you're never getting to that high of a pace, you're never, it would be like trying

1:56:53.340 --> 1:56:56.000
 to get stronger, but only going to 60%.

1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:59.900
 So every cardiovascular adaptation that occurs with cardiovascular training is just simply

1:56:59.900 --> 1:57:01.760
 going to get to the topper end by doing this.

1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:05.420
 So if you just start at the heart itself, stroke volume increases, this is the amount

1:57:05.420 --> 1:57:11.540
 of blood that's kicked out per contraction, cardiac output, resting heart rate.

1:57:11.540 --> 1:57:15.300
 If you go to the endothelial function, you're talking about nitric oxide release, endothelial

1:57:15.300 --> 1:57:21.700
 health in general, capillary, mitochondria, all the way down, like you just walk through

1:57:21.700 --> 1:57:24.460
 the whole system, pulmonary exchange to the lungs.

1:57:24.460 --> 1:57:27.860
 All of those are going to benefit by being challenged to their maximum.

1:57:27.860 --> 1:57:30.020
 They also teach you where your vomit reflex is.

1:57:30.020 --> 1:57:31.020
 Yeah, there you go.

1:57:31.020 --> 1:57:32.020
 All right.

1:57:32.020 --> 1:57:33.020
 Let's hope not.

1:57:33.020 --> 1:57:34.220
 Stress is what causes adaptation, right?

1:57:34.220 --> 1:57:36.780
 So if you push your, okay, here's the difference.

1:57:36.780 --> 1:57:41.600
 If you did 25 minutes of steady state, you're not challenging the same thing as what we

1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:43.140
 just talked about.

1:57:43.140 --> 1:57:48.420
 The way that I explained this is if you understand the point, the point of physiological failure,

1:57:48.420 --> 1:57:51.140
 then you understand the place of adaptation.

1:57:51.140 --> 1:57:52.140
 That's it.

1:57:52.140 --> 1:57:55.620
 So if you and I both go run on a, we did a both did a VO2 max test.

1:57:55.620 --> 1:57:59.580
 So a classic VO2 max test is going to take 8 to 12 minutes and it's going to look something

1:57:59.580 --> 1:58:00.580
 like this.

1:58:00.580 --> 1:58:03.660
 We're going to get in a treadmill and we're going to run.

1:58:03.660 --> 1:58:07.180
 And every minute I'm going to just slightly increase that treadmill, either the speed

1:58:07.180 --> 1:58:08.180
 or the grade.

1:58:08.180 --> 1:58:09.420
 Most of the time it's the speed, right?

1:58:09.420 --> 1:58:12.580
 So we get to a high grade, say 10% grade or something.

1:58:12.580 --> 1:58:21.820
 And then we go five miles per hour, 5.2, 5.4, and we just go until you can't go any longer.

1:58:21.820 --> 1:58:24.900
 Now let's say you and I did that and we had the same exact timeframe.

1:58:24.900 --> 1:58:26.820
 And so we both went eight minutes.

1:58:26.820 --> 1:58:29.420
 The time that you last is not the thing that we care about, right?

1:58:29.420 --> 1:58:32.700
 It's the volume of oxygen that you breathe out is what determines it.

1:58:32.700 --> 1:58:35.420
 So let's say we went with the same time domain and we had the same VO2 max.

1:58:35.420 --> 1:58:40.260
 Let's say they were both 50 milliliters per kilogram per minute, which is like a okay

1:58:40.260 --> 1:58:44.940
 number but that's nothing to be extremely proud about.

1:58:44.940 --> 1:58:48.020
 Just because we have the same number does not mean we have the same point of physiological

1:58:48.020 --> 1:58:49.020
 failure.

1:58:49.020 --> 1:58:53.580
 And this matters because it's going to answer the what do I do about it then question, right?

1:58:53.580 --> 1:58:58.220
 So if you got off and I started asking you a series of questions and you're like, I basically

1:58:58.220 --> 1:58:59.220
 said, why'd you quit?

1:58:59.220 --> 1:59:00.820
 You know, why did you jump off the treadmill?

1:59:00.820 --> 1:59:01.820
 Why'd you stop?

1:59:01.820 --> 1:59:04.700
 And you were like, my chest, like I couldn't catch my breath.

1:59:04.700 --> 1:59:07.180
 I thought my heart was going to explode.

1:59:07.180 --> 1:59:08.440
 Okay, great.

1:59:08.440 --> 1:59:13.060
 If you asked me and I said, my legs were on fire, like I was breathing hard, but I couldn't

1:59:13.060 --> 1:59:15.500
 take another step.

1:59:15.500 --> 1:59:19.940
 This is a very rough indicator of different places of physiological disruption.

1:59:19.940 --> 1:59:24.940
 Now what I've seen a lot with my professional athletes, especially like fighters, they're

1:59:24.940 --> 1:59:28.500
 going to generally fail in their legs because they don't often do a lot of strength training

1:59:28.500 --> 1:59:29.500
 in their legs.

1:59:29.500 --> 1:59:30.500
 They don't do a lot of leg work.

1:59:30.500 --> 1:59:34.660
 They're fighting on their back, literally a lot or on top or on their knees.

1:59:34.660 --> 1:59:37.960
 So their legs tend to give out before they're.

1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:42.060
 Someone who fails in the cardiovascular system, like say you did a lot of leg training, typically

1:59:42.060 --> 1:59:45.040
 like an endurance athlete, that's not going to be their issue.

1:59:45.040 --> 1:59:48.160
 This is going to be, they're going to reach a heart rate and ventilation threshold that's

1:59:48.160 --> 1:59:50.900
 they can no longer handle.

1:59:50.900 --> 1:59:55.420
 If I put you on the exact same training protocols, it's not going to be as effective because

1:59:55.420 --> 1:59:59.660
 you're going to always fail at your legs and they're going to always fail at their cardiovascular

1:59:59.660 --> 2:00:00.660
 system.

2:00:00.660 --> 2:00:01.660
 I need to flip that, right?

2:00:01.660 --> 2:00:06.540
 You need to put you in a position to where you can reach a true heart rate or ventilation

2:00:06.540 --> 2:00:11.500
 challenge while your legs are still hanging in there or the opposite.

2:00:11.500 --> 2:00:16.200
 So the training protocol is based on that point of failure.

2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:17.860
 The adaptation is in the same thing.

2:00:17.860 --> 2:00:24.020
 So if you are failing because of your legs, then you might see a greater increase in capitalization

2:00:24.020 --> 2:00:25.020
 in your legs.

2:00:25.020 --> 2:00:29.140
 Relative to somebody else who's failing in their cardiovascular system, they may see

2:00:29.140 --> 2:00:32.040
 a greater change in something on that side of the equation.

2:00:32.040 --> 2:00:35.620
 So that it matters how you're failing at all times.

2:00:35.620 --> 2:00:40.260
 What I love about this is that it's, it's sounds like it's like a thermometer for where

2:00:40.260 --> 2:00:44.920
 one is weak and needs work, but also provides a stimulus to improve the very thing that

2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:45.920
 you need.

2:00:45.920 --> 2:00:47.160
 That's the trick.

2:00:47.160 --> 2:00:55.320
 So to just get real brass tacks about it, it would be once a week, 90 seconds near maximum

2:00:55.320 --> 2:00:56.320
 heart rate.

2:00:56.320 --> 2:00:57.320
 Could I do more?

2:00:57.320 --> 2:01:00.780
 Could I, you know, could I do five or six of those 90 second bouts?

2:01:00.780 --> 2:01:01.780
 No question.

2:01:01.780 --> 2:01:05.620
 You can do, as long as you touch that max heart rate, I'm good, right?

2:01:05.620 --> 2:01:07.700
 Ideal world, probably four to eight.

2:01:07.700 --> 2:01:08.700
 In that single session.

2:01:08.700 --> 2:01:09.700
 Ideal.

2:01:09.700 --> 2:01:13.140
 So if that takes you 20 seconds or 90 seconds, it's fine.

2:01:13.140 --> 2:01:18.180
 If you want to do 30 on 30 off, you want to do 20 on 40 off 40 on 20 off, those numbers

2:01:18.180 --> 2:01:19.180
 don't matter.

2:01:19.180 --> 2:01:21.940
 And is there an interference effect of this on the other sorts of training that we've

2:01:21.940 --> 2:01:22.940
 talked about?

2:01:22.940 --> 2:01:23.940
 It actually tends to be complimentary.

2:01:23.940 --> 2:01:28.220
 There, there is the, the evidence available suggests that this high interval stuff is,

2:01:28.220 --> 2:01:33.500
 is more likely to be complimentary to hypertrophy training probably because of lactate and some

2:01:33.500 --> 2:01:38.060
 other cool things which are very beneficial molecules that people don't understand.

2:01:38.060 --> 2:01:39.060
 They think it's bad.

2:01:39.060 --> 2:01:41.780
 It's a hugely, a hugely beneficial thing.

2:01:41.780 --> 2:01:46.860
 It can be interference, it can provide an interference if calories are not accounted

2:01:46.860 --> 2:01:48.820
 for, if rest is not accounted for and other things.

2:01:48.820 --> 2:01:51.100
 But in general it's, it's probably okay.

2:01:51.100 --> 2:01:56.060
 I wouldn't add it to your equation if you don't need it for maximizing hypertrophy,

2:01:56.060 --> 2:02:00.500
 but for the person who wants to just get well-rounded physiology, yeah, I wouldn't hesitate to do

2:02:00.500 --> 2:02:03.220
 these even in the same session or different sessions.

2:02:03.220 --> 2:02:04.220
 Terrific.

2:02:04.220 --> 2:02:09.820
 So, and if that's done once a week and the 150 to 180 minutes or so of zone two cardio

2:02:09.820 --> 2:02:14.420
 is done, you know, in the rest of the week, the person's doing their strength and hypertrophy

2:02:14.420 --> 2:02:17.340
 training, we would hope.

2:02:17.340 --> 2:02:20.140
 What other sorts of endurance practices could one incorporate?

2:02:20.140 --> 2:02:24.300
 You mentioned muscular endurance, like the ability, would like a wall sit or the ability

2:02:24.300 --> 2:02:25.300
 to do a plank.

2:02:25.300 --> 2:02:27.740
 Was that, is that something that, is that useful for anything?

2:02:27.740 --> 2:02:28.740
 Yes.

2:02:28.740 --> 2:02:30.340
 Is that doing planks and wall sitting?

2:02:30.340 --> 2:02:31.340
 No, no.

2:02:31.340 --> 2:02:32.340
 It's extraordinarily useful.

2:02:32.340 --> 2:02:34.420
 Let's hold on muscular endurance.

2:02:34.420 --> 2:02:36.580
 I want to finish one more thing on this side.

2:02:36.580 --> 2:02:42.620
 So if we're building this week of endurance, once a week hit that number, if you can do

2:02:42.620 --> 2:02:47.120
 repeated bouts, you know, we talked four to eight, that's fantastic.

2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:53.940
 If you can't muscle the, the, if you can't manage the mental energy every week, do it

2:02:53.940 --> 2:02:55.620
 every other week.

2:02:55.620 --> 2:02:56.620
 It's still very good, right?

2:02:56.620 --> 2:02:57.620
 Because I, I get it.

2:02:57.620 --> 2:03:01.900
 Like I'm a working person too and sometimes you're just like, I cannot, like those workouts

2:03:01.900 --> 2:03:05.180
 feel incredible afterwards, but man, they are daunting.

2:03:05.180 --> 2:03:07.120
 If you love this stuff, you could do it four times a week.

2:03:07.120 --> 2:03:09.840
 If you hate it though, it's not realistic to think you're going to be able to knock

2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:10.840
 this out.

2:03:10.840 --> 2:03:14.340
 You're going to end up doing 70, 80%, which is not going to get you the benefits.

2:03:14.340 --> 2:03:15.340
 So just don't do it.

2:03:15.340 --> 2:03:16.620
 You really have to hit that ceiling.

2:03:16.620 --> 2:03:17.620
 You got to get up there.

2:03:17.620 --> 2:03:18.620
 Close.

2:03:18.620 --> 2:03:19.620
 Have someone chase.

2:03:19.620 --> 2:03:25.020
 I always say, you know, the, when doing this, this kind of work in, in my mind, I'm thinking

2:03:25.020 --> 2:03:29.020
 that I'm basically being chased by somebody with a, with a syringe full of poison.

2:03:29.020 --> 2:03:30.020
 Yep.

2:03:30.020 --> 2:03:32.620
 You know, get your waterways out of the situation and for the benefit of what we're talking

2:03:32.620 --> 2:03:35.660
 about, the one I'm referring to is to just run.

2:03:35.660 --> 2:03:36.660
 Yeah.

2:03:36.660 --> 2:03:37.660
 Yeah.

2:03:37.660 --> 2:03:42.180
 My motivation is typically, if you just get this done, we're done in a couple of minutes.

2:03:42.180 --> 2:03:43.180
 Just get it done.

2:03:43.180 --> 2:03:46.860
 Like, don't go here if you're not going to do it, but when you show up, check in and

2:03:46.860 --> 2:03:48.220
 it's over really quickly.

2:03:48.220 --> 2:03:50.180
 Breathing down regulation afterwards.

2:03:50.180 --> 2:03:51.180
 100%.

2:03:51.180 --> 2:03:52.180
 You have to, right?

2:03:52.180 --> 2:03:53.240
 It's a huge key.

2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:55.140
 So if you absolutely can't do it, do it every other week.

2:03:55.140 --> 2:03:56.140
 That's twice a month.

2:03:56.140 --> 2:03:58.060
 Give me twice a month.

2:03:58.060 --> 2:03:59.060
 Can be done on the road.

2:03:59.060 --> 2:04:02.540
 Can be done at 20 minutes, like do a really good, thorough warmup.

2:04:02.540 --> 2:04:04.460
 Don't just jump into those by the way, right away.

2:04:04.460 --> 2:04:06.840
 It's not going to be as beneficial.

2:04:06.840 --> 2:04:11.140
 Really nice, good sweat broke, a really good warmup and then give me four minutes of hard

2:04:11.140 --> 2:04:12.140
 work and we're done.

2:04:12.140 --> 2:04:13.140
 Right?

2:04:13.140 --> 2:04:14.140
 Get out of there.

2:04:14.140 --> 2:04:17.900
 If you want to use like a bath or hot thermal stress to kind of like aid in that warmup

2:04:17.900 --> 2:04:18.900
 process, fine.

2:04:18.900 --> 2:04:22.580
 Getting the sauna and getting a hot bath, get really hot, get up there, warm up, knock

2:04:22.580 --> 2:04:23.580
 it out.

2:04:23.580 --> 2:04:25.220
 Whole thing is 20 minutes plus five minutes breathing.

2:04:25.220 --> 2:04:26.220
 Got it.

2:04:26.220 --> 2:04:27.500
 I'm going to start doing this.

2:04:27.500 --> 2:04:28.500
 It's so bad.

2:04:28.500 --> 2:04:29.500
 There's a bike right there.

2:04:29.500 --> 2:04:34.460
 Yeah, I've got every room in this studio that has a different piece of equipment it seems.

2:04:34.460 --> 2:04:37.820
 So I want that once a week, realistically every week if I have to.

2:04:37.820 --> 2:04:42.340
 I want that physical activity piece, call it whatever you want, long duration thing.

2:04:42.340 --> 2:04:45.460
 Ideally you'll do as much of that through your nose only.

2:04:45.460 --> 2:04:49.260
 You're not going to be able to do the interval stuff at nose only, don't even try.

2:04:49.260 --> 2:04:52.780
 But if you can go that whole 30 minute time or 20 or 40 minutes, whatever it's going to

2:04:52.780 --> 2:04:55.820
 be, that's actually a good way to regulate intensity.

2:04:55.820 --> 2:04:58.420
 So go as hard as you can while still being able to breathe through your nose only.

2:04:58.420 --> 2:05:02.780
 If you have to open up your mouth a little bit, fine, but try to stay there.

2:05:02.780 --> 2:05:07.420
 What you'll see is very quickly, you'll be able to increase your work output while just

2:05:07.420 --> 2:05:10.780
 breathing through your nose, which has a bunch of other benefits.

2:05:10.780 --> 2:05:18.480
 The other piece I want is this middle ground, which is, can you sustain hard work for eight

2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:22.180
 to 12, maybe as little as four minutes, I'll give you four to 12 minutes.

2:05:22.180 --> 2:05:25.420
 This doesn't have to be quite as high as the first one.

2:05:25.420 --> 2:05:30.740
 You don't have to get to a heart rate max, but can you get somewhere in the 80% range

2:05:30.740 --> 2:05:33.140
 and can you hold that for four minutes?

2:05:33.140 --> 2:05:37.940
 Maybe give me two minutes, two minutes of rest and do that twice.

2:05:37.940 --> 2:05:39.300
 Something like that.

2:05:39.300 --> 2:05:43.500
 Ideal situation is what a runner would do is like what we'll call mile repeats because

2:05:43.500 --> 2:05:46.180
 they're running four or five minute miles.

2:05:46.180 --> 2:05:48.680
 Whatever time it takes them to finish, they're going to rest that.

2:05:48.680 --> 2:05:50.260
 So it's a one to one work to rest ratio.

2:05:50.260 --> 2:05:54.460
 So a five minute mile rest five minutes and go again.

2:05:54.460 --> 2:05:56.500
 That's probably pretty unrealistic for a lot of folks.

2:05:56.500 --> 2:05:59.180
 Well, the five minute part is unrealistic for most folks.

2:05:59.180 --> 2:06:03.080
 For me, it would be, you know, eight minutes, eight minutes, fine.

2:06:03.080 --> 2:06:04.080
 Probably something like that.

2:06:04.080 --> 2:06:07.020
 Well, in your particular case, just do the 800 meter.

2:06:07.020 --> 2:06:12.600
 So do 800 meters, do something that takes two to six minutes of work.

2:06:12.600 --> 2:06:17.700
 It is a lower intensity than the max stuff, but it's a much higher workload.

2:06:17.700 --> 2:06:22.060
 That is probably going to give you, you might even argue the most cardiovascular benefit

2:06:22.060 --> 2:06:25.460
 because it is sustained work output and that's very critical.

2:06:25.460 --> 2:06:31.580
 The downside of kind of like that conversational pace, it's physical activity, it's movement,

2:06:31.580 --> 2:06:33.300
 it's blood flow, it's lymphatic drainage.

2:06:33.300 --> 2:06:35.900
 It's not very cardiovascularly challenging though.

2:06:35.900 --> 2:06:41.700
 You're just not going to get an optimal health from just walking actively.

2:06:41.700 --> 2:06:46.660
 So two to six minutes of hard work of hard work with an equivalent amount of rest in

2:06:46.660 --> 2:06:50.380
 between and then repeat how many times?

2:06:50.380 --> 2:06:53.660
 Twice if you have to, if it needs to be one rep, if it needs to be a six minute thing

2:06:53.660 --> 2:06:55.820
 and then downregulate, breathe.

2:06:55.820 --> 2:06:59.700
 Twice if you can do that, six times, eight times, like whatever you can really do.

2:06:59.700 --> 2:07:06.180
 And you can just take that as long of the training session as you want or short.

2:07:06.180 --> 2:07:07.460
 Exercise choice can be whatever you want.

2:07:07.460 --> 2:07:12.380
 So again, you can do sled pushes or it could be a kettlebell circuit or any combination

2:07:12.380 --> 2:07:15.540
 of things where you're just, you're working and you're not giving yourself a break.

2:07:15.540 --> 2:07:21.060
 You have got to be able to hold on at a very high waste product production level as well

2:07:21.060 --> 2:07:26.500
 as a high demand for energy and then bring it down.

2:07:26.500 --> 2:07:32.800
 And breathing during this two to six minutes of hard output is mainly through the nose

2:07:32.800 --> 2:07:35.140
 or combination nose and mouth or is that getting too technical?

2:07:35.140 --> 2:07:39.220
 Well, it's probably like I like it, but you tell me if it's too technical.

2:07:39.220 --> 2:07:41.620
 You're going to try to maintain nasal only as much as you can, but you're going to lose

2:07:41.620 --> 2:07:45.020
 it at some point.

2:07:45.020 --> 2:07:49.660
 You can go through Brian and Rob's gear system and learn more and you can kind of see what

2:07:49.660 --> 2:07:50.660
 gear to be in.

2:07:50.660 --> 2:07:55.100
 If you have to go nose in, mouth out or something like that, but I don't really care too much

2:07:55.100 --> 2:07:56.300
 honestly in that range.

2:07:56.300 --> 2:08:01.720
 I'm getting most of my nasal only stuff at night and training and everything.

2:08:01.720 --> 2:08:05.620
 So if you have to open up the throttle there to get the work done, that's okay.

2:08:05.620 --> 2:08:10.540
 Oh, then we'll actually go to your answer your question, which is muscular endurance.

2:08:10.540 --> 2:08:13.500
 Let's go back to that piece.

2:08:13.500 --> 2:08:17.100
 Muscular endurance is incredibly important for general maintenance of joint health.

2:08:17.100 --> 2:08:22.820
 In other words, you have got form follows function, right?

2:08:22.820 --> 2:08:27.340
 It's a very classic science-y physiology saying, meaning you've got a couple of different,

2:08:27.340 --> 2:08:31.060
 there's a bunch, but to make it easy, two different types of muscle fibers, fast twitch

2:08:31.060 --> 2:08:32.580
 and slow twitch.

2:08:32.580 --> 2:08:35.800
 Fast twitch fibers tend to be, but they're not always bigger.

2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:37.300
 They contract with a higher velocity.

2:08:37.300 --> 2:08:43.060
 That's why they are called fast twitch, but they tend to be more glycolytic and thus fatigueable.

2:08:43.060 --> 2:08:47.340
 Slow twitch are tend to be smaller or not always.

2:08:47.340 --> 2:08:51.120
 They are more packed with mitochondria that we're generally better at burning fat as fuel,

2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:52.540
 but contract with lower velocity.

2:08:52.540 --> 2:08:57.580
 Well, we have these two types so that we can regulate function more.

2:08:57.580 --> 2:09:02.900
 You have some muscle groups that we're going to, sorry, let me go back up a quick second.

2:09:02.900 --> 2:09:06.600
 Each individual muscle in a human body has a combination of some amount of fast and some

2:09:06.600 --> 2:09:08.080
 amount of slow.

2:09:08.080 --> 2:09:11.500
 That percentage of fast versus slow differs from muscle to muscle.

2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:14.700
 So it also differs from person to person.

2:09:14.700 --> 2:09:17.020
 Easy example is your calf muscle.

2:09:17.020 --> 2:09:19.380
 There's three, but there's two primary muscles in your calf.

2:09:19.380 --> 2:09:22.100
 One's called the soleus and one's the gastroc.

2:09:22.100 --> 2:09:25.980
 The gastroc is the one where if you take your toe and point it towards your face and then

2:09:25.980 --> 2:09:30.540
 flex, that's the one that pops out on the medial side, the inside.

2:09:30.540 --> 2:09:32.820
 The soleus is what we call an anti-gravity muscle.

2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:38.140
 And it is generally about 80% to even 90% slow twitch.

2:09:38.140 --> 2:09:43.980
 And that's because it's supposed to be contracted lightly all time, supposed to be on permanently.

2:09:43.980 --> 2:09:47.860
 It's meant to keep, we call it anti-gravity because it's meant to keep you erect, up and

2:09:47.860 --> 2:09:48.860
 moving.

2:09:48.860 --> 2:09:52.380
 Your spinal erector is supposed to do this, various muscles for postural are generally

2:09:52.380 --> 2:09:53.380
 slow twitch muscles.

2:09:53.380 --> 2:09:59.200
 So we're supposed to be on all times, not produce fast, not produce force, but don't

2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:00.800
 get tired.

2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:02.740
 The gastroc is the opposite.

2:10:02.740 --> 2:10:07.140
 It's not activated very often, but when it's activated, it's meant for extreme propulsion.

2:10:07.140 --> 2:10:10.980
 This gives us the ability to reach up and scratch our eyeball and also punch somebody,

2:10:10.980 --> 2:10:11.980
 right?

2:10:11.980 --> 2:10:15.740
 We have to be able to regulate force output, which is going back to Hennemann, right?

2:10:15.740 --> 2:10:19.140
 Controlling what we use and what we don't use while also not wasting energy, which is

2:10:19.140 --> 2:10:24.220
 the downside of activating a big threshold motor neuron is it requires a ton of energy.

2:10:24.220 --> 2:10:28.740
 It's a more efficient mode of energy, but the total amount is really, really high.

2:10:28.740 --> 2:10:36.660
 So muscular endurance is going to help those slow twitch muscle fibers and slow twitch

2:10:36.660 --> 2:10:40.900
 predominant muscles maintain their working job.

2:10:40.900 --> 2:10:44.260
 So if you lose your muscular endurance ability in your spinal erectors or your calf, you're

2:10:44.260 --> 2:10:46.400
 going to start slumping into bad positions.

2:10:46.400 --> 2:10:50.820
 You're going to be getting, putting joints in a movement pattern that they're not going

2:10:50.820 --> 2:10:52.580
 to be the most happy with.

2:10:52.580 --> 2:10:56.620
 So it's more about than being able to just maintain a two minute wall squat.

2:10:56.620 --> 2:11:01.440
 It's about maintaining joint integrity and allowing that musculature to not fatigue when

2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:04.460
 you ask it to do heavy and fast.

2:11:04.460 --> 2:11:09.380
 So what I mean by that is you've got a whole combination of muscles in your shoulder and

2:11:09.380 --> 2:11:11.700
 we will generally call these like the rotator cuff muscles.

2:11:11.700 --> 2:11:19.980
 Well, let's imagine those slow twitch postural muscles get fatigued and they start to lose

2:11:19.980 --> 2:11:25.480
 contractile tension and then you go to do something heavy or fast or an emergency situation.

2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:26.480
 Those are already prefatigued.

2:11:26.480 --> 2:11:31.100
 You're going to rely more upon the fast twitch muscle fibers, which are there less for postural

2:11:31.100 --> 2:11:32.140
 integrity.

2:11:32.140 --> 2:11:36.020
 You're likely to get out of position and this is a whole recipe of like, God, why is my

2:11:36.020 --> 2:11:37.460
 shoulder just hurting?

2:11:37.460 --> 2:11:39.640
 God, my back.

2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:44.140
 That's very often a case of the slow twitch fibers and the slow twitch muscle groups losing

2:11:44.140 --> 2:11:45.140
 muscular endurance.

2:11:45.140 --> 2:11:48.780
 So you need to build that back up so that they can control and hold the joint in the

2:11:48.780 --> 2:11:53.500
 position so the fast twitch fibers can then contract with force.

2:11:53.500 --> 2:11:59.140
 I'm hoping that what I'm going to say next meets what you said accurately.

2:11:59.140 --> 2:12:04.940
 My experience is that getting injured, lifting weights or even doing housework or yard work

2:12:04.940 --> 2:12:09.900
 almost always happens when I'm not paying attention, fatigued.

2:12:09.900 --> 2:12:16.060
 That's kind of obvious, but also getting in position to initiate a movement, setting down

2:12:16.060 --> 2:12:19.820
 a weight or lifting weights off the rack or picking up dumbbells.

2:12:19.820 --> 2:12:24.660
 That's almost always when I seem to activate this lower back thing that happens every,

2:12:24.660 --> 2:12:26.980
 you know, six or eight months.

2:12:26.980 --> 2:12:30.700
 And what you're saying, if I understand correctly, is that this muscular endurance from wall

2:12:30.700 --> 2:12:34.900
 sits or planks or things of that sort, maybe you could give us a few other examples of

2:12:34.900 --> 2:12:40.500
 these can help us because they actually prepare the system to do what we normally think of

2:12:40.500 --> 2:12:42.020
 as the more intense work.

2:12:42.020 --> 2:12:47.220
 So it's really the, it sounds like it's really the architecture of the body that includes

2:12:47.220 --> 2:12:52.420
 nerves and muscles and everything else, of course, that lets the limbs and other kind

2:12:52.420 --> 2:12:55.140
 of action end of the body do its best work.

2:12:55.140 --> 2:12:57.660
 Yeah, let it express its own power and force.

2:12:57.660 --> 2:12:58.660
 Yep.

2:12:58.660 --> 2:13:04.060
 We've actually landed on one of my final laws of strength and conditioning, which is similar

2:13:04.060 --> 2:13:05.220
 to what I said earlier, right?

2:13:05.220 --> 2:13:08.740
 So I said exercises do not determine adaptations.

2:13:08.740 --> 2:13:10.800
 Application determines adaptation.

2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:12.820
 So it sounds similar, but it's quite different.

2:13:12.820 --> 2:13:15.220
 There are no good or bad exercises.

2:13:15.220 --> 2:13:17.980
 There's only good or bad application.

2:13:17.980 --> 2:13:20.540
 Here's a great example of that, right?

2:13:20.540 --> 2:13:25.560
 So you do not get hurt deadlifting because deadlifts are dangerous.

2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:30.900
 You only get hurt deadlifting because you either got in bad position, you got in bad

2:13:30.900 --> 2:13:33.940
 position because you either started in bad position, which is one of the things you just

2:13:33.940 --> 2:13:38.020
 said, or you ended up in bad position.

2:13:38.020 --> 2:13:43.180
 You did too much volume, you did too much intensity, or you did too much complexity.

2:13:43.180 --> 2:13:48.340
 Those last three things all hurt you because they result in the first one, which is out

2:13:48.340 --> 2:13:53.480
 of position, or another way to think about this if it's not a visible change in position

2:13:53.480 --> 2:14:00.100
 is stress got put into a part of the system that should not absorb that much stress.

2:14:00.100 --> 2:14:05.780
 So you did too much of it, you did it too heavy, you got fatigued and so you broke position.

2:14:05.780 --> 2:14:07.500
 You got too heavy so you broke position.

2:14:07.500 --> 2:14:11.340
 You made the exercise too complex, you put too many moving parts in it, you put too many

2:14:11.340 --> 2:14:13.780
 joints in it, and you got out of position.

2:14:13.780 --> 2:14:15.560
 You did that too many times.

2:14:15.560 --> 2:14:20.820
 Over time, now we've led from either an acute injury, bam, you know, back pops and you fall

2:14:20.820 --> 2:14:24.540
 on the floor or just like, man, this thing is hurting over time.

2:14:24.540 --> 2:14:25.940
 All these are the result of the same thing.

2:14:25.940 --> 2:14:29.360
 So you cannot ever blame the exercise for causing the problem.

2:14:29.360 --> 2:14:32.540
 It's always either the user or the coach.

2:14:32.540 --> 2:14:37.140
 You programmed way too much here and I can't handle that position, or you yourself went

2:14:37.140 --> 2:14:38.140
 into it too much.

2:14:38.140 --> 2:14:42.340
 So if you're getting these little tweaks and problems going on, you've made an error in

2:14:42.340 --> 2:14:43.340
 one of those things.

2:14:43.340 --> 2:14:49.540
 So simply back off, reduce the complexity, give yourself more stability, less moving

2:14:49.540 --> 2:14:53.020
 parts, do less volume, do less intensity.

2:14:53.020 --> 2:14:56.620
 In fact, if you look at the people from the physical therapy world in terms of the pain

2:14:56.620 --> 2:15:01.940
 literature, it's very clear that just stopping a movement is very rarely going to work.

2:15:01.940 --> 2:15:06.340
 What you want to do is back off all the way down to just below that threshold of that's

2:15:06.340 --> 2:15:07.740
 what aggravates it.

2:15:07.740 --> 2:15:09.740
 And you want to train right there.

2:15:09.740 --> 2:15:11.220
 That's going to allow you to do two things.

2:15:11.220 --> 2:15:14.820
 Number one, tissue tolerance, and then number two, desensitization.

2:15:14.820 --> 2:15:19.000
 A lot of pain stuff, and you can probably speak a lot about this, especially with things

2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:23.480
 like low back pain, is there's not necessarily often much damage there.

2:15:23.480 --> 2:15:28.660
 It's a lot of hypersensitization of just pain signal, pain signal.

2:15:28.660 --> 2:15:31.380
 Omitting the movement entirely does not get that signal to go away.

2:15:31.380 --> 2:15:35.060
 You need to train just below that signal and desensitize it.

2:15:35.060 --> 2:15:38.160
 So you want to make sure that the muscular endurance allows you, you're just putting

2:15:38.160 --> 2:15:41.820
 volume right below where you start to get a tweak.

2:15:41.820 --> 2:15:44.060
 And it is beautifully effective for that.

2:15:44.060 --> 2:15:47.940
 I've experienced this right side lower back pain for years, sometimes shooting down the

2:15:47.940 --> 2:15:48.940
 hip.

2:15:48.940 --> 2:15:52.780
 The two things that really helped were doing anterior tib work.

2:15:52.780 --> 2:15:58.840
 So you know, hats off to knees over toes guy, Ben Patrick, who has created a lot of popularity

2:15:58.840 --> 2:16:00.780
 around tib work.

2:16:00.780 --> 2:16:05.580
 But it turns out joints, full range of motion, you're in a better spot.

2:16:05.580 --> 2:16:09.640
 Yeah, something about stabilizing the stuff from the knee down helped my back and then

2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:13.220
 also some some neck work and friends of mine are always teasing me that my gym is filled

2:16:13.220 --> 2:16:16.220
 with the most bizarre equipment, you know, it doesn't look like any other gym.

2:16:16.220 --> 2:16:19.140
 A lot of it is just designed to keep me healthy and still training.

2:16:19.140 --> 2:16:24.840
 But I love this idea of getting right at the below the threshold of pain activation and

2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:29.740
 not simply going into complete non-action or just taking complete rest because that

2:16:29.740 --> 2:16:32.140
 actually can be detrimental.

2:16:32.140 --> 2:16:37.300
 I'd love to talk about a few items that support training of all kinds and where there's a

2:16:37.300 --> 2:16:41.660
 lot of confusion and indeed, misconception and mystery.

2:16:41.660 --> 2:16:45.380
 And just get your take on these and I just want to acknowledge at the outset that for

2:16:45.380 --> 2:16:49.180
 some of these, there's a lot of science for some of them, there's less science, but there

2:16:49.180 --> 2:16:53.660
 certainly is a lot of experience in your camp.

2:16:53.660 --> 2:16:58.040
 And those categories are cold, heat and hydration.

2:16:58.040 --> 2:17:01.300
 Because obviously, whether or not you're a runner, whether or not you're strength training,

2:17:01.300 --> 2:17:05.340
 if you're a human being, you need to hydrate.

2:17:05.340 --> 2:17:10.780
 But in terms of work output and physical work output, maybe even cognitive work output,

2:17:10.780 --> 2:17:13.340
 maybe tackle hydration first.

2:17:13.340 --> 2:17:19.860
 There is what I call and what I think is now come to be known as the Galpin equation, which

2:17:19.860 --> 2:17:24.340
 you really do deserve credit for because I think that people realize that there are a

2:17:24.340 --> 2:17:29.780
 range of solutions out there, but there is a really a desperate need for straightforward

2:17:29.780 --> 2:17:33.220
 solutions that work for 75% of people, 75% of the time.

2:17:33.220 --> 2:17:35.700
 So hydration is key.

2:17:35.700 --> 2:17:39.160
 Maybe you could underscore just how, how key it is for us.

2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:43.440
 And then what is the Galpin equation as, as I call it, and I think others are now referring

2:17:43.440 --> 2:17:44.440
 to it.

2:17:44.440 --> 2:17:45.440
 Yeah.

2:17:45.440 --> 2:17:46.440
 Okay.

2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:51.020
 Benefits of hydration slash consequences of mis-hydration.

2:17:51.020 --> 2:17:57.380
 So whether it's dehydration or overload, you, physiology has hermetic curves, right?

2:17:57.380 --> 2:18:00.380
 Now, typically we think about this in terms of toxicology.

2:18:00.380 --> 2:18:05.900
 So what this means is at some point giving you a dose of something, testosterone is very

2:18:05.900 --> 2:18:06.900
 easy example.

2:18:06.900 --> 2:18:11.240
 If you're clinically deficient or low in testosterone and I gave you a little bit and it brings

2:18:11.240 --> 2:18:16.420
 you back into a normal range, you generally see an improvement in health and functionality.

2:18:16.420 --> 2:18:21.940
 Taking you though from normal to super high doesn't always necessarily provide additional

2:18:21.940 --> 2:18:22.940
 benefit.

2:18:22.940 --> 2:18:24.740
 In fact, if you continue to go, it's going to provide detriment, right?

2:18:24.740 --> 2:18:26.520
 So everything has this curve.

2:18:26.520 --> 2:18:31.320
 And then some things are hermetic stressors, which means like a, a small, short, fast insult

2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:35.140
 is actually beneficial because then you come back bigger, faster, stronger, and it's, that's

2:18:35.140 --> 2:18:37.020
 how adaptation works.

2:18:37.020 --> 2:18:38.020
 Basic hormesis.

2:18:38.020 --> 2:18:39.020
 Okay.

2:18:39.020 --> 2:18:40.020
 Hydration is the same way.

2:18:40.020 --> 2:18:44.340
 So at the end of the curve here, if you are under hydrated, we all know that you could

2:18:44.340 --> 2:18:45.340
 die, right?

2:18:45.340 --> 2:18:46.340
 You have to have things.

2:18:46.340 --> 2:18:52.380
 In fact, water is the only thing that is ubiquitous across biologies in terms of every living

2:18:52.380 --> 2:18:53.700
 thing has to have it.

2:18:53.700 --> 2:18:56.740
 There's no other vitamin mineral nutrient that is required among all living things with

2:18:56.740 --> 2:18:58.260
 the exception of water.

2:18:58.260 --> 2:19:02.100
 So that should give you a pretty good indication of it's important day, right?

2:19:02.100 --> 2:19:05.520
 Like you got to have this thing down here at the bottom.

2:19:05.520 --> 2:19:08.580
 If you're dehydrated and I give you more, it's beneficial effects.

2:19:08.580 --> 2:19:12.780
 However, if you're up the top already and I continue to give you more water past that,

2:19:12.780 --> 2:19:16.820
 now we run into actual problems and we can get what's called hyponatremia, which is more

2:19:16.820 --> 2:19:18.700
 common than people realize.

2:19:18.700 --> 2:19:23.780
 Netremia being actually not referring to the water, but the sodium concentration being

2:19:23.780 --> 2:19:25.140
 too low.

2:19:25.140 --> 2:19:28.620
 And you've probably talked about that at a length of why that's an issue.

2:19:28.620 --> 2:19:33.580
 If sodium potassium balances inside, outside of cell come off, your heart stops, right?

2:19:33.580 --> 2:19:36.740
 Muscle contraction ends and all these things.

2:19:36.740 --> 2:19:39.220
 So you don't want to be over or under hydrated.

2:19:39.220 --> 2:19:45.100
 So understanding this rough equation I sort of loosely calculated one day is helpful for

2:19:45.100 --> 2:19:46.100
 that.

2:19:46.100 --> 2:19:49.780
 The most context is talking about how much water to drink throughout the day and then

2:19:49.780 --> 2:19:51.420
 how much water to drink during exercise.

2:19:51.420 --> 2:19:57.840
 So the very easy answer is half your body weight in ounces per day is a very loose guideline

2:19:57.840 --> 2:19:59.500
 for total amount of fluid consumption.

2:19:59.500 --> 2:20:02.260
 So if you weigh 200 pounds, aim for a hundred ounces of water.

2:20:02.260 --> 2:20:05.180
 It's like a very easy number.

2:20:05.180 --> 2:20:10.380
 If you hit that, you're probably, I'd say 90% of you are a good 90% of the time alone.

2:20:10.380 --> 2:20:14.620
 If you then go to exercise, you need to then account for that fluid loss with exercise.

2:20:14.620 --> 2:20:23.100
 And in general, you want to consume 125% to 150% of the amount of weight you lost in fluid.

2:20:23.100 --> 2:20:28.240
 In other words, if you worked out and you were 200 pounds naked and you went and did

2:20:28.240 --> 2:20:31.900
 your workout and then you dried off and you weighed yourself again and now you're 198

2:20:31.900 --> 2:20:34.140
 pounds, you lost two pounds of water.

2:20:34.140 --> 2:20:35.580
 That's 32 ounces.

2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:39.140
 You want to drink back about 125% of that.

2:20:39.140 --> 2:20:44.580
 So instead of drinking 32 ounces, I want you to drink 40, 42, 45, like something like that.

2:20:44.580 --> 2:20:49.660
 Because one of the reasons why is unless you're drinking something that is isotonic, meaning

2:20:49.660 --> 2:20:53.840
 the same exact concentration in your blood and that you're in your fluid, you're just

2:20:53.840 --> 2:20:56.020
 going to go closer to that hyponatremia.

2:20:56.020 --> 2:21:00.340
 You're going to get a bunch of baro reflector responses and you're going to actually think

2:21:00.340 --> 2:21:02.620
 you have too much fluid and you're going to urinate it out.

2:21:02.620 --> 2:21:05.820
 What if I'm not weighing myself before and after workouts?

2:21:05.820 --> 2:21:13.160
 And is there a shorthand version of this that, you know, after training for an hour, I should

2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:18.880
 drink at least X number of ounces, assuming it's at kind of taller, you know, I'm not

2:21:18.880 --> 2:21:20.380
 sweating super heavily.

2:21:20.380 --> 2:21:21.380
 Yeah.

2:21:21.380 --> 2:21:28.780
 Um, in that particular case, you could probably go something like if everyone in the world

2:21:28.780 --> 2:21:35.500
 did, I don't know, 12 to 20 ounces, that's probably like pretty decent and they're probably

2:21:35.500 --> 2:21:36.500
 doing that.

2:21:36.500 --> 2:21:37.500
 Right?

2:21:37.500 --> 2:21:38.500
 Yeah.

2:21:38.500 --> 2:21:39.500
 Yeah.

2:21:39.500 --> 2:21:40.500
 And what about electrolytes?

2:21:40.500 --> 2:21:45.380
 If that thing only works though, if you're coming in at optimal hydration, then this

2:21:45.380 --> 2:21:46.380
 is the problem.

2:21:46.380 --> 2:21:50.300
 This is why you have to, you have to flag this starting with a good total daily amount

2:21:50.300 --> 2:21:51.580
 of water.

2:21:51.580 --> 2:21:54.340
 Because if you're coming in and you're like, oh, I drink two or three glasses of water

2:21:54.340 --> 2:21:58.540
 a day, then you might need to drink 50 or 60 ounces post workout because you're way

2:21:58.540 --> 2:21:59.640
 behind.

2:21:59.640 --> 2:22:03.780
 So that like, oh, 12 ounces or so works if you're already generally very well hydrated.

2:22:03.780 --> 2:22:07.500
 And if people are drinking, you know, four to six glasses of water a day, but they're

2:22:07.500 --> 2:22:12.360
 also drinking a lot of caffeine in any form, then they're going to be excreting more water

2:22:12.360 --> 2:22:13.360
 in most cases.

2:22:13.360 --> 2:22:14.360
 Right?

2:22:14.360 --> 2:22:15.360
 Well, because caffeine's a diuretic.

2:22:15.360 --> 2:22:16.360
 Okay.

2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:18.280
 It kind of is, but it kind of isn't either.

2:22:18.280 --> 2:22:23.180
 It's not the diuretic that we used to think about it as, um, it is still fluid consumption.

2:22:23.180 --> 2:22:27.340
 So it's only a diuretic if it causes you to excrete more fluid than it actually was being

2:22:27.340 --> 2:22:28.340
 intake.

2:22:28.340 --> 2:22:35.460
 So, um, if caffeine intake is in a normal range, I don't, I don't have to worry about

2:22:35.460 --> 2:22:36.580
 the diuretic effects.

2:22:36.580 --> 2:22:41.360
 If someone is drinking 12 cups of coffee a day, we're going to, or they're taking caffeine

2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:42.360
 pills or something.

2:22:42.360 --> 2:22:46.040
 Now the excretion is going to outkick the coverage.

2:22:46.040 --> 2:22:47.040
 So now we're gonna have problems, right?

2:22:47.040 --> 2:22:49.420
 Cause there's no fluid consumption with the caffeine pill.

2:22:49.420 --> 2:22:53.800
 So in general, things like tea, consumption, like I'm not super worried about those things.

2:22:53.800 --> 2:22:56.740
 You can count those towards your total fluid intake if you want.

2:22:56.740 --> 2:23:01.820
 So if you're like, I drink 60 ounces of water plus 20 ounces of coffee, and then, you know,

2:23:01.820 --> 2:23:05.540
 this is like, you're gonna add that all up and you're going to be totally okay.

2:23:05.540 --> 2:23:10.620
 So natural, you also have problems with synthetic forms of caffeine versus natural forms of

2:23:10.620 --> 2:23:11.860
 caffeine.

2:23:11.860 --> 2:23:13.740
 Natural forms are, are pretty okay.

2:23:13.740 --> 2:23:15.540
 So coffee, tea, et cetera.

2:23:15.540 --> 2:23:16.540
 Yeah.

2:23:16.540 --> 2:23:17.540
 All that stuff.

2:23:17.540 --> 2:23:18.540
 Pill form is where it gets tricky.

2:23:18.540 --> 2:23:19.540
 Always.

2:23:19.540 --> 2:23:20.540
 Like always, right?

2:23:20.540 --> 2:23:25.060
 So general, just eat real food and things, you're gonna be just fine.

2:23:25.060 --> 2:23:31.540
 The last piece to consider is your diet quality matters because the fluid content in your

2:23:31.540 --> 2:23:34.560
 food can vary wildly.

2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:42.980
 So something like a bagel might be, you know, five to 10% water or something like a watermelon

2:23:42.980 --> 2:23:49.260
 is 98%, 95%, something in a huge range, even meat is very high percentage of fluid intake.

2:23:49.260 --> 2:23:52.700
 Like it's a really high, even after you cook it, there's still a lot of fluid in there.

2:23:52.700 --> 2:23:59.140
 So if you're eating a whole food, mostly whole food based diet, your endogenous hydration

2:23:59.140 --> 2:24:01.460
 is actually pretty high already just from your food.

2:24:01.460 --> 2:24:06.780
 If you're eating a very highly processed, dehydrated, oversalted diet, you've, you're

2:24:06.780 --> 2:24:09.020
 way low on hydration just in your food.

2:24:09.020 --> 2:24:10.620
 So you have to factor all these things.

2:24:10.620 --> 2:24:15.040
 And in fact, one of the things that happens to us constantly with folks that go from a

2:24:15.040 --> 2:24:19.700
 like highly processed, low quality diet to a high quality one is they just, they're just

2:24:19.700 --> 2:24:20.700
 peeing nonstop.

2:24:20.700 --> 2:24:21.700
 I'm like, what the hell is going on?

2:24:21.700 --> 2:24:26.140
 I'm like, well, you're actually have brought in 60 additional ounces of water in your diet

2:24:26.140 --> 2:24:27.900
 relative to what you used to have.

2:24:27.900 --> 2:24:34.100
 And you've gone from 10 grams of sodium there to four to two, sometimes one.

2:24:34.100 --> 2:24:35.100
 Sometimes it gets very low.

2:24:35.100 --> 2:24:36.100
 Cause you're not like salt.

2:24:36.100 --> 2:24:37.100
 Are you salting your food?

2:24:37.100 --> 2:24:38.100
 No.

2:24:38.100 --> 2:24:39.100
 Okay.

2:24:39.100 --> 2:24:41.120
 Well we don't have sodium intake then like we're way down.

2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:43.940
 So everything that we're considering is based on that.

2:24:43.940 --> 2:24:46.540
 So let's assume someone's eating a pretty well balanced diet.

2:24:46.540 --> 2:24:52.100
 They're drinking 60 ounces of water and maybe some caffeine, coffee and tea, things like

2:24:52.100 --> 2:24:53.960
 that.

2:24:53.960 --> 2:24:57.620
 We don't exactly know the optimal amount of sodium one should intake.

2:24:57.620 --> 2:24:58.620
 It is very clear.

2:24:58.620 --> 2:25:03.940
 High sodium concentrations are still associated with a lot of negative health outcomes, especially

2:25:03.940 --> 2:25:08.340
 in combination with poor physical activity, in combination with low food quality and all

2:25:08.340 --> 2:25:09.660
 their comorbidities.

2:25:09.660 --> 2:25:10.740
 That's a very bad thing.

2:25:10.740 --> 2:25:14.260
 You need to be very careful about those things.

2:25:14.260 --> 2:25:18.180
 If everything else is okay, we're okay playing with a little bit of higher salt.

2:25:18.180 --> 2:25:19.700
 In fact, you're probably gonna feel better.

2:25:19.700 --> 2:25:22.540
 You're gonna feel generally pretty good.

2:25:22.540 --> 2:25:24.780
 You just, it needs to be very clear.

2:25:24.780 --> 2:25:28.500
 If you are overweight, highly stressed, and you don't have a lot of these things ticked

2:25:28.500 --> 2:25:32.340
 off and you have known comorbidities, you really need to pay attention to salt intake.

2:25:32.340 --> 2:25:34.700
 It can be very nasty.

2:25:34.700 --> 2:25:40.000
 So that being said, what we're generally going to look at folks is are you at least can we

2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:43.440
 categorize you as a low sodium or high sodium sweater?

2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:47.460
 If so, there's a whole list of electrolytes you can look on that are gonna have something

2:25:47.460 --> 2:25:51.740
 like 200 to 400 milligrams per serving.

2:25:51.740 --> 2:25:53.900
 There's a whole list of these things.

2:25:53.900 --> 2:25:56.840
 If you're a low sodium sweater, I'm probably gonna send you after one of those.

2:25:56.840 --> 2:25:59.860
 If you're a high sodium sweater, there's a lot of electrolyte supplements that are closer

2:25:59.860 --> 2:26:05.520
 to six or 800, even a whole gram per single serving size.

2:26:05.520 --> 2:26:06.520
 So you wanna play with that.

2:26:06.520 --> 2:26:07.520
 A very-

2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:09.520
 How do you know if you're a low sodium or high sodium sweater?

2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:14.840
 We actually have an episode on salt we put out that, or is coming out soon if hasn't

2:26:14.840 --> 2:26:21.080
 come out already, which is when you look at the hazard ratios for salt intake, basically

2:26:21.080 --> 2:26:26.340
 your probability of really bad things happen to you, goes way up as you get towards a lot

2:26:26.340 --> 2:26:31.020
 of sodium intake, 10, 12 grams per day.

2:26:31.020 --> 2:26:34.340
 And this is translated to teaspoons of salt, et cetera, but also very low sodium intake

2:26:34.340 --> 2:26:36.300
 is a problem.

2:26:36.300 --> 2:26:37.780
 It's not a perfect U shape.

2:26:37.780 --> 2:26:41.900
 It's kind of a J shaped curve or a kind of hockey stick shape more or less.

2:26:41.900 --> 2:26:45.860
 But how would I know if I'm a low sodium or high sodium sweater?

2:26:45.860 --> 2:26:49.980
 Would I just kind of lick my sweat or have someone else do it?

2:26:49.980 --> 2:26:52.740
 Find a super friend who will lick your sweat for you.

2:26:52.740 --> 2:26:53.740
 Same with how-

2:26:53.740 --> 2:26:57.060
 No willing volunteers that I'm aware of, but would I be able to tell?

2:26:57.060 --> 2:26:58.060
 Yep.

2:26:58.060 --> 2:26:59.060
 You can get sweat testing done.

2:26:59.060 --> 2:27:02.620
 Actually, you have a number of options.

2:27:02.620 --> 2:27:05.220
 The kind of the original one that most of us used in the background for many years was

2:27:05.220 --> 2:27:07.380
 called Levelin.

2:27:07.380 --> 2:27:08.500
 They'll send you out a little patch.

2:27:08.500 --> 2:27:11.540
 You can wear that, send it in the lab and they'll measure it directly in the lab and

2:27:11.540 --> 2:27:12.540
 send it back.

2:27:12.540 --> 2:27:14.860
 It's 150 bucks or-

2:27:14.860 --> 2:27:17.500
 Did they bring you into low, medium and high sodium?

2:27:17.500 --> 2:27:21.620
 They're going to do that, but they're going to tell you exactly the milligrams.

2:27:21.620 --> 2:27:25.700
 And then they're going to actually tell you what products and stuff that are exactly matched.

2:27:25.700 --> 2:27:27.740
 Do you do this with professional athletes?

2:27:27.740 --> 2:27:30.260
 We have many times.

2:27:30.260 --> 2:27:32.300
 You can do a more consumer grade version.

2:27:32.300 --> 2:27:34.020
 Gatorade has a patch.

2:27:34.020 --> 2:27:36.280
 For 25 bucks, you can get two of them.

2:27:36.280 --> 2:27:40.180
 You can put that patch on your left forearm and download the Gatorade app and you can

2:27:40.180 --> 2:27:44.280
 do a workout, measure it right there and click it over and they'll tell you exactly, not

2:27:44.280 --> 2:27:47.740
 only high or low, but again, they'll tell you the milligrams of sodium that are in your

2:27:47.740 --> 2:27:51.460
 sweat and then you can figure out, again, kind of high, medium or low.

2:27:51.460 --> 2:27:52.460
 Interesting.

2:27:52.460 --> 2:27:55.580
 I do much better on a slightly higher sodium intake.

2:27:55.580 --> 2:27:56.580
 Most do.

2:27:56.580 --> 2:27:58.940
 But in my carbohydrate, I do eat carbohydrates.

2:27:58.940 --> 2:28:01.820
 I'm one of those that is pretty moderate, but I try and eat clean foods.

2:28:01.820 --> 2:28:05.500
 So I noticed, and I tend to be slightly low blood pressure.

2:28:05.500 --> 2:28:10.580
 So again, to reiterate the warning there that if somebody is a prehypertension or has hypertension

2:28:10.580 --> 2:28:13.720
 or obese, you really do need to be careful with your sodium intake.

2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:17.360
 But many people seem to find that they feel better when they increase their sodium intake

2:28:17.360 --> 2:28:20.840
 and they're still in that healthy portion of the hazard ratio curve.

2:28:20.840 --> 2:28:24.940
 Most of the athletes, I would say in general, we're going to go higher in salt.

2:28:24.940 --> 2:28:27.620
 When they come, we're going to run their stuff and we're going to add salt.

2:28:27.620 --> 2:28:28.620
 Almost always.

2:28:28.620 --> 2:28:30.780
 Very few times have I gone, ah, we need to cut this back.

2:28:30.780 --> 2:28:36.020
 One of the exception, the ones that come in that eat like 14 year olds and I'm like, okay,

2:28:36.020 --> 2:28:41.040
 you're at 15 milligrams or you're 15 grams a day because you're eating nothing but garbage.

2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:44.040
 So we're like, we're going to come down, you're going to feel way better and all this bloating

2:28:44.040 --> 2:28:46.940
 and everything else that's going to happen, go down.

2:28:46.940 --> 2:28:47.940
 You can do that.

2:28:47.940 --> 2:28:50.460
 There are actually more, there are biosensors that are coming out that are not available

2:28:50.460 --> 2:28:52.620
 yet, but they're coming very soon in this space.

2:28:52.620 --> 2:28:56.460
 They're going to be able to give you real time metrics on salt.

2:28:56.460 --> 2:28:58.980
 So you can pay attention to those.

2:28:58.980 --> 2:29:04.340
 I haven't seen one and used one personally, so I don't want to espouse about how good

2:29:04.340 --> 2:29:08.540
 or bad it is, but I know that those are coming from a handful of companies.

2:29:08.540 --> 2:29:12.980
 An easy way to do is just look at, wear a hat or wear some sort of headband or something

2:29:12.980 --> 2:29:13.980
 and do your workout.

2:29:13.980 --> 2:29:15.200
 Take it off.

2:29:15.200 --> 2:29:21.300
 If you see a just huge white band or if it's completely clear and that's going to tell

2:29:21.300 --> 2:29:25.520
 you big white band, you're probably a high salt sweater, completely clear, very little

2:29:25.520 --> 2:29:26.520
 coming out.

2:29:26.520 --> 2:29:27.520
 That's great.

2:29:27.520 --> 2:29:32.380
 And I can see the posts on Instagram now, people showing their salt band from, from,

2:29:32.380 --> 2:29:33.380
 from sweating.

2:29:33.380 --> 2:29:37.180
 I mean, obviously salt is so essential for so many physiological functions.

2:29:37.180 --> 2:29:39.420
 You don't want too high or too low, but if you're losing more, it makes sense.

2:29:39.420 --> 2:29:41.020
 You would need to take in more.

2:29:41.020 --> 2:29:47.940
 So half of my body weight in ounces as a just foundation of, of a fluid intake coffee and

2:29:47.940 --> 2:29:51.300
 tea could be included in that, but that should probably be mostly water or things similar

2:29:51.300 --> 2:29:53.060
 to it.

2:29:53.060 --> 2:29:59.140
 Um, what, and then during exercise, the, how do I want to think about this again?

2:29:59.140 --> 2:30:01.340
 Let's say I'm a, let's say I'm a high salt output.

2:30:01.340 --> 2:30:04.900
 Then I'd want to drink maybe 40 ounces of water with or, or more.

2:30:04.900 --> 2:30:05.900
 Yeah.

2:30:05.900 --> 2:30:06.900
 Okay.

2:30:06.900 --> 2:30:10.380
 So let's talk about pre and mid and post, right?

2:30:10.380 --> 2:30:11.740
 So what to drink pre.

2:30:11.740 --> 2:30:14.860
 If you, if you come in having hit these rules, you're okay.

2:30:14.860 --> 2:30:19.500
 And pre workout can be as little as like five or six ounces, basically a couple of sips

2:30:19.500 --> 2:30:20.860
 of water.

2:30:20.860 --> 2:30:21.860
 Fine.

2:30:21.860 --> 2:30:26.540
 Um, if you come in poorly hydrated, then you maybe need to go more like 12, but here's

2:30:26.540 --> 2:30:27.540
 the deal.

2:30:27.540 --> 2:30:31.620
 If you start off a session in a bad spot, you're not going to catch back up.

2:30:31.620 --> 2:30:34.180
 Like you're just, you're, you're in trouble.

2:30:34.180 --> 2:30:35.940
 Let's say you come in, you did, you follow directions.

2:30:35.940 --> 2:30:43.220
 500 milligrams salt before 500 milligrams after a very easy rule, pick whatever source

2:30:43.220 --> 2:30:44.220
 you want.

2:30:44.220 --> 2:30:45.680
 That's a couple of sprinkles of table salt.

2:30:45.680 --> 2:30:47.100
 If you want Himalayan, that's fine.

2:30:47.100 --> 2:30:48.100
 You don't have to.

2:30:48.100 --> 2:30:52.700
 Himalayan is actually a fairly low sodium salt, so it's not the best for, for this purposes.

2:30:52.700 --> 2:30:55.260
 Um, if you're a higher solder sweater, a little bit more.

2:30:55.260 --> 2:30:59.520
 If you want to go choose an electrolyte of which there are infinite, um, you can look

2:30:59.520 --> 2:31:04.020
 on the packet and it'll tell you, you know, 250 milligrams per serving or 400 or 600 or

2:31:04.020 --> 2:31:08.300
 whatever happens to be, but around 500 pre 500 post is a very general rule.

2:31:08.300 --> 2:31:14.980
 And then during is thanks to you, uh, my famous Galpin equation now that is all over the world.

2:31:14.980 --> 2:31:18.840
 All I did is I took the literature and I said, okay, in general, the research shows pretty

2:31:18.840 --> 2:31:22.340
 clearly two milligrams per kilogram body weight over 15 minutes seems to put you in a pretty

2:31:22.340 --> 2:31:23.340
 good spot.

2:31:23.340 --> 2:31:26.060
 Most people don't think about kilograms or milligrams.

2:31:26.060 --> 2:31:27.820
 So can I just run that over?

2:31:27.820 --> 2:31:31.540
 And then it turns out it's about your body weight divided by 30 in ounces.

2:31:31.540 --> 2:31:33.980
 Like that's, that's all you have to body weight and pounds divided by 30.

2:31:33.980 --> 2:31:34.980
 Yeah, exactly.

2:31:34.980 --> 2:31:35.980
 Right.

2:31:35.980 --> 2:31:39.780
 So you weigh 200 pounds divided by 30 and that's the number of ounces you don't want

2:31:39.780 --> 2:31:41.860
 to go every 15 or 20 minutes.

2:31:41.860 --> 2:31:47.140
 So I'm getting that amount every 15 to 20 minutes throughout the training.

2:31:47.140 --> 2:31:50.240
 And now in the weight room, that's pretty easy to do because there are rest intervals,

2:31:50.240 --> 2:31:54.260
 but you, people will need to do this while running or cycling.

2:31:54.260 --> 2:31:58.420
 Um, and that can cause a little bit of gastric distress if you're not used to it.

2:31:58.420 --> 2:31:59.420
 Is that right?

2:31:59.420 --> 2:32:02.780
 You can, you can learn to run with a, with some water in your belly.

2:32:02.780 --> 2:32:08.020
 A hundred percent, the gut is very trainable in a lot of directions, but in terms of fluid

2:32:08.020 --> 2:32:10.900
 as well as carbohydrate, which is another thing that is going to get people.

2:32:10.900 --> 2:32:13.300
 Um, but that's, yeah, very trainable.

2:32:13.300 --> 2:32:16.460
 It'll be uncomfortable initially, but you'll, you'll quickly get into it.

2:32:16.460 --> 2:32:22.260
 The better solution for those folks just come in hydrated and you might not even need any

2:32:22.260 --> 2:32:23.260
 water.

2:32:23.260 --> 2:32:25.280
 You could probably perform just fine.

2:32:25.280 --> 2:32:28.800
 So the ones that don't have as much of an opportunity, you really have to emphasize

2:32:28.800 --> 2:32:30.380
 walking in.

2:32:30.380 --> 2:32:32.860
 We have this problem with like a professional golfers.

2:32:32.860 --> 2:32:35.660
 They have plenty of time to drink water, but they're so focused on the shot and there's

2:32:35.660 --> 2:32:37.180
 a lot of variables coming up.

2:32:37.180 --> 2:32:40.380
 Once they hit their shot and they're moving on to the next one, they're thinking about,

2:32:40.380 --> 2:32:44.940
 I mean, they're going over a scorecard of 185 yards away.

2:32:44.940 --> 2:32:46.460
 Can I go 184 and a half yards?

2:32:46.460 --> 2:32:47.540
 Can I go 186 yard?

2:32:47.540 --> 2:32:48.540
 What's the slope of that?

2:32:48.540 --> 2:32:49.540
 What, what's the wind up here?

2:32:49.540 --> 2:32:50.540
 What's the wind up there?

2:32:50.540 --> 2:32:51.540
 What's it like?

2:32:51.540 --> 2:32:54.340
 It's just, they're just thinking and they just forget even though they have four and

2:32:54.340 --> 2:32:55.340
 a half hours.

2:32:55.340 --> 2:32:58.580
 So we have to make sure that they immediately get off the course.

2:32:58.580 --> 2:33:01.780
 We go right into recovery as hard as we possibly can.

2:33:01.780 --> 2:33:02.780
 They wake up the next morning.

2:33:02.780 --> 2:33:03.780
 They're in a good spot.

2:33:03.780 --> 2:33:05.060
 We crush recovery.

2:33:05.060 --> 2:33:08.220
 And now it's like, hey, if you can remember to drink this, great.

2:33:08.220 --> 2:33:10.960
 If not, we're still fine.

2:33:10.960 --> 2:33:15.340
 If it's not a big deal and you have time, like in a lifter, because I deal with that

2:33:15.340 --> 2:33:16.340
 problem with fighters too.

2:33:16.340 --> 2:33:19.580
 Like I, we can only drink so much in the middle of a fight.

2:33:19.580 --> 2:33:22.340
 A couple sips over there, but we can't go mix them.

2:33:22.340 --> 2:33:23.340
 Two milliliters.

2:33:23.340 --> 2:33:24.500
 It's like, can you get a couple sips in?

2:33:24.500 --> 2:33:25.500
 Yeah.

2:33:25.500 --> 2:33:26.500
 Oh shit.

2:33:26.500 --> 2:33:27.500
 Forgot.

2:33:27.500 --> 2:33:28.500
 Like it's not going to happen.

2:33:28.500 --> 2:33:29.500
 It's not going to happen anymore.

2:33:29.500 --> 2:33:33.100
 So start your recovery process immediately and then come in the next day.

2:33:33.100 --> 2:33:34.100
 That's your window.

2:33:34.100 --> 2:33:36.700
 And then whatever you can get in during the workout, that's fine too.

2:33:36.700 --> 2:33:42.080
 If you're a higher salt sweater, instead of doing 500, 500, 100, maybe go 750, 750.

2:33:42.080 --> 2:33:48.720
 If you have a longer bout of exercise, especially if it's hot or humid, then you might want

2:33:48.720 --> 2:33:51.940
 to consider some salt in the workout as well.

2:33:51.940 --> 2:33:56.020
 And 300 milligrams during the workout, totally fine.

2:33:56.020 --> 2:33:59.900
 It's enough if it is a really long workout and it's really hot and you're going to lose

2:33:59.900 --> 2:34:02.840
 pounds during it, you need a specific strategy.

2:34:02.840 --> 2:34:06.140
 If you're going to lose less than a pound, you don't need to worry about it.

2:34:06.140 --> 2:34:09.900
 You're going to be, it's not going to be enough of a detriment for you to really care.

2:34:09.900 --> 2:34:11.460
 So that's a kind of a rough rule.

2:34:11.460 --> 2:34:16.540
 Now if you're 200 plus pounds, maybe that number moves from one pound to two pounds.

2:34:16.540 --> 2:34:18.900
 But really the number we're looking at is what 1% of your body weight.

2:34:18.900 --> 2:34:22.780
 If you're losing more than 1% of your body weight, we need to start caring.

2:34:22.780 --> 2:34:26.100
 If it's less than 1%, it's not going to really pay that much of a difference.

2:34:26.100 --> 2:34:31.020
 Okay, so for myself, because I don't get super technical, I don't wear any devices besides

2:34:31.020 --> 2:34:32.020
 a wristwatch.

2:34:32.020 --> 2:34:33.020
 Nice watch.

2:34:33.020 --> 2:34:34.020
 Thanks.

2:34:34.020 --> 2:34:40.860
 I do the very attached to this watch or it's attached to me, I suppose.

2:34:40.860 --> 2:34:44.380
 My body weight in pounds divided by two, that's what I'm going to try and get across the entire

2:34:44.380 --> 2:34:46.900
 day as a kind of baseline.

2:34:46.900 --> 2:34:51.760
 And then my body weight in pounds divided by 30 during the workout.

2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:55.660
 Maybe 15 or 20 minutes, that I'm going to try and consume that amount.

2:34:55.660 --> 2:34:59.900
 And then I definitely do better when I increase the amount of salt that I'm taking in anywhere

2:34:59.900 --> 2:35:05.940
 from 500 to 500 milligrams to a gram of salt, several times a day actually.

2:35:05.940 --> 2:35:10.800
 But I'm not eating that often, which leads me to my other question, which is, I prefer

2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:16.500
 to train fasted or semi-fasted, meaning first thing in the morning or within an hour or

2:35:16.500 --> 2:35:17.500
 two of waking.

2:35:17.500 --> 2:35:21.020
 Obviously I've been fasting while I'm asleep or having not eaten anything for three or

2:35:21.020 --> 2:35:22.020
 four hours before.

2:35:22.020 --> 2:35:27.180
 I just feel lighter and more energetic.

2:35:27.180 --> 2:35:30.020
 If that works for me, is that okay?

2:35:30.020 --> 2:35:33.820
 Or should I try, is it better to eat something before one trains?

2:35:33.820 --> 2:35:37.380
 Personal preference, easy answer there.

2:35:37.380 --> 2:35:43.300
 It depends on, of course, how hard you trained, what the training was like, what sport you're

2:35:43.300 --> 2:35:47.620
 involved with, how many total counts, et cetera, but in general, personal preference for the

2:35:47.620 --> 2:35:48.620
 average person.

2:35:48.620 --> 2:35:56.940
 And that probably handles 90% of the questions about that cold, cold showers, ice baths,

2:35:56.940 --> 2:35:58.380
 and cold immersion up to the neck.

2:35:58.380 --> 2:36:01.700
 I always preface this by saying there are not a lot of studies.

2:36:01.700 --> 2:36:05.940
 There are some, but not a lot of controlled studies looking at cold showers because it's

2:36:05.940 --> 2:36:08.860
 harder to control the variables of where people stand.

2:36:08.860 --> 2:36:13.540
 So I would say if you have access to cold immersion of some sort, ice bath or cold immersion,

2:36:13.540 --> 2:36:14.540
 great.

2:36:14.540 --> 2:36:17.340
 But if you don't, cold showers will be the next best thing.

2:36:17.340 --> 2:36:23.740
 The lore goes that if you do an ice bath or cold water immersion after strength or hypertrophy

2:36:23.740 --> 2:36:27.560
 training that you are short circuiting some of that.

2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:31.580
 The lore also goes that cold showers might be okay.

2:36:31.580 --> 2:36:39.700
 And my interpretation of those data and that discussion is that all that is probably true,

2:36:39.700 --> 2:36:45.240
 but I have a hard time imagining that the effects are so robust that it can completely

2:36:45.240 --> 2:36:50.660
 prevent strength gains and hypertrophy such that my stance for myself is try and do the

2:36:50.660 --> 2:36:54.580
 cold exposure training away from the strength and hypertrophy training.

2:36:54.580 --> 2:36:59.360
 But if you can't do it any other time, right afterward probably isn't going to throw my

2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:04.340
 whole system out of whack and prevent the improvements.

2:37:04.340 --> 2:37:07.640
 Am I deluding myself?

2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:08.640
 Couple of caveats here.

2:37:08.640 --> 2:37:11.980
 Number one, I would say I have a personal vested interest in cold.

2:37:11.980 --> 2:37:15.220
 I've been around this stuff for a long time.

2:37:15.220 --> 2:37:21.220
 Being involved and being an advisor for XPT and being in this space a long time, I'm a

2:37:21.220 --> 2:37:23.740
 big believer in cold, especially cold water.

2:37:23.740 --> 2:37:24.740
 Deliberate cold exposure.

2:37:24.740 --> 2:37:25.740
 A hundred percent, right?

2:37:25.740 --> 2:37:32.660
 So that being said, I do think getting into an ice bath immediately after a hypertrophy

2:37:32.660 --> 2:37:37.660
 session is getting pretty close to you just shouldn't have done the session.

2:37:37.660 --> 2:37:38.660
 It is detrimental.

2:37:38.660 --> 2:37:39.660
 Good to know.

2:37:39.660 --> 2:37:40.660
 I wouldn't do it.

2:37:40.660 --> 2:37:45.560
 I guess is the most blunt way to put it.

2:37:45.560 --> 2:37:53.040
 If you're like, hey, like, I'm not super concerned with growing muscle and I want these other

2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:56.380
 things that come with cold water immersion, fine.

2:37:56.380 --> 2:37:57.380
 It's not a zero.

2:37:57.380 --> 2:37:58.380
 It's not zero.

2:37:58.380 --> 2:37:59.760
 It's not taking you backwards.

2:37:59.760 --> 2:38:00.760
 How much does it cut you down?

2:38:00.760 --> 2:38:01.760
 I don't know.

2:38:01.760 --> 2:38:02.760
 We don't know.

2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:04.420
 Like that'd be a difficult number to come up with.

2:38:04.420 --> 2:38:05.420
 Is it one percent reduction?

2:38:05.420 --> 2:38:07.060
 No, it's more than that.

2:38:07.060 --> 2:38:08.060
 Is it a hundred?

2:38:08.060 --> 2:38:09.060
 Not even close.

2:38:09.060 --> 2:38:10.060
 I don't know where it lands though.

2:38:10.060 --> 2:38:14.060
 It's enough though for me to go, in general, best practices don't get in the ice immediately

2:38:14.060 --> 2:38:15.060
 after a workout.

2:38:15.060 --> 2:38:16.380
 How long should I wait?

2:38:16.380 --> 2:38:20.820
 Well, in theory, the best answer we could give you would be four hours because of what

2:38:20.820 --> 2:38:24.840
 we talked about earlier today of going, okay, immediately you've got this signaling cascade

2:38:24.840 --> 2:38:25.980
 that takes seconds.

2:38:25.980 --> 2:38:28.980
 You've got gene expression that's happening in this rough four hour window.

2:38:28.980 --> 2:38:33.340
 After the genes have gone off and now you're just going through the protein synthesis process,

2:38:33.340 --> 2:38:35.460
 the signal is already there and it's gone back down to baseline.

2:38:35.460 --> 2:38:40.600
 So then reintroducing or introducing cold here is not going to disrupt that signal.

2:38:40.600 --> 2:38:46.940
 That's a very non-scientifically founded because we don't know at this point at all.

2:38:46.940 --> 2:38:51.220
 What is very clear though is if you get off your workout goal right into the ice, it's

2:38:51.220 --> 2:38:54.020
 probably 10% attenuation of growth.

2:38:54.020 --> 2:38:55.020
 I don't know.

2:38:55.020 --> 2:38:56.020
 Maybe more depends on the person.

2:38:56.020 --> 2:38:58.240
 Some people, if you look at the individual data, it's pretty bad.

2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:00.820
 It's enough to where it's like that's a really big deal.

2:39:00.820 --> 2:39:05.880
 The benefits of the ice, I don't think now outweigh the benefits of hypertrophy training.

2:39:05.880 --> 2:39:07.580
 What about cold showers?

2:39:07.580 --> 2:39:10.620
 I don't think cold showers are going to do much.

2:39:10.620 --> 2:39:13.820
 If you've been in both, you know that this is like, we're not playing the same game here.

2:39:13.820 --> 2:39:14.820
 Right.

2:39:14.820 --> 2:39:19.020
 An ice bath or a cold water, a true cold water immersion up to the neck with limbs in for

2:39:19.020 --> 2:39:23.860
 one to five minutes is a completely different stimulus than in the cold shower.

2:39:23.860 --> 2:39:29.140
 Especially also compared to a similar like cryo is not even the same, same thing here.

2:39:29.140 --> 2:39:31.540
 So in general, I would say don't do those cold shower.

2:39:31.540 --> 2:39:33.460
 I don't really care.

2:39:33.460 --> 2:39:35.380
 Can you work it out so you don't do them the same time?

2:39:35.380 --> 2:39:36.380
 That would be my hope.

2:39:36.380 --> 2:39:37.380
 Right.

2:39:37.380 --> 2:39:41.840
 I would actually prefer you do the cold before if you really had to do it.

2:39:41.840 --> 2:39:42.840
 Certainly will wake you up.

2:39:42.840 --> 2:39:43.840
 Get that adrenaline burst.

2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:47.560
 No, we've played with that actually years ago doing that.

2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:50.980
 There's actually some fun stuff you can do with the endurance piece with cold stuff,

2:39:50.980 --> 2:39:55.340
 but it's totally not feasible for most people because you get out of, you're getting water

2:39:55.340 --> 2:39:56.340
 everywhere.

2:39:56.340 --> 2:39:57.340
 They're going to jump on your bike and just get shit.

2:39:57.340 --> 2:39:58.820
 And it's just a giant mess.

2:39:58.820 --> 2:39:59.820
 It's fun.

2:39:59.820 --> 2:40:02.120
 But yeah, I would say walk away from it if you can.

2:40:02.120 --> 2:40:05.660
 That's actually where I stand based on the data.

2:40:05.660 --> 2:40:08.560
 Based on my intuition and experience, I don't think it's a good thing to do.

2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:13.860
 Now having said that, that's mostly concerned with maximizing hypertrophy.

2:40:13.860 --> 2:40:15.880
 Strength is not as clear.

2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:18.900
 There are some data to show it actual block strength adaptations, but because of what

2:40:18.900 --> 2:40:22.700
 we talked about earlier, the mechanisms and the drivers are different.

2:40:22.700 --> 2:40:27.520
 And so I don't think it's as big a concern for strength development, though I would still

2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:30.980
 generally say if you can get away with staying out of the ice immediately after the workout

2:40:30.980 --> 2:40:34.340
 and you can at least wait a few hours, that's the better approach.

2:40:34.340 --> 2:40:37.980
 Less concerned with strength, more concerned with hypertrophy in terms of interference

2:40:37.980 --> 2:40:38.980
 effect.

2:40:38.980 --> 2:40:43.660
 If you can do it on off days or before or any other time, that's the place to land.

2:40:43.660 --> 2:40:45.180
 That's generally when I try to do it.

2:40:45.180 --> 2:40:48.600
 I'm just kind of throwing out an extreme case because I get asked that question a lot.

2:40:48.600 --> 2:40:54.220
 What about the use of ice bath or cold water immersion or cold shower after endurance training?

2:40:54.220 --> 2:40:56.580
 Okay, so a couple of interesting things here.

2:40:56.580 --> 2:41:02.540
 You mentioned we don't have a tremendous amount of data on cold water immersion overall.

2:41:02.540 --> 2:41:06.140
 So a lot of this is moving.

2:41:06.140 --> 2:41:09.900
 There have been some papers to show that cold water immersion can actually enhance mitochondrial

2:41:09.900 --> 2:41:11.060
 biogenesis.

2:41:11.060 --> 2:41:15.140
 And actually even for endurance stuff, it's been shown to cause improvement in endurance

2:41:15.140 --> 2:41:19.060
 adaptations relative to not.

2:41:19.060 --> 2:41:21.460
 It's not enough for me to be truly confident in that statement yet.

2:41:21.460 --> 2:41:23.340
 I would like to see that repeated.

2:41:23.340 --> 2:41:26.460
 Not that I have a problem with the paper or the methodology that they use in that particular

2:41:26.460 --> 2:41:30.680
 study, but this is a weird thing.

2:41:30.680 --> 2:41:32.040
 So I want to see this repeated more often.

2:41:32.040 --> 2:41:36.460
 So I have less concern with doing it immediately post endurance because you could even argue

2:41:36.460 --> 2:41:37.860
 that there may be some benefit.

2:41:37.860 --> 2:41:41.500
 I don't think you need to go out of your way to try to make sure you get into ice immediately

2:41:41.500 --> 2:41:45.360
 afterwards and thinking you're going to get some massive adaptation.

2:41:45.360 --> 2:41:49.540
 We use ice a decent amount when I can get athletes to do it.

2:41:49.540 --> 2:41:51.060
 But this context is different.

2:41:51.060 --> 2:41:55.020
 Number one, when we're in camp and we've got a world title fight coming up or something

2:41:55.020 --> 2:41:58.540
 else, we've just pitched in a major baseball game.

2:41:58.540 --> 2:42:00.920
 I am not concerned about hypertrophy.

2:42:00.920 --> 2:42:02.380
 I'm not even concerned with strength development.

2:42:02.380 --> 2:42:04.320
 I am now pushing towards recovery.

2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:07.460
 There's a paradigm that I think is important with all of these things to understand, which

2:42:07.460 --> 2:42:11.860
 is, are you pushing for optimization or adaptation?

2:42:11.860 --> 2:42:15.880
 When you're pushing for adaptation, you don't want to block the signal for adaptation.

2:42:15.880 --> 2:42:20.260
 This means less recovery, you're not going to feel as good, and you probably should be

2:42:20.260 --> 2:42:22.120
 hedging towards stress.

2:42:22.120 --> 2:42:24.860
 When you're pushing for optimization, it's the opposite.

2:42:24.860 --> 2:42:30.420
 So if I'm in season and I had a pitcher just throw 125 pitches, I'm not trying to cause

2:42:30.420 --> 2:42:31.420
 adaptation.

2:42:31.420 --> 2:42:33.820
 I'm trying to recover as quickly as possible because four days from now, we've got to do

2:42:33.820 --> 2:42:34.820
 this again.

2:42:34.820 --> 2:42:37.900
 And I've got to do this across 162 games.

2:42:37.900 --> 2:42:41.460
 You're going to play five days in a PGA golf tournament and you're going to have to do

2:42:41.460 --> 2:42:44.660
 it again every week for a bunch of weeks in a row.

2:42:44.660 --> 2:42:47.380
 I need recovery as fast as I possibly can.

2:42:47.380 --> 2:42:48.900
 So if I'm blunting adaptation, fine.

2:42:48.900 --> 2:42:49.900
 I'm not actually trying to do that.

2:42:49.900 --> 2:42:51.620
 I'm trying to optimize.

2:42:51.620 --> 2:42:55.060
 If you spend all of your time in one of those two areas, you're going to have problems.

2:42:55.060 --> 2:43:00.240
 So you need to be judicious about thinking, is this a point in my life or training cycle

2:43:00.240 --> 2:43:04.700
 that I want to cause adaptations or am I trying to optimize?

2:43:04.700 --> 2:43:07.920
 You spend too much time in one of the other ones, again, you're going to have problems.

2:43:07.920 --> 2:43:13.100
 So that's generally how I will treat the ice for all those adaptations.

2:43:13.100 --> 2:43:15.300
 What about heat?

2:43:15.300 --> 2:43:16.300
 Yeah.

2:43:16.300 --> 2:43:20.660
 When, and I'll frame this question differently because I'm sure there are a number of ways

2:43:20.660 --> 2:43:23.060
 in which heat can short circuit all sorts of things.

2:43:23.060 --> 2:43:26.900
 I mean, heat in excess can kill you.

2:43:26.900 --> 2:43:30.860
 It can shut down fertility, it can in excess, right?

2:43:30.860 --> 2:43:36.620
 It can do all sorts of things, but it can also increase growth hormone, increase vasodilation,

2:43:36.620 --> 2:43:40.740
 improve one's ability to sweat, which can be very beneficial in a number of contexts.

2:43:40.740 --> 2:43:47.800
 For the typical, for 75% of people, 75% of the time, when do you think heat is most useful?

2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:50.340
 And here I'm referring to dry sauna or wet sauna.

2:43:50.340 --> 2:43:53.780
 I'm not specifically talking about infrared sauna because the data there are a little

2:43:53.780 --> 2:43:54.820
 unclear to me.

2:43:54.820 --> 2:43:59.340
 And I don't even know that my sense with infrared saunas is they don't go hot enough for my

2:43:59.340 --> 2:44:00.340
 particular taste.

2:44:00.340 --> 2:44:01.580
 You and I have a similar taste there.

2:44:01.580 --> 2:44:02.580
 Okay.

2:44:02.580 --> 2:44:04.140
 We're not crushing 200 past, I'm not interested.

2:44:04.140 --> 2:44:05.140
 Right.

2:44:05.140 --> 2:44:09.740
 And my sense about infrared sauna is that maybe I haven't seen the data is that, but

2:44:09.740 --> 2:44:13.860
 that a lot of people like it because they like the way they look in the infrared sauna.

2:44:13.860 --> 2:44:14.860
 It feels cool.

2:44:14.860 --> 2:44:15.940
 It feels like you're doing something unusual.

2:44:15.940 --> 2:44:20.420
 Now infrared lights are beneficial for other reasons, actually for mitochondrial health

2:44:20.420 --> 2:44:25.520
 and the retinas, the good data, but infrared sauna to me, they never goes hot enough.

2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:31.500
 So I'm talking about 200 or hotter, maybe 180 to 220, obviously do what safe folks and

2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:34.420
 heat all the warnings about pregnant people not going in saunas, et cetera.

2:44:34.420 --> 2:44:36.620
 I assume you're lumping in hot water immersion.

2:44:36.620 --> 2:44:37.620
 Hot water immersion.

2:44:37.620 --> 2:44:40.180
 So hot baths, hot sauna.

2:44:40.180 --> 2:44:46.020
 When would you like, when do you think most people could leverage sauna or hot baths to

2:44:46.020 --> 2:44:48.260
 benefit their training and fitness and health?

2:44:48.260 --> 2:44:49.260
 Yeah.

2:44:49.260 --> 2:44:50.260
 Okay.

2:44:50.260 --> 2:44:51.260
 I have a handful of things to say about this topic.

2:44:51.260 --> 2:44:54.260
 One of them is you never have a hard time convincing people to get hot.

2:44:54.260 --> 2:44:55.540
 Everyone feels good.

2:44:55.540 --> 2:44:56.540
 Like yeah, get a hot bath.

2:44:56.540 --> 2:44:58.140
 Like, can you take more hot showers?

2:44:58.140 --> 2:44:59.140
 Sure.

2:44:59.140 --> 2:45:00.140
 No problem there.

2:45:00.140 --> 2:45:01.140
 Right.

2:45:01.140 --> 2:45:07.260
 There are a handful of studies that have looked at this immediately post and it seems to even

2:45:07.260 --> 2:45:08.600
 augment hypertrophy.

2:45:08.600 --> 2:45:12.020
 So after hypertrophy training, getting in the sauna for 20 minutes?

2:45:12.020 --> 2:45:13.920
 Yeah, whatever, whatever it needs to be.

2:45:13.920 --> 2:45:15.640
 We don't have a good titration.

2:45:15.640 --> 2:45:17.020
 What's the number minutes wise?

2:45:17.020 --> 2:45:18.820
 We don't have a temperature titration.

2:45:18.820 --> 2:45:23.500
 Hot shower would, would be a second, that would be a week second bath.

2:45:23.500 --> 2:45:24.500
 I would say it's a very week.

2:45:24.500 --> 2:45:25.500
 It's like a hot bath.

2:45:25.500 --> 2:45:29.580
 I think a hot bath is probably a lot closer to what you're looking for.

2:45:29.580 --> 2:45:32.980
 It actually kind of goes back to our initial conversations.

2:45:32.980 --> 2:45:36.740
 Theoretically you're just going to aid in blood flow.

2:45:36.740 --> 2:45:40.940
 So you're going to put more nutrients in, more waste product out, metabolic stress,

2:45:40.940 --> 2:45:41.940
 all that stuff is going through.

2:45:41.940 --> 2:45:44.940
 So that's the thought anyways, far from no ends.

2:45:44.940 --> 2:45:45.940
 Makes sense.

2:45:45.940 --> 2:45:46.940
 Plausible.

2:45:46.940 --> 2:45:47.940
 Right?

2:45:47.940 --> 2:45:48.940
 Absolutely plausible.

2:45:48.940 --> 2:45:49.940
 Something people will do.

2:45:49.940 --> 2:45:50.940
 Feels good.

2:45:50.940 --> 2:45:57.020
 I would say with cold and hot, I want to caution you against a couple of things.

2:45:57.020 --> 2:46:02.260
 This is true across all physiology, but you need to be really careful about moving percentages

2:46:02.260 --> 2:46:05.740
 from molecular to outcome.

2:46:05.740 --> 2:46:06.740
 Be careful.

2:46:06.740 --> 2:46:12.020
 So for example, it's easy to see a paper that says, okay, we put you in a hot bath or something

2:46:12.020 --> 2:46:14.640
 and we saw a growth hormone increase 300%.

2:46:14.640 --> 2:46:20.420
 That is not going to result in 300% increase in muscle size, right?

2:46:20.420 --> 2:46:25.540
 In fact, 300% might result in absolutely no change in physical size, right?

2:46:25.540 --> 2:46:29.300
 So the, and the reason I'm saying this is because there's a lot of people in this space

2:46:29.300 --> 2:46:34.140
 that will misapply the mechanisms and they'll, they'll grossly overestimate what these things

2:46:34.140 --> 2:46:37.380
 can do and what they do do because they'll find something like that.

2:46:37.380 --> 2:46:42.740
 I mean, you know this, you've done enough cellular work to, in the lab, if I see mTOR

2:46:42.740 --> 2:46:46.420
 doubled, I think, shit, it didn't work.

2:46:46.420 --> 2:46:50.020
 I need to see a 10X increase before I know it's even physiologically relevant.

2:46:50.020 --> 2:46:53.620
 So reading that paper, reading someone's social media post, you're like, wow, it increased

2:46:53.620 --> 2:46:54.620
 mTOR 38%.

2:46:54.620 --> 2:46:55.620
 I'm like, well, that didn't work.

2:46:55.620 --> 2:46:56.620
 And you're like, wow, that's huge.

2:46:56.620 --> 2:46:59.540
 I'm like, that's not 38% increase in muscle size.

2:46:59.540 --> 2:47:02.580
 So that's a very important point I want to make because I'm going to talk about the benefits

2:47:02.580 --> 2:47:04.100
 here in a second.

2:47:04.100 --> 2:47:09.060
 But I don't want people to be fooled into thinking that this is some crazy miracle.

2:47:09.060 --> 2:47:11.340
 The same thing with the sauna.

2:47:11.340 --> 2:47:15.780
 In terms of general health outcomes, it is a clearly a beneficial thing.

2:47:15.780 --> 2:47:18.300
 This is a really good idea to get hot a lot.

2:47:18.300 --> 2:47:20.980
 It is not a substitute for exercise though.

2:47:20.980 --> 2:47:22.420
 It's a very important distinction.

2:47:22.420 --> 2:47:29.780
 If the options are nothing or sauna, get in the sauna, really, really good idea.

2:47:29.780 --> 2:47:35.300
 If the exchanges though, I don't need to work out because I did the sauna, bad.

2:47:35.300 --> 2:47:36.740
 This is not a winning solution.

2:47:36.740 --> 2:47:39.980
 You and I know some maniacs that actually work out in the sauna.

2:47:39.980 --> 2:47:40.980
 We do.

2:47:40.980 --> 2:47:41.980
 Yeah.

2:47:41.980 --> 2:47:42.980
 I don't necessarily recommend that.

2:47:42.980 --> 2:47:48.580
 That actually would probably kill a large number of people, but it can be worked up

2:47:48.580 --> 2:47:49.580
 too.

2:47:49.580 --> 2:47:50.580
 Yeah.

2:47:50.580 --> 2:47:51.580
 It certainly.

2:47:51.580 --> 2:47:52.580
 Yeah.

2:47:52.580 --> 2:47:56.620
 So every time I talk about that, I flag that because it's just too easy to hear that and

2:47:56.620 --> 2:47:59.740
 go, oh, well, I think Dr. Huberman said, if I just get in the sauna, I don't have to work

2:47:59.740 --> 2:48:00.740
 out.

2:48:00.740 --> 2:48:01.740
 Like, no, no.

2:48:01.740 --> 2:48:02.740
 Those words have never come out of his mouth.

2:48:02.740 --> 2:48:03.740
 I definitely didn't say that.

2:48:03.740 --> 2:48:04.740
 And I'm definitely not working out in the sauna.

2:48:04.740 --> 2:48:08.220
 If I'm in the sauna, I'm either sitting or I'm lying down and I'm trying to make it through.

2:48:08.220 --> 2:48:12.140
 I tend to do three 20-minute bouts across the entire week.

2:48:12.140 --> 2:48:16.380
 So I aim for 60 minutes per week of heat exposure, which is not a ton.

2:48:16.380 --> 2:48:17.820
 If I said I've never worked out in the sauna.

2:48:17.820 --> 2:48:19.460
 Oh, so you're one of those.

2:48:19.460 --> 2:48:20.460
 Yeah.

2:48:20.460 --> 2:48:21.460
 People will do air squats.

2:48:21.460 --> 2:48:22.980
 They'll bring the air dime bike in there.

2:48:22.980 --> 2:48:25.900
 I look at the sauna as kind of a time to get lazy and sweat.

2:48:25.900 --> 2:48:27.900
 Totally fine.

2:48:27.900 --> 2:48:28.980
 Going back to your general question.

2:48:28.980 --> 2:48:30.500
 So potential to eight plausible aid.

2:48:30.500 --> 2:48:34.080
 We need to see more research on that to really get a, you know, I had to put this in practice.

2:48:34.080 --> 2:48:40.580
 I think if you try it very little harm, I struggle to see a downside if you make sure

2:48:40.580 --> 2:48:41.580
 your hydration is on point, right?

2:48:41.580 --> 2:48:44.040
 Because now you've got to factor in the fact you just kicked out two or three pounds.

2:48:44.040 --> 2:48:49.340
 If you're you at 200 plus pounds, I assume, or roughly if you're in the sauna for 20 minutes,

2:48:49.340 --> 2:48:51.060
 I would imagine you can do two, three pounds.

2:48:51.060 --> 2:48:52.060
 Yeah.

2:48:52.060 --> 2:48:57.100
 Usually I'm, I'm hovering somewhere around like 225 and I drink.

2:48:57.100 --> 2:49:03.340
 I drink a 32 ounce, it's water with a electrolyte solution that's pretty high salt afterwards

2:49:03.340 --> 2:49:04.760
 and sometimes during.

2:49:04.760 --> 2:49:08.180
 And sometimes after that, if I do it late in the evening, I'll go to sleep and I'll

2:49:08.180 --> 2:49:12.180
 wake up in the middle of the night just feeling so parched.

2:49:12.180 --> 2:49:14.460
 It's amazing how much water one loses in the sauna.

2:49:14.460 --> 2:49:19.220
 Like a normal sweat rate for someone 225, especially in 20 minutes in a sauna, I would

2:49:19.220 --> 2:49:24.820
 absolutely expect you to do three pounds easy without like really more probably even more

2:49:24.820 --> 2:49:25.820
 water.

2:49:25.820 --> 2:49:26.820
 Yeah.

2:49:26.820 --> 2:49:27.820
 Yeah.

2:49:27.820 --> 2:49:31.500
 And you mentioned the, the possible benefits of doing it after strength hypertrophy training,

2:49:31.500 --> 2:49:37.980
 which are, makes sense for plausible mechanistic reasons on not no official data there yet.

2:49:37.980 --> 2:49:39.820
 What about after endurance training?

2:49:39.820 --> 2:49:42.540
 Assuming somebody hydrates well enough and they're not overheated from their endurance

2:49:42.540 --> 2:49:43.540
 work.

2:49:43.540 --> 2:49:44.540
 Yep.

2:49:44.540 --> 2:49:45.540
 Could also be a benefit.

2:49:45.540 --> 2:49:46.540
 Yeah.

2:49:46.540 --> 2:49:47.540
 Wow.

2:49:47.540 --> 2:49:51.260
 So more and more what I'm thinking the framework here is in an ideal world, one would train

2:49:51.260 --> 2:49:56.580
 and then do sauna or heat exposure of some kind, endurance training or strength hypertrophy

2:49:56.580 --> 2:50:02.860
 training and then do sauna and then do cold exposure on off days or at least four hours

2:50:02.860 --> 2:50:05.140
 away from the, from any kind of training.

2:50:05.140 --> 2:50:07.340
 Or if you had to do it close to train, do it before training.

2:50:07.340 --> 2:50:08.340
 Yeah.

2:50:08.340 --> 2:50:09.340
 I love cold in the morning.

2:50:09.340 --> 2:50:12.380
 We, we've actually run this experiment on professional athletes where we do enough tracking

2:50:12.380 --> 2:50:17.860
 with things like HRV, which is a global metric of like overall fatigue.

2:50:17.860 --> 2:50:18.860
 Okay.

2:50:18.860 --> 2:50:21.900
 And you've, you've probably talked about that before, but problems with it, but roughly

2:50:21.900 --> 2:50:26.280
 idea of overall fatigue, HRV in general, higher the score, the better, right?

2:50:26.280 --> 2:50:29.260
 So low HRV is fatigue, right?

2:50:29.260 --> 2:50:33.340
 Well, if you wake up and take your HRV in the morning and then you get into ice, what's

2:50:33.340 --> 2:50:35.700
 going to happen is you're going to see that number plummet.

2:50:35.700 --> 2:50:38.860
 The second you get out, that's going to fall off the earth, which means roughly you've

2:50:38.860 --> 2:50:41.700
 moved into a sympathetic place.

2:50:41.700 --> 2:50:44.800
 Surprising.

2:50:44.800 --> 2:50:48.460
 You get in 30 degree water, you're going to go very sympathetic very quickly.

2:50:48.460 --> 2:50:53.580
 However, if you continue to watch your HRV for 30, 60, 90, and up to two to three hours

2:50:53.580 --> 2:50:59.480
 post, you will generally see an improved HRV score relative to where you started.

2:50:59.480 --> 2:51:02.620
 So it's, it's back to this hormetic stressor, right?

2:51:02.620 --> 2:51:07.980
 A really cold, shocking exposure will be a net result of you being more relaxed throughout

2:51:07.980 --> 2:51:10.040
 the day in general.

2:51:10.040 --> 2:51:14.320
 And we've seen that now, like very consistently across years with, with athletes.

2:51:14.320 --> 2:51:17.680
 So I think it's a great way to start your day.

2:51:17.680 --> 2:51:22.380
 You won't need nearly as much coffee after spending three minutes in 30 degree water.

2:51:22.380 --> 2:51:24.580
 30 degrees is pretty, pretty darn cold.

2:51:24.580 --> 2:51:28.220
 I was in the ocean this morning for about three minutes and it felt, I didn't bring

2:51:28.220 --> 2:51:33.140
 a thermometer, but it felt like somewhere in the low fifties, but 15 moving is really

2:51:33.140 --> 2:51:34.140
 cold.

2:51:34.140 --> 2:51:35.140
 Yeah.

2:51:35.140 --> 2:51:36.140
 Water's moving.

2:51:36.140 --> 2:51:37.140
 Yeah.

2:51:37.140 --> 2:51:38.140
 That's really cool.

2:51:38.140 --> 2:51:39.140
 That's right.

2:51:39.140 --> 2:51:41.620
 The thermal layer that, that surrounds you when you sit still in a cold water immersion,

2:51:41.620 --> 2:51:45.500
 I'm encouraging people now, if they really, I was a joke that, you know, people like to

2:51:45.500 --> 2:51:47.260
 look real stoic and tough when they're in there.

2:51:47.260 --> 2:51:49.020
 Like they're just grinding through it with no pain at all.

2:51:49.020 --> 2:51:52.780
 But the stillness is actually reducing the stimulus.

2:51:52.780 --> 2:51:55.280
 If they sift around a little bit, you break up that thermal layer.

2:51:55.280 --> 2:51:56.440
 That's where the real action is.

2:51:56.440 --> 2:51:58.060
 We've joked about this for years.

2:51:58.060 --> 2:52:01.260
 Like do 50 degrees with a whirlpool jet on.

2:52:01.260 --> 2:52:03.620
 Now I'm impressed because that is hard.

2:52:03.620 --> 2:52:06.780
 You sit in 35 degree for three minutes, I guess.

2:52:06.780 --> 2:52:10.580
 But with XBT, I've seen, I can't even tell you how many hundreds of people from all walks

2:52:10.580 --> 2:52:16.700
 of life on all age that we've been able to get in 30 some degree water for three minutes.

2:52:16.700 --> 2:52:19.420
 50 degrees with a whirlpool going.

2:52:19.420 --> 2:52:20.420
 That number gets very small.

2:52:20.420 --> 2:52:21.420
 Yeah.

2:52:21.420 --> 2:52:23.900
 And if you don't have access to a whirlpool, this is, this should be reassuring to you.

2:52:23.900 --> 2:52:27.060
 You can, some people say, Oh, you know, I don't have access to ice and ice can actually

2:52:27.060 --> 2:52:28.060
 get pretty expensive.

2:52:28.060 --> 2:52:29.600
 You're doing a $50 ice bath every day.

2:52:29.600 --> 2:52:33.720
 So you can fill your bathtub with cool to cold water.

2:52:33.720 --> 2:52:37.780
 Get in, but just make sure that you keep sifting your limbs and it's chilly.

2:52:37.780 --> 2:52:42.540
 And this, the studies on the very well established, now well established increases in dopamine

2:52:42.540 --> 2:52:44.420
 and epinephrine that occur in cold water exposure.

2:52:44.420 --> 2:52:48.460
 They're actually done at an hour in 60 degrees Fahrenheit.

2:52:48.460 --> 2:52:53.060
 And so it, you don't necessarily need an ice cold or an ice bath, but immersion is really

2:52:53.060 --> 2:52:54.140
 better than the cold shower.

2:52:54.140 --> 2:52:58.980
 The cold shower is kind of a, it's the, it's, it's kind of the espresso shot version.

2:52:58.980 --> 2:52:59.980
 Yep.

2:52:59.980 --> 2:53:00.980
 Yep.

2:53:00.980 --> 2:53:03.860
 You know, that's a, it's sort of funny cause if you look at most of those initial studies

2:53:03.860 --> 2:53:10.700
 and you think, man, how did they get people to sign up to spend 45 minutes in 55 degree

2:53:10.700 --> 2:53:11.700
 water?

2:53:11.700 --> 2:53:14.280
 55 degrees is cold, even if it's not moving and then they're going to not spend five minutes

2:53:14.280 --> 2:53:15.820
 in them, they're going to go an hour.

2:53:15.820 --> 2:53:19.500
 If you've ever done ice baths at that temperature, you know, like, all right, after a few minutes,

2:53:19.500 --> 2:53:21.940
 it's not that bad, but man, that's a protocol.

2:53:21.940 --> 2:53:22.940
 Yeah.

2:53:22.940 --> 2:53:26.380
 It's just, it's kind of a cold endurance protocol because it's one thing to get in for one minute

2:53:26.380 --> 2:53:29.480
 to three minutes and you know, you're getting out, you could sing a song, you could do anything

2:53:29.480 --> 2:53:34.080
 to distract yourself, but 45 minutes to an hour is, is intense.

2:53:34.080 --> 2:53:37.340
 Maybe they, I don't know, I don't think they paid the subjects, but anyway, that, that

2:53:37.340 --> 2:53:38.740
 study was done in Europe.

2:53:38.740 --> 2:53:44.780
 I forget where it was done, but anyway, they were, they were hardy subjects.

2:53:44.780 --> 2:53:48.740
 I want to talk a bit about over-training and gauging recovery.

2:53:48.740 --> 2:53:56.280
 So there are a couple of methods that I've heard about and that I use based on some data

2:53:56.280 --> 2:53:59.660
 that I've seen, but mainly discussions with really informed people like yourself, Brian

2:53:59.660 --> 2:54:03.600
 McKenzie, Kelly Starrett and others.

2:54:03.600 --> 2:54:08.700
 The two that I'm aware of for gauging recovery of the nervous system and kind of systemic

2:54:08.700 --> 2:54:16.420
 recovery are grip strength, especially grip strength on waking in the morning and the

2:54:16.420 --> 2:54:18.380
 so-called carbon dioxide tolerance test.

2:54:18.380 --> 2:54:24.420
 The ability to do a long controlled exhale after a few rhythmic deep breaths, just which

2:54:24.420 --> 2:54:30.440
 I'm assuming taps into both one's ability to mechanically control the diaphragm, but

2:54:30.440 --> 2:54:33.860
 also how well one is regulating carbon dioxide.

2:54:33.860 --> 2:54:42.060
 First question is, is this stuff fiction, fact, or a combination of kind of anec data

2:54:42.060 --> 2:54:43.300
 as I call it?

2:54:43.300 --> 2:54:45.140
 Are there any peer reviewed published data?

2:54:45.140 --> 2:54:49.940
 Is your lab working on these things and am I deluding myself using these tools or are

2:54:49.940 --> 2:54:51.740
 they useful?

2:54:51.740 --> 2:54:53.420
 It's not fiction at all.

2:54:53.420 --> 2:54:57.620
 There are, with like CO2 tolerance, there's less published data.

2:54:57.620 --> 2:55:03.280
 We've run a study in our lab looking at the associations between the CO2 tolerance and

2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:06.080
 what we call trait and state anxiety.

2:55:06.080 --> 2:55:10.100
 And those are in the publication process is what I'll say.

2:55:10.100 --> 2:55:13.140
 So you can't really talk about that stuff as you know until it's out.

2:55:13.140 --> 2:55:17.060
 But in general, I'd say like, there's a reason I'm still doing it.

2:55:17.060 --> 2:55:18.060
 I'll just leave it at that.

2:55:18.060 --> 2:55:19.060
 Yeah.

2:55:19.060 --> 2:55:20.060
 Well, assuming it's not a clinical trial.

2:55:20.060 --> 2:55:24.060
 I mean, I think sharing preliminary findings is fine as long as we highlight them as preliminary.

2:55:24.060 --> 2:55:26.740
 I'm not a reviewer, but I look forward to reading the paper.

2:55:26.740 --> 2:55:27.740
 Yeah.

2:55:27.740 --> 2:55:31.400
 But as you know, scientific, ethically, like you need to be careful about telling people

2:55:31.400 --> 2:55:32.820
 results before you've gone through that process.

2:55:32.820 --> 2:55:33.820
 Right.

2:55:33.820 --> 2:55:37.900
 Which is why I'm flagging this as these results are not yet passed through the peer review

2:55:37.900 --> 2:55:38.900
 process.

2:55:38.900 --> 2:55:40.780
 So you're hearing about it prior to peer review.

2:55:40.780 --> 2:55:41.780
 Yep.

2:55:41.780 --> 2:55:44.260
 Having said that, there's enough in that field.

2:55:44.260 --> 2:55:45.920
 I'm not the first one into that field.

2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:49.060
 And so I'm very confident that that's a real thing.

2:55:49.060 --> 2:55:53.700
 In terms of actual tracking recovery, the big picture is this.

2:55:53.700 --> 2:55:58.460
 When we run through a full analysis, when we have an athlete go through a biomolecular

2:55:58.460 --> 2:56:01.940
 athlete program, we're going to run and we're going to look at three major categories.

2:56:01.940 --> 2:56:02.940
 Okay.

2:56:02.940 --> 2:56:07.140
 Category one are what we call visible stressors, and then we have hidden stressors, and then

2:56:07.140 --> 2:56:10.020
 we have recovery capacity.

2:56:10.020 --> 2:56:17.660
 Any time the total stress load outpaces recovery capacity, you're either going backwards in

2:56:17.660 --> 2:56:21.220
 your physical ability or you're reducing adaptability.

2:56:21.220 --> 2:56:23.080
 Now you have levers to pull here.

2:56:23.080 --> 2:56:26.940
 You can reduce stress intake or you can increase recovery capacity.

2:56:26.940 --> 2:56:28.020
 Right.

2:56:28.020 --> 2:56:32.780
 What we want in an ideal situation is to be able to implement the most stress possible,

2:56:32.780 --> 2:56:35.940
 because that's the driver of adaptation, recover from that.

2:56:35.940 --> 2:56:39.540
 Now we get the most adaptation, and adaptation being simply a change, whatever change you

2:56:39.540 --> 2:56:40.540
 want it to be.

2:56:40.540 --> 2:56:41.540
 That's our gold standard.

2:56:41.540 --> 2:56:42.540
 Right.

2:56:42.540 --> 2:56:43.540
 It's pie in the eye.

2:56:43.540 --> 2:56:44.540
 Some people have endogenous differences.

2:56:44.540 --> 2:56:45.540
 They just recover better.

2:56:45.540 --> 2:56:46.540
 They don't.

2:56:46.540 --> 2:56:47.540
 There are genetic factors.

2:56:47.540 --> 2:56:50.180
 But let's talk about the ones that are manipulatable.

2:56:50.180 --> 2:56:54.620
 If we go to the stress side of it, you want the throttle to be pushed as far down on the

2:56:54.620 --> 2:56:58.960
 ones you want stress from and as far off of the ones you don't want stress, so that the

2:56:58.960 --> 2:57:03.300
 adaptation comes in the exact area you want, and you're not burning gas in something you

2:57:03.300 --> 2:57:08.740
 don't care about, because you're taking that total stress bucket too high.

2:57:08.740 --> 2:57:09.900
 Recovery capacity over there.

2:57:09.900 --> 2:57:10.940
 So here's how you can do that.

2:57:10.940 --> 2:57:15.200
 You can run some analytics and measure what we do with everyone through these very comprehensive

2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:19.800
 breakdowns to figure out what's that physiology look like hidden and visible, and then what's

2:57:19.800 --> 2:57:21.300
 the recovery capacity.

2:57:21.300 --> 2:57:25.100
 Once we have that blueprint, we can now figure out what are the two or three things we need

2:57:25.100 --> 2:57:30.380
 to track that are these indicators of what we call performance anchors.

2:57:30.380 --> 2:57:36.120
 So an anchor is something that kind of drags behind you or below you that slows you down.

2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:39.980
 The analogy being, let's say we're going down one of these amazing canyon roads, and I won't

2:57:39.980 --> 2:57:45.380
 say which canyon we're in so you can stay hidden here, and your car is going down at

2:57:45.380 --> 2:57:48.220
 a certain velocity and you want to go faster.

2:57:48.220 --> 2:57:52.700
 Most people's first impulse is to hit the gas, the accelerator.

2:57:52.700 --> 2:57:53.700
 We want to push.

2:57:53.700 --> 2:57:57.940
 Well, that's fine, but if your foot is on the brake and you push the accelerator, you

2:57:57.940 --> 2:58:02.380
 might go a little bit faster, but number one, you're wasting a lot of literal gas to go

2:58:02.380 --> 2:58:05.620
 a little bit faster, and two, you're burning your engine.

2:58:05.620 --> 2:58:07.380
 You might, you're going to blow.

2:58:07.380 --> 2:58:10.660
 The easier solution is just take your foot off the brake.

2:58:10.660 --> 2:58:13.380
 You're going to go faster by just stopping yourself.

2:58:13.380 --> 2:58:16.320
 Then if that's not fast enough, we can hit the accelerator.

2:58:16.320 --> 2:58:18.820
 Everyone wants to just push down, right?

2:58:18.820 --> 2:58:21.420
 More stimulants, more optimization, bing, bing, bing, bing here.

2:58:21.420 --> 2:58:25.260
 Our first analytics are where are these performance anchors?

2:58:25.260 --> 2:58:27.380
 What's dragging you back?

2:58:27.380 --> 2:58:29.220
 What's putting down the brake?

2:58:29.220 --> 2:58:32.060
 I want to move those two or three things out of the way, and now let's see how far you

2:58:32.060 --> 2:58:33.060
 get.

2:58:33.060 --> 2:58:34.140
 Oh, look at that.

2:58:34.140 --> 2:58:36.500
 Your recovery capacity has gone way up.

2:58:36.500 --> 2:58:40.620
 Your adaptations are happening faster now, or we can do more work because you're recovering

2:58:40.620 --> 2:58:41.620
 quicker.

2:58:41.620 --> 2:58:44.260
 So we're trying to figure out in those buckets, and we have a whole host of things that we

2:58:44.260 --> 2:58:49.540
 can measure, biomarkers and surveys and everything else that we go through to find out what's

2:58:49.540 --> 2:58:50.540
 there.

2:58:50.540 --> 2:58:53.980
 So after we've done that, now we're just going to track a few of these recovery markers along

2:58:53.980 --> 2:58:56.420
 the way to figure out what's globally happening.

2:58:56.420 --> 2:58:58.980
 So that could mean grip strength.

2:58:58.980 --> 2:59:01.380
 I have some folks who are going to test grip strength daily.

2:59:01.380 --> 2:59:04.240
 Others, we're going to look at HRV or combinations.

2:59:04.240 --> 2:59:08.040
 We may look at performance metrics like a force plate, so you're going to do a vertical

2:59:08.040 --> 2:59:10.780
 jump every single day, and we're going to see where that's at.

2:59:10.780 --> 2:59:14.740
 We've used the tap test before, which is how many times you can tap your finger as fast

2:59:14.740 --> 2:59:16.100
 as possible.

2:59:16.100 --> 2:59:18.860
 It's a rough indicator of central nervous system.

2:59:18.860 --> 2:59:20.660
 In say one minute or exactly.

2:59:20.660 --> 2:59:21.900
 And there's just apps you can do on this.

2:59:21.900 --> 2:59:24.780
 Like you tap his fingers as fast as you can, and it's going to say, hey, you did 60 taps

2:59:24.780 --> 2:59:26.780
 today and your average is 75.

2:59:26.780 --> 2:59:33.500
 I like that because it taps into, no pun intended, into upper motor neuron capacity because a

2:59:33.500 --> 2:59:36.580
 lot of things like grip strength, obviously I have to send the deliberate signal to my

2:59:36.580 --> 2:59:39.760
 hand to grip, but at some point the lower motor neurons are going to be taking over

2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:40.780
 the majority of the work.

2:59:40.780 --> 2:59:48.260
 The signal is probably one and done, whereas the tapping is going to be a repetitive sending

2:59:48.260 --> 2:59:49.780
 of signals from upper motor neurons.

2:59:49.780 --> 2:59:50.780
 Yep.

2:59:50.780 --> 2:59:54.000
 So some of the athletes I work with, we track blood every day.

2:59:54.000 --> 2:59:55.120
 We track urine every day.

2:59:55.120 --> 2:59:59.380
 We track ideally a combination of subjective and objective measures.

2:59:59.380 --> 3:00:04.100
 Everything from how did you feel last night to environmental sensors of their bedroom,

3:00:04.100 --> 3:00:09.340
 full PSGs going on, running like actual sleep diagnostics, not or ring, nothing against

3:00:09.340 --> 3:00:13.000
 the floor, but like full analytics and some of them, it's as simple as how'd you feel

3:00:13.000 --> 3:00:15.940
 today and what was your vertical jump, right?

3:00:15.940 --> 3:00:18.500
 So we're going to put people in a position to succeed and we're going to figure out what's

3:00:18.500 --> 3:00:21.500
 the lever that they need to pull as well as what's their aptitude.

3:00:21.500 --> 3:00:22.500
 What sport are they in?

3:00:22.500 --> 3:00:23.980
 What can we realistically get away with?

3:00:23.980 --> 3:00:28.260
 And some of them will take machines with them and we'll do blood every day and urine and

3:00:28.260 --> 3:00:29.260
 all kinds of stuff.

3:00:29.260 --> 3:00:31.340
 And some of them, it's a lot lower.

3:00:31.340 --> 3:00:35.340
 For myself, I'm not, as I mentioned before, I'm not a big fan of devices.

3:00:35.340 --> 3:00:41.880
 I'm trying to wear the wristwatch, I tend to go off feel, which is not, it's not the

3:00:41.880 --> 3:00:44.140
 ideal objective way to gauge things.

3:00:44.140 --> 3:00:51.420
 But part of my reasoning for this is my colleague from the psychology department, Dr. Alia Crum,

3:00:51.420 --> 3:00:55.600
 has done some studies where they've given people, deliberately given people false feedback

3:00:55.600 --> 3:00:56.720
 about their sleep.

3:00:56.720 --> 3:01:00.540
 So told people you didn't sleep very well, or they've told people you slept really well

3:01:00.540 --> 3:01:05.820
 and performance can be driven in the expected direction based on feedback, independent of

3:01:05.820 --> 3:01:07.820
 how well people slept or didn't sleep.

3:01:07.820 --> 3:01:11.340
 Now that doesn't mean you can take someone that only slept two hours or was up every

3:01:11.340 --> 3:01:14.700
 30 seconds because of apnea and tell them they slept great and they're going to perform

3:01:14.700 --> 3:01:16.140
 great cognitive tasks.

3:01:16.140 --> 3:01:20.140
 But you can take someone who slept very well, tell them that their recovery quotient wasn't

3:01:20.140 --> 3:01:22.860
 very good and their output is going to be worse.

3:01:22.860 --> 3:01:26.980
 And that's my concern about a lot of devices out there, not to name specific devices, but

3:01:26.980 --> 3:01:33.220
 it's still unclear to the general public what the specific algorithms are to generate these

3:01:33.220 --> 3:01:35.100
 recovery scores, right?

3:01:35.100 --> 3:01:40.820
 And so many of the things that reportedly track sleep aren't tracking sleep, they're

3:01:40.820 --> 3:01:45.060
 tracking heart rate and breathing, which are correlates of sleep depth, but that's different.

3:01:45.060 --> 3:01:46.240
 And again, I'm not knocking those.

3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:50.500
 I think the sleep trackers, if nothing else, have provided a forum whereby people are very

3:01:50.500 --> 3:01:52.660
 conscious of getting good sleep.

3:01:52.660 --> 3:01:56.780
 It's sort of like knowing the total caloric intake of your food, people go, wow, I'm actually

3:01:56.780 --> 3:02:01.620
 eating a lot more than I thought or less in some cases, but often the case is that it's

3:02:01.620 --> 3:02:02.620
 more.

3:02:02.620 --> 3:02:07.380
 So I think for the typical person, I'm wondering whether or not like myself, because I'm not

3:02:07.380 --> 3:02:13.700
 a competitive athlete or certainly not a professional athlete competitive with myself, I suppose,

3:02:13.700 --> 3:02:16.300
 but no one else.

3:02:16.300 --> 3:02:19.060
 Morning pulse rate, I tend to take when I'm waking.

3:02:19.060 --> 3:02:22.240
 If I wake out of a really stressful dream, I might relax a little bit and then just take

3:02:22.240 --> 3:02:25.940
 my pulse rate, kind of get a range and see if it's spiking for whatever reason.

3:02:25.940 --> 3:02:30.420
 I don't tend to measure grip strength, although I've heard you can just use a classic scale,

3:02:30.420 --> 3:02:35.260
 old fashioned scale with the Neil now old fashioned or some other more technical devices,

3:02:35.260 --> 3:02:39.980
 probably good if there's a low cost one and then the carbon dioxide tolerance test.

3:02:39.980 --> 3:02:43.000
 So we haven't really talked about that in specific ways.

3:02:43.000 --> 3:02:47.820
 My understanding of it is it's four deep, slow breaths in through the nose, out through

3:02:47.820 --> 3:02:53.380
 the nose, and then a big inhale as max exhale and then time duration of exhale through the

3:02:53.380 --> 3:02:58.140
 nose and then stopping the stopwatch at the point where lungs are empty.

3:02:58.140 --> 3:03:00.560
 Not necessarily as long as one could hold their breath.

3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:01.560
 Did I get that right?

3:03:01.560 --> 3:03:02.560
 Pretty much.

3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:03.560
 Okay.

3:03:03.560 --> 3:03:04.980
 And I guess we should credit you and Brian McKenzie.

3:03:04.980 --> 3:03:06.300
 Yeah, those guys.

3:03:06.300 --> 3:03:07.300
 Yeah.

3:03:07.300 --> 3:03:14.980
 And the folks under Brian's umbrella for really establishing this as a really good metric.

3:03:14.980 --> 3:03:20.580
 When and how can I use the carbon dioxide tolerance test to gauge recovery?

3:03:20.580 --> 3:03:24.980
 When waking, post training session?

3:03:24.980 --> 3:03:25.980
 Yeah.

3:03:25.980 --> 3:03:26.980
 Would that be a good time?

3:03:26.980 --> 3:03:30.040
 Number one answer is whatever you do, do be consistent.

3:03:30.040 --> 3:03:34.160
 So do it under like any good science experiment, do it under the exact same conditions as you

3:03:34.160 --> 3:03:35.160
 can.

3:03:35.160 --> 3:03:38.060
 That generally means somewhere in the morning because that's when you're probably going

3:03:38.060 --> 3:03:41.060
 to have the most control, most stability going.

3:03:41.060 --> 3:03:49.140
 So yeah, like you would take any HRV or other metric, wake up, get under control, get stabilized,

3:03:49.140 --> 3:03:50.140
 take your metric.

3:03:50.140 --> 3:03:51.140
 Got it.

3:03:51.140 --> 3:03:52.140
 Going to be pretty good.

3:03:52.140 --> 3:03:53.540
 Got it.

3:03:53.540 --> 3:03:57.060
 Sodium bicarb baking soda.

3:03:57.060 --> 3:04:02.720
 Rumor has it and data has it that it can actually be a pretty effective training tool.

3:04:02.720 --> 3:04:03.720
 Very effective.

3:04:03.720 --> 3:04:08.740
 Could you explain a little bit of about how it works and how one might explore using sodium

3:04:08.740 --> 3:04:12.060
 bicarb to enhance training output in a couple of different contexts?

3:04:12.060 --> 3:04:13.060
 Yeah.

3:04:13.060 --> 3:04:18.680
 So there's a handful of these ubiquitously effective supplements for performance.

3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:19.780
 Sodium bicarbonate is one of them.

3:04:19.780 --> 3:04:25.420
 It's a very ingenious idea because it's so simple.

3:04:25.420 --> 3:04:31.100
 Effectively, muscle contraction happens because enzymatic function occurs within a fairly

3:04:31.100 --> 3:04:33.100
 specific pH range, right?

3:04:33.100 --> 3:04:35.260
 So if it gets extremely acidic, it doesn't like it.

3:04:35.260 --> 3:04:39.460
 And so whether you're running through aerobic glycolysis or anaerobic or anything else,

3:04:39.460 --> 3:04:43.460
 all of these things require, even ATP hydrolysis requires ATPase.

3:04:43.460 --> 3:04:44.720
 An enzyme has to do.

3:04:44.720 --> 3:04:49.240
 Enzymes don't function well outside of this fairly special range.

3:04:49.240 --> 3:04:54.700
 So what happens is generally fatigue, the sensations of fatigue are actually caused

3:04:54.700 --> 3:04:58.700
 by some signal that, hey, we're starting to run out of pH or we're getting in the wrong

3:04:58.700 --> 3:04:59.700
 range.

3:04:59.700 --> 3:05:03.540
 You're not out of gas usually, you're not too low on oxygen, you're not running low

3:05:03.540 --> 3:05:04.740
 on muscle glycogen yet.

3:05:04.740 --> 3:05:10.300
 You're typically going to see signs or feel signals of fatigue way prior to that, mostly

3:05:10.300 --> 3:05:11.580
 being pH issues.

3:05:11.580 --> 3:05:16.080
 That being said, what if we could regulate pH better?

3:05:16.080 --> 3:05:17.260
 Enter bicarbonate, right?

3:05:17.260 --> 3:05:22.500
 So without going too far into metabolism, effectively what happens is you take an inhale

3:05:22.500 --> 3:05:25.380
 and you're mostly breathing in oxygen, O2.

3:05:25.380 --> 3:05:28.220
 When you exhale, you're breathing out CO2.

3:05:28.220 --> 3:05:31.220
 So the difference is you've gained a carbon somehow.

3:05:31.220 --> 3:05:36.060
 Well, all of your carbohydrates in your body come in the form of long carbon chains.

3:05:36.060 --> 3:05:37.820
 In fact, that's what a carbohydrate means.

3:05:37.820 --> 3:05:40.820
 It is a one carbon molecule that has one water molecule attached to it.

3:05:40.820 --> 3:05:43.020
 It's a carbon that has been hydrated.

3:05:43.020 --> 3:05:47.400
 In the case of like glucose, blood sugar, it's a six carbon molecule.

3:05:47.400 --> 3:05:51.060
 In terms of fat, which are the only two places you're going to get most of your cellular

3:05:51.060 --> 3:05:56.420
 energy, carbohydrates and fat, that is also a big long block and chain of carbons.

3:05:56.420 --> 3:06:02.580
 So whether you're getting your energy from fat or carbohydrate, you're going to split

3:06:02.580 --> 3:06:03.580
 those atoms.

3:06:03.580 --> 3:06:06.740
 So in other words, you've got six carbons attached to each other.

3:06:06.740 --> 3:06:09.140
 In this part of chemistry, it's exergonic.

3:06:09.140 --> 3:06:13.820
 So when you break that carbon bond, so break one of those carbons off from the other, that's

3:06:13.820 --> 3:06:15.140
 going to release energy.

3:06:15.140 --> 3:06:19.640
 Just like if you had a pencil in here and I snapped it, you'd go bang and pop.

3:06:19.640 --> 3:06:23.700
 I broke the bonds that were connecting that graphite to the next piece of graphite and

3:06:23.700 --> 3:06:27.700
 that released energy because I put energy into the system, et cetera.

3:06:27.700 --> 3:06:28.700
 Okay.

3:06:28.700 --> 3:06:32.600
 As a result, though, we've now had, you know, say five or six carbons chained together.

3:06:32.600 --> 3:06:36.980
 We broke one off the end, which is not how it works, but making the point.

3:06:36.980 --> 3:06:39.100
 And now you have one free floating carbon.

3:06:39.100 --> 3:06:44.380
 Use that energy release to then go make ATP, to then go make your muscles contract.

3:06:44.380 --> 3:06:48.160
 But now you've got carbon floating around.

3:06:48.160 --> 3:06:53.540
 You can associate free floating carbon with being at a higher acidic level.

3:06:53.540 --> 3:06:54.540
 It's not going to happen.

3:06:54.540 --> 3:06:56.940
 The only way that you're going to go through this process is if your body says, do we have

3:06:56.940 --> 3:07:00.860
 an oxygen molecule available that we can bind this to immediately?

3:07:00.860 --> 3:07:02.140
 Yes we do.

3:07:02.140 --> 3:07:04.140
 That carbon attaches to that oxygen molecule.

3:07:04.140 --> 3:07:07.020
 You can't just put CO2 in the blood because of what we just talked about.

3:07:07.020 --> 3:07:09.540
 So you're going to bind it through this bicarbonate process.

3:07:09.540 --> 3:07:10.760
 It's going to go through your blood.

3:07:10.760 --> 3:07:11.760
 It's going to go into the lungs.

3:07:11.760 --> 3:07:14.340
 It's going to go back into its carbon dioxide molecule.

3:07:14.340 --> 3:07:18.180
 It's going to trans go through the alveoli into the lungs and you're going to exhale.

3:07:18.180 --> 3:07:22.800
 So you went from carbon to this bicarbonate system, back into carbon, exhale.

3:07:22.800 --> 3:07:25.740
 So inhaled O2 plants go the opposite, by the way.

3:07:25.740 --> 3:07:29.020
 So they're going to breathe in the CO2, they're going to cleave off that carbon, stack those

3:07:29.020 --> 3:07:32.180
 carbons together and that's how they get larger.

3:07:32.180 --> 3:07:36.060
 In your blood, those six carbon chains are called glucose.

3:07:36.060 --> 3:07:38.180
 If we store that in your muscle, we call it glycogen.

3:07:38.180 --> 3:07:42.440
 So we take a bunch of glucose and stack it together in a plant.

3:07:42.440 --> 3:07:44.320
 We call that starch.

3:07:44.320 --> 3:07:45.320
 That's effectively what it is, right?

3:07:45.320 --> 3:07:49.300
 So you took a bunch of carbon from the atmosphere, stuck it all together and that's a starch.

3:07:49.300 --> 3:07:53.460
 If you want to do it in the form of fruit, we take that starch like from the ground,

3:07:53.460 --> 3:07:58.180
 you put it up through the tree, go all the way up to the top, put it into the flower,

3:07:58.180 --> 3:08:02.720
 break it up into these big, huge chunks of starch, into little forms called fructose

3:08:02.720 --> 3:08:04.040
 or glucose.

3:08:04.040 --> 3:08:09.220
 That's why fruit has fructose in it and that's why tubers and stuff have starch in them.

3:08:09.220 --> 3:08:11.900
 Basically starch in an animal is glycogen in us.

3:08:11.900 --> 3:08:12.900
 Okay.

3:08:12.900 --> 3:08:17.300
 All that to say, if that's happening and we know that a byproduct specifically of anaerobic

3:08:17.300 --> 3:08:24.140
 glycolysis, meaning the breakdown of carbohydrates for fuel, typically in a very fast pace with

3:08:24.140 --> 3:08:31.500
 low oxygen availability, the downside of that equation is acid production.

3:08:31.500 --> 3:08:34.780
 We know that that's a problem because I started the conversation off there intentionally.

3:08:34.780 --> 3:08:38.900
 So what if we could reduce the acid buildup and I, you know how pH kind of works?

3:08:38.900 --> 3:08:40.620
 I went and kind of double negatives there, right?

3:08:40.620 --> 3:08:43.500
 You don't want too much acid buildup.

3:08:43.500 --> 3:08:47.900
 Then could we prolong and sustain energy in a more effective pace, especially in this

3:08:47.900 --> 3:08:50.680
 anaerobic interval kind of environment?

3:08:50.680 --> 3:08:54.940
 And again, that's important because in those things, failure is not a result of running

3:08:54.940 --> 3:08:57.100
 out of fuel or oxygen.

3:08:57.100 --> 3:08:59.860
 It's a result of fatigue building up way too quickly.

3:08:59.860 --> 3:09:03.740
 Is that also true for resistance training?

3:09:03.740 --> 3:09:07.260
 There's maybe more of the, the creatine phosphate system.

3:09:07.260 --> 3:09:08.260
 That can be an issue.

3:09:08.260 --> 3:09:09.900
 It could simply be an issue of force production.

3:09:09.900 --> 3:09:10.900
 You just don't have enough force.

3:09:10.900 --> 3:09:12.400
 At least you're not out of energy.

3:09:12.400 --> 3:09:15.620
 You just can't muster enough force.

3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:18.820
 You do enough reps, then it's going to be an issue there.

3:09:18.820 --> 3:09:23.020
 Protein phosphate would be the big winner, depending.

3:09:23.020 --> 3:09:27.260
 So to come back a little bit to the beginning and then I'll, I'm circling this all together

3:09:27.260 --> 3:09:28.260
 intentionally.

3:09:28.260 --> 3:09:29.260
 All right.

3:09:29.260 --> 3:09:35.460
 Well, the way that we produce energy is going to be in two primary categories, anaerobic

3:09:35.460 --> 3:09:36.460
 and aerobic.

3:09:36.460 --> 3:09:39.400
 Aerobic meaning with oxygen, anaerobic meaning without.

3:09:39.400 --> 3:09:43.620
 In terms of muscle contraction, you're pretty much talking about carbohydrates or fat.

3:09:43.620 --> 3:09:48.640
 Now fat is going to be exclusively aerobic, meaning I'm going to use fat from the entire

3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:50.780
 body, roughly equally.

3:09:50.780 --> 3:09:54.700
 So you're doing a sprint up a hill and your hamstrings or your glutes or your quads are

3:09:54.700 --> 3:09:55.780
 on fire.

3:09:55.780 --> 3:09:59.340
 You can't, you're not just going to use the fat that's directly in those hamstrings.

3:09:59.340 --> 3:10:01.260
 You're going to lose it from the entire body.

3:10:01.260 --> 3:10:04.780
 It has to go through lipolysis, so it's in this stored form in adipose tissue.

3:10:04.780 --> 3:10:07.000
 It's got to get broken down, put into blood.

3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:10.000
 Blood's going to have to go through your body, get taken up in a muscle, taken up through

3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:11.000
 muscle into the mitochondria.

3:10:11.000 --> 3:10:15.460
 Then we're going to have to go through this process called beta oxidation.

3:10:15.460 --> 3:10:21.020
 So remember, carbohydrates and glucose especially is a six carbon molecule.

3:10:21.020 --> 3:10:25.500
 Fat if it's in the form of a triglyceride, it is a three carbon glycerol backbone and

3:10:25.500 --> 3:10:29.300
 three, you know, tri one, two, three fatty acids.

3:10:29.300 --> 3:10:33.840
 Three carbon backbone and those fatty acids are just big long chains of carbon.

3:10:33.840 --> 3:10:35.340
 That's all it is, right?

3:10:35.340 --> 3:10:38.860
 So we're going to break that thing down, put it in the blood, move it up, move it into

3:10:38.860 --> 3:10:39.940
 our mitochondria.

3:10:39.940 --> 3:10:43.060
 You can't walk those things across the mitochondria wall, they're too big.

3:10:43.060 --> 3:10:47.940
 So what you have to do is cleave them off into little chunks and it turns out we break

3:10:47.940 --> 3:10:52.980
 them off into two carbon chunks, so we call it beta, as in two, move those into mitochondria.

3:10:52.980 --> 3:10:57.140
 That can go through this little thing called Krebs cycle or triaxilic acid cycle and you

3:10:57.140 --> 3:10:59.540
 kick out a bunch of energy out of that.

3:10:59.540 --> 3:11:03.060
 You add two carbons, so as a result of that process, you're going to generate two carbon

3:11:03.060 --> 3:11:04.060
 dioxides.

3:11:04.060 --> 3:11:07.900
 But remember, you can only go through that process if oxygen is available because you

3:11:07.900 --> 3:11:12.540
 have to be able to place those carbons onto something or acid gets up way too high too

3:11:12.540 --> 3:11:14.220
 fast.

3:11:14.220 --> 3:11:18.100
 This is one of the reasons why fat is a nice fuel source, but it's very slow.

3:11:18.100 --> 3:11:22.500
 It takes physical time to move from the back of your shoulder into your blood, down your

3:11:22.500 --> 3:11:24.620
 hamstring, uptake, uptake, uptake.

3:11:24.620 --> 3:11:28.440
 In addition, it's required oxygen availability.

3:11:28.440 --> 3:11:32.220
 If you need energy faster, you simply don't have the time to bring in the oxygen, transport

3:11:32.220 --> 3:11:36.420
 it through, go through capillaries, exchange through a tissue, etc.

3:11:36.420 --> 3:11:41.300
 Carbohydrate, on the other hand, is going to be stored locally in the exercising muscle

3:11:41.300 --> 3:11:42.300
 cell.

3:11:42.300 --> 3:11:44.180
 So specifically in the cytoplasm.

3:11:44.180 --> 3:11:45.220
 As glycogen.

3:11:45.220 --> 3:11:47.780
 As glycogen in the store there.

3:11:47.780 --> 3:11:51.100
 So what's going to happen initially, your initial demands for exercise or for fuel are

3:11:51.100 --> 3:11:54.320
 going to come from the glycogen stored within the muscle fiber itself.

3:11:54.320 --> 3:11:56.820
 It's just going to break right there and you're going to be off the races.

3:11:56.820 --> 3:11:59.380
 So you have the six carbon molecules, you're going to break it into two separate three

3:11:59.380 --> 3:12:00.380
 carbon molecules.

3:12:00.380 --> 3:12:01.380
 Okay, boom.

3:12:01.380 --> 3:12:06.700
 That breaking provides you a tiny bit of energy, very small, but some.

3:12:06.700 --> 3:12:09.540
 Now you're going to take those two, three carbon molecules and you want to be able to

3:12:09.540 --> 3:12:12.380
 oxidize them because that's your only next step.

3:12:12.380 --> 3:12:14.500
 But in order to do that, you've got to go those into mitochondria.

3:12:14.500 --> 3:12:19.180
 So you've got to break one of those molecules off.

3:12:19.180 --> 3:12:22.260
 So then you'll be back to your two carbon molecule, just like you did with fat.

3:12:22.260 --> 3:12:25.340
 That's going to go into mitochondria and then it's going to go through the exact same Krebs

3:12:25.340 --> 3:12:27.760
 cycle, two carbons, etc.

3:12:27.760 --> 3:12:29.680
 But hold on.

3:12:29.680 --> 3:12:34.820
 If you don't have sufficient oxygen or sufficient mitochondria availability and you're stuck

3:12:34.820 --> 3:12:39.480
 at that two, three carbon place, what do you do?

3:12:39.480 --> 3:12:41.500
 We have problems, right?

3:12:41.500 --> 3:12:44.260
 Now we have to say, okay, wait a minute.

3:12:44.260 --> 3:12:48.580
 We have a three carbon molecule and we have a bunch of this acid buildup.

3:12:48.580 --> 3:12:51.500
 Now acid functionally is hydrogen.

3:12:51.500 --> 3:12:54.900
 That's what pH, potential hydrogen is what pH stands for, right?

3:12:54.900 --> 3:12:59.560
 So if hydrogen is building up as a byproduct of muscular contraction and then you're having

3:12:59.560 --> 3:13:04.420
 this three carbon molecule, what it can actually do is grab one of those hydrogens.

3:13:04.420 --> 3:13:08.360
 And those three carbon molecules, by the way, are called pyruvate, pyruvic acid, right?

3:13:08.360 --> 3:13:12.560
 If you take a pyruvic acid and you grab hydrogen and put it on top of it, we now have a different

3:13:12.560 --> 3:13:13.700
 name for it.

3:13:13.700 --> 3:13:18.080
 It's called hydrogen peroxide, lactate bingo, right?

3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:21.100
 That's what lactate or lactic acid is, right?

3:13:21.100 --> 3:13:22.100
 So we've now built that up.

3:13:22.100 --> 3:13:26.540
 So number one reason why lactate is not causing your fatigue, it's actually preventing it

3:13:26.540 --> 3:13:29.020
 and that it does a bunch of other really cool stuff.

3:13:29.020 --> 3:13:32.540
 But the point is that system can only last so, so long.

3:13:32.540 --> 3:13:35.100
 That gets overwhelmed very quickly.

3:13:35.100 --> 3:13:37.380
 What are you going to do with the rest of this hydrogen?

3:13:37.380 --> 3:13:42.620
 Well, if you started off in a normal pH range, you don't have very far to go before you've

3:13:42.620 --> 3:13:45.860
 now gone into that level of too much acidity.

3:13:45.860 --> 3:13:49.940
 If you start off in a more basic, and basic, I don't mean simple, I mean chemistry, right,

3:13:49.940 --> 3:13:54.980
 and more alkaline, then that same amount of increase in pH is no longer, now just puts

3:13:54.980 --> 3:13:56.520
 you back in your physiological range.

3:13:56.520 --> 3:14:01.040
 So sodium bicarbonate, whether taken as a cream or a powder or baking soda or anything

3:14:01.040 --> 3:14:04.580
 else can simply put you in a more alkaline state even acutely.

3:14:04.580 --> 3:14:09.000
 So this is something you can take right now before your workout.

3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:11.900
 You're going to delay what we call delay the progression of fatigue.

3:14:11.900 --> 3:14:16.020
 And how would people start to approach this practice?

3:14:16.020 --> 3:14:20.180
 My understanding is you can do this with common, you know, store-bought baking soda.

3:14:20.180 --> 3:14:21.440
 No question.

3:14:21.440 --> 3:14:26.700
 There's always a concern about gastric distress, that it's a very effective laxative, sometimes

3:14:26.700 --> 3:14:30.300
 an unwanted laxative effect.

3:14:30.300 --> 3:14:32.660
 But how would one approach this before?

3:14:32.660 --> 3:14:41.700
 Let's say I'm going to, I'm doing the mile repeats exercise, mile repeats protocol that

3:14:41.700 --> 3:14:42.940
 we talked about earlier.

3:14:42.940 --> 3:14:46.140
 I'm doing that for a few months, and now I want to try the sodium bicarb approach.

3:14:46.140 --> 3:14:51.020
 I'm well hydrated, hopefully I'm well rested, I'm ready to go.

3:14:51.020 --> 3:14:54.740
 When am I going to drink this sodium bicarb solution?

3:14:54.740 --> 3:14:56.580
 How would I make the solution?

3:14:56.580 --> 3:14:59.760
 Let's say I take 10 ounces of water.

3:14:59.760 --> 3:15:02.420
 How much bicarb do I want to, sodium bicarb should I put in there?

3:15:02.420 --> 3:15:03.420
 Can we come up with it?

3:15:03.420 --> 3:15:04.420
 Is it half a teaspoon?

3:15:04.420 --> 3:15:05.420
 Is it a teaspoon?

3:15:05.420 --> 3:15:07.860
 Here's what I'm going to tell you.

3:15:07.860 --> 3:15:10.220
 You will thank me by starting lower.

3:15:10.220 --> 3:15:11.340
 You can always go more later.

3:15:11.340 --> 3:15:12.340
 So a little pinch.

3:15:12.340 --> 3:15:13.340
 You cannot go backwards.

3:15:13.340 --> 3:15:15.020
 How about I start with a quarter teaspoon?

3:15:15.020 --> 3:15:16.020
 Fine.

3:15:16.020 --> 3:15:17.020
 Honestly, half is fine.

3:15:17.020 --> 3:15:18.020
 Half a teaspoon.

3:15:18.020 --> 3:15:19.020
 Totally fine.

3:15:19.020 --> 3:15:20.020
 Dissolve that, slug that down.

3:15:20.020 --> 3:15:24.920
 I read a study recently that showed that people will hit their, the peak benefits of this

3:15:24.920 --> 3:15:29.740
 at different times, but it's somewhere, if memory serves me correctly, somewhere between

3:15:29.740 --> 3:15:32.840
 60 and 90 minutes later, so I might want to drink it on the way to the track.

3:15:32.840 --> 3:15:33.840
 It can.

3:15:33.840 --> 3:15:34.840
 It can be as low as 20.

3:15:34.840 --> 3:15:35.840
 Okay.

3:15:35.840 --> 3:15:39.060
 So maybe as I get to the tracks since I'm going to do some warm up with some walking

3:15:39.060 --> 3:15:40.060
 jogging.

3:15:40.060 --> 3:15:41.060
 I say 45 minutes.

3:15:41.060 --> 3:15:42.060
 Okay.

3:15:42.060 --> 3:15:43.060
 That's just a very rough standard.

3:15:43.060 --> 3:15:44.060
 But yeah, you're right.

3:15:44.060 --> 3:15:47.560
 It is, it is individualized and you probably want to play with that a little bit, if not

3:15:47.560 --> 3:15:50.180
 just somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to an hour.

3:15:50.180 --> 3:15:51.180
 Okay.

3:15:51.180 --> 3:15:57.660
 And then the perceived and real fatigue, if done correctly, the perceived and real fatigue

3:15:57.660 --> 3:15:58.900
 ought to be reduced.

3:15:58.900 --> 3:15:59.900
 Yes.

3:15:59.900 --> 3:16:02.220
 I can do more work without feeling exhausted.

3:16:02.220 --> 3:16:06.300
 Will I feel less of a lactate burn done in air quotes for those listening.

3:16:06.300 --> 3:16:10.420
 I realize that's a very crude way to describe a complex physiological process.

3:16:10.420 --> 3:16:11.420
 Yeah.

3:16:11.420 --> 3:16:12.420
 Fantastic.

3:16:12.420 --> 3:16:17.940
 Can sodium bicarb be used repeatedly for longer duration training?

3:16:17.940 --> 3:16:18.940
 Yep.

3:16:18.940 --> 3:16:23.040
 And if I were going to use it with weight training for whatever reason, maybe I'm doing

3:16:23.040 --> 3:16:26.320
 circuit type training or I'm doing the super set type strength training that you talked

3:16:26.320 --> 3:16:30.580
 about before, push, pull, push, pull, where it's a little bit more cardiovascularly demanding.

3:16:30.580 --> 3:16:31.580
 Yep.

3:16:31.580 --> 3:16:35.460
 Then maybe I'd sip that throughout the workout, make sure there's a bathroom nearby, it sounds

3:16:35.460 --> 3:16:36.460
 like.

3:16:36.460 --> 3:16:39.580
 Because I do, I am aware that many people get pretty serious gastric distress.

3:16:39.580 --> 3:16:40.580
 It can happen very quickly.

3:16:40.580 --> 3:16:41.580
 Okay.

3:16:41.580 --> 3:16:42.580
 Great.

3:16:42.580 --> 3:16:43.820
 Well, it sounds like an amazing training tool.

3:16:43.820 --> 3:16:47.260
 I really appreciate you sharing it because I think it's, it's one that doesn't get a

3:16:47.260 --> 3:16:51.580
 lot of airtime these days because it's been around, but sounds like it has some pretty

3:16:51.580 --> 3:16:52.580
 impressive effects.

3:16:52.580 --> 3:16:53.580
 Yeah.

3:16:53.580 --> 3:16:55.500
 You know, what's sort of funny about that is, I mean, I get it.

3:16:55.500 --> 3:16:59.140
 Pop culture is what it is, but still to this day, if you want to talk about sort of your

3:16:59.140 --> 3:17:04.060
 most effective general health slash performance supplementation, it's the same three to four

3:17:04.060 --> 3:17:07.760
 to five and it's because they work really well.

3:17:07.760 --> 3:17:10.980
 Without going into the chemistry of each one and the practice of each one, because I definitely

3:17:10.980 --> 3:17:16.740
 want to get you back to talk about diet, nutrition and supplementation at some point.

3:17:16.740 --> 3:17:22.820
 But I think we need a full couple of hours to get that right, at least.

3:17:22.820 --> 3:17:27.920
 If you, as a teaser, would you mind just listing off the other supplements that you have found

3:17:27.920 --> 3:17:30.700
 are very effective for, for many people?

3:17:30.700 --> 3:17:32.920
 So sodium bicarb or baking soda is one.

3:17:32.920 --> 3:17:33.920
 What are some of the other ones?

3:17:33.920 --> 3:17:34.920
 Yep.

3:17:34.920 --> 3:17:35.920
 And we'll go kind of in reverse order.

3:17:35.920 --> 3:17:42.060
 Beta alanine is another very classically effective one, similar idea of sodium bicarbonate.

3:17:42.060 --> 3:17:45.440
 So it's, it's, it's going to, beta alanine is going to come in, it's going to be converted

3:17:45.440 --> 3:17:49.560
 and stored as what's called carnosine in the muscle and carnosine is an intracellular buffer.

3:17:49.560 --> 3:17:53.240
 So in other words, it's just going to delay the buildup of acid.

3:17:53.240 --> 3:17:55.040
 So fatigue blocker, if you will.

3:17:55.040 --> 3:18:00.140
 So very effective, very cheap, very safe, well studied.

3:18:00.140 --> 3:18:05.400
 The top one though of all of them by far that has an incredibly strong safety profile.

3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:12.920
 It has, it is a cheap, it is a simple form to get, has a important magnitude of effect

3:18:12.920 --> 3:18:16.920
 and is effective across multiple domains of physical health and performance.

3:18:16.920 --> 3:18:19.880
 And it is, because of that, it is my crown jewel.

3:18:19.880 --> 3:18:24.880
 It is, in my opinion, without question, the Michael Jordan of all supplementation.

3:18:24.880 --> 3:18:26.360
 And that's creatine monohydrate.

3:18:26.360 --> 3:18:28.200
 It affects so many things.

3:18:28.200 --> 3:18:30.980
 We typically think about it as it's muscle stuff, right?

3:18:30.980 --> 3:18:34.600
 You've talked kind of, you quickly were talking about the creatine phosphate system, but we

3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:39.320
 have to realize the mass majority of research on creatine phosphate is not in sport performance

3:18:39.320 --> 3:18:41.280
 and has not been for 20 years.

3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:42.600
 It's in clinical.

3:18:42.600 --> 3:18:48.120
 And it has everything from effects on the neurological system to there have been associations

3:18:48.120 --> 3:18:50.260
 to mental health and depression.

3:18:50.260 --> 3:18:55.640
 And to be very clear, I am certainly not saying you can take creatine and cure anything.

3:18:55.640 --> 3:18:58.680
 And I'm not saying it's going to stop you from depression or anything, but I'm saying

3:18:58.680 --> 3:19:02.120
 there's, there's a lot of research in these areas and there's a reason people are doing

3:19:02.120 --> 3:19:03.120
 it.

3:19:03.120 --> 3:19:04.120
 Yeah.

3:19:04.120 --> 3:19:05.120
 I completely agree.

3:19:05.120 --> 3:19:08.160
 And if you're willing, I'd love to have you back for us to do a discussion on creatine

3:19:08.160 --> 3:19:11.960
 and the brain or creatine and the nervous system, that would be a lot of fun and maybe

3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:14.480
 we can do a kind of a journal club in advance of that.

3:19:14.480 --> 3:19:19.200
 For those that don't know, a journal club is where scientists read a bunch of papers

3:19:19.200 --> 3:19:24.720
 and then argue about them, discuss them and try and extract the kind of agreed upon center

3:19:24.720 --> 3:19:26.480
 of mass, if you will.

3:19:26.480 --> 3:19:31.800
 I think I've long been taking five grams of creatine monohydrate per day for mainly for

3:19:31.800 --> 3:19:34.120
 the cognitive effects.

3:19:34.120 --> 3:19:36.040
 I sense an effect.

3:19:36.040 --> 3:19:39.640
 That's obviously anek data, but there, I think there are a lot of data out there.

3:19:39.640 --> 3:19:41.600
 There's enough that you're not, you're not crazy.

3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:42.600
 There's enough there.

3:19:42.600 --> 3:19:47.920
 And in fact, there's enough mechanism now to understand the metabolic needs.

3:19:47.920 --> 3:19:49.800
 People think the med, I'm a muscle guy, right?

3:19:49.800 --> 3:19:54.320
 So I'm going to think about the metabolism needed to fuel muscle, but we forget cells,

3:19:54.320 --> 3:19:59.080
 immune cells, red blood cells, nerve cells, astrocytes, brain, all this stuff requires

3:19:59.080 --> 3:20:00.080
 energy.

3:20:00.080 --> 3:20:02.920
 And it's all going through metabolism.

3:20:02.920 --> 3:20:03.920
 Super interesting.

3:20:03.920 --> 3:20:08.040
 We will do the deep dive on that soon.

3:20:08.040 --> 3:20:09.820
 I have a final question for you.

3:20:09.820 --> 3:20:14.940
 You're involved in a really interesting, I think really cutting edge project that I first

3:20:14.940 --> 3:20:16.080
 learned about from you.

3:20:16.080 --> 3:20:22.840
 I don't know of anyone else doing anything as forward thinking and frankly, as relevant

3:20:22.840 --> 3:20:28.200
 to the general population because of my interest in people getting better sleep and learning

3:20:28.200 --> 3:20:31.000
 how to do that, avoiding stress and learning how to do that.

3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:36.340
 Tell us a little bit about what I believe is called absolute rest, right?

3:20:36.340 --> 3:20:40.720
 So this is something that we've been playing with behind the scenes for a long time.

3:20:40.720 --> 3:20:43.240
 And this is typically how high performance stuff works, right?

3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:46.880
 People want exclusivity and so this has been built.

3:20:46.880 --> 3:20:50.640
 Effectively what happened is a friend of mine, Cody Burkhardt, I don't know if you know Cody,

3:20:50.640 --> 3:20:51.640
 but a famous-

3:20:51.640 --> 3:20:52.640
 Down in Texas.

3:20:52.640 --> 3:20:53.640
 Yeah.

3:20:53.640 --> 3:20:54.640
 Yeah.

3:20:54.640 --> 3:20:55.640
 NASA.

3:20:55.640 --> 3:20:56.640
 NASA guy.

3:20:56.640 --> 3:20:57.640
 Yeah.

3:20:57.640 --> 3:20:58.640
 I do know Cody.

3:20:58.640 --> 3:20:59.640
 Wonderful.

3:20:59.640 --> 3:21:00.640
 Just down the road thinker.

3:21:00.640 --> 3:21:01.720
 Everyone's interested in sleep, right?

3:21:01.720 --> 3:21:07.400
 And for forever, I would cover using with athletes, but everything available tells you

3:21:07.400 --> 3:21:09.840
 how you're sleeping.

3:21:09.840 --> 3:21:12.360
 Nothing can tell you why you're sleeping that way.

3:21:12.360 --> 3:21:17.080
 And so we got together in Boulder and then I met some of his former colleagues, computer

3:21:17.080 --> 3:21:24.480
 science folks, Harvard MD, and some really impressive tech folks and we were just thinking

3:21:24.480 --> 3:21:28.400
 about an idea and we came up with, we started to realize the problems, right?

3:21:28.400 --> 3:21:29.400
 We use first principle thinking.

3:21:29.400 --> 3:21:31.520
 It's one of my favorite approaches.

3:21:31.520 --> 3:21:33.640
 If you're not familiar with that, go Google that.

3:21:33.640 --> 3:21:36.920
 Like that's just a recipe to solve problems, this first principle thinking.

3:21:36.920 --> 3:21:40.200
 And we just started to think about like, man, all the sleep tech is there.

3:21:40.200 --> 3:21:41.200
 It's real.

3:21:41.200 --> 3:21:43.800
 I don't need to convince people that they need sleep.

3:21:43.800 --> 3:21:45.900
 Everyone's done that.

3:21:45.900 --> 3:21:48.320
 You need high quality sleep, but how can I provide solutions?

3:21:48.320 --> 3:21:53.220
 And with the people I work with, I can't just tell them your testosterone's down or your

3:21:53.220 --> 3:21:54.220
 sleep's down or recover.

3:21:54.220 --> 3:21:57.960
 I need to be able to be like, this is down and here's why and here's our solution.

3:21:57.960 --> 3:21:59.920
 That's how our high performance world works.

3:21:59.920 --> 3:22:01.780
 So enter absolute rest.

3:22:01.780 --> 3:22:06.680
 This is saying, okay, what are the actual nodes that go into high effective, high quality

3:22:06.680 --> 3:22:07.680
 sleep?

3:22:07.680 --> 3:22:09.000
 Number one is psychology.

3:22:09.000 --> 3:22:12.440
 So there has to be some sort of screening diagnostic for, are you not sleeping because

3:22:12.440 --> 3:22:17.000
 of simply you can't control yourself and you've done a wonderful job of giving people tools

3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:19.660
 or if you can't quiet your mind before sleep, do this.

3:22:19.660 --> 3:22:22.860
 If you wake up and you can't go back to sleep, here are a bunch of things, right?

3:22:22.860 --> 3:22:26.360
 So we have some screens that we can do and there's some of that stuff we can do to analyze.

3:22:26.360 --> 3:22:27.600
 This is a psychological issue.

3:22:27.600 --> 3:22:29.400
 Let's say it's not.

3:22:29.400 --> 3:22:34.160
 They're under control and we have different tricks we use and stuff on gymnastics we talk

3:22:34.160 --> 3:22:35.160
 about.

3:22:35.160 --> 3:22:36.160
 But it's not that.

3:22:36.160 --> 3:22:37.160
 Okay.

3:22:37.160 --> 3:22:38.160
 Is it physiology?

3:22:38.160 --> 3:22:39.640
 Which is node number two.

3:22:39.640 --> 3:22:41.160
 Do we know what your dopamine levels are like?

3:22:41.160 --> 3:22:42.800
 Do we know what your serotonin levels are like?

3:22:42.800 --> 3:22:44.000
 What's melatonin look like?

3:22:44.000 --> 3:22:45.000
 What's this?

3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:46.000
 What's adrenaline?

3:22:46.000 --> 3:22:47.000
 What's cortisol?

3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:48.720
 Cortisol being the primary driver.

3:22:48.720 --> 3:22:50.240
 What is this relationship DHEA?

3:22:50.240 --> 3:22:51.240
 Where are these things at?

3:22:51.240 --> 3:22:53.600
 So we're going to measure all that and track that.

3:22:53.600 --> 3:22:56.200
 We're going to measure that during the day prior to sleep, we're going to measure that

3:22:56.200 --> 3:22:59.600
 next morning and even sometimes throughout sleep.

3:22:59.600 --> 3:23:01.280
 And we're going to figure out is this a physiology problem?

3:23:01.280 --> 3:23:02.920
 If it is, then we have clear corrections.

3:23:02.920 --> 3:23:08.120
 If not, we're going to go on the next step, which is, is this possibly a pathology?

3:23:08.120 --> 3:23:09.520
 So you have some sort of sleep disorder.

3:23:09.520 --> 3:23:13.640
 We're going to run full what's called PSG, so polysomnography, the exact same stuff you

3:23:13.640 --> 3:23:16.200
 would get in a sleep clinic.

3:23:16.200 --> 3:23:19.580
 It's a sensor that's going to go on there measuring EEG and EOG and we're going to have

3:23:19.580 --> 3:23:23.280
 a muscle activation sensor to see if your legs are moving and everything else is going

3:23:23.280 --> 3:23:24.280
 on.

3:23:24.280 --> 3:23:25.280
 And we're going to get a full diagnostic.

3:23:25.280 --> 3:23:30.320
 So if anyone's ever done this, the amount of sleep issues that are happening in people

3:23:30.320 --> 3:23:33.440
 that they don't even realize is extraordinarily high.

3:23:33.440 --> 3:23:35.060
 So we're going to figure this out.

3:23:35.060 --> 3:23:39.080
 One very quick example, we just did this with a professional athlete and he was having like

3:23:39.080 --> 3:23:44.240
 280 roughly of these episodes per night and to be categorized as an episode, you have

3:23:44.240 --> 3:23:49.800
 to meet these four specific criteria, oxygen saturation, ventilation changes, brain changes,

3:23:49.800 --> 3:23:50.800
 et cetera.

3:23:50.800 --> 3:23:53.580
 And he hit that over 280 times a night.

3:23:53.580 --> 3:23:57.080
 And what this technology allowed us to do is figure out what position did all these

3:23:57.080 --> 3:23:58.080
 things occur in.

3:23:58.080 --> 3:24:02.080
 Well, in his particular case, most of them are happening on his back.

3:24:02.080 --> 3:24:06.600
 And so we bought a very simple like pillow basically that went on his back that kept

3:24:06.600 --> 3:24:08.200
 him from sleeping on his back.

3:24:08.200 --> 3:24:13.720
 And we saw an 85% reduction in sleep-awakeness issues the very first night.

3:24:13.720 --> 3:24:19.640
 Now we did that, testosterone eventually tripled after three months by just improving sleep

3:24:19.640 --> 3:24:23.060
 and all we did is move him onto his left or right side.

3:24:23.060 --> 3:24:28.120
 So huge improvements just by understanding where the problem occurred and why it occurred

3:24:28.120 --> 3:24:29.120
 there.

3:24:29.120 --> 3:24:30.520
 We didn't have to change hardly anything else.

3:24:30.520 --> 3:24:34.840
 He had the basic hygiene stuff down and temperature and all that stuff and he had his chili pad

3:24:34.840 --> 3:24:37.400
 and all that to keep the thing cool.

3:24:37.400 --> 3:24:38.400
 We couldn't fix it.

3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:39.400
 Years, by the way.

3:24:39.400 --> 3:24:42.140
 This took us two years of just trying everything.

3:24:42.140 --> 3:24:43.140
 We're like, man.

3:24:43.140 --> 3:24:47.560
 And it was just like, I wish, I wish we could get you to sleep better and we, I pulled out

3:24:47.560 --> 3:24:48.560
 every trick I knew.

3:24:48.560 --> 3:24:52.960
 And it's just as soon as we built this dinner, I'm like, oh my God, it's all, he's not overweight

3:24:52.960 --> 3:24:53.960
 by the way.

3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:54.960
 He doesn't have any, he's not iron deficient.

3:24:54.960 --> 3:24:58.680
 He doesn't have any of these other classical symptoms that are associated with Batsy.

3:24:58.680 --> 3:25:04.440
 Supplementation, everything we've done, a thousand protocols, that fixed it overnight.

3:25:04.440 --> 3:25:08.160
 So if it's not psychology and it's not physiology and it's not pathology, then the last one

3:25:08.160 --> 3:25:11.280
 that people don't have any idea about is environment.

3:25:11.280 --> 3:25:13.740
 And so what you don't realize is we have a box.

3:25:13.740 --> 3:25:14.920
 We can sit right next to your bed.

3:25:14.920 --> 3:25:15.920
 You just plug it in.

3:25:15.920 --> 3:25:18.780
 You don't have to do anything and it's going to run full environmental scans.

3:25:18.780 --> 3:25:20.400
 So it's going to look at the temperature in your room.

3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:22.240
 It's going to look at the humidity in your room.

3:25:22.240 --> 3:25:25.080
 It's going to look at the volatile organic acids, these are things that are seeping out

3:25:25.080 --> 3:25:26.080
 from your mattress.

3:25:26.080 --> 3:25:29.240
 It's going to look at particulates in the air and possible allergens and things that

3:25:29.240 --> 3:25:33.560
 are floating around that are closing your nose off so you can't sleep at night and now

3:25:33.560 --> 3:25:34.560
 your mouth breathing.

3:25:34.560 --> 3:25:38.440
 And you've talked a lot, I'm sure on the previous episodes about why that's bad.

3:25:38.440 --> 3:25:40.520
 It's going to look at your CO2 cloud.

3:25:40.520 --> 3:25:42.480
 So we've talked, we've already set this point up, right?

3:25:42.480 --> 3:25:46.300
 You're inhaling O2, but then you're exhaling CO2.

3:25:46.300 --> 3:25:50.600
 Well during the day and when we're conversing, you have quite a bit of force with that exhalation,

3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:51.600
 right?

3:25:51.600 --> 3:25:57.300
 But at night, it's just barely seeping out of your mouth.

3:25:57.300 --> 3:26:01.400
 So what happens is CO2 sends to cloud up and build around your face and then you end up

3:26:01.400 --> 3:26:03.200
 re-breathing that CO2.

3:26:03.200 --> 3:26:07.800
 And this can cause a large number of sleep problems because you're simply re-breathing

3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:08.800
 in the panic.

3:26:08.800 --> 3:26:12.340
 Whether you're fully awake or just kick out of a sleep stage, the CO2 around your face

3:26:12.340 --> 3:26:13.800
 is a big issue.

3:26:13.800 --> 3:26:17.040
 This stuff has all been known, by the way, with the astronauts for a very long time.

3:26:17.040 --> 3:26:20.720
 It just hasn't translated into the commercial spaces.

3:26:20.720 --> 3:26:23.800
 Of course, gone into our high performer space.

3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:24.800
 So we can measure that as well.

3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:29.560
 And then we can figure out, like for the most extreme, we can actually come into a bedroom

3:26:29.560 --> 3:26:33.800
 and build an entire sleep optimization setup and control the entire thing.

3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:39.040
 But for most folks, the minimum we can do is run fold diagnostics and check off is this

3:26:39.040 --> 3:26:40.200
 environmental related?

3:26:40.200 --> 3:26:41.320
 Is it pathology?

3:26:41.320 --> 3:26:42.320
 Is there something else?

3:26:42.320 --> 3:26:45.920
 So is this a commercial device that people can eventually access?

3:26:45.920 --> 3:26:46.960
 It is now.

3:26:46.960 --> 3:26:50.000
 So where can people learn more about Absolute Rest?

3:26:50.000 --> 3:26:51.000
 Absoluterest.com.

3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:52.840
 Very cool.

3:26:52.840 --> 3:26:56.880
 And just for full disclosure, I wasn't aware that you had done this prior to today.

3:26:56.880 --> 3:27:00.360
 You mentioned I always like to ask people, scientists or otherwise, I always love to

3:27:00.360 --> 3:27:02.280
 ask you, what are you most excited about lately?

3:27:02.280 --> 3:27:05.200
 And this sounds like an amazing technology.

3:27:05.200 --> 3:27:08.040
 And just to be really clear, that's not like something we're working on.

3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:09.040
 That's landed.

3:27:09.040 --> 3:27:10.040
 That's landed.

3:27:10.040 --> 3:27:11.040
 We're ready to go.

3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:12.040
 Great.

3:27:12.040 --> 3:27:15.720
 Well, and that's one of the things I appreciate about you is that you're willing to sometimes

3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:17.740
 speculate but you always say it's speculation.

3:27:17.740 --> 3:27:22.240
 But in general, you seem like the kind of guy where if you're going to be public facing

3:27:22.240 --> 3:27:26.680
 about something, if you're going to make a statement, there's got to be quite a bit behind

3:27:26.680 --> 3:27:27.680
 it.

3:27:27.680 --> 3:27:30.600
 You're not going to allude to the in 10 years, we might be able to do this or in five years.

3:27:30.600 --> 3:27:32.200
 You're very data driven kind of guy.

3:27:32.200 --> 3:27:33.200
 Yeah.

3:27:33.200 --> 3:27:34.880
 Well, the people I work with, we need answers, right?

3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:36.600
 We don't have that timeframe.

3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:39.840
 And we typically have like, hey, we start the season in four weeks.

3:27:39.840 --> 3:27:40.840
 Yeah.

3:27:40.840 --> 3:27:41.840
 So that's just where I'm at.

3:27:41.840 --> 3:27:45.240
 Well, as I said, I appreciate that about you.

3:27:45.240 --> 3:27:50.880
 That is but one of the many things I appreciate, I think the listeners and I can well appreciate

3:27:50.880 --> 3:27:56.800
 on the basis of today's discussion, what a enormous wealth of information you are, how

3:27:56.800 --> 3:28:04.240
 clear and, and potently you communicate that information and also how you can take a huge

3:28:04.240 --> 3:28:11.360
 cloud of information and still distill it into protocols that ought to work for 75%

3:28:11.360 --> 3:28:16.520
 of people, 75% of the time, which is an immensely valuable thing to do.

3:28:16.520 --> 3:28:22.080
 So for me and from the listeners, I just want to say thank you so much for taking the several

3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:23.080
 now hours.

3:28:23.080 --> 3:28:27.680
 I lose track of time, which is a good, reflects all good things.

3:28:27.680 --> 3:28:31.940
 Several hours to take a break from teaching, take a break from research, take a break from

3:28:31.940 --> 3:28:35.880
 the other important commitments of your life and really share with us all this incredible

3:28:35.880 --> 3:28:36.880
 information.

3:28:36.880 --> 3:28:37.880
 I'm so, so grateful.

3:28:37.880 --> 3:28:38.880
 My pleasure, man.

3:28:38.880 --> 3:28:40.320
 I'm glad we finally got to connect.

3:28:40.320 --> 3:28:42.080
 This has been a long time in the making.

3:28:42.080 --> 3:28:43.080
 It has.

3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:48.060
 And I'm going to, I'm going to bring the breathing protocols to my training.

3:28:48.060 --> 3:28:52.040
 I'm going to start doing more of the endurance type and interval type training.

3:28:52.040 --> 3:28:53.520
 I'm going to start moving when I do heat.

3:28:53.520 --> 3:28:57.260
 I'm going to start moving when I do cold, I might even start throwing some sodium bicarb

3:28:57.260 --> 3:29:02.800
 into a very small amount of sodium bicarb into some water before I train.

3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:07.880
 And listen Andy, professor Andy Galpin, thank you ever so much.

3:29:07.880 --> 3:29:09.140
 My pleasure.

 the podcast at any level that you like during today's conversation.

3:30:10.540 --> 3:30:14.820
 And on many previous episodes of the Huberman lab podcast, we discuss supplements while

3:30:14.820 --> 3:30:17.180
 supplements aren't necessary for everybody.

3:30:17.180 --> 3:30:22.100
 Many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things like sleep and focus and energy,

3:30:22.100 --> 3:30:25.880
 and many other features of our physiology and mental functioning.

3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:28.980
 There are some important issues to consider when considering supplements.

3:30:28.980 --> 3:30:31.500
 One of those issues is the quality of the ingredients.

3:30:31.500 --> 3:30:36.340
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E, because Thorne supplements have

3:30:36.340 --> 3:30:40.680
 the highest possible standards with respect to the quality of the ingredients they include.

3:30:40.680 --> 3:30:45.880
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take, you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com

3:30:45.880 --> 3:30:50.960
 slash the letter U slash Huberman, and there you'll see the supplements that I take and

3:30:50.960 --> 3:30:53.780
 you can get 20% off any of those supplements.

3:30:53.780 --> 3:30:58.540
 If you navigate further into the Thorne site through that website, thorne.com slash U slash

3:30:58.540 --> 3:31:02.980
 Huberman, you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

3:31:02.980 --> 3:31:07.540
 If you're not already following Huberman lab on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

3:31:07.540 --> 3:31:11.500
 There I discuss science and science-based tools, some of which overlap with the content

3:31:11.500 --> 3:31:15.180
 of the Huberman lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the information covered on

3:31:15.180 --> 3:31:16.460
 this podcast.

3:31:16.460 --> 3:31:19.900
 Thank you once again for joining me for my discussion with Dr. Andy Galpin.

3:31:19.900 --> 3:31:28.620
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
