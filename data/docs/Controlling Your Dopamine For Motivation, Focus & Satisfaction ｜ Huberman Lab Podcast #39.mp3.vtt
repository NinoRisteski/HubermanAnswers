00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.200
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.200 --> 00:15.380
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.380 --> 00:18.160
 Today, we are going to talk all about dopamine

00:18.160 --> 00:21.160
 and what drives you to do the things that you do.

00:21.160 --> 00:25.480
 We're going to talk about motivation and desire and craving,

00:25.480 --> 00:29.160
 but also how dopamine relates to satisfaction

00:29.160 --> 00:31.040
 and our feelings of wellbeing.

00:31.040 --> 00:33.580
 And of course, any discussion about dopamine

00:33.580 --> 00:36.300
 has to include a discussion about the potential

00:36.300 --> 00:39.440
 for dopamine-induced addiction.

00:39.440 --> 00:42.000
 Indeed, dopamine lies at the heart of addiction

00:42.000 --> 00:45.960
 to all things, but today we are mainly going to focus on

00:45.960 --> 00:49.320
 how what we do and how we do it

00:49.320 --> 00:52.160
 and how we conceptualize those things

00:52.160 --> 00:55.200
 leads to changes in this amazing molecule

00:55.200 --> 00:58.160
 in our brain and bodies that we call dopamine.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.640
 I'm going to teach you what dopamine is and what it is not.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.020
 There are a lot of myths about the molecule dopamine.

01:04.020 --> 01:06.560
 We often hear about so-called dopamine hits.

01:06.560 --> 01:08.840
 Today, we are going to dispel many common myths

01:08.840 --> 01:11.360
 about dopamine, and we are going to talk about

01:11.360 --> 01:13.180
 how dopamine actually works.

01:13.180 --> 01:15.760
 We're going to discuss the biology of dopamine,

01:15.760 --> 01:18.640
 the psychology, we will discuss some neural circuits,

01:18.640 --> 01:21.600
 and a really exciting aspect of dopamine biology

01:21.600 --> 01:23.880
 are so-called dopamine schedules.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.280
 In other words, we are going to discuss

01:25.280 --> 01:28.920
 how things like food, drugs, caffeine, pornography,

01:28.920 --> 01:31.000
 even some plant-based compounds

01:31.000 --> 01:33.880
 can change our baseline levels of dopamine,

01:33.880 --> 01:36.300
 and in doing so, they change how much dopamine

01:36.300 --> 01:38.680
 we are capable of experiencing

01:38.680 --> 01:42.040
 from what could be very satisfying events

01:42.040 --> 01:44.180
 or events that make us feel not so good

01:44.180 --> 01:47.060
 because of things that we did or took prior.

01:47.060 --> 01:50.800
 So I promise you it's going to be a vast discussion,

01:50.800 --> 01:52.320
 but I will structure it for you,

01:52.320 --> 01:54.580
 and you'll come away with a deep understanding

01:54.580 --> 01:56.080
 of really what drives you.

01:56.080 --> 01:58.520
 You will also come away with a lot of tools,

01:58.520 --> 02:00.480
 how to leverage dopamine

02:00.480 --> 02:03.280
 so that you can sustain energy drive and motivation

02:03.280 --> 02:04.680
 for the things that are important to you

02:04.680 --> 02:06.680
 over long periods of time.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.720
 Before we dive into the meat of today's discussion,

02:09.720 --> 02:13.200
 I'd like to share with you a fascinating result

02:13.200 --> 02:16.040
 that really underscores what dopamine is capable of

02:16.040 --> 02:17.120
 in our brains and bodies,

02:17.120 --> 02:20.940
 and underscores the fact that just through behaviors,

02:20.940 --> 02:24.040
 no drugs, nothing of that sort, just through behaviors,

02:24.040 --> 02:27.960
 we can achieve terrifically high increases in dopamine

02:27.960 --> 02:32.200
 that are very long and sustained in ways that serve us.

02:32.200 --> 02:33.440
 This is a result that was published

02:33.440 --> 02:35.500
 in the European Journal of Physiology.

02:35.500 --> 02:37.120
 I'll go into it in more detail later,

02:37.120 --> 02:40.720
 but essentially what it involved is having human subjects

02:40.720 --> 02:43.880
 get into water of different temperatures.

02:43.880 --> 02:47.280
 So it was warm water, moderately cool water,

02:47.280 --> 02:49.200
 and cold, cold water.

02:49.200 --> 02:52.120
 Had them stay in that water for up to an hour,

02:52.120 --> 02:55.000
 and they measured, by way of blood draw,

02:55.000 --> 02:58.320
 things like cortisol, norepinephrine, and dopamine.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.540
 What was fascinating is that cold water exposure

03:03.540 --> 03:08.360
 led to very rapid increases in norepinephrine and epinephrine

03:08.360 --> 03:10.680
 which is also just called adrenaline.

03:10.680 --> 03:13.460
 It also led to increases in dopamine,

03:13.460 --> 03:16.840
 and these increases in dopamine were very significant.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.360
 They kicked in around 10 or 15 minutes

03:19.360 --> 03:21.440
 after submersion into the cold water,

03:21.440 --> 03:23.080
 and I should mention the head wasn't below water,

03:23.080 --> 03:24.860
 it was just up to the neck.

03:24.860 --> 03:29.860
 And the dopamine release continued to rise and rise and rise

03:30.480 --> 03:33.800
 and eventually reached 250% above baseline.

03:33.800 --> 03:36.880
 Now, what was interesting is after subjects got out

03:36.880 --> 03:40.940
 of this cold water, that dopamine increase was sustained.

03:40.940 --> 03:42.980
 And I know nowadays many people are interested

03:42.980 --> 03:47.000
 in using cold water therapy as a way to increase metabolism

03:47.000 --> 03:51.400
 and fat loss, but also to improve sense of wellbeing

03:51.400 --> 03:54.600
 improve cognition, improve clarity of mind.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.080
 You know, there's something really special

03:56.080 --> 03:59.280
 about this very alert but calm state of mind

03:59.280 --> 04:01.460
 that seems to be the one that's optimal

04:01.460 --> 04:03.960
 for pretty much everything except sleep,

04:03.960 --> 04:07.620
 but for all aspects of work and for social engagement

04:07.620 --> 04:12.000
 and for sport, that highly alert but calm state of mind

04:12.000 --> 04:14.440
 really is the sweet spot that I believe most of us

04:14.440 --> 04:15.480
 would like to achieve.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.440
 And this cold water exposure done correctly

04:18.440 --> 04:21.400
 really can help people achieve that state of mind

04:21.400 --> 04:23.300
 through these increases in dopamine

04:23.300 --> 04:25.120
 that lasts a very long time.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.440
 So I will later detail the specifics of that study,

04:28.440 --> 04:31.880
 what it entailed in terms of how long the variations

04:31.880 --> 04:33.680
 that different subjects experienced,

04:33.680 --> 04:37.040
 as well as how to limit the amount of stress hormone cortisol

04:37.040 --> 04:40.200
 that's released as a consequence of the cold water.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.000
 And we will also talk about compounds,

04:42.000 --> 04:43.680
 supplements that people can take

04:43.680 --> 04:45.960
 in order to increase their levels of dopamine

04:45.960 --> 04:47.500
 should they choose.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.960
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

04:49.960 --> 04:52.820
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:52.820 --> 04:55.080
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

04:55.080 --> 04:57.880
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:57.880 --> 05:00.600
 and science related tools to the general public.

05:00.600 --> 05:01.720
 In keeping with that theme,

05:01.720 --> 05:04.640
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

05:04.640 --> 05:06.600
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.680
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

05:08.680 --> 05:11.240
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.640
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system

05:13.640 --> 05:14.840
 and I can tell you that the visual system

05:14.840 --> 05:16.040
 has to go through a lot of work

05:16.040 --> 05:18.760
 in order to maintain clarity of what you see

05:18.760 --> 05:20.160
 when there are shadows,

05:20.160 --> 05:22.000
 when you go into different types of indoor lighting

05:22.000 --> 05:22.840
 and so on.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.440
 And a lot of glasses don't work well

05:24.440 --> 05:27.680
 because you put them on and then you're in bright light

05:27.680 --> 05:29.440
 and you can see fine, but then you move into a shadow

05:29.440 --> 05:31.440
 and then you have to take them off and they don't adjust

05:31.440 --> 05:33.200
 or they don't adjust quickly enough.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.120
 With Roca, their eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed

05:36.120 --> 05:38.760
 with the visual system biology in mind.

05:38.760 --> 05:40.680
 So you always see things with perfect clarity.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.000
 The glasses are also terrific

05:42.000 --> 05:43.320
 because they're very lightweight

05:43.320 --> 05:45.680
 and they won't slip off your face if you're exercising,

05:45.680 --> 05:46.680
 if you're running or biking.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.400
 In fact, they were designed for the purpose

05:48.400 --> 05:50.840
 of being able to be worn while you're engaging

05:50.840 --> 05:53.820
 in those sorts of activities or simply working at your desk.

05:53.820 --> 05:56.880
 I happen to wear readers at night when I drive

05:56.880 --> 05:59.200
 or when I work and I love their sunglasses

05:59.200 --> 06:00.680
 because I can wear them anywhere.

06:00.680 --> 06:03.000
 And also the aesthetics of their sunglasses

06:03.000 --> 06:04.320
 and eyeglasses are terrific.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.160
 Unlike a lot of other performance glasses

06:06.160 --> 06:08.560
 that frankly make people look like cyborgs,

06:08.560 --> 06:10.400
 the aesthetics on Roca's are really terrific.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.600
 You could wear them anywhere you'd like to go.

06:12.600 --> 06:14.080
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

06:14.080 --> 06:17.520

06:25.440 --> 06:28.920
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.360
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:31.360 --> 06:33.740
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:33.740 --> 06:35.760
 to help you better understand your body

06:35.760 --> 06:37.720
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.760
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done.

06:40.760 --> 06:43.040
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

06:43.040 --> 06:45.000
 you can also analyze your DNA

06:45.000 --> 06:46.940
 to see what you ought to be doing

06:46.940 --> 06:49.320
 for your immediate and long-term health.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.160
 We hear a lot these days about optimization,

06:51.160 --> 06:53.360
 optimizing hormones, optimizing your metabolism,

06:53.360 --> 06:54.800
 optimizing this, optimizing that.

06:54.800 --> 06:57.840
 But unless you know the measurements of metabolic factors,

06:57.840 --> 07:01.360
 hormones, and other things that are in your blood and DNA,

07:01.360 --> 07:03.120
 you don't know what to optimize.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.900
 With Inside Tracker, it makes all of that very easy.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.120
 They can come to your house to take the blood and DNA test,

07:08.120 --> 07:10.220
 or you can go to a nearby clinic.

07:10.220 --> 07:11.840
 They send you the information

07:11.840 --> 07:13.080
 and you take those results.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.200
 And unlike a lot of laboratories

07:15.200 --> 07:17.440
 doing blood work out there and DNA tests,

07:17.440 --> 07:18.580
 they have a simple platform,

07:18.580 --> 07:21.560
 a dashboard that walks you through your results

07:21.560 --> 07:23.960
 and helps you identify what sorts of nutritional

07:23.960 --> 07:26.280
 or behavioral or other types of practices

07:26.280 --> 07:28.000
 you might want to incorporate into your life

07:28.000 --> 07:29.880
 in order to positively impact

07:29.880 --> 07:31.880
 your immediate and long-term health.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.580
 It's a very easy system to use,

07:33.580 --> 07:35.160
 and you will gain a ton of information

07:35.160 --> 07:36.340
 simply by doing that test,

07:36.340 --> 07:37.720
 whether or not you end up making changes

07:37.720 --> 07:39.500
 to what you're doing or not.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.320
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

07:41.320 --> 07:44.360
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

07:50.000 --> 07:52.760
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.200
 Headspace is a meditation app backed by 25 published studies

07:56.200 --> 07:59.480
 and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

07:59.480 --> 08:01.080
 I've been meditating for a long time,

08:01.080 --> 08:03.680
 but I confess sometimes I meditate

08:03.680 --> 08:07.000
 and sometimes I am very inconsistent about my meditation.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.500
 Ideally, I would meditate every day for 20 or 30 minutes,

08:10.500 --> 08:11.960
 but what I've found over the years

08:11.960 --> 08:14.080
 is that I'll start a meditation practice

08:14.080 --> 08:17.600
 and then as life gets more stressful or busier,

08:17.600 --> 08:19.660
 which is exactly when I need to meditate more,

08:19.660 --> 08:22.000
 I tend to meditate less often.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.100
 Switching over to Headspace as a meditation app

08:24.100 --> 08:25.680
 really helped me stay consistent

08:25.680 --> 08:27.260
 with my meditation practice.

08:27.260 --> 08:30.320
 And that's because they have a huge range of meditations

08:30.320 --> 08:31.160
 to select from.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.180
 Some are short, some are longer.

08:33.180 --> 08:36.160
 And in general, I try and get 20 minutes of meditation

08:36.160 --> 08:38.280
 in every day, but some days it's just five minutes

08:38.280 --> 08:40.900
 and they have some terrific, just five-minute meditations.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.560
 The science says that even a five-minute meditation

08:43.560 --> 08:45.680
 can be beneficial for different aspects

08:45.680 --> 08:47.760
 of our brain and body.

08:47.760 --> 08:48.840
 If you want to try Headspace,

08:48.840 --> 08:52.000
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.360
 I'd like to announce that there's an event

09:12.360 --> 09:14.700
 that some of you may find very useful.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.680
 This is an event put on by Logitech

09:16.680 --> 09:18.360
 that I will be speaking at.

09:18.360 --> 09:22.160
 It's called Rethink Education, The Biology of Learning,

09:22.160 --> 09:24.320
 Reimagining Learning Through Neuroscience.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.160
 And at this event, I will be speaking,

09:26.160 --> 09:27.760
 there will be other speakers as well.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.080
 And I will be talking about neuroplasticity

09:30.080 --> 09:33.120
 and its applications for teaching and for learning.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.000
 I will describe what I call the plasticity super protocol

09:36.000 --> 09:39.800
 that incorporates all of what we know about rapid learning,

09:39.800 --> 09:42.880
 efficient learning, and the best ways to teach and learn.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.160
 It's geared towards educators of all kinds.

09:45.160 --> 09:46.600
 It is zero cost.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.480
 So please feel free to sign up.

09:48.480 --> 09:53.480
 The event is September 30th, 2021 at 3 PM Eastern.

09:54.040 --> 09:56.000
 You can find the registration link

09:56.000 --> 09:58.260
 in the caption for this episode.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.000
 So let's talk about dopamine.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.560
 Most people have heard of dopamine

10:01.560 --> 10:04.240
 and we hear all the time now about dopamine hits,

10:04.240 --> 10:08.260
 but actually there's no such thing as a dopamine hit.

10:08.260 --> 10:12.220
 And actually the way that your body uses dopamine

10:12.220 --> 10:15.520
 is to have a baseline level of dopamine,

10:15.520 --> 10:17.120
 meaning an amount of dopamine

10:17.120 --> 10:20.320
 that's circulating in your brain and body all the time.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.840
 And that turns out to be important

10:21.840 --> 10:23.560
 for how you feel generally,

10:23.560 --> 10:26.760
 whether or not you're in a good mood, motivated, et cetera.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.080
 And you also can experience peaks

10:29.080 --> 10:31.520
 in dopamine above baseline.

10:31.520 --> 10:35.280
 This has a very specific name in the neurobiology literature,

10:35.280 --> 10:39.360
 so-called tonic and phasic release of dopamine.

10:39.360 --> 10:41.420
 And I'll explain what that means in a couple of minutes.

10:41.420 --> 10:44.360
 But if you remember nothing else from this episode,

10:44.360 --> 10:48.400
 please remember this, that when you experience something

10:48.400 --> 10:51.760
 or you crave something really desirable,

10:51.760 --> 10:54.300
 really exciting to you, very pleasurable,

10:55.280 --> 10:58.400
 what happens afterwards is your baseline level

10:58.400 --> 11:00.720
 of dopamine drops, okay?

11:00.720 --> 11:03.320
 So these peaks in dopamine,

11:03.320 --> 11:05.120
 they influence how much dopamine

11:05.120 --> 11:07.380
 will generally be circulating afterward.

11:07.380 --> 11:09.340
 And you might think, oh, a big peak in dopamine,

11:09.340 --> 11:11.320
 after that, I'm going to feel even better

11:11.320 --> 11:13.400
 because I just had this great event.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.720
 Not the case, what actually happens

11:15.720 --> 11:18.240
 is that your baseline level of dopamine drops.

11:18.240 --> 11:21.360
 And I will explain the precise mechanism for that, okay?

11:21.360 --> 11:23.360
 In the neuroscience literature,

11:23.360 --> 11:28.360
 we refer to this as tonic and phasic release of dopamine.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.240
 Tonic being the low level baseline

11:32.240 --> 11:34.920
 that's always there circulating,

11:34.920 --> 11:37.240
 released into your brain all the time.

11:37.240 --> 11:41.440
 And then phasic, these peaks that ride above that baseline.

11:41.440 --> 11:43.160
 And those two things interact.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.960
 And this is really important.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.500
 I'm going to teach you the underlying neurobiology,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.420
 but even if you have no background in biology,

11:48.420 --> 11:49.660
 I promise to make it all clear.

11:49.660 --> 11:52.020
 I'll explain the terms and what they mean.

11:52.020 --> 11:54.240
 And I'm excited to teach you about dopamine

11:54.240 --> 11:56.320
 because dopamine has everything to do

11:56.320 --> 11:59.080
 with how you feel right now as you're listening to this.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.300
 It has everything to do with how you will feel

12:01.300 --> 12:02.600
 an hour from now,

12:02.600 --> 12:04.880
 has everything to do with your level of motivation

12:04.880 --> 12:06.320
 and your level of desire

12:06.320 --> 12:08.860
 and your willingness to push through effort.

12:08.860 --> 12:10.880
 If ever you've interacted with somebody

12:10.880 --> 12:14.640
 who just doesn't seem to have any drive they've given up,

12:14.640 --> 12:16.120
 or if you've interacted with somebody

12:16.120 --> 12:18.880
 who seems to have endless drive and energy,

12:18.880 --> 12:22.040
 what you are looking at there in those two circumstances

12:22.040 --> 12:25.240
 is without question a difference

12:25.240 --> 12:28.920
 in the level of dopamine circulating in their system.

12:28.920 --> 12:30.840
 There will be other factors too,

12:30.840 --> 12:34.840
 but the level of dopamine is the primary determinant

12:34.840 --> 12:37.880
 of how motivated we are, how excited we are,

12:37.880 --> 12:39.360
 how outward facing we are,

12:39.360 --> 12:43.160
 and how willing we are to lean into life and pursue things.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.480
 Dopamine is what we call a neuromodulator.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.080
 Neuromodulators are different than neurotransmitters.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.600
 Neurotransmitters are involved in the dialogue

12:50.600 --> 12:52.680
 between neurons, nerve cells,

12:52.680 --> 12:56.260
 and neurotransmitters tend to mediate local communication.

12:56.260 --> 12:59.220
 Just imagine two people talking to one another at a concert.

12:59.220 --> 13:01.820
 That communication between them is analogous

13:01.820 --> 13:05.120
 to the communication carried out by neurotransmitters,

13:05.120 --> 13:08.560
 whereas neuromodulators influence the communication

13:08.560 --> 13:09.600
 of many neurons.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.240
 Imagine a bunch of people dancing

13:11.240 --> 13:12.560
 where it's a coordinated dance

13:12.560 --> 13:15.480
 involving 10 or 20 or hundreds of people.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.440
 Neuromodulators are coordinating that dance.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.940
 In the nervous system, what this means

13:19.940 --> 13:23.240
 is that dopamine release changes the probability

13:23.240 --> 13:25.360
 that certain neural circuits will be active

13:26.280 --> 13:29.880
 and that other neural circuits will be inactive, okay?

13:29.880 --> 13:33.000
 So it modulates a bunch of things all at once,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.160
 and that's why it's so powerful

13:34.160 --> 13:36.240
 at shifting not just our levels of energy,

13:36.240 --> 13:37.960
 but also our mindset,

13:37.960 --> 13:41.720
 also our feelings of whether or not we can

13:41.720 --> 13:44.400
 or cannot accomplish something.

13:44.400 --> 13:46.720
 So how does dopamine work and what does it do?

13:46.720 --> 13:50.120
 Well, first of all, it is not just responsible for pleasure.

13:50.120 --> 13:53.240
 It is responsible for motivation and drive primarily

13:53.240 --> 13:55.920
 at the psychological level, also for craving.

13:55.920 --> 13:57.560
 Those three things are sort of the same,

13:57.560 --> 13:59.200
 motivation, drive, and craving.

13:59.200 --> 14:01.160
 It also controls time perception,

14:01.160 --> 14:03.920
 and we will get deep into how dopamine

14:03.920 --> 14:07.600
 can modulate time perception and how important it is

14:07.600 --> 14:12.040
 that everybody be able to access increases in dopamine

14:12.040 --> 14:13.480
 at different timescales.

14:13.480 --> 14:14.720
 This turns out to be important

14:14.720 --> 14:16.720
 to not end up addicted to substances,

14:16.720 --> 14:18.980
 but it also turns out to be very important

14:18.980 --> 14:21.120
 to sustain effort and be a happy person

14:21.120 --> 14:22.400
 over long periods of time,

14:22.400 --> 14:24.680
 which I think most everybody wants.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.880
 It certainly is adaptive in life to be able to do that.

14:27.880 --> 14:31.260
 Dopamine is also vitally important for movement.

14:31.260 --> 14:35.000
 I'll explain the neural circuits for dopamine and mindset

14:35.000 --> 14:37.540
 and dopamine and movement in a moment,

14:37.540 --> 14:42.540
 but in diseases like Parkinson's or Lewy's body's dementia,

14:42.540 --> 14:45.780
 which is similar to Parkinson's in many ways,

14:45.780 --> 14:48.220
 there's a depletion or death of dopamine neurons

14:48.220 --> 14:50.160
 at a particular location in the brain,

14:50.160 --> 14:54.420
 which leads to shaky movements, challenges in speaking,

14:54.420 --> 14:57.580
 challenges in particular in initiating movement.

14:57.580 --> 15:01.620
 And because dopamine is depleted elsewhere too,

15:01.620 --> 15:04.380
 people with Parkinson's and Lewy's, excuse me,

15:04.380 --> 15:08.420
 Lewy body dementia also experience drops in motivation

15:08.420 --> 15:10.140
 and affect, meaning mood.

15:10.140 --> 15:12.780
 They tend to get depressed and so on.

15:12.780 --> 15:15.380
 When those people are properly treated,

15:15.380 --> 15:17.300
 they can, not always,

15:17.300 --> 15:20.340
 but they can recover some fluidity of movement,

15:20.340 --> 15:22.140
 some ability to initiate movement.

15:22.140 --> 15:23.980
 And almost without question,

15:23.980 --> 15:26.820
 those people feel better psychologically,

15:26.820 --> 15:28.020
 not just because they can move,

15:28.020 --> 15:31.660
 but also because dopamine impacts mood and motivation.

15:31.660 --> 15:35.420
 So what are the underlying neural circuits?

15:35.420 --> 15:38.020
 For those of you that are not interested in biology

15:38.020 --> 15:39.100
 and specific nomenclature,

15:39.100 --> 15:40.860
 you can tune out now if you want,

15:40.860 --> 15:42.620
 but it's actually pretty straightforward.

15:42.620 --> 15:45.580
 You have two main neural circuits in the brain

15:45.580 --> 15:50.580
 that dopamine uses in order to exert all its effects.

15:50.700 --> 15:54.540
 The first one is a pathway that goes from this area

15:54.540 --> 15:56.820
 in the what's called the ventral tegmentum.

15:56.820 --> 15:58.940
 That's a fancy, but ventral just means bottom

15:58.940 --> 16:01.060
 and tegmentum actually means floor.

16:01.060 --> 16:02.860
 So it's at the bottom of the brain

16:02.860 --> 16:04.540
 and it's the ventral part of the floor.

16:04.540 --> 16:06.300
 So it's really low in the back of the brain,

16:06.300 --> 16:09.780
 the ventral tegmentum, and it goes from

16:09.780 --> 16:12.660
 the ventral tegmentum to what's called

16:12.660 --> 16:15.340
 the ventral striatum and the prefrontal cortex.

16:15.340 --> 16:16.500
 Now that's a lot of language,

16:16.500 --> 16:17.820
 but basically what we call this

16:17.820 --> 16:20.260
 is the mesocorticolimbic pathway.

16:20.260 --> 16:25.220
 This is the pathway by which dopamine influences motivation,

16:25.220 --> 16:27.220
 drive, and craving.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.740
 It involves structures that some of you

16:28.740 --> 16:29.620
 may have heard of before,

16:29.620 --> 16:32.900
 things like nucleus accumbens and the prefrontal cortex.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.620
 This is the pathway that really gets disrupted

16:35.620 --> 16:39.300
 in addictions where in particular drugs

16:39.300 --> 16:41.180
 that influence the release of dopamine,

16:41.180 --> 16:42.580
 like cocaine and methamphetamine,

16:42.580 --> 16:44.060
 we'll talk about those drugs today,

16:44.060 --> 16:45.580
 they tap into this pathway.

16:45.580 --> 16:49.460
 But if you are pursuing a partner,

16:49.460 --> 16:50.420
 a boyfriend or girlfriend,

16:50.420 --> 16:52.400
 if you're pursuing a degree in school,

16:52.400 --> 16:54.780
 if you're pursuing a finish line in a race,

16:54.780 --> 16:58.340
 you are tapping into the so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.

16:58.340 --> 17:03.340
 This is the classic reward pathway in all mammals.

17:03.340 --> 17:06.820
 The other pathway emerges from an area in the brain

17:06.820 --> 17:08.660
 called the substantia nigra,

17:08.660 --> 17:13.560
 so-called because the cells in that area are dark

17:13.560 --> 17:17.060
 and the substantia nigra connects to an area of the brain

17:17.060 --> 17:18.420
 called the dorsal striatum.

17:18.420 --> 17:22.480
 This is not surprisingly called the nigrostriatal pathway.

17:22.480 --> 17:24.460
 For those of you who have never done any neuroanatomy,

17:24.460 --> 17:26.340
 I'm going to teach you a little trick right now.

17:26.340 --> 17:27.720
 Everything in neuroanatomy,

17:27.720 --> 17:32.420
 the first part of a word tells you where the neurons are.

17:32.420 --> 17:33.580
 And then the second part tells you

17:33.580 --> 17:34.760
 where they are connecting to.

17:34.760 --> 17:37.300
 So when I say nigrostriatal pathway,

17:37.300 --> 17:39.360
 it means that the neurons are in the substantia nigra

17:39.360 --> 17:42.520
 and they connect to the striatum, nigrostriatal pathway.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.500
 So while it's a lot of language, there is some logic there.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.660
 Okay, so we've got these two pathways,

17:47.660 --> 17:49.860
 one mainly for movement, right?

17:49.860 --> 17:53.020
 This is the substantia nigra to dorsal striatum.

17:53.020 --> 17:55.620
 And we've got this other pathway,

17:55.620 --> 17:57.280
 the so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway

17:57.280 --> 17:59.920
 that's for reward reinforcement and motivation.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.740
 I want you to remember that there are two pathways.

18:03.740 --> 18:05.940
 If you don't remember the two pathways in detail,

18:05.940 --> 18:06.780
 that's fine.

18:06.780 --> 18:08.740
 But please remember that there are two pathways

18:08.740 --> 18:10.620
 because that turns out to be important later.

18:10.620 --> 18:12.700
 Now, the other thing to understand about dopamine

18:12.700 --> 18:16.180
 is that the way that dopamine is released

18:16.180 --> 18:19.460
 in the brain and body can differ,

18:19.460 --> 18:24.460
 meaning it can be very local or it can be more broad.

18:24.660 --> 18:27.460
 Now, most of you have probably heard of synapses.

18:27.460 --> 18:30.620
 Synapses are the little spaces between neurons

18:30.620 --> 18:31.720
 and basically neurons,

18:31.720 --> 18:33.860
 nerve cells communicate with one another

18:33.860 --> 18:36.280
 by making each other electrically active

18:36.280 --> 18:39.780
 or by making each other less electrically active.

18:39.780 --> 18:40.620
 So here's how this works.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.080
 You can imagine one nerve cell and another nerve cell

18:43.080 --> 18:45.660
 with a little gap between them, a little synapse.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.760
 And the way that one nerve cell

18:47.760 --> 18:49.860
 causes the next nerve cell to fire,

18:49.860 --> 18:52.580
 what we call fire really means to become electrically active

18:52.580 --> 18:55.500
 is that it vomits out these little packets,

18:55.500 --> 18:56.440
 what we call vesicles.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.900
 They're little bubbles filled with a chemical.

18:58.900 --> 19:01.720
 When that chemical enters the synapse,

19:01.720 --> 19:04.960
 some of it docks or parks on the other side

19:04.960 --> 19:06.300
 in the other neuron.

19:06.300 --> 19:09.320
 And by virtue of electrical changes

19:09.320 --> 19:12.380
 in what we call the postsynaptic neuron,

19:12.380 --> 19:14.460
 that chemical will make that neuron

19:14.460 --> 19:17.540
 more electrically active or less electrically active.

19:17.540 --> 19:20.940
 Dopamine can do that like any other neurotransmitter

19:20.940 --> 19:22.440
 or neuromodulator.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.960
 So it can have one neuron influence another neuron,

19:25.960 --> 19:28.220
 but dopamine can also engage

19:28.220 --> 19:30.460
 in what's called a volumetric release.

19:30.460 --> 19:33.580
 Volumetric release is like a giant vomit

19:33.580 --> 19:37.820
 that gets out to 50 or a hundred or even thousands of cells.

19:37.820 --> 19:40.460
 So there's local release, what we call synaptic release,

19:40.460 --> 19:41.940
 and then there's volumetric release.

19:41.940 --> 19:44.720
 So volumetric release is like dumping all this dopamine

19:44.720 --> 19:46.260
 out into the system.

19:46.260 --> 19:50.180
 So dopamine is incredible because it can change the way

19:50.180 --> 19:52.860
 that our neural circuits work at a local scale

19:52.860 --> 19:54.780
 and at a very broad scale.

19:54.780 --> 19:57.300
 And for those of you that are only interested in tools,

19:57.300 --> 19:59.120
 like how do I get more dopamine?

19:59.120 --> 20:01.740
 Let me tell you, this part is really important

20:01.740 --> 20:05.620
 because if you were to take a drug or supplement

20:05.620 --> 20:07.580
 that increases your level of dopamine,

20:07.580 --> 20:11.700
 you are influencing both the local release of dopamine

20:11.700 --> 20:13.860
 and volumetric release.

20:13.860 --> 20:16.160
 This relates back to the baseline of dopamine

20:16.160 --> 20:18.900
 and the big peak above baseline.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.500
 And that turns out to be important.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.180
 And I'll just allude to why it's important.

20:23.180 --> 20:26.700
 Many drugs and indeed many supplements

20:26.700 --> 20:31.060
 that increase dopamine will actually make it harder

20:31.060 --> 20:33.080
 for you to sustain dopamine release

20:33.080 --> 20:36.480
 over long periods of time and to achieve those peaks

20:36.480 --> 20:39.660
 that most of us are craving when we are in pursuit of things.

20:39.660 --> 20:40.640
 Why?

20:40.640 --> 20:43.540
 Because if you get both volumetric release,

20:43.540 --> 20:45.340
 the dumping out of dopamine everywhere,

20:45.340 --> 20:47.220
 and you're getting local release,

20:47.220 --> 20:48.780
 what it means is that the difference

20:48.780 --> 20:52.820
 between the peak and baseline is likely to be smaller.

20:52.820 --> 20:57.820
 And this is very important, how satisfying or exciting

20:57.820 --> 21:00.700
 or pleasureful a given experience is

21:00.700 --> 21:03.880
 doesn't just depend on the height of that peak.

21:03.880 --> 21:05.820
 It depends on the height of that peak

21:05.820 --> 21:08.060
 relative to the baseline.

21:08.060 --> 21:12.360
 So if you increase the baseline and you increase the peak,

21:12.360 --> 21:13.660
 you're not going to achieve

21:13.660 --> 21:15.760
 more and more pleasure from things.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.840
 I'll talk about how to leverage this information

21:18.840 --> 21:22.780
 in a little bit, but just increasing your dopamine

21:22.780 --> 21:25.220
 yes, it will make you excited for all things.

21:25.220 --> 21:26.960
 It will make you feel very motivated,

21:26.960 --> 21:31.220
 but it will also make that motivation very short lived.

21:31.220 --> 21:34.700
 So there's a better way to increase your dopamine.

21:34.700 --> 21:36.260
 There's a better way to optimize

21:36.260 --> 21:38.260
 this peak to baseline ratio.

21:38.260 --> 21:41.140
 For now what we've talked about is two main neural circuits,

21:41.140 --> 21:42.980
 one for movement and one for motivation

21:42.980 --> 21:45.040
 and craving with dopamine.

21:45.040 --> 21:47.880
 And we've talked about two main modes of communication

21:47.880 --> 21:50.460
 between neurons with dopamine.

21:50.460 --> 21:52.920
 One is this local synaptic release.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.500
 One is more volumetric release.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.580
 And in the back of your mind,

21:57.580 --> 21:59.200
 you can relate this back to again,

21:59.200 --> 22:02.220
 this baseline versus peaks above baseline.

22:02.220 --> 22:03.980
 So that's a description of what we would call

22:03.980 --> 22:08.920
 the spatial effects or the spatial aspects of dopamine.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.120
 I said, this connects to that, that connects to this.

22:11.120 --> 22:13.920
 You can get local or more broad volumetric release.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.140
 What about the duration of release

22:16.140 --> 22:19.020
 or the duration of action for dopamine?

22:19.020 --> 22:23.300
 Well, dopamine is unique among chemicals in the brain

22:23.300 --> 22:26.620
 because dopamine, unlike a lot of chemicals in the brain,

22:26.620 --> 22:29.460
 works through what are called G protein coupled receptors.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.100
 And for those of you that are about to pass out

22:31.100 --> 22:32.980
 from the amount of detail, just hang in there with me.

22:32.980 --> 22:34.980
 It's really not complicated.

22:34.980 --> 22:38.260
 There are two ways that neurons can communicate

22:38.260 --> 22:39.500
 or mainly two ways.

22:39.500 --> 22:40.660
 There are a third and a fourth,

22:40.660 --> 22:45.620
 but mostly neurons communicate by two modes.

22:45.620 --> 22:48.980
 One are what we call fast electrical synapses.

22:48.980 --> 22:51.380
 Ionotropic conduction, all right?

22:51.380 --> 22:52.260
 You don't need to know what that means,

22:52.260 --> 22:56.300
 but basically one neuron activates another neuron

22:56.300 --> 23:00.700
 and little holes open up in that neuron and ions rush in.

23:00.700 --> 23:03.820
 Sodium is the main ion, salt,

23:03.820 --> 23:06.700
 by which one neuron influences the electrical activity

23:06.700 --> 23:09.980
 of another neuron because sodium ions contain a charge.

23:09.980 --> 23:12.460
 Okay, there are other things like chloride and potassium.

23:12.460 --> 23:14.900
 If you're interested in looking this up, just look up.

23:14.900 --> 23:17.180
 Ionic conductance is in the action potential,

23:17.180 --> 23:18.700
 or I could do a post on it sometime

23:18.700 --> 23:20.540
 and we could go into detail,

23:20.540 --> 23:22.000
 but just understand that when neurons

23:22.000 --> 23:23.400
 want to influence each other,

23:23.400 --> 23:26.520
 they can do it by way of this fast ionotropic conduction.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.820
 This is a really quick way

23:28.820 --> 23:31.900
 for one neuron to influence the next.

23:31.900 --> 23:34.220
 Dopamine doesn't communicate that way.

23:34.220 --> 23:35.700
 Dopamine is slower.

23:35.700 --> 23:36.620
 It works through what are called

23:36.620 --> 23:38.520
 G protein coupled receptors.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.580
 So what happens is dopamine is released

23:40.580 --> 23:42.560
 in these little vesicles that I've mentioned before,

23:42.560 --> 23:45.020
 get vomited out into the synapse.

23:45.020 --> 23:47.300
 Some of that dopamine will bind

23:47.300 --> 23:49.420
 to the so-called postsynaptic neuron.

23:49.420 --> 23:50.740
 It'll bind to the next neuron.

23:50.740 --> 23:53.300
 And then it sets off a cascade.

23:53.300 --> 23:54.700
 It's kind of like a bucket brigade

23:54.700 --> 23:56.580
 of one thing getting handed off to the next,

23:56.580 --> 23:58.020
 to the next, to the next.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.380
 It's G protein coupled receptors.

24:00.380 --> 24:02.140
 And anytime you hear about these GPCRs

24:02.140 --> 24:04.380
 or G protein coupled receptors,

24:04.380 --> 24:06.620
 pay attention because they're really interesting.

24:06.620 --> 24:07.880
 They're slow,

24:07.880 --> 24:11.120
 but they also can have multiple cascades of effects.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.340
 They can impact even gene expression at some level.

24:14.340 --> 24:17.220
 They can change what a cell actually becomes.

24:17.220 --> 24:20.100
 They can change how well or how poorly

24:20.100 --> 24:23.960
 that cell will respond to the same signal in the future.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.740
 So dopamine works through the slower process,

24:26.740 --> 24:28.420
 these G protein coupled receptors.

24:28.420 --> 24:32.780
 And so its effects tend to take a while in order to occur.

24:34.260 --> 24:37.800
 This aspect of dopamine transmission is important

24:37.800 --> 24:39.460
 because it now underscores two things.

24:39.460 --> 24:42.500
 One, there's two pathways for dopamine to communicate,

24:42.500 --> 24:44.660
 one for movement, one for motivation and craving.

24:44.660 --> 24:49.020
 There's two spatial scales at which dopamine can operate

24:49.020 --> 24:51.220
 synaptically or volumetrically.

24:51.220 --> 24:56.220
 And dopamine can have slow effects, really slow effects,

24:56.220 --> 24:58.280
 or even very long lasting effects.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.860
 And it even can control gene expression.

25:00.860 --> 25:03.460
 It can actually change the way that cells behave.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.520
 One thing that's not often discussed about dopamine,

25:05.520 --> 25:07.900
 but is extremely important to know

25:07.900 --> 25:11.040
 is that dopamine doesn't work on its own.

25:11.040 --> 25:15.880
 Neurons that release dopamine co-release glutamate.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.540
 Glutamate is a neurotransmitter,

25:18.540 --> 25:21.200
 and it's a neurotransmitter that is excitatory,

25:21.200 --> 25:24.760
 meaning it stimulates neurons to be electrically active.

25:24.760 --> 25:28.700
 So now, even if you don't know any cell biology,

25:28.700 --> 25:29.940
 you should start to gain a picture

25:29.940 --> 25:32.560
 that dopamine is responsible for movement,

25:32.560 --> 25:34.340
 motivation, and drive.

25:34.340 --> 25:35.740
 It does that through two pathways,

25:35.740 --> 25:39.680
 but also the dopamine stimulates action in general

25:39.680 --> 25:41.980
 because it releases this excitatory neurotransmitter.

25:41.980 --> 25:45.900
 It tends to make certain neurons that are nearby,

25:45.900 --> 25:48.260
 or even that are far away because of volumetric release,

25:48.260 --> 25:50.080
 it tends to make those more active.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.260
 So dopamine is really stimulating.

25:52.260 --> 25:56.340
 And indeed, we say that dopaminergic transmission

25:56.340 --> 26:00.620
 or dopamine tends to stimulate sympathetic arousal.

26:00.620 --> 26:02.700
 Sympathetic doesn't have anything to do with sympathy.

26:02.700 --> 26:05.260
 It's just simply means that it tends

26:05.260 --> 26:07.300
 to increase our levels of alertness.

26:07.300 --> 26:09.700
 It tends to bring an animal or a human

26:09.700 --> 26:12.880
 into a state of more alertness, readiness,

26:12.880 --> 26:16.300
 and desire to pursue things outside the confines

26:16.300 --> 26:17.400
 of its skin.

26:17.400 --> 26:21.040
 So if I were to just put a really simple message

26:21.040 --> 26:22.820
 around dopamine, it would be,

26:22.820 --> 26:24.880
 there's a molecule in your brain and body

26:24.880 --> 26:29.880
 that when released tends to make you look outside yourself,

26:30.120 --> 26:32.620
 pursue things outside yourself,

26:32.620 --> 26:35.760
 and to crave things outside yourself.

26:35.760 --> 26:39.080
 The pleasure that arrives from achieving things

26:39.080 --> 26:40.460
 also involves dopamine,

26:40.460 --> 26:43.820
 but is mainly the consequence of other molecules.

26:43.820 --> 26:46.600
 But if ever you felt lethargic and like just lazy

26:46.600 --> 26:48.280
 and you had no motivation or drive,

26:48.280 --> 26:50.480
 that's a low dopamine state.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.960
 If ever you felt really excited, motivated,

26:52.960 --> 26:55.680
 even if you were a little scared to do something,

26:55.680 --> 26:57.040
 maybe you did your first skydive

26:57.040 --> 26:59.000
 or you're about to do your first skydive

26:59.000 --> 27:00.480
 or you're about to do some public speaking

27:00.480 --> 27:02.820
 and you really don't want to screw it up,

27:02.820 --> 27:05.600
 you are in a high dopamine state.

27:05.600 --> 27:08.880
 Dopamine is a universal currency in all mammals,

27:08.880 --> 27:13.680
 but especially in humans for moving us toward goals

27:13.680 --> 27:17.640
 and how much dopamine is in our system at any one time

27:17.640 --> 27:20.520
 compared to how much dopamine was in our system

27:20.520 --> 27:24.220
 a few minutes ago and how much we remember

27:24.220 --> 27:27.740
 enjoying a particular experience of the past.

27:27.740 --> 27:30.740
 That dictates your so-called quality of life

27:30.740 --> 27:33.260
 and your desire to pursue things.

27:33.260 --> 27:34.180
 This is really important.

27:34.180 --> 27:36.280
 Dopamine is a currency

27:36.280 --> 27:38.600
 and it's the way that you track pleasure.

27:38.600 --> 27:40.360
 It's the way that you track success.

27:40.360 --> 27:42.520
 It's the way that you track whether or not

27:42.520 --> 27:44.920
 you are doing well or doing poorly.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.000
 And that is subjective.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.340
 But if your dopamine is too low,

27:50.340 --> 27:52.000
 you will not feel motivated.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.360
 If your dopamine is really high, you will feel motivated.

27:55.360 --> 27:57.760
 And if your dopamine is somewhere in the middle,

27:57.760 --> 27:59.680
 how you feel depends on whether or not

27:59.680 --> 28:02.720
 you had higher dopamine a few minutes ago

28:02.720 --> 28:04.240
 or lower dopamine.

28:04.240 --> 28:05.760
 This is important.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.800
 Your experience of life and your level of motivation

28:08.800 --> 28:13.480
 and drive depends on how much dopamine you have

28:13.480 --> 28:17.080
 relative to your recent experience.

28:17.080 --> 28:20.560
 This is, again, something that's just not accounted for

28:20.560 --> 28:23.760
 in the simple language of dopamine hits, okay?

28:23.760 --> 28:26.860
 A simple way to envision dopamine hits

28:26.860 --> 28:28.320
 is every time you do something you like,

28:28.320 --> 28:29.920
 you eat a piece of chocolate, dopamine hit.

28:29.920 --> 28:31.640
 You look at your Instagram, dopamine hit.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.280
 You see someone you like, dopamine hit.

28:34.280 --> 28:37.540
 All these things described as dopamine hits

28:37.540 --> 28:40.640
 neglect the fact that if you scroll social media

28:40.640 --> 28:43.740
 and you see something you really like, dopamine hit.

28:43.740 --> 28:45.800
 Sure, there's an increase in dopamine.

28:45.800 --> 28:48.320
 But then you get to something else and you go,

28:48.320 --> 28:49.680
 hmm, not that interesting.

28:49.680 --> 28:53.520
 However, had you arrived at that second thing first,

28:53.520 --> 28:55.880
 you might think that it was really interesting.

28:56.780 --> 28:59.540
 If you had arrived to that second Instagram post

28:59.540 --> 29:01.560
 three days later or four days later,

29:01.560 --> 29:03.940
 you might find it extremely interesting.

29:03.940 --> 29:07.260
 Again, how much dopamine you experience from something

29:07.260 --> 29:09.320
 depends on your baseline level of dopamine

29:09.320 --> 29:14.320
 when you arrive there and your previous dopamine peaks, okay?

29:14.680 --> 29:16.600
 That's super important to understand.

29:16.600 --> 29:18.120
 And it's completely neglected

29:18.120 --> 29:20.180
 by the general language of dopamine hits.

29:20.180 --> 29:23.680
 This is why when you repeatedly engage in something

29:23.680 --> 29:27.140
 that you enjoy, your threshold for enjoyment

29:27.140 --> 29:29.040
 goes up and up and up.

29:29.040 --> 29:30.960
 So I want to talk about that process

29:30.960 --> 29:33.060
 and I want to explain how that process works

29:33.060 --> 29:34.840
 because if you understand that process

29:34.840 --> 29:37.760
 and you understand some of these schedules and kinetics

29:37.760 --> 29:39.000
 as we call them around dopamine,

29:39.000 --> 29:40.840
 you will be in a terrific position

29:40.840 --> 29:44.560
 to use any dopamine enhancing tools that you decide to use.

29:44.560 --> 29:46.860
 You'll be in an excellent position to modulate

29:46.860 --> 29:48.760
 and control your own dopamine release

29:48.760 --> 29:50.960
 for optimal motivation and drive.

29:50.960 --> 29:53.360
 I realized that was a lot of information

29:53.360 --> 29:55.000
 about the biology of dopamine,

29:55.000 --> 29:56.480
 sort of like trying to make you drink

29:56.480 --> 29:59.280
 from the fire hose of dopamine biology.

29:59.280 --> 30:01.360
 However, I realized that some people probably want

30:01.360 --> 30:03.880
 even more information about the biology

30:03.880 --> 30:05.720
 of dopamine transmission.

30:05.720 --> 30:07.240
 If you're interested in that,

30:07.240 --> 30:09.840
 I'll post a link to a absolutely stellar review

30:09.840 --> 30:12.360
 that was published in Nature Reviews Neuroscience

30:12.360 --> 30:15.480
 called Spatial and Temporal Scales of Dopamine Transmission.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.240
 It is quite detailed, but they have beautiful diagrams

30:18.240 --> 30:20.280
 and can walk you through all the things

30:20.280 --> 30:22.680
 that I just described and get into even more detail.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.300
 We'll put a link to that in the caption on YouTube.

30:25.300 --> 30:29.380
 Right now, I want to share with you two anecdotes,

30:29.380 --> 30:34.220
 one from my own life and one from some fairly recent history

30:34.220 --> 30:38.140
 that illustrate some of the core biology of dopamine

30:38.140 --> 30:41.560
 and how profoundly it can shape our experience.

30:41.560 --> 30:45.980
 The first one is a really tragic situation that occurred.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.300
 This was in the 80s.

30:49.300 --> 30:52.780
 There was a outbreak of what looked like

30:52.780 --> 30:56.300
 Parkinsonian symptoms in a young population.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.200
 So many of you heard of Parkinson's disease.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.260
 Parkinson's disease is a disease

31:00.260 --> 31:03.660
 in which people initially start to quake,

31:03.660 --> 31:05.080
 can't generate smooth movements.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.300
 They'll have issues with speech,

31:06.300 --> 31:08.540
 sometimes cognition as well.

31:08.540 --> 31:10.940
 There are examples like Michael J. Fox,

31:10.940 --> 31:13.500
 which are kind of early onset Parkinson's.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.660
 Typically, it hits people a little bit later in life.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.240
 There's a genetic component,

31:19.620 --> 31:22.060
 but there is this question

31:22.060 --> 31:23.180
 and there's always been this question

31:23.180 --> 31:25.260
 whether or not certain lifestyle factors

31:25.260 --> 31:27.580
 can also create Parkinson's.

31:27.580 --> 31:29.740
 And some years ago,

31:29.740 --> 31:33.580
 there was a situation where a laboratory,

31:33.580 --> 31:37.020
 street laboratories, illicit laboratories,

31:37.020 --> 31:39.980
 were trying to make a drug called MPPP,

31:39.980 --> 31:41.780
 which is an opioid-like compound.

31:41.780 --> 31:46.780
 It's a bit like heroin and heroin addicts seeking heroin

31:47.260 --> 31:50.680
 went out and bought what they thought was MPPP.

31:50.680 --> 31:55.680
 Unfortunately, it was not MPPP.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.000
 I mean, it would have been tragic if it was anyway,

31:58.000 --> 31:59.200
 because they were drug addicts,

31:59.200 --> 32:02.280
 but what they ended up taking turned out to be a lot worse.

32:02.280 --> 32:05.740
 What they ended up taking was MPTP,

32:05.740 --> 32:10.740
 and MPTP can arise in the synthesis of MPPP.

32:10.740 --> 32:12.680
 So someone in a lab someplace,

32:12.680 --> 32:14.660
 this was mainly in the Central Valley in California,

32:14.660 --> 32:16.820
 but elsewhere as well,

32:16.820 --> 32:20.160
 somebody created MPTP.

32:20.160 --> 32:23.820
 And what ended up happening was a large number

32:23.820 --> 32:26.800
 of young people who were opioid addicts

32:26.800 --> 32:30.240
 became completely boxed in, paralyzed,

32:30.240 --> 32:34.240
 couldn't speak, couldn't blink, couldn't do anything,

32:34.240 --> 32:35.800
 couldn't function, couldn't move.

32:35.800 --> 32:40.800
 So both aspects of dopamine transmission were disrupted.

32:40.940 --> 32:43.300
 They had no motivation and drive.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.740
 They couldn't generate any movement of any kind.

32:45.740 --> 32:48.740
 They were literally locked in frozen.

32:48.740 --> 32:51.540
 And sadly, this is irreversible.

32:51.540 --> 32:54.900
 It's irreversible because what MPTP does

32:54.900 --> 32:58.180
 is it kills the dopaminergic neurons

32:58.180 --> 33:00.900
 of the substantia nigra, that nigrostriatal pathway

33:00.900 --> 33:02.780
 that's involved in generating movement,

33:02.780 --> 33:05.180
 and it kills the dopaminergic neurons

33:05.180 --> 33:07.940
 of the so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway.

33:07.940 --> 33:10.980
 I was in college when this whole MPTP thing happened,

33:10.980 --> 33:13.100
 and I remember hearing this story.

33:13.100 --> 33:16.300
 At the time, I had no understanding of what it is

33:16.300 --> 33:19.620
 to have very high levels of dopamine or extremely depleted

33:19.620 --> 33:20.660
 levels of dopamine.

33:20.660 --> 33:22.560
 There was no reason why I should have that understanding.

33:22.560 --> 33:24.700
 I mean, of course, I had experienced different pleasures

33:24.700 --> 33:27.660
 of different kinds, and I've had lows in my life,

33:27.660 --> 33:32.040
 but nothing to the extreme that I'm about to discuss.

33:33.760 --> 33:38.060
 I got Giardia, and Giardia is a stomach bug

33:38.060 --> 33:40.620
 that if any of you ever had it, it is terrible.

33:40.620 --> 33:41.960
 It's terrible diarrhea.

33:41.960 --> 33:43.940
 You end up very dehydrated very quickly.

33:43.940 --> 33:48.120
 You drop a ton of weight, and it is extremely unpleasant.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.660
 I ended up going to the emergency room,

33:51.660 --> 33:53.780
 and in the emergency room,

33:53.780 --> 33:56.100
 I begged them for something to stop up my guts,

33:56.100 --> 33:57.340
 and they gave it to me.

33:57.340 --> 33:59.500
 They put a saline line in to rehydrate me,

33:59.500 --> 34:02.660
 and they injected something into the saline bag,

34:02.660 --> 34:07.660
 and within minutes, I felt more sadness,

34:08.700 --> 34:13.340
 more overwhelming sense of depression,

34:13.340 --> 34:16.580
 basically lower than I'd ever felt in my entire life.

34:16.580 --> 34:19.620
 It was absolutely profound.

34:19.620 --> 34:23.680
 I was crying endlessly without knowing why I was crying.

34:23.680 --> 34:26.740
 I was miserable, and I asked them, what did you inject?

34:26.740 --> 34:29.020
 And they said, we injected Thorazine.

34:29.020 --> 34:31.540
 Thorazine is an anti-psychotic drug.

34:31.540 --> 34:34.120
 It's actually used to block dopamine receptors.

34:34.120 --> 34:37.380
 It's what's given to people who have schizophrenia,

34:37.380 --> 34:39.420
 often is given to people who have schizophrenia

34:39.420 --> 34:42.860
 because schizophrenia involves, among other things,

34:42.860 --> 34:44.480
 elevated levels of dopamine.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.860
 It was horrible.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.620
 The experience of it was miserable,

34:50.620 --> 34:53.140
 unlike anything I'd ever experienced.

34:53.140 --> 34:56.540
 And so I actually said to them, what did you give me?

34:56.540 --> 34:58.300
 They said Thorazine, and I said,

34:58.300 --> 35:00.700
 you have to give me L-DOPA.

35:00.700 --> 35:01.780
 You have to give me something

35:01.780 --> 35:04.100
 to get my dopamine levels back up again.

35:04.100 --> 35:04.980
 And they did.

35:04.980 --> 35:07.320
 They gave me an injection of L-DOPA into the bag,

35:07.320 --> 35:08.500
 went straight into my bloodstream,

35:08.500 --> 35:12.220
 and within minutes, I felt fine again.

35:12.220 --> 35:15.300
 It was incredible, and it really opened up my mind

35:15.300 --> 35:17.060
 and my experience to what it is

35:17.060 --> 35:21.060
 to have absolutely plummeted levels of dopamine.

35:21.060 --> 35:23.120
 There's nothing more miserable than that, I'll tell you.

35:23.120 --> 35:27.820
 And these poor souls who had this MPTP experience,

35:27.820 --> 35:29.820
 unfortunately, they couldn't recover those cells.

35:29.820 --> 35:31.980
 People who have severe Parkinson's

35:31.980 --> 35:33.360
 are struggling with this as well,

35:33.360 --> 35:35.500
 because in Parkinson's and in Lewy body dementia,

35:35.500 --> 35:37.800
 the dopaminergic neurons often die.

35:37.800 --> 35:38.700
 It's not just a problem

35:38.700 --> 35:40.940
 with those neurons releasing enough dopamine.

35:40.940 --> 35:43.200
 Later, we're going to talk about some approaches

35:43.200 --> 35:46.040
 to maintaining dopaminergic neuron health

35:46.040 --> 35:47.780
 and things that we can all do for that.

35:47.780 --> 35:49.980
 But I will tell you, these dopamine neurons

35:49.980 --> 35:51.780
 that we all have are very precious

35:51.780 --> 35:54.240
 for movement and mood and motivation.

35:54.240 --> 35:57.100
 Having experienced what it is to have very,

35:57.100 --> 35:59.460
 very low levels of dopamine, or in this case,

35:59.460 --> 36:04.100
 to have my dopamine receptors blocked from Thorazine,

36:04.100 --> 36:06.780
 was eye-opening, to say the least,

36:06.780 --> 36:09.060
 and has given me tremendous sensitivity

36:09.060 --> 36:12.120
 to the fact that dopamine is perhaps

36:12.120 --> 36:13.900
 one of the most powerful molecules

36:13.900 --> 36:16.460
 that any of us has inside of us,

36:16.460 --> 36:19.120
 and the one that we ought to all think very carefully

36:19.120 --> 36:20.100
 about how we leverage.

36:20.100 --> 36:24.900
 Because while most experiences and most things that we do

36:24.900 --> 36:27.260
 and take and eat and et cetera,

36:27.260 --> 36:30.840
 won't create enormous highs and enormous lows in dopamine,

36:31.700 --> 36:33.600
 even subtle fluctuations in dopamine

36:33.600 --> 36:35.740
 really shape our perception of life

36:35.740 --> 36:38.060
 and what we're capable of and how we feel.

36:38.060 --> 36:39.180
 And so we want to guard those,

36:39.180 --> 36:40.580
 and we want to understand them.

36:40.580 --> 36:42.660
 So let's lean into that understanding about dopamine,

36:42.660 --> 36:45.220
 and then let's talk about some tools that we can all use

36:45.220 --> 36:48.340
 to leverage dopamine in order to keep that baseline

36:48.340 --> 36:50.500
 in the appropriate healthy place,

36:50.500 --> 36:53.780
 and still be able to access those peaks in dopamine,

36:53.780 --> 36:55.500
 because those, after all,

36:55.500 --> 36:58.380
 are some of what makes life rich and worth living.

36:58.380 --> 37:00.620
 So let's talk about the baseline of dopamine

37:00.620 --> 37:03.660
 that we all have and the peaks in dopamine

37:03.660 --> 37:07.060
 that we all can achieve through different activities

37:07.060 --> 37:08.560
 and things that we ingest.

37:10.740 --> 37:13.740
 All of us have different baseline levels of dopamine.

37:13.740 --> 37:17.020
 Some of this is sure to be genetic.

37:17.020 --> 37:21.220
 Some people just simply ride at a level a little bit higher.

37:21.220 --> 37:22.500
 They're a little bit more excited.

37:22.500 --> 37:24.620
 They're a little bit more motivated,

37:24.620 --> 37:25.980
 or maybe they're a lot more excited

37:25.980 --> 37:27.220
 or a lot more motivated.

37:28.860 --> 37:30.340
 Some people are a little mellower.

37:30.340 --> 37:32.460
 Some people are a little less excitable.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.500
 And some of that has to do with the fact

37:34.500 --> 37:37.180
 that dopamine doesn't act alone.

37:37.180 --> 37:41.300
 Dopamine has close cousins or friends in the nervous system,

37:41.300 --> 37:43.300
 and I'll just name off a few of those close cousins

37:43.300 --> 37:44.120
 and friends.

37:45.820 --> 37:48.620
 Epinephrine, also called adrenaline,

37:48.620 --> 37:52.020
 is the main chemical driver of energy.

37:52.020 --> 37:55.100
 We can't do anything, anything at all,

37:55.100 --> 37:56.980
 unless we have some level of epinephrine

37:56.980 --> 37:58.620
 in our brain and body.

37:58.620 --> 38:00.020
 It's released from the adrenal glands,

38:00.020 --> 38:01.180
 which ride atop our kidneys.

38:01.180 --> 38:03.420
 It's released from an area of the brainstem

38:03.420 --> 38:05.420
 called locus coeruleus.

38:05.420 --> 38:08.620
 And its release tends to wake up neural circuits

38:08.620 --> 38:11.880
 in the brain and wake up various aspects

38:11.880 --> 38:15.780
 of our body's physiology and give us a readiness.

38:15.780 --> 38:16.940
 So it should come as no surprise

38:16.940 --> 38:19.580
 that dopamine and epinephrine,

38:19.580 --> 38:22.300
 AKA adrenaline, hang out together.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.640
 In fact, epinephrine and adrenaline

38:24.640 --> 38:28.120
 are actually manufactured from dopamine.

38:28.120 --> 38:30.540
 There's a biochemical pathway involving dopamine,

38:30.540 --> 38:32.180
 which is a beautiful pathway.

38:32.180 --> 38:33.700
 If ever you want to look it up,

38:33.700 --> 38:36.120
 you could just look up biochemistry of dopamine.

38:36.120 --> 38:39.140
 But what you'll find is that L-DOPA

38:39.140 --> 38:41.480
 is converted into dopamine.

38:43.180 --> 38:47.200
 Dopamine is converted into noradrenaline,

38:47.200 --> 38:49.500
 nor epinephrine, it's also called,

38:49.500 --> 38:51.940
 and noradrenaline, norepinephrine

38:51.940 --> 38:54.460
 is converted into adrenaline.

38:54.460 --> 38:57.780
 So not only are dopamine and epinephrine,

38:57.780 --> 39:00.020
 AKA adrenaline, close cousins,

39:00.020 --> 39:02.540
 they are actually family members, okay?

39:02.540 --> 39:04.060
 They're closely related.

39:04.060 --> 39:06.260
 I'm not going to get too deep into epinephrine today.

39:06.260 --> 39:08.380
 I'm not going to talk too much about those pathways,

39:08.380 --> 39:11.020
 but anytime I'm talking about dopaminergic transmission

39:11.020 --> 39:13.040
 or that you have a peak in dopamine,

39:13.040 --> 39:15.100
 inevitably that means that you have a peak

39:15.100 --> 39:17.660
 in release of epinephrine as well.

39:17.660 --> 39:21.560
 What dopamine does is dopamine really colors

39:21.560 --> 39:24.340
 the subjective experience of an activity

39:24.340 --> 39:26.340
 to make it more pleasureful,

39:26.340 --> 39:28.580
 to make it something that you want more of.

39:28.580 --> 39:30.780
 Epinephrine is more about energy.

39:30.780 --> 39:35.780
 Epinephrine alone can be fear, paralysis, trauma,

39:35.780 --> 39:38.660
 not physical paralysis, but mental paralysis,

39:38.660 --> 39:42.160
 frozen in fear or being traumatized or scared.

39:43.020 --> 39:45.980
 But the addition of dopamine to that chemical cocktail,

39:45.980 --> 39:48.380
 if dopamine was released in the brain,

39:48.380 --> 39:53.060
 well then that epinephrine becomes one of excitement.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.860
 Okay, I'm using a broad brush here,

39:54.860 --> 39:56.320
 but essentially what you need to know

39:56.320 --> 39:59.900
 is that dopamine and epinephrine, AKA adrenaline,

39:59.900 --> 40:01.940
 are family members and they tend to work together

40:01.940 --> 40:06.020
 like a little gang to make you seek out certain things.

40:06.020 --> 40:08.100
 So what sorts of activities,

40:08.100 --> 40:11.200
 what sorts of things increase dopamine

40:11.200 --> 40:14.000
 and how much do they increase dopamine?

40:14.000 --> 40:17.700
 Well, let's take a look at some typical things

40:17.700 --> 40:21.340
 that people do out there or ingest out there

40:21.340 --> 40:23.860
 that are known to increase dopamine.

40:23.860 --> 40:26.580
 So let's recall that you have a baseline level of dopamine

40:26.580 --> 40:28.200
 and that everybody does.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.540
 And even within a family, you might have family members

40:30.540 --> 40:33.140
 who are very excitable, happy and motivated

40:33.140 --> 40:36.080
 and others who are less excitable, happy and motivated.

40:36.080 --> 40:40.660
 But your level of dopamine has everything to do

40:40.660 --> 40:43.620
 with those genetics, but also with what you've experienced

40:43.620 --> 40:46.380
 in the previous days and the previous months and so on.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.440
 When you do or ingest certain things,

40:50.440 --> 40:53.500
 your levels of dopamine will rise above baseline,

40:53.500 --> 40:57.980
 transiently and depending on what you do or ingest,

40:57.980 --> 41:00.780
 it will rise either more or less

41:00.780 --> 41:03.700
 and it will be very brief or it'll last a long time.

41:03.700 --> 41:05.540
 So let's take a look at some of the typical things

41:05.540 --> 41:08.820
 that people take and do and eat.

41:08.820 --> 41:11.120
 Some are good for us, some are not good for us.

41:12.300 --> 41:13.780
 And let's ask how much dopamine

41:13.780 --> 41:15.740
 is increased above baseline.

41:15.740 --> 41:16.940
 Now, of course, these are averages,

41:16.940 --> 41:19.100
 but these are averages that have been measured

41:19.100 --> 41:21.860
 in so-called micro dialysis studies in animals.

41:21.860 --> 41:24.020
 So actually extracting from particular brain areas,

41:24.020 --> 41:27.340
 how much dopamine is released or from measuring the serum,

41:27.340 --> 41:30.720
 the circulating levels of dopamine in humans.

41:32.060 --> 41:35.820
 Chocolate, they didn't look at milk versus dark chocolate,

41:35.820 --> 41:38.940
 but chocolate will increase your baseline level

41:38.940 --> 41:41.940
 of dopamine 1.5 times, okay?

41:41.940 --> 41:44.420
 So it's a pretty substantial increase in dopamine.

41:44.420 --> 41:48.000
 It's transient, it goes away after a few minutes

41:48.000 --> 41:50.300
 or even a few seconds.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.300
 I'll explain what determines the duration in a minute,

41:53.300 --> 41:55.620
 but 1.5 times for chocolate.

41:56.620 --> 42:01.620
 Sex, both the pursuit of sex and the act of sex

42:02.300 --> 42:06.300
 increases dopamine two times.

42:06.300 --> 42:08.980
 So it's a doubling above baseline.

42:08.980 --> 42:11.300
 Now, of course, there's going to be variation there,

42:11.300 --> 42:15.220
 but that's the average increase in baseline dopamine

42:16.220 --> 42:17.720
 caused by sex.

42:17.720 --> 42:22.300
 Later, I will talk about how the different aspects

42:22.300 --> 42:23.960
 of the so-called arousal art,

42:23.960 --> 42:25.920
 the different aspects of sex, believe it or not,

42:25.920 --> 42:28.900
 have a differential impact on dopamine.

42:28.900 --> 42:33.040
 But for now, as a general theme or activity,

42:33.040 --> 42:36.480
 sex doubles the amount of dopamine circulating

42:36.480 --> 42:37.320
 in your blood.

42:39.080 --> 42:41.200
 Nicotine, in particular,

42:41.200 --> 42:44.840
 nicotine that is smoked like cigarettes and so forth

42:44.840 --> 42:49.840
 increases dopamine two and a half times above baseline.

42:49.920 --> 42:53.240
 So there's a peak that goes up above baseline

42:53.240 --> 42:55.640
 two and a half times higher.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.160
 It is very short-lived.

42:59.160 --> 43:01.480
 Anyone who's ever been a chain smoker

43:01.480 --> 43:03.440
 or observed a chain smoker understands

43:03.440 --> 43:06.600
 that the increase in dopamine from nicotine

43:06.600 --> 43:08.420
 is very short-lived.

43:09.840 --> 43:12.280
 Cocaine will increase the level of dopamine

43:12.280 --> 43:15.060
 in the bloodstream two and a half times above baseline.

43:16.640 --> 43:21.320
 And amphetamine, another drug that increases dopamine,

43:21.320 --> 43:25.000
 will increase the amount of dopamine in the bloodstream

43:25.000 --> 43:27.420
 10 times above baseline,

43:27.420 --> 43:30.200
 a tremendous increase in dopamine.

43:30.200 --> 43:31.760
 Exercise.

43:31.760 --> 43:34.440
 Now, exercise will have a different impact

43:34.440 --> 43:35.660
 on the levels of dopamine,

43:35.660 --> 43:37.480
 depending on how much somebody

43:37.480 --> 43:40.580
 subjectively enjoys that exercise.

43:40.580 --> 43:43.320
 So if you're somebody who loves running,

43:43.320 --> 43:47.720
 chances are it's going to increase your levels of dopamine

43:47.720 --> 43:51.320
 two times above your baseline, not unlike sex.

43:53.120 --> 43:55.120
 People who dislike exercise

43:55.120 --> 43:57.520
 will achieve less dopamine increase

43:57.520 --> 44:01.000
 or no increase in dopamine from exercise.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.560
 And if you like other forms of exercise,

44:02.560 --> 44:05.920
 like yoga or weightlifting or swimming or what have you,

44:05.920 --> 44:08.320
 again, it's going to vary by your subjective experience

44:08.320 --> 44:11.360
 of whether or not you enjoy that activity.

44:11.360 --> 44:13.720
 This is important and it brings us back

44:13.720 --> 44:15.280
 to something that we talked about earlier.

44:15.280 --> 44:19.320
 Remember that mesocorticolimbic pathway?

44:19.320 --> 44:21.560
 Well, the cortical part is important.

44:21.560 --> 44:25.220
 The cortical part actually has a very specific part,

44:25.220 --> 44:26.980
 which is your prefrontal cortex,

44:26.980 --> 44:28.880
 the area of your forebrain

44:28.880 --> 44:31.360
 that's involved in thinking and planning

44:31.360 --> 44:35.460
 and involved in assigning a rational explanation

44:35.460 --> 44:39.120
 to something and involved in assigning a subjective

44:39.120 --> 44:41.120
 experience to something, all right?

44:41.120 --> 44:43.240
 So for instance, the pen that I'm holding right now,

44:43.240 --> 44:44.600
 it's one of these Pilot V5s.

44:44.600 --> 44:45.720
 I love these Pilot V5s.

44:45.720 --> 44:46.680
 They don't sponsor the podcast.

44:46.680 --> 44:47.520
 I just happen to like them.

44:47.520 --> 44:49.840
 I like the way that they write, how they feel.

44:50.920 --> 44:53.280
 If I spent enough time thinking about or talking about it,

44:53.280 --> 44:54.700
 I could probably get a dopamine increase

44:54.700 --> 44:56.240
 just talking about this Pilot V5.

44:56.240 --> 44:58.840
 And that's not because I have the propensity

44:58.840 --> 45:00.280
 to release dopamine easily.

45:00.280 --> 45:03.520
 It's that as we start to engage with something more and more

45:03.520 --> 45:06.920
 and what we say about it and what we encourage ourselves

45:06.920 --> 45:09.960
 to think about it has a profound impact

45:09.960 --> 45:13.280
 on its rewarding or non-rewarding properties.

45:13.280 --> 45:15.760
 Now it's not simply the case that you can lie to yourself

45:15.760 --> 45:17.280
 and you can tell yourself, I love something.

45:17.280 --> 45:18.600
 And when you don't really love it

45:18.600 --> 45:20.880
 and it will increase dopamine.

45:20.880 --> 45:22.760
 But what's been found over and over again

45:22.760 --> 45:24.560
 is that if people journal about something

45:24.560 --> 45:27.780
 or they practice some form of appreciation for something,

45:27.780 --> 45:31.540
 or they think of some aspect of something that they enjoy,

45:31.540 --> 45:35.580
 the amount of dopamine that that behavior will evoke

45:35.580 --> 45:37.160
 tends to go up.

45:37.160 --> 45:38.680
 So for people that hate exercise,

45:38.680 --> 45:41.560
 you can think about some aspect of exercise

45:41.560 --> 45:42.640
 that you really enjoy.

45:42.640 --> 45:47.640
 However, I will caution you against saying to yourself,

45:47.960 --> 45:52.680
 I hate exercise or I hate studying, or I hate this person,

45:52.680 --> 45:55.920
 but I love the reward I give myself afterward.

45:55.920 --> 45:58.120
 Later, we're going to talk about how rewards

45:58.120 --> 46:01.640
 given afterward actually make the situation worse.

46:01.640 --> 46:04.600
 They won't make you like exercise more or studying more.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.080
 They actually will undermine the dopamine release

46:07.080 --> 46:09.440
 that would otherwise occur for that activity.

46:09.440 --> 46:13.580
 So certain things, chemicals have a universal effect.

46:13.580 --> 46:16.040
 They make everybody's dopamine go up.

46:16.040 --> 46:17.540
 So some people like chocolate,

46:17.540 --> 46:19.360
 some people don't of course,

46:19.360 --> 46:22.860
 but in general it causes this increase in dopamine.

46:22.860 --> 46:25.920
 But sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine,

46:25.920 --> 46:28.040
 those things cause increases in dopamine

46:28.040 --> 46:29.480
 in everybody that takes them.

46:30.920 --> 46:33.400
 Things like exercise, studying, hard work,

46:33.400 --> 46:35.320
 working through a challenge in a relationship

46:35.320 --> 46:38.120
 or working through something hard of any kind,

46:38.120 --> 46:40.320
 that is going to be subjective

46:40.320 --> 46:42.760
 as to how much dopamine will be released.

46:42.760 --> 46:45.320
 And we will return to that subjective component

46:45.320 --> 46:46.800
 in a little bit.

46:46.800 --> 46:51.800
 But now you have a sense of how much dopamine can be evoked

46:51.800 --> 46:54.960
 by different activities and by different substances.

46:54.960 --> 46:57.440
 One that you might be wondering about is caffeine.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.320
 I'm certainly drinking my caffeine today

46:59.320 --> 47:03.500
 and I do enjoy caffeine in limited quantities.

47:03.500 --> 47:07.340
 I drink yerba mate and I drink coffee and I love it.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.100
 Does it increase dopamine?

47:10.100 --> 47:11.820
 Well, a little bit.

47:11.820 --> 47:14.400
 Caffeine will increase dopamine to some extent,

47:14.400 --> 47:17.580
 but it is pretty modest compared to the other things

47:17.580 --> 47:19.840
 that I described, chocolate, sex, nicotine,

47:19.840 --> 47:21.400
 cocaine, amphetamine, and so on.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.760
 However, there's a really interesting paper published

47:25.760 --> 47:28.520
 in 2015, this is Volkow et al,

47:28.520 --> 47:30.560
 you can look it up, it's very easy to find,

47:30.560 --> 47:33.600
 that showed that regular ingestion of caffeine,

47:33.600 --> 47:36.120
 whether or not it's from coffee or otherwise,

47:36.120 --> 47:40.940
 increases upregulation of certain dopamine receptors.

47:40.940 --> 47:45.940
 So caffeine actually makes you able to experience

47:46.160 --> 47:47.920
 more of dopamine's effects.

47:47.920 --> 47:49.080
 Because as I mentioned before,

47:49.080 --> 47:51.280
 dopamine is vomited out into the synapse

47:51.280 --> 47:52.480
 or it's released volumetrically,

47:52.480 --> 47:53.960
 but then it has to bind someplace

47:53.960 --> 47:56.840
 and trigger those G protein coupled receptors.

47:56.840 --> 47:59.720
 And caffeine increases the number,

47:59.720 --> 48:02.560
 the density of those G protein coupled receptors.

48:03.400 --> 48:06.020
 Now, sitting back and thinking about that,

48:06.020 --> 48:07.400
 you might think, oh yeah, you know,

48:07.400 --> 48:10.140
 sometimes I'll notice people, at least in the old days,

48:10.140 --> 48:13.120
 that it used to be a cigarette and a cup of coffee,

48:13.120 --> 48:16.280
 or when people drink alcohol, oftentimes they'll smoke.

48:16.280 --> 48:18.980
 And it's well known that different compounds

48:18.980 --> 48:23.020
 like alcohol and nicotine or caffeine and nicotine

48:23.020 --> 48:25.680
 or certain behaviors and certain drugs

48:25.680 --> 48:28.760
 can synergize to give bigger dopamine increases.

48:28.760 --> 48:30.600
 And this is not terribly uncommon.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.840
 There are a lot of people nowadays who, for instance,

48:32.840 --> 48:34.760
 take pre-workout energy drinks.

48:34.760 --> 48:36.420
 They'll drink, I won't name names,

48:36.420 --> 48:38.640
 but they'll drink a canned energy drink

48:38.640 --> 48:40.500
 or they'll drink a pre-workout

48:40.500 --> 48:42.920
 and they'll try and get that big stimulation,

48:42.920 --> 48:45.960
 that stimulant effect for the dopamine, the norepinephrine,

48:45.960 --> 48:47.680
 that family of molecules that works together

48:47.680 --> 48:48.680
 to make you motivated.

48:48.680 --> 48:51.720
 And then they'll also exercise to try and get even more

48:51.720 --> 48:54.940
 of a dopaminergic experience out of that workout.

48:54.940 --> 48:59.080
 Sometimes it's also to perform better as well, of course.

48:59.080 --> 49:01.840
 But as we'll talk about in a few minutes,

49:01.840 --> 49:04.160
 that aspect or that approach, rather,

49:04.160 --> 49:05.520
 of trying to just get your dopamine

49:05.520 --> 49:07.040
 as high as you possibly can

49:07.040 --> 49:09.540
 in order to get the most out of an experience

49:09.540 --> 49:11.820
 turns out to not be the best approach.

49:11.820 --> 49:16.000
 And what you'll find as we talk about dopamine schedules

49:16.000 --> 49:19.640
 is that layering together multiple things,

49:19.640 --> 49:23.100
 substances and activities that lead to big increases

49:23.100 --> 49:26.980
 in dopamine actually can create pretty severe issues

49:26.980 --> 49:30.440
 with motivation and energy right after those experiences

49:30.440 --> 49:32.160
 and even a couple of days later.

49:32.160 --> 49:33.960
 So I'm not saying that people shouldn't take

49:33.960 --> 49:35.800
 the occasional pre-workout if that's your thing

49:35.800 --> 49:38.560
 or drink a cup of coffee or two before working out.

49:38.560 --> 49:40.680
 Now and again, some people really enjoy that.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.720
 I certainly do that every once in a while.

49:42.720 --> 49:44.240
 But if you do it too often,

49:44.240 --> 49:48.360
 what you'll find is that your capacity to release dopamine

49:48.360 --> 49:51.480
 and your level of motivation and drive and energy overall

49:51.480 --> 49:53.360
 will take a serious hit.

49:53.360 --> 49:55.760
 Now I've been alluding to this dopamine peaks

49:55.760 --> 49:57.480
 versus dopamine baseline thing

49:57.480 --> 49:58.940
 since the beginning of the episode,

49:58.940 --> 50:01.960
 talked about tonic and phasic release and so forth.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.280
 But now let's really drill into what this means

50:04.280 --> 50:07.960
 and how to leverage it for our own purposes.

50:07.960 --> 50:10.200
 In order to do that, let's take a step back and ask,

50:10.200 --> 50:12.960
 why would we have a dopamine system like this?

50:12.960 --> 50:15.100
 Why would we have a dopamine system at all?

50:15.100 --> 50:19.060
 Well, we have to remember what our species

50:19.060 --> 50:20.900
 primary interest is.

50:20.900 --> 50:24.980
 Our species like all species has a main interest

50:24.980 --> 50:26.740
 and that's to make more of itself.

50:26.740 --> 50:28.560
 It's not just about sex and reproduction,

50:28.560 --> 50:31.300
 it's about foraging for resources.

50:31.300 --> 50:34.720
 Resources can be food, it can be water, it can be salt,

50:34.720 --> 50:38.100
 can be shelter, can be social connection.

50:39.040 --> 50:44.040
 Dopamine is the universal currency of foraging and seeking.

50:44.040 --> 50:46.780
 We call sometimes talk about motivation and craving,

50:46.780 --> 50:49.600
 but what we mean in the evolutionary adaptive context,

50:49.600 --> 50:51.160
 what we mean is foraging and seeking,

50:51.160 --> 50:54.780
 seeking water, seeking food, seeking mates,

50:54.780 --> 50:57.320
 seeking things that make us feel good and avoiding things

50:57.320 --> 50:58.280
 that don't make us feel good,

50:58.280 --> 51:00.040
 but in particular seeking things

51:00.040 --> 51:03.800
 that will provide sustenance and pleasure in the short term

51:03.800 --> 51:07.360
 and will extend the species in the longterm.

51:07.360 --> 51:09.080
 Once we understand that dopamine

51:09.080 --> 51:12.240
 is a driver for us to seek things,

51:12.240 --> 51:14.240
 it makes perfect sense as to why

51:14.240 --> 51:17.400
 it would have a baseline level and it would have peaks

51:17.400 --> 51:19.880
 and that the baseline and peaks would be related

51:19.880 --> 51:21.920
 in some sort of direct way.

51:21.920 --> 51:23.800
 Here's what I mean by that.

51:23.800 --> 51:26.080
 Let's say that you were not alive now,

51:26.080 --> 51:28.920
 but you were alive 10,000 years ago

51:28.920 --> 51:31.640
 and you woke up and you looked and you realized

51:31.640 --> 51:36.120
 you had minimal water and you had minimal food left.

51:36.120 --> 51:38.560
 Maybe you have a child, maybe you have a partner,

51:38.560 --> 51:39.960
 maybe you're in an entire village,

51:39.960 --> 51:43.120
 but you realize that you need things, okay?

51:45.040 --> 51:47.240
 You need to be able to generate the energy

51:47.240 --> 51:49.040
 to go seek those things.

51:49.040 --> 51:52.120
 And chances are there were dangers in seeking those things.

51:52.120 --> 51:53.880
 Yes, it could be saber-toothed tigers

51:53.880 --> 51:56.840
 and things of that sort, but there are other dangers too.

51:56.840 --> 51:58.460
 There's the danger of a cut to your skin

51:58.460 --> 51:59.480
 that could lead to infection.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.760
 There's the danger of storms.

52:00.760 --> 52:01.880
 There's the danger of cold.

52:01.880 --> 52:04.680
 There's the danger of leaving your loved ones behind.

52:04.680 --> 52:07.480
 So you go out and forage, right?

52:07.480 --> 52:08.920
 You could be hunting, you could be gathering,

52:08.920 --> 52:10.920
 or you could be doing both.

52:10.920 --> 52:15.660
 The going out and foraging process was, we are certain,

52:15.660 --> 52:16.980
 driven by dopamine.

52:16.980 --> 52:18.720
 I mean, there's no fossil record of the brain,

52:18.720 --> 52:20.600
 but these circuits have existed, we know,

52:20.600 --> 52:23.500
 for tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands

52:23.500 --> 52:26.120
 of years, and they are present in every animal,

52:26.120 --> 52:28.880
 not just mammals, but even in little worms like c. elegans,

52:28.880 --> 52:32.280
 the same process is mediated by dopamine.

52:32.280 --> 52:35.100
 So dopamine drives you to go out and look for things.

52:35.100 --> 52:37.500
 And then let's say you find a couple of berries

52:37.500 --> 52:39.500
 and these ones are rotten, these ones are good.

52:39.500 --> 52:41.640
 Maybe you hunt an animal and kill it,

52:41.640 --> 52:43.680
 or you find an animal that was recently killed

52:43.680 --> 52:45.280
 and you decide to take the meat.

52:46.280 --> 52:48.720
 You are going to achieve, or I should say,

52:48.720 --> 52:51.560
 experience some sort of dopamine release.

52:51.560 --> 52:53.980
 You found the reward, that's great,

52:53.980 --> 52:57.480
 but then it needs to return to some lower level.

52:57.480 --> 52:58.320
 Why?

52:58.320 --> 53:00.380
 Well, because if you just stayed there,

53:00.380 --> 53:02.620
 you would never continue to forage for more.

53:03.560 --> 53:06.720
 It doesn't just increase your baseline and then stay there.

53:06.720 --> 53:08.240
 It goes back down.

53:08.240 --> 53:09.860
 And what's very important to understand

53:09.860 --> 53:11.460
 is that it doesn't just go back down

53:11.460 --> 53:13.520
 to the level it was before.

53:13.520 --> 53:16.720
 It goes down to a level below what it was

53:16.720 --> 53:19.020
 before you went out seeking that thing.

53:19.020 --> 53:20.960
 Now, this is counterintuitive.

53:20.960 --> 53:23.800
 We often think, oh, okay, I'm going to pursue the win.

53:23.800 --> 53:26.420
 All right, let's move this to modern day.

53:26.420 --> 53:28.520
 I'm going to run this marathon.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.680
 I'm going to train for this marathon.

53:29.680 --> 53:32.200
 Then you run the marathon and you finish,

53:32.200 --> 53:34.440
 you cross the finish line, you feel great.

53:34.440 --> 53:36.080
 And you would think, okay, now I'm set

53:36.080 --> 53:37.200
 for the entire year.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.200
 I'm going to feel so much better.

53:38.200 --> 53:40.120
 I'm going to feel this accomplishment in my body.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.900
 It's going to be so great, but that's not what happens.

53:42.900 --> 53:44.320
 You might feel some of those things,

53:44.320 --> 53:45.880
 but your level of dopamine

53:45.880 --> 53:48.440
 has actually dropped below baseline.

53:48.440 --> 53:51.320
 Now, eventually it will ratchet back up,

53:51.320 --> 53:52.700
 but two things are really important.

53:52.700 --> 53:55.800
 First of all, the extent to which it drops below baseline

53:55.800 --> 53:59.020
 is proportional to how high the peak was.

53:59.020 --> 54:02.720
 So if you cross the finish line pretty happy,

54:02.720 --> 54:06.000
 it won't drop that much below baseline afterward.

54:06.000 --> 54:08.940
 If you cross the finish line ecstatic,

54:08.940 --> 54:10.120
 well, a day or two later,

54:10.120 --> 54:12.360
 you're going to feel quite a bit lower

54:12.360 --> 54:13.360
 than you would otherwise.

54:13.360 --> 54:14.480
 You might not be depressed

54:14.480 --> 54:17.180
 because it depends on where that baseline was to begin with.

54:17.180 --> 54:19.060
 But the so-called postpartum depression

54:19.060 --> 54:21.720
 that people experience after giving birth

54:22.680 --> 54:25.640
 or after some big win, a graduation,

54:25.640 --> 54:27.620
 or any kind of celebration,

54:27.620 --> 54:32.280
 that postpartum drop in mood and affect and motivation

54:32.280 --> 54:35.040
 is the drop in baseline dopamine.

54:35.040 --> 54:36.380
 This is very important to understand

54:36.380 --> 54:38.760
 because this happens on very rapid timescales

54:38.760 --> 54:40.640
 and it can last quite a long time.

54:41.500 --> 54:44.620
 It also explains the behavior

54:44.620 --> 54:46.100
 that most of us are familiar with,

54:46.100 --> 54:48.240
 of engaging in something that we really enjoy,

54:48.240 --> 54:51.060
 going to a restaurant that we absolutely love

54:51.060 --> 54:53.140
 or engaging in some way with some person

54:53.140 --> 54:55.220
 that we really, really enjoy.

54:55.220 --> 54:57.300
 But if we continue to engage in that behavior

54:57.300 --> 55:01.200
 over and over again, it kind of loses its edge.

55:01.200 --> 55:05.320
 It starts to kind of feel less exciting to us.

55:06.240 --> 55:10.100
 Some of us experience that drop in excitement

55:10.100 --> 55:12.860
 more quickly and more severely than others,

55:12.860 --> 55:16.360
 but everyone experiences that to some extent.

55:16.360 --> 55:18.860
 And this has direct roots

55:18.860 --> 55:22.180
 in these evolutionarily conserved circuits.

55:22.180 --> 55:23.700
 Some of you may be hearing this and think,

55:23.700 --> 55:25.500
 no, no, no, that's not how it works for me.

55:25.500 --> 55:27.540
 I'm just riding higher and higher all the time.

55:27.540 --> 55:30.200
 I love my kids, I love my job, I love school,

55:30.200 --> 55:33.020
 I love wins, I don't want losses.

55:33.020 --> 55:33.860
 I agree.

55:35.300 --> 55:37.460
 We all feel good when we are achieving things,

55:37.460 --> 55:40.120
 but oftentimes we are feeling good

55:40.120 --> 55:43.860
 because we are layering in different aspects of life,

55:43.860 --> 55:46.460
 consuming things and doing things that increase our dopamine.

55:46.460 --> 55:48.240
 We're getting those peaks.

55:48.240 --> 55:52.700
 But afterward, the drop in baseline occurs

55:52.700 --> 55:54.700
 and it always takes a little while

55:54.700 --> 55:58.160
 to get back to our stable baseline.

55:58.160 --> 56:01.540
 We really all have a sort of dopamine set point.

56:01.540 --> 56:04.780
 And if we continue to indulge in the same behaviors

56:04.780 --> 56:07.420
 or even different behaviors that increase our dopamine

56:07.420 --> 56:10.020
 in these big peaks over and over and over again,

56:10.020 --> 56:12.560
 we won't experience the same level of joy

56:12.560 --> 56:16.340
 from those behaviors or from anything at all.

56:16.340 --> 56:18.580
 Now that has a name, it's called addiction,

56:18.580 --> 56:21.980
 but even for people who aren't addicted,

56:21.980 --> 56:23.980
 even for people who don't have an attachment

56:23.980 --> 56:26.360
 to any specific substance or behavior,

56:26.360 --> 56:30.180
 this drop in below baseline after any peak in dopamine

56:30.180 --> 56:33.260
 is substantial and it governs whether or not

56:33.260 --> 56:34.340
 we are going to feel motivated

56:34.340 --> 56:36.960
 to continue to pursue other things.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.900
 Fortunately, there's a way to work with this

56:39.900 --> 56:42.120
 such that we can constantly stay motivated,

56:42.120 --> 56:44.440
 but also keep that baseline of dopamine

56:44.440 --> 56:46.380
 at an appropriate healthy level.

56:46.380 --> 56:48.700
 A previous guest on the Huberman Lab podcast

56:48.700 --> 56:49.880
 was Dr. Anna Lemke.

56:49.880 --> 56:52.660
 She's head of the Addiction Dual Diagnosis Clinic

56:52.660 --> 56:54.540
 at Stanford, has this amazing book,

56:54.540 --> 56:58.020
 ''Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.''

56:58.020 --> 56:59.060
 If you haven't read the book,

56:59.060 --> 57:02.000
 I highly encourage you to check it out, it's fantastic.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.980
 The other terrific book about dopamine

57:03.980 --> 57:05.520
 is ''The Molecule of More,''

57:05.520 --> 57:07.980
 which is similar in some regard,

57:07.980 --> 57:09.440
 but isn't so much about addiction,

57:09.440 --> 57:11.820
 it's more about other types of behaviors.

57:11.820 --> 57:15.500
 Both books really focus on these dopamine schedules

57:15.500 --> 57:17.140
 and the relationship between these peaks

57:17.140 --> 57:18.540
 and baselines of dopamine.

57:20.360 --> 57:21.480
 In Dr. Lemke's book,

57:21.480 --> 57:23.340
 and when she was on the Huberman Lab podcast,

57:23.340 --> 57:24.640
 another podcast, she's talked about

57:24.640 --> 57:26.020
 this pleasure-pain balance,

57:26.020 --> 57:28.780
 that when we seek something that we really like

57:28.780 --> 57:31.180
 or we indulge in it, like eating a little piece of chocolate

57:31.180 --> 57:33.540
 if we really like chocolate, there's some pleasure,

57:33.540 --> 57:37.080
 but then there's a little bit of pain

57:37.080 --> 57:40.220
 that exceeds the amount of pleasure and it's subtle,

57:40.220 --> 57:43.700
 and we experience it as wanting more of that thing.

57:43.700 --> 57:45.760
 Okay, so there's a pleasure-pain balance,

57:45.760 --> 57:48.620
 and I'm telling you that the pleasure and the pain

57:48.620 --> 57:50.660
 are governed by dopamine to some extent.

57:50.660 --> 57:52.100
 Well, how could that be, right?

57:52.100 --> 57:54.900
 I said before, when you engage in an activity

57:54.900 --> 57:57.580
 or when you ingest something that increases dopamine,

57:57.580 --> 58:00.300
 the dopamine levels go up to a substantial degree

58:00.300 --> 58:02.240
 with all the things I listed off.

58:04.140 --> 58:06.060
 Where's the pain coming from?

58:06.060 --> 58:09.100
 Well, the pain is coming from the lack of dopamine

58:09.100 --> 58:12.540
 that follows, and you now know

58:12.540 --> 58:15.940
 what that lack of dopamine reflects.

58:15.940 --> 58:17.060
 How do you know?

58:17.060 --> 58:18.660
 Well, earlier we were talking about

58:18.660 --> 58:22.060
 how dopamine is released between neurons

58:22.060 --> 58:24.460
 and I mentioned two ways, one is into the synapse

58:24.460 --> 58:26.720
 where it can activate the postsynaptic neuron,

58:26.720 --> 58:28.760
 and the other was what I called volumetric release

58:28.760 --> 58:31.000
 where it is distributed more broadly,

58:31.000 --> 58:33.660
 it's released out over a bunch of neurons.

58:35.220 --> 58:37.960
 In both cases, it's released from these things

58:37.960 --> 58:40.820
 we call synaptic vesicles, literally little bubbles,

58:40.820 --> 58:43.780
 tiny, tiny little bubbles that contain dopamine,

58:43.780 --> 58:47.580
 they get vomited out into the area or into the synapse.

58:47.580 --> 58:52.080
 Well, those vesicles get depleted.

58:52.080 --> 58:54.420
 For the synaptic physiologists out there,

58:54.420 --> 58:58.900
 we call this the readily releasable pool of dopamine.

58:58.900 --> 59:03.100
 We can only deploy dopamine that is ready to be deployed,

59:03.100 --> 59:05.440
 that's packaged in those little vesicles and ready to go,

59:05.440 --> 59:07.220
 it's like when you order a product

59:07.220 --> 59:10.540
 and they say out of stock until two months from now,

59:10.540 --> 59:12.300
 well, it's not ready to be released.

59:12.300 --> 59:13.220
 Same thing with dopamine,

59:13.220 --> 59:16.420
 there's a pool of dopamine that's synthesized

59:16.420 --> 59:20.020
 and you can only release the dopamine

59:20.020 --> 59:22.860
 that's been synthesized, it's the readily releasable pool.

59:23.700 --> 59:27.000
 The pleasure pain balance doesn't only hinge

59:27.000 --> 59:29.380
 on the readily releasable pool of dopamine,

59:29.380 --> 59:33.140
 but a big part of the pleasure pain balance

59:33.140 --> 59:36.620
 hinges on how much dopamine is there

59:36.620 --> 59:38.680
 and how much is ready and capable

59:38.680 --> 59:41.180
 of being released into the system.

59:41.180 --> 59:44.960
 So now we've given some meat to this thing

59:44.960 --> 59:47.220
 that we call the pleasure pain balance.

59:47.220 --> 59:49.680
 And now it should make perfect sense

59:49.680 --> 59:52.620
 why if you take something or do something

59:52.620 --> 59:55.760
 that leads to huge increases in dopamine,

59:55.760 --> 59:58.220
 afterward your baseline should drop

59:58.220 --> 1:00:00.980
 because there isn't a lot of dopamine around

1:00:00.980 --> 1:00:02.740
 to keep your baseline going.

1:00:04.300 --> 1:00:07.260
 Fortunately, most people do not experience

1:00:07.260 --> 1:00:10.140
 or pursue enormous increases in dopamine

1:00:10.140 --> 1:00:12.340
 leading to these severe drops in baseline.

1:00:12.340 --> 1:00:17.340
 Many people do, however, and that's what we call addiction.

1:00:17.880 --> 1:00:20.400
 When somebody pursues a drug or an activity

1:00:20.400 --> 1:00:22.820
 that leads to huge increases in dopamine,

1:00:22.820 --> 1:00:24.300
 and now you understand that afterward

1:00:24.300 --> 1:00:26.780
 the baseline of dopamine drops

1:00:26.780 --> 1:00:28.660
 because of depletion of dopamine,

1:00:28.660 --> 1:00:30.520
 the readily releasable pool,

1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:33.300
 the dopamine is literally not around to be released

1:00:33.300 --> 1:00:35.620
 and so people feel pretty lousy.

1:00:35.620 --> 1:00:38.340
 And many people make the mistake of then going

1:00:38.340 --> 1:00:41.060
 and pursuing the dopamine evoking,

1:00:41.060 --> 1:00:43.240
 the dopamine releasing activity or substance.

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:46.300
 Again, thinking mistakenly

1:00:46.300 --> 1:00:48.100
 that it's going to bring up their baseline.

1:00:48.100 --> 1:00:50.340
 It's going to give them that peak again.

1:00:50.340 --> 1:00:52.020
 Not only does it not give them a peak,

1:00:52.020 --> 1:00:54.200
 their baseline gets lower and lower

1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:57.280
 because they're depleting dopamine more and more and more.

1:00:57.280 --> 1:00:59.480
 And we've seen this over and over again

1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:01.660
 when people get addicted to something,

1:01:01.660 --> 1:01:04.380
 then they're not achieving much pleasure at all.

1:01:05.940 --> 1:01:08.260
 You can even see this with video games.

1:01:08.260 --> 1:01:10.940
 People will play a video game, they love it.

1:01:10.940 --> 1:01:12.700
 It's super exciting to them.

1:01:12.700 --> 1:01:15.200
 And then they'll keep playing and playing and playing.

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.540
 And either one of two things happens, typically both.

1:01:19.540 --> 1:01:23.720
 First of all, we say addiction is a progressive narrowing

1:01:23.720 --> 1:01:25.140
 of the things that bring you pleasure.

1:01:25.140 --> 1:01:26.460
 So oftentimes what will happen

1:01:26.460 --> 1:01:28.460
 is the person only has excitement

1:01:28.460 --> 1:01:31.620
 and can achieve dopamine release

1:01:31.620 --> 1:01:33.700
 to the same extent doing that behavior

1:01:33.700 --> 1:01:35.140
 and not other behaviors.

1:01:35.140 --> 1:01:37.560
 And so they start losing interest in school,

1:01:37.560 --> 1:01:39.900
 they start losing interest in relationships,

1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:42.320
 they start losing interest in fitness and wellbeing

1:01:42.320 --> 1:01:44.980
 and depletes their life.

1:01:44.980 --> 1:01:47.460
 And eventually what typically happens

1:01:47.460 --> 1:01:50.220
 is they will stop getting dopamine release

1:01:50.220 --> 1:01:52.260
 from that activity as well.

1:01:52.260 --> 1:01:55.120
 And then they drop into a pretty serious depression.

1:01:55.120 --> 1:01:57.300
 And this can get very severe and people have committed

1:01:57.300 --> 1:02:01.700
 suicide from these sorts of patterns of activity.

1:02:01.700 --> 1:02:04.200
 But what about the more typical scenario?

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:08.740
 What about the scenario of somebody who is really good

1:02:08.740 --> 1:02:10.100
 at working during the week,

1:02:10.100 --> 1:02:13.680
 they exercise during the week, they drink on the weekends.

1:02:13.680 --> 1:02:16.220
 Well, that person is only consuming alcohol

1:02:16.220 --> 1:02:17.980
 maybe one or two nights a week,

1:02:17.980 --> 1:02:22.500
 but oftentimes that same person will be spiking

1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:25.340
 their dopamine with food during the middle of the week.

1:02:25.340 --> 1:02:27.500
 Now we all have to eat and it's nice to eat foods

1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:28.340
 that we enjoy.

1:02:28.340 --> 1:02:29.460
 I certainly do that.

1:02:29.460 --> 1:02:31.380
 I love food in fact,

1:02:31.380 --> 1:02:34.300
 but let's say they're eating foods

1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:36.180
 that really evoke a lot of dopamine release

1:02:36.180 --> 1:02:37.140
 in the middle of the week,

1:02:37.140 --> 1:02:39.760
 they're drinking one or two days on the weekend.

1:02:39.760 --> 1:02:42.560
 They are one of these work hard, play hard types.

1:02:42.560 --> 1:02:45.340
 So they're swimming a couple miles in the ocean

1:02:45.340 --> 1:02:48.140
 in the middle of the week as well.

1:02:48.140 --> 1:02:49.920
 They're going out dancing once on the weekend.

1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:53.340
 Sounds like a pretty balanced life as I describe it.

1:02:53.340 --> 1:02:55.180
 Well, here's the problem.

1:02:56.060 --> 1:03:00.300
 The problem is that dopamine is not just evoked

1:03:00.300 --> 1:03:01.520
 by one of these activities.

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:04.300
 Dopamine is evoked by all of these activities.

1:03:04.300 --> 1:03:08.900
 And dopamine is one currency of craving motivation

1:03:08.900 --> 1:03:11.220
 and desire and pleasure.

1:03:11.220 --> 1:03:13.460
 There's only one currency.

1:03:13.460 --> 1:03:16.740
 So even though, if you look at the activities,

1:03:16.740 --> 1:03:18.500
 you'd say, well, it's just on the weekends

1:03:18.500 --> 1:03:21.340
 or this thing is only a couple of times a week.

1:03:21.340 --> 1:03:23.860
 If you looked at dopamine simply as a function,

1:03:23.860 --> 1:03:26.940
 as a chemical function of peaks and baseline,

1:03:26.940 --> 1:03:29.500
 it might make sense why this person after several years

1:03:29.500 --> 1:03:32.020
 of work hard, play hard would say,

1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:34.100
 yeah, you know, I'm feeling kind of burnt out.

1:03:34.100 --> 1:03:35.840
 I'm just not feeling like I have the same energy

1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:37.380
 that I did a few years ago.

1:03:37.380 --> 1:03:39.280
 And of course there are age-related reasons

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:42.420
 why people can experience drops in energy,

1:03:42.420 --> 1:03:45.220
 but oftentimes what's happening

1:03:45.220 --> 1:03:48.100
 is not some sort of depletion in cellular metabolism

1:03:48.100 --> 1:03:49.080
 that's related to aging.

1:03:49.080 --> 1:03:51.420
 What's happening is they're spiking their dopamine

1:03:51.420 --> 1:03:54.760
 through so many different activities throughout the week

1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:57.220
 that their baseline is progressively dropping.

1:03:57.220 --> 1:03:59.540
 And in this case, it can be very subtle.

1:03:59.540 --> 1:04:00.880
 It can be very, very subtle.

1:04:00.880 --> 1:04:05.880
 And that's actually a very sinister function of dopamine,

1:04:06.340 --> 1:04:08.860
 we could say, which is that it can often drop

1:04:08.860 --> 1:04:10.740
 in imperceptible ways,

1:04:10.740 --> 1:04:15.340
 but then once it reaches a threshold of low dopamine,

1:04:15.340 --> 1:04:16.460
 we just feel like, hmm,

1:04:16.460 --> 1:04:18.600
 we can't really get pleasure from anything anymore.

1:04:18.600 --> 1:04:20.460
 What used to work doesn't work anymore.

1:04:20.460 --> 1:04:23.100
 So it starts to look a lot like the more severe addictions

1:04:23.100 --> 1:04:25.980
 or the more acute addictions to things like cocaine

1:04:25.980 --> 1:04:28.380
 and amphetamine, which lead to these big increases,

1:04:28.380 --> 1:04:29.620
 these big spikes in dopamine,

1:04:29.620 --> 1:04:33.380
 and then these very severe drops in the baseline.

1:04:33.380 --> 1:04:36.980
 Now, of course, we all should engage in activities

1:04:36.980 --> 1:04:38.240
 that we enjoy.

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:39.820
 I certainly do, everybody should.

1:04:39.820 --> 1:04:42.180
 A huge part of life is pursuing activities

1:04:42.180 --> 1:04:44.680
 and things that we enjoy.

1:04:44.680 --> 1:04:47.220
 The key thing is to understand this relationship

1:04:47.220 --> 1:04:48.640
 between the peaks and the baseline

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.940
 and to understand how they influence one another,

1:04:50.940 --> 1:04:52.300
 because once you do that,

1:04:52.300 --> 1:04:55.340
 you can start to make really good choices in the short run

1:04:55.340 --> 1:04:56.500
 and in the long run

1:04:56.500 --> 1:04:59.860
 to maintain your level of dopamine baseline,

1:04:59.860 --> 1:05:02.860
 maybe even raise that level of dopamine baseline

1:05:02.860 --> 1:05:04.780
 and still get those peaks

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:08.480
 and still achieve those feelings of elevated motivation,

1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:10.000
 elevated desire and craving.

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:12.820
 Because again, those peaks

1:05:12.820 --> 1:05:16.260
 and having a sufficiently healthy high level

1:05:16.260 --> 1:05:17.700
 of dopamine baseline

1:05:17.700 --> 1:05:19.380
 are what drove the evolution of our species

1:05:19.380 --> 1:05:20.740
 and they're really what drive the evolution

1:05:20.740 --> 1:05:22.780
 of anyone's life progression too.

1:05:22.780 --> 1:05:23.600
 So they're a good thing.

1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:25.380
 Dopamine is a good thing.

1:05:25.380 --> 1:05:27.500
 Just very briefly, because it was also covered

1:05:27.500 --> 1:05:29.940
 in the interview episode I did with Anna Lemke

1:05:30.980 --> 1:05:32.480
 about addiction.

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:34.160
 Some of you might be asking,

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:36.620
 what should I do if I experience a drop

1:05:36.620 --> 1:05:38.820
 in my baseline level of dopamine

1:05:38.820 --> 1:05:41.620
 because of engagement with some activity

1:05:41.620 --> 1:05:44.100
 or some substance that led to big peaks?

1:05:45.200 --> 1:05:48.100
 Just to put some color and example on this,

1:05:48.100 --> 1:05:49.080
 a few episodes ago,

1:05:49.080 --> 1:05:52.380
 I talked about a friend who I've known a long time.

1:05:52.380 --> 1:05:53.920
 So actually the child of a friend

1:05:53.920 --> 1:05:57.520
 who has basically become addicted to video games.

1:05:57.520 --> 1:05:58.700
 He decided actually,

1:05:58.700 --> 1:06:00.200
 after seeing that episode with Anna

1:06:00.200 --> 1:06:04.380
 to do a 30 day complete fast from phone,

1:06:04.380 --> 1:06:07.420
 from video games and from social media of all kinds.

1:06:07.420 --> 1:06:08.900
 He's now at day 29.

1:06:08.900 --> 1:06:11.020
 He's really accomplished this.

1:06:11.020 --> 1:06:13.380
 Not incidentally, his levels of concentration,

1:06:13.380 --> 1:06:14.540
 his overall mood are up.

1:06:14.540 --> 1:06:16.880
 He's doing far, far better.

1:06:16.880 --> 1:06:18.100
 What he did is hard.

1:06:18.100 --> 1:06:20.600
 In particular, the first 14 days is really hard.

1:06:20.600 --> 1:06:23.900
 But the way that you replenish the releasable pool

1:06:23.900 --> 1:06:25.880
 of dopamine is to not engage

1:06:25.880 --> 1:06:29.100
 in these dopaminergic seeking behaviors.

1:06:29.100 --> 1:06:31.460
 Because remember, typically people arrive

1:06:31.460 --> 1:06:33.380
 at a place where they want to stop engaging

1:06:33.380 --> 1:06:35.180
 in these behaviors or ingesting substances

1:06:35.180 --> 1:06:37.140
 when that dopamine is depleted,

1:06:37.140 --> 1:06:38.660
 when they're not getting the same lift.

1:06:38.660 --> 1:06:40.240
 In his case, he was feeling depressed.

1:06:40.240 --> 1:06:41.540
 He thought he had ADHD.

1:06:41.540 --> 1:06:44.420
 They were starting to treat it as ADHD.

1:06:44.420 --> 1:06:47.140
 And certainly there are people out there who have ADHD,

1:06:47.140 --> 1:06:48.640
 but what he found was that his levels

1:06:48.640 --> 1:06:49.660
 of concentration are back.

1:06:49.660 --> 1:06:52.700
 He does not need to be treated for ADHD.

1:06:52.700 --> 1:06:54.060
 And actually the psychiatrist wondered

1:06:54.060 --> 1:06:58.020
 if he did prior to this video game, social media fast.

1:06:58.020 --> 1:06:58.860
 He's feeling good.

1:06:58.860 --> 1:07:01.580
 He's exercising again, not making this up.

1:07:01.580 --> 1:07:04.860
 This is really a very specific,

1:07:04.860 --> 1:07:07.340
 but very relevant example

1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:10.660
 of how the dopamine system can replenish itself.

1:07:10.660 --> 1:07:13.180
 Of course, if there's a clinical need for ADHD treatment,

1:07:13.180 --> 1:07:14.700
 by all means pursue that.

1:07:14.700 --> 1:07:19.300
 But I think a lot of ADHD does go misdiagnosed

1:07:19.300 --> 1:07:21.900
 because of this depletion in dopamine that occurs

1:07:21.900 --> 1:07:23.980
 because of overindulgence and other activities

1:07:23.980 --> 1:07:25.660
 in the drop in baseline.

1:07:25.660 --> 1:07:28.700
 So for anyone that's experienced a real drop in baseline

1:07:28.700 --> 1:07:31.180
 who has addictive tendencies,

1:07:31.180 --> 1:07:32.840
 whether or not their behaviors or substances,

1:07:32.840 --> 1:07:36.980
 that is always going to be the path forward,

1:07:36.980 --> 1:07:38.900
 is going to be either cold turkey

1:07:38.900 --> 1:07:42.780
 or through some sort of tapering to limit interactions

1:07:42.780 --> 1:07:44.420
 with what would otherwise be

1:07:44.420 --> 1:07:47.380
 the dopamine evoking behavior or substance.

1:07:47.380 --> 1:07:49.300
 So let's talk about the optimal way

1:07:49.300 --> 1:07:54.160
 to engage in activities or to consume things

1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:55.700
 that evoke dopamine.

1:07:55.700 --> 1:07:57.300
 And by no means am I encouraging people

1:07:57.300 --> 1:07:58.360
 to take drugs of abuse.

1:07:58.360 --> 1:07:59.300
 I would not do that.

1:07:59.300 --> 1:08:00.540
 I am not doing that.

1:08:00.540 --> 1:08:03.180
 But some of the things on these lists

1:08:03.180 --> 1:08:05.260
 of dopamine evoking activities

1:08:05.260 --> 1:08:08.260
 are things like chocolate, coffee,

1:08:08.260 --> 1:08:09.500
 even if it's indirect,

1:08:10.900 --> 1:08:12.940
 sex and reproduction provided it's healthy,

1:08:12.940 --> 1:08:15.100
 consensual, context appropriate,

1:08:15.100 --> 1:08:17.460
 age appropriate, species appropriate, of course,

1:08:17.460 --> 1:08:21.820
 is central to our evolution and progression as a species.

1:08:21.820 --> 1:08:24.760
 So certain things like cocaine, amphetamine,

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:26.860
 I will put in the classification of bad.

1:08:26.860 --> 1:08:27.700
 I'm willing to do that.

1:08:27.700 --> 1:08:31.180
 And other things are part of life, food, exercise.

1:08:31.180 --> 1:08:32.580
 If that evokes your dopamine,

1:08:32.580 --> 1:08:33.840
 how are we supposed to engage

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:37.020
 with these dopamine evoking activities in ways

1:08:37.020 --> 1:08:38.520
 that are healthy and beneficial for us?

1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:40.240
 How do we achieve these peaks,

1:08:40.240 --> 1:08:41.860
 which are so central to our wellbeing

1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:45.040
 and experience of life without dropping our baseline?

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:50.040
 And the key lies in intermittent release of dopamine.

1:08:50.260 --> 1:08:54.300
 The real key is to not expect

1:08:54.300 --> 1:08:57.060
 or chase high levels of dopamine release

1:08:57.060 --> 1:08:59.980
 every time we engage in these activities.

1:09:01.820 --> 1:09:05.180
 Intermittent reward schedules are the central schedule

1:09:05.180 --> 1:09:08.780
 by which casinos keep you gambling,

1:09:08.780 --> 1:09:12.360
 the central schedule by which elusive partners

1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:15.180
 or potential partners keep you texting and pursuing

1:09:16.220 --> 1:09:18.700
 on either side of the relationship.

1:09:18.700 --> 1:09:20.620
 Intermittent schedules are the way

1:09:20.620 --> 1:09:23.520
 that the internet and social media

1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:27.020
 and all highly engaging activities

1:09:27.020 --> 1:09:31.380
 keep you motivated and pursuing.

1:09:31.380 --> 1:09:32.740
 And we can take this back

1:09:32.740 --> 1:09:36.260
 to our evolutionary adaptive scenario

1:09:36.260 --> 1:09:40.000
 where you are out there looking for water, looking for food,

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.820
 not every trail, not every pursuit,

1:09:42.820 --> 1:09:46.660
 not every hunch about where the animals will be,

1:09:46.660 --> 1:09:49.780
 where the food will be, where the berries will be,

1:09:49.780 --> 1:09:51.860
 not every single one of those played out.

1:09:54.140 --> 1:09:56.560
 There's something called dopamine reward prediction error.

1:09:56.560 --> 1:09:58.900
 When we expect something to happen,

1:09:58.900 --> 1:10:00.920
 we are highly motivated to pursue it.

1:10:01.860 --> 1:10:04.700
 If it happens, great, we get the reward.

1:10:04.700 --> 1:10:06.640
 The reward comes in various chemical forms,

1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:08.140
 including dopamine,

1:10:08.140 --> 1:10:11.020
 and we are more likely to engage in that behavior again.

1:10:11.020 --> 1:10:13.560
 This is the basis of casino gambling.

1:10:13.560 --> 1:10:14.820
 This is how they keep you going back

1:10:14.820 --> 1:10:15.940
 again and again and again,

1:10:15.940 --> 1:10:19.060
 even though on average, the house really does win.

1:10:20.700 --> 1:10:22.420
 You can transplant that example

1:10:22.420 --> 1:10:24.660
 to any number of different pleasureful activities.

1:10:24.660 --> 1:10:27.140
 If you're not a gambler and that doesn't appeal to you,

1:10:27.140 --> 1:10:29.340
 I have to imagine there's something that appeals to you,

1:10:29.340 --> 1:10:31.940
 something that you do repeatedly because you enjoy it.

1:10:31.940 --> 1:10:33.140
 And almost inevitably,

1:10:33.140 --> 1:10:36.140
 it's because there's an intermittent schedule.

1:10:36.140 --> 1:10:40.000
 There's a intermittent schedule by which dopamine

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.100
 sometimes arrives, sometimes a little bit,

1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:45.860
 sometimes a lot, sometimes a medium amount, okay?

1:10:45.860 --> 1:10:48.220
 That intermittent reinforcement schedule

1:10:48.220 --> 1:10:53.220
 is actually the best schedule to export to other activities.

1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:54.940
 How do you do that?

1:10:54.940 --> 1:10:56.200
 Well, first of all,

1:10:57.220 --> 1:10:59.460
 if you are engaged in activities,

1:10:59.460 --> 1:11:01.760
 school, sport, relationship, et cetera,

1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:04.120
 where you experience a win,

1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:06.820
 you should be very careful about allowing yourself

1:11:06.820 --> 1:11:09.100
 to experience huge peaks in dopamine,

1:11:09.100 --> 1:11:12.540
 unless you're willing to suffer the crash that follows

1:11:13.380 --> 1:11:17.060
 and waiting a period of time for it to come back up.

1:11:17.060 --> 1:11:18.960
 What would this look like in the practical sense?

1:11:18.960 --> 1:11:20.200
 Well, let's say you are somebody

1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:22.380
 who really does enjoy exercise,

1:11:22.380 --> 1:11:24.640
 or let's say you're somebody who kind of likes exercise,

1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:26.260
 but forces yourself to do it,

1:11:26.260 --> 1:11:27.500
 but you make it pleasureful

1:11:27.500 --> 1:11:30.460
 by giving yourself your favorite cup of coffee first,

1:11:30.460 --> 1:11:32.500
 or maybe taking a pre-workout drink,

1:11:32.500 --> 1:11:34.120
 or taking an energy drink,

1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:35.660
 or listening to your favorite music,

1:11:35.660 --> 1:11:37.440
 and then you're in the gym and you're listening to your music

1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:39.080
 that all sounds great, right?

1:11:39.080 --> 1:11:42.260
 Well, it is great, except that by layering together

1:11:42.260 --> 1:11:44.780
 all these things to try and achieve that dopamine release,

1:11:44.780 --> 1:11:46.780
 and by getting a big peak in dopamine,

1:11:46.780 --> 1:11:50.900
 you're actually increasing the number of conditions required

1:11:50.900 --> 1:11:53.540
 to achieve pleasure from that activity again.

1:11:53.540 --> 1:11:55.820
 And so there is a form of this

1:11:55.820 --> 1:11:58.180
 where sometimes you do all the things that you love

1:11:58.180 --> 1:11:59.340
 to get the optimal workout.

1:11:59.340 --> 1:12:00.860
 You listen to your favorite music,

1:12:00.860 --> 1:12:02.620
 you go at your favorite time of day,

1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:04.520
 you have your pre-workout drink if that's your thing,

1:12:04.520 --> 1:12:08.300
 you do all the things that give you that best experience

1:12:08.300 --> 1:12:09.860
 of the workout for you.

1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:12.620
 But there's also a version of this

1:12:12.620 --> 1:12:14.960
 where sometimes you don't do

1:12:14.960 --> 1:12:17.180
 the dopamine-enhancing activities.

1:12:17.180 --> 1:12:19.860
 You don't ingest anything to increase your dopamine.

1:12:19.860 --> 1:12:22.780
 You just do the exercise.

1:12:22.780 --> 1:12:27.380
 You don't do the exercise and expect dopamine to arrive

1:12:27.380 --> 1:12:30.500
 through some what we call exogenous source as well.

1:12:30.500 --> 1:12:31.860
 You might think, well, that sounds lame.

1:12:31.860 --> 1:12:34.980
 I want to continue to enjoy exercising.

1:12:34.980 --> 1:12:36.840
 Ah, but that's exactly the point.

1:12:37.820 --> 1:12:39.380
 If you want to maintain motivation

1:12:39.380 --> 1:12:41.260
 for school, exercise, relationships,

1:12:41.260 --> 1:12:44.120
 or pursuits of any duration in kind,

1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:47.720
 the key thing is to make sure that the peak in dopamine,

1:12:47.720 --> 1:12:51.260
 if it's very high, doesn't occur too often.

1:12:51.260 --> 1:12:54.380
 And if something does occur very often

1:12:54.380 --> 1:12:56.820
 that you vary how much dopamine you experience

1:12:57.860 --> 1:13:00.260
 with each engagement in that activity.

1:13:00.260 --> 1:13:02.500
 Now, some activities naturally have

1:13:02.500 --> 1:13:05.260
 this intermittent property woven into them, right?

1:13:05.260 --> 1:13:07.940
 We sometimes have classes that we like

1:13:07.940 --> 1:13:09.380
 and other classes we don't like.

1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:11.380
 We don't always get straight A's.

1:13:11.380 --> 1:13:13.000
 Sometimes we don't get rewarded

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.740
 with the outcome that we would like.

1:13:14.740 --> 1:13:17.980
 We don't always have the perfect relationship outcome,

1:13:17.980 --> 1:13:21.420
 but understand that your ability to experience motivation

1:13:21.420 --> 1:13:24.220
 and pleasure for what comes next is dictated

1:13:24.220 --> 1:13:25.940
 by how much motivation and pleasure

1:13:25.940 --> 1:13:28.260
 and dopamine you experienced prior.

1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:32.420
 The reason I can't give a very specific protocol

1:13:32.420 --> 1:13:36.020
 like delete dopamine or lower dopamine every third time

1:13:36.020 --> 1:13:38.200
 is that that wouldn't be intermittent.

1:13:38.200 --> 1:13:40.700
 The whole basis of intermittent reinforcement

1:13:40.700 --> 1:13:44.460
 is that you don't really have a specific schedule

1:13:44.460 --> 1:13:46.580
 of when dopamine is going to be high

1:13:46.580 --> 1:13:48.020
 and when dopamine is going to be low

1:13:48.020 --> 1:13:49.840
 and when dopamine is going to be medium.

1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:51.320
 That's a predictable schedule,

1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:53.900
 not a random intermittent schedule.

1:13:53.900 --> 1:13:57.180
 So do like the casinos do, certainly works for them.

1:13:57.180 --> 1:13:59.980
 And for activities that you would like to continue

1:13:59.980 --> 1:14:03.960
 to engage in over time, whatever those happen to be,

1:14:03.960 --> 1:14:07.100
 start paying attention to the amount of dopamine

1:14:07.100 --> 1:14:09.340
 and excitement and pleasure that you achieve with those

1:14:09.340 --> 1:14:11.980
 and start modulating that somewhat at random.

1:14:11.980 --> 1:14:15.060
 That might be removing some of the dopamine

1:14:15.060 --> 1:14:18.100
 releasing chemicals that you might take prior.

1:14:18.100 --> 1:14:21.020
 Maybe you remove them every time,

1:14:21.020 --> 1:14:23.540
 but then every once in a while, you introduce them.

1:14:23.540 --> 1:14:27.460
 Maybe it involves sometimes doing things socially

1:14:27.460 --> 1:14:28.580
 that you enjoy doing socially,

1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:30.780
 sometimes doing the same thing, but alone.

1:14:31.880 --> 1:14:34.180
 There are a lot of different ways to do this.

1:14:34.180 --> 1:14:36.240
 There are a lot of different ways to approach this,

1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:38.860
 but now knowing what you know about peaks

1:14:38.860 --> 1:14:41.660
 and baselines in dopamine and understanding

1:14:41.660 --> 1:14:43.940
 how important it is not just to achieve peaks,

1:14:43.940 --> 1:14:46.380
 but to maintain that baseline at a healthy level,

1:14:46.380 --> 1:14:48.500
 it should be straightforward for you to implement

1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:49.980
 these intermittent schedules.

1:14:49.980 --> 1:14:53.500
 For those of you that are begging for more specificity,

1:14:54.340 --> 1:14:55.740
 we can give you a tool.

1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:59.260
 One would be you can flip a coin before engaging

1:14:59.260 --> 1:15:01.520
 in any of these types of activities and decide

1:15:01.520 --> 1:15:04.100
 whether or not you are going to allow

1:15:04.100 --> 1:15:08.540
 other dopamine supportive elements to go, for instance,

1:15:08.540 --> 1:15:09.540
 into the gym with you.

1:15:09.540 --> 1:15:10.980
 Are you going to listen to music or not?

1:15:10.980 --> 1:15:13.620
 If you enjoy listening to music, well then flip a coin.

1:15:13.620 --> 1:15:15.380
 And if it comes up heads, bring the music in.

1:15:15.380 --> 1:15:17.060
 If it comes up tails, don't.

1:15:17.060 --> 1:15:19.940
 Okay, sounds like you're undercutting your own progress,

1:15:19.940 --> 1:15:23.040
 but actually you are serving your own progress,

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:25.740
 both short-term and long-term by doing that.

1:15:25.740 --> 1:15:29.020
 Now, the smartphone is a very interesting tool

1:15:29.020 --> 1:15:30.980
 for dopamine in light of all this.

1:15:31.980 --> 1:15:35.160
 It's extremely common nowadays to see people texting

1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:39.180
 and doing selfies and communicating in various ways,

1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:41.660
 listening to podcasts, listening to music,

1:15:41.660 --> 1:15:43.620
 doing all sorts of things while they engage

1:15:43.620 --> 1:15:45.240
 in other activities or going to dinner

1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.860
 and texting other people or making plans,

1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:49.660
 sharing information, that's all wonderful.

1:15:49.660 --> 1:15:52.540
 It gives depth and richness and color to life.

1:15:52.540 --> 1:15:56.900
 But it isn't just about our distracted nature

1:15:56.900 --> 1:15:59.440
 when we're engaging with the phone.

1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:02.300
 It's also a way of layering in dopamine.

1:16:02.300 --> 1:16:06.660
 And it's no surprise that levels of depression

1:16:06.660 --> 1:16:09.680
 and lack of motivation are really on the increase.

1:16:11.180 --> 1:16:13.380
 Everything that we've talked about until now

1:16:14.380 --> 1:16:17.540
 sets up an explanation or interpretation

1:16:17.540 --> 1:16:21.220
 of why interacting with digital technology

1:16:21.220 --> 1:16:23.420
 can potentially lead to disruptions

1:16:23.420 --> 1:16:26.960
 or lowering in baseline levels of dopamine.

1:16:28.860 --> 1:16:30.620
 I can use a personal example for this.

1:16:30.620 --> 1:16:32.220
 I happen to really enjoy working out.

1:16:32.220 --> 1:16:33.900
 I've always really enjoyed it.

1:16:33.900 --> 1:16:38.020
 But in recent years, I noticed that if I was bringing

1:16:38.020 --> 1:16:39.780
 my phone to my workouts,

1:16:39.780 --> 1:16:41.980
 then not only was I a little bit more distracted

1:16:41.980 --> 1:16:43.580
 and not focusing on what I was doing

1:16:43.580 --> 1:16:45.800
 as much as I could have or should have,

1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:49.400
 but also I started to lose interest in what I was doing.

1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:50.820
 It wasn't as pleasureful.

1:16:50.820 --> 1:16:53.680
 I would feel like it just didn't have the same kind of oomph

1:16:53.680 --> 1:16:55.980
 and I was beginning to question my motivation.

1:16:56.860 --> 1:16:59.620
 As I started learning more about this relationship

1:16:59.620 --> 1:17:02.020
 between the peaks and the baselines and dopamine,

1:17:02.020 --> 1:17:04.380
 what I realized was that some time ago

1:17:04.380 --> 1:17:07.560
 I probably experienced a incredible increase

1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:09.900
 in the amount of dopamine during one of my workouts

1:17:09.900 --> 1:17:13.760
 because I enjoy working out and I enjoy listening to music.

1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:15.280
 I also enjoy listening to podcasts.

1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:17.360
 I also enjoy communicating with people.

1:17:17.360 --> 1:17:18.700
 Those are all wonderful pursuits,

1:17:18.700 --> 1:17:22.540
 but I had layered in too many of them too many times.

1:17:22.540 --> 1:17:25.940
 And then it essentially wasn't working for me anymore.

1:17:25.940 --> 1:17:28.140
 Much in the same way a drug wouldn't work for somebody

1:17:28.140 --> 1:17:29.060
 who takes it repeatedly

1:17:29.060 --> 1:17:31.520
 because their baseline of dopamine is dropping.

1:17:31.520 --> 1:17:33.860
 So at least for this calendar year,

1:17:33.860 --> 1:17:35.380
 I've made a rule for myself,

1:17:35.380 --> 1:17:40.380
 which is I don't allow my phone into my workouts at all.

1:17:40.400 --> 1:17:42.580
 No music, at least not from the phone.

1:17:42.580 --> 1:17:43.680
 It can be in the room.

1:17:43.680 --> 1:17:46.920
 I might listen to a podcast in the room,

1:17:46.920 --> 1:17:49.060
 but I don't listen to anything

1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:51.440
 or engage in anything on my phone, no texting whatsoever.

1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:53.440
 And most of the time I just don't even bring it with me

1:17:53.440 --> 1:17:54.480
 for that period of time.

1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:56.340
 It's only a short period of time.

1:17:56.340 --> 1:17:57.980
 I'm not training that often.

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:03.940
 This is something that I think has been misinterpreted

1:18:03.940 --> 1:18:06.400
 as people can't be alone now.

1:18:06.400 --> 1:18:07.880
 People talk about, oh, you know,

1:18:07.880 --> 1:18:10.180
 they can't walk across the street

1:18:10.180 --> 1:18:13.320
 or they can't go anywhere, ride the bus,

1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:15.720
 can't be on the plane without being in contact.

1:18:15.720 --> 1:18:17.360
 They can't handle just their thoughts.

1:18:17.360 --> 1:18:19.120
 I don't think that's really what's going on.

1:18:19.120 --> 1:18:22.360
 I think what's happened is that we achieved

1:18:22.360 --> 1:18:23.780
 the great dopamine increase

1:18:23.780 --> 1:18:25.520
 that comes from this incredible thing,

1:18:25.520 --> 1:18:29.120
 which I personally enjoy being able to communicate by phone,

1:18:29.120 --> 1:18:31.380
 by text and exchange pictures and send links

1:18:31.380 --> 1:18:33.520
 and these kinds of things, social media.

1:18:33.520 --> 1:18:36.240
 But then what happens is it doesn't have

1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:38.620
 that same fulfilling aspect to it.

1:18:38.620 --> 1:18:42.000
 And it tends to remove the excitement and the pleasure

1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.640
 of the very activities that we are engaged in.

1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:46.860
 So I know this is a hard one for many people,

1:18:46.860 --> 1:18:51.580
 but I do invite you to try removing multiple sources

1:18:51.580 --> 1:18:54.800
 of dopamine release or what used to be multiple sources

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:57.080
 of dopamine release from activities

1:18:57.080 --> 1:18:58.940
 that you want to continue to enjoy

1:18:58.940 --> 1:19:00.800
 or that you want to enjoy more.

1:19:00.800 --> 1:19:03.000
 And now you understand the biological mechanisms

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:05.760
 that would underlie a statement like that.

1:19:05.760 --> 1:19:07.800
 It takes a little bit of working with.

1:19:07.800 --> 1:19:10.800
 I know it can be challenging in the first week or so

1:19:10.800 --> 1:19:14.160
 of not engaging with the phone during any kind of workout.

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:16.000
 That actually was really tough,

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.960
 but now I'm back to a place where I enjoy it that much more.

1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:20.560
 I also feel as if I conquered something

1:19:20.560 --> 1:19:23.280
 in terms of the circuitry related to dopamine.

1:19:23.280 --> 1:19:26.720
 I now understand why something that I enjoyed so much

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:29.400
 had become less pleasureful for me.

1:19:29.400 --> 1:19:31.560
 And there's a deep, deep satisfaction

1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:32.720
 that comes from understanding, okay,

1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:36.280
 there wasn't anything wrong with me or what I was doing

1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:38.440
 or anything at all.

1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:40.080
 It was just, there was something wrong

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:41.360
 with the approach I was taking,

1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:43.640
 which was layering in all these sources of dopamine

1:19:43.640 --> 1:19:45.240
 and dropping my baseline.

1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:46.600
 For this very same reason,

1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:49.660
 I caution people against using stimulants

1:19:49.660 --> 1:19:54.660
 every time they study or every time they work out

1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:57.380
 or every time that they do anything

1:19:57.380 --> 1:19:59.040
 that they would like to continue to enjoy

1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:00.920
 and be motivated at.

1:20:00.920 --> 1:20:02.660
 There's one exception, which is caffeine,

1:20:02.660 --> 1:20:06.680
 because I mentioned before, if you like caffeine,

1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:08.660
 that actually could be a good thing for your dopamine system

1:20:08.660 --> 1:20:11.760
 because it does upregulate these D2, D3 receptors.

1:20:11.760 --> 1:20:13.840
 So it actually makes whatever dopamine

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:17.120
 is released by that activity more accessible

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:19.880
 or more functional within the biochemistry

1:20:19.880 --> 1:20:21.960
 and the pathways of your brain and body.

1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:25.880
 However, a number of energy drinks

1:20:25.880 --> 1:20:28.400
 and in particular pre-workouts contain things

1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:31.640
 that are precursors to dopamine and on their own,

1:20:31.640 --> 1:20:33.800
 even if you didn't engage in the activity,

1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:36.720
 would cause the release of dopamine to a substantial degree.

1:20:36.720 --> 1:20:38.480
 They do cause the release of dopamine

1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:40.200
 to a substantial degree.

1:20:40.200 --> 1:20:44.080
 And over time, that will deplete your dopamine.

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:48.320
 So energy drinks, pre-workout drinks,

1:20:48.320 --> 1:20:51.280
 drugs of various kinds that people take to study

1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:52.120
 and pay attention.

1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:54.040
 We talked about some of these for the ADHD episode,

1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:58.280
 things like Adderall, Ritalin, armodafinil, modafinil.

1:20:58.280 --> 1:21:01.920
 Taken repeatedly over time will reduce

1:21:01.920 --> 1:21:04.200
 the level of satisfaction and joy that you get

1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:07.740
 from the activities you engage in while under the influence

1:21:07.740 --> 1:21:10.040
 of those compounds.

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.820
 I'm not trying to demonize those compounds

1:21:11.820 --> 1:21:13.020
 for their clinical use.

1:21:13.020 --> 1:21:14.880
 What I'm saying is taking stimulants

1:21:14.880 --> 1:21:17.560
 and then engaging in activities that you would like

1:21:17.560 --> 1:21:20.920
 to continue to feel pleasureful is undercutting the process.

1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:23.660
 And inevitably, it might not happen tomorrow,

1:21:23.660 --> 1:21:24.900
 might not happen in a month,

1:21:24.900 --> 1:21:27.120
 but inevitably you will have challenges

1:21:27.120 --> 1:21:30.480
 with motivation and drive related to those activities.

1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:32.240
 Now, some people can keep it right in check.

1:21:32.240 --> 1:21:34.720
 They can just do the one can of the energy drink

1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:36.840
 or they only do their pre-workout

1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:39.920
 before really hard days, for instance.

1:21:39.920 --> 1:21:40.980
 More power to you.

1:21:42.400 --> 1:21:44.740
 I actually do that sometimes, frankly.

1:21:44.740 --> 1:21:47.400
 But people who are trying to get into that peak,

1:21:47.400 --> 1:21:49.640
 super motivated, driven, driven state,

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:52.880
 really focused every time they engage in an activity,

1:21:52.880 --> 1:21:55.200
 you are absolutely undercutting the process

1:21:55.200 --> 1:21:56.780
 and you are undermining your ability

1:21:56.780 --> 1:21:58.880
 to stay motivated and focused.

1:21:58.880 --> 1:22:02.920
 So just as we talked about intermittent reward schedules

1:22:02.920 --> 1:22:07.160
 a moment ago, intermittent spiking of dopamine,

1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:10.280
 if you do it at all, is definitely the way to go.

1:22:10.280 --> 1:22:13.000
 And chronically trying to spike your dopamine

1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:15.900
 in order to enhance your motivation, focus, and drive

1:22:15.900 --> 1:22:18.880
 will absolutely undermine your motivation, focus,

1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:20.480
 and drive in the long run.

1:22:20.480 --> 1:22:24.760
 Ingestion of caffeine is somewhat of an exception

1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:27.420
 among the other examples of things I've mentioned

1:22:27.420 --> 1:22:30.200
 to avoid before what would otherwise be

1:22:30.200 --> 1:22:32.240
 dopamine-increasing activities.

1:22:32.240 --> 1:22:37.240
 Because again, caffeine can increase the density

1:22:37.540 --> 1:22:40.280
 and the efficacy of these dopamine receptors.

1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:45.140
 Turns out that the source of caffeine could also matter.

1:22:45.140 --> 1:22:48.880
 While coffee or tea or other forms of caffeine

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:51.720
 will have this effect of increasing dopamine receptors,

1:22:52.660 --> 1:22:55.380
 yerba mate, something I've talked about before

1:22:55.380 --> 1:22:58.160
 on this podcast, has some interesting properties.

1:22:58.160 --> 1:22:59.920
 First of all, it contains caffeine.

1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:02.000
 It's also high in antioxidants.

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.640
 It also contains something called GLP-1,

1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:07.780
 which is favorable for management of blood sugar levels.

1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:13.000
 Yerba mate, it turns out, has also been shown

1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:17.960
 to be neuroprotective specifically for dopaminergic neurons.

1:23:17.960 --> 1:23:20.120
 Now, I should mention this is just a couple of studies,

1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:23.020
 so we don't want to conclude too much from these studies.

1:23:23.020 --> 1:23:24.460
 More needs to be done.

1:23:24.460 --> 1:23:27.800
 But they showed that in a model of damage

1:23:27.800 --> 1:23:31.120
 to dopamine neurons, ingestion of yerba mate

1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:33.300
 and some of the compounds within yerba mate

1:23:33.300 --> 1:23:35.800
 can actually serve to preserve the survival

1:23:35.800 --> 1:23:39.080
 of dopamine neurons in both the movement-related pathway

1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:41.240
 and the motivation pathway.

1:23:41.240 --> 1:23:44.100
 So perhaps you need that incentive

1:23:44.100 --> 1:23:46.160
 in order to ingest yerba mate tea.

1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:48.240
 Perhaps you don't need any incentive.

1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:49.740
 In my case, I don't need any incentive.

1:23:49.740 --> 1:23:53.220
 I already enjoy yerba mate as my principal source of caffeine

1:23:53.220 --> 1:23:55.120
 although I do drink coffee as well.

1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:57.840
 But if one were going to consume caffeine,

1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:00.120
 you might consider consuming that caffeine

1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:02.000
 in the form of yerba mate,

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:05.040
 both for sake of upregulating dopamine receptors

1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:07.800
 and getting more of a dopamine increase.

1:24:07.800 --> 1:24:10.400
 And of course, for the stimulant properties of caffeine,

1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:12.520
 if that's what you're seeking.

1:24:12.520 --> 1:24:13.960
 And in addition to that,

1:24:13.960 --> 1:24:16.760
 because yerba mate does appear to have

1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:18.520
 some sort of neuroprotective

1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:22.100
 and in particular dopamine neuron protective properties.

1:24:22.100 --> 1:24:24.540
 Now that doesn't mean that caffeine is always beneficial.

1:24:24.540 --> 1:24:27.540
 And actually there's one instance related to dopamine

1:24:27.540 --> 1:24:30.760
 where caffeine can be particularly dangerous.

1:24:30.760 --> 1:24:33.340
 This relates to MDMA, so-called ecstasy.

1:24:33.340 --> 1:24:37.460
 MDMA is under investigation in various clinical trials

1:24:37.460 --> 1:24:40.340
 for its potential to treat trauma and depression.

1:24:41.900 --> 1:24:44.760
 It's also of course, a drug that's used recreationally.

1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:47.600
 It's still illegal, at least in the United States.

1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:52.600
 So whether or not MDMA is neurotoxic

1:24:52.600 --> 1:24:53.820
 has been very controversial.

1:24:53.820 --> 1:24:56.240
 Early on, it was thought that it is neurotoxic,

1:24:56.240 --> 1:24:58.880
 that it can destroy serotonergic neurons.

1:24:59.940 --> 1:25:01.680
 There were other papers that came out

1:25:01.680 --> 1:25:04.520
 which argued that's not the case.

1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:07.660
 And that's in particular because one of the early papers

1:25:07.660 --> 1:25:09.160
 published in Science Magazine

1:25:10.060 --> 1:25:12.220
 claiming that MDMA was neurotoxic,

1:25:13.380 --> 1:25:14.700
 that paper was retracted.

1:25:14.700 --> 1:25:17.860
 It turns out that that study had mistakenly used

1:25:17.860 --> 1:25:19.500
 methamphetamine instead,

1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:21.880
 and methamphetamine is known to be neurotoxic.

1:25:23.420 --> 1:25:25.420
 I think most of the data point to the idea

1:25:25.420 --> 1:25:29.980
 that MDMA might not be neurotoxic, but in any case,

1:25:29.980 --> 1:25:32.260
 caffeine has been shown to increase

1:25:32.260 --> 1:25:34.580
 the toxicity of MDMA receptors.

1:25:34.580 --> 1:25:36.420
 And you might say, well, how could that be?

1:25:36.420 --> 1:25:39.420
 Well, now you understand why that could be.

1:25:39.420 --> 1:25:42.460
 Caffeine increases the density and efficacy

1:25:42.460 --> 1:25:45.260
 of these dopamine receptors, the D2 and D3 receptors.

1:25:45.260 --> 1:25:50.260
 MDMA is a potent drug for increasing concentrations

1:25:50.420 --> 1:25:53.820
 of dopamine as well as serotonin and other neuromodulators.

1:25:53.820 --> 1:25:56.100
 And it appears that caffeine ingestion

1:25:56.100 --> 1:25:58.240
 by upregulating these receptors

1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:02.420
 can lead to more toxicity of MDMA.

1:26:02.420 --> 1:26:06.740
 So caffeine can be a beneficial substance in one context

1:26:06.740 --> 1:26:08.820
 and actually can be a detrimental

1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:11.940
 if not dangerous substance in another context.

1:26:11.940 --> 1:26:14.660
 Two substances that greatly increase dopamine,

1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:17.600
 namely amphetamine and cocaine,

1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:22.540
 can cause long-term problems with the dopaminergic pathways.

1:26:22.540 --> 1:26:24.800
 And this is largely based on a study

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:27.840
 that was published some years ago, 2003,

1:26:27.840 --> 1:26:29.820
 but still holds a lot of merit.

1:26:29.820 --> 1:26:31.380
 This is a paper published in

1:26:31.380 --> 1:26:33.240
 Proscenes in the National Academy of Sciences,

1:26:33.240 --> 1:26:36.940
 a very high tier stringent journal.

1:26:36.940 --> 1:26:38.900
 First author is Kolb, K-O-L-B.

1:26:38.900 --> 1:26:42.400
 And the title of the paper pretty much tells the story.

1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:45.120
 Amphetamine or cocaine limits the ability

1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:47.860
 of later experience to promote structural plasticity

1:26:47.860 --> 1:26:49.420
 in the neocortex and nucleus accumbens.

1:26:49.420 --> 1:26:54.080
 Neocortex is the outer shell of the brain, more or less,

1:26:54.080 --> 1:26:55.740
 and the nucleus accumbens is part

1:26:55.740 --> 1:26:58.500
 of that mesolimbic dopamine pathway

1:26:58.500 --> 1:27:01.420
 for motivation, drive, and reinforcement.

1:27:01.420 --> 1:27:02.700
 Neuroplasticity, of course,

1:27:02.700 --> 1:27:04.180
 is the brain's ability to change

1:27:04.180 --> 1:27:05.220
 in response to experience.

1:27:05.220 --> 1:27:08.580
 And neuroplasticity is the basis of learning

1:27:08.580 --> 1:27:12.140
 and memory and essentially remodeling

1:27:12.140 --> 1:27:15.420
 of our neural circuitry in positive ways of all kinds.

1:27:15.420 --> 1:27:18.780
 And this study was really one of the first to show

1:27:18.780 --> 1:27:21.740
 that ingesting amphetamine and cocaine

1:27:21.740 --> 1:27:26.160
 because of the high peak in dopamine that it creates

1:27:26.160 --> 1:27:27.980
 and the low dopamine state,

1:27:27.980 --> 1:27:31.740
 the baseline drop that it creates afterwards,

1:27:31.740 --> 1:27:34.200
 limits plasticity and learning subsequent

1:27:34.200 --> 1:27:36.340
 to taking amphetamine and cocaine.

1:27:36.340 --> 1:27:38.500
 It was, at least in this study,

1:27:38.500 --> 1:27:40.340
 shown to be a long-lasting effect.

1:27:40.340 --> 1:27:41.860
 I doubt it's a permanent effect,

1:27:41.860 --> 1:27:45.260
 but this should serve as a serious cautionary note

1:27:45.260 --> 1:27:48.600
 that amphetamine and cocaine not only can cause a drop

1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:49.620
 in baseline dopamine,

1:27:49.620 --> 1:27:51.940
 but can actually put the brain into a state

1:27:51.940 --> 1:27:55.280
 in which it cannot learn and modify itself to get better,

1:27:55.280 --> 1:27:57.300
 at least for some period of time.

1:27:57.300 --> 1:28:00.220
 In a previous episode on ADHD,

1:28:00.220 --> 1:28:02.740
 I talked about the widespread use of drugs

1:28:02.740 --> 1:28:05.340
 like Adderall, Ritalin, modafinil, and armodafinil,

1:28:05.340 --> 1:28:07.860
 all of which lead to very large increases in dopamine

1:28:07.860 --> 1:28:12.700
 and for people with ADHD can really improve their symptoms.

1:28:12.700 --> 1:28:15.300
 But of course, there's a lot of non-prescription,

1:28:15.300 --> 1:28:17.980
 non-clinical use of those compounds as well.

1:28:17.980 --> 1:28:21.220
 And it stands to reason that the use of those substances

1:28:21.220 --> 1:28:24.980
 to increase dopamine could very well provide

1:28:24.980 --> 1:28:27.140
 the same sort of blockade of neuroplasticity

1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:28.620
 that cocaine and amphetamine do,

1:28:28.620 --> 1:28:31.960
 because when you look at the amount of dopamine increase

1:28:31.960 --> 1:28:35.320
 that's triggered by those compounds, it's really comparable.

1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:39.580
 So again, a cautionary note against spiking one's dopamine

1:28:39.580 --> 1:28:41.540
 too much on a regular basis,

1:28:41.540 --> 1:28:45.500
 unless there's a valid clinical need for doing that.

1:28:45.500 --> 1:28:48.140
 So we've been focusing a lot for the last few minutes

1:28:48.140 --> 1:28:50.860
 on the kind of darker side of dopamine

1:28:50.860 --> 1:28:54.540
 and how getting big peaks in dopamine can be detrimental.

1:28:54.540 --> 1:28:56.460
 But I want to acknowledge the truth,

1:28:56.460 --> 1:28:59.060
 which is that dopamine feels great.

1:28:59.060 --> 1:29:01.820
 Being in pursuit and motivated and craving things

1:29:01.820 --> 1:29:05.400
 feels wonderful, and I don't want to demonize dopamine.

1:29:05.400 --> 1:29:07.440
 What I'm trying to do today is to illustrate

1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:10.820
 how dopamine works in your brain so that you can continue

1:29:10.820 --> 1:29:15.780
 to engage in dopamine evoking activities.

1:29:15.780 --> 1:29:18.500
 And certainly there is a place for ingesting things

1:29:18.500 --> 1:29:21.060
 that can increase dopamine provided that they are safe

1:29:21.060 --> 1:29:23.680
 for us in the short and long-term.

1:29:25.280 --> 1:29:28.900
 There are activities that we can do that will give us

1:29:28.900 --> 1:29:33.220
 healthy sustained increases in dopamine, both the peaks

1:29:33.220 --> 1:29:36.220
 when they happen and to maintain or even increase

1:29:36.220 --> 1:29:37.720
 our baseline levels of dopamine.

1:29:37.720 --> 1:29:39.100
 So how do we do that?

1:29:39.100 --> 1:29:40.980
 What are some of these activities?

1:29:40.980 --> 1:29:44.360
 Well, in recent years, there's been a trend

1:29:44.360 --> 1:29:47.620
 toward more people doing so-called cold exposure.

1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:51.120
 In part, this was popularized by Wim Hof,

1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:53.980
 the so-called Iceman, getting into cold showers,

1:29:53.980 --> 1:29:57.360
 taking ice baths, exposing oneself to cold water

1:29:57.360 --> 1:30:00.980
 of various kinds can in fact increase our levels

1:30:00.980 --> 1:30:03.100
 of dopamine, as well as the neuromodulator,

1:30:03.100 --> 1:30:04.300
 neuroepinephrine.

1:30:05.500 --> 1:30:07.080
 This is not a new phenomenon.

1:30:08.460 --> 1:30:12.060
 In the 1920s, a guy by the name of Vincent Priznitz

1:30:12.060 --> 1:30:14.580
 was one of the first people to popularize

1:30:14.580 --> 1:30:17.300
 and formalize cold water therapies.

1:30:17.300 --> 1:30:20.620
 He was an advocate of cold water exposure

1:30:20.620 --> 1:30:22.880
 in order to boost the immune system

1:30:22.880 --> 1:30:24.560
 and increase feelings of wellbeing.

1:30:24.560 --> 1:30:27.420
 And actually this practice dates back long before

1:30:27.420 --> 1:30:30.100
 Vincent's popularized it.

1:30:30.100 --> 1:30:33.300
 And Wim Hof is the more recent iteration of this.

1:30:33.300 --> 1:30:35.220
 First of all, some of the safety parameters.

1:30:35.220 --> 1:30:36.600
 Let's establish those first.

1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:39.820
 Getting into very, very cold water, 30 degree Fahrenheit

1:30:39.820 --> 1:30:43.220
 or even low 40 degree Fahrenheit can put somebody

1:30:43.220 --> 1:30:44.640
 into a state of cold water shock.

1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:46.460
 I mean, people can die doing that.

1:30:46.460 --> 1:30:49.560
 So obviously you want to approach this with some caution,

1:30:49.560 --> 1:30:52.940
 but for most people getting into 60 degree water

1:30:52.940 --> 1:30:55.680
 or 50 degree water, or if you're acclimated

1:30:55.680 --> 1:30:57.780
 and comfortable with it, you know,

1:30:57.780 --> 1:31:00.020
 40 degree water or 45 degree water

1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:03.300
 can have tremendously beneficial results

1:31:03.300 --> 1:31:06.300
 on your neuromodulator systems, including dopamine.

1:31:07.620 --> 1:31:10.700
 What temperature of water you can tolerate will depend

1:31:10.700 --> 1:31:14.400
 on how cold water adapted you are and how familiar you are

1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:16.940
 with the experience of getting into cold water.

1:31:16.940 --> 1:31:19.840
 And when I say comfortable with, I should mention,

1:31:19.840 --> 1:31:23.140
 there is never a case in which getting into cold water

1:31:24.020 --> 1:31:27.620
 does not evoke a release of epinephrine.

1:31:27.620 --> 1:31:29.820
 So the quickening of the breath, the widening of the eyes,

1:31:29.820 --> 1:31:32.900
 the feeling as if you can't catch your breath

1:31:32.900 --> 1:31:35.420
 and even some physical pain at the level of the skin,

1:31:35.420 --> 1:31:37.940
 that happens almost every time or every time

1:31:37.940 --> 1:31:39.360
 that you get into cold water,

1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:41.140
 even if you're cold water adapted.

1:31:41.140 --> 1:31:44.460
 What almost everybody knows and understands is that

1:31:44.460 --> 1:31:47.020
 that wall, as I like to refer to it, is coming.

1:31:47.020 --> 1:31:48.780
 That's always the first experience

1:31:48.780 --> 1:31:50.060
 of getting into cold water.

1:31:50.060 --> 1:31:52.420
 There's no real way around that.

1:31:52.420 --> 1:31:55.340
 Now, the study that I mentioned earlier,

1:31:55.340 --> 1:31:57.580
 human physiological responses to immersion

1:31:57.580 --> 1:31:59.200
 into water of different temperatures,

1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:01.540
 really interesting study that was done

1:32:01.540 --> 1:32:03.980
 and published in the University of, excuse me,

1:32:03.980 --> 1:32:06.180
 the European Journal of Applied Physiology.

1:32:06.180 --> 1:32:09.700
 I can provide a link to that study in the show caption.

1:32:09.700 --> 1:32:10.980
 It's a really interesting study.

1:32:10.980 --> 1:32:14.460
 They looked at people getting exposed to water

1:32:14.460 --> 1:32:16.780
 that was warm, moderately cold or very cold.

1:32:16.780 --> 1:32:19.020
 It was 32 degrees Celsius, 20 degrees Celsius

1:32:19.020 --> 1:32:21.100
 or 14 degrees Celsius.

1:32:21.100 --> 1:32:23.380
 You can just put those online and do the conversion

1:32:23.380 --> 1:32:25.740
 or you can do the conversion to Fahrenheit if you like.

1:32:25.740 --> 1:32:29.820
 But in any case, what they looked at were the concentrations

1:32:29.820 --> 1:32:34.120
 of things like epinephrine and dopamine and so on.

1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:36.340
 And what they found was really interesting.

1:32:36.340 --> 1:32:41.340
 First of all, upon getting into cold water,

1:32:41.340 --> 1:32:46.340
 the changes in adrenaline and noradrenaline,

1:32:46.580 --> 1:32:49.740
 epinephrine and norepinephrine were immediate and fast

1:32:49.740 --> 1:32:52.020
 and these were huge increases.

1:32:52.020 --> 1:32:53.820
 So that's the getting into the cold water

1:32:53.820 --> 1:32:55.160
 that everybody experiences,

1:32:55.160 --> 1:32:57.300
 these huge increases in adrenaline.

1:32:57.300 --> 1:32:59.500
 But then what was interesting is they observed

1:32:59.500 --> 1:33:03.180
 that dopamine levels started to rise somewhat slowly

1:33:03.180 --> 1:33:06.460
 and then continue to rise and reach levels

1:33:06.460 --> 1:33:10.740
 as high as 2.5 times above baseline.

1:33:10.740 --> 1:33:12.760
 That's a remarkably high increase.

1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:17.760
 Remember, if we go back to our examples of chocolate, sex,

1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:20.180
 a doubling above baseline, nicotine,

1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:23.000
 2.5 times above baseline, cocaine,

1:33:23.000 --> 1:33:27.060
 the increase in dopamine from a cold water exposure

1:33:27.060 --> 1:33:31.080
 of this kind was comparable to what one sees from cocaine,

1:33:31.080 --> 1:33:36.080
 except in this case, it wasn't a rise and crash.

1:33:36.580 --> 1:33:40.000
 It was actually a sustained rise in dopamine

1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:41.620
 that took a very long time,

1:33:41.620 --> 1:33:44.280
 up to three hours to come back down to baseline,

1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:46.060
 which is really remarkable.

1:33:46.060 --> 1:33:50.100
 And I think this explains some of the positive mental

1:33:50.100 --> 1:33:53.260
 and physical effects that people report subjectively

1:33:53.260 --> 1:33:55.320
 after doing cold water exposure.

1:33:55.320 --> 1:33:57.500
 One question that many of you are probably asking is

1:33:57.500 --> 1:33:59.940
 just how cold should the water be?

1:33:59.940 --> 1:34:01.660
 Well, you could mimic what was done in this study

1:34:01.660 --> 1:34:03.220
 and do 14 degrees Celsius,

1:34:03.220 --> 1:34:05.280
 but for some people that won't be cold enough

1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:07.580
 or some people that will be too cold,

1:34:07.580 --> 1:34:10.060
 they did look at the release of stress hormones

1:34:10.060 --> 1:34:11.820
 like cortisol in addition to the release

1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:13.940
 of things like epinephrine and adrenaline.

1:34:13.940 --> 1:34:17.280
 And it's interesting that they noted that in all cases,

1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:19.180
 but especially at that coldest temperature,

1:34:19.180 --> 1:34:20.660
 there was an increase in cortisol,

1:34:20.660 --> 1:34:24.080
 but that it was transient that eventually people's cortisol,

1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:26.780
 the stress hormone subsided a bit.

1:34:26.780 --> 1:34:28.740
 There are basically two different approaches

1:34:28.740 --> 1:34:31.700
 to remaining in the cold when it's uncomfortable.

1:34:31.700 --> 1:34:34.200
 One is to try and relax yourself,

1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:36.780
 to try and practice slow breathing,

1:34:36.780 --> 1:34:38.220
 to try and dilate your gaze.

1:34:38.220 --> 1:34:40.060
 I've talked about this before in previous podcasts,

1:34:40.060 --> 1:34:41.180
 to go into panoramic vision,

1:34:41.180 --> 1:34:42.980
 to essentially try and calm yourself

1:34:42.980 --> 1:34:46.660
 so that it's not as stressful in the cold.

1:34:46.660 --> 1:34:48.660
 Other people, however,

1:34:48.660 --> 1:34:51.540
 take the approach of trying to ramp up their level

1:34:51.540 --> 1:34:53.780
 of internal autonomic arousal,

1:34:53.780 --> 1:34:55.700
 meaning to get really energized

1:34:55.700 --> 1:34:58.300
 and kind of lean into the friction of the cold

1:34:58.300 --> 1:34:59.740
 and they find that easier.

1:34:59.740 --> 1:35:01.180
 Other people distract themselves.

1:35:01.180 --> 1:35:04.100
 They recite the alphabet or they do something,

1:35:04.100 --> 1:35:06.100
 anything to try and distract themselves

1:35:06.100 --> 1:35:08.060
 from the discomfort.

1:35:08.060 --> 1:35:09.060
 To be totally honest,

1:35:09.060 --> 1:35:12.020
 it does not matter for sake of dopamine release

1:35:12.020 --> 1:35:14.060
 because the dopamine release is triggered

1:35:14.060 --> 1:35:17.900
 and then continues even after you get out of the cold water.

1:35:17.900 --> 1:35:22.380
 Now, in this study, it was long exposure to cold water.

1:35:22.380 --> 1:35:23.960
 It was an hour.

1:35:23.960 --> 1:35:25.580
 That's a long period of time.

1:35:25.580 --> 1:35:29.180
 And I do warn you against getting into cold water

1:35:29.180 --> 1:35:32.160
 that's so cold that it will make your temperature drop

1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:33.800
 and make you hyperthermic for an hour.

1:35:33.800 --> 1:35:35.500
 That actually could be dangerous for a lot of people.

1:35:35.500 --> 1:35:36.960
 You might have a hard time reheating

1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:39.540
 and hypothermia is not a good thing.

1:35:39.540 --> 1:35:42.980
 They had people monitoring subjects in these studies

1:35:42.980 --> 1:35:45.220
 and paying attention to their core body temperature.

1:35:45.220 --> 1:35:47.820
 They were able to reheat them afterwards.

1:35:47.820 --> 1:35:51.220
 It's well-established now that getting into cold water,

1:35:51.220 --> 1:35:52.900
 whether or not it's a shower, an ice bath,

1:35:52.900 --> 1:35:55.220
 circulating cold water, a stream, et cetera,

1:35:56.460 --> 1:35:59.380
 that can evoke the norepinephrine release immediately

1:35:59.380 --> 1:36:01.580
 and the long arc of that dopamine release.

1:36:01.580 --> 1:36:02.680
 Why would that be good?

1:36:02.680 --> 1:36:04.780
 Up until now, I've basically said

1:36:04.780 --> 1:36:06.940
 getting increases in dopamine

1:36:06.940 --> 1:36:09.340
 are detrimental to your baseline.

1:36:09.340 --> 1:36:12.380
 Well, this does appear to raise the baseline of dopamine

1:36:12.380 --> 1:36:13.940
 for substantial periods of time.

1:36:13.940 --> 1:36:18.060
 And most people report feeling a heightened level

1:36:18.060 --> 1:36:22.060
 of calm and focus after getting out of cold water.

1:36:22.060 --> 1:36:23.680
 So cold water exposure turns out to be

1:36:23.680 --> 1:36:27.340
 a very potent stimulus for shifting the entire milieu,

1:36:27.340 --> 1:36:30.520
 the entire environment of our brain and body

1:36:30.520 --> 1:36:34.980
 and allowing many people to feel much, much better

1:36:34.980 --> 1:36:36.740
 for a substantial period of time

1:36:36.740 --> 1:36:38.680
 after getting out of the ice bath

1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:42.140
 or cold water of any kind than they did before.

1:36:42.140 --> 1:36:44.340
 Now you might ask how often to do this.

1:36:44.340 --> 1:36:45.980
 Some people do this every day.

1:36:45.980 --> 1:36:47.260
 It can be very stimulating.

1:36:47.260 --> 1:36:49.980
 So typically doing it early in the day,

1:36:49.980 --> 1:36:50.800
 it's going to be better.

1:36:50.800 --> 1:36:53.700
 I don't necessarily recommend doing it right before sleep,

1:36:53.700 --> 1:36:55.580
 but some people do it in the afternoon.

1:36:55.580 --> 1:36:58.500
 And some people will indeed do that seven days a week,

1:36:58.500 --> 1:36:59.660
 other people, three days a week,

1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:01.220
 other people every once in a while.

1:37:01.220 --> 1:37:05.300
 What I can say is once you become cold water adapted,

1:37:05.300 --> 1:37:09.120
 once it no longer has the same impact of novelty

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:10.900
 and feeling a bit like a,

1:37:10.900 --> 1:37:12.220
 I don't want to say a shock to your system

1:37:12.220 --> 1:37:13.740
 because you don't want to go into cold water shock,

1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:17.960
 but once it is comfortable for you,

1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:20.220
 then it will no longer evoke this release.

1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:22.340
 There really does seem to be something in the pathway

1:37:22.340 --> 1:37:25.460
 from cold water exposure through the norepinephrine pathway

1:37:25.460 --> 1:37:27.240
 and into the mesolimic brainstem

1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:29.340
 that causes this release in dopamine.

1:37:29.340 --> 1:37:32.560
 But nonetheless, it's a basically zero cost.

1:37:32.560 --> 1:37:34.380
 I mean, you need access to water of some sort,

1:37:34.380 --> 1:37:35.580
 cold water, shower, et cetera,

1:37:35.580 --> 1:37:38.160
 but basically zero cost way of triggering

1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:39.860
 a long lasting increase in dopamine

1:37:39.860 --> 1:37:42.780
 without ingesting anything, no pharmacology whatsoever.

1:37:42.780 --> 1:37:46.000
 Please again, approach it with safety and caution in mind,

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.920
 but it is a very potent stimulus.

1:37:47.920 --> 1:37:51.740
 Again, 250% of a rise in baseline,

1:37:51.740 --> 1:37:55.120
 two and a half times rise in baseline rivals that of cocaine,

1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:56.760
 which is really remarkable.

1:37:56.760 --> 1:37:59.580
 Now I'd like to talk about the positive aspects of rewards

1:37:59.580 --> 1:38:00.420
 for our behavior

1:38:00.420 --> 1:38:03.020
 and the negative aspects of rewards for our behavior.

1:38:03.020 --> 1:38:06.060
 And from that, I will suggest a protocol

1:38:06.060 --> 1:38:09.180
 by which you can achieve a better relationship

1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:12.060
 to your activities and to your dopamine system.

1:38:12.060 --> 1:38:14.500
 In fact, it will help tune up your dopamine system

1:38:14.500 --> 1:38:18.240
 for discipline, hard work, and motivation.

1:38:20.380 --> 1:38:22.580
 Hard work is hard.

1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:26.000
 Generally, most people don't like working hard.

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.020
 Some people do,

1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:31.380
 but most people work hard in order to achieve some end goal.

1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:34.900
 End goals are terrific and rewards are terrific,

1:38:34.900 --> 1:38:38.800
 whether or not they are monetary, social, or any kind.

1:38:39.860 --> 1:38:43.460
 However, because of the way that dopamine

1:38:43.460 --> 1:38:45.480
 relates to our perception of time,

1:38:46.820 --> 1:38:49.060
 working hard at something

1:38:49.060 --> 1:38:52.300
 for sake of a reward that comes afterward

1:38:52.300 --> 1:38:55.700
 can make the hard work much more challenging

1:38:55.700 --> 1:38:58.840
 and make us much less likely to lean into hard work

1:38:58.840 --> 1:38:59.820
 in the future.

1:38:59.820 --> 1:39:01.600
 Let me give you a couple examples

1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:03.820
 by way of data and experiments.

1:39:03.820 --> 1:39:07.620
 There's a classic experiment done actually at Stanford

1:39:07.620 --> 1:39:11.980
 many years ago in which children in nursery school

1:39:11.980 --> 1:39:14.840
 and kindergarten drew pictures.

1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:17.680
 And they drew pictures because they liked to draw.

1:39:17.680 --> 1:39:20.660
 The researchers took kids that liked to draw

1:39:20.660 --> 1:39:23.540
 and they started giving them a reward for drawing.

1:39:23.540 --> 1:39:26.560
 The reward generally was a gold star or some thing

1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:28.940
 that a young child would find rewarding.

1:39:30.200 --> 1:39:33.480
 Then they stopped giving them the gold star.

1:39:33.480 --> 1:39:36.100
 And what they found is the children had

1:39:36.100 --> 1:39:41.100
 a much lower tendency to draw on their own, no reward.

1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:44.300
 Now, remember this was an activity

1:39:44.300 --> 1:39:46.460
 that prior to receiving a reward,

1:39:46.460 --> 1:39:50.400
 the children intrinsically enjoyed and selected to do.

1:39:50.400 --> 1:39:52.800
 No one was telling them to draw.

1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:54.520
 What this relates to is so-called intrinsic

1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:57.260
 versus extrinsic reinforcement.

1:39:57.260 --> 1:39:58.800
 When we receive rewards,

1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:01.980
 even if we give ourselves rewards for something,

1:40:01.980 --> 1:40:04.060
 we tend to associate less pleasure

1:40:04.060 --> 1:40:07.940
 with the actual activity itself that evoked the reward.

1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:09.420
 Now that might seem counterintuitive,

1:40:09.420 --> 1:40:10.660
 but that's just the way

1:40:10.660 --> 1:40:13.240
 that these dopaminergic circuits work.

1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:15.620
 And now understanding these peaks and baselines

1:40:15.620 --> 1:40:18.620
 and dopamine, which I won't review again,

1:40:18.620 --> 1:40:20.300
 this should make sense.

1:40:20.300 --> 1:40:24.260
 If you get a peak in dopamine from a reward,

1:40:24.260 --> 1:40:25.740
 it's going to lower your baseline.

1:40:25.740 --> 1:40:30.460
 And the cognitive interpretation is that you didn't really

1:40:30.460 --> 1:40:32.760
 do the activity because you enjoyed the activity.

1:40:32.760 --> 1:40:34.420
 You did it for the reward.

1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:37.320
 Now, this doesn't mean all rewards of all kinds are bad,

1:40:37.320 --> 1:40:39.740
 but it's also important to understand

1:40:39.740 --> 1:40:42.780
 that dopamine controls our perception of time.

1:40:42.780 --> 1:40:46.900
 When and how much dopamine we experience is the way

1:40:46.900 --> 1:40:50.540
 that we carve up what we call our experience of time.

1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:52.140
 When we engage in an activity,

1:40:52.140 --> 1:40:56.960
 let's say school or hard work of any kind or exercise,

1:40:56.960 --> 1:40:59.420
 because of the reward we are going to give ourselves

1:40:59.420 --> 1:41:03.860
 or receive at the end, the trophy, the Sunday, the meal,

1:41:03.860 --> 1:41:05.320
 whatever it happens to be,

1:41:06.860 --> 1:41:10.500
 we actually are extending the time bin

1:41:10.500 --> 1:41:15.500
 over which we are analyzing or perceiving that experience.

1:41:15.500 --> 1:41:19.360
 And because the reward comes at the end,

1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:22.820
 we start to dissociate the neural circuits

1:41:22.820 --> 1:41:26.340
 for dopamine and reward that would have normally been active

1:41:26.340 --> 1:41:28.580
 during the activity.

1:41:28.580 --> 1:41:32.880
 And because it all arrives at the end over time,

1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:35.820
 we have the experience of less and less pleasure

1:41:35.820 --> 1:41:39.180
 from that particular activity while we're doing it.

1:41:39.180 --> 1:41:43.100
 Now, this is the antithesis of growth mindset.

1:41:43.100 --> 1:41:45.780
 My colleague at Stanford, Carol Dweck, as many of you know,

1:41:45.780 --> 1:41:49.040
 has come up with this incredible theory and principle,

1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:50.900
 and it actually goes beyond theory and principle

1:41:50.900 --> 1:41:51.980
 called growth mindset,

1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:54.140
 which is this striving to be better,

1:41:54.140 --> 1:41:56.740
 to be in this mindset of I'm not there yet,

1:41:56.740 --> 1:42:00.900
 but striving itself is the end goal.

1:42:00.900 --> 1:42:03.220
 And that of course delivers you to tremendous performance

1:42:03.220 --> 1:42:05.160
 has been observed over and over and over again,

1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:06.580
 that people that have growth mindset,

1:42:06.580 --> 1:42:09.420
 kids that have growth mindset end up performing very well

1:42:09.420 --> 1:42:11.660
 because they're focused on the effort itself.

1:42:11.660 --> 1:42:15.540
 And all of us can cultivate growth mindset.

1:42:15.540 --> 1:42:18.140
 The neural mechanism of cultivating growth mindset

1:42:18.140 --> 1:42:21.620
 involves learning to access the rewards

1:42:21.620 --> 1:42:26.220
 from effort and doing, and that's hard to do

1:42:26.220 --> 1:42:29.260
 because you have to engage this prefrontal component

1:42:29.260 --> 1:42:30.380
 of the mesolimbic circuit.

1:42:30.380 --> 1:42:33.660
 You have to tell yourself, okay, this effort is great.

1:42:33.660 --> 1:42:35.180
 This effort is pleasureful,

1:42:35.180 --> 1:42:37.180
 even though you might actually be in a state of physical

1:42:37.180 --> 1:42:40.100
 pain from the exercise, or I can recall this from college,

1:42:40.100 --> 1:42:42.240
 just feeling like I wanted to get up from my desk,

1:42:42.240 --> 1:42:43.660
 but forcing myself to study,

1:42:43.660 --> 1:42:45.140
 forcing myself and forcing myself.

1:42:45.140 --> 1:42:48.420
 What you find over time is that you can start to associate

1:42:48.420 --> 1:42:49.360
 a dopamine release.

1:42:49.360 --> 1:42:53.020
 You can evoke dopamine release from the friction

1:42:53.020 --> 1:42:55.820
 and the challenge that you happen to be in.

1:42:55.820 --> 1:42:59.580
 You completely eliminate the ability to generate

1:42:59.580 --> 1:43:02.340
 those circuits and the rewarding process

1:43:02.340 --> 1:43:06.040
 of being able to reward friction while in effort,

1:43:06.040 --> 1:43:09.540
 if you are focused only on the goal that comes at the end,

1:43:09.540 --> 1:43:12.500
 because of the way that dopamine marks time.

1:43:12.500 --> 1:43:15.440
 So if you say, oh, I'm going to do this very hard thing

1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:17.340
 and I'm going to push and push and push and push

1:43:17.340 --> 1:43:20.260
 for that end goal that comes later,

1:43:20.260 --> 1:43:24.980
 not only do you enjoy the process of what you're doing less,

1:43:24.980 --> 1:43:27.060
 you actually make it more painful

1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:28.520
 while you're engaging in it.

1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:30.260
 You make yourself less efficient at it

1:43:30.260 --> 1:43:33.500
 because if you were able to access dopamine while in effort,

1:43:33.500 --> 1:43:36.160
 dopamine has all these incredible properties of increasing

1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:38.780
 the amount of energy in our body and in our mind,

1:43:38.780 --> 1:43:41.540
 our ability to focus by way of dopamine's conversion

1:43:41.540 --> 1:43:46.160
 into epinephrine, but also you are undermining your ability

1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:48.540
 to lean back into that activity the next time.

1:43:48.540 --> 1:43:51.500
 The next time you need twice as much coffee

1:43:51.500 --> 1:43:53.660
 and three times as much loud music

1:43:53.660 --> 1:43:55.700
 and four times as much energy drink

1:43:55.700 --> 1:43:58.380
 and the social connection just to get out the door

1:43:58.380 --> 1:44:00.740
 in order to do the run or to study.

1:44:00.740 --> 1:44:04.260
 So what's more beneficial, in fact,

1:44:04.260 --> 1:44:06.420
 can serve as a tremendous amplifier

1:44:06.420 --> 1:44:09.360
 on all endeavors that you engage in,

1:44:09.360 --> 1:44:12.740
 especially hard endeavors is to A,

1:44:12.740 --> 1:44:15.660
 not start layering in other sources of dopamine

1:44:15.660 --> 1:44:17.500
 in order to get to the starting line,

1:44:17.500 --> 1:44:19.960
 not layering in other sources of dopamine

1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:21.220
 in order to be able to continue,

1:44:21.220 --> 1:44:25.260
 but rather to subjectively start to attach the feeling

1:44:25.260 --> 1:44:29.440
 of friction and effort to an internally generated

1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:32.380
 reward system and this is not meant to be vague.

1:44:32.380 --> 1:44:35.140
 This is a system that exists in your mind

1:44:35.140 --> 1:44:37.000
 that exists in the minds of humans

1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:38.900
 for hundreds of thousands of years

1:44:38.900 --> 1:44:41.740
 by which you're not just pursuing the things

1:44:41.740 --> 1:44:46.060
 that are innately pleasureful, food, sex, warmth,

1:44:46.060 --> 1:44:47.860
 water when you're thirsty,

1:44:47.860 --> 1:44:51.180
 but the beauty of this mesolimbic reward pathway

1:44:51.180 --> 1:44:52.820
 that I talked about earlier

1:44:52.820 --> 1:44:54.380
 is that it includes the forebrain.

1:44:54.380 --> 1:44:59.240
 So you can tell yourself the effort part is the good part.

1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:00.080
 I know it's painful.

1:45:00.080 --> 1:45:02.400
 I know this doesn't feel good, but I'm focused on this.

1:45:02.400 --> 1:45:04.960
 I'm going to start to access the reward.

1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:07.380
 You will find the rewards,

1:45:07.380 --> 1:45:10.060
 meaning the dopamine release inside of effort.

1:45:10.060 --> 1:45:12.040
 If you repeat this over and over again,

1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:14.300
 and what's beautiful about it is that it starts

1:45:14.300 --> 1:45:17.420
 to become reflexive for all types of effort.

1:45:17.420 --> 1:45:20.280
 When we focus only on the trophy, only on the grade,

1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:22.960
 only on the win as the reward,

1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:25.520
 you undermine that entire process.

1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:27.400
 So how do you do this?

1:45:27.400 --> 1:45:31.420
 You do this in those moments of the most intense friction,

1:45:31.420 --> 1:45:34.780
 you tell yourself this is very painful

1:45:34.780 --> 1:45:36.900
 and because it's painful,

1:45:36.900 --> 1:45:40.580
 it will evoke an increase in dopamine release later,

1:45:40.580 --> 1:45:43.900
 meaning it will increase my baseline in dopamine.

1:45:43.900 --> 1:45:48.640
 But you also have to tell yourself that in that moment,

1:45:48.640 --> 1:45:50.460
 you are doing it by choice

1:45:50.460 --> 1:45:53.640
 and you're doing it because you love it.

1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:56.100
 And I know that sounds like lying to yourself.

1:45:56.100 --> 1:45:58.380
 And in some ways it is lying to yourself,

1:45:58.380 --> 1:46:01.260
 but it's lying to yourself in the context of a truth,

1:46:01.260 --> 1:46:05.020
 which is that you want it to feel better.

1:46:05.020 --> 1:46:07.780
 You want it to feel even pleasureful.

1:46:07.780 --> 1:46:10.820
 Now, this is very far and away different

1:46:10.820 --> 1:46:14.300
 from thinking about the reward that comes at the end,

1:46:14.300 --> 1:46:17.020
 the hot fudge Sunday after you cross the finish line,

1:46:17.020 --> 1:46:18.340
 and you can replace hot fudge Sunday

1:46:18.340 --> 1:46:21.980
 with whatever reward happens to be appealing to you.

1:46:21.980 --> 1:46:23.660
 We revere people who are capable

1:46:23.660 --> 1:46:25.800
 of doing what I'm describing.

1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:28.060
 David Goggins comes to mind as a really good example.

1:46:28.060 --> 1:46:30.140
 Many of you are probably familiar with David Goggins,

1:46:30.140 --> 1:46:31.460
 former Navy SEAL,

1:46:31.460 --> 1:46:36.060
 who essentially has made a post-military career

1:46:36.060 --> 1:46:39.820
 out of explaining and sharing his process

1:46:39.820 --> 1:46:42.640
 of turning the effort into the reward.

1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:45.340
 There are many other examples of this too, of course.

1:46:46.820 --> 1:46:48.720
 Throughout evolutionary history,

1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:50.580
 there's no question that we revered people

1:46:50.580 --> 1:46:53.940
 who were willing to go out and forage and hunt and gather

1:46:53.940 --> 1:46:58.580
 and caretake in ways that other members of our species

1:46:58.580 --> 1:47:01.780
 probably found exhausting and probably would have preferred

1:47:01.780 --> 1:47:04.020
 to just put their feet up or soak them in a cool stream

1:47:04.020 --> 1:47:06.060
 rather than continue to forage.

1:47:06.060 --> 1:47:09.740
 The ability to access this pleasure from effort

1:47:10.860 --> 1:47:14.980
 aspect of our dopaminergic circuitry is without question

1:47:14.980 --> 1:47:17.580
 the most powerful aspect of dopamine

1:47:17.580 --> 1:47:19.500
 and our biology of dopamine.

1:47:19.500 --> 1:47:23.020
 And the beautiful thing is it's accessible to all of us,

1:47:23.020 --> 1:47:25.940
 but just to highlight the things that can interfere with

1:47:25.940 --> 1:47:29.940
 and prevent you from getting dopamine release

1:47:29.940 --> 1:47:32.180
 from effort itself.

1:47:32.180 --> 1:47:35.020
 Don't spike dopamine prior to engaging in effort

1:47:35.980 --> 1:47:39.460
 and don't spike dopamine after engaging in effort.

1:47:39.460 --> 1:47:43.020
 Learn to spike your dopamine from effort itself.

1:47:43.020 --> 1:47:47.500
 One straightforward example of learning to attach dopamine

1:47:47.500 --> 1:47:52.500
 to effort and strain as opposed to a process or a reward

1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:55.300
 that naturally evokes dopamine release

1:47:55.300 --> 1:47:57.140
 is so-called intermittent fasting.

1:47:57.140 --> 1:47:59.540
 I know this is very popular nowadays.

1:47:59.540 --> 1:48:01.180
 Some people like to do intermittent fasting,

1:48:01.180 --> 1:48:02.340
 some people don't.

1:48:02.340 --> 1:48:05.220
 Some people have a 12 hour feeding window every 24 hours.

1:48:05.220 --> 1:48:08.300
 Some people do long fasts of two to three days even.

1:48:08.300 --> 1:48:11.580
 I personally don't monitor a feeding window

1:48:11.580 --> 1:48:12.700
 with a lot of precision.

1:48:12.700 --> 1:48:15.420
 I tend to skip one meal a day, either breakfast or lunch,

1:48:15.420 --> 1:48:16.860
 and then I eat the other two meals of the day,

1:48:16.860 --> 1:48:18.140
 depending on which meal I skip.

1:48:18.140 --> 1:48:19.780
 So it's either breakfast, lunch,

1:48:19.780 --> 1:48:22.320
 and maybe a little something in the evening,

1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:25.740
 or I'll skip breakfast and do lunch and dinner and so on.

1:48:25.740 --> 1:48:28.800
 Many people are now eating this way in part

1:48:28.800 --> 1:48:32.940
 because many people find it easier to not eat at all

1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:36.020
 than to eat a smaller portion of some food.

1:48:36.020 --> 1:48:37.460
 And that has everything to do

1:48:37.460 --> 1:48:42.040
 with the dopamine reward evoking properties of food.

1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:45.980
 When we ingest food or when we are about to ingest food,

1:48:45.980 --> 1:48:47.200
 our dopamine levels go up.

1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:49.340
 And typically when we ingest food,

1:48:49.340 --> 1:48:51.020
 if it evokes some dopamine release,

1:48:51.020 --> 1:48:52.680
 then we tend to want even more food.

1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:54.700
 Remember dopamine's main role

1:48:54.700 --> 1:48:56.780
 is one of motivation and seeking.

1:48:56.780 --> 1:48:59.960
 And what dopamine always wants more of is more dopamine,

1:49:01.020 --> 1:49:05.180
 more activity or thing that evokes more dopamine release.

1:49:05.180 --> 1:49:07.940
 Well, let's just look at fasting

1:49:07.940 --> 1:49:10.860
 from the perspective of dopamine schedules

1:49:10.860 --> 1:49:13.180
 and dopamine release and peaks and baselines.

1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:18.820
 Typically when we eat, we get dopamine release,

1:49:18.820 --> 1:49:21.540
 especially when we eat after being very hungry.

1:49:21.540 --> 1:49:24.180
 If you've ever gone camping or you're very, very hungry,

1:49:24.180 --> 1:49:26.060
 the food tastes that much better.

1:49:26.060 --> 1:49:28.080
 And that's actually because of the way

1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:31.460
 that deprivation states increase

1:49:31.460 --> 1:49:35.060
 the way that dopaminergic circuits work.

1:49:35.060 --> 1:49:38.540
 Our perception of dopamine is heightened

1:49:38.540 --> 1:49:40.320
 when the receptors for dopamine

1:49:40.320 --> 1:49:42.420
 have not seen much dopamine lately.

1:49:42.420 --> 1:49:43.860
 They haven't bound much dopamine.

1:49:43.860 --> 1:49:45.740
 So when you fast, fast, fast, fast, fast,

1:49:45.740 --> 1:49:49.660
 and then you finally eat, it evokes more dopamine release.

1:49:49.660 --> 1:49:52.860
 So this is the big reward that comes at the end.

1:49:52.860 --> 1:49:56.220
 Even bigger because you deprived yourself.

1:49:56.220 --> 1:49:58.420
 This is true for all rewarding behaviors

1:49:58.420 --> 1:50:00.200
 and activities by the way.

1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:02.940
 The longer you restrict yourself from that activity,

1:50:02.940 --> 1:50:05.300
 the greater the dopamine experience

1:50:05.300 --> 1:50:06.820
 when the dopamine is finally released

1:50:06.820 --> 1:50:09.680
 because of an upregulation of the receptors for dopamine.

1:50:10.820 --> 1:50:13.000
 But I just spent five minutes or more

1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:16.420
 telling you that you should avoid too much reward at the end

1:50:16.420 --> 1:50:20.020
 and you should actually focus on the dopamine

1:50:20.020 --> 1:50:22.660
 that you can consciously evoke

1:50:22.660 --> 1:50:24.860
 from the deprivation strain and effort.

1:50:24.860 --> 1:50:28.060
 And in fact, this is what happens for many people

1:50:28.060 --> 1:50:31.140
 that start doing fasting and take a liking to it.

1:50:31.140 --> 1:50:33.980
 Many people say that their state of mind

1:50:33.980 --> 1:50:35.880
 when they fast is clear,

1:50:35.880 --> 1:50:39.060
 that they actually start to enjoy the period of fasting.

1:50:39.060 --> 1:50:41.820
 In fact, some people start pushing out their eating window

1:50:41.820 --> 1:50:44.220
 or skipping entire days of eating more and more

1:50:44.220 --> 1:50:47.900
 in order to get deeper into that state of mind

1:50:47.900 --> 1:50:50.420
 where surely it's not just dopamine,

1:50:50.420 --> 1:50:51.900
 but dopamine is released.

1:50:51.900 --> 1:50:53.340
 They will track their clock.

1:50:53.340 --> 1:50:56.020
 Oh, I've been fasting 12 hours, 16 hours, et cetera.

1:50:56.020 --> 1:50:58.420
 They are starting to attach dopamine release

1:50:58.420 --> 1:51:01.440
 or create dopamine release from the deprivation,

1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:03.740
 not from the food reward itself.

1:51:03.740 --> 1:51:06.240
 And this, I think, makes it an interesting practice

1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:10.220
 and one that certainly has been practiced for centuries

1:51:10.220 --> 1:51:12.220
 in different cultures and different religions

1:51:12.220 --> 1:51:14.260
 of deliberately restricting food,

1:51:14.260 --> 1:51:17.980
 not just to increase the rewarding properties of food itself

1:51:17.980 --> 1:51:20.540
 but also to increase the rewarding properties

1:51:20.540 --> 1:51:22.060
 of deprivation.

1:51:22.060 --> 1:51:25.060
 And I should emphasize that a lot of the subjective aspects

1:51:25.060 --> 1:51:27.500
 of the knowledge of the benefits of fasting

1:51:27.500 --> 1:51:32.500
 serve as reinforcing dopamine amplifying aspects to fasting.

1:51:33.140 --> 1:51:36.580
 Meaning if somebody does intermittent fasting

1:51:36.580 --> 1:51:38.360
 and they are deep into their fast

1:51:38.360 --> 1:51:39.260
 and they're telling themselves,

1:51:39.260 --> 1:51:41.860
 oh, my blood lipid profiles are probably improving

1:51:41.860 --> 1:51:44.460
 and my glucose management is probably improving,

1:51:44.460 --> 1:51:46.260
 my insulin sensitivity is going up

1:51:46.260 --> 1:51:47.180
 and I'm going to live longer,

1:51:47.180 --> 1:51:50.980
 all these things that have some basis from animal studies

1:51:50.980 --> 1:51:53.740
 and some basis or not from human studies,

1:51:53.740 --> 1:51:55.760
 it's all kind of still in emerging literature,

1:51:55.760 --> 1:51:57.620
 but it does seem to be pointing in that direction

1:51:57.620 --> 1:52:01.280
 that fasting can encourage things like autophagy,

1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:04.500
 the engulfment of dead cells and things of that sort.

1:52:04.500 --> 1:52:07.760
 Well, as people tell themselves these things,

1:52:07.760 --> 1:52:10.940
 they are enhancing the rewarding properties

1:52:10.940 --> 1:52:12.860
 of the behavior of fasting.

1:52:12.860 --> 1:52:14.980
 And so this is a salient example

1:52:14.980 --> 1:52:18.820
 of where knowledge of knowledge can actually help us

1:52:18.820 --> 1:52:23.020
 change these deep primitive circuits related to dopamine.

1:52:23.020 --> 1:52:25.440
 And this illustrates how the forebrain,

1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:28.260
 which carries knowledge and carries interpretation

1:52:28.260 --> 1:52:29.540
 and rational thought,

1:52:29.540 --> 1:52:32.680
 can be used to shape the very circuits

1:52:32.680 --> 1:52:35.260
 that are involved in generating reward

1:52:35.260 --> 1:52:36.820
 for what would otherwise just be kind of

1:52:36.820 --> 1:52:39.060
 primitive behaviors, hardwired behaviors.

1:52:39.060 --> 1:52:41.340
 And that's the beauty of these dopamine circuits.

1:52:41.340 --> 1:52:42.540
 That's the beauty of dopamine.

1:52:42.540 --> 1:52:46.060
 It's not just attached to the more primitive behaviors

1:52:46.060 --> 1:52:49.480
 of food, sex, heat, et cetera.

1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:52.420
 It's also attached to the things that we decide

1:52:52.420 --> 1:52:54.660
 are good for us and are important for us.

1:52:54.660 --> 1:52:57.340
 So telling yourself that exercise or fasting

1:52:57.340 --> 1:53:00.180
 or studying or listening better

1:53:00.180 --> 1:53:01.780
 or any kind of behavior is good for you

1:53:01.780 --> 1:53:04.940
 will actually reinforce the extent to which

1:53:04.940 --> 1:53:08.000
 it is good for you at a chemical level.

1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.660
 And a somewhat eerie example of what I just mentioned

1:53:11.660 --> 1:53:13.740
 was a study that was published last year

1:53:13.740 --> 1:53:15.420
 in the journal Neuron, Cell Press Journal,

1:53:15.420 --> 1:53:20.180
 excellent journal, that showed that hearing something

1:53:20.180 --> 1:53:22.920
 that reinforces one's prior beliefs

1:53:22.920 --> 1:53:25.380
 actually can evoke dopamine release.

1:53:25.380 --> 1:53:28.460
 So the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable

1:53:28.460 --> 1:53:30.660
 to subjective interpretation

1:53:30.660 --> 1:53:33.580
 that it actually makes it such that when we see something

1:53:33.580 --> 1:53:35.700
 or hear something that validates a belief

1:53:35.700 --> 1:53:36.840
 that we already have,

1:53:36.840 --> 1:53:40.560
 that itself can increase dopamine release.

1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:44.140
 Along the lines of how dopamine and dopamine schedules

1:53:44.140 --> 1:53:46.620
 and our perception of things can shape the way

1:53:46.620 --> 1:53:49.520
 that we experience things as pleasureful or not,

1:53:49.520 --> 1:53:53.340
 there are beautiful studies mainly looking at sugar appetite

1:53:53.340 --> 1:53:55.860
 and our sense of pleasure from sweet things,

1:53:55.860 --> 1:53:58.660
 but also for savory foods, et cetera.

1:53:58.660 --> 1:54:00.600
 And essentially the results that come out of this

1:54:00.600 --> 1:54:01.540
 are the following.

1:54:01.540 --> 1:54:03.820
 If you ingest something that you like,

1:54:03.820 --> 1:54:05.080
 it tastes good to you,

1:54:05.080 --> 1:54:07.900
 but then you ingest something that's even sweeter

1:54:07.900 --> 1:54:09.620
 or even more savory,

1:54:09.620 --> 1:54:13.540
 and then you go back to the food that you ate previously,

1:54:13.540 --> 1:54:15.580
 well, you don't like it as much.

1:54:15.580 --> 1:54:18.300
 And that might seem like a duh, obviously,

1:54:18.300 --> 1:54:22.560
 but that shift in perception can be blocked

1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:25.160
 by blocking the shift in dopamine.

1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:28.160
 And so this really speaks to these peaks and valleys

1:54:28.160 --> 1:54:29.500
 in dopamine that I mentioned before

1:54:29.500 --> 1:54:31.860
 and how your experience of anything

1:54:31.860 --> 1:54:34.700
 is going to depend on your prior experience

1:54:34.700 --> 1:54:36.860
 of other things that evoke dopamine.

1:54:36.860 --> 1:54:39.840
 Big dopamine release makes it more challenging

1:54:39.840 --> 1:54:42.980
 to experience more big dopamine release.

1:54:42.980 --> 1:54:44.640
 So dopamine is one of those things

1:54:44.640 --> 1:54:47.820
 that you don't want too high or too low for too long.

1:54:47.820 --> 1:54:50.100
 It's all about staying in that dynamic range,

1:54:50.100 --> 1:54:52.460
 and that's going to be different for everybody.

1:54:52.460 --> 1:54:57.460
 So for the very savory foods that are now everywhere,

1:54:57.460 --> 1:54:59.740
 those highly savory foods are,

1:54:59.740 --> 1:55:02.140
 I think they call them highly palatable foods,

1:55:02.140 --> 1:55:04.580
 are making more bland foods,

1:55:04.580 --> 1:55:07.400
 whole foods, meaning foods that aren't processed,

1:55:07.400 --> 1:55:10.140
 it's making those taste less good, at least for a while.

1:55:10.140 --> 1:55:12.280
 And all it takes is a short period of time,

1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:14.580
 even just days, two days or so,

1:55:14.580 --> 1:55:17.940
 of not consuming any highly palatable foods.

1:55:17.940 --> 1:55:22.420
 And suddenly, broccoli with just a little bit of seasoning

1:55:22.420 --> 1:55:24.500
 tastes delicious to you, all right?

1:55:24.500 --> 1:55:26.620
 So again, this just speaks to the fact

1:55:26.620 --> 1:55:29.140
 that dopamine is this universal currency.

1:55:29.140 --> 1:55:31.980
 It establishes value based on not just

1:55:31.980 --> 1:55:33.200
 what you're experiencing in the moment,

1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:36.580
 but what you experienced in the days and minutes before.

1:55:36.580 --> 1:55:40.400
 Now that you understand how your previous level of dopamine

1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:42.660
 relates to your current level of dopamine

1:55:42.660 --> 1:55:45.200
 and how your current level of dopamine

1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:48.460
 will influence your future level of dopamine,

1:55:48.460 --> 1:55:52.560
 it should become obvious why things like pornography,

1:55:52.560 --> 1:55:54.660
 not just the accessibility of pornography,

1:55:54.660 --> 1:55:59.620
 but the intensity of pornography can negatively shape

1:55:59.620 --> 1:56:02.660
 real world romantic and sexual interactions.

1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:04.020
 This is a serious concern.

1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:06.180
 The discussion is happening now.

1:56:06.180 --> 1:56:08.260
 The underlying neurobiological mechanisms

1:56:08.260 --> 1:56:11.520
 you now understand, and this isn't to pass judgment

1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:14.740
 on whether or not people like or don't like pornography.

1:56:14.740 --> 1:56:15.900
 That's an ethical discussion,

1:56:15.900 --> 1:56:18.020
 and it's a moral discussion that has to be decided

1:56:18.020 --> 1:56:21.300
 for each individual by virtue of age, et cetera.

1:56:21.300 --> 1:56:26.300
 But again, any activity that evokes a lot of dopamine release

1:56:27.700 --> 1:56:32.140
 will make it harder to achieve the same level

1:56:32.140 --> 1:56:34.560
 and certainly the greater level of dopamine

1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:36.840
 through a subsequent interaction.

1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:40.400
 So yes, indeed, many people are addicted to pornography

1:56:40.400 --> 1:56:44.500
 and yes, indeed, many people who regularly indulge

1:56:44.500 --> 1:56:46.800
 in pornography experience challenges

1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:49.100
 in real world romantic interactions.

1:56:49.100 --> 1:56:52.260
 You now understand the mechanisms behind what I'm telling you.

1:56:52.260 --> 1:56:55.020
 Now, there are circumstances in which increasing levels

1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:57.820
 of dopamine is desirable and advantageous

1:56:57.820 --> 1:56:59.380
 and clinically helpful.

1:56:59.380 --> 1:57:01.740
 Good example of this would be the drug Wellbutrin,

1:57:01.740 --> 1:57:03.260
 also called buprenorphine,

1:57:03.260 --> 1:57:06.140
 which increases dopamine and norepinephrine.

1:57:06.140 --> 1:57:07.820
 Wellbutrin and buprenorphine was developed

1:57:07.820 --> 1:57:10.180
 as an alternative treatment for depression

1:57:10.180 --> 1:57:12.820
 because some people who take the so-called SSRI,

1:57:12.820 --> 1:57:15.580
 selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

1:57:15.580 --> 1:57:17.820
 which as the name suggests, increase serotonin,

1:57:17.820 --> 1:57:21.360
 suffer from serotonin-related side effects,

1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:24.740
 things like decreased appetite, decreased libido,

1:57:24.740 --> 1:57:27.080
 or sometimes increased appetite,

1:57:27.080 --> 1:57:30.360
 or other side effects that they don't want.

1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:34.220
 And while butrin seems to avoid the sexual side effects,

1:57:34.220 --> 1:57:38.460
 it can blunt appetite and these sorts of things

1:57:38.460 --> 1:57:41.840
 because of the increase in norepinephrine and dopamine,

1:57:41.840 --> 1:57:44.500
 increases levels of motivation and craving,

1:57:44.500 --> 1:57:49.140
 but also can create a state of elevated alertness

1:57:49.140 --> 1:57:52.120
 that can sometimes get in the way of healthy eating

1:57:52.120 --> 1:57:52.960
 and things of that sort.

1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:55.500
 So one has to work with their clinician,

1:57:55.500 --> 1:57:57.960
 as a psychiatrist, it is a prescription drug,

1:57:57.960 --> 1:57:59.900
 in order to find the dosage of Wellbutrin

1:57:59.900 --> 1:58:01.820
 that's correct for them.

1:58:01.820 --> 1:58:04.400
 In addition, things like Wellbutrin and buprenorphine

1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:06.500
 can increase anxiety because of the way

1:58:06.500 --> 1:58:09.060
 that dopamine and norepinephrine are stimulating

1:58:09.060 --> 1:58:10.940
 and tend to place people into heightened levels

1:58:10.940 --> 1:58:11.760
 of alertness.

1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:14.660
 Nonetheless, many people have gained terrific relief

1:58:14.660 --> 1:58:17.260
 from depression from Wellbutrin, buprenorphine,

1:58:17.260 --> 1:58:19.780
 and many of those same people had serious trouble

1:58:19.780 --> 1:58:21.060
 with some of the SSRIs.

1:58:21.060 --> 1:58:23.180
 So it does seem to be a very useful drug

1:58:23.180 --> 1:58:24.860
 in certain contexts, both for depression

1:58:24.860 --> 1:58:26.820
 and for the treatment of smoking,

1:58:26.820 --> 1:58:29.140
 for people desiring to quit smoking.

1:58:29.140 --> 1:58:31.220
 And of course, there are a lot of people out there

1:58:31.220 --> 1:58:33.500
 who are seeking to increase their baseline levels

1:58:33.500 --> 1:58:35.820
 of dopamine without taking

1:58:35.820 --> 1:58:38.660
 any prescription pharmaceutical compounds.

1:58:38.660 --> 1:58:42.420
 And nowadays there exist a lot of supplements to do that.

1:58:42.420 --> 1:58:44.760
 The two most common ones that are directly

1:58:44.760 --> 1:58:48.420
 within the dopamine pathway are mucuna prurines,

1:58:48.420 --> 1:58:53.420
 which is actually a velvety bean whose contents are L-DOPA.

1:58:54.340 --> 1:58:56.300
 Believe it or not, the content of this bean

1:58:56.300 --> 1:58:58.600
 is the precursor to dopamine.

1:58:58.600 --> 1:59:01.500
 So mucuna prurines is sold over the counter,

1:59:01.500 --> 1:59:03.180
 at least in the United States,

1:59:03.180 --> 1:59:07.060
 and it literally is the precursor to dopamine.

1:59:07.060 --> 1:59:09.160
 Meaning if you take it, you will experience

1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:11.140
 very large increases in dopamine.

1:59:11.140 --> 1:59:14.060
 Those increases are transient and very, very intense.

1:59:14.060 --> 1:59:17.780
 And in fact, if you look at the constellation of effects

1:59:17.780 --> 1:59:20.320
 of mucuna prurines, what you find is that

1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:22.880
 they're pretty striking and they look a lot like,

1:59:22.880 --> 1:59:25.640
 if not identical to, L-DOPA.

1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:28.340
 The most obvious of those is in the context

1:59:28.340 --> 1:59:29.660
 of Parkinson's disease.

1:59:29.660 --> 1:59:31.740
 There are at least five studies that have shown

1:59:31.740 --> 1:59:35.140
 that mucuna prurines can reduce the symptoms

1:59:35.140 --> 1:59:37.400
 of Parkinson's disease, much in the same way

1:59:37.400 --> 1:59:41.300
 that L-DOPA can reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

1:59:41.300 --> 1:59:42.900
 And that shouldn't come as any surprise,

1:59:42.900 --> 1:59:43.820
 given what I just told you,

1:59:43.820 --> 1:59:46.820
 that mucuna prurines is essentially L-DOPA.

1:59:46.820 --> 1:59:50.240
 It also can reduce a particular hormone called prolactin.

1:59:50.240 --> 1:59:51.860
 Dopamine and prolactin tend to be

1:59:51.860 --> 1:59:53.880
 in somewhat push-pull fashion.

1:59:53.880 --> 1:59:57.240
 When dopamine is up, prolactin is down and vice versa.

1:59:57.240 --> 1:59:59.580
 Prolactin is involved in milk let down in women.

1:59:59.580 --> 2:00:02.300
 It's involved in setting the refractory period

2:00:02.300 --> 2:00:05.980
 for sex after ejaculation in males.

2:00:05.980 --> 2:00:08.560
 The reason mating can occur and then not occur

2:00:08.560 --> 2:00:11.220
 after ejaculation is because of an increase in prolactin.

2:00:11.220 --> 2:00:14.900
 Mucuna prurines is often used to blunt prolactin.

2:00:14.900 --> 2:00:17.020
 And there are actually a couple of studies showing

2:00:17.020 --> 2:00:18.500
 that it can indeed do that.

2:00:19.460 --> 2:00:21.760
 Mucuna prurines has a number of other effects

2:00:21.760 --> 2:00:24.900
 that lie in the sort of sex and reproduction pathway

2:00:24.900 --> 2:00:25.980
 that are worth noting.

2:00:26.980 --> 2:00:29.660
 Sperm concentration, sperm quality

2:00:29.660 --> 2:00:32.540
 is actually greatly increased by mucuna prurines.

2:00:32.540 --> 2:00:33.780
 These are kind of curious effects

2:00:33.780 --> 2:00:35.020
 until you understand a little bit more

2:00:35.020 --> 2:00:36.380
 about the biology of dopamine,

2:00:36.380 --> 2:00:37.900
 which I'll mention in a moment.

2:00:37.900 --> 2:00:41.680
 But there are several studies, four in fact,

2:00:41.680 --> 2:00:46.680
 that describe how mucuna prurines can increase sperm count,

2:00:47.040 --> 2:00:49.640
 sperm quality and sperm motility.

2:00:49.640 --> 2:00:52.340
 So for those of you seeking to conceive children,

2:00:52.340 --> 2:00:54.940
 mucuna prurines might be an interesting choice

2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:58.100
 if you're interested in exploring non-prescription compounds.

2:00:58.100 --> 2:01:00.300
 However, I should mention

2:01:00.300 --> 2:01:03.580
 that anytime you consume a substance

2:01:03.580 --> 2:01:07.660
 that increases dopamine by mimicking dopamine

2:01:07.660 --> 2:01:10.620
 or acting as a direct precursor to dopamine,

2:01:10.620 --> 2:01:13.540
 there's almost inevitably a crash

2:01:13.540 --> 2:01:16.420
 or a reduction in the baseline in dopamine

2:01:16.420 --> 2:01:18.660
 that we referred to previously.

2:01:18.660 --> 2:01:20.780
 So many people who take mucuna prurines

2:01:20.780 --> 2:01:24.860
 feel really elevated, really motivated, really alert,

2:01:24.860 --> 2:01:26.620
 all the sorts of things that one would expect

2:01:26.620 --> 2:01:30.380
 from a dopaminergic drug, which mucuna prurines is,

2:01:30.380 --> 2:01:34.700
 and then they feel a low or a reduction in drive

2:01:34.700 --> 2:01:38.140
 and excitement and enthusiasm after the drug wears off,

2:01:38.140 --> 2:01:40.140
 just like they would with any other

2:01:40.140 --> 2:01:41.960
 dopamine-increasing compound.

2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:45.340
 For that reason, many people have turned

2:01:45.340 --> 2:01:47.380
 to the use of L-tyrosine.

2:01:47.380 --> 2:01:50.740
 L-tyrosine is an amino acid precursor to L-DOPA,

2:01:50.740 --> 2:01:54.180
 so it lies further up the dopamine synthesis pathway.

2:01:54.180 --> 2:01:55.780
 And nowadays, it's very common

2:01:55.780 --> 2:01:58.420
 because L-tyrosine is sold over the counter

2:01:58.420 --> 2:02:00.060
 in the United States,

2:02:00.060 --> 2:02:02.860
 that people will take L-tyrosine as a way

2:02:02.860 --> 2:02:06.120
 to get more energized, alert, and focused.

2:02:06.120 --> 2:02:07.480
 Indeed, there are data

2:02:07.480 --> 2:02:09.560
 that L-tyrosine will accomplish that.

2:02:10.460 --> 2:02:13.140
 L-tyrosine is typically taken in capsule form

2:02:13.140 --> 2:02:16.740
 or powder form, anywhere from 500 to 750

2:02:16.740 --> 2:02:18.500
 to 1,000 milligrams.

2:02:18.500 --> 2:02:21.840
 It is a potent stimulus for increasing dopamine,

2:02:21.840 --> 2:02:23.700
 and the timescale for increasing dopamine

2:02:23.700 --> 2:02:26.500
 is about 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion,

2:02:26.500 --> 2:02:28.340
 dopamine levels start to peak.

2:02:28.340 --> 2:02:31.660
 The classic study that really nailed down the fact

2:02:31.660 --> 2:02:34.020
 that tyrosine has this effect

2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:36.700
 was published way back in 1983,

2:02:36.700 --> 2:02:39.520
 Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism,

2:02:39.520 --> 2:02:42.900
 that directly compared L-tyrosine supplementation

2:02:42.900 --> 2:02:47.900
 with tryptophan ingestion on plasma dopamine and serotonin,

2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:51.340
 tryptophan being a precursor to serotonin.

2:02:51.340 --> 2:02:53.020
 And indeed, what they found

2:02:53.020 --> 2:02:56.200
 is that ingestion of L-tyrosine can increase

2:02:56.200 --> 2:02:58.780
 the amount of dopamine circulating in the blood

2:02:58.780 --> 2:03:00.740
 and in the brain too, of course.

2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:04.540
 The tyrosine ingestion induced dopamine increases

2:03:04.540 --> 2:03:07.620
 within 45 minutes, and they were short lasting.

2:03:07.620 --> 2:03:10.960
 After about 30 minutes, the effect had dissipated,

2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:13.940
 meaning the levels of dopamine had dropped down to baseline.

2:03:13.940 --> 2:03:16.060
 And even though they didn't look at levels

2:03:16.060 --> 2:03:19.140
 of baseline dopamine past that time point,

2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:21.600
 the expectation based on everything we know

2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:24.180
 about dopamine biology is that it would then drop

2:03:24.180 --> 2:03:27.240
 below baseline due to the depletion

2:03:27.240 --> 2:03:29.900
 of the readily reservable pool of dopamine vesicles

2:03:29.900 --> 2:03:30.960
 that we talked about way back

2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:33.320
 at the beginning of this episode.

2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:34.340
 The nice thing about this study

2:03:34.340 --> 2:03:36.340
 is it does show specificity of effect

2:03:36.340 --> 2:03:40.300
 because ingestion of tryptophan did not increase dopamine,

2:03:40.300 --> 2:03:42.300
 instead it increased serotonin.

2:03:42.300 --> 2:03:44.260
 So there's really specificity of these pathways

2:03:44.260 --> 2:03:46.580
 that rule out any placebo type effects.

2:03:48.180 --> 2:03:51.140
 I'm not suggesting that anybody, everybody

2:03:51.140 --> 2:03:52.660
 increase their dopamine levels

2:03:52.660 --> 2:03:55.900
 by way of tyrosine and macuna purines.

2:03:55.900 --> 2:03:57.060
 For those of you that are seeking

2:03:57.060 --> 2:03:59.780
 to increase your dopamine levels without prescription drugs,

2:03:59.780 --> 2:04:01.900
 those are the most direct route to that.

2:04:01.900 --> 2:04:04.060
 Of course, if you have a pre-existing

2:04:04.060 --> 2:04:06.900
 dopaminergic condition, so schizophrenia

2:04:06.900 --> 2:04:11.560
 or psychosis of any kind, bipolar, anxiety,

2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:14.100
 things like macuna purines and L-tyrosine

2:04:14.100 --> 2:04:15.860
 will not be good for you.

2:04:15.860 --> 2:04:18.900
 And if you don't, you should just understand

2:04:18.900 --> 2:04:21.260
 and expect that it's going to lead

2:04:21.260 --> 2:04:23.340
 to an increase in dopamine.

2:04:23.340 --> 2:04:25.140
 You'll certainly feel an elevated state.

2:04:25.140 --> 2:04:27.820
 For some of you that might be agitating,

2:04:27.820 --> 2:04:29.580
 for some of you that might be really pleasurable,

2:04:29.580 --> 2:04:31.880
 and then you will feel a crash afterwards.

2:04:31.880 --> 2:04:35.140
 How deep is that crash will really depend on your biology

2:04:35.140 --> 2:04:38.300
 and where your dopamine baseline began.

2:04:38.300 --> 2:04:41.020
 So I personally am not a fan of using things

2:04:41.020 --> 2:04:43.620
 like macuna purines at all for myself,

2:04:43.620 --> 2:04:45.680
 for the reasons I mentioned earlier,

2:04:45.680 --> 2:04:48.280
 just too intense and too much of a crash.

2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:50.700
 I do use L-tyrosine from time to time

2:04:50.700 --> 2:04:52.460
 for enhancing focus and motivation,

2:04:52.460 --> 2:04:55.180
 but I want to emphasize from time to time.

2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:58.460
 So I might use it once a week, occasionally twice a week,

2:04:58.460 --> 2:05:01.340
 but I've never been one to take L-tyrosine regularly

2:05:01.340 --> 2:05:04.900
 in order to focus or train or do any kind of mental work.

2:05:04.900 --> 2:05:08.940
 I just don't want to rely on any exogenous substance

2:05:08.940 --> 2:05:12.320
 in order to get my dopamine circuits activated.

2:05:12.320 --> 2:05:15.140
 And I don't want to experience the drop in dopamine

2:05:15.140 --> 2:05:18.420
 that inevitably occurs some period of time afterwards.

2:05:18.420 --> 2:05:22.260
 I should also mention things that can reduce your levels

2:05:22.260 --> 2:05:23.960
 of baseline dopamine.

2:05:23.960 --> 2:05:27.600
 One that is rarely discussed is melatonin.

2:05:27.600 --> 2:05:30.460
 I have talked before on this podcast about melatonin,

2:05:30.460 --> 2:05:33.220
 why I am not a fan of using melatonin

2:05:33.220 --> 2:05:35.100
 in order to enhance sleep.

2:05:35.100 --> 2:05:37.660
 It can help one get to sleep, but not stay asleep.

2:05:37.660 --> 2:05:39.300
 Dr. Matt Walker, sleep expert

2:05:39.300 --> 2:05:41.400
 from University of California, Berkeley.

2:05:41.400 --> 2:05:43.840
 I think I don't want to put words in his mouth,

2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:48.620
 but in our discussion about melatonin on this podcast,

2:05:48.620 --> 2:05:51.420
 when Matt was a guest and in his book and on other podcasts,

2:05:51.420 --> 2:05:54.660
 Matt has generally stated that the use of melatonin

2:05:54.660 --> 2:05:58.260
 except for treatment of jet lag is generally not a good idea

2:05:58.260 --> 2:05:59.740
 and I agree.

2:05:59.740 --> 2:06:03.180
 I think that melatonin is not often thought about

2:06:03.180 --> 2:06:04.820
 as impacting the dopamine pathway,

2:06:04.820 --> 2:06:08.660
 but there's at least one study published in 2001.

2:06:08.660 --> 2:06:12.540
 First author is Nishiyama, just as it sounds,

2:06:12.540 --> 2:06:14.480
 it's spelled just as it sounds,

2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:16.440
 acute effects of melatonin administration

2:06:16.440 --> 2:06:19.000
 on cardiovascular autonomic regulation in healthy men.

2:06:19.000 --> 2:06:21.800
 So the study wasn't specifically about dopamine,

2:06:21.800 --> 2:06:24.180
 but they looked at norepinephrine and dopamine levels

2:06:24.180 --> 2:06:28.720
 and they found a statistically significant decrease

2:06:28.720 --> 2:06:32.700
 in dopamine 60 minutes after melatonin administration.

2:06:32.700 --> 2:06:36.060
 I've talked before about how viewing bright lights

2:06:36.060 --> 2:06:38.160
 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

2:06:38.160 --> 2:06:40.480
 has been shown in studies by Dr. Samir Hattar,

2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:42.920
 David Berson, excellent circadian scientists

2:06:44.260 --> 2:06:46.980
 to reduce levels of dopamine for several days

2:06:46.980 --> 2:06:48.280
 after that light exposure.

2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:50.420
 So dim the lights at night.

2:06:50.420 --> 2:06:53.660
 If you can avoid exogenous melatonin,

2:06:53.660 --> 2:06:56.240
 meaning if you don't have to take melatonin

2:06:56.240 --> 2:06:58.080
 and you can find a better alternative,

2:06:58.080 --> 2:06:58.960
 that would be a good idea

2:06:58.960 --> 2:07:01.700
 if you want to maintain healthy levels of dopamine.

2:07:01.700 --> 2:07:04.460
 Now, there is one compound that you are all familiar with

2:07:04.460 --> 2:07:07.540
 and you've probably actually taken without realizing it

2:07:07.540 --> 2:07:08.780
 that increases dopamine

2:07:08.780 --> 2:07:12.980
 and that's something called PEA for phenylethylamine,

2:07:12.980 --> 2:07:16.060
 technically beta phenylethylamine.

2:07:16.060 --> 2:07:19.180
 And PEA is found in various foods.

2:07:19.180 --> 2:07:23.020
 Chocolate just happens to be one enriched in PEA

2:07:23.020 --> 2:07:25.680
 and can increase synaptic levels of dopamine.

2:07:26.700 --> 2:07:29.620
 I personally take PEA from time to time

2:07:29.620 --> 2:07:32.700
 as a focus and work aid

2:07:32.700 --> 2:07:35.400
 in order to do intense bouts of work.

2:07:35.400 --> 2:07:36.860
 Again, I don't do that too often.

2:07:36.860 --> 2:07:39.300
 This might be once a week or once every two weeks.

2:07:39.300 --> 2:07:41.660
 I might use it for training, but typically I don't.

2:07:41.660 --> 2:07:42.980
 It's usually for mental work.

2:07:42.980 --> 2:07:46.180
 And I will take 500 milligrams of PEA

2:07:46.180 --> 2:07:49.220
 and I'll take 300 milligrams of alpha GPC.

2:07:49.220 --> 2:07:50.780
 That's something that I personally do.

2:07:50.780 --> 2:07:51.840
 That's what's right for me.

2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:54.320
 It's within my margins of safety for my health.

2:07:54.320 --> 2:07:55.940
 Again, you have to check with your doctor

2:07:55.940 --> 2:07:57.940
 and decide what's right for you.

2:07:57.940 --> 2:08:02.500
 It leads to a sharp but very transient increase in dopamine

2:08:02.500 --> 2:08:05.500
 that lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.

2:08:05.500 --> 2:08:10.100
 And at least in my system, I found to be much more regulated

2:08:10.100 --> 2:08:13.280
 and kind of even than something like L-tyrosine

2:08:13.280 --> 2:08:15.620
 and certainly much more regulated and even

2:08:15.620 --> 2:08:17.980
 and lower dopamine release than something

2:08:17.980 --> 2:08:20.200
 like mucuna prurines.

2:08:20.200 --> 2:08:22.820
 One of the lesser talked about compounds that's out there

2:08:22.820 --> 2:08:26.540
 but that's gaining popularity for increasing dopamine

2:08:26.540 --> 2:08:28.300
 and as a so-called nootropic

2:08:28.300 --> 2:08:30.580
 is something called Hooperzine A.

2:08:30.580 --> 2:08:33.780
 Hooperzine A is a compound sold over the counter,

2:08:33.780 --> 2:08:35.180
 at least in the United States,

2:08:35.180 --> 2:08:38.100
 that can increase acetylcholine transmission,

2:08:38.100 --> 2:08:40.380
 a different neuromodulator entirely.

2:08:40.380 --> 2:08:43.660
 But what's interesting is that Hooperzine A somehow

2:08:43.660 --> 2:08:46.660
 by way of interactions between the cholinergic system

2:08:46.660 --> 2:08:51.020
 and the dopaminergic system leads to increases in dopamine

2:08:51.020 --> 2:08:53.660
 in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.

2:08:53.660 --> 2:08:55.620
 Hippocampus, of course, being an area of the brain

2:08:55.620 --> 2:08:57.180
 associated with learning and memory

2:08:57.180 --> 2:08:58.980
 and prefrontal cortex being associated

2:08:58.980 --> 2:09:02.260
 with the mesolimbic pathway decision-making focus, et cetera.

2:09:02.260 --> 2:09:04.580
 And so I think the reason why we're seeing an increase

2:09:04.580 --> 2:09:07.980
 in popularity of companies, including Hooperzine A

2:09:07.980 --> 2:09:10.020
 and nootropic compounds is both

2:09:10.020 --> 2:09:12.140
 for the cholinergic stimulating properties

2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:15.520
 but also for stimulating dopamine release.

2:09:15.520 --> 2:09:17.500
 I personally have never tried Hooperzine A.

2:09:17.500 --> 2:09:21.440
 You can go to examine.com or put Hooperzine A into PubMed

2:09:21.440 --> 2:09:22.660
 if you'd like to search around

2:09:22.660 --> 2:09:24.340
 and see some of the science behind it.

2:09:24.340 --> 2:09:26.300
 Again, I'm not recommending anyone take these things.

2:09:26.300 --> 2:09:28.460
 In fact, I recommend against anyone just diving in

2:09:28.460 --> 2:09:31.180
 and starting to consume things without gaining knowledge

2:09:31.180 --> 2:09:32.820
 about how they function and whether or not

2:09:32.820 --> 2:09:33.940
 they're right for you.

2:09:33.940 --> 2:09:36.080
 But nonetheless, I think in the years to come,

2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:39.320
 we are going to see a lot more of L-tyrosine,

2:09:39.320 --> 2:09:42.300
 PEA, phenylethylamine, and Hooperzine

2:09:42.300 --> 2:09:44.720
 as a way of tapping into the dopaminergic

2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:45.960
 and cholinergic circuits,

2:09:45.960 --> 2:09:48.360
 certainly along with things like alpha-GPC

2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:50.860
 as non-prescription, short-lived,

2:09:50.860 --> 2:09:54.180
 somewhat milder alternatives to things

2:09:54.180 --> 2:09:56.340
 that really spike dopamine,

2:09:56.340 --> 2:09:57.740
 things like Adderall, Ritalin,

2:09:57.740 --> 2:10:00.620
 modafinil, R-modafinil, and similar.

2:10:00.620 --> 2:10:02.900
 And I can't help but share with you one more result.

2:10:02.900 --> 2:10:04.900
 It's not related to pharmacology.

2:10:04.900 --> 2:10:08.540
 It's related to behaviors and social interactions.

2:10:08.540 --> 2:10:10.220
 And that's the very interesting,

2:10:10.220 --> 2:10:12.340
 and I would say important finding

2:10:12.340 --> 2:10:15.140
 that was made a few years ago by my colleague, Rob Malenka,

2:10:15.140 --> 2:10:17.500
 who's in our Department of Psychiatry at Stanford,

2:10:17.500 --> 2:10:20.820
 showing that oxytocin and social connection

2:10:20.820 --> 2:10:24.740
 is actually directly stimulating the dopamine pathway.

2:10:24.740 --> 2:10:27.940
 I think for many years, all of us, including me,

2:10:28.780 --> 2:10:31.900
 would hear and thought that oxytocin

2:10:31.900 --> 2:10:33.780
 was in the serotonergic pathway,

2:10:33.780 --> 2:10:35.300
 that it was about pair bonding,

2:10:35.300 --> 2:10:37.400
 and it was about some of these neuromodulators

2:10:37.400 --> 2:10:40.080
 that were more associated with things related

2:10:40.080 --> 2:10:43.500
 to feeling good with what we have in the present moment.

2:10:43.500 --> 2:10:44.620
 That's typically what we think of

2:10:44.620 --> 2:10:46.140
 when we think of the opioid system

2:10:46.140 --> 2:10:48.080
 or the serotonergic system.

2:10:48.080 --> 2:10:50.920
 The dopamine system is really about seeking and reward.

2:10:50.920 --> 2:10:53.820
 But in a paper published in 2017 in the journal Science,

2:10:53.820 --> 2:10:57.020
 excellent journal, the paper's titled

2:10:57.020 --> 2:11:02.020
 Gating of Social Reward by Oxytocin in the Ventral Tegmental Area.

2:11:02.580 --> 2:11:04.180
 You now know what the ventral tegmental area,

2:11:04.180 --> 2:11:06.280
 it's that area of the mesolimbic pathway.

2:11:06.280 --> 2:11:10.380
 What this paper essentially showed is that oxytocin,

2:11:10.380 --> 2:11:13.120
 social connection and pair bonding itself

2:11:13.120 --> 2:11:14.980
 triggers dopamine release.

2:11:14.980 --> 2:11:17.180
 And as everyone read this result,

2:11:17.180 --> 2:11:20.720
 we all realized, ah, this makes total sense

2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:22.620
 that for the evolution of our species,

2:11:22.620 --> 2:11:25.140
 indeed for any species where social connections

2:11:25.140 --> 2:11:27.420
 are important, it's also important

2:11:27.420 --> 2:11:29.260
 to go seek social connections.

2:11:29.260 --> 2:11:31.580
 And so while it's fun to think about pharmacology

2:11:31.580 --> 2:11:34.900
 and underlying neural circuitry and cold water baths

2:11:34.900 --> 2:11:38.500
 and all these different things related to dopamine schedules

2:11:38.500 --> 2:11:41.320
 and reward mechanisms and attaching reward to effort

2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:43.340
 and all the various things that we've talked about today

2:11:43.340 --> 2:11:45.540
 in terms of science and tools and protocols,

2:11:46.700 --> 2:11:48.340
 I'd be remiss if I didn't include

2:11:48.340 --> 2:11:51.060
 description of this result and just emphasize

2:11:51.060 --> 2:11:55.220
 that social connections, close social connections

2:11:55.220 --> 2:11:57.340
 in particular that evoke oxytocin release.

2:11:57.340 --> 2:12:01.220
 So those are romantic type, those are parent-child type,

2:12:01.220 --> 2:12:02.660
 those are friendship related,

2:12:02.660 --> 2:12:06.540
 and those can even be just friends at a distance related.

2:12:06.540 --> 2:12:08.740
 It doesn't actually require skin contact

2:12:08.740 --> 2:12:11.340
 to get oxytocin release,

2:12:11.340 --> 2:12:13.340
 but oxytocin release is central

2:12:13.340 --> 2:12:15.900
 to stimulating the dopamine pathways.

2:12:15.900 --> 2:12:18.720
 So the take-home message there is quite simple.

2:12:18.720 --> 2:12:23.720
 Engage in, pursue quality, healthy social interactions.

2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:26.300
 I know I've covered a lot of material today.

2:12:26.300 --> 2:12:28.120
 I've really tried hard to focus on things

2:12:28.120 --> 2:12:31.260
 that lie directly within the dopamine pathway

2:12:31.260 --> 2:12:33.400
 and circuitries, as well as things

2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:36.960
 that directly stimulate those pathways and circuitries.

2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:39.560
 What I haven't talked about are all the things

2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:42.880
 that indirectly serve the dopamine pathways.

2:12:42.880 --> 2:12:44.320
 And out there on the internet

2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:46.360
 and indeed in the scientific literature,

2:12:46.360 --> 2:12:47.640
 you will find, for instance,

2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:50.200
 that things like maca root can increase dopamine,

2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:53.520
 things like the gut microbiome can influence dopamine.

2:12:53.520 --> 2:12:54.920
 And indeed they can,

2:12:54.920 --> 2:12:57.040
 but they do that through indirect mechanisms

2:12:57.040 --> 2:12:59.960
 by creating an environment, a milieu,

2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:03.440
 in which dopamine and dopamine circuits can flourish.

2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:04.800
 Maca is a good example of that.

2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:06.320
 It will reduce cortisol

2:13:06.320 --> 2:13:09.380
 and through some indirect pathways related to cortisol

2:13:09.380 --> 2:13:10.840
 can increase dopamine,

2:13:10.840 --> 2:13:13.060
 but it's not a direct increase in dopamine.

2:13:13.060 --> 2:13:15.160
 And so as a consequence, it's rather subtle

2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:17.380
 compared to the various compounds and behaviors

2:13:17.380 --> 2:13:18.740
 that I talked about today.

2:13:18.740 --> 2:13:23.240
 Indeed, cold water exposure leads to huge increases

2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:25.540
 in dopamine, as we talked about before,

2:13:25.540 --> 2:13:27.520
 and very sustained ones at that.

2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:31.000
 I realize in giving you a lot of information

2:13:31.000 --> 2:13:32.560
 about science and mechanism,

2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:34.660
 all the way from psychological and biological

2:13:34.660 --> 2:13:36.500
 to circuitry and synaptic transmission,

2:13:36.500 --> 2:13:39.100
 volumetric transmission and so forth,

2:13:39.100 --> 2:13:40.720
 that it might seem overwhelming.

2:13:40.720 --> 2:13:42.560
 The most important things to understand

2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:43.800
 are that these dopamine pathways

2:13:43.800 --> 2:13:45.920
 really are under your control.

2:13:45.920 --> 2:13:49.040
 And the locus of control resides in the fact

2:13:49.040 --> 2:13:51.280
 that your previous levels of dopamine

2:13:51.280 --> 2:13:54.060
 are influencing your levels of dopamine right now,

2:13:54.060 --> 2:13:55.560
 and your current levels of dopamine

2:13:55.560 --> 2:13:56.960
 and where you take them next

2:13:56.960 --> 2:13:58.520
 will influence your dopamine levels

2:13:58.520 --> 2:14:00.300
 in the next days and weeks to come.

2:14:00.300 --> 2:14:04.000
 So I hope both with the mechanisms that you now have in hand

2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.720
 plus some of the tools to tap into the dopaminergic system,

2:14:06.720 --> 2:14:08.560
 both behavioral, pharmacologic,

2:14:08.560 --> 2:14:10.760
 prescription and non-prescription, et cetera,

2:14:10.760 --> 2:14:12.180
 that you'll feel that you have more control

2:14:12.180 --> 2:14:13.440
 over your dopamine system

2:14:13.440 --> 2:14:15.480
 and certainly that you have a better understanding

2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:16.840
 of your dopamine system

2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:19.840
 so that you can modulate and adjust your levels of dopamine

2:14:19.840 --> 2:14:22.080
 in the ways that serve you best.

 at any level that you like.

2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:20.460
 Today and on previous podcast episodes,

2:15:20.460 --> 2:15:22.360
 we talked a bit about supplements.

2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:24.300
 Supplements certainly aren't necessary,

2:15:24.300 --> 2:15:25.920
 but many people find them beneficial

2:15:25.920 --> 2:15:27.920
 for things like adjusting their levels of dopamine

2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:29.920
 or for other purposes.

2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:31.080
 If you're going to use supplements,

2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:33.280
 it's very important that the supplements you use

2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:36.720
 be of very high quality and that the quantity of ingredients

2:15:36.720 --> 2:15:39.560
 that are on the label match what's actually in those bottles.

2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:42.840
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:45.040
 because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency

2:15:45.040 --> 2:15:48.840
 with respect to quality and how much of each supplement

2:15:48.840 --> 2:15:51.040
 they put in the products that they sell.

2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:52.840
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,

2:15:52.840 --> 2:15:57.080
 you can go to Thorne, thorne.com slash the letter U

2:15:57.080 --> 2:15:59.260
 slash Huberman, and there you can see what I take.

2:15:59.260 --> 2:16:02.000
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements,

2:16:02.000 --> 2:16:04.040
 and if you navigate into the Thorne site

2:16:04.040 --> 2:16:07.040
 through that portal, then you can get 20% off

2:16:07.040 --> 2:16:09.060
 any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

2:16:09.060 --> 2:16:10.360
 If you're not already following us

2:16:10.360 --> 2:16:12.740
 on Instagram at Huberman Lab, please do so.

2:16:12.740 --> 2:16:15.960
 There, I teach neuroscience tools and information.

2:16:15.960 --> 2:16:17.580
 Oftentimes, it's tools and information

2:16:17.580 --> 2:16:19.660
 that I don't cover on the podcast.

2:16:19.660 --> 2:16:22.280
 We're also on Twitter, also at Huberman Lab.

2:16:22.280 --> 2:16:24.500
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:16:24.500 --> 2:16:26.300
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:16:26.300 --> 2:16:41.300
 I'll see you next time.
