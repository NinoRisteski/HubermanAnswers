00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.200
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.200 --> 00:12.900
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.900 --> 00:14.880
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.880 --> 00:17.360
 Today, my guest is Dr. Alia Crum.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.680
 Dr. Crum is a tenured professor of psychology

00:19.680 --> 00:22.420
 at Stanford University and the founder and director

00:22.420 --> 00:24.600
 of the Stanford Mind and Body Lab.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.840
 Her work focuses on mindsets,

00:26.840 --> 00:28.520
 how what we think and what we believe

00:28.520 --> 00:30.360
 shapes the way that our physiology,

00:30.360 --> 00:33.660
 our biology reacts to things like what we eat

00:33.660 --> 00:35.960
 or stress or exercise.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.360
 Indeed, as you will soon learn

00:37.360 --> 00:39.200
 from my discussion with Dr. Crum,

00:39.200 --> 00:42.540
 what you believe about the nutritional content of your food

00:42.540 --> 00:45.280
 changes the way that food impacts your brain and body

00:45.280 --> 00:46.720
 to a remarkable degree.

00:46.720 --> 00:49.240
 And the same is true for mindsets about exercise

00:49.240 --> 00:51.620
 and stress and even medication.

00:51.620 --> 00:54.120
 For instance, recent work from Dr. Crum's laboratory

00:54.120 --> 00:57.160
 shows that what we believe about the side effect profiles

00:57.160 --> 00:58.720
 of different drug treatments

00:58.720 --> 01:00.360
 or different behavioral treatments

01:00.360 --> 01:03.720
 has a profound impact on how quickly those treatments work

01:03.720 --> 01:05.920
 and the effectiveness of those treatments.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.580
 I just want to mention one particular study

01:07.580 --> 01:09.880
 that just came out from a graduate student

01:09.880 --> 01:13.540
 in Dr. Crum's laboratory, Lauren Howe, H-O-W-E,

01:13.540 --> 01:15.960
 showed that how kids react to a treatment

01:15.960 --> 01:19.080
 for peanut allergies can be profoundly shaped

01:19.080 --> 01:21.180
 by whether or not those kids were educated

01:21.180 --> 01:23.260
 about the side effects of the treatment,

01:23.260 --> 01:25.560
 such that if they learned that the side effects

01:25.560 --> 01:27.740
 were a by-product of a treatment that would help them,

01:27.740 --> 01:28.800
 and they learned a little bit

01:28.800 --> 01:30.400
 about why those side effects arose

01:30.400 --> 01:32.200
 and that the side effects might even help them

01:32.200 --> 01:34.480
 in route to overcoming their peanut allergy,

01:34.480 --> 01:36.320
 had an enormous impact

01:36.320 --> 01:38.160
 on how quickly they move through the treatment

01:38.160 --> 01:39.760
 and indeed how much they suffered

01:39.760 --> 01:42.640
 or in this case did not suffer from those side effects.

01:42.640 --> 01:45.620
 And that is but one example that you will learn about today

01:45.620 --> 01:48.160
 as we discuss what mindsets are,

01:48.160 --> 01:50.520
 the number of different mindsets that exist,

01:50.520 --> 01:52.280
 and how we can adopt mindsets

01:52.280 --> 01:55.080
 that make us more adaptive, more effective,

01:55.080 --> 01:56.640
 allow us to suffer less

01:56.640 --> 01:59.280
 and to perform better in all aspects of life.

01:59.280 --> 02:01.640
 I personally find the work of Dr. Alia Crum

02:01.640 --> 02:03.800
 to be among the most important work

02:03.800 --> 02:06.120
 being done in the fields of biology and psychology

02:06.120 --> 02:08.680
 and the interface of mind-body.

02:08.680 --> 02:11.060
 Everything that she's done up until now and published,

02:11.060 --> 02:13.180
 and indeed the work that she continues to do,

02:13.180 --> 02:15.520
 has shaped everything within my daily routines,

02:15.520 --> 02:18.440
 within my work routines, within my athletic routines.

02:18.440 --> 02:19.940
 And we probably shouldn't be surprised

02:19.940 --> 02:22.160
 by the fact that Dr. Crum works on all these things.

02:22.160 --> 02:24.320
 She was not only an incredibly accomplished

02:24.320 --> 02:25.960
 tenured research professor,

02:25.960 --> 02:27.840
 she's also a clinical psychologist,

02:27.840 --> 02:29.500
 and she was also a division one athlete

02:29.500 --> 02:32.220
 and an elite gymnast at one period in her life.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.160
 So she really walks the walk

02:34.160 --> 02:36.380
 in terms of understanding what mindsets are

02:36.380 --> 02:38.640
 and applying them in different aspects of life.

02:38.640 --> 02:40.860
 I'm sure you're going to learn a ton from this conversation

02:40.860 --> 02:45.200
 as did I, and come away with many, many actionable items

02:45.200 --> 02:47.560
 that you can apply in your own life.

02:47.560 --> 02:50.080
 In fact, as we march into today's conversation,

02:50.080 --> 02:51.940
 you might want to just put in the back of your mind

02:51.940 --> 02:55.600
 the question, what is my mindset about blank?

02:55.600 --> 02:56.940
 So for instance, ask yourself,

02:56.940 --> 02:58.480
 what is my mindset about stress?

02:58.480 --> 02:59.820
 What is my mindset about food?

02:59.820 --> 03:01.340
 What is my mindset about exercise?

03:01.340 --> 03:04.080
 What is my mindset about relationships of different kinds?

03:04.080 --> 03:06.980
 Because in doing that, you'll be in a great position

03:06.980 --> 03:09.160
 to extract the best of the information

03:09.160 --> 03:10.760
 that Dr. Crum presents,

03:10.760 --> 03:12.600
 and indeed to adapt those mindsets

03:12.600 --> 03:15.460
 in the way that is going to be most beneficial for you.

03:15.460 --> 03:18.080
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:18.080 --> 03:20.800
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:20.800 --> 03:22.760
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:22.760 --> 03:25.320
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:25.320 --> 03:27.880
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:27.880 --> 03:28.900
 In keeping with that theme,

03:28.900 --> 03:31.600
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.640
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.400
 Thesis makes custom nootropics that are ideal

03:36.400 --> 03:39.860
 for the particular brain states that you want to be in.

03:39.860 --> 03:42.160
 The term nootropic means smart drug,

03:42.160 --> 03:43.740
 and it is not a term that I like

03:43.740 --> 03:45.440
 because there is no such thing

03:45.440 --> 03:47.800
 as a universally useful smart drug.

03:47.800 --> 03:51.440
 The reason for that is that our brain can be creative,

03:51.440 --> 03:54.640
 we can be focused, we can be good at task switching,

03:54.640 --> 03:56.200
 and each of those different things,

03:56.200 --> 03:58.120
 creativity, focus, and task switching,

03:58.120 --> 03:59.340
 involves different neurochemicals

03:59.340 --> 04:00.920
 in different states of mind and body.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.200
 So the notion that there's one best nootropic

04:03.200 --> 04:04.560
 is just not accurate.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.760
 There's just no way that could possibly be.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.120
 Thesis understands this,

04:08.120 --> 04:10.680
 and for that reason, designed custom nootropics

04:10.680 --> 04:12.320
 that are designed to bring your brain and body

04:12.320 --> 04:13.720
 into the states that you want

04:13.720 --> 04:17.080
 and that are specifically designed to your neurochemistry.

04:17.080 --> 04:18.960
 They use only the highest quality ingredients,

04:18.960 --> 04:20.920
 many of which I've talked about before on the podcast,

04:20.920 --> 04:24.440
 things like DHA, ginkgo biloba, phosphatidylsterine,

04:24.440 --> 04:26.600
 alpha-GPC is one that I particularly like

04:26.600 --> 04:28.020
 and is in several of the formulations

04:28.020 --> 04:29.480
 that are customized for me.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.220
 However, ginkgo biloba,

04:31.220 --> 04:32.960
 which has a lot of research to support it

04:32.960 --> 04:35.000
 and is well tolerated by many people,

04:35.000 --> 04:36.040
 doesn't work well for me.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.000
 It actually gives me headaches.

04:37.000 --> 04:38.560
 So that one is not included

04:38.560 --> 04:40.040
 in any of the custom formulations

04:40.040 --> 04:43.120
 that Thesis has made particularly for me.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.080
 Thesis has this tremendous asset,

04:45.080 --> 04:46.440
 which is that they give you the ability

04:46.440 --> 04:49.040
 to try several different blends over the course of a month

04:49.040 --> 04:50.960
 and discover which nootropics work best

04:50.960 --> 04:53.780
 for your unique brain chemistry and genetics.

04:53.780 --> 04:55.180
 So the formulas that work for me

04:55.180 --> 04:57.840
 may not be the best ones for you and vice versa,

04:57.840 --> 04:59.040
 but in a short period of time,

04:59.040 --> 05:01.300
 you can dial in the exact nootropic formulas

05:01.300 --> 05:04.240
 for the states of mind and body that you want to be in.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.280
 I've been using Thesis for close to six months now,

05:06.280 --> 05:08.060
 and I can confidently say that their nootropics

05:08.060 --> 05:09.960
 have been a total game changer.

05:09.960 --> 05:11.640
 I love the motivation formula.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.060
 I also like the energy formula.

05:13.060 --> 05:15.400
 I use those for different things, it turns out,

05:15.400 --> 05:17.720
 but I love those and I use their logic formula

05:17.720 --> 05:20.560
 and their clarity formula that they've customized for me.

05:20.560 --> 05:22.280
 In addition to their personalization,

05:22.280 --> 05:24.000
 Thesis takes it a step further.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.340
 They'll offer you a free consultation with a brain coach

05:26.340 --> 05:28.600
 to help optimize your experience with the nootropics

05:28.600 --> 05:31.220
 and dial in the best formulas for you.

05:31.220 --> 05:33.200
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

05:33.200 --> 05:36.360
 go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

05:36.360 --> 05:37.880
 take their brief three minute quiz

05:37.880 --> 05:39.960
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

05:39.960 --> 05:41.400
 to try in your first month.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.580
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

05:48.120 --> 05:50.880
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.040
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:53.040 --> 05:55.320
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.400
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system

05:57.400 --> 05:59.880
 and I can tell you that our visual system has to contend

05:59.880 --> 06:01.920
 with a huge number of different challenges,

06:01.920 --> 06:03.600
 not the least of which is when we go

06:03.600 --> 06:06.620
 from a very bright sunny spot outside into the shade,

06:06.620 --> 06:08.140
 our visual system has to adapt

06:08.140 --> 06:10.600
 in order for us to continue to see clearly.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.920
 Many sunglasses out there just don't allow that adaptation

06:13.920 --> 06:15.980
 to occur in a seamless way.

06:15.980 --> 06:18.360
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed

06:18.360 --> 06:20.720
 with all of the biology of the visual system in mind

06:20.720 --> 06:22.880
 so that you always see things with crystal clarity

06:22.880 --> 06:24.880
 no matter what environment you're in.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.840
 They also have a terrific aesthetic.

06:26.840 --> 06:28.920
 They have many, many different styles to choose from.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.120
 So their eyeglasses can be worn to dinner

06:31.120 --> 06:32.580
 or out to lunch or to work.

06:32.580 --> 06:35.000
 Their sunglasses can be worn essentially anywhere.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.100
 They're very stylish and they were designed for performance.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.240
 They won't slip off your face if you get sweaty.

06:40.240 --> 06:42.760
 Indeed, you can wear them while running or while cycling.

06:42.760 --> 06:43.740
 They're really terrific.

06:43.740 --> 06:45.000
 They're really versatile.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.260

06:56.600 --> 06:59.520
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:59.520 --> 07:01.820
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

07:01.820 --> 07:04.380
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

07:04.380 --> 07:06.140
 to help you better meet your immediate

07:06.140 --> 07:08.000
 and long-term health goals.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.680
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

07:10.680 --> 07:12.840
 for the simple reason that many of the things

07:12.840 --> 07:14.900
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

07:14.900 --> 07:17.440
 can only be assessed from a quality blood test.

07:17.440 --> 07:20.080
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

07:20.080 --> 07:22.860
 you can also get a window into how your genes

07:22.860 --> 07:25.600
 are impacting your health in the short and long-term

07:25.600 --> 07:27.360
 and the various things that you should do

07:27.360 --> 07:30.040
 in order to adjust your health in the right direction.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.020
 And one of the major issues with a lot of blood tests

07:32.020 --> 07:34.240
 and DNA tests out there is you get numbers back

07:34.240 --> 07:36.620
 and you learn whether or not your lipids

07:36.620 --> 07:37.920
 or your hormones, et cetera,

07:37.920 --> 07:40.120
 are within the proper range or not.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.440
 But there aren't a lot of directives

07:41.440 --> 07:43.280
 about what to do with that information.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.640
 Inside Tracker makes all of that very easy.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.520
 They have a personalized dashboard

07:47.520 --> 07:48.840
 that allows you to, of course,

07:48.840 --> 07:51.080
 see the numbers that come back to you

07:51.080 --> 07:53.800
 and to make various changes in nutrition,

07:53.800 --> 07:55.740
 various changes in exercise,

07:55.740 --> 07:58.480
 various changes in all sorts of lifestyle factors

07:58.480 --> 08:00.440
 that can bring those numbers into range.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.480
 And so if you have a particular value

08:02.480 --> 08:05.080
 for a particular metabolic factor or hormone or so forth,

08:05.080 --> 08:06.900
 you click on that and it will actually bring up

08:06.900 --> 08:08.320
 the full menu of things that you can do

08:08.320 --> 08:09.840
 in order to adjust that factor

08:09.840 --> 08:11.260
 into the ranges that you like,

08:11.260 --> 08:14.140
 all based on quality, peer-reviewed research.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.480
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

08:15.480 --> 08:18.300

08:21.120 --> 08:23.440
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

08:23.440 --> 08:27.160
 And now my conversation with Dr. Alia Crum.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.680
 Great to have you here.

08:28.680 --> 08:29.600
 Great to be here.

08:29.600 --> 08:30.440
 Yeah.

08:30.440 --> 08:34.240
 For the record, it's Alia Crum, but you go by Ali, correct?

08:34.240 --> 08:35.200
 That is correct.

08:35.200 --> 08:36.520
 Dr. Ali Crum.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.360
 Or just Ali.

08:37.360 --> 08:38.600
 Okay, great.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.520
 Well, I've been looking forward

08:40.520 --> 08:42.840
 to talking to you for a long time.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.480
 Just to start off, you've talked a lot

08:45.480 --> 08:48.600
 and worked a lot on the science of mindsets.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.600
 Could you define for us what is a mindset

08:51.600 --> 08:54.040
 and what sort of purpose does it serve?

08:54.040 --> 08:54.960
 Of course, yeah.

08:54.960 --> 08:58.960
 Mindsets have been described or defined in a lot of ways.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.760
 We define mindsets as core beliefs

09:01.760 --> 09:05.600
 or assumptions that we have about a domain

09:05.600 --> 09:09.080
 or category of things that orient us

09:09.080 --> 09:12.400
 to a particular set of expectations,

09:12.400 --> 09:15.000
 explanations, and goals.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.520
 So that's kind of jargon-y.

09:17.960 --> 09:19.640
 I can distill it down for you.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.080
 So mindsets are an assumption that you make about a domain.

09:23.080 --> 09:26.680
 So take stress, for example, the nature of stress.

09:26.680 --> 09:30.160
 What's your sort of core belief about that?

09:30.160 --> 09:32.760
 And mindsets that we've studied about stress are,

09:32.760 --> 09:35.200
 do you view stress as enhancing, good for you,

09:35.200 --> 09:38.560
 or do you view it as debilitating and bad for you?

09:38.560 --> 09:42.000
 Those mindsets, those core beliefs orient our thinking.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.720
 They change what we expect will happen to us

09:44.720 --> 09:48.360
 when we're stressed, how we explain the occurrences

09:48.360 --> 09:50.600
 that happen or unfold when we're stressed,

09:50.600 --> 09:53.160
 and also change our motivation

09:53.160 --> 09:55.760
 for what we engage in when we're stressed.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.520
 So we have mindsets about many things,

09:57.520 --> 10:00.240
 mindsets about stress, mindsets about intelligence,

10:00.240 --> 10:02.280
 as Carol Dweck's work has shown,

10:02.280 --> 10:06.720
 mindsets about food, mindsets about medicine, you name it.

10:06.720 --> 10:09.000
 It's sort of distilling down those core assumptions

10:09.000 --> 10:12.520
 that really shape and orient our thinking and action.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.080
 I've heard you say before that mindsets simplify life

10:15.080 --> 10:17.600
 in some way by constraining the number of things

10:17.600 --> 10:18.920
 that we have to consider.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.960
 And it sounds to me like we can have mindsets

10:21.960 --> 10:23.840
 about many things, as you said.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.320
 What are some different mindsets?

10:25.320 --> 10:27.600
 I think many people are familiar with our colleague,

10:27.600 --> 10:30.200
 Carol Dweck's notion of growth mindset,

10:30.200 --> 10:32.520
 that if we're not proficient at something

10:32.520 --> 10:35.760
 that we should think about not being proficient yet,

10:35.760 --> 10:38.280
 that we are on some path to proficiency.

10:38.280 --> 10:41.760
 But what are some examples of mindsets

10:41.760 --> 10:43.840
 and how early do these get laid down

10:43.840 --> 10:45.760
 or do we learn them from our parents?

10:45.760 --> 10:49.320
 Maybe if you could just flesh it out a bit for us

10:49.320 --> 10:51.880
 in terms of what you've observed in your own science

10:51.880 --> 10:53.200
 or your own life even.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.920
 Yeah, sure, so I think it's important with Carol Dweck's

10:55.920 --> 10:57.520
 work, a lot of people kind of get focused

10:57.520 --> 11:00.160
 on growth motivation and all these things.

11:00.160 --> 11:04.400
 But her work really originated from thinking about

11:04.400 --> 11:07.560
 what she called as implicit theories or core beliefs

11:07.560 --> 11:11.440
 about the nature of intelligence or ability, right?

11:11.440 --> 11:15.960
 So do you believe that your baseline levels of intelligence

11:15.960 --> 11:19.680
 or your abilities are fixed, static, set

11:19.680 --> 11:21.280
 throughout the rest of your life?

11:21.280 --> 11:24.640
 Or do you believe that they can grow and change?

11:24.640 --> 11:29.640
 Now, those are oversimplified generalizations

11:29.640 --> 11:31.600
 about the nature of intelligence.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.640
 And the reality is, as it always is, complex

11:34.640 --> 11:36.880
 and it's a bit of both and it's all these things.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.640
 But as humans, we need these simplifying systems

11:39.640 --> 11:43.080
 to help us understand a complex reality.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.640
 So those assumptions that we jump to,

11:45.640 --> 11:50.000
 oh, intelligence is fixed or intelligence is malleable,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.640
 they help us to simplify this complex reality,

11:53.640 --> 11:57.280
 but they're not inconsequential, right?

11:57.280 --> 11:59.640
 They matter in shaping our motivation.

11:59.640 --> 12:02.160
 And as she has shown, if you have the mindset

12:02.160 --> 12:04.880
 that intelligence is malleable,

12:04.880 --> 12:08.360
 you're motivated to work harder to grow your intelligence.

12:08.360 --> 12:10.920
 If you have a setback and you're learning, you think,

12:10.920 --> 12:12.840
 okay, there's something there that I can grow

12:12.840 --> 12:14.360
 and learn and build from.

12:14.360 --> 12:17.240
 If you have the mindset that it's fixed,

12:17.240 --> 12:18.880
 why work harder at math

12:18.880 --> 12:20.560
 if you don't think you're good at it?

12:20.560 --> 12:23.520
 So in retrospect, it's pretty clear

12:23.520 --> 12:26.920
 how these mindsets can affect our motivation.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.200
 What our work has aimed to do is to expand

12:30.200 --> 12:35.200
 the range of mindsets that we are studying, focused on,

12:36.280 --> 12:38.640
 and also understand and expand the range

12:38.640 --> 12:40.400
 of effects that they have.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.920
 So by and large, we focused on mindsets

12:42.920 --> 12:46.080
 in the domain of health and health behaviors.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.400
 So I mentioned mindsets about stress.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.200
 We've also looked at mindsets about food and healthy eating.

12:52.200 --> 12:55.600
 So do you have the mindset that foods that are good for you,

12:55.600 --> 12:59.720
 healthy foods are disgusting and depriving?

12:59.720 --> 13:00.840
 Or do you have the mindset

13:00.840 --> 13:04.680
 that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious?

13:04.680 --> 13:07.280
 Now, you know, it could be a variety of different foods.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.200
 You might have different thoughts

13:08.200 --> 13:10.360
 about different healthy foods,

13:10.360 --> 13:14.600
 but generally people, at least in our culture in the West,

13:14.600 --> 13:17.680
 have this view that stress is debilitating,

13:17.680 --> 13:20.160
 healthy foods are disgusting and depriving.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.480
 And those mindsets, whether or not they're true or false,

13:23.480 --> 13:25.440
 right or wrong, they have an impact.

13:25.440 --> 13:26.440
 And they have an impact

13:26.440 --> 13:28.760
 not just through the motivational mechanisms

13:28.760 --> 13:30.440
 that Dweck and others have studied,

13:30.440 --> 13:32.600
 but as our lab has started to reveal,

13:32.600 --> 13:36.360
 they also shape physiological mechanisms

13:36.360 --> 13:41.320
 by changing what our bodies prioritize and prepare to do.

13:41.320 --> 13:43.680
 So those are just two examples, mindsets about stress,

13:43.680 --> 13:44.920
 mindsets about food.

13:44.920 --> 13:47.680
 We've looked at mindsets about exercise.

13:47.680 --> 13:50.440
 Do you feel like you're getting enough?

13:50.440 --> 13:52.960
 Or do you feel like you're getting an insufficient amount

13:52.960 --> 13:56.560
 to get the health benefits you're seeking?

13:56.560 --> 13:58.920
 Mindsets about illness.

13:58.920 --> 14:03.920
 Do you view cancer as an unmitigated catastrophe?

14:04.200 --> 14:06.440
 Or do you view cancer as manageable

14:06.440 --> 14:09.520
 or perhaps even an opportunity?

14:09.520 --> 14:12.480
 We've looked at mindsets about symptoms and side effects.

14:12.480 --> 14:15.600
 Do you view side effects as a sign

14:15.600 --> 14:18.080
 that the treatment is harmful?

14:18.080 --> 14:19.200
 Or do you view side effects

14:19.200 --> 14:21.480
 as a sign that the treatment is working?

14:21.480 --> 14:24.200
 Again, these are sort of core beliefs or assumptions

14:24.200 --> 14:26.960
 you have about these domains or categories,

14:26.960 --> 14:29.280
 but they matter because they're shaping,

14:29.280 --> 14:32.520
 they're synthesizing and simplifying the way we're thinking,

14:32.520 --> 14:34.960
 but they're also shaping what we're paying attention to,

14:34.960 --> 14:36.280
 what we're motivated to do,

14:36.280 --> 14:39.040
 and potentially even how our bodies respond.

14:39.040 --> 14:41.480
 Yeah, I'd love to talk about this notion

14:41.480 --> 14:45.200
 of mindset shaping, how our bodies respond.

14:45.200 --> 14:47.280
 And maybe as an example of this,

14:47.280 --> 14:50.520
 if you could share with us this now famous study

14:50.520 --> 14:54.320
 that you've done with a milkshake study,

14:54.320 --> 14:58.000
 if you wouldn't mind sharing the major contours

14:58.000 --> 14:59.240
 of that study and the results,

14:59.240 --> 15:01.320
 because I think they're extremely impressive

15:01.320 --> 15:02.800
 and they really speak to this interplay

15:02.800 --> 15:04.760
 between mindset and physiology.

15:04.760 --> 15:05.600
 Certainly, yeah.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.760
 This was a study that I ran as a graduate student at Yale.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.160
 Yale University.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.320
 I was working with Kelly Brownell and Peter Salovey.

15:13.320 --> 15:14.800
 Peter Salovey had done a lot of work

15:14.800 --> 15:17.480
 on really coining the term emotional intelligence,

15:17.480 --> 15:18.320
 studying that.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.160
 He's now the president of Yale, right?

15:19.160 --> 15:20.000
 He's now the president of Yale, yes.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.080
 So he's done well.

15:21.080 --> 15:22.280
 He's done well for himself

15:22.280 --> 15:24.720
 and for the university and society.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.120
 And Kelly Brownell, who was doing a lot of research

15:27.120 --> 15:30.560
 on food and obesity, and I had come in

15:30.560 --> 15:32.520
 doing some previous work on mindsets

15:32.520 --> 15:35.320
 about exercise and placebo effects and exercise

15:35.320 --> 15:39.480
 and was in this sort of food domain and this emotions

15:39.480 --> 15:42.660
 and food domain, and it really occurred to me

15:42.660 --> 15:44.560
 that there was a very simple question

15:44.560 --> 15:46.120
 that hadn't been probed yet.

15:46.120 --> 15:50.560
 And that was, do our beliefs about what we're eating

15:50.560 --> 15:54.760
 change our body's physiological response to that food,

15:54.760 --> 15:59.160
 holding constant the objective nutrients of that thing?

15:59.160 --> 16:02.400
 So that question might sound outrageous at first,

16:02.400 --> 16:04.900
 but it was, it's really not outrageous

16:04.900 --> 16:06.560
 if you're coming from a place of having

16:06.560 --> 16:09.680
 studied in depth placebo effects.

16:09.680 --> 16:12.740
 Placebo effects are this, in medicine at least,

16:12.740 --> 16:15.800
 are this sort of robust demonstration

16:15.800 --> 16:20.260
 in which simply taking a sugar pill, taking nothing,

16:20.260 --> 16:22.840
 under the impression that it's a real medication

16:22.840 --> 16:25.080
 that might relieve your asthma,

16:25.080 --> 16:28.360
 reduce your blood pressure, boost your immune system,

16:28.360 --> 16:31.440
 can lead to those physiological effects

16:31.440 --> 16:33.640
 even though there's no objective nutrients.

16:33.640 --> 16:36.240
 And we have more evidence on placebo effects

16:36.240 --> 16:38.080
 than we have for any other drug

16:38.080 --> 16:40.880
 because of the clinical trial process

16:40.880 --> 16:45.760
 in which all new drugs and medications are required

16:45.760 --> 16:47.880
 to outperform a placebo effect.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.320
 So we have a lot of data on the placebo effect.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.840
 Now, you know, we can get nuance there.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.640
 We don't have a lot of data comparing the placebo effect

16:56.640 --> 16:59.480
 to doing nothing, which is important

16:59.480 --> 17:02.840
 for distilling mindset effects or belief effects

17:02.840 --> 17:06.140
 from sort of natural occurring changes in the body.

17:06.140 --> 17:07.640
 But anyways, going back to this question,

17:07.640 --> 17:10.040
 it was like, all right, we've moved from, you know,

17:10.040 --> 17:12.920
 medications solving our health crises

17:12.920 --> 17:17.000
 to behavioral medicine solving our health crises,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.480
 increase people's exercise, get them to eat better.

17:20.480 --> 17:22.680
 To what degree are these things influenced

17:22.680 --> 17:25.160
 by our mindsets or beliefs about them?

17:25.160 --> 17:30.160
 So to test this question, we ran a seemingly simple study.

17:30.160 --> 17:33.180
 This was done at the Yale Center for Clinical

17:33.180 --> 17:35.060
 and Translational Research.

17:35.060 --> 17:39.380
 And we brought people into our lab under the impression

17:39.380 --> 17:42.180
 that we were designing different milkshakes

17:42.180 --> 17:45.500
 with vastly different metabolic concentrations,

17:45.500 --> 17:48.300
 nutrient concentrations that were designed

17:48.300 --> 17:49.820
 to meet different metabolic needs

17:49.820 --> 17:51.500
 of the patrons of the hospital, right?

17:51.500 --> 17:52.620
 So you're gonna come in,

17:52.620 --> 17:54.260
 you're gonna taste these milkshakes,

17:54.260 --> 17:55.820
 and we're gonna measure your body's

17:55.820 --> 17:58.140
 physiological response to them.

17:58.140 --> 18:00.260
 This was a within subjects design.

18:00.260 --> 18:03.740
 So it was the same people consuming

18:03.740 --> 18:06.260
 two different milkshakes, two different time points

18:06.260 --> 18:07.940
 separated by a week.

18:07.940 --> 18:09.700
 And at one time point, they were told

18:09.700 --> 18:12.380
 that they were consuming this really high fat,

18:12.380 --> 18:15.020
 high caloric, indulgent milkshake.

18:15.020 --> 18:19.820
 It was like 620 calorie, super high fat and sugar.

18:19.820 --> 18:22.620
 The other time point, they were told that it was a low fat,

18:22.620 --> 18:25.980
 low calorie, sensible sort of diet shake.

18:25.980 --> 18:28.060
 In reality, it was the exact same shake.

18:28.060 --> 18:29.100
 It was right in the middle.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.860
 It was like 300 calories,

18:30.860 --> 18:33.020
 moderate amount of fats and sugars.

18:33.020 --> 18:36.300
 And we were measuring their body's gut peptide response

18:36.300 --> 18:37.120
 to this shake.

18:37.120 --> 18:40.100
 And in particular, we were looking at the hormone ghrelin.

18:40.100 --> 18:43.340
 So as you know, ghrelin, hunger,

18:43.340 --> 18:46.140
 medical experts call it the hunger hormone,

18:46.140 --> 18:50.220
 rises in ghrelin, signal, seek out food.

18:50.220 --> 18:52.620
 And then theoretically, in proportion

18:52.620 --> 18:54.560
 to the amount of calories you consume,

18:54.560 --> 18:57.220
 ghrelin levels drop, signaling to the brain,

18:57.220 --> 18:59.900
 okay, you don't need to eat so much anymore,

18:59.900 --> 19:02.700
 you can stop eating, and also revving up the metabolism

19:02.700 --> 19:05.780
 to burn the nutrients that were just ingested.

19:05.780 --> 19:07.740
 What we found in this study was that

19:07.740 --> 19:10.460
 when people thought they were consuming

19:10.460 --> 19:14.180
 the high fat, high calorie, indulgent milkshake,

19:14.180 --> 19:17.620
 in response to the shake, their ghrelin levels dropped

19:17.620 --> 19:20.880
 at a threefold rate stronger than when they thought

19:20.880 --> 19:23.660
 they were consuming the sensible shake.

19:23.660 --> 19:26.460
 So essentially, their bodies responded

19:26.460 --> 19:29.340
 as if they had consumed more food,

19:29.340 --> 19:33.480
 even though it was the exact same shake at both time points.

19:33.480 --> 19:38.040
 So this was really interesting and important

19:38.040 --> 19:39.220
 for two reasons, really.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.700
 One was that it was, to my knowledge,

19:41.700 --> 19:44.620
 one of the first studies to show any effects

19:44.620 --> 19:47.360
 of just believing that you're eating something different

19:47.360 --> 19:48.780
 on your physiology.

19:48.780 --> 19:51.620
 Lots of studies have shown that believing

19:51.620 --> 19:54.220
 you're eating different things changes your taste,

19:54.220 --> 19:57.140
 you know, and even your satisfaction and fullness after,

19:57.140 --> 19:59.020
 but this shows that it has a metabolic

19:59.020 --> 20:01.380
 or a physiological component.

20:01.380 --> 20:04.620
 But the second piece was really important as well,

20:04.620 --> 20:07.420
 and especially for me, this was one study

20:07.420 --> 20:09.500
 that really transformed the way I think

20:09.500 --> 20:13.260
 about how I approach eating, and that was the manner

20:13.260 --> 20:16.620
 in which it affected our physiology

20:16.620 --> 20:18.580
 was somewhat counterintuitive.

20:18.580 --> 20:22.620
 So I had gone in thinking the better mindset to be in

20:22.620 --> 20:24.900
 when you eat is that you're eating healthy, right?

20:24.900 --> 20:26.220
 Like, you know, it just makes sense.

20:26.220 --> 20:27.780
 Like, placebo effects, think you're healthy,

20:27.780 --> 20:28.620
 you'll be healthy, you know?

20:28.620 --> 20:32.280
 But that was a far too simplistic way of thinking about it,

20:32.280 --> 20:34.640
 and in fact, it was the exact opposite,

20:34.640 --> 20:37.260
 because thinking that they were eating

20:37.260 --> 20:40.980
 when these participants thought they were eating sensibly,

20:40.980 --> 20:45.860
 their bodies left them still feeling physiologically hungry,

20:45.860 --> 20:48.980
 right, not satiated, which could potentially

20:48.980 --> 20:52.740
 be corresponding to slower metabolism and so forth.

20:52.740 --> 20:55.200
 So if you're in the interest of maintaining

20:55.200 --> 20:58.260
 or losing weight, what's the best mindset to be in?

20:58.260 --> 21:01.040
 It's to be in a mindset that you're eating indulgently,

21:01.040 --> 21:04.500
 that you're having enough food, that you're getting enough.

21:04.500 --> 21:06.780
 And at least in that study, we showed that

21:06.780 --> 21:10.620
 has a more adaptive effect on ghrelin responses.

21:10.620 --> 21:13.460
 So interesting, and especially interesting to me

21:13.460 --> 21:17.460
 as a neuroscientist who has worked on aspects

21:17.460 --> 21:19.020
 of the nervous system that are involved

21:19.020 --> 21:21.420
 in conscious perception, like vision and, you know,

21:21.420 --> 21:23.900
 motion and color perception and so forth,

21:23.900 --> 21:27.900
 but also our lab has worked and is increasingly working

21:27.900 --> 21:29.900
 on autonomic functions that are below

21:29.900 --> 21:31.220
 our conscious detection.

21:31.220 --> 21:35.980
 In this case, a lie about how much something

21:36.940 --> 21:39.880
 these milkshakes contain affected a subconscious process,

21:39.880 --> 21:42.580
 because I have to imagine that the ghrelin pathway

21:42.580 --> 21:44.620
 is not one that I can decide, oh, you know,

21:44.620 --> 21:46.220
 this particular piece of chocolate

21:46.220 --> 21:47.980
 is going to really reduce my ghrelin

21:47.980 --> 21:51.020
 because it's very nutrient rich, as opposed to one,

21:51.020 --> 21:52.540
 if you told me that a different piece of chocolate,

21:52.540 --> 21:56.140
 for instance, is low calorie or sugar-free chocolate

21:56.140 --> 21:57.140
 or something of that sort.

21:57.140 --> 22:01.740
 The ghrelin pathway, however, it seems based on your data,

22:01.740 --> 22:06.340
 that the ghrelin pathway is susceptible to thoughts,

22:06.340 --> 22:07.700
 which is incredible.

22:07.700 --> 22:09.860
 But then again, there must be crossover

22:09.860 --> 22:13.060
 between conscious thought and these subconscious

22:13.060 --> 22:14.820
 or kind of autonomic pathways.

22:14.820 --> 22:16.520
 So it's really remarkable.

22:17.420 --> 22:21.140
 It raises a question that I just have to ask

22:21.140 --> 22:25.060
 because increasingly, so I'm involved in, you know,

22:25.060 --> 22:27.100
 online discussions and, you know, social media.

22:27.100 --> 22:30.380
 And one of the most barbed wire topics out there,

22:30.380 --> 22:31.980
 and that's being generous,

22:31.980 --> 22:35.020
 is this topic of which diet or nutrients are best.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.740
 You've got people who are strictly plant-based,

22:38.740 --> 22:40.420
 you've got people who are omnivores,

22:40.420 --> 22:41.940
 you've got people who are carnivores,

22:41.940 --> 22:44.740
 you have every variation, you have intermittent fasting,

22:44.740 --> 22:46.300
 also called time-restricted feeding.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.540
 And it seems like once a group kind of plugs into

22:50.600 --> 22:53.500
 a particular mode of eating that they feel works for them,

22:53.500 --> 22:55.780
 for whatever reason, energy-wise, mentally,

22:55.780 --> 22:57.340
 maybe they're looking at their blood profiles,

22:57.340 --> 22:58.700
 maybe they're not,

22:58.700 --> 23:02.940
 but once they feel that it sort of, it works for them,

23:02.940 --> 23:05.940
 each camp seems to tout all the health benefits

23:05.940 --> 23:07.340
 and how great they feel.

23:07.340 --> 23:11.260
 Could it be that mindset effects are involved there,

23:11.260 --> 23:13.940
 that people are finding the nutritional program

23:13.940 --> 23:17.660
 that they feel brings them the most enrichment of life,

23:17.660 --> 23:19.380
 but also nutrients,

23:19.380 --> 23:21.500
 and that their health really is shifting

23:21.500 --> 23:22.400
 in a positive direction,

23:22.400 --> 23:24.740
 but not necessarily because of the food constituents,

23:24.740 --> 23:27.020
 but because of the community and the ideas

23:27.020 --> 23:28.020
 and the reinforcement.

23:28.020 --> 23:30.420
 Yeah, and the belief that this is the right way

23:30.420 --> 23:31.900
 of doing something.

23:31.900 --> 23:36.900
 I think 100%, 100% it has something to contribute.

23:37.180 --> 23:38.380
 You know, I don't want to,

23:38.380 --> 23:40.180
 I'm not going to weigh in on the debate.

23:40.180 --> 23:43.500
 What I will most certainly weigh in on

23:43.500 --> 23:46.540
 is the notion that,

23:46.540 --> 23:48.660
 look, going back to the placebo effect, right,

23:48.660 --> 23:51.820
 we have a outdated understanding of what that is,

23:51.820 --> 23:54.420
 which is based on this randomized control trial.

23:54.420 --> 23:57.300
 You compare a drug to a placebo.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.380
 If the drug works better than the placebo,

23:59.380 --> 24:01.340
 you say great, the drug works.

24:01.340 --> 24:03.380
 If the drug doesn't outperform the placebo,

24:03.380 --> 24:05.340
 you say the drug doesn't work.

24:05.340 --> 24:07.100
 That's really oversimplified.

24:07.100 --> 24:09.820
 It's a good test for the specific efficacy of the drug.

24:09.820 --> 24:12.400
 It's not a good test for understanding

24:12.400 --> 24:15.020
 the total impact of that drug.

24:15.020 --> 24:17.300
 Because in the reality of things,

24:17.300 --> 24:20.300
 if a drug outperforms a placebo,

24:20.300 --> 24:22.940
 then you start prescribing it,

24:22.940 --> 24:27.180
 but the reality is that the total effect of that drug

24:27.180 --> 24:32.180
 is a combined product of the specific chemical attributes

24:32.700 --> 24:36.580
 of that drug and whatever's going on in the placebo effect,

24:36.580 --> 24:39.140
 which is, at least from our perspective,

24:39.140 --> 24:42.220
 it's beliefs, it's social context,

24:42.220 --> 24:44.220
 and it's your body's natural ability

24:44.220 --> 24:46.040
 to respond to something.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.940
 So that's in the placebo effect example.

24:48.940 --> 24:53.180
 The same is true for everything we do or consume.

24:53.180 --> 24:56.380
 So when it comes to what diet you're eating,

24:57.660 --> 24:58.740
 both are true.

24:58.740 --> 25:01.380
 It does matter what it is,

25:01.380 --> 25:05.380
 and it matters what you think about that diet

25:05.380 --> 25:08.540
 and what others around you in our culture

25:08.540 --> 25:09.620
 think about that diet,

25:09.620 --> 25:13.420
 because those social contexts inform our mindsets.

25:13.420 --> 25:17.580
 Our mindsets interact with our physiology

25:17.580 --> 25:20.920
 in ways that produce outcomes that are really important.

25:20.920 --> 25:24.100
 So let's not get dualistic and say,

25:24.100 --> 25:26.440
 it's either all in the mind or not in the mind.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.260
 Let's also not be unnecessarily combative

25:29.260 --> 25:31.280
 and say, oh, it should be all plant-based

25:31.280 --> 25:33.660
 or keto or whatever.

25:34.540 --> 25:36.780
 All of those things are a combined product

25:36.780 --> 25:38.660
 of what you're actually doing

25:38.660 --> 25:40.380
 and what you're thinking about.

25:40.380 --> 25:42.140
 If you believe in it, if you don't,

25:42.140 --> 25:44.980
 if you're skeptical or in some cases,

25:44.980 --> 25:47.300
 you think you should be eating a certain way

25:47.300 --> 25:49.620
 and then you don't live up to that,

25:49.620 --> 25:52.260
 it might have an adverse effect

25:52.260 --> 25:55.940
 because of the stress and the anxiety associated with that.

25:55.940 --> 25:57.620
 Very interesting.

25:57.620 --> 26:00.100
 Along the lines of belief effects,

26:00.100 --> 26:02.820
 can we call these belief effects or mindsets?

26:02.820 --> 26:06.220
 Is there a difference between these,

26:06.220 --> 26:07.660
 what I'm calling belief effects,

26:07.660 --> 26:09.540
 and placebo effects?

26:09.540 --> 26:11.460
 I mean, are placebo effects distinctly different

26:11.460 --> 26:14.620
 from mindset effects or are they more or less the same?

26:14.620 --> 26:15.460
 They're related.

26:15.460 --> 26:20.340
 So I think placebo effects maybe should be reserved

26:20.340 --> 26:24.060
 for the conditions in which you're actually taking a placebo

26:24.060 --> 26:27.260
 which is an inactive substance.

26:27.260 --> 26:31.780
 When you get out of that sort of placebo versus drug realm

26:31.780 --> 26:35.220
 and you start looking at placebo effects,

26:35.220 --> 26:38.740
 I use quotes with my hands here, in behavioral health,

26:38.740 --> 26:40.700
 the term kind of becomes confusing

26:40.700 --> 26:43.100
 because you're not, you know, in the milkshake study,

26:43.100 --> 26:45.860
 we didn't give people a placebo milkshake, right?

26:45.860 --> 26:48.340
 We just changed what they believed about it.

26:48.340 --> 26:52.220
 So how I like to think about it is that placebo effects

26:52.220 --> 26:54.260
 as they're traditionally construed

26:54.260 --> 26:55.580
 are made up of three things.

26:55.580 --> 26:59.540
 It's the social context, mindsets or beliefs,

26:59.540 --> 27:02.900
 and the natural physiological processes

27:02.900 --> 27:06.540
 in the brain and body that can produce the outcomes.

27:06.540 --> 27:10.820
 And so we could just call them belief effects

27:10.820 --> 27:12.740
 because the beliefs are triggering

27:12.740 --> 27:14.700
 the physiological processes

27:14.700 --> 27:18.460
 and the beliefs are shaped by the social context.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.300
 Does that make sense?

27:19.300 --> 27:20.260
 It makes sense.

27:20.260 --> 27:22.220
 Yeah, there was a paper a year or two ago

27:22.220 --> 27:25.100
 published in Science Magazine

27:25.100 --> 27:28.940
 about brain regions involved in psychogenic fever

27:28.940 --> 27:32.060
 that if people, or you can actually do this

27:32.060 --> 27:33.660
 in animal models too, think that they are sick,

27:33.660 --> 27:36.620
 you get a genuine one to three degree increase

27:36.620 --> 27:37.620
 in body temperature,

27:37.620 --> 27:39.260
 one to three degrees Fahrenheit increase

27:39.260 --> 27:41.700
 in body temperature, which was pretty impressive.

27:41.700 --> 27:43.660
 And I guess it plays into, you know,

27:43.660 --> 27:44.980
 symptomology generally.

27:44.980 --> 27:47.660
 So I'm a believer in belief effects.

27:47.660 --> 27:50.500
 Well, it's also, and I would just say that, you know,

27:50.500 --> 27:52.660
 the term that we use in our field

27:52.660 --> 27:54.540
 is nocebo effect for that,

27:54.540 --> 27:58.540
 which is sort of the placebo's ugly step-sister, you know,

27:58.540 --> 28:02.220
 it's when negative beliefs cause negative consequences.

28:02.220 --> 28:05.300
 So you are told you will have, you know,

28:05.300 --> 28:07.260
 it's very well demonstrated

28:07.260 --> 28:09.880
 that when people are told about certain side effects,

28:09.880 --> 28:14.340
 they're far more likely to experience those side effects

28:14.340 --> 28:17.840
 when people think that they're sick or going to get sick,

28:17.840 --> 28:19.780
 sometimes that can create, you know,

28:19.780 --> 28:22.220
 the physiological symptoms.

28:22.220 --> 28:25.620
 And, you know, there's, you know, various debates

28:25.620 --> 28:28.300
 that it's not only that physiology changes,

28:28.300 --> 28:31.120
 it's also that your attention changes.

28:31.120 --> 28:35.220
 So we're experiencing things like fatigue and headache

28:35.220 --> 28:37.980
 and upset stomach all the time.

28:37.980 --> 28:40.380
 And then when you take a drug and somebody says,

28:40.380 --> 28:42.660
 you're going to feel fatigue and headache,

28:42.660 --> 28:45.280
 you start noticing that you're tired and have headaches

28:45.280 --> 28:46.500
 and attribute it to the drug.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.580
 So some of the mechanisms are attention

28:49.580 --> 28:53.200
 and some of them are real changes in physiology.

28:53.200 --> 28:58.200
 I'd love for you to tell us about the hotel workers study.

28:58.760 --> 28:59.600
 Yeah, sure.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.440
 I know you get asked these questions all the time,

29:01.440 --> 29:04.880
 but I find these, just these results also amazing.

29:04.880 --> 29:08.360
 Yeah, no, I think that this is a really good example

29:08.360 --> 29:11.800
 of this phenomenon, right?

29:11.800 --> 29:14.560
 That the total effect of anything is a combined product

29:14.560 --> 29:16.960
 of what you're doing and what you think about

29:16.960 --> 29:18.200
 what you're doing.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.780
 So this was a study that I ran with Ellen Langer way back

29:21.780 --> 29:24.760
 when I was an undergrad, actually, we started this study.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.540
 Ellen Langer's a professor of psychology at Harvard

29:27.540 --> 29:30.280
 and she's done a lot of really fascinating work

29:30.280 --> 29:33.840
 on her flavor of mindfulness, which is distinct

29:33.840 --> 29:38.840
 from a more Eastern, Buddhist sort of mindfulness-based

29:40.340 --> 29:41.300
 work.

29:41.300 --> 29:46.300
 And she actually was the one who said to me originally,

29:47.000 --> 29:49.800
 I was an athlete at the time, I was a ice hockey player

29:49.800 --> 29:53.680
 and I was training constantly and one day,

29:53.680 --> 29:55.120
 I'll never forget it, she said, you know,

29:55.120 --> 29:59.220
 you know the benefit of exercise is just a placebo, right?

29:59.220 --> 30:00.640
 And I was like, well, that's outrageous.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.380
 Ellen's known for saying very provocative,

30:04.380 --> 30:06.560
 but also very wise things.

30:06.560 --> 30:09.360
 And that statement really got me thinking about that.

30:09.360 --> 30:12.920
 So we designed this study together and that was to look at,

30:12.920 --> 30:15.860
 you know, how would you study if exercise,

30:15.860 --> 30:17.680
 the benefits of exercise were a placebo,

30:17.680 --> 30:19.160
 how would you even test that?

30:19.160 --> 30:20.880
 Because, you know, what does it mean

30:20.880 --> 30:22.560
 to give a placebo exercise?

30:22.560 --> 30:23.960
 So we sort of flipped it on its head

30:23.960 --> 30:26.780
 and we found a group of people who were getting

30:26.780 --> 30:30.200
 a lot of exercise, but weren't aware of it,

30:30.200 --> 30:31.100
 that they were, right?

30:31.100 --> 30:34.760
 So this, we settled on a group of hotel housekeepers.

30:34.760 --> 30:38.040
 So these were women working in hotels

30:38.040 --> 30:41.680
 who were on their feet all day long, pushing carts,

30:41.680 --> 30:45.440
 changing linens, climbing stairs, you know,

30:45.440 --> 30:47.880
 cleaning bathrooms, vacuuming.

30:47.880 --> 30:50.040
 It was clear that they were getting above and beyond

30:50.040 --> 30:53.100
 at least the surgeon general's requirements at that time,

30:53.100 --> 30:55.560
 which were to accumulate 30 minutes

30:55.560 --> 30:57.780
 of moderate physical activity per day.

30:58.880 --> 31:00.720
 But what was interesting was when we went in

31:00.720 --> 31:02.520
 and surveyed them and asked them,

31:02.520 --> 31:05.340
 hey, how much exercise do you think you're getting?

31:05.340 --> 31:09.920
 A third of them said zero, like I don't get any exercise.

31:09.920 --> 31:12.360
 And the average response was like a three

31:12.360 --> 31:14.240
 on a scale of zero to 10.

31:14.240 --> 31:18.440
 So it's clear that even though these women were active,

31:18.440 --> 31:20.200
 they didn't have that mindset, right?

31:20.200 --> 31:23.720
 They had the mindset that their work was just work,

31:23.720 --> 31:26.920
 hard, maybe thankless work that led them to feel tired

31:26.920 --> 31:30.320
 and in pain at the end of the day,

31:30.320 --> 31:31.920
 but not that it was good for them,

31:31.920 --> 31:33.600
 that it was good exercise.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.280
 So what we did was we took these women

31:35.280 --> 31:37.520
 and we randomized them into two groups

31:37.520 --> 31:42.520
 and we told half of them that their work was good exercise.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.580
 In this case, it was true factual information.

31:45.580 --> 31:48.340
 We oriented them to the surgeon general's guidelines.

31:48.340 --> 31:49.900
 We oriented them to the benefits

31:49.900 --> 31:51.760
 that they should be receiving.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.100
 And then we had measured them previously

31:54.100 --> 31:57.000
 on their physiological metrics like weight

31:57.000 --> 32:00.060
 and body fat and blood pressure.

32:00.060 --> 32:02.960
 And we came back four weeks later and we tested them again.

32:02.960 --> 32:05.120
 And what we found was that these women,

32:05.120 --> 32:08.640
 even though they hadn't changed anything in their behavior,

32:08.640 --> 32:10.360
 at least that was detectable to us,

32:10.360 --> 32:12.560
 they didn't work more rooms,

32:12.560 --> 32:15.440
 they didn't start doing pull-ups or push-ups

32:15.440 --> 32:18.300
 in between cleaning hotel rooms as far as I'm concerned.

32:18.300 --> 32:20.660
 They didn't report any changes in their diet,

32:21.560 --> 32:23.760
 but they had benefits to their health.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.120
 So they lost weight,

32:25.120 --> 32:27.980
 they decreased their systolic blood pressure

32:27.980 --> 32:30.120
 by about 10 points on average.

32:30.120 --> 32:33.960
 And they started feeling better about themselves,

32:33.960 --> 32:37.400
 their bodies and their work, not surprisingly.

32:37.400 --> 32:42.400
 That's amazing, how should we conceptualize that result

32:42.440 --> 32:45.680
 in light of all of our efforts

32:45.680 --> 32:47.880
 to get more out of exercise, right?

32:47.880 --> 32:50.000
 Because earlier you mentioned it from the milkshake study

32:50.000 --> 32:52.840
 and our perceptions about nutrient density,

32:52.840 --> 32:56.020
 that it's a little bit, the right message

32:56.020 --> 32:57.760
 that actually a little bit counterintuitive,

32:57.760 --> 33:01.600
 that if you think, oh, this is very low calorie,

33:01.600 --> 33:04.680
 nutrient sparse, then it's good for me

33:04.680 --> 33:06.360
 in the context of losing weight, for instance.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.600
 But it turns out the opposite is true

33:07.600 --> 33:11.600
 because as you told us, the body responds differently

33:11.600 --> 33:13.360
 when you think something is nutrient dense

33:13.360 --> 33:15.080
 and can actually suppress hunger more.

33:15.080 --> 33:18.360
 So in light of this result, if I were to say,

33:18.360 --> 33:22.920
 okay, my current understanding of the literature

33:22.920 --> 33:26.120
 is that getting somewhere between 150 and 180 minutes

33:26.120 --> 33:27.780
 per week of cardiovascular exercise

33:27.780 --> 33:30.040
 is probably a good idea for most people.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.700
 If I tell myself that it's not just a good idea,

33:32.700 --> 33:34.100
 but that it's extremely effective

33:34.100 --> 33:35.640
 in lowering my blood pressure

33:35.640 --> 33:38.920
 and maintaining healthy weight, et cetera, et cetera,

33:38.920 --> 33:39.880
 according to these results,

33:39.880 --> 33:42.440
 it will have an enhanced effect on those metrics.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.260
 Is that right?

33:43.260 --> 33:44.100
 Definitely.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.920
 So this is a really important point

33:45.920 --> 33:49.960
 because what this reveals is that we have to be

33:49.960 --> 33:54.960
 more thoughtful in how we go about motivating people

33:55.040 --> 33:58.380
 to exercise or teaching people about the benefits.

33:58.380 --> 34:02.720
 Our current approach is just to basically tell people

34:02.720 --> 34:05.280
 writ large, you know, here's what you need to get.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.920
 Here's what you need to get good for, you know,

34:06.920 --> 34:09.480
 to get enough benefits to receive the,

34:09.480 --> 34:12.000
 enough exercise to receive the health benefits.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.400
 The problem with that approach is that

34:14.400 --> 34:18.700
 most people aren't meeting those benefits yet

34:18.700 --> 34:21.240
 or aren't meeting those requirements yet.

34:21.240 --> 34:25.440
 And the risk with that is that,

34:26.400 --> 34:29.120
 well, the intention with that is to motivate them

34:29.120 --> 34:31.000
 because, you know, public health officials think,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.240
 well, if I just tell people you need to get more exercise

34:33.240 --> 34:35.100
 because it's good for you, they'll do it.

34:35.100 --> 34:36.760
 We know now that that doesn't work,

34:36.760 --> 34:39.560
 that these guidelines are not motivational.

34:39.560 --> 34:40.800
 They don't change our behavior.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.600
 And what our work adds to that is that

34:43.600 --> 34:45.320
 not only is it not motivational,

34:45.320 --> 34:50.320
 it also creates potentially a mindset that, you know,

34:50.520 --> 34:53.680
 makes people worse off than they were

34:53.680 --> 34:55.720
 without knowing about the guidelines.

34:55.720 --> 34:57.420
 So again, it's tricky.

34:57.420 --> 35:00.600
 I'm not saying that mindset is everything.

35:00.600 --> 35:04.900
 Certainly exercise is good for us and use is helpful for us.

35:04.900 --> 35:07.800
 It's one of the things we have the best data on.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.020
 So I'm not saying, oh, exercise is all a placebo.

35:11.020 --> 35:14.860
 What I am saying is that we need to be more mindful about

35:14.860 --> 35:17.080
 how do we motivate people to exercise,

35:17.080 --> 35:19.680
 but how do we help people to actually reap the benefits

35:19.680 --> 35:22.880
 of the exercise they are already doing?

35:22.880 --> 35:26.520
 Now, Octavia Zart, who was a grad student in my lab,

35:26.520 --> 35:30.780
 ran a number of interesting studies along these lines.

35:30.780 --> 35:33.160
 One in which she looked at three

35:33.160 --> 35:36.100
 nationally representative data sets,

35:36.100 --> 35:38.660
 which had this interesting question in them,

35:38.660 --> 35:43.600
 which was how much exercise do you get relative to others?

35:43.600 --> 35:47.740
 Do you get about the same, a little more, a lot more?

35:47.740 --> 35:49.860
 Do you get a little less or a lot less, right?

35:49.860 --> 35:52.040
 So, you know, the audience, your listeners,

35:52.040 --> 35:53.800
 you could all answer this.

35:53.800 --> 35:55.720
 And then in these data sets,

35:55.720 --> 35:57.560
 what she did was she had, you know,

35:57.560 --> 36:00.000
 pulled from data that tracked death rates

36:00.000 --> 36:02.120
 over the next 21 years.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.440
 And a couple interesting things revealed themselves.

36:05.440 --> 36:09.120
 One was that the correlations between these perceptions

36:09.120 --> 36:11.160
 of exercise relative to others

36:11.160 --> 36:13.840
 and people's actual exercise is measured

36:13.840 --> 36:18.080
 through accelerometer data, as well as more rigorous,

36:18.080 --> 36:21.420
 sort of, what did you do today kind of data.

36:21.420 --> 36:24.000
 Those don't correlate much at all.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.060
 People lie.

36:25.060 --> 36:27.040
 Well, people lie, but also- Or misperceive.

36:27.040 --> 36:29.360
 They misperceive and, or, you know,

36:29.360 --> 36:31.040
 who's to say it's misperceiving?

36:31.040 --> 36:32.960
 There's just, everything's relative, right?

36:32.960 --> 36:37.100
 If you're, I used to do triathlons very seriously.

36:37.100 --> 36:38.320
 So if you were to ask me now,

36:38.320 --> 36:40.880
 I feel like I'm totally inactive, right?

36:40.880 --> 36:42.880
 Because I'm not doing anything near what I used to.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.000
 And if that's my focus set, right,

36:46.000 --> 36:49.000
 I feel like I'm not exercising much.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.760
 But if I think about, you know,

36:50.760 --> 36:53.280
 compared to other people, given what I know about,

36:53.280 --> 36:56.680
 you know, national representative statistics,

36:56.680 --> 36:59.680
 then I could feel like, oh, I'm getting a lot, right?

36:59.680 --> 37:04.680
 So you can see how these perceptions are decoupled

37:04.960 --> 37:07.680
 from objective reality.

37:07.680 --> 37:10.880
 And what we found in these studies is that

37:10.880 --> 37:14.200
 that one question mattered,

37:14.200 --> 37:18.040
 in some cases more than objective activity,

37:18.040 --> 37:21.020
 but in all cases, controlling for objective activity

37:21.020 --> 37:22.280
 and predicting death rates.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.340
 And in some, in one of those samples,

37:24.340 --> 37:27.640
 it was a 71% higher risk of death rate,

37:27.640 --> 37:30.160
 you know, if people rated themselves

37:30.160 --> 37:33.480
 as feeling like they were getting less activity than others.

37:33.480 --> 37:35.320
 So, yeah.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.400
 That's a big deal.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.220
 It's a big deal.

37:37.220 --> 37:39.720
 And again, you know, that study is cross-sectional,

37:39.720 --> 37:41.940
 longitudinal, it was not experimental.

37:43.060 --> 37:47.600
 But, you know, combined these really sort of, you know,

37:47.600 --> 37:51.760
 coalesced to say, hey, this is important too, right?

37:51.760 --> 37:54.380
 Like, let's figure out ways to be active

37:54.380 --> 37:55.480
 and get people active,

37:55.480 --> 37:57.660
 but let's also not make people feel horrible

37:57.660 --> 38:00.640
 about themselves when they're not getting enough.

38:00.640 --> 38:02.920
 And going back to the hotel study,

38:02.920 --> 38:04.680
 again, I mentioned that I did that at a time

38:04.680 --> 38:08.080
 when I was a Division I ice hockey player at the time.

38:08.080 --> 38:09.880
 We were training all the time,

38:09.880 --> 38:13.340
 and I was in an unhealthy mindset about that.

38:13.340 --> 38:15.160
 I never felt like I was getting enough.

38:15.160 --> 38:19.140
 I would, you know, come off a two-hour practice

38:19.140 --> 38:20.780
 into a weightlifting session,

38:20.780 --> 38:23.840
 and then I would get on the elliptical for 30 minutes

38:23.840 --> 38:26.960
 because I thought I had to do that also, you know?

38:26.960 --> 38:29.040
 My teammates who were with me at the time

38:29.040 --> 38:30.400
 could attest to that.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.160
 And so that study was really helpful for me

38:33.160 --> 38:35.820
 to realize that I needed to pay attention,

38:35.820 --> 38:37.160
 not just to what I was doing,

38:37.160 --> 38:40.320
 but also take care of my mindset about that.

38:40.320 --> 38:43.520
 And I think the essence is how do you get people

38:43.520 --> 38:45.160
 to feel like they're getting enough?

38:45.160 --> 38:48.080
 It's a sense of enoughness that really matters.

38:48.080 --> 38:49.100
 I can see the dilemma

38:49.100 --> 38:50.760
 because you don't want people thinking

38:50.760 --> 38:55.760
 that exercise and its positive effects are so potent

38:56.880 --> 39:00.560
 that they can get away with a three-minute walk each day

39:00.560 --> 39:04.260
 and that they're good because most likely they are not.

39:05.760 --> 39:09.200
 But again, you don't want them

39:09.200 --> 39:11.240
 to be so back on their heels psychologically

39:11.240 --> 39:12.880
 that they don't even do that

39:12.880 --> 39:16.480
 or that they never exceed that by very much.

39:16.480 --> 39:20.200
 But it seems like the message from the milkshake study

39:20.200 --> 39:22.200
 and what we're talking about now in terms of exercise

39:22.200 --> 39:25.160
 would be to really communicate to the general public

39:25.160 --> 39:28.120
 that food has a potency,

39:29.000 --> 39:31.920
 even healthy foods have a potency to give us energy,

39:31.920 --> 39:36.200
 to fuel our immune system and endocrine system, et cetera.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.680
 And that exercise has a remarkable potency

39:38.680 --> 39:41.000
 and that that potency can be enhanced

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
 by believing in or understanding that potency.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.640
 Is that an accurate way to state it?

39:47.640 --> 39:51.400
 Totally, that's exactly right and that's where I really feel

39:51.400 --> 39:54.760
 like we need to push and what I try to do in our research

39:54.760 --> 39:56.720
 is to not just show, oh, mindset matters,

39:56.720 --> 39:57.560
 isn't that interesting?

39:57.560 --> 40:01.840
 But it's both matter, right?

40:01.840 --> 40:04.060
 Both exercise and what you think about it matter.

40:04.060 --> 40:04.980
 Both what you eat

40:04.980 --> 40:07.520
 and how you think about what you eat matter.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.760
 And so we really as individuals and as a society

40:10.760 --> 40:15.400
 need to work on what is the right way to cultivate

40:15.400 --> 40:18.680
 both behaviors and mindsets about those behaviors

40:18.680 --> 40:19.680
 that serve us.

40:19.680 --> 40:22.820
 And in the food context, this again,

40:22.820 --> 40:26.000
 that milkshake study really changed me on a personal level

40:26.000 --> 40:29.840
 because I had been somebody who was constantly

40:29.840 --> 40:32.160
 trying to restrain my eating, right?

40:32.160 --> 40:37.160
 I wanted to maintain or lose weight, look fit

40:37.200 --> 40:39.360
 and so I was like, well, I should diet,

40:39.360 --> 40:42.280
 I should have low calorie, low carb, low this, low that.

40:42.280 --> 40:44.200
 But what that was doing was putting me

40:44.200 --> 40:47.640
 into this constant mindset of restraint.

40:47.640 --> 40:51.500
 And what that study suggested was that that mindset

40:51.500 --> 40:56.500
 was potentially counteracting any benefit, right?

40:57.380 --> 41:01.520
 Or any objective effects of the restrained diet

41:01.520 --> 41:03.940
 because my brain was saying, okay, you're restraining,

41:03.940 --> 41:06.840
 maybe my body was responding to that

41:06.840 --> 41:10.540
 but the brain was also saying, eat more food,

41:10.540 --> 41:13.320
 stay hungry because you need to survive.

41:13.320 --> 41:17.240
 And so the answer isn't, oh, we'll throw everything

41:17.240 --> 41:19.860
 into the wind and just drink indulgent milkshakes

41:19.860 --> 41:20.700
 all day long.

41:20.700 --> 41:25.700
 The answer is eat healthy foods, right?

41:25.700 --> 41:28.560
 Based on the latest science and what we know to be true

41:28.560 --> 41:31.340
 about nutrients and our body's response to them.

41:31.340 --> 41:34.600
 But try to do so in a mindset of indulgence,

41:34.600 --> 41:38.280
 a mindset of satisfaction, a mindset of enjoyment, right?

41:38.280 --> 41:41.040
 That is really the trick and that's what I at least

41:41.040 --> 41:43.040
 try to do in my own life.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.080
 I love that and as I get more involved

41:45.080 --> 41:48.440
 in the public facing health communications,

41:48.440 --> 41:49.880
 this comes up again and again.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.920
 How should we conceptualize our behavior?

41:51.920 --> 41:54.160
 How should we think about all these options

41:54.160 --> 41:55.060
 that are offered to us?

41:55.060 --> 41:58.820
 And I'm excited that the potency of mindsets

41:58.820 --> 42:01.280
 are coming through again and again.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.440
 So I have a question about this.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.620
 I don't know if this study has ever been done

42:04.620 --> 42:07.400
 but a lot of these mindset effects are something

42:07.400 --> 42:11.940
 that years ago I felt I did vis-a-vis sleep

42:11.940 --> 42:15.240
 because I was in graduate school and as a postdoc

42:15.240 --> 42:17.540
 and even as an undergraduate, I had so much work to do

42:17.540 --> 42:20.920
 that I decided I would sleep when I was dead in quotes.

42:20.920 --> 42:23.280
 Not a good idea from what we know.

42:23.280 --> 42:28.200
 However, I found that a couple nights of minimal sleep

42:28.200 --> 42:30.440
 or even an all-nighter and I could do pretty well.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.300
 Eventually it would catch up with me.

42:32.300 --> 42:34.240
 Has there ever been a study exploring whether or not

42:34.240 --> 42:37.440
 the effects of sleep deprivation can be impacted

42:37.440 --> 42:39.120
 by these mindset effects?

42:39.120 --> 42:42.160
 Because over the years, I keep learning more and more

42:42.160 --> 42:44.280
 about how much sleep I need and I've really emphasized sleep

42:44.280 --> 42:46.400
 and I do feel much better when I'm getting it.

42:46.400 --> 42:51.400
 But as new parents know or students know or athletes know

42:51.400 --> 42:54.040
 or anyone that lives a normal life finds sometimes

42:54.040 --> 42:56.740
 that they don't get a good night's sleep.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.740
 Would believing that we can tolerate that

42:58.740 --> 43:00.920
 and push through it and function just fine

43:00.920 --> 43:04.620
 and then it's not going to kill us or give us Alzheimer's,

43:04.620 --> 43:07.340
 could that help us deal with a poor night's sleep

43:07.340 --> 43:10.440
 or even two or chronic sleep deprivation?

43:10.440 --> 43:12.320
 Certainly, I would guess.

43:12.320 --> 43:16.120
 There's been one study to my knowledge that's tested that.

43:16.120 --> 43:19.780
 Dragana and colleagues and they looked at,

43:19.780 --> 43:22.880
 they had people come in and they gave them sort of a,

43:22.880 --> 43:26.540
 I think it was a sham sort of EEG test

43:26.540 --> 43:29.720
 to sort of figure out how, you know,

43:29.720 --> 43:31.160
 this was done a number of years ago.

43:31.160 --> 43:33.720
 Now we actually have devices to test this

43:33.720 --> 43:37.000
 but theirs was this sham test and then they gave people

43:37.000 --> 43:40.720
 fake feedback about the quality of their sleep

43:40.720 --> 43:43.520
 and, you know, how it had been the night before.

43:43.520 --> 43:46.880
 And they also asked the participants

43:46.880 --> 43:50.320
 how they felt about their sleep and essentially

43:50.320 --> 43:54.500
 what they found was that this sham feedback,

43:54.500 --> 43:57.820
 if they were told that they had gotten lower quality sleep,

43:57.820 --> 44:02.300
 led to deficits in a variety of cognitive tasks

44:02.300 --> 44:06.400
 and that was sort of decoupled from their actual,

44:06.400 --> 44:09.280
 you know, qualities of sleep, at least as self-reported.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.500
 So that's one study that attest to this.

44:11.500 --> 44:14.440
 I think certainly, I mean, I would, you know,

44:14.440 --> 44:17.780
 I would bet a lot of money, I haven't run this myself

44:17.780 --> 44:21.960
 but that your mindsets can push around your, you know,

44:21.960 --> 44:25.540
 cognitive functioning, physiological effects of sleep.

44:25.540 --> 44:28.520
 But once again, it's not all or nothing, right?

44:28.520 --> 44:31.480
 There are real important benefits of sleep

44:31.480 --> 44:35.360
 and how far we can push around that through our mindset

44:35.360 --> 44:37.000
 is an open question.

44:37.000 --> 44:39.240
 You know, the result that you mentioned

44:39.240 --> 44:40.680
 is really interesting because a lot of people

44:40.680 --> 44:42.080
 use these sleep trackers now.

44:42.080 --> 44:43.800
 They're using rings or wristbands.

44:43.800 --> 44:46.160
 In fact, my lab has worked pretty closely with a company

44:46.160 --> 44:48.560
 they supply us data on how well people are sleeping

44:48.560 --> 44:50.280
 and you get a score.

44:50.280 --> 44:52.840
 People get the score back and when they see that score,

44:52.840 --> 44:54.480
 they might think based on these results,

44:54.480 --> 44:57.360
 oh, my sleep, my recovery score, my sleep score was poor.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.480
 I shouldn't expect much for myself today

44:59.480 --> 45:02.600
 or it makes sense that my memory would be going

45:02.600 --> 45:04.680
 for this reason and I'll probably lose a few friends

45:04.680 --> 45:06.600
 for saying this, but hopefully I'll gain a few as well.

45:06.600 --> 45:11.080
 That's why I like to just do a subjective score for myself.

45:11.080 --> 45:12.980
 If I wake up in the morning, I just decide,

45:12.980 --> 45:14.520
 okay, did I sleep well or not?

45:14.520 --> 45:15.960
 I don't like seeing a number.

45:15.960 --> 45:18.940
 I don't like getting a readout from a device.

45:18.940 --> 45:19.780
 That's me.

45:19.780 --> 45:21.760
 I know a lot of people like it and they can be very useful,

45:21.760 --> 45:24.520
 but gosh, it seems that these belief effects

45:24.520 --> 45:26.400
 are weaving in at all levels.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.060
 I'd love for us to talk about stress

45:30.060 --> 45:33.560
 because your lab has worked extensively on this

45:33.560 --> 45:38.400
 and if you would, could you tell us at some point

45:38.400 --> 45:40.500
 about the study that you've done about informing people

45:40.500 --> 45:42.640
 about the different effects of stress,

45:42.640 --> 45:45.400
 but also if there's an opportunity,

45:45.400 --> 45:49.280
 some takeaways about how we could each conceptualize stress

45:49.280 --> 45:52.280
 in ways that would make it serve us better

45:52.280 --> 45:53.560
 as opposed to harm us

45:53.560 --> 45:55.600
 in our mental and physical performance.

45:55.600 --> 45:56.440
 Great.

45:56.440 --> 46:00.480
 Yeah, so I had come off the heels of doing some research

46:00.480 --> 46:05.480
 and exercise and diet and finding these provocative

46:06.240 --> 46:09.560
 and also counterintuitive effects with respect

46:09.560 --> 46:13.120
 to how we should try to motivate people, right?

46:13.120 --> 46:18.120
 And as I was thinking about this and this grouping

46:18.280 --> 46:21.880
 of going from medicines to saving us,

46:21.880 --> 46:25.200
 to behaviors to saving us and how those behaviors

46:25.200 --> 46:27.760
 might be influenced by mindsets,

46:27.760 --> 46:31.760
 the obvious next thing to think about was stress, right?

46:31.760 --> 46:33.480
 Because it's like, okay, well, you wanna be healthier,

46:33.480 --> 46:37.280
 fix your diet, fix your exercise and stress less.

46:37.280 --> 46:40.140
 And so I started doing some digging

46:40.140 --> 46:43.760
 into the nature of stress and a couple things were clear.

46:43.760 --> 46:48.040
 One was that the public health message was very clear, right?

46:48.040 --> 46:50.200
 That stress was bad, right?

46:50.200 --> 46:55.160
 Unmitigated and harmful on our health,

46:55.160 --> 46:58.520
 our productivity, our relationships, our fertility,

46:58.520 --> 47:01.840
 our cognition, you name it, right?

47:01.840 --> 47:05.280
 The messages that were out there by and large

47:05.280 --> 47:07.920
 oversimplified messages focused

47:07.920 --> 47:11.220
 on the damaging consequences of stress.

47:11.220 --> 47:13.880
 But as you know, if you actually dive deeper

47:13.880 --> 47:16.840
 into the literature on stress and the origins of stress,

47:16.840 --> 47:19.480
 what you find is that the literature,

47:19.480 --> 47:21.720
 like most literatures is not so clear cut.

47:21.720 --> 47:24.700
 And in fact, there's a large amount of evidence

47:24.700 --> 47:28.580
 to support the fact that the experience of stress,

47:28.580 --> 47:31.240
 meaning encountering adversity or challenge

47:31.240 --> 47:33.460
 in one's goal-related efforts,

47:34.840 --> 47:37.320
 does not have to be debilitating.

47:37.320 --> 47:40.440
 And in many cases, the body's response was designed

47:40.440 --> 47:44.560
 to enhance our ability to manage at those moments, right?

47:44.560 --> 47:48.700
 So some research showing that stress narrows our focus,

47:48.700 --> 47:51.200
 increases our attention, speeds up the rate

47:51.200 --> 47:53.400
 at which we're able to process information.

47:53.400 --> 47:56.600
 There was some research out there showing this phenomenon

47:56.600 --> 48:00.800
 of physiological toughening, the process by which

48:00.800 --> 48:03.680
 the release of catabolic hormones and the stress response

48:03.680 --> 48:06.120
 recruit or activate anabolic hormones,

48:06.120 --> 48:08.780
 which help, as you know, build our muscles,

48:08.780 --> 48:12.400
 build our neurons to help us grow and learn.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.600
 And there was a whole body of emerging research

48:14.600 --> 48:17.800
 on post-traumatic growth or this phenomenon

48:17.800 --> 48:21.520
 in which even the experience of the most traumatic stressors

48:21.520 --> 48:24.420
 and the most chronic and enduring stressors

48:24.420 --> 48:26.480
 could lead not to destruction,

48:26.480 --> 48:28.320
 but in fact to the exact opposite,

48:28.320 --> 48:32.960
 to an enhanced sense of connection with our values,

48:32.960 --> 48:37.960
 connection to others, sense of joy and passion for living.

48:38.480 --> 48:41.920
 And so, you know, I found that to be interesting.

48:42.800 --> 48:47.080
 And, you know, my work since then has been not to try

48:47.080 --> 48:49.840
 to argue that stress is enhancing and not debilitating,

48:49.840 --> 48:54.040
 but try to point out that the true nature of stress

48:54.040 --> 48:55.040
 is a paradox.

48:55.040 --> 48:58.680
 The true nature of stress is manifold and complex

48:58.680 --> 49:01.200
 and lots of things can happen.

49:01.200 --> 49:05.240
 But to question what's the role of our mindset about stress

49:05.240 --> 49:08.240
 in shaping our response to stress?

49:08.240 --> 49:11.700
 So some work had already been done looking at

49:11.700 --> 49:14.020
 your perception of the stressor, right?

49:14.020 --> 49:17.780
 So do you view a stressor like a challenging exam

49:17.780 --> 49:20.920
 or a health diagnosis as a challenge or a threat?

49:20.920 --> 49:23.800
 And that had shown pretty convincingly

49:23.800 --> 49:26.280
 that when you view stressors more as a challenge,

49:26.280 --> 49:27.560
 less as a threat,

49:27.560 --> 49:32.560
 that your brain and body responds more adaptively.

49:32.680 --> 49:35.000
 What our question was was to take the sort of

49:35.000 --> 49:38.560
 psychological construal one step higher in abstraction.

49:38.560 --> 49:42.320
 So not just the stressor, but the nature of stress, right?

49:42.320 --> 49:45.160
 Do you, you know, at that core level,

49:45.160 --> 49:48.160
 do you view stress as something that's bad,

49:48.160 --> 49:50.760
 is going to kill us and therefore should be avoided?

49:50.760 --> 49:54.080
 Or do you view stress as natural

49:54.080 --> 49:56.760
 and something that's going to enhance us?

49:56.760 --> 50:00.040
 And so we set out to design a series of studies

50:00.040 --> 50:02.920
 to test the extent to which these mindsets

50:02.920 --> 50:04.460
 about stress mattered.

50:05.360 --> 50:08.280
 We first, this again was with Peter Salovey

50:08.280 --> 50:10.400
 and Sean Aker originally.

50:10.400 --> 50:13.580
 We designed a measure to test people's mindsets

50:13.580 --> 50:16.360
 about stress, simple questions like

50:16.360 --> 50:19.540
 what extent do you believe or agree or disagree

50:19.540 --> 50:22.880
 with statements like stress enhances my performance

50:22.880 --> 50:27.880
 in productivity, stress heightens my vitality and growth,

50:28.480 --> 50:29.320
 things like that.

50:29.320 --> 50:32.000
 And we found in a number of correlational studies

50:32.000 --> 50:34.560
 that that more enhancing stress mindset

50:34.560 --> 50:38.760
 was linked to better health outcomes,

50:38.760 --> 50:41.340
 better wellbeing and higher performance.

50:41.340 --> 50:43.680
 So then we set out to see if we could change

50:43.680 --> 50:45.240
 people's mindsets.

50:45.240 --> 50:47.880
 And in our first test of this, we decided to do so

50:47.880 --> 50:50.600
 by creating these multimedia films

50:50.600 --> 50:55.600
 that showcased research, anecdotes, facts about stress,

50:56.760 --> 51:01.680
 all true, but oriented towards one mindset or the other.

51:01.680 --> 51:04.600
 So you can imagine one set of films showed

51:04.600 --> 51:06.360
 basically the messages that were out there

51:06.360 --> 51:08.000
 in the public health context.

51:08.000 --> 51:13.000
 The other showed, hey, stress has been linked

51:13.480 --> 51:15.680
 to these things, but in fact, the body stress response

51:15.680 --> 51:16.800
 was designed to do this.

51:16.800 --> 51:17.840
 Did you know it could do that?

51:17.840 --> 51:22.080
 And we had empowering images like LeBron James

51:22.080 --> 51:23.960
 making the free throw in the final minute

51:23.960 --> 51:25.440
 versus missing it, right?

51:25.440 --> 51:28.720
 So all of these things are true possibilities,

51:28.720 --> 51:32.720
 but oriented to two different mindsets about stress.

51:32.720 --> 51:35.400
 So either people saw a video that basically made it seem

51:35.400 --> 51:38.680
 like stress will diminish you, crush you, reduce you,

51:38.680 --> 51:42.900
 or a video, very similar, stress will grow you,

51:42.900 --> 51:45.440
 bring out your best and maybe even take you

51:45.440 --> 51:46.960
 to heightened levels of performance

51:46.960 --> 51:48.600
 that you've never experienced before.

51:48.600 --> 51:49.960
 Exactly, exactly.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.820
 So yeah, examples in the sports.

51:51.820 --> 51:54.080
 We also had like true leaders emerge

51:54.080 --> 51:57.000
 in the moments of greatest stress, you know, Churchill.

51:57.000 --> 51:59.440
 And so all those examples are out there

51:59.440 --> 52:02.400
 for both the enhancing nature and the debilitating nature.

52:02.400 --> 52:05.760
 And our question was, does orienting people

52:05.760 --> 52:09.600
 to different mindsets change how they respond to stress?

52:09.600 --> 52:11.300
 So this study was done in the wake

52:11.300 --> 52:14.460
 of the 2008 financial crisis.

52:14.460 --> 52:19.240
 We worked with UBS, a company, a financial service company

52:19.240 --> 52:22.320
 that was undergoing pretty massive amounts of layoffs.

52:22.320 --> 52:25.660
 So these employees were stressed about being laid off.

52:25.660 --> 52:27.480
 They were taking on more pressure.

52:27.480 --> 52:29.200
 It was just a tough time.

52:29.200 --> 52:32.760
 And we randomized them into three conditions.

52:32.760 --> 52:36.240
 And this was all pre-work before getting a training

52:36.240 --> 52:39.380
 on stress, but the three different conditions,

52:39.380 --> 52:41.000
 some watched no videos,

52:41.000 --> 52:43.520
 some watched the stress will crush you videos,

52:43.520 --> 52:47.200
 and some watched the stress could enhance you videos.

52:47.200 --> 52:49.500
 And what we found was that just, you know,

52:49.500 --> 52:51.800
 it was a total of nine minutes of videos

52:51.800 --> 52:54.140
 over the course of the week led to changes

52:54.140 --> 52:56.040
 in their mindsets about stress,

52:56.040 --> 53:00.240
 which led to changes in their physiological symptoms

53:00.240 --> 53:01.560
 associated with stress.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.920
 So people who watched the enhancing films

53:03.920 --> 53:06.480
 had fewer backaches, muscle tension,

53:06.480 --> 53:09.880
 insomnia, racing heart, and so forth.

53:09.880 --> 53:14.000
 And they also reported performing better at work

53:14.000 --> 53:16.900
 compared to those who watched the debilitating videos.

53:16.900 --> 53:19.240
 Now, interestingly, we didn't make anyone worse

53:19.240 --> 53:21.960
 with the debilitating videos, which was good.

53:21.960 --> 53:25.600
 We had told the IRB we didn't expect that

53:25.600 --> 53:27.960
 because that message was already out there.

53:27.960 --> 53:29.280
 That's what they were already seeing.

53:29.280 --> 53:31.080
 That wasn't new to them.

53:31.080 --> 53:34.000
 It was more of this enhancing perspective

53:34.000 --> 53:37.240
 that turned out to be inspiring.

53:37.240 --> 53:38.080
 I love that study.

53:38.080 --> 53:41.600
 And I know we both have friends and ties

53:41.600 --> 53:43.200
 in the special operations community

53:43.200 --> 53:45.360
 through just sort of happenstance.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.840
 And we can, maybe we'll get into that a little later,

53:47.840 --> 53:50.860
 but a good friend from that community always says,

53:50.860 --> 53:53.480
 you know, there are only three ways to go through life

53:53.480 --> 53:55.520
 at any moment, which is either back on your heels,

53:55.520 --> 53:57.680
 flat-footed, or forward center of mass.

53:57.680 --> 54:00.160
 And I said, well, what's the key to forward center of mass?

54:00.160 --> 54:01.920
 And he said, stress is what places you

54:01.920 --> 54:03.400
 in forward center of mass,

54:03.400 --> 54:05.480
 meaning leaning forward and into challenge.

54:05.480 --> 54:07.840
 And I know that you've actually looked at that community

54:07.840 --> 54:10.040
 and it does really seem like that's a mindset

54:10.040 --> 54:12.840
 that either they have going in or that they cultivate

54:12.840 --> 54:15.200
 through the course of their training.

54:15.200 --> 54:20.040
 But this notion that stress is what puts us in forward motion

54:20.040 --> 54:21.760
 is true physiologically, right?

54:21.760 --> 54:23.920
 I mean, adrenaline's major role is to place us

54:23.920 --> 54:26.880
 into a moment of, or bias us towards action.

54:26.880 --> 54:27.700
 That's why we tremble.

54:27.700 --> 54:30.440
 It's the body trying to initiate action.

54:30.440 --> 54:33.200
 But actually this is probably a good opportunity.

54:33.200 --> 54:34.800
 If there's anything interesting to extract

54:34.800 --> 54:38.840
 from the study on seal teams, what was it?

54:38.840 --> 54:41.880
 Yeah, no, I loved working with the seals.

54:43.680 --> 54:45.060
 One of the interesting things we found,

54:45.060 --> 54:49.600
 so we've studied this, measured this mindset

54:49.600 --> 54:51.200
 in several different populations.

54:51.200 --> 54:55.320
 And in every single one that we have tested so far,

54:55.320 --> 54:58.520
 the average had been on the debilitating side of the scale.

54:58.520 --> 54:59.840
 People just saying stress is bad.

54:59.840 --> 55:01.080
 Stress is bad, right?

55:01.080 --> 55:05.240
 And, you know, it's like with measures of growth

55:05.240 --> 55:07.520
 and fixed mindsets about intelligence,

55:07.520 --> 55:09.240
 people are in the middle,

55:09.240 --> 55:11.480
 but oftentimes have a more positive mindsets

55:11.480 --> 55:13.040
 about intelligence.

55:13.040 --> 55:14.600
 That was not the case with stress.

55:14.600 --> 55:15.900
 It's still not the case.

55:15.900 --> 55:17.560
 I'm trying to get the message out there,

55:17.560 --> 55:20.320
 except for this group of Navy SEALs

55:20.320 --> 55:22.440
 where they're actually recruits,

55:22.440 --> 55:24.680
 so people who were going through basic training

55:24.680 --> 55:26.920
 in order to become Navy SEALs.

55:26.920 --> 55:30.520
 And we found that they, on average,

55:30.520 --> 55:33.160
 had stress as enhancing mindset,

55:33.160 --> 55:34.640
 perhaps not surprisingly, right?

55:34.640 --> 55:36.600
 If you're going in to devote your whole life

55:36.600 --> 55:40.380
 to being a Navy SEAL, you must have some inclination

55:40.380 --> 55:44.360
 that stress is a source of strength for you.

55:44.360 --> 55:45.460
 But what we found with them,

55:45.460 --> 55:48.520
 we measured this at the beginning of their basic training,

55:48.520 --> 55:51.160
 with BUDDS training, and then looked at

55:51.160 --> 55:53.720
 how well they succeeded through that program.

55:53.720 --> 55:57.480
 So as you know, this is an extremely rigorous program.

55:57.480 --> 56:01.400
 You know, at the time it was only like 10 or 20% of-

56:01.400 --> 56:02.240
 Still is.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.060
 Trainees make it through.

56:03.060 --> 56:05.560
 The numbers have never shifted from about that.

56:05.560 --> 56:08.840
 No matter how hard pressures on the community change,

56:08.840 --> 56:11.720
 the numbers are still, on average, about 15%.

56:11.720 --> 56:12.560
 Yeah, wow.

56:12.560 --> 56:17.080
 So what we found was that our measure predicted that rate.

56:17.080 --> 56:19.240
 So people who even within that range

56:19.240 --> 56:21.040
 had a more stress-enhancing mindset

56:21.040 --> 56:24.160
 were more likely to complete training, become a SEAL.

56:24.160 --> 56:26.920
 They also had faster obstacle course times,

56:26.920 --> 56:30.540
 and they were rated by their peers more positively.

56:30.540 --> 56:34.360
 So, you know, again, let's break this down, right?

56:34.360 --> 56:37.200
 This doesn't mean, and people get me,

56:37.200 --> 56:38.640
 people get this wrong sometimes.

56:38.640 --> 56:40.040
 They think that I'm saying

56:41.040 --> 56:42.720
 that a stress-enhancing mindset means

56:42.720 --> 56:44.680
 you should like stress, right?

56:44.680 --> 56:46.840
 Well, maybe SEALs do.

56:46.840 --> 56:48.620
 But that's not what we're saying, right?

56:48.620 --> 56:51.640
 Having a stress-enhancing mindset doesn't mean

56:51.640 --> 56:53.680
 the stressor is a good thing, right?

56:53.680 --> 56:55.060
 It doesn't mean it's a good thing

56:55.060 --> 56:59.380
 that you have to go into combat and it's not pretty, right?

56:59.380 --> 57:02.720
 It doesn't mean that getting a cancer diagnosis

57:02.720 --> 57:05.560
 is a good thing or being in abject poverty is a good thing.

57:05.560 --> 57:07.480
 These are not good things.

57:07.480 --> 57:10.520
 But the experience of the stress associated with that,

57:10.520 --> 57:12.520
 the challenge, the adversity,

57:12.520 --> 57:17.520
 that experience can lead to enhancing outcomes

57:17.600 --> 57:21.040
 with respect to not just our cognition,

57:21.040 --> 57:24.040
 but our health, our performance, and our wellbeing.

57:24.040 --> 57:27.560
 So that mindset, right, how does that work, right?

57:27.560 --> 57:30.760
 Well, it works through a number of different pathways.

57:30.760 --> 57:32.940
 One is that it changes fundamentally

57:32.940 --> 57:34.780
 what we're motivated to do.

57:34.780 --> 57:37.560
 So if you, you know, just imagine

57:37.560 --> 57:39.000
 we're stressed about something,

57:39.000 --> 57:42.120
 maybe a global pandemic, for example,

57:42.120 --> 57:47.120
 for instance, you know, and you think that stress is bad,

57:48.160 --> 57:50.160
 then what's your motivation, right?

57:50.160 --> 57:53.160
 Your motivation is to, well, first you get worried

57:53.160 --> 57:54.200
 about the stress, right?

57:54.200 --> 57:55.680
 Now, not only do you have the pandemic,

57:55.680 --> 57:58.040
 you're stressed about the stress of the pandemic.

57:58.040 --> 58:00.040
 But second is your reaction is typically

58:00.040 --> 58:01.000
 to do one of two things.

58:01.000 --> 58:04.480
 It's either to freak out and do everything you can

58:04.480 --> 58:06.400
 to make sure that this doesn't affect you,

58:06.400 --> 58:09.340
 you know, negatively, or to check out and say,

58:09.340 --> 58:11.240
 oh, it's not a big deal, I'm not gonna deal with it.

58:11.240 --> 58:12.760
 You know, you're basically in denial.

58:12.760 --> 58:15.720
 So people who have a stress and debilitating mindset,

58:15.720 --> 58:17.360
 and we've shown this in our research,

58:17.360 --> 58:19.720
 tend to go to one or the other of those extremes.

58:19.720 --> 58:21.980
 They freak out or they check out.

58:21.980 --> 58:23.200
 Why, because if stress is bad,

58:23.200 --> 58:25.640
 you need to either get rid of it and deal with it

58:25.640 --> 58:28.220
 or it needs to not exist, right?

58:28.220 --> 58:30.760
 If you have a stress-enhancing mindset,

58:30.760 --> 58:32.360
 the motivation changes, right?

58:32.360 --> 58:36.360
 Then the motivation is how do I utilize the stress

58:36.360 --> 58:38.680
 to realize the enhancing outcomes?

58:38.680 --> 58:43.400
 What can we do here, right, to learn from this experience

58:43.400 --> 58:46.880
 to make us stronger, fitter, you know,

58:46.880 --> 58:50.000
 have better science and treatments for the future,

58:50.000 --> 58:52.160
 deepen my relationships with others,

58:53.000 --> 58:55.580
 improve, you know, my priorities, and so forth, right?

58:55.580 --> 58:59.560
 So the motivation changes, the affect around it changes.

58:59.560 --> 59:01.580
 It doesn't make it easy to deal with,

59:01.580 --> 59:03.040
 but what we've shown in our research

59:03.040 --> 59:05.760
 is that people who have a stress-enhancing mindset

59:05.760 --> 59:09.000
 have more positive affect, not necessarily less

59:09.000 --> 59:13.240
 negative affect, and it potentially changes physiology.

59:13.240 --> 59:18.300
 We have a few studies that show that people who are,

59:18.300 --> 59:21.560
 you know, inspired to adopt more enhancing mindsets

59:21.560 --> 59:24.240
 have more moderate cortisol response,

59:24.240 --> 59:28.060
 and they have higher levels of DHEA levels

59:28.060 --> 59:29.280
 in response to stress.

59:29.280 --> 59:32.080
 So more work needs to be done on the physiology,

59:32.080 --> 59:35.600
 but I'd love your take on the mechanisms

59:35.600 --> 59:37.120
 through which that's possible.

59:37.120 --> 59:40.880
 Yes, and DHEA, of course, has an anabolic hormone

59:40.880 --> 59:42.400
 in both men and women.

59:42.400 --> 59:46.360
 Very interesting because we had a guest on this podcast.

59:46.360 --> 59:48.540
 He actually is a PhD scientist

59:48.540 --> 59:51.800
 who runs the UFC Performance Training Institute.

59:51.800 --> 59:54.720
 His name is Duncan French, and his graduate work

59:54.720 --> 59:56.560
 at UConn Storrs was very interesting.

59:56.560 --> 59:58.840
 It was in exercise science and physiology.

59:58.840 --> 1:00:01.480
 What he showed was that if you could spike

1:00:01.480 --> 1:00:03.640
 the adrenaline response, I think they did this

1:00:03.640 --> 1:00:06.200
 through first-time skydive or something like that,

1:00:06.200 --> 1:00:09.240
 that testosterone went up.

1:00:09.240 --> 1:00:12.000
 Now, this spits in the face of everything that we're told

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:15.820
 about stress and testosterone levels, right?

1:00:15.820 --> 1:00:19.640
 And this has also been looked at in females with estrogen,

1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:22.400
 although, of course, there's estrogen, testosterone

1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:23.300
 in both males and females,

1:00:23.300 --> 1:00:24.880
 but that's how they designed the study.

1:00:24.880 --> 1:00:27.880
 So it turns out that at least in the short term,

1:00:27.880 --> 1:00:32.800
 that a very stressful event can raise anabolic hormones.

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:35.980
 And I think that people forget at a mechanistic level

1:00:35.980 --> 1:00:37.880
 that adrenaline is epinephrine,

1:00:37.880 --> 1:00:40.960
 and epinephrine is derived, biochemically derived,

1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:42.680
 from the molecule dopamine.

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:44.640
 If you look at the pathway and even just Google it

1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:47.240
 and go images, you'll see that adrenaline

1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:50.080
 is made from dopamine, and dopamine

1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:52.080
 and these anabolic hormones have a very close,

1:00:52.080 --> 1:00:53.120
 they're sort of close cousins.

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:55.480
 They work together in the pituitary and hypothalamus.

1:00:55.480 --> 1:00:59.960
 So it makes sense that one could leverage stress

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:03.480
 toward growth and towards anabolism as opposed

1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:06.280
 to cannibalism, which is not saying cannibalism

1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:09.840
 as in eating other people, but catabolic processes

1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:11.760
 is I guess the right way to refer to it.

1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:13.840
 But what's again, remarkable to me is that all

1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:15.700
 of these brain structures that control dopamine,

1:01:15.700 --> 1:01:18.260
 epinephrine, testosterone, and estrogen,

1:01:18.260 --> 1:01:19.920
 they're all thought to be in the subconscious,

1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:24.280
 meaning below our ability to flip a switch

1:01:24.280 --> 1:01:25.840
 and turn them on or off.

1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:28.280
 And yet mindset seemed to impact them.

1:01:28.280 --> 1:01:33.280
 So all that to say that there's a clear mechanistic basis

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.800
 by which this could all work.

1:01:35.800 --> 1:01:38.760
 And so on the one hand, I'm surprised

1:01:38.760 --> 1:01:40.440
 because these are incredible results.

1:01:40.440 --> 1:01:41.560
 On the other hand, I'm not surprised

1:01:41.560 --> 1:01:43.400
 because there's a physiological substrate there

1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:45.320
 that could readily explain them.

1:01:45.320 --> 1:01:49.040
 Yeah, and I think figuring out exactly how it works

1:01:49.040 --> 1:01:50.960
 is really, you know.

1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:51.800
 We should do that.

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:52.620
 We should do that.

1:01:52.620 --> 1:01:53.460
 We should collaborate.

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:54.800
 We've got common friends in both departments,

1:01:54.800 --> 1:01:55.760
 so we should do it.

1:01:55.760 --> 1:01:56.600
 Why not?

1:01:56.600 --> 1:02:00.160
 I just wanna mention, you know, the way I think

1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:03.160
 about mindset, and again, I think we need to study this.

1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:05.240
 I'm not a neuroscientist, so I haven't looked at this,

1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:07.160
 but this is something we could do.

1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:09.840
 But the way I think about mindset is that it's,

1:02:09.840 --> 1:02:11.800
 mindsets are kind of a portal

1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:16.360
 between conscious and subconscious processes.

1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:20.940
 They operate as a default setting of the mind, right?

1:02:20.940 --> 1:02:25.720
 So if, you know, if sort of programmed in there,

1:02:25.720 --> 1:02:29.500
 you have stress equals bad, right?

1:02:29.500 --> 1:02:34.000
 That is gonna, you know, that's gonna be something

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.040
 maybe conscious, right?

1:02:36.040 --> 1:02:38.800
 But it doesn't have to be conscious, right?

1:02:38.800 --> 1:02:40.880
 People don't have to know their mindsets about stress

1:02:40.880 --> 1:02:42.480
 until they're asked, really.

1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:46.240
 That's been programmed in through our upbringing,

1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:49.480
 through public health messages, and through media,

1:02:49.480 --> 1:02:51.920
 and other things, and it kind of sits there

1:02:51.920 --> 1:02:53.360
 as an assumption in the brain,

1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:56.600
 and the brain is then figuring out

1:02:56.600 --> 1:02:59.320
 how should it respond to this situation.

1:02:59.320 --> 1:03:01.040
 And if the assumption, the default,

1:03:01.040 --> 1:03:04.260
 the programming is stress is bad,

1:03:04.260 --> 1:03:06.840
 that's gonna, through our subconscious,

1:03:06.840 --> 1:03:08.680
 trigger all the things that's like, okay, well,

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:13.320
 I need to like, you know, rev up the things that protect me

1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:16.340
 versus rev up the things that help me grow.

1:03:16.340 --> 1:03:19.280
 And so that's at least how I think about it.

1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:23.200
 And what's cool about it is that because it operates

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:25.880
 as a sort of portal, it communicates with more,

1:03:25.880 --> 1:03:28.960
 you know, subconscious physiological processes,

1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:32.080
 but it can also be accessed through our consciousness, right?

1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:36.560
 So just talking about this, right, for your listeners,

1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:40.720
 they're now invited to bring their stress mindsets

1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:42.440
 up to the consciousness and say,

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:44.220
 what is my stress mindset?

1:03:44.220 --> 1:03:46.000
 How am I thinking about stress?

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.640
 Can I reprogram that?

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:51.040
 Can I start to think about it as more enhancing?

1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:54.240
 That takes a little bit of a conscious work potentially,

1:03:54.240 --> 1:03:56.640
 but then once you do that,

1:03:56.640 --> 1:03:59.080
 that can kind of operate in the background,

1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:00.920
 influencing how your body responds.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:02.560
 And you don't have to say, okay, I'm stressed.

1:04:02.560 --> 1:04:06.400
 I better tell my, you know, anabolic hormones.

1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:08.440
 That doesn't work that way.

1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:12.560
 But these mindsets can help with the translational process.

1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:14.680
 I love the idea that mindsets are at the interface

1:04:14.680 --> 1:04:16.760
 between the conscious and subconscious.

1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:20.140
 And I think there's a lot to unpack there,

1:04:20.140 --> 1:04:25.140
 but it clearly is the case that the mindsets,

1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:27.120
 they sort of act as heuristics, right?

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:29.040
 And as we talked about earlier,

1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:31.660
 they can limit what the number of things to focus on.

1:04:31.660 --> 1:04:33.460
 Because one thing that is really stressful

1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:35.240
 is trying to focus on everything all the time.

1:04:35.240 --> 1:04:37.000
 I mean, trying to navigate the public health

1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.560
 around anything, the public health information

1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:40.920
 around anything is kind of overwhelming.

1:04:40.920 --> 1:04:42.000
 As you mentioned for stress,

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.060
 you see a lot in the stresses will crush you,

1:04:44.060 --> 1:04:45.920
 and then you can also find evidence

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:47.360
 that stress will grow you.

1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:52.360
 So how should we, the listeners, think about stress?

1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:57.240
 I mean, what's the most adaptive way to think about stress?

1:04:57.240 --> 1:04:59.280
 And should we talk about our stress?

1:04:59.280 --> 1:05:01.220
 Should we not talk about our stress?

1:05:02.140 --> 1:05:04.640
 Is there a short list of ways

1:05:04.640 --> 1:05:07.000
 that we can cope with stress better?

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.140
 Or I should be careful with the word cope.

1:05:09.140 --> 1:05:12.440
 Is there a way that we can leverage stress to our advantage?

1:05:12.440 --> 1:05:15.880
 Great, yeah, and that's an important nuance

1:05:15.880 --> 1:05:17.520
 in your language, which is,

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:20.100
 people have, by and large, come from a place

1:05:20.100 --> 1:05:21.720
 of how do you manage stress?

1:05:21.720 --> 1:05:22.720
 How do you cope with it?

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:26.280
 Which implies, how do you fight against it?

1:05:26.280 --> 1:05:29.280
 Vacation, massages, yoga classes, and yeah.

1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:32.040
 Fight against it or check out from it, right?

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:35.280
 And yeah, the real challenge is how do we leverage it?

1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:36.600
 How do we utilize it?

1:05:36.600 --> 1:05:38.640
 How do we work with it?

1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:40.580
 And I have a lot of thoughts on this.

1:05:40.580 --> 1:05:42.720
 The first and most important thing

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:47.280
 is to clarify our definition of stress.

1:05:47.280 --> 1:05:50.200
 So I think people often associate,

1:05:50.200 --> 1:05:52.080
 the stress mind, negative stress mindset,

1:05:52.080 --> 1:05:55.920
 is so insidious

1:05:55.920 --> 1:05:58.080
 that now people define stress

1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:00.520
 with its negative consequences.

1:06:00.520 --> 1:06:02.600
 So the first step is to decouple that

1:06:02.600 --> 1:06:06.820
 and to realize that stress is a neutral, right,

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:10.120
 yet to be determined effect

1:06:10.120 --> 1:06:13.760
 of experiencing or anticipating

1:06:13.760 --> 1:06:16.880
 adversity in your goal-related efforts.

1:06:16.880 --> 1:06:18.520
 So let me unpack that a little more.

1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:20.520
 You can be in the midst of it

1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:23.480
 or you could just be worried about something happening.

1:06:23.480 --> 1:06:24.920
 That's one aspect.

1:06:24.920 --> 1:06:27.200
 Second is adversity or challenge,

1:06:27.200 --> 1:06:29.920
 so something that's working against you.

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:31.520
 But the third piece is critical

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:34.760
 and that is in your goal-related efforts.

1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:36.040
 What that means is that

1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:39.480
 we only stress about things we care about,

1:06:39.480 --> 1:06:41.740
 things that matter to us.

1:06:41.740 --> 1:06:44.840
 So this is really important, right,

1:06:44.840 --> 1:06:49.040
 because stress is linked with,

1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:51.440
 it's the other side of the coin

1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:53.500
 of things we care about, right?

1:06:53.500 --> 1:06:56.960
 And so I think that's the first thing to realize, right,

1:06:56.960 --> 1:07:01.960
 that as humans, we stress because we care

1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:06.360
 and we don't stress about things we don't care about.

1:07:06.360 --> 1:07:09.220
 So the simplified example I like to use is,

1:07:09.220 --> 1:07:12.680
 you know, if Johnny was failing school,

1:07:12.680 --> 1:07:14.340
 that wouldn't stress you out

1:07:14.340 --> 1:07:18.680
 unless Johnny was your son or you were Johnny

1:07:18.680 --> 1:07:20.360
 or you really cared about

1:07:20.360 --> 1:07:22.300
 the educating the Johnnies of the world, right?

1:07:22.300 --> 1:07:24.320
 It only becomes stressful to the extent

1:07:24.320 --> 1:07:25.860
 that you care about it.

1:07:25.860 --> 1:07:30.420
 So why are we trying to fight or run away or hide

1:07:30.420 --> 1:07:32.080
 or merely cope with our stress

1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:34.940
 or, you know, overcome it through our massages

1:07:34.940 --> 1:07:39.940
 when the stress is connected to the things we care about?

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:43.320
 So then the question becomes, okay, if that's true,

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:47.380
 how can I better utilize or leverage

1:07:47.380 --> 1:07:50.780
 or respond to the inevitable stresses

1:07:50.780 --> 1:07:52.880
 that we're going to experience?

1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:55.560
 I'm not saying go out and seek out more stress.

1:07:55.560 --> 1:07:57.880
 What I am saying is that you're gonna experience stress

1:07:57.880 --> 1:08:00.120
 if you have any cares or values or passions

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:02.160
 and most all of us do.

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:05.240
 And so then what do you do?

1:08:05.240 --> 1:08:08.120
 And we've developed a three-step approach

1:08:08.120 --> 1:08:10.540
 to adopting a stress-enhancing mindset.

1:08:10.540 --> 1:08:14.300
 And briefly, the first step is to just acknowledge

1:08:14.300 --> 1:08:19.300
 that you're stressed, to own it, see it, be mindful of it.

1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:22.960
 The second step is to welcome it.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.240
 Why would you welcome it?

1:08:25.240 --> 1:08:28.760
 You welcome it because inherently in that stress

1:08:28.760 --> 1:08:30.300
 is something you care about.

1:08:30.300 --> 1:08:32.960
 So you're using it as an opportunity to reconnect

1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:35.800
 to what is it that I care about here?

1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:39.720
 And then the third step is to utilize the stress response

1:08:39.720 --> 1:08:43.120
 to achieve the thing that you care about,

1:08:43.120 --> 1:08:45.940
 not spend your time, money, effort, energy,

1:08:45.940 --> 1:08:48.740
 trying to get rid of the stress.

1:08:48.740 --> 1:08:49.580
 Does that make sense?

1:08:49.580 --> 1:08:50.420
 I can-

1:08:50.420 --> 1:08:51.240
 Makes sense.

1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:52.080
 And I love it.

1:08:52.080 --> 1:08:52.900
 As somebody who's laboratory studies

1:08:52.900 --> 1:08:54.240
 the physiological effects of stress,

1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:57.820
 the effects that impress me the most are, for instance,

1:08:57.820 --> 1:08:59.980
 the narrowing of visual attention

1:08:59.980 --> 1:09:04.980
 that then drives a capacity to parse time more finely,

1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:08.960
 which then drives a capacity to process information faster.

1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:10.520
 It's almost like a superpower.

1:09:11.400 --> 1:09:16.400
 And yes, it can feel uncomfortable often,

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:21.520
 but I love the idea that acknowledging it, embracing it,

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.420
 and then understanding its power and leveraging that power,

1:09:26.420 --> 1:09:29.680
 I think is in, what I like so much about that framework

1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:32.520
 is that the stress response is very generic.

1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:33.920
 Unlike the relaxation response,

1:09:33.920 --> 1:09:36.080
 we don't actually have to train up the stress response.

1:09:36.080 --> 1:09:39.100
 So we all kind of get this as a freebie.

1:09:39.100 --> 1:09:40.320
 And then it sounds like it's a question

1:09:40.320 --> 1:09:41.780
 of what we end up doing with that.

1:09:41.780 --> 1:09:42.620
 Right.

1:09:42.620 --> 1:09:44.680
 And Hans Selye, father of stress, said himself,

1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:47.040
 it's a nonspecific response, right?

1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:50.080
 So it occurs, it's what you're doing with it.

1:09:50.080 --> 1:09:51.720
 It's how you're channeling it.

1:09:51.720 --> 1:09:53.920
 And yeah, like we talked about before,

1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:57.600
 what most people do is they stress about the stress,

1:09:57.600 --> 1:09:59.600
 which then over-exacerbates it.

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:01.320
 Or they check out from the stress,

1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:04.080
 which leads to depression and anhedonia,

1:10:04.080 --> 1:10:05.980
 because by checking out from stress,

1:10:05.980 --> 1:10:08.480
 you're also checking out from the things we care about.

1:10:08.480 --> 1:10:09.520
 And substance abuse.

1:10:09.520 --> 1:10:10.360
 Exactly.

1:10:10.360 --> 1:10:11.720
 Our colleague, Anna Lemke, who also,

1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:13.120
 we had the good fortune of having as a guest

1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:15.000
 on this podcast, talked a lot about this,

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.760
 that so much of substance abuse,

1:10:18.760 --> 1:10:20.080
 because she runs the addiction clinic

1:10:20.080 --> 1:10:22.720
 over on the med side of campus,

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:26.080
 it takes over people's lives

1:10:26.080 --> 1:10:31.080
 because of this increased ability to find a solution

1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:32.720
 to the stress that then eventually becomes

1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:34.700
 its own stressor and its own problem.

1:10:35.900 --> 1:10:40.220
 Well, I love that mindset and framework.

1:10:40.220 --> 1:10:42.840
 I'd love for you to tell us just a bit

1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:45.360
 about what you're up to right now

1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:47.140
 and what's most exciting to you now.

1:10:47.140 --> 1:10:50.940
 If you are able or willing to talk about

1:10:50.940 --> 1:10:52.460
 some of the work that's on the way,

1:10:52.460 --> 1:10:54.240
 I saw a brief mention of something

1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:57.160
 on your publication's website of a paper

1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:00.800
 about influencers, online influencers and nutrition.

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:02.600
 That might not be the main thrust of what you're up to,

1:11:02.600 --> 1:11:04.100
 but if you're able to tell us about it,

1:11:04.100 --> 1:11:04.940
 sort of interesting,

1:11:04.940 --> 1:11:06.560
 given that a lot of the communication

1:11:06.560 --> 1:11:09.480
 in and around this podcast takes place through social media.

1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:12.840
 And I've kind of launched into this landscape now

1:11:12.840 --> 1:11:16.480
 where I'm constantly bombarded with health information

1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:21.480
 and influencers, a term I didn't even know until a couple.

1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:22.560
 You are one.

1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:24.760
 Well, one could argue one way or the other,

1:11:24.760 --> 1:11:28.640
 but so what is the deal with influencers?

1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:31.080
 Are they doing something good for health information

1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:33.860
 or are they ruining the landscape?

1:11:33.860 --> 1:11:36.240
 And don't try and protect my feelings.

1:11:36.240 --> 1:11:39.840
 Because I now know that stress is actually an asset.

1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:44.540
 Yes, well, that work is part of a body of work

1:11:44.540 --> 1:11:47.460
 that we've been sort of venturing into,

1:11:47.460 --> 1:11:51.880
 which is to understand where do these mindsets come from?

1:11:51.880 --> 1:11:54.120
 I mentioned sort of public health entities

1:11:54.120 --> 1:11:58.640
 as one source of, say, our mindsets about stress.

1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:01.400
 But I think that our mindsets are influenced

1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:04.360
 by four different sources.

1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:06.160
 First is our upbringing,

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:09.180
 how our parents talked about things

1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:12.880
 like when we're stressed or food or other things.

1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:15.880
 Second is culture and media.

1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:20.880
 So movies, you know, podcasts, and now social media.

1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:26.480
 Third is influential others.

1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:29.920
 So what doctors say to us or close friends or peers.

1:12:29.920 --> 1:12:32.680
 And fourth is your conscious choice.

1:12:32.680 --> 1:12:34.920
 So, you know, we talked about that a little.

1:12:34.920 --> 1:12:37.720
 You do have, we have, as humans,

1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:40.400
 have the ability to be mindful of

1:12:40.400 --> 1:12:43.140
 and to change our mindsets.

1:12:43.140 --> 1:12:46.620
 But, you know, the social media and influencer stuff

1:12:46.620 --> 1:12:49.760
 has been, in part, an attempt to understand

1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:51.260
 where do our mindsets about things

1:12:51.260 --> 1:12:53.480
 like healthy foods come from?

1:12:53.480 --> 1:12:56.560
 And Brad Turnwald, who is a former grad student in my lab,

1:12:56.560 --> 1:12:59.360
 has done a series of really interesting studies on this,

1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:02.800
 showing that, you know, if you rate the nutritional quality

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:07.800
 of the, you know, top grossing movies in the last 20 years,

1:13:07.980 --> 1:13:10.180
 or you look at the Instagram accounts

1:13:10.180 --> 1:13:14.360
 of all the most influential people on Instagram,

1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:17.240
 what you, and you analyze the nutrition content

1:13:17.240 --> 1:13:20.400
 of what they're eating, what he's shown is that,

1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:22.000
 you know, depending on the study,

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:26.800
 70 to 90% of those movies or influencers

1:13:26.800 --> 1:13:31.760
 would fail the legal standards for advertising in the UK.

1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:35.400
 So they're putting out their nutrition contents

1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:37.600
 that are, you know, maybe not surprisingly,

1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:40.500
 but undeniably unhealthy.

1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:44.320
 And, you know, to me, that's interesting and important.

1:13:44.320 --> 1:13:48.280
 It shows that where are we getting this mindset

1:13:48.280 --> 1:13:51.000
 that, you know, those unhealthy foods

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.400
 are pleasurable, desirable.

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:55.600
 What's maybe even more interesting than that

1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:59.000
 is some of the work that he and others in our lab have done

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:02.280
 to show that the ways people are talking about

1:14:02.280 --> 1:14:04.360
 the foods they're eating really matter too.

1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:06.980
 So generally, what we found is that

1:14:06.980 --> 1:14:09.920
 when people talk about unhealthy foods,

1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:14.920
 they use a language that connotes a sense of excitement,

1:14:15.800 --> 1:14:20.200
 fun, sexiness, danger, indulgence,

1:14:20.200 --> 1:14:22.600
 basically anything good and desirable, right?

1:14:22.600 --> 1:14:24.800
 This would be like cookies, cakes, high sugar.

1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:25.640
 Sorry, yeah, sorry.

1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:26.480
 Just really unhealthy.

1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:29.360
 Like truly unhealthy foods or, yeah,

1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:32.520
 that's actually the objective,

1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:34.020
 what health means is challenging,

1:14:34.020 --> 1:14:35.640
 but yeah, high fat, high sugar.

1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:37.240
 I think there's pretty good agreement now

1:14:37.240 --> 1:14:39.720
 that excessive sugar isn't good.

1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:40.960
 And highly processed.

1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:42.360
 Yeah, highly processed excessive sugar.

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:43.720
 I think there's general consensus.

1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:45.420
 I'm sure someone will, if you're gonna come after anyone,

1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:47.780
 come after me, I'll stand behind that statement.

1:14:47.780 --> 1:14:50.600
 But on the other hand, when people are talking about,

1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:52.560
 if they do, which, you know,

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:54.500
 healthy foods aren't portrayed in media,

1:14:54.500 --> 1:14:57.900
 they aren't portrayed by influencers, rarely ever.

1:14:57.900 --> 1:15:00.120
 And when they are, they're often talked about

1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:04.160
 with language that conveys a sense of deprivation.

1:15:04.160 --> 1:15:07.800
 It's, you know, it's nutritious, but it's sort of boring.

1:15:07.800 --> 1:15:08.640
 It's bland.

1:15:08.640 --> 1:15:09.480
 It's less tasty.

1:15:09.480 --> 1:15:10.320
 Recovery from the holidays.

1:15:10.320 --> 1:15:11.760
 Sort of the post-holiday reset.

1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:12.600
 Exactly.

1:15:12.600 --> 1:15:13.440
 Right.

1:15:13.440 --> 1:15:16.440
 And this is really important because, you know,

1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:17.980
 you're doing all this work trying, you know,

1:15:17.980 --> 1:15:21.040
 and others are doing all this work trying to inform people

1:15:21.040 --> 1:15:23.120
 about what actually is good for them.

1:15:23.120 --> 1:15:27.960
 And meanwhile, there's this, you know, hurricane of other,

1:15:27.960 --> 1:15:31.300
 you know, a force that's telling people,

1:15:31.300 --> 1:15:34.400
 that's seeping into our minds that, sure,

1:15:34.400 --> 1:15:37.040
 those might be good for you, but those foods are not fun

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:39.340
 or sexy or indulgent or desirable

1:15:39.340 --> 1:15:41.440
 in any way, shape or form, right?

1:15:41.440 --> 1:15:45.680
 And it's also paid advertising for fast foods

1:15:45.680 --> 1:15:47.640
 and sugary beverages and other things.

1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:52.080
 So it's not surprising that we have this mindset

1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:55.120
 that healthy foods are the less desirable thing to eat

1:15:55.120 --> 1:15:58.140
 because of those cultural and social forces.

1:15:58.140 --> 1:16:01.800
 What our work has just tried to do is to reveal that,

1:16:01.800 --> 1:16:04.720
 you know, quantify it as a way to say,

1:16:04.720 --> 1:16:06.880
 all right, let's maybe be a little bit more mindful

1:16:06.880 --> 1:16:09.480
 about how we talk about healthy foods.

1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:12.280
 And could, you know, if you're a movie producer,

1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:16.040
 can you be a little bit more mindful to showcase healthy

1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:18.560
 and delicious foods and have the characters talk about them

1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:20.540
 in ways that are more appealing?

1:16:20.540 --> 1:16:25.360
 There's a lot of room for people who produce this content

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:28.880
 to have an impact, not just on, you know, what people do,

1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:31.800
 but what they think about the foods they're eating.

1:16:31.800 --> 1:16:32.680
 It's really interesting.

1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:35.320
 I hadn't thought about it until now,

1:16:35.320 --> 1:16:37.400
 but it makes sense that any food that's packaged

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:40.560
 and can be sold can be woven into a film

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:44.340
 or promoted by a celebrity influencer,

1:16:44.340 --> 1:16:46.960
 not a health influencer per se,

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:49.680
 but a celebrity influencer because they'll get paid, right?

1:16:49.680 --> 1:16:53.200
 It's part of the ecosystem that allows them an income

1:16:53.200 --> 1:16:55.660
 and it feeds back on sales to the company.

1:16:55.660 --> 1:16:59.940
 And whereas things that can't be commoditized,

1:16:59.940 --> 1:17:02.200
 it's more difficult, right?

1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:07.120
 It's hard to, whoever makes oranges and sells oranges

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:11.500
 is unlikely to promote oranges in a celebrity post

1:17:11.500 --> 1:17:13.600
 or in a movie because oranges can be purchased

1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:15.040
 from many, many sources.

1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:18.380
 There's no identifiable source of oranges

1:17:18.380 --> 1:17:20.960
 as there is with a packaged food, for instance.

1:17:20.960 --> 1:17:23.400
 Yeah, but the interesting thing we found in those studies

1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:27.520
 is that it wasn't driven by promoted content

1:17:27.520 --> 1:17:29.080
 or branded content.

1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:30.600
 There's some of that, certainly,

1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:34.440
 and yeah, all of the promoted and branded content

1:17:34.440 --> 1:17:37.240
 is usually for processed high-sugar foods,

1:17:37.240 --> 1:17:41.380
 but 90% or more of these foods that they were showing

1:17:41.380 --> 1:17:43.280
 were not promoted or branded.

1:17:43.280 --> 1:17:47.240
 And so there's a lot of flexibility

1:17:47.240 --> 1:17:51.680
 in what these producers or influencers could show

1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:54.160
 on their media, although it goes both ways, right?

1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:56.240
 It's not just the producers

1:17:56.240 --> 1:17:59.000
 and the influencers' responsibility.

1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:01.920
 The public is reacting to this and we showed too

1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:05.560
 that people respond more positively.

1:18:05.560 --> 1:18:10.120
 They're more likes on posts about unhealthy foods.

1:18:10.120 --> 1:18:15.120
 So it's a, yeah, it's a sort of distasteful

1:18:15.120 --> 1:18:20.120
 and it's a distasteful culture around healthy eating

1:18:20.560 --> 1:18:23.160
 and we really have a lot to do to change it.

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:25.640
 Yeah, well, it's dopamine circuits through and through,

1:18:25.640 --> 1:18:28.880
 just the sight of some very calorie-dense,

1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:33.880
 extremely tasty food drives those dopamine circuits.

1:18:35.900 --> 1:18:38.240
 And I realized that there are people out there

1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:42.040
 who derive the same sort of or similar levels of pleasure

1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:43.620
 from healthy foods and that's a wonderful thing

1:18:43.620 --> 1:18:44.640
 if one can accomplish that.

1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:47.000
 So we just need more of that is what it sounds like.

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.120
 Yeah, exactly, and that's what's really inspiring

1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:53.240
 to me at least is that it is possible, right?

1:18:53.240 --> 1:18:54.760
 I mean, people think, oh, well, vegetables

1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:57.280
 are just inherently less tasty than ice cream.

1:18:57.280 --> 1:18:59.600
 And it's like, well, that's not necessarily true.

1:18:59.600 --> 1:19:01.660
 Also, it doesn't have to be a competition, right?

1:19:01.660 --> 1:19:05.200
 I don't have to get my three-year-old to hate ice cream

1:19:05.200 --> 1:19:07.640
 in order for it to like broccoli.

1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:10.040
 There's a lot more I can be doing to help shape

1:19:10.040 --> 1:19:14.120
 a more positive, approach-oriented, indulgent mindset

1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:17.760
 around healthy, nutritious vegetables

1:19:17.760 --> 1:19:20.400
 and fruits and other foods, right?

1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:22.560
 In addition to having her like ice cream, right?

1:19:22.560 --> 1:19:23.800
 And that's totally fine.

1:19:23.800 --> 1:19:25.080
 Sounds like a really interesting study.

1:19:25.080 --> 1:19:26.960
 When it's published, will you just let me know and I'll-

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:28.920
 Yeah, I think it was actually released this week.

1:19:28.920 --> 1:19:30.440
 Oh, great. I will be sure to-

1:19:30.440 --> 1:19:31.960
 JAMA Internal Medicine.

1:19:31.960 --> 1:19:33.840
 JAMA Internal, okay.

1:19:33.840 --> 1:19:34.680
 Great journal.

1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:37.960
 I will definitely talk about it on social media

1:19:37.960 --> 1:19:39.980
 and elsewhere.

1:19:39.980 --> 1:19:41.040
 Sounds very interesting.

1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:42.980
 What else are you up to lately that's,

1:19:42.980 --> 1:19:45.240
 my favorite question to ask any scientist or colleague,

1:19:45.240 --> 1:19:47.920
 by the way, is what are you most excited about lately?

1:19:48.840 --> 1:19:51.520
 What are you up late thinking about

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:53.360
 and getting up early thinking about?

1:19:53.360 --> 1:19:56.160
 Yeah, so hands down the thing I'm most excited,

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:58.480
 well, I guess there's so many things.

1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:01.080
 The thing that I'm most into right now,

1:20:01.080 --> 1:20:02.860
 we're doing the most work in is, you know,

1:20:02.860 --> 1:20:04.800
 I started by getting inspired

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:07.140
 by placebo effects in medicine.

1:20:07.140 --> 1:20:11.200
 I did a long stint in placebo or belief-like effects

1:20:11.200 --> 1:20:12.640
 in behavioral health.

1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:15.480
 And now we're moving back into medicine.

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:17.840
 So I'm really interested in looking at

1:20:17.840 --> 1:20:22.320
 how we can work with active drugs and treatments

1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:26.180
 to make them better and make the experience of them better

1:20:26.180 --> 1:20:29.200
 by instilling different mindsets.

1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:31.360
 So one study we did along those lines,

1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:36.360
 we worked with kids undergoing treatment for food allergies,

1:20:36.600 --> 1:20:38.760
 so allergies to peanuts, for example.

1:20:38.760 --> 1:20:40.120
 This was with Kari Nadeau,

1:20:40.120 --> 1:20:42.640
 who's the head of the Stanford Allergy Center here.

1:20:42.640 --> 1:20:45.520
 She has a great treatment for food allergies.

1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:48.600
 Basically, kids take gradually increasing doses

1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:51.860
 of the thing they're allergic to, like peanuts.

1:20:51.860 --> 1:20:54.560
 And over the course of six or seven months,

1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:59.560
 these kids become, you know, less reactive to peanuts.

1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:01.800
 And the problem with that treatment

1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:05.200
 is it's really difficult

1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:08.160
 because they're having all sorts of negative symptoms

1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:09.420
 and side effects.

1:21:09.420 --> 1:21:12.800
 These kids are getting itchy mouths, an upset stomach,

1:21:12.800 --> 1:21:14.920
 they're puking, and it's scary

1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:17.640
 because they're literally eating the thing

1:21:17.640 --> 1:21:20.200
 that they've been told might kill them, right?

1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:21.960
 And what we did in the study

1:21:21.960 --> 1:21:24.560
 was we attempted to improve the experience

1:21:24.560 --> 1:21:28.880
 and outcomes of that by reframing mindsets

1:21:28.880 --> 1:21:31.560
 about the symptoms and the side effects.

1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:34.200
 So as it was being conducted before,

1:21:34.200 --> 1:21:36.200
 the kids were told, look,

1:21:36.200 --> 1:21:39.120
 these side effects are just an unfortunate byproduct

1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:40.880
 of this treatment,

1:21:40.880 --> 1:21:44.000
 and you have to sort of endure them to get through it.

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.280
 But what we found in our conversation with Kari

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:49.120
 was that the reality of those side effects

1:21:49.120 --> 1:21:50.640
 was not so negative.

1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:55.600
 In fact, they were mechanistically linked to the body

1:21:55.600 --> 1:21:59.280
 learning how to tolerate peanuts or the allergen.

1:21:59.280 --> 1:22:02.740
 And so what we did was we worked within a trial,

1:22:02.740 --> 1:22:04.640
 they were all getting the treatment,

1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:09.240
 but half of them helped to see this more positive mindset,

1:22:09.240 --> 1:22:12.240
 that symptoms and side effects from this treatment

1:22:12.240 --> 1:22:15.480
 were a positive signal that the treatment was working

1:22:15.480 --> 1:22:17.840
 and their bodies were getting stronger.

1:22:17.840 --> 1:22:19.920
 And what we found was that that mindset

1:22:19.920 --> 1:22:23.000
 led to reductions in anxiety,

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:26.000
 fewer symptoms when at the highest doses,

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.120
 and most interestingly of all, they had better outcomes.

1:22:30.120 --> 1:22:32.280
 So based on immune markers

1:22:32.280 --> 1:22:34.640
 that were a sign of the allergic tolerance,

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:36.280
 those who had this mindset throughout

1:22:36.280 --> 1:22:38.620
 had better outcomes to the treatment.

1:22:38.620 --> 1:22:40.120
 So that's just one example.

1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:43.560
 I think my goal is really to move us beyond

1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:48.560
 the placebo versus drug, mindset versus behavior,

1:22:50.280 --> 1:22:53.120
 to get to a place where we can blend them together

1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:56.000
 and maximize the benefit of these treatments.

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:59.000
 So we're doing a lot of studies like that,

1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:01.760
 how can we improve treatment for cancer

1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:03.460
 with different mindsets.

1:23:03.460 --> 1:23:07.560
 We've done some work recently with the COVID-19 vaccine

1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:10.280
 and symptoms and side effects.

1:23:10.280 --> 1:23:13.280
 So that's what I'm really passionate about right now.

1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:15.600
 Incredible.

1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:16.760
 I can't wait to read that study.

1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:18.960
 Is that one out or on the way?

1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:22.760
 Okay, well then I will also read and communicate with you

1:23:22.760 --> 1:23:24.040
 and then about that study, who knows,

1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:25.320
 maybe you would come on Instagram

1:23:25.320 --> 1:23:27.620
 and do a little Instagram live

1:23:27.620 --> 1:23:31.000
 to make sure that I don't screw up the delivery

1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.560
 and that we can hear it direct

1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:34.380
 from the person who ran the study.

1:23:34.380 --> 1:23:38.400
 I find this issue of side effects really interesting.

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:40.160
 I don't take a lot of prescription drugs,

1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:42.900
 but recently I was prescribed a few

1:23:42.900 --> 1:23:47.720
 and the list of side effects is, you know, it's incredible.

1:23:47.720 --> 1:23:49.240
 I mean, it just goes on and on and on.

1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:51.320
 I realized some of that is legal protections.

1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:53.240
 It's hard for me to believe that they're actually

1:23:53.240 --> 1:23:54.460
 expecting anyone to read those

1:23:54.460 --> 1:23:57.000
 because you need a high powered microscope

1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.480
 to read this print, it's truly fine print.

1:23:59.480 --> 1:24:02.640
 But I did realize that in reading over the side effects

1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:05.620
 that you prime, one primes themselves

1:24:05.620 --> 1:24:07.300
 to experience those side effects.

1:24:07.300 --> 1:24:09.440
 And so now I just rip up the side effects thing

1:24:09.440 --> 1:24:11.380
 and or the sheet and just throw it away.

1:24:11.380 --> 1:24:12.880
 I just take it as recommended.

1:24:14.260 --> 1:24:16.440
 Do you think it works in the other direction too?

1:24:16.440 --> 1:24:19.880
 Where if an effective medication

1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:23.680
 is supposed to have result A, B or C

1:24:23.680 --> 1:24:26.000
 and you are told again and again

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000
 how effective it is for that treatment,

1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:29.920
 that it could amplify the effect.

1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:33.120
 So in other words, it's not strictly a placebo.

1:24:33.120 --> 1:24:35.620
 It's not nocebo as you described before,

1:24:35.620 --> 1:24:38.160
 but that perhaps at a lower dose,

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:41.400
 a given medication could have a amplified effect

1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:44.280
 or at a appropriate dose, if you will,

1:24:44.280 --> 1:24:46.680
 it could have a super physiological effect.

1:24:46.680 --> 1:24:48.280
 Has that ever been demonstrated?

1:24:49.800 --> 1:24:52.560
 To some degree, I think where it gets tricky is

1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:55.320
 for a long time people thought the effects of placebos

1:24:55.320 --> 1:24:57.120
 were expectancy based.

1:24:57.120 --> 1:25:02.120
 So you expect to get a benefit and that benefit occurs.

1:25:02.420 --> 1:25:05.000
 There's certainly some truth to that,

1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:08.120
 but I think the mindset approach is more powerful

1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:11.020
 because it helps us understand the mechanisms, right?

1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:15.760
 So if you just expect that your blood pressure will go down,

1:25:18.400 --> 1:25:21.160
 what are the mechanisms through which that expectation

1:25:21.160 --> 1:25:23.280
 would lead to your blood pressure going down?

1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:26.320
 It's hard to even understand that, right?

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:31.320
 But if you have the mindset that you're in good hands,

1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:34.800
 that this is being taken care of,

1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:39.480
 that this illness is not going to kill you, right?

1:25:39.480 --> 1:25:41.880
 That you're being treated well.

1:25:41.880 --> 1:25:45.280
 Then you can start to unpack the mechanisms

1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:47.020
 through which blood pressure could be relieved.

1:25:47.020 --> 1:25:49.560
 Maybe it's anxiety reduction.

1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:53.920
 Maybe it's changing the sort of anticipation

1:25:53.920 --> 1:25:57.960
 or the prioritization of what the body needs to focus on.

1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:01.920
 And so I really think that the work of the future

1:26:01.920 --> 1:26:05.620
 needs to be on getting more sophisticated about

1:26:05.620 --> 1:26:07.520
 what is the mindset that we're instilling

1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:09.600
 when we say something will work or it won't work?

1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:12.260
 And how do we understand the mechanisms

1:26:12.260 --> 1:26:14.740
 through which that changes physiology?

1:26:14.740 --> 1:26:17.520
 So to answer your question, I think that that could be true,

1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:20.160
 but it depends on what actually is the mindset

1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:21.040
 you're evoking.

1:26:21.040 --> 1:26:24.040
 I know you're a parent,

1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:25.900
 and to the other parents out there,

1:26:25.900 --> 1:26:28.660
 but also to kids and people who don't have kids,

1:26:28.660 --> 1:26:32.000
 what is the best way to learn and teach mindsets?

1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.940
 I mean, clearly a conversation like this informs me

1:26:34.940 --> 1:26:37.680
 and many other people out there about mindsets

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:39.220
 and how we can adopt them.

1:26:39.220 --> 1:26:43.760
 But it also seems to me that if we have the opportunity

1:26:43.760 --> 1:26:47.200
 to teach mindsets and really cultivate certain mindsets,

1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:49.320
 that the world would be a much better place.

1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:50.240
 Yes.

1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:51.840
 How does one go about that?

1:26:51.840 --> 1:26:54.880
 Given that we're kids and we are all being bombarded

1:26:54.880 --> 1:26:56.540
 with conflicting information all the time,

1:26:56.540 --> 1:26:58.440
 how do we anchor to a mindset?

1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:04.280
 Yeah, and you're getting at my other major passion

1:27:04.280 --> 1:27:07.000
 right now, which is what we're calling in our lab,

1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:08.640
 meta mindset.

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:11.120
 I'm working on this with Chris Evans and others,

1:27:11.120 --> 1:27:14.240
 and that is how do we consciously

1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:17.080
 and deliberately change our mindsets?

1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:20.040
 And the first step is really simple,

1:27:20.040 --> 1:27:22.800
 and that's just to be aware that you have them,

1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:25.240
 that the world, your beliefs,

1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:28.520
 aren't sort of an unmitigated reflection of reality

1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:30.280
 as it objectively is.

1:27:30.280 --> 1:27:32.880
 They are filtered through our interpretations,

1:27:32.880 --> 1:27:36.080
 our expectations, our frameworks,

1:27:36.080 --> 1:27:38.540
 and simplifications of that reality.

1:27:38.540 --> 1:27:43.480
 And as your work and as you know so well,

1:27:43.480 --> 1:27:45.080
 most of what goes on in our brain

1:27:45.080 --> 1:27:47.700
 is an interpretation of reality.

1:27:47.700 --> 1:27:50.560
 Mindsets are just the simplified core assumptions

1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:51.840
 about things.

1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:56.180
 And the first step is to realize that we have them.

1:27:56.180 --> 1:27:59.260
 The second step is to start to think about

1:27:59.260 --> 1:28:02.280
 what the effects of those mindsets are on your life

1:28:02.280 --> 1:28:04.220
 to sort of play out the story, right?

1:28:04.220 --> 1:28:07.560
 Okay, I have this mindset that stress is debilitating.

1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:10.100
 How is that making me feel?

1:28:10.100 --> 1:28:11.680
 What is that leading me to do?

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:15.000
 Is this mindset helpful or harmful?

1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:17.240
 The question isn't is the mindset right or wrong?

1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:20.200
 Because you can find evidence for or against it.

1:28:20.200 --> 1:28:23.220
 We can fight about it till we're exhausted.

1:28:23.220 --> 1:28:26.960
 The question is is it helpful or harmful?

1:28:26.960 --> 1:28:31.080
 And then you can go about seeking out ways

1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:34.880
 to adopt more useful mindsets.

1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:36.960
 So we've been doing a lot of work

1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:38.320
 on how to actually do that.

1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:39.980
 How do you consciously change it?

1:28:39.980 --> 1:28:42.320
 Sometimes it's really simple.

1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:44.020
 I think in cases where we don't have

1:28:44.020 --> 1:28:45.220
 a lot of prior experience,

1:28:45.220 --> 1:28:50.220
 like the kids with allergies who are getting treatment,

1:28:50.240 --> 1:28:53.900
 they didn't have any other mindsets about symptoms.

1:28:53.900 --> 1:28:57.080
 So we just had the luxury of setting it, right?

1:28:57.080 --> 1:28:58.680
 When it comes to healthy food,

1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:01.500
 I think it's harder to change people's mindsets

1:29:01.500 --> 1:29:04.140
 because we have a lot of baggage weighing us down.

1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:09.960
 As a parent, for me, I guess my number one piece of advice

1:29:09.960 --> 1:29:14.300
 is to lighten up trying to get your kids

1:29:14.300 --> 1:29:18.980
 to do certain things and focus more on helping them

1:29:18.980 --> 1:29:22.080
 to adopt more adaptive mindsets.

1:29:22.080 --> 1:29:25.500
 So I'm by no means an expert at this,

1:29:25.500 --> 1:29:27.820
 but I'm testing it with my own child.

1:29:27.820 --> 1:29:31.480
 In real time, the real kind of experiment.

1:29:31.480 --> 1:29:36.280
 It's how do I resist the urge to force my child

1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:39.760
 to eat her dinner so that she can have her dessert, right?

1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:40.960
 Because that's the real urge.

1:29:40.960 --> 1:29:42.960
 It's like, no, you need to do that.

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:44.960
 Because when you start thinking about it

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:46.900
 in terms of mindset, you realize,

1:29:47.760 --> 1:29:50.320
 oh, that's just reinforcing to her

1:29:50.320 --> 1:29:53.560
 that the dessert is the exciting, fun thing to have.

1:29:53.560 --> 1:29:56.320
 And this thing that I have to do must be horrible,

1:29:56.320 --> 1:30:00.420
 so horrible that my parent is forcing me to do it, right?

1:30:00.420 --> 1:30:04.620
 So it's letting go a little bit of the behavior,

1:30:04.620 --> 1:30:05.920
 the objective reality,

1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:09.400
 and really thinking about the subjective reality

1:30:09.400 --> 1:30:12.800
 and focusing on adaptive mindsets.

1:30:12.800 --> 1:30:16.680
 So my goal as a parent has been to try to help her

1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:19.620
 instill a healthy mindset about eating,

1:30:19.620 --> 1:30:22.620
 that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious,

1:30:22.620 --> 1:30:25.580
 that the experience of stress is inevitable,

1:30:25.580 --> 1:30:29.240
 that it's natural and that it can help,

1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:32.040
 going through stressful experience can help her learn,

1:30:32.040 --> 1:30:36.080
 grow, and become a more connected and happier individual.

1:30:36.080 --> 1:30:39.380
 And with exercise and physical activity,

1:30:39.380 --> 1:30:40.720
 we haven't really gotten to that yet,

1:30:40.720 --> 1:30:43.080
 but we will with time.

1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:44.200
 Yeah, it's great.

1:30:44.200 --> 1:30:45.880
 I wrote down, and I'm going to keep this

1:30:45.880 --> 1:30:48.520
 in the front of my mind going forward,

1:30:48.520 --> 1:30:49.920
 to continually ask,

1:30:49.920 --> 1:30:52.560
 what is the effect of my mindset about X?

1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:54.800
 And just to evaluate that, about exercise,

1:30:54.800 --> 1:30:56.380
 about food, about school, about stress,

1:30:56.380 --> 1:31:00.080
 about relationships, about relationship to self, et cetera,

1:31:00.080 --> 1:31:03.000
 and to really think about that in a series of layers.

1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:05.200
 So you think that would be a useful exercise?

1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:06.020
 Definitely.

1:31:06.020 --> 1:31:08.000
 And you know, and your work speaks to the,

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.880
 I mean, the mindful, it's not,

1:31:10.880 --> 1:31:13.840
 I would, yeah, really urge against

1:31:13.840 --> 1:31:16.800
 people getting dogmatic about their mindset also, right?

1:31:16.800 --> 1:31:18.560
 Like, oh, I need to have the right mindset.

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:20.960
 And if I don't have the right, you know, it's like, okay.

1:31:20.960 --> 1:31:23.020
 Mindset is a piece of the puzzle.

1:31:23.020 --> 1:31:26.420
 It's a piece of the puzzle that's really empowering

1:31:26.420 --> 1:31:29.380
 because we have access to it and we can change it.

1:31:29.380 --> 1:31:31.240
 But it is just one piece of a puzzle.

1:31:31.240 --> 1:31:33.200
 So treat yourself like a scientist.

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:35.480
 Look at your life, look at your mindsets,

1:31:35.480 --> 1:31:38.400
 see what's serving you, see what isn't.

1:31:38.400 --> 1:31:42.240
 Find more useful, adaptive, and empowering mindsets

1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:45.720
 and live by those.

1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:46.720
 I love it.

1:31:46.720 --> 1:31:50.760
 Now, in one version of this kind of discussion,

1:31:50.760 --> 1:31:53.440
 I would have asked the question I'm gonna ask next

1:31:53.440 --> 1:31:55.440
 at the beginning, but I'm going to ask it

1:31:56.440 --> 1:32:00.260
 now close to the end, which is you're a unique constellation

1:32:00.260 --> 1:32:03.640
 of accomplishments and attributes.

1:32:03.640 --> 1:32:06.080
 And I only know a subset of them, of course,

1:32:06.080 --> 1:32:08.280
 because today's the first time that we've met in person,

1:32:08.280 --> 1:32:09.760
 even though I've known your work for a long time

1:32:09.760 --> 1:32:11.720
 and we're colleagues across campus.

1:32:11.720 --> 1:32:15.860
 So you run your laboratory where you do research.

1:32:15.860 --> 1:32:20.440
 You were also an athlete in university, a serious athlete.

1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:22.560
 And then you're also a clinical psychologist.

1:32:22.560 --> 1:32:23.840
 Is that right?

1:32:23.840 --> 1:32:25.600
 I was trained as a clinical psychologist.

1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:28.240
 So my PhD is in clinical psychology.

1:32:28.240 --> 1:32:33.240
 And I did, you know, all my pre and post internships

1:32:33.240 --> 1:32:35.520
 with stress and trauma.

1:32:35.520 --> 1:32:37.320
 Do you see patients or did you see patients at that time?

1:32:37.320 --> 1:32:39.320
 I did, yes, I don't anymore.

1:32:39.320 --> 1:32:41.520
 Okay, that's a very unique constellation

1:32:41.520 --> 1:32:43.580
 of practitioner and researcher.

1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:49.000
 So what are the mindsets that you try and adopt

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.940
 on a regular basis as a consequence

1:32:51.940 --> 1:32:53.480
 or in relation to those things,

1:32:53.480 --> 1:32:56.160
 sort of athlete, researcher, clinician?

1:32:56.160 --> 1:32:58.400
 You know, for yourself, as you move through life,

1:32:58.400 --> 1:33:00.680
 do you have an overarching mindset

1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:04.120
 that all challenge is good?

1:33:04.120 --> 1:33:06.800
 Or do you have any kind of central mindsets

1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:09.880
 that help you navigate through, you know,

1:33:09.880 --> 1:33:12.900
 has to be a pretty complex set of daily routines,

1:33:12.900 --> 1:33:14.520
 given everything that you juggle.

1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:17.440
 But I think that people like you are unique

1:33:17.440 --> 1:33:20.360
 in that you have the inside knowledge

1:33:20.360 --> 1:33:22.060
 of how this stuff works.

1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:24.300
 And you've also existed in these different domains.

1:33:24.300 --> 1:33:26.800
 And I know a lot of listeners have a more athletic

1:33:26.800 --> 1:33:30.940
 slant to their life or a more cognitive,

1:33:30.940 --> 1:33:32.740
 or some are raising kids or some people are just,

1:33:32.740 --> 1:33:34.980
 you know, are doing any number of things.

1:33:34.980 --> 1:33:36.460
 So this is where I think it would be useful

1:33:36.460 --> 1:33:38.540
 for people to hear, what do you do?

1:33:38.540 --> 1:33:39.980
 This is what I'm asking.

1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:42.380
 Yeah, well, it's certainly true in my case

1:33:42.380 --> 1:33:45.260
 that research is me-search, right?

1:33:45.260 --> 1:33:48.940
 Everything that I study as an intellectual

1:33:48.940 --> 1:33:53.220
 has come from my own experience or my own failings, right?

1:33:53.220 --> 1:33:58.220
 And when I was, you know, really intensely exercising

1:33:58.500 --> 1:34:01.820
 and training, those were the questions I asked.

1:34:01.820 --> 1:34:04.660
 When I was dealing with eating and, you know,

1:34:04.660 --> 1:34:07.700
 concerns about my weight, those were the questions I asked.

1:34:07.700 --> 1:34:10.940
 When I was stressed about my dissertation,

1:34:10.940 --> 1:34:13.580
 I decided to do my dissertation on stress, right?

1:34:13.580 --> 1:34:15.580
 You know, now I think we're in the midst

1:34:15.580 --> 1:34:17.260
 of a global pandemic.

1:34:17.260 --> 1:34:22.260
 It's, you know, how can our mindsets be useful here?

1:34:22.260 --> 1:34:24.220
 You know, so I, you know, I don't think

1:34:24.220 --> 1:34:27.660
 there's a obvious answer to your question

1:34:27.660 --> 1:34:30.700
 other than the guiding light for me

1:34:30.700 --> 1:34:35.140
 has been an undercurrent of understanding

1:34:35.140 --> 1:34:36.140
 that our mindsets matter.

1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:40.060
 I think I got that very clearly and deeply as a child,

1:34:40.060 --> 1:34:43.440
 both through my experiences as an athlete.

1:34:43.440 --> 1:34:45.940
 You know, I know many of your listeners are athletes.

1:34:45.940 --> 1:34:49.540
 Any athlete knows that you can be the same physical being

1:34:49.540 --> 1:34:52.060
 from one day to the next, one moment to the next,

1:34:52.060 --> 1:34:54.940
 and perform completely differently

1:34:54.940 --> 1:34:57.020
 just depending on what you're thinking.

1:34:57.020 --> 1:35:01.000
 I was a gymnast growing up, and if you can't visualize,

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:02.560
 if you can't see something in your mind,

1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:04.520
 then you have no chance when you get up there

1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:05.860
 on the balance beam, right?

1:35:05.860 --> 1:35:08.540
 And I also, my father was a martial artist,

1:35:08.540 --> 1:35:12.040
 a teacher of meditation, so this kind of mind-body work

1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:15.160
 was baked into me from an early age.

1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:17.020
 And I think what I've done recently

1:35:17.020 --> 1:35:19.960
 is to try to understand it scientifically,

1:35:19.960 --> 1:35:23.340
 and more importantly, to figure out

1:35:23.340 --> 1:35:26.540
 how can we do better with this, right?

1:35:26.540 --> 1:35:29.380
 How can we, you know, we're all talking about AI

1:35:29.380 --> 1:35:31.640
 taking over the world and technology this

1:35:31.640 --> 1:35:34.240
 and personalized medicine that, and it's like,

1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:38.600
 we have done so little, relatively so little

1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:43.340
 with the human resource, our human brains,

1:35:43.340 --> 1:35:48.340
 that the potential for which is so great.

1:35:48.340 --> 1:35:51.340
 And we've done almost nothing, you know,

1:35:51.340 --> 1:35:53.140
 take the placebo effect.

1:35:53.140 --> 1:35:55.420
 We know a lot about what it is.

1:35:55.420 --> 1:35:59.000
 We've done almost nothing to leverage that in medicine,

1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.760
 consciously and deliberately.

1:36:00.760 --> 1:36:04.500
 So my, what keeps me going,

1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:06.040
 what gets me through the hard times

1:36:06.040 --> 1:36:09.620
 is just that burning question of what is going on here

1:36:09.620 --> 1:36:13.040
 and what more can I do with the power of my mind?

1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:16.800
 Well, I and millions of other people are so grateful

1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:17.640
 that you do this work.

1:36:17.640 --> 1:36:20.140
 It's so important and it's truly unique.

1:36:20.140 --> 1:36:22.940
 Tell us where people can learn more about your research,

1:36:22.940 --> 1:36:24.500
 where they can find you online.

1:36:24.500 --> 1:36:26.180
 I'm gonna try and persuade you to take more

1:36:26.180 --> 1:36:29.380
 of a social media presence going forward,

1:36:29.380 --> 1:36:32.180
 but whether or not I succeed in that effort or not,

1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:34.020
 where can people find you?

1:36:34.020 --> 1:36:37.340
 Ask questions, find your papers, learn more.

1:36:37.340 --> 1:36:39.700
 I'd love to have you back for a conversation in the future,

1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:41.060
 but in the meantime.

1:36:41.060 --> 1:36:43.180
 Yeah, no, it's really, it's been such an honor

1:36:43.180 --> 1:36:44.820
 getting to chat with you on just,

1:36:44.820 --> 1:36:47.240
 you have such an impact on the world

1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:48.080
 and I look forward,

1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:50.180
 I hope we can do some science together also.

1:36:50.180 --> 1:36:51.020
 Absolutely, absolutely.

1:36:51.020 --> 1:36:55.540
 Yeah, all our papers and materials and interventions

1:36:55.540 --> 1:37:00.540
 are housed on our website, mbl.stanford.edu.

1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:03.020
 We also have a link there too,

1:37:03.020 --> 1:37:04.820
 that takes you to Stanford SPARK,

1:37:04.820 --> 1:37:07.520
 which stands for Social Psychological Answers

1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:08.900
 to Real World Questions.

1:37:08.900 --> 1:37:12.640
 We have a lot of toolkits on that website,

1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:16.140
 including a toolkit for this rethink stress approach

1:37:16.140 --> 1:37:20.460
 of acknowledging, welcoming, and utilizing your stress.

1:37:20.460 --> 1:37:24.860
 And then I guess I'm on Twitter, oleacross.

1:37:24.860 --> 1:37:28.080
 I don't do much there, but maybe I will start too.

1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:29.300
 Well, those are all great resources.

1:37:29.300 --> 1:37:31.060
 We will provide links to all of those

1:37:31.060 --> 1:37:32.920
 for our listeners and viewers.

1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:37.020
 And I also hope to convince you to write a book

1:37:37.020 --> 1:37:38.760
 or many books in the future.

1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:40.100
 The world needs to know about this,

1:37:40.100 --> 1:37:42.820
 but thank you so much for taking time

1:37:42.820 --> 1:37:44.700
 out of your exceedingly busy schedule

1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:46.620
 to talk to us about these ideas.

1:37:46.620 --> 1:37:47.460
 I learned so much.

1:37:47.460 --> 1:37:49.600
 I'm going to definitely think about

1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:52.300
 what is the effect of my mindset about blank

1:37:52.300 --> 1:37:54.340
 in every category of life,

1:37:54.340 --> 1:37:57.940
 and really just on behalf of everybody and myself.

1:37:57.940 --> 1:37:59.300
 Thank you so much.

1:37:59.300 --> 1:38:00.140
 Yeah, thank you.

1:38:00.140 --> 1:38:01.980
 And I guess I just want to end by saying,

1:38:01.980 --> 1:38:05.000
 I think this work is really the tip of the iceberg

1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.100
 of what can and should be done.

1:38:07.100 --> 1:38:10.820
 And so I really invite you, your listeners,

1:38:10.820 --> 1:38:13.800
 and anybody who's inspired by this work

1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:15.580
 if they want to share stories

1:38:15.580 --> 1:38:20.380
 or want to partner on a collaboration to please reach out.

1:38:20.380 --> 1:38:22.240
 Great, well, and the comment section on YouTube

1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:24.720
 is a great place to do that as well.

1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:25.780
 You will hear from them.

1:38:25.780 --> 1:38:26.620
 Great.

1:38:26.620 --> 1:38:27.460
 All right, great.

1:38:27.460 --> 1:38:28.340
 Thank you so much, Allie.

1:38:28.340 --> 1:38:29.180
 Thank you.

1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:31.860
 Thank you for joining me for my conversation

1:38:31.860 --> 1:38:33.060
 with Dr. Alia Crum.

1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:37.420
 I'm guessing by now you can appreciate the enormous impact

1:38:37.420 --> 1:38:40.900
 that mindsets have on our biology and our psychology

1:38:40.900 --> 1:38:44.540
 and how those interact at the level of mind and body.

1:38:44.540 --> 1:38:46.780
 If you'd like to learn more about Dr. Crum's work

1:38:46.780 --> 1:38:49.000
 and perhaps even be a research subject

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.540
 in one of their upcoming studies on mindsets,

1:38:51.540 --> 1:38:55.120
 you can go to mbl.stanford.edu.

1:38:55.120 --> 1:38:58.000
 There you will also see a tab for support,

1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.120
 where if you like, you can make a tax deductible donation

1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:02.860
 to support the incredible research

1:39:02.860 --> 1:39:05.040
 that Dr. Crum and her colleagues are doing.

1:39:05.040 --> 1:39:05.960
 If you're learning from

1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:08.120

 Please also check out our sponsors mentioned

1:39:33.540 --> 1:39:35.180
 at the beginning of this episode.

1:39:35.180 --> 1:39:37.380
 That's the best way to support this podcast.

1:39:37.380 --> 1:39:38.500
 We also have a Patreon.

1:39:38.500 --> 1:39:41.060
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:39:41.060 --> 1:39:42.860
 And there you can support the podcast

1:39:42.860 --> 1:39:44.560
 at any level that you like.

1:39:44.560 --> 1:39:47.020
 If you're not already following us on Instagram

1:39:47.020 --> 1:39:48.980
 and on Twitter, we are Huberman Lab

1:39:48.980 --> 1:39:50.460
 at both Instagram and Twitter.

1:39:50.460 --> 1:39:53.460
 And there I teach neuroscience in short form,

1:39:53.460 --> 1:39:55.780
 sometimes videos, sometimes text slides.

1:39:55.780 --> 1:39:57.300
 Some of that information overlaps

1:39:57.300 --> 1:39:58.660
 with what you find on the podcast.

1:39:58.660 --> 1:40:01.380
 Some of it is distinct from what you find on the podcast.

1:40:01.380 --> 1:40:03.860
 On previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

1:40:03.860 --> 1:40:05.380
 I often discuss supplements.

1:40:05.380 --> 1:40:08.380
 While supplements aren't necessary or used by everybody,

1:40:08.380 --> 1:40:11.180
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them.

1:40:11.180 --> 1:40:13.140
 An important consideration when using supplements

1:40:13.140 --> 1:40:16.440
 is that they be sourced from the highest quality sources.

1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:19.520
 For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:40:19.520 --> 1:40:21.340
 because Thorne supplements use the highest quality

1:40:21.340 --> 1:40:23.680
 ingredients and the greatest degree of precision

1:40:23.680 --> 1:40:25.140
 in terms of what's listed on the bottle

1:40:25.140 --> 1:40:27.820
 is actually what you will find in their products.

1:40:27.820 --> 1:40:29.620
 And that is not true for all supplement companies.

1:40:29.620 --> 1:40:31.180
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,

1:40:31.180 --> 1:40:34.420
 you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com

1:40:34.420 --> 1:40:36.980
 slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:40:36.980 --> 1:40:39.620
 And you can get 20% off any of those supplements.

1:40:39.620 --> 1:40:41.860
 In addition, if you navigate into the Thorne site

1:40:41.860 --> 1:40:45.100
 through that portal, thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

1:40:45.100 --> 1:40:47.780
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:40:47.780 --> 1:40:49.020
 that Thorne makes.

1:40:49.020 --> 1:40:50.620
 In closing, I'd like to thank you once again

1:40:50.620 --> 1:40:52.960
 for joining me for my discussion about mindsets

1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:54.700
 with Dr. Alia Crum.

1:40:54.700 --> 1:40:57.500
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:40:57.500 --> 1:41:07.500
 And I'll see you in the next one.
