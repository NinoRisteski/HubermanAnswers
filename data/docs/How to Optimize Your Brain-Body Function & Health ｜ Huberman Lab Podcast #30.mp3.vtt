00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.320 --> 00:10.280
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.280 --> 00:12.900
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.900 --> 00:15.040
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.040 --> 00:18.480
 Today, we continue in our discussion about sensation

00:18.480 --> 00:20.340
 or how we sense things.

00:20.340 --> 00:22.880
 On previous episodes, we talked about sensing light

00:22.880 --> 00:26.040
 and sound waves for things like vision and hearing.

00:26.040 --> 00:29.120
 Today, we are going to talk about our sense of self

00:29.120 --> 00:31.440
 or what's called interoception.

00:31.440 --> 00:35.320
 Interoception is our sensing of our internal landscape,

00:35.320 --> 00:39.640
 things like our heartbeat, our breathing, and our gut,

00:39.640 --> 00:41.960
 how full our gut might happen to be

00:41.960 --> 00:44.160
 or how empty our gut might happen to be,

00:44.160 --> 00:47.600
 but also our inner landscape with respect to chemistry,

00:47.600 --> 00:52.600
 how acidic or how good or bad we feel on the inside.

00:53.060 --> 00:55.440
 This discussion about sense of self and interoception

00:55.440 --> 00:57.840
 has many important actionable items

00:57.840 --> 01:00.920
 that relate to bodily health and brain health,

01:00.920 --> 01:02.440
 and believe it or not,

01:02.440 --> 01:07.440
 our ability to perform well or perform poorly in life.

01:07.500 --> 01:11.760
 Indeed, it has profound influence on our rates of healing.

01:11.760 --> 01:13.680
 So today we are going to talk about

01:13.680 --> 01:16.120
 all the aspects of our inner landscape

01:16.120 --> 01:18.000
 and how our brain and body communicate,

01:18.000 --> 01:20.320
 and there will be many actionable protocols

01:20.320 --> 01:22.200
 as we go along that discussion.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.760
 Before we begin our discussion about sense of self,

01:24.760 --> 01:26.480
 I want to highlight some very recently

01:26.480 --> 01:28.200
 published research findings

01:28.200 --> 01:31.780
 that I believe are immediately actionable

01:31.780 --> 01:33.960
 and that everybody should be aware of.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.820
 These are data that were published by my colleague,

01:35.820 --> 01:37.420
 Justin Sonnenberg's laboratory

01:37.420 --> 01:39.440
 at Stanford University School of Medicine,

01:39.440 --> 01:41.880
 and the data were published in the journal Cell,

01:41.880 --> 01:45.600
 which is a very, very high stringency cell press journal.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.660
 So phenomenal data.

01:47.660 --> 01:49.280
 What the study showed

01:49.280 --> 01:52.340
 was that individuals given a high fiber diet

01:53.320 --> 01:55.520
 actually experience less diversity

01:55.520 --> 01:57.840
 of what's called the gut microbiome.

01:57.840 --> 02:00.640
 The number of positive or health promoting bacteria

02:00.640 --> 02:04.060
 in the gut was actually reduced by a high fiber diet.

02:04.060 --> 02:07.360
 Whereas individuals that ate just a couple of servings

02:07.360 --> 02:09.360
 of fermented food each day

02:09.360 --> 02:13.360
 experience important and beneficial increases

02:13.360 --> 02:15.240
 in anti-inflammatory markers,

02:15.240 --> 02:17.800
 and that could be traced back to improvements

02:17.800 --> 02:20.500
 in the gut microbiome diversity.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.200
 The diversity of bugs,

02:22.200 --> 02:24.480
 literally little bacteria that live in the gut,

02:24.480 --> 02:25.400
 which might sound bad,

02:25.400 --> 02:28.240
 but they are actually very health promoting.

02:28.240 --> 02:31.160
 I'm going to get into all the details of this study

02:31.160 --> 02:32.520
 later in the episode,

02:32.520 --> 02:34.640
 but I just wanted to emphasize these findings

02:34.640 --> 02:36.640
 because they are immediately actionable.

02:36.640 --> 02:37.560
 I think for most people,

02:37.560 --> 02:40.000
 ingesting one or two servings of fermented food each day

02:40.000 --> 02:43.360
 is reasonable and does not bring with it

02:43.360 --> 02:46.440
 tremendous costs or tremendous inconvenience.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.300
 And I think many people are ingesting high fiber diets,

02:49.300 --> 02:50.880
 thinking that that's the best way

02:50.880 --> 02:52.960
 to improve their gut microbiome.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.200
 So while these data may prove to be controversial

02:55.200 --> 02:58.640
 among the folks out there in the nutrition community

02:58.640 --> 03:00.760
 that really promote high fiber diet,

03:00.760 --> 03:02.800
 I want to just emphasize that these data

03:02.800 --> 03:04.720
 were looked at in a very unbiased way.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.000
 They were done with large scale screens

03:07.000 --> 03:09.120
 of all sorts of inflammatory markers.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.240
 There was no specific hypothesis going in,

03:11.240 --> 03:12.840
 it was purely exploratory,

03:12.840 --> 03:15.280
 but the data are very, very clear.

03:15.280 --> 03:16.800
 It doesn't mean you shouldn't eat fiber,

03:16.800 --> 03:18.400
 doesn't mean that fiber is bad,

03:18.400 --> 03:20.520
 but it really shows that eating fermented foods,

03:20.520 --> 03:22.200
 just one or two servings a day,

03:22.200 --> 03:24.960
 and maybe even ramping up to three or four servings per day

03:24.960 --> 03:27.960
 can be very beneficial for many aspects of health.

03:27.960 --> 03:29.200
 Before we go any further,

03:29.200 --> 03:30.840
 I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

03:30.840 --> 03:33.560
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:33.560 --> 03:36.000
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:36.000 --> 03:38.960
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:38.960 --> 03:41.780
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:41.780 --> 03:42.860
 In keeping with that theme,

03:42.860 --> 03:45.760
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.720
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.800
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

03:49.800 --> 03:52.420
 that are of the absolutely highest quality.

03:52.420 --> 03:54.660
 The company was founded by two all-American swimmers

03:54.660 --> 03:55.500
 from Stanford,

03:55.500 --> 03:58.120
 and everything about their sunglasses and eyeglasses

03:58.120 --> 04:00.740
 is developed with performance in mind.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.160
 I've spent my career working on the visual system

04:03.160 --> 04:05.440
 and its various functionings within the brain

04:05.440 --> 04:07.120
 and within the eye.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.960
 Roca sunglasses and eyeglasses are so phenomenal

04:09.960 --> 04:11.840
 because they allow the visual system

04:11.840 --> 04:13.120
 to do what it does best,

04:13.120 --> 04:14.840
 which is to adjust to changes

04:14.840 --> 04:17.200
 in what we call luminance or brightness.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.800
 With many sunglasses out there

04:18.800 --> 04:21.180
 and with many eyeglasses as well,

04:21.180 --> 04:23.440
 if the brightness in the room changes

04:23.440 --> 04:26.560
 or you get cloud cover or you walk into a shadow,

04:26.560 --> 04:28.080
 you have to take the glasses on or off,

04:28.080 --> 04:29.560
 you can't see as well.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.120
 But the folks at Roca really understand

04:31.120 --> 04:32.280
 how the visual system works,

04:32.280 --> 04:34.680
 and so they've designed their sunglasses and eyeglasses

04:34.680 --> 04:36.760
 such that you never experienced that shift.

04:36.760 --> 04:37.960
 You can walk into a shadow,

04:37.960 --> 04:39.300
 the amount of sunlight can change,

04:39.300 --> 04:41.140
 you can go into a dark room, et cetera,

04:41.140 --> 04:42.400
 provided there's enough light to see,

04:42.400 --> 04:45.180
 you're going to see everything crystal clear.

04:45.180 --> 04:46.720
 In addition, you see everything crystal clear

04:46.720 --> 04:49.000
 because the lens quality is terrific.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.460
 And the sunglasses and eyeglasses are very lightweight,

04:51.460 --> 04:53.640
 so you don't even notice that they're on your face.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.480
 Also, the sunglasses and eyeglasses

04:55.480 --> 04:56.720
 are designed for performance.

04:56.720 --> 04:59.440
 You can use them while running or while cycling.

04:59.440 --> 05:01.320
 Even if you sweat, they won't slip off your face,

05:01.320 --> 05:03.840
 and as I mentioned before, they're very lightweight.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.760
 So everything about these glasses is terrific,

05:05.760 --> 05:07.840
 and they have a terrific aesthetic.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.760
 They have a lot of different styles to select from,

05:09.760 --> 05:12.760
 and unlike a lot of performance eyeglasses out there,

05:12.760 --> 05:14.120
 they won't make you look like a cyborg.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.900
 You could wear them to dinner or to somebody's home,

05:15.900 --> 05:17.140
 and they look really nice.

05:17.140 --> 05:18.600
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

05:18.600 --> 05:21.640

 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.600
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.040
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

05:35.040 --> 05:37.680
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

05:37.680 --> 05:40.000
 to help you better meet your health goals.

05:40.000 --> 05:42.560
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done

05:42.560 --> 05:45.320
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

05:45.320 --> 05:47.420
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

05:47.420 --> 05:49.800
 can only be assessed, can only be measured

05:49.800 --> 05:51.440
 from a quality blood test.

05:51.440 --> 05:54.040
 And now with the advent of quality DNA tests,

05:54.040 --> 05:56.120
 you can get further insight into the status

05:56.120 --> 05:58.400
 of your immediate and long-term health.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.560
 One of the problems with a lot of blood and DNA tests

06:00.560 --> 06:03.100
 that are out there, however, is you get the numbers back,

06:03.100 --> 06:06.040
 you get the levels of metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,

06:06.040 --> 06:08.240
 but you don't get any information about what to do

06:08.240 --> 06:10.420
 with those numbers or how to actually shift them

06:10.420 --> 06:12.400
 in the direction that you want to.

06:12.400 --> 06:13.680
 With Inside Tracker,

06:13.680 --> 06:16.440
 they have this very easy to use dashboard,

06:16.440 --> 06:17.980
 and that dashboard makes it very clear

06:17.980 --> 06:20.600
 not just what your levels of hormones, et cetera, are,

06:20.600 --> 06:24.440
 but what actions to take in terms of nutrition or exercise

06:24.440 --> 06:26.800
 or other lifestyle factors to bring those numbers

06:26.800 --> 06:29.220
 into the appropriate ranges for you.

06:29.220 --> 06:30.660
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

06:30.660 --> 06:33.440
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman,

06:33.440 --> 06:34.360
 and if you do that,

06:34.360 --> 06:37.300
 you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

06:37.300 --> 06:39.700
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.440
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman

06:42.440 --> 06:45.880
 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.960
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.480
 Headspace is a meditation app

06:50.480 --> 06:53.520
 that's backed by 25 peer-reviewed published studies

06:53.520 --> 06:56.820
 and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

06:56.820 --> 06:59.360
 I started meditating when I was in my teens,

06:59.360 --> 07:00.180
 but for many years,

07:00.180 --> 07:02.720
 I found it hard to maintain a meditation practice.

07:02.720 --> 07:03.880
 I don't think I'm alone with that.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.820
 I think many people start meditating.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.480
 They'll do it for a few weeks or a few months

07:07.480 --> 07:08.720
 or maybe even a year,

07:08.720 --> 07:10.760
 and then they'll give up the meditation practice.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.160
 And we know from so many peer-reviewed studies

07:13.160 --> 07:16.780
 that meditation has a number of very positive effects

07:16.780 --> 07:17.620
 on our brain health,

07:17.620 --> 07:18.760
 our ability to focus,

07:18.760 --> 07:19.800
 and our bodily health.

07:19.800 --> 07:20.640
 So it's a great thing.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.800
 We probably should all be doing it,

07:21.800 --> 07:23.680
 but most of us, including myself,

07:23.680 --> 07:26.640
 have found it hard to stick to a meditation practice.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.400
 Then I started using the Headspace app,

07:28.400 --> 07:30.480
 and what I found is I could be very consistent

07:30.480 --> 07:31.640
 with my meditation practice

07:31.640 --> 07:35.240
 because they have meditations that are short,

07:35.240 --> 07:36.880
 meditations that are medium length,

07:36.880 --> 07:38.540
 and meditations that are a bit longer,

07:38.540 --> 07:40.480
 all of which benefit me.

07:40.480 --> 07:43.080
 The meditations that they have also are of different styles.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.360
 You can try different forms of meditation.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.820
 I particularly like having a guide for my meditation.

07:47.820 --> 07:49.080
 It just helps me stay focused,

07:49.080 --> 07:50.240
 helps me stay on track,

07:50.240 --> 07:52.880
 and I'm able to derive all those regular benefits

07:52.880 --> 07:56.520
 of meditation and keep the practice up on a regular basis.

07:56.520 --> 07:57.720
 If you want to try Headspace,

07:57.720 --> 08:00.720
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.580
 And if you do that,

08:01.580 --> 08:04.080
 you'll get a one month totally free trial.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.700
 And with that, you'll get all of Headspace's meditations,

08:06.700 --> 08:08.360
 the full library of meditations.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.440
 You just go to headspace.com slash special offer,

08:11.440 --> 08:14.360
 and you get all of their meditations for one free month,

08:14.360 --> 08:15.200
 and you get to try it.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.320
 If you don't like it, you can stop,

08:16.320 --> 08:17.680
 but I think you will enjoy it.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.940
 I certainly enjoy meditation,

08:18.940 --> 08:21.880
 and we know that it's very beneficial for all of us.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.740
 If you're somebody who cares about your immediate

08:23.740 --> 08:25.120
 and long-term health,

08:25.120 --> 08:27.360
 and if you're somebody who's interested in performance

08:27.360 --> 08:31.120
 of any kind in work, in relationships, et cetera,

08:31.120 --> 08:32.420
 today's topic, I believe,

08:32.420 --> 08:35.280
 is among the more important ones for you.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.300
 Of all the topics I could cover,

08:37.300 --> 08:39.380
 this thing that we call sense of self,

08:39.380 --> 08:41.640
 which is also called interoception,

08:41.640 --> 08:45.240
 has perhaps the most foundational level of importance

08:45.240 --> 08:48.400
 for all that we feel, all that we do,

08:48.400 --> 08:50.420
 and all that we are capable of doing.

08:50.420 --> 08:54.080
 In fact, I will go so far as to say that interoception,

08:54.080 --> 08:57.520
 or our ability to sense our inner real estate,

08:57.520 --> 08:59.480
 is right there next to sleep,

08:59.480 --> 09:02.160
 and perhaps one other feature of our health

09:02.160 --> 09:06.080
 and bodily function that primarily determine

09:06.080 --> 09:09.320
 how good we feel in the now, in the short term,

09:09.320 --> 09:10.840
 and in the long-term,

09:10.840 --> 09:14.660
 and sets the stage for everything we are capable of doing,

09:14.660 --> 09:16.400
 and if we don't take care of this thing

09:16.400 --> 09:18.420
 that we call interoception,

09:18.420 --> 09:20.540
 just like if we don't take care of sleep,

09:20.540 --> 09:23.940
 we cannot perform well and we will not remain healthy.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.840
 Interoception and sense of self

09:26.840 --> 09:28.600
 are essentially the same thing.

09:28.600 --> 09:30.680
 I will use those terms interchangeably,

09:30.680 --> 09:32.680
 at least for sake of today's discussion.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.880
 And I promise that if you can learn a little bit

09:35.880 --> 09:38.960
 about the mechanisms of self-sensing,

09:38.960 --> 09:42.040
 of understanding what's going on in your internal milieu,

09:42.040 --> 09:44.560
 as we say, your internal environment,

09:44.560 --> 09:48.020
 you will position yourself to do some very simple things

09:48.020 --> 09:51.040
 that can lead to outsize positive effects on everything,

09:51.040 --> 09:56.040
 from sleep, to body composition, to mental focus, to mood,

09:57.040 --> 09:58.640
 your ability to regulate stress,

09:58.640 --> 10:01.120
 and indeed even your ability to heal and recovery

10:01.120 --> 10:02.520
 from injuries of different kinds,

10:02.520 --> 10:04.360
 brain injury and bodily injury.

10:04.360 --> 10:07.400
 So sense of self is absolutely crucial.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.020
 It's sometimes called our sixth sense,

10:10.020 --> 10:12.200
 right alongside the other five senses,

10:12.200 --> 10:15.980
 like hearing, vision, touch, taste, smell, et cetera.

10:15.980 --> 10:18.320
 But sense of self is different.

10:18.320 --> 10:22.100
 Sense of self is really about what's going on internally

10:22.100 --> 10:24.400
 within the confines of our skin.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.920
 And it involves two key features

10:26.920 --> 10:28.800
 that if you can understand those features

10:28.800 --> 10:30.680
 and you understand what modulates

10:30.680 --> 10:33.920
 or changes our ability to sense those features,

10:33.920 --> 10:36.580
 there are a lot of things that you can do

10:36.580 --> 10:39.880
 in terms of how you structure your nutritional practices,

10:39.880 --> 10:42.920
 how you relate to your exercise practices,

10:42.920 --> 10:44.880
 perhaps even certain things that you take

10:44.880 --> 10:46.200
 in terms of supplementation

10:46.200 --> 10:48.780
 that can basically make you feel better,

10:48.780 --> 10:52.000
 more alert, and more capable for everything.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.320
 I don't think that's a hyperbolic statement.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.200
 In fact, I know it's not a hyperbolic statement

10:56.200 --> 10:59.000
 because we have a system in our body

10:59.000 --> 11:02.480
 that connects our brain to all of our bodily organs

11:02.480 --> 11:06.160
 and connects all of those bodily organs to our brain.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.700
 And that communication between brain and body

11:08.700 --> 11:12.480
 in both directions creates a situation

11:12.480 --> 11:15.440
 where either we are positioned to do things well

11:15.440 --> 11:17.800
 or we are positioned to do things poorly.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.980
 So I really want to dive in and dissect

11:19.980 --> 11:22.240
 what is this system of brain-body communication?

11:22.240 --> 11:23.080
 What does it look like?

11:23.080 --> 11:25.000
 What are the actual neurons and connections?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.660
 And as I do that,

11:26.660 --> 11:28.840
 I promise that I'm going to place protocols,

11:28.840 --> 11:31.220
 tools that you can apply in order to make sure

11:31.220 --> 11:34.720
 that those neurons and connections are working optimally.

11:34.720 --> 11:38.780
 So let's begin by talking about what system

11:38.780 --> 11:40.580
 communicates the brain to the body

11:40.580 --> 11:42.340
 and the body back to the brain.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.680
 The system that's most often associated with this

11:45.680 --> 11:49.500
 is our 10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.720
 The word vagus relates to the word vagabond,

11:52.720 --> 11:53.720
 which is to wander.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.480
 And indeed the vagus nerve is a vast,

11:57.480 --> 11:59.800
 enormous wandering set of nerves.

11:59.800 --> 12:00.760
 So it's not one nerve.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.500
 It's not like one fiber, one axon, as we say.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.160
 In the nervous system, we have these wires

12:05.160 --> 12:07.520
 we call axons that let neurons communicate.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.760
 It's a bunch of neurons and a bunch of wires

12:09.760 --> 12:10.600
 that go everywhere.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.520
 So where do they go?

12:11.520 --> 12:15.600
 Well, they leave the brain and the brainstem.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.380
 The brainstem is kind of the back of your brain.

12:17.380 --> 12:18.500
 If you touch the back of your neck,

12:18.500 --> 12:22.020
 it's about three inches deep to where you're touching.

12:22.020 --> 12:25.280
 The neurons that are there send information

12:25.280 --> 12:28.840
 into the body to control your bodily organs.

12:28.840 --> 12:31.660
 How fast your heart is beating, how fast you're breathing,

12:31.660 --> 12:34.040
 how fast your digestion is occurring.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.800
 Even things like whether or not you are going to secrete

12:36.800 --> 12:40.340
 so-called killer cells, your immune cells from your spleen

12:40.340 --> 12:42.920
 to go ward off bacteria.

12:42.920 --> 12:45.580
 Now, the neurons there don't know what to do

12:45.580 --> 12:48.000
 unless they receive information about what's going on

12:48.000 --> 12:49.120
 within the body.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.160
 And within the body, your heart, your lungs, your diaphragm,

12:52.160 --> 12:54.560
 your gut, so everything from your intestines

12:54.560 --> 12:56.880
 to your stomach, et cetera, and your spleen

12:56.880 --> 12:59.680
 are sending information also up to the brain.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.480
 So as I mentioned before, it's a two-way street.

13:02.480 --> 13:05.240
 So the vagus nerve is a very important nerve,

13:05.240 --> 13:08.240
 but just by saying vagus nerve, it sounds like a singular.

13:08.240 --> 13:09.600
 It sounds like one thing.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.180
 But actually what we're talking about

13:11.180 --> 13:12.780
 is a series of super highways.

13:12.780 --> 13:13.740
 It's like Google maps.

13:13.740 --> 13:16.400
 It's got stuff going everywhere with alternate routes,

13:16.400 --> 13:17.920
 communicating back and forth.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.680
 There are two fundamental features

13:21.680 --> 13:23.920
 of what's going on in your body

13:23.920 --> 13:26.200
 that need to be communicated to your brain,

13:26.200 --> 13:27.960
 these neurons in your brainstem,

13:27.960 --> 13:29.560
 in order for your brain and your body

13:29.560 --> 13:31.600
 to work together correctly.

13:31.600 --> 13:35.360
 And the two types of information are mechanical information.

13:35.360 --> 13:39.960
 So things like pressure, things like lack of pressure,

13:39.960 --> 13:44.280
 and chemical information, whether or not your gut is acidic

13:44.280 --> 13:46.600
 or whether or not it's not acidic,

13:46.600 --> 13:49.200
 whether or not you have some sort of pathogen,

13:49.200 --> 13:50.640
 you know, something that you ate

13:50.640 --> 13:54.120
 or that got into your body somehow and is making you sick,

13:54.120 --> 13:57.080
 or whether or not you don't have a pathogen in your body.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.960
 So you've got mechanical sensing and chemical sensing.

13:59.960 --> 14:02.080
 So when you think about your sense of self

14:02.080 --> 14:04.680
 and your ability to understand what's going on in your body,

14:04.680 --> 14:07.000
 if you feel good or if you feel bad,

14:07.000 --> 14:08.480
 your sense of self is dependent

14:08.480 --> 14:13.000
 on these mechanical phenomenon and these chemical phenomenon.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.920
 And for every organ in your body,

14:15.920 --> 14:18.040
 whether or not that's your heart or your lungs

14:18.040 --> 14:21.680
 or your spleen, both the mechanical information

14:21.680 --> 14:23.960
 about that organ, for instance,

14:23.960 --> 14:28.140
 is if your gut is full or empty,

14:28.140 --> 14:30.820
 whether or not your heart is beating fast or beating slowly,

14:30.820 --> 14:33.640
 that's mechanical, and chemical information,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.280
 whether or not your gut feels nice

14:35.280 --> 14:37.000
 and whether, you know, when I say nice,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.540
 I mean whether or not it has a balance of acidity

14:39.540 --> 14:41.920
 and alkalinity that feels right to you

14:41.920 --> 14:43.720
 or whether or not your gut feels off,

14:43.720 --> 14:47.720
 it doesn't feel quite right, that's chemical information.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.320
 If you are not getting enough oxygen

14:50.320 --> 14:53.500
 and levels of carbon dioxide and other gas go up too high,

14:53.500 --> 14:56.040
 so your lungs can register that

14:56.040 --> 14:59.000
 and that chemical information is sent to your brain

14:59.000 --> 15:00.740
 and then your brain does certain things,

15:00.740 --> 15:03.600
 actually it really encourages you to do certain things

15:03.600 --> 15:05.640
 in order to adjust that chemistry.

15:05.640 --> 15:08.960
 So the first principle that everyone should understand

15:08.960 --> 15:12.080
 about their sense of self is that they are sensing

15:12.080 --> 15:14.040
 mechanical and chemical information

15:14.040 --> 15:18.060
 about every organ in their body, except for one,

15:18.060 --> 15:19.500
 and that's the brain.

15:19.500 --> 15:22.200
 Your brain actually doesn't have pain receptors,

15:22.200 --> 15:24.000
 it doesn't even have touch receptors,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.800
 the brain is a command center,

15:25.800 --> 15:29.160
 it helps drive and govern changes in the organs of the body,

15:29.160 --> 15:30.920
 but your brain doesn't move, at least not much,

15:30.920 --> 15:33.480
 it can move a little bit, fluid moves within it,

15:33.480 --> 15:36.440
 but as long as you're healthy, it's not moving that much.

15:36.440 --> 15:39.340
 Your brain has no sensation of its own,

15:39.340 --> 15:41.920
 in fact, when they do brain surgery on people,

15:41.920 --> 15:45.040
 they will anesthetize or put some anesthesia on the scalp,

15:45.040 --> 15:46.040
 they'll cut away the skin there

15:46.040 --> 15:47.640
 so that people don't feel anything,

15:47.640 --> 15:50.200
 they'll use some anesthesia, they'll peel back the skin,

15:50.200 --> 15:53.640
 and then they'll use a, well, let's call it what it is,

15:53.640 --> 15:54.640
 it's a bone saw,

15:54.640 --> 15:57.960
 and they basically saw open a little window in the skull,

15:57.960 --> 16:00.000
 I've actually done this before and seen this before,

16:00.000 --> 16:01.800
 I've done this many times before,

16:01.800 --> 16:03.940
 and once you're inside the brain,

16:03.940 --> 16:05.760
 you can put electrodes in there

16:05.760 --> 16:07.640
 and you can put various things in there,

16:07.640 --> 16:09.800
 of course, all for therapeutic purposes,

16:09.800 --> 16:12.060
 and you do that without any anesthesia

16:12.060 --> 16:13.220
 to the actual brain tissue,

16:13.220 --> 16:17.120
 because it has no receptors to sense anything,

16:17.120 --> 16:18.920
 it doesn't have pain receptors,

16:18.920 --> 16:21.160
 it doesn't have pressure receptors, none of that,

16:21.160 --> 16:22.040
 when you have a headache

16:22.040 --> 16:24.520
 and your head feels like there's too much pressure,

16:24.520 --> 16:27.720
 well, that's because of receptors that lie outside the brain

16:27.720 --> 16:29.800
 so your organs are different,

16:29.800 --> 16:32.040
 they need to tell your brain what's going on,

16:32.040 --> 16:35.900
 and there are ways that you can control the mechanical

16:35.900 --> 16:38.480
 and the chemical state of your organs

16:38.480 --> 16:40.700
 in ways that are very powerful,

16:40.700 --> 16:42.120
 and this is crucial to do

16:42.120 --> 16:45.080
 because if you can properly regulate

16:45.080 --> 16:48.280
 the mechanical and chemical environment of your body,

16:48.280 --> 16:49.960
 your brain functions better,

16:50.840 --> 16:52.940
 this is absolutely clear from data

16:52.940 --> 16:54.320
 that if your gut is healthy,

16:54.320 --> 16:57.720
 if you get the alkalinity right, the acidity right,

16:57.720 --> 16:59.680
 and if your spleen is healthy and happy,

16:59.680 --> 17:01.800
 and if your lungs are working properly,

17:01.800 --> 17:04.180
 not just breathing and pumping in and out air,

17:04.180 --> 17:05.640
 but you're breathing at the right cadence

17:05.640 --> 17:07.200
 for a particular activity,

17:07.200 --> 17:09.700
 then your brain will function better,

17:09.700 --> 17:12.960
 so let's talk about how you can adjust the mechanical

17:12.960 --> 17:15.280
 and chemical environment of your organs

17:15.280 --> 17:16.840
 in order to make your brain better,

17:16.840 --> 17:19.400
 and how your brain can make the mechanical

17:19.400 --> 17:23.540
 and chemical environment within your organs function better,

17:23.540 --> 17:25.260
 for instance, we're going to talk about

17:25.260 --> 17:27.920
 how you can change the chemistry of your gut

17:27.920 --> 17:30.640
 in order for your brain to be able to focus better,

17:30.640 --> 17:33.280
 think better, remember better, and sleep better,

17:33.280 --> 17:35.420
 and we're going to talk about how you can change

17:35.420 --> 17:37.920
 the chemistry of other organs in your body

17:37.920 --> 17:40.080
 such that your immune system will function better

17:40.080 --> 17:41.120
 than it would otherwise,

17:41.120 --> 17:42.880
 and you can actually heal faster

17:42.880 --> 17:44.500
 from small cuts and bruises,

17:44.500 --> 17:47.920
 but also injuries of any kind, even major injuries,

17:47.920 --> 17:51.920
 so as I mentioned before, we've got these organs,

17:51.920 --> 17:54.160
 the heart, the lungs, the diaphragm,

17:54.160 --> 17:57.800
 and I'll explain what that is, the gut and the spleen,

17:57.800 --> 17:59.540
 and the spleen is this immune organ,

17:59.540 --> 18:02.520
 let's take one example of these

18:02.520 --> 18:05.980
 and explain how mechanical and chemical information

18:05.980 --> 18:08.780
 from this particular set of organs

18:08.780 --> 18:10.040
 communicates to the brain

18:10.040 --> 18:12.460
 and how that changes how our brain works,

18:12.460 --> 18:15.080
 and the organ I'd like to focus on first

18:15.080 --> 18:17.560
 are the lungs and the diaphragm,

18:17.560 --> 18:18.800
 so we're all familiar with our lungs,

18:18.800 --> 18:20.160
 these two big bags of air,

18:20.160 --> 18:21.520
 but they're actually not two big bags of air,

18:21.520 --> 18:23.880
 they actually have little tiny sacs within them,

18:23.880 --> 18:25.640
 actually millions of little sacs

18:25.640 --> 18:27.720
 called the avioli of the lungs,

18:27.720 --> 18:30.200
 the avioli of the lungs are like little tiny balloons

18:30.200 --> 18:31.200
 throughout our lungs,

18:31.200 --> 18:32.560
 and the more of those balloons we have,

18:32.560 --> 18:34.320
 the more air that we can actually contain,

18:34.320 --> 18:37.700
 so we are not two big bags of air in there, our lungs,

18:37.700 --> 18:39.700
 we actually have millions and millions

18:39.700 --> 18:42.640
 of little tiny bags of air within those lungs,

18:42.640 --> 18:46.120
 those little bags of air can fill up

18:46.120 --> 18:47.660
 or they can deflate, right?

18:47.660 --> 18:49.680
 Just like your lungs overall can fill up

18:49.680 --> 18:51.200
 or they can deflate,

18:51.200 --> 18:52.720
 the diaphragm is a muscle,

18:52.720 --> 18:54.640
 it's kind of shaped like a dome,

18:54.640 --> 18:55.860
 so it's kind of a, you know,

18:55.860 --> 18:58.860
 think about a basketball or a soccer ball

18:58.860 --> 19:01.320
 that has most of the air pushed out of it,

19:01.320 --> 19:04.080
 and so it's kind of crescent shape or dome shaped,

19:04.080 --> 19:06.120
 and it sits below our lungs,

19:06.120 --> 19:08.460
 and the way the diaphragm and the lungs work together

19:08.460 --> 19:09.460
 is very interesting,

19:09.460 --> 19:11.360
 the diaphragm is actually skeletal muscle,

19:11.360 --> 19:13.560
 so it's just like a bicep or a quadricep,

19:13.560 --> 19:16.160
 and the fact that it is skeletal muscle is important

19:16.160 --> 19:18.640
 because it has a unique property,

19:18.640 --> 19:21.120
 which is that you can control it voluntarily,

19:21.120 --> 19:24.180
 you can decide to take control of your diaphragm

19:24.180 --> 19:25.560
 by just consciously deciding

19:25.560 --> 19:27.420
 you want to breathe in a particular way,

19:27.420 --> 19:30.080
 just like you can take conscious control over your legs,

19:30.080 --> 19:31.060
 they will work just fine

19:31.060 --> 19:32.760
 if you're not thinking about them as you walk,

19:32.760 --> 19:34.460
 as provided you already know how to walk,

19:34.460 --> 19:36.800
 but at any moment you can decide to change the rate

19:36.800 --> 19:40.080
 of your walking, your so-called cadence of walking,

19:40.080 --> 19:42.280
 so the diaphragm as a skeletal muscle

19:42.280 --> 19:43.680
 also has that property,

19:43.680 --> 19:45.320
 the diaphragm moves up and down

19:45.320 --> 19:46.780
 depending on how you breathe,

19:46.780 --> 19:50.620
 or rather I should say how the diaphragm moves up and down

19:50.620 --> 19:51.940
 determines how you breathe,

19:51.940 --> 19:54.020
 how you breathe is also dependent on little muscles

19:54.020 --> 19:55.380
 that are between your ribs,

19:56.240 --> 19:58.160
 the intercostals and other muscles,

19:58.160 --> 19:59.600
 if you're a martial arts fan,

19:59.600 --> 20:00.920
 Bruce Lee was famous for having

20:00.920 --> 20:02.780
 these very pronounced intercostals

20:02.780 --> 20:06.820
 from doing all sorts of bridging exercise, et cetera,

20:06.820 --> 20:08.280
 but those are the muscles,

20:08.280 --> 20:10.600
 and we all have them even if some of us,

20:10.600 --> 20:14.740
 most of us don't have intercostals like Bruce Lee,

20:14.740 --> 20:17.540
 so when you breathe, a couple of things happen,

20:17.540 --> 20:20.000
 but let's talk about the mechanical things first,

20:20.000 --> 20:22.860
 and then let's talk about how those mechanical steps

20:22.860 --> 20:26.520
 relate back to the brain and what that does for the brain,

20:26.520 --> 20:29.440
 and I can promise you that if you develop an awareness

20:29.440 --> 20:31.260
 of these mechanical changes,

20:31.260 --> 20:35.060
 you do not have to go through extensive breath work practice

20:35.060 --> 20:37.000
 or do extensive breath work,

20:37.000 --> 20:39.220
 you will immediately, believe it or not,

20:39.220 --> 20:42.960
 develop a sense of your breathing self,

20:42.960 --> 20:44.480
 of your lungs and diaphragm,

20:44.480 --> 20:46.760
 it takes no practice, but once you do it,

20:46.760 --> 20:48.020
 you will forever be changed

20:48.020 --> 20:49.820
 in terms of your awareness of your breathing

20:49.820 --> 20:51.780
 and your ability to leverage your breathing,

20:51.780 --> 20:53.580
 kind of like the steering wheel on a car

20:53.580 --> 20:55.140
 in order to shift your brain

20:55.140 --> 20:56.620
 in the direction that you want to go,

20:56.620 --> 20:58.380
 so it's a very powerful system,

20:58.380 --> 21:00.280
 and the way it works is the following,

21:00.280 --> 21:03.260
 and this will also incorporate the heart,

21:03.260 --> 21:06.220
 so, and by the heart, I don't mean it in the emotional sense

21:06.220 --> 21:08.140
 although we don't rule out emotions

21:08.140 --> 21:10.720
 here at the Huberman Lab Podcast, we like emotions,

21:10.720 --> 21:14.420
 but I'm talking about the heart as an organ,

21:14.420 --> 21:17.380
 as a beating organ that circulates blood,

21:17.380 --> 21:22.380
 so when we inhale, these little sacs in our lungs fill up

21:22.400 --> 21:25.460
 and our lungs expand, and when we do that,

21:25.460 --> 21:28.360
 we take up space in our thoracic cavity

21:28.360 --> 21:32.840
 and our diaphragm moves down, okay?

21:32.840 --> 21:35.700
 When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up,

21:35.700 --> 21:37.420
 the lungs get smaller, okay?

21:37.420 --> 21:40.620
 So inhales, diaphragm moves down, exhales,

21:40.620 --> 21:45.440
 diaphragm moves up, this actually controls our heart rate,

21:45.440 --> 21:48.980
 but it does it by changing the way that our brain works,

21:48.980 --> 21:50.740
 and it works in the following way,

21:50.740 --> 21:55.060
 so when we inhale, our lungs fill, our diaphragm moves down,

21:55.060 --> 21:57.100
 our heart actually has a little more space

21:57.100 --> 21:58.960
 because the diaphragm's moved down,

21:58.960 --> 22:01.660
 so the heart gets a little bit bigger, physically bigger,

22:01.660 --> 22:04.660
 not in the emotional sense, but physically bigger,

22:04.660 --> 22:07.900
 and as a consequence, whatever blood is in the heart

22:07.900 --> 22:11.780
 flows at a slower rate because it's a larger volume,

22:11.780 --> 22:15.540
 so bigger volume heart, same amount of blood inside the heart

22:15.540 --> 22:19.300
 means slower flow, okay, sort of like expanding a pipe.

22:19.300 --> 22:20.860
 The brain registers that

22:20.860 --> 22:22.420
 because there are a set of neurons on the heart

22:22.420 --> 22:24.540
 called the sinoatrial node,

22:24.540 --> 22:27.600
 it sends that information to the brain,

22:27.600 --> 22:29.900
 that information is registered by the brain,

22:29.900 --> 22:32.340
 and the brain sends a message back to the heart

22:32.340 --> 22:36.460
 to speed the heart up, so every time you inhale,

22:36.460 --> 22:40.380
 because of these mechanical changes in the diaphragm and lungs

22:40.380 --> 22:43.360
 and because of the mechanical changes in the heart,

22:43.360 --> 22:47.160
 your brain sends a signal to the heart to speed the heart up,

22:47.160 --> 22:51.620
 so if you do long inhales or you inhale more vigorously,

22:51.620 --> 22:54.480
 you actually are speeding your heart up.

22:54.480 --> 22:56.900
 Now, of course, you have to exhale as well,

22:56.900 --> 22:58.940
 but for instance, if I were to inhale very long,

22:58.940 --> 23:02.780
 like the entire time my heart rate is increasing,

23:02.780 --> 23:06.700
 and then if I did a quick exhale, something else will happen

23:06.700 --> 23:11.700
 but if I kept doing that, my heart rate would increase,

23:12.100 --> 23:14.140
 it's not going to increase linearly and forever,

23:14.140 --> 23:17.020
 but it will increase with each inhale,

23:17.020 --> 23:20.040
 or I can simply make my inhales more vigorous

23:20.040 --> 23:21.540
 and my heart rate will speed up,

23:21.540 --> 23:25.380
 this is an autonomic and automatic relationship

23:25.380 --> 23:29.180
 between the diaphragm, the lungs, the brain, and the heart.

23:29.180 --> 23:31.980
 Now, if inhales speed the heart up, what happens on exhales?

23:31.980 --> 23:36.120
 When we exhale, the diaphragm moves up,

23:36.120 --> 23:37.220
 it's a little counterintuitive,

23:37.220 --> 23:39.180
 but you can kind of think about it

23:39.180 --> 23:41.220
 as like pushing the plunge on a syringe, right?

23:41.220 --> 23:44.560
 When you exhale, this thing moves up,

23:44.560 --> 23:49.300
 and as the diaphragm moves up, the heart has less space,

23:49.300 --> 23:51.400
 meaning it gets a little bit smaller,

23:51.400 --> 23:53.060
 which means that whatever volume of blood

23:53.060 --> 23:57.180
 is inside the heart moves faster through that smaller volume

23:57.180 --> 23:59.520
 that information is sent to the brain

23:59.520 --> 24:03.020
 via these collection of neurons called the sinoatrial node

24:03.020 --> 24:04.460
 for you aficionados.

24:04.460 --> 24:08.480
 The brain then sends information via the vagus nerve

24:08.480 --> 24:12.020
 back to the heart to slow the heart down.

24:12.020 --> 24:16.220
 So while inhales speed up the heart, that's the net effect,

24:16.220 --> 24:18.380
 exhales slow the heart down,

24:18.380 --> 24:19.880
 and the reason they slow the heart down

24:19.880 --> 24:24.080
 is because of a register in the change in mechanical pressure

24:24.080 --> 24:26.760
 between the diaphragm, the lungs, and the heart.

24:26.760 --> 24:28.300
 So this is, to me,

24:28.300 --> 24:30.880
 the simplest and most straightforward example

24:30.880 --> 24:34.340
 of how the brain is changing the way our organs work,

24:34.340 --> 24:35.940
 our heart in this case,

24:35.940 --> 24:39.860
 according to changes in mechanical interoception.

24:39.860 --> 24:41.680
 Now, we're not always aware of this.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.220
 Some of us are aware of it, some of us aren't.

24:44.220 --> 24:46.120
 If you do it right now, you will be aware of it.

24:46.120 --> 24:48.000
 So you can try this.

24:48.000 --> 24:50.300
 Basically, this is an experiment or an example

24:50.300 --> 24:53.600
 in interoception, in sensing one's self.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.160
 So if you inhale, doesn't matter how long you inhale,

24:56.160 --> 24:58.160
 I'll do it for a couple seconds,

24:58.160 --> 25:00.200
 and then exhale twice as long.

25:02.460 --> 25:04.260
 Nose or mouth, doesn't matter.

25:04.260 --> 25:05.840
 The entire time that you're exhaling,

25:05.840 --> 25:08.040
 you're slowing your heart down.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.760
 So just as a car has an accelerator and a brake,

25:10.760 --> 25:13.720
 or you can slow a car by coming off the accelerator,

25:13.720 --> 25:14.560
 when you exhale,

25:14.560 --> 25:16.480
 you're effectively coming off the accelerator,

25:16.480 --> 25:18.400
 or if you want to think about it differently,

25:18.400 --> 25:19.580
 you're hitting the brake.

25:19.580 --> 25:21.680
 You're slowing down your heart rate.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.520
 Now, normally your heart rate stays in more or less

25:23.520 --> 25:26.240
 the same range for a given activity,

25:26.240 --> 25:28.440
 because you're inhaling and exhaling.

25:28.440 --> 25:30.440
 But this is just a simple way of showing

25:30.440 --> 25:33.320
 that mechanical changes in your viscera

25:33.320 --> 25:35.120
 can change the way that your brain works,

25:35.120 --> 25:37.880
 and then your brain changes the way that those viscera work.

25:37.880 --> 25:40.440
 And it's a very concrete agreements,

25:40.440 --> 25:42.880
 like a contract between the organs of your body

25:42.880 --> 25:44.360
 and the brain.

25:44.360 --> 25:46.360
 In fact, you can think about this contract

25:46.360 --> 25:47.280
 in more detail,

25:47.280 --> 25:49.440
 and you can leverage this in a very powerful way

25:49.440 --> 25:51.380
 to set the conditions of your mind.

25:52.600 --> 25:56.260
 If you want to be more calm, emphasize exhales.

25:56.260 --> 25:57.400
 And the simplest way to do this,

25:57.400 --> 25:59.400
 I've talked about this many times before,

25:59.400 --> 26:00.640
 but if you haven't heard me say it,

26:00.640 --> 26:02.240
 this will become immediately clear,

26:02.240 --> 26:03.880
 is to emphasize exhales

26:03.880 --> 26:06.980
 through what's called a physiological sigh.

26:06.980 --> 26:09.580
 Two inhales, could be through the nose or the mouth,

26:09.580 --> 26:10.680
 but ideally through the nose.

26:10.680 --> 26:13.320
 So, followed by a long exhale.

26:13.320 --> 26:14.160
 Ah.

26:15.600 --> 26:17.440
 Those double inhales are kind of important

26:17.440 --> 26:19.200
 because what they do is they maximally fill

26:19.200 --> 26:20.680
 all those little sacks in your lungs.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.540
 And then when you breathe out,

26:22.540 --> 26:26.000
 you're exhaling as much of the so-called carbon dioxide

26:26.000 --> 26:27.160
 in your system as possible.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.120
 We'll talk about carbon dioxide in a second.

26:29.120 --> 26:33.800
 So the fastest way to calm down is to emphasize exhales.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.460
 When you make exhales longer,

26:35.460 --> 26:38.200
 you're slowing your heart rate, you're calming down.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.860
 You don't need any sophisticated training.

26:39.860 --> 26:41.800
 You don't have to do this for minutes on end.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.720
 You don't have to do anything.

26:42.720 --> 26:43.980
 You don't even have to call it breath work.

26:43.980 --> 26:45.240
 It's just respiration.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.560
 And in fact, you do this every night when you go to sleep

26:47.560 --> 26:50.320
 and carbon dioxide builds up too much in your bloodstream,

26:50.320 --> 26:52.180
 or if you hold your breath or something,

26:52.180 --> 26:56.400
 or you watch an animal or a small child that's sleeping,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.960
 they will occasionally do these double inhale long exhales.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.680
 It's a way of slowing the heart down

27:00.680 --> 27:02.560
 and eliminating carbon dioxide.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.520
 The opposite is also true.

27:05.520 --> 27:08.200
 If you inhale deeply or vigorously

27:08.200 --> 27:13.160
 and then exhale less long or less vigorously,

27:13.160 --> 27:15.200
 you will increase your level of alertness

27:15.200 --> 27:18.080
 through these purely mechanical aspects

27:18.080 --> 27:19.880
 of your interoception.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.480
 So for instance, if I were to take a big, deep inhale

27:24.080 --> 27:27.200
 and then a short exhale, and then another one,

27:27.200 --> 27:28.720
 big inhale, short exhale,

27:28.720 --> 27:30.120
 it only takes two or three of those

27:30.120 --> 27:32.520
 before you start to feel more alert.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.360
 And that's because your heart rate is increasing.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.680
 And actually, if you keep doing that

27:35.680 --> 27:39.460
 for 25 or 30 breaths of inhale deep, short exhale,

27:39.460 --> 27:41.960
 you will start to secrete a lot of adrenaline.

27:41.960 --> 27:43.520
 This hormone that comes from your kidneys

27:43.520 --> 27:46.620
 and from your brainstem make you feel really alert.

27:46.620 --> 27:49.960
 You will actually feel as if you've had a couple of espresso.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.340
 You will immediately wake up.

27:52.340 --> 27:54.880
 And there's an intermediate form of breathing,

27:54.880 --> 27:56.360
 which is sometimes called box breathing,

27:56.360 --> 27:59.520
 but it's really equal inhale and exhale duration.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.480
 And these, it basically goes like this.

28:01.480 --> 28:02.400
 You're going to inhale.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.960
 So do this for maybe two, three seconds.

28:03.960 --> 28:08.100
 Inhale, then hold, two, three seconds,

28:08.100 --> 28:10.140
 then exhale, two, three seconds,

28:11.440 --> 28:13.040
 then hold, two, three seconds.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.340
 Most often people forget to hold.

28:14.340 --> 28:18.040
 So it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold

28:18.040 --> 28:20.400
 for equal or more or less equal duration.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.240
 So it could be one second, could be two seconds,

28:22.240 --> 28:23.320
 could be three seconds.

28:23.320 --> 28:25.400
 Most people find that when you get out past five seconds,

28:25.400 --> 28:26.600
 they start to struggle

28:26.600 --> 28:28.200
 to maintain the so-called box breathing.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.520
 And most people can't consciously box breathe

28:31.520 --> 28:34.060
 for too terribly long without having to think about it.

28:34.060 --> 28:38.960
 But the point here is that through purely mechanical means,

28:38.960 --> 28:40.720
 changing the way that you breathe,

28:40.720 --> 28:43.240
 emphasizing inhales or exhales or keeping them the same

28:43.240 --> 28:45.060
 will change the way that your brain works,

28:45.060 --> 28:47.800
 how alert you are and how well you function in anything.

28:47.800 --> 28:51.160
 And again, this doesn't mean that breath work has no value.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.360
 It's just simply to say that long extended protocols

28:54.360 --> 28:56.120
 of breath work are simply,

28:56.120 --> 28:58.740
 they are truly simply just an exploration

28:58.740 --> 29:00.240
 of this fundamental relationship

29:00.240 --> 29:03.240
 between the mechanics of your internal organs

29:03.240 --> 29:04.080
 and your brain

29:04.080 --> 29:07.080
 and how your brain controls those internal organs.

29:07.080 --> 29:11.720
 Now, you might ask, well, how is this pressure known?

29:11.720 --> 29:14.340
 How does the body actually know how full the lungs are?

29:14.340 --> 29:15.780
 Now, this is an answer

29:15.780 --> 29:17.400
 that's more for the aficionados out there,

29:17.400 --> 29:19.040
 but I've had a few requests or I should say

29:19.040 --> 29:21.800
 thousands of requests for more in-depth science.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.260
 So if you're not interested in more in-depth science,

29:24.260 --> 29:26.760
 just this will allow you to tune out now

29:26.760 --> 29:27.940
 for maybe just 10 seconds.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.040
 And if you are interested, pay careful attention.

29:30.040 --> 29:33.200
 There is a set of receptors

29:33.200 --> 29:38.200
 which are called piezoreceptors, P-I-E-Z-O, piezoreceptors.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.800
 Piezo means pressure.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.440
 And these were discovered a few years ago

29:41.440 --> 29:42.940
 by a couple of different laboratories.

29:42.940 --> 29:44.960
 But one of the main ones,

29:44.960 --> 29:45.940
 one of the main laboratories

29:45.940 --> 29:47.960
 that discovered these piezoreceptors

29:47.960 --> 29:50.560
 is the laboratory of Ardem Padepuchen.

29:50.560 --> 29:51.580
 I love saying his name,

29:51.580 --> 29:53.560
 even though I'm probably pronouncing it.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.560
 He's a friend and a former colleague.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.000
 When my lab was down in San Diego,

29:57.000 --> 29:58.800
 he's at the Scripps Institute.

29:58.800 --> 30:01.240
 He's a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator,

30:01.240 --> 30:04.640
 which just basically means that he's a total stud of science

30:04.640 --> 30:07.480
 and has made many important discoveries.

30:07.480 --> 30:11.440
 The piezoreceptors line many tissues

30:11.440 --> 30:14.240
 and inform the brain about pressure in those tissues.

30:14.240 --> 30:18.160
 But the lungs have a particular category of piezoreceptors

30:18.160 --> 30:19.680
 called piezo two receptors.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.360
 And as you fill your lungs

30:22.260 --> 30:25.320
 and these little sacks of air, the alveoli fill,

30:25.320 --> 30:26.900
 the piezo two receptors,

30:26.900 --> 30:31.040
 because of the way they react to that filling,

30:31.040 --> 30:33.620
 send information by way of a bunch of neurons,

30:33.620 --> 30:34.900
 a bunch of wires up to the brain

30:34.900 --> 30:36.700
 and tell you how full your lungs are.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.300
 So that's the kind of mechanistic detail.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.560
 If you want to learn more about that,

30:39.560 --> 30:43.540
 you can look up Ardem's lab at the Scripps

30:43.540 --> 30:44.940
 and the beautiful work that they

30:44.940 --> 30:47.100
 and other laboratories are doing on piezos.

30:47.100 --> 30:48.380
 Piezos are pretty cool.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.200
 I think I also just like saying piezo.

30:50.200 --> 30:52.260
 So that's why I brought that up as well.

30:52.260 --> 30:56.580
 So mechanical sensing of the lungs, heart, and diaphragm.

30:56.580 --> 30:58.300
 And now let's talk about chemical sensing

30:58.300 --> 31:00.580
 because there's carbon dioxide and there's oxygen.

31:00.580 --> 31:02.380
 And this is really simple.

31:02.380 --> 31:06.300
 You have oxygen and carbon dioxide and you need them both.

31:06.300 --> 31:08.220
 I sometimes hear people talk about carbon dioxide

31:08.220 --> 31:11.040
 as this bad thing and oxygen as a good thing.

31:11.040 --> 31:11.880
 You need them both

31:11.880 --> 31:13.940
 and you need them in the appropriate balance.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.600
 You have a collection of neurons in your brain

31:16.600 --> 31:19.220
 that register when carbon dioxide levels

31:19.220 --> 31:23.060
 get to a certain point in your bloodstream.

31:23.060 --> 31:25.900
 When that point, that threshold is reached,

31:25.900 --> 31:28.700
 these neurons fire and they cause you to breathe.

31:28.700 --> 31:31.100
 It's sometimes called the gasp reflex.

31:31.100 --> 31:32.340
 It just makes you want to inhale.

31:32.340 --> 31:35.860
 And as a consequence, you bring in more oxygen.

31:35.860 --> 31:38.600
 So we don't really breathe to get oxygen.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.420
 That's a by-product of inhaling

31:41.420 --> 31:44.140
 to eliminate carbon dioxide.

31:44.140 --> 31:47.140
 You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go too high.

31:47.140 --> 31:49.660
 In fact, if you want to freak somebody out

31:49.660 --> 31:51.100
 and we do these in experiments

31:51.100 --> 31:52.440
 and I don't recommend you do this,

31:52.440 --> 31:54.620
 you just increase the levels of carbon dioxide

31:54.620 --> 31:56.620
 that they inhale and the brain will go

31:56.620 --> 31:59.800
 into an almost immediate panic response

31:59.800 --> 32:02.000
 because the health of all our tissues depends

32:02.000 --> 32:04.800
 on keeping a nice balance between carbon dioxide and oxygen.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.340
 You don't want carbon dioxide levels to go too high.

32:07.340 --> 32:10.380
 So the impulse to breathe, if you're underwater

32:10.380 --> 32:13.720
 or if you hold your breath is triggered by these neurons.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.980
 And the triggering of those neurons

32:15.980 --> 32:18.820
 comes from elevated carbon dioxide in the bloodstream.

32:18.820 --> 32:21.400
 And for those of you that don't quite know

32:21.400 --> 32:22.980
 how to conceptualize the relationship

32:22.980 --> 32:24.980
 between bloodstream and breath,

32:24.980 --> 32:26.260
 I do think it's important.

32:26.260 --> 32:27.940
 And maybe you remember this from high school biology

32:27.940 --> 32:30.260
 but if you don't, I'll make it clear for you now.

32:30.260 --> 32:31.260
 It's very easy.

32:31.260 --> 32:36.260
 You inhale air and that air and the oxygen molecules

32:36.620 --> 32:39.020
 in that air actually move from your lungs

32:39.020 --> 32:41.140
 into the bloodstream because these little avioli

32:41.140 --> 32:43.600
 of the lungs, those little sacks of air,

32:44.940 --> 32:48.600
 they basically have a lot of little micro vessels

32:48.600 --> 32:52.460
 and capillaries, little tiny, basically blood vessels

32:52.460 --> 32:54.100
 essentially, although they're mostly capillaries,

32:54.100 --> 32:57.120
 micro capillaries, little tiny ones that line them.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.740
 So there's actually an interface, an opportunity

32:59.740 --> 33:04.260
 for air and molecules within the air to pass into the blood

33:04.260 --> 33:05.740
 and then they move in your bloodstream.

33:05.740 --> 33:08.660
 And when you exhale, the opposite is true.

33:08.660 --> 33:11.860
 So you can move things from the air into your bloodstream

33:11.860 --> 33:15.100
 or from your bloodstream into the air by way of the lungs.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.620
 And there's a lot more detail to it.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.940
 And I'm sure those of you that are experts out there,

33:18.940 --> 33:20.500
 if you want to put some stuff in the comments,

33:20.500 --> 33:22.980
 maybe a little bit of an kind of intermediate tutorial,

33:22.980 --> 33:25.680
 you might even title it intermediate tutorial.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.920
 If you know a lot about this, just I'll check it,

33:27.920 --> 33:29.180
 but make sure you get the details right.

33:29.180 --> 33:31.160
 Make sure you know the process.

33:31.160 --> 33:33.900
 And I find that for people that are interested

33:33.900 --> 33:35.840
 in understanding how breathing really works,

33:35.840 --> 33:37.600
 it's really nice to think about the relationship

33:37.600 --> 33:40.360
 between the heart and the vascular system,

33:40.360 --> 33:43.280
 the blood and the air system,

33:43.280 --> 33:45.160
 the respiration system and breathing,

33:45.160 --> 33:47.720
 because those two things are very,

33:47.720 --> 33:49.200
 we say they're interdigitated,

33:49.200 --> 33:51.300
 they're interwoven with one another.

33:51.300 --> 33:52.940
 So how's this work?

33:52.940 --> 33:55.140
 Well, carbon dioxide is too high.

33:55.140 --> 33:57.780
 You breathe in, you inspire, you inhale.

33:58.700 --> 34:00.060
 As a consequence, when you exhale,

34:00.060 --> 34:02.000
 you offload carbon dioxide.

34:02.000 --> 34:04.100
 There's a really cool way that you can explore

34:04.100 --> 34:06.400
 this chemistry of your breathing and your bloodstream

34:06.400 --> 34:07.500
 and the way that your brain works

34:07.500 --> 34:09.900
 in ways that can really benefit your health.

34:09.900 --> 34:12.260
 And it works the following way.

34:12.260 --> 34:15.240
 You want to essentially sit or lie down.

34:15.240 --> 34:17.140
 It doesn't really matter.

34:17.140 --> 34:19.940
 You definitely don't want to be anywhere near water,

34:19.940 --> 34:21.540
 not a bathtub, not a hot tub,

34:21.540 --> 34:24.220
 not a, you know, not a cold dunk or something.

34:24.220 --> 34:26.680
 In fact, don't even be in a puddle.

34:26.680 --> 34:28.580
 And what you want to do in this case

34:28.580 --> 34:29.980
 is you're going to breathe in deep,

34:29.980 --> 34:31.420
 so that's going to increase your heart rate,

34:31.420 --> 34:33.340
 and then exhale passively

34:33.340 --> 34:35.080
 by just letting air fall out of your mouth.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.540
 So it would look something like this.

34:36.540 --> 34:39.680
 So let's say you breathe in vigorously

34:39.680 --> 34:43.780
 and then you let the air just fall out of your mouth.

34:43.780 --> 34:46.100
 When you do that, what you're essentially doing

34:46.100 --> 34:47.740
 is you're bringing in a lot of oxygen

34:47.740 --> 34:49.260
 through that deep breath,

34:49.260 --> 34:53.580
 and you're exhaling a little bit of that carbon dioxide.

34:53.580 --> 34:57.300
 But if you were to repeat it 25 times, maybe 30 times,

34:57.300 --> 35:00.820
 it doesn't matter if it's 25 or 30, somewhere in there,

35:00.820 --> 35:03.700
 you would essentially start bringing in a lot of oxygen

35:03.700 --> 35:07.300
 and blowing off or exhaling a lot of carbon dioxide.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.860
 So you're actually going to change the chemistry

35:09.860 --> 35:13.060
 of your internal landscape and you can then sense it.

35:13.060 --> 35:15.820
 You can interocept what that is like.

35:15.820 --> 35:18.000
 And there are some really interesting reasons

35:18.000 --> 35:19.060
 for wanting to do that.

35:19.060 --> 35:20.800
 So I'm not going to do all 25 or 30 now,

35:20.800 --> 35:21.820
 maybe do five or 10,

35:21.820 --> 35:23.920
 so you can get a sense of what it looks like

35:23.920 --> 35:25.240
 so that it's clear.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.420
 I'm going to essentially demonstrate now.

35:27.420 --> 35:30.060
 So it's inhale, exhale through the mouth.

35:30.060 --> 35:31.620
 I am inhaling through the nose.

35:31.620 --> 35:33.620
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

35:39.040 --> 35:41.300
 So it's essentially, excuse me,

35:41.300 --> 35:43.620
 a two second or so inhale,

35:43.620 --> 35:45.220
 and then a one second or so exhale.

35:45.220 --> 35:46.060
 And as I was doing that,

35:46.060 --> 35:47.880
 I can kind of feel my face get flush

35:47.880 --> 35:50.100
 and my body is heating up and my brain is heating up.

35:50.100 --> 35:50.940
 What's happening there?

35:50.940 --> 35:54.380
 Well, that pattern of breathing is increasing levels

35:54.380 --> 35:56.060
 of adrenaline in my brain and body,

35:56.060 --> 35:58.040
 and I'm getting more alert.

35:59.220 --> 36:03.720
 Then after 25 or 30 of those, you exhale all your air.

36:05.020 --> 36:06.780
 You dump all your air.

36:06.780 --> 36:08.940
 You can do that your nose or your mouth.

36:08.940 --> 36:11.160
 And then you hold your breath with your lungs empty

36:11.160 --> 36:13.720
 for about 15 to 30 seconds.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.780
 Now, for those of you that want to explore this,

36:15.780 --> 36:17.900
 and please be careful as you explore this,

36:17.900 --> 36:18.860
 don't do anything stupid,

36:18.860 --> 36:22.260
 like do this while you're driving or something like that.

36:22.260 --> 36:24.180
 You can exhale all your air.

36:24.180 --> 36:26.300
 And what you'll find then is you can hold your breath

36:26.300 --> 36:28.820
 for a very long time.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.340
 And the reason you can do that

36:30.340 --> 36:34.340
 is because you've blown off all the carbon dioxide

36:34.340 --> 36:36.500
 or most of the carbon dioxide in your bloodstream.

36:36.500 --> 36:39.840
 So you've shifted the chemistry of your blood

36:39.840 --> 36:42.300
 by breathing in a particular way.

36:42.300 --> 36:44.740
 And by doing that, you are no longer triggering

36:44.740 --> 36:47.700
 these neurons that cause the gasp reflex

36:47.700 --> 36:49.580
 or the reflex to breathe.

36:49.580 --> 36:51.160
 Now, of course, you have to breathe sooner or later,

36:51.160 --> 36:53.940
 but what you'll find is if normally your ability

36:53.940 --> 36:56.200
 to hold your breath is a minute or so

36:56.200 --> 36:59.260
 before you really feel that gasp reflex kick in,

36:59.260 --> 37:02.300
 you might find that you can go 90 seconds or two minutes.

37:02.300 --> 37:03.200
 And with some practice,

37:03.200 --> 37:04.780
 people find that they can start holding their breath

37:04.780 --> 37:06.140
 for three or four minutes or longer.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.860
 This is actually how free divers do what they do.

37:07.860 --> 37:10.220
 I do not want anyone free diving.

37:10.220 --> 37:11.580
 If you're going to learn free diving,

37:11.580 --> 37:13.620
 please learn it from an expert.

37:13.620 --> 37:16.180
 Many people die trying to teach themselves out of free dive

37:16.180 --> 37:17.720
 or trying to teach their friends out of free dive

37:17.720 --> 37:19.280
 when they don't know what they're doing.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.920
 This is not what this is about.

37:20.920 --> 37:22.680
 Again, don't do this anywhere near water,

37:22.680 --> 37:25.500
 but it is a very interesting exploration

37:25.500 --> 37:28.340
 of how you can shift the chemistry of your bloodstream

37:28.340 --> 37:29.940
 by modulating your air,

37:29.940 --> 37:33.100
 by modulating the mechanics of your diaphragm and lungs,

37:33.100 --> 37:37.180
 and thereby shift the way your mind works, your brain.

37:37.180 --> 37:39.440
 In fact, what you'll notice is that even though

37:39.440 --> 37:44.440
 during that 25 or 30 breaths, you'll feel very alert.

37:44.680 --> 37:48.980
 When you exhale all your air and you're in the breath hold,

37:48.980 --> 37:52.640
 you will feel very alert, but very, very calm.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.980
 Now, this is interesting because it's a state

37:55.980 --> 37:58.600
 that we all sort of want to achieve, alert but calm,

37:58.600 --> 38:00.220
 but have a hard time achieving.

38:00.220 --> 38:02.500
 And so for those of you that have a hard time

38:02.500 --> 38:04.940
 obtaining focus for sake of work

38:04.940 --> 38:07.680
 or focus for sake of anything, I should say,

38:07.680 --> 38:10.200
 and when you are able to achieve focus,

38:10.200 --> 38:12.140
 it's through the use of things like stimulants,

38:12.140 --> 38:14.580
 or you feel like you have to have a cold shower or ice bath,

38:14.580 --> 38:17.720
 or you have to have four espresso in order to be alert,

38:17.720 --> 38:20.900
 but then you're too alert, you're jittery, you can't focus.

38:20.900 --> 38:23.940
 This pattern of breathing can lend itself very well

38:23.940 --> 38:26.900
 to entering states of alert but calm

38:26.900 --> 38:31.140
 for the 10 or even 20 minutes that follow that breathing.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.840
 And then you could repeat it if you want.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.260
 So it's a very useful practice to explore.

38:35.260 --> 38:37.500
 Some of you may be familiar with this practice

38:37.500 --> 38:39.140
 and so-called Wim Hof breathing.

38:39.140 --> 38:41.700
 Wim Hof is a practitioner of what's called tumor breathing.

38:41.700 --> 38:43.780
 Tumor breathing has been around for centuries.

38:43.780 --> 38:46.900
 And for those of you that are familiar with breath work

38:46.900 --> 38:50.300
 and yoga practices, I acknowledge that nothing

38:50.300 --> 38:53.020
 I just described is new based on science.

38:53.020 --> 38:56.900
 However, the science informs why those practices work.

38:56.900 --> 38:59.860
 And just as a little mini editorial,

38:59.860 --> 39:03.760
 I just want to emphasize as well that one thing

39:03.760 --> 39:06.660
 that this podcast is really about is trying to remove

39:06.660 --> 39:09.860
 fancy nomenclature, whether or not it's yogic nomenclature

39:09.860 --> 39:11.580
 or scientific nomenclature so that people

39:11.580 --> 39:12.700
 can access protocols.

39:12.700 --> 39:15.900
 Because the moment we start naming things after people

39:15.900 --> 39:18.020
 or calling them tumor, et cetera,

39:18.020 --> 39:19.200
 I have no problem with that,

39:19.200 --> 39:21.420
 but it doesn't inform how the practices are done,

39:21.420 --> 39:23.540
 nor does it inform the underlying mechanisms.

39:23.540 --> 39:25.820
 So here I'm trying to teach you the mechanisms.

39:25.820 --> 39:28.060
 And as a final point to that,

39:28.060 --> 39:30.720
 the most powerful form of breathing is the one

39:30.720 --> 39:33.280
 that takes into account the fundamental mechanisms

39:33.280 --> 39:35.240
 that inhales increased heart rate,

39:35.240 --> 39:37.780
 that exhales decrease heart rate,

39:37.780 --> 39:42.780
 and that carbon dioxide and oxygen relate to the bloodstream

39:42.780 --> 39:43.980
 and the brain in particular ways.

39:43.980 --> 39:46.420
 Once you understand those components,

39:46.420 --> 39:49.140
 then you can create your own so-called breath work practices.

39:49.140 --> 39:51.900
 You can breathe in the ways that best serve you,

39:51.900 --> 39:55.200
 as opposed to thinking that one protocol is the best

39:55.200 --> 39:58.100
 or holy protocol for everything, because it's simply not.

39:59.300 --> 40:03.500
 As a final, final point, I want to say that as you shift

40:03.500 --> 40:05.540
 the way that you breathe,

40:05.540 --> 40:07.900
 whether or not you're blowing off more carbon dioxide

40:07.900 --> 40:09.180
 or bringing in more oxygen,

40:09.180 --> 40:11.900
 you are fundamentally changing the chemistry

40:11.900 --> 40:14.100
 of your internal milieu of your body.

40:14.100 --> 40:17.160
 And that has been shown to have important effects

40:17.160 --> 40:19.020
 on the way that your immune system functions

40:19.020 --> 40:21.740
 and the way that you deal with inflammation

40:21.740 --> 40:24.660
 and all sorts of different sort of things

40:24.660 --> 40:26.620
 that can enter your body and cause problems

40:26.620 --> 40:29.220
 or conditions of stress, et cetera.

40:29.220 --> 40:32.140
 So I will explore that further as the episode goes on,

40:32.140 --> 40:35.880
 but I want to move on to just touch on one other aspect

40:35.880 --> 40:38.120
 of breathing that's purely mechanical,

40:38.120 --> 40:40.420
 which I think is very interesting and important,

40:40.420 --> 40:42.940
 which relates to a particular reflex

40:42.940 --> 40:45.200
 that you're going to be very familiar with in a second

40:45.200 --> 40:48.700
 and that can serve you very well in times of extreme stress.

40:48.700 --> 40:50.640
 The reflex I'm referring to is something called

40:50.640 --> 40:52.740
 the Herring-Brewer reflex.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.040
 I'm not going to go into details

40:54.040 --> 40:55.900
 about how the Herring-Brewer reflex works,

40:55.900 --> 40:59.440
 but it has to do with particular classes of neurons

40:59.440 --> 41:02.360
 and cells that are called a baroreceptors.

41:02.360 --> 41:04.780
 Those are basically pressure receptors.

41:04.780 --> 41:06.200
 They sense pressure.

41:06.200 --> 41:09.140
 And basically what the Herring-Brewer reflex is about

41:09.140 --> 41:11.300
 is that when your lung is inflated,

41:11.300 --> 41:14.000
 your desire to breathe is reduced.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.720
 So you can try that right now.

41:15.720 --> 41:20.720
 You can inhale huge big thing of air and hold, okay?

41:22.660 --> 41:26.140
 Your desire to breathe will kick in later

41:26.140 --> 41:31.140
 than were you to exhale all your air and hold your breath.

41:31.380 --> 41:34.020
 When you exhale all your air and hold your breath,

41:34.020 --> 41:35.740
 unless you've done the sort of protocol

41:35.740 --> 41:36.940
 I described a few minutes ago

41:36.940 --> 41:39.000
 of doing a bunch of inhales and exhales first

41:39.000 --> 41:42.020
 in a very deliberate way, you will feel empty.

41:42.020 --> 41:44.720
 Those baroreceptors are going to be firing like crazy

41:44.720 --> 41:45.860
 saying there's no pressure in here.

41:45.860 --> 41:46.700
 There's no pressure in here.

41:46.700 --> 41:48.100
 I got nothing in here.

41:48.100 --> 41:48.940
 You need to breathe.

41:48.940 --> 41:51.940
 You need to breathe and the gas reflex will kick in sooner.

41:51.940 --> 41:54.540
 You can apply that in all sorts of situations

41:54.540 --> 41:59.540
 related to exercise, related to modulating stress, et cetera.

42:00.140 --> 42:03.220
 So the Herring-Brewer reflex is a very powerful one.

42:03.220 --> 42:04.940
 This is why you take a big deep breath

42:04.940 --> 42:07.720
 before you go underwater, all right?

42:07.720 --> 42:10.000
 You're not going to exhale all your air and go underwater.

42:10.000 --> 42:12.480
 If you were to exhale all your air and go underwater,

42:12.480 --> 42:14.740
 you would absolutely feel the need to come up sooner

42:14.740 --> 42:19.140
 for a breath of air than had you a full tank, so to speak,

42:19.140 --> 42:21.580
 a full lungs full of air.

42:21.580 --> 42:24.500
 And this is also the way that people teach themselves

42:24.500 --> 42:26.680
 to feel comfortable underwater.

42:26.680 --> 42:28.380
 So when you learn how to swim, you learn how to swim

42:28.380 --> 42:30.520
 both by having air in your lungs while you're underwater

42:30.520 --> 42:33.920
 and no air in your lungs while you're underwater.

42:33.920 --> 42:35.660
 In any event, the Herring-Brewer reflex

42:35.660 --> 42:38.180
 is yet another dimension to the way

42:38.180 --> 42:40.440
 that mechanical pressure influences

42:40.440 --> 42:43.420
 your brain's decision-making about what to do

42:43.420 --> 42:46.180
 with your body, in this case, whether or not to breathe.

42:46.180 --> 42:48.600
 So now I want to shift away from breathing

42:48.600 --> 42:52.180
 and diaphragm and lungs and move toward another organ

42:52.180 --> 42:55.260
 within our viscera, which is our gut.

42:55.260 --> 42:57.140
 So this includes our stomach and our intestines,

42:57.140 --> 42:59.540
 our esophagus and so forth.

42:59.540 --> 43:01.980
 It's been said before, both by me and by others,

43:01.980 --> 43:04.100
 that we are but a series of tubes.

43:04.100 --> 43:05.080
 And indeed, that's true.

43:05.080 --> 43:08.840
 Believe it or not, every system in your body is a tube.

43:08.840 --> 43:11.060
 Your brain is actually a tube

43:11.060 --> 43:13.620
 that connects to your spinal cord, which is also a tube.

43:13.620 --> 43:15.060
 You started off as a tube.

43:15.060 --> 43:17.220
 You were like a churro, you know, those like churros,

43:17.220 --> 43:18.420
 I don't know if you're not familiar with churros,

43:18.420 --> 43:21.660
 they're like donuts that are shaped like a tube.

43:21.660 --> 43:24.060
 That's essentially what you look like early in development,

43:24.060 --> 43:26.140
 not long after conception.

43:26.140 --> 43:30.040
 And the front end of that churro grew and grew and grew,

43:30.040 --> 43:32.540
 but you always maintained a hollow through that tube.

43:32.540 --> 43:35.660
 That's why you have what are called ventricles, gaps,

43:35.660 --> 43:38.200
 or a space in your brain and spinal cord

43:38.200 --> 43:39.980
 that run the length of your brain and spinal cord

43:39.980 --> 43:41.860
 and fluid, cerebral spinal fluid

43:41.860 --> 43:43.860
 and other things move through that space.

43:43.860 --> 43:45.340
 We're going to return to the ventricles later.

43:45.340 --> 43:47.220
 They are very, very important.

43:47.220 --> 43:51.540
 They're just space filled with fluid, but they do a lot.

43:51.540 --> 43:55.180
 Similarly, your digestive system starts with the tube

43:55.180 --> 43:59.600
 at your mouth and of course goes down through your throat.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.740
 And then you've got all the elements of the stomach

44:01.740 --> 44:04.300
 and the intestines, and then it comes out the other end.

44:04.300 --> 44:06.340
 So you are, but a series of different tubes,

44:06.340 --> 44:08.600
 your vascular system, a series of other tubes.

44:08.600 --> 44:13.600
 So your tubes, the way your digestive system works

44:13.600 --> 44:17.240
 is to communicate to your brain about the status

44:17.240 --> 44:21.080
 of the mechanical pressures along this tube.

44:21.080 --> 44:23.280
 So within your stomach and your intestines, et cetera,

44:23.280 --> 44:26.720
 and the chemical status of that tube

44:26.720 --> 44:28.480
 at various portions within that tube

44:28.480 --> 44:32.080
 to inform your brain about how your brain

44:32.080 --> 44:34.260
 should control that tube.

44:35.160 --> 44:39.060
 So let's start with the mechanical sensing of your gut.

44:39.060 --> 44:44.060
 If you drink a lot of fluid, or if you eat a lot of food,

44:44.120 --> 44:45.400
 your gut will fill up.

44:45.400 --> 44:48.040
 Your stomach will fill up with food.

44:48.040 --> 44:50.240
 Now it gets digested there.

44:50.240 --> 44:52.800
 It gets digested elsewhere along your digestive tract too,

44:52.800 --> 44:55.400
 of course, but it starts getting digested there

44:55.400 --> 44:58.480
 because along this tube, you have a series

44:58.480 --> 44:59.680
 of what are called sphincters,

44:59.680 --> 45:01.920
 which basically are like little draw pulls.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.160
 Have you ever had a laundry bag

45:03.160 --> 45:04.360
 where it has a drawstring on it?

45:04.360 --> 45:06.080
 You pull it and then it cinches shut

45:06.080 --> 45:07.240
 and then you can open it again.

45:07.240 --> 45:08.300
 That's what those are.

45:08.300 --> 45:10.000
 Those are sphincter openings

45:10.000 --> 45:12.300
 and you have them in your throat.

45:12.300 --> 45:14.720
 You have them along your digestive tract

45:14.720 --> 45:15.840
 all the way to the end.

45:17.880 --> 45:20.060
 Food will enter your gut.

45:20.060 --> 45:23.280
 And if there's a lot of that food, pressure receptors,

45:23.280 --> 45:25.680
 some of which are these piezo receptors,

45:25.680 --> 45:28.320
 will communicate to the areas of your brain

45:28.320 --> 45:30.760
 that are involved in feeding and will say,

45:30.760 --> 45:31.880
 don't eat anymore.

45:31.880 --> 45:33.460
 You don't need to consume anymore.

45:33.460 --> 45:35.280
 Now, some people bypass that.

45:35.280 --> 45:38.480
 I guess they have these like hotdog eating competitions.

45:38.480 --> 45:41.240
 I'm always struck by how some of those people

45:41.240 --> 45:42.640
 seem to be rail thin,

45:42.640 --> 45:46.040
 but they actually train for those competitions

45:46.040 --> 45:48.420
 by ingesting large volumes of water.

45:48.420 --> 45:49.840
 Actually a very dangerous practice.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.240
 You can actually kill yourself by drinking too much water

45:52.240 --> 45:54.720
 and you can kill yourself by ingesting too much

45:54.720 --> 45:56.780
 of anything really to expand your gut.

45:56.780 --> 46:00.060
 Not a good practice, not a big fan of those competitions,

46:00.060 --> 46:02.040
 but even if you're one of those people

46:02.040 --> 46:03.880
 or you're the world heavyweight champion of them,

46:03.880 --> 46:07.120
 they are informative toward what I'm talking about now,

46:07.120 --> 46:09.840
 which is that as you expand the gut,

46:10.880 --> 46:12.680
 a signal is sent by neurons,

46:12.680 --> 46:15.480
 literally nerve cells that are in the gut

46:15.480 --> 46:17.960
 to the brainstem up to the areas of the brain

46:17.960 --> 46:18.900
 that are involved in feeding.

46:18.900 --> 46:20.520
 I did a whole episode on feeding.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.960
 You can find on feeding metabolism and hunger.

46:22.960 --> 46:25.740
 You're welcome to listen to that episode if you like.

46:25.740 --> 46:27.440
 And it will shut down the neurons

46:27.440 --> 46:30.840
 that drive the desire to put more stuff in your mouth.

46:30.840 --> 46:32.920
 That thing that people say sometimes on,

46:32.920 --> 46:35.360
 well, in this country frequently after Thanksgiving meal,

46:35.360 --> 46:37.360
 I can't put another bite in my mouth.

46:37.360 --> 46:40.480
 Literally they shut down some of the basic movements

46:40.480 --> 46:43.540
 of the musculature to take another fork bite.

46:43.540 --> 46:44.380
 I know it sounds crazy,

46:44.380 --> 46:46.640
 but they can actually control your brain.

46:46.640 --> 46:49.780
 So your gut is so full that it's controlling your brain

46:49.780 --> 46:52.320
 such that this action of spooning food

46:52.320 --> 46:54.260
 towards your mouth is actually inhibited.

46:54.260 --> 46:57.620
 It's made more difficult or less likely to occur.

46:58.520 --> 46:59.620
 It's incredible.

46:59.620 --> 47:01.440
 The converse is also true.

47:01.440 --> 47:03.580
 When these piezo receptors signal to the brain

47:03.580 --> 47:05.320
 that the gut is empty,

47:05.320 --> 47:08.400
 independent of your need, your actual need for food,

47:08.400 --> 47:10.520
 there's a signal that's sent to your brain

47:10.520 --> 47:13.400
 that says gut is empty and neurons get stimulated

47:13.400 --> 47:15.020
 in areas like the arcuate nucleus

47:15.020 --> 47:17.320
 and these areas of the hypothalamus, et cetera,

47:17.320 --> 47:22.200
 that drive the desire to make this action to open the mouth

47:22.200 --> 47:25.400
 and to put stuff in it, in particular food.

47:25.400 --> 47:28.300
 So when you find yourself at the refrigerator

47:28.300 --> 47:31.600
 or you find yourself almost manically trying

47:31.600 --> 47:32.640
 to get food of different kinds,

47:32.640 --> 47:34.180
 you're not even thinking about what you're eating

47:34.180 --> 47:35.720
 because you're so hungry.

47:35.720 --> 47:38.200
 In part, that's because the lack of food in your gut

47:38.200 --> 47:41.440
 has sent that information to your brain

47:41.440 --> 47:44.620
 and is driving particular fixed action patterns

47:44.620 --> 47:45.700
 that are associated with eating.

47:45.700 --> 47:47.920
 In fact, one of the first things children learn how to do

47:47.920 --> 47:50.440
 is open their mouth when something is presented to it.

47:50.440 --> 47:54.040
 And then they learn how to move a spoon or a fork.

47:54.040 --> 47:54.880
 They're not very good at it.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.020
 First, they get all over the place,

47:56.020 --> 47:57.560
 but eventually they get good at it,

47:57.560 --> 47:58.640
 at least most people get good at it.

47:58.640 --> 48:00.120
 If you watch how people eat,

48:00.120 --> 48:02.840
 it's kind of variable out there.

48:02.840 --> 48:07.840
 In any event, this is a purely mechanical phenomenon.

48:07.960 --> 48:10.600
 And this purely mechanical phenomenon is driving our brain

48:10.600 --> 48:12.880
 to drive certain behavior.

48:12.880 --> 48:16.760
 You can get better at registering sense of fullness

48:16.760 --> 48:20.440
 or lack of fullness in a very particular way.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.640
 Some people have a very keen sense

48:22.640 --> 48:25.080
 of how full or empty their stomach is.

48:25.080 --> 48:26.740
 So if you've eaten anything,

48:26.740 --> 48:28.240
 even if it's a small volume of food

48:28.240 --> 48:31.200
 in the last hour to three hours,

48:31.200 --> 48:32.800
 it's actually a worthwhile practice

48:32.800 --> 48:35.400
 to take a few moments, maybe 10, 20 seconds,

48:35.400 --> 48:37.640
 and actually just try and concentrate

48:37.640 --> 48:41.040
 on sensing the neurons in your gut and how full you are.

48:41.040 --> 48:43.060
 Like for instance, I ate a few hours ago,

48:43.060 --> 48:47.280
 then I had a little snack about 30 minutes ago or so,

48:47.280 --> 48:51.240
 and my gut feels neither terribly full nor terribly empty.

48:51.240 --> 48:54.940
 It's kind of, I would put it at kind of like 30, 40%.

48:54.940 --> 48:56.000
 Okay?

48:56.000 --> 48:59.560
 So by just taking conscious awareness

48:59.560 --> 49:02.520
 of how full or empty our gut is at various times,

49:02.520 --> 49:06.780
 between meals, after a meal, before a meal,

49:06.780 --> 49:09.560
 you can very quickly develop a sense

49:09.560 --> 49:11.060
 of how full or empty you are.

49:11.060 --> 49:12.760
 Now, what's the consequence of that?

49:12.760 --> 49:14.840
 The consequence of that is actually rather interesting.

49:14.840 --> 49:16.400
 It's been shown that the consequence of that

49:16.400 --> 49:19.440
 is actually that you can better override the signals

49:19.440 --> 49:23.160
 of these piezo receptors and gut fullness or emptiness.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.900
 So for those of you that find that you eat

49:24.900 --> 49:28.160
 kind of compulsively or non-consciously,

49:28.160 --> 49:30.120
 or subconsciously, I should say,

49:30.120 --> 49:32.520
 probably have to be conscious enough to be awake to eat,

49:32.520 --> 49:34.660
 but subconsciously, you just find yourself eating,

49:34.660 --> 49:36.160
 and here I'm describing myself.

49:36.160 --> 49:38.040
 I'm a drive-by blueberry eater.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.880
 If there's a bowl of blueberries,

49:39.880 --> 49:41.000
 every time I walk past it,

49:41.000 --> 49:42.320
 I sort of have to grab a handful of them

49:42.320 --> 49:43.760
 and pop them in my mouth.

49:43.760 --> 49:48.080
 But if you develop this sense of how much mechanopressure,

49:48.080 --> 49:48.920
 it's not really a word,

49:48.920 --> 49:52.200
 but how much mechanosensation is in your gut,

49:52.200 --> 49:54.980
 very quickly you can learn to override that.

49:54.980 --> 49:57.680
 You might ask, why would I want to be able to override

49:57.680 --> 50:00.320
 whether or not my stomach is empty or my stomach is full?

50:00.320 --> 50:03.040
 Well, there are many reasons to want to do that.

50:03.040 --> 50:04.640
 Many people right now are interested

50:04.640 --> 50:06.200
 in so-called intermittent fasting.

50:06.200 --> 50:09.060
 They're doing fasts of anywhere from 12 to 16 hours

50:09.060 --> 50:10.440
 every 24-hour cycle.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.080
 That's actually what my practice is.

50:12.080 --> 50:13.260
 I do that on a regular basis.

50:13.260 --> 50:14.400
 Sometimes, yeah, I eat breakfast,

50:14.400 --> 50:16.840
 but normally I push breakfast out till about 11 or noon

50:16.840 --> 50:18.060
 or sometimes a little later.

50:18.060 --> 50:19.580
 Some people are doing longer fasts,

50:19.580 --> 50:21.560
 and there are really wonderful data

50:21.560 --> 50:23.360
 published in excellent journals

50:23.360 --> 50:25.760
 from my colleague Sachin Panda

50:25.760 --> 50:28.920
 at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies,

50:28.920 --> 50:30.440
 and of course from other laboratories

50:30.440 --> 50:32.520
 showing that intermittent fasting

50:32.520 --> 50:35.200
 can and will have some positive health effects

50:35.200 --> 50:37.920
 on things like liver health and brain health

50:37.920 --> 50:39.680
 and other aspects of health.

50:39.680 --> 50:41.780
 Whether or not it's the best form of dieting

50:41.780 --> 50:44.320
 for the sake of losing weight, that's very controversial,

50:44.320 --> 50:47.380
 but it's clear that having a period of fasting

50:47.380 --> 50:51.240
 every 24 hours or perhaps even longer from time to time

50:51.240 --> 50:53.080
 can be beneficial because it stimulates

50:53.080 --> 50:56.240
 what's called autophagy, the clearing away

50:56.240 --> 51:00.040
 or the body's ability to eat certain dead cells,

51:00.040 --> 51:01.520
 so-called senescent cells.

51:01.520 --> 51:04.740
 And for many people, they struggle with fasting

51:04.740 --> 51:07.480
 because they feel they have a very keen sense

51:07.480 --> 51:09.500
 of their stomach being empty,

51:09.500 --> 51:11.520
 and they feel as if they have to eat.

51:11.520 --> 51:13.960
 And in a kind of counterintuitive way,

51:13.960 --> 51:16.320
 there's some data that indicate that being able to sense

51:16.320 --> 51:17.960
 whether or not your gut is full or empty

51:17.960 --> 51:21.040
 and just the knowledge that that's communicating information

51:21.040 --> 51:24.200
 to your brain about whether to not to eat or not.

51:24.200 --> 51:26.740
 Just that awareness, that understanding

51:26.740 --> 51:28.340
 allows them to override the signal.

51:28.340 --> 51:30.040
 They think, oh, you know, I'm not actually

51:30.040 --> 51:31.460
 in need of nutrients right now.

51:31.460 --> 51:33.440
 It's just that my stomach is empty

51:33.440 --> 51:36.440
 and these piezo receptors and some other ones

51:36.440 --> 51:38.220
 that I'll tell you about in a moment

51:38.220 --> 51:40.240
 are signaling to my brain that it's empty.

51:40.240 --> 51:41.580
 I don't actually need food.

51:41.580 --> 51:45.000
 It's just that my brain is reacting to the fact

51:45.000 --> 51:48.040
 that my gut is deflated, so to speak,

51:48.040 --> 51:50.340
 or is smaller, doesn't have food in it.

51:50.340 --> 51:52.160
 So there are other ways that our guts

51:52.160 --> 51:53.340
 communicate with our brain.

51:53.340 --> 51:55.600
 It's not just our stomach talking to our brain.

51:55.600 --> 51:58.360
 It's also our intestines talk to our brain.

51:59.620 --> 52:02.880
 The Lieberle's lab, the guy's name is Steven Lieberle's.

52:02.880 --> 52:04.400
 He runs a lab at Harvard Medical School,

52:04.400 --> 52:06.240
 his terrific lab, does excellent work

52:06.240 --> 52:08.520
 on gut brain communication and other aspects

52:08.520 --> 52:10.700
 of viscera brain communication.

52:10.700 --> 52:13.240
 They discovered a category of neurons

52:13.240 --> 52:15.320
 called the GLP-1R neurons.

52:15.320 --> 52:19.640
 These are neurons that are basically in your neck.

52:19.640 --> 52:20.680
 I mean, they're part of the nervous system,

52:20.680 --> 52:23.440
 but they can be found near your neck.

52:23.440 --> 52:26.240
 And those neurons send little wires down

52:26.240 --> 52:31.140
 into the intestines and deep into the stomach,

52:31.140 --> 52:33.720
 but mostly into the intestines,

52:33.720 --> 52:36.660
 and they sense stretch of your intestines.

52:36.660 --> 52:37.760
 So this is pretty wild.

52:37.760 --> 52:40.360
 These neurons sense how stretched out your intestines are

52:40.360 --> 52:42.760
 and how fast things are moving through your intestines,

52:42.760 --> 52:44.720
 slow or fast, or if there's nothing there.

52:44.720 --> 52:47.160
 And then those neurons send another branch.

52:47.160 --> 52:48.620
 So they have a branch in one direction,

52:48.620 --> 52:50.340
 senses what's going on in your intestines,

52:50.340 --> 52:53.040
 and they have another branch that goes up from your neck

52:53.040 --> 52:56.120
 into your brain to either trigger the desire to eat more

52:56.120 --> 52:57.680
 or just stop eating.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.080
 So these are really, really cool neurons,

52:59.080 --> 53:00.440
 and they're basically stretch receptors.

53:00.440 --> 53:02.180
 They look a lot like the piezo receptors

53:02.180 --> 53:03.660
 that we talked about before.

53:03.660 --> 53:06.840
 So these GLP-1R neurons are sensing stretch,

53:06.840 --> 53:09.160
 so purely mechanical sensing.

53:09.160 --> 53:11.720
 And in addition to that, the Lieberle's lab

53:11.720 --> 53:16.040
 discovered neurons that detect nutrients themselves.

53:16.040 --> 53:18.600
 Now, the main reason why we need to eat

53:18.600 --> 53:21.600
 is to bring nutrients into our body.

53:21.600 --> 53:24.000
 And there is another set of neurons,

53:24.000 --> 53:25.700
 those are called GPR-65 neurons,

53:25.700 --> 53:28.040
 if you want to know that you don't have to remember that,

53:28.040 --> 53:30.920
 that do the same thing in terms of their connections.

53:30.920 --> 53:32.720
 They send connections down into the intestines

53:32.720 --> 53:34.760
 and into the gut, into the stomach,

53:34.760 --> 53:36.000
 but mostly into the intestines,

53:36.000 --> 53:37.840
 and then send that information back up to the brain

53:37.840 --> 53:41.000
 as to whether or not there are certain kinds of nutrients

53:41.000 --> 53:42.120
 in our digestive tract.

53:42.120 --> 53:44.320
 Now, these neurons are the ones to pay attention to

53:44.320 --> 53:46.360
 if we're talking about chemical signaling.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.180
 And in the next couple of minutes,

53:48.180 --> 53:52.780
 I'm going to tell you about how you can understand hunger

53:52.780 --> 53:55.840
 and how to modulate your hunger for the right foods,

53:55.840 --> 53:58.200
 in fact, for healthy foods.

53:58.200 --> 54:02.360
 The way this is done is by leveraging the activity

54:02.360 --> 54:07.360
 of these GPR-65 neurons, these neurons that sense nutrients.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.080
 They're telling your brain

54:09.080 --> 54:11.520
 what's in your gut and intestines.

54:11.520 --> 54:13.180
 And you have another set of neurons

54:13.180 --> 54:14.780
 that were discovered by another guy.

54:14.780 --> 54:16.280
 He's out at Duke University.

54:16.280 --> 54:18.760
 His name is Diego, excuse me, Diego.

54:18.760 --> 54:22.600
 Diego Borges, he's a wonderful scientist.

54:22.600 --> 54:26.020
 He has a degree in nutrition, but also in neuroscience.

54:26.020 --> 54:28.640
 And he found that there are neurons that line the gut

54:29.720 --> 54:33.260
 and those neurons, in collaboration with these GPR-65 neurons

54:33.260 --> 54:35.800
 are sensing for three things, okay?

54:35.800 --> 54:38.520
 So we say nutrients, which nutrients are they looking for?

54:38.520 --> 54:40.380
 What are these neurons paying attention to?

54:40.380 --> 54:41.920
 Well, these neurons are activated

54:41.920 --> 54:44.840
 by the presence of fatty acids,

54:44.840 --> 54:47.720
 in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,

54:47.720 --> 54:51.240
 sorts of things that come from fatty fish, fish oil, krill,

54:51.240 --> 54:56.240
 certain kinds of animal and plant substances.

54:56.360 --> 54:59.040
 You can look up what has a lot of omega-3s.

54:59.040 --> 55:02.280
 And those omega-3s make these neurons fire electrically

55:02.280 --> 55:04.040
 like crazy up to the brain

55:04.040 --> 55:06.360
 and make you want to eat more of those things,

55:06.360 --> 55:09.040
 but it turns out in pretty appropriate levels.

55:09.040 --> 55:12.500
 These neurons also respond to amino acids.

55:12.500 --> 55:15.500
 So when you eat a food, it's broken down in the gut.

55:15.500 --> 55:16.640
 Actually, the way it's broken down in the gut

55:16.640 --> 55:17.600
 is kind of interesting.

55:17.600 --> 55:20.920
 Your gut basically cinches off a sphincter up top,

55:20.920 --> 55:23.960
 cinches off a sphincter below it when there's food there.

55:23.960 --> 55:27.420
 And then you have a series of smooth muscles

55:27.420 --> 55:29.000
 that tumble the food

55:29.000 --> 55:31.020
 and literally physically break it down.

55:31.020 --> 55:31.860
 And then of course,

55:31.860 --> 55:33.900
 enzymes come in and start digesting the food.

55:33.900 --> 55:35.320
 And we're going to talk about digestion

55:35.320 --> 55:37.280
 and how that's communicated to the brain in a moment.

55:37.280 --> 55:39.360
 And for those of you with any autoimmune issues

55:39.360 --> 55:40.920
 or digestive issues,

55:40.920 --> 55:43.140
 this is going to be a very important conversation.

55:43.140 --> 55:46.240
 But meanwhile, there are these neurons in the gut.

55:46.240 --> 55:49.300
 And as these fatty acids float out of the digested food,

55:49.300 --> 55:51.700
 so literally fat molecules,

55:51.700 --> 55:55.920
 and as amino acids are coming from the proteins

55:55.920 --> 55:57.960
 as they're digested in the gut,

55:57.960 --> 56:00.000
 and as a third food item,

56:00.000 --> 56:03.320
 sugars are coming from the foods that we eat.

56:03.320 --> 56:06.220
 These neurons will fire a lot to the brain that says,

56:06.220 --> 56:09.480
 hey, whatever you're doing up there, do more of it, okay?

56:09.480 --> 56:11.660
 Now the sugars are a little bit cryptic

56:11.660 --> 56:14.420
 because when I say sugars or I say amino acids,

56:14.420 --> 56:17.100
 or I say fatty acids,

56:17.100 --> 56:19.420
 this has nothing to do with taste.

56:19.420 --> 56:21.660
 In fact, beautiful experiments have been done

56:21.660 --> 56:23.980
 by the Borges lab and by other labs showing

56:23.980 --> 56:26.900
 that even if you numb the mouth,

56:26.900 --> 56:28.140
 even if you gavage,

56:28.140 --> 56:29.260
 which is a really just a,

56:29.260 --> 56:32.020
 it's a fancy word for basically tube feeding,

56:32.020 --> 56:33.140
 you put a tube down in the gut,

56:33.140 --> 56:34.340
 you just deliver the food to the gut

56:34.340 --> 56:36.340
 so you get no opportunity to taste it.

56:36.340 --> 56:37.460
 Sounds pretty awful.

56:37.460 --> 56:41.060
 If you force feed by gavage or you numb the mouth,

56:41.060 --> 56:43.680
 these neurons don't care about the mouth,

56:43.680 --> 56:46.060
 they only care about the nutrients coming from these foods

56:46.060 --> 56:47.460
 and then they signal to the brain,

56:47.460 --> 56:48.820
 hey, do that thing,

56:48.820 --> 56:51.220
 do that thing where you lift that object

56:51.220 --> 56:52.380
 we call a fork or a spoon,

56:52.380 --> 56:54.460
 do that thing where you drink the milkshake,

56:54.460 --> 56:56.560
 do that thing where you move your mouth like this,

56:56.560 --> 56:58.980
 not talking, but do that thing where you swallow.

56:58.980 --> 57:02.020
 So that's how the nutrients in our gut control us

57:02.020 --> 57:03.240
 and this is why for people

57:03.240 --> 57:05.820
 that experience extreme sugar cravings

57:05.820 --> 57:07.580
 or even mild sugar cravings,

57:07.580 --> 57:09.420
 replacing those foods with foods

57:09.420 --> 57:12.860
 that have high levels of omega-3 or amino acids

57:12.860 --> 57:14.220
 can reduce sugar cravings

57:14.220 --> 57:16.660
 and I've talked about this on a previous episode,

57:16.660 --> 57:17.980
 but if you didn't catch it, no big deal,

57:17.980 --> 57:20.740
 I'll tell you right now that for many people,

57:20.740 --> 57:23.800
 the solution to sugar cravings is to ingest a small amount,

57:23.800 --> 57:26.980
 maybe a teaspoon or so of an amino acid called glutamine

57:28.060 --> 57:30.660
 and if you have really extreme sugar cravings,

57:30.660 --> 57:34.020
 you can even mix that glutamine with a full fat cream,

57:34.020 --> 57:36.460
 which actually makes it taste pretty darn good,

57:36.460 --> 57:37.980
 and you drink that anytime you have a sugar craving,

57:37.980 --> 57:39.180
 just a sip or two of that

57:39.180 --> 57:40.940
 and what you find is that the sugar cravings disappear

57:40.940 --> 57:44.300
 because you're basically giving fat and amino acids

57:44.300 --> 57:46.980
 to those neurons in the gut and in the intestine

57:46.980 --> 57:49.120
 that signal to the brain that you want more.

57:49.120 --> 57:51.500
 Now, this doesn't give you a kind of runaway hunger

57:51.500 --> 57:52.340
 for full fat cream,

57:52.340 --> 57:54.500
 although it will say when I was in high school

57:54.500 --> 57:56.260
 for various reasons,

57:56.260 --> 57:57.940
 but mostly because I liked the way it tastes,

57:57.940 --> 57:59.900
 I was using half and half in my cereal

57:59.900 --> 58:00.980
 and I was waking up in the middle of the night

58:00.980 --> 58:01.940
 and drinking half and half

58:01.940 --> 58:03.220
 and that stuff tastes pretty darn good

58:03.220 --> 58:05.000
 once you get used to the high fat content,

58:05.000 --> 58:06.740
 not something I do now,

58:06.740 --> 58:11.400
 but the point is these neurons don't really know taste,

58:11.400 --> 58:12.780
 they only know nutrients

58:12.780 --> 58:14.300
 and so you can work with that system.

58:14.300 --> 58:17.420
 If you crave sugar and I do believe that most,

58:17.420 --> 58:19.260
 if not all of us should be trying to limit,

58:19.260 --> 58:22.500
 if not eliminate simple sugars as much as possible

58:22.500 --> 58:23.860
 most of the time,

58:23.860 --> 58:26.220
 then things like glutamine,

58:26.220 --> 58:29.740
 things like high omega-3 foods, et cetera,

58:29.740 --> 58:31.820
 maybe even want to supplement with fish oil

58:31.820 --> 58:33.500
 or something similar to get omega-3s,

58:33.500 --> 58:35.380
 there are other reasons for wanting to do that too,

58:35.380 --> 58:36.460
 can be very beneficial

58:36.460 --> 58:40.320
 and here's what we're talking about is interoception.

58:40.320 --> 58:43.380
 It's your ability to sense your inner real estate,

58:43.380 --> 58:45.860
 but in this case by way of chemical signaling,

58:45.860 --> 58:47.900
 not by way of mechanical signaling.

58:48.840 --> 58:51.100
 So now I'd like to talk about another aspect

58:51.100 --> 58:55.580
 of gut chemistry that has profound effects on the brain

58:55.580 --> 58:57.340
 as well as on the immune system

58:57.340 --> 58:59.760
 and for those of you with autoimmune conditions

58:59.760 --> 59:02.220
 or for those of you that know people with autoimmune

59:02.220 --> 59:03.140
 conditions,

59:03.140 --> 59:06.080
 this is going to be a very important discussion.

59:06.080 --> 59:09.760
 Your gut needs to maintain a certain level of acidity

59:09.760 --> 59:11.100
 or alkalinity.

59:11.100 --> 59:14.260
 For those of you without any chemistry background,

59:14.260 --> 59:17.020
 basically the low numbers on the pH scale,

59:17.020 --> 59:18.380
 that means more acidic.

59:18.380 --> 59:21.320
 The higher the numbers, more alkaline.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.580
 So more alkaline means more basic

59:23.580 --> 59:25.380
 and acidic means acidic

59:25.380 --> 59:28.080
 and it has to do with number of hydrogen atoms

59:28.080 --> 59:28.920
 and all this other stuff,

59:28.920 --> 59:30.700
 you don't need to worry about that right now.

59:30.700 --> 59:32.060
 We're not going to pH your gut right now,

59:32.060 --> 59:34.200
 but we are going to talk about the pH of your gut.

59:34.200 --> 59:36.140
 Your gut needs to be more acidic

59:36.140 --> 59:38.320
 than essentially all other tissues of your body

59:38.320 --> 59:39.900
 in order to function properly.

59:41.140 --> 59:44.460
 Bacteria thrive in alkaline conditions.

59:44.460 --> 59:46.140
 I think this is important for people to understand.

59:46.140 --> 59:46.980
 People are always thinking,

59:46.980 --> 59:48.740
 oh, you should be more alkaline,

59:48.740 --> 59:52.380
 being acidic that almost sounds like being inflamed.

59:52.380 --> 59:54.300
 Well, it's a complicated discussion,

59:54.300 --> 59:56.940
 but I think the semantics can be confusing sometimes.

59:56.940 --> 59:59.340
 You want your gut to be acidic.

59:59.340 --> 1:00:02.540
 You may ask, well, why are people taking anti-acids?

1:00:02.540 --> 1:00:05.660
 Well, those anti-acids are there for a particular purpose

1:00:05.660 --> 1:00:08.660
 to essentially combat acid reflux,

1:00:08.660 --> 1:00:12.520
 which is the sending up of stuff in the gut

1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:14.780
 towards the esophagus and it can cause heartburn

1:00:14.780 --> 1:00:16.340
 and things of that sort.

1:00:16.340 --> 1:00:19.600
 And the way that anti-acids work

1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:21.900
 is they essentially cause the sphincters

1:00:21.900 --> 1:00:24.060
 above the gut to cinch shut,

1:00:24.060 --> 1:00:26.300
 but they really are only dealing with a symptom,

1:00:26.300 --> 1:00:27.740
 not the cause.

1:00:27.740 --> 1:00:31.460
 So rewind about 10, 20 years ago,

1:00:31.460 --> 1:00:33.440
 the discussion about gut acidity

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.160
 was quite a bit different than it is now

1:00:35.160 --> 1:00:36.980
 in the scientific and medical literature.

1:00:36.980 --> 1:00:38.860
 In fact, for many years,

1:00:38.860 --> 1:00:41.500
 long before I'm going to say it here,

1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:44.020
 people have been saying that it's important

1:00:44.020 --> 1:00:47.300
 to maintain proper acidity of the gut,

1:00:47.300 --> 1:00:50.020
 but the science and medical professions

1:00:50.020 --> 1:00:52.380
 sort of looked at that as a kind of a scants,

1:00:52.380 --> 1:00:53.820
 like, you know, what's going on there?

1:00:53.820 --> 1:00:55.160
 I don't know that there's any evidence

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:56.340
 that that's actually true.

1:00:56.340 --> 1:00:58.980
 There are communities of people that were prescribing,

1:00:58.980 --> 1:00:59.820
 or I should say,

1:00:59.820 --> 1:01:03.040
 recommending that people take hydrochloric acid, HCL,

1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:05.540
 and adjusting gut acidity that way.

1:01:05.540 --> 1:01:06.860
 And it was kind of frowned upon.

1:01:06.860 --> 1:01:09.360
 Now, in looking over the peer reviewed literature,

1:01:09.360 --> 1:01:10.940
 it's clear that this business

1:01:10.940 --> 1:01:12.820
 of trying to make the gut a little more acidic

1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:15.400
 is actually one way in which people treat

1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:18.940
 or try and ameliorate acid reflux.

1:01:18.940 --> 1:01:20.100
 So it's kind of counterintuitive,

1:01:20.100 --> 1:01:21.860
 increasing acidity in the gut

1:01:21.860 --> 1:01:23.780
 to try and reduce acid reflux.

1:01:23.780 --> 1:01:25.140
 I thought you're supposed to take antacids.

1:01:25.140 --> 1:01:27.680
 Well, the field has shifted quite a bit.

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:29.300
 And so we're going to review what it is

1:01:29.300 --> 1:01:32.320
 to maintain the chemistry of the gut

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:34.580
 at a slightly more acidic level

1:01:34.580 --> 1:01:36.440
 or a more acidic level, I should say,

1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:38.700
 because it turns out that there are a number of things

1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:41.260
 that are in gut, I just call it what it is.

1:01:41.260 --> 1:01:43.620
 It's gastric juice, sounds kind of gross,

1:01:43.620 --> 1:01:47.480
 but gastric juices are actually powerful modulators

1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:48.640
 of brain state.

1:01:50.100 --> 1:01:52.540
 Put differently, one of the best things that you can do

1:01:52.540 --> 1:01:54.700
 to have a healthy brain, a well-functioning brain

1:01:54.700 --> 1:01:56.300
 and a healthy and well-functioning body

1:01:56.300 --> 1:01:59.420
 is to maintain proper gut chemistry.

1:01:59.420 --> 1:02:01.420
 And that's basically accomplished

1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:03.620
 by getting the right level of acidity

1:02:03.620 --> 1:02:05.380
 and alkalinity in your gut.

1:02:06.340 --> 1:02:08.380
 Now, this is not quack pseudoscience.

1:02:08.380 --> 1:02:11.500
 This is not based on cleanses or anything of that sort.

1:02:11.500 --> 1:02:14.380
 What we're going to talk about now are peer reviewed data

1:02:14.380 --> 1:02:17.780
 in very high quality journals, like the journal Cell,

1:02:17.780 --> 1:02:19.380
 which is one of the three apex journals,

1:02:19.380 --> 1:02:20.740
 Science, Nature, Cell,

1:02:20.740 --> 1:02:24.220
 and journals of that sort that point to the gut microbiome

1:02:24.220 --> 1:02:26.460
 and its relationship to acidity of the gut

1:02:26.460 --> 1:02:28.260
 and how the gut microbiome

1:02:28.260 --> 1:02:32.780
 can help enhance autoimmune function

1:02:32.780 --> 1:02:35.220
 and various other aspects of brain and body health.

1:02:35.220 --> 1:02:39.460
 So within all the mucosal line tissues of our body,

1:02:39.460 --> 1:02:41.740
 we have what are called microbiota,

1:02:41.740 --> 1:02:43.980
 little microorganisms that we didn't make

1:02:43.980 --> 1:02:47.020
 that actually come from our environment or our food

1:02:47.820 --> 1:02:50.100
 and live inside us.

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:53.540
 And there are good microbiota and there are bad microbiota.

1:02:54.700 --> 1:02:59.140
 Whether or not we have good microbiota or bad microbiota

1:02:59.140 --> 1:03:01.140
 depends on one thing.

1:03:01.140 --> 1:03:05.220
 And that one thing is how acid or alkaline

1:03:05.220 --> 1:03:07.180
 the given mucosal tissue is.

1:03:08.260 --> 1:03:11.700
 So we actually have a microbiome in our nose.

1:03:11.700 --> 1:03:13.240
 And just as a very brief aside,

1:03:13.240 --> 1:03:15.860
 because I'd be remiss if I didn't say this,

1:03:15.860 --> 1:03:18.220
 if you emphasize nasal breathing,

1:03:18.220 --> 1:03:20.720
 most of the time, except when speaking or eating,

1:03:21.700 --> 1:03:24.260
 and if you downplay mouth breathing,

1:03:24.260 --> 1:03:25.920
 meaning you refrain from mouth breathing,

1:03:25.920 --> 1:03:27.340
 especially in sleep,

1:03:28.260 --> 1:03:32.020
 you improve the nasal microbiome.

1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:35.700
 It gets better at fighting off infections.

1:03:35.700 --> 1:03:37.140
 This was shown in a beautiful paper

1:03:37.140 --> 1:03:39.620
 published in Cell Reports last year.

1:03:39.620 --> 1:03:43.140
 And that paper I should mention was performed in humans.

1:03:43.140 --> 1:03:44.960
 So you've got a microbiome in your nose

1:03:44.960 --> 1:03:46.540
 and by nasal breathing most of the time,

1:03:46.540 --> 1:03:47.360
 not all the time,

1:03:47.360 --> 1:03:48.460
 because there can be times when you need to breathe

1:03:48.460 --> 1:03:49.740
 through your mouth for whatever reason,

1:03:49.740 --> 1:03:52.340
 hard exercise or eating or speaking,

1:03:52.340 --> 1:03:54.400
 but by breathing through your nose most of the time,

1:03:54.400 --> 1:03:58.580
 you are creating an additional layer of immune defense

1:03:58.580 --> 1:04:00.620
 against particles that could get you sick.

1:04:00.620 --> 1:04:02.000
 Whereas when you mouth breathe,

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.000
 you are taking down a layer of defense

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.140
 and you are putting yourself more at risk of infection.

1:04:06.140 --> 1:04:07.640
 This is what this paper shows.

1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:14.480
 You also have a gut microbiome that is in your throat,

1:04:14.480 --> 1:04:18.320
 in your stomach and in your intestines.

1:04:18.320 --> 1:04:20.900
 And that gut microbiome is extremely powerful

1:04:20.900 --> 1:04:24.740
 in regulating your mood and your immune function.

1:04:24.740 --> 1:04:27.180
 Now, this is not something that you can sense directly.

1:04:27.180 --> 1:04:30.580
 You don't know when you have a bunch of good microbiota

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:32.300
 or a bunch of bad microbiota

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:33.940
 because you can feel them moving around in there.

1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:35.180
 Actually, that would be pretty awful.

1:04:35.180 --> 1:04:37.100
 That would be pretty creepy feeling.

1:04:37.100 --> 1:04:40.500
 Rather, that according to whether or not your gut

1:04:40.500 --> 1:04:43.820
 is alkaline or acidic in the appropriate ways,

1:04:43.820 --> 1:04:47.980
 you will populate your gut with the appropriate microbiota.

1:04:48.920 --> 1:04:52.940
 So you want your stomach to be pretty acidic,

1:04:52.940 --> 1:04:55.220
 but other elements of your digestive tract

1:04:55.220 --> 1:04:57.180
 are going to be more pH.

1:04:57.180 --> 1:04:58.900
 And basically there's a gradient,

1:04:58.900 --> 1:05:03.900
 meaning there's a low to high pH gradient along the gut.

1:05:04.060 --> 1:05:05.720
 You don't have to know what the pH

1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:08.100
 should be at any one given point

1:05:08.100 --> 1:05:09.380
 because you're not going to go

1:05:09.380 --> 1:05:12.460
 and put microbiota at one location and not another.

1:05:12.460 --> 1:05:16.020
 What you essentially want to do is create an environment

1:05:16.020 --> 1:05:18.680
 where the proper microbiota can thrive.

1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:20.440
 Because when you do that,

1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:24.500
 you greatly decrease what are called inflammatory cytokines.

1:05:24.500 --> 1:05:25.900
 So these are things that are secreted

1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:29.420
 both by cells within the body and cells within the brain

1:05:29.420 --> 1:05:31.820
 to impact brain health and brain function

1:05:31.820 --> 1:05:33.020
 and bodily health.

1:05:33.020 --> 1:05:34.140
 They go by a particular name.

1:05:34.140 --> 1:05:36.340
 So there's something called TNF alpha,

1:05:36.340 --> 1:05:38.620
 tumor necrosis factor alpha.

1:05:38.620 --> 1:05:40.020
 It is inflammatory.

1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:43.040
 It's not a good thing to have at elevated levels.

1:05:43.040 --> 1:05:45.940
 You have something called interleukin-6 IL-6

1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:48.860
 also causes inflammation, causes damage to tissues.

1:05:48.860 --> 1:05:51.740
 Not a good thing to have for elevated

1:05:51.740 --> 1:05:53.220
 for long periods of time.

1:05:53.220 --> 1:05:55.460
 And then you have anti-inflammatory cytokines,

1:05:55.460 --> 1:05:58.020
 things like interleukin-10, which reduce inflammation.

1:05:58.020 --> 1:05:59.640
 And there are hundreds of these,

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:01.860
 if not thousands of these different cytokines,

1:06:01.860 --> 1:06:03.580
 some of which promote inflammation,

1:06:03.580 --> 1:06:06.140
 some of which reduce inflammation.

1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:08.360
 The simple way to adjust these things

1:06:08.360 --> 1:06:13.060
 in the proper ratios is to adjust your gut microbiome.

1:06:13.060 --> 1:06:14.940
 The best way to adjust your microbiome

1:06:14.940 --> 1:06:17.580
 is to ingest certain types of foods.

1:06:17.580 --> 1:06:20.080
 So there is a beautiful literature on this now,

1:06:20.080 --> 1:06:21.720
 but the most important literature

1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:23.600
 is the one that I referred to

1:06:23.600 --> 1:06:25.300
 at the beginning of this episode,

1:06:25.300 --> 1:06:29.100
 which is what to ingest and what not to ingest

1:06:29.100 --> 1:06:31.380
 in terms of foods in order to create

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:33.640
 the best conditions in your gut

1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:35.260
 so that you can create the best conditions

1:06:35.260 --> 1:06:36.420
 in your brain and body.

1:06:36.420 --> 1:06:40.640
 There was a study done by my colleague, Justin Sonnenberg

1:06:41.840 --> 1:06:43.200
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:45.620
 Justin's actually my upstairs neighbor

1:06:45.620 --> 1:06:48.360
 in the building at Stanford where I work.

1:06:48.360 --> 1:06:51.760
 And they explored how different foods

1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:53.760
 or different diets, I should say,

1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:56.660
 impact the gut microbiome and inflammatory markers.

1:06:56.660 --> 1:06:57.800
 And this is a beautiful study

1:06:57.800 --> 1:07:00.660
 because it was done in hundreds of human patients.

1:07:00.660 --> 1:07:02.460
 These actually weren't patients that were sick.

1:07:02.460 --> 1:07:06.280
 I should say human subjects that were otherwise healthy

1:07:06.280 --> 1:07:08.460
 from a huge variety of backgrounds.

1:07:08.460 --> 1:07:09.720
 So you had men, you had women,

1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:13.160
 you had people of different races, different ethnicities.

1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:14.600
 You had a huge range of backgrounds

1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:16.160
 and they tracked all of that.

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:19.120
 And what they did is they explored two types of diets.

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:21.140
 One is a high fiber diet.

1:07:21.140 --> 1:07:24.840
 So dietary fibers are non-digestible

1:07:24.840 --> 1:07:27.920
 or only partially digestible carbohydrates typically.

1:07:27.920 --> 1:07:30.640
 And they compared that to diets that were unchanged

1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:35.140
 except for the inclusion of a few to a few more servings

1:07:35.140 --> 1:07:36.680
 of fermented foods each day.

1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:38.960
 Things like sauerkraut, things like kimchi.

1:07:38.960 --> 1:07:41.100
 They even explored, sounds pretty disgusting to me,

1:07:41.100 --> 1:07:42.200
 but who knows, I've never tried it,

1:07:42.200 --> 1:07:44.640
 which is fermented cottage cheese.

1:07:44.640 --> 1:07:47.440
 And what they found was that after initial period

1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:49.560
 of a few weeks where they had people

1:07:49.560 --> 1:07:51.100
 either eat a lot of fiber

1:07:51.100 --> 1:07:54.660
 or eat one or two servings of fermented foods,

1:07:54.660 --> 1:07:57.080
 they had those people ramp up their ingestion

1:07:57.080 --> 1:07:58.720
 of either fiber or fermented foods.

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:00.160
 So they kind of ease them into it.

1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:02.380
 So they went baseline, then ramp up

1:08:02.380 --> 1:08:03.940
 to the point where they were ingesting

1:08:03.940 --> 1:08:05.800
 four or five servings of fiber

1:08:05.800 --> 1:08:09.120
 or of fermented foods per day,

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:11.360
 which sounds like a lot, but for fermented foods,

1:08:11.360 --> 1:08:14.200
 that would be four or five tablespoons

1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:16.120
 of sauerkraut or kimchi.

1:08:16.120 --> 1:08:18.080
 It's not quite, it's not like huge platefuls

1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:20.120
 of fermented foods.

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:22.400
 And then they looked at a number of things.

1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:23.720
 They looked at the proteome,

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:25.380
 which is a kind of like looking at the genome,

1:08:25.380 --> 1:08:27.600
 but a bunch of proteins that are made in the body.

1:08:27.600 --> 1:08:30.840
 And they did this by fecal samples, by stool samples.

1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:32.980
 And they did this by blood draw, which is great.

1:08:32.980 --> 1:08:34.400
 It's a real power of this study.

1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:37.640
 In fact, the most comprehensive study that I'm aware of.

1:08:37.640 --> 1:08:39.360
 By looking at these different tissues

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:42.280
 across long periods of time, so many, many weeks,

1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:46.200
 and then returning people to the diet that they were on

1:08:46.200 --> 1:08:48.160
 before they went into the study,

1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:51.440
 they were able to establish in a causal way

1:08:51.440 --> 1:08:54.600
 how ingesting fiber or fibrous foods

1:08:54.600 --> 1:08:57.460
 versus ingesting these fermented foods on a daily basis

1:08:57.460 --> 1:08:59.080
 could impact the gut microbiome

1:08:59.080 --> 1:09:02.280
 and many, many inflammatory markers.

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:05.920
 And many, many markers of immune function

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.960
 and autoimmune function.

1:09:07.960 --> 1:09:10.080
 And the takeaway message from this study

1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:14.000
 is that the fermented foods far outperformed

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.240
 the high fiber diet.

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:18.480
 In fact, the high fiber diet in some people was beneficial

1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:22.320
 and in other people caused issues with inflammation.

1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:25.280
 This is very different than what I was taught growing up

1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:27.740
 and what many of us were taught.

1:09:27.740 --> 1:09:30.260
 Interestingly, they also observed that people

1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:33.120
 that ate the high fiber diet had increases

1:09:33.120 --> 1:09:36.520
 in certain enzymes that lend themselves

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:38.880
 to better digestion of carbohydrates.

1:09:38.880 --> 1:09:41.320
 And I think there's an important insight to come from this.

1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:43.320
 Nowadays, we kind of live in the age of extremes

1:09:43.320 --> 1:09:45.600
 where people seem to either want to be carnivore,

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:47.280
 like never ingest a vegetable.

1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:49.320
 I hear they don't even, they're like allowed pepper,

1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:51.580
 but they're not even allowed, you know,

1:09:51.580 --> 1:09:53.920
 sauerkraut or something like very extreme

1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:57.240
 or pure plant-based, pure vegan, or pure.

1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:00.560
 So essentially pure carbohydrate or pure animal protein,

1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:01.520
 very extreme.

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:02.600
 I'm an omnivore.

1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:05.080
 I like to eat a mixture of different things

1:10:05.080 --> 1:10:07.940
 at different times of days, but very extreme.

1:10:07.940 --> 1:10:10.460
 But this is interesting because what these data show

1:10:10.460 --> 1:10:13.960
 is that perhaps ingesting a high carbohydrate,

1:10:13.960 --> 1:10:16.000
 high fiber diet, which is really what these,

1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.440
 the high fiber condition really was,

1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:22.480
 actually makes people better at digesting carbohydrates.

1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:24.280
 This may explain why people who are used

1:10:24.280 --> 1:10:28.840
 to a kind of more paleo type or carnivore type diet

1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:30.440
 might eat carbohydrates and say,

1:10:30.440 --> 1:10:31.320
 oh, that doesn't work for me.

1:10:31.320 --> 1:10:32.400
 I don't feel good.

1:10:32.400 --> 1:10:35.040
 It might also explain why people who predominantly eat

1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:37.480
 plant-based foods and carbohydrate foods

1:10:37.480 --> 1:10:40.040
 will try eating meat as an experiment

1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:42.000
 or because they lost a bed or whatever it is,

1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.960
 and they'll do, or desperation or they'll do that.

1:10:44.960 --> 1:10:47.760
 And then they'll say, oh, I don't feel good when I eat meat.

1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:50.840
 How good you feel, it seems,

1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:53.060
 how well you can utilize that food

1:10:53.060 --> 1:10:57.720
 and how much of that food you crave may be determined.

1:10:57.720 --> 1:10:59.320
 In fact, it appears is determined

1:10:59.320 --> 1:11:02.560
 by your food eating history, the types of food you eat.

1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:05.680
 And I think this might explain some of the divide

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:07.880
 and hopefully might bridge some of the chasm

1:11:07.880 --> 1:11:09.500
 between these different groups that are saying

1:11:09.500 --> 1:11:11.760
 it should be one way or it should be another.

1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:15.660
 But at the core of the study was the bigger message.

1:11:15.660 --> 1:11:18.440
 The bigger message is that all of us

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:22.240
 should be ingesting on a regular basis, daily basis,

1:11:22.240 --> 1:11:25.240
 two to four servings of fermented foods of different kinds.

1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:27.800
 And why I say that is because

1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:30.080
 the inflammatory markers went down,

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:35.080
 the markers of autoimmune disruption went down,

1:11:35.080 --> 1:11:38.200
 and the chemistry of the gut therefore

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:40.240
 was adjusted in the appropriate ways.

1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:42.240
 Now it's not to say that high fiber is bad

1:11:42.240 --> 1:11:43.320
 or that fiber is bad.

1:11:43.320 --> 1:11:44.880
 I don't want people to confuse this.

1:11:44.880 --> 1:11:47.520
 But even though this is a discussion about interoception,

1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:51.440
 about sensing the self, this is a subconscious mechanism

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:54.680
 by which the gut communicates to many, many organs,

1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:55.640
 including the brain.

1:11:55.640 --> 1:11:58.020
 And it's been shown in other studies,

1:11:58.020 --> 1:12:00.100
 also in quality peer review journals,

1:12:00.100 --> 1:12:04.440
 that when the correct gut microbiota are present

1:12:04.440 --> 1:12:07.240
 and these inflammatory markers are reduced,

1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:10.040
 cognition improves, so ability to focus,

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:12.600
 ability to sleep, ability to ward off infection,

1:12:12.600 --> 1:12:14.520
 and wound healing all enhanced.

1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:17.520
 In fact, even in autism spectrum disorder,

1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:20.920
 in people that struggle with various mental conditions

1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:22.600
 or disorders of the mind,

1:12:22.600 --> 1:12:25.840
 improving the gut microbiome seems to have powerful effects

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:28.240
 on improving brain symptoms.

1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:30.120
 Along the lines of autoimmunity,

1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:31.980
 there are a number of conditions

1:12:31.980 --> 1:12:35.080
 that we call autoimmune conditions.

1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:37.480
 And we will do entire episodes about these going forward,

1:12:37.480 --> 1:12:41.100
 but for people with so-called irritable bowel syndrome,

1:12:41.100 --> 1:12:42.560
 for people with Crohn's disease,

1:12:42.560 --> 1:12:45.260
 for people with leaky gut, Hashimoto's,

1:12:45.260 --> 1:12:48.280
 which is a kind of an immune system self-attack

1:12:48.280 --> 1:12:50.200
 on one's thyroid gland,

1:12:50.200 --> 1:12:53.040
 and things like eczema, skin conditions,

1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:56.800
 adjusting the gut microbiome has been shown to be useful

1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:01.220
 in positively adjusting the symptoms of all of those.

1:13:01.220 --> 1:13:04.000
 Will it fix those conditions entirely?

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:04.840
 Probably not,

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:07.840
 but can it have a significant positive impact on them?

1:13:07.840 --> 1:13:09.780
 Probably yes.

1:13:09.780 --> 1:13:11.880
 There is one thing that's worth mentioning in that list,

1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:13.420
 which is leaky gut.

1:13:13.420 --> 1:13:14.360
 What is leaky gut?

1:13:14.360 --> 1:13:15.360
 Here we're talking about the guts.

1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:17.160
 What is it to have a leaky gut?

1:13:17.160 --> 1:13:18.000
 It sounds awful.

1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:19.800
 It sounds like something sort of like leaking out

1:13:19.800 --> 1:13:22.480
 the end of the tube, and maybe that too, I don't know.

1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:27.480
 But leaky gut is actually because your gut is not a tube

1:13:27.480 --> 1:13:29.460
 that's continuous one cell.

1:13:29.460 --> 1:13:31.160
 It's actually made up of many, many cells,

1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:33.920
 and those cells form a barrier,

1:13:33.920 --> 1:13:36.240
 and they form what are called tight junctions.

1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:38.720
 So if you have two cells and you want to create a fence

1:13:38.720 --> 1:13:40.860
 out of those cells, you bind them together.

1:13:40.860 --> 1:13:43.120
 The way that the body does this is to bind them together

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:45.000
 with what are called tight junctions.

1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.080
 They go by names like cloudins and things like that

1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:48.200
 if you want to look them up.

1:13:48.200 --> 1:13:50.840
 These tight junctions form a nice barrier

1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:53.760
 like a cyclone fence that things can't get past,

1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:55.240
 but like a cyclone fence,

1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:57.880
 only molecules of a certain size can go through those holes.

1:13:57.880 --> 1:13:59.220
 So you're not going to pass a soccer ball

1:13:59.220 --> 1:14:01.360
 through an intact cyclone fence,

1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:02.880
 but you could pass, for instance,

1:14:02.880 --> 1:14:04.800
 a feather through that fence.

1:14:04.800 --> 1:14:09.360
 So leaky gut is when the conditions in the gut

1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:14.280
 are too alkaline or the gut microbiota are off in the gut,

1:14:14.280 --> 1:14:19.280
 meaning microbiota that like alkaline guts are living there,

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:22.400
 and those tight junctions can't function

1:14:22.400 --> 1:14:23.900
 at that particular pH,

1:14:23.900 --> 1:14:26.680
 and you create little holes in that fence.

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:29.680
 And then what happens is when you ingest foods,

1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:32.240
 some of those foods literally leak out of the gut

1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:36.780
 and into the extracellular space and into the bloodstream.

1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:39.880
 And because foods include proteins

1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:44.540
 and antibodies react to proteins,

1:14:44.540 --> 1:14:46.800
 what ends up happening in leaky gut,

1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:48.860
 and the reason we talk about it in autoimmune conditions

1:14:48.860 --> 1:14:51.300
 is that you start developing antibodies

1:14:51.300 --> 1:14:53.500
 to particular food proteins.

1:14:53.500 --> 1:14:56.180
 And then people start feeling like they have food allergies

1:14:56.180 --> 1:14:59.200
 and they do, they actually create particular food allergies.

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:00.860
 Now, one way to prevent leaky gut

1:15:00.860 --> 1:15:03.420
 is to get the rest of the gut situation happy

1:15:03.420 --> 1:15:06.300
 by ingesting the proper foods that we talked about before,

1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:09.820
 ingesting fermented foods on a regular basis.

1:15:09.820 --> 1:15:13.220
 The other is our old friend glutamine again.

1:15:13.220 --> 1:15:14.900
 There are some data,

1:15:14.900 --> 1:15:16.660
 and I should say it's a limited number of studies,

1:15:16.660 --> 1:15:18.820
 showing that ingesting glutamine

1:15:18.820 --> 1:15:22.580
 anywhere from one to three teaspoons per day

1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:25.340
 can help alleviate leaky gut.

1:15:25.340 --> 1:15:27.500
 Now, the mechanism for that still isn't clear

1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:28.860
 whether or not it's adjusting pH

1:15:28.860 --> 1:15:32.820
 or whether or not it's creating more favorable environment

1:15:32.820 --> 1:15:34.220
 for the microbiota,

1:15:34.220 --> 1:15:36.580
 but it is clear that supplementing with glutamine

1:15:36.580 --> 1:15:39.180
 can in some people enhance,

1:15:39.180 --> 1:15:41.900
 or I should say improve conditions of leaky gut.

1:15:41.900 --> 1:15:43.500
 So that might be useful as well.

1:15:43.500 --> 1:15:44.860
 And then the final thing about this

1:15:44.860 --> 1:15:45.700
 I want to talk about

1:15:45.700 --> 1:15:48.620
 is we're talking about chemical sensing in the gut

1:15:48.620 --> 1:15:53.300
 and how that impacts wellbeing is about gut acidity.

1:15:53.300 --> 1:15:56.500
 And this, I confess is a little bit controversial.

1:15:56.500 --> 1:15:59.500
 Some people are on board this, other people are not.

1:15:59.500 --> 1:16:01.420
 And so I'd love your feedback on this.

1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:03.420
 If you agree, please tell me.

1:16:03.420 --> 1:16:05.140
 If you disagree, please tell me,

1:16:05.140 --> 1:16:08.120
 but please tell me why you disagree in particular.

1:16:08.120 --> 1:16:10.940
 Experience or data, although it's always better

1:16:10.940 --> 1:16:13.420
 if you can point me towards peer reviewed studies.

1:16:13.420 --> 1:16:16.040
 There is a practice that some people embrace.

1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:17.900
 I'm not recommending people necessarily do this

1:16:17.900 --> 1:16:19.740
 and you would definitely want to talk to your doctor,

1:16:19.740 --> 1:16:22.060
 but where people have food allergies

1:16:22.060 --> 1:16:24.460
 or they're having mood or autoimmune issues

1:16:24.460 --> 1:16:27.220
 and they treat this,

1:16:27.220 --> 1:16:28.500
 some people recommend treating this

1:16:28.500 --> 1:16:32.820
 through the ingestion of HCL, hydrochloric acid tablets.

1:16:32.820 --> 1:16:34.980
 Now, hydrochloric acid can burn you, right?

1:16:34.980 --> 1:16:38.460
 Acids can burn you, they literally can melt away skin.

1:16:38.460 --> 1:16:43.020
 You want to be very careful with acids of all kinds, truly.

1:16:43.020 --> 1:16:47.220
 But hydrochloric acid is sold as in supplement form

1:16:47.220 --> 1:16:48.620
 in capsular pill form.

1:16:48.620 --> 1:16:51.340
 And there is a practice of starting to ingest

1:16:51.340 --> 1:16:55.460
 one or two hydrochloric acid tablets midway through a meal.

1:16:55.460 --> 1:16:57.420
 And then what people will generally do

1:16:57.420 --> 1:16:58.740
 is examine to see whether or not

1:16:58.740 --> 1:17:02.580
 that improves their symptoms of indigestion,

1:17:02.580 --> 1:17:03.660
 how it relates to mood,

1:17:03.660 --> 1:17:05.660
 how it relates to wellbeing,

1:17:05.660 --> 1:17:08.200
 how it relates to their sensation of their gut viscera.

1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:09.500
 By changing the acidity,

1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:11.400
 you also change the way that the gut communicates

1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:13.700
 with the brain through the mechanisms we talked about before.

1:17:13.700 --> 1:17:15.900
 And there are a growing number of people

1:17:15.900 --> 1:17:18.600
 embracing these practices of taking HCL.

1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:21.100
 It's often combined with other things.

1:17:21.100 --> 1:17:24.980
 It's usually combined with an enzyme

1:17:24.980 --> 1:17:28.580
 and that enzyme is pepsin.

1:17:28.580 --> 1:17:32.100
 So most of these supplements come in the form

1:17:32.100 --> 1:17:34.260
 betaine HCL pepsin.

1:17:34.260 --> 1:17:36.740
 And while they're not a cure-all,

1:17:36.740 --> 1:17:39.500
 I certainly don't want to suggest that they're a cure-all,

1:17:39.500 --> 1:17:41.140
 many people that have a hard time

1:17:41.140 --> 1:17:43.420
 adjusting the pH of their gut

1:17:43.420 --> 1:17:46.060
 and have a hard time adjusting the microbiota of their gut

1:17:46.060 --> 1:17:49.060
 in the appropriate ways have benefited from taking

1:17:49.060 --> 1:17:53.900
 these betaine HCL pepsin tablets or capsules during meals.

1:17:53.900 --> 1:17:56.500
 And the general instruction is to start slow,

1:17:56.500 --> 1:17:57.660
 to start with one or two,

1:17:57.660 --> 1:17:59.820
 and then to find a level that you're comfortable with

1:17:59.820 --> 1:18:02.340
 that doesn't create an excessive feeling of warmth

1:18:02.340 --> 1:18:05.160
 in the stomach that doesn't throw off your digestion.

1:18:05.160 --> 1:18:06.860
 So it takes a little bit of experimentation.

1:18:06.860 --> 1:18:09.460
 Again, definitely talk to your healthcare provider

1:18:09.460 --> 1:18:10.900
 before exploring this,

1:18:10.900 --> 1:18:13.820
 but this has become a very common practice

1:18:13.820 --> 1:18:18.700
 for people with autoimmune disorders and accessing the gut

1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:21.440
 because it is accessible by taking things

1:18:21.440 --> 1:18:23.900
 has also become a way in which people

1:18:23.900 --> 1:18:25.860
 with various mental conditions

1:18:25.860 --> 1:18:29.400
 are trying to adjust their mood and adjust their wellbeing.

1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:31.620
 Along these lines, I do want to mention

1:18:31.620 --> 1:18:33.180
 that there are studies that show

1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:37.820
 that people that supplement with a lot of probiotics

1:18:37.820 --> 1:18:41.660
 or even prebiotics can sometimes experience brain fog.

1:18:41.660 --> 1:18:43.020
 This isn't discussed a lot

1:18:43.020 --> 1:18:45.100
 and the data are a little all over the place,

1:18:45.100 --> 1:18:47.140
 but it is worth thinking about.

1:18:47.140 --> 1:18:50.060
 The goal here is not to create

1:18:50.060 --> 1:18:52.040
 as many microbiota as possible.

1:18:52.040 --> 1:18:55.200
 What you want is microbiota diversity.

1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:56.780
 And I should mention this again

1:18:56.780 --> 1:18:59.360
 in reference to the Sonnenberg study.

1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:02.580
 What the high fiber diet does

1:19:02.580 --> 1:19:05.120
 is it increases certain microbiota,

1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:07.440
 but it limits their diversity.

1:19:07.440 --> 1:19:09.720
 And what the fermented food diet does,

1:19:09.720 --> 1:19:11.680
 or I should say the diet that includes

1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:14.060
 regular ingestion of fermented foods,

1:19:14.060 --> 1:19:15.200
 a few servings a day,

1:19:16.060 --> 1:19:19.140
 is it increases microbiota diversity.

1:19:19.140 --> 1:19:21.780
 Now, lack of microbiota diversity

1:19:21.780 --> 1:19:23.760
 has a name in the medical profession.

1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:26.540
 It's called dysbiosis and dysbiosis is bad.

1:19:26.540 --> 1:19:28.280
 Dysbiosis is what you see

1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:31.880
 when people are spending long periods of time on bed rest

1:19:31.880 --> 1:19:33.980
 or when they've been chronically ill.

1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:35.580
 And so here again,

1:19:35.580 --> 1:19:39.120
 we're talking about creating a positive environment

1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:40.960
 in the gut, either by adjusting acidity,

1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:43.880
 maybe you explore the betaine HCL pepsin thing.

1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:45.540
 I think if you have healthy digestion,

1:19:45.540 --> 1:19:49.180
 if you feel like you have a good relationship to your gut

1:19:49.180 --> 1:19:50.540
 and it has a good relationship to you,

1:19:50.540 --> 1:19:53.420
 sort of a silly phrase because it is you and you are it,

1:19:53.420 --> 1:19:57.740
 then I don't think there's any means or any need to pursue

1:19:57.740 --> 1:19:59.620
 this, but if you don't,

1:19:59.620 --> 1:20:01.140
 that might be one avenue to pursue.

1:20:01.140 --> 1:20:03.220
 However, I think primary in all of this

1:20:03.220 --> 1:20:05.220
 is the fermented food findings.

1:20:05.220 --> 1:20:06.260
 And it's not just one study,

1:20:06.260 --> 1:20:09.340
 it's many, many findings that now bring us to a place

1:20:09.340 --> 1:20:11.900
 where a huge center of mass of data are pointing us

1:20:11.900 --> 1:20:14.660
 in the direction of saying ingest fermented foods

1:20:14.660 --> 1:20:16.460
 on a regular basis.

1:20:16.460 --> 1:20:20.140
 I should also mention that conditions like sarcopenia,

1:20:20.140 --> 1:20:22.960
 which is the loss of muscle tissue as we age,

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:26.700
 has been shown to be offset by improving the gut microbiota.

1:20:26.700 --> 1:20:28.820
 So while today is about interoception,

1:20:28.820 --> 1:20:30.100
 we're talking about sensing,

1:20:30.100 --> 1:20:32.220
 we're also talking about subconscious sensing.

1:20:32.220 --> 1:20:33.820
 What are we talking about subconscious sensing?

1:20:33.820 --> 1:20:35.820
 We're talking about subconscious sensing

1:20:35.820 --> 1:20:37.400
 of the milieu of the body.

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:40.700
 When the milieu of the gut and the body is right,

1:20:40.700 --> 1:20:44.580
 then the brain and the immune system function very well.

1:20:44.580 --> 1:20:46.900
 And so this isn't something where you can sit back and say,

1:20:46.900 --> 1:20:50.340
 oh, you know, I feel all those good microbiota in my gut,

1:20:50.340 --> 1:20:52.440
 or, oh no, those are bad microbiota.

1:20:52.440 --> 1:20:54.900
 You can't do that unless you're going to take fecal samples

1:20:54.900 --> 1:20:58.060
 and blood samples and analyze them

1:20:58.060 --> 1:21:01.100
 with the extreme exhaustive nature

1:21:01.100 --> 1:21:03.240
 that the Sonnenberg and other labs do.

1:21:03.240 --> 1:21:04.720
 You're not going to get that kind of information.

1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:07.260
 I know there are companies out there that do this,

1:21:07.260 --> 1:21:10.180
 and I don't want to knock on any of them,

1:21:10.180 --> 1:21:12.980
 but I do want to emphasize that to do this right,

1:21:12.980 --> 1:21:15.620
 to really analyze which cytokines you're making

1:21:15.620 --> 1:21:16.580
 and which ones you're not,

1:21:16.580 --> 1:21:18.400
 you really need to look at a huge number of them.

1:21:18.400 --> 1:21:22.140
 And that requires large-scale proteomic and genomic

1:21:22.140 --> 1:21:24.980
 and inflammatory marker screens.

1:21:24.980 --> 1:21:26.260
 It's just not the kind of thing

1:21:26.260 --> 1:21:28.900
 that most commercial enterprises can really provide

1:21:28.900 --> 1:21:30.900
 to people in a way that they can interpret.

1:21:30.900 --> 1:21:33.040
 Rather, this is a case where you can simply go

1:21:33.040 --> 1:21:35.200
 to the effector, to the thing that can actually move

1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:36.860
 the needle in the right direction for you.

1:21:36.860 --> 1:21:38.500
 It's very clear that's fermented foods,

1:21:38.500 --> 1:21:41.660
 and that's keeping the stomach slightly more acid

1:21:41.660 --> 1:21:44.020
 than one might think you would want to.

1:21:44.020 --> 1:21:46.420
 So let's talk about barfing first.

1:21:46.420 --> 1:21:51.100
 Barfing, AKA vomiting, is when the contents

1:21:51.100 --> 1:21:53.220
 of your guts run in reverse,

1:21:53.220 --> 1:21:55.340
 meaning when they go up from your stomach,

1:21:55.340 --> 1:21:56.980
 sometimes even up from the intestines,

1:21:56.980 --> 1:21:59.580
 even though that sounds horrible, it sometimes happens,

1:21:59.580 --> 1:22:02.160
 up out the esophagus and mouth

1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:06.340
 and onto whatever surface happens to be in front of you.

1:22:06.340 --> 1:22:08.460
 It's a terrible thing, nobody likes to do it,

1:22:08.460 --> 1:22:11.540
 but it's a very interesting aspect to our biology

1:22:11.540 --> 1:22:14.620
 because it reveals a beautiful

1:22:14.620 --> 1:22:16.640
 and absolutely fundamental relationship

1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:20.840
 between our chemistry and our brain.

1:22:20.840 --> 1:22:25.660
 So your brain is actually locked behind a gate,

1:22:25.660 --> 1:22:28.140
 and that gate is not your skull.

1:22:28.140 --> 1:22:31.200
 That gate is the so-called blood-brain barrier.

1:22:31.200 --> 1:22:34.540
 So just like your gut has these epithelial tight junctions,

1:22:34.540 --> 1:22:36.740
 the things I talked about before that provide a fence

1:22:36.740 --> 1:22:40.840
 so things can't get through and get through and leaky gut,

1:22:40.840 --> 1:22:45.820
 your brain has tight junctions that are very, very tight.

1:22:45.820 --> 1:22:49.580
 It's absolutely fundamental that only certain molecules

1:22:49.580 --> 1:22:52.380
 get across the blood-brain barrier and that others don't.

1:22:52.380 --> 1:22:55.540
 And the reason for that is that most all,

1:22:55.540 --> 1:23:00.540
 99.9999% of your neurons do not regenerate.

1:23:00.580 --> 1:23:01.820
 I don't care what you've read,

1:23:01.820 --> 1:23:02.980
 especially in the news recently

1:23:02.980 --> 1:23:04.900
 about how psychedelics cause neurogenesis

1:23:04.900 --> 1:23:07.640
 because they don't, it's absolutely wrong.

1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:09.540
 Psychedelics have effects on brain plasticity,

1:23:09.540 --> 1:23:11.320
 but they have nothing to do with neurogenesis,

1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:13.100
 at least no data support it.

1:23:13.100 --> 1:23:16.740
 But because you can't make new neurons,

1:23:16.740 --> 1:23:19.060
 you also can't damage the ones you've got

1:23:19.060 --> 1:23:20.820
 or you shouldn't as much as possible.

1:23:20.820 --> 1:23:25.080
 And that's why you have a blood-brain barrier or a BBB.

1:23:25.080 --> 1:23:28.900
 So the BBB, as it's called,

1:23:28.900 --> 1:23:32.160
 prevents substances from getting to the brain.

1:23:33.000 --> 1:23:36.140
 However, like any fence,

1:23:36.140 --> 1:23:39.440
 it is not always uniform along its length.

1:23:39.440 --> 1:23:42.300
 And there are little spots within that fence

1:23:42.300 --> 1:23:45.620
 where chemicals can sneak across to the brain

1:23:45.620 --> 1:23:48.860
 and through a beautiful design,

1:23:48.860 --> 1:23:50.680
 I don't know anything about the design,

1:23:50.680 --> 1:23:52.620
 as I always say, I wasn't consulted the design phase,

1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:55.060
 so I'm not talking about any kind of intelligent design

1:23:55.060 --> 1:23:57.320
 or anything, that is not the topic of this podcast.

1:23:57.320 --> 1:23:58.900
 This is not a philosophy podcast,

1:23:58.900 --> 1:24:01.900
 nor is it a religion podcast, it's a science podcast.

1:24:01.900 --> 1:24:04.460
 But through a beautiful design of some sort,

1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:08.460
 there are little holes in that fence

1:24:08.460 --> 1:24:10.100
 and there are little neurons

1:24:10.100 --> 1:24:12.060
 that sit right behind those holes.

1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:17.060
 And those neurons sense what the chemistry of the blood is.

1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:18.900
 So I'm guessing you probably didn't imagine

1:24:18.900 --> 1:24:20.660
 that today's discussion about sensing the self

1:24:20.660 --> 1:24:23.480
 would be sensing your own blood, but you do.

1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:26.500
 There's a little area of your brain that's little indeed,

1:24:26.500 --> 1:24:29.760
 but is very, very important called area postrema,

1:24:29.760 --> 1:24:32.880
 P-O-S-T-R-E-M-A.

1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:35.620
 An area postrema is an area of the brainstem

1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:38.780
 that sits right next to another brain area

1:24:38.780 --> 1:24:41.880
 called the chemoreceptor trigger zone.

1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:45.060
 And when the contents in your bloodstream

1:24:45.940 --> 1:24:47.500
 are of a particular kind,

1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:51.920
 meaning when there are pathogens or it's too acidic,

1:24:52.980 --> 1:24:55.500
 the neurons in area postrema

1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:58.500
 and the neurons in the chemoreceptor trigger zone,

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.660
 the CTZ as it's called,

1:25:00.660 --> 1:25:05.620
 trigger a bunch of motor reflexes in the abdominal wall

1:25:05.620 --> 1:25:09.740
 that make you barf, okay?

1:25:09.740 --> 1:25:12.440
 The feeling that you need to throw up

1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:14.300
 is triggered by these neurons in the brainstem.

1:25:14.300 --> 1:25:15.420
 And those neurons in the brainstem

1:25:15.420 --> 1:25:18.380
 are triggered by the presence of certain chemicals.

1:25:18.380 --> 1:25:20.940
 And the reason why you don't have any blood brain barrier

1:25:20.940 --> 1:25:23.940
 at that location is because postrema has to be there

1:25:23.940 --> 1:25:25.300
 like a crossing guard,

1:25:25.300 --> 1:25:26.700
 making sure that everything

1:25:26.700 --> 1:25:28.940
 that's coming through the blood is okay.

1:25:28.940 --> 1:25:31.580
 And if it even senses just the tiniest bit

1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:35.180
 that things are off, it's going to trigger that reflex.

1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:36.400
 Now, the really interesting thing

1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:38.660
 is that the neurons in area postrema

1:25:38.660 --> 1:25:41.440
 respond to the chemistry of the blood,

1:25:41.440 --> 1:25:44.700
 but they also will respond to our consciousness,

1:25:44.700 --> 1:25:47.180
 to things that we think and things that we believe

1:25:47.180 --> 1:25:49.560
 and even particular memories.

1:25:49.560 --> 1:25:53.060
 This is why when certain people see vomit

1:25:53.060 --> 1:25:56.500
 or see someone else vomit or even somebody else heaving

1:25:56.500 --> 1:25:57.940
 as if they're going to vomit,

1:25:57.940 --> 1:26:00.460
 they themselves feel as if they're going to vomit.

1:26:00.460 --> 1:26:03.020
 I'm guessing there are probably even a few of you right now

1:26:03.020 --> 1:26:04.860
 that feel like you might vomit.

1:26:04.860 --> 1:26:07.500
 You might feel salivation in your throat,

1:26:07.500 --> 1:26:09.500
 which is always a precursor to vomiting.

1:26:10.820 --> 1:26:13.280
 Some people, the memory of,

1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:16.060
 or the thought of something like blood or vomit

1:26:16.060 --> 1:26:18.660
 or use your imagination can actually trigger

1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:20.500
 the vomit reflex.

1:26:20.500 --> 1:26:23.700
 And that's because these neurons in area postrema

1:26:23.700 --> 1:26:27.500
 are very sensitive to prior experience of interactions

1:26:27.500 --> 1:26:29.440
 with negative things.

1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:31.100
 So, and actually, as I'm saying this,

1:26:31.100 --> 1:26:32.740
 I feel my gut kind of cramping up again.

1:26:32.740 --> 1:26:35.020
 I don't vomit very easily.

1:26:35.020 --> 1:26:36.120
 I'm not one of those.

1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:39.520
 Nor am I somebody who's never vomited.

1:26:40.380 --> 1:26:42.700
 And here we are talking about my vomit history,

1:26:42.700 --> 1:26:45.720
 but I think it's appropriate in this context.

1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:48.220
 The neurons of area postrema

1:26:48.220 --> 1:26:51.780
 are there basically to keep your whole system safe.

1:26:51.780 --> 1:26:54.980
 And thank goodness they are because for instance,

1:26:54.980 --> 1:26:56.960
 some people, unfortunately,

1:26:56.960 --> 1:26:59.260
 they drink so much alcohol that they throw up.

1:26:59.260 --> 1:27:00.560
 Have you ever wondered why that is?

1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:04.140
 Well, it's because alcohol fundamentally is a poison.

1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:06.620
 I'm not saying for age appropriate folks

1:27:06.620 --> 1:27:08.460
 that ingesting alcohol is bad.

1:27:08.460 --> 1:27:09.860
 This isn't a judgment call,

1:27:09.860 --> 1:27:14.160
 but alcohol itself at excessive levels in the bloodstream

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:17.420
 triggers postrema to cause vomiting.

1:27:17.420 --> 1:27:22.420
 So this is an example whereby memories, context,

1:27:23.180 --> 1:27:25.540
 but also just the chemistry of our internal state

1:27:25.540 --> 1:27:29.100
 is triggering behaviors that are very hardwired.

1:27:29.100 --> 1:27:30.420
 They're very reflex driven.

1:27:30.420 --> 1:27:32.620
 And why would it be that some people

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:35.020
 get more nauseous than others at a given level?

1:27:35.020 --> 1:27:37.060
 Well, they'll have to do with alcohol tolerance.

1:27:37.060 --> 1:27:39.060
 Some people have what's called a,

1:27:39.060 --> 1:27:42.580
 we refer to as a stronger stomach or a stomach of steel.

1:27:42.580 --> 1:27:45.220
 Other people, they throw up very easily

1:27:45.220 --> 1:27:46.820
 if they don't feel well,

1:27:46.820 --> 1:27:49.420
 or if they ingest anything that's just a little bit off.

1:27:49.420 --> 1:27:52.780
 From a purely adaptive standpoint,

1:27:52.780 --> 1:27:55.540
 it's probably better to vomit up things

1:27:55.540 --> 1:27:56.380
 that aren't good for you

1:27:56.380 --> 1:27:58.860
 rather than to have them pass through your system,

1:27:58.860 --> 1:28:02.580
 especially if those things are contained in lipids.

1:28:02.580 --> 1:28:04.980
 For instance, if you ingest something that's in lipid form,

1:28:04.980 --> 1:28:07.320
 because cells, literally every cell in your body

1:28:07.320 --> 1:28:10.180
 is surrounded by a little thin layer of fatty tissue,

1:28:10.180 --> 1:28:13.920
 and we call it the bilayer membrane, it's a little membrane,

1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:16.420
 fat can move through fat very easily.

1:28:16.420 --> 1:28:18.580
 And so any bad stuff you ingest

1:28:18.580 --> 1:28:20.460
 can get stuck in your system.

1:28:20.460 --> 1:28:23.820
 So let's talk for a second about how to reduce nausea,

1:28:23.820 --> 1:28:25.900
 because nausea, that salivation,

1:28:25.900 --> 1:28:27.800
 that feeling that you're going to vomit

1:28:27.800 --> 1:28:31.560
 can be very beneficial in an adaptive circumstance,

1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:32.780
 like you've ingested something bad,

1:28:32.780 --> 1:28:36.100
 but some people experience nausea for other reasons.

1:28:36.100 --> 1:28:39.000
 There are good ways to regulate nausea,

1:28:39.000 --> 1:28:41.780
 and the ways they regulate nausea are very interesting.

1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:43.900
 They actually adjust the activity

1:28:43.900 --> 1:28:46.220
 of these neurons in the area of postrema,

1:28:46.220 --> 1:28:49.620
 or they change the chemistry of the blood directly.

1:28:49.620 --> 1:28:52.300
 And many of you have heard this before, perhaps,

1:28:52.300 --> 1:28:54.500
 but it turns out that there are good data.

1:28:54.500 --> 1:28:57.020
 11 research studies were the ones that I could find,

1:28:57.020 --> 1:28:59.280
 peer-reviewed research studies with no bias,

1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:02.180
 so independent studies, showing that ginger

1:29:02.180 --> 1:29:06.160
 can cause a notable reduction in nausea.

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:07.080
 How much ginger?

1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:08.180
 One to three grams.

1:29:08.180 --> 1:29:09.100
 What's one to three grams?

1:29:09.100 --> 1:29:10.340
 Well, you have to measure it out on a scale

1:29:10.340 --> 1:29:12.220
 unless you're taking it in pill or capsule form.

1:29:12.220 --> 1:29:13.420
 It doesn't seem to matter if you take it

1:29:13.420 --> 1:29:14.780
 in pill or capsule form.

1:29:14.780 --> 1:29:16.780
 So this thing that you've heard before,

1:29:16.780 --> 1:29:20.260
 that ginger can reduce nausea indeed is true.

1:29:21.460 --> 1:29:23.500
 Peppermint apparently can also do that,

1:29:23.500 --> 1:29:26.340
 and some of you will not be surprised to learn

1:29:26.340 --> 1:29:29.000
 that cannabis can reduce nausea.

1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:30.580
 Not surprised because cannabis,

1:29:30.580 --> 1:29:32.820
 which has different legality in different places,

1:29:32.820 --> 1:29:33.660
 and I understand that,

1:29:33.660 --> 1:29:35.160
 so please take that into consideration,

1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:40.160
 but cannabis, THC, and, or it turns out CBD,

1:29:40.220 --> 1:29:41.420
 can reduce nausea.

1:29:41.420 --> 1:29:44.020
 That's been shown in at least one study,

1:29:44.020 --> 1:29:46.180
 and it probably does that,

1:29:46.180 --> 1:29:48.140
 not by changing the chemistry of your blood,

1:29:48.140 --> 1:29:51.460
 but by changing the threshold for firing

1:29:51.460 --> 1:29:53.380
 of these neurons in area postrema.

1:29:53.380 --> 1:29:56.140
 And there are conditions such as in chemotherapy

1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:58.020
 and radiation therapy and others

1:29:58.020 --> 1:30:00.420
 where people are feeling very nauseous.

1:30:00.420 --> 1:30:02.120
 I'm not recommending people go use cannabis

1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:05.460
 unless they've decided with their selves

1:30:05.460 --> 1:30:07.460
 and their family and their doctor that they should.

1:30:07.460 --> 1:30:09.300
 But what's interesting is this thing about CBD,

1:30:09.300 --> 1:30:11.460
 and we'll do a whole episode on THC and CBD.

1:30:11.460 --> 1:30:13.680
 CBD doesn't have, or isn't supposed to have,

1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:16.140
 these psychoactive properties that THC does,

1:30:16.140 --> 1:30:19.860
 although CBD can have a mild to major anxiolytic,

1:30:19.860 --> 1:30:21.460
 anxiety-reducing effect,

1:30:21.460 --> 1:30:24.980
 but it does appear that the data are what,

1:30:24.980 --> 1:30:27.020
 the data support, I should say,

1:30:27.020 --> 1:30:29.620
 the anecdotal reports,

1:30:29.620 --> 1:30:33.420
 which are that cannabis can reduce nausea.

1:30:33.420 --> 1:30:36.480
 So to barf less, ginger, peppermint,

1:30:36.480 --> 1:30:40.000
 and if appropriate and legal for you, possibly cannabis.

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.180
 Now let's talk about fever.

1:30:42.180 --> 1:30:45.520
 In previous episodes and in future episodes,

1:30:45.520 --> 1:30:47.380
 we deal with thermal regulation,

1:30:47.380 --> 1:30:50.860
 which is the body's ability to regulate its temperature.

1:30:50.860 --> 1:30:53.720
 Talk about cold and heat and saunas and ice baths

1:30:53.720 --> 1:30:55.340
 and physical performance.

1:30:55.340 --> 1:30:58.380
 We're not going to deal with all that right now,

1:30:58.380 --> 1:31:00.020
 but I promise we will going forward.

1:31:00.020 --> 1:31:02.620
 Today, I only want to talk about fever

1:31:02.620 --> 1:31:06.340
 because fever directly relates to interoception.

1:31:07.180 --> 1:31:08.100
 What do I mean by that?

1:31:08.100 --> 1:31:12.140
 Well, a fever is simply an increase in body temperature.

1:31:12.140 --> 1:31:14.060
 That increase in body temperature is triggered

1:31:14.060 --> 1:31:16.240
 by neurons in the brain.

1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:18.240
 And those neurons in the brain are triggered

1:31:18.240 --> 1:31:21.140
 by the presence of particular things in the bloodstream.

1:31:22.740 --> 1:31:24.040
 What sorts of things?

1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:28.180
 Well, toxins, bacteria, viruses.

1:31:28.180 --> 1:31:30.600
 When something bad gets in our system,

1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:33.180
 the body doesn't know it's bad.

1:31:33.180 --> 1:31:36.460
 It just knows it's foreign and it hasn't seen it before

1:31:36.460 --> 1:31:39.100
 or that it's in the wrong compartment of the body.

1:31:39.100 --> 1:31:40.540
 So earlier we were talking about proteins

1:31:40.540 --> 1:31:42.900
 that leak out of the gut and get elsewhere.

1:31:42.900 --> 1:31:45.220
 You don't want a piece of steak sitting in your bicep.

1:31:45.220 --> 1:31:46.060
 That would be bad.

1:31:46.060 --> 1:31:47.060
 You would actually develop antibodies.

1:31:47.060 --> 1:31:48.940
 You would have a horrible infection,

1:31:48.940 --> 1:31:51.560
 but your body has this intelligence.

1:31:51.560 --> 1:31:53.140
 And that intelligence is to know,

1:31:53.140 --> 1:31:56.500
 hmm, these proteins are normally not seen in this region.

1:31:56.500 --> 1:31:58.980
 And then your body or the cells there, I should say,

1:31:58.980 --> 1:32:02.800
 will release something that then will travel to the brain

1:32:02.800 --> 1:32:05.380
 and will trigger an increase in body temperature

1:32:05.380 --> 1:32:07.780
 so that your body cooks the bad thing

1:32:07.780 --> 1:32:09.060
 or the cause of the bad thing.

1:32:09.060 --> 1:32:11.080
 It's really a beautiful adaptive mechanism.

1:32:11.080 --> 1:32:12.500
 We always think fever is so terrible,

1:32:12.500 --> 1:32:16.240
 but fever is there to cook the bad thing that's inside you

1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:18.840
 or that has left the correct compartment inside you

1:32:18.840 --> 1:32:22.700
 and is in the wrong compartment inside you.

1:32:22.700 --> 1:32:26.380
 So what's beautiful about the fever mechanism

1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:28.940
 is that it looks a lot like the barfing mechanism.

1:32:28.940 --> 1:32:31.280
 Basically, you have a set of neurons

1:32:31.280 --> 1:32:32.980
 that sit near the ventricles.

1:32:32.980 --> 1:32:34.780
 Remember the ventricles is this hole

1:32:34.780 --> 1:32:38.080
 in the tube that is you, the tube that is you.

1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:40.060
 You are a tube, a series of tubes,

1:32:40.060 --> 1:32:42.200
 and your brain has a hole down the middle

1:32:42.200 --> 1:32:44.580
 and it extends down to the bottom of your spinal cord.

1:32:44.580 --> 1:32:46.760
 At the front, it's called the ventricles.

1:32:46.760 --> 1:32:48.600
 They start with what are called the lateral ventricles

1:32:48.600 --> 1:32:49.780
 and the, excuse me,

1:32:49.780 --> 1:32:52.220
 starts with the third in the lateral ventricles

1:32:52.220 --> 1:32:53.660
 and then it goes to the fourth ventricle

1:32:53.660 --> 1:32:54.980
 and then to what's called the central canal.

1:32:54.980 --> 1:32:56.580
 But basically, it's just a big space

1:32:56.580 --> 1:32:58.000
 in the middle of your nervous system,

1:32:58.000 --> 1:32:58.900
 the middle of your brain.

1:32:58.900 --> 1:33:01.100
 And you have one ventricle that I already mentioned

1:33:01.100 --> 1:33:02.440
 called the third ventricle

1:33:02.440 --> 1:33:06.580
 and it's shaped kind of like a thin oval upright.

1:33:06.580 --> 1:33:09.060
 If you're listening to this, just think an eye,

1:33:09.060 --> 1:33:10.140
 just seeing the shape of an eye,

1:33:10.140 --> 1:33:12.920
 but it's kind of rotated 90 degrees.

1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:15.900
 So it's up and down as opposed to across.

1:33:15.900 --> 1:33:19.180
 And along that third ventricle,

1:33:19.180 --> 1:33:22.220
 there are little neurons that can sense what's

1:33:22.220 --> 1:33:24.700
 in the cerebral spinal fluid that fills the ventricle.

1:33:24.700 --> 1:33:27.260
 So in other words, you have neurons that are sensing

1:33:27.260 --> 1:33:29.560
 the chemistry of your cerebral spinal fluid

1:33:30.500 --> 1:33:33.360
 and that have access, therefore,

1:33:33.360 --> 1:33:35.880
 to the chemistry of your body

1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:37.820
 because that cerebral spinal fluid

1:33:37.820 --> 1:33:39.980
 is going up and down the brain and spinal cord,

1:33:39.980 --> 1:33:42.540
 but into that cerebral spinal fluid

1:33:42.540 --> 1:33:44.820
 are signals about the various chemicals within the body.

1:33:44.820 --> 1:33:46.900
 So this is not a mechanical system.

1:33:46.900 --> 1:33:48.620
 This is a chemical system.

1:33:48.620 --> 1:33:50.620
 Remember, we're talking about mechanical information

1:33:50.620 --> 1:33:53.540
 and chemical information accessing the brain.

1:33:53.540 --> 1:33:57.400
 So if you have something bad in your system,

1:33:57.400 --> 1:34:00.160
 you've ingested a virus, you breathed in a virus,

1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:03.580
 or you inhaled some bacteria, or you got a cut on your leg

1:34:03.580 --> 1:34:05.600
 and some bacteria are growing there,

1:34:06.860 --> 1:34:09.400
 of course, locally, there will be effects.

1:34:09.400 --> 1:34:12.580
 Little things called mast cells, M-A-S-T,

1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:13.900
 little packets of histamine,

1:34:13.900 --> 1:34:17.900
 literally will go there and explode and cause inflammation,

1:34:17.900 --> 1:34:19.460
 which is actually a good inflammation,

1:34:19.460 --> 1:34:21.620
 and will release little things called macrophages,

1:34:21.620 --> 1:34:23.720
 try to gobble up the infection.

1:34:23.720 --> 1:34:25.220
 The other day, I was in Texas,

1:34:25.220 --> 1:34:26.960
 there was a mean little mosquitoes in Texas

1:34:26.960 --> 1:34:29.260
 and a lot of them, and I would stand outside

1:34:29.260 --> 1:34:30.100
 and I'd get bitten.

1:34:30.100 --> 1:34:32.900
 I didn't feel a thing, but then later that night,

1:34:32.900 --> 1:34:34.540
 they started swelling up and itching

1:34:34.540 --> 1:34:36.760
 and then I'd itch them and then they'd swell even more.

1:34:36.760 --> 1:34:39.380
 That was because of the release of mast cells,

1:34:39.380 --> 1:34:41.700
 of histamines inside those mast cells

1:34:41.700 --> 1:34:43.700
 that were literally causing inflammation of the tissue.

1:34:43.700 --> 1:34:45.900
 It wasn't the poison from the mosquito itself.

1:34:45.900 --> 1:34:48.380
 It was the immune response to those.

1:34:48.380 --> 1:34:53.380
 Well, you also have this systemic or body-wide attempt

1:34:53.380 --> 1:34:55.960
 to kill stuff, and that's the fever.

1:34:55.960 --> 1:34:58.180
 So the neurons that line these ventricles

1:34:58.180 --> 1:35:01.220
 with cerebrospinal fluid go by a particular name.

1:35:01.220 --> 1:35:03.660
 They're called circumventricular organs,

1:35:03.660 --> 1:35:07.460
 meaning near, circumventricular, near the ventricles,

1:35:07.460 --> 1:35:10.100
 and you have these organs and there is a set of neurons

1:35:10.100 --> 1:35:12.420
 has a really cool name called the OVLT.

1:35:12.420 --> 1:35:13.740
 I don't know why I like that, but I just like it.

1:35:13.740 --> 1:35:17.940
 It's the organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis.

1:35:17.940 --> 1:35:21.780
 Organum vasculosum lateral terminalis, OVLT,

1:35:21.780 --> 1:35:25.380
 are the neurons that respond to toxins

1:35:25.380 --> 1:35:27.220
 and bad stuff in your bloodstream,

1:35:27.220 --> 1:35:28.940
 however minor or major,

1:35:28.940 --> 1:35:32.820
 and they release things like ILK-1,

1:35:32.820 --> 1:35:34.960
 which are inflammatory cytokines.

1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:36.840
 Inflammatory in this case is good.

1:35:36.840 --> 1:35:39.820
 You want inflammation at the site of an infection.

1:35:39.820 --> 1:35:41.300
 It's a good thing.

1:35:41.300 --> 1:35:43.180
 It's going to help with healing.

1:35:43.180 --> 1:35:46.240
 And it's going to change the conditions in your body.

1:35:46.240 --> 1:35:49.100
 What's going to happen is when those OVLT neurons

1:35:49.100 --> 1:35:51.500
 are activated because you have something bad in your body

1:35:51.500 --> 1:35:54.700
 or something bad is happening in your body,

1:35:54.700 --> 1:35:56.220
 they communicate with an area of the brain

1:35:56.220 --> 1:35:58.780
 called the preoptic area of your hypothalamus,

1:35:58.780 --> 1:36:01.420
 and the preoptic area cranks up your temperature

1:36:01.420 --> 1:36:03.160
 and tries to cook that bad thing.

1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:07.420
 Now, it's worth talking about fever for a moment

1:36:07.420 --> 1:36:08.900
 and talking about thermal regulation

1:36:08.900 --> 1:36:12.160
 because I think this actually could save some lives.

1:36:12.160 --> 1:36:16.940
 So if you are overheated to a point

1:36:16.940 --> 1:36:19.500
 where you're getting up past 102 or 103,

1:36:19.500 --> 1:36:21.540
 it's going to vary depending on person to person

1:36:21.540 --> 1:36:22.980
 and certainly age.

1:36:22.980 --> 1:36:24.900
 Kids, some people think,

1:36:24.900 --> 1:36:26.940
 can tolerate higher levels of fever than adults,

1:36:26.940 --> 1:36:28.660
 but look, you always want to be cautious

1:36:28.660 --> 1:36:30.060
 about heating up the brain too much

1:36:30.060 --> 1:36:32.380
 because once those neurons are gone, they do not come back

1:36:32.380 --> 1:36:35.340
 and neurons do not do well in very high temperatures.

1:36:35.340 --> 1:36:39.900
 Once your body temperature starts getting up to 102, 103,

1:36:39.900 --> 1:36:43.460
 certainly 104, you are starting to enter serious danger zone.

1:36:43.460 --> 1:36:46.540
 This can happen through exercise in hot environments

1:36:46.540 --> 1:36:49.220
 or an inability to escape heat

1:36:49.220 --> 1:36:50.440
 because you don't have covering

1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:53.520
 or adequate ventilation or cooling.

1:36:53.520 --> 1:36:55.620
 It can also be because of excessive fever

1:36:55.620 --> 1:36:56.920
 for whatever reason.

1:36:56.920 --> 1:36:59.100
 A lot of people think the way to deal with this

1:36:59.100 --> 1:37:01.900
 is to put a cool compress on the back of the neck

1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:04.300
 or to cool the torso.

1:37:05.240 --> 1:37:08.140
 In discussing this with my colleague, Craig Heller,

1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:11.180
 who's at Stanford School of Medicine,

1:37:11.180 --> 1:37:13.740
 and he's on the undergraduate side of the campus as well,

1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:14.820
 runs a biology lab.

1:37:14.820 --> 1:37:17.320
 He's a world expert in thermal regulation.

1:37:17.320 --> 1:37:20.220
 It's very clear that that's the wrong response

1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:21.700
 to try and cool off the body.

1:37:22.820 --> 1:37:26.740
 If you put a cold towel or you put an ice pack

1:37:26.740 --> 1:37:27.580
 on the back of the neck,

1:37:27.580 --> 1:37:29.700
 what you effectively do is cool the blood

1:37:29.700 --> 1:37:31.260
 that's going to the brain.

1:37:31.260 --> 1:37:34.780
 And if you do that, then your brain will react

1:37:34.780 --> 1:37:38.420
 by turning up the crank in, so to speak,

1:37:38.420 --> 1:37:40.500
 on the neurons in the preoptic area

1:37:40.500 --> 1:37:41.820
 and will heat you up further

1:37:41.820 --> 1:37:44.700
 and can cook your brain and organs further.

1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:47.220
 So what you want to do is, as I've talked about before,

1:37:47.220 --> 1:37:50.500
 you want to cool the bottoms of the feet,

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:53.620
 the palms of the hands, and the upper part of the face.

1:37:53.620 --> 1:37:55.440
 I'm not going to go into all the details

1:37:55.440 --> 1:37:57.100
 as to why you want to do that right now,

1:37:57.100 --> 1:37:58.780
 but those are the locations you want to cool.

1:37:58.780 --> 1:38:00.860
 Now, you can also cool the rest of the body,

1:38:00.860 --> 1:38:03.260
 but it's not okay to just stay under the covers

1:38:03.260 --> 1:38:06.340
 and just cool the neck or something like that.

1:38:06.340 --> 1:38:09.180
 You really want to try and create a systemic

1:38:09.180 --> 1:38:12.120
 or whole body cooling if the goal is to bring fever down.

1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:14.060
 But in many cases, fever is adaptive.

1:38:14.060 --> 1:38:17.700
 And so taking non-steroid and inflammatory drugs

1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:21.740
 like Advil and Tylenol sometimes can be good

1:38:21.740 --> 1:38:22.580
 if that's recommended,

1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:24.540
 but other times, because it reduces your fever,

1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:26.940
 it's allowing that pathogen,

1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:28.680
 that pyrogen it's sometimes called.

1:38:28.680 --> 1:38:30.900
 A pyrogen is a substance that causes fever.

1:38:30.900 --> 1:38:35.520
 Think pyro, think fire, think pyromaniacs, think pyro.

1:38:36.500 --> 1:38:40.420
 Those pyrogens can survive at moderate to low temperatures

1:38:40.420 --> 1:38:41.840
 and they can't survive at high temperatures.

1:38:41.840 --> 1:38:44.620
 So the fever is an adaptive mechanism and the OVLT

1:38:44.620 --> 1:38:48.380
 and the sensing of your chemistry is how the OVLT,

1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:51.580
 organum vasculosum and the lateral terminalis, does that.

1:38:51.580 --> 1:38:55.220
 So we've talked about sensing lung volume,

1:38:55.220 --> 1:38:56.340
 speed of our heartbeat.

1:38:56.340 --> 1:38:59.200
 We talked about sensing the gut volume,

1:38:59.200 --> 1:39:01.520
 the intestinal volume or the absence of volume.

1:39:01.520 --> 1:39:06.520
 We talked about chemistry of the gut and the gut microbiota

1:39:06.820 --> 1:39:08.380
 and autoimmune functions.

1:39:08.380 --> 1:39:11.020
 And we've now talked about vomiting

1:39:11.020 --> 1:39:13.120
 and we've talked about fever.

1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:16.120
 Lots of aspects of sensing our internal self.

1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:19.540
 Now I want to turn our attention to interoception

1:39:19.540 --> 1:39:22.220
 as it relates to feelings,

1:39:22.220 --> 1:39:25.320
 the way that interoception is most commonly described.

1:39:25.320 --> 1:39:27.020
 And I want to highlight a term

1:39:27.020 --> 1:39:28.260
 that many of you have probably heard,

1:39:28.260 --> 1:39:29.820
 which is the vagus nerve.

1:39:29.820 --> 1:39:31.480
 We talked about vagus a little bit earlier,

1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:35.760
 but the vagus nerve, this vagabonding wandering nerve

1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:39.620
 is involved in everything I've talked about up until now.

1:39:39.620 --> 1:39:41.740
 And the reason I saved it till now,

1:39:41.740 --> 1:39:43.120
 rather than mentioning it all along,

1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:45.180
 is to highlight a specific point,

1:39:45.180 --> 1:39:47.460
 which is that whenever we hear about the vagus

1:39:47.460 --> 1:39:50.020
 in popular culture, it's like the vagus calms you down.

1:39:50.020 --> 1:39:51.160
 You want to stimulate the vagus

1:39:51.160 --> 1:39:52.540
 by rubbing in front of the ear.

1:39:52.540 --> 1:39:54.900
 And it's a parasympathetic nerve and it will calm you down.

1:39:54.900 --> 1:39:55.720
 It will mellow you out.

1:39:55.720 --> 1:39:59.700
 And actually, most of the time, the vagus is stimulatory.

1:39:59.700 --> 1:40:02.980
 When you ingest foods with amino acids, sugars,

1:40:02.980 --> 1:40:07.340
 or fatty acids, the vagus nerve gets activated

1:40:07.340 --> 1:40:08.820
 and triggers the release of dopamine.

1:40:08.820 --> 1:40:12.080
 It makes you more alert and go seek more of those foods

1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:13.680
 or what led to those conditions.

1:40:14.820 --> 1:40:17.220
 When you feel nauseous, it's rarely calming.

1:40:17.220 --> 1:40:20.100
 When you feel like you have a fever, it's rarely calming.

1:40:20.100 --> 1:40:21.380
 So you're starting to get the picture

1:40:21.380 --> 1:40:23.940
 that even though the vagus nerve

1:40:23.940 --> 1:40:26.200
 is in the parasympathetic branch

1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:27.500
 of the autonomic nervous system,

1:40:27.500 --> 1:40:28.740
 and if that doesn't mean anything to you

1:40:28.740 --> 1:40:30.960
 because you're not an aficionado, don't worry about it,

1:40:30.960 --> 1:40:33.240
 but it's not a calming system.

1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:36.500
 It's a communication system and it's a motor system.

1:40:36.500 --> 1:40:38.800
 It communicates brain to body and body to brain,

1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:41.440
 and it changes the function of different organs.

1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:45.160
 Now, one thing that's important to highlight

1:40:45.160 --> 1:40:50.160
 is that stress itself will alter the chemistry of your gut

1:40:50.160 --> 1:40:54.840
 because of the ways that it shuts down the vagus nerve

1:40:54.840 --> 1:40:58.140
 and quiets the neurons that communicate from gut to brain.

1:40:58.140 --> 1:40:59.260
 I want to say that again.

1:40:59.260 --> 1:41:03.200
 Stress will disrupt your gut and make you feel not good,

1:41:03.200 --> 1:41:05.840
 poor digestion, and just lousy,

1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:09.120
 because of the way that it shuts down the vagus nerve

1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:10.700
 and the neurons of your gut.

1:41:10.700 --> 1:41:13.900
 So what stress does is it blocks the communication

1:41:13.900 --> 1:41:15.340
 between gut and brain.

1:41:15.340 --> 1:41:16.740
 It doesn't mess up your gut.

1:41:16.740 --> 1:41:18.740
 It just doesn't let your gut get the signals

1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:22.420
 up to your brain, and it also then throws off the chemistry,

1:41:22.420 --> 1:41:24.180
 and then there's a whole cascade of effects.

1:41:24.180 --> 1:41:25.460
 If you want to learn more about stress,

1:41:25.460 --> 1:41:27.820
 I did a whole episode called Master Stress,

1:41:27.820 --> 1:41:29.160
 or I think maybe it was called Conquer Stress.

1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:30.460
 I think it was Master Stress.

1:41:30.460 --> 1:41:32.480
 Either one, the whole point of that episode

1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:33.840
 is to give you tools and practices

1:41:33.840 --> 1:41:37.260
 to deal with short-term acute stress, moderate-term stress,

1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:40.820
 and long-term chronic stress through behavioral mechanisms,

1:41:40.820 --> 1:41:45.100
 nutrition, supplementation, and many other things as well.

1:41:45.100 --> 1:41:49.160
 It's chock-a-block full of protocols and tools for stress.

1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:53.900
 The vagus nerve, however, is responsible for emotion,

1:41:53.900 --> 1:41:57.020
 and the way it does that is to pool,

1:41:57.020 --> 1:42:00.420
 to aggregate the conditions of your gut,

1:42:00.420 --> 1:42:01.980
 the conditions of your heart

1:42:01.980 --> 1:42:03.900
 and the conditions of your breathing,

1:42:03.900 --> 1:42:05.940
 which includes your diaphragm and lungs,

1:42:05.940 --> 1:42:10.700
 and takes that kind of as a collection of information

1:42:10.700 --> 1:42:12.420
 and sends it to the brain

1:42:12.420 --> 1:42:15.800
 and controls what we call your emotions.

1:42:15.800 --> 1:42:19.040
 Now, that might seem obvious to some people,

1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:21.580
 but to other people, that might seem totally crazy.

1:42:21.580 --> 1:42:24.340
 You thought your emotions were because the market was down

1:42:24.340 --> 1:42:25.680
 and you had invested,

1:42:25.680 --> 1:42:28.180
 or because something that you thought was going to happen

1:42:28.180 --> 1:42:29.920
 is not going to happen,

1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:33.140
 or because you thought that school was going to open

1:42:33.140 --> 1:42:34.140
 and then it's not,

1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:36.200
 or maybe you thought it wasn't and it is.

1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:37.760
 Whatever it is that bothers you,

1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:41.300
 you think of generally as a purely cognitive event,

1:42:41.300 --> 1:42:43.900
 but the brain doesn't really know

1:42:43.900 --> 1:42:45.740
 what to do with that information.

1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:48.900
 It doesn't act directly on that information to create moods.

1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:52.400
 Moods are created through the heart's response

1:42:52.400 --> 1:42:54.380
 to reading that headline,

1:42:54.380 --> 1:42:55.820
 to the change in your breathing

1:42:55.820 --> 1:42:58.820
 that's caused by someone that you love telling you

1:42:58.820 --> 1:43:00.500
 that actually they're not interested

1:43:00.500 --> 1:43:01.700
 in spending time with you anymore,

1:43:01.700 --> 1:43:02.620
 or that you screwed up,

1:43:02.620 --> 1:43:04.100
 or that they're interested in spending

1:43:04.100 --> 1:43:06.700
 a lot of time with you and you like that, right?

1:43:06.700 --> 1:43:09.460
 Emotions can be good or bad or neutral.

1:43:09.460 --> 1:43:12.720
 So this thing that we call interoception,

1:43:12.720 --> 1:43:13.580
 the sense of self,

1:43:13.580 --> 1:43:16.260
 I've been building up from very fundamental layers,

1:43:16.260 --> 1:43:20.340
 gut chemistry, spleens, immune systems, autoimmune,

1:43:20.340 --> 1:43:21.500
 and you might've been thinking,

1:43:21.500 --> 1:43:24.180
 wait, I thought this was going to be about a sense of self,

1:43:24.180 --> 1:43:26.500
 a noticing or a feeling.

1:43:26.500 --> 1:43:29.540
 And indeed all of those things are plugging in

1:43:29.540 --> 1:43:32.100
 like a series of ingredients in a recipe

1:43:32.100 --> 1:43:35.300
 that gives rise to your mood and how you feel.

1:43:35.300 --> 1:43:37.540
 And that mood and how you feel

1:43:37.540 --> 1:43:41.780
 is shown in one location in your body

1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:43.320
 that other people can see,

1:43:43.320 --> 1:43:45.760
 and that's in your facial expressions.

1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:48.320
 And indeed there are now beautiful data

1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:51.620
 showing that your face,

1:43:51.620 --> 1:43:53.880
 including the size of your pupils,

1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:55.280
 the tonality of your face,

1:43:55.280 --> 1:43:59.080
 how flushed you are or how pale you are,

1:43:59.080 --> 1:44:02.520
 even the degree to which you are frowning or smiling

1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:05.240
 relative to other periods of time,

1:44:05.240 --> 1:44:09.000
 that is all an aggregate of,

1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.280
 or a reflection rather of your gut,

1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:12.720
 your heart and your breathing

1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:14.480
 and the chemistry of your body.

1:44:14.480 --> 1:44:17.360
 And so this is why I sort of backed into this conversation

1:44:17.360 --> 1:44:18.240
 about interoception.

1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:21.800
 I kind of Trojan horse this on you on purpose,

1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:24.320
 which is that when we talk about the vagus and you hear,

1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:26.720
 oh, you know, you can get vagal tone by breathing

1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:27.720
 or rubbing on the front of the ear,

1:44:27.720 --> 1:44:29.480
 sure, that's probably true.

1:44:29.480 --> 1:44:33.880
 But another fundamental layer is the acidity of your gut,

1:44:33.880 --> 1:44:35.060
 how fast you're breathing.

1:44:35.060 --> 1:44:40.040
 Are you inhale emphasized or exhale emphasized breathing?

1:44:40.040 --> 1:44:44.720
 When we are relaxed, our pupils tend to constrict.

1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:49.100
 When we are very alert, our pupils tend to be dilated,

1:44:49.100 --> 1:44:50.880
 whether or not that alertness has to do

1:44:50.880 --> 1:44:53.600
 with being happy or being sad.

1:44:53.600 --> 1:44:54.840
 And what's remarkable,

1:44:54.840 --> 1:44:57.640
 and this is where interoception really, really

1:44:57.640 --> 1:44:59.960
 takes a leap into the incredible,

1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:02.820
 is that there are beautiful studies that show

1:45:02.820 --> 1:45:06.100
 that for instance, when we know somebody pretty well,

1:45:06.100 --> 1:45:08.720
 and they are going through some sort of experience

1:45:08.720 --> 1:45:12.220
 of any kind, our heart rate actually starts

1:45:12.220 --> 1:45:14.200
 to mimic their heart rate.

1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:16.200
 Our breathing starts to mimic their breathing

1:45:16.200 --> 1:45:18.740
 even if we aren't conscious of their breathing.

1:45:18.740 --> 1:45:20.640
 It's not like we see their chest heaving

1:45:22.560 --> 1:45:23.520
 and we think, oh my goodness.

1:45:23.520 --> 1:45:25.580
 And then we breathe that way.

1:45:25.580 --> 1:45:27.440
 There's a mirroring and no,

1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:29.000
 it's not carried out through mirror neurons.

1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.120
 Mirror neurons are more of a myth than a reality.

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:32.880
 Sorry to burst people's bubbles,

1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:34.620
 but that bubble around mirror neurons

1:45:34.620 --> 1:45:38.960
 is definitely made of myths and a topic for another time.

1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:41.040
 But we start to mirror.

1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:44.220
 Somehow human beings are able to register

1:45:44.220 --> 1:45:46.280
 the internal state of other beings.

1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:47.760
 And I think probably for animals too,

1:45:47.760 --> 1:45:51.000
 but certainly for other humans, even at a distance.

1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:52.920
 And these studies are many now

1:45:52.920 --> 1:45:54.600
 and they're really wonderful studies.

1:45:54.600 --> 1:45:58.240
 And so your sense of your internal landscape

1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:00.320
 is linked to others.

1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:03.640
 Now you can enhance this interoceptive capacity

1:46:03.640 --> 1:46:05.680
 for how you feel and how others feel.

1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:08.960
 In other words, you can start getting a better readout

1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:13.360
 of your internal state by doing a simple exercise,

1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:15.960
 what is really a tool.

1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:19.520
 And that is to learn to sense your heartbeats.

1:46:19.520 --> 1:46:21.840
 So some people are very good at this.

1:46:21.840 --> 1:46:23.300
 Other people are not.

1:46:23.300 --> 1:46:24.880
 Some people can do this more easily

1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:26.720
 when they have all their air exhaled

1:46:26.720 --> 1:46:27.860
 and some people can do it better

1:46:27.860 --> 1:46:30.600
 when they are holding a breath hold.

1:46:30.600 --> 1:46:32.960
 But one thing that's kind of cool

1:46:32.960 --> 1:46:36.000
 about this whole interoceptive capacity

1:46:36.000 --> 1:46:38.440
 is that you can enhance it very, very quickly.

1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:40.440
 You can learn or teach yourself

1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:42.680
 to have heightened levels of interoception

1:46:43.680 --> 1:46:45.720
 in a way that you can't really just give yourself

1:46:45.720 --> 1:46:47.920
 heightened levels of vision by snapping your fingers

1:46:47.920 --> 1:46:50.200
 in one round of one tool or exercise.

1:46:50.200 --> 1:46:51.800
 There are things you can do to improve vision.

1:46:51.800 --> 1:46:53.360
 That's the topic of a previous episode.

1:46:53.360 --> 1:46:54.400
 I encourage you to look it up.

1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:56.680
 There are things you can do to improve your hearing

1:46:56.680 --> 1:46:58.160
 and your taste and your smell.

1:46:58.160 --> 1:46:59.780
 We talked about all those.

1:46:59.780 --> 1:47:01.120
 But within interoception,

1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:03.480
 you can get very good at this very fast.

1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:04.600
 And I think this is one of the reasons

1:47:04.600 --> 1:47:06.360
 why meditation is powerful.

1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:07.280
 I think there are a lot of reasons

1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:08.320
 why meditation is powerful.

1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:10.200
 But one of the reasons is when you stop

1:47:10.200 --> 1:47:12.660
 taking in exteroceptive information,

1:47:12.660 --> 1:47:14.680
 information from the outside world,

1:47:14.680 --> 1:47:17.680
 by closing your eyes and focusing inward, as they say,

1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:20.880
 you start paying attention to your breathing cadence.

1:47:20.880 --> 1:47:23.380
 You start directing your mind's attention

1:47:23.380 --> 1:47:24.980
 to your heart rate.

1:47:24.980 --> 1:47:28.240
 And if you can start to perceive your heart beating,

1:47:28.240 --> 1:47:31.800
 you actually are very quickly strengthen

1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:35.120
 the vagal connections between the body and the brain.

1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:36.900
 And so there's no real practice here.

1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:39.600
 There's no breathe this way or do this thing,

1:47:39.600 --> 1:47:44.600
 except to direct your awareness toward your heartbeat.

1:47:45.400 --> 1:47:48.520
 And some people can get very good at this very fast.

1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:51.080
 Most people find that just by doing this for a minute or so,

1:47:51.080 --> 1:47:52.840
 every once in a while,

1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:55.540
 they start to tap into this sixth sense.

1:47:55.540 --> 1:47:59.600
 They start to notice when they don't feel quite right

1:47:59.600 --> 1:48:02.480
 about something or somebody or some situation,

1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:05.680
 or they start to notice when they feel quite right

1:48:05.680 --> 1:48:08.200
 about somebody or something or some situation.

1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:10.920
 So this interoceptive awareness can be tuned up.

1:48:10.920 --> 1:48:13.120
 It used to be called vagal tone,

1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:15.200
 but I think that term doesn't take into account

1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:17.360
 all the other things that are going on with the vagus.

1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:18.760
 So I don't really like that term.

1:48:18.760 --> 1:48:21.840
 It's more of an interoceptive awareness.

1:48:21.840 --> 1:48:25.020
 And again, there are many studies now showing

1:48:25.020 --> 1:48:29.160
 that for sake of bettering one's mood overall,

1:48:29.160 --> 1:48:31.680
 for sake of moving through a challenging phase in life,

1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:35.400
 for sake of just enhancing one's experience of life overall,

1:48:35.400 --> 1:48:36.720
 whether or not it's the taste of foods,

1:48:36.720 --> 1:48:41.640
 interactions with other people, enjoyment, focus, pleasure,

1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:45.240
 tuning up one's interoceptive awareness is both easy,

1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:46.960
 again, by just taking a minute or two

1:48:46.960 --> 1:48:49.200
 and trying to count heartbeats.

1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:50.860
 And then this works best, of course,

1:48:50.860 --> 1:48:52.900
 if you have some independent readout of heartbeats

1:48:52.900 --> 1:48:55.960
 and you can compare, you can see how accurate you are.

1:48:55.960 --> 1:48:57.760
 But even if you don't use a device

1:48:57.760 --> 1:48:59.600
 or have a device to do that,

1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:01.200
 without taking your pulse,

1:49:01.200 --> 1:49:02.760
 using your thumb on your wrist or something

1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:04.140
 or your fingers on your neck,

1:49:04.140 --> 1:49:06.160
 as you typically would for taking your pulse,

1:49:06.160 --> 1:49:09.280
 trying to sit still for a minute or two,

1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:11.280
 every once in a while, maybe once a week,

1:49:11.280 --> 1:49:13.700
 maybe twice a week, maybe while you're meditating,

1:49:13.700 --> 1:49:14.680
 maybe while breath work,

1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:16.100
 maybe during the breath holds or breath work.

1:49:16.100 --> 1:49:17.380
 You don't really have to do this

1:49:17.380 --> 1:49:19.040
 in any kind of extended way.

1:49:19.040 --> 1:49:22.000
 You can very quickly increase your interoceptive tone

1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:25.160
 and that has a huge and outsized effect

1:49:25.160 --> 1:49:28.200
 on the brain-body relationship

1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:32.080
 and your brain's ability to tap into

1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:35.240
 both the subconscious and the conscious aspects

1:49:35.240 --> 1:49:37.160
 of this chemical and mechanical signaling

1:49:37.160 --> 1:49:38.440
 that's happening all the time.

1:49:38.440 --> 1:49:41.240
 And it can have real and outsized positive effects

1:49:41.240 --> 1:49:43.480
 on your ability to engage with other people

1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:45.880
 and your ability to focus at work

1:49:45.880 --> 1:49:47.400
 and your ability to notice,

1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:51.040
 ah, I'm finding myself kind of feeling

1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:52.340
 like I'm losing focus,

1:49:52.340 --> 1:49:54.260
 but really it was my heart rate was just increasing.

1:49:54.260 --> 1:49:55.680
 Maybe I just exhale a little bit

1:49:55.680 --> 1:49:58.020
 and bring my heart rate down.

1:49:58.020 --> 1:50:00.080
 So what I've effectively tried to do today

1:50:00.080 --> 1:50:03.880
 is to give you a window into this incredible relationship

1:50:03.880 --> 1:50:05.840
 between your viscera and your brain

1:50:05.840 --> 1:50:07.000
 and your brain and your viscera,

1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:08.160
 all these organs of your body.

1:50:08.160 --> 1:50:11.360
 And what I hope is that you'll appreciate

1:50:11.360 --> 1:50:14.700
 that it's a system, that you aren't just a system of tubes.

1:50:14.700 --> 1:50:16.160
 I said that in sort of in jest.

1:50:16.160 --> 1:50:17.080
 I mean, you have a lot of tubes

1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:18.360
 and you are a system of tubes,

1:50:18.360 --> 1:50:20.500
 but that system of tubes is linked

1:50:20.500 --> 1:50:22.160
 through the nervous system.

1:50:22.160 --> 1:50:25.000
 And those links work in very specific ways.

1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.060
 So whether or not you remember about piezos

1:50:27.060 --> 1:50:28.960
 and all the GLP-1Rs and all that stuff,

1:50:28.960 --> 1:50:30.240
 it doesn't really matter.

1:50:30.240 --> 1:50:33.400
 What I encourage you to do is start sort of pushing

1:50:33.400 --> 1:50:34.940
 and pulling on the various levers

1:50:34.940 --> 1:50:36.260
 within this beautiful system

1:50:36.260 --> 1:50:40.340
 that we call the interoceptive system, this sense of self.

1:50:40.340 --> 1:50:41.680

 During the course of today's episode

1:51:15.480 --> 1:51:18.000
 and on previous episodes, I mentioned supplements.

1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:19.800
 I realize supplements aren't for everybody,

1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:22.080
 but for those of you that are interested in supplements,

1:51:22.080 --> 1:51:24.360
 it is important that the supplements that you take

1:51:24.360 --> 1:51:26.380
 have a high level of stringency

1:51:26.380 --> 1:51:28.680
 with respect to the amounts of the contents

1:51:28.680 --> 1:51:29.660
 that are listed on the bottle

1:51:29.660 --> 1:51:31.440
 matching what's actually in the bottle,

1:51:31.440 --> 1:51:33.000
 in the capsules and tablets,

1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:35.800
 and that the quality of those ingredients be extremely high.

1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:37.920
 For that reason, we partnered with Thorne,

1:51:37.920 --> 1:51:39.680
 that's T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:51:39.680 --> 1:51:41.720
 because Thorne supplements have the highest levels

1:51:41.720 --> 1:51:43.840
 of stringency for both the content

1:51:43.840 --> 1:51:47.200
 and the amount of content in those bottles and supplements.

1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:49.620
 If you want to try Thorne supplements

1:51:49.620 --> 1:51:51.120
 and you want to see the supplements that I take,

1:51:51.120 --> 1:51:55.560

1:51:55.560 --> 1:51:57.260
 and you can see all the supplements that I take.

1:51:57.260 --> 1:51:59.680
 You can get 20% off any of those.

1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:02.240
 And if you enter the Thorne site through that portal,

1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:04.360
 you can get 20% off any of the supplements

1:52:04.360 --> 1:52:05.600
 that Thorne makes.

1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:07.520
 In addition, we have a Patreon account.

1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:10.480
