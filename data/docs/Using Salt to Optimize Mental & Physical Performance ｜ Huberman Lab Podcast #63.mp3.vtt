00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.300 --> 00:10.300
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.300 --> 00:12.940
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.940 --> 00:14.860
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.860 --> 00:17.340
 Today, we are going to discuss salt,

00:17.340 --> 00:19.620
 also referred to as sodium.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.600
 Now, most of us think of salt

00:21.600 --> 00:24.340
 as something that we put on and in our food,

00:24.340 --> 00:25.760
 maybe something to avoid,

00:25.760 --> 00:27.780
 maybe some of you are actually trying to get more salt,

00:27.780 --> 00:29.860
 some of you are trying to get less salt.

00:29.860 --> 00:31.420
 We all seem to associate salt

00:31.420 --> 00:33.420
 with things like blood pressure, et cetera.

00:33.420 --> 00:34.860
 Today, we're going to go down

00:34.860 --> 00:37.040
 a different set of avenues related to salt.

00:37.040 --> 00:40.320
 We will certainly cover how salt regulates blood pressure.

00:40.320 --> 00:41.820
 We are also going to talk about

00:41.820 --> 00:44.940
 how the brain regulates our appetite for salt

00:44.940 --> 00:47.220
 or our aversion for salt.

00:47.220 --> 00:48.540
 We are also going to talk about

00:48.540 --> 00:51.440
 how our sensing of salty tastes

00:51.440 --> 00:54.580
 actually mediates how much sugar we crave

00:54.580 --> 00:57.360
 and whether or not we ingest more or less sugar

00:57.360 --> 00:59.020
 than we actually need.

00:59.020 --> 01:00.420
 So what you're going to learn today

01:00.420 --> 01:02.460
 is that the so-called salt system,

01:02.460 --> 01:05.420
 meaning the cells and connections in our brain and body

01:05.420 --> 01:07.860
 that mediate salt craving and avoidance

01:07.860 --> 01:11.500
 are regulating many, many aspects of our health

01:11.500 --> 01:13.940
 and our ability to perform in various contexts,

01:13.940 --> 01:15.280
 things like athletic performance,

01:15.280 --> 01:17.500
 things like cognitive performance.

01:17.500 --> 01:19.780
 We're also going to talk about aging and dementia

01:19.780 --> 01:21.380
 and avoiding aging and dementia

01:21.380 --> 01:25.480
 and what role salt and salt avoidance might play in that.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.820
 We're going to touch on some themes

01:26.820 --> 01:28.820
 that for some of you might seem controversial

01:28.820 --> 01:30.540
 and indeed, if they are controversial,

01:30.540 --> 01:32.460
 I'll be sure to highlight them as such.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.240
 I'm going to cover a lot of new data

01:34.240 --> 01:35.940
 that point to the possibility,

01:35.940 --> 01:38.960
 I want to emphasize the possibility that for some people,

01:38.960 --> 01:42.020
 more salt might help them in terms of health,

01:42.020 --> 01:44.060
 cognitive and bodily functioning.

01:44.060 --> 01:47.400
 And for other people, less salt is going to be better.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.500
 I'm going to talk about what the various parameters are.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.740
 I'm going to give you some guidelines

01:50.740 --> 01:53.180
 that in concert with your physician

01:53.180 --> 01:54.400
 who you should absolutely talk to

01:54.400 --> 01:56.020
 before adding or changing anything

01:56.020 --> 01:57.900
 to your diet or supplementation regime

01:57.900 --> 01:59.900
 can help you arrive at a salt intake

01:59.900 --> 02:01.260
 that's going to optimize your mental,

02:01.260 --> 02:03.260
 physical health and performance.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.500
 So we're going to cover neurobiology,

02:04.500 --> 02:06.340
 we're going to cover hormone biology,

02:06.340 --> 02:07.620
 we're going to talk about liver function,

02:07.620 --> 02:09.560
 we're going to talk about kidney function

02:09.560 --> 02:11.400
 and of course, brain function.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.560
 I'm excited to share this information with you today.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.500
 I'm certain you're going to come away

02:14.500 --> 02:18.060
 with a lot of information and actionable items.

02:18.060 --> 02:18.980
 I'm pleased to announce

02:18.980 --> 02:21.340
 that I'm hosting two live events this May.

02:21.340 --> 02:22.820
 The first live event will take place

02:22.820 --> 02:25.420
 in Seattle, Washington on May 17th.

02:25.420 --> 02:27.900
 The second live event will take place in Portland, Oregon

02:27.900 --> 02:29.860
 on May 18th.

02:29.860 --> 02:31.380
 Presale tickets for these two events

02:31.380 --> 02:35.200
 are now available at hubermanlab.com slash tour.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.460
 I should mention that while I do hope to visit other cities

02:38.460 --> 02:40.440
 in the near future to do more live events,

02:40.440 --> 02:42.500
 right now, these are the only two live events

02:42.500 --> 02:44.960
 I have scheduled, at least for the next six months.

02:44.960 --> 02:47.560
 So once again, if you go to hubermanlab.com slash tour,

02:47.560 --> 02:49.460
 you can access the presale tickets.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.340
 I hope to see you at these live events

02:51.340 --> 02:54.320
 and as always, thank you for your interest in science.

02:54.320 --> 02:57.120
 Before we dive into the topic of today's episode,

02:57.120 --> 02:59.780
 I want to highlight a really exciting new study.

02:59.780 --> 03:04.140
 This is a study from Diego Bohor's lab at Duke University.

03:04.140 --> 03:06.500
 The Bohor's lab studies interactions

03:06.500 --> 03:08.820
 between the gut and the brain

03:08.820 --> 03:11.180
 and has made some incredible discoveries

03:11.180 --> 03:13.340
 of the so-called neuropod cells.

03:13.340 --> 03:15.860
 Neuropod cells are neurons, nerve cells

03:15.860 --> 03:19.060
 that reside in our gut and that detect things

03:19.060 --> 03:21.140
 like fatty acids, amino acids,

03:21.140 --> 03:24.360
 and some neuropod cells sense sugar.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.860
 Previous work from this laboratory has shown

03:26.860 --> 03:29.220
 that when we ingest sugar,

03:29.220 --> 03:32.860
 these neuropod cells respond to that sugar

03:32.860 --> 03:35.280
 and send electrical signals up a little wire

03:35.280 --> 03:37.740
 that we call an axon through the vagus nerve,

03:37.740 --> 03:40.940
 for those of you that want to know, and into the brain

03:40.940 --> 03:44.020
 and through subsequent stations of neural processing,

03:44.020 --> 03:46.380
 evoke the release of dopamine.

03:46.380 --> 03:49.900
 Dopamine is a molecule known to promote craving

03:49.900 --> 03:52.500
 and motivation and indeed action.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.620
 And what these neuropod cells that send sugar

03:54.620 --> 03:57.060
 are thought to do is to promote seeking

03:57.060 --> 04:00.940
 and consumption eating of more sugary foods.

04:00.940 --> 04:03.580
 Now, the incredible thing is that it's all subconscious.

04:03.580 --> 04:06.060
 This is a taste system in the gut

04:06.060 --> 04:09.560
 that is not available to your conscious awareness.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.340
 Now, of course, when you ingest sweet foods,

04:11.340 --> 04:12.900
 you taste them on your mouth too.

04:12.900 --> 04:16.060
 And so part of the reason that you crave sweet foods perhaps

04:16.060 --> 04:17.820
 is because they taste good to you.

04:17.820 --> 04:20.800
 And the other reason is that these neuropod cells

04:20.800 --> 04:23.260
 are driving a chemical craving

04:23.260 --> 04:24.740
 below your conscious detection.

04:24.740 --> 04:26.360
 So they're really two systems.

04:26.360 --> 04:31.360
 Your gut is sensing at a subconscious level, what's in it

04:31.380 --> 04:34.020
 and sending signals to your brain that work in concert

04:34.020 --> 04:36.380
 in parallel with the signals coming from your mouth

04:36.380 --> 04:38.640
 and your experience of the taste of the food.

04:38.640 --> 04:40.580
 Now, that alone is incredible

04:40.580 --> 04:43.180
 and has been the subject of many important landmark papers

04:43.180 --> 04:44.580
 over the last decade or so.

04:44.580 --> 04:47.940
 You can imagine how the system would be very important

04:47.940 --> 04:49.260
 for things like hidden sugars,

04:49.260 --> 04:51.580
 when nowadays in a lot of processed foods,

04:51.580 --> 04:53.660
 they're putting hidden sugars,

04:53.660 --> 04:57.060
 they're putting a lot of things that cause your gut

04:57.060 --> 04:58.820
 to send signals to your brain

04:58.820 --> 05:01.160
 that make you crave more of those foods.

05:01.160 --> 05:02.780
 So for those of you that really love sugar,

05:02.780 --> 05:06.440
 just understand it's not just about how that sugar tastes.

05:06.440 --> 05:07.980
 The new study from the Borjas lab

05:07.980 --> 05:09.940
 deserves attention, I believe.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.900
 This is a paper published just recently,

05:11.900 --> 05:15.700
 February 25th, this year, 2022 in Nature Neuroscience,

05:15.700 --> 05:16.780
 an excellent journal.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.940
 And the title of the paper is the preference

05:18.940 --> 05:22.520
 for sugar over sweetener depends on a gut sensor cell.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.980
 The Borjas lab has now discovered a neuropod cell,

05:25.980 --> 05:27.740
 meaning a category of neurons,

05:27.740 --> 05:32.300
 that can distinguish between sweet things in the gut

05:32.300 --> 05:36.340
 that contain calories, for instance, sugar,

05:36.340 --> 05:40.140
 and things in the gut that are sweet

05:40.140 --> 05:42.820
 but do not contain calories, artificial sweeteners

05:42.820 --> 05:45.780
 like aspartame, sucralose, and so forth.

05:45.780 --> 05:46.700
 There are also, of course,

05:46.700 --> 05:48.900
 non-artificial non-caloric sweeteners

05:48.900 --> 05:51.340
 like stevia, monk fruit, et cetera.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.260
 They did not explore the full gallery

05:53.260 --> 05:54.640
 of artificial sweeteners.

05:54.640 --> 05:56.460
 What they did find, however,

05:56.460 --> 05:58.440
 ought to pertain to all forms

05:58.440 --> 06:01.400
 of sweet non-caloric substances.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.860
 What they discovered was that there is a signature pattern

06:03.860 --> 06:06.680
 of signals sent from the gut to the brain

06:06.680 --> 06:11.020
 when we ingest artificial or non-caloric sweeteners.

06:11.020 --> 06:13.020
 This is important because what it says is that

06:13.020 --> 06:14.260
 at a subconscious level,

06:14.260 --> 06:16.300
 the gut can distinguish between sweet things

06:16.300 --> 06:18.580
 that contain calories and sweet things that do not.

06:18.580 --> 06:23.380
 Now, what the downstream consequences of this sensing is

06:23.380 --> 06:26.380
 or what they are, isn't yet clear.

06:26.380 --> 06:27.860
 Now, I believe everyone should be aware

06:27.860 --> 06:30.640
 of these kinds of studies for a couple of reasons.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.060
 First of all, it's important to understand

06:33.060 --> 06:35.460
 that what you crave, meaning the foods you crave

06:35.460 --> 06:36.780
 and the drinks you crave,

06:36.780 --> 06:39.300
 is in part due to your conscious experience

06:39.300 --> 06:40.820
 of the taste of those things,

06:40.820 --> 06:44.220
 but also due to biochemical and neural events

06:44.220 --> 06:47.560
 that start in the body and impinge on your brain

06:47.560 --> 06:50.660
 and cause you to seek out certain things,

06:50.660 --> 06:52.000
 even though you might not know

06:52.000 --> 06:53.540
 why you're seeking out more sugar.

06:53.540 --> 06:55.500
 You find that you're craving a lot of sugar

06:55.500 --> 06:58.080
 or you're craving a lot of foods with artificial sweeteners

06:58.080 --> 06:59.880
 and you don't necessarily know why.

06:59.880 --> 07:01.520
 Now, artificial sweeteners themselves

07:01.520 --> 07:03.340
 are a somewhat controversial topic.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.060
 I want to highlight that.

07:05.060 --> 07:08.780
 Some months back, I described a study from Yale University

07:08.780 --> 07:11.740
 about how one can condition the insulin system.

07:11.740 --> 07:13.940
 Insulin is involved in mobilizing a blood sugar

07:13.940 --> 07:15.860
 and so forth in the body, as many of you know,

07:15.860 --> 07:18.640
 and I described some studies that were done

07:18.640 --> 07:20.420
 from Yale University School of Medicine,

07:20.420 --> 07:22.260
 looking at how artificial sweeteners

07:22.260 --> 07:26.140
 can actually evoke an insulin response

07:27.100 --> 07:29.020
 under certain conditions.

07:29.020 --> 07:30.760
 Now, a couple of key things.

07:30.760 --> 07:34.380
 I got a little bit of pushback after covering those studies

07:34.380 --> 07:37.360
 and I encourage pushback all the time.

07:37.360 --> 07:38.500
 Pushback is one of those things

07:38.500 --> 07:41.280
 that forces all of us to drill deeper into a topic.

07:41.280 --> 07:42.120
 I want to be clear.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.700
 First of all, I am not one to demonize artificial sweeteners.

07:45.700 --> 07:49.340
 There is evidence in animal models, in animal models,

07:49.340 --> 07:53.260
 that artificial sweeteners can disrupt the gut microbiome,

07:53.260 --> 07:55.700
 but those were fairly high doses of artificial sweeteners

07:55.700 --> 07:57.940
 and it's unclear if the same thing pertains to humans.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.340
 Still unclear, I should say,

07:59.340 --> 08:01.420
 has not been investigated thoroughly.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.580
 Some people don't like the taste of artificial sweeteners.

08:03.580 --> 08:04.460
 Some people do.

08:04.460 --> 08:06.420
 Some people find that they really help them

08:06.420 --> 08:08.460
 avoid excessive caloric intake.

08:08.460 --> 08:11.200
 Some people believe, and yet I should emphasize,

08:11.200 --> 08:12.500
 there still isn't evidence

08:12.500 --> 08:15.300
 that they can adjust the insulin response in all people.

08:15.300 --> 08:16.620
 I just want to repeat that three times

08:16.620 --> 08:18.740
 so that people are clear on that fact.

08:20.020 --> 08:21.900
 What these new data emphasize, however,

08:21.900 --> 08:25.580
 is that we need to understand how artificial sweeteners

08:25.580 --> 08:27.100
 are consumed at the level of the gut,

08:27.100 --> 08:29.140
 or I should say registered at the level of the gut

08:29.140 --> 08:31.860
 and how that changes brain function.

08:31.860 --> 08:33.340
 Because one thing that I'm familiar with

08:33.340 --> 08:34.460
 and that many people report

08:34.460 --> 08:37.220
 is that when they first taste artificial sweeteners,

08:37.220 --> 08:39.260
 they taste sort of not right to them.

08:39.260 --> 08:40.140
 They don't like the taste,

08:40.140 --> 08:42.860
 but over time, they actually start to crave that taste.

08:42.860 --> 08:43.700
 I've experienced this.

08:43.700 --> 08:44.980
 I used to drink a lot of diet sodas

08:44.980 --> 08:47.940
 when I was in graduate school, so this would be aspartame,

08:47.940 --> 08:50.700
 and I found that I actually needed them.

08:50.700 --> 08:51.780
 Now, maybe it was the caffeine.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.760
 Maybe I just liked the sweet taste or the carbonation.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.200
 We actually have a drive for carbonation,

08:56.200 --> 08:58.260
 which is the topic of a future episode,

08:58.260 --> 09:01.060
 but when I finally quit them

09:01.060 --> 09:03.400
 for reasons that were independent of any fear

09:03.400 --> 09:04.660
 of artificial sweeteners,

09:05.500 --> 09:07.300
 I found that I didn't like the taste.

09:07.300 --> 09:10.420
 Nowadays, I only occasionally drink a diet soda.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.620
 I usually do that if I'm on a plane

09:11.620 --> 09:12.900
 and there's nothing else available to me,

09:12.900 --> 09:14.260
 so I don't demonize them.

09:14.260 --> 09:17.180
 I might drink one every once in a while, no big deal.

09:17.180 --> 09:18.140
 I also want to be clear.

09:18.140 --> 09:21.100
 I consume stevia on a number of different supplements

09:21.100 --> 09:22.460
 and foods that I consume.

09:22.460 --> 09:25.300
 Stevia, of course, is a plant-based non-caloric sweetener,

09:25.300 --> 09:27.540
 so I myself consume artificial sweeteners.

09:27.540 --> 09:28.860
 Many people hate them.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.440
 Many people like them and find them useful

09:31.440 --> 09:33.020
 for their nutrition and, in fact,

09:33.020 --> 09:34.460
 to keep their caloric intake

09:34.460 --> 09:36.260
 in a range that's right for them,

09:36.260 --> 09:39.940
 and many people, like myself, are curious about them

09:39.940 --> 09:41.860
 and somewhat wary of them

09:41.860 --> 09:44.180
 and yet continue to consume them in small amounts.

09:44.180 --> 09:46.380
 I think most people probably fall into that category.

09:46.380 --> 09:48.860
 I should also mention that many food manufacturers

09:49.740 --> 09:52.820
 put artificial sweeteners, such as sucralose, et cetera,

09:52.820 --> 09:56.220
 into foods, and it's always been unclear

09:56.220 --> 09:58.180
 as to why they might want to do that,

09:58.180 --> 10:02.220
 and yet we know that the sweet taste consumption,

10:02.220 --> 10:03.620
 even if it doesn't contain calories,

10:03.620 --> 10:06.700
 can drive more craving of sweet food,

10:06.700 --> 10:09.620
 so there may be a logic or a strategy to why they do that.

10:09.620 --> 10:12.300
 Again, a topic for exploration on today's podcast

10:12.300 --> 10:13.220
 and in future podcasts,

10:13.220 --> 10:16.260
 because where we're headed today is a discussion

10:16.260 --> 10:18.820
 about how salt and salt sensing,

10:18.820 --> 10:20.740
 both consciously and unconsciously,

10:20.740 --> 10:22.860
 can adjust our craving for other things

10:22.860 --> 10:25.300
 like sugar and water and so on.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.980
 So I want to highlight this beautiful work

10:26.980 --> 10:27.820
 from the Moraes lab.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.340
 I will put a link to the study.

10:29.340 --> 10:32.500
 I want to open this as a chapter for further exploration.

10:32.500 --> 10:35.060
 I like to think that the listeners of this podcast

10:35.060 --> 10:36.960
 are looking for answers where we have answers,

10:36.960 --> 10:38.680
 but are also, I would hope,

10:38.680 --> 10:41.200
 excited about some of the new and emerging themes

10:41.200 --> 10:43.540
 in what we call nutritional neurobiology,

10:43.540 --> 10:45.920
 and indeed the Moraes lab really stands

10:45.920 --> 10:48.400
 as one of the premier laboratories out there

10:48.400 --> 10:52.020
 that's looking at how foods, as consumed in the gut,

10:52.020 --> 10:53.780
 are modifying our nervous system,

10:53.780 --> 10:56.820
 the foods we crave, and how we utilize those foods.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.580
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

10:58.580 --> 10:59.820
 that this podcast is separate

10:59.820 --> 11:02.020
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

11:02.020 --> 11:04.340
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

11:04.340 --> 11:06.880
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

11:06.880 --> 11:09.700
 and science-related tools to the general public.

11:09.700 --> 11:10.720
 In keeping with that theme,

11:10.720 --> 11:13.340
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

11:13.340 --> 11:17.020
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.340
 I've been taking AG1 since 2012,

11:19.340 --> 11:21.640
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.100
 The reason I started taking AG1

11:23.100 --> 11:25.900
 and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day

11:25.900 --> 11:28.160
 is that I find it to be the best way

11:28.160 --> 11:30.560
 to ensure I get all of my vitamins and minerals

11:30.560 --> 11:32.520
 and the probiotics I need.

11:32.520 --> 11:35.560
 I try and eat really well, but I'm not perfect about it,

11:35.560 --> 11:38.300
 and with Athletic Greens, AG1,

11:38.300 --> 11:40.720
 I cover any deficiencies I might have.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.120
 The probiotics are particularly important to me

11:43.120 --> 11:45.880
 because as we've talked about on many previous episodes

11:45.880 --> 11:47.780
 and we'll talk about more on today's episode,

11:47.780 --> 11:50.260
 the gut microbiome is supported by probiotics

11:50.260 --> 11:53.420
 and the gut microbiome supports many biological functions

11:53.420 --> 11:55.300
 important for immediate and long-term health,

11:55.300 --> 11:56.860
 things like immune system function,

11:56.860 --> 11:59.660
 things like the gut brain axis and mood and appetite

11:59.660 --> 12:00.500
 and so forth.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.740
 With Athletic Greens, I make sure all of those bases

12:02.740 --> 12:04.460
 are covered because of the probiotics.

12:04.460 --> 12:05.840
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

12:05.840 --> 12:08.420
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

12:08.420 --> 12:09.540
 to claim a special offer.

12:09.540 --> 12:11.020
 They'll give you five free travel packs,

12:11.020 --> 12:13.400
 which make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

12:13.400 --> 12:14.580
 while you're on the road,

12:14.580 --> 12:17.440
 and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

12:17.440 --> 12:20.920
 Vitamin D3 is crucial for many aspects

12:20.920 --> 12:22.740
 of our immediate and long-term health,

12:22.740 --> 12:25.760
 and many people simply are not getting enough vitamin D3,

12:25.760 --> 12:28.100
 or the amounts they're getting are not optimal.

12:28.100 --> 12:30.420
 K2 is important for cardiovascular health

12:30.420 --> 12:31.660
 and for calcium regulation.

12:31.660 --> 12:34.520
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

12:34.520 --> 12:36.820
 you can claim the special offer, the five free travel packs

12:36.820 --> 12:39.540
 and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

12:39.540 --> 12:42.200
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.

12:42.200 --> 12:45.320
 Element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need

12:45.320 --> 12:47.760
 and none of the things you don't.

12:47.760 --> 12:50.820
 That means it has salt, magnesium and potassium,

12:50.820 --> 12:52.940
 so-called electrolytes, which are critical for neuronal

12:52.940 --> 12:57.080
 function and a lot of other biological functions.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.200
 As I mentioned on the podcast before, I'm a fan of salt.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.420
 I believe in ingesting appropriate amounts of salt,

13:02.420 --> 13:03.580
 and by appropriate, I mean,

13:03.580 --> 13:05.720
 depending on what your background blood pressure

13:05.720 --> 13:07.580
 happens to be, what your activity levels are,

13:07.580 --> 13:08.820
 how much you sweat,

13:08.820 --> 13:10.640
 what your cognitive and physical demands are.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.100
 Today, we're going to talk about how to determine

13:13.100 --> 13:14.660
 what those needs are.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.380
 I'm always trying to stay on top of my hydration,

13:17.380 --> 13:19.440
 and as you'll also learn about today,

13:19.440 --> 13:23.580
 salt and water intake and hydration are intimately related.

13:23.580 --> 13:27.620
 With Element, I'm sure to get the potassium, the sodium

13:27.620 --> 13:29.100
 and the magnesium that I need,

13:29.100 --> 13:31.060
 and I do that in a great tasting drink,

13:31.060 --> 13:33.400
 and as I mentioned before, it has no sugar.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.500
 If you'd like to try Element, you can go to drinkelement.com,

13:36.500 --> 13:39.860
 that's drinklmnt.com slash Huberman

13:39.860 --> 13:41.660
 to claim a free Element sample pack.

13:41.660 --> 13:43.140
 You only cover the cost of shipping,

13:43.140 --> 13:44.540
 otherwise it's completely free.

13:44.540 --> 13:48.460
 Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com slash Huberman

13:48.460 --> 13:50.860
 to claim a free sample pack of Element.

13:50.860 --> 13:53.700
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

13:53.700 --> 13:56.260
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

13:56.260 --> 13:58.900
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

13:58.900 --> 14:00.460
 to help you better understand your body

14:00.460 --> 14:02.480
 and help you reach your health goals.

14:02.480 --> 14:04.940
 I am a big fan of getting regular blood work done,

14:04.940 --> 14:06.140
 and I've been trying to do it

14:06.140 --> 14:08.460
 as much as I can afford for years.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.500
 The reason is that many of the factors

14:10.500 --> 14:12.580
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

14:12.580 --> 14:16.180
 can only be discovered from a quality blood test.

14:16.180 --> 14:19.080
 With most blood tests and DNA tests, however,

14:19.080 --> 14:21.520
 you get information back, but not a lot of information

14:21.520 --> 14:23.300
 about what to do with those numbers.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.880
 So if something's in high or low range,

14:24.880 --> 14:26.940
 you might get one or two generic recommendations,

14:26.940 --> 14:28.720
 things that you could easily look up online,

14:28.720 --> 14:31.740
 but you're not going to get a lot of specific recommendations.

14:31.740 --> 14:32.620
 With Inside Tracker,

14:32.620 --> 14:34.680
 they give you a lot of specific recommendations

14:34.680 --> 14:36.820
 as to lifestyle factors and nutrition factors,

14:36.820 --> 14:38.380
 supplementation factors,

14:38.380 --> 14:41.000
 things you may want to add to your life

14:41.000 --> 14:42.900
 or things you may want to delete from your life

14:42.900 --> 14:44.880
 in order to bring the numbers into the ranges

14:44.880 --> 14:47.420
 that are best for your immediate and long-term health.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.900
 There's simply no replacement for these kinds of data,

14:49.900 --> 14:52.980
 and your data are the most important data to you,

14:52.980 --> 14:54.980
 and quality blood tests and DNA tests

14:54.980 --> 14:56.220
 are the way to access them.

14:56.220 --> 14:57.640
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

14:57.640 --> 15:00.200

 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.320
 Okay, let's talk about salt.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.160
 Salt has many, many important functions

15:10.160 --> 15:11.600
 in the brain and body.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.200
 For instance, it regulates fluid balance,

15:14.200 --> 15:18.680
 how much fluid you desire and how much fluid you excrete.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.160
 It also regulates your desire for salt itself,

15:22.160 --> 15:24.040
 meaning your salt appetite.

15:24.040 --> 15:28.020
 You have a homeostatically driven salt appetite.

15:28.020 --> 15:29.360
 I'll talk about the mechanisms today

15:29.360 --> 15:31.280
 and make them all very clear.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.360
 What that means is that you crave salty things,

15:34.360 --> 15:37.460
 beverages and foods, when your salt stores are low,

15:37.460 --> 15:40.760
 and you tend to avoid salty beverages and foods

15:40.760 --> 15:42.320
 when your salt stores are high,

15:42.320 --> 15:43.880
 although that's not always the case.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.000
 There are circumstances where you will continue

15:46.000 --> 15:48.560
 to crave salt even though you don't need salt

15:48.560 --> 15:51.880
 or indeed even if you need to eliminate salt

15:51.880 --> 15:52.740
 from your system.

15:53.820 --> 15:56.720
 Salt also regulates your appetite for other nutrients,

15:56.720 --> 15:59.360
 things like sugar, things like carbohydrates.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.500
 And today we'll explore all of that.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.000
 Technically, salt is a mineral.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.480
 And I should mention that when I say salt,

16:06.480 --> 16:09.120
 I am indeed referring to sodium in most cases,

16:09.120 --> 16:11.860
 although I will be clear to distinguish salt from sodium,

16:11.860 --> 16:14.040
 meaning table salt from sodium.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.020
 Most people don't realize this,

16:16.020 --> 16:18.600
 but one gram of table salt

16:18.600 --> 16:22.900
 contains about 388 milligrams of sodium.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.680
 So technically we should be talking about sodium today

16:25.680 --> 16:26.520
 and not salt.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.960
 I will use them interchangeably

16:27.960 --> 16:31.880
 unless I'm referring to some specific recommendations

16:31.880 --> 16:36.320
 or ideas about trying to define your ideal salt,

16:36.320 --> 16:38.280
 AKA sodium intake.

16:38.280 --> 16:39.240
 So this is important.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.960
 I think right off the bat,

16:40.960 --> 16:43.740
 a lot of people get themselves into a place of confusion

16:43.740 --> 16:46.080
 and potentially even to a place of trouble

16:46.080 --> 16:49.200
 by thinking that table salt in grams

16:49.200 --> 16:51.840
 always equates to sodium in grams.

16:51.840 --> 16:53.920
 And that's simply not the case.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.920
 Today we're going to explore the neural mechanisms

16:56.920 --> 17:00.600
 by which we regulate our salt appetite

17:00.600 --> 17:02.780
 and the way that the brain and body interact

17:02.780 --> 17:06.200
 in the context of salt seeking, salt avoidance,

17:06.200 --> 17:08.040
 how to determine when we need more salt,

17:08.040 --> 17:09.440
 when we need less salt.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.280
 We'll talk about kidney function.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.320
 We'll get into all of it

17:12.320 --> 17:14.080
 and we're going to do it very systematically.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.240
 So let's start in the brain.

17:16.240 --> 17:19.800
 We all harbor small sets of neurons.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.780
 We call these sets of neurons nuclei,

17:21.780 --> 17:24.320
 meaning little clusters of neurons

17:24.320 --> 17:27.760
 that sense the levels of salt in our brain and body.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.000
 There are a couple of brain regions that do this

17:31.000 --> 17:33.200
 and these brain regions are very, very special.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.760
 Special because they lack biological fences around them

17:37.760 --> 17:39.360
 that other brain areas have.

17:39.360 --> 17:42.340
 And those fences, or I should say that fence

17:42.340 --> 17:43.440
 goes by a particular name.

17:43.440 --> 17:47.680
 And that name is the blood brain barrier or BBB.

17:47.680 --> 17:50.560
 Most substances that are circulating around in your body

17:50.560 --> 17:52.560
 do not have access to the brain.

17:52.560 --> 17:54.440
 In particular, large molecules

17:54.440 --> 17:56.520
 can't just pass into the brain.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.960
 The brain is a privileged organ in this sense.

17:58.960 --> 18:00.840
 There are a couple of other organs that are privileged

18:00.840 --> 18:03.160
 and that have very strict barriers,

18:03.160 --> 18:05.800
 very particular fences, if you will.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.180
 And those other organs include things

18:07.180 --> 18:08.640
 like the ovaries and testes.

18:08.640 --> 18:11.200
 And that makes sense for the following reason.

18:11.200 --> 18:15.280
 First of all, the brain, at least most of the brain

18:15.280 --> 18:18.000
 cannot regenerate after injury.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.480
 You just simply can't replace brain cells after injury.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.840
 I know people get really excited about neurogenesis,

18:22.840 --> 18:23.940
 the birth of new neurons,

18:23.940 --> 18:26.620
 and indeed neurogenesis has been demonstrated

18:26.620 --> 18:27.540
 in animal models.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.480
 And to some extent it exists in humans in a few places.

18:30.480 --> 18:32.400
 For instance, the olfactory bulb

18:32.400 --> 18:34.480
 where neurons are responsible

18:34.480 --> 18:36.400
 for detecting odorants in the environment,

18:36.400 --> 18:37.440
 for smell that is.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.800
 And in a little sub region of the hippocampus,

18:39.800 --> 18:42.780
 a memory area, there's probably some neurogenesis.

18:42.780 --> 18:44.700
 But the bulk of really good data out there

18:44.700 --> 18:46.400
 point to the fact that in humans,

18:46.400 --> 18:48.680
 there's not much turnover of neurons.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.160
 What that means is that the neurons you're born with

18:51.160 --> 18:53.580
 are the ones that you're going to be using

18:53.580 --> 18:56.240
 most if not all of your life.

18:56.240 --> 18:58.260
 In fact, you're born with many more neurons

18:58.260 --> 18:59.560
 than you'll have later.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.040
 And there's a process of naturally occurring cell death

19:02.040 --> 19:04.400
 called apoptosis that occurs during development.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.440
 So you actually are born with many more neurons

19:06.440 --> 19:07.340
 than you have later in life.

19:07.340 --> 19:10.540
 And that's the reflection of a normal healthy process

19:10.540 --> 19:13.040
 of nerve cell elimination.

19:13.040 --> 19:15.080
 So the estimates vary,

19:15.080 --> 19:18.040
 but anywhere from a third to maybe even a half

19:18.040 --> 19:19.440
 or even two thirds of neurons,

19:19.440 --> 19:20.280
 depending on the brain area,

19:20.280 --> 19:22.040
 just going to die across development.

19:22.040 --> 19:23.160
 That might sound terrible,

19:23.160 --> 19:24.240
 but that's actually one of the ways

19:24.240 --> 19:26.840
 in which you go from being kind of like a little potato bug

19:26.840 --> 19:28.780
 flopping around helplessly in your crib

19:28.780 --> 19:31.160
 to being an organism that can walk and talk

19:31.160 --> 19:34.180
 and articulate and calculate math

19:34.180 --> 19:36.520
 or do whatever it is that you do for a living.

19:36.520 --> 19:39.900
 So the brain has a set of elements,

19:39.900 --> 19:41.480
 these nerve cells and other cells,

19:41.480 --> 19:44.560
 and it needs to use those for the entire lifespan.

19:44.560 --> 19:47.200
 So having a BBB, a blood-brain barrier around the brain

19:47.200 --> 19:49.100
 is absolutely critical.

19:49.100 --> 19:52.980
 The ovaries and testes have a barrier for,

19:52.980 --> 19:56.300
 we assume the reason that they contain the genetic material

19:56.300 --> 19:59.780
 by which we can pass on our genes to our offspring progeny,

19:59.780 --> 20:00.620
 meaning make children,

20:00.620 --> 20:02.620
 and those children will have our genes

20:02.620 --> 20:04.540
 or at least half of them.

20:04.540 --> 20:06.680
 The other half from the partner, of course.

20:08.120 --> 20:12.880
 If the cells within the ovaries and testes are mutated,

20:12.880 --> 20:14.720
 well, then you can get mutations and offspring.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.080
 So that's very costly in the evolutionary sense.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.400
 So it makes sense that you would have

20:18.400 --> 20:19.800
 a barrier from the blood.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.700
 So if you ingest what's called a mutagen,

20:21.700 --> 20:25.040
 if you ingest something that can mutate the genes of cells,

20:25.040 --> 20:28.900
 you can imagine why there would be a premium

20:28.900 --> 20:31.720
 on not allowing those mutagens to get into the brain,

20:31.720 --> 20:33.480
 the ovaries or the testes, okay?

20:33.480 --> 20:34.960
 So the brain has this BBB,

20:34.960 --> 20:36.440
 this blood-brain barrier around it,

20:36.440 --> 20:38.200
 which makes it very, very hard for substances

20:38.200 --> 20:40.040
 to pass into the brain unless those substances

20:40.040 --> 20:44.140
 are very small or those substances and molecules

20:44.140 --> 20:46.920
 are critically required for brain function.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.640
 However, there are a couple of regions in the brain

20:50.640 --> 20:55.360
 that have a fence around them, but that fence is weaker.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.820
 Okay, it's sort of like going from a really big wall,

20:57.820 --> 21:02.280
 thick electronic 24-hour surveillance fence

21:02.280 --> 21:04.280
 where nothing can pass through except only

21:04.280 --> 21:06.940
 the exclusive cargo that's allowed to go through

21:06.940 --> 21:08.320
 to having a little cyclone fence

21:08.320 --> 21:09.680
 with a couple of holes in it,

21:09.680 --> 21:12.280
 or it's a kind of a picket fence that's falling over

21:12.280 --> 21:15.440
 and substances can move freely from the blood

21:15.440 --> 21:17.600
 circulating in the body into the brain.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.400
 And it turns out that the areas of the brain

21:19.400 --> 21:22.840
 that monitor salt balance and other features

21:22.840 --> 21:25.320
 of what's happening in the body at the level

21:25.320 --> 21:30.020
 of what we call osmolarity, at the concentration of salt

21:30.020 --> 21:34.500
 reside in these little sets of neurons

21:34.500 --> 21:37.440
 that sit just on the other side of these weak fences.

21:37.440 --> 21:39.780
 And the most important and famous of these

21:39.780 --> 21:43.500
 for the sake of today's conversation is one called OVLT.

21:43.500 --> 21:46.300
 OVLT stands for the organum vasculosum

21:46.300 --> 21:48.020
 of the lateral terminalis.

21:48.020 --> 21:50.660
 It is what's called a circumventricular organ.

21:50.660 --> 21:51.820
 Why circumventricular?

21:51.820 --> 21:54.180
 Well, not to bog you down with neuroanatomy,

21:54.180 --> 21:57.820
 but your brain is a big squishy mass of neurons

21:57.820 --> 22:00.820
 and other cell types, but it has to be nourished.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.500
 And through the middle of that brain,

22:03.500 --> 22:06.880
 there is a tube, there's a hollow that creates spaces.

22:06.880 --> 22:08.900
 And those spaces are called ventricles.

22:08.900 --> 22:12.780
 The ventricles are spaces in which cerebral spinal fluid

22:12.780 --> 22:15.040
 circulates and it nourishes the brain.

22:15.040 --> 22:17.780
 It does a number of other things as well.

22:17.780 --> 22:21.500
 The circumventricular organs are areas of the brain

22:21.500 --> 22:23.780
 that are near that circulating fluid.

22:23.780 --> 22:26.580
 And that circulating fluid has access to the bloodstream

22:26.580 --> 22:28.220
 and the bloodstream has access to it.

22:28.220 --> 22:31.260
 And this structure that I'm referring to OVLT,

22:31.260 --> 22:33.420
 organum vasculosum of the lateral terminalis,

22:33.420 --> 22:38.420
 has neurons that can sense the contents of the blood

22:38.660 --> 22:41.140
 and to some extent, the cerebral spinal fluid.

22:41.140 --> 22:42.580
 There are a couple other brain areas

22:42.580 --> 22:44.300
 that can do this as well.

22:44.300 --> 22:47.820
 They go also by the name of circumventricular organs.

22:47.820 --> 22:50.100
 And I'll talk about the names of some of those other areas.

22:50.100 --> 22:52.300
 But for today, and I think for sake

22:52.300 --> 22:53.260
 of most of the discussion,

22:53.260 --> 22:55.460
 understand that the OVLT is special.

22:55.460 --> 22:56.300
 Why?

22:56.300 --> 22:58.700
 Because it doesn't have this thick barrier fence,

22:58.700 --> 23:00.360
 which sounds like a bad thing.

23:00.360 --> 23:04.440
 And yet it's a terrific border detector.

23:04.440 --> 23:08.340
 The neurons in that region are able to pay attention

23:08.340 --> 23:10.860
 to what's passing through in the bloodstream

23:10.860 --> 23:12.620
 and can detect, for instance,

23:12.620 --> 23:15.260
 if the levels of sodium in the bloodstream are too low,

23:15.260 --> 23:17.300
 if the level of blood pressure in the body

23:17.300 --> 23:18.580
 is too low or too high,

23:18.580 --> 23:22.900
 and then the OVLT can send signals to other brain areas.

23:22.900 --> 23:24.620
 And then those other brain areas

23:24.620 --> 23:26.700
 can do things like release hormones

23:26.700 --> 23:28.540
 that can go and act on tissues

23:28.540 --> 23:31.500
 in what we call the periphery in the body.

23:31.500 --> 23:36.020
 And for instance, have the kidneys secrete more urine

23:36.020 --> 23:39.380
 to get rid of salt, that's excessive salt in the body,

23:39.380 --> 23:41.780
 or have the kidneys hold on to urine

23:41.780 --> 23:45.100
 to hold on to whatever water or fluid that one might need.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.020
 So before I go any deeper into this pathway,

23:47.020 --> 23:50.460
 just understand that the OVLT has a very limited barrier.

23:50.460 --> 23:52.380
 It can detect things in the bloodstream.

23:52.380 --> 23:55.780
 And this incredible area of the brain

23:55.780 --> 23:59.080
 almost single-handedly sets off the cascades of things

23:59.080 --> 24:02.020
 that allow you to regulate your salt balance,

24:02.020 --> 24:04.080
 which turns out to be absolutely critical,

24:04.080 --> 24:05.660
 not just for your ability to think

24:05.660 --> 24:08.420
 and for your neurons to work, but indeed for all of life.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.320
 If the OVLT doesn't function correctly,

24:10.320 --> 24:12.700
 you're effectively dead or dead soon.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.980
 So this is a very important brain region.

24:14.980 --> 24:17.080
 So let's talk about the function of the OVLT

24:17.080 --> 24:20.340
 and flesh out some of the other aspects of its circuitry,

24:20.340 --> 24:22.320
 of its communication with other brain areas

24:22.320 --> 24:23.160
 and with the body.

24:23.160 --> 24:25.620
 In the context of something that we are all familiar with,

24:25.620 --> 24:27.060
 which is thirst.

24:27.060 --> 24:29.900
 Have you ever wondered just why you get thirsty?

24:29.900 --> 24:33.340
 Well, it's because neurons in your OVLT

24:33.340 --> 24:35.540
 are detecting changes in your bloodstream,

24:35.540 --> 24:38.500
 which detect global changes within your body.

24:38.500 --> 24:40.320
 And in response to that,

24:40.320 --> 24:44.780
 your OVLT sets off certain events within your brain and body

24:44.780 --> 24:47.360
 that make you either want to drink more fluid

24:47.360 --> 24:49.060
 or to stop drinking fluid.

24:49.060 --> 24:52.380
 There are two main kinds of thirst.

24:52.380 --> 24:54.860
 The first one is called osmotic thirst.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.800
 And the second is called hypovolemic thirst.

24:58.900 --> 25:01.820
 Osmotic thirst has to do with the concentration of salt

25:01.820 --> 25:03.200
 in your bloodstream.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.460
 So let's say you ingest something very, very salty.

25:05.460 --> 25:08.200
 Let's say you ingest a big bag of,

25:08.200 --> 25:09.840
 I confess I don't eat these very often,

25:09.840 --> 25:11.720
 but I really like those kettle potato chips

25:11.720 --> 25:12.620
 and they're pretty salty.

25:12.620 --> 25:14.620
 I've never actually measured how much sodium is in them.

25:14.620 --> 25:15.720
 I'm sure the information is there.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.560
 Every once in a while,

25:17.560 --> 25:20.940
 if I'm particularly interested in doing so,

25:20.940 --> 25:22.420
 I'll just down a bag of those things.

25:22.420 --> 25:24.320
 And I really like them and they're very salty,

25:24.320 --> 25:26.500
 but they almost always make me feel thirsty.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.920
 And the reason is that by eating those,

25:28.920 --> 25:30.300
 I've ingested a lot of sodium.

25:30.300 --> 25:32.500
 Again, not a frequent occurrence for me,

25:32.500 --> 25:34.780
 but happens every now and again.

25:34.780 --> 25:36.580
 And I don't have too much shame about that

25:36.580 --> 25:38.900
 because I think I have a pretty healthy relationship

25:38.900 --> 25:40.860
 to food and I enjoy them.

25:40.860 --> 25:44.220
 And I understand that it will drive salt levels

25:44.220 --> 25:45.680
 up in my bloodstream.

25:45.680 --> 25:48.500
 And that will cause me to be thirsty.

25:48.500 --> 25:49.460
 But why, why?

25:49.460 --> 25:53.780
 Because neurons in the OVLT come in two main varieties.

25:53.780 --> 25:57.760
 One variety senses the osmolarity of the blood

25:57.760 --> 25:59.880
 that's getting across that weak little fence

25:59.880 --> 26:01.380
 that we talked about before.

26:01.380 --> 26:03.020
 And when the osmolarity,

26:03.020 --> 26:06.360
 meaning the salt concentration in the blood is high,

26:06.360 --> 26:09.300
 it activates these specific neurons in the OVLT.

26:09.300 --> 26:10.140
 And by activates,

26:10.140 --> 26:13.160
 I mean it causes them to send electrical potentials,

26:13.160 --> 26:17.660
 literally send electrical signals to other brain areas.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.020
 And those other brain areas

26:19.020 --> 26:21.920
 inspire a number of different downstream events.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.920
 So what are those other brain areas?

26:23.920 --> 26:27.820
 Well, the OVLT signals to an area

26:27.820 --> 26:30.300
 called the supraoptic nucleus.

26:30.300 --> 26:33.240
 The name and why it's called the supraoptic nucleus

26:33.240 --> 26:34.940
 is not necessarily important.

26:34.940 --> 26:37.820
 It also signals to the so-called paraventricular nucleus,

26:37.820 --> 26:39.780
 another nucleus that sits near the ventricles

26:39.780 --> 26:42.960
 and can monitor the qualities,

26:42.960 --> 26:45.500
 the chemical qualities of the cerebral spinal fluid,

26:45.500 --> 26:48.340
 as well as probably the bloodstream as well.

26:48.340 --> 26:53.340
 And the consequence of that communication

26:53.580 --> 26:57.180
 is that a particular hormone is eventually released

26:57.180 --> 26:59.680
 from the posterior pituitary.

26:59.680 --> 27:02.780
 Now the pituitary is a gland

27:02.780 --> 27:05.100
 that sits near the roof of your mouth.

27:05.100 --> 27:07.960
 It releases all sorts of things like growth hormone

27:07.960 --> 27:09.380
 and luteinizing hormone.

27:09.380 --> 27:11.860
 Luteinizing hormone will stimulate things like estrogen

27:11.860 --> 27:14.980
 and testosterone production and release

27:14.980 --> 27:17.600
 from the ovaries and testes and so on.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.460
 The pituitary has a bunch of different compartments

27:19.460 --> 27:22.580
 and functions, but what's really cool about the pituitary

27:22.580 --> 27:24.500
 is that certain regions of the pituitary

27:24.500 --> 27:27.460
 actually contain the axons, the wires of neurons,

27:27.460 --> 27:29.540
 and the neurons reside in the brain.

27:29.540 --> 27:34.540
 And so the supraoptic nucleus gets a signal from the OVLT.

27:34.900 --> 27:37.400
 The signal is purely in the form of electrical activity.

27:37.400 --> 27:39.380
 Remember, neurons aren't talking to one another

27:39.380 --> 27:40.740
 about what's happening out there.

27:40.740 --> 27:43.600
 They're not saying, hey, there's too much salt

27:43.600 --> 27:45.420
 in the bloodstream, let's do something about it.

27:45.420 --> 27:47.820
 All they receive are so-called action potential,

27:47.820 --> 27:49.460
 waves of electricity.

27:49.460 --> 27:51.780
 The neurons in the supraoptic nucleus

27:51.780 --> 27:55.980
 then release their own electrical signals

27:55.980 --> 27:59.200
 within the pituitary and some of those neurons

27:59.200 --> 28:02.660
 and nearby neurons are capable of releasing hormones

28:02.660 --> 28:05.320
 as well as electrical signals.

28:05.320 --> 28:08.160
 So from the pituitary, there's a hormonal signal

28:08.160 --> 28:10.900
 that's released called vasopressin.

28:10.900 --> 28:15.520
 Vasopressin also goes by the name antidiuretic hormone

28:15.520 --> 28:19.720
 and antidiuretic hormone has the capacity

28:19.720 --> 28:23.780
 to either restrict the amount of urine that we secrete

28:23.780 --> 28:26.100
 or when that system is turned off

28:26.100 --> 28:29.580
 to increase the amount of urine that we secrete.

28:29.580 --> 28:33.500
 So there's a complicated set of cascades that's evoked

28:33.500 --> 28:35.920
 by having high salt concentration in the blood.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.780
 There's also a complicated set of cascades that are evoked

28:38.780 --> 28:42.220
 by having low concentrations of sodium in the blood.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.180
 But the pathway is nonetheless the same.

28:44.180 --> 28:47.820
 It's OVLT is detecting those osmolarity changes,

28:47.820 --> 28:49.700
 communicating to the supraoptic nucleus.

28:49.700 --> 28:54.340
 Supraoptic nucleus is either causing the release of

28:54.340 --> 28:57.820
 or is releasing vasopressin, antidiuretic hormone,

28:57.820 --> 28:59.820
 or that system is shut off

28:59.820 --> 29:03.460
 so that the antidiuretic hormone is not secreted,

29:03.460 --> 29:06.220
 which would allow urine to flow more freely, right?

29:06.220 --> 29:10.440
 Antidiuretic means anti-release of urine.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.740
 And by shutting that off,

29:12.740 --> 29:15.940
 you're going to cause the release of urine.

29:15.940 --> 29:18.720
 You're sort of allowing a system to flow, so to speak.

29:18.720 --> 29:22.980
 The second category of thirst is hypovolemic thirst.

29:22.980 --> 29:26.000
 Hypovolemic thirst occurs when there's a drop

29:26.000 --> 29:27.820
 in blood pressure, okay?

29:27.820 --> 29:29.740
 So the OVLT, as I mentioned before,

29:29.740 --> 29:33.340
 can sense osmolarity based on the fact

29:33.340 --> 29:35.100
 that it has these neurons that can detect

29:35.100 --> 29:37.100
 how much salt is in the bloodstream.

29:38.020 --> 29:41.460
 But the OVLT also harbors neurons

29:41.460 --> 29:46.460
 that are of the baroreceptor, mechanoreceptor category.

29:46.820 --> 29:50.820
 Now, more on baroreceptors and mechanoreceptors later,

29:50.820 --> 29:55.820
 but baroreceptors are essentially a receptor,

29:55.860 --> 29:58.220
 meaning a protein that's in a cell

29:58.220 --> 30:01.540
 that responds to changes in blood pressure.

30:01.540 --> 30:03.940
 So there are a number of things that can cause decreases

30:03.940 --> 30:04.880
 in blood pressure.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.220
 Some of those include, for instance,

30:07.220 --> 30:08.900
 if you lose a lot of blood, right?

30:08.900 --> 30:10.580
 If you're bleeding quite a lot,

30:10.580 --> 30:14.240
 or in some cases, if you vomit quite a lot,

30:14.240 --> 30:16.420
 or if you have extensive diarrhea,

30:16.420 --> 30:17.780
 or any combination of those.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.700
 And there are other things that can reduce blood volume,

30:20.700 --> 30:23.260
 and we will talk about some of those later.

30:23.260 --> 30:27.460
 But in the classic case of hypovolemic thirst,

30:27.460 --> 30:29.460
 one is simply losing blood,

30:29.460 --> 30:31.180
 and therefore blood pressure goes down.

30:31.180 --> 30:33.040
 So very simple to imagine in your mind,

30:33.040 --> 30:33.880
 you have these pipes,

30:33.880 --> 30:35.320
 which are the arteries, veins, and capillaries,

30:35.320 --> 30:37.260
 and when you lose some blood volume,

30:37.260 --> 30:39.200
 the pressure in those arteries,

30:39.200 --> 30:40.780
 veins, and capillaries goes down.

30:40.780 --> 30:44.180
 OVLT has neurons that can sense that reduction

30:44.180 --> 30:46.460
 in blood pressure because of the presence

30:46.460 --> 30:48.280
 of baroreceptors in OVLT.

30:49.540 --> 30:54.420
 There are other elements that also play into the response

30:54.420 --> 30:57.560
 to what we call hypovolemic thirst.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.400
 For instance, the kidney will secrete

31:00.400 --> 31:02.060
 something called renin.

31:02.060 --> 31:05.740
 Renin will activate something called angiotensin II

31:05.740 --> 31:07.620
 from the lungs of all things.

31:07.620 --> 31:08.460
 Amazing.

31:08.460 --> 31:12.100
 And angiotensin II itself can act on OVLT,

31:12.100 --> 31:14.300
 organum vasculosum and lateral terminalis,

31:14.300 --> 31:18.780
 which in turn will create thirst.

31:18.780 --> 31:21.180
 So in both cases,

31:21.180 --> 31:23.420
 the osmolarity sensing system,

31:23.420 --> 31:24.700
 meaning osmotic thirst,

31:24.700 --> 31:26.100
 and in hypovolemic thirst,

31:26.100 --> 31:28.640
 where blood pressure has dropped,

31:28.640 --> 31:31.700
 the end result is a desire to drink more.

31:31.700 --> 31:34.140
 And that desire to drink more comes through a variety

31:34.140 --> 31:36.400
 of pathways that are both direct and indirect,

31:36.400 --> 31:38.780
 include vasopressin and don't include vasopressin.

31:38.780 --> 31:42.240
 But I think for just sake of general example,

31:42.240 --> 31:44.600
 and even for those of you that don't have any biology

31:44.600 --> 31:46.540
 background or physiology background,

31:46.540 --> 31:49.920
 just understand that there are two main types of thirst.

31:49.920 --> 31:54.060
 Both types of thirst, osmotic thirst and hypovolemic thirst,

31:54.060 --> 31:56.220
 are not just about seeking water,

31:56.220 --> 31:58.660
 but they also are about seeking salt.

31:59.780 --> 32:01.780
 In very general terms,

32:01.780 --> 32:03.480
 salt, AKA sodium,

32:04.740 --> 32:06.900
 can help retain water.

32:06.900 --> 32:10.100
 Now that doesn't mean that salt always retains water.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.920
 If you have excessive amounts of salt,

32:11.920 --> 32:13.980
 will you retain excessive amounts of water?

32:13.980 --> 32:17.260
 Well, sort of, as we'll soon learn, it's all contextual.

32:17.260 --> 32:19.900
 But for most cases,

32:19.900 --> 32:23.540
 we can say that by having salt in our system,

32:23.540 --> 32:25.800
 our brain and our body can function normally,

32:25.800 --> 32:28.380
 provided the levels of salt are adequate

32:28.380 --> 32:30.660
 and not too high or too low.

32:30.660 --> 32:34.680
 And thirst, while we often think of it as just a way

32:34.680 --> 32:36.700
 to bring fluid into our body,

32:36.700 --> 32:41.560
 is designed as a kind of a interoceptive perception.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.560
 What I mean by that,

32:42.560 --> 32:44.440
 and interoception, as many of you know now

32:44.440 --> 32:45.500
 from listening to this podcast,

32:45.500 --> 32:48.900
 is a pang of attention or a recognition, rather,

32:48.900 --> 32:50.680
 a conscious recognition of the events

32:50.680 --> 32:52.440
 going on within our body.

32:52.440 --> 32:54.100
 So when we are thirsty,

32:54.100 --> 32:55.980
 it's a certain form of interoception.

32:55.980 --> 32:58.600
 We go, oh, I need something, or I crave something.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.220
 You may not know exactly what you need,

33:00.220 --> 33:03.500
 but when you are thirsty, you're not just seeking water.

33:03.500 --> 33:07.000
 You're also seeking to balance your osmolarity,

33:07.000 --> 33:12.000
 which means you may be seeking salty fluids or foods.

33:12.700 --> 33:15.500
 In some cases, you'll try and accomplish this by eating.

33:15.500 --> 33:17.740
 Or it may be that you're trying to avoid,

33:17.740 --> 33:21.640
 or you will be inspired to avoid salty fluids and foods.

33:21.640 --> 33:24.680
 But if you want to understand sodium

33:24.680 --> 33:26.960
 and its roles in the body, you have to understand thirst.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.220
 And if you want to understand thirst,

33:28.220 --> 33:31.280
 you have to understand how fluid balance

33:31.280 --> 33:32.240
 is regulated in the body.

33:32.240 --> 33:34.280
 That's not surprising at all.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.520
 But sodium and water work together

33:37.520 --> 33:39.600
 in order to generate what we call thirst.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.300
 Sodium and water work together

33:41.300 --> 33:43.660
 in order to either retain water

33:43.660 --> 33:46.880
 or inspire us to let go of water, to urinate.

33:46.880 --> 33:50.440
 So before we can dive into the specifics around salt

33:50.440 --> 33:52.040
 and how to use salt for performance

33:52.040 --> 33:55.420
 and various recommendations and things to avoid,

33:55.420 --> 33:57.400
 we need to drill a little bit deeper

33:57.400 --> 34:00.240
 into this fluid balance mechanism in the body.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.920
 And for that reason, we have to pay

34:01.920 --> 34:04.180
 at least a little bit of attention to the kidney.

34:04.180 --> 34:06.680
 The kidney is an incredible organ.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.920
 And one of the reasons the kidney is so amazing

34:08.920 --> 34:13.040
 is that it's responsible for both retaining, holding onto,

34:13.040 --> 34:16.720
 or allowing the release of various substances from the body.

34:16.720 --> 34:21.720
 Substances like glucose or amino acids, urea, uric acid,

34:23.600 --> 34:26.140
 salt, potassium, magnesium.

34:26.140 --> 34:27.580
 It's basically a filter,

34:27.580 --> 34:31.120
 but it's a very, very intelligent filter.

34:31.120 --> 34:33.480
 I mean, intelligent meaning it doesn't have its own mind,

34:33.480 --> 34:36.320
 but the way it works is really beautiful.

34:36.320 --> 34:39.480
 Basically, blood enters the kidney

34:39.480 --> 34:42.620
 and it goes through a series of tubes,

34:42.620 --> 34:44.320
 which are arranged into loops.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.560
 If you want to look more into this,

34:45.560 --> 34:48.120
 there's the beautiful loop of Henle

34:48.120 --> 34:51.080
 and other aspects of the kidney design

34:51.080 --> 34:55.460
 that allow certain substances to be retained

34:55.460 --> 34:56.920
 and other substances to be released,

34:56.920 --> 34:58.320
 depending on how concentrated

34:58.320 --> 35:00.000
 those substances are in the blood.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.560
 The kidney responds to a number of hormonal signals,

35:04.560 --> 35:08.200
 including vasopressin, in order to, for instance,

35:08.200 --> 35:11.560
 antidiuretic hormone, in order to hold on to more fluid,

35:11.560 --> 35:14.040
 if that's what your brain and body need.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.760
 And it responds to other hormonal signals as well.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.960
 So it's a pretty complex organ.

35:19.960 --> 35:22.600
 Nonetheless, there's a key point,

35:22.600 --> 35:23.600
 which I already mentioned,

35:23.600 --> 35:25.240
 that I think most people don't realize,

35:25.240 --> 35:27.180
 that this is actually something that I like to tell kids

35:27.180 --> 35:29.200
 when I meet them, provided that they're of appropriate age.

35:29.200 --> 35:33.040
 I'll say, oftentimes when kids learn that I'm a scientist,

35:33.040 --> 35:36.480
 they'll ask a question about something related to science

35:36.480 --> 35:38.360
 and hopefully, for my sake,

35:38.360 --> 35:40.520
 it's something about neuroscience.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.040
 But one thing that I'll tell kids, I'll say,

35:43.040 --> 35:44.760
 do you know that your urine,

35:44.760 --> 35:47.040
 your pee is actually filtered blood?

35:47.040 --> 35:49.480
 And occasionally that will really terrify a kid,

35:49.480 --> 35:52.980
 but that also occasionally really terrifies an adult.

35:52.980 --> 35:55.480
 But indeed, your urine is filtered blood.

35:55.480 --> 35:57.140
 They see blood gets into the kidney,

35:57.140 --> 35:58.820
 the kidney is going to filter out certain things,

35:58.820 --> 36:00.280
 certain things are going to be allowed to pass through

36:00.280 --> 36:02.460
 and others are not, okay?

36:02.460 --> 36:07.080
 So the way the kidney is designed is that about 90%

36:07.080 --> 36:09.480
 of the stuff that's absorbed from the blood

36:09.480 --> 36:13.340
 is going to be absorbed early in this series of tubes.

36:13.340 --> 36:16.760
 And only a small percentage is going to be regulated

36:16.760 --> 36:18.240
 or worked out as you get into what's called

36:18.240 --> 36:19.520
 the distal kidney.

36:19.520 --> 36:23.240
 Distal just means the furthest part away, okay?

36:23.240 --> 36:25.500
 The proximal is up close.

36:25.500 --> 36:27.000
 So like your shoulder is proximal

36:27.000 --> 36:29.840
 to your midline of your body and your hand is distal.

36:29.840 --> 36:32.000
 So in biological terms, you hear about proximal distal,

36:32.000 --> 36:34.320
 which just means near or far from.

36:34.320 --> 36:36.120
 So just to give a really simple example,

36:36.120 --> 36:39.920
 let's say that you are very low on fluid.

36:39.920 --> 36:41.360
 You haven't had much to drink in a while.

36:41.360 --> 36:43.440
 Maybe you're walking around on a hot day.

36:44.360 --> 36:48.120
 Chances are that the neurons in your OVLT

36:48.120 --> 36:51.320
 will sense the increase in osmolarity, right?

36:51.320 --> 36:54.500
 The concentration of salt is going to be increased

36:54.500 --> 36:58.140
 relative to the fluid volume that's circulating.

36:58.140 --> 37:00.180
 This of course assumes that you haven't excreted

37:00.180 --> 37:02.280
 a lot of sodium for one reason or another,

37:02.280 --> 37:05.880
 but that increase in osmolarity is detected by the OVLT.

37:05.880 --> 37:09.440
 The OVLT is going to signal a bunch of different cascades

37:09.440 --> 37:11.560
 through the super optic nucleus, et cetera.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.680
 And then vasopressin is going to be released

37:13.680 --> 37:16.000
 into the bloodstream and vasopressin,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.340
 again also called antidiuretic hormone,

37:18.340 --> 37:22.240
 is going to act on the kidney and change the kidney's

37:22.240 --> 37:24.880
 function in a couple of different ways,

37:24.880 --> 37:28.200
 some mechanical, some chemical, okay?

37:28.200 --> 37:30.620
 In order to make sure that your kidney

37:30.620 --> 37:32.880
 does not release much water,

37:32.880 --> 37:35.260
 doesn't make you want to urinate.

37:35.260 --> 37:37.320
 And in fact, even if you would try to urinate,

37:37.320 --> 37:40.060
 your body's going to tend to hold on to its fluid stores.

37:40.060 --> 37:42.960
 Okay, so very simple, straightforward example.

37:42.960 --> 37:45.240
 We can also give the other example whereby

37:45.240 --> 37:47.800
 if you were ingesting a lot, a lot, a lot of water,

37:47.800 --> 37:49.760
 and it's not a particularly hot day

37:49.760 --> 37:51.460
 and you're not sweating very much,

37:51.460 --> 37:53.440
 let's assume your salt intake is constant

37:53.440 --> 37:55.740
 or is low for whatever reason,

37:55.740 --> 37:58.880
 well then the osmolarity, the salt concentration

37:58.880 --> 38:00.300
 in your blood is going to be lower.

38:00.300 --> 38:02.600
 Your OVLT will detect that

38:02.600 --> 38:06.800
 because of these osmo-sensing neurons in your OVLT,

38:06.800 --> 38:11.800
 your OVLT will fail to signal to the super optic nucleus

38:13.100 --> 38:14.800
 and there will not be the release

38:14.800 --> 38:16.920
 of vasopressin antidiuretic hormone

38:16.920 --> 38:20.000
 and you can excrete all the water

38:20.000 --> 38:22.200
 that your body wants to excrete,

38:22.200 --> 38:23.440
 meaning you'll be able to urinate,

38:23.440 --> 38:25.760
 there's no holding on to water at the level of the kidney.

38:25.760 --> 38:27.140
 Okay, very simple examples,

38:27.140 --> 38:29.840
 but hopefully it illustrates how events within the blood,

38:29.840 --> 38:31.160
 meaning the concentration of salt

38:31.160 --> 38:33.540
 relative to the amount of fluid, right?

38:33.540 --> 38:37.360
 That's what osmolarity is, is detected by the OVLT.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.940
 The brain then communicates to the pituitary.

38:39.940 --> 38:42.120
 The pituitary sends a hormone out into the blood

38:42.120 --> 38:44.240
 and the hormone acts on the kidney

38:44.240 --> 38:48.400
 to either hold onto or let go of fluid,

38:48.400 --> 38:51.040
 meaning to prevent you from wanting to urinate

38:51.040 --> 38:54.120
 or from stimulating you to want to urinate.

38:54.120 --> 38:57.580
 Very, very simple kind of yes, no type situation here.

38:57.580 --> 38:59.520
 There's a lot of nuance to this in reality.

38:59.520 --> 39:01.100
 There are a lot of other hormones in this pathway,

39:01.100 --> 39:04.100
 but I think for at least this stage of the discussion,

39:04.100 --> 39:05.300
 this should be sufficient.

39:05.300 --> 39:06.880
 Some of you may have noticed

39:06.880 --> 39:09.360
 that a molecule we've been talking a lot about today,

39:09.360 --> 39:12.760
 vasopressin, was also mentioned on a previous episode

39:12.760 --> 39:13.960
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

39:13.960 --> 39:16.080
 but in a very different context.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.280
 The molecule I'm referring to is vasopressin

39:18.280 --> 39:23.280
 and as I mentioned, it's a hormone involved in antidiuresis,

39:23.660 --> 39:26.220
 meaning preventing urination.

39:26.220 --> 39:28.160
 It's an antidiuretic,

39:28.160 --> 39:31.280
 but we also talked about vasopressin in the context

39:31.280 --> 39:33.760
 of desire, love, and attachment.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.920
 We talked about it in the context of monogamy

39:35.920 --> 39:38.160
 and non-monogamy in a species of animal

39:38.160 --> 39:39.920
 called the prairie vole.

39:39.920 --> 39:41.840
 You can check out that episode.

39:41.840 --> 39:45.920
 I believe vasopressin and the non-monogamous prairie voles

39:45.920 --> 39:48.360
 are mentioned in the timestamp,

39:48.360 --> 39:50.560
 so it should be easy to find.

39:50.560 --> 39:53.660
 Vasopressin is made at multiple locations

39:53.660 --> 39:56.760
 in the nervous system, mainly the super optic nucleus,

39:56.760 --> 40:00.240
 and indeed, it's also involved in aspects

40:00.240 --> 40:03.180
 of sexual behavior and mating.

40:03.180 --> 40:06.520
 Now, it does that through mechanisms that are distinct

40:06.520 --> 40:08.920
 from its antidiuretic effects.

40:10.480 --> 40:14.860
 In fact, there are people who take vasopressin

40:14.860 --> 40:16.460
 as an aphrodisiac.

40:16.460 --> 40:19.080
 Now, I'm certainly not suggesting people do that,

40:19.080 --> 40:22.320
 but I have all the confidence in the world

40:22.320 --> 40:23.800
 that the moment I talk about vasopressin,

40:23.800 --> 40:24.920
 someone in the comments is going to say,

40:24.920 --> 40:26.960
 what do you think about vasopressin nasal sprays

40:26.960 --> 40:28.160
 and this kind of thing?

40:28.160 --> 40:30.420
 Vasopressin and indeed oxytocin,

40:30.420 --> 40:33.840
 another hormone that's involved in pair bonding

40:33.840 --> 40:36.520
 and various aspects of brain and body function,

40:36.520 --> 40:39.300
 are available as nasal sprays

40:39.300 --> 40:42.240
 that can get up into the deep recesses of the brain

40:42.240 --> 40:44.580
 and it can impact some of these core,

40:44.580 --> 40:46.080
 what we call hypothalamic functions,

40:46.080 --> 40:48.560
 these primitive drives and hypothalamic functions.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.720
 I would encourage a lot of caution,

40:51.720 --> 40:54.520
 maybe even extreme caution in recreational use

40:54.520 --> 40:56.720
 of things like vasopressin and oxytocin,

40:56.720 --> 40:59.720
 unless you are working with an MD, excuse me,

40:59.720 --> 41:00.560
 and they prescribe it,

41:00.560 --> 41:01.840
 or they really know what they're doing.

41:01.840 --> 41:03.600
 These are powerful hormones

41:03.600 --> 41:06.480
 that have a lot of different effects on the brain and body.

41:06.480 --> 41:09.860
 The way that vasopressin, meaning antidiuretic hormone,

41:09.860 --> 41:13.800
 prevents the release of fluid as urine from the body

41:13.800 --> 41:15.080
 is pretty interesting.

41:15.080 --> 41:17.200
 It acts directly on the kidney.

41:17.200 --> 41:19.700
 So as I mentioned before, blood flows into the kidney,

41:19.700 --> 41:21.020
 a number of things are retained

41:21.020 --> 41:22.880
 in the early part of the kidney.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.560
 Vasopressin acts at a fairly distal,

41:25.560 --> 41:28.920
 meaning kind of end game,

41:28.920 --> 41:32.020
 part of the loops of tubes through the kidney,

41:32.020 --> 41:35.420
 and it increases the permeability of those tubes.

41:35.420 --> 41:37.480
 In other words, it makes sure that the fluid

41:37.480 --> 41:40.320
 that would otherwise pass into a collecting duct

41:40.320 --> 41:41.580
 and then go out to the bladder

41:41.580 --> 41:43.960
 never actually makes it to the bladder.

41:43.960 --> 41:46.940
 I point this out because what antidiuretic hormone does

41:46.940 --> 41:49.120
 is it prevents the bladder from filling at all.

41:49.120 --> 41:51.340
 It's not as if it locks fluid in the bladder

41:51.340 --> 41:52.840
 and prevents you from urinating.

41:52.840 --> 41:54.920
 I think the way I've been describing things up until now

41:54.920 --> 41:56.960
 and the way you'll hear about antidiuretic hormone,

41:56.960 --> 41:59.400
 it might sound like it kind of locks up the bladder,

41:59.400 --> 42:01.200
 prevents you from being able to urinate,

42:01.200 --> 42:02.120
 but you have a full bladder.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.180
 That would be very uncomfortable.

42:03.180 --> 42:04.400
 That's not the way it works.

42:04.400 --> 42:08.400
 It actually causes the tubes headed towards the bladder

42:08.400 --> 42:10.360
 from the kidney to become permeable,

42:10.360 --> 42:14.340
 meaning to allow fluid to go back into the bloodstream,

42:14.340 --> 42:15.300
 into the rest of the body,

42:15.300 --> 42:17.240
 so that fluid never actually fills the bladder

42:17.240 --> 42:19.400
 and so you never feel the urge to urinate.

42:19.400 --> 42:22.040
 Now, this is an episode about salt.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.920
 A key thing to understand about the kidney

42:23.920 --> 42:28.400
 is that the kidney uses sodium in order to conserve water,

42:28.400 --> 42:30.400
 which has everything to do with the fact

42:30.400 --> 42:33.000
 that sodium can actually hold water.

42:33.920 --> 42:37.660
 Put differently, water tends to follow sodium.

42:37.660 --> 42:40.540
 So where we have sodium, we tend to have water

42:40.540 --> 42:45.400
 and sodium when it's concentrated can hold on to water.

42:45.400 --> 42:46.780
 And that's one of the main ways

42:46.780 --> 42:49.280
 that the kidney holds on to water in the body.

42:49.280 --> 42:51.240
 And as we'll soon learn,

42:51.240 --> 42:55.000
 there is no simple and direct formula to say, for instance,

42:55.000 --> 42:59.880
 okay, if salt levels are high, a lot of water is retained.

42:59.880 --> 43:04.260
 And if salt levels are low, a lot of water is released.

43:04.260 --> 43:06.360
 On the one hand, that can be true,

43:06.360 --> 43:09.840
 but it's also the case because these systems are homeostatic,

43:09.840 --> 43:11.840
 meaning they're always seeking balance,

43:11.840 --> 43:14.040
 both within system, within the salt system,

43:14.040 --> 43:16.980
 and between systems, the salt and water system,

43:16.980 --> 43:21.980
 it's also the case often that if we have enough sodium,

43:22.080 --> 43:25.960
 well, then we can secrete sodium and some water will follow.

43:25.960 --> 43:30.720
 Or if we don't have enough sodium, then yes, indeed,

43:31.620 --> 43:33.200
 because we're not holding on to water,

43:33.200 --> 43:35.320
 more fluid can be excreted.

43:35.320 --> 43:39.760
 But if that condition of low sodium lasts long enough,

43:39.760 --> 43:41.280
 then we start to retain water

43:41.280 --> 43:44.280
 because the body recognizes, ah, salt is low

43:44.280 --> 43:46.120
 and water is being excreted

43:46.120 --> 43:49.300
 and eventually a system will kick in to retain water.

43:49.300 --> 43:52.000
 So I'd love to give you a simple black and white

43:52.000 --> 43:54.420
 yes or no answer for low sodium, high sodium,

43:54.420 --> 43:57.900
 moderate sodium and water balance, but it's all contextual.

43:57.900 --> 43:59.320
 And when I say contextual, I mean,

43:59.320 --> 44:02.800
 it will depend on blood pressure, hypertension,

44:02.800 --> 44:06.600
 pre-hypertension if that's there, maybe normal tension,

44:06.600 --> 44:10.280
 hormone levels, exercise, et cetera, et cetera.

44:10.280 --> 44:12.600
 A pretty good example of how complicated this can all be

44:12.600 --> 44:15.140
 is one that some of you may be familiar with.

44:15.140 --> 44:18.200
 It's pretty well known that during certain phases

44:18.200 --> 44:21.340
 of the menstrual cycle, when estrogen and progesterone

44:21.340 --> 44:23.120
 and other hormones are fluctuating,

44:23.120 --> 44:26.440
 that water can be retained in the body.

44:26.440 --> 44:29.480
 It's what's called edema or a swelling sometimes.

44:29.480 --> 44:32.820
 So the common assumption, and indeed it can be true,

44:32.820 --> 44:34.800
 that when estrogen levels are high,

44:34.800 --> 44:37.640
 there's water retention in the body.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.800
 Also in males, if estrogen levels are high,

44:39.800 --> 44:41.240
 there can be water retention in the body.

44:41.240 --> 44:44.040
 This is one of the reasons why athletes

44:44.040 --> 44:46.700
 and in particular bodybuilders who take anabolic steroids

44:46.700 --> 44:49.320
 like testosterone, which can be converted into estrogens,

44:49.320 --> 44:50.840
 sometimes they'll walk around,

44:50.840 --> 44:52.360
 they look like they were partially inflated,

44:52.360 --> 44:53.520
 they look like they're going to pop,

44:53.520 --> 44:55.640
 and it looks like a swelling of the skin,

44:55.640 --> 44:57.120
 not just because they have large muscles.

44:57.120 --> 45:00.140
 And that's not always, but often water retention

45:00.140 --> 45:03.460
 due to testosterone conversion into estrogen.

45:03.460 --> 45:05.880
 Now, that all sounds consistent, right?

45:05.880 --> 45:08.320
 Estrogen levels fluctuated in the menstrual cycle,

45:08.320 --> 45:10.220
 in males where there's an increase in estrogen,

45:10.220 --> 45:11.520
 there's retention of water,

45:11.520 --> 45:14.840
 but actually estrogen acts as a diuretic.

45:14.840 --> 45:17.320
 So one would think, okay, when estrogen levels go up,

45:17.320 --> 45:19.200
 there should be a lot of fluid excreted.

45:19.200 --> 45:21.280
 But I bring up this example to point out

45:21.280 --> 45:23.560
 that it's a very complicated and dynamic balance

45:23.560 --> 45:25.880
 between hormones and salt and fluid.

45:25.880 --> 45:28.520
 You can't draw a one-to-one relationship there.

45:28.520 --> 45:30.760
 And that turns out to be a very important point,

45:30.760 --> 45:33.040
 and we can use that not as a way

45:33.040 --> 45:34.440
 to further complicate things,

45:34.440 --> 45:39.200
 but as a way to understand under which context,

45:39.200 --> 45:43.280
 less sodium intake or more sodium intake can be beneficial.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.240
 So that's where I'd like to turn our attention now.

45:45.240 --> 45:48.640
 So how much salt do we need and what can we trust

45:48.640 --> 45:52.240
 in terms of trying to guide our ingestion of salt?

45:53.160 --> 45:55.320
 First of all, I want to be very, very clear

45:55.320 --> 45:57.520
 that there are a number of people out there

45:57.520 --> 46:00.520
 that have pre-hypertension or hypertension.

46:00.520 --> 46:02.320
 You need to know if you have pre-hypertension

46:02.320 --> 46:03.520
 or hypertension.

46:03.520 --> 46:06.160
 You need to know if you have normal tension,

46:06.160 --> 46:07.880
 meaning normal blood pressure.

46:07.880 --> 46:10.560
 Everyone should know their blood pressure

46:10.560 --> 46:12.520
 is an absolutely crucial measurement

46:12.520 --> 46:15.360
 that has a lot of impact on your immediate

46:15.360 --> 46:17.360
 and long-term health outcomes.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.440
 It informs a lot about what you should do.

46:19.440 --> 46:21.600
 Should you be doing more cardiovascular exercise?

46:21.600 --> 46:24.240
 Should you be ingesting more or less salt?

46:24.240 --> 46:25.760
 Should you be adjusting any number

46:25.760 --> 46:27.320
 of different lifestyle factors?

46:27.320 --> 46:28.720
 So you need to know that.

46:28.720 --> 46:31.320
 And without knowing what your blood pressure is,

46:31.320 --> 46:34.400
 I can't give a one-size-fits-all recommendation.

46:34.400 --> 46:36.800
 And indeed, I'm not going to give medical recommendations.

46:36.800 --> 46:39.920
 I'm simply going to spell out what I know about the research,

46:39.920 --> 46:41.280
 which hopefully will point you in the direction

46:41.280 --> 46:42.960
 of figuring out what's right for you

46:42.960 --> 46:45.500
 in terms of salt and indeed fluid intake.

46:45.500 --> 46:47.000
 There is a school of thought

46:47.000 --> 46:50.380
 that everybody is consuming too much salt.

46:50.380 --> 46:54.520
 And I do want to highlight the fact that there are dozens,

46:54.520 --> 46:57.860
 if not hundreds of quality papers that point to the fact

46:57.860 --> 47:02.840
 that a quote-unquote high salt diet can be bad

47:02.840 --> 47:05.520
 for various organs and tissues in the body,

47:05.520 --> 47:07.340
 including the brain.

47:07.340 --> 47:11.520
 It just so happens that because fluid balance,

47:11.520 --> 47:14.280
 both inside and outside of cells is crucial,

47:14.280 --> 47:16.840
 not just for your heart and for your lungs

47:16.840 --> 47:19.300
 and for your liver and for all the organs of your body,

47:19.300 --> 47:20.820
 but also for your brain,

47:20.820 --> 47:25.120
 that if the salt concentration inside of cells

47:25.120 --> 47:29.740
 in your brain becomes too high, neurons suffer, right?

47:29.740 --> 47:32.040
 They will draw fluid into those cells

47:32.040 --> 47:36.260
 because water tends to follow salt, as I mentioned before,

47:36.260 --> 47:38.940
 and those cells can swell.

47:38.940 --> 47:41.160
 You can literally get swelling of brain tissue.

47:41.160 --> 47:45.440
 Conversely, if salt levels are too low inside of cells

47:45.440 --> 47:50.000
 in any tissue of the body, but in the brain included,

47:50.000 --> 47:54.840
 then the cells of the body and brain can shrink

47:54.840 --> 47:59.320
 because water is pulled into the extracellular space

47:59.320 --> 48:00.560
 away from cells.

48:00.560 --> 48:03.060
 And indeed, under those conditions,

48:03.060 --> 48:05.260
 brain function can suffer.

48:05.260 --> 48:08.000
 And indeed, the overall health of the brain can suffer.

48:08.000 --> 48:12.400
 So there are many reports out there indicating,

48:12.400 --> 48:15.360
 both in experimental models and to some extent in humans,

48:15.360 --> 48:17.760
 that overconsumption of salt is bad

48:17.760 --> 48:19.720
 for brain function and longevity.

48:19.720 --> 48:23.000
 And yet there's also decent evidence

48:23.000 --> 48:25.020
 in both animal models and humans

48:25.020 --> 48:28.200
 that if salt consumption is too low,

48:28.200 --> 48:31.220
 then brain health and longevity will suffer,

48:31.220 --> 48:33.880
 as will other organs and tissues of the body.

48:33.880 --> 48:35.400
 So like most things in biology,

48:35.400 --> 48:38.720
 you don't want things too high or too low.

48:38.720 --> 48:42.100
 Now, I would say that the vast majority of studies out there

48:42.100 --> 48:45.440
 point to the fact that a high salt diet

48:45.440 --> 48:48.500
 is detrimental to brain health and function.

48:48.500 --> 48:52.080
 Most of the studies have focused on that aspect

48:52.080 --> 48:55.440
 of salt balance and its consequences on brain function.

48:55.440 --> 49:00.440
 One critical issue with many of those studies, however,

49:00.940 --> 49:04.120
 is that the high salt diet is often coupled

49:04.120 --> 49:07.840
 to other elements of diet that are also unhealthy,

49:07.840 --> 49:10.720
 things like excessively high levels of carbohydrates

49:10.720 --> 49:14.040
 or fats or combinations of carbohydrates and fats.

49:14.040 --> 49:16.440
 And so while I know there are many burning questions

49:16.440 --> 49:18.840
 out there about how much salt one needs

49:18.840 --> 49:20.920
 if they are on a low carbohydrate diet,

49:20.920 --> 49:24.260
 or if they are fasting, or if they are on a vegan diet,

49:24.260 --> 49:26.860
 there have simply not been many studies

49:26.860 --> 49:29.480
 that have explored the low, moderate,

49:29.480 --> 49:31.440
 and high salt conditions

49:31.440 --> 49:34.280
 on a backdrop of very controlled nutrition.

49:34.280 --> 49:36.400
 And that's probably reflective of the fact

49:36.400 --> 49:38.000
 that there are not a lot

49:38.000 --> 49:40.200
 of very well-controlled nutrition studies out there.

49:40.200 --> 49:41.960
 There are some, of course,

49:41.960 --> 49:44.080
 but it's very hard to get people to adhere

49:44.080 --> 49:46.400
 to nutritional plans in a very strict way,

49:46.400 --> 49:48.960
 and to do that for sufficient periods of time

49:48.960 --> 49:52.600
 that would allow the various health outcomes to occur.

49:52.600 --> 49:55.360
 Nonetheless, there's some interesting reports

49:55.360 --> 49:58.920
 that indicate that the amount of salt intake

49:59.840 --> 50:03.360
 can indeed predict health outcomes,

50:03.360 --> 50:06.300
 or what we call hazardous events,

50:06.300 --> 50:09.520
 things like cardiovascular events and stroke and so forth.

50:09.520 --> 50:13.760
 And what's interesting is that indeed a lower,

50:13.760 --> 50:15.480
 I'm not saying low, right,

50:15.480 --> 50:16.800
 because I don't believe that you want your diet

50:16.800 --> 50:21.040
 to be truly low in anything except perhaps poison,

50:21.040 --> 50:25.840
 but a lower salt diet can reduce

50:25.840 --> 50:28.680
 the number of these so-called hazardous events,

50:28.680 --> 50:32.940
 but it's a somewhat of a shallow U-shaped function

50:32.940 --> 50:35.080
 such that yes, indeed,

50:35.080 --> 50:40.080
 a high salt intake can be very detrimental

50:40.080 --> 50:42.600
 for your health, both in terms of cardiovascular events,

50:42.600 --> 50:46.200
 stroke, and other deleterious health events,

50:46.200 --> 50:48.160
 but somewhere in the middle

50:48.160 --> 50:51.220
 that actually sits quite to the right,

50:51.220 --> 50:54.400
 meaning higher than what is typically recommended

50:54.400 --> 50:55.800
 for salt intake,

50:55.800 --> 50:58.760
 can actually reduce the number of these hazardous events.

50:58.760 --> 51:00.920
 At least some reports point to that.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.120
 And so I want to emphasize

51:02.120 --> 51:05.640
 what one of those particular reports says,

51:05.640 --> 51:07.540
 and I also want to be sure to counter it

51:07.540 --> 51:09.800
 from the perspective of the context

51:09.800 --> 51:10.880
 that that study was set in,

51:10.880 --> 51:13.040
 because again, my goal here is not to give you

51:13.040 --> 51:16.060
 a strict set of recommendations at all,

51:16.060 --> 51:18.040
 is to point you to the literature,

51:18.040 --> 51:19.880
 try and make that literature as clear as possible

51:19.880 --> 51:22.080
 and allow you to evaluate for yourself.

51:22.080 --> 51:23.600
 And I don't just say that to protect us,

51:23.600 --> 51:24.940
 I say that to protect you,

51:24.940 --> 51:26.720
 because indeed you are responsible

51:26.720 --> 51:28.560
 for your health and your health choices.

51:28.560 --> 51:30.640
 So the paper that I'm referring to,

51:30.640 --> 51:32.320
 it's a very interesting one.

51:32.320 --> 51:34.920
 We of course never want to put too much weight

51:34.920 --> 51:36.340
 on any one report,

51:36.340 --> 51:39.400
 but this is a paper that was published in 2011

51:39.400 --> 51:41.900
 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

51:41.900 --> 51:43.320
 The title of the paper is

51:43.320 --> 51:45.960
 Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion

51:45.960 --> 51:48.040
 and a Risk of Cardiovascular Events.

51:48.040 --> 51:50.480
 We have not talked much about potassium yet,

51:50.480 --> 51:53.580
 but sodium and potassium tend to work in concert

51:53.580 --> 51:54.740
 in the brain and body

51:54.740 --> 51:57.140
 in order to regulate various physiological functions

51:57.140 --> 51:57.980
 and health,

51:57.980 --> 52:00.360
 and we'll talk more about potassium as time goes on.

52:00.360 --> 52:05.360
 The key plot or set of data in this study,

52:05.720 --> 52:06.720
 for those of you that want to look it up,

52:06.720 --> 52:08.440
 we will link to it.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.080
 And there are a lot of data in here,

52:10.080 --> 52:11.220
 but it's figure one,

52:11.220 --> 52:14.200
 which is basically evaluating

52:14.200 --> 52:17.280
 the amount of urinary excretion of sodium,

52:17.280 --> 52:19.360
 which is a somewhat indirect,

52:19.360 --> 52:21.200
 but nonetheless valuable measure

52:21.200 --> 52:24.280
 of how much sodium people were ingesting.

52:24.280 --> 52:26.160
 And plotted against that

52:26.160 --> 52:28.220
 is what they call the hazard ratio.

52:28.220 --> 52:31.260
 And the hazard ratio points to

52:31.260 --> 52:33.520
 the composite of cardiovascular death stroke,

52:33.520 --> 52:35.240
 myocardial infarction,

52:35.240 --> 52:36.920
 and an infarct is an injury

52:36.920 --> 52:39.880
 and hospitalization for congestive heart failure.

52:39.880 --> 52:43.640
 And what it points to is the fact that the hazard ratio

52:43.640 --> 52:47.360
 is low-ish at sodium excretion

52:47.360 --> 52:49.740
 of about two grams per day,

52:49.740 --> 52:52.920
 but then continues to go down

52:52.920 --> 52:57.920
 until about 4.5 to five grams per day.

52:58.280 --> 52:59.840
 Remember, this is sodium excretion,

52:59.840 --> 53:02.840
 so it's reflective of how much sodium was in the body,

53:02.840 --> 53:05.120
 which is reflective of how much sodium was ingested.

53:05.120 --> 53:09.080
 And then the hazard ratio increases fairly dramatically,

53:09.080 --> 53:10.800
 a very steep slope,

53:10.800 --> 53:14.520
 heading anywhere from seven to eight to 10

53:14.520 --> 53:18.120
 and out towards 12 grams of sodium excretion per day.

53:18.120 --> 53:20.600
 So the simplest way to interpret these data

53:20.600 --> 53:24.800
 are that at fairly low levels of sodium,

53:24.800 --> 53:27.640
 meaning at about two grams per day,

53:27.640 --> 53:29.920
 you run fewer health risks,

53:29.920 --> 53:31.880
 but the number of risks continues to decline

53:31.880 --> 53:34.520
 as you move towards four and five grams per day.

53:34.520 --> 53:37.560
 And then as you increase your salt intake further,

53:37.560 --> 53:40.840
 then the risk dramatically increases.

53:40.840 --> 53:42.080
 So no study is holy,

53:42.080 --> 53:44.780
 nor is any figure in any study

53:44.780 --> 53:47.760
 or any collection of studies holy.

53:47.760 --> 53:50.280
 Rather, we always want to look at what the bulk of data

53:50.280 --> 53:52.640
 in a particular field reveal.

53:52.640 --> 53:54.900
 Nonetheless, I think the plot that we described,

53:54.900 --> 53:57.540
 meaning the graph that we described is pretty interesting

53:57.540 --> 54:02.540
 in light of the 2020 to 2025 dietary recommendations

54:03.100 --> 54:06.100
 for Americans, which is that people consume

54:06.100 --> 54:08.760
 no more than 2.3 grams,

54:08.760 --> 54:12.480
 meaning 2,300 milligrams of sodium per day.

54:12.480 --> 54:17.480
 That's about a half a teaspoon of salt per day.

54:17.920 --> 54:22.360
 Now, most people are probably consuming more than that

54:22.360 --> 54:26.380
 because of the fact that they are ingesting processed foods

54:26.380 --> 54:29.640
 and processed foods tend to have more salt in them

54:29.640 --> 54:30.780
 than non-processed foods.

54:30.780 --> 54:33.000
 Now, of course, that's not always the case, right?

54:33.000 --> 54:36.600
 Sea salt is not a processed food in most cases.

54:36.600 --> 54:39.120
 And there are a lot of unprocessed foods

54:39.120 --> 54:41.040
 that can be high in sodium,

54:41.040 --> 54:42.800
 but processed foods in particular

54:42.800 --> 54:43.780
 tend to have a lot of sodium.

54:43.780 --> 54:46.360
 You can see this simply by looking at the packaging

54:46.360 --> 54:48.080
 of any number of different foods.

54:48.080 --> 54:52.840
 But if we were to take this number of 2.3 grams,

54:52.840 --> 54:57.400
 that's the recommended cutoff for ingestion of sodium,

54:57.400 --> 55:01.060
 it actually falls in a portion of the curve

55:01.060 --> 55:02.760
 that we were talking about a moment ago

55:02.760 --> 55:04.800
 that indeed is associated

55:04.800 --> 55:09.540
 with low incidents of hazardous outcomes,

55:09.540 --> 55:11.740
 cardiovascular events, stroke, et cetera.

55:11.740 --> 55:15.320
 But according to that plot,

55:15.320 --> 55:19.400
 the ingestion of four or five grams of sodium,

55:19.400 --> 55:24.400
 almost double or more sodium than is currently recommended,

55:24.460 --> 55:29.280
 is associated with even lower numbers of hazardous events.

55:29.280 --> 55:30.640
 So we need to think about this

55:30.640 --> 55:32.480
 and we need to explore it in the context

55:32.480 --> 55:34.480
 of other studies, of course.

55:34.480 --> 55:37.920
 And we need to evaluate it in terms of this thing

55:37.920 --> 55:40.360
 that we've been going back to again and again,

55:40.360 --> 55:42.360
 which is context, right?

55:42.360 --> 55:46.540
 These recommendations of 2.3 gram per day cutoff

55:46.540 --> 55:48.200
 is in the context of a landscape

55:48.200 --> 55:51.360
 where some people do indeed have hypertension

55:51.360 --> 55:52.460
 or pre-hypertension.

55:53.400 --> 55:55.760
 The incidence of hypertension has gone up dramatically

55:55.760 --> 56:00.080
 in the last 100 years and seems to continue to go up.

56:00.080 --> 56:04.560
 Whether or not that's because of increased salt intake

56:04.560 --> 56:07.280
 or whether or not it's because of increased salt intake

56:07.280 --> 56:10.400
 and other things such as highly processed foods,

56:10.400 --> 56:11.280
 that isn't clear.

56:11.280 --> 56:13.120
 Again, pointing to the challenge

56:13.120 --> 56:14.880
 in doing these epidemiological studies

56:14.880 --> 56:17.820
 and really parsing what aspects of a change

56:17.820 --> 56:20.880
 in some health metric is due to, for instance,

56:20.880 --> 56:23.080
 the ingestion of more sugars versus more salts

56:23.080 --> 56:25.720
 or simply because of the ingestion of more salts.

56:25.720 --> 56:29.380
 It's a complicated, almost barbed wire topic by now,

56:29.380 --> 56:32.500
 but we can start to pull apart that barbed wire tangle

56:32.500 --> 56:35.560
 and start to evaluate some of the other people

56:35.560 --> 56:38.600
 in other conditions that exist out there,

56:38.600 --> 56:43.600
 maybe for you, that actually warrant more sodium intake

56:43.760 --> 56:46.680
 and where more sodium intake might actually be beneficial.

56:46.680 --> 56:48.600
 So again, I want to be very, very clear

56:48.600 --> 56:50.120
 that you need to know your blood pressure.

56:50.120 --> 56:52.820
 If you have high blood pressure or you're pre-hypertensive,

56:52.820 --> 56:55.140
 you should be especially cautious about doing anything

56:55.140 --> 56:57.140
 that increases your blood pressure.

56:57.140 --> 56:58.640
 And as always, you want to, of course,

56:58.640 --> 57:00.180
 talk to your doctor about doing anything

57:00.180 --> 57:02.660
 that could adjust your health in any direction.

57:02.660 --> 57:05.700
 But nonetheless, there are some important papers

57:05.700 --> 57:08.160
 that have been published in recent years.

57:08.160 --> 57:10.100
 I want to point to one of them in particular.

57:10.100 --> 57:12.360
 This is a paper that was published

57:12.360 --> 57:15.960
 in the journal Autonomic Neuroscience, Basic and Clinical,

57:15.960 --> 57:19.440
 because this paper, like several other papers,

57:19.440 --> 57:21.680
 ask the question, and indeed they asked the question

57:21.680 --> 57:24.600
 in the title, it's a review, dietary sodium and health,

57:24.600 --> 57:28.640
 how much is too much for those with orthostatic disorders?

57:28.640 --> 57:30.360
 Now, orthostatic disorders come

57:30.360 --> 57:31.520
 in a bunch of different varieties,

57:31.520 --> 57:33.440
 and we're going to talk about those in a moment,

57:33.440 --> 57:35.240
 but there are a number of people out there

57:35.240 --> 57:37.380
 that have low blood pressure, right?

57:37.380 --> 57:39.960
 People that get dizzy when they stand up,

57:39.960 --> 57:42.800
 people that are feeling chronically fatigued,

57:42.800 --> 57:46.520
 and in some cases, not all, those groups can actually benefit

57:46.520 --> 57:48.640
 from increasing their sodium intake.

57:48.640 --> 57:51.220
 Several episodes ago on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

57:51.220 --> 57:55.000
 I gave it what it's just clearly what we call anecdata,

57:55.000 --> 57:58.260
 which is not even really data, it's just anecdotal data,

57:58.260 --> 58:02.240
 of an individual who was always feeling hungry

58:02.240 --> 58:04.920
 and craving sugar, and based on the fact

58:04.920 --> 58:07.480
 that they also had low blood pressure,

58:07.480 --> 58:10.080
 I had them talk to a physician and they got permission

58:10.080 --> 58:12.960
 to try a little mini experiment on themselves,

58:12.960 --> 58:15.040
 and so they did, and that mini experiment was,

58:15.040 --> 58:17.640
 anytime they felt like they were craving sugar

58:17.640 --> 58:19.400
 or they were feeling a little lightheaded and dizzy,

58:19.400 --> 58:22.120
 rather than reaching for something with caloric intake,

58:22.120 --> 58:23.440
 they took a little bit of sea salt,

58:23.440 --> 58:26.600
 a little pinch of sea salt, and put it into some water

58:26.600 --> 58:29.640
 and drank it, or in the case of this individual,

58:29.640 --> 58:31.240
 they would actually take a little sea salt packet

58:31.240 --> 58:33.080
 and they would actually just down a sea salt packet,

58:33.080 --> 58:35.720
 and for them, that provided tremendous relief

58:35.720 --> 58:38.360
 for their dizziness, but that, of course,

58:38.360 --> 58:41.120
 was in the context of somewhat abnormally

58:41.120 --> 58:44.600
 low blood pressure, so I don't think that they are alone

58:44.600 --> 58:46.840
 in the fact that many people out there suffer

58:46.840 --> 58:50.980
 from a low blood pressure condition, many people out there

58:50.980 --> 58:52.720
 suffer from a high blood pressure condition,

58:52.720 --> 58:54.760
 so know your blood pressure and understand

58:54.760 --> 58:57.720
 that blood pressure in part is regulated

58:57.720 --> 59:01.420
 by your sodium intake and your sodium balance, why?

59:01.420 --> 59:03.840
 Well, because of the osmolarity of blood

59:03.840 --> 59:05.360
 that we talked about before,

59:05.360 --> 59:09.840
 where if you have a certain concentration of sodium,

59:09.840 --> 59:12.140
 meaning sufficient sodium in your bloodstream,

59:12.140 --> 59:13.960
 that will tend to draw water into the bloodstream

59:13.960 --> 59:16.160
 and essentially the pipes that are your capillaries,

59:16.160 --> 59:18.600
 arteries, and veins will be full,

59:18.600 --> 59:20.520
 the blood pressure will get up to your head,

59:20.520 --> 59:22.880
 whereas some people, their blood pressure is low

59:22.880 --> 59:26.040
 because the osmolarity of their blood is low,

59:26.040 --> 59:28.920
 and that can have a number of downstream consequences,

59:28.920 --> 59:32.360
 I should also mention it can be the consequence itself

59:32.360 --> 59:37.120
 of challenges or even deficits in kidney function,

59:37.120 --> 59:39.320
 but all of these organs are working together,

59:39.320 --> 59:41.880
 so the encouragement here is not necessarily

59:41.880 --> 59:44.200
 to ingest more sodium, it's to know your blood pressure

59:44.200 --> 59:47.840
 and to address whether or not an increase in sodium intake

59:47.840 --> 59:50.080
 would actually benefit your blood pressure

59:50.080 --> 59:52.680
 in a way that could relieve some of the dizziness

59:52.680 --> 59:56.540
 and other symptoms of things like orthostatic disorders,

59:57.720 --> 59:59.780
 but of course, to do that in a safe context

59:59.780 --> 1:00:01.920
 and to never play games with your blood sugar

1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:04.320
 or your blood osmolarity that could set your system

1:00:04.320 --> 1:00:06.180
 down a cascade of negative events,

1:00:07.140 --> 1:00:09.960
 let's look at what the current recommendations are

1:00:09.960 --> 1:00:12.960
 for people that suffer from orthostatic disorders

1:00:12.960 --> 1:00:15.960
 like orthostatic hypo, meaning too low tension,

1:00:15.960 --> 1:00:19.240
 orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome,

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:23.220
 sometimes referred to as POTS, P-O-T-S,

1:00:23.220 --> 1:00:26.800
 or idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and SYNCOPE,

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:29.040
 these have the incredibly elaborate names,

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:33.200
 those groups are often told to increase their salt intake

1:00:33.200 --> 1:00:34.700
 in order to combat their symptoms,

1:00:34.700 --> 1:00:37.560
 the American Society of Hypertension recommends

1:00:38.640 --> 1:00:42.480
 anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000, these are very high levels,

1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:45.820
 so this is six grams to 10 grams of salt per day,

1:00:45.820 --> 1:00:50.820
 keeping in mind, again, that salt is not the same as sodium,

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:54.560
 so that equates to about 2,400 to 4,000 milligrams

1:00:54.560 --> 1:00:57.300
 of sodium per day, again, if you want to learn more

1:00:57.300 --> 1:00:59.160
 about this and get more of the citations,

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:02.140
 I'll refer you back to this study on dietary sodium

1:01:02.140 --> 1:01:03.320
 and health, how much is too much

1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:04.640
 for those with orthostatic disorders,

1:01:04.640 --> 1:01:07.720
 we will put a link to this in the caption show notes,

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:11.660
 so that's not just in the US, the salt recommendations

1:01:11.660 --> 1:01:13.680
 from the Canadian Cardiovascular Society

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:15.980
 are 10,000 milligrams of salt per day,

1:01:15.980 --> 1:01:19.120
 so four grams of sodium is what that equates to,

1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:22.480
 and on and on and on for things like POTS

1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:25.280
 for these postural syndromes that result from,

1:01:25.280 --> 1:01:27.080
 or I should say from the syndromes

1:01:27.080 --> 1:01:29.080
 that involve low blood pressure

1:01:29.080 --> 1:01:31.520
 when people stand up or in certain postures,

1:01:31.520 --> 1:01:33.800
 so I point out this paper

1:01:33.800 --> 1:01:36.800
 and I point out these higher salt recommendations

1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:40.800
 to emphasize, again, that context is vital, right,

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:42.200
 that people with high blood pressure

1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:44.880
 are going to need certain amounts of salt intake,

1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:47.280
 people with lower blood pressure

1:01:47.280 --> 1:01:50.720
 and maybe with some of these postural orthostatic syndromes

1:01:50.720 --> 1:01:53.120
 are going to need higher amounts of salt,

1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:55.660
 and for most people out there,

1:01:55.660 --> 1:01:58.180
 you're going to need to evaluate how much salt intake

1:01:58.180 --> 1:02:00.960
 is going to allow your brain and body to function optimally,

1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:03.640
 and there are some fairly straightforward ways

1:02:03.640 --> 1:02:06.220
 to explore that, and there's some ways to explore that

1:02:06.220 --> 1:02:08.200
 in the context of what you already know

1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:10.680
 about thirst and salt appetite

1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:12.560
 that can make that exploration

1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:14.720
 one in which it's not going to be a constant

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:16.000
 wandering around in the dark

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.240
 and where you can figure out what's right for you.

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:21.520
 For most people, a moderate increase in salt intake

1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:23.040
 is not going to be detrimental

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:26.280
 provided that you consume enough fluids,

1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:28.800
 in particular, water, okay,

1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:31.120
 meaning if you happen to overeat salt a bit,

1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:34.440
 you will get thirsty, you will ingest more water,

1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:36.400
 and you will excrete the excess sodium.

1:02:37.900 --> 1:02:40.600
 There is evidence that the body can store sodium

1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:42.520
 in various organs.

1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:45.680
 That storage of sodium may or may not be

1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:47.280
 a detrimental thing.

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:49.680
 In general, excess storage of sodium

1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:51.880
 in tissues and organs of the brain and body

1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:55.740
 is not thought to be good for long-term health,

1:02:55.740 --> 1:02:58.960
 so eating much more sodium than you need

1:02:58.960 --> 1:03:01.720
 for long periods of time is indeed bad for you.

1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:06.240
 Earlier, I mentioned that salt

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:08.680
 and your hunger and thirst for salt

1:03:08.680 --> 1:03:11.000
 is homeostatically regulated,

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:11.920
 and indeed, that's the case,

1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:15.000
 much like temperature is homeostatically regulated.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:19.360
 What that means is if you pay attention to it,

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:21.880
 if your salt levels are low,

1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:23.720
 you will tend to crave salt

1:03:23.720 --> 1:03:26.140
 and salty beverages and salty foods,

1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:30.700
 and in most cases, you should probably follow that craving

1:03:30.700 --> 1:03:33.040
 provided those salty beverages and salty foods

1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:36.160
 are not bringing in a lot of other things

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:38.860
 or anything, ideally, that's bad for you,

1:03:38.860 --> 1:03:40.840
 so I think it's fair to say

1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:42.960
 that whether or not you're vegan, vegetarian,

1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:44.600
 carnivore, omnivore,

1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:48.520
 that we should all try to limit

1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.360
 our ingestion of processed foods.

1:03:51.520 --> 1:03:53.920
 My read of the literature is that, sure,

1:03:53.920 --> 1:03:56.680
 some processed foods are acceptable for us

1:03:56.680 --> 1:03:58.700
 and aren't going to kill us outright,

1:03:58.700 --> 1:04:00.820
 but that for most people in the world,

1:04:00.820 --> 1:04:02.340
 eating fewer processed foods

1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:04.760
 is just going to be a good thing to do,

1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:09.760
 so following your salt hunger and thirst, in most cases,

1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:12.120
 is going to be beneficial

1:04:12.120 --> 1:04:14.400
 provided that it's in the context

1:04:14.400 --> 1:04:17.400
 of eating healthy non-processed foods

1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:19.360
 on whatever backdrop of nutritional

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:21.160
 and dietary recommendations is right for you.

1:04:21.160 --> 1:04:24.600
 I simply can't tell you what to eat and what not to eat

1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:29.600
 because I acknowledge the fact that some people are vegans

1:04:29.600 --> 1:04:33.240
 because of ethical reasons related to animals,

1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:34.760
 or some people are vegans

1:04:34.760 --> 1:04:38.960
 because of reasons related to the climate

1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:40.040
 and the environment.

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:43.740
 Other people do it for specific health reasons.

1:04:43.740 --> 1:04:46.680
 Likewise, I know plenty of people that eat meat

1:04:46.680 --> 1:04:48.360
 and avoid vegetables, believe it or not,

1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:49.800
 and I know people that eat both,

1:04:49.800 --> 1:04:53.000
 and they do this often each, I should say,

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.080
 all citing literature that supports their particular camp

1:04:56.080 --> 1:04:57.360
 and their particular view.

1:04:57.360 --> 1:04:59.880
 It's not a territory I want to get into,

1:04:59.880 --> 1:05:01.560
 but with respect to salt intake

1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:05.760
 and the fact that salt intake is homeostatically regulated,

1:05:06.800 --> 1:05:09.080
 it is the case that if you're craving salt,

1:05:09.080 --> 1:05:10.780
 you probably need it.

1:05:10.780 --> 1:05:13.060
 So for those of you that are sweating excessively,

1:05:13.060 --> 1:05:16.360
 or even if you're in a very hot environment

1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:19.420
 and you're not exercising and you're just losing,

1:05:19.420 --> 1:05:22.080
 you're losing water and salt from your system,

1:05:22.080 --> 1:05:24.580
 remember also that you can be in a very cold environment,

1:05:24.580 --> 1:05:27.720
 very cold, dry environments often go together,

1:05:27.720 --> 1:05:30.240
 and you can be losing a lot of fluids from your body

1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:32.880
 and you will crave fluids and salt even though it's cold

1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:36.840
 and you're not actually noticeably perspiring.

1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:38.480
 So if you're exercising a lot,

1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:40.840
 if you're in a particular cold, dry environment

1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:42.500
 or a particular hot environment,

1:05:42.500 --> 1:05:44.840
 you ought to be ingesting sufficient amounts

1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:46.480
 of salt and fluid.

1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:51.000
 A rule of thumb for exercise-based replenishment of fluid

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000
 comes from what I, some episodes back,

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.700
 referred to as the Galpin equation.

1:05:56.700 --> 1:06:00.420
 The Galpin equation, I named it after Andy Galpin,

1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:03.920
 and I think that is the appropriate attribution there.

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:06.560
 Andy Galpin is an exercise physiologist

1:06:06.560 --> 1:06:09.520
 at Cal State Fullerton, I believe,

1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:11.800
 and he's going to be a podcast guest

1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:13.160
 here on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:15.040
 He's an exceptional muscle physiologist.

1:06:15.040 --> 1:06:16.980
 He also lives in the practical realm

1:06:16.980 --> 1:06:20.760
 where he gives recommendations about exercise

1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:24.280
 to expert athletes, as well as the everyday person.

1:06:24.280 --> 1:06:26.400
 So the Galpin equation is based on the fact

1:06:26.400 --> 1:06:31.080
 that we lose about one to five pounds of water per hour,

1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:34.080
 which can definitely impact our mental capacity

1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:35.940
 and our physical performance.

1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:39.600
 And the reason that loss of water from our system

1:06:39.600 --> 1:06:41.800
 impacts mental capacity and physical performance

1:06:41.800 --> 1:06:45.200
 has a lot to do with literally the changes

1:06:45.200 --> 1:06:47.900
 in the volume of those cells, the size of those cells,

1:06:47.900 --> 1:06:49.440
 based on how much sodium is contained

1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:50.840
 in or outside those cells,

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:53.640
 and something that I've alluded to before on the podcast

1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:55.720
 and I'll talk about more in a moment,

1:06:55.720 --> 1:06:59.080
 which is that neurons signal to one another

1:06:59.080 --> 1:07:00.640
 by way of electricity

1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:02.140
 through something called the action potential,

1:07:02.140 --> 1:07:04.880
 and that actually requires sodium and potassium

1:07:04.880 --> 1:07:06.040
 and magnesium.

1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:07.560
 So the Galpin equation suggests

1:07:07.560 --> 1:07:10.680
 that we start exercise hydrated with electrolytes,

1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:12.240
 not just with water.

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:15.720
 So that means water that has some sodium,

1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:18.200
 potassium, and magnesium.

1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:21.440
 There are simple low cost ways to do that we'll talk about.

1:07:21.440 --> 1:07:23.880
 And the formula for hydration,

1:07:23.880 --> 1:07:27.960
 the so-called Galpin equation is your body weight in pounds

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:31.640
 divided by 30 equals the ounces of fluid

1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:34.180
 you should drink every 15 minutes.

1:07:34.180 --> 1:07:36.320
 That may turn out to be more fluid

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:37.920
 than you can comfortably consume

1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:39.880
 during the activity that you're performing.

1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:44.880
 Now, the Galpin equation is mainly designed for exercise,

1:07:45.280 --> 1:07:49.060
 but I think is actually a very good rule of thumb

1:07:49.060 --> 1:07:52.240
 for any time that you need to engage mental capacity,

1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:53.840
 not just physical performance.

1:07:55.540 --> 1:07:57.680
 Your body weight in pounds divided by 30

1:07:57.680 --> 1:08:00.920
 equals the ounces of fluid you should drink every 15 minutes

1:08:00.920 --> 1:08:03.440
 does not necessarily mean you have to ingest it

1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:06.220
 every 15 minutes on the dot.

1:08:06.220 --> 1:08:10.440
 And I think many activities, physical activities,

1:08:10.440 --> 1:08:14.600
 but also cognitive activities like Zoom meetings

1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:19.600
 or in-person meetings or lecturing or running or cycling

1:08:19.600 --> 1:08:23.320
 are going to make it complicated

1:08:23.320 --> 1:08:25.640
 to ingest the appropriate amount of fluid

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:27.860
 every 15 minutes on the dot.

1:08:27.860 --> 1:08:30.760
 I'm not going to speak for Andy, for Dr. Galpin,

1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:32.720
 but I think he would probably agree

1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:35.960
 that these are averages to shoot for

1:08:35.960 --> 1:08:38.680
 and that unless you're hyper neurotic,

1:08:38.680 --> 1:08:42.000
 the idea is to make sure that you're entering the activity,

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:46.120
 cognitive or physical, sufficiently hydrated,

1:08:46.120 --> 1:08:47.660
 and that throughout that activity,

1:08:47.660 --> 1:08:48.800
 you're hydrating regularly.

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:50.120
 And it points to the fact

1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:53.140
 that most people are probably under hydrating,

1:08:53.140 --> 1:08:55.040
 but not just under hydrating

1:08:55.040 --> 1:08:58.000
 from the perspective of not ingesting enough water,

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.440
 that they're probably not getting enough electrolytes

1:09:00.440 --> 1:09:03.440
 as well, sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:05.780
 So I've said two somewhat contradictory things.

1:09:05.780 --> 1:09:10.000
 On the one hand, I said, follow your salt appetite,

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.000
 follow your salt thirst.

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.860
 If you're craving salt,

1:09:12.860 --> 1:09:16.260
 ingest some salt until you stop craving the salt.

1:09:16.260 --> 1:09:19.120
 On the other hand, I've given you this

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:23.720
 fairly specific recommendation based on the Galpin equation

1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:25.760
 that you should ingest your body weight in pounds

1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:28.040
 divided by 30, that's how many ounces of fluid

1:09:28.040 --> 1:09:29.680
 you should drink every 15 minutes,

1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:32.020
 which I'm guessing for most people is going to be more fluid

1:09:32.020 --> 1:09:34.380
 than they're currently drinking on average.

1:09:34.380 --> 1:09:37.020
 And so how could it be that you can have a recommendation

1:09:37.020 --> 1:09:38.980
 for what's optimal that's different

1:09:38.980 --> 1:09:42.080
 than the amount that you would reflexively drink?

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.420
 And it has to do with the fact

1:09:43.420 --> 1:09:46.880
 that a lot of the hormone systems like vasopressin,

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:50.180
 antidiuretic hormone, other hormones like aldosterone,

1:09:50.180 --> 1:09:53.520
 and a lot of the neural and hormonal signals

1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:55.720
 that govern salt and water balance

1:09:55.720 --> 1:09:58.020
 are fairly slow to kick in.

1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:01.520
 So for instance, if you eat a fairly salty meal

1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:04.060
 and you sense that salt, you'll probably,

1:10:04.060 --> 1:10:05.880
 meaning you detect it and perceive it,

1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:07.460
 because the food tastes salty,

1:10:07.460 --> 1:10:09.060
 you'll probably want to drink

1:10:09.060 --> 1:10:10.520
 a fair amount of fluid with it.

1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:13.700
 Whereas if some of the salt is disguised by other flavors,

1:10:13.700 --> 1:10:15.060
 something that we'll talk about in a few minutes

1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:17.300
 when we talk about the neural representation

1:10:17.300 --> 1:10:20.220
 of things like salty and sweet,

1:10:20.220 --> 1:10:22.660
 well, then you might not notice that something's salty,

1:10:22.660 --> 1:10:26.220
 and then a few minutes or hours after ingesting that meal,

1:10:26.220 --> 1:10:27.780
 you might feel very, very tired.

1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:29.980
 You might even wonder whether or not

1:10:29.980 --> 1:10:32.500
 it's because of some blood sugar effect.

1:10:32.500 --> 1:10:35.020
 Maybe it's a crash in blood sugar, you might think,

1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:36.660
 or something else related to that meal,

1:10:36.660 --> 1:10:38.460
 or maybe you think it's because of

1:10:38.460 --> 1:10:39.820
 some other event in your life,

1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:43.040
 but actually what has happened is you're dehydrated

1:10:43.040 --> 1:10:44.180
 because you didn't recognize

1:10:44.180 --> 1:10:46.060
 that you needed to drink more fluids.

1:10:46.060 --> 1:10:50.080
 So I want to acknowledge the contradiction

1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:52.760
 in the idea that everything is homostatically regulated,

1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:55.780
 and therefore you are aware of what you need,

1:10:55.780 --> 1:10:58.740
 and the counterargument that ah,

1:10:58.740 --> 1:11:00.440
 you need to follow these strict recommendations,

1:11:00.440 --> 1:11:02.560
 it's actually going to be somewhere in between.

1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:04.560
 And of course, your body and brain can start to adapt

1:11:04.560 --> 1:11:06.420
 to certain levels of salt intake.

1:11:06.420 --> 1:11:11.420
 There's a now fairly famous study that was done in Germany,

1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:16.800
 which looked at different phases of salt intake,

1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:19.860
 meaning they had subjects ingest

1:11:19.860 --> 1:11:22.560
 either 12 grams of salt per day or nine grams per day

1:11:22.560 --> 1:11:26.220
 or six grams per day for fairly long periods of time,

1:11:26.220 --> 1:11:28.380
 and they collected urine for testing.

1:11:28.380 --> 1:11:30.180
 This was actually a very controlled study.

1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:31.220
 I'm just going to paraphrase

1:11:31.220 --> 1:11:35.220
 from the National Institutes of Health report on this study

1:11:35.220 --> 1:11:37.940
 because they did a very nice writeup of it.

1:11:37.940 --> 1:11:41.380
 And they say that a big surprise of these results

1:11:41.380 --> 1:11:44.420
 is that whatever the level of salt that was consumed,

1:11:44.420 --> 1:11:48.620
 sodium was stored and released from the subjects bodies

1:11:48.620 --> 1:11:52.420
 in fairly regular weekly and monthly patterns,

1:11:52.420 --> 1:11:53.860
 meaning people tended to adapt

1:11:53.860 --> 1:11:55.820
 to a certain level of salt intake,

1:11:55.820 --> 1:11:59.300
 and then it led to a fairly constant amount

1:11:59.300 --> 1:12:03.340
 of salt retention and urine fluid excretion.

1:12:03.340 --> 1:12:06.660
 And that's because of the various hormones like aldosterone,

1:12:06.660 --> 1:12:08.700
 which regulates sodium excretion from the kidney

1:12:08.700 --> 1:12:09.940
 and glucocorticoids,

1:12:09.940 --> 1:12:11.400
 which we'll talk about more in a moment,

1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:13.020
 which help regulate metabolism.

1:12:13.020 --> 1:12:16.000
 Glucocorticoids are released from the adrenal glands,

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:17.780
 which ride the top of the kidneys.

1:12:17.780 --> 1:12:19.340
 And there's a very close relationship

1:12:19.340 --> 1:12:22.060
 between the stress system, glucocorticoids,

1:12:22.060 --> 1:12:23.640
 and the salt system.

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:27.360
 So the reason why your salt appetite

1:12:27.360 --> 1:12:30.700
 isn't a perfect readout of how much salt you should ingest

1:12:30.700 --> 1:12:31.740
 and why it might be helpful

1:12:31.740 --> 1:12:34.220
 to follow some of these formulas like the Galpin equation,

1:12:34.220 --> 1:12:36.960
 especially if you're engaging in exercise,

1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:39.540
 where you're going to be perspiring, of course,

1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:41.860
 is that your body will tend to adapt

1:12:41.860 --> 1:12:43.660
 to a certain amount of salt intake over time,

1:12:43.660 --> 1:12:45.160
 and then your appetite for salt

1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:47.500
 won't necessarily be the best indication

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:50.180
 of how much salt you should ingest or avoid.

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:55.360
 Before I move on, I want to really reemphasize the fact

1:12:55.360 --> 1:12:57.780
 that inside of the Galpin equation,

1:12:57.780 --> 1:13:00.280
 there is that mention of every 15 minutes,

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:02.580
 and people have come back to me again and again

1:13:02.580 --> 1:13:03.420
 about this saying,

1:13:03.420 --> 1:13:05.300
 I can't drink that much water every 15 minutes.

1:13:05.300 --> 1:13:08.180
 It's too much volume of fluid in my stomach.

1:13:08.180 --> 1:13:09.380
 I can't run with that, et cetera.

1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:11.740
 Remember, these are averages.

1:13:11.740 --> 1:13:13.280
 So that's what you want to average

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:14.620
 around a particular activity.

1:13:14.620 --> 1:13:16.040
 These are not strict recommendations

1:13:16.040 --> 1:13:17.780
 where a buzzer goes off and every 15 minutes,

1:13:17.780 --> 1:13:19.460
 you have to chug that exact amount

1:13:19.460 --> 1:13:21.300
 of electrolyte-containing solution.

1:13:21.300 --> 1:13:23.540
 Another key feature of the study

1:13:24.540 --> 1:13:26.020
 that I was referring to before,

1:13:26.020 --> 1:13:27.340
 which incidentally was published

1:13:27.340 --> 1:13:29.360
 in the Journal of Clinical Investigation,

1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:32.820
 is that the body regulates its salt and water balance

1:13:32.820 --> 1:13:35.560
 not just by excreting sodium,

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:38.140
 but by retaining or releasing water.

1:13:38.140 --> 1:13:39.460
 And this is because of the relationship

1:13:39.460 --> 1:13:42.180
 between sodium and water that we were talking about before.

1:13:42.180 --> 1:13:44.620
 And the advantage of this mechanism they state,

1:13:44.620 --> 1:13:45.800
 here I'm paraphrasing,

1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:48.220
 is that the long-term maintenance of body fluids

1:13:48.220 --> 1:13:53.180
 is not as dependent on external water as once believed.

1:13:53.180 --> 1:13:55.520
 What the system probably evolved to do

1:13:55.520 --> 1:13:58.420
 was to adjust to different levels of sodium availability

1:13:58.420 --> 1:13:59.620
 in the environment.

1:13:59.620 --> 1:14:04.060
 And that raises a really key element of salt

1:14:04.060 --> 1:14:06.280
 and its importance in human history

1:14:06.280 --> 1:14:08.400
 and human evolution and human health.

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:09.600
 We haven't talked too much about this,

1:14:09.600 --> 1:14:12.280
 and there are several very good books

1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:13.540
 about the history of salt.

1:14:13.540 --> 1:14:17.180
 You know, salt was a very valuable

1:14:17.180 --> 1:14:19.620
 and heavily sought-after substance

1:14:19.620 --> 1:14:21.600
 throughout much of human history,

1:14:21.600 --> 1:14:24.840
 so much so that there are actually written reports

1:14:24.840 --> 1:14:28.680
 of people being paid for labor in the form of salt.

1:14:28.680 --> 1:14:32.280
 And, you know, salt, when it's scarce,

1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:34.940
 has been quite expensive in certain regions of the world,

1:14:34.940 --> 1:14:38.420
 especially regions located further away from the sea.

1:14:38.420 --> 1:14:41.320
 And a friend of mine who has deep roots

1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:44.940
 within the culinary community told me about traveling

1:14:44.940 --> 1:14:49.420
 to some somewhat impoverished areas of Europe

1:14:49.420 --> 1:14:52.460
 some years ago and going into homes

1:14:52.460 --> 1:14:55.540
 where in the middle of the kitchen table,

1:14:55.540 --> 1:14:57.860
 there was a fish, a salty fish,

1:14:57.860 --> 1:15:01.980
 hanging from a thread above the table.

1:15:01.980 --> 1:15:05.400
 And that because of a lack of availability of table salt,

1:15:05.400 --> 1:15:07.820
 the common practice was to take any food

1:15:07.820 --> 1:15:10.060
 that needed some salt for additional flavoring

1:15:10.060 --> 1:15:13.200
 and to actually rub that food on this salty fish

1:15:13.200 --> 1:15:17.420
 or to squeeze the fish a bit onto the food substance

1:15:17.420 --> 1:15:19.200
 in order to get salt from it.

1:15:19.200 --> 1:15:22.660
 So, you know, that's a very kind of extreme example.

1:15:22.660 --> 1:15:24.500
 Nowadays, we kind of take salt for granted

1:15:24.500 --> 1:15:27.620
 and most of the discussion out there is about excess salt.

1:15:27.620 --> 1:15:29.900
 But as I'm pointing out that, you know,

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:34.440
 salt for a long time has been a very sought-after commodity

1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:37.140
 and one that people really cherished for their health.

1:15:38.180 --> 1:15:40.640
 In the episode that I did on metabolism,

1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:43.320
 I talked about the relationship between salt and iodine.

1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:44.980
 If you're interested in iodine

1:15:44.980 --> 1:15:47.400
 and whether or not iodized salt or non-iodized salt

1:15:47.400 --> 1:15:49.500
 is best or required,

1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:51.300
 I'd encourage you to listen to that episode,

1:15:51.300 --> 1:15:53.620
 which was about, again, metabolism.

1:15:53.620 --> 1:15:55.960
 Some people may need more iodine intake.

1:15:55.960 --> 1:15:57.340
 Some people perhaps do not.

1:15:57.340 --> 1:15:59.640
 Some people might even want to ingest things like kelp.

1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:00.940
 Some people might not.

1:16:00.940 --> 1:16:02.540
 So please listen to that episode

1:16:02.540 --> 1:16:05.020
 if you're interested in the iodine aspects of salt,

1:16:05.020 --> 1:16:07.820
 which have direct impact on thyroid hormone

1:16:07.820 --> 1:16:10.820
 and thyroid function, which of course relates to metabolism.

1:16:11.820 --> 1:16:13.700
 Nowadays, there's a lot of interest in

1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:15.540
 and even a kind of proliferation

1:16:15.540 --> 1:16:17.140
 of what I call fancy salts.

1:16:17.140 --> 1:16:19.280
 So whether or not you should be ingesting sea salts

1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:23.600
 or whether or not common table salt will suffice.

1:16:23.600 --> 1:16:26.280
 In most cases, for what we're discussing here,

1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:28.580
 common table salt is fine,

1:16:28.580 --> 1:16:30.460
 but I should point out that sea salt

1:16:30.460 --> 1:16:33.300
 often contains other minerals, which can be very useful,

1:16:33.300 --> 1:16:35.720
 and we will do entire episodes on those other minerals.

1:16:35.720 --> 1:16:38.820
 So sea salt can contain, you know,

1:16:38.820 --> 1:16:40.620
 dozens or more of minerals,

1:16:40.620 --> 1:16:43.680
 some of which can be quite valuable to our health,

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:45.980
 others of which are less important

1:16:45.980 --> 1:16:47.980
 and only need to be consumed in trace amounts,

1:16:47.980 --> 1:16:50.740
 but you're not going to get many minerals, if any,

1:16:50.740 --> 1:16:52.300
 from common table salt,

1:16:52.300 --> 1:16:55.220
 and that's why in addition to the pretty colors

1:16:55.220 --> 1:16:57.020
 and perhaps some people report

1:16:57.020 --> 1:16:59.060
 that they actually taste better,

1:16:59.060 --> 1:17:01.920
 some of these so-called fancy salts or sea salts,

1:17:01.920 --> 1:17:05.420
 you might want to consume a more advanced form of salt,

1:17:05.420 --> 1:17:06.260
 if you will.

1:17:06.260 --> 1:17:07.260
 Although I suppose it's actually

1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:08.580
 the more primitive form of salt

1:17:08.580 --> 1:17:10.580
 if it's actually the one that comes from the ocean.

1:17:10.580 --> 1:17:12.500
 So we've all heard about how excess salt,

1:17:12.500 --> 1:17:14.160
 it's bad for blood pressure,

1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:16.400
 damage the heart, the brain, et cetera.

1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:19.620
 I do want to give some voice to situations

1:17:19.620 --> 1:17:22.860
 where too little salt can actually cause problems,

1:17:22.860 --> 1:17:25.500
 and this has everything to do with the nervous system.

1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:28.660
 So without getting into excessive amounts of detail,

1:17:28.660 --> 1:17:32.060
 the kidneys, as we talked about before,

1:17:32.060 --> 1:17:34.760
 are going to regulate salt and fluid balance.

1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:38.360
 The adrenal glands, which ride atop the kidneys,

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:41.180
 are going to make glucocorticoids like aldosterone,

1:17:41.180 --> 1:17:43.320
 and those are going to directly impact

1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:45.860
 things like fluid balance.

1:17:45.860 --> 1:17:48.700
 And in part, they do that by regulating

1:17:48.700 --> 1:17:51.420
 how much craving for and tolerance

1:17:51.420 --> 1:17:54.540
 of salty solutions we have.

1:17:54.540 --> 1:17:56.580
 And there's some really nice studies

1:17:56.580 --> 1:17:59.380
 that have looked at so-called adrenalectomies.

1:17:59.380 --> 1:18:00.820
 Now, this is an extreme case,

1:18:00.820 --> 1:18:02.820
 and it's typically done in animal models,

1:18:02.820 --> 1:18:05.820
 but it illustrates the role of the adrenals

1:18:05.820 --> 1:18:08.040
 in salt preference.

1:18:08.040 --> 1:18:11.660
 Basically, when the glucocorticoid system,

1:18:11.660 --> 1:18:14.080
 meaning the release of these particular hormones

1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:15.580
 from the adrenal glands,

1:18:15.580 --> 1:18:18.340
 is eliminated by adrenalectomy,

1:18:18.340 --> 1:18:20.100
 ectomy means removal,

1:18:20.100 --> 1:18:23.060
 then the threshold for what's considered too salty

1:18:23.060 --> 1:18:24.820
 really shifts, okay?

1:18:24.820 --> 1:18:29.220
 So typically, when the adrenals are intact,

1:18:29.220 --> 1:18:34.180
 a animal or a human will prefer a mildly salty

1:18:34.180 --> 1:18:37.900
 to moderately salty solution if given a choice.

1:18:37.900 --> 1:18:39.620
 And at some point, it's so salty

1:18:39.620 --> 1:18:40.980
 that it just feels aversive.

1:18:40.980 --> 1:18:42.740
 Just like taking a gulp of seawater

1:18:42.740 --> 1:18:44.160
 is almost always aversive.

1:18:44.160 --> 1:18:46.280
 I can't think of an instance where it's not aversive,

1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:47.900
 and actually drinking seawater can kill you

1:18:47.900 --> 1:18:51.020
 because of the high osmolarity of seawater.

1:18:51.020 --> 1:18:53.720
 You certainly don't want to drink seawater.

1:18:53.720 --> 1:18:56.420
 Under conditions where the adrenals are missing,

1:18:58.240 --> 1:19:00.820
 animals and humans will tend to prefer

1:19:00.820 --> 1:19:04.060
 a higher sodium concentration fluid,

1:19:04.060 --> 1:19:06.660
 and they will be willing to tolerate ingesting

1:19:06.660 --> 1:19:08.900
 very high concentrations of sodium.

1:19:08.900 --> 1:19:10.640
 Now, that's a very crude experiment

1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:13.900
 and not one that you want to do, I promise you.

1:19:13.900 --> 1:19:17.100
 But I mention it because it illustrates

1:19:17.100 --> 1:19:20.740
 the very direct relationship between the stress system,

1:19:20.740 --> 1:19:22.740
 which is the glucocorticoid system,

1:19:22.740 --> 1:19:25.180
 and the salt craving system.

1:19:25.180 --> 1:19:26.860
 And this actually makes sense.

1:19:26.860 --> 1:19:29.020
 Earlier, as we were talking about hypovolemic thirst,

1:19:29.020 --> 1:19:32.080
 when there's a loss of blood pressure from,

1:19:32.080 --> 1:19:34.420
 usually due to a loss of blood from the body,

1:19:34.420 --> 1:19:35.900
 there's a salt craving in order

1:19:35.900 --> 1:19:37.420
 to bring that blood volume back up,

1:19:37.420 --> 1:19:38.900
 because by ingesting salt,

1:19:38.900 --> 1:19:41.020
 you bring fluid into the bloodstream,

1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:42.460
 you're increasing that blood pressure

1:19:42.460 --> 1:19:44.800
 and you can restore the blood that's lost.

1:19:44.800 --> 1:19:47.900
 Now, there are many examples where if sodium levels

1:19:47.900 --> 1:19:50.660
 get too low in the bloodstream,

1:19:50.660 --> 1:19:54.020
 either because people are ingesting too little salt

1:19:54.020 --> 1:19:56.360
 or they are ingesting too much water

1:19:56.360 --> 1:19:59.020
 and therefore excreting too much salt,

1:19:59.020 --> 1:20:02.500
 that it can cause stress and anxiety.

1:20:02.500 --> 1:20:04.460
 There's some really nice data that point to the fact

1:20:04.460 --> 1:20:09.220
 that low dietary sodium can actually exacerbate anxiety

1:20:09.220 --> 1:20:10.740
 in animal models.

1:20:10.740 --> 1:20:12.140
 And to some extent,

1:20:12.140 --> 1:20:14.700
 there's evidence for this in humans as well.

1:20:14.700 --> 1:20:16.780
 And that should not come as a surprise.

1:20:17.740 --> 1:20:20.200
 The whole basis for a relationship

1:20:20.200 --> 1:20:22.660
 between the adrenal system, these glucocorticoids,

1:20:22.660 --> 1:20:25.780
 things like aldosterone, and the craving for sodium,

1:20:25.780 --> 1:20:29.920
 is that the stress system is a generic system

1:20:29.920 --> 1:20:33.860
 designed to deal with various challenges to the organism,

1:20:33.860 --> 1:20:36.320
 to you or to me or to an animal.

1:20:36.320 --> 1:20:39.920
 And those challenges can arrive in many different forms.

1:20:41.060 --> 1:20:43.280
 They can be an infection, it can be famine,

1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:45.500
 it can be lack of water and so on.

1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:48.900
 But in general, the stress response

1:20:48.900 --> 1:20:52.020
 is one of elevated heart rate, elevated blood pressure,

1:20:52.020 --> 1:20:54.260
 and an ability to maintain movement

1:20:54.260 --> 1:20:57.060
 and resistance to that challenge, okay?

1:20:57.060 --> 1:21:00.140
 I've said this before, but I'll emphasize it again.

1:21:00.140 --> 1:21:03.140
 There's this common misperception that stress makes us sick.

1:21:03.140 --> 1:21:05.220
 And indeed, if stress lasts too long,

1:21:05.220 --> 1:21:08.100
 it has a number of negative effects on our health.

1:21:08.100 --> 1:21:12.340
 But more often than not, if we're pushing, pushing, pushing,

1:21:12.340 --> 1:21:14.080
 we're studying or taking care of somebody

1:21:14.080 --> 1:21:16.080
 or traveling like crazy,

1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:18.620
 we don't tend to get sick under those conditions.

1:21:18.620 --> 1:21:20.820
 But as soon as we stop,

1:21:20.820 --> 1:21:22.940
 as soon as we reduce our adrenaline output,

1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:25.700
 as soon as we reduce our glucocorticoid output

1:21:25.700 --> 1:21:28.080
 from our adrenals, then we will get sick.

1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:29.620
 That's a very common occurrence.

1:21:29.620 --> 1:21:33.300
 And it's because stress actually activates our immune system

1:21:33.300 --> 1:21:34.460
 in the short term.

1:21:34.460 --> 1:21:36.920
 So I'd like to try and dispel this myth

1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:39.420
 that stress actually suppresses the immune system,

1:21:39.420 --> 1:21:40.900
 at least not in the short term.

1:21:40.900 --> 1:21:43.100
 For long-term stress, it's a different issue.

1:21:43.100 --> 1:21:45.300
 You don't want long-term ongoing stress,

1:21:45.300 --> 1:21:47.100
 especially if several weeks or more.

1:21:48.900 --> 1:21:52.640
 Nonetheless, it makes sense that bringing sodium

1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:55.660
 into the body would be at least one way

1:21:55.660 --> 1:21:57.860
 that we would be wired to counteract

1:21:57.860 --> 1:22:01.060
 or to resist stressors, right?

1:22:01.060 --> 1:22:04.240
 Stressors being the things on the outside coming at us.

1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:05.820
 So it could be stressful relationships,

1:22:05.820 --> 1:22:09.560
 stressful job situation, and again, infection and so on.

1:22:11.420 --> 1:22:12.860
 It's clear from a number of studies

1:22:12.860 --> 1:22:15.800
 that if sodium levels are too low,

1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:19.560
 that our ability to meet stress challenges is impaired.

1:22:19.560 --> 1:22:20.380
 Now, that doesn't mean

1:22:20.380 --> 1:22:23.880
 to place your sodium intake cosmically high,

1:22:23.880 --> 1:22:27.580
 but it does point to the fact that if you're feeling anxious,

1:22:27.580 --> 1:22:29.280
 perhaps from low blood pressure,

1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:31.020
 which can also give symptoms of anxiety,

1:22:31.020 --> 1:22:32.300
 as we talked about before,

1:22:32.300 --> 1:22:35.560
 but even if it's independent of low blood pressure,

1:22:35.560 --> 1:22:38.540
 that slightly increasing sodium intake,

1:22:38.540 --> 1:22:40.580
 again, I would encourage people to do this

1:22:40.580 --> 1:22:42.780
 not in the context of processed foods and drinks,

1:22:42.780 --> 1:22:44.840
 but ideally in the form of maybe a little bit

1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:47.300
 of sea salt and water or salting one's food

1:22:47.300 --> 1:22:51.980
 a little bit more, that that can stabilize blood pressure

1:22:51.980 --> 1:22:55.420
 and one's ability to lean into stressors and challenges.

1:22:55.420 --> 1:22:58.380
 And I say this because I think that most people assume

1:22:58.380 --> 1:23:00.980
 that adding salt is always bad,

1:23:00.980 --> 1:23:03.540
 when in fact that's simply not the case.

1:23:03.540 --> 1:23:05.260
 There are conditions such as

1:23:05.260 --> 1:23:06.860
 when we are under stress challenge,

1:23:06.860 --> 1:23:10.060
 when there is a natural craving for more sodium,

1:23:10.060 --> 1:23:12.260
 and that natural craving for more sodium

1:23:12.260 --> 1:23:16.100
 is hardwired into us as a way to meet that challenge.

1:23:16.100 --> 1:23:19.260
 So it's hard for me to know whether or not people out there,

1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:20.740
 especially the listeners of this podcast,

1:23:20.740 --> 1:23:24.820
 are getting too much, just enough, or too little sodium.

1:23:24.820 --> 1:23:27.240
 So I can't know that, I'm shouting into a tunnel here.

1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:30.300
 You have to decide how much sodium you are ingesting.

1:23:31.140 --> 1:23:34.060
 But I think that there's some, for most people,

1:23:34.060 --> 1:23:36.740
 especially people who are not hypertensive, prehypertensive,

1:23:36.740 --> 1:23:38.880
 there's some wiggle room to explore

1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:42.840
 whether more intake of sodium could actually be beneficial

1:23:42.840 --> 1:23:45.260
 for suppressing some of the anxiety responses

1:23:45.260 --> 1:23:47.260
 that they might feel under conditions of stress.

1:23:47.260 --> 1:23:49.100
 Again, more studies need to be done.

1:23:49.100 --> 1:23:51.880
 Certainly more studies in humans need to be done,

1:23:51.880 --> 1:23:54.620
 but the relationship between stress and sodium intake

1:23:54.620 --> 1:23:58.620
 and the fact that additional sodium intake may be beneficial

1:23:59.500 --> 1:24:03.140
 and indeed is naturally stimulated by stress

1:24:03.140 --> 1:24:06.720
 shouldn't be necessarily looked at as a pathological event.

1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:08.020
 I know when some people get stressed,

1:24:08.020 --> 1:24:09.300
 they crave salty foods.

1:24:09.300 --> 1:24:12.160
 That's actually a hardwired biological phenomenon

1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:14.580
 that you see not just in humans, but in animals,

1:24:14.580 --> 1:24:16.980
 because this is a very primitive mechanism

1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:18.920
 whereby your body is preparing

1:24:18.920 --> 1:24:21.840
 to meet any additional challenges and stressors.

1:24:21.840 --> 1:24:23.700
 Now, we can't have a discussion about sodium

1:24:23.700 --> 1:24:26.540
 without having a discussion about the other electrolytes,

1:24:26.540 --> 1:24:28.020
 magnesium and potassium.

1:24:29.020 --> 1:24:30.540
 Magnesium is important enough

1:24:30.540 --> 1:24:32.160
 and an extensive enough topic

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:33.620
 that we should probably do an entire episode

1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:34.860
 just on magnesium.

1:24:35.940 --> 1:24:37.900
 For purposes of today's discussion,

1:24:37.900 --> 1:24:41.760
 I just will briefly touch on some of the forms of magnesium

1:24:41.760 --> 1:24:43.780
 that we've discussed on the podcast before

1:24:43.780 --> 1:24:45.640
 in different contexts.

1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:47.500
 I want to emphasize that many people

1:24:47.500 --> 1:24:50.620
 are probably getting enough magnesium in their diet

1:24:50.620 --> 1:24:53.560
 that they don't need to supplement magnesium.

1:24:53.560 --> 1:24:56.760
 Some people, however, opt to supplement magnesium

1:24:56.760 --> 1:24:58.500
 in ways that can support them.

1:24:58.500 --> 1:25:00.580
 And there are many different forms of magnesium.

1:25:00.580 --> 1:25:03.520
 And just in very brief passing,

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:07.200
 I'll just say that there is some evidence

1:25:07.200 --> 1:25:11.340
 that you can reduce muscle soreness from exercise

1:25:11.340 --> 1:25:15.740
 by ingestion of magnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E.

1:25:15.740 --> 1:25:20.020
 I've talked before about magnesium threnate,

1:25:20.020 --> 1:25:24.260
 T-H-R-E-N-O-A-T-E, magnesium threnate

1:25:24.260 --> 1:25:27.100
 for sake of promoting the transition into sleep

1:25:27.100 --> 1:25:28.100
 and for depth of sleep.

1:25:28.100 --> 1:25:30.620
 And perhaps, again, highlighted perhaps,

1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:32.980
 because right now it's mainly animal studies

1:25:32.980 --> 1:25:35.740
 and ongoing human studies, but the data aren't all in,

1:25:35.740 --> 1:25:38.740
 perhaps magnesium threnate can be used

1:25:38.740 --> 1:25:42.900
 as a way to support cognitive function and longevity.

1:25:42.900 --> 1:25:44.140
 That was discussed in the episode

1:25:44.140 --> 1:25:46.140
 with Dr. Jack Feldman from UCLA.

1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:51.120
 Typically magnesium threnate is taken 30 or 60 minutes

1:25:51.120 --> 1:25:53.000
 before bedtime in order to encourage sleep.

1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:54.640
 You can go to our neural network newsletter

1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:56.340
 and look for the one on sleep,

1:25:56.340 --> 1:25:58.060
 and you can see the recommendations,

1:25:58.060 --> 1:26:00.920
 or I should say the options for that,

1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:03.120
 because again, you should always check with your physician.

1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:05.920
 Those aren't strict across the board recommendations.

1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:07.560
 And then there are other forms of magnesium,

1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:09.000
 magnesium bisglycinate,

1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.640
 which is a somewhat of an alternative to threnate,

1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:14.540
 not known to have cognitive enhancing effects,

1:26:14.540 --> 1:26:18.660
 but seems at least on par with magnesium threnate

1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:20.300
 in terms of promoting transition

1:26:20.300 --> 1:26:22.760
 into in-depth of sleep and so on.

1:26:22.760 --> 1:26:25.580
 There are other forms of magnesium, magnesium citrate,

1:26:25.580 --> 1:26:27.520
 which has other functions.

1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:32.400
 Actually magnesium citrate is a fairly effective laxative,

1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:36.120
 not known to promote sleep and things of that sort.

1:26:36.120 --> 1:26:37.580
 So a lot of different forms of magnesium,

1:26:37.580 --> 1:26:39.780
 and there's still other forms out there.

1:26:39.780 --> 1:26:41.720
 Many people are not getting enough magnesium,

1:26:41.720 --> 1:26:42.640
 many people are.

1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:44.960
 Okay, so that's magnesium.

1:26:44.960 --> 1:26:47.520
 Anytime we're talking about sodium balance,

1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:49.880
 we have to take into consideration potassium,

1:26:49.880 --> 1:26:52.000
 because the way that the kidney works

1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:53.820
 and the way that sodium balance is regulated,

1:26:53.820 --> 1:26:55.240
 both in the body and the brain,

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:58.320
 is that sodium and potassium are working in close concert

1:26:58.320 --> 1:26:59.840
 with one another.

1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:01.380
 There are a lot of different recommendations

1:27:01.380 --> 1:27:03.800
 about ratios out there,

1:27:03.800 --> 1:27:07.420
 and they range widely from two to one ratio

1:27:07.420 --> 1:27:10.040
 of potassium to sodium.

1:27:10.040 --> 1:27:11.840
 I've heard it in the other direction too.

1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:15.200
 I've heard a two to one sodium to potassium.

1:27:15.200 --> 1:27:16.500
 The recommendations vary.

1:27:16.500 --> 1:27:19.440
 One of the sponsors of this podcast, for instance, Element,

1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:21.960
 which I've talked about in this episode and before,

1:27:21.960 --> 1:27:23.820
 the ratio there is a gram of sodium

1:27:23.820 --> 1:27:27.480
 to 200 milligrams of potassium, 60 milligrams of magnesium.

1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:32.400
 So there they've opted for a five to one ratio

1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:34.400
 of sodium to potassium.

1:27:34.400 --> 1:27:36.240
 And of course, many people opt to make their own

1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:37.720
 hydration electrolyte formulas.

1:27:37.720 --> 1:27:39.280
 They'll put sea salt into some water,

1:27:39.280 --> 1:27:41.400
 maybe even ingest a potassium tablet.

1:27:41.400 --> 1:27:43.120
 It all depends on the context.

1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:46.180
 An important contextual element is your diet.

1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:49.280
 So for instance, carbohydrates hold water in the body.

1:27:49.280 --> 1:27:50.600
 So regardless of how much salt

1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:52.080
 and how much fluid you're ingesting,

1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:55.420
 if you're ingesting carbohydrate and you drink fluids,

1:27:55.420 --> 1:27:58.260
 water, some of that fluid is going to be retained

1:27:58.260 --> 1:27:59.100
 in the body.

1:27:59.100 --> 1:28:02.260
 Now, for people that are following low carbohydrate diets,

1:28:02.260 --> 1:28:05.520
 one of the most immediate effects of a low carbohydrate diet

1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:07.400
 is that you're going to excrete more water.

1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:09.080
 And so under those conditions,

1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:11.240
 you're also going to lose not just water,

1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:13.760
 but you'll probably also lose sodium and potassium.

1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:16.840
 And so some people, many people in fact,

1:28:16.840 --> 1:28:20.280
 find that when they are on a lower or low carbohydrate diet,

1:28:20.280 --> 1:28:22.120
 then they need to make sure that they're getting enough

1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:24.280
 sodium and enough potassium.

1:28:24.280 --> 1:28:26.640
 And some people do that by taking 99 milligram

1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:28.400
 potassium tablets every time they eat.

1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:31.620
 Some people do that by ingesting more foods

1:28:31.620 --> 1:28:33.760
 that contain potassium.

1:28:33.760 --> 1:28:36.600
 And of course, some people who are on low carbohydrate diets

1:28:36.600 --> 1:28:40.920
 do ingest vegetables or other forms of food

1:28:40.920 --> 1:28:42.880
 that carry along with them potassium.

1:28:42.880 --> 1:28:47.240
 So it's quite variable from person to person.

1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:50.280
 I mean, you can imagine if carbohydrate holds water,

1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:53.680
 water and salt balance and potassium go hand in hand

1:28:53.680 --> 1:28:56.500
 and hand that if you're on a low carbohydrate diet

1:28:56.500 --> 1:28:59.000
 that you might need to adjust your salt intake and potassium

1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:02.120
 and conversely, that if you're on a carbohydrate rich diet

1:29:02.120 --> 1:29:03.400
 or a moderate carbohydrate diet,

1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:06.320
 then you may need to ingest less sodium and less potassium.

1:29:06.320 --> 1:29:08.120
 And in fact, a certain amount of water

1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:10.680
 is probably coming in through the foods you eat as well.

1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:12.640
 So I don't say all this to confuse you.

1:29:12.640 --> 1:29:17.560
 Again, I say this because it all depends on the context.

1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:19.280
 I'll give yet another context that I think

1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:21.400
 is fairly common nowadays,

1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:25.000
 which is many people are following a pattern of eating

1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.960
 that more or less resembles intermittent fasting

1:29:27.960 --> 1:29:29.420
 or at least time restricted feeding.

1:29:29.420 --> 1:29:32.420
 So they're eating between particular feeding windows.

1:29:32.420 --> 1:29:35.280
 And then in the certain parts of the 24 hour cycle,

1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:36.300
 not just sleep,

1:29:36.300 --> 1:29:38.080
 but during certain parts of their waking cycle,

1:29:38.080 --> 1:29:41.020
 they're also actively avoiding food banking on,

1:29:41.020 --> 1:29:45.540
 I think either the possible, I want to say possible

1:29:45.540 --> 1:29:48.480
 longevity promoting effects of intermittent fasting

1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:50.960
 or, and or I should say,

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:53.620
 they are banking on the fact that for many people,

1:29:53.620 --> 1:29:56.100
 not eating is easier than portion control

1:29:56.100 --> 1:29:57.120
 for certain parts of the day.

1:29:57.120 --> 1:30:01.040
 And so they find it beneficial to limit calories overall

1:30:01.040 --> 1:30:03.880
 to a given amount, depending on what their goals are

1:30:03.880 --> 1:30:07.840
 by not consuming food for certain periods of the day.

1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:09.320
 But usually during those periods of the day,

1:30:09.320 --> 1:30:10.620
 they're consuming fluids.

1:30:10.620 --> 1:30:12.720
 And oftentimes those fluids include not just water,

1:30:12.720 --> 1:30:15.360
 but caffeine and caffeine is a diuretic.

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:18.580
 It actually causes the excretion of fluids from the body

1:30:18.580 --> 1:30:22.040
 in part because it causes the excretion of sodium.

1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:25.440
 All of that to say that if you're somebody who,

1:30:25.440 --> 1:30:27.940
 for instance, eats your first meal around noon

1:30:27.940 --> 1:30:29.840
 or one or 2 p.m. and you're fasting

1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:30.960
 for the early part of the day

1:30:30.960 --> 1:30:32.600
 and you're drinking coffee or tea

1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:35.400
 or ingesting a lot of water,

1:30:35.400 --> 1:30:37.720
 you are going to be excreting sodium

1:30:37.720 --> 1:30:39.060
 along with that water.

1:30:39.060 --> 1:30:41.240
 And so many people, including myself,

1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:42.420
 find that it's useful,

1:30:42.420 --> 1:30:45.100
 especially when I'm drinking caffeine

1:30:45.100 --> 1:30:48.840
 during that so-called fasting or non-food intake

1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:51.240
 part of time-restricted feeding,

1:30:51.240 --> 1:30:53.440
 that I'm making sure to get enough salt

1:30:53.440 --> 1:30:56.200
 either in the form of something like Element,

1:30:56.200 --> 1:30:57.160
 an electrolyte drink,

1:30:57.160 --> 1:30:59.360
 or putting some sea salt into some water,

1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:03.680
 or certainly anytime one is ingesting caffeine,

1:31:03.680 --> 1:31:05.580
 replacing some of the lost water

1:31:05.580 --> 1:31:08.560
 by increasing one's water intake.

1:31:08.560 --> 1:31:10.520
 There are some simple rules of thumb around this

1:31:10.520 --> 1:31:13.300
 that I think can get most people into a place

1:31:13.300 --> 1:31:15.920
 where they're more comfortable and functioning better,

1:31:15.920 --> 1:31:20.280
 which is for every ounce of coffee or tea that you drink,

1:31:20.280 --> 1:31:22.720
 I should say caffeinated coffee or tea that you drink,

1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:26.240
 that you consume one and a half times as much water.

1:31:26.240 --> 1:31:28.960
 So let's say you have an eight-ounce coffee.

1:31:28.960 --> 1:31:30.780
 Try and drink about, you don't have to be exact,

1:31:30.780 --> 1:31:33.560
 but try and drink about a 12-ounce glass of water,

1:31:33.560 --> 1:31:35.760
 and you might want to put a tiny bit of sodium into that.

1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:37.960
 By tiny bit, I just mean a tiny pinch of sodium.

1:31:37.960 --> 1:31:40.360
 Because remember, even if we're talking about

1:31:40.360 --> 1:31:43.720
 increasing the amount of sodium intake overall,

1:31:43.720 --> 1:31:47.000
 the total amount of sodium contained in salt

1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:50.140
 is sufficiently high that even just a quarter teaspoon

1:31:50.140 --> 1:31:51.920
 is going to really start to move that number up

1:31:51.920 --> 1:31:54.640
 towards that range that's still within the safe range,

1:31:54.640 --> 1:31:57.100
 but if you keep doing that all day long,

1:31:57.100 --> 1:31:58.280
 you're very quickly going to get into

1:31:58.280 --> 1:31:59.840
 that excessive salt intake range

1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:01.880
 that is deleterious for health.

1:32:01.880 --> 1:32:03.520
 So again, if you're consuming more caffeine,

1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:06.280
 you're going to be excreting water and salt and potassium,

1:32:06.280 --> 1:32:07.580
 and so you're going to have to find ways

1:32:07.580 --> 1:32:09.600
 to bring water, salt, and potassium back in.

1:32:09.600 --> 1:32:11.520
 Again, this has to be evaluated

1:32:11.520 --> 1:32:14.100
 for each of your own individual situations.

1:32:14.100 --> 1:32:17.080
 If you're exercising fasted,

1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:19.720
 and you're doing that after drinking caffeine,

1:32:19.720 --> 1:32:23.480
 then before, during, and certainly after exercise,

1:32:23.480 --> 1:32:25.200
 you're going to want to replenish the fluids

1:32:25.200 --> 1:32:28.300
 and electrolytes that you lost, including sodium.

1:32:28.300 --> 1:32:30.300
 So you can imagine how this all starts

1:32:30.300 --> 1:32:31.880
 to become pretty dizzying,

1:32:31.880 --> 1:32:33.400
 and yet it doesn't have to be dizzying.

1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:35.080
 We can provide some useful ranges

1:32:35.080 --> 1:32:37.280
 that for most people will work.

1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:39.000
 And so let's talk about what those ranges are,

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:40.660
 and I'm going to point you to a resource

1:32:40.660 --> 1:32:42.400
 that explores what those ranges are

1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:45.800
 in these various contexts of nutrition, exercise, and so on.

1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:48.580
 The resource is a book that was authored

1:32:48.580 --> 1:32:51.640
 by Dr. James D. Nicolantonio.

1:32:51.640 --> 1:32:53.060
 He's not a medical doctor.

1:32:53.060 --> 1:32:58.060
 He's a scientist, studies cardiovascular physiology,

1:32:58.340 --> 1:33:00.680
 as well, I believe, as a doctor of pharmacy,

1:33:00.680 --> 1:33:02.720
 and the title of the book is The Salt Fix.

1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:04.220
 The Salt Fix is an interesting read

1:33:04.220 --> 1:33:06.320
 because it points to, first of all,

1:33:06.320 --> 1:33:11.320
 the history of salt in society and as it relates to health.

1:33:11.760 --> 1:33:14.760
 It actually emphasizes some of the major missteps,

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:17.980
 maybe even pretty drastic errors that have been made

1:33:17.980 --> 1:33:20.320
 in terms of trying to interpret the role

1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:24.260
 that salt has in various diseases,

1:33:24.260 --> 1:33:26.920
 and emphasizes some of the ways

1:33:26.920 --> 1:33:29.480
 in which perhaps increasing salt

1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:31.680
 can actually improve health outcomes.

1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:33.820
 And I think it strikes a pretty nice balance

1:33:33.820 --> 1:33:36.840
 between what's commonly known about salt

1:33:36.840 --> 1:33:40.320
 and what I believe ought to be known about salt,

1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:42.240
 or at least taken into consideration.

1:33:43.320 --> 1:33:46.520
 The book does provide certain recommendations,

1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:48.360
 and I actually reached out to the author.

1:33:48.360 --> 1:33:51.320
 I've never met him in person or talked to him directly.

1:33:51.320 --> 1:33:54.960
 And I asked him outright, I said,

1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:59.240
 how much salt do you recommend people take on average?

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:03.000
 And he gave, of course, the appropriate caveats

1:34:03.000 --> 1:34:05.440
 about pre-hypertension, hypertension, et cetera,

1:34:05.440 --> 1:34:09.960
 but made a recommendation, which I'll just share with you.

1:34:09.960 --> 1:34:11.320
 And if you want to learn more

1:34:11.320 --> 1:34:13.560
 about the support for this recommendation,

1:34:13.560 --> 1:34:14.840
 you can check out his book.

1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:17.120
 The recommendation he made was anywhere

1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:19.520
 from eight to 12 grams of salt a day,

1:34:19.520 --> 1:34:24.520
 which corresponds to 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium.

1:34:24.920 --> 1:34:28.960
 So going back to the current recommendations

1:34:28.960 --> 1:34:32.240
 that we talked about before, 2.3 grams of sodium per day,

1:34:32.240 --> 1:34:34.080
 this is about one and a half times

1:34:34.080 --> 1:34:37.920
 to double the amount of sodium

1:34:37.920 --> 1:34:40.920
 that's currently recommended in most circles.

1:34:40.920 --> 1:34:42.280
 And then what this corresponds to

1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:46.260
 is about one and a half to two teaspoons of salt per day

1:34:46.260 --> 1:34:49.080
 to arrive at that 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium.

1:34:49.080 --> 1:34:52.920
 Again, this is the recommendation that was passed along

1:34:52.920 --> 1:34:54.920
 for most people, most conditions

1:34:54.920 --> 1:34:58.760
 barring specific health issues.

1:34:58.760 --> 1:35:00.820
 Now, what was also interesting is he pointed to

1:35:00.820 --> 1:35:03.320
 a sodium to potassium ratio,

1:35:03.320 --> 1:35:06.360
 which is four grams of potassium.

1:35:06.360 --> 1:35:08.900
 And he also mentioned 400 milligrams of magnesium

1:35:08.900 --> 1:35:11.140
 and pointed out, and I generally agree here

1:35:11.140 --> 1:35:14.040
 that many people are deficient in magnesium.

1:35:14.040 --> 1:35:18.880
 So again, that was a 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium,

1:35:18.880 --> 1:35:21.020
 four grams of potassium.

1:35:21.020 --> 1:35:23.000
 You might think, well, gosh, that's a one and a half

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.840
 to two times the current recommendation,

1:35:24.840 --> 1:35:27.640
 but we can go back to that study

1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:29.400
 that was mentioned earlier in the episode,

1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:32.480
 that 2011 study where I described this

1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:37.200
 sort of J-shaped curve in which when you look at the

1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:39.320
 occurrence of these negative health events,

1:35:39.320 --> 1:35:42.440
 they were fairly low at low sodium intake,

1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:45.480
 lower still at slightly higher sodium intake,

1:35:45.480 --> 1:35:48.540
 much in line with the recommendations that are made

1:35:48.540 --> 1:35:52.960
 or that Dr. D. Nicolantonio passed along to me.

1:35:52.960 --> 1:35:54.660
 And then they increased quite,

1:35:54.660 --> 1:35:58.100
 those health risks increase quite substantially as one moves

1:35:58.100 --> 1:36:00.860
 out past six grams of sodium,

1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:02.100
 seven grams of sodium per day.

1:36:02.100 --> 1:36:04.700
 That's when things really do seem to get hazardous

1:36:05.900 --> 1:36:08.600
 and really it makes sense, I think,

1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:10.200
 given the consensus around this

1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:12.300
 to really avoid very high salt intake.

1:36:13.200 --> 1:36:17.180
 So the salt fix describes the rationale

1:36:17.180 --> 1:36:19.160
 behind those recommendations.

1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:23.400
 The salt fix also describes in quite beautiful detail

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:27.400
 the relationship between salt intake, potassium intake,

1:36:27.400 --> 1:36:31.040
 and the relationship to the sugar consumption system.

1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:33.240
 I'd like to pick up on this idea of the relationship

1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:35.940
 between salt and sugar,

1:36:35.940 --> 1:36:39.120
 because I think that one key aspect of the way

1:36:39.120 --> 1:36:42.220
 that salt can work and can benefit us or can harm us

1:36:42.220 --> 1:36:47.200
 has to do with the way that sodium and sugar are regulated

1:36:47.200 --> 1:36:49.120
 and actually perceived by the brain

1:36:49.120 --> 1:36:52.600
 and how under conditions of certain levels of sodium intake,

1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:54.680
 we might be inspired to seek more sugar

1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:56.820
 or to crave sweets more or less.

1:36:56.820 --> 1:36:57.660
 So up until now,

1:36:57.660 --> 1:36:59.740
 we've been talking about salt as a substance

1:36:59.740 --> 1:37:01.900
 and a way to regulate fluid balance

1:37:01.900 --> 1:37:04.200
 and blood volume and so on.

1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:06.320
 We haven't talked a lot about salt as a taste

1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:08.920
 or the taste of things that are salty.

1:37:08.920 --> 1:37:12.280
 And yet we know that we have salt receptors,

1:37:12.280 --> 1:37:16.320
 meaning neurons that fire action potentials

1:37:16.320 --> 1:37:19.600
 when salty substances are detected much in the same way

1:37:19.600 --> 1:37:22.360
 that we have sweet detectors and bitter detectors

1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:24.680
 and we have detectors of umami,

1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:27.120
 the savory flavor on our tongue.

1:37:27.120 --> 1:37:29.120
 And earlier at the beginning of the episode,

1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:33.040
 I talked about the fact that we have sweet receptors,

1:37:33.040 --> 1:37:35.440
 neurons that respond to the presence of sugar

1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:38.840
 or even non-caloric sweet things in the gut

1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:42.120
 and that signals up to the brain through the vagus nerve

1:37:42.120 --> 1:37:44.040
 and those signals converge on pathways

1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:45.920
 that relate to dopamine and so on.

1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:48.920
 Well, we also have salt sensors at various locations

1:37:48.920 --> 1:37:51.020
 throughout our digestive tract,

1:37:51.020 --> 1:37:53.600
 although the sensation and the taste of salt

1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:56.640
 actually exerts a very robust effect

1:37:56.640 --> 1:37:59.000
 on certain areas of the brain

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:03.200
 that can either make us crave more or sate,

1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:06.020
 meaning fulfill our desire for salt.

1:38:06.020 --> 1:38:07.900
 And you can imagine why this would be important.

1:38:07.900 --> 1:38:09.240
 Your brain actually has to register

1:38:09.240 --> 1:38:11.680
 whether or not you're bringing in salt

1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:13.360
 in order to know whether or not

1:38:13.360 --> 1:38:16.520
 you are going to crave salt more or not.

1:38:16.520 --> 1:38:19.560
 And beautiful work that's been done by the Zucker Lab,

1:38:19.560 --> 1:38:22.400
 Z-U-K-E-R, Zucker Lab at Columbia University,

1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:25.400
 as well as many other labs have used imaging techniques

1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:27.400
 and other techniques such as molecular biology

1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:29.400
 to define these so-called parallel pathways.

1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:32.940
 Parallel meaning pathways that represent sweet

1:38:32.940 --> 1:38:35.960
 or the presence of sweet taste in the mouth and gut.

1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:37.800
 Parallel pathways, meaning neural circuits

1:38:37.800 --> 1:38:40.000
 that represent the presence of salty tastes

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:41.880
 in the mouth and gut and so on.

1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:44.440
 And that those go into the brain,

1:38:44.440 --> 1:38:46.680
 move up through brain stem centers

1:38:46.680 --> 1:38:48.200
 and up to the neocortex,

1:38:48.200 --> 1:38:50.600
 indeed where our seat of our conscious perception is

1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:55.600
 to give us a sense and a perception of the components

1:38:55.960 --> 1:38:57.960
 of the foods that we happen to be ingesting

1:38:57.960 --> 1:39:00.740
 and a sense and a perception of the fluids

1:39:00.740 --> 1:39:02.060
 and the components of those fluids

1:39:02.060 --> 1:39:04.040
 that we happen to be ingesting.

1:39:04.040 --> 1:39:06.920
 Now, parallel pathways, as I'm describing them,

1:39:06.920 --> 1:39:10.700
 are a fundamental feature of every sensory system,

1:39:10.700 --> 1:39:13.360
 not just the taste system, but also the visual system.

1:39:13.360 --> 1:39:15.760
 We have parallel pathways for perceiving dark objects

1:39:15.760 --> 1:39:18.440
 versus light objects, for perceiving red versus green,

1:39:18.440 --> 1:39:19.840
 et cetera.

1:39:19.840 --> 1:39:22.580
 This is a fundamental feature of how we are built

1:39:22.580 --> 1:39:24.260
 and how our nervous system works.

1:39:24.260 --> 1:39:28.680
 And in the taste system, much like in these other systems,

1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:31.320
 these pathways are indeed parallel,

1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:34.480
 but they converge and they can influence one another.

1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:36.520
 And I think the simplest way to put this

1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:38.520
 is in the context first of the visual system,

1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:42.280
 whereby your ability to detect the color red

1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:43.840
 has everything to do with the fact

1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:45.760
 that you have neurons in your eye

1:39:45.760 --> 1:39:49.360
 that absorb long wavelengths of light that we call reds,

1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:50.560
 red wavelengths of light,

1:39:50.560 --> 1:39:53.920
 which are longer wavelengths than say blue light,

1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:55.200
 which is shorter wavelength.

1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:58.160
 But it is really the comparison of the electrical activity

1:39:58.160 --> 1:40:00.320
 of the neurons that absorb red light

1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:03.480
 with the activity of the neurons that absorb green light,

1:40:03.480 --> 1:40:05.720
 which actually gives you the perception of red.

1:40:05.720 --> 1:40:07.960
 So that might seem a little counterintuitive,

1:40:07.960 --> 1:40:09.260
 but indeed it's not.

1:40:09.260 --> 1:40:12.700
 It's actually because something is red

1:40:12.700 --> 1:40:14.840
 and has less greenness

1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:18.320
 that we perceive it as more red than the green.

1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:19.600
 And this is actually the way

1:40:19.600 --> 1:40:21.620
 that your entire nervous system works,

1:40:21.620 --> 1:40:23.280
 is that we aren't really good

1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:25.820
 at evaluating absolute levels of anything

1:40:25.820 --> 1:40:27.040
 in the context of perception.

1:40:27.040 --> 1:40:29.440
 It's only by comparison.

1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:31.480
 And actually there's a fun experiment that you can do.

1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:33.680
 I think you could probably find it easily online.

1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:35.080
 You could also do this experiment at home.

1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:37.040
 You can stare at something that's red

1:40:38.020 --> 1:40:40.140
 or green for that matter for a while.

1:40:40.140 --> 1:40:44.240
 So you make an active decision to not blink

1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:45.960
 and to stare at something that's red.

1:40:45.960 --> 1:40:47.900
 And then you look away from that thing

1:40:47.900 --> 1:40:50.400
 and you'll actually see a green after image

1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:51.800
 of that red object.

1:40:51.800 --> 1:40:54.240
 Conversely, if you look at something that's green for a while

1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:55.680
 and you stare at it and you look away,

1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:58.700
 you will see the red after image of that thing.

1:40:58.700 --> 1:41:00.120
 Now the taste system doesn't have

1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:04.400
 quite the same aftertaste type effect,

1:41:04.400 --> 1:41:07.120
 but nonetheless, the pathways,

1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:08.720
 the parallel pathways for salty

1:41:08.720 --> 1:41:12.240
 and the parallel pathways for sweet and bitter and so on

1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:13.480
 can actually interact.

1:41:13.480 --> 1:41:14.840
 And this has important relevance

1:41:14.840 --> 1:41:18.500
 in the context of food choices and sugar craving.

1:41:18.500 --> 1:41:21.300
 One of the things that's commonplace nowadays

1:41:21.300 --> 1:41:24.640
 is in many processed foods, there is a business,

1:41:24.640 --> 1:41:28.260
 literally a business of putting so-called hidden sugars.

1:41:28.260 --> 1:41:29.740
 And these hidden sugars are not always

1:41:29.740 --> 1:41:31.120
 in the form of caloric sugars.

1:41:31.120 --> 1:41:33.680
 They're sometimes in the form of artificial sweeteners

1:41:33.680 --> 1:41:35.240
 into various foods.

1:41:35.240 --> 1:41:38.280
 And you might say, well, why would they put more sugar

1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:41.140
 into a food and then disguise the sugary taste

1:41:41.140 --> 1:41:43.420
 given that sweet tastes often compel people

1:41:43.420 --> 1:41:44.940
 to eat more of these things?

1:41:44.940 --> 1:41:47.720
 Well, it's a way actually of bypassing

1:41:47.720 --> 1:41:50.960
 some of the homeostatic mechanisms for sweet.

1:41:50.960 --> 1:41:53.340
 Even though we might think that the more sweet stuff we eat,

1:41:53.340 --> 1:41:55.120
 the more sweet stuff we crave,

1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:57.360
 in general, people have a threshold whereby they say,

1:41:57.360 --> 1:41:59.920
 okay, I've had enough sugary stuff.

1:41:59.920 --> 1:42:01.600
 You can actually experience this

1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:04.340
 if you ever feel like something is really, really sweet.

1:42:04.340 --> 1:42:06.420
 Take a little sip of water

1:42:06.420 --> 1:42:08.160
 with a little bit of lemon juice in it or vinegar

1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:09.800
 and it will quickly quench

1:42:09.800 --> 1:42:12.800
 that overly sweet sensation or perception.

1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:14.720
 It will disappear almost immediately.

1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:17.220
 There's actually a practice in fancy meals

1:42:17.220 --> 1:42:19.160
 of cleansing the palate

1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:20.960
 through the ingestion of different foods.

1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:22.640
 And that's the same idea that you're cleansing the palate.

1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:24.960
 You're actually neutralizing the previous taste

1:42:24.960 --> 1:42:26.940
 so then they can bring yet another dish

1:42:26.940 --> 1:42:30.140
 to overindulge you in decadence and so forth.

1:42:30.140 --> 1:42:32.680
 So these sensory systems interact in this way.

1:42:34.280 --> 1:42:36.940
 By putting sugars into foods

1:42:36.940 --> 1:42:40.120
 and hiding the sugary taste of those foods,

1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:43.620
 those foods, even if they contain artificial sweeteners,

1:42:43.620 --> 1:42:45.500
 can activate the sorts of neurons

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:47.120
 that we talked about at the beginning of the episode,

1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:48.760
 like the neuropod cells

1:42:48.760 --> 1:42:51.360
 that will then signal to the brain to release more dopamine

1:42:51.360 --> 1:42:52.940
 and make you crave more of that food.

1:42:52.940 --> 1:42:55.440
 Whereas had you been able to perceive

1:42:55.440 --> 1:42:57.720
 the true sweetness of that food,

1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:00.400
 you might've consumed less and indeed that's what happens.

1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:03.300
 So these hidden sugars are kind of diabolical.

1:43:03.300 --> 1:43:05.020
 Why am I talking about all of this

1:43:05.020 --> 1:43:07.820
 in the context of an episode on salt?

1:43:07.820 --> 1:43:10.520
 Well, as many of you have probably noticed,

1:43:10.520 --> 1:43:12.280
 a lot of foods out there

1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:15.400
 contain a salty-sweet combination,

1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:18.280
 and it's that combination of salty and sweet

1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:20.320
 which can actually lead you to consume more

1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:24.760
 of the salty-sweet food than you would have

1:43:24.760 --> 1:43:28.280
 if it had just been sweet or it had just been salty.

1:43:28.280 --> 1:43:32.540
 And that's because both sweet taste and salty taste

1:43:32.540 --> 1:43:34.400
 have a homeostatic balance.

1:43:34.400 --> 1:43:36.540
 So if you ingest something that's very, very salty,

1:43:36.540 --> 1:43:39.360
 pretty soon your appetite for salty foods will be reduced.

1:43:39.360 --> 1:43:41.800
 But if you mask some of that with sweet,

1:43:41.800 --> 1:43:45.920
 well, because of the interactions of these parallel pathways

1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:48.280
 you somewhat shut down your perception

1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:50.640
 of how much salt you're ingesting,

1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:53.880
 or conversely, by ingesting some salt with sweet foods,

1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:55.760
 you mask some of the sweetness

1:43:55.760 --> 1:43:57.080
 of the sweet foods that you're tasting

1:43:57.080 --> 1:43:58.960
 and you will continue to indulge in those foods.

1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:03.080
 So salty-sweet interactions can be very diabolical,

1:44:03.080 --> 1:44:04.440
 they can also be very tasty,

1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:05.800
 but they can be very diabolical

1:44:05.800 --> 1:44:08.880
 in terms of inspiring you to eat more of a particular food

1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:10.200
 than you would otherwise

1:44:10.200 --> 1:44:13.360
 if you were just following your homeostatic salt

1:44:13.360 --> 1:44:16.680
 or your homeostatic sugar balance systems.

1:44:16.680 --> 1:44:18.160
 And the beautiful imaging work

1:44:18.160 --> 1:44:20.440
 that's been done by the Zucker Lab and other labs

1:44:20.440 --> 1:44:21.840
 has actually been able to reveal

1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:24.500
 how some of this might work by showing, for instance,

1:44:24.500 --> 1:44:28.300
 that a certain ensemble, meaning a certain group of neurons,

1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:30.600
 is activated by a sweet taste

1:44:30.600 --> 1:44:34.240
 and a non-overlapping distinct set of neurons just nearby,

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:37.080
 sitting cheek to jowl with those other neurons,

1:44:37.080 --> 1:44:39.280
 would be activated by salty tastes

1:44:39.280 --> 1:44:41.160
 and yet others by bitter taste, et cetera.

1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:42.840
 So there's a separate map

1:44:42.840 --> 1:44:44.560
 of these different parallel pathways,

1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:47.780
 but that when foods or fluids are ingested

1:44:47.780 --> 1:44:50.000
 that are both salty and sweet,

1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.720
 you get a yet entirely different

1:44:52.720 --> 1:44:54.740
 ensemble of neurons activated.

1:44:54.740 --> 1:44:58.540
 So your brain, whether or not it's for your visual system

1:44:58.540 --> 1:45:00.560
 or your auditory system or your taste system,

1:45:00.560 --> 1:45:03.420
 has a way of representing the pure form of taste,

1:45:03.420 --> 1:45:05.040
 salty, sweet, bitter, et cetera,

1:45:05.040 --> 1:45:07.800
 and has a way of representing their combinations.

1:45:07.800 --> 1:45:12.060
 And food manufacturers have exploited this to large degree.

1:45:12.060 --> 1:45:14.120
 I mention all of this because if you're somebody

1:45:14.120 --> 1:45:17.600
 who's looking to explore either increasing

1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:21.020
 or decreasing your sodium intake for health benefits,

1:45:21.020 --> 1:45:22.920
 for performance benefits,

1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:25.620
 in many ways, it is useful to do that

1:45:25.620 --> 1:45:28.160
 in the context of a fairly pure,

1:45:28.160 --> 1:45:30.960
 meaning unprocessed food intake background,

1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:33.880
 whether or not that's keto, carnivore, omnivore,

1:45:34.880 --> 1:45:36.400
 intermittent fasting or what have you,

1:45:36.400 --> 1:45:37.520
 it doesn't really matter.

1:45:37.520 --> 1:45:42.000
 But the closer that foods are to their basic form and taste,

1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:46.280
 meaning not combinations of large amounts of ingredients

1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:49.100
 and certainly avoiding highly processed foods,

1:45:49.100 --> 1:45:51.720
 the more quickly you're going to be able to hone in

1:45:51.720 --> 1:45:54.860
 on your specific salt appetite and salt needs,

1:45:54.860 --> 1:45:56.920
 which as I've pointed out numerous times

1:45:56.920 --> 1:45:58.240
 throughout this episode are going to vary

1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:00.320
 from person to person, depending on nutrition,

1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:02.920
 depending on activity, depending on hormone status,

1:46:02.920 --> 1:46:06.020
 or even portion of your menstrual cycle for that matter.

1:46:06.020 --> 1:46:07.900
 So if you want to hone in

1:46:07.900 --> 1:46:09.800
 on the appropriate amount of sodium for you,

1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:12.740
 yes, blood pressure is going to be an important metric

1:46:12.740 --> 1:46:14.320
 to pay attention to as you go along.

1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:16.720
 And the parameters for healthy blood pressure ranges

1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:18.200
 are readily available online.

1:46:18.200 --> 1:46:19.940
 So I'll let you refer to those

1:46:19.940 --> 1:46:21.860
 in order to determine those for yourself.

1:46:21.860 --> 1:46:25.040
 But in determining whether or not increasing

1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:26.840
 your salt intake might be beneficial

1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:29.480
 for, for instance, for reducing anxiety a bit

1:46:29.480 --> 1:46:31.160
 or for increasing blood pressure

1:46:31.160 --> 1:46:33.560
 to offset some of these postural syndromes

1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:34.880
 where you get dizzy, et cetera,

1:46:34.880 --> 1:46:37.780
 for improving sports performance or cognitive performance,

1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:41.480
 I can only recommend that you do this

1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:43.600
 in a fairly clean context

1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:44.680
 where you're not trying to do this

1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:46.600
 by ingesting a bunch of salty foods

1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:48.560
 or salty sweet foods, et cetera.

1:46:48.560 --> 1:46:51.400
 And indeed, many people find, and it's reviewed a bit,

1:46:51.400 --> 1:46:53.520
 and some of the data are reviewed in the book,

1:46:53.520 --> 1:46:57.840
 The Salt Fix, that when people increase their salt intake

1:46:57.840 --> 1:47:01.560
 in a backdrop of relatively unprocessed foods,

1:47:01.560 --> 1:47:04.440
 that sugar cravings can indeed be vastly reduced.

1:47:04.440 --> 1:47:06.160
 And that makes sense given the way

1:47:06.160 --> 1:47:09.000
 that these neural pathways for salty and sweet interact.

1:47:09.000 --> 1:47:12.880
 Now, thus far, I've already covered quite a lot of material,

1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:15.400
 but I would be completely remiss

1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:17.980
 if I didn't emphasize the crucial role

1:47:17.980 --> 1:47:21.680
 that sodium plays in the way that neurons function.

1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:24.600
 In fact, sodium is one of the key elements

1:47:24.600 --> 1:47:27.320
 that allows neurons to function at all.

1:47:27.320 --> 1:47:28.680
 And that's by way of engaging

1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:30.640
 what we call the action potential.

1:47:30.640 --> 1:47:34.360
 The action potential is the firing

1:47:34.360 --> 1:47:37.360
 of electrical activity by neurons.

1:47:37.360 --> 1:47:39.800
 Neurons can engage electrical activity

1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:40.920
 in a number of different ways.

1:47:40.920 --> 1:47:44.240
 They have graded potentials, they have gap junctions.

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:45.760
 There's a whole landscape

1:47:45.760 --> 1:47:49.020
 of different electrophysiologies of neurons

1:47:49.020 --> 1:47:51.640
 that I don't want to go into just yet.

1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:53.300
 At least not in this episode.

1:47:53.300 --> 1:47:55.940
 But the action potential is the fundamental way

1:47:55.940 --> 1:47:58.620
 in which neurons communicate with one another.

1:47:58.620 --> 1:48:00.680
 They're sometimes called spikes.

1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:04.240
 It's just kind of nomenclature that neuroscientists use.

1:48:04.240 --> 1:48:06.440
 I'm just going to briefly describe the action potential

1:48:06.440 --> 1:48:08.360
 and the role that sodium plays.

1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:10.800
 And this will involve a little bit of chemistry,

1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:13.120
 but I promise it will be accessible to anyone,

1:48:13.120 --> 1:48:15.360
 even if you don't have a chemistry or a physics background

1:48:15.360 --> 1:48:16.920
 or electrophysiology background.

1:48:18.080 --> 1:48:20.800
 Neurons have an inside and an outside.

1:48:20.800 --> 1:48:25.640
 And inside are things like your genetic material.

1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:27.800
 They have a bunch of things floating around in there

1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:29.740
 that allow those cells to function.

1:48:29.740 --> 1:48:32.760
 And they tend to have this wire extending out of them,

1:48:32.760 --> 1:48:33.920
 sometimes a very long wire,

1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:36.100
 sometimes a short one that we call the axon.

1:48:36.100 --> 1:48:39.200
 And at the end of that wire, that axon,

1:48:39.200 --> 1:48:42.480
 they release little packets of chemicals

1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:47.120
 that either cause the next neuron to fire action potentials

1:48:47.120 --> 1:48:49.920
 or prevent the next neuron from firing action potential.

1:48:49.920 --> 1:48:53.880
 So they kind of vomit out these little packets of chemicals

1:48:53.880 --> 1:48:57.760
 that either inspire or suppress action potentials

1:48:57.760 --> 1:48:58.780
 in other neurons.

1:49:00.200 --> 1:49:03.800
 The way that that whole process occurs

1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:07.480
 is that a given neuron needs to change

1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:08.540
 its electrical activity.

1:49:08.540 --> 1:49:12.000
 So normally neurons are hanging out

1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:13.860
 and they have what we call a negative charge.

1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:16.320
 And the reason they have a negative charge

1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:18.200
 is that the inside of the cell

1:49:18.200 --> 1:49:19.620
 has things floating around in it,

1:49:19.620 --> 1:49:22.400
 like potassium, a little bit of sodium

1:49:22.400 --> 1:49:23.900
 and some stuff like chloride.

1:49:23.900 --> 1:49:25.080
 These are literally just,

1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:28.440
 just imagine these as little balls of stuff.

1:49:28.440 --> 1:49:31.520
 And if they have a negative charge on them,

1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:32.600
 then the inside of the cell

1:49:32.600 --> 1:49:34.040
 is going to tend to be more negative.

1:49:34.040 --> 1:49:36.120
 And outside of the cell, it turns out

1:49:36.120 --> 1:49:38.600
 you're going to have a bunch of stuff

1:49:38.600 --> 1:49:40.680
 that's positively charged.

1:49:40.680 --> 1:49:42.680
 And one of the main factors

1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:44.920
 in creating that positive charge is sodium.

1:49:44.920 --> 1:49:47.080
 Sodium carries a positive charge.

1:49:47.080 --> 1:49:50.440
 So you have neurons that you can just imagine,

1:49:50.440 --> 1:49:52.160
 for sake of this discussion,

1:49:52.160 --> 1:49:53.640
 you can just imagine as a sphere

1:49:53.640 --> 1:49:55.680
 with a little wire sticking out of it.

1:49:55.680 --> 1:49:58.680
 They, you can put a little minus on the inside for negative.

1:49:58.680 --> 1:50:01.280
 You can put a little plus on the outside for positive.

1:50:01.280 --> 1:50:05.980
 And when that neuron is stimulated by another neuron,

1:50:05.980 --> 1:50:08.280
 if the stimulation, the electrical stimulation

1:50:08.280 --> 1:50:09.880
 is sufficiently high,

1:50:11.200 --> 1:50:14.640
 meaning enough little packets of neurotransmitter

1:50:14.640 --> 1:50:17.200
 have been vomited onto its surface

1:50:17.200 --> 1:50:19.240
 at sufficient concentration,

1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:24.000
 what happens is little pores, little spaces,

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:28.720
 little gaps open up in the membrane of that cell

1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:31.800
 that separates the inside from the outside.

1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:34.100
 And because it's positive,

1:50:34.100 --> 1:50:35.920
 there's a lot of positive charge outside

1:50:35.920 --> 1:50:38.320
 and there's a lot of negative inside.

1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:40.460
 It's like a boulder running downhill.

1:50:40.460 --> 1:50:42.560
 All this stuff tends to rush downhill.

1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:44.720
 It tries to create even amounts of charge.

1:50:44.720 --> 1:50:47.200
 So it's negative on the inside, positive on the outside.

1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:51.400
 And what happens is sodium rushes into the cell,

1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:53.560
 carrying a lot of charge into the cell.

1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:55.040
 And as a consequence,

1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:57.560
 the charge of that cell goes from negative,

1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:00.280
 actually very negative, to quite positive.

1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:03.800
 And if it hits a certain threshold of positive charge

1:51:03.800 --> 1:51:07.400
 because of all the sodium ions going into the cell,

1:51:07.400 --> 1:51:10.300
 then it fires what's called an action potential.

1:51:10.300 --> 1:51:13.560
 And it vomits out its own set of chemicals

1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:14.440
 onto the next neuron.

1:51:14.440 --> 1:51:16.880
 And so it sets off a chain of one neuron

1:51:16.880 --> 1:51:18.940
 goes from negative to positive,

1:51:18.940 --> 1:51:20.600
 vomits out chemicals onto the next one.

1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:25.600
 The next neuron that binds to receptors or enters the cell

1:51:26.200 --> 1:51:30.020
 and that cell goes from negative to positive charge,

1:51:30.020 --> 1:51:32.160
 vomits its contents onto the next cell

1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:33.500
 and so on and so forth.

1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:37.840
 Sodium rushing into the cell, therefore,

1:51:37.840 --> 1:51:41.240
 is the way that the action potential is stimulated.

1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:44.280
 In other words, sodium is the way

1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:46.720
 that neurons communicate with one another.

1:51:46.720 --> 1:51:50.020
 Now, the neurons don't stay in a positive charge,

1:51:50.020 --> 1:51:53.680
 otherwise they would just keep vomiting out their contents.

1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:55.080
 But they need to maintain some of that

1:51:55.080 --> 1:51:56.960
 and they need to go back to preparing to do it

1:51:56.960 --> 1:51:59.320
 the next time and the next time by resting a bit.

1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:02.040
 And it turns out that the way they restore their charge

1:52:02.040 --> 1:52:06.600
 is by pushing that sodium back out of the cell,

1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:08.280
 there are mechanisms in place to do that,

1:52:08.280 --> 1:52:11.220
 things like the so-called sodium potassium pump.

1:52:11.220 --> 1:52:14.520
 There's a change in the levels of potassium

1:52:14.520 --> 1:52:16.600
 across the cell membrane and so on and so forth.

1:52:16.600 --> 1:52:18.000
 If you want to look at a demonstration of this,

1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:22.840
 you can put into a web browser the action potential.

1:52:22.840 --> 1:52:24.560
 You'll find some beautiful descriptions there

1:52:24.560 --> 1:52:26.560
 on YouTube and elsewhere.

1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:28.320
 Maybe some time on Instagram,

1:52:28.320 --> 1:52:30.280
 I'll do a description with a diagram

1:52:30.280 --> 1:52:31.660
 because I realize a number of people

1:52:31.660 --> 1:52:33.000
 are just listening to this.

1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:34.100
 I can't do that here.

1:52:34.100 --> 1:52:36.200
 I won't do that here because I want everyone

1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:37.840
 to be able to get the same amount of material

1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:39.200
 regardless of whether or not they're watching

1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:40.860
 and or listening to this.

1:52:40.860 --> 1:52:43.680
 But the point I'd like to make,

1:52:43.680 --> 1:52:45.760
 at least as it relates to this episode on salt,

1:52:45.760 --> 1:52:49.860
 is that having sufficient levels of salt in your system

1:52:49.860 --> 1:52:51.260
 allows your brain to function,

1:52:51.260 --> 1:52:53.360
 allows your nervous system to function at all.

1:52:53.360 --> 1:52:55.400
 Again, this is the most basic aspect

1:52:55.400 --> 1:52:57.080
 of nervous system function.

1:52:57.080 --> 1:53:02.080
 And there are cases where this whole system gets disrupted.

1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:06.040
 And that brings us to the topic of sodium and water balance.

1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:08.440
 As many of you have probably heard,

1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:10.700
 but hopefully if you haven't,

1:53:10.700 --> 1:53:13.060
 you'll take this message seriously.

1:53:13.060 --> 1:53:15.800
 If you drink too much water,

1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:17.760
 especially in a short amount of time,

1:53:17.760 --> 1:53:20.360
 you can actually kill yourself, right?

1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:22.680
 And we certainly don't want that to happen.

1:53:22.680 --> 1:53:27.320
 If you ingest a lot of water in a very short period of time,

1:53:27.320 --> 1:53:29.080
 something called the hypernatremia,

1:53:29.080 --> 1:53:32.740
 you will excrete a lot of sodium very quickly

1:53:32.740 --> 1:53:35.040
 and your ability to regulate kidney function

1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:36.140
 will be disrupted.

1:53:36.140 --> 1:53:37.620
 But in addition to that,

1:53:37.620 --> 1:53:39.600
 your brain can actually stop functioning.

1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:43.520
 So people have actually consumed water to excess,

1:53:43.520 --> 1:53:45.820
 especially after sports events and so forth.

1:53:45.820 --> 1:53:49.220
 And if that water doesn't contain sufficient electrolytes,

1:53:49.220 --> 1:53:51.380
 you can actually shut down neurons' ability

1:53:51.380 --> 1:53:54.880
 to function at all by disrupting this balance

1:53:54.880 --> 1:53:56.480
 of sodium and potassium

1:53:56.480 --> 1:53:58.400
 and the amount of extracellular sodium

1:53:58.400 --> 1:54:01.800
 and neurons' ability to signal to one another

1:54:01.800 --> 1:54:03.280
 through action potentials.

1:54:03.280 --> 1:54:04.800
 And I can't emphasize the importance

1:54:04.800 --> 1:54:06.060
 of action potentials enough.

1:54:06.060 --> 1:54:08.200
 They are the way that I can lift my pen right now.

1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:09.180
 They're the way that I can speak.

1:54:09.180 --> 1:54:10.740
 They're the way that you breathe.

1:54:10.740 --> 1:54:12.620
 They literally control all aspects

1:54:12.620 --> 1:54:14.380
 of your nervous system function.

1:54:14.380 --> 1:54:16.120
 Now, it takes quite a lot of water intake

1:54:16.120 --> 1:54:18.040
 before you excrete enough sodium

1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:20.080
 that your nervous system is going to shut down.

1:54:20.080 --> 1:54:21.640
 And I certainly don't want to give the impression

1:54:21.640 --> 1:54:23.280
 that simply by ingesting more sodium,

1:54:23.280 --> 1:54:24.900
 your neurons will work better,

1:54:24.900 --> 1:54:26.320
 but it absolutely is the case

1:54:26.320 --> 1:54:28.780
 that if you don't ingest enough sodium,

1:54:28.780 --> 1:54:31.480
 that your neurons won't function as well as they could,

1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:34.440
 and that if your sodium levels are made too low

1:54:35.580 --> 1:54:40.580
 by hemorrhage or by ingesting so much water, fluid,

1:54:41.420 --> 1:54:44.300
 that you excrete excess amounts of sodium

1:54:44.300 --> 1:54:46.880
 or through any other mechanism, that is,

1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:48.800
 then indeed your neurons won't be able

1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:49.880
 to fire action potentials,

1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:52.280
 and your brain and nervous system simply won't work.

1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:53.720
 And that's one of the primary reasons

1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:56.040
 why dehydration leads to confusion

1:54:56.040 --> 1:54:58.800
 and dizziness and lack of coordination.

1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:00.480
 And I've talked about this a bit

1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:01.920
 in the episode on endurance,

1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:05.760
 but there are instances in which competitive athletes

1:55:05.760 --> 1:55:08.000
 have come into the stadium to finish a final lap

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.840
 of a long endurance race and are completely disoriented

1:55:10.840 --> 1:55:12.880
 and actually can't find their way to the finish line.

1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:15.480
 It might sound like kind of a silly, crazy example,

1:55:15.480 --> 1:55:20.440
 but there are examples of people having severe mental issues

1:55:20.440 --> 1:55:22.940
 and physical issues post-exercise

1:55:22.940 --> 1:55:25.200
 when that exercise involved a ton of sweating

1:55:25.200 --> 1:55:28.240
 or hot environments or insufficient ingestion of fluids

1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:30.120
 and electrolytes because included

1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:32.760
 in the electrolyte formula, of course, is sodium.

1:55:32.760 --> 1:55:33.720
 And as you just learned,

1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:36.940
 sodium is absolutely crucial for neurons to function.

1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:40.720
 So to briefly recap some of what I've talked about today,

1:55:40.720 --> 1:55:42.960
 we talked about how the brain monitors

1:55:42.960 --> 1:55:45.160
 the amount of salt in your brain and body

1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:47.200
 and how that relates to thirst

1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:51.760
 and the drive to consume more fluid and or salty fluids.

1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:53.880
 We also talked a little bit about the hormones

1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:55.480
 that come from the brain and operate at the level

1:55:55.480 --> 1:55:58.940
 of the kidney in order to either retain

1:55:58.940 --> 1:56:02.680
 or allow water to leave your system.

1:56:02.680 --> 1:56:04.040
 We talked a little bit about the function

1:56:04.040 --> 1:56:06.880
 of the kidney itself, a beautiful organ.

1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:11.080
 We talked about the relationship between salt intake

1:56:11.080 --> 1:56:12.880
 and various health parameters

1:56:12.880 --> 1:56:17.880
 and how a particular range of salt intake might be optimal

1:56:18.640 --> 1:56:21.200
 depending on the context in which

1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:22.360
 that range is being consumed,

1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:25.520
 meaning depending on whether or not you're hypertensive,

1:56:25.520 --> 1:56:27.920
 pre-hypertensive, or normal tension.

1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:30.340
 We talked about fluid intake and electrolyte intake,

1:56:30.340 --> 1:56:32.040
 so sodium, potassium, and magnesium

1:56:32.040 --> 1:56:35.320
 in the context of athletic or sports performance,

1:56:35.320 --> 1:56:37.600
 but also in terms of maintaining cognitive function.

1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:39.200
 Talked about the Galpin equation,

1:56:39.200 --> 1:56:41.960
 which you could easily adapt to your body weight

1:56:41.960 --> 1:56:43.940
 and to your circumstances.

1:56:43.940 --> 1:56:46.880
 Of course, adjusting the amount of fluid

1:56:46.880 --> 1:56:51.080
 and electrolyte intake upwards if you're exercising

1:56:51.080 --> 1:56:53.020
 or working in very hot environments,

1:56:53.020 --> 1:56:56.100
 downwards maybe if you're in less hot environments

1:56:56.100 --> 1:56:57.840
 where you're sweating less and so on.

1:56:57.840 --> 1:56:59.240
 We also talked about the relationship

1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:02.880
 between the stress system and the salt craving system

1:57:02.880 --> 1:57:05.360
 and why those two systems interact

1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:10.280
 and why for some people who may suffer a bit from anxiety

1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:12.240
 or under conditions of stress,

1:57:12.240 --> 1:57:14.320
 increasing salt intake provided it's done

1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:18.040
 through healthy means might actually be beneficial.

1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:19.260
 We also talked about conditions

1:57:19.260 --> 1:57:22.360
 in which increasing salt intake might be beneficial

1:57:22.360 --> 1:57:24.940
 for offsetting low blood pressure

1:57:24.940 --> 1:57:26.600
 and some of these postural syndromes

1:57:26.600 --> 1:57:29.080
 that can lead people to dizziness and so forth.

1:57:29.080 --> 1:57:30.580
 These are things that have to be explored

1:57:30.580 --> 1:57:34.000
 on an individual basis and of course have to be explored

1:57:34.000 --> 1:57:35.920
 with the support of your doctor.

1:57:35.920 --> 1:57:37.440
 I mentioned the salt fix,

1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:39.280
 which I think is an interesting read,

1:57:39.280 --> 1:57:41.440
 keeping in mind that a lot of the information in there

1:57:41.440 --> 1:57:43.600
 runs counter to the typical narrative

1:57:43.600 --> 1:57:45.040
 that you hear around salt,

1:57:45.040 --> 1:57:47.260
 but nonetheless has some very interesting points

1:57:47.260 --> 1:57:48.880
 that you might want to consider

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:52.560
 and certainly will broaden your view of the history of

1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:54.200
 and the applications of salt

1:57:54.200 --> 1:57:56.480
 as it relates to a great number

1:57:56.480 --> 1:57:58.400
 of health and performance metrics.

1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:00.760
 We also talked about the perception of salt,

1:58:00.760 --> 1:58:02.780
 meaning the perception of salty tastes

1:58:02.780 --> 1:58:04.360
 and how the perception of salty tastes

1:58:04.360 --> 1:58:06.580
 and the perception of other tastes like sweet

1:58:06.580 --> 1:58:08.220
 can interact with one another

1:58:08.220 --> 1:58:11.140
 to drive things like increased sugar intake

1:58:11.140 --> 1:58:12.720
 when you're not even aware of it.

1:58:12.720 --> 1:58:16.500
 And indeed how the combination of salty and sweet tastes

1:58:16.500 --> 1:58:19.200
 can bias you towards craving more,

1:58:19.200 --> 1:58:20.580
 for instance, processed foods

1:58:20.580 --> 1:58:22.780
 and why that might be a good thing to avoid.

1:58:22.780 --> 1:58:24.640
 And of course, we talked about salt

1:58:24.640 --> 1:58:27.220
 and its critical role in the action potential,

1:58:27.220 --> 1:58:28.240
 the fundamental way in which

1:58:28.240 --> 1:58:30.460
 the nervous system functions at all.

1:58:30.460 --> 1:58:33.040
 So my hope for you in listening to this episode

1:58:33.040 --> 1:58:36.380
 is that you consider a question and that question is

1:58:36.380 --> 1:58:39.520
 what salt intake is best for you

1:58:39.520 --> 1:58:41.060
 and that you place that question

1:58:41.060 --> 1:58:44.120
 in the context of your fluid intake,

1:58:44.120 --> 1:58:47.160
 you place that in the context of the diet you're following,

1:58:47.160 --> 1:58:50.360
 the amount of caffeine you might be ingesting

1:58:50.360 --> 1:58:52.520
 and the diuretic effects of caffeine

1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:55.680
 and crucially that you place that in the context

1:58:55.680 --> 1:58:58.120
 of the electrolytes more generally,

1:58:58.120 --> 1:59:01.320
 meaning sodium, potassium, and magnesium.

1:59:01.320 --> 1:59:05.220
 Someday there will be an online program or an app I imagine

1:59:05.220 --> 1:59:08.880
 where one could put a bunch of different parameters in

1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:12.560
 about their particular health status,

1:59:12.560 --> 1:59:15.440
 their particular diet, their particular exercise, et cetera.

1:59:15.440 --> 1:59:18.300
 Maybe it would all be run by AI algorithm or something

1:59:18.300 --> 1:59:20.040
 where it would monitor all of that for us

1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:23.940
 and then it would spit out for us a precise amount of sodium

1:59:23.940 --> 1:59:25.760
 that we should take in each day.

1:59:25.760 --> 1:59:29.360
 Unfortunately, no such tool or device exists right now

1:59:29.360 --> 1:59:32.000
 and so all of us have to figure out

1:59:32.000 --> 1:59:34.880
 the appropriate amount of sodium intake for ourselves

1:59:34.880 --> 1:59:36.360
 and that has to be done

1:59:36.360 --> 1:59:39.240
 under these contextual considerations.

1:59:39.240 --> 1:59:41.520
 Who knows, maybe one of you will design such an app

1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:44.180
 or such a device, I think it would be very useful.

1:59:45.340 --> 1:59:49.240
 If nothing else, today's discussion ought to illuminate

1:59:49.240 --> 1:59:53.880
 the fact that some strict recommendation of salt intake

1:59:53.880 --> 1:59:56.760
 cannot be made universally across the board for everybody.

1:59:56.760 --> 1:59:59.360
 There's just simply no way that could be done

1:59:59.360 --> 2:00:03.240
 and yet I think most of what we've learned about salt

2:00:03.240 --> 2:00:05.680
 in the general discussions around health

2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:07.940
 are that it's this evil substance.

2:00:07.940 --> 2:00:09.340
 Nothing could be further from the truth.

2:00:09.340 --> 2:00:10.980
 It's an incredible substance.

2:00:10.980 --> 2:00:13.480
 Our physiology is dependent on it.

2:00:13.480 --> 2:00:16.200
 Our cognition is dependent on it.

2:00:16.200 --> 2:00:18.920
 Indeed, our mental and physical health and our performance

2:00:18.920 --> 2:00:21.960
 in essentially all aspects of life is dependent on it

2:00:21.960 --> 2:00:24.180
 and I hope I've been able to illuminate

2:00:24.180 --> 2:00:26.040
 some of the beautiful ways in which the brain

2:00:26.040 --> 2:00:27.880
 and the bodily organs interact

2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:29.640
 in order to help us regulate this thing

2:00:29.640 --> 2:00:31.080
 that we call sodium balance

2:00:31.080 --> 2:00:33.180
 and the fact that we have neurons in our brain

2:00:33.180 --> 2:00:37.500
 that are both tuned to the levels of salt in our body

2:00:37.500 --> 2:00:40.120
 and positioned in a location in the brain

2:00:40.120 --> 2:00:42.920
 that allows them to detect the levels of salt in our body

2:00:42.920 --> 2:00:46.120
 and to drive the intake of more or less salt

2:00:46.120 --> 2:00:48.880
 and more or less fluid and other electrolytes

2:00:48.880 --> 2:00:51.460
 really just points to the beauty of the system

2:00:51.460 --> 2:00:52.760
 that we've all evolved

2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:54.700
 that allows us to interact with our environment

2:00:54.700 --> 2:00:57.140
 and make adjustments according to the context

2:00:57.140 --> 2:00:58.960
 of our daily and ongoing life.

2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:01.360

 We do read all those comments.

2:01:32.580 --> 2:01:34.360
 Please also check out our sponsors mentioned

2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:35.800
 at the beginning of today's episode.

2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:38.040
 That's the best way to support this podcast.

2:01:38.040 --> 2:01:39.480
 We also have a Patreon.

2:01:39.480 --> 2:01:42.360
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman

2:01:42.360 --> 2:01:44.160
 and there you can support the podcast

2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:45.700
 at any level that you like.

2:01:45.700 --> 2:01:48.100
 During today's episode and on many previous episodes

2:01:48.100 --> 2:01:51.540
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.

2:01:51.540 --> 2:01:53.720
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:55.960
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:01:55.960 --> 2:02:00.240
 for things like enhancing sleep and focus and so on.

2:02:00.240 --> 2:02:01.640
 One issue with supplements, however,

2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:04.700
 is that the quality of supplements varies tremendously

2:02:04.700 --> 2:02:06.200
 from one brand to the next.

2:02:06.200 --> 2:02:09.200
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:12.020
 because Thorne supplements are of the absolute

2:02:12.020 --> 2:02:14.840
 highest quality in terms of the ingredients they include

2:02:14.840 --> 2:02:17.180
 and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients

2:02:17.180 --> 2:02:19.360
 they include, meaning what's listed on the bottle

2:02:19.360 --> 2:02:22.000
 is what's actually contained in that product.

2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:23.820
 They've partnered with all the major sports teams

2:02:23.820 --> 2:02:26.540
 and with the Mayo Clinic, so trust is very, very high

2:02:26.540 --> 2:02:28.760
 with respect to the quality of Thorne products.

2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:31.020
 If you'd like to see the Thorne supplements that I take,

2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:35.300
 you can go to Thorne, that's thorne.com slash the letter U

2:02:35.300 --> 2:02:38.120
 slash Huberman, and you can get 20% off

2:02:38.120 --> 2:02:39.860
 any of those Thorne supplements.

2:02:39.860 --> 2:02:42.380
 In addition, if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

2:02:42.380 --> 2:02:45.900
 through that portal, thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

2:02:45.900 --> 2:02:49.080
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

2:02:49.080 --> 2:02:50.560
 that Thorne makes.

2:02:50.560 --> 2:02:52.360
 If you're not already following Huberman Lab

2:02:52.360 --> 2:02:54.720
 on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

2:02:54.720 --> 2:02:57.180
 There, I cover science and science-based tools

2:02:57.180 --> 2:03:00.120
 that sometimes overlaps with the content of this podcast,

2:03:00.120 --> 2:03:03.700
 but sometimes is distinct from the content of this podcast.

2:03:03.700 --> 2:03:06.020
 We also have a neural network newsletter.

2:03:06.020 --> 2:03:08.300
 The neural network newsletter comes out once a month.

2:03:08.300 --> 2:03:09.800
 It is zero cost.

2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:11.580
 You sign up for it by providing your email.

2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:13.880
 We do not share your email with anybody.

2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:15.940
 The privacy policy is made very clear,

2:03:15.940 --> 2:03:17.880
 and you can sign up for the neural network newsletter

2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:19.860
 by going to HubermanLab.com.

2:03:19.860 --> 2:03:22.600
 Just go into the menu, scroll down to neural network,

2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:24.760
 and you can sign up, and even without signing up,

2:03:24.760 --> 2:03:26.820
 you can access some of the previous newsletters

2:03:26.820 --> 2:03:28.680
 if you'd like to see what they are like.

2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:31.040
 We include short summaries from podcasts,

2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:33.500
 some key takeaways, and some resources and tools

2:03:33.500 --> 2:03:35.520
 that you won't find anywhere else.

2:03:35.520 --> 2:03:37.440
 Thank you once again for joining me today

2:03:37.440 --> 2:03:41.560
 to discuss the neuroscience and the physiology around salt

2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:45.120
 and its many incredible influences on our brain and body.

2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:47.520
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:49.320
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:58.920
 And I'll see you next time.
