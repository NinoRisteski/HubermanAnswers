00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.280
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.280 --> 00:13.340
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.340 --> 00:15.240
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.240 --> 00:18.040
 Today, my guest is Dr. Emily Balchetes.

00:18.040 --> 00:20.240
 Dr. Balchetes is a professor of psychology

00:20.240 --> 00:21.880
 at New York University.

00:21.880 --> 00:24.920
 Her laboratory studies motivation, goal setting,

00:24.920 --> 00:28.240
 and tools for successful goal completion.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.120
 I learned about Dr. Balchetes' work some years ago

00:31.120 --> 00:33.060
 because I'm a vision scientist.

00:33.060 --> 00:34.880
 That is, I study the visual system.

00:34.880 --> 00:37.100
 And I heard about this incredible psychologist

00:37.100 --> 00:40.880
 at New York University who was studying how vision,

00:40.880 --> 00:42.800
 that is how we visualize problems,

00:42.800 --> 00:44.180
 can predict whether or not

00:44.180 --> 00:46.480
 we will successfully overcome challenges

00:46.480 --> 00:51.120
 and how we strategize in order to set and meet goals.

00:51.120 --> 00:54.240
 And in 2020, I learned of Dr. Balchetes' book,

00:54.240 --> 00:56.000
 which was written for the general public,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.100
 entitled, Clear, Closer, Better,

00:58.100 --> 01:00.320
 How Successful People See the World.

01:00.320 --> 01:02.600
 And I read both the hard copy of the book

01:02.600 --> 01:04.560
 and listened to the audio book.

01:04.560 --> 01:06.920
 And I absolutely loved the material.

01:06.920 --> 01:10.040
 As you'll learn directly from Dr. Balchetes today,

01:10.040 --> 01:12.260
 how people visualize a problem,

01:12.260 --> 01:15.280
 that is whether or not they think of a goal or a problem

01:15.280 --> 01:17.980
 as residing at the top of a very steep hill

01:17.980 --> 01:21.560
 or on the top of a shallower hill,

01:21.560 --> 01:24.540
 or whether or not they visualize a goal or a problem

01:24.540 --> 01:26.000
 as far off in the distance

01:26.000 --> 01:28.480
 or closer to them in the distance,

01:28.480 --> 01:30.680
 visually in their mind,

01:30.680 --> 01:33.400
 strongly dictates whether or not they will arrive

01:33.400 --> 01:35.360
 at the challenge of meeting a goal

01:35.360 --> 01:38.640
 or overcoming a problem with more energy or less energy.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.180
 Indeed, it dictates whether or not

01:40.180 --> 01:42.920
 they can push to immediate milestones

01:42.920 --> 01:44.900
 or whether or not they will think they have to overcome

01:44.900 --> 01:46.800
 the entire task all at once.

01:46.800 --> 01:50.920
 Basically, Dr. Balchetes' work has discovered

01:50.920 --> 01:55.320
 that how we visualize a problem or a goal in our mind

01:55.320 --> 01:58.200
 has everything to do with how we lean into that goal,

01:58.200 --> 02:01.440
 whether or not we think of it as overwhelming or tractable,

02:01.440 --> 02:03.740
 whether or not we think that we can overcome that goal

02:03.740 --> 02:07.080
 and then it will lead to yet more possible rewards and goals

02:07.080 --> 02:09.520
 or whether or not we feel that we're going to arrive

02:09.520 --> 02:12.580
 at the finish line and then just be overwhelmed with fatigue.

02:12.580 --> 02:16.160
 In other words, how you visualize things in your mind,

02:16.160 --> 02:18.080
 and when I say visualize, I mean literally

02:18.080 --> 02:22.480
 how you visualize them as a visual problem or a visual goal

02:22.480 --> 02:24.720
 has everything to do with whether or not

02:24.720 --> 02:26.480
 you will be able to meet those goals

02:26.480 --> 02:29.080
 and whether or not they will lead to still greater goals

02:29.080 --> 02:31.000
 that you will be able to achieve.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.400
 Today's episode is an especially important one, I believe,

02:33.400 --> 02:34.440
 because you're going to learn

02:34.440 --> 02:37.120
 about quality peer-reviewed science

02:37.120 --> 02:39.160
 from the expert in this field

02:39.160 --> 02:41.040
 of goal setting, motivation, and pursuit.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.440
 And you're also going to learn an immense number

02:43.440 --> 02:45.600
 of practical tools that you can apply

02:45.600 --> 02:47.960
 toward your educational goals, your career goals,

02:47.960 --> 02:50.800
 relationship goals, goals of any sort.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.200
 By the end of today's episode,

02:52.200 --> 02:56.480
 you will be better equipped to set and achieve your goals.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.840
 Dr. Balchetes also shares with us her own experiences

02:59.840 --> 03:03.640
 of how to set, visualize, and achieve goals.

03:03.640 --> 03:07.520
 And she does that within the context of her role as a parent,

03:07.520 --> 03:10.080
 as somebody navigating relationships of various kinds

03:10.080 --> 03:11.520
 and a demanding career.

03:11.520 --> 03:14.160
 So again, I think that you'll find the information today

03:14.160 --> 03:17.840
 to be both extremely academically grounded

03:17.840 --> 03:22.320
 in terms of research, extremely practical, and realistic

03:22.320 --> 03:24.780
 in terms of how you might apply it in your own life.

03:24.780 --> 03:26.680
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:26.680 --> 03:29.000
 is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.220
 We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.

03:31.220 --> 03:32.920
 First of all, they ship internationally

03:32.920 --> 03:34.840
 because we know that many of you are located

03:34.840 --> 03:36.600
 outside of the United States.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.680
 That's valuable.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.720
 Second of all, and perhaps most important,

03:39.720 --> 03:42.240
 the quality of their supplements is second to none,

03:42.240 --> 03:43.920
 both in terms of purity and precision

03:43.920 --> 03:45.880
 of the amounts of the ingredients.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.500
 Third, we've really emphasized supplements

03:48.500 --> 03:50.680
 that are single ingredient supplements

03:50.680 --> 03:52.760
 and that are supplied in dosages

03:52.760 --> 03:55.720
 that allow you to build a supplementation protocol

03:55.720 --> 03:57.560
 that's optimized for cost,

03:57.560 --> 03:59.440
 that's optimized for effectiveness,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.600
 and that you can add things and remove things

04:01.600 --> 04:02.920
 from your protocol in a way

04:02.920 --> 04:04.620
 that's really systematic and scientific.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.960
 This is really hard to do

04:05.960 --> 04:07.840
 if you're taking blends of different supplements

04:07.840 --> 04:10.580
 or if the dosages are such that you can't titrate,

04:10.580 --> 04:13.960
 or that is adjust the dosages of a given supplement.

04:13.960 --> 04:16.600
 So by using single ingredient supplements,

04:16.600 --> 04:18.280
 you can really build out the supplement kit

04:18.280 --> 04:21.400
 that's ideal for you and your specific needs.

04:21.400 --> 04:22.560
 If you'd like to see the supplements

04:22.560 --> 04:23.880
 that we partner with Momentus on,

04:23.880 --> 04:27.000
 you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.120
 There you'll see those supplements,

04:28.120 --> 04:30.600
 and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding

04:30.600 --> 04:33.280
 the library of supplements available through Momentus

04:33.280 --> 04:34.240
 on a regular basis.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.920
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.560
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

04:39.560 --> 04:42.420
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:42.420 --> 04:44.440
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:44.440 --> 04:46.940
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:46.940 --> 04:49.740
 and science-related tools to the general public.

04:49.740 --> 04:50.800
 In keeping with that theme,

04:50.800 --> 04:53.640
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.680
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

04:55.680 --> 04:57.960
 Thesis makes custom nootropics.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.920
 And as some of you have probably heard me say before,

04:59.920 --> 05:01.720
 I'm not a fan of the word nootropics

05:01.720 --> 05:04.720
 because nootropics means smart drugs.

05:04.720 --> 05:06.120
 And frankly, as a neuroscientist,

05:06.120 --> 05:08.920
 the notion of a smart drug is somewhat ridiculous.

05:08.920 --> 05:09.780
 Why?

05:09.780 --> 05:12.200
 Well, it turns out that we have neural circuits in our brain

05:12.200 --> 05:14.360
 that get engaged for creativity

05:14.360 --> 05:18.000
 and yet other neural circuits that are engaged for focus

05:18.000 --> 05:19.240
 and still other neural circuits

05:19.240 --> 05:20.580
 that are engaged for task switching.

05:20.580 --> 05:23.040
 So the notion of a smart drug

05:23.040 --> 05:26.040
 or a drug that can induce smartness, if you will,

05:26.040 --> 05:28.360
 is simply not grounded in science.

05:28.360 --> 05:30.080
 Well, Thesis understands this

05:30.080 --> 05:32.420
 and has developed custom nootropics

05:32.420 --> 05:35.740
 that are tailored to the specific types of cognitive demands

05:35.740 --> 05:38.380
 or physical demands that you might be facing.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.920
 If you go to Thesis' website,

05:39.920 --> 05:42.320
 you can take a quiz and from that,

05:42.320 --> 05:44.400
 they'll give you a sample of different nootropics

05:44.400 --> 05:46.320
 that you can try so that you can create

05:46.320 --> 05:49.420
 a customized kit of nootropics for your specific needs.

05:49.420 --> 05:51.700
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

05:51.700 --> 05:54.700
 just go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

05:54.700 --> 05:55.760
 take that three minute quiz

05:55.760 --> 05:57.780
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

05:57.780 --> 05:59.120
 to try in your first month.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.320
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

06:01.320 --> 06:03.240
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

06:03.240 --> 06:05.520
 to get 10% off your first box.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.740
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Levels.

06:07.740 --> 06:10.300
 Levels is what's called a continuous glucose monitor.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.080
 Some of you may have heard of these before,

06:12.080 --> 06:14.140
 others of you perhaps have not.

06:14.140 --> 06:15.120
 Basically, it's a small device

06:15.120 --> 06:16.240
 that you wear in the back of your arm.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.980
 It's an app that you install on your phone

06:17.980 --> 06:20.960
 and whether or not you are fasting or you just ate

06:20.960 --> 06:22.680
 or you ate several hours ago,

06:22.680 --> 06:25.340
 you can get a real-time measurement of your blood glucose,

06:25.340 --> 06:27.860
 which turns out to be extremely informative.

06:27.860 --> 06:30.560
 I first started using the Levels continuous glucose monitor

06:30.560 --> 06:33.020
 about a year ago and it's taught me so much

06:33.020 --> 06:34.960
 about how I respond to specific foods

06:34.960 --> 06:36.740
 in terms of blood sugar spikes,

06:36.740 --> 06:38.220
 how I respond to exercise.

06:38.220 --> 06:39.420
 Even the sauna, it turns out,

06:39.420 --> 06:41.740
 can modulate my blood glucose levels

06:41.740 --> 06:44.740
 and your blood glucose levels in very interesting ways.

06:44.740 --> 06:47.220
 So all of that is translated into a huge number

06:47.220 --> 06:49.220
 of very directed changes that I've made

06:49.220 --> 06:51.020
 in terms of what I eat, when I eat,

06:51.020 --> 06:53.740
 and how I schedule exercise relative to eating

06:53.740 --> 06:55.260
 and sleep, et cetera.

06:55.260 --> 06:56.380
 If you're interested in trying

06:56.380 --> 06:58.580
 the Levels continuous glucose monitor yourself,

06:58.580 --> 07:01.620
 you can simply go to levels.link slash Huberman.

07:01.620 --> 07:04.060
 That's levels.link slash Huberman.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.260
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roka.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.540
 Roka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

07:08.540 --> 07:10.360
 that are of the absolute highest quality,

07:10.360 --> 07:12.820
 and they also have some unique characteristics.

07:12.820 --> 07:14.980
 The company was founded by two All-American swimmers

07:14.980 --> 07:17.400
 from Stanford, and everything about Roka eyeglasses

07:17.400 --> 07:20.520
 and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind.

07:20.520 --> 07:23.580
 Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses can be worn while running

07:23.580 --> 07:24.400
 or cycling.

07:24.400 --> 07:26.540
 If you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face,

07:26.540 --> 07:27.860
 and they're extremely lightweight.

07:27.860 --> 07:28.700
 In fact, most of the time,

07:28.700 --> 07:30.340
 I can't even remember that I'm wearing them.

07:30.340 --> 07:32.620
 I wear Roka eyeglasses when I read at night,

07:32.620 --> 07:33.840
 so I wear their readers,

07:33.840 --> 07:36.520
 and I wear sunglasses at various times throughout the day.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.560
 The great thing about Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

07:38.560 --> 07:39.920
 is that even though they were designed

07:39.920 --> 07:42.860
 for athletic performance, they have a terrific aesthetic.

07:42.860 --> 07:45.420
 So unlike a lot of so-called performance glasses

07:45.420 --> 07:48.260
 that make people look like cyborgs, in my opinion,

07:48.260 --> 07:50.020
 Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses are the sort

07:50.020 --> 07:51.080
 that you could wear out to dinner,

07:51.080 --> 07:52.260
 that you could wear to work.

07:52.260 --> 07:53.700
 They have a terrific aesthetic.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.880
 If you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses or sunglasses,

07:55.880 --> 07:58.280
 you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A dot com,

07:58.280 --> 08:00.740
 and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off

08:00.740 --> 08:01.580
 your first order.

08:01.580 --> 08:03.860
 Again, that's Roka, R-O-K-A dot com,

08:03.860 --> 08:06.060
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

08:06.060 --> 08:09.540
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Emily Belchettis.

08:09.540 --> 08:10.700
 Well, thanks for being here.

08:10.700 --> 08:11.660
 That's my pleasure.

08:11.660 --> 08:14.860
 Yeah, I've been looking forward to this for a long time

08:14.860 --> 08:18.860
 because as a vision scientist who is also very interested

08:18.860 --> 08:21.980
 in real life tools and goal setting and motivation,

08:21.980 --> 08:25.520
 your work lands squarely in the middle of those interests.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.100
 So just to kick things off,

08:28.100 --> 08:30.140
 you could tell us just a little bit

08:30.140 --> 08:33.780
 about the relationship between perception

08:33.780 --> 08:35.820
 and in particular, how we see the world

08:35.820 --> 08:39.540
 and goal setting and goal retrieval.

08:39.540 --> 08:42.340
 It's a vast landscape, but you're the expert.

08:42.340 --> 08:44.060
 So I'll turn that over to you.

08:44.060 --> 08:46.660
 And then as time goes on,

08:46.660 --> 08:48.040
 I may have some additional questions

08:48.040 --> 08:49.540
 as it relates to different kinds of vision,

08:49.540 --> 08:51.980
 but what's the deal with vision and motivation?

08:51.980 --> 08:53.340
 How do those two things link up?

08:53.340 --> 08:54.180
 Totally.

08:55.340 --> 08:57.500
 When psychologists ask people,

08:57.500 --> 08:59.520
 what are you doing to help make progress on your goals?

08:59.520 --> 09:00.580
 They say all kinds of things,

09:00.580 --> 09:02.380
 a couple of things always pop to the top,

09:02.380 --> 09:05.060
 which is try to shock myself in encouraging ways

09:05.060 --> 09:06.820
 and self pep talks,

09:06.820 --> 09:10.460
 or I remind myself of how important it is to do this job,

09:10.460 --> 09:13.660
 or I'll put up post-it notes around

09:13.660 --> 09:16.540
 to constantly be nagging me about what I need to do.

09:16.540 --> 09:18.340
 So those are common tactics that people use.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.660
 And what we'll notice is that those are really effortful,

09:20.660 --> 09:22.160
 having to constantly remind yourself,

09:22.160 --> 09:23.580
 having to constantly talk to yourself,

09:23.580 --> 09:25.060
 having to create those post-it notes,

09:25.060 --> 09:25.940
 remember to look at them.

09:25.940 --> 09:29.260
 All of that takes a lot of time and effort and commitment.

09:29.260 --> 09:32.140
 And so what a surprise that people burn out, right?

09:32.140 --> 09:35.100
 It's exciting to work on a goal when you first set it,

09:35.100 --> 09:36.620
 you might make some initial progress,

09:36.620 --> 09:38.820
 but then eventually we get, you know,

09:38.820 --> 09:40.340
 not even to the halfway point,

09:40.340 --> 09:42.900
 but before things get real,

09:42.900 --> 09:45.380
 things are challenging and we fall by the wayside.

09:45.380 --> 09:46.300
 And that's, I think,

09:46.300 --> 09:49.980
 because those tactics that are our go-to strategies

09:49.980 --> 09:52.000
 are themselves a goal to maintain.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.140
 So it's like, you know, double-sided,

09:54.140 --> 09:55.540
 we're putting so much on ourselves

09:55.540 --> 09:57.140
 to try to advance the thing

09:57.140 --> 09:59.740
 that we originally set out to accomplish.

09:59.740 --> 10:01.160
 So then I, you know, with my team,

10:01.160 --> 10:02.240
 I was trying to think of like, well,

10:02.240 --> 10:04.300
 what are strategies that don't require as much effort

10:04.300 --> 10:05.140
 that we can automate,

10:05.140 --> 10:07.160
 that we can take advantage of what's already happening

10:07.160 --> 10:10.100
 within ourselves, within our body, within our mind,

10:10.100 --> 10:13.060
 that might overcome one of those challenges

10:13.060 --> 10:15.140
 that'll be easier, more automated.

10:15.140 --> 10:17.820
 And that's when we started to land on the idea of vision.

10:17.820 --> 10:20.540
 We look at the world without even thinking of it

10:20.540 --> 10:22.700
 for those of us that are sighted.

10:22.700 --> 10:24.260
 And we thought, you know what,

10:24.260 --> 10:27.740
 there are strategies that we can use to look at the world

10:27.740 --> 10:30.540
 in a different way and that we can automate

10:30.540 --> 10:34.420
 that might help us to overcome some obstacles,

10:34.420 --> 10:35.700
 to make progress on our goals,

10:35.700 --> 10:38.100
 to maybe literally see opportunities

10:38.100 --> 10:40.260
 that we hadn't been able to see before.

10:40.260 --> 10:41.460
 So we started playing around

10:41.460 --> 10:44.020
 with the idea of visual illusions to see like,

10:44.020 --> 10:45.460
 do people even know that there's other ways

10:45.460 --> 10:47.060
 of seeing things around them?

10:47.060 --> 10:48.020
 Can we tweak that?

10:48.020 --> 10:49.660
 Or is there room for intervention?

10:49.660 --> 10:53.160
 Can we encourage people to take a new way of looking

10:53.160 --> 10:55.420
 to see things that they hadn't seen before?

10:55.420 --> 10:56.780
 And that's what really opened us up

10:56.780 --> 10:58.340
 to trying to look at that intersection

10:58.340 --> 11:02.860
 between vision science and motivation science.

11:02.860 --> 11:03.700
 It's great.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.860
 And I always say, and here I'm strongly biased

11:06.860 --> 11:09.540
 as a vision scientist that vision is the dominant sense

11:09.540 --> 11:11.660
 by which we navigate the world and survive.

11:11.660 --> 11:16.180
 I love this idea of real world, real time access to vision.

11:16.180 --> 11:19.500
 And I'm certainly familiar with how goal setting

11:19.500 --> 11:22.640
 or post-its and magnets on refrigerators

11:22.640 --> 11:23.820
 can have an immediate impact,

11:23.820 --> 11:25.840
 but then over time they become so part

11:25.840 --> 11:27.540
 of the visual landscape that you overlook them.

11:27.540 --> 11:28.980
 And we know as vision scientists,

11:28.980 --> 11:31.340
 if something is stably in your environment,

11:31.340 --> 11:33.260
 eventually you're blind to it.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.780
 So that makes good sense.

11:34.780 --> 11:38.020
 So you've published a number of studies in this area,

11:38.020 --> 11:40.800
 but maybe you could highlight some of the more,

11:41.820 --> 11:44.460
 what you would consider important findings

11:44.460 --> 11:48.340
 in the area of how people can adjust their vision

11:48.340 --> 11:51.700
 in order to meet goals more quickly and more efficiently.

11:51.700 --> 11:54.460
 And perhaps also how we come,

11:54.460 --> 11:58.580
 we all arrive at goals with different visual perceptions

11:58.580 --> 12:03.060
 and that in some way may divide us into highly motivated

12:03.060 --> 12:04.100
 and less motivated people.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.220
 In other words, what's the link between vision and motivation

12:07.220 --> 12:08.380
 and how can we leverage that

12:08.380 --> 12:09.500
 in order to better reach our goals?

12:09.500 --> 12:10.340
 Totally.

12:10.340 --> 12:12.740
 So, you know, we started thinking about,

12:12.740 --> 12:14.580
 what are the goals that are most important to people

12:14.580 --> 12:16.400
 that they struggle with the most?

12:16.400 --> 12:19.420
 So we asked hundreds, thousands of people

12:19.420 --> 12:20.820
 what their new year's resolutions are.

12:20.820 --> 12:22.300
 We look to all the other polls

12:22.300 --> 12:24.300
 that do the same kind of work.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.420
 And regardless of where you look or who you ask

12:26.420 --> 12:27.420
 or when you ask it,

12:27.420 --> 12:28.420
 people's number one goal

12:28.420 --> 12:30.480
 is something related to their health, right?

12:30.480 --> 12:32.660
 To lose weight, to exercise more,

12:32.660 --> 12:35.700
 to get out, get more steps for mental wellbeing,

12:35.700 --> 12:37.200
 physical wellbeing.

12:37.200 --> 12:42.060
 And that's like the number one goal every January 1st.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.580
 So if we were able to accomplish that goal,

12:44.580 --> 12:46.700
 you think it would drop a little bit in the rankings,

12:46.700 --> 12:49.040
 but it doesn't because it's really hard.

12:49.040 --> 12:51.020
 So we thought, I wonder if there's a way for us

12:51.020 --> 12:52.600
 to make some progress on that,

12:52.600 --> 12:55.100
 on helping people to exercise better, more often,

12:55.100 --> 12:58.380
 stick to it longer and make some progress there.

12:58.380 --> 13:00.020
 We know diets don't work.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.160
 Why don't diets work?

13:01.160 --> 13:03.940
 For the same reason that that self-talk doesn't work

13:03.940 --> 13:08.220
 is that, you know, we go in it full bore, hardcore,

13:08.220 --> 13:09.780
 and it requires a major commitment

13:09.780 --> 13:11.800
 and effort to a lifestyle change.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.180
 So again, we were looking for something

13:13.180 --> 13:15.020
 that might be easier than that

13:15.020 --> 13:17.500
 that could produce big, big payoff, right?

13:17.500 --> 13:19.300
 That's the golden ticket,

13:19.300 --> 13:22.740
 something that requires less effort for a bigger payoff.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.340
 So one of the first things that I did

13:24.340 --> 13:28.140
 was go over to Brooklyn to this old armory building.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.080
 It, you know, used to be a military armory space.

13:31.080 --> 13:31.920
 Yeah.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.740
 I think I know that building.

13:32.740 --> 13:33.580
 Yeah.

13:33.580 --> 13:34.420
 It's a beautiful building now

13:34.420 --> 13:35.320
 that houses a lot of businesses, right?

13:35.320 --> 13:36.420
 With plants on the walls?

13:36.420 --> 13:37.300
 Yeah, there's businesses.

13:37.300 --> 13:40.500
 There's a couple of armories all around the boroughs here,

13:40.500 --> 13:41.760
 around New York City.

13:41.760 --> 13:45.660
 And the one in Brooklyn in particular is now YMCA, right?

13:45.660 --> 13:47.260
 So it's a family YMCA.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.740
 That's within this beautiful old red brick building

13:49.740 --> 13:53.140
 that used to be a military establishment long, long ago.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.560
 And what's really cool is that, you know,

13:54.560 --> 13:57.340
 one winter after afternoon, you know,

13:57.340 --> 14:00.100
 somebody had invited me, a physical therapist,

14:00.100 --> 14:00.940
 said, hey, you should come out

14:00.940 --> 14:02.100
 and check out what's happening here

14:02.100 --> 14:03.500
 with your interest in exercise

14:03.500 --> 14:05.780
 and trying to find new ways of helping people,

14:05.780 --> 14:08.380
 new tactics that they can add to their tool belt.

14:08.380 --> 14:09.860
 I think you're gonna find some interesting people

14:09.860 --> 14:11.100
 that are working out there.

14:11.100 --> 14:11.940
 So I showed up.

14:11.940 --> 14:13.540
 I look around, you know, there's families,

14:13.540 --> 14:15.980
 there's new moms, there's kids that are, you know,

14:15.980 --> 14:18.900
 moms trying to get kids to burn off some winter,

14:18.900 --> 14:20.300
 you know, energy that they have.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.700
 There's people that look like they're just there

14:21.700 --> 14:23.640
 for their, you know, every couple of days

14:23.640 --> 14:24.540
 going out for a run.

14:24.540 --> 14:25.420
 There's some people that look like

14:25.420 --> 14:26.820
 they're training with a team.

14:26.820 --> 14:29.860
 And that's who this physical therapist introduced me to,

14:29.860 --> 14:32.040
 is the, was the coach of this team.

14:32.040 --> 14:33.300
 There's a bunch of people that were sitting down

14:33.300 --> 14:35.960
 on the ground and I would be hard pressed to know

14:35.960 --> 14:37.940
 who's the high school student that's in this group

14:37.940 --> 14:39.700
 and then who, as it turns out,

14:39.700 --> 14:41.760
 are some of the fastest runners in the world.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.540
 Like, you know, one of the people that was in

14:43.540 --> 14:45.780
 the last Olympics before I showed up,

14:45.780 --> 14:48.460
 won the gold medal for the 400 meter.

14:48.460 --> 14:51.460
 And from the looks of them, I mean, of course,

14:51.460 --> 14:53.920
 their bodies are in better shape than mine,

14:53.920 --> 14:56.220
 but there's nothing so pretentious,

14:56.220 --> 14:57.380
 of course they're not wearing their medals.

14:57.380 --> 14:59.420
 There's nothing pretentious about how they're walking around

14:59.420 --> 15:00.800
 or anything like that that would lead me to know,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.100
 like, this person's amazing.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.740
 And they probably have some insight that I don't have.

15:04.740 --> 15:06.700
 So once I got introduced to them and knew

15:06.700 --> 15:09.560
 who are these people that were part of this

15:09.560 --> 15:12.500
 pretty elite training team that happened to work out

15:12.500 --> 15:16.820
 at this family gym, I had the chance to talk with them

15:16.820 --> 15:18.940
 about what strategies do you use?

15:18.940 --> 15:22.460
 Now, I am not an elite runner and having recently

15:22.460 --> 15:24.780
 had a baby, I'm not really a runner right now at all.

15:24.780 --> 15:27.460
 But I thought when these people are running,

15:27.460 --> 15:29.840
 I bet they are like hyper aware of everything

15:29.840 --> 15:31.380
 that's going on in their surroundings.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.820
 Where are they relative to the competition?

15:33.820 --> 15:35.780
 What's happening in their peripheral vision?

15:35.780 --> 15:36.920
 What's going on on the side?

15:36.920 --> 15:37.760
 Who's behind them?

15:37.760 --> 15:39.140
 Who's in front of them?

15:39.140 --> 15:41.140
 They probably have this like master sense,

15:41.140 --> 15:43.700
 this master visual plan at any point in time.

15:43.700 --> 15:46.220
 And that's what probably makes them elite.

15:46.220 --> 15:48.900
 So when I started asking them, is that the case?

15:48.900 --> 15:51.560
 Do you really pay attention to what's in your surroundings?

15:51.560 --> 15:52.400
 What's behind you?

15:52.400 --> 15:53.220
 What's on the side?

15:53.220 --> 15:54.060
 They said no.

15:54.060 --> 15:55.780
 All of them said no.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.860
 And sometimes when I do do that, it's a mistake.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.140
 It doesn't work for me.

15:59.140 --> 16:00.100
 So that was surprising.

16:00.100 --> 16:03.240
 It totally went against my intuition about what they do

16:03.240 --> 16:05.900
 that likely contributes to their success.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.780
 What they said instead was that they are hyper focused.

16:08.780 --> 16:11.080
 They assume this narrowed focus of attention.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.920
 Almost like a spotlight is shining on a target.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.180
 Now when they're running a short distance,

16:16.180 --> 16:18.060
 that target might literally be the finish line,

16:18.060 --> 16:19.580
 the line that they're trying to cross.

16:19.580 --> 16:21.820
 If it's a longer distance, they set sub goals,

16:21.820 --> 16:24.500
 like the person, the shorts on the person up ahead

16:24.500 --> 16:25.460
 that they're trying to beat.

16:25.460 --> 16:28.100
 Or they choose some sort of stable landmark,

16:28.100 --> 16:31.020
 like a sign that they would pass by.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.180
 And like a spotlight is shining just on that,

16:33.180 --> 16:35.300
 or like they have blinders on the sides of their face.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.580
 That's all they're paying attention to.

16:37.580 --> 16:41.300
 This really narrowed scope of attention.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.300
 And that was a strategy that all of these elite athletes

16:44.300 --> 16:45.140
 said that they used.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.460
 And those that were better rather than slower

16:48.460 --> 16:50.380
 were ones that used it more.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.820
 And I thought, oh, that's something we can play with.

16:52.820 --> 16:55.340
 They are elite and they are accomplished.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.840
 But that visual strategy isn't necessarily something

16:57.840 --> 17:00.040
 that you have to be in the perfect physical condition

17:00.040 --> 17:01.300
 to be able to adopt.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.500
 And so I wonder, can that help the rest of us

17:03.500 --> 17:05.780
 who aren't competing for an Olympic gold

17:05.780 --> 17:07.300
 and who have no chance of ever getting one,

17:07.300 --> 17:11.300
 who want to exercise better, have a better time doing it

17:11.300 --> 17:13.860
 and maintain a commitment to that exercise goal

17:13.860 --> 17:15.900
 that they might have, that they might otherwise,

17:15.900 --> 17:19.020
 by February or March, be giving up on

17:19.020 --> 17:21.700
 if they had set it at the beginning of January.

17:21.700 --> 17:23.500
 So that's really where the work started,

17:23.500 --> 17:26.340
 was what you might call focus groups

17:26.340 --> 17:29.180
 or case studies of these incredible athletes.

17:29.180 --> 17:32.780
 And then we did other studies looking at people

17:32.780 --> 17:35.540
 who aren't Olympic athletes but who are competitive

17:35.540 --> 17:40.100
 and New York road runners and how are they running in races.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.980
 And what we found is that those people who have better pace,

17:41.980 --> 17:45.980
 faster pace, better time, they use that narrowed strategy

17:45.980 --> 17:48.620
 more often than this more expansive

17:48.620 --> 17:51.420
 or open scope of attention.

17:51.420 --> 17:53.420
 And there seemed to be a correlation between that,

17:53.420 --> 17:58.060
 better performance among a wider swath of hundreds of runners

17:58.060 --> 18:00.740
 who are doing it competitively but still could be like

18:00.740 --> 18:03.100
 the person that you're sitting next to in the office

18:03.100 --> 18:04.860
 or yourself, right?

18:04.860 --> 18:07.100
 And the more often that they did it

18:07.100 --> 18:10.220
 and the more consistently they had adopted that,

18:10.220 --> 18:12.300
 that technique of the narrowed focus of attention

18:12.300 --> 18:14.940
 that seemed that they were doing better in their runs.

18:16.100 --> 18:18.220
 So then we started thinking like, okay,

18:18.220 --> 18:21.180
 what about people who aren't competitive runners?

18:21.180 --> 18:24.300
 What about like my mom, can she do that?

18:24.300 --> 18:26.700
 Or me when I'm trying to get back on the bandwagon

18:26.700 --> 18:28.180
 and exercise more.

18:28.180 --> 18:30.140
 Is this a tactic we can teach people?

18:30.140 --> 18:31.660
 The answer is yes.

18:31.660 --> 18:34.140
 You can tell people about what these Olympic athletes

18:34.140 --> 18:35.340
 are doing, you can tell them about

18:35.340 --> 18:38.620
 what the New York Road Runners are doing.

18:38.620 --> 18:39.820
 And just using the same language

18:39.820 --> 18:40.940
 that I just used with you, right?

18:40.940 --> 18:43.540
 Imagine that there's a spotlight shining just on a target.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.980
 Choose something up ahead, the stop sign two blocks up

18:46.980 --> 18:49.220
 that you can just see.

18:49.220 --> 18:51.860
 And imagine that you have blinders on

18:51.860 --> 18:53.220
 so that you're not really paying attention

18:53.220 --> 18:54.420
 to the people that are passing by

18:54.420 --> 18:56.020
 or the buildings or the garbage cans

18:56.020 --> 18:58.420
 or the trucks that are on the road.

18:58.420 --> 19:01.980
 You know, tune those out and focus in on that target

19:01.980 --> 19:04.100
 until you hit it and then choose another one, right?

19:04.100 --> 19:06.140
 So to recalibrate, choose the next goal.

19:07.300 --> 19:09.500
 And so we would test like, can people do that?

19:09.500 --> 19:10.780
 I mean, if you're listening right now,

19:10.780 --> 19:12.980
 you probably are imagining that experience too

19:12.980 --> 19:14.860
 and the answer is yes, like I can imagine that.

19:14.860 --> 19:17.140
 I know what those words mean and I can do that.

19:17.140 --> 19:19.260
 And our work found that too, if people can do that,

19:19.260 --> 19:20.420
 we have them say out loud,

19:20.420 --> 19:22.620
 what is it that's captured your attention?

19:22.620 --> 19:24.420
 And of course, sometimes something in the periphery

19:24.420 --> 19:26.220
 like movement captures our gaze

19:26.220 --> 19:28.620
 and we're pulled there for an instant,

19:28.620 --> 19:30.580
 but then we can refocus up again

19:30.580 --> 19:32.860
 and adopt that narrowed attention.

19:32.860 --> 19:34.460
 And one of the first studies that we did

19:34.460 --> 19:38.300
 was teach that strategy and juxtapose or compare it

19:38.300 --> 19:41.300
 against a group that we said, just look around naturally.

19:41.300 --> 19:43.460
 You know, you might see that finish line up ahead

19:43.460 --> 19:44.780
 and there's things on the periphery,

19:44.780 --> 19:46.060
 whatever your eyes want to do,

19:46.060 --> 19:47.300
 whatever you think is gonna work best,

19:47.300 --> 19:49.980
 feel free to do that and tell us what you're looking at.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.100
 Then we gave them a finish line.

19:51.100 --> 19:53.340
 We created sort of an exercise

19:53.340 --> 19:56.100
 that's moderately challenging, but possible.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.260
 We put ankle weights on that accounted

19:58.260 --> 19:59.980
 for about 15% of their body weight,

19:59.980 --> 20:01.260
 told them to lift their knees up,

20:01.260 --> 20:03.620
 sort of high stepping to a finish line.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.060
 So this would be challenging for them to do,

20:07.060 --> 20:08.100
 but we said, you know,

20:08.100 --> 20:10.540
 it's an indicator of overall health and fitness.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.420
 Some of these people had narrowed their focus of attention

20:13.420 --> 20:17.780
 and some were just looking more expansively or naturally.

20:17.780 --> 20:19.620
 And what we found is that those people that we trained,

20:19.620 --> 20:21.300
 just everyday normal people

20:21.300 --> 20:24.340
 doing this moderately challenging exercise,

20:24.340 --> 20:26.620
 they were able to move 27% faster.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.300
 They could do the exercise more quickly

20:28.300 --> 20:31.740
 and they said it hurt 17% less.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.820
 The exercise was exactly the same for all the people.

20:33.820 --> 20:36.820
 We set the weight and we set the distance.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.460
 It was in our lab space,

20:38.460 --> 20:40.660
 so it was like a constrained environment.

20:40.660 --> 20:43.420
 Everybody was in the same sort of circumstance,

20:43.420 --> 20:45.620
 but yet their experience was really different.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.420
 We helped them to move faster,

20:47.420 --> 20:49.180
 burn calories at a higher rate, right?

20:49.180 --> 20:50.660
 Exercise more efficiently.

20:50.660 --> 20:51.740
 The amount of time they put in

20:51.740 --> 20:55.820
 is gonna produce a better physical outcome.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.380
 And also it didn't hurt them, right?

20:57.380 --> 20:59.420
 They're saying it doesn't hurt as much.

20:59.420 --> 21:01.580
 So we were really excited about that, right?

21:01.580 --> 21:02.900
 Because it meant that this strategy,

21:02.900 --> 21:05.980
 we could use it on people who are not elite athletes.

21:05.980 --> 21:07.500
 It could be easily adopted.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.020
 A quick training session can teach people

21:10.020 --> 21:12.100
 to look at the world in a different way.

21:12.100 --> 21:14.420
 Again, this narrowed attention was different

21:14.420 --> 21:17.940
 than whatever they do naturally, the comparison group,

21:17.940 --> 21:19.380
 but it had a big outcome.

21:19.380 --> 21:20.900
 It had a big difference on the way

21:20.900 --> 21:23.180
 that they were engaged in the exercise.

21:23.180 --> 21:24.940
 That was like some of the first work that we did

21:24.940 --> 21:27.860
 and then since then we've done dozens more studies

21:27.860 --> 21:29.340
 to look at, well, what happens with that

21:29.340 --> 21:32.380
 and what else can we do with playing around with this?

21:32.380 --> 21:34.700
 Yeah, those are impressive differences

21:34.700 --> 21:37.340
 as a consequence of narrowing visual attention.

21:37.340 --> 21:39.060
 A couple of questions about the actual practice

21:39.060 --> 21:40.420
 of narrowing attention.

21:40.420 --> 21:44.220
 Is there any indication of whether or not subjects

21:44.220 --> 21:47.420
 are constantly updating their visual attention?

21:47.420 --> 21:52.020
 So for instance, if let's say the goal line is in view,

21:52.020 --> 21:53.420
 literally from the beginning,

21:53.420 --> 21:55.220
 I could imagine just holding visual attention

21:55.220 --> 22:00.220
 on the goal line, but if it's a oval track

22:00.420 --> 22:03.940
 or it's a trajectory along a trail or through a city,

22:03.940 --> 22:06.220
 how often do you think they are updating

22:06.220 --> 22:11.140
 their visual aperture and setting a visual goal?

22:11.140 --> 22:15.500
 And I could imagine that there's some energetic expense

22:15.500 --> 22:20.300
 to that, meaning you wouldn't want to do every crack

22:20.300 --> 22:22.340
 on the sidewalk unless those cracks on the sidewalk

22:22.340 --> 22:24.700
 were very far apart, because I think at some point

22:24.700 --> 22:27.660
 that itself would be exhausting.

22:27.660 --> 22:32.660
 So is there an optimal strategy or a semi-optimal strategy?

22:33.020 --> 22:35.380
 Yeah, so those Olympic athletes

22:35.380 --> 22:37.100
 that we started by interviewing,

22:37.100 --> 22:38.180
 they tended to be sprinters.

22:38.180 --> 22:40.660
 They were more often sprinters, short distance sprinters.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.060
 So when they said like, yes, I narrow in more

22:43.060 --> 22:45.460
 than I assume an expansive focus,

22:45.460 --> 22:47.740
 that's because they're not going that far, right?

22:47.740 --> 22:49.780
 They have to do it as fast as humanly possible,

22:49.780 --> 22:51.420
 but they're not going that far.

22:51.420 --> 22:53.540
 And so we started asking that question too about like,

22:53.540 --> 22:55.140
 well, wouldn't that be tiring?

22:55.140 --> 22:56.380
 And the answer is yes.

22:56.380 --> 22:57.780
 So when we start to look at, well, people

22:57.780 --> 22:59.300
 who aren't sprinters, who are accomplished,

22:59.300 --> 23:01.500
 but who are more long distance runners,

23:01.500 --> 23:05.860
 that's what we find that they do is that they're using

23:05.860 --> 23:08.460
 that narrow attention strategy strategically

23:08.460 --> 23:10.740
 and it increases in use.

23:10.740 --> 23:13.340
 They use it more often as the race progresses.

23:13.340 --> 23:16.020
 And they really start to do this major switch

23:17.020 --> 23:20.740
 about the halfway point of say like a 10 kilometer run.

23:20.740 --> 23:22.220
 So people who are seasoned runners,

23:22.220 --> 23:23.940
 they really start making a switch

23:23.940 --> 23:26.660
 with what they're looking at about halfway through.

23:26.660 --> 23:29.060
 And that's where they more often, more frequently

23:29.060 --> 23:30.460
 and are more intentionally adopting

23:30.460 --> 23:32.300
 a narrowed focus of attention

23:32.300 --> 23:35.180
 when they're in the last couple miles of a run,

23:35.180 --> 23:38.100
 when maybe their resources are starting to get more thin,

23:38.100 --> 23:40.580
 maybe their motivation is starting to fade.

23:40.580 --> 23:43.140
 That tipping point in the middle is with any kind of goal

23:43.140 --> 23:44.700
 where people struggle the most.

23:45.740 --> 23:47.820
 And that's when they're like doubling down on a strategy

23:47.820 --> 23:49.820
 that they know to be effective.

23:49.820 --> 23:52.500
 So at first, longer distance runners

23:52.500 --> 23:54.860
 are not using that narrowed strategy.

23:54.860 --> 23:57.060
 They're looking more expansively

23:58.060 --> 24:00.340
 because I think that, well, first of all,

24:00.340 --> 24:02.540
 distraction is a thing, it's useful.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.460
 Not necessarily that they're distracting themselves

24:04.460 --> 24:06.580
 because people are still trying to hold pace

24:06.580 --> 24:08.340
 and jostle among probably

24:08.340 --> 24:10.240
 a more concentrated group of runners.

24:11.140 --> 24:12.660
 But it is a strategy that they use

24:12.660 --> 24:16.660
 and then sort of wean off of as the race goes through.

24:16.660 --> 24:19.020
 And it's particularly effective

24:19.020 --> 24:20.940
 when we're looking for that last push, right?

24:20.940 --> 24:22.540
 The last push to get over the finish line

24:22.540 --> 24:25.240
 when like you might be literally neck and neck with somebody

24:25.240 --> 24:28.180
 that you're trying to just beat out

24:28.180 --> 24:29.940
 or when you're most tired,

24:29.940 --> 24:31.500
 but you know like that last push,

24:31.500 --> 24:33.400
 you don't want to drop off.

24:34.380 --> 24:37.200
 And you want to push through hard through that finish line.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.540
 That's when people are using it

24:38.540 --> 24:41.060
 at its peak level of intensity.

24:41.060 --> 24:41.900
 I see.

24:41.900 --> 24:46.140
 Yeah, to me, this makes total sense why it would work

24:46.140 --> 24:50.400
 without going down the rabbit hole of visual neuroscience

24:50.400 --> 24:52.040
 of something for another time.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.120
 When we do these vergence eye movements,

24:54.120 --> 24:55.960
 when we bring our eyes to a visual target,

24:55.960 --> 24:57.960
 it's clear that some of the brainstem circuitry

24:57.960 --> 25:02.960
 for alertness gets engaged to a greater degree.

25:03.280 --> 25:05.040
 The other thing is that we know

25:05.040 --> 25:06.720
 that when we focus on an object,

25:06.720 --> 25:09.720
 that the optics of the eye change

25:09.720 --> 25:11.680
 and narrow the visual field.

25:11.680 --> 25:14.440
 So that brings about, this is a very detailed question,

25:14.440 --> 25:16.760
 but I'm sure the audience is wondering,

25:16.760 --> 25:18.520
 let's say I'm focused on a goal line

25:18.520 --> 25:21.080
 or an intermediate goal.

25:21.080 --> 25:23.040
 Are they focusing on a specific point

25:23.040 --> 25:25.580
 or is it kind of the entire horizon of that goal?

25:25.580 --> 25:28.420
 Because the finish line is indeed a line.

25:28.420 --> 25:30.840
 So, and of course, it's impossible to know

25:30.840 --> 25:33.520
 what someone is actually doing in their mind's eye,

25:33.520 --> 25:34.760
 but how do people report this?

25:34.760 --> 25:37.200
 Do they see it literally as a spotlight?

25:37.200 --> 25:39.480
 And if so, how broad is that spot?

25:39.480 --> 25:44.160
 Yeah, so what is the length of their aperture

25:44.160 --> 25:45.960
 rather than maybe the diameter

25:45.960 --> 25:48.920
 or the sphere size of it?

25:49.960 --> 25:51.600
 In our interviews with people,

25:51.600 --> 25:53.640
 our sort of focus group studies,

25:54.740 --> 25:57.640
 it seems like it's more like a circular point.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.080
 And that's in fact what we're teaching people,

26:00.080 --> 26:01.400
 what we're training them to do.

26:01.400 --> 26:03.160
 So rather than going broadly,

26:03.160 --> 26:06.200
 looking across a line from left to right,

26:06.200 --> 26:09.440
 we are encouraging them to imagine a circle

26:09.440 --> 26:11.400
 of light that's shining on some target.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.240
 Now, of course, the finish line is a line,

26:13.240 --> 26:14.440
 but if they're staying in their lane,

26:14.440 --> 26:15.480
 if they're on a track, right,

26:15.480 --> 26:19.100
 you can imagine that there is a circle shining just on

26:19.100 --> 26:21.020
 where in their lane they'll cross that finish line.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.200
 Or if it's a stop sign,

26:22.200 --> 26:24.960
 you could imagine a circle of light illuminating that.

26:24.960 --> 26:26.600
 So that's what we're teaching people to use.

26:26.600 --> 26:28.440
 And that's what seems to be effective

26:28.440 --> 26:32.300
 to maintain that focus rather than sort of being pulled

26:32.300 --> 26:34.960
 to engage with peripheral vision.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.920
 And there's some amazing people,

26:36.920 --> 26:39.440
 some runners in history, like Joan Benoit Samuelson.

26:39.440 --> 26:43.320
 She's one of the first female marathon competitors

26:43.320 --> 26:46.000
 who has won multiple marathons.

26:46.000 --> 26:46.840
 She's Canadian.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.320
 I think she's won, feel free to correct me,

26:49.320 --> 26:52.340
 like 10 marathons in her life.

26:52.340 --> 26:56.320
 And she talks about sort of not assuming this wide,

26:56.320 --> 27:01.320
 but narrow, wide but not deep or tall attentional focus.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.160
 She talks about finding the shorts on somebody ahead of me

27:06.160 --> 27:09.040
 and focusing on those shorts until she passes them

27:09.040 --> 27:10.680
 and then resetting that goal.

27:10.680 --> 27:14.240
 So in her interviews that she's done with runners magazines,

27:14.240 --> 27:17.860
 she talks about it in terms of this circle of attention.

27:18.800 --> 27:21.320
 I think I've experienced this a little bit

27:21.320 --> 27:24.000
 because we're visiting New York now to do this interview

27:24.000 --> 27:27.200
 and runners here seem more competitive.

27:27.200 --> 27:30.040
 The recreational runners here seem more competitive.

27:30.040 --> 27:31.880
 People walking on the street seem competitive.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.760
 You're walking at near pace to somebody,

27:33.760 --> 27:34.900
 they'll quickly speed up.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.560
 If you speed up, they'll speed up.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.600
 I think there've been some studies about walking speed

27:38.600 --> 27:40.680
 in different cities and New York ranks

27:40.680 --> 27:43.200
 among the fastest walkers around.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.160
 I won't mention the slowest walking cities

27:45.160 --> 27:47.400
 because we don't want to cast any judgments,

27:47.400 --> 27:50.400
 but fascinating.

27:50.400 --> 27:52.680
 And again, makes total sense based on the way

27:52.680 --> 27:55.680
 the visual system measures both space and time,

27:55.680 --> 27:57.920
 something maybe we'll get into a little bit later.

27:57.920 --> 28:01.800
 But I'm curious whether or not this,

28:01.800 --> 28:04.000
 the whole thing works in reverse as well.

28:04.000 --> 28:09.000
 Meaning, do people who are very motivated to exercise,

28:11.800 --> 28:14.920
 do they think this way naturally?

28:14.920 --> 28:16.940
 People who are averse to exercise

28:16.940 --> 28:20.720
 or who find it hard to get motivated to exercise,

28:20.720 --> 28:24.920
 do they view the world differently, literally?

28:24.920 --> 28:27.600
 Yeah, I have so much that I can say about this.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.200
 So if you'll humor me,

28:29.200 --> 28:31.320
 I'll give you a couple of different stories

28:31.320 --> 28:32.800
 about how we can answer that.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.760
 So you don't have to do a deep dive into vision science,

28:34.760 --> 28:37.440
 which of course you are capable of doing.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.960
 But what I can share with you is some like animal studies

28:40.960 --> 28:43.480
 where this work kind of first started.

28:43.480 --> 28:47.880
 This is in the 1940s, 1950s, rat labs, mice labs.

28:47.880 --> 28:50.920
 And they were looking, those were the first models

28:50.920 --> 28:54.320
 of human behavior that people were trying

28:54.320 --> 28:57.620
 to understand motivation, motivation science within.

28:57.620 --> 29:02.120
 So they would deprive these poor rats and mice

29:02.120 --> 29:06.280
 of food or water so that they were motivated to get it.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.360
 They were hungry and they were thirsty

29:08.360 --> 29:10.200
 and they had practice running a maze

29:10.200 --> 29:12.120
 so they knew where they could find that food or water

29:12.120 --> 29:14.020
 or whatever that they were looking for.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.520
 And what these researchers were studying

29:15.520 --> 29:19.440
 was the pace of movement through the maze.

29:19.440 --> 29:24.160
 So as the rats were like going through the maze,

29:24.160 --> 29:27.280
 they found that even though these rats were hungry

29:27.280 --> 29:32.280
 and they're having to expend limited caloric energy

29:32.520 --> 29:33.880
 to make it to the finish line,

29:33.880 --> 29:36.020
 they actually ran faster the closer they got

29:36.020 --> 29:37.240
 to that finish line.

29:37.240 --> 29:41.320
 So once that finish line became nearer to them,

29:41.320 --> 29:45.400
 they actually use their resources probably sub-optimally

29:45.400 --> 29:46.800
 to make sure that they crossed the finish line

29:46.800 --> 29:48.320
 and got their reward.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.200
 So that was like some of the first early work

29:50.200 --> 29:54.280
 that was showing that proximity to a goal

29:54.280 --> 29:57.040
 increases the investment in resources

29:57.040 --> 30:00.880
 that people, that animals use to meet that goal.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.800
 Even when they don't have that much to spare

30:02.800 --> 30:04.520
 and with the mice, the same kind of thing,

30:04.520 --> 30:07.200
 you know, they actually had these little harnesses on them.

30:07.200 --> 30:10.080
 They were looking at how hard did the mice pull

30:10.080 --> 30:11.980
 to try to make it to the food or the water

30:11.980 --> 30:13.400
 that they were trying to get.

30:13.400 --> 30:16.800
 And same deal, the closer they got to getting their reward,

30:16.800 --> 30:18.560
 the harder they were pulling,

30:18.560 --> 30:21.840
 even though they didn't have that much energy to spare

30:21.840 --> 30:23.560
 and they had already used some up

30:23.560 --> 30:25.720
 getting to that finish line.

30:25.720 --> 30:29.680
 So that was, that early animal research

30:29.680 --> 30:31.360
 from the 1940s, 1950s,

30:31.360 --> 30:34.200
 then spurred a whole wave of work in humans.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.440
 Do humans do the same thing?

30:35.440 --> 30:36.920
 You know, even when they're tired,

30:36.920 --> 30:40.500
 but they can see or they can feel that their goal is close,

30:40.500 --> 30:41.920
 do they double down and work even harder

30:41.920 --> 30:43.280
 to cross that finish line?

30:43.280 --> 30:44.760
 Either like a literal finish line

30:44.760 --> 30:45.860
 if we're talking about exercise

30:45.860 --> 30:47.120
 or a metaphorical finish line

30:47.120 --> 30:48.680
 if we're talking about any other kind of goal

30:48.680 --> 30:49.800
 that people might have.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.040
 And the answer is yes.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.520
 They called that the goal gradient hypothesis.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.440
 The closer you get to the goal,

30:55.440 --> 30:57.480
 generally the harder people and animals

30:57.480 --> 30:59.340
 work to finish that goal.

31:00.320 --> 31:02.040
 That's what led us then to think,

31:02.040 --> 31:04.360
 okay, you know, those rats, those mice,

31:04.360 --> 31:07.120
 those people are seeing a finish line, right?

31:07.120 --> 31:09.280
 And it's when they're maybe seeing that finish line,

31:09.280 --> 31:10.280
 seeing that reward,

31:10.280 --> 31:12.360
 seeing the goal they're hoping to accomplish,

31:12.360 --> 31:14.440
 that is what's leading them to, you know,

31:14.440 --> 31:18.720
 try harder to invest more so that they can finish it off.

31:18.720 --> 31:22.080
 What if we induce that illusion of proximity?

31:22.080 --> 31:23.720
 What if we can induce a visual illusion,

31:23.720 --> 31:26.920
 a visual experience that approximates

31:26.920 --> 31:31.240
 what the real rats and mice were actually experiencing

31:31.240 --> 31:32.980
 as they got closer?

31:32.980 --> 31:35.280
 So that is what is happening.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.480
 That's what's happening visually

31:36.480 --> 31:38.780
 when we create that narrowed focus of attention.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.560
 When we tell people, imagine there's a spotlight

31:40.560 --> 31:42.040
 on the shorts of the person up ahead

31:42.040 --> 31:43.880
 or the stop sign that you're seeing,

31:43.880 --> 31:46.840
 it induces an illusion of proximity

31:46.840 --> 31:50.600
 that then is responsible for people trying harder,

31:50.600 --> 31:53.680
 walking faster, feeling that it defied their expectations

31:53.680 --> 31:55.880
 and that it wasn't as bad as they thought it would be.

31:55.880 --> 31:57.460
 So we do things like measure,

31:57.460 --> 32:00.280
 like measure their visual experience.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.320
 How far away is that finish line?

32:02.320 --> 32:04.120
 Of course, we can ask them to report in feet.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.760
 How many feet is it?

32:05.760 --> 32:06.800
 Oh, but that's challenging, right?

32:06.800 --> 32:08.960
 Like nobody really knows what three feet

32:08.960 --> 32:11.200
 versus four feet really looks like, but they do.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.600
 So we can ask them how many feet it is.

32:12.600 --> 32:13.960
 We also use these other measures

32:13.960 --> 32:17.600
 of visual matching measures to know like that distance

32:17.600 --> 32:19.440
 of the finish line looks about as far away

32:19.440 --> 32:21.320
 as this other target.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.560
 They're matching up their visual experiences.

32:23.560 --> 32:27.040
 So what we know is that inducing that narrowed focus

32:27.040 --> 32:30.120
 of attention is creating an illusion of proximity.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.320
 That goal looks closer to them.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.120
 And then there's all kinds of downstream motivational

32:35.120 --> 32:36.660
 psychological effects that happen

32:36.660 --> 32:38.820
 from feeling like you're closer.

32:38.820 --> 32:43.220
 By visually misperceiving that space,

32:43.220 --> 32:45.680
 it can have a really positive consequence.

32:45.680 --> 32:48.960
 So your first question was, you know, which way does it go?

32:48.960 --> 32:50.840
 Does it go both ways that people who are better runners

32:50.840 --> 32:52.600
 like happen to do this thing?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.920
 Yes, some of our research shows that,

32:54.920 --> 32:57.960
 that if they, you know, for whatever reason happened

32:57.960 --> 33:01.200
 upon this strategy and continued to practice it,

33:01.200 --> 33:04.200
 they tend to be the better runners.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.800
 But we also know from our experiments in the lab

33:07.800 --> 33:10.480
 where we take people who don't know about these strategies

33:10.480 --> 33:11.960
 and by a flip of the coin,

33:11.960 --> 33:15.040
 we randomly assign them to either learn the strategy

33:15.040 --> 33:18.600
 and use it or do whatever comes naturally to them.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.560
 We can create that illusion of proximity

33:20.560 --> 33:23.520
 that has a direct and causal impact

33:23.520 --> 33:26.820
 on improving the performance when they're exercising.

33:26.820 --> 33:29.280
 So yes, it goes both ways,

33:29.280 --> 33:31.000
 but you can also teach yourself

33:31.000 --> 33:33.200
 that you don't have to just rely on luck,

33:33.200 --> 33:34.840
 luck of the draw for being a person

33:34.840 --> 33:36.740
 who happens to be better at exercising

33:36.740 --> 33:39.420
 or whose eyes happen to do this on their own.

33:39.420 --> 33:41.160
 Before we continue with today's discussion,

33:41.160 --> 33:42.760
 we're going to take a brief pause

33:42.760 --> 33:45.280
 to acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens,

33:45.280 --> 33:47.040
 also called AG1.

33:47.040 --> 33:50.320
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.

33:50.320 --> 33:52.160
 So I'm delighted that they've been a sponsor

33:52.160 --> 33:53.760
 of this podcast.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.560
 Athletic Greens contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics,

33:56.560 --> 33:59.280
 digestive enzymes, and adaptogens.

33:59.280 --> 34:00.600
 So it's got a lot of things in there.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.240
 That's actually the reason I started taking it

34:02.240 --> 34:04.920
 and the reason I still take it once or twice a day.

34:04.920 --> 34:07.040
 It essentially covers all of my nutritional bases

34:07.040 --> 34:09.280
 and the probiotics in particular are important to me

34:09.280 --> 34:10.600
 because of the critical importance

34:10.600 --> 34:12.200
 of what's called the gut-brain axis,

34:12.200 --> 34:15.440
 that is neurons and other cell types in the gut,

34:15.440 --> 34:18.000
 in the digestive tract that communicate with the brain

34:18.000 --> 34:20.240
 and the brain back to the digestive tract

34:20.240 --> 34:23.640
 in order to control things like mood, immune function,

34:23.640 --> 34:25.600
 hormone function, and on and on.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.040
 Whenever somebody has asked me

34:27.040 --> 34:29.220
 what's the one supplement they should take,

34:29.220 --> 34:30.860
 I always answer Athletic Greens.

34:30.860 --> 34:33.240
 I gave that answer long before I ever had this podcast

34:33.240 --> 34:35.020
 and it's the answer I still give now

34:35.020 --> 34:37.800
 for all the reasons that I detailed just a moment ago.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.180
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

34:39.180 --> 34:42.040
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

34:42.040 --> 34:43.160
 to claim a special offer.

34:43.160 --> 34:44.560
 They'll give you five free travel packs

34:44.560 --> 34:46.320
 that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

34:46.320 --> 34:47.340
 while you're on the road,

34:47.340 --> 34:50.160
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2,

34:50.160 --> 34:52.360
 which are also very important for a huge number

34:52.360 --> 34:54.480
 of bodily factors and brain factors

34:54.480 --> 34:56.360
 that impact your immediate and long-term health.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.000
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

34:59.000 --> 35:00.660
 to claim that special offer.

35:00.660 --> 35:03.320
 The most pressing question I have in my mind is,

35:03.320 --> 35:07.600
 can we, I, all of us,

35:07.600 --> 35:12.120
 use this strategy to make the starting line a goal point?

35:12.120 --> 35:13.460
 Because for a lot of people,

35:13.460 --> 35:15.520
 it's not about going from start to finish,

35:15.520 --> 35:17.920
 it's about getting to start.

35:17.920 --> 35:22.400
 And I would say here I'm estimating,

35:22.400 --> 35:27.400
 but 15% of the content on social media is about motivation

35:27.960 --> 35:30.240
 and how to get motivated to do things.

35:31.440 --> 35:34.120
 Neurochemicals like dopamine, of course,

35:34.120 --> 35:35.920
 being at the heart of motivation,

35:35.920 --> 35:37.680
 in my mind, I'm making strong links

35:37.680 --> 35:39.520
 between some of these visual aperture effects

35:39.520 --> 35:43.640
 and goal lines and dopamine that we could also dive into.

35:43.640 --> 35:46.320
 But the simple question is,

35:46.320 --> 35:49.600
 can I use this finish line strategy

35:49.600 --> 35:52.660
 to make the start line a goal

35:52.660 --> 35:56.220
 and get my system more engaged or motivated?

35:56.220 --> 36:00.160
 And is there any physiology or physiological changes

36:00.160 --> 36:02.180
 I should say to reflect the idea

36:02.180 --> 36:05.160
 that maybe just visually focusing on the start line

36:05.160 --> 36:07.640
 would actually get me more excited

36:07.640 --> 36:11.280
 as opposed to make me less excited to engage in effort?

36:11.280 --> 36:13.320
 There's certainly vision science that's tied up

36:13.320 --> 36:17.040
 in that very first stage of goal setting,

36:17.040 --> 36:19.080
 identifying what that goal is in the first place

36:19.080 --> 36:21.320
 and taking those first steps.

36:21.320 --> 36:24.100
 A lot of people's go-to strategies that involve vision

36:24.100 --> 36:28.640
 are vision boards or dream boards or post-it notes.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.580
 They're creating some sort of visual representation

36:31.580 --> 36:33.800
 of what it is that they want to accomplish.

36:33.800 --> 36:36.460
 Where is it that I want to be in five years, 10 days,

36:36.460 --> 36:38.800
 10 years, whatever that timeline is

36:38.800 --> 36:40.440
 that they're working under.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.280
 The idea of vision boards or dream boards

36:42.280 --> 36:46.760
 is that you almost like a scrapbook collect visual icons

36:46.760 --> 36:49.120
 that reflect where you want to be to motivate yourself.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.720
 It's a really common tactic that people use.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.500
 And it's not bad to do that, right?

36:54.500 --> 36:57.080
 For some people, just even knowing what they want in life

36:57.080 --> 36:58.320
 is a major accomplishment.

36:58.320 --> 37:01.360
 And defining the goal can be really challenging for people.

37:01.360 --> 37:02.980
 And that's a strategy that works

37:02.980 --> 37:05.560
 and involves our visual experience, right?

37:05.560 --> 37:07.040
 It's not just, people aren't saying like,

37:07.040 --> 37:09.080
 why don't you just sit around and imagine

37:09.080 --> 37:11.320
 what you want your life to be like in 10 years?

37:11.320 --> 37:13.700
 The strategy that people are suggesting is like,

37:13.700 --> 37:16.400
 no, cut out the pictures, put it on a board

37:16.400 --> 37:18.240
 and stick it by your bathroom mirror

37:18.240 --> 37:19.560
 so you see it every day, right?

37:19.560 --> 37:20.400
 Or make a list.

37:20.400 --> 37:21.240
 Or make a list, yeah.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.640
 People are big on these lists.

37:22.640 --> 37:23.600
 I have a lot of friends who are like,

37:23.600 --> 37:25.480
 have you made your list, right?

37:25.480 --> 37:27.560
 The list of things that you insist on having

37:27.560 --> 37:31.260
 in the context of fitness, relationship, job,

37:31.260 --> 37:32.100
 et cetera, et cetera.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.440
 This seems more and more common.

37:33.440 --> 37:34.280
 Yeah, totally.

37:34.280 --> 37:35.340
 And the idea, like write it down, right?

37:35.340 --> 37:36.840
 They're telling you write it down

37:36.840 --> 37:41.640
 or create a visual manifestation of it.

37:41.640 --> 37:44.540
 And so, yeah, that's effective

37:44.540 --> 37:46.720
 for identifying what you want.

37:46.720 --> 37:48.580
 But it may not actually be effective

37:48.580 --> 37:51.820
 for helping you to meet the goal, to get the job done.

37:51.820 --> 37:54.320
 So colleagues of mine at New York University

37:54.320 --> 37:56.480
 have probed why, why is that?

37:56.480 --> 37:59.860
 Why is just thinking about what you want in your life

37:59.860 --> 38:04.400
 and sort of putting yourself vicariously into those shoes,

38:04.400 --> 38:05.940
 imagining what my life will be like

38:05.940 --> 38:09.240
 if I can accomplish everything on this list.

38:09.240 --> 38:10.320
 Why doesn't that work?

38:10.320 --> 38:11.360
 Well, first of all, does it work?

38:11.360 --> 38:12.180
 The answer is no.

38:12.180 --> 38:15.020
 And why does it not work?

38:15.020 --> 38:17.280
 Because what happens, these colleagues,

38:17.280 --> 38:21.080
 Gabrielle Otengen and her research team have found,

38:21.080 --> 38:24.320
 is that going through and dreaming about

38:24.320 --> 38:27.320
 or visualizing how great my life will be

38:27.320 --> 38:29.280
 when I get X, Y, and Z done,

38:30.500 --> 38:34.180
 that is like a goal satisfied.

38:34.180 --> 38:36.080
 I have identified what it is that I want.

38:36.080 --> 38:40.360
 I have experienced it, even if just in an imaginary way.

38:40.360 --> 38:44.400
 I've had that positive experience of thinking about

38:44.400 --> 38:47.440
 how great my life is gonna be when I get this thing done.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.900
 And they start to sort of rest on their laurels.

38:49.900 --> 38:51.800
 She's actually measured systolic blood pressure

38:51.800 --> 38:52.880
 and heart rate.

38:52.880 --> 38:55.240
 And they found that people who do that,

38:55.240 --> 38:57.280
 who go through that experience of visualizing

38:57.280 --> 39:00.120
 how great my life will be when I get X, Y, and Z done,

39:00.120 --> 39:02.400
 their systolic blood pressure,

39:02.400 --> 39:06.680
 bottom number on your blood pressure reading, decreases.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.360
 Okay, now I'm all about finding ways to relax,

39:09.360 --> 39:10.520
 especially in New York, right?

39:10.520 --> 39:13.160
 You're constantly living at a high level of stimulation.

39:13.160 --> 39:14.300
 And so like, cool, great.

39:14.300 --> 39:15.560
 So maybe I should just like think about

39:15.560 --> 39:16.560
 how awesome my life will be

39:16.560 --> 39:19.440
 when I get my bucket list done.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.680
 But motivation scientists know that systolic blood pressure

39:22.680 --> 39:25.040
 is actually an indicator of our body's readiness

39:25.040 --> 39:27.660
 to get up and act, to do something.

39:27.660 --> 39:29.400
 Now that can be the going out for a walk,

39:29.400 --> 39:31.640
 going out for a run, hitting the gym.

39:31.640 --> 39:34.760
 It can also be things like doing math problems, right?

39:34.760 --> 39:36.640
 Even if it's something that's just mental,

39:36.640 --> 39:38.980
 systolic blood pressure actually goes up

39:38.980 --> 39:41.760
 in anticipation of your body

39:41.760 --> 39:43.760
 or your mind needing to do something,

39:43.760 --> 39:46.200
 taking the first steps on a goal.

39:47.560 --> 39:50.440
 So then it helps us to understand of like,

39:50.440 --> 39:52.620
 okay, if I've just created this dream board,

39:52.620 --> 39:54.780
 this vision board, and put myself psychologically

39:54.780 --> 39:57.000
 in that space of a goal satisfied,

39:57.000 --> 39:58.760
 why is it bad that blood pressure goes down?

39:58.760 --> 40:00.880
 Because it means your body is chilling out.

40:00.880 --> 40:02.320
 It's like, all right, cool.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.560
 I just accomplished something pretty major.

40:04.560 --> 40:07.760
 I'd actually now don't have the physiological resources

40:07.760 --> 40:10.200
 at the ready to take the first step right now

40:10.200 --> 40:12.060
 to do something about that.

40:12.060 --> 40:16.160
 So that was a pretty monumental finding

40:16.160 --> 40:17.360
 for motivation scientists,

40:17.360 --> 40:19.240
 to understand that like creating these dream boards,

40:19.240 --> 40:22.400
 these vision boards or to-do lists might actually backfire

40:22.400 --> 40:26.620
 because in and of itself is the creation of a goal

40:26.620 --> 40:28.240
 and the satisfaction of the goal.

40:28.240 --> 40:31.000
 And then people understandably give themselves some time

40:31.000 --> 40:33.960
 to just enjoy that positive experience.

40:33.960 --> 40:35.680
 So much for the secret.

40:35.680 --> 40:37.560
 Yeah, exactly, exactly.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.600
 I guess now the secret folks will come after me

40:39.600 --> 40:40.440
 with pitchforks, but-

40:40.440 --> 40:42.520
 I try to never say the name, right?

40:42.520 --> 40:43.600
 Well, I'm not afraid to say the name.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.920
 I mean, I imagine that certain strategies

40:45.920 --> 40:46.820
 might work for other people,

40:46.820 --> 40:49.140
 but everything you're saying, again,

40:49.140 --> 40:51.580
 is consistent with what we know about the physiology

40:51.580 --> 40:53.340
 of dopamine circuits for motivation.

40:53.340 --> 40:56.900
 I have a good friend who perhaps incidentally,

40:56.900 --> 41:00.740
 perhaps not, is a cardiologist at a major university,

41:00.740 --> 41:04.640
 said that one of the major errors that people make

41:04.640 --> 41:08.060
 with book writing and completion is they will tell people

41:08.060 --> 41:10.400
 they're going to write a book and people will say,

41:10.400 --> 41:11.900
 oh, you definitely should write a book.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.120
 Everyone's going to love your book

41:13.120 --> 41:14.460
 and they never end up writing it.

41:14.460 --> 41:18.320
 And his theory is that they get so much dopamine reward

41:18.320 --> 41:20.840
 from that immediate feedback with all the protection

41:20.840 --> 41:22.720
 of never having the book criticized,

41:22.720 --> 41:24.120
 that they never write the book.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.580
 I'm sure there are exceptions to this,

41:25.580 --> 41:28.100
 but I guess it raises the question,

41:28.100 --> 41:29.460
 what's the better strategy?

41:29.460 --> 41:32.720
 Yeah, so I'm not saying that people who enjoy

41:32.720 --> 41:35.380
 a dream board creation should stop what they're doing.

41:35.380 --> 41:36.820
 That's not the take-home message here.

41:36.820 --> 41:38.020
 Nightmare board?

41:38.020 --> 41:39.460
 Oh, definitely not that, no.

41:39.460 --> 41:41.300
 There's enough anxiety and fear in the world.

41:41.300 --> 41:43.440
 We don't need to encourage more of it.

41:43.440 --> 41:45.200
 But the process of goal setting shouldn't stop

41:45.200 --> 41:47.100
 with articulating what the goal is.

41:48.160 --> 41:50.700
 So at that same point that we're trying to figure out

41:50.700 --> 41:51.540
 what do we want to do?

41:51.540 --> 41:53.940
 What is my vision for the future?

41:53.940 --> 41:57.640
 In those planning sessions, we need to simultaneously

41:57.640 --> 41:59.340
 think about a couple other things.

41:59.340 --> 42:02.800
 One is how are we going to get there?

42:02.800 --> 42:04.500
 So take it out of the abstract,

42:04.500 --> 42:08.220
 take it out of this idyllic visual iconography

42:08.220 --> 42:10.180
 and start thinking about the practical day-to-day.

42:10.180 --> 42:11.940
 We need to break it down into more manageable goals,

42:11.940 --> 42:15.500
 not just my 10-year plan for myself, but my two-week plan.

42:15.500 --> 42:17.500
 What can I accomplish in the next two weeks

42:17.500 --> 42:18.780
 and the two weeks after?

42:18.780 --> 42:21.220
 That's going to set me on the right trajectory.

42:21.220 --> 42:22.720
 That's probably not surprising to anybody

42:22.720 --> 42:26.100
 who's been thinking about how do I set goals better?

42:26.100 --> 42:29.240
 Plan big picture, think big picture abstractly,

42:29.240 --> 42:31.660
 but then also break it down more concretely.

42:31.660 --> 42:32.780
 That's probably not surprising,

42:32.780 --> 42:36.980
 but it's an important aspect of the goal setting process.

42:36.980 --> 42:38.980
 Then again, Gabrielle Otengen in my department

42:38.980 --> 42:41.620
 has identified a third often overlooked

42:41.620 --> 42:45.320
 or underappreciated stage that has to happen

42:45.320 --> 42:47.500
 at that goal in the goal setting process.

42:47.500 --> 42:49.220
 And that's thinking about the obstacles

42:49.220 --> 42:52.100
 that stand in your way of success.

42:52.100 --> 42:54.940
 And that will actually help improve motivation

42:54.940 --> 42:56.220
 in the long run.

42:56.220 --> 42:59.020
 And sometimes people think that that is counterintuitive.

42:59.020 --> 43:01.660
 You're saying like, if I want to increase my motivation,

43:01.660 --> 43:02.500
 have more motivation,

43:02.500 --> 43:04.220
 then I need to think about how hard it's going to be,

43:04.220 --> 43:05.960
 all the ways that I'm going to fail.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.900
 How is that going to like jazz me up?

43:07.900 --> 43:09.280
 How's that going to help me get through

43:09.280 --> 43:13.540
 when I actually, you know, when things get hard?

43:13.540 --> 43:17.540
 But it does because it's like coming up with a plan B,

43:17.540 --> 43:21.700
 a plan C, plan D in advance of actually experiencing that.

43:21.700 --> 43:24.060
 If you were on a boat and the boat started to sink,

43:24.060 --> 43:25.740
 that's not the time you want to start looking

43:25.740 --> 43:27.060
 for life jackets.

43:27.060 --> 43:28.180
 You already want to know where one is

43:28.180 --> 43:30.180
 so you can go to it right away.

43:30.180 --> 43:32.380
 And it's the same thing with goal setting

43:32.380 --> 43:34.300
 is that you want to know, what am I working towards?

43:34.300 --> 43:35.180
 How am I going to get there?

43:35.180 --> 43:37.500
 And if I experience this obstacle,

43:37.500 --> 43:39.100
 here's what I'm going to do about it.

43:39.100 --> 43:41.100
 You may never experience that obstacle,

43:41.100 --> 43:43.740
 but if you do, you're probably going to be shy on time,

43:43.740 --> 43:45.340
 thin on resources,

43:45.340 --> 43:47.760
 maybe experiencing an anxiety that hijacks your brain

43:47.760 --> 43:50.580
 so you're not functioning at that optimal level

43:50.580 --> 43:52.660
 of judgment and decision-making,

43:52.660 --> 43:55.860
 you want to already have like the snap next step in place.

43:55.860 --> 43:58.060
 So you can just hop to it, right?

43:58.060 --> 43:59.260
 We're not going to do our best thinking

43:59.260 --> 44:00.780
 when we're in crisis mode,

44:01.660 --> 44:04.260
 but we don't have to if we have used,

44:04.260 --> 44:06.180
 if we have already used our resources in advance

44:06.180 --> 44:08.680
 to come up with that plan B or that plan C.

44:08.680 --> 44:11.200
 Michael Phelps, like incredible athlete, right?

44:11.200 --> 44:12.660
 This is something that he and his coach

44:12.660 --> 44:16.600
 have routinely incorporated into their training.

44:16.600 --> 44:19.540
 So I love this story that like back in 2008,

44:19.540 --> 44:23.220
 he was hot for the first time on the international stage.

44:23.220 --> 44:24.380
 It was the Beijing Olympics.

44:24.380 --> 44:26.140
 Michael Phelps was on the brink of doing something

44:26.140 --> 44:28.620
 that no one else in the history of the Olympic games

44:28.620 --> 44:29.460
 has ever done,

44:29.460 --> 44:32.820
 which is win eight gold medals in a single Olympiad.

44:32.820 --> 44:35.680
 At the time of this story, he had already won seven

44:35.680 --> 44:37.820
 and he had just the 200 fly in front of him

44:37.820 --> 44:40.100
 before he could do what no one else has ever done,

44:40.100 --> 44:42.000
 win the eighth gold medal.

44:42.000 --> 44:44.020
 And like the fly is his thing, right?

44:44.020 --> 44:45.660
 This should have been easy,

44:45.660 --> 44:47.180
 like a no brainer, he's going to win this,

44:47.180 --> 44:49.300
 he's going to break Olympic history.

44:49.300 --> 44:51.520
 As soon as he dove into the pool,

44:51.520 --> 44:53.300
 his goggles started to leak.

44:53.300 --> 44:56.380
 And by the time he had done three lengths of the pool,

44:56.380 --> 44:58.340
 he just had to flip around and come back

44:58.340 --> 45:01.860
 to the starting line slash finish line, back to the edge.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.020
 By the time that happened,

45:04.020 --> 45:05.580
 his goggles were completely filled with water

45:05.580 --> 45:07.260
 and he was swimming blind.

45:07.260 --> 45:08.100
 I would have panicked,

45:08.100 --> 45:09.760
 I would have sunk to the bottom of the pool.

45:09.760 --> 45:11.420
 I wouldn't have even been in the pool to be honest,

45:11.420 --> 45:12.260
 like I'm not a swimmer,

45:12.260 --> 45:13.540
 definitely not going to be in the Olympics,

45:13.540 --> 45:15.420
 but for him, he didn't.

45:15.420 --> 45:16.740
 It wasn't a moment of panic,

45:16.740 --> 45:17.620
 like it probably would have been

45:17.620 --> 45:20.440
 for nearly every other person in that situation,

45:20.440 --> 45:24.060
 because he had foreshadowed that kind of possible failure.

45:24.060 --> 45:26.860
 He had imagined that obstacle hitting him in advance

45:26.860 --> 45:28.960
 and not even just imagined it, but practiced it.

45:28.960 --> 45:30.060
 What will we do?

45:30.060 --> 45:32.480
 He routinely practiced swimming with his goggles,

45:32.480 --> 45:34.100
 not fully secured on his face.

45:34.100 --> 45:37.980
 His coach notoriously would rip the goggles off of his head,

45:37.980 --> 45:40.020
 smash them on the ground for maybe dramatic effect

45:40.020 --> 45:41.880
 or something so that he didn't even have any goggles

45:41.880 --> 45:45.060
 possible to grab as he's in practice.

45:45.060 --> 45:47.500
 So because he had foreshadowed that possibility,

45:47.500 --> 45:50.580
 and the solution, if my goggles start to leak,

45:50.580 --> 45:54.820
 then I will do, in his case, start counting my strokes,

45:54.820 --> 45:55.780
 then I'll make it through.

45:55.780 --> 45:57.540
 He knew exactly how many strokes it would take

45:57.540 --> 45:59.540
 for him to get from one end of the pool to the other.

45:59.540 --> 46:01.020
 He started counting his strokes.

46:01.020 --> 46:03.660
 He won that race, the 200 fly,

46:03.660 --> 46:04.540
 he won his eighth gold medal

46:04.540 --> 46:07.240
 and he'd go on to win 15 more in his career.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.060
 So we might not all be swimmers,

46:09.060 --> 46:11.960
 we might not all aspire to Olympic level performance,

46:11.960 --> 46:14.900
 but I love that example because I think it helps

46:14.900 --> 46:17.900
 sort of demystify or give us an alternative perspective

46:17.900 --> 46:22.180
 on the importance and the motivational reasons why

46:22.180 --> 46:23.980
 thinking about obstacles in advance,

46:23.980 --> 46:26.740
 thinking about the ways, the two, three, four ways

46:26.740 --> 46:29.900
 that your plan might go awry is actually effective

46:29.900 --> 46:31.420
 at helping us to overcome the obstacle

46:31.420 --> 46:34.380
 that might otherwise lead us to throw in the towel.

46:34.380 --> 46:36.980
 That's a beautiful example.

46:36.980 --> 46:39.340
 I'm going to springboard off that example

46:39.340 --> 46:42.820
 to ask a question that has also been on my mind,

46:42.820 --> 46:46.080
 which is, is there really anything special about vision?

46:46.080 --> 46:47.700
 Because in the example you just gave,

46:47.700 --> 46:50.980
 it was indeed vision that Michael Phelps was deprived of

46:50.980 --> 46:53.940
 and it was counting strokes.

46:53.940 --> 46:56.980
 Counting is another form of incremental measurement

46:56.980 --> 46:58.860
 in the nervous system, obviously.

47:00.240 --> 47:02.500
 There are others that could be the sensation

47:02.500 --> 47:04.660
 of the hands smacking the water

47:04.660 --> 47:05.940
 or breaking the surface of the water.

47:05.940 --> 47:08.860
 So there are any number of different variables

47:08.860 --> 47:11.280
 or metrics that one could use.

47:11.280 --> 47:15.020
 I could imagine that setting out on a,

47:15.020 --> 47:16.740
 let's say a three mile run,

47:16.740 --> 47:18.740
 which for me is a decent distance run.

47:18.740 --> 47:20.060
 It's one I do a few times a week.

47:20.060 --> 47:21.100
 I'm also not a runner,

47:21.100 --> 47:23.180
 but I try and complete some runs a few times a week

47:23.180 --> 47:25.520
 at very slow pace just for my health.

47:26.580 --> 47:28.740
 I could count every step.

47:28.740 --> 47:30.340
 That would be kind of exhausting.

47:31.220 --> 47:34.020
 But if I knew that three miles was,

47:34.020 --> 47:35.260
 I'm going to estimate here, I don't know,

47:35.260 --> 47:38.660
 a couple thousand steps, I could count backward.

47:38.660 --> 47:39.660
 I could count forward.

47:39.660 --> 47:42.740
 I count every 10, I confess.

47:42.740 --> 47:44.700
 I spend every morning trying to find sunlight

47:44.700 --> 47:46.660
 to get sun in my eyes to set my circadian rhythm

47:46.660 --> 47:48.380
 and I do a hundred jumping jacks.

47:48.380 --> 47:51.020
 So I'm the guy that people are looking at strange

47:51.020 --> 47:53.180
 on the street, but sometimes I count every 10,

47:53.180 --> 47:55.940
 sometimes I count backwards, sometimes I count forward.

47:55.940 --> 47:57.620
 Is there any indication that it matters

47:57.620 --> 48:01.420
 or is it simply that we attach some sort of meaning

48:01.420 --> 48:06.420
 to that increment and the mode of reaching that increment?

48:07.100 --> 48:09.060
 Because it does seem like there's something special

48:09.060 --> 48:11.620
 about vision, we could maybe dive into a little bit more

48:11.620 --> 48:14.200
 of why that is, but at a very basic level,

48:15.500 --> 48:18.980
 how broadly or finally should one set the increments

48:18.980 --> 48:21.100
 and does it matter if you're counting steps

48:21.100 --> 48:23.100
 or counting strokes, if you're,

48:23.100 --> 48:25.100
 maybe it's every other song,

48:25.100 --> 48:27.260
 you're going to listen to an entire album.

48:27.260 --> 48:29.260
 That's something that I don't know if people do anymore,

48:29.260 --> 48:30.860
 or you're going to listen to a whole playlist

48:30.860 --> 48:32.900
 and then listen to it again and you're going to run

48:32.900 --> 48:37.060
 as long as the playlist is completed twice.

48:37.060 --> 48:38.780
 You can obviously see what I'm getting at,

48:38.780 --> 48:41.100
 but I know people are going to want to implement these tools

48:41.100 --> 48:42.740
 and I have to guess that the nervous system

48:42.740 --> 48:46.300
 is somewhat indiscriminate when it comes to these things,

48:46.300 --> 48:49.020
 but that there might also be some specificity.

48:49.020 --> 48:51.460
 I think vision is special and I think you do too.

48:52.300 --> 48:54.940
 So, and for a variety of reasons,

48:54.940 --> 48:56.480
 when you start, you can really nerd out

48:56.480 --> 48:59.120
 on how cool the brain is and how cool vision is

48:59.120 --> 49:00.820
 within the brain and when you do,

49:00.820 --> 49:01.860
 then you start to find some things

49:01.860 --> 49:03.640
 that make vision unique, right?

49:03.640 --> 49:07.460
 More real estate, more neurological cortex,

49:07.460 --> 49:09.780
 real estate is taken up by the visual sense

49:09.780 --> 49:14.580
 than any other sense, more than taste, touch, smell, right?

49:14.580 --> 49:16.360
 Vision gets more real estate,

49:16.360 --> 49:18.620
 gets more neurological processing space

49:18.620 --> 49:19.720
 than any other sense.

49:19.720 --> 49:20.560
 Why is that?

49:20.560 --> 49:22.760
 Well, because evolution has led us to prioritize

49:22.760 --> 49:25.780
 that visual, the visual experience.

49:25.780 --> 49:27.840
 There's some cool illusions where like maybe

49:27.840 --> 49:29.620
 somebody's mouth is doing something different

49:29.620 --> 49:32.860
 than what you're hearing when people start to create these

49:32.860 --> 49:37.460
 like weird tricks that might go on YouTube and go viral

49:37.460 --> 49:39.420
 and people are trying to figure out what did I hear?

49:39.420 --> 49:41.500
 What did I see his mouth doing?

49:41.500 --> 49:44.740
 And what comes up is that people prioritize what they see

49:44.740 --> 49:47.300
 over what they're hearing when the two are incompatible

49:47.300 --> 49:48.640
 or kind of like out of sync.

49:48.640 --> 49:49.480
 Every time.

49:49.480 --> 49:50.640
 Yeah, every time, right?

49:50.640 --> 49:52.960
 If you had to bet on it, bet on what it is

49:52.960 --> 49:55.340
 that you're looking at rather than what you're seeing.

49:55.340 --> 49:56.700
 Why is that?

49:56.700 --> 49:58.420
 Well, I guess a couple other things too, right?

49:58.420 --> 49:59.680
 Like we can see super far.

49:59.680 --> 50:02.500
 You can see like a flickering candle on our horizon

50:02.500 --> 50:06.920
 if it was a totally clear sky several miles away.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.700
 You can see the International Space Station

50:08.700 --> 50:11.060
 floating up in the night sky, right?

50:11.060 --> 50:12.900
 Like hundreds of miles away.

50:12.900 --> 50:14.820
 Our eyes are amazing.

50:14.820 --> 50:19.380
 And we prioritize what we see that.

50:19.380 --> 50:21.400
 And I think that's because we never,

50:21.400 --> 50:23.220
 we rarely get the experience

50:23.220 --> 50:26.220
 of having our visual experience second guessed.

50:26.220 --> 50:28.220
 You know, oftentimes we're having a conversation

50:28.220 --> 50:29.380
 maybe in a loud restaurant

50:29.380 --> 50:30.940
 and we know that we didn't hear the person right.

50:30.940 --> 50:32.300
 And so we say like, oh, did you say that?

50:32.300 --> 50:33.780
 Or like, oh, I thought you said this.

50:33.780 --> 50:34.960
 And they're like, no, I didn't say that, right?

50:34.960 --> 50:39.380
 So people will correct us when our ears get it wrong

50:39.380 --> 50:41.580
 or we're tasting something amazing

50:41.580 --> 50:43.940
 and we can't quite figure out what spices were in here.

50:43.940 --> 50:45.540
 And so we know that our tongue

50:45.540 --> 50:48.780
 isn't quite picking up the taste the right way.

50:48.780 --> 50:49.880
 And that's why we read the menu

50:49.880 --> 50:51.020
 to see what are the ingredients.

50:51.020 --> 50:52.700
 Or we ask the chef, like, what did you put in this?

50:52.700 --> 50:54.580
 It tastes amazing.

50:54.580 --> 50:56.220
 So we know that our tongue is getting it wrong.

50:56.220 --> 50:57.900
 Or you might be touching something

50:57.900 --> 51:00.140
 and you look at the tag to see what sort of textile

51:00.140 --> 51:02.220
 was used in this really amazing piece of clothing

51:02.220 --> 51:03.420
 that you're looking to buy.

51:03.420 --> 51:05.420
 So we know that our sense of touch

51:05.420 --> 51:06.720
 isn't quite getting it right.

51:06.720 --> 51:08.380
 But rarely do we have that experience

51:08.380 --> 51:11.340
 of having our eyes get updated.

51:11.340 --> 51:12.460
 Where we're looking at something,

51:12.460 --> 51:13.600
 oh, I think I'm looking at my mom.

51:13.600 --> 51:15.880
 Oh, no, actually it was actually my husband.

51:15.880 --> 51:17.920
 Okay, like that never happens, right?

51:17.920 --> 51:19.620
 That we have gotten vision as wrong

51:19.620 --> 51:21.620
 as we might get any other thing

51:21.620 --> 51:24.780
 that we're experiencing through any other sense.

51:24.780 --> 51:26.880
 We trust our visual experience.

51:26.880 --> 51:28.880
 We have a sort of a naive realism

51:28.880 --> 51:32.860
 that what we see reflects the world the way it actually is.

51:32.860 --> 51:35.260
 Because it's never really fully tested.

51:35.260 --> 51:37.920
 We never get the input or the feedback

51:37.920 --> 51:40.080
 that you've seen something wrong.

51:40.080 --> 51:42.700
 Until a visual illusion pops up on social media, right?

51:42.700 --> 51:46.140
 Like the dress example or the last week or so

51:46.140 --> 51:48.740
 there's been that horse seal line drawing

51:48.740 --> 51:50.320
 that's been all over social media too.

51:50.320 --> 51:51.160
 What do you see?

51:51.160 --> 51:51.980
 I see a horse.

51:51.980 --> 51:52.820
 Someone says, I see a seal.

51:52.820 --> 51:54.160
 And then like, you know, chaos erupts.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.100
 Or I thought the dress was blue

51:56.100 --> 51:57.840
 and I thought it was gold.

51:57.840 --> 51:58.680
 I don't remember.

51:58.680 --> 52:01.640
 There's options because I see it as blue, so, right?

52:01.640 --> 52:04.160
 And it's like dividing up families and friendships

52:04.160 --> 52:05.560
 because you've like seen something

52:05.560 --> 52:08.200
 that the other person just literally cannot see.

52:08.200 --> 52:10.340
 And that's why we love those examples

52:10.340 --> 52:13.140
 when they pop up in social media when they do.

52:13.140 --> 52:16.720
 Is because it defies all of our previous expectations.

52:16.720 --> 52:19.820
 There's a really amazing, if this interests you,

52:19.820 --> 52:22.120
 there's a really amazing visual artist, Anish Kapoor,

52:22.120 --> 52:23.640
 who plays with these ideas too

52:23.640 --> 52:26.940
 and his installations are just fascinating.

52:26.940 --> 52:30.280
 I saw one at a museum once where, you know,

52:30.280 --> 52:31.760
 walk down this long hall and it's just

52:31.760 --> 52:34.640
 a big black rectangle that's painted on the wall.

52:34.640 --> 52:36.320
 And I was like, this guy's super famous.

52:36.320 --> 52:37.160
 What the hell?

52:37.160 --> 52:40.240
 It's just a big black rectangle painted on the wall.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.840
 What is this about?

52:41.840 --> 52:42.780
 What a hoax, you know?

52:42.780 --> 52:45.500
 This museum paid how much, what, whatever.

52:45.500 --> 52:46.980
 But then as you get closer, you get closer

52:46.980 --> 52:48.560
 and your eyes start to settle in

52:48.560 --> 52:50.320
 and they adapt to the different visual lighting.

52:50.320 --> 52:52.280
 You realize it's not a black square painted on the wall.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.480
 It's a huge hole he's carved into the wall.

52:54.480 --> 52:56.320
 And there is a whole other world

52:56.320 --> 52:59.240
 that's back behind there that you can't see right away

52:59.240 --> 53:02.120
 until your eyes adapt to the different lighting conditions.

53:02.120 --> 53:02.940
 Beautiful.

53:02.940 --> 53:03.780
 It's amazing.

53:03.780 --> 53:05.580
 As a vision scientist, I have to see,

53:05.580 --> 53:06.760
 where is this exhibit?

53:06.760 --> 53:07.880
 It's not up right now.

53:07.880 --> 53:11.000
 I've seen, there was a retrospective several years ago

53:11.000 --> 53:14.840
 that was done in Sydney, but his work is all over the place.

53:14.840 --> 53:17.620
 So Anish Kapoor, definitely worth looking up

53:17.620 --> 53:20.380
 because like the dress example

53:20.380 --> 53:21.760
 or the horse seal line drawing

53:21.760 --> 53:24.240
 or artists like Anish Kapoor's work,

53:24.240 --> 53:27.360
 that is a moment that gives us a different,

53:27.360 --> 53:30.180
 unexpected insight about the world.

53:30.180 --> 53:32.520
 That it challenges us to see something

53:32.520 --> 53:35.240
 that we hadn't seen before or it induces or tricks us

53:35.240 --> 53:36.440
 into seeing something that we wouldn't

53:36.440 --> 53:38.200
 have otherwise have seen.

53:38.200 --> 53:39.880
 And so it's those rare moments

53:39.880 --> 53:41.800
 that I think are actually really important

53:41.800 --> 53:44.860
 for understanding what do our eyes normally do

53:44.860 --> 53:47.540
 because we wouldn't find these examples so surprising,

53:47.540 --> 53:49.100
 so engaging, so shocking,

53:49.100 --> 53:50.960
 if we had routinely gotten the experience

53:50.960 --> 53:53.600
 of realizing we're not seeing the world the way that it is.

53:53.600 --> 53:57.760
 So that is why I think vision is special

53:57.760 --> 54:00.320
 and why it can be thought of as a tool

54:00.320 --> 54:02.600
 that we can add to our toolkit

54:02.600 --> 54:05.000
 for how to better accomplish our goals.

54:05.000 --> 54:06.880
 I'm not saying that we should just only focus

54:06.880 --> 54:10.880
 on imagining the world through an attentional spotlight,

54:10.880 --> 54:14.080
 but maybe that's something that we can employ strategically

54:14.080 --> 54:16.800
 on occasion when we think it's gonna best help us,

54:16.800 --> 54:19.200
 when we need an extra little push to cross

54:19.200 --> 54:21.720
 the literal or metaphorical finish line,

54:21.720 --> 54:24.640
 but it doesn't have to be the only tactic that we use.

54:24.640 --> 54:26.460
 Just like it's not bad to use vision boards,

54:26.460 --> 54:28.300
 but let's use something else also.

54:28.300 --> 54:31.480
 It's not bad to talk to ourselves in encouraging ways,

54:31.480 --> 54:35.400
 but let's try adding another tool to our tool belt

54:35.400 --> 54:38.680
 in case that's not enough to get the job done.

54:38.680 --> 54:40.440
 So I do think that there's great power

54:40.440 --> 54:42.360
 in thinking about our visual experience

54:42.360 --> 54:45.000
 alongside other tactics that we might use

54:45.000 --> 54:46.520
 for meeting our goals.

54:46.520 --> 54:48.440
 And another one of those tactics might be like

54:48.440 --> 54:50.080
 the numerics that you're talking about.

54:50.080 --> 54:52.520
 How do I think about my jumping jacks

54:52.520 --> 54:55.980
 in terms of groups of 10 or as a set of 100?

54:55.980 --> 54:57.100
 You do it routinely.

54:57.100 --> 54:59.080
 So you might be able to set a goal of 100

54:59.080 --> 55:03.080
 and have that sustain you through number 60, number 70,

55:03.080 --> 55:04.880
 when maybe it's starting to get harder.

55:04.880 --> 55:06.380
 But for somebody who's just starting out

55:06.380 --> 55:08.120
 and wants to be able to make it to 100,

55:08.120 --> 55:09.160
 that's probably not gonna work.

55:09.160 --> 55:10.580
 That's gonna be maybe really,

55:10.580 --> 55:12.000
 that could be quite challenging for them

55:12.000 --> 55:13.920
 if it's the first time that they're trying it.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.920
 And so instead, setting those micro goals

55:15.920 --> 55:19.100
 of groups of 10 is gonna be useful

55:19.100 --> 55:21.440
 because as we start to get to number eight or nine

55:21.440 --> 55:25.140
 or number 88 or 89 and it's really getting hard,

55:25.140 --> 55:28.320
 we need that extra little hedonic hit of pleasure,

55:28.320 --> 55:31.180
 of accomplishment, the micro dopamine rush

55:31.180 --> 55:34.440
 that you might get by hitting another 10,

55:34.440 --> 55:36.860
 you know, another decade milestone,

55:36.860 --> 55:39.000
 another group of 10 milestone.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.680
 And once we get that little hit of pleasure,

55:40.680 --> 55:43.200
 excitement or self congratulations,

55:43.200 --> 55:44.600
 that might be enough to sustain us

55:44.600 --> 55:47.120
 through the next challenging physical obstacle,

55:47.120 --> 55:49.760
 the next group of 10 that we might experience.

55:49.760 --> 55:52.440
 So there isn't any prescription that I would give

55:52.440 --> 55:54.240
 and say every person should decide

55:54.240 --> 55:56.880
 that 25 jumping jacks is the goal.

55:56.880 --> 56:00.080
 No, we have to be idiosyncratic and introspect

56:00.080 --> 56:01.580
 about where are we at with this goal,

56:01.580 --> 56:03.440
 this thing that I'm trying to accomplish

56:03.440 --> 56:06.480
 and set those goals realistically

56:06.480 --> 56:08.400
 but inspirationally as well.

56:08.400 --> 56:10.720
 We wanna set a goal that will challenge us

56:10.720 --> 56:12.560
 but isn't impossible.

56:12.560 --> 56:14.540
 We don't wanna set goals that are too easy

56:14.540 --> 56:16.280
 because we're not gonna trick ourselves

56:16.280 --> 56:20.280
 into like feeling so great about doing one jumping jack.

56:20.280 --> 56:21.280
 Okay, great.

56:21.280 --> 56:23.220
 Like pretty sure most people,

56:23.220 --> 56:25.160
 if that's a goal, they can do one.

56:25.160 --> 56:27.440
 So are you gonna feel so great when you hit that goal?

56:27.440 --> 56:29.040
 No, because it was too easy.

56:29.040 --> 56:32.160
 You didn't have any doubt that you could do that one.

56:32.160 --> 56:33.680
 But what about 25?

56:34.620 --> 56:37.280
 Okay, yeah, I might feel pretty good about that.

56:37.280 --> 56:40.040
 Well, what about the next group of 25 and now I'm at 50?

56:40.040 --> 56:41.280
 Those are goals that might seem

56:41.280 --> 56:42.840
 just beyond the brink of what's possible

56:42.840 --> 56:44.840
 but I will feel good when I hit that

56:44.840 --> 56:47.280
 and that's gonna give me the next sort of boost of energy

56:47.280 --> 56:48.960
 that I'm gonna need to go a little bit further,

56:48.960 --> 56:51.280
 either that time or the next time.

56:51.280 --> 56:53.360
 Yeah, I think vision is special.

56:53.360 --> 56:54.920
 Again, I'm strongly biased here.

56:54.920 --> 56:58.200
 My, you know, the reason I initially learned

56:58.200 --> 57:02.240
 about your work was, well, now you have this amazing book

57:02.240 --> 57:04.080
 but at the time there wasn't the book,

57:04.080 --> 57:06.040
 there were just the scientific papers

57:06.040 --> 57:08.800
 and of course upon which the book rests

57:09.880 --> 57:12.600
 and those papers are really important.

57:12.600 --> 57:15.240
 But was the relationship between vision

57:15.240 --> 57:17.000
 and obviously is our sense of space

57:17.000 --> 57:19.360
 but how the sense of space and time are related

57:19.360 --> 57:23.480
 and to make the idea quite simple for those listening,

57:23.480 --> 57:26.160
 you know, when you narrow your visual window,

57:26.160 --> 57:29.760
 you're measuring the time bin also gets smaller, right?

57:29.760 --> 57:31.200
 Which makes sense when you hear it

57:31.200 --> 57:33.960
 whereas if you take on a huge visual landscape,

57:33.960 --> 57:35.520
 you're actually carving up time differently.

57:35.520 --> 57:38.840
 It's sort of like moving from a slow frame rate

57:38.840 --> 57:40.180
 to a fine frame rate.

57:40.180 --> 57:42.920
 You know, slow motion camera is actually taking

57:42.920 --> 57:44.480
 a lot more snapshots, right?

57:44.480 --> 57:46.920
 So you're measuring distance over time more finely.

57:46.920 --> 57:49.600
 And so where a strobe would be the other example,

57:49.600 --> 57:51.880
 which is strobe is very low frequency.

57:51.880 --> 57:53.360
 So you're going here, here, here,

57:53.360 --> 57:55.240
 as opposed to, you know, slow motion, right?

57:55.240 --> 58:00.240
 Strobe gives a course view into the time domain

58:00.380 --> 58:02.460
 and high-speed photography gives a fine view

58:02.460 --> 58:03.520
 in the time domain.

58:03.520 --> 58:05.760
 So I'm almost certain without any knowledge

58:05.760 --> 58:07.840
 of underlying data,

58:07.840 --> 58:11.080
 but knowledge of the mechanism then,

58:11.080 --> 58:14.000
 I'm almost certain, if not certain,

58:14.000 --> 58:17.240
 that by placing a narrow visual aperture,

58:17.240 --> 58:19.680
 we change the way we perceive time.

58:19.680 --> 58:22.120
 Now I have a question and to be honest,

58:22.120 --> 58:23.280
 I know the answer in advance,

58:23.280 --> 58:26.640
 but I'd love for you to tell us a bit about

58:26.640 --> 58:31.080
 how some of this works still further in reverse,

58:31.080 --> 58:34.520
 meaning how unfit people view the world

58:34.520 --> 58:36.560
 versus how fit people view the world

58:36.560 --> 58:40.240
 or how unmotivated people visually see the world

58:40.240 --> 58:43.160
 as opposed to highly motivated people.

58:43.160 --> 58:45.280
 You talked about these elite runners,

58:45.280 --> 58:46.800
 you give them Michael Phelps's example,

58:46.800 --> 58:49.320
 but maybe you could describe that study.

58:49.320 --> 58:51.400
 I think it's a particularly important one,

58:51.400 --> 58:56.020
 mostly because yes, it identifies perhaps a physiological

58:56.020 --> 58:58.000
 or psychological differences between motivated

58:58.000 --> 59:01.080
 and unmotivated or fit and unfit people,

59:01.080 --> 59:04.900
 but it also provides a path to remedy that.

59:04.900 --> 59:08.700
 Yeah, so out of my lab,

59:08.700 --> 59:10.500
 but also out of several other labs,

59:10.500 --> 59:12.740
 there's been work looking at that relation

59:12.740 --> 59:16.200
 between states of the body and visual experiences.

59:16.200 --> 59:17.540
 They haven't necessarily tried

59:17.540 --> 59:21.780
 to integrate the motivation science element to it,

59:21.780 --> 59:25.100
 but they were looking to see the visual experiences change

59:25.100 --> 59:27.140
 as a function of different states of our body.

59:27.140 --> 59:30.300
 So they've looked at people who experienced chronic fatigue,

59:30.300 --> 59:33.260
 the elderly, people who are overweight,

59:33.260 --> 59:36.860
 those that are wearing heavy backpacks

59:36.860 --> 59:39.040
 and so who are sort of put into that experience

59:39.040 --> 59:40.140
 of being overweight,

59:40.140 --> 59:42.580
 what happens to their perceptions of the environment?

59:42.580 --> 59:45.420
 Well, what they find is that distances look further

59:45.420 --> 59:47.260
 to those that are overweight, chronically tired,

59:47.260 --> 59:50.620
 older rather than younger, weighted down with extra baggage,

59:51.740 --> 59:54.820
 distances look farther and hills look steeper.

59:54.820 --> 59:56.940
 We've done some of those studies too,

59:56.940 --> 59:59.400
 where we try to like give people more energy

59:59.400 --> 1:00:01.980
 or deprive them of energy

1:00:01.980 --> 1:00:04.980
 and see does that change their perception of space.

1:00:04.980 --> 1:00:09.260
 And we did that by sort of a classic technique

1:00:09.260 --> 1:00:11.580
 of a double blind study where the participant

1:00:11.580 --> 1:00:13.780
 doesn't really know what they're experiencing.

1:00:13.780 --> 1:00:16.900
 I thought you were gonna say a double espresso.

1:00:16.900 --> 1:00:21.020
 That is also a good psychological experience to give people.

1:00:22.220 --> 1:00:24.500
 Yeah, so a double blind experiment

1:00:24.500 --> 1:00:26.180
 where the participant doesn't really know

1:00:26.180 --> 1:00:28.340
 the full extent of what they're doing

1:00:28.340 --> 1:00:29.360
 or what they're experiencing

1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:32.500
 and the researcher who's interacting with them also doesn't.

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:34.380
 They do this a lot in medical studies.

1:00:34.380 --> 1:00:35.900
 You give somebody a drug

1:00:35.900 --> 1:00:38.700
 and you give somebody a placebo, a sugar pill

1:00:38.700 --> 1:00:42.140
 and then importantly, nobody really knows who's got what

1:00:42.140 --> 1:00:43.820
 until you've analyzed all the data

1:00:43.820 --> 1:00:44.820
 and the results are revealed

1:00:44.820 --> 1:00:47.020
 that these are the people that had the drug,

1:00:47.020 --> 1:00:48.340
 the active agent.

1:00:48.340 --> 1:00:50.420
 Same idea in the psychological research.

1:00:50.420 --> 1:00:53.300
 In this case, what we did was give people Kool-Aid to drink

1:00:53.300 --> 1:00:56.580
 and for some people that Kool-Aid was sweetened with sugar,

1:00:56.580 --> 1:00:58.780
 an actual caloric entity.

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:00.820
 It could give them energy.

1:01:00.820 --> 1:01:04.160
 Other people have drank Kool-Aid sweetened with Splenda.

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:05.320
 So yeah, it's sweet

1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:06.980
 but it actually doesn't have any caloric value.

1:01:06.980 --> 1:01:08.460
 You're not giving people energy.

1:01:08.460 --> 1:01:12.620
 You're just giving them that experience of sweetness.

1:01:12.620 --> 1:01:14.780
 Now, some people of course are really good at identifying

1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:17.100
 like what's real sugar and what's Splenda

1:01:17.100 --> 1:01:20.420
 but when you put it in a Kool-Aid, a pretty noxious powder,

1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:22.080
 it actually masked it for everybody

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:23.460
 and nobody had any idea.

1:01:23.460 --> 1:01:25.300
 Because it tastes like garbage to everybody.

1:01:25.300 --> 1:01:26.140
 It tastes like garbage.

1:01:26.140 --> 1:01:26.980
 Sorry Kool-Aid.

1:01:26.980 --> 1:01:29.020
 I'm sure there are many people that love Kool-Aid.

1:01:29.020 --> 1:01:32.100
 I guess the sales of Kool-Aid will reveal the data.

1:01:32.100 --> 1:01:32.920
 Yeah.

1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:35.060
 I grew up in Nebraska actually where Kool-Aid is from.

1:01:35.060 --> 1:01:36.380
 It originated in Nebraska.

1:01:36.380 --> 1:01:38.340
 So I do feel like I'm betraying my roots slightly

1:01:38.340 --> 1:01:40.900
 by casting some shade on Kool-Aid

1:01:40.900 --> 1:01:43.660
 but that's how it worked

1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:45.820
 is that we asked them to guess what they got.

1:01:45.820 --> 1:01:47.860
 We tested them afterwards and they were wrong.

1:01:47.860 --> 1:01:51.020
 So nobody is able to guess with accuracy

1:01:51.020 --> 1:01:52.740
 what was your drink sweetened with

1:01:52.740 --> 1:01:55.780
 which is important because they were blind.

1:01:55.780 --> 1:01:57.260
 The way that scientists use it,

1:01:57.260 --> 1:02:00.060
 they didn't know what it was that they were drinking.

1:02:00.060 --> 1:02:03.500
 We give them about 10 to 15 minutes

1:02:03.500 --> 1:02:05.040
 for that sugar to metabolize

1:02:05.040 --> 1:02:08.300
 and we measured their circulating blood glucose levels

1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:11.220
 to make sure that we had in fact given their body

1:02:11.220 --> 1:02:14.700
 a circulating glucose energy

1:02:14.700 --> 1:02:17.520
 that they might use in the next activity.

1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:20.140
 And the researcher again didn't know

1:02:20.140 --> 1:02:23.480
 whether they had just served sugar or Splenda.

1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:25.660
 Then we asked people to estimate distance.

1:02:25.660 --> 1:02:27.220
 So we gave some people more energy

1:02:27.220 --> 1:02:28.700
 or we kept others sort of at

1:02:28.700 --> 1:02:30.900
 like whatever their normal level was.

1:02:30.900 --> 1:02:32.160
 And what we found is that those people

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:34.820
 who didn't even know it but who had been given more energy

1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:37.660
 by drinking Kool-Aid sweetened with sugar

1:02:37.660 --> 1:02:40.780
 perceived their space as more constricted.

1:02:40.780 --> 1:02:43.340
 That visual illusion of proximity was induced.

1:02:43.340 --> 1:02:44.820
 They felt that their finish line,

1:02:44.820 --> 1:02:47.340
 again in the context of an exercise task,

1:02:47.340 --> 1:02:48.980
 was closer to them.

1:02:48.980 --> 1:02:51.820
 So in just the same way that these other physiology labs,

1:02:51.820 --> 1:02:53.840
 vision science physiology labs found that

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:55.740
 people who are chronically tired,

1:02:55.740 --> 1:02:58.420
 who don't feel like they have as much energy

1:02:58.420 --> 1:03:00.080
 or those that are physically weighted down

1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:04.540
 and for whom moving within an environment is more costly,

1:03:04.540 --> 1:03:06.420
 we could create that experience for people.

1:03:06.420 --> 1:03:08.460
 We did an experimental version of that,

1:03:08.460 --> 1:03:12.100
 that if you have more energy, the world looks easier.

1:03:12.100 --> 1:03:15.360
 The distances to a finish line don't look as far.

1:03:16.300 --> 1:03:19.220
 So that was some of the experimental evidence that we had

1:03:19.220 --> 1:03:20.700
 to show that people states their body

1:03:20.700 --> 1:03:22.680
 do impact their visual experience.

1:03:22.680 --> 1:03:24.660
 Now, I'm a motivation researcher.

1:03:24.660 --> 1:03:26.060
 So for me, the big question is,

1:03:26.060 --> 1:03:28.060
 well, what's the point of that study then,

1:03:28.060 --> 1:03:30.620
 besides just showing this connection between the body

1:03:30.620 --> 1:03:32.920
 and the eyes and the visual experience?

1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:35.620
 We think that that's fundamental to one of the reasons

1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:38.340
 that people experience difficulty when they're exercising.

1:03:38.340 --> 1:03:40.500
 When it's really harder for your body

1:03:40.500 --> 1:03:44.900
 because of its physical state to move within a space,

1:03:44.900 --> 1:03:46.980
 why don't, you might say like,

1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:48.420
 well, why don't they just go exercise?

1:03:48.420 --> 1:03:50.620
 Because the world looks harder to them.

1:03:50.620 --> 1:03:53.520
 Because that distance that they're supposed to walk

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:54.940
 because a doctor tells them to,

1:03:54.940 --> 1:03:56.900
 or that a partner encourages them to,

1:03:56.900 --> 1:03:58.900
 or a hill that they should hike up

1:03:58.900 --> 1:03:59.740
 because someone told them

1:03:59.740 --> 1:04:01.000
 that would be good for their health,

1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.580
 it looks more challenging to them

1:04:03.580 --> 1:04:08.580
 than it does to somebody who's in better physical health.

1:04:08.740 --> 1:04:11.580
 Now, if it looks that way, if it looks harder,

1:04:11.580 --> 1:04:14.300
 if it feels like it might be harder,

1:04:14.300 --> 1:04:16.760
 then psychologically, we know that it is.

1:04:16.760 --> 1:04:19.600
 When you have set yourself up psychologically, mentally,

1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:21.700
 for that kind of failure experience,

1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:23.580
 like I don't know that I have the resources

1:04:23.580 --> 1:04:26.680
 to get this job done, this looks really hard,

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:29.100
 you're already motivationally in a place

1:04:29.100 --> 1:04:32.820
 for this task to be closer to impossible for you.

1:04:32.820 --> 1:04:33.940
 So to put it all together then,

1:04:33.940 --> 1:04:35.780
 what we know is that people whose bodies

1:04:35.780 --> 1:04:38.960
 might make it more challenging for them to exercise

1:04:38.960 --> 1:04:41.300
 are seeing the world in a more challenging way,

1:04:41.300 --> 1:04:43.340
 and that is having these downstream motivational

1:04:43.340 --> 1:04:46.100
 and psychological effects that makes it less likely

1:04:46.100 --> 1:04:48.880
 for them to try to take on the task in the first place

1:04:48.880 --> 1:04:53.320
 or to experience it as harder than other people would or do.

1:04:54.780 --> 1:04:57.660
 Is the solution the same, however?

1:04:57.660 --> 1:04:59.820
 Meaning if these people are taught

1:04:59.820 --> 1:05:02.380
 to adjust their visual goal line

1:05:02.380 --> 1:05:05.600
 or to set a visual spotlight on an intermediate goal,

1:05:05.600 --> 1:05:09.420
 can they overcome some of this challenge

1:05:09.420 --> 1:05:12.620
 that they face simply by virtue of their skewed perception?

1:05:12.620 --> 1:05:16.060
 Yes, so in all of the studies that we have done,

1:05:16.060 --> 1:05:17.460
 looking at that connection between

1:05:17.460 --> 1:05:18.980
 this narrowed focus of attention

1:05:18.980 --> 1:05:21.060
 and improvements in exercise,

1:05:21.060 --> 1:05:23.180
 we do not find that it only works

1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:24.300
 for the people who are in shape

1:05:24.300 --> 1:05:26.620
 or that it backfires for people who are out of shape.

1:05:26.620 --> 1:05:28.340
 It works for everybody.

1:05:28.340 --> 1:05:30.340
 This is a strategy that everybody can adopt

1:05:30.340 --> 1:05:32.020
 because it's just simply about

1:05:32.020 --> 1:05:34.180
 what do you allocate attentional resources to?

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:37.260
 What do you sort of ignore and what do you focus on?

1:05:37.260 --> 1:05:40.500
 And that visually induces the same kind of illusion

1:05:40.500 --> 1:05:42.860
 for everybody regardless of whether you're overweight

1:05:42.860 --> 1:05:44.860
 or you're at your target weight,

1:05:45.940 --> 1:05:47.020
 or if you're struggling to get there

1:05:47.020 --> 1:05:49.320
 or you've already accomplished where you want to be,

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:51.700
 that visual illusion can be induced for everybody

1:05:51.700 --> 1:05:54.340
 and it has the same kinds of consequences.

1:05:54.340 --> 1:05:55.840
 Terrific.

1:05:55.840 --> 1:05:57.940
 Earlier I made a joke about double espresso,

1:05:57.940 --> 1:06:00.420
 but now I'll make a serious statement about double espresso,

1:06:00.420 --> 1:06:02.380
 which is that it contains caffeine

1:06:02.380 --> 1:06:04.180
 and caffeine as a stimulant,

1:06:04.180 --> 1:06:05.880
 like all other stimulants,

1:06:07.060 --> 1:06:09.460
 cause a change in our visual world.

1:06:09.460 --> 1:06:10.980
 The most salient one is the one

1:06:10.980 --> 1:06:12.380
 that police officers look for,

1:06:12.380 --> 1:06:14.260
 parents suspecting that their kids

1:06:14.260 --> 1:06:17.960
 have ingested substances of any kind look for,

1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:20.740
 which is if somebody's pupils are unusually large

1:06:20.740 --> 1:06:23.260
 for a given visual environment,

1:06:23.260 --> 1:06:27.500
 that is an indication of high levels of autonomic arousal.

1:06:27.500 --> 1:06:29.320
 In the street drug translation of this,

1:06:29.320 --> 1:06:31.340
 people who take amphetamine or cocaine

1:06:31.340 --> 1:06:32.420
 will have very big pupils.

1:06:32.420 --> 1:06:33.920
 People are very relaxed, have small pupils.

1:06:33.920 --> 1:06:34.980
 However, everyone should know

1:06:34.980 --> 1:06:37.340
 that pupil size also is dynamically regulated

1:06:37.340 --> 1:06:38.820
 by how bright a visual environment.

1:06:38.820 --> 1:06:41.140
 So there are multiple things controlling pupil size.

1:06:41.140 --> 1:06:44.260
 However, we know that when we are very stressed

1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:47.400
 or very aroused in any way, positive or negative,

1:06:47.400 --> 1:06:50.300
 the pupils get big, but within the visual system,

1:06:50.300 --> 1:06:54.060
 what that equates to is a narrowing of the visual aperture.

1:06:55.060 --> 1:06:57.140
 So rather than ingesting sugar,

1:06:57.140 --> 1:06:59.140
 which I'm guessing most of the world,

1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:00.940
 certainly the U.S. needs to ingest less sugar,

1:07:00.940 --> 1:07:02.020
 at least that's what we're hearing.

1:07:02.020 --> 1:07:03.900
 I'm sure there are a few sugar,

1:07:03.900 --> 1:07:07.060
 you know, sucronistas out there, sucrosanistas,

1:07:07.060 --> 1:07:08.740
 who will also come after me with pitchforks,

1:07:08.740 --> 1:07:09.580
 but let's face it,

1:07:09.580 --> 1:07:10.660
 most people will probably be better off

1:07:10.660 --> 1:07:12.200
 ingesting less simple sugar,

1:07:13.300 --> 1:07:15.200
 but caffeine is a great motivator

1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:17.020
 because of the internal sense of arousal,

1:07:17.020 --> 1:07:18.940
 but it also narrows our visual window.

1:07:18.940 --> 1:07:22.320
 I could imagine using healthy amounts of caffeine

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:25.540
 combined with maybe even blinders of the sort

1:07:25.540 --> 1:07:28.800
 that horses wear, maybe like a hoodie and a hat,

1:07:28.800 --> 1:07:31.820
 maybe even blinders in order to get over

1:07:31.820 --> 1:07:33.820
 some of those more challenging milestones.

1:07:33.820 --> 1:07:37.020
 Is there any evidence that people are doing this without,

1:07:37.020 --> 1:07:38.220
 well, obviously people are doing it

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:39.520
 without knowledge of how it works,

1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:43.220
 but are there any studies looking at how adrenaline

1:07:43.220 --> 1:07:46.680
 or epinephrine or any other stimulants impact motivation?

1:07:48.380 --> 1:07:50.220
 I don't know, honestly, yeah.

1:07:50.220 --> 1:07:51.900
 I mean, energy drinks are a big thing now.

1:07:51.900 --> 1:07:54.940
 Yeah, yeah, for sure they are.

1:07:54.940 --> 1:07:57.580
 And, you know, if you actually are

1:07:57.580 --> 1:08:00.260
 more physiologically aroused or jazzed or whatever,

1:08:00.260 --> 1:08:02.020
 you know, amped up,

1:08:02.020 --> 1:08:05.080
 or you just think you are in our studies,

1:08:05.080 --> 1:08:06.780
 we have found that they work in the same way,

1:08:06.780 --> 1:08:09.040
 that it can produce the same kinds of consequences.

1:08:09.040 --> 1:08:11.140
 So, and I like that because it tells us

1:08:11.140 --> 1:08:13.220
 like you can actually change the state of your body

1:08:13.220 --> 1:08:15.860
 to induce these kinds of experiences,

1:08:15.860 --> 1:08:18.660
 or you can try to, you can just think that.

1:08:18.660 --> 1:08:19.620
 You can trick yourself.

1:08:19.620 --> 1:08:21.900
 You can placebo effect yourself out

1:08:21.900 --> 1:08:23.780
 and produce the same kinds of effects.

1:08:23.780 --> 1:08:25.420
 I had to give up coffee like 12 years ago,

1:08:25.420 --> 1:08:30.420
 not for any, I love the taste, and so decaf is my jam,

1:08:31.020 --> 1:08:32.220
 but I can't drink the caffeine

1:08:32.220 --> 1:08:33.980
 because it didn't actually do the thing

1:08:33.980 --> 1:08:35.740
 that it does for so many other people,

1:08:35.740 --> 1:08:37.420
 like make me feel more energized and more awake.

1:08:37.420 --> 1:08:38.980
 I just got sweaty and jittery and anxious,

1:08:38.980 --> 1:08:39.820
 and I couldn't focus.

1:08:39.820 --> 1:08:41.920
 Yeah, some people who already have

1:08:41.920 --> 1:08:45.420
 a fairly high baseline level of attention and motivation,

1:08:45.420 --> 1:08:47.940
 they find that it puts the autonomic seesaw too far

1:08:47.940 --> 1:08:49.420
 in the sympathetic tone.

1:08:49.420 --> 1:08:50.260
 Yeah. Yeah.

1:08:50.260 --> 1:08:51.700
 And I happen to marry the same kind of person.

1:08:51.700 --> 1:08:54.880
 He also can't drink caffeine, but loves the taste of coffee.

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:56.460
 The interesting thing is that we both

1:08:56.460 --> 1:08:57.700
 have to have coffee in the morning

1:08:57.700 --> 1:09:00.260
 to feel like we're ready to go for the day.

1:09:00.260 --> 1:09:02.760
 So it's just part of our routine or whatever

1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:04.840
 to have that taste and have that sensation

1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:06.340
 to feel like I'm ready to take on the day,

1:09:06.340 --> 1:09:07.380
 even though, I mean, yeah,

1:09:07.380 --> 1:09:09.940
 decaf still has some caffeine in it,

1:09:09.940 --> 1:09:11.100
 but we're not drinking that much of it

1:09:11.100 --> 1:09:14.620
 to probably actually create a caffeinated experience

1:09:14.620 --> 1:09:17.700
 in our body, but we're tricking ourselves psychologically

1:09:17.700 --> 1:09:20.200
 into doing that thing that in years past

1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:22.240
 used to work for us both.

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:23.820
 So I think that's something to keep in mind.

1:09:23.820 --> 1:09:25.700
 Like, you know, you might have a hoodie

1:09:25.700 --> 1:09:28.540
 that you can wear to induce that visual illusion,

1:09:28.540 --> 1:09:30.380
 or you can take advantage of the power of your mind.

1:09:30.380 --> 1:09:31.940
 At the end of the day, I'm a psychologist,

1:09:31.940 --> 1:09:35.440
 and I believe that we have some non-zero power

1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:36.780
 over what our mind is doing,

1:09:36.780 --> 1:09:37.820
 what we're thinking about,

1:09:37.820 --> 1:09:41.300
 what we allocate our attention to

1:09:41.300 --> 1:09:43.740
 that can do the same kind of thing that a hoodie might do

1:09:43.740 --> 1:09:46.120
 or that a cup of caffeine might do.

1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:47.340
 I completely agree.

1:09:47.340 --> 1:09:49.800
 The visual aperture is under our conscious control.

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:51.700
 That's an amazing feature of our visual system.

1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:53.060
 We can narrow or expand it.

1:09:53.060 --> 1:09:54.340
 It takes a little bit of practice, I think,

1:09:54.340 --> 1:09:55.780
 for people to learn how to do this

1:09:55.780 --> 1:09:57.140
 without moving their head around

1:09:57.140 --> 1:10:00.080
 to expand their visual aperture and how to narrow it.

1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:01.820
 But what I always tell people is

1:10:01.820 --> 1:10:03.820
 just imagine a really troubling text message

1:10:03.820 --> 1:10:05.540
 or a really exciting text message coming in.

1:10:05.540 --> 1:10:07.620
 All of a sudden, you forget about the world around you.

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:10.300
 So it can be triggered by these outside events,

1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:13.440
 and we can learn how to anchor our visual attention.

1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:16.900
 I'd love to ask about other kinds of goals,

1:10:16.900 --> 1:10:18.380
 meaning non-physical goals,

1:10:18.380 --> 1:10:23.380
 because many people are trying to read more, I would hope,

1:10:23.460 --> 1:10:25.580
 or learn music or a language

1:10:25.580 --> 1:10:28.940
 or things that really involve cognitive goal lines

1:10:28.940 --> 1:10:32.060
 or internal goal lines.

1:10:32.060 --> 1:10:35.020
 You know, reading one chapter out of a book each night

1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:37.060
 is a tangible goal.

1:10:37.060 --> 1:10:39.220
 The other that I've often wondered about

1:10:39.220 --> 1:10:40.900
 are these systems that allow you

1:10:40.900 --> 1:10:44.660
 to highlight individual lines or even words on a page.

1:10:44.660 --> 1:10:46.300
 That's very visual, obviously,

1:10:46.300 --> 1:10:48.260
 and everything else is ruled out except that word.

1:10:48.260 --> 1:10:49.660
 I've always wished for books

1:10:49.660 --> 1:10:51.700
 that would naturally highlight each page.

1:10:51.700 --> 1:10:53.320
 And as I say this, someone will put in the comments,

1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:54.740
 this has probably existed for 10 years,

1:10:54.740 --> 1:10:57.100
 and I'm just showing how what a luddite I am.

1:10:57.100 --> 1:11:02.100
 But is there any example or tactic that people could use

1:11:02.100 --> 1:11:03.840
 or tactic that people could use

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:06.520
 to better approach cognitive goals

1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:09.960
 of school, work, recreational too,

1:11:09.960 --> 1:11:13.340
 but that don't exist in the kind of fitness

1:11:13.340 --> 1:11:14.180
 and sports domain?

1:11:14.180 --> 1:11:15.020
 Totally.

1:11:15.020 --> 1:11:17.120
 Yeah, so just a shout out to my brother-in-law

1:11:17.120 --> 1:11:19.340
 who has done some of that research

1:11:19.340 --> 1:11:21.520
 where it does highlight different parts of words

1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:23.600
 in paragraphs, and he's found it to be an effective way

1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:26.840
 for English as a second language learners to pick it up,

1:11:26.840 --> 1:11:28.520
 that that is, that tying that vision

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:30.440
 to the process of learning language is effective.

1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:34.200
 And so there's, you know, a whole cool body of work

1:11:34.200 --> 1:11:35.680
 and researchers looking at that.

1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:36.960
 So you're right about that.

1:11:36.960 --> 1:11:39.320
 If you want to mention what he does,

1:11:39.320 --> 1:11:41.320
 is there a place that people can learn more about that?

1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:43.000
 We can provide links.

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:43.840
 Yeah, let me.

1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:46.320
 Okay, we will provide links to those resources

1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:47.400
 because I want those resources.

1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:50.160
 I've been trying to learn a second language for a long time.

1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:51.800
 I speak Spanish pretty weekly,

1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:53.480
 but I would love to get better at it.

1:11:53.480 --> 1:11:54.720
 Okay, I'll approach you later.

1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:56.400
 My five-year-old son speaks Spanish better

1:11:56.400 --> 1:11:57.400
 than I do at this point.

1:11:57.400 --> 1:12:01.680
 And clearly better than I do too, thank you.

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:03.880
 Yeah, so, you know, I was thinking that too.

1:12:03.880 --> 1:12:05.000
 You know, we started this work

1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:06.340
 within the context of exercise,

1:12:06.340 --> 1:12:08.040
 but of course that's not people's only goal

1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:12.840
 that they have in life, and it isn't mine either, you know?

1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:16.560
 I have interests outside of improving my exercise game.

1:12:17.560 --> 1:12:20.440
 A couple of years ago when I was writing the book,

1:12:20.440 --> 1:12:22.440
 I also had a child.

1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:24.680
 The same month that I had the opportunity

1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:26.880
 to like pull all this research together

1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:30.320
 is the same month that my son came to be.

1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:32.760
 And I started to realize, like,

1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:35.840
 I became a lot less interesting once he was around.

1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:38.800
 He was fascinating, but I was changing diapers

1:12:38.800 --> 1:12:40.240
 and feeding him, and like, that was it.

1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:41.960
 People would come over, like, what's up?

1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:42.780
 Where have you been?

1:12:42.780 --> 1:12:44.240
 Like, tell me something that's going on in your life.

1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:45.920
 And like, all I had to talk about was this,

1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:47.200
 what was boring.

1:12:47.200 --> 1:12:48.840
 And I just felt like I've lost myself.

1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:51.200
 I used to pride myself on like crazy adventures

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:52.640
 and problems I would get myself in,

1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:54.320
 and I was a great storyteller.

1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:55.760
 And that all of a sudden disappeared

1:12:55.760 --> 1:12:57.000
 as soon as he came into the world

1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.340
 because he became my world.

1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:00.280
 So then I started thinking, like,

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:02.680
 I need to pull back some coolness

1:13:02.680 --> 1:13:04.040
 if I ever had it in the first place,

1:13:04.040 --> 1:13:05.440
 but I need to be a cooler person

1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:07.200
 than I'm coming across right now.

1:13:07.200 --> 1:13:09.800
 So I decided I want to learn to play drums,

1:13:09.800 --> 1:13:11.680
 and I want to be like a one-hit wonder

1:13:11.680 --> 1:13:14.600
 as a rock star drummer.

1:13:14.600 --> 1:13:15.560
 I only want one song,

1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:17.200
 because I know I'm not gonna be able to do more than that.

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:19.520
 I'm not coordinated at all.

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:22.760
 Like, from the beginning of time in fifth grade,

1:13:22.760 --> 1:13:25.080
 I have this really vivid, like, flashbulb memory

1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:27.040
 of playing basketball for the very first time.

1:13:27.040 --> 1:13:27.880
 I lost my footing.

1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:29.240
 I knocked into my own teammate,

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.800
 pushed her out of bounds where she had the ball.

1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:31.640
 We lost the game,

1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:34.960
 and I was not invited back on the team for the next season.

1:13:34.960 --> 1:13:36.040
 And so that, you know,

1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:39.860
 fermented my self-definition of uncoordinated.

1:13:39.860 --> 1:13:42.400
 I am a musician, but I am not a drummer.

1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:45.880
 And the idea of coordinating four limbs in real time

1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:49.360
 was like, if I could do that, I would be so proud.

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:51.140
 So that's a goal that I set for myself

1:13:51.140 --> 1:13:53.640
 at the same time that my son came into this world

1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:56.800
 when I was also trying to think about goal setting

1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:58.800
 and how to improve my ability

1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:01.280
 and all of our ability to get a job done

1:14:01.280 --> 1:14:04.560
 when you're faced with some pretty big obstacles.

1:14:04.560 --> 1:14:06.320
 So I got to practice all these techniques

1:14:06.320 --> 1:14:08.720
 that we're talking about on myself and see for myself.

1:14:08.720 --> 1:14:10.380
 When I tell people, hey, try this thing,

1:14:10.380 --> 1:14:11.480
 like narrow focus of attention,

1:14:11.480 --> 1:14:15.240
 does it help with something like becoming a better drummer?

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:16.360
 And the answer is, yeah.

1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:18.580
 These tactics at least work for me sometimes

1:14:18.580 --> 1:14:19.640
 under some circumstances,

1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:21.520
 and they do for other people who try them for other goals

1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:23.780
 that aren't necessarily about exercise.

1:14:25.180 --> 1:14:28.000
 One that I found particularly helpful

1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:31.420
 was overcoming my bad memory.

1:14:31.420 --> 1:14:34.420
 That everybody's memories are faulty, right?

1:14:34.420 --> 1:14:37.800
 Everybody has sort of a warped perception of the past.

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:40.440
 It might be skewed more positively than maybe we deserve,

1:14:40.440 --> 1:14:42.280
 or it might be skewed more negatively

1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:45.520
 if you feel that what looms large in your mind

1:14:45.520 --> 1:14:47.480
 as you reflect on something from the past,

1:14:47.480 --> 1:14:49.000
 or the mistakes that you've made,

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:52.320
 or the things that, the social faux pas that you had,

1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:54.960
 or challenges that you faced at work

1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:57.360
 when you got in trouble with a boss or with a colleague,

1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:00.400
 if that's what really stands out in your mind,

1:15:00.400 --> 1:15:02.960
 or the good side of all of those possibilities,

1:15:02.960 --> 1:15:04.960
 we probably aren't getting the world right.

1:15:04.960 --> 1:15:08.100
 And that is something that our brain has evolved,

1:15:08.100 --> 1:15:11.360
 to give us a faulty memory, to level and sharpen,

1:15:11.360 --> 1:15:13.600
 to not encode and remember and be able to recall

1:15:13.600 --> 1:15:15.040
 everything that we've experienced

1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:17.520
 with accuracy and precision.

1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:19.560
 And that's a problem when it comes

1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:22.160
 to assessing our own goal progress,

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:24.400
 when we wanna be our own accountant

1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:26.760
 and try to determine how are we doing?

1:15:26.760 --> 1:15:28.600
 If I wanna become a drummer,

1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:31.960
 am I on track for getting there before X,

1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:34.320
 before my time runs out?

1:15:34.320 --> 1:15:36.080
 Am I gonna make it or not?

1:15:36.080 --> 1:15:37.280
 And I think that's an experience,

1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:38.320
 whether they wanna be a drummer or not,

1:15:38.320 --> 1:15:39.760
 that a lot of people can resonate with,

1:15:39.760 --> 1:15:42.680
 of like trying to determine is this trajectory,

1:15:42.680 --> 1:15:45.080
 is this rate of progress gonna get the job done

1:15:45.080 --> 1:15:46.280
 by X amount of time?

1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:48.240
 Will I have my swimsuit body by summer

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:52.780
 or will I save enough for retirement by the time I hit 65?

1:15:52.780 --> 1:15:54.720
 For these goals where time is involved

1:15:54.720 --> 1:15:56.400
 and there is a deadline,

1:15:56.400 --> 1:16:01.120
 we do take moments to assess our trajectory.

1:16:01.120 --> 1:16:03.500
 And if we just rely on our memory,

1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:05.520
 we're probably gonna do a bad job

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:08.780
 of assessing that trajectory,

1:16:08.780 --> 1:16:12.440
 of knowing whether we're on pace to meeting our deadline.

1:16:12.440 --> 1:16:14.360
 And I found that to be the case as I was thinking about,

1:16:14.360 --> 1:16:16.360
 am I actually gonna be able to learn this song?

1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:18.040
 I mean, I know that it's going a lot slower

1:16:18.040 --> 1:16:20.200
 than it probably would for anybody else,

1:16:20.200 --> 1:16:22.560
 but to give myself a deadline and a commitment,

1:16:22.560 --> 1:16:24.040
 I decided I was gonna put on a show.

1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:25.880
 I was gonna invite everybody I knew

1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:27.440
 and also people I didn't know,

1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:30.220
 and I was gonna play my one song for them.

1:16:31.120 --> 1:16:32.360
 This is while writing a book

1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:33.680
 and having just had a child.

1:16:33.680 --> 1:16:37.400
 Yeah, so when you read the book, you'll see my story

1:16:37.400 --> 1:16:39.360
 and it's the real truth of it.

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:43.960
 I mean, I did play that show and it was fine.

1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:46.160
 And then I've, because I wrote about it in the book,

1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:49.320
 then some other opportunities to play it publicly

1:16:49.320 --> 1:16:51.320
 have come up and it's like, all right,

1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:52.440
 I told people I can play drums.

1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:56.280
 I better show them that I actually still can play this song.

1:16:56.280 --> 1:16:57.800
 Yeah, so that's been fun.

1:16:57.800 --> 1:16:59.240
 I have become a one hit wonder

1:16:59.240 --> 1:17:00.600
 if you ask me to play the song again,

1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:03.320
 like Encore, it's just gonna get that same song

1:17:03.320 --> 1:17:06.240
 a second time, so literally one hit wonder.

1:17:06.240 --> 1:17:08.080
 So in the process of figuring out,

1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:09.600
 am I gonna be able to play this show,

1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:12.040
 I sent out invitations, the date is committed.

1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:16.080
 People are coming to listen to my one song, God bless them.

1:17:17.400 --> 1:17:18.800
 How's it gonna go?

1:17:18.800 --> 1:17:20.400
 And it felt awful.

1:17:20.400 --> 1:17:22.800
 It just felt like I am not making progress here

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:24.400
 because there's a lot more things

1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:25.800
 that actually are pressing, right?

1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:28.120
 Like the kid does need to get fed.

1:17:28.120 --> 1:17:29.960
 I do have to go to my day job.

1:17:29.960 --> 1:17:33.120
 The editor is asking for the next draft of this book

1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:34.680
 and that is gonna take precedence

1:17:34.680 --> 1:17:35.800
 like it does for so many people,

1:17:35.800 --> 1:17:38.920
 that things command your bandwidth

1:17:38.920 --> 1:17:41.040
 even when you have this goal that you've committed to

1:17:41.040 --> 1:17:43.480
 and that you've got on the books.

1:17:43.480 --> 1:17:45.440
 And so I just felt this looming anxiety

1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:48.400
 about this goal that would require,

1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:49.680
 didn't have to be daily practice,

1:17:49.680 --> 1:17:53.480
 but you can't cram that kind of a goal.

1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:56.320
 It does take committed investment

1:17:56.320 --> 1:17:58.880
 for a sustained period of time.

1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:00.320
 And so I had this looming anxiety

1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:02.720
 that I'm not making good enough progress.

1:18:02.720 --> 1:18:04.480
 But that's because I was relying on my memory

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:07.520
 and my brain to recall, how many times did you practice?

1:18:07.520 --> 1:18:08.960
 What was it like the last time you practiced?

1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:11.520
 What was it like when you tried to play this bit,

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:13.320
 or this riff like two weeks ago,

1:18:13.320 --> 1:18:15.280
 have you gotten any better since then?

1:18:15.280 --> 1:18:18.120
 And it just felt like, no, I haven't practiced enough.

1:18:18.120 --> 1:18:19.720
 I don't remember when the last time I played was,

1:18:19.720 --> 1:18:22.240
 but it definitely doesn't feel like I'm getting any better.

1:18:22.240 --> 1:18:23.680
 Then I thought, you know what?

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:25.240
 I should stop relying on my brain

1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:30.240
 to tell me where am I at and am I on an upward slope here?

1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:31.480
 I need to look at the data.

1:18:31.480 --> 1:18:33.320
 I love data, scientists love data.

1:18:33.320 --> 1:18:35.720
 So I started to collect data on myself.

1:18:35.720 --> 1:18:37.920
 What I did was download this app

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:40.400
 that a friend had told me about called the Reporter app.

1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:42.480
 There's lots of these kinds of things out there.

1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:44.400
 Basically, it just like sets up your phone

1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:45.880
 to randomly ping you

1:18:45.880 --> 1:18:48.320
 with whatever questions you want your phone to ask.

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:50.360
 It records your answers, you can download the data,

1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:54.560
 you can make pretty graphs to see what's my change

1:18:54.560 --> 1:18:57.840
 and how I've answered these questions over time.

1:18:57.840 --> 1:18:59.160
 So I did that for a month.

1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:03.480
 For a month, I had my phone ask me a couple times a day,

1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:04.600
 oh, maybe twice a day, really.

1:19:04.600 --> 1:19:07.120
 Did you practice since last time I asked you?

1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:09.160
 My phone says, did you practice?

1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:10.760
 If mostly it was no.

1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:13.600
 And if yes, then it would funnel a couple other questions

1:19:13.600 --> 1:19:14.680
 like how did you do?

1:19:14.680 --> 1:19:15.880
 How do you feel?

1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:17.800
 Check a couple of different emotion words now

1:19:17.800 --> 1:19:20.720
 about your experience when you played.

1:19:20.720 --> 1:19:22.640
 So when I, and I did that for a month.

1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:25.480
 After a month, went into my office, downloaded the data

1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:28.240
 and first took stock before I looked at the numbers

1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:30.800
 like how do I think I did over the last month?

1:19:30.800 --> 1:19:33.320
 And I thought, same as every other month,

1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:34.880
 I didn't really get anywhere.

1:19:34.880 --> 1:19:37.280
 Yeah, I practiced, but I still feel awful.

1:19:37.280 --> 1:19:38.240
 And I cried.

1:19:38.240 --> 1:19:39.560
 I cried having to practice.

1:19:39.560 --> 1:19:41.920
 I like was upset with myself for setting this goal

1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:43.560
 and feeling like so anxious about it.

1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:44.960
 All I remember is that I cried.

1:19:44.960 --> 1:19:47.760
 Cried too much about this personal conquest

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:49.200
 that wouldn't matter to anybody else.

1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:50.240
 Honestly, it really doesn't matter

1:19:50.240 --> 1:19:51.560
 in the scope of things anyway.

1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:54.120
 I'm not gonna become a drummer professionally.

1:19:54.120 --> 1:19:57.720
 So who cares if I embarrass myself publicly?

1:19:57.720 --> 1:19:59.480
 But what I found from the data

1:19:59.480 --> 1:20:01.040
 was my memory was totally wrong.

1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:04.680
 I actually had practiced far more times than I remembered.

1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:07.880
 And when I looked at like my emotion words that I used,

1:20:07.880 --> 1:20:09.920
 it was a clear upward trajectory.

1:20:09.920 --> 1:20:11.240
 Yeah, I did cry.

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:13.840
 That part I hadn't misremembered or made up.

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:14.920
 But by the end of that month,

1:20:14.920 --> 1:20:16.800
 like I had gotten a compliment from my husband

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:18.680
 who actually is a drummer and said like,

1:20:18.680 --> 1:20:20.280
 hey, that wasn't that bad.

1:20:20.280 --> 1:20:21.560
 And then there was like one expletive,

1:20:21.560 --> 1:20:24.200
 you were effing amazing at that one thing

1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:25.640
 you've been practicing at.

1:20:25.640 --> 1:20:27.560
 But like, okay, fine, he's my husband, right?

1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:29.080
 Is he just, you know, so at the moment,

1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:30.720
 it didn't really feel that great.

1:20:30.720 --> 1:20:32.000
 And I downplayed it and as a result,

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.840
 it didn't stick in my brain, right?

1:20:33.840 --> 1:20:35.920
 I remember how stupid it felt that I cried

1:20:35.920 --> 1:20:38.720
 because I can't do this, I can't make progress.

1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:40.040
 And I downplayed in my mind,

1:20:40.040 --> 1:20:41.080
 the thing that actually should have been

1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:44.440
 a legitimate indicator that progress was being made.

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:46.640
 So all of which is to say,

1:20:46.640 --> 1:20:49.840
 I needed to see, to collect that data on myself

1:20:49.840 --> 1:20:53.520
 and to look at it objectively, accurately and completely

1:20:53.520 --> 1:20:56.600
 because my brain wasn't doing that for me.

1:20:56.600 --> 1:21:00.880
 That visual experience of downloading that data

1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:05.600
 and looking at like, what was my actual experience,

1:21:05.600 --> 1:21:06.760
 gave me a better insight.

1:21:06.760 --> 1:21:10.600
 As I was trying to assess the trajectory of my progress,

1:21:10.600 --> 1:21:14.280
 I became a more accurate accountant of my own progress,

1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:16.000
 which is important for, you know,

1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:17.600
 setting goals or resetting them

1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:20.480
 when you need to calibrate in light of what's left to do

1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:22.840
 and how much time do you have to do it in.

1:21:22.840 --> 1:21:23.680
 I love it.

1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:26.240
 So basically, if I understand correctly,

1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:30.520
 when the intermediate goals of say daily practice

1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:34.160
 or twice a day practice or reading or math, et cetera,

1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:36.680
 are not a visual goal line,

1:21:36.680 --> 1:21:39.680
 it really does help to visualize some aspect

1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:41.560
 related to that non-visual goal line.

1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:44.600
 In this case, the reporter app was a useful tool.

1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:45.440
 I've never heard of it.

1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:46.680
 I plan to use it.

1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:48.440
 I'm sure a number of people will be interested in it.

1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:49.640
 It sounds like there are others out there,

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:51.480
 but that's the one that you found most useful.

1:21:51.480 --> 1:21:52.320
 Yeah.

1:21:52.320 --> 1:21:54.160
 Yeah, there's another one too

1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:57.280
 that is even more visual than that, than the reporter app.

1:21:57.280 --> 1:21:58.600
 Although that has visual components

1:21:58.600 --> 1:22:00.440
 and is really effective if you like data

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:03.800
 and wanna collect numbers on yourself or your experience,

1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:06.760
 there's another one called the One Second Every Day app.

1:22:06.760 --> 1:22:10.120
 This is really awesome because the app is a mechanism

1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:14.560
 to record one second of your life.

1:22:14.560 --> 1:22:17.160
 The goal, there's such an awesome community of people

1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:20.460
 that just live by this and love having these experiences.

1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:25.040
 And the creator of it, I got a chance to talk with,

1:22:25.040 --> 1:22:26.120
 and he has done this.

1:22:26.120 --> 1:22:29.520
 He's taken a one second video of some aspect of his life

1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:33.200
 every day for 12 years, 13 years or something.

1:22:33.200 --> 1:22:34.040
 One second?

1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:35.240
 Yeah, one second.

1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:38.720
 And then what the app does is like smash them together

1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:41.600
 and give you like a chronology of what your year

1:22:41.600 --> 1:22:45.060
 or your month or your last decade of life has been like

1:22:45.060 --> 1:22:47.280
 and presents it as like a streamlined video for you.

1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:50.000
 So you just see these flashes of your life

1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:51.680
 over however long you tell the app

1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:54.700
 to create a montage for you.

1:22:54.700 --> 1:22:56.400
 And so when you see these videos that people have made,

1:22:56.400 --> 1:22:57.380
 especially those that have been doing it

1:22:57.380 --> 1:22:59.240
 for a really long time, it's fascinating.

1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:00.600
 I did that for myself too.

1:23:00.600 --> 1:23:01.440
 I tried it.

1:23:01.440 --> 1:23:03.520
 One second of today's drumming performance.

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:05.840
 Another second, it's not enough to capture it.

1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:07.360
 Am I actually doing a good job of drumming

1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:09.300
 or what's my trajectory for drumming?

1:23:09.300 --> 1:23:13.200
 But the guy who made it says one of the most like awesome

1:23:13.200 --> 1:23:16.480
 one second videos that he ever made is of a brick wall.

1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:18.100
 I was like, well, you don't need a video of that.

1:23:18.100 --> 1:23:19.080
 Like what's the wall doing?

1:23:19.080 --> 1:23:20.200
 It's not crumbling.

1:23:20.200 --> 1:23:22.280
 It's not like in earthquake land or something like that.

1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:23.560
 It's just like, you know,

1:23:23.560 --> 1:23:26.400
 slightly jittery one second of a brick wall.

1:23:26.400 --> 1:23:28.480
 And I was like, how is that motivating

1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:29.320
 or exciting to you?

1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:30.140
 Why is that?

1:23:30.140 --> 1:23:32.760
 You've been doing this for 13 years every day, one second.

1:23:32.760 --> 1:23:35.340
 Why is that the one second that matters to you most?

1:23:35.340 --> 1:23:38.400
 And he says, because when it comes up in my montage,

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:42.000
 it reminds me of like a really horrific moment in my family.

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:43.760
 That was the first wall that I saw

1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:44.660
 when I walked out of the room,

1:23:44.660 --> 1:23:46.560
 having heard that my sister-in-law

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:50.460
 had this awful, awful experience.

1:23:50.460 --> 1:23:53.280
 Her intestines started to twist up on themselves and not up.

1:23:53.280 --> 1:23:56.360
 And she was on the brink of death.

1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:57.920
 And we had just found this out.

1:23:57.920 --> 1:23:59.240
 She had just gotten into the hospital.

1:23:59.240 --> 1:24:02.440
 They diagnosed this issue that required immediate surgery.

1:24:02.440 --> 1:24:04.120
 And our family was there to hear about this.

1:24:04.120 --> 1:24:07.160
 And we were all stunned that she might die.

1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:09.100
 Like right now, she might die.

1:24:09.100 --> 1:24:10.360
 And that's the first thing that I saw.

1:24:10.360 --> 1:24:13.280
 And it reminds me of how precious life is,

1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:14.640
 how important family is,

1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:16.640
 and how the rest of whatever we were doing that day

1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:18.440
 didn't matter because we all needed

1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:19.880
 to be here together right now.

1:24:19.880 --> 1:24:22.260
 And that is like all of this emotion

1:24:22.260 --> 1:24:25.160
 and like purpose in life is conjured up

1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:27.800
 or reminded when he looks at one second

1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:30.720
 of a brick wall as it pops into his video feed.

1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:32.560
 So if you're visually oriented

1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:35.320
 and you do want ways to like remember what was life like,

1:24:35.320 --> 1:24:38.520
 what has my year in review, what does it look like?

1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:39.840
 That's an awesome app.

1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:42.940
 One second every day that can help you do that.

1:24:42.940 --> 1:24:44.360
 These are great recommendations.

1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:46.320
 And a couple of reflections.

1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:51.240
 First of all, the brick wall example is a beautiful way

1:24:51.240 --> 1:24:53.920
 of highlighting this other feature of the visual system,

1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:56.740
 which is that the brain largely thinks in symbols.

1:24:56.740 --> 1:24:57.920
 It's very efficient.

1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:00.880
 It batches entire experiences into symbols.

1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:02.480
 In this case, the brick wall can be attached

1:25:02.480 --> 1:25:04.880
 to a whole set of experiences that are very meaningful

1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:08.000
 to this individual that brick walls don't mean that

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.440
 or didn't mean that to me until hearing this.

1:25:10.440 --> 1:25:12.600
 So I think that it highlights the fact

1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:15.080
 that the actual symbol is less relevant

1:25:15.080 --> 1:25:17.040
 than what we attach to that symbol,

1:25:17.040 --> 1:25:19.320
 but that symbols are so efficient

1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:21.560
 that even in a one second view of something,

1:25:21.560 --> 1:25:24.640
 we can attach to it for better or for worse.

1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:29.120
 The other is that I'm an absolute almost rabid proponent

1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:31.560
 of people getting morning sunlight in their eyes

1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:34.480
 as the fundamental layer of setting their circadian rhythms

1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:36.680
 and sleep and health as a zero cost practice

1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:37.800
 that believe it or not can be done

1:25:37.800 --> 1:25:40.020
 anytime of year or anywhere.

1:25:40.020 --> 1:25:41.800
 But it does take a little bit of effort.

1:25:41.800 --> 1:25:42.800
 You know, you have to get outside.

1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:44.640
 You can't do it through a window or a windshield

1:25:44.640 --> 1:25:45.460
 for it to be efficient,

1:25:45.460 --> 1:25:47.880
 but it has huge outside effects on human health.

1:25:47.880 --> 1:25:51.080
 This has now been demonstrated again and again and again.

1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:54.180
 And so I'm going to just do a sort of call to action

1:25:54.180 --> 1:25:55.240
 if people aren't already doing this.

1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:57.080
 I'm going to start using the one second app

1:25:57.080 --> 1:25:59.580
 to record my morning sunlight viewing

1:25:59.580 --> 1:26:01.240
 and prove that even through cloud cover,

1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:03.880
 you're getting more photons than you are indoors

1:26:03.880 --> 1:26:04.940
 and that it's worthwhile.

1:26:04.940 --> 1:26:07.180
 I also would love to do this for my next dog

1:26:07.180 --> 1:26:09.960
 to go from puppy to a full-sized dog

1:26:09.960 --> 1:26:12.020
 and maybe even to the end, who knows?

1:26:13.660 --> 1:26:15.400
 Great, these are wonderful tools.

1:26:15.400 --> 1:26:18.320
 You've given us a huge number of practical tools,

1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:21.600
 which frankly isn't always the case on these podcasts.

1:26:21.600 --> 1:26:23.720
 We always strive to do science and science-based tools

1:26:23.720 --> 1:26:24.720
 is our kind of mantra,

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:27.960
 but you've given a rich set of tools here to apply.

1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:31.460
 I just want to briefly backtrack to something

1:26:31.460 --> 1:26:33.580
 and then a final question.

1:26:33.580 --> 1:26:36.100
 Earlier, we were talking about how unfit people

1:26:36.100 --> 1:26:37.480
 see the world as more challenging,

1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:40.040
 maybe even hills as steeper, distances as further,

1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:42.740
 and how shifting people into a state of energy,

1:26:42.740 --> 1:26:46.500
 either cognitively or through the ingestion of real glucose

1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:48.600
 to get an energetic lift or maybe through caffeine,

1:26:48.600 --> 1:26:49.820
 if that's within their practice

1:26:49.820 --> 1:26:54.820
 and span of healthy behaviors, they could do that.

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:57.960
 There are so many people who are suffering from depression,

1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:01.540
 which one of the key features of depression

1:27:01.540 --> 1:27:02.520
 is a lack of energy,

1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:05.520
 even though there can be anxiety associated with depression.

1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:09.640
 I have to wonder whether or not some of these tools

1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:11.820
 are being deployed or will be deployed

1:27:11.820 --> 1:27:13.280
 in the context of mental health

1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:16.260
 because depression is this vicious loop, right?

1:27:16.260 --> 1:27:19.740
 People feel a lack of energy and hopelessness

1:27:19.740 --> 1:27:21.440
 and then things just look harder

1:27:21.440 --> 1:27:24.700
 and so then it just verifies their negative worldview

1:27:24.700 --> 1:27:26.120
 and it's a downward spiral.

1:27:26.120 --> 1:27:29.340
 That's why medication in some cases and social sport,

1:27:29.340 --> 1:27:31.880
 et cetera, can be helpful because they feel more energized.

1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:34.740
 The side effects are a problem, however.

1:27:34.740 --> 1:27:36.640
 Have there been any efforts

1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:39.620
 to implement some of these visual tools

1:27:39.620 --> 1:27:42.720
 to create this increase in systolic blood pressure

1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:45.000
 and a kind of readiness and willingness to lean into

1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:46.940
 what people perceive as immense challenge?

1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:48.600
 And if not, for anyone listening,

1:27:48.600 --> 1:27:49.760
 I know we have a lot of listeners

1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:52.380
 in the mental health space and in the helping space,

1:27:52.380 --> 1:27:57.120
 so to speak, I can imagine these are zero cost, right?

1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:00.120
 They, we all provide with people are sighted,

1:28:00.120 --> 1:28:02.880
 have the apparati to do it.

1:28:02.880 --> 1:28:04.280
 Are you aware of any studies like this

1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:06.060
 or is your laboratory involved in any studies?

1:28:06.060 --> 1:28:09.920
 Cause I just see an immense value of implementing

1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:11.440
 the sorts of tools that you've developed.

1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:14.820
 Yeah, you know, we haven't explored those ideas directly.

1:28:14.820 --> 1:28:16.760
 So call to all the scientists that are out there,

1:28:16.760 --> 1:28:18.920
 this is, there's a great opportunity to start looking

1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:22.340
 at these tools within the mental health space, you're right.

1:28:22.340 --> 1:28:24.800
 Other researchers though have, you know,

1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:27.480
 not this use of narrowed,

1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:29.560
 like inducing a narrow attentional focus

1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:32.700
 and can they now feel more energized to go for a run,

1:28:32.700 --> 1:28:34.180
 but they have looked at the relationship

1:28:34.180 --> 1:28:37.400
 between anxiety, depression, and visual experience

1:28:37.400 --> 1:28:40.360
 and found, you know, over decades,

1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:42.920
 evidence that people with depression or with anxiety,

1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:45.480
 what their attention is captured by

1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:48.260
 within the bigger global surrounding world

1:28:48.260 --> 1:28:49.760
 are those things that are negative

1:28:49.760 --> 1:28:51.600
 or reinforcing of their worldview.

1:28:51.600 --> 1:28:52.660
 Now that happens for everybody.

1:28:52.660 --> 1:28:55.640
 The things that are on our mind tend to like pop out

1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:56.960
 that if whatever we're thinking about,

1:28:56.960 --> 1:28:59.400
 we might start seeing some version of it

1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:00.780
 showing up in the world around us

1:29:00.780 --> 1:29:02.700
 that captures our attention.

1:29:02.700 --> 1:29:04.440
 That's an idea called priming.

1:29:04.440 --> 1:29:06.680
 What we're thinking about might then lead us

1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:10.320
 to attend to the world, to see things in a way

1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:12.200
 that aligns with what we're already thinking about.

1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:13.800
 It's just that when what we're thinking about

1:29:13.800 --> 1:29:18.800
 are those depressive, ruminative, anxiety, fearful thoughts,

1:29:18.920 --> 1:29:20.800
 when that is what is cognitively accessible,

1:29:20.800 --> 1:29:22.360
 when that's what's going through our mind,

1:29:22.360 --> 1:29:25.000
 then that's also what captures our visual gaze.

1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.240
 So when we think like the world is hard,

1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:29.440
 the world is full of sadness,

1:29:29.440 --> 1:29:30.800
 and that's the thought in our mind,

1:29:30.800 --> 1:29:32.520
 and then we start seeing the people

1:29:32.520 --> 1:29:35.960
 with frowns on their faces or who are experiencing anxiety

1:29:35.960 --> 1:29:37.640
 and that's what captures our attention,

1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:39.220
 even when there's other people around

1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:40.640
 that might not be seeing the world

1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:42.680
 or experiencing the world that way,

1:29:42.680 --> 1:29:44.160
 it becomes reinforcing.

1:29:44.160 --> 1:29:46.180
 When I think that the world is threatening

1:29:46.180 --> 1:29:48.400
 and then I notice the threats that are around me

1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:49.440
 that confirms what I'm thinking,

1:29:49.440 --> 1:29:51.720
 which heightens my anxiety or my fear,

1:29:51.720 --> 1:29:54.960
 and then it further leads me to narrowly focus

1:29:54.960 --> 1:29:56.360
 on those elements of the environment

1:29:56.360 --> 1:29:58.320
 that are aligned with that worldview,

1:29:58.320 --> 1:30:00.160
 it's really hard to get out of that.

1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:02.720
 That's where the vicious cycle can come from.

1:30:02.720 --> 1:30:05.400
 So that has been really well established

1:30:05.400 --> 1:30:06.480
 within the medical community,

1:30:06.480 --> 1:30:10.080
 this selective attention relating

1:30:10.080 --> 1:30:14.280
 to states of mental unwellness,

1:30:14.280 --> 1:30:16.200
 that's been pretty well established.

1:30:16.200 --> 1:30:19.760
 And so there's been some interventions done

1:30:19.760 --> 1:30:22.360
 with people that have depression or anxiety trying,

1:30:22.360 --> 1:30:24.600
 saying like, here's an array,

1:30:24.600 --> 1:30:26.560
 a photograph of a bunch of different faces.

1:30:26.560 --> 1:30:27.380
 Yes, it's artificial,

1:30:27.380 --> 1:30:28.960
 it kind of looks like a page from a yearbook,

1:30:28.960 --> 1:30:30.440
 a high school yearbook,

1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:32.340
 but look for the faces that are smiling,

1:30:32.340 --> 1:30:34.320
 look at the faces that are smiling,

1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:38.640
 try right now, spend 10 minutes having your eyes focus

1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:41.080
 on those and look at those people,

1:30:41.080 --> 1:30:43.640
 that it is an effective intervention

1:30:43.640 --> 1:30:47.520
 at improving people's sense of self-efficacy

1:30:47.520 --> 1:30:48.840
 of what can I accomplish next?

1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:50.200
 They feel a little bit more energized.

1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:51.320
 It doesn't cure depression.

1:30:51.320 --> 1:30:52.880
 It doesn't cure anxiety.

1:30:52.880 --> 1:30:57.440
 And these are literal physical afflictions that we have.

1:30:57.440 --> 1:30:59.360
 So that's not a quick fix,

1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:01.520
 but it can produce a temporary change

1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:05.640
 that might be a way to start getting out of that rut.

1:31:05.640 --> 1:31:08.520
 Again, I think nowadays there's an increasing attention

1:31:08.520 --> 1:31:11.200
 on tools that will help people orient

1:31:11.200 --> 1:31:14.400
 as they start to veer towards suicidal depression

1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:17.440
 or veer back into a depressive episode or anxiety episode.

1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:21.040
 I mean, trying to reverse an entire syndrome

1:31:21.040 --> 1:31:23.220
 or set of syndromes is far more complicated.

1:31:23.220 --> 1:31:24.360
 Likewise in the health space,

1:31:24.360 --> 1:31:26.560
 just trying to get people to deploy real-time tools

1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:31.560
 to adjust their anxiety or to exercise more often and so on.

1:31:31.600 --> 1:31:34.960
 As a kind of a final, but also again, a high-level question,

1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:36.920
 I'm imagining that,

1:31:36.920 --> 1:31:40.760
 and I plan to use this visual goal setting of spotlighting.

1:31:40.760 --> 1:31:42.840
 I've been using it actually for some time on runs.

1:31:42.840 --> 1:31:43.680
 It works really well.

1:31:43.680 --> 1:31:45.520
 Yesterday, I took a run near the waterfront here

1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:48.720
 and the entire, I think I did it somewhat incorrectly.

1:31:48.720 --> 1:31:50.160
 The entire run, I was thinking about getting back

1:31:50.160 --> 1:31:52.580
 to the statue, which I started,

1:31:52.580 --> 1:31:56.120
 but I did find that I ran fastest in the final 20 meters,

1:31:56.120 --> 1:31:58.480
 which admittedly wasn't fast at all,

1:31:58.480 --> 1:32:00.720
 but it was faster than what preceded it.

1:32:00.720 --> 1:32:05.300
 So it works and it makes perfect sense as to how it works.

1:32:05.300 --> 1:32:08.580
 You've done other studies exploring some

1:32:08.580 --> 1:32:11.260
 of the other features of vision, like the luminosity,

1:32:11.260 --> 1:32:13.500
 how bright something is and how people perceive it.

1:32:13.500 --> 1:32:15.500
 That was in a completely different context,

1:32:15.500 --> 1:32:18.340
 but is there a kind of a higher level,

1:32:18.340 --> 1:32:19.660
 kind of a black belt version

1:32:19.660 --> 1:32:20.840
 of what we're talking about here,

1:32:20.840 --> 1:32:24.020
 where not only am I focusing on a specific visual location

1:32:24.020 --> 1:32:27.140
 as an intermediate or a long-term goal,

1:32:27.140 --> 1:32:29.720
 or I'm using an app to ask me a question

1:32:29.720 --> 1:32:30.980
 and tap into how I'm feeling,

1:32:30.980 --> 1:32:33.640
 create a visual representation of my motivational state,

1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:37.220
 but that I'm also making my phone as bright as possible.

1:32:37.220 --> 1:32:39.320
 I'm also trying to take that visual window

1:32:39.320 --> 1:32:42.140
 and actually pay attention to more of the details

1:32:42.140 --> 1:32:43.540
 at that location.

1:32:43.540 --> 1:32:47.460
 Or is this simply a matter of kind of in geek speak,

1:32:47.460 --> 1:32:49.180
 visual neuroscience, we would just call this

1:32:49.180 --> 1:32:50.420
 like low spatial frequency,

1:32:50.420 --> 1:32:52.300
 just sort of grabbing a black and white snapshot

1:32:52.300 --> 1:32:54.860
 of something here or there in my mind.

1:32:54.860 --> 1:32:57.340
 If I attach more detail and effort

1:32:57.340 --> 1:32:59.580
 to the specific thing that I'm focused on,

1:32:59.580 --> 1:33:02.380
 is there any evidence that that's more effective?

1:33:03.340 --> 1:33:05.820
 It certainly changes what our brains are doing.

1:33:05.820 --> 1:33:07.680
 So how do we define effectiveness?

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:09.340
 That's a question for philosophers

1:33:09.340 --> 1:33:10.180
 and that scientists will always-

1:33:10.180 --> 1:33:11.140
 Will it keep me running?

1:33:11.140 --> 1:33:12.620
 Yeah.

1:33:12.620 --> 1:33:14.520
 It will when you use it towards the end of your run,

1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:16.020
 just like you've picked up on.

1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:21.200
 Yeah, so there's cool studies that neuroscientists,

1:33:21.200 --> 1:33:23.160
 not I, not coming from my lab,

1:33:23.160 --> 1:33:25.060
 that neuroscientists have done looking at

1:33:25.060 --> 1:33:26.140
 what is it doing to your brain

1:33:26.140 --> 1:33:28.860
 when you've decided that you're gonna focus your attention

1:33:28.860 --> 1:33:31.500
 on this element of the world

1:33:31.500 --> 1:33:34.140
 and not pay attention to something else.

1:33:34.140 --> 1:33:36.380
 Is that just sort of like tricking your thoughts

1:33:36.380 --> 1:33:37.700
 or is it doing something different

1:33:37.700 --> 1:33:39.620
 to something more basic, more low level?

1:33:39.620 --> 1:33:41.420
 And the answer is yes.

1:33:41.420 --> 1:33:44.940
 So there's an area of the brain, the fusiform face area.

1:33:44.940 --> 1:33:46.860
 It's part of our brain that's really specialized

1:33:46.860 --> 1:33:49.140
 for making sense of faces.

1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:50.660
 It's important as a social species

1:33:50.660 --> 1:33:52.940
 to pay attention to other people,

1:33:52.940 --> 1:33:53.940
 pay attention to their faces,

1:33:53.940 --> 1:33:55.580
 what they're trying to communicate through their face.

1:33:55.580 --> 1:33:58.820
 So our brain has developed a really specialized

1:33:58.820 --> 1:34:01.540
 central area for doing that.

1:34:01.540 --> 1:34:05.300
 Then, and so these neuroscientists will present

1:34:05.300 --> 1:34:06.820
 like a face to somebody,

1:34:06.820 --> 1:34:11.680
 but superimposed over that is a house or something else

1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:16.580
 that is less special to us as a social human species.

1:34:16.580 --> 1:34:18.580
 And so both of those things,

1:34:18.580 --> 1:34:20.140
 because it's sort of like both images

1:34:20.140 --> 1:34:23.620
 are sort of transparent, overlaid over one another,

1:34:23.620 --> 1:34:28.620
 our eyes are getting both of those images in

1:34:29.140 --> 1:34:31.500
 and our brain is getting both of those images in,

1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:35.940
 but we can will ourselves to focus on the house.

1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:37.820
 Just really pay attention to the features of the house,

1:34:37.820 --> 1:34:40.220
 even though everything about that face is still there too,

1:34:40.220 --> 1:34:42.940
 or pay attention to the face and just tell me like,

1:34:42.940 --> 1:34:46.180
 what is it that you are deciding that you want to hold on to

1:34:46.180 --> 1:34:47.820
 that you want to look at right now?

1:34:47.820 --> 1:34:49.820
 And you can see that the brain is responding to that.

1:34:49.820 --> 1:34:51.100
 So when people are saying like,

1:34:51.100 --> 1:34:52.700
 I'm really seeing that face,

1:34:52.700 --> 1:34:55.380
 the details of the face, I'm paying attention to the face,

1:34:55.380 --> 1:34:58.180
 even though we know their eyes are also looking at

1:34:58.180 --> 1:35:00.620
 and engaged with the contents of the house,

1:35:00.620 --> 1:35:03.000
 that's right there, smacked on top,

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.360
 the fusiform face area lights up.

1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:06.460
 And when they're saying like,

1:35:06.460 --> 1:35:07.900
 no, I'm really focused on the house now,

1:35:07.900 --> 1:35:10.780
 we see activation in the fusiform face area decline

1:35:10.780 --> 1:35:15.740
 and other areas of the brain's neurological real estate

1:35:15.740 --> 1:35:17.180
 start to engage.

1:35:17.180 --> 1:35:22.180
 So yeah, I think there's something to it that we can,

1:35:22.180 --> 1:35:23.420
 at a high level,

1:35:24.700 --> 1:35:28.020
 our brains are responding to our psychology as well.

1:35:28.020 --> 1:35:31.420
 And we have that great power to really, you know,

1:35:31.420 --> 1:35:34.000
 with intention, with practice,

1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.580
 decide how do I want to engage with the world?

1:35:36.580 --> 1:35:40.380
 And can it produce real change in our bodies

1:35:40.380 --> 1:35:42.180
 and in the way that we experience the world?

1:35:42.180 --> 1:35:43.980
 The answer is yes.

1:35:43.980 --> 1:35:45.180
 Fantastic.

1:35:45.180 --> 1:35:50.180
 Well, you've given us a ton of mechanistic and conceptual

1:35:50.180 --> 1:35:53.000
 and practical information.

1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:56.020
 So I'm speaking for a lot of people when I say,

1:35:56.020 --> 1:35:58.260
 thank you for taking the time out of your schedule

1:35:58.260 --> 1:36:00.020
 amidst kids and running a lab

1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:02.300
 and teaching at the university and your book,

1:36:02.300 --> 1:36:05.740
 which we will point people to and provide a link to

1:36:06.700 --> 1:36:08.180
 is a wonderful resource.

1:36:08.180 --> 1:36:10.020
 And we hope to have you back again.

1:36:10.020 --> 1:36:10.860
 Thank you so much.

1:36:10.860 --> 1:36:11.860

1:37:29.620 --> 1:37:32.220
 There, I cover science and science-related tools,

1:37:32.220 --> 1:37:33.820
 some of which overlap with the contents

1:37:33.820 --> 1:37:34.980
 of the Huberman Lab podcast,

1:37:34.980 --> 1:37:37.100
 but much of which is distinct from the information

1:37:37.100 --> 1:37:38.360
 on the Huberman Lab podcast.

1:37:38.360 --> 1:37:40.220
 Again, it's Huberman Lab on Instagram

1:37:40.220 --> 1:37:42.060
 and Huberman Lab on Twitter.

1:37:42.060 --> 1:37:44.220
 And as mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,

1:37:44.220 --> 1:37:46.560
 we are now partnered with Momentus Supplements

1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:48.540
 because they make single ingredient formulations

1:37:48.540 --> 1:37:50.140
 that are of the absolute highest quality

1:37:50.140 --> 1:37:52.180
 and they ship international.

1:37:52.180 --> 1:37:54.820
 If you go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman,

1:37:54.820 --> 1:37:56.180
 you will find many of the supplements

1:37:56.180 --> 1:37:57.760
 that have been discussed on various episodes

1:37:57.760 --> 1:37:59.340
 of the Huberman Lab podcast,

1:37:59.340 --> 1:38:01.020
 and you will find various protocols

1:38:01.020 --> 1:38:02.380
 related to those supplements.

1:38:02.380 --> 1:38:04.180
 So thank you once again for joining us today

1:38:04.180 --> 1:38:06.020
 for our discussion about the science

1:38:06.020 --> 1:38:07.860
 and science-related tools of motivation,

1:38:07.860 --> 1:38:09.140
 goal-seeking, and pursuit.

1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:11.500
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:38:11.500 --> 1:38:13.300
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:38:13.300 --> 1:38:18.300
 We'll see you next time.
