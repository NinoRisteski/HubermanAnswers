00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.040
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.040 --> 00:15.200
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.200 --> 00:18.800
 Today, I have the pleasure of introducing Dr. Anna Lemke.

00:18.800 --> 00:20.560
 Dr. Lemke is a psychiatrist

00:20.560 --> 00:22.280
 and the chief of the addiction medicine

00:22.280 --> 00:23.600
 dual diagnosis clinic

00:23.600 --> 00:26.240
 at Stanford University School of Medicine.

00:26.240 --> 00:28.640
 She's a psychiatrist who treats patients

00:28.640 --> 00:30.580
 struggling with addiction.

00:30.580 --> 00:32.620
 She has successfully treated patients

00:32.620 --> 00:35.920
 dealing with drug addiction, alcohol addiction,

00:35.920 --> 00:37.620
 and behavioral addictions,

00:37.620 --> 00:40.020
 such as gambling and sex addiction,

00:40.020 --> 00:42.360
 as well as other types of addiction.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.720
 In fact, during our discussion,

00:43.720 --> 00:46.560
 I learned that there are a huge range of behaviors

00:46.560 --> 00:49.960
 and substances to which people can become addicted to,

00:49.960 --> 00:52.900
 and that there is a common biological underpinning

00:52.900 --> 00:54.740
 of all those addictions.

00:54.740 --> 00:57.340
 I also learned that there's a common path

00:57.340 --> 00:59.040
 to the treatment and recovery

00:59.040 --> 01:01.200
 from essentially all addictions.

01:01.200 --> 01:03.320
 Dr. Lemke explained that to me

01:03.320 --> 01:06.620
 and explained how to think about and conceptualize

01:06.620 --> 01:08.020
 our own addictions,

01:08.020 --> 01:10.120
 as well as the addictions of other people

01:10.120 --> 01:11.920
 who are struggling to get treatment,

01:11.920 --> 01:13.280
 move through treatment,

01:13.280 --> 01:15.320
 and stay sober from their addictions.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.680
 In addition to treating patients,

01:16.680 --> 01:18.160
 Dr. Lemke is an author

01:18.160 --> 01:21.120
 and was featured in the 2020 Netflix documentary,

01:21.120 --> 01:22.980
 ''The Social Dilemma.''

01:22.980 --> 01:25.560
 I'm excited to tell you that she has a new book coming out

01:25.560 --> 01:27.280
 called ''Dopamine Nation''

01:27.280 --> 01:29.760
 finding balance in the age of indulgence.

01:29.760 --> 01:31.840
 The book comes out August 24th

01:31.840 --> 01:35.160
 and is an absolutely fascinating read into addiction

01:35.160 --> 01:38.000
 and ways to treat various types of addiction.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.080
 I've read the book cover to cover.

01:40.080 --> 01:43.620
 And all I'll tell you is that at the very first chapter

01:43.620 --> 01:46.600
 and throughout, you're going to be absolutely blown away.

01:46.600 --> 01:51.240
 The stories about her patients are extremely engaging.

01:51.240 --> 01:54.080
 It brings forward the real struggle of addiction

01:54.080 --> 01:55.880
 and the incredible,

01:55.880 --> 01:57.880
 I think it's fair to say heroic battles

01:57.880 --> 01:58.720
 that people fight

01:58.720 --> 02:01.760
 in order to get through addictions of various kinds.

02:01.760 --> 02:04.060
 And all of that is woven through with story,

02:04.060 --> 02:04.900
 with science,

02:04.900 --> 02:07.600
 and ways that make it very accessible to anyone,

02:07.600 --> 02:09.640
 whether or not you have a science background or not.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.500
 I can't recommend it highly enough.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.720
 So again, the book is ''Dopamine Nation''

02:13.720 --> 02:15.820
 finding balance in the age of indulgence.

02:15.820 --> 02:19.240
 It comes out August 24th of this year, 2021.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.000
 And you can pre-order that book by going to Amazon.

02:22.000 --> 02:24.900
 We will provide a link to that in the show caption.

02:24.900 --> 02:26.860
 Before we begin,

02:26.860 --> 02:28.560
 I just want to mention that this podcast

02:28.560 --> 02:31.560
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.400
 It is however,

02:32.400 --> 02:34.680
 part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost

02:34.680 --> 02:36.480
 to consumer information about science

02:36.480 --> 02:39.320
 and science related tools to the general public.

02:39.320 --> 02:40.400
 In keeping with that theme,

02:40.400 --> 02:43.280
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:43.280 --> 02:45.360
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.340
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

02:47.340 --> 02:50.040
 that are of the absolute utmost quality.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.620
 Founded by two all American swimmers from Stanford,

02:52.620 --> 02:54.740
 everything about the sunglasses and eyeglasses

02:54.740 --> 02:58.680
 that Roca makes was designed with performance in mind.

02:58.680 --> 03:00.640
 First of all, they're very lightweight.

03:00.640 --> 03:02.520
 You don't even really notice that they're on your face.

03:02.520 --> 03:05.640
 Second of all, even if you get sweaty, they don't slip off.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.560
 In fact, they were designed to be worn at work

03:07.560 --> 03:08.600
 or around the house,

03:08.600 --> 03:10.440
 but also if you're running or biking.

03:10.440 --> 03:12.920
 So you can move seamlessly between different activities

03:12.920 --> 03:15.860
 without having to change your sunglasses or eyeglasses.

03:15.860 --> 03:17.880
 In addition, the lenses are designed

03:17.880 --> 03:20.480
 with the science of the visual system in mind.

03:20.480 --> 03:21.560
 I've spent my career working

03:21.560 --> 03:22.960
 on the science of the visual system.

03:22.960 --> 03:26.160
 And I can tell you that it's not trivial to build a lens

03:26.160 --> 03:28.280
 that allows you to see with perfect clarity,

03:28.280 --> 03:29.720
 whether or not you're in bright sunshine

03:29.720 --> 03:31.180
 and then move into shadows,

03:31.180 --> 03:33.300
 but the Roca glasses allow you to do that.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.560
 You always see things with absolute clarity.

03:35.560 --> 03:38.720
 Another terrific thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:38.720 --> 03:39.900
 is the aesthetic.

03:39.900 --> 03:43.080
 A lot of so-called performance sunglasses and eyeglasses,

03:43.080 --> 03:45.280
 they're not really built with the best aesthetic

03:45.280 --> 03:47.600
 and they kind of make people look like cyborgs.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.400
 With Roca, they have a lot of different styles

03:49.400 --> 03:51.620
 to choose from, but all those styles are of the sort

03:51.620 --> 03:52.860
 that you could wear out to dinner

03:52.860 --> 03:56.400
 or to work or when engaging in physical activity.

03:56.400 --> 03:57.880
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

03:57.880 --> 04:00.760
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com

04:00.760 --> 04:02.760
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.980
 And if you do that, you'll get 20% off your first order.

04:05.980 --> 04:09.320
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

04:09.320 --> 04:11.800
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:11.800 --> 04:14.420
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

04:14.420 --> 04:15.960
 to help you better understand your body

04:15.960 --> 04:17.740
 and reach your health goals.

04:17.740 --> 04:20.180
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done.

04:20.180 --> 04:21.700
 And I've been doing that for a number of years

04:21.700 --> 04:25.160
 for the simple reason that most, if not all of the factors

04:25.160 --> 04:27.680
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

04:27.680 --> 04:30.640
 can only be analyzed in detail with a quality blood test.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.040
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

04:33.040 --> 04:34.480
 you can get further insight

04:34.480 --> 04:37.360
 into what's going on beneath the hood, so to speak.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.960
 The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests, however,

04:39.960 --> 04:41.240
 is you get numbers back,

04:41.240 --> 04:42.880
 you get the levels back of various things

04:42.880 --> 04:45.120
 and you find out if certain things are too high or too low

04:45.120 --> 04:46.360
 or right on target,

04:46.360 --> 04:49.240
 but there are no directives about how to move those numbers

04:49.240 --> 04:51.400
 in the direction that you would want them to go.

04:51.400 --> 04:52.280
 With Inside Tracker,

04:52.280 --> 04:54.840
 they have a dashboard that makes all of that very easy.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.960
 And that dashboard takes your numbers

04:56.960 --> 04:58.280
 and can help direct you

04:58.280 --> 05:01.200
 towards particular lifestyle factors, nutrition factors,

05:01.200 --> 05:03.560
 exercise, supplementation, et cetera,

05:03.560 --> 05:04.920
 that can help you bring those numbers

05:04.920 --> 05:07.220
 into the ranges that are right for you.

05:07.220 --> 05:09.160
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

05:09.160 --> 05:12.200
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.020
 And if you do that,

05:13.020 --> 05:15.860
 you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

05:15.860 --> 05:18.320
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.380
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

05:21.380 --> 05:22.960
 Headspace is a meditation app

05:22.960 --> 05:26.040
 that's backed by 25 published peer review studies

05:26.040 --> 05:29.720
 and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

05:29.720 --> 05:31.680
 I've been meditating for a very long time.

05:31.680 --> 05:33.880
 I'm 45 years old now, almost 46,

05:33.880 --> 05:37.480
 and I started meditating when I was about 15 years old.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.320
 The problem, however, is keeping up a meditation practice.

05:40.320 --> 05:41.800
 I've experienced this myself.

05:41.800 --> 05:44.080
 I've had periods of time where I'm meditating regularly

05:44.080 --> 05:45.960
 and then periods of time where I just kind of

05:45.960 --> 05:49.280
 fall off the rails and I'm just not doing it at all.

05:49.280 --> 05:51.740
 There's now tons of evidence,

05:51.740 --> 05:55.160
 evidence from neuroscience, evidence from psychology,

05:55.160 --> 05:58.080
 evidence from areas of biology focused on stress

05:58.080 --> 06:00.220
 and the immune system that a meditation practice,

06:00.220 --> 06:02.800
 when done regularly, is extremely beneficial

06:02.800 --> 06:04.720
 for mental and physical health

06:04.720 --> 06:07.680
 and things like focus and creativity.

06:07.680 --> 06:09.960
 However, you have to do the meditation practice.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.680
 And so if you're not doing it regularly,

06:11.680 --> 06:12.800
 that's a serious problem.

06:12.800 --> 06:15.080
 And if you are doing it regularly, great.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.060
 With Headspace, I find that I can stick

06:17.060 --> 06:19.960
 to a meditation practice very easily.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.360
 In fact, that's why I started using it

06:21.360 --> 06:23.040
 and that's why I continue to use it.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.000
 I try and get a meditation practice in every day,

06:26.000 --> 06:27.360
 but sometimes that requires

06:27.360 --> 06:29.420
 that it be a brief meditation practice.

06:29.420 --> 06:31.060
 With Headspace, they have a huge range

06:31.060 --> 06:33.360
 of different meditations of different durations.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.360
 And so that's really helpful in building

06:35.360 --> 06:38.480
 and maintaining these powerful meditation practices.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.640
 If you want to try Headspace,

06:39.640 --> 06:42.760
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.120
 And if you do that, you'll get a free one month trial

06:45.120 --> 06:47.680
 with Headspace's full library of meditations.

06:47.680 --> 06:49.400
 This is the best deal offered by Headspace.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.320
 Basically, you get access to everything they've got

06:51.320 --> 06:53.460
 completely free for a one month trial.

06:53.460 --> 06:54.400
 So if you'd like to try that,

06:54.400 --> 06:57.720
 go to headspace.com slash special offer.

06:57.720 --> 07:01.780
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Anna Lemke.

07:01.780 --> 07:04.720
 All right, great to have you here.

07:04.720 --> 07:05.640
 Thank you for having me.

07:05.640 --> 07:07.040
 I'm excited to be here.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.600
 Yeah, I have a lot of questions for you.

07:08.600 --> 07:13.520
 I and many listeners of this podcast

07:13.520 --> 07:17.720
 are obsessed with dopamine and what is dopamine?

07:17.720 --> 07:18.560
 How does it work?

07:18.560 --> 07:20.680
 We all hear that dopamine is this molecule

07:20.680 --> 07:22.760
 associated with pleasure.

07:22.760 --> 07:25.660
 I think the term dopamine hits,

07:25.660 --> 07:27.500
 like I'm getting a dopamine hit from this,

07:27.500 --> 07:30.580
 from Instagram or from likes or from praise

07:30.580 --> 07:35.040
 or from whatever is now commonly heard.

07:35.960 --> 07:37.720
 What is dopamine?

07:37.720 --> 07:40.400
 And what are maybe some things about dopamine

07:40.400 --> 07:42.000
 that most people don't know

07:42.000 --> 07:44.820
 and probably that I don't know either?

07:44.820 --> 07:47.200
 So dopamine is a neurotransmitter

07:47.200 --> 07:49.440
 and neurotransmitters are those molecules

07:49.440 --> 07:52.740
 that bridge the gap between two neurons.

07:52.740 --> 07:55.040
 So they essentially allow one neuron,

07:55.040 --> 07:57.440
 the presynaptic neuron to communicate

07:57.440 --> 07:59.700
 with the postsynaptic neuron.

07:59.700 --> 08:03.260
 Dopamine is intimately associated

08:03.260 --> 08:06.920
 with the experience of reward, but also with movement,

08:06.920 --> 08:08.320
 which I think is really interesting

08:08.320 --> 08:10.960
 because movement and reward are linked, right?

08:10.960 --> 08:14.560
 If you think about early humans,

08:14.560 --> 08:18.680
 you had to move in order to go seek out the water

08:18.680 --> 08:21.600
 or the meat or whatever it was.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.440
 And even in the most primitive organisms,

08:24.440 --> 08:27.560
 dopamine is released when food is sensed in the environment,

08:27.560 --> 08:31.700
 for example, sea elegance, a very primitive worm.

08:31.700 --> 08:36.700
 So dopamine is this really powerful,

08:36.760 --> 08:39.880
 important molecule in the brain

08:39.880 --> 08:43.360
 that helps us experience pleasure.

08:43.360 --> 08:46.120
 It's not the only neurotransmitter involved in pleasure,

08:46.120 --> 08:48.400
 but it's a really, really important one.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.400
 And if you want to think about something

08:51.400 --> 08:53.260
 that most people don't know about dopamine,

08:53.260 --> 08:54.760
 which I think is really interesting

08:54.760 --> 08:57.920
 is that we are always releasing dopamine

08:57.920 --> 09:00.680
 at a kind of tonic baseline rate.

09:00.680 --> 09:04.240
 And it's really the deviation from that baseline

09:04.240 --> 09:06.980
 rather than like hits of dopamine in a vacuum

09:06.980 --> 09:08.200
 that make a difference.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.200
 So when we experience pleasure,

09:10.200 --> 09:13.000
 our dopamine release goes above baseline.

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
 And likewise, dopamine can go below that tonic baseline,

09:17.000 --> 09:19.920
 and then we experience a kind of pain.

09:19.920 --> 09:20.760
 Interesting.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.940
 So is it fair to say that one's baseline levels of dopamine,

09:24.940 --> 09:27.860
 how frequently we are releasing dopamine

09:27.860 --> 09:31.560
 in the absence of some, I don't know, drug or food

09:31.560 --> 09:34.580
 or experience just sitting, being,

09:35.600 --> 09:38.240
 is that associated with how happy somebody is,

09:38.240 --> 09:41.640
 their kind of baseline of happiness or level of depression?

09:41.640 --> 09:46.240
 There is evidence that shows that people who are depressed

09:46.240 --> 09:51.240
 may indeed have lower tonic levels of dopamine.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.840
 So that's a really reasonable thought.

09:53.840 --> 09:57.680
 And there's some evidence to suggest that that may be true.

09:57.680 --> 09:58.920
 The other thing that we know,

09:58.920 --> 10:03.920
 and this is really kind of what the book is about,

10:04.400 --> 10:08.720
 is that if we expose ourselves chronically

10:08.720 --> 10:11.240
 to substances or behaviors

10:11.240 --> 10:15.580
 that repeatedly release large amounts of dopamine

10:15.580 --> 10:17.120
 in our brain's reward pathway,

10:17.120 --> 10:20.160
 that we can change our tonic baseline

10:20.160 --> 10:22.480
 and actually lower it over time

10:22.480 --> 10:26.200
 as our brain tries to compensate for all of that dopamine,

10:26.200 --> 10:31.200
 which is more really than we were designed to experience.

10:31.240 --> 10:32.080
 Interesting.

10:32.080 --> 10:35.920
 And is it the case that our baseline levels of dopamine

10:35.920 --> 10:39.120
 are set by our genetics, by our heredity?

10:39.120 --> 10:41.120
 Well, I think if you think about

10:41.120 --> 10:44.440
 sort of the early stages of development in infancy,

10:44.440 --> 10:45.920
 certainly that is true.

10:45.920 --> 10:48.760
 You're kind of born with probably

10:48.760 --> 10:50.280
 whatever is your baseline level,

10:50.280 --> 10:54.600
 but obviously your experiences can have a huge impact

10:54.600 --> 10:59.600
 on where your dopamine level ultimately settles out.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.240
 So if somebody's disposition

11:02.240 --> 11:06.280
 is one of constant excitement and anticipation

11:06.280 --> 11:08.360
 or easily excited,

11:08.360 --> 11:10.240
 these are, I think, about the kind of people where you say,

11:10.240 --> 11:12.200
 hey, do you want to check out this new place for tacos?

11:12.200 --> 11:13.400
 And they're like, yeah, that'd be great.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.640
 And other people are a little more cynical,

11:16.640 --> 11:19.280
 harder to budge, like my bulldog Costello.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.200
 Very, very stable low levels of dopamine

11:23.200 --> 11:24.960
 with big inflections in his case.

11:27.360 --> 11:31.660
 Do you think that's set in terms of our parents

11:31.660 --> 11:34.960
 and obviously nature and nurture interact,

11:34.960 --> 11:39.080
 but is dopamine at the core of our temperament?

11:40.240 --> 11:42.960
 I don't really think we know the answer to that,

11:42.960 --> 11:46.800
 but I will say that people are definitely born

11:46.800 --> 11:49.120
 with different temperaments

11:49.120 --> 11:53.320
 and those temperaments do affect their ability

11:53.320 --> 11:55.680
 to experience joy.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.880
 And we've known that for a long time

11:57.880 --> 12:00.400
 and we describe that in many different ways.

12:00.400 --> 12:02.720
 One of the ways that we describe that in the modern era

12:02.720 --> 12:05.160
 is to use psychiatric nomenclature,

12:05.160 --> 12:07.940
 like this person has a dysthymic temperament,

12:07.940 --> 12:11.480
 or this person has chronic major depressive disorder.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.240
 In terms of looking specifically

12:14.240 --> 12:17.420
 at who's vulnerable to addiction,

12:17.420 --> 12:19.720
 that's an interesting sort of mixed bag,

12:19.720 --> 12:22.140
 because when you look at the research

12:22.140 --> 12:24.140
 on risk factors for addiction,

12:24.140 --> 12:26.920
 so what kind of temperament of a person

12:26.920 --> 12:29.080
 makes them more vulnerable to addiction,

12:29.080 --> 12:31.220
 you see some interesting findings.

12:31.220 --> 12:33.920
 First, you see that people who are more impulsive

12:33.920 --> 12:35.420
 are more vulnerable to addiction.

12:35.420 --> 12:37.020
 So what is impulsivity?

12:37.020 --> 12:39.900
 That means having difficulty putting space

12:39.900 --> 12:42.840
 between the thought or desire to do something

12:42.840 --> 12:44.160
 and actually doing it.

12:44.160 --> 12:47.200
 And people who have difficulty putting a space there

12:47.200 --> 12:48.840
 or who have a thought to do something

12:48.840 --> 12:51.440
 and just do it impulsively

12:51.440 --> 12:53.920
 are people who are more vulnerable to addiction.

12:53.920 --> 12:55.420
 Interesting.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.020
 In terms of impulsivity,

12:57.020 --> 12:59.280
 is this something that relates literally

12:59.280 --> 13:01.080
 to the startle reflex?

13:01.080 --> 13:03.660
 Like I've, for instance, as a lab director,

13:03.660 --> 13:05.200
 I'm familiar with walking around my lab

13:05.200 --> 13:08.240
 and when I decide, deciding I'm going to talk to my people,

13:08.240 --> 13:09.440
 of course, when they knock on my door,

13:09.440 --> 13:11.920
 it's always like, wait, why am I being bothered right now?

13:11.920 --> 13:12.980
 Even though I love to talk to them,

13:12.980 --> 13:14.840
 but I walk around my lab from time to time

13:14.840 --> 13:18.380
 and some people I notice I'll say, do you have a moment?

13:18.380 --> 13:21.560
 And they'll slowly turn around and say, yeah, or no,

13:21.560 --> 13:22.400
 in some cases.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.120
 And other people will jump the moment I say their name.

13:26.120 --> 13:30.680
 They actually have a kind of a heightened startle reflex.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.320
 Is that related to impulsivity

13:32.320 --> 13:35.100
 or is what you're referring to an attempt

13:35.100 --> 13:38.880
 to withhold behavior that's very deliberate

13:38.880 --> 13:40.480
 under very deliberate conditions?

13:40.480 --> 13:43.200
 Yeah, so I don't think that that startle reflex

13:43.200 --> 13:45.360
 is necessarily related to impulsivity.

13:45.360 --> 13:47.360
 That can be related to anxiety.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.120
 So people who are high anxiety,

13:49.120 --> 13:52.160
 people will tend to have more of a startle reflex.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.200
 Impulsivity is a little bit different.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.920
 And by the way, impulsivity is not always bad, right?

13:57.920 --> 14:02.920
 Impulsivity is that thing where there's not a lot

14:02.920 --> 14:07.800
 of self editing or worrying about future consequences.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.960
 You know, you have the idea to do something and you do it.

14:10.960 --> 14:14.000
 And of course we can imagine many scenarios

14:14.000 --> 14:16.180
 where that's absolutely wonderful.

14:17.040 --> 14:20.040
 You know, there can be a sort of, let's say,

14:20.040 --> 14:23.980
 intimate interactions between people

14:23.980 --> 14:26.440
 where you wouldn't really want to be super inhibited

14:26.440 --> 14:27.280
 about it, right?

14:27.280 --> 14:30.640
 You would want to be disinhibited and impulsive.

14:30.640 --> 14:34.480
 I can also like imagine like sort of fight or flight

14:34.480 --> 14:36.760
 scenarios, like battle scenarios, right?

14:36.760 --> 14:39.680
 Where it would really be good to be impulsive

14:39.680 --> 14:41.360
 and just go, rah, you know, just go.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.080
 Where hesitation can cost you your life.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.920
 Yes, that's right, that's right.

14:44.920 --> 14:47.920
 But you know, and I think this brings up a really,

14:48.920 --> 14:52.300
 something that I've come to believe after 25 years

14:52.300 --> 14:57.300
 of practicing psychiatry is that what we now conceptualize

14:57.520 --> 15:02.520
 in our current ecosystem as mental illness

15:02.640 --> 15:06.520
 are actually traits that in another ecosystem

15:06.520 --> 15:08.620
 might be very advantageous.

15:08.620 --> 15:11.600
 They're just not advantageous right now

15:11.600 --> 15:13.680
 because of the world that we live in.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.800
 And I think, you know, impulsivity is potentially

15:16.800 --> 15:18.220
 one of those, right?

15:18.220 --> 15:20.580
 Because we live in this world that's sort of like,

15:20.580 --> 15:25.580
 you have to constantly be thinking sort of rationally

15:26.320 --> 15:29.600
 about the consequences of X, Y, or Z.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.620
 And it's such a sensory rich environment, right?

15:32.620 --> 15:36.120
 That we're being bombarded with all of these opportunities,

15:36.120 --> 15:37.720
 these sensory opportunities.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.640
 And we have to constantly check ourselves.

15:39.640 --> 15:43.720
 And so impulsivity is something that right now

15:43.720 --> 15:45.560
 can be a difficult trait,

15:45.560 --> 15:48.560
 but isn't in and of itself a bad thing.

15:48.560 --> 15:49.380
 I see. Yeah.

15:49.380 --> 15:51.120
 Yeah, and it's, I'm beginning to realize

15:51.120 --> 15:53.840
 it's a fine line between spontaneity and impulsivity.

15:53.840 --> 15:54.680
 Yeah.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.720
 What is pleasure and how does it work

15:59.720 --> 16:03.440
 at the biological level and if it feels right

16:03.440 --> 16:05.080
 at the psychological level?

16:05.080 --> 16:09.160
 I think we, and if you don't mind painting a picture

16:09.160 --> 16:14.160
 of sort of the range of things that you have observed

16:14.600 --> 16:17.500
 in your clinic or in life that people

16:17.500 --> 16:18.480
 can become addicted to.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.440
 But just to start off really simply,

16:20.440 --> 16:23.160
 what is this thing that we call pleasure?

16:23.160 --> 16:26.960
 Well, I think it's actually really hard to define pleasure

16:26.960 --> 16:29.080
 in any kind of succinct way,

16:29.080 --> 16:31.560
 because certainly there is the seeking out

16:31.560 --> 16:36.400
 of a high or a euphoria,

16:36.400 --> 16:39.080
 or I think the kind of experience

16:39.080 --> 16:42.900
 that most anybody would associate with the word pleasure.

16:42.900 --> 16:47.600
 But also the seeking out of those same substances

16:47.600 --> 16:51.680
 and behaviors is often a way to escape pain.

16:51.680 --> 16:55.360
 So for example, when I talk to people with addiction,

16:55.360 --> 17:00.360
 sometimes their initial foray into using a drug

17:01.920 --> 17:05.520
 is to get pleasure, but very often it's a way

17:05.520 --> 17:09.280
 to escape their suffering, whatever their suffering may be.

17:09.280 --> 17:12.840
 And certainly as people become addicted,

17:12.840 --> 17:15.960
 even those who initially were seeking out pleasure

17:15.960 --> 17:20.480
 are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain of withdrawal

17:20.480 --> 17:23.680
 or the pain of the consequences of their drug use.

17:23.680 --> 17:28.680
 So I think it's very hard to actually define it

17:29.380 --> 17:30.720
 as this unitary thing.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.880
 And it's certainly not just getting a high.

17:33.880 --> 17:37.480
 There are so many ways in which people sort of want

17:37.480 --> 17:39.800
 to escape, which is not the same thing

17:39.800 --> 17:43.640
 as sort of this hedonic wanting to feel pleasure.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.540
 So someone could decide that they want to go out and dance

17:46.540 --> 17:49.000
 or get up and dance because of the pleasure of dancing.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.160
 I can imagine that.

17:50.160 --> 17:55.160
 And maybe it's very difficult for them to stay seated

17:56.160 --> 17:59.220
 when a particular song comes on, for instance.

17:59.220 --> 18:03.620
 But seeking what we would call pleasure

18:03.620 --> 18:05.400
 in order to eliminate pain,

18:05.400 --> 18:07.340
 that evokes a different picture in my mind.

18:07.340 --> 18:11.360
 That evokes a picture of somebody that feels lost

18:11.360 --> 18:13.480
 or depressed or underwhelmed.

18:14.960 --> 18:17.400
 I definitely want to get into the precise

18:17.400 --> 18:20.060
 and general description of addiction and what that is,

18:20.060 --> 18:22.040
 but in a previous conversation we had,

18:22.040 --> 18:23.640
 you said something that really rung in my mind,

18:23.640 --> 18:27.920
 which is that many people who become addicted to things,

18:27.920 --> 18:29.120
 let's call them addicts,

18:30.400 --> 18:35.280
 have this feeling that normal life isn't interesting enough,

18:35.280 --> 18:39.040
 that they are seeking a super normal experience

18:39.040 --> 18:42.300
 and that the day-to-day routine balance,

18:42.300 --> 18:44.260
 which is actually in the title of your book,

18:44.260 --> 18:46.000
 "'Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance

18:46.000 --> 18:47.280
 "'in the Age of Indulgence,'"

18:47.280 --> 18:50.400
 that the word balance itself can sometimes

18:50.400 --> 18:54.860
 be a bit of an aversive term for people.

18:54.860 --> 18:59.120
 And I'm struck by this idea,

18:59.120 --> 19:00.660
 and the reason I want to explore it is

19:00.660 --> 19:03.360
 because so much of what I see online

19:03.360 --> 19:06.760
 is about generating a lack of balance,

19:06.760 --> 19:10.700
 about being tilted forward at all times,

19:10.700 --> 19:13.840
 really leaning into life hard, experiencing life,

19:13.840 --> 19:15.660
 living a full life.

19:15.660 --> 19:18.320
 Even the commencement speech given by Steve Jobs

19:18.320 --> 19:21.760
 on this campus was really about finding passion,

19:21.760 --> 19:25.240
 digging, you know, there's so much in the narrative now.

19:25.240 --> 19:28.480
 So maybe you could just tell us a little bit

19:28.480 --> 19:31.580
 about your experience with this association,

19:31.580 --> 19:35.560
 if it really exists, between people's sense of the normalcy

19:35.560 --> 19:38.020
 or maybe even how boring life can be

19:38.020 --> 19:40.680
 and their tendency to become addicts of some sort.

19:40.680 --> 19:45.680
 Yeah, well, I mean, I think that life

19:46.520 --> 19:49.980
 for humans has always been hard,

19:49.980 --> 19:54.980
 but I think that now it's harder in unprecedented ways.

19:55.320 --> 19:59.320
 And I think that the way that life is really hard now

19:59.320 --> 20:02.120
 is that it actually is really boring.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.840
 And the reason that it's boring is

20:03.840 --> 20:07.840
 because all of our survival needs are met, right?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.620
 I mean, we don't even have to leave our homes

20:10.620 --> 20:13.040
 to meet every single physical need.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.560
 You know, as long as you're of a certain level

20:15.560 --> 20:19.760
 of financial wellbeing, which frankly, you know,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.540
 we talk so much about, you know, the income gap,

20:22.540 --> 20:24.360
 and certainly there is this enormous gap

20:24.360 --> 20:26.720
 between rich and poor, but that gap is smaller

20:26.720 --> 20:30.900
 than it's ever been in like the history of humans.

20:30.900 --> 20:35.680
 Even the poorest of the poor have more excess income

20:35.680 --> 20:36.960
 to spend on leisure goods

20:36.960 --> 20:40.140
 than they ever have before in human history.

20:40.140 --> 20:42.720
 If you look at leisure time, for example,

20:42.720 --> 20:45.720
 so people without a high school education

20:45.720 --> 20:50.720
 have 42% more leisure time than people with a college degree.

20:51.820 --> 20:56.820
 So my point here is that life is hard now

20:58.120 --> 21:00.680
 in this really weird way,

21:00.680 --> 21:04.580
 in that we don't really have anything that we have to do.

21:04.580 --> 21:08.400
 So we're all forced to make stuff up, you know,

21:08.400 --> 21:13.400
 whether it's being a scientist or being a doctor

21:13.620 --> 21:17.040
 or being an Olympic athlete or, you know,

21:17.040 --> 21:19.440
 climbing Mount Everest,

21:19.440 --> 21:23.800
 and people really vary in their need for friction.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.320
 And some people need a lot more than others.

21:26.320 --> 21:29.640
 And if they don't have it, they're really, really unhappy.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.760
 And I do think that a lot of the people that I see

21:32.760 --> 21:35.600
 with addiction and other forms of mental illness

21:35.600 --> 21:38.840
 are people who need more friction.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.920
 Like they're unhappy,

21:40.920 --> 21:43.000
 not necessarily because there's something wrong

21:43.000 --> 21:43.840
 with their brain,

21:43.840 --> 21:47.200
 but because their brain is not suited to this world.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.640
 And do you think they have that sense,

21:49.640 --> 21:51.320
 my brain isn't suited to this world,

21:51.320 --> 21:55.800
 or they simply feel a restlessness

21:55.800 --> 21:58.600
 and they're constantly seeking stimulation?

21:58.600 --> 22:00.280
 I think that's right.

22:00.280 --> 22:04.400
 Yeah, I think it's not really knowing what's wrong with me,

22:04.400 --> 22:06.600
 and why am I unhappy?

22:06.600 --> 22:08.320
 How can I be happier?

22:08.320 --> 22:09.720
 And of course, as you talk about,

22:09.720 --> 22:12.440
 what's so pervasive in our narrative now

22:12.440 --> 22:15.360
 is like find your passion, you know,

22:15.360 --> 22:18.480
 find your, you know, whatever it is to save the world.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.360
 And in a way that's good,

22:20.360 --> 22:24.360
 because it has people out in the world and seeking,

22:24.360 --> 22:27.360
 but in a way it can also be misleading

22:27.360 --> 22:31.800
 in the sense that I think people aren't entirely aware

22:31.800 --> 22:36.320
 that the world is a hard place and that life is hard

22:36.320 --> 22:40.800
 and that, you know, like we're all kind of making it up.

22:40.800 --> 22:41.720
 Do you know what I mean?

22:41.720 --> 22:44.360
 Yeah, well, there's a book by Cal Newport.

22:44.360 --> 22:45.800
 I don't know if you know Cal Newport's work,

22:45.800 --> 22:50.000
 but you guys are very symbiotic in your messages.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.720
 He's a professor of computer science at Georgetown.

22:53.620 --> 22:54.720
 Yes, at Georgetown.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.720
 And wrote a book some years ago,

22:56.720 --> 22:58.080
 really ahead of its time,

22:58.080 --> 22:59.640
 called So Good They Can't Ignore You,

22:59.640 --> 23:04.640
 which is about not meditating or doing much work

23:04.780 --> 23:08.360
 to try and figure out what one's passion is by thinking,

23:08.360 --> 23:11.080
 but rather go out and acquire skills

23:11.080 --> 23:14.220
 and develop a sense of passion for something

23:14.220 --> 23:16.260
 by your experience of hard work

23:16.260 --> 23:18.060
 and getting better and feedback.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.480
 A little bit of the growth mindset thing

23:19.480 --> 23:21.000
 of our colleague, Carol Dweck.

23:21.000 --> 23:25.040
 But he's gone on to write books, Deep Work,

23:25.040 --> 23:27.560
 which is all about removing yourself from technology

23:27.560 --> 23:29.080
 and doing deep work.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.560
 And he's been a big proponent of the evils of context

23:32.560 --> 23:35.080
 switching too often throughout the day

23:35.080 --> 23:36.600
 for sake of productivity, mostly.

23:36.600 --> 23:39.520
 His new book is called A World Without Email.

23:39.520 --> 23:41.840
 I'm beginning to realize as I cite off these books

23:41.840 --> 23:43.820
 in your book, Dopamine Nation,

23:43.820 --> 23:46.000
 Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence,

23:46.000 --> 23:48.160
 that maybe the reason why you two don't know

23:48.160 --> 23:49.880
 about one another is because neither of you

23:49.880 --> 23:50.720
 are on social media.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.560
 That's it, that's it.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.000
 Right, and yet you're two of the most productive people

23:54.000 --> 23:56.680
 that I know, including productive authors.

23:56.680 --> 23:58.140
 So that's a discussion unto itself.

23:58.140 --> 23:59.900
 But I find this fascinating.

23:59.900 --> 24:03.680
 So let's talk about the pleasure,

24:03.680 --> 24:06.040
 pain, balance, and addiction.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.960
 And I've heard you use this seesaw

24:07.960 --> 24:11.240
 or balance scale analogy before.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.440
 And I think it's a wonderful one

24:13.440 --> 24:18.440
 that really, for me, clarified what addiction is,

24:18.480 --> 24:20.600
 at least at the mechanistic level.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.200
 Yeah, so to me, one of the most significant findings

24:24.200 --> 24:26.360
 in neuroscience in the last 75 years

24:26.360 --> 24:29.400
 is that pleasure and pain are co-located,

24:29.400 --> 24:31.100
 which means the same parts of the brain

24:31.100 --> 24:34.040
 that process pleasure also process pain.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.880
 And they work like a balance.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.640
 So when we feel pleasure, our balance tips one way.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.680
 When we feel pain, it tips in the opposite direction.

24:41.680 --> 24:44.960
 And one of the overriding rules governing this balance

24:44.960 --> 24:46.520
 is that it wants to stay level.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.340
 So it doesn't want to remain tipped very long

24:48.340 --> 24:49.920
 to pleasure or to pain.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.440
 And with any deviation from neutrality,

24:52.440 --> 24:55.920
 the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance

24:55.920 --> 24:58.400
 or what scientists call homeostasis.

24:58.400 --> 25:00.260
 And the way the brain does that

25:00.260 --> 25:03.320
 is with any stimulus to one side,

25:03.320 --> 25:06.480
 there will be a tip an equal and opposite amount

25:06.480 --> 25:07.720
 to the other side.

25:07.720 --> 25:09.640
 It's like you have principle laws of physics.

25:09.640 --> 25:11.040
 Yes, right, right.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.220
 So I like to watch YouTube videos.

25:13.220 --> 25:16.300
 When I watch YouTube videos of American Idol,

25:16.300 --> 25:18.160
 it tips to the side of pleasure.

25:18.160 --> 25:22.280
 And then when I stop watching it, I have a comedown, right,

25:22.280 --> 25:25.960
 which is a tip to the equal and opposite amount

25:25.960 --> 25:26.800
 on the other side.

25:26.800 --> 25:28.520
 And that's that moment of wanting to watch

25:28.520 --> 25:30.160
 one more YouTube video, right?

25:30.160 --> 25:33.120
 Yeah, and I just want to interject there.

25:33.120 --> 25:37.700
 So this moment of wanting to watch another

25:37.700 --> 25:40.640
 that is associated with pain, I think,

25:40.640 --> 25:43.560
 is are we always aware of that happening?

25:43.560 --> 25:46.360
 Because you just described it in a very conscious way.

25:46.360 --> 25:49.800
 But when I indulge in something I enjoy,

25:49.800 --> 25:52.960
 I'm usually thinking about just wanting more of that thing.

25:52.960 --> 25:56.120
 I don't think about the pain, I just think about more.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.580
 Right, so really excellent point,

25:58.580 --> 26:00.640
 because we're mostly not aware of it.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.400
 And it's also reflexive.

26:02.400 --> 26:05.600
 So it's not something that consciously happens

26:05.600 --> 26:06.560
 or that we're aware of

26:06.560 --> 26:10.280
 unless we really begin to pay attention.

26:10.280 --> 26:12.640
 And when we begin to pay attention,

26:12.640 --> 26:15.960
 we really can become very aware of it in the moment.

26:15.960 --> 26:18.160
 Again, it's like a falling away,

26:18.160 --> 26:22.400
 like you're on social media and you get a good tweet

26:22.400 --> 26:26.080
 of something and then you can't stop yourself

26:26.080 --> 26:28.760
 because there's this awareness, a latent awareness

26:28.760 --> 26:31.420
 that as soon as I disengage from this behavior,

26:31.420 --> 26:34.420
 I'm going to experience a kind of a pain, right?

26:34.420 --> 26:37.840
 A falling away, a missing that feeling,

26:37.840 --> 26:39.800
 a wanting more of it.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.340
 And of course, one way to combat that is to do it more,

26:43.340 --> 26:45.160
 right, and more and more and more.

26:45.160 --> 26:48.880
 So I think that is really what I want people to tune into

26:48.880 --> 26:50.780
 and get an awareness around,

26:50.780 --> 26:53.720
 because once you tune into it, you can see it a lot.

26:53.720 --> 26:56.240
 And then when you begin to see it, you have,

26:56.240 --> 26:58.680
 and if you keep the model of the balance in mind,

26:58.680 --> 27:03.680
 I think it gives people kind of a way to imagine

27:04.000 --> 27:07.260
 what they're experiencing on a neurobiological level

27:07.260 --> 27:08.560
 and understand it.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.680
 And in that understanding, get some mastery over it,

27:11.680 --> 27:13.760
 which is really what this is all about.

27:13.760 --> 27:17.080
 Because ultimately we do need to disengage, right?

27:17.080 --> 27:21.160
 We can't live in that space all the time, right?

27:21.160 --> 27:23.160
 We have other things we need to do.

27:23.160 --> 27:26.240
 And there are also serious consequences that come

27:26.240 --> 27:30.280
 with trying to repeat and continue that experience

27:30.280 --> 27:31.600
 or that feeling.

27:31.600 --> 27:33.560
 Yeah, so if I understand this correctly,

27:33.560 --> 27:37.440
 when we find something or when something finds us

27:37.440 --> 27:40.960
 that we enjoy, that feels pleasureful,

27:40.960 --> 27:45.480
 social media, food, sex, gambling, whatever happens to be,

27:45.480 --> 27:48.480
 and we will explore the full range of these,

27:48.480 --> 27:50.960
 there's some dopamine release when we engage

27:50.960 --> 27:52.360
 in that behavior.

27:52.360 --> 27:55.920
 And then what you're telling me is that very quickly

27:55.920 --> 27:58.260
 and beneath my conscious awareness,

27:58.260 --> 28:01.560
 there's a tilting back of the scale

28:01.560 --> 28:05.260
 where pleasure is reduced by way of increasing pain.

28:05.260 --> 28:10.260
 And I've heard you say before that the pain mechanism

28:11.700 --> 28:16.280
 has some competitive advantages over the pleasure mechanism

28:16.280 --> 28:19.140
 such that it doesn't just bring the scale back to level.

28:19.140 --> 28:22.520
 It actually brings pain higher than pleasure.

28:23.420 --> 28:25.220
 Could you tell us a little bit more about that?

28:25.220 --> 28:28.420
 Yeah, yeah, so what happens again,

28:28.420 --> 28:31.900
 so the hallmark of any addictive substance or behavior

28:31.900 --> 28:34.140
 is that it releases a lot of dopamine

28:34.140 --> 28:35.840
 in our brain's reward pathway, right?

28:35.840 --> 28:38.600
 Like broccoli just doesn't release a lot of dopamine,

28:38.600 --> 28:40.380
 just doesn't, right?

28:40.380 --> 28:41.340
 I'm trying to imagine.

28:41.340 --> 28:44.140
 I was about to say maybe, and I stopped myself

28:44.140 --> 28:46.180
 because no, broccoli is good.

28:46.180 --> 28:49.940
 It can be really good, but broccoli is never amazing.

28:49.940 --> 28:51.660
 Right, broccoli is never amazing.

28:51.660 --> 28:52.500
 This is the most amazing broccoli.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.980
 Honestly, we can probably find somebody on the planet

28:54.980 --> 28:56.060
 for whom broccoli is amazing.

28:56.060 --> 28:59.180
 And of course, if I'm starving, broccoli is amazing.

28:59.180 --> 29:01.220
 Rich Roll, Rich Roll is big on plants

29:01.220 --> 29:04.980
 and he has a good relationship to plants, Rich,

29:04.980 --> 29:07.540
 tell us how to make broccoli amazing.

29:07.540 --> 29:08.940
 If anyone could do it, it'd be rich.

29:08.940 --> 29:09.780
 Yeah, yeah.

29:10.700 --> 29:13.060
 But what happens right after I do something

29:13.060 --> 29:15.540
 that is really pleasurable and releases a lot of dopamine

29:15.540 --> 29:18.440
 is again, my brain is going to immediately compensate

29:18.440 --> 29:21.060
 by down-regulating my own dopamine receptors,

29:21.060 --> 29:24.820
 my own dopamine transmission to compensate for that, okay?

29:24.820 --> 29:27.940
 And that's that come down or the hangover,

29:27.940 --> 29:30.500
 that after effect, that moment of wanting to do it more.

29:30.500 --> 29:34.160
 Now, if I just wait for that feeling to pass,

29:34.160 --> 29:36.100
 then my dopamine will re-regulate itself

29:36.100 --> 29:38.060
 and I'll go back to whatever my chronic baseline is.

29:38.060 --> 29:40.260
 But if I don't wait, and here's really the key,

29:40.260 --> 29:43.180
 if I keep indulging again and again and again,

29:43.180 --> 29:48.180
 ultimately, I have so much on the pain side, right,

29:48.280 --> 29:50.780
 that I've essentially reset my brain

29:50.780 --> 29:53.180
 to what we call like an anhedonic

29:53.180 --> 29:56.000
 or lacking in joy type of state,

29:56.000 --> 29:58.380
 which is a dopamine deficit state.

29:58.380 --> 30:01.820
 So that's really the way in which pain

30:01.820 --> 30:05.380
 can become the main driver is because I've indulged so much

30:05.380 --> 30:08.500
 in these high reward behaviors or substances

30:08.500 --> 30:10.720
 that my brain has had to compensate

30:10.720 --> 30:13.240
 by way down-regulating my own dopamine,

30:13.240 --> 30:16.420
 such that even when I'm not doing that drug,

30:16.420 --> 30:18.020
 I'm in a dopamine deficit state,

30:18.020 --> 30:20.020
 which is akin to a clinical depression.

30:20.020 --> 30:22.700
 I have anxiety, irritability, insomnia, dysphoria,

30:22.700 --> 30:25.460
 and a lot of mental preoccupation with using again

30:25.460 --> 30:26.620
 or getting the drug.

30:26.620 --> 30:28.300
 And so that's the piece there.

30:28.300 --> 30:32.840
 There's the single use, which easily passes,

30:32.840 --> 30:36.780
 but it's the chronic use that can then reset

30:36.780 --> 30:38.740
 really our dopamine thresholds.

30:38.740 --> 30:41.700
 And then nothing is enjoyable, right?

30:41.700 --> 30:44.220
 Then everything sort of pales in comparison

30:44.220 --> 30:47.020
 to this one drug that I want to keep doing.

30:47.020 --> 30:50.080
 And that one drug could be a person, right?

30:50.080 --> 30:52.100
 I mean, I know people in my life

30:52.100 --> 30:56.100
 that are still talking about this one relationship,

30:56.100 --> 30:58.960
 this one person that was just so great

30:58.960 --> 31:01.420
 despite all the challenges of that thing,

31:01.420 --> 31:04.260
 that it's almost like they're addicted to the narrative.

31:04.260 --> 31:07.860
 They were maybe or still are addicted to the person.

31:07.860 --> 31:09.500
 So it could be to any number of things,

31:09.500 --> 31:12.420
 video games, sex, gambling, a person, a narrative.

31:13.500 --> 31:17.340
 To me, and because of the way you describe this mechanism,

31:17.340 --> 31:18.860
 this pleasure-pain balance,

31:20.640 --> 31:24.240
 that all speaks to the kind of generalizability

31:24.240 --> 31:26.660
 of our brain circuitry.

31:26.660 --> 31:28.860
 And this is something that fascinates me,

31:28.860 --> 31:30.380
 and I know it fascinates you as well,

31:30.380 --> 31:34.420
 which is that nature did not evolve

31:34.420 --> 31:38.240
 20 different mechanisms for 20 different types of addiction.

31:38.240 --> 31:41.740
 Just like anxiety is a couple of core sets of hormones

31:41.740 --> 31:43.220
 and neurotransmitters and pathways,

31:43.220 --> 31:46.780
 and one person is triggered by social interactions,

31:46.780 --> 31:50.260
 another person is triggered by spiders,

31:50.260 --> 31:52.860
 but the underlying response is identical.

31:52.860 --> 31:54.700
 It sounds like with addiction as well,

31:54.700 --> 31:56.520
 there may be some nuance,

31:56.520 --> 31:59.140
 but that they're sort of a core set of processes.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.320
 So it doesn't really matter

32:01.320 --> 32:03.380
 if it's gambling or video games or sex

32:03.380 --> 32:07.340
 or a narrative about a previous lover or partner or whatever.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.100
 It's the same addictive process underneath that.

32:11.100 --> 32:11.940
 Is that correct?

32:11.940 --> 32:13.260
 Yes, exactly.

32:13.260 --> 32:16.300
 And that's where this whole idea of cross addiction comes in.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.860
 So once you've been addicted to a substance,

32:18.860 --> 32:21.220
 severely addicted, that makes you more vulnerable

32:21.220 --> 32:23.520
 to addiction to any substance.

32:23.520 --> 32:24.740
 And when you say substance,

32:24.740 --> 32:27.020
 does the same, is what you just said

32:27.020 --> 32:28.020
 also true for behaviors?

32:28.020 --> 32:30.260
 Yes, so when I use the word drug,

32:30.260 --> 32:32.880
 I'm talking about substances and behaviors, really,

32:32.880 --> 32:36.160
 and I'm talking about behaviors like gambling, sex,

32:37.500 --> 32:41.060
 gaming, porn, absolutely, shopping, work.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.100
 You've accused me, just for the record,

32:44.500 --> 32:47.020
 Anna, Dr. Lemke has accused me, not accused me,

32:47.020 --> 32:50.240
 has diagnosed me outside the clinic

32:50.240 --> 32:51.940
 in a playful way of being work addicted.

32:51.940 --> 32:53.260
 You're probably right.

32:53.260 --> 32:54.860
 The first thoughts I have when I wake up

32:54.860 --> 32:56.140
 are typically about work,

32:56.140 --> 32:59.220
 certainly within 50 milliseconds or so of waking.

32:59.220 --> 33:01.180
 And probably the last thoughts I have,

33:01.180 --> 33:02.580
 I would hope, are not about work,

33:02.580 --> 33:04.260
 but yeah, I work constantly.

33:04.260 --> 33:06.080
 I don't, I do other things,

33:06.080 --> 33:08.420
 but I have to actively turn that off.

33:08.420 --> 33:10.160
 Yes, that's exactly right.

33:10.160 --> 33:12.520
 And you're certainly not alone in that.

33:12.520 --> 33:13.360
 And of course-

33:13.360 --> 33:14.180
 At Stanford, no, no, no, no.

33:14.180 --> 33:15.660
 Right, I mean, here in Silicon Valley,

33:15.660 --> 33:16.900
 it's highly rewarded, right?

33:16.900 --> 33:17.740
 So that kind of addiction-

33:17.740 --> 33:18.820
 It's embedded in the culture.

33:18.820 --> 33:20.860
 Oh, yeah, absolutely, yeah.

33:20.860 --> 33:23.460
 And there's this other city, I think it's called New York,

33:23.460 --> 33:25.340
 where they also work a lot out here,

33:25.340 --> 33:26.840
 and it's heavily rewarded.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.960
 I once said, and I'm sure

33:30.960 --> 33:32.620
 that I'm not the first person to say it,

33:32.620 --> 33:34.780
 but I was thinking about addiction,

33:34.780 --> 33:36.500
 and I was thinking about the underlying circuits,

33:36.500 --> 33:40.780
 and I posted something to social media,

33:40.780 --> 33:43.340
 which said that addiction is a progressive narrowing

33:43.340 --> 33:45.260
 of the things that bring you pleasure.

33:45.260 --> 33:47.080
 That was the way that I kind of crystallized

33:47.080 --> 33:48.000
 the literature in my mind.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.220
 And then we met, and you of course came

33:50.220 --> 33:53.820
 and gave these amazing lectures in the neuroanatomy course

33:53.820 --> 33:56.560
 for the medical students, and the rest is history.

33:56.560 --> 34:01.560
 But I tossed out a kind of mirroring statement

34:03.680 --> 34:07.540
 for that as well, which was a bit overstepping, I admit,

34:07.540 --> 34:10.060
 which I said, addiction is a progressive narrowing

34:10.060 --> 34:12.280
 of the things that bring you pleasure.

34:12.280 --> 34:15.940
 And I said, dare I say, enlightenment is a progressive

34:15.940 --> 34:17.940
 expansion of the things that bring you pleasure.

34:17.940 --> 34:20.140
 Not that anybody knows what enlightenment is,

34:20.140 --> 34:22.380
 but it was my attempt to take a little bit of a jab

34:22.380 --> 34:23.700
 at the fact that nobody knows,

34:23.700 --> 34:26.680
 and so why wouldn't I throw a neurobiological explanation,

34:26.680 --> 34:28.800
 just to kind of sample the waters?

34:29.980 --> 34:32.580
 And people had varying levels of response.

34:32.580 --> 34:37.260
 But the reason I bring that up is that I would imagine

34:37.260 --> 34:41.020
 that being able to derive pleasure from many things

34:41.020 --> 34:43.660
 would be a wonderful attribute.

34:43.660 --> 34:48.260
 Well, you know people like this that can experience pleasure

34:48.260 --> 34:51.180
 in little things and in big events,

34:51.180 --> 34:56.180
 not just the big milestones of life, but also the subtle,

34:56.740 --> 35:00.560
 as the yogis would say, the subtle ripples of life.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.380
 If such an ability exists, do you think that that reflects

35:06.380 --> 35:09.680
 a healthily tuned dopamine system,

35:09.680 --> 35:13.000
 one that can engage and enjoy, but then disengage?

35:13.000 --> 35:14.860
 Is that what we should be seeking?

35:14.860 --> 35:18.180
 And to underscore, I know nothing about enlightenment

35:18.180 --> 35:20.180
 meditation or any of it.

35:20.180 --> 35:23.120
 I just use these as opportunities to explore.

35:24.020 --> 35:26.480
 Yeah, so it's a great question.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.860
 And I understand the question as,

35:29.860 --> 35:32.260
 so what should we be striving for, right?

35:32.260 --> 35:34.720
 Where should we settle out?

35:34.720 --> 35:39.720
 And in my book, I really hold out people in recovery

35:39.720 --> 35:44.220
 from severe addiction as sort of modern day profits

35:44.220 --> 35:45.200
 for the rest of us.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.440
 Because I do think that people who have been addicted

35:48.440 --> 35:53.440
 and then get into recovery do have a hard-won wisdom

35:53.920 --> 35:56.600
 that we can all benefit from.

35:56.600 --> 36:01.600
 And the wisdom, I guess, to distill it down,

36:01.800 --> 36:03.940
 I mean, it's many things.

36:03.940 --> 36:08.940
 But in terms of dopamine, the wisdom is there are adaptive

36:10.960 --> 36:13.020
 ways to get your dopamine,

36:13.020 --> 36:16.880
 and there are less than adaptive ways.

36:16.880 --> 36:21.240
 And in general, you could describe the adaptive ways

36:21.240 --> 36:26.240
 as not too potent, so not tipping that balance too hard

36:26.640 --> 36:28.740
 or too fast to the side of pleasure.

36:28.740 --> 36:31.320
 So does that mean never allowing myself

36:31.320 --> 36:34.540
 to be absolutely in complete bliss?

36:34.540 --> 36:36.200
 Or does it mean not allowing myself

36:36.200 --> 36:38.200
 to stay in that state too long?

36:38.200 --> 36:40.240
 The latter, I think the latter.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.440
 So, and then that gets to temperament.

36:42.440 --> 36:44.360
 So I'm going to get that to a second.

36:44.360 --> 36:49.040
 So in general, what we want is some kind of flexibility

36:49.040 --> 36:50.740
 in that balance and the ability

36:50.740 --> 36:53.220
 to easily reassert homeostasis.

36:53.220 --> 36:55.040
 We don't want to break our balance,

36:55.040 --> 36:57.320
 which is possible if we overindulge

36:57.320 --> 37:00.480
 for enough period of time and end up with a balance tip

37:00.480 --> 37:02.640
 to the side of pain, this dopamine deficit state

37:02.640 --> 37:03.880
 we've been talking about.

37:03.880 --> 37:07.620
 We want a flexible, resilient balance, right?

37:07.620 --> 37:10.360
 Which can be sensitive to things going on in the environment

37:10.360 --> 37:13.400
 which can experience pleasure and approach,

37:13.400 --> 37:16.320
 which can experience pain and recoil, right?

37:16.320 --> 37:19.800
 This is all adaptive and healthy and necessary and good.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.760
 We would never want a balance that doesn't tilt.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.320
 That would be a disaster, but we wouldn't be human.

37:25.320 --> 37:28.040
 And we wouldn't want that, it'd be really, really boring.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.980
 On the other hand, what people in recovery

37:29.980 --> 37:33.200
 from addiction talk about is, to some extent,

37:33.200 --> 37:36.400
 having to learn to live with things

37:36.400 --> 37:39.440
 being a little boring a lot of the time, right?

37:39.440 --> 37:42.480
 So trying to avoid some of this intensity

37:42.480 --> 37:46.280
 and thrill-seeking and escapism

37:46.280 --> 37:49.200
 that really is at the core of addictive tendencies.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.720
 Sorry to interrupt, but when you say boring,

37:51.720 --> 37:53.840
 can we add stressful and boring?

37:53.840 --> 37:54.680
 Yes.

37:54.680 --> 37:57.380
 Because there are days where I'm not,

37:57.380 --> 38:00.140
 I'm one of these people I have to remind myself to have fun

38:00.140 --> 38:02.440
 because I sort of forgot what the term means

38:02.440 --> 38:04.780
 because I like to think that I experience

38:04.780 --> 38:06.040
 a lot of pleasure in little things,

38:06.040 --> 38:08.120
 but I'm a pretty hard driving guy.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.480
 I like goals and big milestones, all that stuff.

38:10.480 --> 38:15.040
 Anyway, the point being that many days,

38:15.040 --> 38:18.380
 I'm not bored thinking, oh, there's nothing to do,

38:18.380 --> 38:21.440
 but I am kind of overwhelmed by the number of things

38:21.440 --> 38:25.380
 that are really not pleasureful that I have to do.

38:25.380 --> 38:26.600
 I won't mention what they are

38:26.600 --> 38:29.360
 because I don't want my colleagues to be like,

38:29.360 --> 38:32.700
 so that's why you don't respond to emails.

38:32.700 --> 38:33.820
 No, just your emails.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.880
 Not yours, Anna, but theirs.

38:36.880 --> 38:40.360
 In any event, so anxiety and boredom

38:40.360 --> 38:42.360
 can hang out together, right?

38:42.360 --> 38:43.680
 Am I correct in-

38:43.680 --> 38:44.500
 Oh, for sure.

38:44.500 --> 38:47.560
 I mean, actually boredom is highly anxiety-provoking.

38:47.560 --> 38:48.800
 Okay, that's good to know

38:48.800 --> 38:50.040
 because I think people hear boredom

38:50.040 --> 38:53.040
 and they think like, oh, there's nothing to do here.

38:54.440 --> 38:55.820
 I feel like we have a ton to do.

38:55.820 --> 38:57.960
 We just don't really want to do it

38:57.960 --> 38:59.980
 as opposed to something that we're excited to do.

38:59.980 --> 39:02.400
 Right, okay, so this gets to sort of

39:02.400 --> 39:05.240
 some of the core things also we were talking about earlier

39:05.240 --> 39:06.560
 about finding your passion.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.120
 So I'm going to try to link it all together.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.100
 But basically, is boredom,

39:11.100 --> 39:14.780
 first of all, boredom is a rare experience for modern humans

39:14.780 --> 39:17.480
 because we're constantly distracting ourselves

39:17.480 --> 39:18.480
 from the present moment

39:18.480 --> 39:22.740
 and we have an infinite number of ways to do that, right?

39:22.740 --> 39:24.760
 But boredom is really, I think,

39:24.760 --> 39:28.260
 an important and necessary experience.

39:28.260 --> 39:29.200
 But it is scary

39:29.200 --> 39:32.480
 because when you allow yourself to be bored,

39:32.480 --> 39:34.800
 let's say you had that list of all the things you hate to do

39:34.800 --> 39:36.600
 and you actually got them all done.

39:36.600 --> 39:40.360
 Imagine that, and you got your forthcoming book done,

39:40.360 --> 39:42.840
 and you did all your interviews, and then-

39:42.840 --> 39:43.880
 It could happen.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.160
 Lightning could spread. Right.

39:45.160 --> 39:47.740
 And you walked your dog and you cleaned your house

39:47.740 --> 39:49.700
 and you went shopping.

39:49.700 --> 39:51.060
 Imagine that for a moment.

39:51.060 --> 39:53.240
 You would be sitting in your house

39:53.240 --> 39:56.640
 and my guess is you would be terrified

39:56.640 --> 40:01.060
 because, wow, what am I supposed to do now? Right?

40:01.060 --> 40:03.160
 There's nothing I really have to do.

40:03.160 --> 40:05.160
 And that is really, really scary.

40:05.160 --> 40:06.760
 That can feel like free fall.

40:06.760 --> 40:09.480
 And yet that's really an important

40:09.480 --> 40:11.100
 and good experience to have.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.640
 And I think that is an experience

40:12.640 --> 40:17.640
 out of which we can have a lot of creative initiative,

40:18.000 --> 40:20.760
 but also really consider our priorities and values.

40:20.760 --> 40:23.640
 Okay, here I am on planet earth.

40:23.640 --> 40:26.020
 What the hee-haw am I going to do with my life?

40:26.020 --> 40:27.100
 What do I really care about?

40:27.100 --> 40:29.040
 How do I really want to spend my time

40:29.040 --> 40:33.240
 when I'm not distracting myself in order to spend it?

40:33.240 --> 40:36.480
 And then this gets back to our conversation

40:36.480 --> 40:38.720
 a little bit earlier about finding your passion.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.760
 So I think that one of the big problems now

40:41.760 --> 40:43.480
 that's very misguided about this idea

40:43.480 --> 40:45.180
 of finding your passion,

40:45.180 --> 40:48.000
 it's almost as if people are looking to fit the key

40:48.000 --> 40:51.360
 into the lock of the thing that was meant for them to do.

40:51.360 --> 40:52.420
 Right, and then everything will feel

40:52.420 --> 40:53.260
 like a natural progression.

40:53.260 --> 40:55.160
 Right, and then everything will be wonderful.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.520
 I can attest to the fact that is not how it works

40:57.520 --> 40:58.680
 in any endeavor.

40:58.680 --> 41:01.640
 Right, and that you'll have all this great success.

41:01.640 --> 41:06.280
 And here's where I really think the answer lies,

41:06.280 --> 41:07.840
 and I really, really believe this.

41:07.840 --> 41:11.080
 Stop looking for your passion,

41:11.080 --> 41:15.480
 and instead look around right where you are.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.040
 Stop distracting yourself.

41:18.040 --> 41:20.340
 Look around right where you are,

41:20.340 --> 41:23.380
 and see what needs to be done.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.840
 So not what do I want to do,

41:25.840 --> 41:28.820
 but what is the work that needs to be done?

41:28.820 --> 41:29.640
 And more importantly,

41:29.640 --> 41:32.260
 it doesn't have to be some grandiose work.

41:32.260 --> 41:35.780
 Like, does the garbage need to be taken out, right?

41:35.780 --> 41:38.580
 Is there some garbage on your neighbor's lawn

41:38.580 --> 41:39.420
 that someone threw there

41:39.420 --> 41:41.740
 that you could actually bend over and pick up

41:41.740 --> 41:44.620
 and put into the garbage can?

41:44.620 --> 41:46.500
 Look around you.

41:46.500 --> 41:49.580
 There is so much work that needs to be done

41:49.580 --> 41:53.460
 that nobody wants to do that is really, really important.

41:53.460 --> 41:55.620
 And if we all did that,

41:55.620 --> 41:58.140
 I really think the world would be a much better place.

41:58.140 --> 42:00.900
 And this is what people who have severe addiction

42:00.900 --> 42:02.580
 who get into recovery realize.

42:02.580 --> 42:06.460
 They're like, it's not about me and my will

42:06.460 --> 42:09.900
 and what I'm going to will in my life or in the world.

42:09.900 --> 42:13.220
 It's about looking around what needs to be done.

42:13.220 --> 42:17.900
 What is the work that I am called to do in this moment?

42:17.900 --> 42:19.980
 Which also is incredibly freeing

42:19.980 --> 42:22.700
 because I don't have to search for the perfect thing.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.980
 There's a lot of burden now on young people

42:24.980 --> 42:26.780
 that they have to find that perfect thing.

42:26.780 --> 42:28.220
 And until they've found that perfect thing,

42:28.220 --> 42:29.540
 they're going to be miserable.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.160
 You don't have to do that.

42:31.160 --> 42:32.800
 Look at the life you were given.

42:32.800 --> 42:34.580
 Look at the people around you.

42:34.580 --> 42:37.860
 Look at the jobs that present themselves to you

42:37.860 --> 42:42.860
 and do that job simply and honorably one day at a time.

42:42.860 --> 42:44.620
 With a kind of humility.

42:44.620 --> 42:47.140
 I think this is really what's so striking to me

42:47.140 --> 42:49.380
 about the wisdom of people in recovery.

42:49.380 --> 42:51.620
 There's this incredible humility

42:51.620 --> 42:53.300
 that comes out of that experience.

42:53.300 --> 42:55.940
 You feel so broken, so ashamed,

42:55.940 --> 42:58.940
 but you pick yourself up one day at a time

42:58.940 --> 43:03.500
 and you build a life that's around what can I do

43:03.500 --> 43:06.760
 right in this moment that might benefit another person

43:06.760 --> 43:09.340
 and thereby benefit me.

43:09.340 --> 43:14.340
 And it's a really important point and if you're willing,

43:14.380 --> 43:17.900
 I'd like to actually stay on this issue of passion

43:17.900 --> 43:22.900
 because I think the dopamine systems,

43:23.300 --> 43:24.900
 if I understand them correctly,

43:25.860 --> 43:29.540
 the dopamine systems merge with this work

43:29.540 --> 43:30.360
 that you're referring to,

43:30.360 --> 43:32.500
 this immediacy of things calling to us

43:32.500 --> 43:33.780
 like taking out the trash,

43:33.780 --> 43:37.500
 which sounds frankly really boring to be honest.

43:37.500 --> 43:40.180
 I hate taking out the trash, but I do it

43:40.180 --> 43:41.260
 because I like a clean home

43:41.260 --> 43:43.180
 and I like a home that smells good

43:44.260 --> 43:46.580
 or at least doesn't smell bad.

43:46.580 --> 43:50.180
 So we do these things and not that we want to offer

43:50.180 --> 43:54.260
 some larger carrot as a consequence of doing those things,

43:54.260 --> 43:56.660
 but if I understand correctly, what you're saying is

43:56.660 --> 44:01.340
 in the act of looking at one's immediate environment,

44:01.340 --> 44:03.820
 acting on that immediate environment,

44:03.820 --> 44:08.820
 we cultivate a relationship to these circuits in our brain

44:09.580 --> 44:13.040
 about action and reward that at least to my mind,

44:13.040 --> 44:16.620
 span the range of small things being rewarding

44:16.620 --> 44:19.020
 and then lead us to bigger things being rewarding.

44:19.020 --> 44:21.260
 It's not like all we're going to do is take out trash

44:21.260 --> 44:22.280
 and tend to house.

44:22.280 --> 44:23.640
 We eventually will venture out

44:23.640 --> 44:27.460
 and we eventually will find careers and work on those.

44:27.460 --> 44:28.420
 But if I understand correctly,

44:28.420 --> 44:31.620
 you're talking about getting into a sort of functional

44:31.620 --> 44:34.060
 or adaptive action step.

44:34.060 --> 44:37.180
 And it's the action step that these days we tend to overlook

44:37.180 --> 44:39.860
 because most of our mindset is in things

44:39.860 --> 44:43.140
 that are truly outside of our immediate reality.

44:43.140 --> 44:44.200
 Do I have that correct?

44:44.200 --> 44:45.660
 Yeah, that was beautifully said.

44:45.660 --> 44:47.460
 And I would just add to that.

44:47.460 --> 44:50.800
 I see a lot of young people who, for example,

44:50.800 --> 44:53.660
 spend most of their waking hours playing video games

44:53.660 --> 44:54.860
 and they come to me and they say,

44:54.860 --> 44:56.940
 I'm anxious and depressed.

44:56.940 --> 44:58.780
 I'm majoring in computer science.

44:58.780 --> 44:59.620
 I hate it.

44:59.620 --> 45:01.300
 I thought I would like it.

45:01.300 --> 45:03.020
 If I could only find that thing

45:03.020 --> 45:06.380
 that I was really meant to do, my life would be better.

45:06.380 --> 45:10.580
 And my first intervention for the many, many people like that

45:10.580 --> 45:14.260
 that I see in clinical care is you have it backwards.

45:14.260 --> 45:16.000
 I don't say it quite like that.

45:16.000 --> 45:18.780
 You were waiting for that thing to pull you out

45:18.780 --> 45:22.180
 of the video game world and you're never going to find it

45:22.180 --> 45:24.020
 as long as you're playing video games.

45:24.020 --> 45:27.520
 Because video games are so powerfully dopaminergic

45:27.520 --> 45:31.380
 that you have this distorted sense of really pleasure

45:31.380 --> 45:34.380
 and pain, and you will not be able to find that thing

45:34.380 --> 45:35.260
 that you enjoy.

45:35.260 --> 45:37.300
 And so of course the intervention is abstain

45:37.300 --> 45:40.140
 from video games, reset your reward pathways,

45:40.140 --> 45:42.180
 start with a level balance.

45:42.180 --> 45:44.380
 And what invariably happens, and I've just seen it

45:44.380 --> 45:45.860
 over 20 years, so many times,

45:45.860 --> 45:49.140
 I've become really a believer in this.

45:50.180 --> 45:52.000
 All of a sudden it's like, oh wow,

45:52.000 --> 45:56.020
 my computer science class is interesting this quarter.

45:56.020 --> 46:00.740
 It's like, okay, you have a receptivity then

46:00.740 --> 46:03.820
 to experiencing pleasure and reward in a way

46:03.820 --> 46:05.800
 you just don't have when you're bombarding

46:05.800 --> 46:08.700
 your reward pathways with these high dopamine drugs.

46:08.700 --> 46:09.860
 Very interesting.

46:09.860 --> 46:13.140
 And just to underscore this notion that tending

46:13.140 --> 46:16.520
 to the immediate things can lead to super performance.

46:17.700 --> 46:20.220
 I may have mentioned it earlier this episode,

46:20.220 --> 46:22.260
 but if I didn't, I'll mention it now,

46:22.260 --> 46:24.500
 which is I have the great privilege of having

46:24.500 --> 46:26.180
 some close friends that were in the SEAL teams

46:26.180 --> 46:27.580
 and doing some work with those communities.

46:27.580 --> 46:30.220
 And it's a remarkable community for reasons

46:30.220 --> 46:31.780
 that I think most people don't understand.

46:31.780 --> 46:33.920
 People think they see the images carrying logs

46:33.920 --> 46:35.620
 down the beach and all the blowing stuff out,

46:35.620 --> 46:38.220
 all the stuff that's fun for guys like that.

46:38.220 --> 46:42.260
 But all of the guys I know who are in the SEAL teams

46:42.260 --> 46:46.140
 have this sense of duty about immediate things

46:46.140 --> 46:48.700
 and not just holding the door and helping with the dishes

46:48.700 --> 46:49.700
 and moving things around.

46:49.700 --> 46:52.180
 They are constantly scanning their environment

46:52.180 --> 46:53.900
 for what can be done.

46:53.900 --> 46:56.980
 They essentially conquer every environment they're in.

46:56.980 --> 47:00.780
 They are also some of the most competitive human beings

47:00.780 --> 47:01.620
 in the world.

47:01.620 --> 47:04.660
 And they do it unless they're in the act of war fighting,

47:04.660 --> 47:06.400
 which is their real job.

47:07.360 --> 47:10.420
 They do it in every environment in a very benevolent way.

47:10.420 --> 47:14.080
 And it's a remarkable thing because I think it's what

47:14.080 --> 47:16.340
 is part of what they're selected for.

47:16.340 --> 47:18.700
 And there's a range there.

47:18.700 --> 47:20.820
 But I think when we hear about tending

47:20.820 --> 47:24.060
 to the immediate things or this phrase,

47:24.060 --> 47:25.700
 how you do one thing is how you do anything.

47:25.700 --> 47:28.020
 That's a tricky one for me because there are certain things

47:28.020 --> 47:29.060
 I just don't do well.

47:30.420 --> 47:32.020
 But should we always be trying?

47:32.020 --> 47:36.220
 I think that the tending to setting the horizon in closely

47:37.580 --> 47:39.660
 and tending to things in one's immediate environment,

47:39.660 --> 47:42.060
 I think it is very powerful and translates.

47:42.060 --> 47:44.300
 Because again, I think the nervous system,

47:44.300 --> 47:46.820
 it performs algorithms, it has action steps.

47:46.820 --> 47:49.920
 The brain doesn't evolve to do one thing.

47:49.920 --> 47:52.660
 It evolves to be able to use the same approach

47:52.660 --> 47:55.160
 to doing lots of different things.

47:55.160 --> 47:56.860
 I just want to add, so even beyond that,

47:56.860 --> 47:58.980
 because that totally resonates for me

47:58.980 --> 48:01.620
 and is very consistent with people in recovery

48:01.620 --> 48:04.900
 from addiction who learn to take it one day at a time,

48:04.900 --> 48:07.740
 which is one of the standard lingo

48:07.740 --> 48:10.340
 from Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12 step groups.

48:10.340 --> 48:12.560
 But I think also, as you say,

48:12.560 --> 48:16.460
 our brain is really wired for the 24 hour period.

48:16.460 --> 48:20.940
 We're not very good at sort of the 10 year, 20.

48:20.940 --> 48:22.500
 I mean, we have these huge frontal lobes

48:22.500 --> 48:24.500
 and yes, we're great planners and we can.

48:24.500 --> 48:27.680
 But if we live too much in that space,

48:27.680 --> 48:30.540
 we can really get very anxious and depressed and lost

48:30.540 --> 48:33.220
 and either catastrophize or get grandiose.

48:33.220 --> 48:36.320
 But if you can chunk it down to a day,

48:36.320 --> 48:38.260
 what people in recovery talk about

48:38.260 --> 48:41.380
 is how if I can just do today right,

48:41.380 --> 48:44.420
 then I will get a chain of days

48:44.420 --> 48:48.960
 that seem insignificant in their individual units.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.180
 But after six months or a year

48:51.180 --> 48:53.300
 or two years of those good days,

48:53.300 --> 48:55.900
 I've got two very good years, right?

48:55.900 --> 48:57.580
 And I look back and it's like, oh wow,

48:57.580 --> 48:59.620
 well, I guess I did all that.

48:59.620 --> 49:01.780
 But I think that's really one of the keys

49:01.780 --> 49:03.420
 is really taking it one day at a time,

49:03.420 --> 49:06.180
 which your seals and also this connecting

49:06.180 --> 49:07.420
 with the environment, right?

49:07.420 --> 49:10.420
 So being awake and alert to your environment

49:10.420 --> 49:12.220
 and connecting with your environment,

49:12.220 --> 49:13.740
 not trying to escape it.

49:13.740 --> 49:16.620
 And of course, escapism is what we all want and desire,

49:16.620 --> 49:18.420
 that experience of non-being.

49:18.420 --> 49:20.900
 And we get it from the internet or from drugs

49:20.900 --> 49:23.940
 or whatever it is, but it's the booby prize

49:23.940 --> 49:27.500
 because ultimately it takes you further and further away

49:27.500 --> 49:28.560
 from your immediate environment,

49:28.560 --> 49:30.780
 which is where we really have to connect

49:30.780 --> 49:33.500
 to get that sense of groundedness and authenticity

49:33.500 --> 49:36.580
 and like of being in our own lives.

49:36.580 --> 49:37.940
 Well, I think the unit of the day

49:37.940 --> 49:40.100
 is something that comes up again and again

49:40.100 --> 49:42.640
 of in my discussions with colleagues

49:42.640 --> 49:45.220
 who are extremely successful

49:45.220 --> 49:47.640
 and who also have balanced lives.

49:47.640 --> 49:49.240
 This actually came up in the discussion

49:49.240 --> 49:53.860
 with Karl Deisseroth, who is also a successful scientist

49:53.860 --> 49:56.920
 and clinician and manages a family, et cetera.

49:56.920 --> 49:59.820
 So the unit of the day I think is fundamental

49:59.820 --> 50:02.300
 and those stack up as you mentioned.

50:02.300 --> 50:05.220
 So along those lines, I've heard you say

50:05.220 --> 50:08.500
 that in order to reset the dopamine system,

50:08.500 --> 50:12.260
 essentially in order to break an addictive pattern,

50:12.260 --> 50:17.260
 to become unaddicted, 30 days of zero interaction

50:18.620 --> 50:21.660
 with that substance, that person, et cetera.

50:21.660 --> 50:22.700
 Is that correct?

50:22.700 --> 50:25.860
 Yeah, and 30 days is in my clinical experience,

50:25.860 --> 50:27.700
 the average amount of time it takes

50:27.700 --> 50:29.840
 for the brain to reset reward pathways

50:29.840 --> 50:32.780
 for dopamine transmission to regenerate itself.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.740
 There's also a little bit of science

50:34.740 --> 50:36.780
 that suggests that that's true.

50:36.780 --> 50:39.660
 Some imaging studies showing that our brains

50:39.660 --> 50:43.020
 are still in a dopamine deficit state two weeks

50:43.020 --> 50:44.780
 after we've been using our drug.

50:44.780 --> 50:47.580
 And then a study by Shuckett and Brown,

50:47.580 --> 50:51.140
 which took a group of depressed men

50:51.140 --> 50:53.680
 who also were addicted to alcohol,

50:53.680 --> 50:57.420
 put them in a hospital where they had received

50:57.420 --> 50:58.460
 no treatment for depression,

50:58.460 --> 51:01.180
 but they had no access to alcohol in that time.

51:01.180 --> 51:04.660
 And after four weeks, 80% of them no longer met criteria

51:04.660 --> 51:06.420
 for major depression.

51:06.420 --> 51:10.000
 So again, this idea that by depriving ourselves

51:10.000 --> 51:14.500
 of this high dopamine, high reward substance or behavior,

51:14.500 --> 51:17.100
 we allow our brains to regenerate its own dopamine

51:17.100 --> 51:18.700
 for the balance to really correlate,

51:18.700 --> 51:20.540
 and then we're in a place where we can

51:20.540 --> 51:22.620
 sort of enjoy other things.

51:22.620 --> 51:24.700
 So that progressive narrowing

51:24.700 --> 51:27.420
 of what brings one pleasure eventually expands.

51:27.420 --> 51:30.780
 So I'd like to dissect out that 30 days a little more,

51:30.780 --> 51:35.380
 finally, and I also want to address

51:35.380 --> 51:38.480
 how does one stop doing something for 30 days

51:38.480 --> 51:40.700
 if the thing is a thought?

51:40.700 --> 51:43.900
 So we'll kind of put that on the shelf for the moment.

51:43.900 --> 51:45.700
 So days one through 10,

51:47.180 --> 51:50.060
 I would imagine will be very uncomfortable.

51:50.060 --> 51:52.820
 They're going to suck, basically, to be quite honest,

51:52.820 --> 51:56.240
 because the way you describe this pleasure pain balance,

51:57.340 --> 52:00.260
 to my mind says that if you remove

52:00.260 --> 52:02.300
 what little pleasure one is getting,

52:02.300 --> 52:05.300
 or a lot of pleasure from engaging in some behavior,

52:05.300 --> 52:08.820
 that's gone, the pain system is really ramped up,

52:08.820 --> 52:11.660
 and nothing is making me feel good.

52:11.660 --> 52:13.220
 I'll just use myself as an example.

52:13.220 --> 52:14.720
 I'm not in recovery,

52:15.580 --> 52:19.240
 but that 10 days is going to be miserable.

52:19.240 --> 52:23.500
 Anxiety, trouble sleeping, physical agitation

52:23.500 --> 52:28.500
 and to the point where maybe impulsive, angry,

52:28.700 --> 52:30.820
 should one expect all of that?

52:30.820 --> 52:34.080
 Should the family members of people expect all of that?

52:34.080 --> 52:36.240
 Yeah, so what I say to patients,

52:36.240 --> 52:39.180
 and it's a really important piece of this intervention,

52:39.180 --> 52:42.700
 is that you will feel worse before you feel better.

52:42.700 --> 52:43.540
 For how long?

52:43.540 --> 52:44.360
 Yeah.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.660
 This is probably the first question they ask, right?

52:45.660 --> 52:49.060
 And I say, usually in my clinical experience,

52:49.060 --> 52:50.800
 you'll feel worse for two weeks,

52:50.800 --> 52:53.600
 but if you can make it through those first two weeks,

52:53.600 --> 52:56.220
 the sun will start to come out in week three,

52:56.220 --> 52:57.620
 and by week four,

52:57.620 --> 53:00.820
 most people are feeling a whole lot better than they were

53:00.820 --> 53:03.220
 before they stopped using their substance.

53:03.220 --> 53:07.140
 So yeah, you have to, it's a hard thing.

53:07.140 --> 53:09.100
 Like you have to sign up for it.

53:09.100 --> 53:10.340
 And I will say, obviously,

53:10.340 --> 53:12.860
 there are people with addictions that are so severe

53:12.860 --> 53:16.040
 that as long as they have access to their drug or behavior,

53:16.040 --> 53:17.740
 they're not able to stop themselves.

53:17.740 --> 53:20.460
 And that's why we have higher levels of care

53:20.460 --> 53:21.740
 or residential treatment.

53:21.740 --> 53:24.100
 So this is not going to be for everybody, this intervention,

53:24.100 --> 53:26.500
 but it's amazing how many people

53:26.500 --> 53:29.260
 with really severe addictions to things like heroin,

53:29.260 --> 53:33.960
 cocaine, very severe pornography addictions.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.740
 I posit this, and I do it as an experiment.

53:36.740 --> 53:39.460
 I said, you know what, let's try this experiment.

53:39.460 --> 53:41.220
 I'm always amazed, number one,

53:41.220 --> 53:42.420
 how many of them are willing,

53:42.420 --> 53:45.020
 and number two, how many of them are actually able to do it?

53:45.020 --> 53:46.600
 They are able to do it.

53:46.600 --> 53:50.060
 And so that little nudge is sort of just what they need.

53:50.060 --> 53:54.900
 And the carrot is, there's a better life out there for you,

53:54.900 --> 53:58.060
 and you'll be able to taste it in a month.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.860
 You really will be able to begin to see

54:00.860 --> 54:04.180
 that you can feel better and that there's another way.

54:04.180 --> 54:09.180
 So the way you describe it seems like it's hard,

54:09.580 --> 54:12.800
 but it's doable for most people, not everybody.

54:12.800 --> 54:15.380
 And we'll return to that category

54:15.380 --> 54:17.600
 of people who can't do that on their own.

54:19.380 --> 54:24.380
 Well, then days 21 through 30, people are feeling better.

54:25.340 --> 54:27.900
 The sun is starting to come out, as you mentioned,

54:27.900 --> 54:30.420
 which translates in the narrative we've created here

54:30.420 --> 54:32.400
 and supported by biology,

54:32.400 --> 54:35.460
 that dopamine is starting to be released in response

54:35.460 --> 54:38.340
 to the taste of a really good cup of coffee, for instance.

54:38.340 --> 54:39.580
 Yes, exactly.

54:39.580 --> 54:44.260
 Whereas before it was only to insert addictive behavior.

54:44.260 --> 54:45.300
 Right, that's right.

54:45.300 --> 54:46.140
 Whichever it happens to.

54:46.140 --> 54:47.220
 Of course, coffee can be addictive too,

54:47.220 --> 54:48.740
 but we'll leave that aside.

54:48.740 --> 54:50.380
 Yeah, I feel like coffee

54:50.380 --> 54:54.140
 has a kind of consumption limiting mechanism built in

54:54.140 --> 54:57.540
 where at some point you just can't ingest anymore.

54:57.540 --> 54:58.380
 Yeah.

54:58.380 --> 54:59.380
 But maybe that's wrong.

54:59.380 --> 55:03.700
 Sorry to give lift to the caffeine addicts out there

55:03.700 --> 55:07.060
 as I clutch my mug.

55:08.220 --> 55:09.860
 So days 21 through 30.

55:11.020 --> 55:14.280
 I've seen a lot of people go through addiction

55:14.280 --> 55:15.260
 and addiction treatment.

55:15.260 --> 55:18.360
 I've spent a lot of time in those places, actually,

55:18.360 --> 55:19.580
 looking at it, researching.

55:19.580 --> 55:20.960
 I've got friends in that community.

55:20.960 --> 55:22.720
 I'm close with that community.

55:23.840 --> 55:26.040
 One thing I've seen over and over again,

55:26.040 --> 55:28.340
 sadly, often in the same individuals,

55:28.340 --> 55:33.300
 is they get sober from whatever.

55:33.300 --> 55:35.060
 They're doing great.

55:35.060 --> 55:36.580
 These are people with families.

55:36.580 --> 55:39.480
 These are people that you discard your normal image

55:39.480 --> 55:44.140
 of an addict and insert the most normal, typical,

55:44.140 --> 55:46.140
 whatever healthy person you can imagine

55:46.140 --> 55:49.920
 because a lot of these people you wouldn't know were addicts.

55:49.920 --> 55:52.880
 And then all of a sudden you get this call.

55:52.880 --> 55:56.980
 So-and-so is back in jail, so-and-so's wife

55:56.980 --> 56:01.080
 is going to leave him because he drank two bottles of wine

56:01.080 --> 56:05.180
 and took a Xanax at 7 a.m., crashed his truck into a pole.

56:05.180 --> 56:06.420
 It's got two beautiful kids.

56:06.420 --> 56:09.580
 How did this happen again?

56:09.580 --> 56:12.180
 To the point where by the fourth and fifth time,

56:12.180 --> 56:14.700
 people are just done.

56:14.700 --> 56:15.960
 I mean, maybe people,

56:15.960 --> 56:17.820
 you might be able to detect the frustration in my voice.

56:17.820 --> 56:20.100
 I'm dealing with this with somebody that's like,

56:20.100 --> 56:22.760
 I don't even know that I want to help this time.

56:22.760 --> 56:25.180
 It's been so many times.

56:25.180 --> 56:27.540
 To the point where I'm starting to wonder,

56:27.540 --> 56:29.500
 is this person just an addict?

56:29.500 --> 56:32.700
 This is just kind of what they do and who they are.

56:32.700 --> 56:34.460
 And you never want to give up on people,

56:34.460 --> 56:37.020
 but, and I'm hanging in there for them,

56:37.020 --> 56:41.740
 but I will say that many people have given up on them.

56:41.740 --> 56:44.580
 And so what I'd like to talk about in this context is

56:44.580 --> 56:47.960
 what sorts of things help other people

56:47.960 --> 56:49.320
 that we know that are addicted?

56:49.320 --> 56:51.220
 What really helps?

56:51.220 --> 56:56.040
 Like not what could help, but what really helps.

56:56.040 --> 57:01.040
 And are there certain people for whom it's hopeless?

57:01.500 --> 57:03.580
 I mean, I don't like to hold the conversation that way,

57:03.580 --> 57:06.260
 but I wouldn't be close to the real life data

57:06.260 --> 57:08.520
 if I didn't ask, is it hopeless?

57:08.520 --> 57:11.780
 Are there people who just will not be able

57:11.780 --> 57:16.200
 to quit their substance use or their addictive behavior,

57:16.200 --> 57:19.280
 despite, I have to assume, really wanting to?

57:19.280 --> 57:23.620
 Yeah, so there are people who will die

57:23.620 --> 57:25.500
 of their disease of addiction.

57:25.500 --> 57:27.800
 And I think conceptualizing it as a disease

57:27.800 --> 57:29.480
 is a helpful frame.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.740
 There are other frames that we could use,

57:31.740 --> 57:35.980
 but I do think given the brain physiologic changes

57:35.980 --> 57:40.360
 that occur with sustained heavy drug use

57:40.360 --> 57:42.820
 and what we know happens to the brain,

57:42.820 --> 57:47.180
 it is really reasonable to think of it as a brain disease.

57:47.180 --> 57:52.180
 And for me, the real window of, let's say,

57:52.560 --> 57:54.740
 being able to access my compassion

57:54.740 --> 57:57.660
 around people who are repeat relapses

57:57.660 --> 57:59.720
 even when their life is so much better,

57:59.720 --> 58:00.560
 when they're in recovery.

58:00.560 --> 58:03.080
 Yeah, it's like a no-brainer, right?

58:03.080 --> 58:05.440
 Is to conceptualize this balance

58:05.440 --> 58:06.840
 and the dopamine deficit state

58:06.840 --> 58:09.840
 and a balance tilted to the side of pain.

58:09.840 --> 58:13.120
 And to imagine that for some people,

58:13.120 --> 58:16.940
 after a month or six months, or maybe even six years,

58:16.940 --> 58:20.140
 their balance is still tipped to the side of pain,

58:20.140 --> 58:24.140
 that on some level, that balance has lost its resilience

58:24.140 --> 58:26.620
 and its ability to restore homeostasis.

58:26.620 --> 58:28.900
 It's almost like the hinge on that balance is messed up.

58:28.900 --> 58:31.660
 Exactly, and so, I mean,

58:31.660 --> 58:35.060
 for someone who's never experienced addiction like yourself,

58:35.060 --> 58:37.420
 maybe one way to conceptualize it is-

58:37.420 --> 58:38.340
 Well, I didn't say that.

58:38.340 --> 58:39.180
 Oh, okay.

58:39.180 --> 58:42.900
 No, I was not, to be clear, I was not referring to myself,

58:42.900 --> 58:45.260
 but in this example I was given,

58:45.260 --> 58:49.780
 if I were, I would come clean, I would reveal that.

58:49.780 --> 58:52.020
 But I think that especially after hearing

58:52.020 --> 58:54.520
 some of your lectures and descriptions

58:54.520 --> 58:56.460
 of the range of things that are addictive,

58:56.460 --> 58:58.580
 I think I've been fortunate

58:58.580 --> 59:01.380
 I don't have a propensity for drugs or alcohol.

59:01.380 --> 59:04.140
 I'm lucky in that way that, frankly,

59:04.140 --> 59:05.820
 if they remove all the alcohol from the planet,

59:05.820 --> 59:08.660
 I'll just be relieved because no one will offer it to me.

59:08.660 --> 59:12.240
 So don't send me any alcohol, it won't go to me.

59:12.240 --> 59:16.380
 But I don't have that,

59:17.560 --> 59:20.300
 I like to think I have the compassion,

59:20.300 --> 59:24.420
 but I don't have that empathy

59:24.420 --> 59:29.420
 for taking a really good situation

59:29.620 --> 59:33.020
 and what from the outside looks to be throwing it

59:33.020 --> 59:33.860
 in the trash.

59:33.860 --> 59:35.420
 Yeah, so okay, so is that, let me,

59:35.420 --> 59:36.920
 and this is really, I think, important

59:36.920 --> 59:40.980
 because I also had to come to an understanding of this

59:40.980 --> 59:43.540
 and I feel that I have in my 20 years

59:43.540 --> 59:45.060
 of seeing these patients.

59:45.060 --> 59:47.220
 And of course, addiction is a spectrum disease, right?

59:47.220 --> 59:49.420
 And so you've got the severe end of things.

59:50.820 --> 59:54.860
 Imagine that you had an itch somewhere on your body, okay?

59:54.860 --> 59:56.500
 And it was, I mean, we've all had that,

59:56.500 --> 59:59.980
 like whatever the source, it was super, super itchy.

59:59.980 --> 1:00:03.900
 You can go for, if you really focus,

1:00:03.900 --> 1:00:06.860
 you could go for a pretty good amount of time

1:00:06.860 --> 1:00:10.780
 not scratching it, but the moment you stopped focusing

1:00:10.780 --> 1:00:13.500
 on not scratching it, you would scratch it.

1:00:13.500 --> 1:00:16.220
 And maybe you do it while you were asleep, right?

1:00:16.220 --> 1:00:21.220
 And that is what happens to people with severe addiction.

1:00:21.820 --> 1:00:24.380
 That balance is essentially broken.

1:00:24.380 --> 1:00:26.380
 Homeostasis does not get restored

1:00:26.380 --> 1:00:28.920
 despite sustained abstinence.

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:33.380
 They're living with that constant specter of that pull.

1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:35.080
 It never goes away.

1:00:35.080 --> 1:00:36.740
 So let me say, there are lots of people with addiction

1:00:36.740 --> 1:00:37.940
 for whom that does go away.

1:00:37.940 --> 1:00:40.260
 And it goes away at four weeks for many of them.

1:00:40.260 --> 1:00:45.260
 But in severe cases, that's always there and it's lingering.

1:00:45.300 --> 1:00:49.100
 And it's the moment when they're not focusing on not using,

1:00:49.100 --> 1:00:51.880
 it's like a reflex, they fall back into it.

1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:53.140
 It's not purposeful.

1:00:53.140 --> 1:00:55.180
 It's not because they wanna get high.

1:00:55.180 --> 1:00:57.020
 It's not because they value using drugs

1:00:57.020 --> 1:00:58.600
 more than they do their family.

1:00:58.600 --> 1:01:03.600
 None of that, it's that really they cannot not do it

1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:07.540
 when given the opportunity and that moment

1:01:07.540 --> 1:01:08.900
 when they're not thinking about it.

1:01:08.900 --> 1:01:09.740
 Does that make sense?

1:01:09.740 --> 1:01:10.820
 That's a great description.

1:01:10.820 --> 1:01:12.420
 And actually in that description,

1:01:12.420 --> 1:01:15.120
 I can feel a bit of empathy

1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:16.900
 because the way you described

1:01:16.900 --> 1:01:18.460
 scratching an itch in your sleep.

1:01:18.460 --> 1:01:19.760
 Yeah.

1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:21.020
 I've done that with mosquito bites.

1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:23.060
 In summer, you're scratching and you wake up

1:01:23.060 --> 1:01:26.300
 scratching that mosquito bite.

1:01:26.300 --> 1:01:31.300
 And I also have to admit that I've experienced

1:01:31.340 --> 1:01:33.580
 not feeling like I wanna pick up my phone

1:01:33.580 --> 1:01:36.780
 because it's so rewarding, but just finding myself doing it.

1:01:36.780 --> 1:01:37.620
 Yes, of course.

1:01:37.620 --> 1:01:38.700
 Like I'm not gonna use this thing.

1:01:38.700 --> 1:01:40.140
 I'm not gonna use this thing.

1:01:40.140 --> 1:01:43.060
 And then just finding myself like, what am I doing here?

1:01:43.060 --> 1:01:45.780
 Sort of the, how did I get back here again?

1:01:45.780 --> 1:01:48.700
 And I know enough about brain function

1:01:48.700 --> 1:01:51.200
 to understand that we have circuits

1:01:51.200 --> 1:01:53.460
 that generate deliberate behavior

1:01:53.460 --> 1:01:55.500
 and we have circuits that generate reflexive behavior.

1:01:55.500 --> 1:01:58.340
 And one of the goals of the nervous system

1:01:58.340 --> 1:02:01.080
 is to make the deliberate stuff reflexive

1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:02.380
 so you don't have to make the decision

1:02:02.380 --> 1:02:06.180
 because decision-making is a very costly thing to do.

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:08.300
 Decision-making of any kind.

1:02:08.300 --> 1:02:09.780
 So that does really help.

1:02:13.460 --> 1:02:18.260
 I wanna just try and weave together this dopamine puzzle,

1:02:18.260 --> 1:02:20.820
 however, because if by week,

1:02:20.820 --> 1:02:25.540
 so first phase of this 30 or 40-day detox,

1:02:25.540 --> 1:02:28.000
 it's like a dopamine fast, right?

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.340
 Okay.

1:02:29.340 --> 1:02:30.460
 First 10 days are miserable.

1:02:30.460 --> 1:02:32.980
 Middle 10 days, the clouds are out.

1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:35.060
 There may be some shards of sunlight coming through.

1:02:35.060 --> 1:02:38.020
 And then all of a sudden, sun starts to come out.

1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:39.740
 It gets brighter and brighter.

1:02:39.740 --> 1:02:42.620
 Why is it then that people will relapse,

1:02:42.620 --> 1:02:44.920
 not just after getting fired from a job

1:02:44.920 --> 1:02:45.900
 or their spouse leaving them,

1:02:45.900 --> 1:02:48.020
 but when things are going really well?

1:02:48.020 --> 1:02:50.660
 Is it this unconscious mechanism?

1:02:50.660 --> 1:02:53.960
 Because I've seen this before, they have a great win.

1:02:53.960 --> 1:02:57.660
 I have a friend who's a really impressive creative.

1:02:57.660 --> 1:03:00.420
 I don't want to reveal any more than that.

1:03:00.420 --> 1:03:05.340
 And relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity

1:03:05.340 --> 1:03:07.660
 to create for the entire world.

1:03:07.660 --> 1:03:09.140
 And I was like, how can that happen?

1:03:09.140 --> 1:03:10.440
 But now I'm beginning to wonder,

1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:13.180
 was it the dopamine associated with that win

1:03:13.180 --> 1:03:16.720
 that opened the spigot on this dopamine system?

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:19.340
 Because it happened in a phase

1:03:19.340 --> 1:03:22.220
 of a really great stretch of life.

1:03:22.220 --> 1:03:23.860
 Yeah, right.

1:03:23.860 --> 1:03:27.660
 Yeah, so you raised that great point about triggers, right?

1:03:27.660 --> 1:03:30.900
 And triggers are things that make us want

1:03:30.900 --> 1:03:32.940
 to go back to using our drug.

1:03:32.940 --> 1:03:35.300
 And the key thing about triggers, whatever they are,

1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:39.020
 is they also release a little bit of dopamine, right?

1:03:39.020 --> 1:03:43.260
 So just thinking about whatever the trigger is

1:03:43.260 --> 1:03:45.200
 that we associate with drug use,

1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:47.200
 or just thinking about drug use,

1:03:47.200 --> 1:03:50.000
 can already release this anticipatory dopamine,

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.180
 this new little mini spike.

1:03:51.180 --> 1:03:53.680
 But here's the part that I think is really fascinating.

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:57.200
 That mini spike is followed by a mini deficit state.

1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:59.780
 So it goes up and then it doesn't go back down to baseline.

1:03:59.780 --> 1:04:02.620
 It goes below baseline tonic levels.

1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:04.420
 And that's craving, right?

1:04:04.420 --> 1:04:08.520
 So that anticipation is immediately followed

1:04:08.520 --> 1:04:11.140
 by wanting the drug.

1:04:11.140 --> 1:04:12.860
 And it's that dopamine deficit state

1:04:12.860 --> 1:04:16.780
 that drives the motivation to go and get the drug.

1:04:16.780 --> 1:04:18.020
 So many people talk about dopamine

1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:19.580
 as not really about pleasure,

1:04:19.580 --> 1:04:22.420
 but about wanting and about motivation.

1:04:22.420 --> 1:04:24.420
 And so it is that deficit state

1:04:24.420 --> 1:04:27.280
 that then drives the locomotion to get it.

1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:29.140
 And earlier, your description of dopamine

1:04:29.140 --> 1:04:31.340
 being involved in the desire for more,

1:04:31.340 --> 1:04:33.980
 giving the sense of reward, but also movement,

1:04:33.980 --> 1:04:35.300
 I have to assume that those things

1:04:35.300 --> 1:04:37.380
 are braided together in our nervous system

1:04:37.380 --> 1:04:41.020
 for the specific intention of when you feel something good,

1:04:41.020 --> 1:04:43.660
 then you feel the pain, or maybe you don't notice it.

1:04:43.660 --> 1:04:44.580
 And then the next thing you know,

1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:46.500
 you're pursuing more of the thing that could deliver.

1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:48.240
 And I love the way you use the word braided together.

1:04:48.240 --> 1:04:49.080
 That's beautiful.

1:04:49.080 --> 1:04:50.780
 And let me also just say something

1:04:50.780 --> 1:04:54.180
 that I find also fascinating in my work with patients,

1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:55.620
 and I see this all the time.

1:04:55.620 --> 1:04:59.000
 There are people for whom bad life experiences,

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:03.540
 loss in any form, stress in many different forms,

1:05:03.540 --> 1:05:04.380
 that's a trigger.

1:05:04.380 --> 1:05:06.340
 But there are absolutely people

1:05:06.340 --> 1:05:09.920
 for whom the trigger is things going well.

1:05:09.920 --> 1:05:11.700
 And the things going well

1:05:11.700 --> 1:05:13.580
 can be like the reward of the things going well,

1:05:13.580 --> 1:05:15.500
 but very often what it is

1:05:15.500 --> 1:05:18.600
 is the removal of the hypervigilant state

1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:21.380
 that's required to keep their use in check.

1:05:21.380 --> 1:05:24.620
 So it's this sense of, I wanna celebrate,

1:05:24.620 --> 1:05:26.820
 or I wanna, this reward happened,

1:05:26.820 --> 1:05:29.380
 I wanna put more reward on there.

1:05:29.380 --> 1:05:31.200
 And it's really, really fascinating

1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:34.300
 because when people come to that realization

1:05:34.300 --> 1:05:37.420
 about themselves, that they're most vulnerable

1:05:37.420 --> 1:05:40.020
 when things are going well,

1:05:40.020 --> 1:05:41.820
 that's really a valuable insight

1:05:41.820 --> 1:05:43.840
 because then they can put some things in place

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:46.180
 or barriers in place or go to more meetings

1:05:46.180 --> 1:05:50.300
 or whatever it is that they do to protect themselves.

1:05:50.300 --> 1:05:53.900
 Along those lines, I have a friend, 40 years sober,

1:05:53.900 --> 1:05:56.020
 who was a severe drug and alcohol addict

1:05:56.020 --> 1:05:58.020
 from a very young age, really impressive person,

1:05:58.020 --> 1:05:59.060
 does a lot of important work

1:05:59.060 --> 1:06:02.820
 in the kind of at-risk youth community out in Hawaii.

1:06:02.820 --> 1:06:03.820
 And he said something to me.

1:06:03.820 --> 1:06:06.980
 He said, as former addicts often do,

1:06:06.980 --> 1:06:09.300
 they've got these great sayings,

1:06:09.300 --> 1:06:11.220
 but I think it fits very well with what you're describing.

1:06:11.220 --> 1:06:14.340
 He said, no matter how far you drive,

1:06:14.340 --> 1:06:16.720
 you're always the same distance from the ditch.

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:19.860
 And I said, well, that's kind of depressing.

1:06:19.860 --> 1:06:23.060
 And he said, no, that's actually what gives me peace

1:06:23.060 --> 1:06:25.680
 because what would happen is for so many years

1:06:25.680 --> 1:06:27.540
 of relapsing and relapsing,

1:06:27.540 --> 1:06:30.140
 getting recovering and relapsing,

1:06:30.140 --> 1:06:33.220
 he felt like it was hopeless.

1:06:33.220 --> 1:06:35.140
 And then somehow conceptualizing

1:06:35.140 --> 1:06:38.820
 that the vigilance can never go away

1:06:38.820 --> 1:06:41.620
 instead of making him feel burdened,

1:06:41.620 --> 1:06:42.980
 it made him feel relieved.

1:06:42.980 --> 1:06:46.100
 So I often think about that statement,

1:06:46.100 --> 1:06:47.260
 no matter how far you drive,

1:06:47.260 --> 1:06:48.840
 you're always the same distance from the ditch

1:06:48.840 --> 1:06:50.700
 because in my mind, I conceptualize that as,

1:06:50.700 --> 1:06:53.740
 gosh, that's a tough way to drive down the road,

1:06:53.740 --> 1:06:57.420
 but actually on a road where you know where the ditch is

1:06:57.420 --> 1:06:59.240
 and where you know where the lane lines are,

1:06:59.240 --> 1:07:00.960
 it's actually a pretty nice drive.

1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:02.580
 It's when you don't know where the shoulder is

1:07:02.580 --> 1:07:04.220
 that you constantly have to be looking around.

1:07:04.220 --> 1:07:06.460
 So there's this, we're speaking now

1:07:06.460 --> 1:07:11.420
 in analogies and imagery and science,

1:07:11.420 --> 1:07:14.300
 but one of the things I find so incredible

1:07:14.300 --> 1:07:16.300
 about this community of 12-step,

1:07:16.300 --> 1:07:18.700
 and there are a variety of them,

1:07:18.700 --> 1:07:22.380
 are the communities that they create for themselves

1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:24.760
 and some of these sayings,

1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:27.580
 which I do believe link back to really

1:07:27.580 --> 1:07:29.060
 core biological mechanisms.

1:07:29.060 --> 1:07:30.340
 Yes, yes.

1:07:30.340 --> 1:07:32.460
 I do want to ask about those communities.

1:07:32.460 --> 1:07:36.700
 I have a question which might be a little bit controversial.

1:07:36.700 --> 1:07:37.540
 Great.

1:07:37.540 --> 1:07:41.580
 Which is, is it possible that people

1:07:41.580 --> 1:07:43.500
 who were addicted to drugs or alcohol

1:07:43.500 --> 1:07:46.000
 or some gambling or some other behavior

1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:49.180
 get addicted to the addiction community?

1:07:49.180 --> 1:07:53.440
 Because one thing that I think I observe over and over

1:07:53.440 --> 1:07:56.500
 is that there's some circuit in the brain of human beings

1:07:56.500 --> 1:07:59.100
 that has to tell you about the dream

1:07:59.100 --> 1:08:01.360
 they had the night before, for whatever reason.

1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:06.100
 There's another circuit that leads people to wake you up

1:08:06.100 --> 1:08:07.420
 if they themselves can't sleep.

1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:08.900
 I don't know what that circuit is.

1:08:08.900 --> 1:08:10.340
 I'm being facetious here.

1:08:10.340 --> 1:08:13.060
 But there does seem to also be a circuit

1:08:13.060 --> 1:08:16.360
 in the brain of addicts to discuss

1:08:16.360 --> 1:08:21.360
 and want to kind of talk about their recovery a lot.

1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:23.880
 And I mentioned this not to poke at them,

1:08:23.880 --> 1:08:25.280
 but rather the opposite,

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:29.120
 because I think that one thing that is challenging,

1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:30.720
 at least for me and having friends

1:08:30.720 --> 1:08:33.520
 that have a propensity for drug or alcohol addiction,

1:08:33.520 --> 1:08:35.480
 not all of them, but certainly some of them,

1:08:35.480 --> 1:08:37.480
 is when they're talking about their recovery,

1:08:37.480 --> 1:08:40.760
 I feel like it's all they talk about.

1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:42.800
 This meeting, that meeting, that meeting.

1:08:44.160 --> 1:08:46.920
 How are we, so what I'm really asking here is,

1:08:46.920 --> 1:08:51.520
 is that can we become addicted to sobriety?

1:08:52.700 --> 1:08:55.460
 Right, so this is a great question.

1:08:55.460 --> 1:08:56.960
 And it links into some of the other things

1:08:56.960 --> 1:08:59.640
 we've been talking about having to do with

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:01.620
 where do we settle out?

1:09:01.620 --> 1:09:04.520
 What is the way to live between pleasure and pain?

1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:07.140
 And I implied earlier that ultimately

1:09:07.140 --> 1:09:08.620
 we want a resilient balance

1:09:08.620 --> 1:09:10.200
 that's sensitive to pleasure and pain,

1:09:10.200 --> 1:09:14.260
 but that can easily restore homeostasis after we indulge,

1:09:14.260 --> 1:09:17.100
 even when we indulge greatly.

1:09:17.100 --> 1:09:18.880
 But the truth of the matter is that

1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:21.560
 people with severe addiction, I believe,

1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:25.200
 temperamentally want those extremes

1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:28.480
 and they're wired for that kind of intensity

1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:31.360
 that is more than just these slight adjustments

1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:32.500
 around the fulcrum, right?

1:09:32.500 --> 1:09:35.160
 It's like, they want the big highs and the big lows.

1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:36.520
 They'll say, great meeting.

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:37.360
 Yeah, right.

1:09:37.360 --> 1:09:38.200
 They're like, that was such an amazing meeting.

1:09:38.200 --> 1:09:41.360
 Or they find a group, they find a group in a location.

1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:44.640
 Like this is almost an inside joke in those communities.

1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:45.800
 Again, I'm not reporting,

1:09:45.800 --> 1:09:47.360
 I'm not talking about a friend in quotes.

1:09:47.360 --> 1:09:48.400
 This isn't me reporting.

1:09:48.400 --> 1:09:52.120
 Well, they'll talk about how attractive people are

1:09:52.120 --> 1:09:52.960
 at a given meeting,

1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:55.880
 or how bonded they feel to people at a given meeting,

1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:58.040
 that the meetings themselves

1:09:58.040 --> 1:10:00.600
 become their own form of dopamine hit.

1:10:00.600 --> 1:10:01.440
 Yes, yes.

1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:02.880
 And again, I'm not being disparaging.

1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:04.880
 I just, I want to understand this.

1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:08.560
 Right, so yes, so a lot of times patients will say to me,

1:10:08.560 --> 1:10:11.320
 oh, you know, I don't want to go to AA, it's a cult.

1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:15.760
 And my response to that is because it's a cult

1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:18.600
 is exactly why it works, okay?

1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:23.600
 Because yes, it is much better for you to be addicted to AA

1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:26.980
 and to recovery than almost any other addiction

1:10:26.980 --> 1:10:28.480
 I could think of.

1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:30.280
 And we know from Rob Malenka's work,

1:10:30.280 --> 1:10:31.680
 who's here at Stanford,

1:10:31.680 --> 1:10:35.560
 that oxytocin is the hormone that's involved

1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:39.940
 in human pair bonding and relationships and love.

1:10:39.940 --> 1:10:42.560
 And it directly links to dopamine neurons

1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:44.000
 and causes the release of dopamine.

1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:46.680
 So yes, when we connect with other humans,

1:10:46.680 --> 1:10:49.460
 especially in a kind of transcendent spiritual way,

1:10:49.460 --> 1:10:51.000
 that's a huge dopamine hit.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.960
 And it does replace the dopamine that people get from drugs.

1:10:53.960 --> 1:10:58.400
 And for people who have this addiction temperament,

1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:00.760
 they need it on a more intense level.

1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:03.880
 They're not going to be generally satisfied

1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:08.160
 with kind of, you know, a sort of acquaintanceship, right?

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:11.900
 They want that intensity of the intimacy that you get

1:11:11.900 --> 1:11:15.080
 with people when you're cathartically exposing,

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:16.560
 you know, warts and all.

1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:19.160
 So yes, people can get addicted to recovery

1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:22.400
 and good for them, go for it, you know?

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:25.560
 And of course this can be disruptive for friendships

1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:28.600
 and relationships where the one person is not in recovery.

1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:30.280
 Like you're going to so many meetings,

1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:31.960
 you're always talking about recovery, but you know what?

1:11:31.960 --> 1:11:34.500
 Much better than them being intoxicated, right?

1:11:34.500 --> 1:11:37.000
 I mean, so although you may tire of your friends

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000
 talking about their meetings all the time,

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:40.880
 I'm sure you would rather have them do that

1:11:40.880 --> 1:11:43.440
 than, you know, be in their addiction, so.

1:11:43.440 --> 1:11:44.280
 Absolutely.

1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:45.680
 And this is now the second time

1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:47.240
 you've done this during this discussion,

1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:50.160
 but now I have empathy because the way you describe

1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:52.680
 their enthusiasm about meetings

1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:56.400
 is probably the way that people feel about me and your work.

1:11:56.400 --> 1:11:58.120
 And in neuroscience, I mean,

1:11:58.120 --> 1:12:00.880
 I've been getting up in front of the class

1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:02.360
 since I was eight years old

1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:04.160
 and talking about things I read over the weekend.

1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:07.440
 Now I just happen to have this thing called a podcast.

1:12:07.440 --> 1:12:08.400
 I've been doing it since I was little,

1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:11.080
 and it annoys a lot of people, right?

1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:12.680
 I've learned to suppress it a little bit.

1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:16.520
 Some people like it, but I'm poking fun at myself

1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:20.080
 just to say that I now can understand

1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:21.760
 that the way I feel about their reports

1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:23.640
 about yet another amazing meeting,

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:27.560
 or there's a different form of this,

1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:29.560
 but there are some people for which

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:32.080
 they just love intense experiences.

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:35.160
 They're always like trying to pull me off to Bali

1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:37.560
 because they're talking about how sensual it is all the time.

1:12:37.560 --> 1:12:39.120
 I'm sure Bali is wonderful,

1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:41.160
 but there's this kind of ratcheting up.

1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:43.900
 It's like seeking Burning Man all year long.

1:12:43.900 --> 1:12:44.880
 I've never been to Burning Man,

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:46.440
 no desire to go to Burning Man,

1:12:49.480 --> 1:12:51.600
 but inside of academia, I mean,

1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:54.320
 if I were to just turn the mirror at myself

1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:58.600
 inside of academia or here in Silicon Valley, work,

1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:01.680
 and the pursuit of more success,

1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:04.500
 even if money is kind of divorced from that,

1:13:04.500 --> 1:13:05.800
 sometimes it is, sometimes it isn't.

1:13:05.800 --> 1:13:09.640
 Academic work is for sake of pursuit of knowledge.

1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:12.000
 It sounds to me like the same mechanism.

1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:16.280
 In fact, it feels to me very much like the same mechanism.

1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:18.240
 So Andrew, here's what I love about you.

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:21.120
 First of all, you're willing to bring your own flaws

1:13:21.120 --> 1:13:22.520
 and foibles to this conversation.

1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:23.800
 Well, they're everywhere.

1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:25.360
 Well, you know what?

1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:26.720
 It's wonderful.

1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:29.280
 And then you're really open and curious

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:31.240
 and wanting to understand,

1:13:31.240 --> 1:13:33.600
 because I can't tell you how many people I have met

1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:37.080
 who really see addiction as some kind of otherness,

1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:39.840
 but the truth is we're all wired for addiction.

1:13:39.840 --> 1:13:41.400
 And if you're not addicted yet,

1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:43.400
 it's just, it's right around the corner.

1:13:43.400 --> 1:13:44.500
 Do you know what I mean?

1:13:44.500 --> 1:13:47.800
 Especially with the incredible panoply of new drugs

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:49.760
 and behaviors that are out there.

1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:53.200
 So I love that you're willing to take a moment

1:13:53.200 --> 1:13:55.660
 and really try to understand this,

1:13:55.660 --> 1:13:58.400
 because it is, we can all relate,

1:13:58.400 --> 1:14:02.000
 and you're relating it to essentially your work addiction

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.760
 is right and apt.

1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:05.440
 You just happen to be addicted to something

1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:08.160
 that is really socially rewarded.

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:10.040
 You figured that out in an early age.

1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:12.760
 Oh, when I do X, Y, and Z, all these people go,

1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:15.360
 look at that smart kid or whatever it is.

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:16.880
 For me, it made me feel safe.

1:14:16.880 --> 1:14:17.720
 Okay.

1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:21.920
 I felt like, yeah, I just felt like this,

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:24.600
 and I pause there, because it's like peace.

1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:27.560
 I'm like, ah, I can relax for a moment.

1:14:27.560 --> 1:14:29.200
 When you're talking about neuroscience.

1:14:29.200 --> 1:14:33.040
 Or just when I feel like I'm on the right path,

1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:34.200
 and I'm onto something,

1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:36.840
 or if I see something that I'm excited about,

1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:41.040
 I'm like, I feel filled with, it must be dopamine.

1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:44.440
 I feel flooded with pleasure, literally from head to toe.

1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.460
 And then my next thought is, more.

1:14:46.460 --> 1:14:51.220
 So true, you're a true addict, you are.

1:14:51.220 --> 1:14:53.360
 You are, but you just got really,

1:14:53.360 --> 1:14:55.680
 you really got lucky with the fact

1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:00.680
 that what you're drawn to is adaptive, essentially.

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:04.180
 And then your challenge is going to be

1:15:04.180 --> 1:15:06.360
 that your life doesn't get too out of balance

1:15:06.360 --> 1:15:08.800
 in the sense that you're 24-7 work,

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:11.800
 and you don't stop and do some other things

1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:12.640
 or think about it.

1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:15.120
 And my life, admittedly, is somewhat asymmetric.

1:15:15.120 --> 1:15:17.320
 I mean, it has other components of physical health, et cetera,

1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:21.680
 but it is somewhat asymmetric, which is why I got a dog.

1:15:21.680 --> 1:15:24.420
 Although I talk about him an awful lot, so.

1:15:24.420 --> 1:15:27.160
 But the dog is good, because that draws you out of yourself

1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:28.700
 and a little bit away from the work.

1:15:28.700 --> 1:15:30.840
 But again, I think the key here is,

1:15:30.840 --> 1:15:33.160
 for people who feel like they've never experienced addiction

1:15:33.160 --> 1:15:34.520
 or they don't know anybody with addiction,

1:15:34.520 --> 1:15:35.960
 or if they do, they don't get it,

1:15:35.960 --> 1:15:38.160
 just think of that one thing

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:41.080
 that is the most important thing in your life that you do

1:15:41.080 --> 1:15:43.440
 that gives you pleasure and meaning and purpose,

1:15:43.440 --> 1:15:46.080
 and then imagine if you couldn't do it.

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:47.680
 Oh yeah, let's not talk about that.

1:15:47.680 --> 1:15:51.320
 Right.

1:15:51.320 --> 1:15:53.000
 Well, I appreciate the feedback,

1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.480
 and you can send me a bill at the end.

1:15:57.880 --> 1:16:01.280
 What is the most ridiculous-sounding addiction

1:16:01.280 --> 1:16:04.040
 that you've ever witnessed

1:16:04.040 --> 1:16:07.340
 that was actually a real addiction along these lines?

1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:11.920
 Because I think we all know the standard heroin pill.

1:16:11.920 --> 1:16:13.920
 You've been very, I should mention,

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:16.640
 because it's important, your previous book,

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:18.880
 and we will provide a link to that as well,

1:16:18.880 --> 1:16:20.600
 focused on the opioid crisis

1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:23.960
 and what we thought was medication.

1:16:23.960 --> 1:16:26.740
 It turned out to be just as bad, if not worse,

1:16:26.740 --> 1:16:29.360
 than a lot of so-called street drugs.

1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:31.980
 So we understand those, you know, gambling,

1:16:31.980 --> 1:16:34.520
 sex addiction, porn addiction, now video games.

1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:36.640
 We'll talk about social media a little bit more in depth,

1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:40.080
 but what's the most, like, wow,

1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:42.940
 I didn't realize people could get addicted to that.

1:16:44.140 --> 1:16:45.400
 Water.

1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:46.980
 Really?

1:16:46.980 --> 1:16:49.960
 Really, so I had a very lovely patient

1:16:49.960 --> 1:16:52.960
 who had a severe alcohol addiction,

1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:56.660
 and she got into recovery from her alcohol addiction

1:16:56.660 --> 1:17:00.960
 for many years, but she kind of had a sort of a polydipsia

1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:04.420
 or an urge to be drinking something a lot,

1:17:04.420 --> 1:17:06.480
 and so she drank a lot of water,

1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:09.260
 and slowly, over time, she realized

1:17:09.260 --> 1:17:10.880
 that if she drank enough water,

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:13.680
 she could become hyponatremic and delirious

1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:14.960
 and be out of herself, which is-

1:17:14.960 --> 1:17:15.800
 You can die from it, right?

1:17:15.800 --> 1:17:19.240
 Right, which is, she just wanted to be out of her own head,

1:17:19.240 --> 1:17:21.600
 and so she would periodically,

1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:26.600
 intentionally overdose on water in order to,

1:17:26.760 --> 1:17:29.760
 I know it was so sad, so sad.

1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:30.880
 What happened to her?

1:17:30.880 --> 1:17:33.000
 She eventually took her own life.

1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:34.200
 Wow. Yeah, it was really-

1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:35.020
 That's rough.

1:17:35.020 --> 1:17:36.520
 She was a lovely woman.

1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:37.580
 She was so bright.

1:17:37.580 --> 1:17:40.000
 She had so many interests and passions,

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.640
 and of course, it was very sad when she died,

1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:47.600
 but that was a wow to me.

1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:51.120
 It was like, wow, if you have this disease of addiction,

1:17:51.120 --> 1:17:53.040
 you can even get addicted to water.

1:17:53.040 --> 1:17:55.280
 Wow, and I think it just underscores

1:17:55.280 --> 1:17:58.520
 the generalizability of these circuits.

1:17:58.520 --> 1:17:59.360
 Right.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:01.520
 There isn't a brain circuit for addiction to water

1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:02.480
 that she happened to have.

1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:04.640
 There's a brain circuit for pleasure and pain

1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:08.280
 and addiction and water plugged into that circuit.

1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:09.320
 Right.

1:18:09.320 --> 1:18:11.260
 Wow, that's intense.

1:18:12.320 --> 1:18:14.600
 In your book, Dopamine Nation,

1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:19.420
 you also describe some amazing paths to recovery.

1:18:19.420 --> 1:18:23.920
 People that, you know, from reading it,

1:18:23.920 --> 1:18:25.720
 I won't say which ones and who,

1:18:25.720 --> 1:18:28.120
 because there's some great surprises in the book too,

1:18:28.120 --> 1:18:32.420
 both tragic and triumphant, as they say.

1:18:32.420 --> 1:18:35.640
 You've often described your patients as your heroes.

1:18:35.640 --> 1:18:36.480
 Yeah.

1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:38.200
 Yeah, tell us a little bit more about that.

1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:41.440
 You know, when you think about how hard it is

1:18:41.440 --> 1:18:44.220
 to give up a drug or a behavior that you're addicted to,

1:18:44.220 --> 1:18:47.880
 how much courage that takes and fortitude and discipline

1:18:47.880 --> 1:18:49.640
 and stick-to-it-iveness,

1:18:49.640 --> 1:18:52.520
 these people are really amazing people.

1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:55.640
 I mean, that's, I don't know that I could do it,

1:18:55.640 --> 1:18:57.600
 what they do, you know?

1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:01.960
 It's, and like, you know, we talked a little bit about,

1:19:01.960 --> 1:19:05.840
 you know, just the constant, ever-present urge to use,

1:19:05.840 --> 1:19:09.200
 even after sustained periods of abstinence for some people.

1:19:09.200 --> 1:19:10.760
 That's really, really hard.

1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:13.840
 And of course, then you double down on the shame

1:19:13.840 --> 1:19:16.400
 that they feel because of that urge,

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:18.640
 even when their lives are so much better.

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:22.280
 I mean, these people are really, really remarkable.

1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:24.920
 And you take their remarkable accomplishment,

1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:27.840
 and then you imagine the world that we live in now,

1:19:27.840 --> 1:19:31.640
 where we are constantly invited and tempted

1:19:31.640 --> 1:19:34.400
 and really bombarded with opportunities

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:36.240
 to become addicted at every turn.

1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:37.080
 It's like peeling an itch everywhere.

1:19:37.080 --> 1:19:38.680
 Oh yeah, I mean, you can't escape it.

1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:40.000
 You know, you cannot escape it,

1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:41.760
 but you'll get an email in your inbox

1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:43.600
 inviting you to do X, Y, or Z.

1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:45.040
 And if you're addicted to that thing,

1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:46.840
 you know, you tried to like delete all your apps

1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:48.920
 and not go here, all of a sudden your work inbox,

1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:51.780
 you're, you know, you're getting those images, let's say,

1:19:51.780 --> 1:19:54.040
 really, really, really hard.

1:19:54.040 --> 1:19:56.400
 And yet these people find a way to do it.

1:19:56.400 --> 1:19:58.080
 I think it's absolutely amazing.

1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:00.120
 And they're really wise people.

1:20:00.120 --> 1:20:02.080
 They have so much wisdom to offer.

1:20:02.080 --> 1:20:03.200
 They've taught me a lot.

1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:04.360
 You know, as I talk about in my book,

1:20:04.360 --> 1:20:05.480
 I have my own addictions,

1:20:05.480 --> 1:20:08.240
 and I really just like took a page right out of their box.

1:20:08.240 --> 1:20:09.600
 Okay, what do I do now?

1:20:09.600 --> 1:20:10.840
 All right, what did this patient do?

1:20:10.840 --> 1:20:12.640
 Okay, I'm gonna try that.

1:20:12.640 --> 1:20:15.680
 It is an amazing community of people

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:17.860
 that are very sage.

1:20:17.860 --> 1:20:21.460
 I wanted to just touch on something that you mentioned,

1:20:21.460 --> 1:20:23.560
 which is the shame.

1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:25.360
 You know, you can't go to a meeting

1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:30.640
 or talk to addicts without detecting

1:20:30.640 --> 1:20:34.480
 or hearing about like lies, shame, et cetera.

1:20:34.480 --> 1:20:38.340
 I heard you say in an interview with somebody else recently

1:20:38.340 --> 1:20:43.000
 that truth-telling and secrets are sort of

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.400
 at the core of recovery.

1:20:45.400 --> 1:20:48.740
 And yeah, tell us more about that.

1:20:48.740 --> 1:20:52.500
 Yeah, so one of the things that I found really fascinating

1:20:52.500 --> 1:20:54.440
 about working with people in recovery

1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:56.660
 was how telling the truth,

1:20:56.660 --> 1:20:59.600
 even about the merest detail of their lives,

1:20:59.600 --> 1:21:01.520
 was central to their recovery.

1:21:01.520 --> 1:21:03.440
 And I became really curious about that.

1:21:03.440 --> 1:21:06.120
 Like, why would truth-telling be so important?

1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:07.640
 And of course, there is the obvious thing

1:21:07.640 --> 1:21:09.040
 that when people are in their addiction,

1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:10.640
 they're lying about using.

1:21:10.640 --> 1:21:13.780
 You know, so part of getting into recovery

1:21:13.780 --> 1:21:16.200
 is to stop lying to the people they care about

1:21:16.200 --> 1:21:17.360
 about their use.

1:21:17.360 --> 1:21:19.260
 But it's really more than that

1:21:19.260 --> 1:21:21.720
 because what people in recovery have taught me

1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:25.560
 is that it's not even just not lying about using drugs.

1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:28.080
 I have to not lie about anything.

1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:30.640
 I can't lie about why I was late to work this morning,

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:31.480
 which we all do.

1:21:31.480 --> 1:21:32.340
 Oh, I hit traffic.

1:21:32.340 --> 1:21:33.340
 No, I didn't hit traffic.

1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:35.560
 I wanted to spend two more minutes reading the paper

1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:37.640
 drinking my coffee, right?

1:21:37.640 --> 1:21:39.880
 Or just lying about, you know,

1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:41.760
 I don't know where I had dinner.

1:21:41.760 --> 1:21:43.480
 Like, so people with addiction

1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:45.240
 will get into, you know, the lying habit

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:46.720
 where they're lying about random stuff

1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:48.960
 because they're sort of in the habit of lying.

1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:53.640
 And how recovery is really about telling the truth,

1:21:53.640 --> 1:21:54.880
 you know, in all ways.

1:21:54.880 --> 1:21:57.960
 And so one of the things that I had a lot of fun with

1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:00.040
 in writing the book is sort of exploring

1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:04.840
 the neuroscience around why truth-telling is important

1:22:04.840 --> 1:22:06.420
 to leading a balanced life.

1:22:06.420 --> 1:22:09.160
 And we know like every religion since the beginning of time

1:22:09.160 --> 1:22:10.260
 is all about telling the truth.

1:22:10.260 --> 1:22:11.360
 Well, why, right?

1:22:11.360 --> 1:22:14.480
 And there's really interesting neuroscience behind it

1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:17.640
 that suggests that when we tell the truth,

1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:19.860
 we actually potentially strengthen

1:22:19.860 --> 1:22:22.520
 our prefrontal cortical circuits

1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:24.760
 and their connections to our limbic brain

1:22:24.760 --> 1:22:26.080
 and our reward brain.

1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:28.360
 And of course, these are the circuits that get disconnected

1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:29.900
 when we're in our addiction, right?

1:22:29.900 --> 1:22:32.540
 Our balance in our reward pathway, our limbic brain,

1:22:32.540 --> 1:22:34.200
 our emotion brain is doing one thing

1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:37.040
 and our cortical circuits are completely disengaged

1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:38.420
 from that ignoring what's happening,

1:22:38.420 --> 1:22:40.400
 which is easy to do because it's reflexive.

1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:42.700
 We don't need to think about that balance

1:22:42.700 --> 1:22:44.460
 for the balance to be happening,

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:47.080
 but we have to re-engage those circuits,

1:22:47.080 --> 1:22:50.640
 anticipate future consequences, think through the drink,

1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:54.000
 you know, not just how am I gonna feel now if I use,

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.560
 but how am I gonna feel tomorrow or six months from now?

1:22:56.560 --> 1:23:00.440
 And that telling the truth is in fact a way to do that,

1:23:00.440 --> 1:23:02.360
 to make these connections stronger.

1:23:02.360 --> 1:23:04.040
 And there, I talk about some studies in my book

1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:06.740
 that kind of indirectly show that.

1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:08.080
 So I find that really fascinating.

1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:12.280
 Plus just that like being open and honest with people

1:23:12.280 --> 1:23:16.520
 really does create very intimate connections

1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:20.400
 and those intimate connections create dopamine.

1:23:20.400 --> 1:23:21.800
 So we were talking a little bit about

1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:23.680
 how you know a bunch of people

1:23:23.680 --> 1:23:26.160
 who need like intensity in their lives.

1:23:26.160 --> 1:23:31.080
 For me, I need a lot of intensity in my human connections.

1:23:31.080 --> 1:23:34.120
 Like I'm really not interested in and bored by

1:23:34.120 --> 1:23:39.120
 and made anxious by casual interactions.

1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:41.920
 But you know, like having this kind of discussion with you

1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:46.320
 that's very intense and also intimate and self-disclosing

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:47.840
 is very rewarding for me.

1:23:47.840 --> 1:23:49.480
 So that's an important source of dopamine.

1:23:49.480 --> 1:23:51.360
 Thank God I became a psychiatrist.

1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:52.200
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:23:52.200 --> 1:23:53.840
 Like I can't disclose all my stuff,

1:23:53.840 --> 1:23:55.880
 but I am quite transparent with my patients,

1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:57.700
 which is a slightly unorthodox.

1:23:58.600 --> 1:24:00.080
 But you know, when I think it's right,

1:24:00.080 --> 1:24:01.520
 I'm also transparent with them.

1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:03.960
 So that's, you know, that's a source of dopamine too,

1:24:03.960 --> 1:24:06.160
 when we're honest and we disclose

1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:08.360
 and that you think people are going to run away from you

1:24:08.360 --> 1:24:10.480
 if you tell them about all like your weird neuroses,

1:24:10.480 --> 1:24:11.840
 but really they don't.

1:24:11.840 --> 1:24:13.160
 What they're like is, oh, thank God,

1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:14.920
 I'm not the only one, right?

1:24:14.920 --> 1:24:16.120
 Well, what I love about,

1:24:16.120 --> 1:24:17.780
 I love many things about your book.

1:24:17.780 --> 1:24:19.280
 I read it in one sweep.

1:24:19.280 --> 1:24:20.120
 Oh, thank you.

1:24:20.120 --> 1:24:25.120
 And I was like, wow, is I was pleasantly surprised,

1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:29.480
 but I was like, wow, she's really opening up in this book

1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:30.680
 from the very beginning.

1:24:31.680 --> 1:24:33.960
 And I don't want to give it away,

1:24:33.960 --> 1:24:38.600
 but it's, yeah, you're very open where it's appropriate.

1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:43.600
 And also I think that this question about truth telling,

1:24:44.200 --> 1:24:47.640
 I always think about like, tell the truth,

1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:50.240
 be, you know, a hundred percent about the truth,

1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:52.840
 but there's also this element about,

1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:57.280
 do you report previous lies, right?

1:24:57.280 --> 1:24:59.600
 Like, what about prior behavior?

1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:01.040
 And I'm fascinated by this,

1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:03.460
 because to me, telling the truth has many facets,

1:25:03.460 --> 1:25:08.000
 but the three sides of this thing in my mind are,

1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.800
 one is reporting everything accurately.

1:25:10.800 --> 1:25:12.560
 The other is what do you withhold,

1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:14.300
 what do you not withhold, right?

1:25:14.300 --> 1:25:15.920
 Because some people will say,

1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:17.760
 tell the truth or at least don't lie.

1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:18.600
 That's sort of a-

1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:20.000
 Lies of omission.

1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:23.560
 That's a lies of omission, lies of omission.

1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:28.040
 And then there's the, what I have to assume for most people

1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:31.460
 is a small to enormous batch of things

1:25:31.460 --> 1:25:33.640
 that they lied about in the past

1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:36.300
 that still thread into the future.

1:25:36.300 --> 1:25:38.640
 So how important is it for the addict

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:41.460
 or the every person really to,

1:25:41.460 --> 1:25:43.260
 because it sounds like cultivating the circuitry

1:25:43.260 --> 1:25:45.240
 between prefrontal cortex and the dopamine system

1:25:45.240 --> 1:25:46.980
 would be great for anybody,

1:25:46.980 --> 1:25:49.140
 since we're all addicts, everyone should do it.

1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:50.480
 But in all seriousness,

1:25:50.480 --> 1:25:53.320
 it sounds like a good thing for everybody to do.

1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:58.320
 How much work needs to be done on all the priors,

1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:00.760
 all the stuff we've hidden?

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.680
 I mean, not me, but all the stuff that everybody else

1:26:04.680 --> 1:26:05.520
 has hidden.

1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:10.520
 Yeah, so the steps of the 12 steps of Alcoholics Anonymous,

1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:17.620
 a good number of those steps are about that very thing,

1:26:17.620 --> 1:26:20.880
 the past, the ways that we've harmed people in the past.

1:26:20.880 --> 1:26:25.640
 And the fourth step is about making amends

1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.320
 by admitting the ways in which that we've contributed

1:26:31.240 --> 1:26:33.600
 to harming others.

1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:36.540
 And it is a really big piece of recovery.

1:26:36.540 --> 1:26:39.880
 So how important, so for people with addiction,

1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:43.120
 it's really, really important to go back and make amends.

1:26:43.120 --> 1:26:48.120
 And the key idea there is you just go back

1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:52.440
 and you apologize and you don't have to get

1:26:52.440 --> 1:26:53.880
 any particular kind of response

1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:55.440
 or you don't need to be forgiven.

1:26:55.440 --> 1:27:00.440
 It's the act itself of apologizing about the ways

1:27:00.540 --> 1:27:04.700
 in which we've harmed or lied to people in the past

1:27:04.700 --> 1:27:08.400
 that is cathartic and renewing and allows us

1:27:08.400 --> 1:27:11.740
 to kind of shed this skin and be new in our lives

1:27:11.740 --> 1:27:16.560
 and begin again, sort of absolved of past sins, so to speak.

1:27:16.560 --> 1:27:19.400
 So it is really important.

1:27:20.500 --> 1:27:23.100
 Are there situations when it's maybe not a good idea

1:27:23.100 --> 1:27:26.260
 because of that person or the nature?

1:27:26.260 --> 1:27:28.660
 Sure, there are always gonna be,

1:27:28.660 --> 1:27:30.100
 it doesn't have to be like,

1:27:30.100 --> 1:27:32.440
 we're talking about not like Kant's idea about like,

1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:36.180
 never lie, but robbers in your house and you're stowaway.

1:27:36.180 --> 1:27:37.220
 You can't lie even about that.

1:27:37.220 --> 1:27:39.580
 It's like, no, there are probably situations where-

1:27:39.580 --> 1:27:43.060
 Absolutely, for sake of other people's safety,

1:27:43.060 --> 1:27:44.500
 children's safety, sure.

1:27:44.500 --> 1:27:46.940
 I mean, you can think of a million scenarios,

1:27:46.940 --> 1:27:51.540
 but in general, when we're taking stock,

1:27:51.540 --> 1:27:52.600
 because I don't know about you,

1:27:52.600 --> 1:27:55.080
 but I have a lot of regrets and guilt

1:27:55.080 --> 1:27:57.420
 about a lot of things in my life

1:28:00.260 --> 1:28:02.340
 and they kind of haunt me.

1:28:02.340 --> 1:28:05.100
 It's meant to all have nightmares, right?

1:28:05.100 --> 1:28:07.020
 And I think that's true for most people.

1:28:07.020 --> 1:28:08.640
 I mean, I occasionally will meet somebody who's like,

1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:09.860
 I don't have any regrets about it.

1:28:09.860 --> 1:28:14.500
 I'm like, wow, I cannot relate to that at all.

1:28:16.060 --> 1:28:20.180
 So this idea of catharsis and well,

1:28:20.180 --> 1:28:21.100
 I mean, in the 12 steps,

1:28:21.100 --> 1:28:23.580
 it's telling God or your higher power,

1:28:23.580 --> 1:28:25.260
 telling another human being

1:28:25.260 --> 1:28:26.900
 the ways in which you've wronged others,

1:28:26.900 --> 1:28:28.820
 considering your own character defects

1:28:28.820 --> 1:28:29.900
 and how those have contributed.

1:28:29.900 --> 1:28:31.540
 To me, that's a really important piece

1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:35.020
 and something that we don't do enough in our current culture,

1:28:35.020 --> 1:28:36.540
 especially in psychiatry, frankly,

1:28:36.540 --> 1:28:39.220
 where there's a lot of eternally empathizing

1:28:39.220 --> 1:28:41.940
 with patients, but not a whole lot of likes going,

1:28:41.940 --> 1:28:44.300
 well, you know, actually you kind of messed that up

1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:47.600
 or like that was really bad on you, you know?

1:28:47.600 --> 1:28:50.540
 And in my work, I don't necessarily use that language,

1:28:50.540 --> 1:28:52.860
 but patients may say like,

1:28:52.860 --> 1:28:55.340
 I really feel badly about this thing.

1:28:55.340 --> 1:28:57.340
 I'll be like, yeah, I get it.

1:28:57.340 --> 1:28:59.100
 I understand that you feel.

1:28:59.100 --> 1:29:01.940
 Guilt is a, there's a circuit for that too.

1:29:01.940 --> 1:29:04.360
 Right, and it's important, right?

1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.500
 And it's also important to recovery

1:29:07.500 --> 1:29:09.380
 and to not becoming addicted,

1:29:09.380 --> 1:29:12.780
 experiencing a certain amount of appropriate shame

1:29:12.780 --> 1:29:14.700
 for things that we have done

1:29:14.700 --> 1:29:18.660
 and feeling the pain that comes with shame,

1:29:18.660 --> 1:29:21.180
 which is an incredibly painful emotion, right?

1:29:21.180 --> 1:29:22.140
 And I think that may be the one

1:29:22.140 --> 1:29:24.200
 that we all try to avoid more than any other

1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:27.580
 is like that shame of not being liked

1:29:27.580 --> 1:29:29.700
 or not being accepted or not being celebrated.

1:29:29.700 --> 1:29:32.900
 Or that the thing that we did is really despicable.

1:29:32.900 --> 1:29:34.220
 Right, it's really, yeah, like,

1:29:34.220 --> 1:29:36.740
 oh my God, I did that horrible thing, right, right.

1:29:36.740 --> 1:29:39.300
 And then, so, I mean, I've done horrible things

1:29:39.300 --> 1:29:41.760
 that I haven't gone back and said,

1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:43.180
 I did this horrible thing,

1:29:43.180 --> 1:29:45.580
 but maybe I've tried to pay it forward.

1:29:45.580 --> 1:29:47.940
 Like I've told my kids, you know, when I was younger,

1:29:47.940 --> 1:29:50.940
 I did this horrible thing and it still haunts me.

1:29:50.940 --> 1:29:54.100
 So if you're ever tempted to do something like what I did,

1:29:54.100 --> 1:29:55.980
 you might think about my situation.

1:29:55.980 --> 1:29:57.780
 So, you know, some kind of way,

1:29:57.780 --> 1:30:00.620
 but I think wrestling with that is important.

1:30:00.620 --> 1:30:03.160
 I think it's a really important element to all this.

1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:06.500
 And there's not, I love that there's neuroscience

1:30:06.500 --> 1:30:09.660
 being done on truth-telling and the value of truth-telling.

1:30:09.660 --> 1:30:14.660
 I think if I were to predict a new and truly exciting area

1:30:15.820 --> 1:30:17.540
 that people are going to be really curious about

1:30:17.540 --> 1:30:20.540
 and in this huge sphere we call neuroscience,

1:30:20.540 --> 1:30:22.840
 I hope they'll continue to do more work.

1:30:22.840 --> 1:30:24.240
 Also speaks, I'm so glad to hear

1:30:24.240 --> 1:30:26.340
 that's happening here at Stanford.

1:30:26.340 --> 1:30:30.020
 No, that's, well, the literature that I look at

1:30:30.020 --> 1:30:33.820
 isn't Stanford work, but there's work.

1:30:33.820 --> 1:30:35.380
 There might be people at Stanford.

1:30:35.380 --> 1:30:37.140
 Regardless of where it's happening,

1:30:37.140 --> 1:30:39.660
 more of that and all the rest, please.

1:30:40.580 --> 1:30:44.540
 I want to ask you about using drugs to treat drug addiction.

1:30:45.500 --> 1:30:47.560
 These days, there's a growing interest

1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:50.020
 or at least discussion about Ibogaine,

1:30:50.020 --> 1:30:52.060
 people going down, going out of country,

1:30:52.060 --> 1:30:55.180
 because I think it's still illegal here or is illegal here,

1:30:55.180 --> 1:30:57.140
 going out of country to, I don't know,

1:30:57.140 --> 1:31:00.940
 either inject it or smoke it or whatever it is,

1:31:00.940 --> 1:31:04.860
 or people going and doing ayahuasca journeys or MDMA,

1:31:04.860 --> 1:31:07.500
 which is still an illegal drug in this country,

1:31:07.500 --> 1:31:08.540
 but there are clinical trials.

1:31:08.540 --> 1:31:11.740
 There are people on this campus doing experimental studies.

1:31:11.740 --> 1:31:12.820
 I don't know of clinical trials,

1:31:12.820 --> 1:31:16.060
 but at Johns Hopkins there are clinical trials, et cetera.

1:31:16.060 --> 1:31:19.340
 So this is a vast area, right?

1:31:19.340 --> 1:31:21.120
 Different chemistries for different drugs

1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:22.140
 and different purposes,

1:31:22.140 --> 1:31:25.340
 but the rationale, as I understand it,

1:31:25.340 --> 1:31:29.320
 is take people who are in a pattern of addiction,

1:31:30.300 --> 1:31:33.620
 launch them into a experience

1:31:33.620 --> 1:31:35.760
 that's also chemical and extreme,

1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:40.760
 often of the extreme serotonin and or extreme dopamine type.

1:31:40.780 --> 1:31:44.180
 So MDMA, ecstasy, for instance, tons of serotonin dumped,

1:31:44.180 --> 1:31:47.000
 tons of dopamine dumped, how neurotoxic,

1:31:47.000 --> 1:31:49.080
 if neurotoxic, debatable, et cetera, et cetera,

1:31:49.080 --> 1:31:52.880
 not a topic for now, but a lot.

1:31:52.880 --> 1:31:55.360
 And then somehow that extreme experience

1:31:55.360 --> 1:31:59.140
 wrapped inside of a supported network in there,

1:31:59.140 --> 1:32:00.980
 whether or not there's just someone there

1:32:00.980 --> 1:32:02.980
 or whether or not they're actively working through something

1:32:02.980 --> 1:32:07.540
 with the patient, is supposed to eject the person

1:32:07.540 --> 1:32:12.540
 into a life where drug use isn't as much of interest.

1:32:14.180 --> 1:32:17.940
 This violates, at a rash, purely rational level,

1:32:17.940 --> 1:32:20.060
 this violates everything we've talked about

1:32:20.060 --> 1:32:21.840
 in terms of dopamine biology.

1:32:21.840 --> 1:32:25.680
 It would, if this arrangement is the way I described it,

1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:30.140
 cause more addiction, is anything but a dopamine fast,

1:32:30.140 --> 1:32:31.600
 it's a dopamine feast.

1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:36.400
 So we hear about successful transitions through this,

1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:39.780
 at least anecdotally, and maybe some clinical say,

1:32:39.780 --> 1:32:44.200
 what is going on, what is going on?

1:32:44.200 --> 1:32:45.800
 It doesn't make any sense to me.

1:32:48.200 --> 1:32:49.040
 Yeah.

1:32:49.040 --> 1:32:52.480
 Yeah, so I think it's good that you're skeptical.

1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:54.740
 I think we all should be skeptical.

1:32:54.740 --> 1:32:59.740
 Having said that, there are clinical studies showing,

1:32:59.740 --> 1:33:03.680
 and these are small studies and they're short duration,

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:07.500
 small number of subjects, but taking people, for example,

1:33:07.500 --> 1:33:11.220
 who are addicted to alcohol and then having them

1:33:11.220 --> 1:33:14.100
 have this, let's say, psychedelic experience

1:33:14.100 --> 1:33:16.140
 in a very controlled setting.

1:33:16.140 --> 1:33:18.420
 So either typically it's a high dose psilocybin

1:33:18.420 --> 1:33:22.940
 or three dose, as I saw it for the MAP study of MDMA,

1:33:22.940 --> 1:33:23.780
 of ecstasy.

1:33:23.780 --> 1:33:27.160
 Those seem to be the kind of bread and butter

1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:28.500
 of this kind of work.

1:33:28.500 --> 1:33:31.060
 But the thing to really keep in mind is that

1:33:31.060 --> 1:33:36.060
 this is completely interwoven with regular psychotherapy

1:33:36.380 --> 1:33:39.380
 and that these are highly selected individuals.

1:33:39.380 --> 1:33:40.300
 And clinical trials.

1:33:40.300 --> 1:33:41.140
 Right, right.

1:33:41.140 --> 1:33:42.340
 We're referring to legal clinical trials.

1:33:42.340 --> 1:33:43.180
 Right, right.

1:33:44.300 --> 1:33:48.760
 And so I think the metaphor that helps me think about this

1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:51.500
 is there are many ways to the top of the mountain

1:33:51.500 --> 1:33:54.120
 and these are sort of like taking the gondola

1:33:54.120 --> 1:33:55.980
 instead of walking up.

1:33:55.980 --> 1:33:59.660
 It's sort of, instead of doing like a year of psychoanalysis

1:33:59.660 --> 1:34:01.420
 where you're sitting on the couch every week,

1:34:01.420 --> 1:34:05.260
 reflecting on your life, it's a condensed version

1:34:05.260 --> 1:34:09.380
 of psychoanalysis or psychotherapy plus, you know, MDMA,

1:34:09.380 --> 1:34:10.900
 which gets you there faster.

1:34:10.900 --> 1:34:13.540
 Creates the intimacy presumably because of this.

1:34:13.540 --> 1:34:16.420
 Well, I think the main thing that happens

1:34:16.420 --> 1:34:21.020
 when it's beneficial is it just allows the person

1:34:21.020 --> 1:34:23.780
 to get outside of their own head

1:34:23.780 --> 1:34:28.580
 and look at their lives on a much broader sweep

1:34:28.580 --> 1:34:33.580
 and to consider themselves not mired in the, you know,

1:34:33.780 --> 1:34:37.180
 quotidian sort of details of their life,

1:34:37.180 --> 1:34:42.180
 but rather as a human on the large planet earth

1:34:42.340 --> 1:34:43.940
 in the vast universe.

1:34:43.940 --> 1:34:47.900
 So I think it takes, it's like when it works,

1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:50.260
 it's a transformational experience

1:34:50.260 --> 1:34:54.800
 because it gives the person another lens

1:34:54.800 --> 1:34:57.820
 through which to view their life, their lives,

1:34:57.820 --> 1:35:02.020
 which I think for some people is positive and powerful

1:35:02.020 --> 1:35:04.460
 because they can come back from that and be like,

1:35:04.460 --> 1:35:08.340
 oh my gosh, I care about my family

1:35:08.340 --> 1:35:10.900
 and I want X, Y, or Z for them

1:35:10.900 --> 1:35:12.700
 and I realize that my continuing to drink

1:35:12.700 --> 1:35:15.380
 is not going to, you know, achieve that.

1:35:15.380 --> 1:35:20.020
 So it's almost like a spiritual or values-based.

1:35:20.020 --> 1:35:21.860
 So I think it can be very powerful,

1:35:21.860 --> 1:35:25.620
 but having said that, I truly am quite skeptical

1:35:25.620 --> 1:35:29.180
 because, you know, addiction is a chronic relapsing

1:35:29.180 --> 1:35:30.120
 and remitting problem.

1:35:30.120 --> 1:35:32.340
 It's hard for me to imagine that there's something

1:35:32.340 --> 1:35:34.640
 that works very quickly short-term

1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:37.100
 that's going to work for a disease

1:35:37.100 --> 1:35:38.980
 that's really long lasting.

1:35:38.980 --> 1:35:40.580
 Yeah, the two addicts I know

1:35:40.580 --> 1:35:43.460
 that did MDMA-assisted psychotherapy

1:35:43.460 --> 1:35:46.660
 as part of this thing both got worse.

1:35:46.660 --> 1:35:48.240
 Yeah.

1:35:48.240 --> 1:35:51.720
 But the people I know who had severe trauma,

1:35:51.720 --> 1:35:53.900
 who did this, who took this approach,

1:35:53.900 --> 1:35:55.180
 seemed to be doing better.

1:35:55.180 --> 1:35:56.020
 Okay, interesting.

1:35:56.020 --> 1:36:00.540
 And so I think that the discussion as we hear it now

1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:03.740
 is just sort of psychedelics, which is a huge category

1:36:03.740 --> 1:36:05.540
 that includes many different drugs

1:36:05.540 --> 1:36:07.240
 and compounds with different effects.

1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:11.460
 And we hear about trauma and addiction lumped together

1:36:11.460 --> 1:36:14.900
 and I think that I'm a splitter, not a lumper,

1:36:14.900 --> 1:36:19.900
 as we say in science, and I think it's going to be important

1:36:20.880 --> 1:36:25.360
 for people to know that this is definitely not

1:36:25.360 --> 1:36:28.200
 a one-size-fits-all kind of thing,

1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:30.140
 but it sounds like it may have some utility

1:36:30.140 --> 1:36:31.660
 under certain conditions.

1:36:31.660 --> 1:36:32.820
 Yeah, I think so.

1:36:32.820 --> 1:36:35.340
 I think I'm trying to be very open-minded

1:36:35.340 --> 1:36:38.420
 about its potential utility for certain individuals,

1:36:38.420 --> 1:36:40.400
 but I can tell you in my clinical work,

1:36:40.400 --> 1:36:43.940
 what is a very concerning unintended consequence

1:36:43.940 --> 1:36:47.300
 of this narrative is I have a lot of people

1:36:47.300 --> 1:36:49.620
 who are looking for some kind of spiritual awakening

1:36:49.620 --> 1:36:52.060
 who on their own, not in the context

1:36:52.060 --> 1:36:55.060
 of any kind of therapeutic psychological work,

1:36:55.060 --> 1:37:00.060
 microdose or wanna try psilocybin or MDMA

1:37:00.060 --> 1:37:02.100
 with a friend or wherever so they can have

1:37:02.100 --> 1:37:04.500
 this spiritual experience that they can figure out

1:37:04.500 --> 1:37:06.620
 their lives, that's a disaster

1:37:06.620 --> 1:37:09.180
 and almost never works out well.

1:37:09.180 --> 1:37:11.200
 And I've then had people who literally,

1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:14.460
 supposedly you can't get addicted to psychedelics

1:37:14.460 --> 1:37:16.460
 because something with the biochemistry,

1:37:16.460 --> 1:37:17.460
 which I don't fully understand

1:37:17.460 --> 1:37:18.900
 because it doesn't make any sense to me,

1:37:18.900 --> 1:37:22.120
 but I have patients clinically who definitely are addicted

1:37:22.120 --> 1:37:24.840
 to MDMA, to microdosing.

1:37:24.840 --> 1:37:27.220
 So that's very concerning to me

1:37:27.220 --> 1:37:30.080
 because Pollan's, How to Change Your Mind,

1:37:31.820 --> 1:37:34.580
 I respect that work, but on the other hand,

1:37:34.580 --> 1:37:35.780
 it's penetrated the culture.

1:37:35.780 --> 1:37:36.620
 Michael Pollan's book.

1:37:36.620 --> 1:37:37.460
 Yeah, yeah.

1:37:37.460 --> 1:37:39.120
 Well, and I don't know him,

1:37:39.120 --> 1:37:43.220
 and so I don't have a problem taking a stance.

1:37:43.220 --> 1:37:47.020
 So I'll just say my stance on that is the narrative

1:37:47.020 --> 1:37:52.020
 of popular authors can expand and wick out so fast

1:37:52.620 --> 1:37:54.380
 that pretty soon people are essentially

1:37:54.380 --> 1:37:56.820
 taking their mental health into their own hands.

1:37:56.820 --> 1:38:00.920
 And I actually have great optimism for this business

1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:05.920
 of clinical use of psychedelics, including MDMA.

1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:08.720
 Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins

1:38:08.720 --> 1:38:10.640
 is doing fabulous work on this.

1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:13.800
 And there are others too, of course,

1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:16.000
 but those are controlled settings.

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:17.960
 And the pharmacology is being tuned up.

1:38:17.960 --> 1:38:20.480
 And one thing that I think is coming,

1:38:20.480 --> 1:38:22.620
 there are several papers published recently

1:38:22.620 --> 1:38:25.680
 in great journals like Nature and Science, et cetera,

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:30.120
 where there are scientists who are removing

1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:33.240
 the hallucinogenic components of these drugs

1:38:33.240 --> 1:38:38.240
 and finding that they still have the antidepressant effects.

1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:42.540
 And so the experience of a psychedelic

1:38:42.540 --> 1:38:45.000
 and the long-term effects of the psychedelic

1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.480
 might actually be dissociable.

1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:50.480
 And so I, again, and I'm always careful to say

1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:53.280
 I'm neither for something or against it.

1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:58.280
 I just think that treading carefully is what's important.

1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:00.120
 I agree with you.

1:39:00.120 --> 1:39:03.320
 And I can just tell you that the downstream effect

1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:08.320
 for the average person, many of whom present in our clinic,

1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:12.680
 is that they've misconstrued the data

1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:16.380
 on the use of psychedelics for mental health conditions

1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:19.400
 to this idea that they're safe

1:39:19.400 --> 1:39:21.560
 or that anybody can take them in any circumstance

1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:23.440
 and have this kind of awakening.

1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:26.500
 And that's not what the data show, right?

1:39:26.500 --> 1:39:30.040
 The data are these highly controlled settings.

1:39:30.040 --> 1:39:32.440
 You know, carefully selected patients.

1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:34.740
 So that's my worry, you know.

1:39:34.740 --> 1:39:35.580
 Sure.

1:39:35.580 --> 1:39:38.000
 And I'm going to be sitting down with Matthew Johnson

1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.040
 at some point, and we'll discuss this.

1:39:40.040 --> 1:39:45.040
 And I think that that care and that cocoon

1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:49.440
 of real clinical care does seem to be an important component.

1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:50.880
 Oh, well, I'm glad we could touch on it.

1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:53.800
 And, you know, I'm sure I'll get a bunch of comments

1:39:53.800 --> 1:39:58.280
 telling me that, you know, but I think it is important

1:39:58.280 --> 1:40:01.360
 to explore things from all sides, and that's what we do

1:40:01.360 --> 1:40:02.200
 as scientists.

1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:05.600
 And if Michael Pollan wants to chat, we can do that too.

1:40:05.600 --> 1:40:06.440
 That's fine.

1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:08.840
 I very much enjoyed the book, actually.

1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:12.200
 But I think that people run with ideas.

1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:13.040
 That's right.

1:40:13.040 --> 1:40:14.520
 They don't walk with them, they sprint.

1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:16.160
 Right, yeah.

1:40:16.160 --> 1:40:18.960
 There are a couple other things I just want to touch on,

1:40:19.860 --> 1:40:21.960
 but they all relate to social media.

1:40:21.960 --> 1:40:22.800
 Okay.

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:25.200
 You were featured in The Social Dilemma.

1:40:25.200 --> 1:40:26.280
 It was a powerful movie.

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:28.280
 I think many people avoided seeing that movie

1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:32.120
 because it reflects back on us just how addicted we all are

1:40:32.120 --> 1:40:33.960
 and how manipulated we all are.

1:40:33.960 --> 1:40:34.800
 Yes.

1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:37.680
 But it doesn't seem to have changed behavior much.

1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:41.560
 I have to say that the movie changed my understanding

1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:44.500
 and my perception, but not my behavior too much.

1:40:46.420 --> 1:40:48.640
 If we look at addiction as a maladaptive thing,

1:40:48.640 --> 1:40:50.660
 something that's making our lives worse

1:40:50.660 --> 1:40:54.860
 or us less functional at work and in relationships,

1:40:54.860 --> 1:40:57.120
 I could imagine a version of social media

1:40:57.120 --> 1:40:59.780
 where it's making me more connected.

1:40:59.780 --> 1:41:01.620
 I mean, this is a podcast after all.

1:41:01.620 --> 1:41:02.760
 I post videos.

1:41:02.760 --> 1:41:04.040
 This will show up on YouTube

1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:08.020
 and elements of it on Instagram as well.

1:41:08.020 --> 1:41:12.400
 So much like sugar or other things,

1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:15.220
 I have to imagine that we need to regulate,

1:41:15.220 --> 1:41:18.360
 not necessarily eliminate this behavior.

1:41:18.360 --> 1:41:20.720
 So I want to talk about what that looks like.

1:41:20.720 --> 1:41:23.720
 And I want to talk about what you've referred to

1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:26.920
 as this narcissistic preoccupation

1:41:26.920 --> 1:41:28.760
 that social media is creating,

1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:33.540
 that we are all far more keenly aware of how we look

1:41:33.540 --> 1:41:36.860
 and how we sound and how we are being perceived

1:41:36.860 --> 1:41:39.800
 than we were 10 years ago.

1:41:39.800 --> 1:41:40.640
 Right.

1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:42.420
 So first of all, social media,

1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:46.000
 how addicting is it really?

1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:50.300
 And what is healthy social media behavior?

1:41:50.300 --> 1:41:55.300
 So the first message I would want to get across

1:41:56.500 --> 1:42:00.140
 about social media is that it really is a drug

1:42:00.140 --> 1:42:02.460
 and it's engineered to be a drug.

1:42:02.460 --> 1:42:07.460
 And it's based on potency, quantity, variety,

1:42:07.940 --> 1:42:10.180
 the bottomless bowls, the likes,

1:42:10.180 --> 1:42:12.780
 the way that it's enumerated, all of that,

1:42:12.780 --> 1:42:16.180
 which doesn't mean that we can't use it,

1:42:16.180 --> 1:42:19.460
 but we need to be very thoughtful about the way we use it,

1:42:19.460 --> 1:42:20.820
 just like we need to be thoughtful

1:42:20.820 --> 1:42:23.020
 about the way we use any drug.

1:42:24.740 --> 1:42:27.120
 And so that means with intention

1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:30.780
 and in advance planning our use, right,

1:42:30.780 --> 1:42:35.640
 and trying to use it as a really awesome tool

1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:38.220
 to potentially connect with other people

1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:43.020
 and not to be used by it or get lost in it.

1:42:43.020 --> 1:42:45.500
 And of course, people are going to come

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:49.520
 with different propensities for addiction to any drug.

1:42:49.520 --> 1:42:51.060
 And that's true for social media too.

1:42:51.060 --> 1:42:54.720
 Some people will have no problem using it in moderation

1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:56.420
 or using it in a way that's adaptive.

1:42:56.420 --> 1:43:00.260
 And other people will immediately get sucked in.

1:43:00.260 --> 1:43:02.020
 And the key thing about getting addicted

1:43:02.020 --> 1:43:05.300
 is when it's happening, nobody who's getting addicted

1:43:05.300 --> 1:43:06.500
 thinks they're getting addicted, right?

1:43:06.500 --> 1:43:07.380
 Let's face it.

1:43:07.380 --> 1:43:09.220
 It's only after the fact that we go,

1:43:09.220 --> 1:43:11.180
 whoops, what was that about?

1:43:11.180 --> 1:43:12.620
 Well, remember texting and driving?

1:43:12.620 --> 1:43:14.420
 There were all these books about texting and driving

1:43:14.420 --> 1:43:16.380
 how terrible it was.

1:43:16.380 --> 1:43:18.540
 Even the governments have largely given up.

1:43:18.540 --> 1:43:21.620
 You see these billboards, like don't text and drive

1:43:21.620 --> 1:43:24.600
 or any text can wait or not worth dying for,

1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:25.940
 but everybody's texting and driving.

1:43:25.940 --> 1:43:28.140
 Right, and if you look at young people today, teenagers,

1:43:28.140 --> 1:43:30.740
 I mean, they're basically cybernetically enhanced.

1:43:30.740 --> 1:43:32.460
 The phone is there.

1:43:32.460 --> 1:43:33.780
 It's like they're talking to you

1:43:33.780 --> 1:43:36.320
 and texting 12 friends at the same time.

1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:37.900
 And there's no stopping it.

1:43:37.900 --> 1:43:40.580
 I mean, the genie is out of the bottle.

1:43:40.580 --> 1:43:42.440
 We're not going back.

1:43:42.440 --> 1:43:47.440
 So we do need to figure out how to make this tool,

1:43:48.700 --> 1:43:51.140
 something that's gonna be good for us

1:43:51.140 --> 1:43:52.920
 and not ultimately harmful.

1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:55.180
 And I don't have all the answers

1:43:55.180 --> 1:43:57.540
 by any stretch of the imagination,

1:43:57.540 --> 1:44:01.220
 but I do think some of the wisdom that we have learned

1:44:01.220 --> 1:44:05.180
 from using other drugs also applies to social media,

1:44:05.180 --> 1:44:07.780
 which is to say that we have to, again,

1:44:07.780 --> 1:44:11.900
 put barriers in place that allow us to remain in control

1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:14.620
 of our use, which means not too much,

1:44:14.620 --> 1:44:17.740
 not too often, not too potent.

1:44:17.740 --> 1:44:19.460
 Do you think in going back to this idea

1:44:19.460 --> 1:44:23.420
 of the unit of the day being a good tractable unit,

1:44:23.420 --> 1:44:25.920
 a manageable unit of time for most people,

1:44:26.780 --> 1:44:27.860
 so you're saying in advance,

1:44:27.860 --> 1:44:30.900
 so allocating two hours in which you're going

1:44:30.900 --> 1:44:34.620
 to allow yourself to have free reign use of the phone

1:44:34.620 --> 1:44:35.940
 and all its apps and all its things,

1:44:35.940 --> 1:44:38.420
 or even more restricted than that,

1:44:38.420 --> 1:44:42.320
 meaning, okay, I'm only gonna allow myself 30 minutes a day

1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:46.700
 to post and comment, and then that's a closeout completely.

1:44:46.700 --> 1:44:49.180
 Yeah, so I think it depends on the person

1:44:49.180 --> 1:44:50.100
 and it's sort of a combination.

1:44:50.100 --> 1:44:51.860
 We talked earlier about having an itch

1:44:51.860 --> 1:44:53.540
 and scratching yourself at night.

1:44:53.540 --> 1:44:55.300
 We've gotten to a point with smartphones,

1:44:55.300 --> 1:44:56.880
 people are pulling them out

1:44:56.880 --> 1:44:59.260
 and they are utterly unconscious of doing so.

1:44:59.260 --> 1:45:02.000
 Pulling them out, a couple texts, a couple,

1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:02.840
 they don't know they're doing it.

1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:06.620
 I have a friend who works and delivers babies,

1:45:06.620 --> 1:45:11.620
 and many pregnant mothers won't actually deliver

1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:14.420
 without their phone in hand,

1:45:14.420 --> 1:45:15.720
 and this used to be the hand

1:45:15.720 --> 1:45:17.020
 that was connected to their spouse.

1:45:17.020 --> 1:45:20.940
 This may be a comment on spouses more than on phones,

1:45:20.940 --> 1:45:25.940
 but it sounds like it's kind of a security blanket.

1:45:27.020 --> 1:45:29.140
 Right, like a transitional object, yeah.

1:45:29.140 --> 1:45:33.660
 Actually, that reminds me, you've referred to the phone.

1:45:33.660 --> 1:45:36.780
 I think it's the phone, but maybe it's our online persona

1:45:36.780 --> 1:45:41.420
 or ourselves as we've become sort of infantile

1:45:41.420 --> 1:45:42.260
 in our need for it.

1:45:42.260 --> 1:45:44.020
 It's like a baby in a bottle.

1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:46.740
 And so I do wonder if we have regressed,

1:45:46.740 --> 1:45:48.540
 and I do think we've regressed a bit

1:45:49.560 --> 1:45:51.860
 in terms of our online behavior,

1:45:51.860 --> 1:45:53.980
 our inability to act like,

1:45:53.980 --> 1:45:55.400
 I always thought an adult was somebody

1:45:55.400 --> 1:45:56.820
 that couldn't control their behavior.

1:45:56.820 --> 1:45:58.420
 That's the difference between a baby and an adult.

1:45:58.420 --> 1:45:59.900
 You don't have to be a developmental neurobiologist

1:45:59.900 --> 1:46:01.720
 for very long to understand that a young organism

1:46:01.720 --> 1:46:04.440
 can't control its behavior and an older one can.

1:46:04.440 --> 1:46:07.980
 So to me, a mature organism, mature in years,

1:46:07.980 --> 1:46:10.440
 organism that can't control its behavior is a baby.

1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:13.440
 It's an immature version of itself.

1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:16.380
 And there's neuroscience to support that statement.

1:46:17.440 --> 1:46:19.740
 I look at my own behavior with the phone sometimes,

1:46:19.740 --> 1:46:23.120
 and I think, I'm a grown man.

1:46:23.120 --> 1:46:25.440
 Like, what is the problem here, right?

1:46:26.820 --> 1:46:28.220
 I don't eat baby food,

1:46:28.220 --> 1:46:31.580
 but I'm acting like a baby with the phone, all right?

1:46:31.580 --> 1:46:35.540
 In the sense that I'm reflexively picking it up.

1:46:35.540 --> 1:46:39.540
 I'm not being intentioned and deliberate with it.

1:46:39.540 --> 1:46:41.580
 Do I need a full 30 days, Anna?

1:46:41.580 --> 1:46:44.580
 So, yeah, as you know,

1:46:44.580 --> 1:46:47.140
 that's my recommended full 30 days to reset.

1:46:47.140 --> 1:46:50.900
 If you're severely addicted, I recommend the 30 days,

1:46:50.900 --> 1:46:54.020
 but if you're just a little bit addicted, like most of us,

1:46:54.020 --> 1:46:55.300
 you probably don't need 30 days.

1:46:55.300 --> 1:46:58.980
 In fact, a single day not only would be challenging,

1:46:58.980 --> 1:47:02.200
 but probably maybe sufficient.

1:47:02.200 --> 1:47:05.340
 My phone is off for substantial segments of the day.

1:47:05.340 --> 1:47:06.260
 Okay, that's great.

1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:07.980
 And it drives other people crazy.

1:47:07.980 --> 1:47:12.980
 People expect me to respond, but I don't care.

1:47:13.500 --> 1:47:14.340
 I really don't.

1:47:14.340 --> 1:47:16.860
 And I actually take a little bit of pleasure

1:47:16.860 --> 1:47:19.100
 in the fact that, well, because I think the point

1:47:19.100 --> 1:47:20.580
 I'm trying to make is the right one,

1:47:20.580 --> 1:47:23.980
 which is that it's not just right for me, but like why?

1:47:23.980 --> 1:47:28.780
 I don't see a clause on text messages or emails that say,

1:47:28.780 --> 1:47:32.340
 must be responded to within X amount of time or else.

1:47:34.340 --> 1:47:38.260
 So I take the liberty of replying when I'm able to.

1:47:38.260 --> 1:47:39.100
 Yeah, that's right.

1:47:39.100 --> 1:47:40.300
 Or want to.

1:47:40.300 --> 1:47:43.260
 Right, but which touches on one of the big challenges

1:47:43.260 --> 1:47:46.660
 about social media is that as more and more of us

1:47:46.660 --> 1:47:49.220
 are spending more and more time on social media,

1:47:49.220 --> 1:47:53.140
 we're divesting our libidinous energies, et cetera,

1:47:53.140 --> 1:47:55.260
 from real life interactions.

1:47:55.260 --> 1:47:59.460
 So that means even when we want to choose to not be online

1:47:59.460 --> 1:48:02.900
 connecting, we go outside and there's no there there, right?

1:48:02.900 --> 1:48:04.740
 There's nobody else there.

1:48:04.740 --> 1:48:07.820
 So I think our collective challenge,

1:48:07.820 --> 1:48:11.420
 and it should be our mission, is to make sure

1:48:11.420 --> 1:48:16.420
 that we are preserving and maintaining offline ways

1:48:16.780 --> 1:48:18.500
 to connect with each other.

1:48:18.500 --> 1:48:21.220
 Because if we don't do that, then we'll be very lonely,

1:48:21.220 --> 1:48:23.940
 right, if we were not online.

1:48:23.940 --> 1:48:27.940
 But if you have a tribe of folks that you can be with,

1:48:27.940 --> 1:48:31.660
 none of whom are on their phones while you're together

1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:32.940
 for that discrete amount of time,

1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:36.260
 then it's wonderful and liberating and nobody's distracted.

1:48:36.260 --> 1:48:38.940
 And I think that's really the key.

1:48:38.940 --> 1:48:41.860
 And I think young people are figuring that out.

1:48:41.860 --> 1:48:44.460
 They're trying to create these spaces or try to,

1:48:44.460 --> 1:48:47.220
 let's say instead of doing a dopamine fast by yourself,

1:48:47.220 --> 1:48:49.060
 do it with your friends, right?

1:48:49.060 --> 1:48:51.740
 Then there's the FOMO is less, the fear of missing out

1:48:51.740 --> 1:48:54.580
 because, oh, you're all doing the dopamine fast together.

1:48:54.580 --> 1:48:57.420
 So these are some of the tricks that we can come up with.

1:48:57.420 --> 1:48:58.260
 But-

1:48:58.260 --> 1:48:59.080
 I like that.

1:48:59.080 --> 1:48:59.920
 Yeah, okay, good.

1:48:59.920 --> 1:49:02.740
 I don't allow, I have a home gym and I love working out.

1:49:02.740 --> 1:49:04.500
 I just enjoy it and I always have.

1:49:04.500 --> 1:49:08.500
 And I don't allow my phone in my gym anymore.

1:49:08.500 --> 1:49:11.140
 And I live in an area where I don't get any reception

1:49:11.140 --> 1:49:13.020
 like two meters outside my door.

1:49:13.020 --> 1:49:15.180
 So all my dog walks now are just,

1:49:15.180 --> 1:49:16.620
 and they were boring as hell.

1:49:16.620 --> 1:49:18.140
 I also have a bulldog, he doesn't like to walk.

1:49:18.140 --> 1:49:19.380
 It's really slow.

1:49:19.380 --> 1:49:23.140
 And it was so boring for a while

1:49:23.140 --> 1:49:25.300
 because I was so used to taking calls while I walk

1:49:25.300 --> 1:49:26.460
 and it's super efficient.

1:49:26.460 --> 1:49:27.580
 Why wouldn't I do that?

1:49:28.580 --> 1:49:32.260
 The walks now are some of my favorite part of the day

1:49:32.260 --> 1:49:34.100
 because, and if the phone were,

1:49:34.100 --> 1:49:35.620
 if I were to get a call on one of those

1:49:35.620 --> 1:49:37.020
 and they brought reception to the area,

1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:38.700
 I would be very dismayed.

1:49:38.700 --> 1:49:39.820
 So I can attest to this.

1:49:39.820 --> 1:49:42.540
 And I don't think I'm a phone addict,

1:49:42.540 --> 1:49:46.820
 but I do put work into regulating my phone.

1:49:46.820 --> 1:49:48.080
 Yeah, so this is the key.

1:49:48.080 --> 1:49:50.220
 You have to, with intention,

1:49:50.220 --> 1:49:52.460
 prior to being in that situation,

1:49:52.460 --> 1:49:55.860
 think of literal physical and metacognitive barriers

1:49:55.860 --> 1:49:59.140
 that you can put between yourself and your phone

1:49:59.140 --> 1:50:00.860
 or whatever your drug is

1:50:00.860 --> 1:50:03.380
 to create these intentional spaces

1:50:03.380 --> 1:50:06.500
 where you're not constantly interrupting yourself,

1:50:06.500 --> 1:50:08.020
 essentially, and distracting yourself.

1:50:08.020 --> 1:50:09.580
 Because I really do think,

1:50:09.580 --> 1:50:12.820
 I think we talked just before we started with the interview,

1:50:12.820 --> 1:50:17.820
 we're losing the ability to have a sustained thought, right?

1:50:18.820 --> 1:50:20.220
 I mean, we get so far

1:50:20.220 --> 1:50:23.180
 and then you get to that point in the thought

1:50:23.180 --> 1:50:26.600
 where it's a little bit hard to know what's coming next.

1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:30.860
 And it's very easy to check your phone or check your email

1:50:30.860 --> 1:50:34.500
 or look something up on the internet.

1:50:34.500 --> 1:50:36.940
 And then you never get that opportunity

1:50:36.940 --> 1:50:38.580
 to finish that thought,

1:50:38.580 --> 1:50:41.140
 which is really the source of creative energy

1:50:41.140 --> 1:50:42.720
 and an original thought, right?

1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:44.580
 You're not just reacting to what's coming at you.

1:50:44.580 --> 1:50:46.620
 And something that could contribute to the world.

1:50:46.620 --> 1:50:48.020
 That's right.

1:50:48.020 --> 1:50:51.500
 I'm a big believer that you're either consuming

1:50:51.500 --> 1:50:53.660
 or you are creating.

1:50:53.660 --> 1:50:56.800
 And there is, I should mention, it's important.

1:50:56.800 --> 1:50:58.140
 I do believe in neutral time.

1:50:58.140 --> 1:50:59.340
 I think sleep is great.

1:50:59.340 --> 1:51:00.700
 I'm a big proponent of sleep

1:51:00.700 --> 1:51:02.540
 and I've talked a lot about it on the podcast.

1:51:02.540 --> 1:51:04.580
 I care a lot about sleep.

1:51:04.580 --> 1:51:06.040
 And not just for sake of performance.

1:51:06.040 --> 1:51:07.820
 I actually just really like sleep.

1:51:08.980 --> 1:51:12.580
 I think that being a constant consumer

1:51:12.580 --> 1:51:14.540
 of visual information

1:51:14.540 --> 1:51:16.860
 and information of all kinds can be a problem.

1:51:16.860 --> 1:51:18.980
 But there's some really great sources

1:51:18.980 --> 1:51:20.300
 of information on the internet.

1:51:20.300 --> 1:51:24.380
 And I certainly benefit from the fact

1:51:24.380 --> 1:51:26.120
 that those channels exist.

1:51:27.280 --> 1:51:29.200
 Narcissistic preoccupation.

1:51:30.140 --> 1:51:31.260
 Am I a narcissist?

1:51:32.980 --> 1:51:34.420
 First of all, there's healthy-

1:51:34.420 --> 1:51:36.820
 Or is the fact that I asked, does that take me out of,

1:51:36.820 --> 1:51:38.540
 would a narcissist ever ask that question?

1:51:38.540 --> 1:51:41.120
 Oh yes, a highly sophisticated narcissist

1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:41.960
 would know to do that.

1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:42.800
 I'm very sophisticated.

1:51:42.800 --> 1:51:46.940
 So there's healthy narcissism,

1:51:46.940 --> 1:51:50.360
 which means that we all invest our personal energies

1:51:50.360 --> 1:51:52.240
 into things that we care about.

1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:54.940
 And if our competence in that arena is threatened,

1:51:54.940 --> 1:51:57.300
 we would all experience a narcissistic injury

1:51:57.300 --> 1:51:59.360
 and that's normal and healthy.

1:52:00.740 --> 1:52:04.320
 But we are living in a narcissistic culture.

1:52:04.320 --> 1:52:05.600
 I mean, that's not news.

1:52:05.600 --> 1:52:08.780
 This preoccupation with individual achievement

1:52:08.780 --> 1:52:12.820
 and individual self-worth and individual self-confidence.

1:52:12.820 --> 1:52:17.820
 And I think all of that is just fueled by social media

1:52:17.860 --> 1:52:19.780
 where we're not just seeing ourselves,

1:52:19.780 --> 1:52:21.860
 but we're seeing people's reactions to ourselves

1:52:21.860 --> 1:52:24.740
 and every single thing we say or do,

1:52:24.740 --> 1:52:26.800
 we get likes and this and that.

1:52:26.800 --> 1:52:28.580
 It's really insidious.

1:52:28.580 --> 1:52:29.980
 And it contributes, I think,

1:52:29.980 --> 1:52:33.080
 ultimately to a lot of personal shame

1:52:33.080 --> 1:52:36.740
 because we're not really meant to be individuals

1:52:36.740 --> 1:52:38.380
 bouncing around in the universe.

1:52:38.380 --> 1:52:39.980
 We're social animals.

1:52:39.980 --> 1:52:42.960
 And we're probably generally happiest

1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:45.700
 even for natural contrarians among us

1:52:45.700 --> 1:52:48.180
 when we're part of a tribe, right?

1:52:48.180 --> 1:52:51.260
 And if we do too much to kind of separate ourselves

1:52:51.260 --> 1:52:56.260
 from that tribe, I think that the brain's natural

1:52:56.400 --> 1:52:59.120
 and instinctive corrective mechanism against that

1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:01.420
 is self-loathing and shame.

1:53:01.420 --> 1:53:06.180
 So it's so ironic because the culture tells us

1:53:06.180 --> 1:53:08.760
 if we just achieve more, we'll like ourselves more.

1:53:08.760 --> 1:53:11.180
 But the truth is actually the opposite

1:53:11.180 --> 1:53:14.000
 that I think when people get these pinnacles

1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:15.580
 of personal achievement,

1:53:15.580 --> 1:53:18.740
 you have things like the imposter syndrome or whatever.

1:53:18.740 --> 1:53:21.340
 Where you just, we're at Stanford

1:53:21.340 --> 1:53:23.660
 after a lot of high achievers here, right?

1:53:23.660 --> 1:53:26.660
 Some phenomenal, amazing people like yourself

1:53:26.660 --> 1:53:29.540
 and other colleagues of mine that just, I'm always in awe.

1:53:29.540 --> 1:53:30.580
 It's just amazing.

1:53:30.580 --> 1:53:32.220
 The mean has shifted so high.

1:53:32.220 --> 1:53:35.740
 And also people who have amazing paths to get here

1:53:35.740 --> 1:53:38.460
 coming from very little accomplishing so much.

1:53:38.460 --> 1:53:41.600
 But it's also the pressure, right?

1:53:42.820 --> 1:53:45.180
 The way that this career was described to me

1:53:45.180 --> 1:53:47.880
 the day I got my job was one colleague of mine,

1:53:47.880 --> 1:53:50.500
 the late Ben Barra said, welcome to schizophrenia

1:53:50.500 --> 1:53:52.780
 because you're never going to be able to complete anything

1:53:52.780 --> 1:53:53.940
 without getting interrupted.

1:53:53.940 --> 1:53:56.320
 That was partially true, although I've created buffers.

1:53:56.320 --> 1:53:59.900
 And the other one, very successful scientist,

1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:03.100
 a member of the National Academy, et cetera, said to me,

1:54:03.100 --> 1:54:05.260
 just remember it's pinball.

1:54:05.260 --> 1:54:06.740
 You never win.

1:54:06.740 --> 1:54:09.340
 The best you can do is just keep playing.

1:54:09.340 --> 1:54:13.820
 And I thought, wow, okay, okay.

1:54:13.820 --> 1:54:15.340
 And then you just go.

1:54:15.340 --> 1:54:18.540
 But I think that as we achieve more,

1:54:18.540 --> 1:54:21.700
 not just academics, of course, but as anyone achieves more,

1:54:21.700 --> 1:54:24.540
 there's the relishing and the accomplishment.

1:54:24.540 --> 1:54:26.780
 There's often the desire for more,

1:54:26.780 --> 1:54:28.560
 but there's also the pressure of,

1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:31.260
 well, now I have to do this for the next 30 years

1:54:31.260 --> 1:54:32.100
 even though I love it.

1:54:32.100 --> 1:54:34.720
 It's the pressure of, well, if the mountain is this high,

1:54:34.720 --> 1:54:37.140
 then how do I get here and here and here?

1:54:37.140 --> 1:54:38.620
 And then you start shoveling more dirt on

1:54:38.620 --> 1:54:39.520
 so you can keep climbing.

1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:41.180
 And it's a lot of work.

1:54:41.180 --> 1:54:44.540
 And I think that the perception of success

1:54:44.540 --> 1:54:48.100
 is that there's a roar of the crowd and you cruise.

1:54:48.100 --> 1:54:49.300
 You don't cruise.

1:54:49.300 --> 1:54:50.700
 They just give you more to do.

1:54:50.700 --> 1:54:52.580
 Or you give yourself more to do.

1:54:52.580 --> 1:54:56.620
 Well, what I think is, at least in my life experience,

1:54:56.620 --> 1:54:59.580
 and I've heard this from other people as well,

1:54:59.580 --> 1:55:03.020
 it's that prize that we're going for

1:55:03.020 --> 1:55:07.700
 that if we get it, is so unsatisfying.

1:55:07.700 --> 1:55:11.060
 And it's the prize that we never imagined

1:55:11.060 --> 1:55:13.920
 that we kind of go, well, how did that happen?

1:55:13.920 --> 1:55:16.540
 But gee, that feels good.

1:55:16.540 --> 1:55:18.380
 And so I'm very, what's the-

1:55:18.380 --> 1:55:20.740
 It's like a mirage in the one case.

1:55:20.740 --> 1:55:25.240
 And it's like a, yeah, it's on the one,

1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:28.140
 it's almost like dopamine can create these mirages

1:55:28.140 --> 1:55:30.060
 that there's some place there.

1:55:30.060 --> 1:55:30.900
 That's right.

1:55:30.900 --> 1:55:33.260
 If I just, it's that pot of gold, right?

1:55:33.260 --> 1:55:34.420
 Constant dopamine.

1:55:34.420 --> 1:55:36.500
 Right, right, that's right, that's right.

1:55:36.500 --> 1:55:39.180
 And I think this really, I think,

1:55:39.180 --> 1:55:41.900
 is related to our discussion earlier

1:55:41.900 --> 1:55:43.460
 about this taking it one day at a time

1:55:43.460 --> 1:55:46.800
 or paying attention to that 24-hour period

1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:48.580
 in your environment.

1:55:48.580 --> 1:55:50.860
 I am absolutely fascinated by the ways

1:55:50.860 --> 1:55:55.860
 in which we accumulate success when we do that,

1:55:56.180 --> 1:56:00.740
 totally independent of the desire for success.

1:56:00.740 --> 1:56:02.980
 It's really process-oriented.

1:56:02.980 --> 1:56:06.500
 It's like, where am I today?

1:56:06.500 --> 1:56:09.620
 How can I make today a good and meaningful day,

1:56:09.620 --> 1:56:14.620
 a little bit better or as good as some other days I've had?

1:56:14.740 --> 1:56:16.940
 Constantly tweaking and experimenting

1:56:16.940 --> 1:56:21.620
 with this experiment that we call our human existence.

1:56:21.620 --> 1:56:25.460
 And when we do that in a way that's authentic

1:56:25.460 --> 1:56:28.860
 and paying attention and value-driven,

1:56:28.860 --> 1:56:32.420
 whatever our values are informed by,

1:56:32.420 --> 1:56:34.780
 it is very, very interesting how those days,

1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:37.240
 again, accumulate and you find,

1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:40.000
 well, I guess I contributed something of value there,

1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:43.060
 but I wasn't trying to do that.

1:56:43.060 --> 1:56:44.620
 I think that's really,

1:56:44.620 --> 1:56:47.060
 I mean, what I'm so amazed by is like,

1:56:47.060 --> 1:56:48.980
 20 years ago when I went to Stanford Medical School,

1:56:48.980 --> 1:56:53.980
 25 years ago, I was happy to just be a good doctor.

1:56:55.180 --> 1:56:58.000
 I was like, I guess I'm just gonna try to figure out

1:56:58.000 --> 1:56:59.740
 how to be a good doctor and I'm here to learn that.

1:56:59.740 --> 1:57:02.140
 And now I see these medical students and they're wonderful.

1:57:02.140 --> 1:57:05.500
 They're brilliant and they're well-intentioned, all that.

1:57:05.500 --> 1:57:10.020
 But they're like, how can I write the great American novel,

1:57:10.020 --> 1:57:14.400
 do my startup, go to Africa, apply for that grant?

1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:15.520
 It's like, really?

1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:17.700
 I was just trying to learn how to be a doctor.

1:57:17.700 --> 1:57:20.700
 And as you say, it's a lot of pressure on them.

1:57:20.700 --> 1:57:24.660
 And it's also kind of a weird leapfrogging

1:57:24.660 --> 1:57:29.500
 of the real way to accomplish something.

1:57:29.500 --> 1:57:31.980
 Which isn't about like, oh, how can I accomplish something?

1:57:31.980 --> 1:57:36.940
 It's like, what can I do today that would be of service?

1:57:36.940 --> 1:57:39.980
 And then finding that of trying to be of service

1:57:41.060 --> 1:57:43.340
 and not really going for recognition

1:57:43.340 --> 1:57:46.180
 can sometimes lead to what people call success.

1:57:46.180 --> 1:57:47.900
 Although that wasn't what you were aiming for.

1:57:47.900 --> 1:57:49.220
 And it's all the more beautiful

1:57:49.220 --> 1:57:50.300
 when it's not what you're aiming for.

1:57:50.300 --> 1:57:52.500
 Oh, so much better, so much better.

1:57:52.500 --> 1:57:57.500
 I'm a big believer that when one can align their compulsion

1:57:58.860 --> 1:58:02.500
 with some greater good, a service to humanity

1:58:02.500 --> 1:58:05.300
 or the planet or animals, whatever it is,

1:58:05.300 --> 1:58:09.740
 that that's where the really good stuff emerges.

1:58:09.740 --> 1:58:11.700
 Because there's a lot of reciprocity there.

1:58:11.700 --> 1:58:14.900
 The world starts to, you're supporting the world

1:58:14.900 --> 1:58:16.340
 and then it starts to support you

1:58:16.340 --> 1:58:17.660
 in a way that feels very fluid.

1:58:17.660 --> 1:58:19.100
 And that comes back.

1:58:19.100 --> 1:58:22.160
 And I mean, that speaks to your generosity to me,

1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:24.260
 vis-a-vis my book.

1:58:24.260 --> 1:58:25.100
 And I have to say-

1:58:25.100 --> 1:58:26.140
 Well, I love the book.

1:58:26.140 --> 1:58:28.840
 There's like, we're not in a business deal, folks.

1:58:28.840 --> 1:58:31.680
 It's just purely that I heard Anna lecture in my course.

1:58:31.680 --> 1:58:33.140
 I wanted to learn more about dopamine.

1:58:33.140 --> 1:58:35.020
 She taught me, I asked her if she would come on the podcast.

1:58:35.020 --> 1:58:36.740
 Turned out, she wrote this amazing book.

1:58:36.740 --> 1:58:38.840
 She sent me a man's copy of the book.

1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:39.980
 I read it in one sweep.

1:58:39.980 --> 1:58:41.700
 It's incredible and I love it.

1:58:41.700 --> 1:58:45.260
 So just like the eight-year-old version of me,

1:58:45.260 --> 1:58:48.220
 now the 45 version of myself,

1:58:48.220 --> 1:58:50.500
 I can't stop blabbing about the things I love.

1:58:50.500 --> 1:58:52.520
 Well, it's awesome, but I have to say,

1:58:52.520 --> 1:58:56.700
 I have been surprised by your generosity.

1:58:56.700 --> 1:59:01.700
 It's not something I've encountered frequently at Stanford,

1:59:01.980 --> 1:59:03.140
 which is a wonderful place.

1:59:03.140 --> 1:59:08.140
 But there is a general sense that if I give away

1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:14.220
 to somebody else, I've lost something,

1:59:16.020 --> 1:59:18.300
 which is not the right way to think about it,

1:59:18.300 --> 1:59:21.580
 not how you are, and also not how the world works.

1:59:21.580 --> 1:59:24.200
 Because when we give away to other people,

1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:29.200
 we get back so much more, but it takes a long time

1:59:29.420 --> 1:59:31.940
 and it might not come through that path.

1:59:31.940 --> 1:59:34.940
 I never think about reciprocity.

1:59:34.940 --> 1:59:38.780
 But I was weaned by good advisors.

1:59:38.780 --> 1:59:39.980
 That's very nice.

1:59:39.980 --> 1:59:41.740
 I think I just sort of got drilled into me

1:59:41.740 --> 1:59:46.460
 that the more you give, the better your immediate life is.

1:59:46.460 --> 1:59:48.460
 But I also don't have a long-term vision.

1:59:51.460 --> 1:59:52.820
 I'm just excited about the book.

1:59:52.820 --> 1:59:55.340
 I'm excited that people are learning

1:59:55.340 --> 1:59:57.460
 about the brain and dopamine.

1:59:57.460 --> 2:00:00.440
 I have to admit, having grown up in neuroscience,

2:00:00.440 --> 2:00:02.980
 essentially, I did not understand that pleasure and pain

2:00:02.980 --> 2:00:05.340
 were orchestrated the way that they are.

2:00:05.340 --> 2:00:07.180
 I'm very mindful of it now.

2:00:08.020 --> 2:00:10.700
 And it's changed a number of my behaviors.

2:00:10.700 --> 2:00:12.620
 I know a number of people are going to have questions

2:00:12.620 --> 2:00:14.240
 and want to get in contact with you.

2:00:14.240 --> 2:00:16.180
 You are not on social media.

2:00:16.180 --> 2:00:17.060
 That's correct.

2:00:17.060 --> 2:00:17.900
 Yes.

2:00:17.900 --> 2:00:20.420
 You are true to your ideology.

2:00:20.420 --> 2:00:21.660
 That's great.

2:00:21.660 --> 2:00:22.940
 And the reason for that is just,

2:00:22.940 --> 2:00:25.080
 I wouldn't be able to control myself.

2:00:25.080 --> 2:00:26.900
 I mean, that really would be my drug.

2:00:26.900 --> 2:00:28.260
 People are my drug.

2:00:28.260 --> 2:00:31.860
 Intimacy is my drug, and I wouldn't be able to manage it.

2:00:31.860 --> 2:00:35.460
 And so it was just easier for me to not do it at all

2:00:35.460 --> 2:00:37.180
 rather than try to moderate it.

2:00:37.180 --> 2:00:39.580
 Well, the book, as you mentioned before

2:00:39.580 --> 2:00:42.260
 and as I can attest to, is it has a certain intimacy.

2:00:42.260 --> 2:00:43.780
 People get to know you through the book.

2:00:43.780 --> 2:00:46.260
 So definitely check out the book.

2:00:46.260 --> 2:00:48.800
 If you have questions about the book, et cetera,

2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:50.420
 you're welcome to send them my way.

2:00:50.420 --> 2:00:52.500
 I will buffer you from all those questions.

2:00:52.500 --> 2:00:53.500
 I'll filter them.

2:00:55.100 --> 2:00:57.960
 Anna, Dr. Lemke, I should be a formal,

2:00:57.960 --> 2:00:59.300
 forgive me, I've been referring to you

2:00:59.300 --> 2:01:01.500
 the whole way through because we're colleagues,

2:01:01.500 --> 2:01:04.580
 but thank you so much for sharing this information.

2:01:04.580 --> 2:01:07.780
 And I know I learned a ton and I know everyone else

2:01:07.780 --> 2:01:09.980
 is going to learn a lot more about addiction

2:01:09.980 --> 2:01:12.220
 and the good side of dopamine.

2:01:12.220 --> 2:01:13.420
 That's right.

2:01:13.420 --> 2:01:14.380
 Thank you for having me.

2:01:14.380 --> 2:01:17.140
 It's been really, really great to talk with you.

2:01:17.140 --> 2:01:18.540
 Great, thank you.

2:01:18.540 --> 2:01:20.120
 Thank you for joining me for my discussion

2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:21.500
 with Dr. Anna Lemke.

2:01:21.500 --> 2:01:23.780
 I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.

2:01:23.780 --> 2:01:26.100
 Please be sure to check out her new book,

2:01:26.100 --> 2:01:29.480
 Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence.

2:01:29.480 --> 2:01:31.420
 You can pre-order it on Amazon

2:01:31.420 --> 2:01:33.460
 or any places where books are sold.

2:01:33.460 --> 2:01:36.300
 It's an absolutely fascinating and engaging read

2:01:36.300 --> 2:01:38.780
 all about addiction and dopamine.

2:01:38.780 --> 2:01:41.540
