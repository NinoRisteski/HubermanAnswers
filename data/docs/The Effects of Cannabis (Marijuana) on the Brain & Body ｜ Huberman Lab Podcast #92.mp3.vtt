00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.340 --> 00:10.400
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.400 --> 00:13.340
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.340 --> 00:15.140
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.140 --> 00:17.140
 Today, we are discussing cannabis,

00:17.140 --> 00:19.460
 also referred to as marijuana.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.900
 Cannabis includes many different compounds

00:21.900 --> 00:24.960
 that have profound impact on the brain and body.

00:24.960 --> 00:27.740
 So while many of you have probably heard of THC,

00:27.740 --> 00:29.880
 there are also compounds in cannabis

00:29.880 --> 00:32.640
 such as CBD, and of course there are different types

00:32.640 --> 00:35.300
 or strains of cannabis, including sativa strains

00:35.300 --> 00:38.200
 and indica strains and hybrid strains.

00:38.200 --> 00:39.040
 And believe it or not,

00:39.040 --> 00:41.900
 nowadays there is also an entire literature,

00:41.900 --> 00:43.980
 meaning a scientific and medicinal literature

00:43.980 --> 00:46.160
 about type one, type two, and type three strains.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.000
 I'll explain what all of that is and how they work.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.240
 I'll talk about some of the medicinal applications

00:51.240 --> 00:52.720
 of different strains of cannabis

00:52.720 --> 00:54.840
 and combinations of cannabis strains,

00:54.840 --> 00:57.560
 as well as some of the potential health hazards

00:57.560 --> 00:59.240
 of cannabis use.

00:59.240 --> 01:01.400
 I want to emphasize that any discussion about cannabis

01:01.400 --> 01:03.160
 has to be framed within the context

01:03.160 --> 01:07.000
 that the legality of cannabis varies tremendously

01:07.000 --> 01:08.460
 depending on where you are in the world.

01:08.460 --> 01:11.120
 So depending on which country you're in

01:11.120 --> 01:12.440
 and even which state you're in

01:12.440 --> 01:14.760
 or which area within a country,

01:14.760 --> 01:17.400
 possessing and using and certainly selling cannabis

01:17.400 --> 01:20.440
 can be either highly illegal or entirely legal

01:20.440 --> 01:23.240
 or decriminalized or largely overlooked.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.400
 You of course are obligated to know

01:25.400 --> 01:27.760
 what those local laws are for you,

01:27.760 --> 01:30.000
 where you live and where you travel.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.600
 With that said, today's discussion really will include

01:33.600 --> 01:37.080
 a full picture as to where cannabis

01:37.080 --> 01:39.780
 and the various and even very specific compounds

01:39.780 --> 01:42.200
 within cannabis can be extremely useful

01:42.200 --> 01:44.160
 in the treatment of some ailments

01:44.160 --> 01:46.800
 and where certain compounds in cannabis

01:46.800 --> 01:50.200
 can be extremely dangerous for certain individuals to use,

01:50.200 --> 01:53.600
 in particular individuals that have pre-existing

01:53.600 --> 01:56.180
 genetic propensity for psychosis.

01:56.180 --> 01:57.900
 That theme is going to come up again and again,

01:57.900 --> 02:00.400
 but we are also going to talk about the role of cannabis

02:00.400 --> 02:02.720
 in anxiety, in depression,

02:02.720 --> 02:04.420
 both positive and negative effects.

02:04.420 --> 02:05.660
 We'll talk about sex differences

02:05.660 --> 02:08.120
 in terms of women versus men

02:08.120 --> 02:09.920
 and how they react differently to cannabis.

02:09.920 --> 02:11.500
 And I would be entirely remiss

02:11.500 --> 02:14.480
 if I didn't include a conversation about cannabis,

02:14.480 --> 02:17.800
 meaning THC, CBD, hybrid strains, et cetera,

02:17.800 --> 02:20.440
 in creativity and different modes of thinking.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.580
 Because as many of you probably know

02:22.580 --> 02:24.540
 or at least have heard about,

02:24.540 --> 02:27.240
 cannabis can impact the way that we think,

02:27.240 --> 02:29.440
 the types of memory systems we can access

02:29.440 --> 02:31.340
 and what's called convergent and divergent thinking,

02:31.340 --> 02:33.680
 which is one way of conceptualizing

02:33.680 --> 02:36.820
 what is commonly referred to as creativity.

02:36.820 --> 02:39.240
 So today's discussion is going to include

02:39.240 --> 02:40.420
 a lot of information,

02:40.420 --> 02:42.920
 but I promise to make it clear and accessible to all of you,

02:42.920 --> 02:43.920
 regardless of whether or not

02:43.920 --> 02:46.320
 you have a background in biology or not.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.360
 And today's discussion will also be quite nuanced.

02:49.360 --> 02:51.120
 You'll find me routinely reading

02:51.120 --> 02:53.300
 directly from specific research papers,

02:53.300 --> 02:56.660
 something that of course we always do on this podcast.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.200
 But today I'm really going to dig into

02:58.200 --> 03:01.420
 some of the finer points of the methodology in papers

03:01.420 --> 03:03.800
 and some of the statistics that were used

03:03.800 --> 03:06.640
 and the specific populations of people that were studied.

03:06.640 --> 03:07.880
 Because as it turns out,

03:07.880 --> 03:09.720
 there are instances that we will discuss

03:09.720 --> 03:11.440
 in which the use of cannabis

03:11.440 --> 03:14.160
 can be immensely beneficial to one group

03:14.160 --> 03:17.480
 and yet can be entirely detrimental to another group,

03:17.480 --> 03:19.360
 even at equivalent dosages

03:19.360 --> 03:21.560
 and depending on a number of different factors.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.760
 So we will discuss what those factors are.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.520
 Just to give you a brief overview

03:25.520 --> 03:28.520
 of the kind of structure I'm going to put on today's episode,

03:28.520 --> 03:31.400
 we will review, of course, cannabis and its various forms.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.520
 I'll talk about some of the biology,

03:32.520 --> 03:36.120
 but we are going to really drill into how dosage,

03:36.120 --> 03:39.880
 that is the concentration of THC relative to CBD,

03:39.880 --> 03:41.640
 impacts whether or not cannabis

03:41.640 --> 03:43.080
 is going to have one effect or another.

03:43.080 --> 03:46.280
 We will also talk about the frequency of use,

03:46.280 --> 03:49.040
 daily use, multiple times per day use,

03:49.040 --> 03:51.480
 weekly use or monthly or occasional use.

03:51.480 --> 03:53.600
 We will also talk about different professions

03:53.600 --> 03:55.800
 and how some people may have a little bit more leeway

03:55.800 --> 03:58.560
 in terms of whether or not they decide to use cannabis

03:58.560 --> 04:02.280
 or any of its various component chemical constituents,

04:02.280 --> 04:04.920
 that is CBD or THC, et cetera.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.680
 And for other professions,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.280
 it might be entirely inappropriate

04:08.280 --> 04:10.600
 because of the particular kinds of cognitive tasks

04:10.600 --> 04:12.080
 those professions demand.

04:12.080 --> 04:14.680
 We will also talk about genetic predisposition,

04:14.680 --> 04:16.760
 again, sex differences, hormone effects.

04:16.760 --> 04:17.860
 And I will also touch on

04:17.860 --> 04:20.200
 what I think is the most important variable

04:20.200 --> 04:22.580
 in determining whether or not cannabis

04:22.580 --> 04:24.920
 is right or wrong for you.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.160
 And that is your age at which you are considering

04:28.160 --> 04:31.200
 starting or continuing use or ceasing use.

04:31.200 --> 04:34.080
 What I can assure you is that by the end of today's podcast,

04:34.080 --> 04:37.360
 you will have a quite thorough understanding of cannabis,

04:37.360 --> 04:39.080
 how it works, what it does,

04:39.080 --> 04:40.920
 what its potential benefits can be,

04:40.920 --> 04:43.000
 what its potential hazards are,

04:43.000 --> 04:44.800
 and whether or not it's right for you

04:44.800 --> 04:45.960
 and the people that you know.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.040
 I'm excited to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

04:48.040 --> 04:49.920
 has now launched a premium channel.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.780
 The purpose of the premium channel is several fold.

04:51.780 --> 04:54.480
 First of all, I will be hosting regular AMAs,

04:54.480 --> 04:56.760
 Ask Me Anythings, where you can ask me anything,

04:56.760 --> 04:58.680
 and I will provide answers in depth

04:58.680 --> 05:00.440
 to your specific questions about science

05:00.440 --> 05:02.680
 and science-related tools for mental health,

05:02.680 --> 05:04.440
 physical health, and performance.

05:04.440 --> 05:06.760
 Now, there is a nominal cost to the premium channel.

05:06.760 --> 05:10.880
 It's $10 per month, or you can pay $100 for the entire year.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.160
 I should mention, however,

05:12.160 --> 05:13.800
 that a significant portion of the funds

05:13.800 --> 05:15.480
 raised through the premium channel

05:15.480 --> 05:17.840
 are going to support not just the Huberman Lab Podcast,

05:17.840 --> 05:21.480
 which we will continue to release every Monday on schedule,

05:21.480 --> 05:23.460
 of zero cost to all consumers,

05:23.460 --> 05:27.360
 content on mental health, physical health, and performance,

05:27.360 --> 05:29.920
 but proceeds from the premium channel

05:29.920 --> 05:31.840
 will also be used to fund research,

05:31.840 --> 05:33.880
 in particular, research done on human beings,

05:33.880 --> 05:35.960
 so not animal models, but on human beings,

05:35.960 --> 05:37.760
 which I think we all agree is a species

05:37.760 --> 05:39.960
 that we are most interested in,

05:39.960 --> 05:42.960
 and we are going to specifically fund research

05:42.960 --> 05:45.580
 that is aimed toward developing further protocols

05:45.580 --> 05:47.620
 for mental health, physical health, and performance,

05:47.620 --> 05:49.520
 and those protocols will be distributed

05:49.520 --> 05:51.940
 through all channels, not just the premium channel,

05:51.940 --> 05:53.640
 but through all channels, Huberman Lab Podcast

05:53.640 --> 05:54.940
 and other media channels.

05:54.940 --> 05:57.520
 So the idea here is to give you information

05:57.520 --> 05:59.720
 to your burning questions in depth

05:59.720 --> 06:01.880
 and allow you the opportunity to support

06:01.880 --> 06:04.640
 the kind of research that provides those kinds of answers

06:04.640 --> 06:05.640
 in the first place.

06:05.640 --> 06:08.000
 Now, an especially exciting feature of the premium channel

06:08.000 --> 06:10.940
 is that the Tiny Foundation has generously offered

06:10.940 --> 06:12.560
 to do a dollar-for-dollar match

06:12.560 --> 06:16.220
 on all funds raised for research through the premium channel.

06:16.220 --> 06:18.840
 So this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify

06:18.840 --> 06:20.800
 whatever funds come in through the premium channel

06:20.800 --> 06:22.840
 to further support research for science

06:22.840 --> 06:24.640
 and science-related tools for mental health,

06:24.640 --> 06:26.160
 physical health, and performance.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.000
 If you'd like to sign up

06:27.000 --> 06:28.760
 for the Huberman Lab premium channel,

06:28.760 --> 06:30.820
 again, there's a cost of $10 per month,

06:30.820 --> 06:33.580
 or you can pay $100 upfront for the entire year.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.920
 That will give you access to all the AMAs.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.800
 You can ask questions and get answers to your questions,

06:38.800 --> 06:41.400
 and you'll, of course, get answers to all the questions

06:41.400 --> 06:42.780
 that other people ask as well.

06:42.780 --> 06:44.720
 There will also be some premium content,

06:44.720 --> 06:46.520
 such as transcripts of the AMAs

06:46.520 --> 06:48.440
 and various transcripts and protocols

06:48.440 --> 06:51.680
 of Huberman Lab podcast episodes not found elsewhere.

06:51.680 --> 06:53.980
 And again, you'll be supporting research

06:53.980 --> 06:56.340
 for mental health, physical health, and performance.

06:56.340 --> 06:57.760
 You can sign up for the premium channel

06:57.760 --> 07:00.440
 by going to HubermanLab.com slash premium.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.300
 Again, that's HubermanLab.com slash premium.

07:03.300 --> 07:04.540
 Before diving into all of that,

07:04.540 --> 07:06.280
 I'd like to highlight a new,

07:06.280 --> 07:10.120
 what I think is very useful and zero-cost resource.

07:10.120 --> 07:13.580
 This resource is what's called non-sleep deep rest,

07:13.580 --> 07:15.720
 or NSDR protocol.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.960
 I've talked many times before on the Huberman Lab podcast

07:17.960 --> 07:21.960
 about non-sleep deep rest, AKA NSDR.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.080
 NSDR is sort of an umbrella term

07:24.080 --> 07:26.660
 for a variety of different practices.

07:26.660 --> 07:28.200
 So these are behavioral practices

07:28.200 --> 07:30.520
 that allow you to direct your brain and body

07:30.520 --> 07:32.960
 into a particular state.

07:32.960 --> 07:36.160
 And most typically, that state is one of deep relaxation,

07:36.160 --> 07:40.060
 but also one in which you can access your bodily

07:40.060 --> 07:42.840
 and brain systems for teaching yourself

07:42.840 --> 07:44.960
 how to relax in real time

07:44.960 --> 07:47.640
 and how to recover some of the sleep

07:47.640 --> 07:49.600
 that you may not be getting at night

07:49.600 --> 07:52.200
 and to restore levels of dopamine

07:52.200 --> 07:53.700
 in particular areas of the brain

07:53.700 --> 07:55.040
 that are involved in motivation

07:55.040 --> 07:56.960
 and cognitive and motor control.

07:56.960 --> 08:00.340
 Basically, NSDR is a wonderfully restorative tool.

08:00.340 --> 08:02.600
 This has been demonstrated many times over now

08:02.600 --> 08:04.240
 through quality peer-reviewed science.

08:04.240 --> 08:05.960
 And there are neurochemical benefits

08:05.960 --> 08:07.040
 and there are physical benefits

08:07.040 --> 08:09.560
 and there are certainly psychological benefits.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.440
 I highly recommend NSDR to anybody

08:12.440 --> 08:14.640
 that has trouble falling asleep

08:14.640 --> 08:16.040
 or that wakes up in the middle of the night

08:16.040 --> 08:18.040
 and needs to get better at falling back asleep,

08:18.040 --> 08:19.560
 as well as to anyone out there

08:19.560 --> 08:20.940
 that has issues with anxiety

08:20.940 --> 08:22.720
 or sort of self-regulation of any kind.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.580
 And if you don't have any of those issues,

08:24.580 --> 08:27.120
 it's also immensely beneficial just as a restorative

08:27.120 --> 08:29.320
 for leaning back into focus work of any kind.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.680
 Now, a number of people have reached out

08:30.680 --> 08:32.360
 about finding NSDR protocols

08:32.360 --> 08:34.200
 and there are a number of different good ones out there

08:34.200 --> 08:35.100
 floating around.

08:36.000 --> 08:39.080
 I've decided to put a zero cost NSDR script

08:39.080 --> 08:41.020
 out there on the internet for people to access.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.740
 So you can find it by going to YouTube

08:42.740 --> 08:46.440
 and simply put my last name Huberman and NSDR

08:46.440 --> 08:48.080
 into the search function.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.800
 This is a YouTube channel that's hosted by Virtusan,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.080
 which has a terrific app that includes NSDR

08:53.080 --> 08:55.680
 and a number of other health and wellness protocols.

08:55.680 --> 08:56.780
 But they've been quite generous

08:56.780 --> 08:59.960
 in hosting a 10 minute NSDR read by me.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.960
 This NSDR is distinct from,

09:01.960 --> 09:04.280
 although I should say similar to Yoga Nidra,

09:04.280 --> 09:06.360
 which some of you are familiar with.

09:06.360 --> 09:09.080
 This NSDR is different than Yoga Nidra

09:09.080 --> 09:11.140
 in the sense that it doesn't have intentions,

09:11.140 --> 09:12.560
 there's no mystical component.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.760
 And I describe a little bit of the science

09:14.760 --> 09:17.400
 and why specific components of the NSDR included,

09:17.400 --> 09:19.020
 things like long exhale breathing,

09:19.020 --> 09:20.480
 I talk about perceptual shifts

09:20.480 --> 09:22.640
 and how to move from thinking and planning

09:22.640 --> 09:23.740
 to pure sensation.

09:23.740 --> 09:25.240
 If none of that makes sense right now,

09:25.240 --> 09:28.360
 it'll make total sense after listening to the NSDR script.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.040
 Again, it's a 10 minute NSDR script read by me.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.320
 You can do this first thing in the morning when you wake up,

09:34.320 --> 09:36.460
 especially if you didn't get enough sleep that night

09:36.460 --> 09:38.160
 and you're feeling a little bit fatigued

09:38.160 --> 09:40.220
 and you need to lean into the day with full vigor.

09:40.220 --> 09:42.080
 You could do it at any point during the day,

09:42.080 --> 09:43.440
 or if you wake up in the middle of the night.

09:43.440 --> 09:45.980
 Again, this is a zero cost resource for you.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.320
 You can find it by going to YouTube,

09:47.320 --> 09:49.640
 put my last name in, and NSDR.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.000
 I encourage you to try it.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.200
 And if you like it, or frankly, if you don't,

09:54.200 --> 09:55.800
 you can just put that in the comment section

09:55.800 --> 09:56.880
 there on YouTube.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.560
 And I've put it there as a free resource to you

09:59.560 --> 10:03.120
 so that you can benefit from the research-backed,

10:03.120 --> 10:05.160
 peer-reviewed studies that point to NSDR

10:05.160 --> 10:07.460
 as a very useful practice.

10:07.460 --> 10:09.120
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

10:09.120 --> 10:10.400
 that this podcast is separate

10:10.400 --> 10:12.680
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.860
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

10:14.860 --> 10:16.760
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

10:16.760 --> 10:18.800
 about science and science-related tools

10:18.800 --> 10:20.160
 to the general public.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.220
 In keeping with that theme,

10:21.220 --> 10:23.920
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.960
 Our first sponsor is Levels.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.520
 Levels is a program that lets you see

10:27.520 --> 10:28.980
 how different foods affect your health

10:28.980 --> 10:31.120
 by giving you real-time feedback on your diet

10:31.120 --> 10:33.640
 using a continuous glucose monitor.

10:33.640 --> 10:34.940
 One of the most important factors

10:34.940 --> 10:36.760
 in your immediate and long-term health

10:36.760 --> 10:39.000
 is how well you're managing your blood glucose

10:39.000 --> 10:40.040
 or blood sugar.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.860
 I started using Levels about a year ago

10:41.860 --> 10:43.360
 as a way to see how different foods

10:43.360 --> 10:45.380
 and different lifestyle factors

10:45.380 --> 10:47.760
 were impacting my blood glucose levels.

10:47.760 --> 10:50.020
 So for instance, it allowed me to see how different foods

10:50.020 --> 10:51.480
 and particular macronutrients

10:51.480 --> 10:53.440
 and combinations of macronutrients

10:53.440 --> 10:57.000
 would either peak or trough my blood sugar

10:57.000 --> 10:59.060
 or keep my blood sugar steady.

10:59.060 --> 11:01.440
 It also allowed me to see how working out

11:01.440 --> 11:04.340
 with weights or running, how that impacted my blood glucose.

11:04.340 --> 11:06.360
 So for me, it was a fascinating experiment

11:06.360 --> 11:10.680
 unto myself as to how my meal schedule,

11:10.680 --> 11:12.400
 the specific foods I was eating,

11:12.400 --> 11:14.700
 different combinations of food, as I mentioned before,

11:14.700 --> 11:17.840
 and exercise were combining to regulate

11:17.840 --> 11:19.260
 this thing that we call blood sugar

11:19.260 --> 11:20.860
 and that's so vital to our health.

11:20.860 --> 11:22.560
 I think anyone that tries Levels

11:22.560 --> 11:24.780
 will find that you learn an immense amount

11:24.780 --> 11:25.700
 about what you're doing

11:25.700 --> 11:27.220
 and what you ought to be doing differently

11:27.220 --> 11:30.180
 in order to optimize your immediate feelings of wellbeing

11:30.180 --> 11:31.700
 and your health trajectory.

11:31.700 --> 11:33.360
 If you're interested in learning more about Levels

11:33.360 --> 11:34.980
 and trying a CGM yourself,

11:34.980 --> 11:37.320
 go to levels.link slash Huberman.

11:37.320 --> 11:41.120
 That's levels.link, L-I-N-K slash Huberman.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.560
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.160
 Thesis makes custom nootropics

11:45.160 --> 11:48.060
 that are designed for your particular needs.

11:48.060 --> 11:49.920
 I am not a fan of the word nootropics

11:49.920 --> 11:52.460
 because nootropics literally means smart drugs

11:52.460 --> 11:53.780
 or smart drug.

11:53.780 --> 11:56.620
 And frankly, as a neuroscientist,

11:56.620 --> 11:58.460
 I know and every other neuroscientist knows

11:58.460 --> 12:00.280
 that there is no neural circuit

12:00.280 --> 12:02.740
 or chemical in the brain for being smart.

12:02.740 --> 12:05.740
 There are, for instance, neural circuits and chemicals

12:05.740 --> 12:07.780
 that increase your ability to focus

12:07.780 --> 12:09.860
 or your ability to task switch.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.100
 Thesis understands this

12:11.100 --> 12:13.540
 and therefore has designed custom nootropics

12:13.540 --> 12:15.660
 that vary and are tailored to you

12:15.660 --> 12:16.540
 so that, for instance,

12:16.540 --> 12:18.600
 if you want to achieve focus and clarity

12:18.600 --> 12:20.580
 for one particular type of work,

12:20.580 --> 12:22.020
 there is a nootropic for that.

12:22.020 --> 12:25.940
 Or if you'd like to have more energy and have more focus,

12:25.940 --> 12:27.740
 there's a different nootropic for that.

12:27.740 --> 12:28.580
 If you'd like to get

12:28.580 --> 12:30.220
 your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

12:30.220 --> 12:33.520
 you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

12:33.520 --> 12:34.620
 take that three-minute quiz,

12:34.620 --> 12:36.460
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

12:36.460 --> 12:37.700
 to try in your first month,

12:37.700 --> 12:38.740
 and then they'll work with you

12:38.740 --> 12:40.620
 and iterate to find the best formulas

12:40.620 --> 12:41.820
 for you to take ongoing.

12:41.820 --> 12:44.540
 Again, that's takethesis.com slash Huberman

12:44.540 --> 12:46.500
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

12:46.500 --> 12:48.700
 to get 10% off your first box.

12:48.700 --> 12:51.660
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.180
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

12:54.180 --> 12:56.820
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

12:56.820 --> 12:58.420
 to help you better understand your body

12:58.420 --> 13:00.420
 and help you reach your health goals.

13:00.420 --> 13:03.220
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

13:03.220 --> 13:05.120
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

13:05.120 --> 13:07.180
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

13:07.180 --> 13:09.860
 can only be analyzed with a quality blood test.

13:09.860 --> 13:12.500
 With a lot of blood tests and DNA tests out there, however,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.320
 an issue is you get information back

13:14.320 --> 13:16.780
 about lipids and hormones, et cetera,

13:16.780 --> 13:18.420
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

13:18.420 --> 13:20.980
 With Inside Tracker, they have a personalized platform

13:20.980 --> 13:22.860
 that makes interpreting your data

13:22.860 --> 13:25.580
 and then acting on that data very straightforward

13:25.580 --> 13:28.340
 and very directed toward specific protocols.

13:28.340 --> 13:30.580
 What I mean by that is you'll get information back

13:30.580 --> 13:34.060
 about hormone levels and metabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,

13:34.060 --> 13:37.200
 and then you can look to nutritional changes,

13:37.200 --> 13:40.580
 supplementation changes, exercise protocol changes,

13:40.580 --> 13:42.900
 and other lifestyle features that combine

13:42.900 --> 13:45.820
 or work on their own to try and shift those numbers

13:45.820 --> 13:47.940
 into the range that's appropriate for you.

13:47.940 --> 13:49.320
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

13:49.320 --> 13:52.060

14:02.260 --> 14:04.300
 On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

14:04.300 --> 14:05.820
 we talk about supplements.

14:05.820 --> 14:07.960
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

14:07.960 --> 14:10.500
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them.

14:10.500 --> 14:13.140
 Things like enhancing sleep and the depth of sleep,

14:13.140 --> 14:15.860
 or for enhancing focus and cognitive ability,

14:15.860 --> 14:19.140
 or for enhancing energy or adjusting hormone levels

14:19.140 --> 14:20.700
 to optimal range for you.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.440
 The Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered

14:22.440 --> 14:23.780
 with Momentus Supplements.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.460
 We partnered with Momentus for a number of important reasons.

14:26.460 --> 14:28.900
 First of all, the quality of their ingredients

14:28.900 --> 14:31.180
 is exceptional, it's really second to none.

14:31.180 --> 14:32.960
 Second of all, they ship internationally,

14:32.960 --> 14:35.220
 and that was important to us because a number of you reside

14:35.220 --> 14:36.780
 outside of the United States.

14:36.780 --> 14:39.300
 Third, we've worked with Momentus very closely

14:39.300 --> 14:41.720
 to develop single ingredient formulations.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.620
 Now, this turns out to be very important

14:43.620 --> 14:45.820
 because if you're going to take supplements,

14:45.820 --> 14:48.260
 you want to know what's working for you and what isn't.

14:48.260 --> 14:51.420
 And of course, you want to optimize the cost efficiency

14:51.420 --> 14:54.460
 and the biological efficiency of those supplements.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.780
 To find the supplements we discuss

14:55.780 --> 14:57.020
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

14:57.020 --> 14:59.660
 you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S,

14:59.660 --> 15:02.220
 livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

15:02.220 --> 15:03.600
 And I should just mention that the library

15:03.600 --> 15:05.780
 of those supplements is constantly expanding.

15:05.780 --> 15:08.920
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.700
 Let's talk about cannabis.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.420
 And when we refer to cannabis,

15:12.420 --> 15:16.560
 we are indeed referring to marijuana or the marijuana plant.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.220
 Now, cannabis plants come in different strains

15:19.220 --> 15:22.300
 or different varieties, and those different strains

15:22.300 --> 15:25.220
 are indeed different genetic strains.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.980
 So just as animals and humans

15:26.980 --> 15:28.580
 have different genetic backgrounds

15:28.580 --> 15:30.180
 and they can be crossed to one another

15:30.180 --> 15:34.820
 to yield further genetic variation in the offspring,

15:34.820 --> 15:38.660
 plants can be hybridized to one another in various ways

15:38.660 --> 15:40.300
 through grafting or through the use

15:40.300 --> 15:43.120
 of different types of seed combinations, et cetera,

15:43.120 --> 15:45.280
 in order to generate different strains.

15:45.280 --> 15:47.860
 There are also naturally occurring differences

15:47.860 --> 15:49.540
 in the strains of plants,

15:49.540 --> 15:52.500
 and the cannabis plant is no exception.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.220
 So for instance, in the context of a discussion

15:55.220 --> 15:59.500
 about cannabis and its medicinal uses and recreational uses,

15:59.500 --> 16:03.940
 we need to distinguish between the sativa variety,

16:03.940 --> 16:08.380
 the indica variety, a variety called ruderalis,

16:08.380 --> 16:10.120
 that's not often discussed,

16:10.120 --> 16:13.940
 and hybrids of sativa, indica, and ruderalis.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.020
 Before diving into the different strains of cannabis

16:16.020 --> 16:17.480
 and how they impact the brain and body

16:17.480 --> 16:20.580
 both similarly and differently,

16:20.580 --> 16:22.860
 I want to emphasize that the cannabis plant

16:22.860 --> 16:26.220
 contains a number of different psychoactive compounds.

16:26.220 --> 16:29.980
 Now, the most powerful of those compounds is THC.

16:29.980 --> 16:34.980
 The technical name for it is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol,

16:35.140 --> 16:37.940
 but THC, as I'll refer to it,

16:37.940 --> 16:40.180
 is just one of the psychoactive

16:40.180 --> 16:43.280
 and biologically active compounds within cannabis plants.

16:43.280 --> 16:46.540
 There's also CBD,

16:46.540 --> 16:50.700
 which is technically referred to as cannabidiol,

16:50.700 --> 16:53.460
 and cannabidiol, CBD,

16:53.460 --> 16:56.620
 is known to be used for things like pain management,

16:56.620 --> 16:59.580
 anxiety management, and other medicinal purposes.

16:59.580 --> 17:03.060
 We will talk about the efficacy of CBD for those purposes,

17:03.060 --> 17:04.820
 as well as some of, believe it or not,

17:04.820 --> 17:06.520
 some of the dangers of CBD,

17:06.520 --> 17:09.420
 depending on where it's sourced and the dosage, et cetera.

17:09.420 --> 17:13.260
 So we've got THC, CBD,

17:13.260 --> 17:16.540
 and also CBN or cannabidiol.

17:16.540 --> 17:18.380
 CBN is less often discussed.

17:18.380 --> 17:19.620
 You're going to hear a lot less

17:19.620 --> 17:22.760
 about CBN-containing products out there,

17:22.760 --> 17:24.120
 CBN-containing medicines,

17:24.120 --> 17:25.860
 but it is relevant to today's discussion,

17:25.860 --> 17:27.040
 so it will come up a bit.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.380
 Now, I will be sure to provide more specificity

17:29.380 --> 17:31.020
 to what I'm about to say,

17:31.020 --> 17:33.420
 but very broadly speaking,

17:33.420 --> 17:35.620
 THC is largely responsible

17:35.620 --> 17:39.140
 for the psychoactive effects of cannabis.

17:39.140 --> 17:40.540
 That is the changes in mood,

17:40.540 --> 17:44.660
 the changes in bodily state and sensation, et cetera.

17:44.660 --> 17:48.580
 Whereas CBD, and to some extent CBN,

17:48.580 --> 17:52.140
 have profound effects on the brain and body,

17:52.140 --> 17:54.380
 but they don't tend to give people the sensation

17:54.380 --> 17:58.080
 of altered perception, altered mood, et cetera.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.960
 Some people might say they are not the component of cannabis

18:00.960 --> 18:03.100
 that quote unquote gets you high.

18:03.100 --> 18:04.380
 Although today we will really drill

18:04.380 --> 18:06.660
 into what the high itself represents

18:06.660 --> 18:09.360
 in terms of chemical systems in the brain and body.

18:09.360 --> 18:12.500
 And what we will soon learn is that

18:12.500 --> 18:14.660
 what we think of as being high

18:14.660 --> 18:17.000
 actually includes a number of different changes

18:17.000 --> 18:17.840
 in the brain and body,

18:17.840 --> 18:22.460
 some of which can be best explained by CBD, not by THC,

18:22.460 --> 18:24.940
 which runs counter to what most people out there

18:24.940 --> 18:26.380
 know and believe.

18:26.380 --> 18:30.880
 So broadly speaking, we have THC, CBD, and CBN,

18:30.880 --> 18:33.140
 but I want to point out that the cannabis plant

18:33.140 --> 18:37.260
 has over 70, seven zero, 70 different psychoactive compounds

18:37.260 --> 18:40.100
 many of which still have not been studied

18:40.100 --> 18:42.140
 in isolation and in detail.

18:42.140 --> 18:44.740
 So there's a big future of research for cannabis

18:44.740 --> 18:48.340
 and for THC and THC related psychoactive compounds

18:48.340 --> 18:50.760
 as well as for CBD and CBN.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.320
 Today we're mainly going to focus on THC and CBD

18:54.320 --> 18:55.620
 as I mentioned before.

18:55.620 --> 18:57.300
 I should also point out that the cannabis plant

18:57.300 --> 19:01.180
 has over 400 biologically active compounds.

19:01.180 --> 19:03.200
 So these are biologically active compounds

19:03.200 --> 19:06.660
 that may or may not have psychoactive properties

19:06.660 --> 19:09.460
 that may or may not be useful for pain relief, et cetera.

19:09.460 --> 19:12.780
 Again, there is a vast landscape for exploration

19:12.780 --> 19:16.700
 of the cannabis plant and of hemp for what they include

19:16.700 --> 19:20.000
 that could be beneficial to us or detrimental to us.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.820
 So again, a lot more work to do.

19:21.820 --> 19:23.880
 Today we're going to really try and stay on target

19:23.880 --> 19:25.740
 with what we already know

19:25.740 --> 19:28.380
 and where there are certain exciting mysteries

19:28.380 --> 19:30.980
 or intriguing mysteries about what we ought to explore

19:30.980 --> 19:33.100
 more I will certainly highlight those.

19:34.380 --> 19:36.980
 Let's go back to the different strains of the cannabis plant

19:36.980 --> 19:39.220
 sativa, indica and ruderalis

19:39.220 --> 19:43.360
 and explore how each of those differentially impacts

19:43.360 --> 19:45.180
 the brain and body because they're in

19:45.180 --> 19:46.980
 I think we can start to learn a lot

19:46.980 --> 19:50.280
 about this incredible plant that is the cannabis plant.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.120
 And whether or not you are a user of cannabis

19:53.120 --> 19:56.460
 or whether or not you are entirely opposed to cannabis use

19:56.460 --> 19:59.540
 understanding how cannabis works in the brain and body

19:59.540 --> 20:03.060
 itself is absolutely fascinating and can teach you a lot

20:03.060 --> 20:06.300
 about how your brain and body work at a basic level.

20:06.300 --> 20:08.580
 And can tell you a lot about how your brain and body

20:08.580 --> 20:10.240
 will react to different life events

20:10.240 --> 20:13.220
 and how your mood is established and stabilized

20:13.220 --> 20:16.220
 and how your appetite is established and stabilized

20:16.220 --> 20:17.180
 and so on.

20:17.180 --> 20:19.100
 So we have the three major strains of cannabis,

20:19.100 --> 20:21.900
 sativa, indica and ruderalis.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.680
 And for sake of today's conversation,

20:23.680 --> 20:26.000
 we can pretty much cross off ruderalis.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.220
 It's not often consumed

20:28.220 --> 20:32.260
 and components of ruderalis are not often consumed

20:32.260 --> 20:34.360
 for medicinal recreational purposes.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.560
 Let's focus on sativa and indica.

20:38.860 --> 20:42.900
 People will consume the sativa variety of cannabis

20:42.900 --> 20:47.260
 either by edible or by smoking cannabis

20:47.260 --> 20:50.580
 or they will consume the indica variety of cannabis again

20:50.580 --> 20:53.360
 by edible or by smoking cannabis

20:53.360 --> 20:56.340
 or sometimes they will take it in a transdermal form

20:56.340 --> 20:58.360
 or a sublingual form.

20:58.360 --> 21:01.260
 There are a bunch of different ways to get the cannabis

21:01.260 --> 21:02.500
 into the body.

21:02.500 --> 21:06.300
 But there's a clear distinction between sativa and indica

21:06.300 --> 21:09.780
 that actually shows up first in the structure of the plant.

21:09.780 --> 21:14.140
 At their extremes, meaning in a pure strain of sativa,

21:14.140 --> 21:16.660
 it tends to be a taller plant, a longer stock,

21:16.660 --> 21:17.640
 believe it or not.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.460
 And actually the length of the leaves

21:19.460 --> 21:20.780
 is quite a bit longer.

21:20.780 --> 21:25.020
 Whereas the indica plant tends to be more short and stout.

21:25.020 --> 21:27.860
 And for those aficionados out there,

21:27.860 --> 21:29.860
 I'm sure you know a lot of the other specific features

21:29.860 --> 21:31.280
 of sativa versus indica.

21:31.280 --> 21:34.340
 But already what we're talking about is the same plant,

21:34.340 --> 21:38.260
 cannabis, with two very different morphologies or shapes.

21:38.260 --> 21:40.140
 You might say, well, why is this interesting or important

21:40.140 --> 21:43.020
 to how it affects me or affects other people

21:43.020 --> 21:44.780
 for medicinal recreational purposes?

21:44.780 --> 21:47.700
 Well, it turns out that even though they are the same plant,

21:47.700 --> 21:49.660
 these two different genetic varieties,

21:49.660 --> 21:52.700
 because of the way that they grow

21:52.700 --> 21:54.500
 and the way they capture sunlight

21:54.500 --> 21:55.960
 and the way, believe it or not,

21:55.960 --> 21:58.660
 that the different plants within that strain

21:58.660 --> 21:59.780
 interact with one another,

21:59.780 --> 22:00.940
 because believe it or not,

22:00.940 --> 22:02.940
 plants are interacting with one another,

22:02.940 --> 22:04.880
 they actually bring different elements

22:04.880 --> 22:07.300
 of the psychoactive compounds to different components

22:07.300 --> 22:09.340
 within the leaves and the so-called buds.

22:10.540 --> 22:12.580
 The takeaway is that when consumed,

22:12.580 --> 22:14.460
 and when I say consumed, I want to be very clear,

22:14.460 --> 22:17.900
 I don't necessarily just mean oral consumption

22:17.900 --> 22:22.060
 or eating cannabis sativa by edible.

22:22.060 --> 22:23.820
 I also mean smoking it,

22:23.820 --> 22:27.740
 and that could be people will, just like with tobacco,

22:27.740 --> 22:30.220
 the way that they bring the psychoactive components

22:30.220 --> 22:32.700
 into their bloodstream and into their brain and body

22:32.700 --> 22:36.260
 is to essentially heat the dried leaves

22:36.260 --> 22:38.580
 of the cannabis plant.

22:38.580 --> 22:42.720
 Then the heat liberates some of the psychoactive components

22:42.720 --> 22:44.560
 that when inhaled into the lungs,

22:44.560 --> 22:46.820
 because the lungs include a lot of vasculature,

22:46.820 --> 22:50.400
 a lot of basically blood vessels and capillaries,

22:50.400 --> 22:54.020
 that the psychoactive components are actually

22:54.020 --> 22:56.460
 directly absorbed from the lungs into the bloodstream,

22:56.460 --> 22:58.060
 and they can cross into the bloodstream

22:58.060 --> 23:00.260
 and permeate throughout the body

23:00.260 --> 23:02.240
 and cross the so-called blood-brain barrier.

23:02.240 --> 23:06.820
 So in other words, burning the plant liberates the smoke

23:06.820 --> 23:09.660
 that contains the psychoactive compounds,

23:09.660 --> 23:11.540
 and those are inhaled into the lungs

23:11.540 --> 23:13.140
 and then get into the brain and body

23:13.140 --> 23:14.620
 and act on the brain and body.

23:14.620 --> 23:17.220
 And the major effect of sativa varieties

23:17.220 --> 23:19.940
 are to create a high, if you will,

23:19.940 --> 23:20.980
 and I'm putting this in air quotes

23:20.980 --> 23:22.440
 for those of you that are listening,

23:22.440 --> 23:24.460
 but to also act as a stimulant.

23:24.460 --> 23:26.260
 The sativa varieties tend to make people

23:26.260 --> 23:29.040
 feel kind of invigorated, somewhat alert.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.060
 It doesn't tend to be as much of a sedative

23:31.060 --> 23:32.720
 as some of the other varieties.

23:32.720 --> 23:35.140
 Some people report heightened sense of focus

23:35.140 --> 23:36.680
 or heightened sense of creativity.

23:36.680 --> 23:37.880
 We will talk a little bit later on

23:37.880 --> 23:39.820
 as to whether or not they actually are achieving

23:39.820 --> 23:41.780
 heightened levels of focus and creativity,

23:41.780 --> 23:43.460
 or whether or not they just perceive themselves

23:43.460 --> 23:45.480
 to have heightened levels of focus and creativity.

23:45.480 --> 23:47.880
 The sativa varieties tend to make people

23:47.880 --> 23:50.520
 feel a little bit less susceptible

23:50.520 --> 23:52.780
 to pain and noxious stimuli,

23:52.780 --> 23:55.900
 which are basically stimuli that you don't like.

23:55.900 --> 23:59.260
 So the sativa varieties are often prescribed

23:59.260 --> 24:02.840
 or are used in the recreational context

24:02.840 --> 24:05.200
 for pain management and relief.

24:05.200 --> 24:07.580
 Basically, the sativa variety is known

24:07.580 --> 24:10.460
 to include a sort of head-biased effect.

24:10.460 --> 24:12.920
 So here we're talking about subjective effects,

24:12.920 --> 24:14.200
 and of course, these will vary

24:14.200 --> 24:15.980
 from one individual to the next.

24:15.980 --> 24:18.020
 Some people will smoke cannabis sativa

24:18.020 --> 24:21.160
 or ingest cannabis sativa orally,

24:21.160 --> 24:24.400
 and will feel an entirely different array of effects,

24:24.400 --> 24:26.420
 but most people, the majority of people,

24:26.420 --> 24:30.500
 experience a sort of head-centered high alertness focus

24:30.500 --> 24:33.020
 and a sense that they're more creative.

24:33.020 --> 24:36.300
 Contrast that with the indica varieties of cannabis,

24:36.300 --> 24:40.940
 and when people smoke or eat or ingest indica varieties,

24:40.940 --> 24:43.100
 the psychoactive components of indica,

24:43.100 --> 24:44.620
 and again, this is pure indica,

24:44.620 --> 24:46.460
 so not hybridized with sativa at all,

24:46.460 --> 24:47.820
 but just pure indica,

24:47.820 --> 24:51.040
 tend to lead to more full-bodied effects.

24:51.040 --> 24:55.340
 People report feeling more complete full-body relaxation,

24:55.340 --> 24:57.540
 more of a sedative effect.

24:57.540 --> 25:00.420
 Indica cannabis is often prescribed

25:00.420 --> 25:02.140
 and or used recreationally

25:02.140 --> 25:04.860
 in order to achieve a state of sleep

25:04.860 --> 25:06.780
 or to help relieve anxiety,

25:06.780 --> 25:09.260
 so less of a stimulant effect,

25:09.260 --> 25:10.980
 and we will talk about why,

25:10.980 --> 25:12.960
 literally the underlying neural circuits,

25:12.960 --> 25:15.740
 that lead to the sativa variety

25:15.740 --> 25:19.900
 causing more of a elevated mood and a head high, if you will,

25:19.900 --> 25:23.000
 and the indica varieties being more full-body relaxation.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.420
 One of the ways to remember the distinction

25:24.420 --> 25:27.540
 between the effects of cannabis sativa and cannabis indica

25:27.540 --> 25:29.180
 was relayed to me by a friend

25:29.180 --> 25:32.540
 who actually was a chronic, meaning every day, all day,

25:33.580 --> 25:34.800
 consumer of marijuana.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.700
 He basically smoked marijuana for 20 years

25:36.700 --> 25:39.020
 before quitting about four or five years ago,

25:39.020 --> 25:43.340
 and he said that indica is often referred to as indicouch,

25:43.340 --> 25:45.860
 meaning laid back in the couch,

25:45.860 --> 25:47.580
 and that can help you remember

25:47.580 --> 25:50.020
 that the indica varieties of cannabis

25:50.020 --> 25:52.860
 do tend to be more sedative in their effects.

25:52.860 --> 25:54.500
 Okay, so there's sativa and there's indica,

25:54.500 --> 25:56.780
 and then now there are hybrid strains.

25:56.780 --> 26:00.180
 So marijuana growers and people who specialize

26:00.180 --> 26:03.020
 in creating novel varieties of the cannabis plant,

26:03.860 --> 26:05.780
 again, I'm using the words cannabis and marijuana

26:05.780 --> 26:08.000
 more or less interchangeably here,

26:08.000 --> 26:12.200
 they are very good at creating new strains of plant

26:12.200 --> 26:17.200
 that might be 25% sativa and 75% indica or vice versa,

26:17.300 --> 26:20.080
 or 50-50 or 90-10.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.620
 Essentially what's happening nowadays

26:21.620 --> 26:26.340
 is that through plant biology, plant genetics, I should say,

26:26.340 --> 26:28.960
 growers are getting quite efficient

26:28.960 --> 26:31.560
 at creating a variety of different strains

26:31.560 --> 26:35.840
 of the marijuana plant that give rise to very nuanced

26:35.840 --> 26:39.040
 and distinct effects on brain and body.

26:39.040 --> 26:42.680
 In fact, so much so that there's now a new nomenclature,

26:42.680 --> 26:46.540
 a new language emerging around cannabis

26:46.540 --> 26:48.780
 and the development of novel strains of cannabis

26:48.780 --> 26:51.780
 for medicinal and or recreational purposes.

26:51.780 --> 26:54.940
 And while this might sound a little bit medical

26:54.940 --> 26:57.440
 or a little bit clinical to some people,

26:57.440 --> 26:59.140
 believe it or not, this is the nomenclature

26:59.140 --> 27:00.500
 that it's now typically used.

27:00.500 --> 27:03.260
 People still refer to the sativa, indica,

27:03.260 --> 27:06.480
 and hybrid strains, but there's now also a description

27:06.480 --> 27:11.240
 of so-called type one, type two, and type three strains

27:11.240 --> 27:14.800
 for any given sativa, indica, or hybrid strain.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.200
 Okay, so just to put this clearly in your mind,

27:17.200 --> 27:20.440
 you've got sativa varieties, that is pure sativa varieties.

27:20.440 --> 27:24.400
 You have indica varieties, again, pure indica,

27:24.400 --> 27:27.040
 and then you have hybrid varieties.

27:27.040 --> 27:30.280
 And beneath each of those, you have type one, type two,

27:30.280 --> 27:35.280
 and type three strains of indica, sativa,

27:36.440 --> 27:38.140
 or hybrid varieties.

27:38.140 --> 27:41.340
 What are type one, type two, and type three?

27:41.340 --> 27:45.420
 Well, type one, type two, and type three strains

27:45.420 --> 27:47.740
 are strains that have varying amounts

27:47.740 --> 27:51.320
 or ratios of THC to CBD.

27:52.160 --> 27:54.760
 So for instance, type one strain.

27:54.760 --> 27:58.160
 So for instance, you could have a pure sativa type one

27:58.160 --> 28:01.200
 or a type one pure sativa, or a type one indica.

28:02.200 --> 28:04.240
 Those are going to have the greatest amount

28:04.240 --> 28:06.540
 of THC relative to CBD.

28:06.540 --> 28:08.240
 And I really want to emphasize this,

28:08.240 --> 28:11.520
 understanding the ratio of THC to CBD

28:11.520 --> 28:14.380
 can help explain a lot or even predict a lot

28:14.380 --> 28:18.740
 about how a given strain of cannabis will impact somebody.

28:18.740 --> 28:22.880
 For instance, because THC is largely responsible

28:22.880 --> 28:27.880
 for the typical psychoactive components of cannabis,

28:27.880 --> 28:31.320
 so what I mean here is if somebody is ingesting sativa

28:31.320 --> 28:34.640
 and it routinely makes them feel more energized,

28:34.640 --> 28:35.840
 elevates their mood,

28:36.840 --> 28:38.280
 gives them a heightened sense of creativity.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.200
 If that's what they experience

28:40.200 --> 28:42.680
 and they're taking a type one version of that,

28:42.680 --> 28:47.520
 that means that it's quite rich in THC and very little CBD.

28:47.520 --> 28:51.280
 However, if they were to take a type one version of sativa

28:51.280 --> 28:53.560
 and it feels far too strong, like too much energy,

28:53.560 --> 28:55.480
 or they felt like they were too much in their head,

28:55.480 --> 28:59.080
 nowadays, there are strains of sativa

28:59.080 --> 29:01.520
 that have been genetically engineered.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.680
 And I don't mean by an engineer tinkering away

29:03.680 --> 29:08.600
 with gene engineering in a kind of CRISPR creating mutants,

29:08.600 --> 29:10.020
 but literally by hybridizing,

29:10.020 --> 29:13.140
 crossing different plants to one another, okay?

29:13.140 --> 29:15.120
 Creating in a natural context,

29:15.120 --> 29:17.320
 the same way plants in the outside world

29:17.320 --> 29:19.620
 would sometimes hybridize to one another.

29:20.720 --> 29:23.580
 Creating a variety that's perhaps type two,

29:23.580 --> 29:28.580
 which is going to have less THC and more CBD,

29:28.640 --> 29:31.520
 or a type three, which is going to be very high CBD

29:31.520 --> 29:33.400
 and very little THC.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.480
 And the same is also true for the indica varieties.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.200
 So I want to make sure that everyone understands this

29:38.200 --> 29:39.200
 because it becomes very important

29:39.200 --> 29:41.520
 for understanding the biology of cannabis

29:41.520 --> 29:46.520
 and predicting positive versus negative effects of cannabis.

29:46.680 --> 29:49.440
 Sativa has this kind of stimulant-like effect

29:49.440 --> 29:51.600
 and tends to be more of a head high, if you will.

29:51.600 --> 29:54.080
 Indica tends to be more full body than lead to more

29:54.080 --> 29:58.240
 in the couch, as I referred to it before, pun intended.

29:59.120 --> 30:02.040
 Deep relaxation, reduced insomnia, et cetera.

30:02.040 --> 30:03.680
 Now within each of those, sativa and indica,

30:03.680 --> 30:05.200
 you have type one, type two, and type three.

30:05.200 --> 30:09.220
 And that has everything to do with how much THC,

30:09.220 --> 30:13.660
 which is the dominant psychoactive compound versus CBD,

30:13.660 --> 30:15.960
 which has other effects mainly on the body,

30:15.960 --> 30:19.100
 but not so much on the brain and modes of thinking

30:19.100 --> 30:20.080
 and mood, et cetera.

30:20.080 --> 30:22.200
 How much THC versus CBD is present.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.080
 And again, type one is THC dominant,

30:25.080 --> 30:27.380
 type two kind of equal ratios, if you will,

30:27.380 --> 30:30.800
 of THC and CBD, and type three tend to be high CBD.

30:30.800 --> 30:32.720
 Okay, so already we've got some categorization here

30:32.720 --> 30:34.640
 that hopefully isn't overwhelming to you,

30:34.640 --> 30:37.100
 but this turns out to be extremely important

30:37.100 --> 30:39.440
 if you want to understand how cannabis works

30:39.440 --> 30:41.360
 and predict the effects of cannabis.

30:41.360 --> 30:42.880
 I'd like to take a quick break

30:42.880 --> 30:45.800
 and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Athletic Greens.

30:45.800 --> 30:48.260
 Athletic Greens, now called AG1,

30:48.260 --> 30:50.620
 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink

30:50.620 --> 30:53.520
 that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs.

30:53.520 --> 30:56.200
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

30:56.200 --> 30:58.440
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

30:58.440 --> 31:00.020
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

31:00.020 --> 31:02.480
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens once

31:02.480 --> 31:06.000
 or usually twice a day is that it gets me the probiotics

31:06.000 --> 31:07.680
 that I need for gut health.

31:07.680 --> 31:08.800
 Our gut is very important.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.340
 It's populated by gut microbiota

31:11.340 --> 31:13.080
 that communicate with the brain, the immune system,

31:13.080 --> 31:15.500
 and basically all the biological systems of our body

31:15.500 --> 31:19.140
 to strongly impact our immediate and long-term health.

31:19.140 --> 31:22.160
 And those probiotics in Athletic Greens are optimal

31:22.160 --> 31:24.840
 and vital for microbiota health.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.680
 In addition, Athletic Greens contains a number

31:26.680 --> 31:28.820
 of adaptogens, vitamins, and minerals that make sure

31:28.820 --> 31:31.760
 that all of my foundational nutritional needs are met

31:31.760 --> 31:33.640
 and it tastes great.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.080
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

31:35.080 --> 31:38.480
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

31:38.480 --> 31:40.440
 and they'll give you five free travel packs

31:40.440 --> 31:42.760
 that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

31:42.760 --> 31:44.060
 while you're on the road, in the car,

31:44.060 --> 31:45.360
 on the plane, et cetera.

31:45.360 --> 31:48.760
 And they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

31:48.760 --> 31:51.440
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

31:51.440 --> 31:52.820
 to get the five free travel packs

31:52.820 --> 31:55.760
 and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

31:55.760 --> 31:57.280
 Okay, so somewhat surprisingly,

31:57.280 --> 31:58.680
 we're going to set aside cannabis.

31:58.680 --> 32:01.200
 We're going to take what we know about sativa, indica,

32:01.200 --> 32:03.600
 type one, type two, type three, CBD, et cetera.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.640
 We're just going to set that aside for a moment.

32:05.640 --> 32:06.480
 Why would we do that?

32:06.480 --> 32:08.600
 Well, we have to ask ourselves,

32:08.600 --> 32:10.480
 why would any of these plants,

32:10.480 --> 32:14.280
 why would any of these compounds, THC, CBD, sativa,

32:14.280 --> 32:15.600
 indica, et cetera,

32:15.600 --> 32:18.640
 why would any of that have any effect on us at all?

32:19.680 --> 32:21.720
 And this discussion that we're about to have

32:21.720 --> 32:23.800
 very much resembles the discussion

32:23.800 --> 32:26.480
 that we had on a previous episode about nicotine.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.000
 Because as many of you know,

32:28.000 --> 32:30.420
 nicotine is a commonly used substance.

32:30.420 --> 32:31.500
 In fact, if we were to look at

32:31.500 --> 32:34.060
 the three most commonly used drugs,

32:34.060 --> 32:35.600
 alcohol will be the top of the list.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.520
 Many billions of people regularly use alcohol

32:38.520 --> 32:40.740
 or occasionally use alcohol.

32:40.740 --> 32:44.200
 Many billions of people also use nicotine.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.720
 It's the second most consumed drug.

32:46.720 --> 32:48.480
 So more than 1 billion

32:48.480 --> 32:51.080
 and probably closer to 2 billion people consume nicotine.

32:51.080 --> 32:55.480
 And then the third most consumed drug is cannabis

32:55.480 --> 32:57.160
 in one form or another.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.280
 And many of you are probably shouting,

32:58.280 --> 32:59.120
 what about caffeine?

32:59.120 --> 32:59.940
 What about caffeine?

32:59.940 --> 33:02.160
 Well, in the context of drugs

33:02.160 --> 33:03.580
 and in particular addictive drugs,

33:03.580 --> 33:06.160
 caffeine doesn't quite rise to the list.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.140
 But if we were to look at caffeine

33:09.140 --> 33:10.800
 and include in that list,

33:10.800 --> 33:12.560
 caffeine would be above all of those, okay?

33:12.560 --> 33:14.400
 But the most commonly used drugs are alcohol.

33:14.400 --> 33:19.400
 Second after that is nicotine and then cannabis.

33:19.520 --> 33:21.860
 Nicotine, as some of you may know,

33:21.860 --> 33:23.320
 if you listen to the episode on nicotine,

33:23.320 --> 33:25.280
 but even if you didn't,

33:25.280 --> 33:27.660
 nicotine comes from the tobacco plant.

33:27.660 --> 33:29.600
 And there are a few other plants that include nicotine.

33:29.600 --> 33:32.400
 And typically it's brought into the brain and body

33:32.400 --> 33:34.240
 by smoking tobacco, dipping tobacco,

33:34.240 --> 33:37.400
 snuffing tobacco or vaping nicotine.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.640
 Nicotine exists in the outside world in these plants,

33:41.640 --> 33:42.800
 the tobacco plants.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.640
 But the reason it has an effect on the body

33:44.640 --> 33:47.080
 is that there are so-called nicotinic receptors

33:47.080 --> 33:47.920
 in the body.

33:47.920 --> 33:48.880
 Now those nicotinic receptors

33:48.880 --> 33:51.260
 were named after nicotine, the compound,

33:51.260 --> 33:53.420
 but they existed in the brain and body,

33:53.420 --> 33:55.980
 not because of the existence of a tobacco plant,

33:55.980 --> 33:59.080
 but because there are other chemicals in the body

33:59.080 --> 34:01.960
 that naturally occur, namely acetylcholine

34:01.960 --> 34:04.080
 that bind the nicotine receptor.

34:05.040 --> 34:07.320
 Those chemicals such as acetylcholine

34:07.320 --> 34:10.080
 that bind the nicotinic receptor in your brain and body

34:10.080 --> 34:13.220
 create an enhanced sense of focus, et cetera, et cetera.

34:13.220 --> 34:18.220
 But nicotine from tobacco binds that same receptor,

34:19.000 --> 34:20.680
 but with much greater affinity

34:20.680 --> 34:23.560
 and therefore also creates a state of focus,

34:23.560 --> 34:27.080
 but a much greater one than we can achieve without nicotine.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.480
 Okay, so you can see the nicotine episode

34:28.480 --> 34:30.320
 if you want to learn more about that.

34:31.400 --> 34:33.060
 In a very similar way,

34:34.240 --> 34:35.540
 all of our brains and bodies

34:35.540 --> 34:38.120
 from the time that we are conceived,

34:38.120 --> 34:40.360
 believe it or not, very shortly after conception,

34:40.360 --> 34:41.740
 if we want to be accurate,

34:41.740 --> 34:44.360
 very early conception when you were in the womb,

34:45.200 --> 34:47.040
 and still now, if you're listening to this,

34:47.040 --> 34:51.800
 you have what are called cannabinoid receptors

34:51.800 --> 34:55.880
 because you also have endogenous cannabinoids.

34:55.880 --> 34:56.720
 What do we mean by that?

34:56.720 --> 34:59.460
 You have receptors which are like little parking spots

34:59.460 --> 35:03.340
 that are present on cells in your brain and body,

35:03.340 --> 35:05.680
 and what we call a ligand,

35:05.680 --> 35:07.560
 which is basically just a chemical that's released,

35:07.560 --> 35:09.760
 parks in that receptor,

35:09.760 --> 35:12.720
 and causes a number of different biological effects.

35:14.540 --> 35:17.340
 Cannabis contains compounds

35:17.340 --> 35:19.480
 that also bind to those receptors,

35:19.480 --> 35:21.440
 but here I want to make a really clear distinction.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.660
 We have what are called endogenous ligands,

35:23.660 --> 35:26.240
 those that just mean chemicals from within us

35:26.240 --> 35:27.360
 that we make naturally,

35:27.360 --> 35:29.360
 even if we never go near the cannabis plant

35:29.360 --> 35:31.160
 or any other source of cannabis,

35:31.160 --> 35:34.200
 we have chemicals that are created in us

35:34.200 --> 35:38.320
 that park in those receptors and cause biological effects

35:38.320 --> 35:40.340
 on mood, on perception, on the immune system,

35:40.340 --> 35:41.640
 on hunger, et cetera.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.400
 Again, without ever going anywhere near cannabis,

35:44.400 --> 35:47.080
 we have these endogenous cannabinoids.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.680
 So endogenous cannabinoids are floating around in us,

35:49.680 --> 35:52.080
 or I should say they are released in us in particular ways,

35:52.080 --> 35:53.040
 bind to these receptors

35:53.040 --> 35:55.760
 and cause changes in mood, appetite, et cetera.

35:55.760 --> 35:57.720
 They have many different effects on the brain and body.

35:57.720 --> 35:59.680
 We will talk about those.

35:59.680 --> 36:01.220
 But just like with nicotine,

36:01.220 --> 36:03.280
 there are substances in the outside world,

36:03.280 --> 36:06.800
 in this case, cannabis contains these substances,

36:06.800 --> 36:11.280
 so things like THC and like CBD,

36:11.280 --> 36:14.040
 that when ingested by smoking or vaping

36:14.040 --> 36:15.640
 or by ingesting edibles,

36:16.760 --> 36:20.160
 also will park in those same receptors,

36:20.160 --> 36:24.360
 the cannabinoid receptors, and lead to biological effects.

36:24.360 --> 36:25.560
 Now it's a little bit misleading

36:25.560 --> 36:27.480
 because we call them cannabinoid receptors

36:27.480 --> 36:31.440
 as if they were there to bind cannabis,

36:31.440 --> 36:33.440
 or just like we call the nicotine receptors

36:33.440 --> 36:35.240
 nicotinic receptors,

36:35.240 --> 36:36.880
 it makes it seem as if they were there

36:36.880 --> 36:40.320
 in order to bind nicotine from tobacco.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.560
 But that's not the way our brains and bodies evolved.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.600
 Our brains and bodies evolved for these receptors

36:45.600 --> 36:48.560
 to make use of chemicals that exist within us

36:48.560 --> 36:51.480
 called, again, endogenous chemicals.

36:51.480 --> 36:54.200
 And those endogenous chemicals lead to certain effects,

36:54.200 --> 36:55.440
 as I mentioned before.

36:55.440 --> 36:56.580
 The key thing here,

36:56.580 --> 36:59.360
 if you haven't understood anything I've said up until now,

36:59.360 --> 37:00.360
 please understand this.

37:00.360 --> 37:04.560
 The key thing is that THC and CBD

37:04.560 --> 37:06.760
 and the other components of cannabis

37:06.760 --> 37:08.420
 bind to those receptors,

37:08.420 --> 37:10.660
 those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,

37:10.660 --> 37:12.520
 the ones that we naturally make,

37:12.520 --> 37:14.840
 with much greater affinity

37:14.840 --> 37:17.720
 and exert a vastly greater potency

37:17.720 --> 37:20.820
 and effect on mood and perception, et cetera,

37:20.820 --> 37:23.940
 than do our endogenous cannabinoids.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.760
 Another analogy that one could take

37:26.760 --> 37:28.280
 in order to understand this

37:28.280 --> 37:31.800
 would be hormones like testosterone and estrogen.

37:31.800 --> 37:35.040
 Many people, I would say all people,

37:35.040 --> 37:37.600
 make testosterone and estrogen to varying degrees.

37:37.600 --> 37:39.280
 It's going to depend on whether or not you're male, female,

37:39.280 --> 37:40.800
 your age, whether or not you've gone through puberty,

37:40.800 --> 37:42.200
 et cetera, et cetera.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.360
 But let's just say testosterone, for example.

37:45.360 --> 37:48.960
 There's testosterone circulating in your body.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.800
 That's true if you're male or female.

37:50.800 --> 37:53.060
 And there are receptors called androgen receptors.

37:53.060 --> 37:56.080
 We could even call them testosterone receptors.

37:56.080 --> 37:58.180
 And the testosterone binds to those receptors

37:58.180 --> 37:59.320
 and has effects on cells.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.660
 It causes hair growth, changes the voice.

38:01.660 --> 38:02.920
 It can affect libido.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.640
 It affects all sorts of things in the brain and body,

38:04.640 --> 38:07.740
 depending on which organ and tissue you're talking about.

38:07.740 --> 38:09.280
 But of course, there are people

38:09.280 --> 38:11.080
 that take synthetic testosterone

38:11.080 --> 38:14.000
 or derivatives of testosterone.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.600
 And some of those derivatives, for instance,

38:15.600 --> 38:17.600
 in the bodybuilding community and the sports community,

38:17.600 --> 38:19.260
 they will take things like Diana Ball.

38:19.260 --> 38:23.160
 These are modified versions of testosterone

38:23.160 --> 38:26.120
 that can bind to the testosterone receptor

38:26.120 --> 38:28.580
 with much greater affinity, or I should say,

38:28.580 --> 38:31.040
 the androgen receptor with much greater affinity

38:31.040 --> 38:34.060
 and have supra physiological effects,

38:34.060 --> 38:36.880
 effects that would essentially never be seen

38:36.880 --> 38:41.720
 from testosterone that was endogenously,

38:41.720 --> 38:45.600
 excuse me, endogenously released within the body.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.280
 We could say the same thing for estrogen.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.560
 There are estrogen receptors.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.800
 They bind estrogen, okay?

38:51.800 --> 38:54.240
 But if someone were to take synthetic estrogen

38:54.240 --> 38:55.840
 or to ingest a plant compound

38:55.840 --> 38:58.080
 that contains various estrogenic compounds,

38:58.080 --> 39:00.680
 and those plants certainly exist out there,

39:00.680 --> 39:03.240
 they can have supra physiological effects

39:03.240 --> 39:04.800
 on those receptors.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.080
 Why am I telling you this?

39:06.080 --> 39:10.040
 Well, many people believe that because cannabis,

39:10.040 --> 39:14.100
 marijuana is a plant and plants grow out of the ground

39:14.100 --> 39:16.040
 and they're naturally occurring,

39:16.040 --> 39:19.360
 and because we have receptors in our body

39:19.360 --> 39:23.040
 that are there without the need to engineer them

39:23.040 --> 39:25.120
 from some external source, right?

39:25.120 --> 39:26.720
 They're in our genome, they program for it,

39:26.720 --> 39:27.720
 and we're born with these things,

39:27.720 --> 39:30.080
 and we keep these our entire life.

39:30.080 --> 39:33.160
 Many people mistakenly think, ah, you know,

39:33.160 --> 39:36.560
 these plant compounds are safer for us or better for us

39:36.560 --> 39:39.880
 or are somehow appropriate for us to ingest,

39:39.880 --> 39:41.440
 but that's simply not true.

39:41.440 --> 39:43.180
 And here, I'm not saying that cannabis

39:43.180 --> 39:44.720
 is always a bad idea for people.

39:44.720 --> 39:46.440
 There are certain populations and certain people

39:46.440 --> 39:49.520
 for which it can be relatively safe recreationally.

39:49.520 --> 39:50.360
 That's the truth.

39:50.360 --> 39:51.440
 And there are other populations

39:51.440 --> 39:53.460
 for which it can be downright dangerous,

39:53.460 --> 39:55.880
 recreationally or medicinally.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.400
 And of course, there are medicinal purposes

39:57.400 --> 39:59.600
 that are being explored, and we'll talk more about that.

39:59.600 --> 40:01.120
 But this is vital to understand

40:01.120 --> 40:02.580
 because I think that when we hear,

40:02.580 --> 40:04.680
 oh, it's from a plant, it's natural,

40:04.680 --> 40:06.400
 and then you also have a receptor for these,

40:06.400 --> 40:08.080
 endogenous cannabinoid receptors,

40:08.080 --> 40:11.500
 and therefore the marriage of those two, right?

40:11.500 --> 40:15.360
 The coming together of the chemical, THC or CBD or both,

40:15.360 --> 40:18.240
 with these receptors is somehow supposed to happen

40:18.240 --> 40:21.440
 as if this was a purpose of having these receptors,

40:21.440 --> 40:22.720
 but it's simply not the case.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.820
 In the same way that the nicotinic receptors

40:24.820 --> 40:27.340
 are not there because nicotine is good for us.

40:27.340 --> 40:28.640
 They're there because there are compounds

40:28.640 --> 40:30.940
 that exist within us that are good

40:30.940 --> 40:34.160
 to bind to those receptors from time to time.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.240
 Now, here's the key thing about,

40:36.240 --> 40:37.760
 I guess today I'm saying there are a lot of key things,

40:37.760 --> 40:41.020
 but here's another key thing about understanding cannabis

40:41.020 --> 40:42.360
 and the way that it works,

40:42.360 --> 40:45.740
 which is that THC and CBD,

40:45.740 --> 40:47.600
 when they're brought into the brain and body

40:47.600 --> 40:50.440
 by smoking or edible, et cetera,

40:50.440 --> 40:53.940
 they bind to those receptors,

40:53.940 --> 40:56.340
 those endogenous cannabinoid receptors,

40:56.340 --> 40:58.460
 and they tap into the same systems

40:58.460 --> 41:01.820
 that your endogenous cannabinoids would tap into,

41:01.820 --> 41:04.180
 the ones that affect mood and energy and creativity

41:04.180 --> 41:05.880
 and relaxation, et cetera,

41:05.880 --> 41:10.880
 but they do so with thousand fold greater potency.

41:11.100 --> 41:13.260
 And as a consequence of that,

41:13.260 --> 41:16.820
 your endogenous cannabinoids are out competed.

41:16.820 --> 41:18.620
 They really get no opportunity

41:18.620 --> 41:20.780
 to interact with those receptors.

41:20.780 --> 41:23.040
 And understanding that can lead

41:23.040 --> 41:25.580
 to a very clear understanding of why, for instance,

41:25.580 --> 41:28.740
 when people use cannabis to relieve anxiety

41:28.740 --> 41:31.140
 or they use cannabis to enter a certain brain state

41:31.140 --> 41:33.620
 for creativity or to enter sleep,

41:33.620 --> 41:37.060
 why a dependence on cannabis starts to emerge,

41:37.060 --> 41:39.540
 because if they don't ingest cannabis,

41:39.540 --> 41:41.620
 and again, ingest could mean smoke,

41:41.620 --> 41:45.260
 to bring THC in or CBD in or ingest orally

41:45.260 --> 41:46.700
 or even transdermal or tincture

41:46.700 --> 41:48.380
 or one of the other varieties,

41:48.380 --> 41:50.100
 if they don't do that,

41:50.100 --> 41:53.300
 then what happens is not only are the receptors

41:53.300 --> 41:55.460
 not stimulated to the same degree

41:55.460 --> 41:59.060
 or with the same potency that they normally are,

41:59.060 --> 42:01.160
 but the endogenous cannabinoids

42:01.160 --> 42:02.620
 can no longer have their effect.

42:02.620 --> 42:05.160
 So people experience heightened levels of anxiety,

42:05.160 --> 42:09.860
 disrupted mood, disrupted brain state, and so on.

42:09.860 --> 42:11.900
 Now, again, I want to be very clear

42:11.900 --> 42:13.980
 that I'm not trying to paint a picture of cannabis

42:13.980 --> 42:16.120
 as all bad or even partially bad.

42:16.120 --> 42:18.260
 What I want to do today is give you as much information

42:18.260 --> 42:21.460
 I can as to how cannabis works,

42:21.460 --> 42:23.020
 how its different component parts work,

42:23.020 --> 42:25.060
 how the different types of cannabis work,

42:25.060 --> 42:28.700
 and point to some of the valid medicinal uses

42:28.700 --> 42:30.220
 and some of the recreational uses,

42:30.220 --> 42:33.040
 and then lay out the landscape for you

42:33.040 --> 42:35.300
 as to who is really most at risk

42:35.300 --> 42:38.380
 in terms of psychoactive components,

42:38.380 --> 42:40.640
 immune components, and so on and so forth

42:40.640 --> 42:42.540
 so that you can make the most informed choice for you.

42:42.540 --> 42:45.980
 I am not here to tell you what to do or what not to do.

42:45.980 --> 42:49.700
 As I like to say, do as you wish, right?

42:49.700 --> 42:51.240
 I mean, don't do as you wish

42:51.240 --> 42:52.440
 if it harms other people or yourself,

42:52.440 --> 42:55.020
 but do as you wish, but know what you're doing.

42:55.020 --> 42:56.500
 So that's really my goal here.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.580
 So as we begin to dive further into the biology,

42:58.580 --> 43:00.540
 I think you'll start to get a clearer picture

43:00.540 --> 43:03.740
 of why cannabis is so effective in some contexts,

43:03.740 --> 43:07.700
 but also why it can create such massive suffering

43:07.700 --> 43:11.300
 in other contexts because of the way that it out-competes

43:11.300 --> 43:14.580
 your own natural endogenous cannabinoid systems.

43:14.580 --> 43:16.740
 So let's talk about those endogenous cannabinoid systems,

43:16.740 --> 43:18.660
 what they are and how they work,

43:18.660 --> 43:20.380
 because that will give us a lens

43:20.380 --> 43:22.820
 into what the higher potency,

43:22.820 --> 43:26.220
 sort of maximum impact of the various cannabis plant

43:26.220 --> 43:28.980
 varieties and strains and THC and CBD and so forth,

43:28.980 --> 43:30.980
 how and why those work.

43:30.980 --> 43:32.980
 So what are the endogenous cannabinoids,

43:32.980 --> 43:36.860
 these chemical substances that everybody makes?

43:36.860 --> 43:38.380
 You make them, I make them.

43:38.380 --> 43:39.380
 You've been making them

43:39.380 --> 43:41.180
 basically from the time that you were conceived

43:41.180 --> 43:43.880
 and you are going to make them until the time that you die.

43:43.880 --> 43:45.520
 Whether or not they have the impact

43:45.520 --> 43:47.620
 and the biological functions that I'm about to describe

43:47.620 --> 43:49.560
 will depend a lot on whether or not

43:49.560 --> 43:53.240
 you are using your own endogenous cannabinoids

43:53.240 --> 43:55.820
 to park in those receptors that you also have

43:55.820 --> 43:57.980
 from birth until death,

43:57.980 --> 44:01.780
 or whether or not you are tickling those receptors

44:01.780 --> 44:04.380
 or strongly activating those receptors

44:04.380 --> 44:09.380
 using some external source like cannabis, THC, et cetera.

44:09.380 --> 44:14.020
 The two main endogenous cannabinoids

44:14.020 --> 44:16.660
 that we want to consider are anandamide,

44:16.660 --> 44:18.980
 which we will refer to as EAE.

44:18.980 --> 44:21.500
 So anandamide and another one,

44:21.500 --> 44:26.020
 which is arachidinoyl glycerol, arachidinoyl glycerol,

44:26.020 --> 44:28.140
 which we will abbreviate 2AG.

44:28.140 --> 44:31.620
 So let's just take EAE and 2AG,

44:31.620 --> 44:34.780
 lump them together and talk about the endogenous cannabinoids

44:34.780 --> 44:35.860
 just to make it simple.

44:35.860 --> 44:38.240
 But if you want to do the deep dive on anandamide

44:38.240 --> 44:41.620
 versus 2AG, please be my guest.

44:42.700 --> 44:45.980
 The endogenous cannabinoids are released from neurons.

44:45.980 --> 44:46.820
 What are neurons?

44:46.820 --> 44:48.580
 Neurons are nerve cells,

44:48.580 --> 44:52.360
 and nerve cells should be conceptualized like this.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.940
 You have presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic neurons.

44:54.940 --> 44:57.740
 Presynaptic neurons basically contain little vesicles,

44:57.740 --> 45:00.800
 little bubbles full of neurotransmitter,

45:00.800 --> 45:02.020
 which are chemicals.

45:02.020 --> 45:05.140
 And when neurons are stimulated electrically,

45:05.140 --> 45:06.540
 and that could be from a thought,

45:06.540 --> 45:08.800
 it could be from the desire to move,

45:08.800 --> 45:10.700
 it could be because of a drug,

45:10.700 --> 45:12.500
 it could be because you're hungry,

45:13.340 --> 45:17.740
 the relevant neurons will vomit out or will fuse,

45:17.740 --> 45:19.620
 as we say, those little packets,

45:19.620 --> 45:21.500
 those little bubbles of neurotransmitter

45:21.500 --> 45:23.940
 into the gap between the pre and postsynaptic neuron.

45:23.940 --> 45:26.540
 We call that a synaptic cleft or the synapse.

45:26.540 --> 45:27.900
 It's a little gap, a little space.

45:27.900 --> 45:30.760
 And the neurotransmitter flows across that synapse,

45:30.760 --> 45:33.480
 and some of it will park in little parking spots

45:33.480 --> 45:36.460
 that we call receptors on the postsynaptic neuron side.

45:36.460 --> 45:38.400
 Depending on which neurotransmitter it is,

45:38.400 --> 45:39.860
 and a bunch of other things,

45:39.860 --> 45:42.220
 not worth going into right now,

45:42.220 --> 45:43.400
 the parking of that chemical

45:43.400 --> 45:44.800
 in those neurotransmitter receptors

45:44.800 --> 45:48.900
 will either cause that neuron on the postsynaptic side

45:48.900 --> 45:52.700
 to itself release neurotransmitter elsewhere,

45:52.700 --> 45:54.640
 or it will quiet it down,

45:54.640 --> 45:56.400
 so-called excitation and inhibition.

45:56.400 --> 45:58.540
 That's kind of neurotransmission in a nutshell.

45:58.540 --> 46:00.220
 If you don't understand it, no big deal.

46:00.220 --> 46:01.100
 It's not going to prevent you

46:01.100 --> 46:02.380
 from understanding today's discussion.

46:02.380 --> 46:04.380
 If you understand even a small fraction

46:04.380 --> 46:05.780
 of what I've just said,

46:05.780 --> 46:08.680
 then it's going to allow you to understand

46:08.680 --> 46:10.940
 not just today's discussion, but a lot of neuroscience

46:10.940 --> 46:13.540
 with a lot more nuance and depth of understanding.

46:15.180 --> 46:18.920
 The key thing to know about the endogenous cannabinoids

46:18.920 --> 46:22.500
 is that unlike most neurotransmitters,

46:22.500 --> 46:25.700
 they are released from the postsynaptic side.

46:25.700 --> 46:27.920
 So what happens is neurotransmitter

46:27.920 --> 46:31.100
 goes from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic neuron,

46:31.100 --> 46:33.000
 but under certain conditions,

46:33.000 --> 46:36.580
 the postsynaptic neuron itself releases a chemical,

46:36.580 --> 46:38.340
 and that chemical goes backward,

46:38.340 --> 46:41.340
 what we call retrogradely, to the presynaptic neuron,

46:41.340 --> 46:42.980
 binds the receptors there,

46:42.980 --> 46:46.580
 and changes the probability that the presynaptic neuron

46:46.580 --> 46:48.080
 will release neurotransmitter.

46:49.680 --> 46:52.460
 Put simply, endogenous cannabinoids

46:52.460 --> 46:55.140
 tend to decrease the probability

46:55.140 --> 46:59.000
 that a neuron will release neurotransmitter.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.740
 They are sort of a brake on the system.

47:00.740 --> 47:03.100
 They are a way of shutting down

47:03.100 --> 47:06.120
 the communication between neurons, regulating it,

47:06.120 --> 47:07.500
 not to make it completely quiet,

47:07.500 --> 47:10.660
 but to adjust the levels with a lot of nuance.

47:10.660 --> 47:13.620
 Now, the other thing that the endogenous cannabinoids do

47:13.620 --> 47:15.420
 is sort of a mind-bender

47:15.420 --> 47:17.300
 because we're talking about cannabis,

47:17.300 --> 47:20.380
 and a commonly known feature of cannabis

47:20.380 --> 47:21.980
 and marijuana consumption

47:21.980 --> 47:24.020
 is disruptions in short-term memory,

47:24.020 --> 47:26.220
 and there is essentially zero debate

47:26.220 --> 47:27.500
 as to whether or not that occurs,

47:27.500 --> 47:29.780
 and we'll talk about the mechanisms a little bit later,

47:29.780 --> 47:33.660
 and yet endogenous cannabinoids,

47:33.660 --> 47:35.300
 the chemicals that you naturally release

47:35.300 --> 47:36.700
 from these postsynaptic neurons

47:36.700 --> 47:40.220
 that travel retrogradely back to the presynaptic neuron,

47:40.220 --> 47:43.820
 actually can lead to strengthening of connections

47:43.820 --> 47:47.260
 between the presynaptic neuron and the postsynaptic neuron

47:47.260 --> 47:51.600
 through a process called long-term potentiation, or LTP.

47:51.600 --> 47:55.140
 They can also cause what's called depression

47:55.140 --> 47:57.680
 of communication between a presynaptic neuron

47:57.680 --> 48:00.260
 and a postsynaptic neuron.

48:00.260 --> 48:03.580
 Long-term depression has nothing to do

48:03.580 --> 48:07.560
 with depression as a psychological state or as a illness.

48:09.020 --> 48:11.060
 Long-term potentiation and long-term depression

48:11.060 --> 48:12.940
 simply refer to the probability

48:12.940 --> 48:15.380
 that one neuron will be able to stimulate

48:15.380 --> 48:17.240
 and activate another neuron,

48:17.240 --> 48:21.440
 and as I just told you, the endogenous cannabinoids

48:21.440 --> 48:24.420
 can either turn up the dial or turn down the dial.

48:24.420 --> 48:26.340
 They can either increase the probability

48:26.340 --> 48:28.060
 or decrease the probability

48:28.060 --> 48:30.580
 that a given connection between neurons

48:30.580 --> 48:33.340
 will function more or will function less.

48:33.340 --> 48:35.060
 So if you think about the communication between neurons

48:35.060 --> 48:37.860
 as a crosstalk, as a conversation,

48:37.860 --> 48:40.900
 well, the endogenous cannabinoids

48:40.900 --> 48:42.740
 can dictate whether or not that conversation

48:42.740 --> 48:44.640
 is likely to occur or not to occur.

48:44.640 --> 48:47.380
 Think of them as either putting someone

48:47.380 --> 48:50.320
 at the top of your text chain in your phone,

48:50.320 --> 48:52.460
 which would be long-term potentiation,

48:52.460 --> 48:55.100
 or essentially blocking their number,

48:55.100 --> 48:57.680
 which would essentially be long-term depression.

48:58.680 --> 49:00.860
 So if you're getting the impression

49:00.860 --> 49:02.260
 that the endogenous cannabinoids

49:02.260 --> 49:04.160
 are working in a number of different ways

49:04.160 --> 49:06.220
 and it's not very straightforward, you're right.

49:06.220 --> 49:08.420
 In fact, that's the message that I'd like you to take away.

49:08.420 --> 49:10.260
 The endogenous cannabinoids

49:10.260 --> 49:12.420
 are sometimes increasing neuronal communication.

49:12.420 --> 49:14.420
 This can lead to increases in mood

49:14.420 --> 49:16.860
 or increases in the likelihood

49:16.860 --> 49:18.380
 that someone will talk a certain way

49:18.380 --> 49:20.760
 or behave a certain way or feel a certain way.

49:20.760 --> 49:24.220
 They can also lead to decreases in synaptic transmission,

49:24.220 --> 49:25.760
 that is communication between neurons,

49:25.760 --> 49:29.180
 in ways that will make somebody's mood lower

49:29.180 --> 49:32.380
 or will make them less hungry or more hungry.

49:32.380 --> 49:34.980
 And here's the really key thing.

49:34.980 --> 49:38.260
 There are two kinds of endogenous cannabinoid receptors

49:38.260 --> 49:40.940
 referred to as CB1 and CB2.

49:40.940 --> 49:42.960
 And we can say with confidence

49:42.960 --> 49:46.620
 that CB1 is highly enriched in the nervous system

49:46.620 --> 49:48.180
 and especially within the brain.

49:48.180 --> 49:49.480
 It's found not everywhere,

49:49.480 --> 49:51.060
 but almost everywhere in the brain

49:51.060 --> 49:52.180
 and elsewhere in the nervous system,

49:52.180 --> 49:55.900
 so spinal cord and other aspects of the nervous system.

49:55.900 --> 49:58.640
 CB2, the cannabinoid receptor.

49:59.540 --> 50:02.500
 CB2 is largely located in the tissues of the body,

50:02.500 --> 50:04.660
 including the immune system, the liver,

50:04.660 --> 50:07.060
 even the genitals, et cetera.

50:07.060 --> 50:09.680
 So what this means is that the endogenous cannabinoids

50:09.680 --> 50:11.880
 are having these sorts of effects on neurons

50:11.880 --> 50:12.720
 that I talked about,

50:12.720 --> 50:15.660
 but they are also having effects on immune cells,

50:15.660 --> 50:18.420
 on reproductive organs, on liver, on digestion,

50:18.420 --> 50:19.660
 on hunger, et cetera,

50:19.660 --> 50:22.640
 through mechanisms that are divorced from the function

50:22.640 --> 50:24.900
 of the nervous system of neurons.

50:24.900 --> 50:26.860
 Now, in reality, no system of the brain and body

50:26.860 --> 50:28.060
 is divorced from the nervous system

50:28.060 --> 50:30.340
 because the nervous system is controlling everything.

50:30.340 --> 50:31.620
 There is really the master controller

50:31.620 --> 50:33.440
 and everything's feeding back to the nervous system,

50:33.440 --> 50:34.880
 so it's a two-way street.

50:34.880 --> 50:38.180
 But the simple way to think about it is CB1 receptors

50:38.180 --> 50:40.140
 are mainly in the nervous system

50:40.140 --> 50:42.300
 and CB2 receptors are mainly in the body

50:42.300 --> 50:45.020
 and endogenous cannabinoids.

50:45.020 --> 50:50.020
 Again, EAE, anatomide, and 2AG, arachidinol glycerol,

50:50.540 --> 50:53.460
 are impacting CB1 and CB2 receptors.

50:53.460 --> 50:55.740
 Today, we're mainly going to talk about CB1 receptors

50:55.740 --> 50:57.220
 because they are the ones that are responsible

50:57.220 --> 50:59.780
 for most of the familiar effects of cannabis.

50:59.780 --> 51:02.500
 But the key takeaway at this point

51:02.500 --> 51:05.920
 is to really understand that the major effects

51:05.920 --> 51:08.740
 of your endogenous cannabinoids on these receptors

51:08.740 --> 51:12.220
 in this particular CB1 are very nuanced.

51:12.220 --> 51:14.260
 It depends on context, it depends on which neurons.

51:14.260 --> 51:17.020
 It's sometimes increasing communication between neurons,

51:17.020 --> 51:18.940
 sometimes decreasing it.

51:18.940 --> 51:21.260
 And then along comes cannabis.

51:21.260 --> 51:24.280
 And that cannabis, again, can arrive by smoking,

51:24.280 --> 51:26.780
 by vaping, by edible.

51:26.780 --> 51:30.060
 And cannabis contains THC and CBD

51:30.060 --> 51:34.700
 that potently bind the CB1 receptor.

51:34.700 --> 51:37.900
 And now the effects of the CB1 receptor

51:37.900 --> 51:42.380
 being occupied by THC or being occupied by CBD

51:42.380 --> 51:44.860
 are not very nuanced.

51:44.860 --> 51:47.500
 In fact, they are very predictable.

51:47.500 --> 51:50.120
 And especially important is to understand

51:50.120 --> 51:53.220
 that they are so strong and they park in that receptor

51:53.220 --> 51:56.500
 with such affinity, with such force and precision

51:56.500 --> 51:59.100
 and stubbornness and refusal to leave that receptor

52:00.100 --> 52:02.020
 that they completely out-compete

52:02.020 --> 52:04.100
 the endogenous cannabinoid system.

52:04.100 --> 52:06.440
 In fact, they leave the endogenous cannabinoid system

52:06.440 --> 52:08.440
 essentially dysfunctional,

52:08.440 --> 52:10.920
 which in some cases may be a good thing,

52:10.920 --> 52:14.280
 but in most cases is going to lead to problems

52:14.280 --> 52:15.120
 of various kinds.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.520
 And we'll talk about what sorts of problems.

52:16.520 --> 52:19.140
 And again, I feel obligated to say,

52:19.140 --> 52:23.220
 this is not me saying don't ingest cannabis or THC or CBD.

52:23.220 --> 52:24.400
 That's not what I'm saying.

52:24.400 --> 52:28.020
 What I'm saying is if you evaluate the potency,

52:28.020 --> 52:29.460
 that is in technical terms,

52:29.460 --> 52:32.500
 it would be the affinity with which these compounds,

52:32.500 --> 52:37.220
 THC and CBD and CBN bind to these endogenous receptors.

52:37.220 --> 52:38.820
 That would be like a howitzer gun,

52:38.820 --> 52:43.820
 like a cannon going off as compared to endogenous cannabinoid

52:43.980 --> 52:46.580
 whether or not it's EAE or 2AG,

52:46.580 --> 52:49.700
 which is more like a cap gun level of activation,

52:49.700 --> 52:50.980
 at least in this analogy.

52:50.980 --> 52:53.700
 So now you have what at least I would like to think

52:53.700 --> 52:55.620
 is a fairly complete understanding

52:55.620 --> 52:57.780
 of the different varieties of cannabis,

52:57.780 --> 53:00.380
 at least at a broad sweep

53:00.380 --> 53:03.100
 and the different biological effects that they can have,

53:03.100 --> 53:04.860
 at least in terms of the major receptors

53:04.860 --> 53:07.940
 and in retrograde signaling, et cetera, et cetera.

53:07.940 --> 53:10.500
 Now let's take a step back into the real world

53:10.500 --> 53:12.500
 and evaluate or think about

53:12.500 --> 53:16.140
 what happens when somebody smokes cannabis

53:16.140 --> 53:18.660
 or ingest cannabis by way of edible

53:18.660 --> 53:20.620
 or tincture or something of that sort.

53:22.260 --> 53:25.400
 Cannabis is very fast to enter the bloodstream.

53:26.940 --> 53:28.940
 In fact, within 30 seconds,

53:28.940 --> 53:30.060
 it's going to enter the brain

53:30.060 --> 53:32.320
 and permeate throughout the brain and body.

53:32.320 --> 53:33.720
 That's very, very fast.

53:33.720 --> 53:36.260
 I mean, we contrast that with something like alcohol

53:36.260 --> 53:38.200
 or even nicotine, depending on how the nicotine

53:38.200 --> 53:41.420
 is delivered, that is a very fast delivery

53:41.420 --> 53:44.340
 of the psychoactive and biologically active compound,

53:44.340 --> 53:46.480
 which in this case is THC and CBD

53:46.480 --> 53:48.780
 and probably some other things as well.

53:48.780 --> 53:49.900
 So within 30 seconds,

53:49.900 --> 53:52.920
 it reaches the brain and bodily tissues.

53:52.920 --> 53:56.140
 And within 30 to 60 minutes,

53:56.140 --> 53:58.620
 it's going to reach its peak concentrations

53:58.620 --> 54:00.900
 and have its peak biological effects.

54:00.900 --> 54:01.940
 Those aren't always the same thing,

54:01.940 --> 54:03.660
 but in the case of cannabis,

54:03.660 --> 54:04.780
 and again, here I'm using cannabis

54:04.780 --> 54:07.520
 as a kind of an umbrella term for THC and CBD,

54:07.520 --> 54:10.700
 the effects are going to peak at about 30 to 60 minutes

54:10.700 --> 54:13.380
 after bringing those compounds into the body

54:13.380 --> 54:15.020
 in some way or another.

54:15.020 --> 54:16.360
 And the effects tend to last

54:16.360 --> 54:17.980
 anywhere from three to four hours,

54:17.980 --> 54:19.720
 although there's some variation on that

54:19.720 --> 54:21.860
 depending on individual metabolism,

54:21.860 --> 54:26.340
 whether or not somebody is familiar with the compound,

54:26.340 --> 54:27.780
 believe it or not, psychologically familiar,

54:27.780 --> 54:29.480
 but also biologically familiar,

54:29.480 --> 54:30.780
 or whether or not it's a first time use

54:30.780 --> 54:32.180
 or occasional use and so on.

54:32.180 --> 54:37.180
 THC and CBD and other components of cannabis

54:37.640 --> 54:39.560
 are highly what we call lipophilic.

54:39.560 --> 54:42.360
 That is they have an affinity toward

54:42.360 --> 54:44.480
 and they can actually pass through fatty tissues.

54:44.480 --> 54:45.560
 Now, every cell in your body,

54:45.560 --> 54:48.860
 but especially neurons have a double layer of fat

54:48.860 --> 54:49.960
 on their outside.

54:49.960 --> 54:51.800
 And of course, when people hear fat,

54:51.800 --> 54:54.100
 they always think, ooh, fat's bad, fat's whatever.

54:54.100 --> 54:57.000
 Most of the world seems to want to lose fat or bodily fat.

54:57.000 --> 54:59.840
 Here we're talking about the fatty membrane,

54:59.840 --> 55:01.600
 the barrier around each tissue.

55:01.600 --> 55:04.400
 In this case, we're talking particularly about neurons.

55:04.400 --> 55:08.740
 And THC and CBD and the other components of cannabis

55:08.740 --> 55:10.040
 are highly lipophilic.

55:10.040 --> 55:11.920
 So they can get into essentially all cells

55:11.920 --> 55:13.720
 just simply by flowing into them.

55:13.720 --> 55:17.000
 They will also remain in those cells for a long time.

55:17.000 --> 55:19.320
 So I know that a number of people,

55:19.320 --> 55:21.920
 depending on whether or not they get tested for work

55:21.920 --> 55:26.320
 or for sport or otherwise for cannabis or CBD and THC,

55:27.200 --> 55:28.980
 don't take this as a strict number,

55:28.980 --> 55:33.980
 but typically if one ingests CBD or THC,

55:34.000 --> 55:36.900
 smokes cannabis, ingests orally, et cetera,

55:36.900 --> 55:37.740
 it doesn't matter.

55:37.740 --> 55:39.560
 It's going to stay in that fatty tissue

55:39.560 --> 55:42.960
 and can be detected for at least as long as 80 days

55:42.960 --> 55:43.780
 after ingestion.

55:43.780 --> 55:45.780
 And there's a whole industry as to, you know,

55:45.780 --> 55:47.880
 how to accelerate the clearance.

55:47.880 --> 55:51.280
 And I should just tell you that just losing bodily fat

55:51.280 --> 55:54.360
 isn't going to eliminate it from your system,

55:54.360 --> 55:56.440
 maybe partially in those fat cells,

55:56.440 --> 56:00.440
 but certainly intravisceral fat and other fatty tissue

56:00.440 --> 56:02.380
 that's in and around the brain and body

56:02.380 --> 56:06.700
 is going to harbor that THC molecule and the CBD molecule

56:06.700 --> 56:09.060
 for quite a long while, at least 80 days.

56:09.060 --> 56:12.160
 Okay, so if someone smokes cannabis

56:12.160 --> 56:13.760
 or they ingest cannabis,

56:13.760 --> 56:16.400
 very rapidly gets into the bloodstream

56:16.400 --> 56:18.160
 and the components that are psychoactive

56:18.160 --> 56:19.200
 get into the bloodstream

56:19.200 --> 56:23.560
 and are immediately able to access neurons and other cells

56:23.560 --> 56:25.020
 and start having these effects of parking

56:25.020 --> 56:27.200
 with those endogenous cannabinoid receptors

56:27.200 --> 56:29.480
 and impacting the signaling between neurons,

56:29.480 --> 56:34.000
 which leads to the subjective effects of cannabis,

56:34.000 --> 56:35.300
 including THC and CBD.

56:35.300 --> 56:37.040
 So let's talk about what those different

56:37.040 --> 56:38.520
 subjective effects are.

56:38.520 --> 56:40.480
 Again, this is going to vary depending on whether or not

56:40.480 --> 56:44.700
 people are ingesting sativa varieties of cannabis.

56:44.700 --> 56:47.160
 Just to remind you, those tend to be elevated.

56:47.160 --> 56:48.980
 Mood, alertness, talkativeness,

56:48.980 --> 56:51.740
 people who take sativa varieties tend to talk a lot more

56:51.740 --> 56:53.380
 than they would otherwise.

56:53.380 --> 56:54.800
 Again, there are exceptions to this.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.020
 Of course, there are exceptions.

56:56.020 --> 56:57.360
 I'm sure there are people out there shouting,

56:57.360 --> 56:58.600
 although I guess if you're the quiet people

56:58.600 --> 57:00.440
 who don't talk too much, you're probably not shouting,

57:00.440 --> 57:02.900
 or if you're not, you're not doing sativa.

57:02.900 --> 57:03.740
 Joke intended.

57:03.740 --> 57:05.920
 But in any event, there are exceptions,

57:05.920 --> 57:07.720
 but there are also general rules.

57:07.720 --> 57:09.160
 And the sativas tend to meet people

57:09.160 --> 57:10.880
 sort of mood elevated, energetic,

57:10.880 --> 57:13.040
 again, the sort of head high.

57:13.040 --> 57:16.500
 And indica varieties tend to do the opposite,

57:16.500 --> 57:19.900
 more of a sedative, relaxant, et cetera.

57:19.900 --> 57:21.720
 Why and how would they do that?

57:21.720 --> 57:24.280
 Okay, without going into an extensive deep dive

57:24.280 --> 57:25.840
 into the different neurotransmitter systems

57:25.840 --> 57:27.740
 of the brain and body,

57:27.740 --> 57:30.680
 what we know for sure is that CB1 receptors

57:30.680 --> 57:33.040
 are present on an enormous number of different neurons

57:33.040 --> 57:35.340
 in brain structures and neural circuits,

57:35.340 --> 57:39.760
 so that the sativa varieties that act as sort of a stimulant

57:39.760 --> 57:42.800
 making people feel happy,

57:42.800 --> 57:45.400
 because in general, they do tend to elevate mood,

57:45.400 --> 57:47.480
 at least at certain dosages.

57:47.480 --> 57:50.840
 Talkative tend to make people feel

57:50.840 --> 57:52.760
 like they have ideas that are interesting,

57:52.760 --> 57:54.480
 that they might want to share,

57:54.480 --> 57:55.800
 tend to narrow their context,

57:55.800 --> 57:57.240
 so we tend to increase focus.

57:57.240 --> 57:59.440
 This is something that's not often discussed about cannabis,

57:59.440 --> 58:01.280
 but it can, especially the sativa varieties

58:01.280 --> 58:04.360
 can increase people's level of focus to particular things,

58:04.360 --> 58:06.280
 something they're watching or something they're doing,

58:06.280 --> 58:08.880
 or music allows them to narrow their sense of focus.

58:10.220 --> 58:13.400
 That's going to occur by activation of CB1 receptors

58:13.400 --> 58:14.880
 in the so-called prefrontal cortex,

58:14.880 --> 58:16.540
 which is just behind the forehead.

58:16.540 --> 58:19.840
 And the prefrontal cortex acts as a strong modulator

58:19.840 --> 58:22.580
 of so-called limbic circuitry and other circuitry

58:22.580 --> 58:24.560
 that is more stress-oriented.

58:24.560 --> 58:27.960
 The way to think about the stress and limbic circuitry,

58:27.960 --> 58:30.360
 such as the amygdala, which many people have heard about,

58:30.360 --> 58:33.200
 is that they aren't really circuits for fear and stress.

58:33.200 --> 58:35.360
 They are circuits that are constantly evaluating

58:35.360 --> 58:38.240
 one's own internal state, heart rate, et cetera,

58:38.240 --> 58:40.200
 and what's happening externally.

58:40.200 --> 58:43.360
 And sorry to say, but the default of those systems

58:43.360 --> 58:46.340
 is to detect danger, the sort of threat detection systems.

58:46.340 --> 58:48.500
 And then the prefrontal cortex largely acts

58:48.500 --> 58:50.300
 as a brake on those systems,

58:50.300 --> 58:53.140
 sort of like the reins pulling back on a steed of horses

58:53.140 --> 58:55.440
 that would otherwise just kind of take off.

58:55.440 --> 58:59.280
 And so the sativa varieties tend to increase CB1 activation

58:59.280 --> 59:02.080
 in the prefrontal cortex and in other circuitry

59:02.080 --> 59:05.220
 that then leads to a kind of overall reduction in stress

59:05.220 --> 59:06.660
 because of the way that prefrontal circuitry

59:06.660 --> 59:09.240
 can reduce activation of the amygdala.

59:09.240 --> 59:11.540
 Now that, of course, does not explain

59:11.540 --> 59:14.520
 why some people become very stressed and very paranoid

59:14.520 --> 59:16.160
 when they smoke sativa varieties

59:16.160 --> 59:17.920
 or other varieties of cannabis

59:17.920 --> 59:19.600
 or ingest other varieties of cannabis.

59:19.600 --> 59:22.520
 We will talk about the paranoid effect and why that occurs

59:22.520 --> 59:25.480
 and who might predict that would occur to them in it

59:25.480 --> 59:26.720
 in a little bit.

59:26.720 --> 59:28.920
 But I just want to give you a sense of how this is working

59:28.920 --> 59:31.320
 because as I mentioned before,

59:31.320 --> 59:34.880
 THC and or CBD are going to bind that CB1 receptor,

59:34.880 --> 59:36.040
 let's say in prefrontal cortex

59:36.040 --> 59:38.360
 and neurons of prefrontal cortex is going to bind there.

59:38.360 --> 59:40.320
 And then there'll be a retrograde signaling

59:40.320 --> 59:41.640
 back to the presynaptic neuron.

59:41.640 --> 59:43.420
 And in the case of prefrontal cortex,

59:43.420 --> 59:46.440
 what's happening is it's increasing transmission,

59:46.440 --> 59:48.120
 increasing the release of neurotransmitter

59:48.120 --> 59:49.700
 in prefrontal cortex.

59:49.700 --> 59:51.460
 However, at the same time,

59:53.040 --> 59:56.480
 the very same THC and CBD that was brought into the system

59:56.480 --> 59:59.080
 is binding the very same type of receptors,

59:59.080 --> 1:00:01.260
 CB1 receptors in other brain structures,

1:00:01.260 --> 1:00:02.360
 such as the amygdala

1:00:03.260 --> 1:00:05.760
 and causing retrograde signaling

1:00:05.760 --> 1:00:09.160
 back to the presynaptic neurons in the amygdala,

1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:12.240
 but it's quieting the activation of those neurons.

1:00:13.240 --> 1:00:14.440
 So this is interesting, right?

1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:18.220
 We have the same compounds, THC and or CBD

1:00:18.220 --> 1:00:22.880
 brought into the body and brain binding the same receptors,

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:25.180
 in this case, the CB1 receptors,

1:00:25.180 --> 1:00:28.440
 but depending on where those receptors are located

1:00:28.440 --> 1:00:31.080
 and which brain areas we're referring to,

1:00:31.080 --> 1:00:36.080
 they are either causing heightened levels of alertness

1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:38.540
 and activation of systems that are designed

1:00:38.540 --> 1:00:41.000
 to make you talkative and alertness and mood, et cetera,

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:45.680
 focus, or they are causing suppression of those circuitries.

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:47.680
 So we have kind of a seesaw effect here

1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:49.880
 where the same compound is increasing mood and alertness

1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:51.200
 and focus in the prefrontal cortex

1:00:51.200 --> 1:00:54.480
 and is decreasing stress and threat detection

1:00:54.480 --> 1:00:56.000
 in the amygdala.

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:57.400
 And that's one of the reasons why,

1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:00.340
 especially the sativa varieties of cannabis,

1:01:00.340 --> 1:01:02.760
 allow people to enter these states of focus,

1:01:02.760 --> 1:01:03.920
 some might even say flow,

1:01:03.920 --> 1:01:06.800
 although I don't want to go into what flow states

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:09.180
 really are, that's for a different discussion,

1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:12.600
 and it's very poorly defined as it is.

1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:14.360
 And I certainly don't want to give people the impression

1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:16.040
 that cannabis increases flow states,

1:01:16.040 --> 1:01:18.620
 because that's not always the case,

1:01:18.620 --> 1:01:21.020
 and certainly most often is not going to be the case.

1:01:21.020 --> 1:01:23.120
 But the idea here is that this molecule

1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:26.060
 comes into our brain and is shifting everything

1:01:26.060 --> 1:01:29.240
 towards a state of focus, elevated mood,

1:01:29.240 --> 1:01:30.920
 of heightened sense of importance

1:01:30.920 --> 1:01:32.840
 about whatever it is that we happen to be doing.

1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:35.400
 And now of course, whatever we could happen to be doing

1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:39.180
 could be writing a song, writing poetry,

1:01:39.180 --> 1:01:40.520
 communicating with somebody,

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:42.240
 but it could also be something as trivial

1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:45.840
 as watching cartoons or watching a movie,

1:01:45.840 --> 1:01:48.080
 which is not trivial in its own right,

1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:50.860
 but in terms of thinking about the creative aspects

1:01:50.860 --> 1:01:54.200
 or the creativity stimulating aspects of cannabis,

1:01:54.200 --> 1:01:57.000
 not sort of productivity oriented.

1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.020
 So narrowed focus, elevated mood,

1:01:59.020 --> 1:02:01.200
 more relaxed and yet energetic.

1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:04.120
 That's the major effects of the sativa varieties,

1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:07.000
 except, and this is a really big, bold face,

1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:11.240
 triple underlined except, except in some individuals,

1:02:11.240 --> 1:02:12.320
 depending on dosage,

1:02:12.320 --> 1:02:16.360
 but also depending on preexisting neural circuitry

1:02:16.360 --> 1:02:18.240
 and propensity for anxiety,

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:22.000
 some people ingest or smoke sativa varieties,

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.920
 and regardless of whether or not it's a type one,

1:02:23.920 --> 1:02:25.940
 type two or type three variety, okay,

1:02:25.940 --> 1:02:29.120
 regardless of the ratio between THC and CBD,

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:33.920
 people will experience intense anxiety and paranoia.

1:02:33.920 --> 1:02:35.600
 Now, how do you predict

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:38.160
 who will experience intense anxiety and paranoia

1:02:38.160 --> 1:02:40.800
 and who will experience intense relaxation,

1:02:40.800 --> 1:02:45.200
 focus and sense of creativity from ingesting or smoking

1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:47.920
 a type one, type two or type three sativa?

1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:50.520
 Well, there is no way to predict that.

1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:52.960
 And there's a lot of kind of what I would call street lore

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:57.860
 or dorm room lore or kind of peer, not peer reviewed,

1:02:57.860 --> 1:03:00.440
 but sort of peer discussed,

1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:03.040
 I mean, among friends and people in acquaintances,

1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:05.840
 lore out there that what one needs to do

1:03:05.840 --> 1:03:07.680
 is simply smoke more, right?

1:03:07.680 --> 1:03:09.480
 Or just ingest more, you hear that.

1:03:09.480 --> 1:03:11.040
 Oh, well, listen, if it makes you paranoid,

1:03:11.040 --> 1:03:12.320
 you simply need to use more.

1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:14.800
 That is absolutely categorically false.

1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:18.160
 Everything we know about the way that THC and CBD work

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:20.020
 is that they tend to potentiate,

1:03:20.020 --> 1:03:25.020
 that is increase the effects of these different systems

1:03:25.500 --> 1:03:27.240
 at given synapses and in different areas

1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:28.080
 of the brain and body.

1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:32.880
 That is if someone experiences paranoia or anxiety

1:03:32.880 --> 1:03:37.100
 from a given strain of the marijuana plant

1:03:37.100 --> 1:03:39.240
 or from ingesting an edible in a particular way

1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:40.800
 or a particular kind of edible,

1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:44.800
 that person is very likely to experience the same effect

1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:47.400
 every time they ingest that strain or variety.

1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:52.000
 This is part of what's led to this enormous industry.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:53.080
 I mean, there are a number of different reasons,

1:03:53.080 --> 1:03:55.200
 but this is part of what's led to this enormous industry

1:03:55.200 --> 1:03:58.520
 of highly customized cannabis,

1:03:58.520 --> 1:04:00.240
 where people will spend some time

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:02.680
 really seeking out the different strains of cannabis

1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:07.000
 and hybrids of cannabis that work best for them

1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.640
 and work best for them in particular context.

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:12.800
 I wish I could tell you that if you are a person

1:04:12.800 --> 1:04:16.280
 who is between five foot seven and six feet tall

1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:19.400
 and you have blue eyes or brown eyes,

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:21.780
 that the sativa varieties are going to be right for you

1:04:21.780 --> 1:04:23.080
 or that the sativa varieties

1:04:23.080 --> 1:04:24.400
 are going to give you panic attacks.

1:04:24.400 --> 1:04:25.440
 I can't do that.

1:04:25.440 --> 1:04:27.120
 The only way to determine it would be

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:30.160
 to actually experience ingesting those or smoking those,

1:04:30.160 --> 1:04:32.440
 which is certainly also not what I'm suggesting, right?

1:04:32.440 --> 1:04:33.280
 That's up to you.

1:04:33.280 --> 1:04:35.200
 I'm not telling you what to do or what not to do,

1:04:35.200 --> 1:04:36.960
 but there are no good predictors.

1:04:36.960 --> 1:04:39.920
 In fact, if you look in the literature,

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:41.520
 it is not at all clear that people

1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:44.440
 who have a heightened level of anxiety

1:04:44.440 --> 1:04:47.000
 when they do not smoke cannabis

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:52.000
 will experience cannabis as less paranoia inducing

1:04:52.360 --> 1:04:53.200
 or more relaxing.

1:04:53.200 --> 1:04:55.180
 That's simply not the case.

1:04:55.180 --> 1:04:57.920
 Now, what we can say for sure

1:04:57.920 --> 1:05:00.760
 is that general categories of effects,

1:05:00.760 --> 1:05:03.600
 such as increased focus and reduced anxiety

1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:05.420
 are largely due to activation of areas

1:05:05.420 --> 1:05:06.860
 like the prefrontal cortex.

1:05:06.860 --> 1:05:10.180
 Now, unlike other compounds like nicotine or alcohol

1:05:10.180 --> 1:05:12.160
 or neurotransmitter systems like dopamine,

1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:14.400
 when we talk about the cannabinoid system

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:18.960
 and I say effects, biological effects, psychoactive effects,

1:05:18.960 --> 1:05:21.640
 I want you to keep in mind always, please, please, please,

1:05:21.640 --> 1:05:25.480
 keep in mind that those effects can be varied

1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:28.680
 and often opposite in direction.

1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:30.860
 So let's just give an example of that.

1:05:30.860 --> 1:05:34.780
 I just mentioned that when people smoke or eat sativa,

1:05:34.780 --> 1:05:37.640
 that it tends to lead to one specific set of,

1:05:37.640 --> 1:05:40.560
 or generally leads to one specific set of effects,

1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:41.920
 heightened focus, mood, et cetera.

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:45.640
 Whereas when they ingest or smoke indica

1:05:45.640 --> 1:05:47.320
 and its components, right?

1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:49.860
 Again, we're still talking about THC and CBD

1:05:49.860 --> 1:05:53.600
 in varying ratios, but now indica cannabis

1:05:53.600 --> 1:05:56.240
 and say, well, why would it improve

1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:58.160
 the transition time to sleep?

1:05:58.160 --> 1:05:59.480
 Or at least give people the impression

1:05:59.480 --> 1:06:01.020
 that it improved the transition time to sleep.

1:06:01.020 --> 1:06:03.200
 We'll talk about what indica actually does for sleep

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:04.440
 in a little bit.

1:06:04.440 --> 1:06:07.360
 But indica also tends to suppress activation

1:06:07.360 --> 1:06:09.600
 of the amygdala and threat detection centers in the brain.

1:06:09.600 --> 1:06:11.560
 Again, binding the same CB1 receptors

1:06:11.560 --> 1:06:13.640
 and those retrograde signaling mechanisms

1:06:13.640 --> 1:06:15.120
 that talked about before.

1:06:15.120 --> 1:06:18.320
 But it also tends to shut down the hippocampus,

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:21.720
 an area of the brain associated with memory,

1:06:21.720 --> 1:06:26.040
 which is why indica varieties lead to pronounced,

1:06:26.040 --> 1:06:29.400
 or I should say profound defects in short-term memory

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:31.040
 and sometimes in long-term memory as well

1:06:31.040 --> 1:06:33.880
 if it's consumed over long periods of time.

1:06:33.880 --> 1:06:36.200
 We'll talk about short, medium and long-term consumption,

1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:38.000
 occasional consumption going forward.

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:39.080
 So what I'd like you to take away

1:06:39.080 --> 1:06:40.860
 from this component of the discussion is,

1:06:40.860 --> 1:06:43.900
 first of all, the mechanism of action

1:06:43.900 --> 1:06:48.280
 by which cannabis impacts the brain and body,

1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:49.680
 but in particular, the brain is going to be

1:06:49.680 --> 1:06:52.420
 through CB1 receptors and those CB1 receptors

1:06:52.420 --> 1:06:55.000
 can lead to either an acceleration or a break

1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:56.680
 on particular biological mechanisms.

1:06:56.680 --> 1:06:59.600
 And there are going to be a constellation

1:06:59.600 --> 1:07:01.960
 of different accelerations and breaking

1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:05.160
 of different neural systems in the brain and body,

1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:07.920
 depending on whether or not people ingest sativa

1:07:07.920 --> 1:07:10.360
 or indica or some hybrid strain.

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.860
 And perhaps most importantly,

1:07:11.860 --> 1:07:13.600
 even if you didn't understand anything that I've said

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:15.360
 about the biology of these different strains

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:17.520
 and the receptors, please do understand

1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:21.720
 that there is no way to predict what the effect

1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:24.340
 of a given strain will be on an individual.

1:07:24.340 --> 1:07:26.720
 There has been extensive exploration

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:29.340
 as to whether or not people who are so-called mellower

1:07:29.340 --> 1:07:32.280
 or more anxious or any number

1:07:32.280 --> 1:07:35.240
 of different personality dimensions will respond

1:07:35.240 --> 1:07:36.120
 in one way or the other.

1:07:36.120 --> 1:07:38.580
 But in fact, there is no way to tell.

1:07:38.580 --> 1:07:43.240
 Layer on top of that, the fact that dosing THC and CBD

1:07:43.240 --> 1:07:46.320
 can be fairly straightforward in the form of edibles, right?

1:07:46.320 --> 1:07:50.240
 Because there can be, at least if it's a controlled source,

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:53.560
 a defined number of milligrams of THC,

1:07:53.560 --> 1:07:55.960
 a defined number of milligrams of CBD,

1:07:55.960 --> 1:07:57.920
 that's true for ingestibles.

1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:00.120
 It's much harder to gauge that

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:02.540
 from the smokable forms of cannabis,

1:08:02.540 --> 1:08:04.980
 especially if those smokable forms of cannabis are obtained

1:08:04.980 --> 1:08:08.160
 through sources where there isn't a lot of clear information

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:11.240
 about the total amount of THC in that product.

1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:13.280
 Now, this is all changing quite a lot nowadays

1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:17.520
 because of the commercialization of THC and CBD products

1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:19.520
 and cannabis in a number of different areas,

1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:21.220
 including in the United States.

1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:24.960
 But still many people are ingesting cannabis, THC, CBD

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.200
 through sources where they don't really know

1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:28.040
 how much they're bringing into their system.

1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:30.640
 And so whether or not someone gets

1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:34.040
 incredible anxiety relief, enhanced sense of mood

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:37.060
 and focus and wellbeing, pain relief, et cetera,

1:08:37.060 --> 1:08:39.640
 or whether or not they have full-blown panic attacks,

1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:42.920
 et cetera, is very hard to predict

1:08:42.920 --> 1:08:45.200
 based on dosage information alone.

1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:47.700
 Now, of course, we can create broad categories

1:08:47.700 --> 1:08:48.900
 and we were going to talk about studies

1:08:48.900 --> 1:08:50.900
 that create broad categories of low dose,

1:08:50.900 --> 1:08:54.920
 moderate dose and high dose, frequent use and infrequent use

1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:57.740
 but unlike alcohol, unlike nicotine,

1:08:57.740 --> 1:09:00.620
 we can't really point to specificity

1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:04.720
 of X amount of alcohol, grams of alcohol per week,

1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:07.720
 which is safe or X amount of alcohol, which is not safe.

1:09:07.720 --> 1:09:10.220
 And so I know a lot of people out there are wondering,

1:09:10.220 --> 1:09:13.260
 how often can they smoke cannabis

1:09:13.260 --> 1:09:16.860
 or how often can they eat cannabis or THC or CBD

1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:21.220
 in any number of its different forms and products safely?

1:09:21.220 --> 1:09:23.740
 Well, we have to really define what safely means

1:09:23.740 --> 1:09:25.240
 and we have to really acknowledge

1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:29.420
 that there's a pretty loose set of controls

1:09:29.420 --> 1:09:32.500
 over what one is bringing into their brain and body

1:09:32.500 --> 1:09:35.180
 as they ingest THC and CBD.

1:09:35.180 --> 1:09:38.440
 But even under conditions in which it's very controlled,

1:09:38.440 --> 1:09:41.040
 it's very hard to predict what those effects will be.

1:09:41.040 --> 1:09:44.960
 So before moving into specifics of taking cannabis

1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:46.760
 or not taking cannabis, who should, who shouldn't,

1:09:46.760 --> 1:09:49.180
 what the medicinal purposes are

1:09:49.180 --> 1:09:52.580
 and what some of the newer exciting data point to,

1:09:52.580 --> 1:09:53.900
 I just briefly want to make a list

1:09:53.900 --> 1:09:56.620
 and I promise very briefly, I know I'm not often concise

1:09:56.620 --> 1:09:59.380
 but I do try to be thorough for your sake.

1:09:59.380 --> 1:10:03.320
 I want to make a very brief list of the different brain areas

1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:06.580
 that are impacted by THC and CBD

1:10:06.580 --> 1:10:10.160
 and why THC and CBD have the various effects they do.

1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:15.160
 When somebody smokes or ingests cannabis,

1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:21.480
 doesn't matter what the THC or CBD ratio is,

1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:26.720
 if they experience deficits in memory

1:10:26.720 --> 1:10:29.780
 and that's almost always present,

1:10:29.780 --> 1:10:31.720
 that's going to be because of reductions

1:10:31.720 --> 1:10:33.760
 in electrical activity within this brain region

1:10:33.760 --> 1:10:35.400
 we call the hippocampus, okay?

1:10:35.400 --> 1:10:37.560
 Hippocampus means seahorse, it's shaped like a seahorse,

1:10:37.560 --> 1:10:40.400
 anatomists like to name things after what things look like

1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:43.420
 but hippocampus memory, memory is reduced

1:10:43.420 --> 1:10:45.000
 in particular short-term memory.

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.820
 That's true regardless of whether or not

1:10:46.820 --> 1:10:50.980
 one is using sativa, indica or some hybrid.

1:10:52.540 --> 1:10:57.280
 In general, the prefrontal cortex is going to be activated

1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:00.060
 by the sativa varieties, which is going to increase thinking

1:11:00.060 --> 1:11:04.240
 and narrowly constrain focus to some activity

1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:05.680
 and that's more commonly associated

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:07.040
 with the sativa varieties.

1:11:07.040 --> 1:11:09.160
 The indica varieties, as I mentioned before,

1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:11.200
 tend to lead to a suppression of activity

1:11:11.200 --> 1:11:13.440
 in prefrontal cortex, believe it or not,

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:15.640
 and turn off thinking and planning.

1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:20.360
 This is why indica varieties are often used for relaxation

1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:21.920
 and for promoting sleep.

1:11:23.560 --> 1:11:26.420
 Regardless of whether or not sativa or indica variety,

1:11:27.360 --> 1:11:30.760
 and again, regardless of the ratio of THC to CBD,

1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:33.760
 there is a general suppression of neural circuits

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:35.960
 within the so-called basal ganglia and cerebellum.

1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:38.520
 Basal ganglia and cerebellum are areas of the brain

1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:41.120
 that are involved in action planning and withholding action,

1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:42.280
 so that would be the basal ganglia,

1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:44.800
 so-called go-no-go circuitry,

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:47.400
 and the cerebellum, which is involved in balance

1:11:47.400 --> 1:11:50.020
 but also motor planning and motor sequencing.

1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:54.700
 This is why people who smoke marijuana,

1:11:55.580 --> 1:11:57.040
 regardless of the strain,

1:11:57.040 --> 1:12:00.020
 will tend to be less physically mobile.

1:12:00.020 --> 1:12:02.520
 Other common effects are reddening of the eyes,

1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:03.440
 dryness of the mouth,

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:06.280
 that's actually caused by the same general mechanism,

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:09.320
 which is a reduction in the secretion of saliva

1:12:09.320 --> 1:12:12.420
 and of sort of tears and lubrication of the eyes

1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:14.180
 from the lacrimal glands of the eyes

1:12:14.180 --> 1:12:17.760
 because of the presence of largely CB2,

1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:21.380
 but also CB1 receptors in the mouth and on the eyes.

1:12:21.380 --> 1:12:23.340
 And there tends to be,

1:12:23.340 --> 1:12:26.040
 especially with certain strains of cannabis,

1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:28.840
 increase in appetite, so-called munchies,

1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:33.420
 and that has everything to do with very, very high density

1:12:33.420 --> 1:12:35.600
 of CB1 receptors in the hypothalamus,

1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:37.360
 and in particular areas of the hypothalamus,

1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:39.860
 like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus,

1:12:39.860 --> 1:12:41.640
 other areas as well, of course,

1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:46.440
 that have tons of CB1 receptors, bind THC and CBD,

1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:49.760
 and activate the neurons that strongly stimulate appetite

1:12:49.760 --> 1:12:51.260
 through two mechanisms.

1:12:51.260 --> 1:12:55.140
 One is a cognitive mechanism of creating a preoccupation

1:12:55.140 --> 1:12:58.000
 with food and anticipation of taste,

1:12:58.000 --> 1:12:59.840
 as well as the experience of taste,

1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:04.200
 so the narrowing of focus to what you want to go eat, right?

1:13:04.200 --> 1:13:06.880
 You really crave, I don't know, pizza,

1:13:06.880 --> 1:13:08.680
 it seems to be high fat, high carbohydrate foods,

1:13:08.680 --> 1:13:13.680
 but really crave pizza and narrowing of focus

1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:15.160
 so that you're not thinking about anything else,

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:18.920
 but also signaling from the hypothalamus to the gut

1:13:18.920 --> 1:13:21.320
 to neurons within the stomach itself

1:13:21.320 --> 1:13:23.040
 that regulate blood sugar.

1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:27.840
 So there are strong effects on blood sugar of THC and CBD

1:13:27.840 --> 1:13:29.960
 that generally lead to increases in appetite.

1:13:29.960 --> 1:13:32.680
 So two parallel mechanisms, one within the brain,

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:34.880
 one within the body, increasing appetite.

1:13:34.880 --> 1:13:36.320
 So there's an array of different effects.

1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:37.600
 And as I mentioned before,

1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:41.100
 CB1 receptors are present all over the nervous system

1:13:41.100 --> 1:13:42.200
 in the brain, the spinal cord.

1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:44.920
 In fact, the presence of CB1 receptors in the spinal cord

1:13:44.920 --> 1:13:48.300
 largely explains the fact that THC and CBD,

1:13:48.300 --> 1:13:50.360
 to some extent, although it's not very well studied,

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:52.440
 can provide some pain relief.

1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:55.760
 I say some because a lot of people perceive

1:13:55.760 --> 1:13:58.480
 or believe that they experience more pain relief

1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:00.680
 from cannabis than they actually do.

1:14:00.680 --> 1:14:03.260
 It actually has a lot to do with a perceptual shift

1:14:03.260 --> 1:14:04.920
 to basically focusing on other things,

1:14:04.920 --> 1:14:08.360
 but there does seem to be some anti-nociceptive,

1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:13.000
 meaning anti-pain effects of cannabis, THC in particular,

1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.400
 and that is exerted largely through effects

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:19.700
 on CB1 receptors in neurons of the spinal cord.

1:14:19.700 --> 1:14:21.960
 So a broad array of effects are taking place

1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:23.320
 regardless of what strain you take

1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:25.500
 and whether or not you eat the cannabis

1:14:25.500 --> 1:14:26.960
 or you smoke the cannabis.

1:14:26.960 --> 1:14:30.000
 And the broad array of effects can be explained by the fact

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.240
 that that retrograde signaling can lead to activation

1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:34.920
 or suppression of activity in various neurons.

1:14:34.920 --> 1:14:36.520
 So now I'd like to take a step back

1:14:36.520 --> 1:14:39.040
 from the biology of cannabis and THC and CBD

1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:41.000
 and all the signaling and receptors, et cetera,

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.120
 and really just focus on cannabis use.

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:45.280
 And wherever possible,

1:14:45.280 --> 1:14:48.680
 I will point to the specific strains that have been studied

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:51.200
 and the ratios of THC to CBD.

1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:54.260
 But I have to say that unfortunately,

1:14:54.260 --> 1:14:57.460
 most studies of marijuana of cannabis,

1:14:57.460 --> 1:14:59.800
 while they have been very careful

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:02.440
 to detail the amount of THC,

1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:03.960
 low dose, medium dose, or high dose,

1:15:03.960 --> 1:15:05.060
 and actually getting very specific,

1:15:05.060 --> 1:15:06.320
 right down to the number of milligrams

1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:08.280
 or even how much circulating THC is present

1:15:08.280 --> 1:15:13.280
 after somebody smokes a joint or ingests cannabis,

1:15:13.360 --> 1:15:15.960
 most studies have not distinguished

1:15:15.960 --> 1:15:19.880
 between sativa and indica strains.

1:15:19.880 --> 1:15:22.160
 And that's unfortunate because in the real world,

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:25.440
 people are distinguishing between sativa and indica strains

1:15:25.440 --> 1:15:27.240
 in their patterns of use and what they prefer

1:15:27.240 --> 1:15:28.120
 and what they don't prefer,

1:15:28.120 --> 1:15:30.280
 even what they prefer to smoke during the day

1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:31.640
 or ingest during the day versus night.

1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:32.480
 Believe it or not, there are people

1:15:32.480 --> 1:15:34.840
 who are using certain strains during the day

1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:36.200
 and other strains at night.

1:15:37.260 --> 1:15:39.640
 But the science is yet to catch up to that.

1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:42.760
 Or I should say more accurately,

1:15:42.760 --> 1:15:45.380
 the general public and the themes that are emerging

1:15:45.380 --> 1:15:47.960
 and the practices that are emerging around cannabis,

1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:51.240
 especially in states where it's decriminalized or legalized,

1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:52.600
 are occurring at such a rapid rate

1:15:52.600 --> 1:15:53.800
 that there's absolutely no way

1:15:53.800 --> 1:15:55.120
 that the science could keep up.

1:15:55.120 --> 1:15:57.200
 This is a naturally occurring experiment.

1:15:57.200 --> 1:15:59.080
 Not to say that it's natural, like people should do it,

1:15:59.080 --> 1:16:01.160
 but it's an experiment that's happening in real time

1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:02.100
 in the real world,

1:16:02.100 --> 1:16:05.080
 much faster than controlled studies

1:16:05.080 --> 1:16:06.360
 within university laboratories

1:16:06.360 --> 1:16:07.920
 and other laboratories can keep up.

1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:10.680
 So at this point, I think it's appropriate to ask ourselves,

1:16:10.680 --> 1:16:12.760
 why do people even use cannabis?

1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:14.060
 I mean, what are they trying to achieve?

1:16:14.060 --> 1:16:16.380
 Is it always about not feeling pain?

1:16:16.380 --> 1:16:18.360
 Is it always about reducing anxiety?

1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:19.260
 Well, sometimes it is,

1:16:19.260 --> 1:16:21.520
 but oftentimes people are using cannabis

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:23.840
 in order to achieve a particular state.

1:16:23.840 --> 1:16:25.960
 And we could use a broad brush and say,

1:16:25.960 --> 1:16:27.920
 well, they just like being high,

1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:30.680
 but while that may be true in a lot of circumstances,

1:16:31.520 --> 1:16:33.260
 and I have to believe it actually is true

1:16:33.260 --> 1:16:35.400
 in a lot of circumstances,

1:16:35.400 --> 1:16:37.900
 there are a lot of people who use cannabis

1:16:37.900 --> 1:16:39.480
 in a very directed way,

1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:43.000
 or they get quote unquote high in order to achieve states

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.440
 that to them are particularly attractive.

1:16:45.440 --> 1:16:49.080
 And one such state is a state of creativity.

1:16:49.080 --> 1:16:51.080
 And this brings us to a broader theme,

1:16:51.080 --> 1:16:54.360
 which is does cannabis increase creativity?

1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:56.720
 And if so, is it the THC, the CBD?

1:16:56.720 --> 1:16:58.080
 What's the appropriate ratio

1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:00.880
 or the best ratio for accessing creativity?

1:17:00.880 --> 1:17:02.840
 This is an interesting and important discussion, I believe,

1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:05.880
 because creativity is one of the more sought after

1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:08.800
 and more elusive states that humans can experience.

1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:11.200
 And yet, if you look at human evolution,

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:12.960
 you look at our progression

1:17:12.960 --> 1:17:16.000
 in terms of technology development and culture

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.400
 and music and poetry, et cetera,

1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:21.680
 we really can look to creativity as the state

1:17:21.680 --> 1:17:24.580
 that fostered so much of that evolution.

1:17:24.580 --> 1:17:26.460
 So whether or not you're into technology

1:17:26.460 --> 1:17:28.200
 or you're into art or music,

1:17:28.200 --> 1:17:29.440
 whether or not you're just somebody

1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:31.800
 who wants to expand their understanding

1:17:31.800 --> 1:17:33.700
 or their experience of life in some way,

1:17:33.700 --> 1:17:37.140
 creativity is a fundamentally important state

1:17:37.140 --> 1:17:39.440
 to try and access and to try and access regularly

1:17:39.440 --> 1:17:40.720
 and to try and tap into

1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:43.320
 in order to eventually produce something,

1:17:43.320 --> 1:17:45.560
 in order to create something of meaning that exists,

1:17:45.560 --> 1:17:47.040
 not just in that creative state,

1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:50.960
 but to yourself after that creative state has gone away.

1:17:50.960 --> 1:17:52.880
 So the painting that you paint in the creative state

1:17:52.880 --> 1:17:55.040
 hopefully is a painting that still inspires

1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:58.340
 and has impact after you exit that creative state

1:17:58.340 --> 1:17:59.800
 and that will inspire others.

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:01.840
 And this could be true for any number of different things,

1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:03.220
 not just painting.

1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:06.080
 So does cannabis increase creativity?

1:18:06.080 --> 1:18:08.420
 The short answer is it depends.

1:18:08.420 --> 1:18:10.620
 First of all, we need to define creativity.

1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:12.780
 Here we are as thinking as scientists,

1:18:12.780 --> 1:18:14.560
 if not already scientists.

1:18:14.560 --> 1:18:17.320
 And there are basically two modes of thinking

1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:18.720
 that are associated with creativity

1:18:18.720 --> 1:18:21.420
 and they don't completely explain creativity.

1:18:21.420 --> 1:18:23.760
 But if you look in the research, the psychology research

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:25.300
 and the neuroscience research,

1:18:25.300 --> 1:18:28.400
 you'll hear about convergent thinking

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:29.680
 and divergent thinking.

1:18:30.860 --> 1:18:34.380
 Convergent thinking is taking loose ideas

1:18:34.380 --> 1:18:36.680
 and kind of braiding them together,

1:18:36.680 --> 1:18:38.840
 finding a common thread,

1:18:38.840 --> 1:18:41.920
 synthesizing and organizing those different ideas

1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:45.200
 into some common or specific framework

1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:49.140
 in order to get or create some specific outcome.

1:18:49.140 --> 1:18:53.340
 So convergent thinking is basically the person in the room

1:18:53.340 --> 1:18:56.860
 who's listening to all the ideas and taking them all in.

1:18:56.860 --> 1:19:01.860
 Maybe it's a panel of how should we get a certain product

1:19:02.120 --> 1:19:06.060
 out to market or what are the different motifs

1:19:06.060 --> 1:19:07.840
 that we should include in a piece of music?

1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:12.360
 Or what should we do in terms of re-architecting

1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:14.080
 a given physical space,

1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:15.580
 taking in those different opinions,

1:19:15.580 --> 1:19:17.520
 those different ideas from different people,

1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:21.240
 and then synthesizing them and coming up with one

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:24.240
 or a small subset of coherent ideas that incorporate

1:19:24.240 --> 1:19:26.080
 some or all of the ones that they heard.

1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:27.360
 Okay, so that's convergent thinking.

1:19:27.360 --> 1:19:31.240
 It doesn't have to involve a panel of people talking to you.

1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:33.640
 I use that as an example of what goes on

1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:34.480
 inside your own head

1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:36.200
 when you are engaging in convergent thinking.

1:19:36.200 --> 1:19:38.720
 You're thinking, well, so-and-so said this,

1:19:38.720 --> 1:19:40.680
 and I think that, and you're kind of braiding them through

1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:43.200
 and trying to get some common theme,

1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:45.960
 some common vector to emerge from that.

1:19:45.960 --> 1:19:48.320
 Divergent thinking on the other hand

1:19:48.320 --> 1:19:50.440
 is best described as brainstorming.

1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:53.120
 It's exploring ideas and continuing to move

1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:56.840
 into the variation and the vastness of ideas

1:19:56.840 --> 1:19:59.000
 in hopes of eventually being able to converge

1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:01.640
 on some novel idea or framework, okay?

1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:03.080
 So these are similar and related,

1:20:03.080 --> 1:20:04.960
 but typically the creativity process

1:20:04.960 --> 1:20:08.960
 involves first brainstorming and divergent thinking,

1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:11.240
 and then in order to arrive at something

1:20:11.240 --> 1:20:12.960
 to actually create something, right?

1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:15.680
 The verb create, not just thinking about

1:20:15.680 --> 1:20:18.400
 what you might create, which occurs during divergent thinking

1:20:18.400 --> 1:20:21.200
 but actually creating something, a specific painting,

1:20:21.200 --> 1:20:25.480
 a specific song, a specific body of literature,

1:20:25.480 --> 1:20:28.580
 a specific scientific project or experiment, and so on.

1:20:29.720 --> 1:20:32.920
 That usually involves convergent thinking.

1:20:32.920 --> 1:20:35.600
 Now, these can be explored in the laboratory

1:20:35.600 --> 1:20:37.240
 and they can be explored in the laboratories

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:39.240
 through sets of different types of questionnaires

1:20:39.240 --> 1:20:41.200
 or even tasks that you can give human subjects,

1:20:41.200 --> 1:20:43.280
 and this has been done extensively.

1:20:43.280 --> 1:20:47.000
 And across the entire body of data,

1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.740
 and by that, I mean literally hundreds of studies

1:20:49.740 --> 1:20:50.900
 that have explored the relationship

1:20:50.900 --> 1:20:53.120
 between particular neural circuits and neurochemicals,

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:55.720
 convergent and divergent thinking,

1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:57.680
 we can arrive at a principle.

1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:01.140
 And the principle involves a molecule

1:21:01.140 --> 1:21:02.460
 that many of you have heard about before,

1:21:02.460 --> 1:21:03.300
 which is dopamine.

1:21:03.300 --> 1:21:06.160
 Dopamine is a neuromodulator, it's involved in motivation,

1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:08.980
 and it tends to direct our attention to things outside of us

1:21:08.980 --> 1:21:12.140
 but it's also closely related to convergent thinking

1:21:12.140 --> 1:21:15.080
 and divergent thinking and to the creative process.

1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:17.620
 And therefore, it should come as no surprise

1:21:17.620 --> 1:21:21.040
 that diseases of the nervous system, excuse me,

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:23.000
 such as bipolar disorder,

1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:25.800
 which we've done an episode all about bipolar disorder,

1:21:25.800 --> 1:21:29.720
 or schizophrenia, or mood disorders

1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:31.760
 that impact the levels of dopamine,

1:21:31.760 --> 1:21:35.840
 either make it way, way too high or way, way too low,

1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:38.520
 strongly impact whether or not people will be creative.

1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:40.120
 And I think the short takeaway

1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:42.600
 that makes the most sense in terms of framing this,

1:21:42.600 --> 1:21:45.360
 and we cover this on the episode on bipolar disorder,

1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:47.160
 sometimes called bipolar depression,

1:21:47.160 --> 1:21:48.720
 is that in professions

1:21:48.720 --> 1:21:50.840
 where there's a lot of creativity required

1:21:50.840 --> 1:21:52.280
 in order to succeed, so again,

1:21:52.280 --> 1:21:55.220
 musicians, composers, artists, et cetera,

1:21:55.220 --> 1:21:57.880
 you tend to find more manic depression

1:21:57.880 --> 1:22:00.880
 and manic depression, at least in the manic states,

1:22:00.880 --> 1:22:03.560
 the hyperactive states are correlated

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:05.480
 with elevated levels of dopamine.

1:22:06.480 --> 1:22:10.680
 Likewise, it has been seen over and over throughout history

1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:13.480
 that individuals that have mild forms of schizophrenia

1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:15.640
 or even full-blown schizophrenia,

1:22:15.640 --> 1:22:18.920
 many famous painters, for instance, or musicians,

1:22:18.920 --> 1:22:21.580
 they are known to have elevated levels of dopamine

1:22:21.580 --> 1:22:22.740
 and they are quite creative.

1:22:22.740 --> 1:22:24.500
 Now, that doesn't mean everybody who's creative

1:22:24.500 --> 1:22:26.280
 has elevated levels of dopamine,

1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:28.500
 although it's likely that their levels of dopamine

1:22:28.500 --> 1:22:29.620
 are at least not diminished.

1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:31.440
 And it doesn't mean that non-creative people

1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:32.560
 have low levels of dopamine,

1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:34.780
 so don't get carried away with the interpretation here.

1:22:34.780 --> 1:22:35.880
 But the point is this.

1:22:36.960 --> 1:22:41.080
 Dopamine levels strongly relate to the probability

1:22:41.080 --> 1:22:43.960
 that you can engage in convergent and divergent thinking,

1:22:43.960 --> 1:22:45.840
 and they do so in the following way.

1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:49.000
 When dopamine levels are high,

1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:51.140
 divergent thinking is more likely.

1:22:51.140 --> 1:22:53.760
 That is, when people have a lot of dopamine circulating

1:22:53.760 --> 1:22:54.880
 in their system,

1:22:54.880 --> 1:22:57.460
 they tend to be very expansive with their ideas.

1:22:57.460 --> 1:22:58.680
 They tend to brainstorm a lot.

1:22:58.680 --> 1:23:02.520
 They tend to be comfortable and even want to,

1:23:02.520 --> 1:23:05.260
 or reflexively, throw out a lot of ideas

1:23:05.260 --> 1:23:07.860
 that sometimes even seem a little disconnected.

1:23:07.860 --> 1:23:09.120
 Some people might think of this

1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:11.520
 as kind of attention deficit, but it's not.

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:16.040
 It's really the idea of throwing out disparate ideas, right?

1:23:16.040 --> 1:23:17.440
 You know, you hear sometimes, you know,

1:23:17.440 --> 1:23:19.360
 you throw things against the wall and see what sticks.

1:23:19.360 --> 1:23:21.960
 Well, these people, that's obviously an analogy,

1:23:21.960 --> 1:23:25.120
 but people are throwing lots of things against the wall

1:23:25.120 --> 1:23:26.240
 and seeing what stick,

1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:28.480
 and then seeing how the things that stick fit together.

1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:29.720
 That's divergent thinking,

1:23:29.720 --> 1:23:31.600
 and elevations in dopamine

1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:34.040
 tend to increase divergent thinking.

1:23:34.040 --> 1:23:36.160
 However, they tend to do this

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:38.680
 in kind of an inverted U-shape way.

1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:39.860
 For those of you that are watching on YouTube,

1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:42.320
 I'm just drawing kind of a hump, obviously,

1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:45.320
 and for those of you listening, just imagine a U,

1:23:45.320 --> 1:23:48.080
 the shape of a letter U, and then just flip it upside down

1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:49.680
 so it looks like a bump.

1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:51.660
 Turns out that when dopamine levels are very low,

1:23:51.660 --> 1:23:53.820
 there's a low probability of divergent thinking.

1:23:53.820 --> 1:23:56.080
 When dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before,

1:23:56.080 --> 1:23:59.140
 there's a high level or probability of divergent thinking.

1:23:59.140 --> 1:24:02.480
 But when dopamine levels go very, very high,

1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:05.480
 then there's, again, a reduction in divergent thinking.

1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:07.840
 In other words, there's a kind of a sweet spot

1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:10.320
 of elevated dopamine for divergent thinking.

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:12.040
 And again, divergent thinking

1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:14.480
 is critical for the creativity process

1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:16.600
 because creativity, by definition,

1:24:16.600 --> 1:24:19.200
 is taking a novel set of ideas

1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:21.200
 and arranging them in a particular way,

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:25.180
 or taking existing ideas and arranging them in a novel way

1:24:25.180 --> 1:24:28.120
 that then you eventually converge on some new product,

1:24:28.120 --> 1:24:29.700
 new idea, new song, et cetera.

1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:33.960
 Now, convergent thinking follows a very different pattern.

1:24:34.920 --> 1:24:36.480
 When dopamine levels are high,

1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:39.560
 convergent thinking is not very likely.

1:24:39.560 --> 1:24:41.320
 And when dopamine levels are low,

1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:43.040
 convergent thinking is very likely.

1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:47.040
 So here, using arguably a very reductionist view,

1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:48.560
 we're looking at all of this thing of,

1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:49.400
 we're calling creativity

1:24:49.400 --> 1:24:51.680
 through a very neurosciency reductionist lens,

1:24:51.680 --> 1:24:52.620
 we can say this.

1:24:52.620 --> 1:24:55.500
 The creative process involves going into a state

1:24:55.500 --> 1:24:58.160
 where you're willing to consider a lot of options,

1:24:58.160 --> 1:24:59.940
 many of which seem distantly

1:24:59.940 --> 1:25:01.660
 or not even connected to one another.

1:25:01.660 --> 1:25:04.960
 And dopamine facilitates that divergent thinking state

1:25:04.960 --> 1:25:06.440
 in which you are perfectly happy

1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:10.960
 and in fact experience a kind of a joy or elation,

1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:13.560
 a comfort and a pleasure

1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:15.420
 in organizing all these different ideas

1:25:15.420 --> 1:25:19.140
 that to anyone else might seem not that related.

1:25:19.140 --> 1:25:21.200
 But when your dopamine levels are elevated,

1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:22.440
 these all seem like great ideas

1:25:22.440 --> 1:25:24.360
 and that maybe there are connections there, right?

1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:26.400
 You're not accepting all of them as true and valid

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:28.300
 and interesting and combining them,

1:25:28.300 --> 1:25:31.920
 but there's this idea that it's worth entertaining

1:25:31.920 --> 1:25:34.400
 the possibility, at least for moments.

1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:38.020
 And then as dopamine levels drop,

1:25:38.020 --> 1:25:39.800
 there is the process of convergent thinking,

1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:42.800
 which is taking options down off the wall,

1:25:42.800 --> 1:25:45.300
 saying, no, no, that doesn't fit with that,

1:25:45.300 --> 1:25:46.140
 doesn't fit with that,

1:25:46.140 --> 1:25:48.340
 but ah, that fits with that and that can work.

1:25:48.340 --> 1:25:52.240
 That feels right or sounds right or looks right.

1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:54.040
 That's the creativity process.

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:56.820
 And so I think this is not just important

1:25:56.820 --> 1:25:58.280
 for understanding cannabis,

1:25:58.280 --> 1:25:59.720
 which we'll get back to in a moment,

1:25:59.720 --> 1:26:02.080
 but it's important for understanding creativity

1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:03.840
 and brain states in general.

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:05.700
 Brain states are not, as we would say,

1:26:05.700 --> 1:26:06.600
 a square wave function.

1:26:06.600 --> 1:26:08.640
 You don't just drop into a trench of creativity.

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:11.680
 Creativity is not an event, it's a process.

1:26:11.680 --> 1:26:14.120
 And what I'm telling you is that it's a process

1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:16.080
 that involves divergent thinking and consideration,

1:26:16.080 --> 1:26:17.080
 a lot of different ideas.

1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:20.920
 That's correlated with high, but not too high dopamine.

1:26:20.920 --> 1:26:24.640
 And then one has to transition into a state

1:26:24.640 --> 1:26:25.800
 of convergent thinking,

1:26:25.800 --> 1:26:28.320
 which is really homing in on the ideas

1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:31.020
 that seem to have validity or that could have validity

1:26:31.020 --> 1:26:32.400
 and getting rid of everything else.

1:26:32.400 --> 1:26:34.480
 And that's associated with low dopamine.

1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:37.680
 It's more about logical implementation and consideration

1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:40.880
 as opposed to thinking about and considering everything.

1:26:40.880 --> 1:26:42.960
 So let's now return to the question of whether or not

1:26:42.960 --> 1:26:46.960
 cannabis and its different components increase creativity.

1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:50.240
 And when you look at the literature on this,

1:26:50.240 --> 1:26:53.840
 you find studies that very clearly point to a yes,

1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:55.640
 it increases creativity.

1:26:55.640 --> 1:26:57.500
 And it's not surprising therefore

1:26:57.500 --> 1:27:00.960
 that cannabis can increase dopamine transmission,

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:03.360
 that is dopamine levels, in certain brain areas,

1:27:03.360 --> 1:27:06.720
 in particular brain areas involved in thinking and planning.

1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:09.400
 Okay, so cannabis increases dopamine in these areas,

1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:11.960
 elevated dopamine increases divergent thinking,

1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:14.320
 and divergent thinking is associated with creativity.

1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:16.360
 And there are studies that support the idea

1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:20.220
 that cannabis can increase creativity.

1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:23.700
 However, there are at least as many studies

1:27:23.700 --> 1:27:26.720
 that say that cannabis does not increase creativity,

1:27:26.720 --> 1:27:30.060
 that cannabis increases consideration of multiple ideas,

1:27:30.060 --> 1:27:33.820
 perhaps through elevation of dopamine and related systems,

1:27:33.820 --> 1:27:36.840
 but that ultimately the ideas that converge from that

1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:38.360
 are not truly creative ideas.

1:27:38.360 --> 1:27:39.680
 At least they don't make the criteria

1:27:39.680 --> 1:27:42.880
 for creative brainstorming and extraction of ideas

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:44.080
 that are truly novel.

1:27:44.080 --> 1:27:46.480
 So it doesn't increase creativity.

1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:48.040
 So which one is it?

1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:50.920
 Well, fortunately, there's an entirely distinct set

1:27:50.920 --> 1:27:53.420
 of literature that has taken all the other literature

1:27:53.420 --> 1:27:56.320
 into consideration, and here's where we arrive.

1:27:56.320 --> 1:27:57.560
 So there's a really nice study

1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:00.560
 that explored creativity in cannabis users,

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:02.760
 and we will provide a link to the study.

1:28:02.760 --> 1:28:04.540
 First author is Emily LaFrance,

1:28:04.540 --> 1:28:08.160
 and the title of the paper is somewhat amusing

1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:10.760
 in its own right, which is, it starts with a question.

1:28:10.760 --> 1:28:12.560
 Inspired by Mary Jane, of course,

1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:15.400
 Mary Jane being one of the kind of old school versions

1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:18.360
 or ways of talking about cannabis or marijuana.

1:28:18.360 --> 1:28:20.620
 Nowadays, people refer to it mainly as pot,

1:28:20.620 --> 1:28:22.400
 has other names too, of course.

1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:24.880
 And the title of the paper is Inspired by Mary Jane,

1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:28.200
 Mechanisms Underlying Enhanced Creativity in Cannabis Users.

1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:30.820
 And I really like this study for a couple of reasons.

1:28:30.820 --> 1:28:35.820
 First of all, they looked at people who did not use cannabis

1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:38.660
 as well as people who use cannabis.

1:28:38.660 --> 1:28:39.920
 So they had two different groups,

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:44.760
 but they did not evaluate creativity of the cannabis users

1:28:44.760 --> 1:28:47.200
 while they were under the influence of cannabis.

1:28:47.200 --> 1:28:50.520
 They looked at the level of creativity

1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:52.560
 in these cannabis users

1:28:52.560 --> 1:28:55.380
 when they were not under the influence of cannabis

1:28:55.380 --> 1:28:58.280
 and asked whether or not their ability to be creative

1:28:58.280 --> 1:28:59.680
 was enhanced by cannabis.

1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:01.840
 Now we're going to compare this to studies

1:29:01.840 --> 1:29:03.880
 in which people come into the laboratory

1:29:03.880 --> 1:29:05.040
 and actually use cannabis,

1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:08.560
 and then they evaluate creativity under that context.

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:10.640
 But this study has some unique takeaways

1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:11.880
 that I think are really interesting.

1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:14.400
 First of all, they did, yes,

1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:16.880
 see evidence for enhanced creativity.

1:29:16.880 --> 1:29:18.360
 And when I say enhanced creativity,

1:29:18.360 --> 1:29:21.720
 I mean within the context of this divergent thinking thing

1:29:21.720 --> 1:29:23.360
 that I talked about a moment ago.

1:29:24.480 --> 1:29:25.580
 And when I say enhanced,

1:29:25.580 --> 1:29:28.020
 I mean significantly greater than in non-users,

1:29:28.020 --> 1:29:29.940
 so people that don't use cannabis.

1:29:29.940 --> 1:29:32.120
 So right now I can imagine that all the cannabis users

1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:35.160
 are cheering, yes, cannabis increases creativity,

1:29:35.160 --> 1:29:37.760
 makes people more creative than they would be otherwise.

1:29:37.760 --> 1:29:39.420
 Well, this is interesting.

1:29:39.420 --> 1:29:42.960
 We have to ask ourselves how that was accomplished.

1:29:42.960 --> 1:29:44.640
 And it turns out that one of the major ways

1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:47.600
 in which it was accomplished is that cannabis users,

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:51.040
 even if they are not under the influence of cannabis,

1:29:51.040 --> 1:29:54.680
 are far more open to novel ideas,

1:29:54.680 --> 1:29:58.960
 and they have a more explorative and sort of reduced anxiety

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:01.440
 or I should say lower anxiety mode of thinking

1:30:01.440 --> 1:30:02.840
 when they explore novel ideas,

1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:04.800
 which is essential for divergent thinking.

1:30:04.800 --> 1:30:08.880
 So they observe both enhanced divergent and convergent

1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:12.920
 creative type thinking in cannabis users.

1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:16.440
 And the source of that, they conclude,

1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:18.500
 is, and here I'll just quote,

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:21.280
 "'Cannabis users' higher levels of openness to experience

1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:23.740
 are responsible for their enhanced self-reported creativity

1:30:23.740 --> 1:30:26.040
 and convergent thinking test performance.'"

1:30:26.040 --> 1:30:29.800
 So it's not necessarily that cannabis is increasing

1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:32.100
 the capacity of the brain areas

1:30:32.100 --> 1:30:33.920
 that are associated with creativity,

1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:38.920
 but rather cannabis appears to be increasing in openness

1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:42.480
 and probably doing that in part through lowering anxiety

1:30:42.480 --> 1:30:43.580
 in particular people.

1:30:44.420 --> 1:30:48.600
 And that openness is leading to inclusion of more ideas

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:51.160
 during the divergent thinking process, right?

1:30:51.160 --> 1:30:53.300
 They're willing to consider throwing up more things

1:30:53.300 --> 1:30:55.920
 on the wall to see if they stick, so to speak.

1:30:55.920 --> 1:30:58.320
 So in their conclusions, they have a really nice statement.

1:30:58.320 --> 1:31:00.160
 Again, I'll just read from the paper

1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:02.320
 because they said it better than I ever could.

1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:05.000
 Quote, "'While mainstream media has propagated the idea

1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:08.440
 that cannabis expands the mind and enhances creativity,

1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:10.960
 our results show the link between cannabis and creativity

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:13.640
 is largely a spurious correlation.'"

1:31:13.640 --> 1:31:16.040
 Meaning that it's not the case

1:31:16.040 --> 1:31:19.240
 that cannabis increases creativity,

1:31:20.380 --> 1:31:23.660
 but, and I inserted the but in this quote,

1:31:25.400 --> 1:31:28.560
 "'But driven by differences in personality

1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:30.600
 that are related to cannabis use.

1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:32.520
 For example, openness to experience

1:31:32.520 --> 1:31:34.240
 that are related to both cannabis use

1:31:34.240 --> 1:31:36.780
 and augmented creativity.'"

1:31:36.780 --> 1:31:38.680
 This is a real chicken egg argument.

1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:39.840
 What do I mean by that?

1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:42.560
 What I mean is this paper finds

1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:46.040
 that people who are more open to experience

1:31:46.040 --> 1:31:48.320
 are more likely to use cannabis

1:31:48.320 --> 1:31:49.920
 and people who use cannabis

1:31:49.920 --> 1:31:53.440
 are going to be more open to new experiences.

1:31:53.440 --> 1:31:56.840
 And that combination of features, openness to experience

1:31:56.840 --> 1:32:00.440
 and what that openness to new experiences brings

1:32:00.440 --> 1:32:03.680
 enhances the convergent and divergent thinking

1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:06.760
 that is characteristic of the creative process.

1:32:06.760 --> 1:32:10.040
 So in short, cannabis increases creativity,

1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:12.420
 but through changes in personality

1:32:12.420 --> 1:32:14.720
 that tap into the creative process

1:32:14.720 --> 1:32:18.300
 rather than directly impacting the neural circuits

1:32:18.300 --> 1:32:21.080
 that for instance, turn on creativity.

1:32:21.080 --> 1:32:24.080
 And I have to say this study is really important

1:32:24.080 --> 1:32:28.360
 because by exploring cannabis users

1:32:28.360 --> 1:32:30.880
 not while under the influence of cannabis,

1:32:30.880 --> 1:32:33.960
 they were able to tap into this very important,

1:32:33.960 --> 1:32:36.060
 what I believe to be fact.

1:32:36.060 --> 1:32:37.520
 Because if you think about a study

1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:40.440
 in which you would have one group using cannabis

1:32:40.440 --> 1:32:42.080
 and another group not using cannabis

1:32:42.080 --> 1:32:44.880
 and then you give them some tasks that taps into creativity,

1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:47.360
 you will see effects and very likely you'll see effects

1:32:47.360 --> 1:32:49.280
 where cannabis might even increase divergent,

1:32:49.280 --> 1:32:51.040
 convergent thinking and creativity.

1:32:51.040 --> 1:32:52.320
 Those results have actually been published

1:32:52.320 --> 1:32:53.800
 many times before.

1:32:53.800 --> 1:32:56.640
 But given the varied effects of cannabis and THC

1:32:56.640 --> 1:32:57.520
 that we talked about earlier

1:32:57.520 --> 1:32:59.620
 through all that complex signaling stuff,

1:32:59.620 --> 1:33:01.920
 you can imagine that there will also be other studies

1:33:01.920 --> 1:33:03.280
 and in fact, there are

1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:06.040
 where divergent and convergent thinking

1:33:06.040 --> 1:33:09.200
 and creativity is not assisted by cannabis

1:33:09.200 --> 1:33:11.940
 and might even be reduced by ingesting cannabis.

1:33:11.940 --> 1:33:14.800
 However, if one considers that divergent thinking

1:33:14.800 --> 1:33:18.640
 is absolutely crucial to the creativity process

1:33:18.640 --> 1:33:21.660
 and the range of things that one will explore

1:33:21.660 --> 1:33:24.280
 will be enhanced by openness

1:33:24.280 --> 1:33:26.820
 and by reduced levels of anxiety.

1:33:26.820 --> 1:33:28.760
 So a willingness to explore different options,

1:33:28.760 --> 1:33:31.160
 some of which might seem completely crazy

1:33:31.160 --> 1:33:34.260
 and cannabis increases the personality types

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:38.080
 and reduces the anxiety that create that sense of openness.

1:33:38.080 --> 1:33:39.340
 Well, then it makes perfect sense

1:33:39.340 --> 1:33:42.600
 why cannabis would increase creativity

1:33:42.600 --> 1:33:45.280
 in certain individuals, but not directly.

1:33:45.280 --> 1:33:47.940
 And this study, the one I just referred to,

1:33:47.940 --> 1:33:49.180
 which I should say was published

1:33:49.180 --> 1:33:50.920
 in the journal, Consciousness and Cognition,

1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:53.040
 and again, we'll provide a link to it,

1:33:53.040 --> 1:33:57.800
 did a wonderful job of teasing out this impact of cannabis

1:33:57.800 --> 1:34:01.280
 on personality, which then impacts creativity.

1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:03.420
 So if somebody asks you, or if you're wondering,

1:34:03.420 --> 1:34:06.560
 or if you feel like cannabis increases creativity,

1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:08.080
 in some sense, the answer is yes,

1:34:08.080 --> 1:34:09.080
 but the answer is yes,

1:34:09.080 --> 1:34:13.120
 because of the ways that it shapes openness to new ideas

1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:15.980
 and can, I should say can, because not in everybody,

1:34:15.980 --> 1:34:19.180
 but can in some individuals reduce anxiety.

1:34:19.180 --> 1:34:21.960
 What this means is that if you are somebody

1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:26.960
 who experiences anxiety or increased levels of focus

1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:30.880
 from cannabis, regardless of the strain,

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:31.960
 and here I have to imagine people

1:34:31.960 --> 1:34:33.320
 are exploring different strains

1:34:33.320 --> 1:34:35.500
 if they're exploring them at all,

1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:36.840
 exploring different modes of delivery,

1:34:36.840 --> 1:34:38.700
 smoking or ingestible, et cetera,

1:34:38.700 --> 1:34:41.640
 if you're somebody who experiences anxiety,

1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:46.160
 it's very likely that you won't have the increased openness

1:34:47.220 --> 1:34:49.420
 to experience and divergent ideas

1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:50.840
 that will facilitate creativity.

1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:52.040
 However, if you are somebody

1:34:52.040 --> 1:34:54.700
 who achieves heightened levels of relaxation

1:34:54.700 --> 1:34:57.580
 and reduced levels of anxiety from cannabis,

1:34:57.580 --> 1:35:00.400
 regardless of which strain we happen to be talking about,

1:35:00.400 --> 1:35:03.060
 well then, yes, it will position you

1:35:03.060 --> 1:35:05.720
 to be in a heightened state of creativity,

1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:08.520
 at least as defined by convergent and divergent thinking.

1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:10.160
 One of the more characteristic,

1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:13.320
 or I should say stereotype qualities

1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:15.380
 of people that smoke a lot of marijuana

1:35:15.380 --> 1:35:18.100
 or ingest cannabis through other means

1:35:18.100 --> 1:35:20.320
 is their changed patterns of speech.

1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:25.320
 In fact, there's a kind of a lore in the clinical realm

1:35:25.500 --> 1:35:29.400
 that you can predict or get some strong indication

1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:31.720
 as to whether or not somebody is a cannabis user

1:35:31.720 --> 1:35:34.040
 or a pot smoker based on their voice

1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:37.200
 and their particular tone of voice

1:35:37.200 --> 1:35:39.240
 and their lack of inflection.

1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:40.680
 There's a lot of speculation here,

1:35:40.680 --> 1:35:42.360
 but fortunately it's been studied.

1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:43.640
 So I'd like to discuss now

1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:46.720
 whether or not cannabis can impact patterns of speech,

1:35:46.720 --> 1:35:50.080
 both acutely, meaning while under the influence of cannabis

1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:53.640
 and over time in chronic cannabis users.

1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:55.160
 And when I say chronic cannabis use,

1:35:55.160 --> 1:35:56.800
 I want to be very specific what I mean.

1:35:56.800 --> 1:35:59.000
 Chronic cannabis use does not necessarily mean

1:35:59.000 --> 1:36:00.240
 that people are smoking cannabis

1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:02.080
 or ingesting cannabis every day.

1:36:02.080 --> 1:36:03.040
 Although certainly if they are,

1:36:03.040 --> 1:36:05.360
 that qualifies as chronic use.

1:36:05.360 --> 1:36:07.760
 Chronic use is regular use over time

1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:10.200
 of anywhere from twice a week or more.

1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:11.820
 So using cannabis once a month

1:36:11.820 --> 1:36:13.320
 would not be considered chronic use,

1:36:13.320 --> 1:36:15.520
 even if it's for many, many years.

1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:18.640
 Using cannabis or ingesting cannabis in some way or form

1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:21.400
 twice a week would be considered chronic use.

1:36:21.400 --> 1:36:22.240
 And then of course,

1:36:22.240 --> 1:36:24.040
 some of you out there are going to ask me to split hairs

1:36:24.040 --> 1:36:26.560
 and say, well, what if somebody uses it twice a month?

1:36:26.560 --> 1:36:28.860
 Well, listen, the clinical literature

1:36:28.860 --> 1:36:31.460
 and the scientific literature don't get that specific.

1:36:31.460 --> 1:36:33.320
 And of course there are an infinite number of ways

1:36:33.320 --> 1:36:35.600
 to arrange one's cannabis use,

1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:37.440
 everything from zero, none at all,

1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:41.160
 to constantly every day, all day and everywhere in between.

1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:44.960
 But think of chronic use as twice a week or more.

1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:47.600
 Think of occasional use as less than that

1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:51.320
 and realize that within the realm of chronic use, excuse me,

1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:54.360
 that or more can be anywhere from twice a week

1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:57.080
 to every day to just in the evenings, et cetera.

1:36:58.860 --> 1:37:01.480
 The effects of chronic use of cannabis,

1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:06.800
 as I just defined it, on speech have been studied

1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:11.560
 because of this characteristic drawing out

1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:14.660
 of certain syllables, a slowing of speech,

1:37:14.660 --> 1:37:19.100
 and in many cases, a total change or alteration

1:37:19.100 --> 1:37:23.120
 in the way that people speak and use language,

1:37:23.120 --> 1:37:25.620
 both when under the influence of cannabis

1:37:25.620 --> 1:37:28.020
 and when not under the influence of cannabis,

1:37:28.020 --> 1:37:29.840
 if they are chronic users.

1:37:29.840 --> 1:37:33.900
 And here, we really want to distinguish between THC and CBD

1:37:33.900 --> 1:37:37.600
 and just make it really simple and say that CBD

1:37:37.600 --> 1:37:41.260
 is not responsible for most of the psychoactive effects

1:37:41.260 --> 1:37:43.760
 of cannabis, whereas THC is.

1:37:43.760 --> 1:37:45.480
 And again, the ratio of CBD to THC

1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:47.160
 is going to be relevant there,

1:37:47.160 --> 1:37:50.000
 but let's just think about cannabis and THC

1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.840
 as one in the same for this portion of the discussion,

1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:53.680
 realizing that, of course,

1:37:53.680 --> 1:37:55.640
 they are not exactly the same thing.

1:37:55.640 --> 1:37:57.220
 There's an excellent study entitled,

1:37:57.220 --> 1:37:59.680
 adults with history of recreational cannabis use

1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:01.840
 have altered speech production.

1:38:01.840 --> 1:38:02.840
 And we will provide a link to that.

1:38:02.840 --> 1:38:06.040
 First author, Adam Vogel, really liked this paper.

1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:07.660
 It was published in the journal,

1:38:07.660 --> 1:38:09.540
 Drug and Alcohol Dependence.

1:38:09.540 --> 1:38:11.860
 We will provide a link to it for you

1:38:11.860 --> 1:38:14.320
 if you'd like to peruse it in more detail.

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:16.600
 The title itself, adults with a history

1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:20.040
 of recreational cannabis use have altered speech production

1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:22.240
 tells you pretty much everything you need to know,

1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:24.720
 except there's some important nuance in here

1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:26.840
 because as I mentioned earlier,

1:38:26.840 --> 1:38:30.160
 people who smoke sativa varieties of cannabis

1:38:30.160 --> 1:38:34.400
 oftentimes will become more talkative, much more talkative.

1:38:34.400 --> 1:38:37.320
 However, whether or not people tend to rely

1:38:37.320 --> 1:38:42.320
 on sativa cannabis use or indica cannabis use,

1:38:42.820 --> 1:38:44.920
 there is a very consistent finding

1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:46.280
 that people who are chronic users,

1:38:46.280 --> 1:38:48.040
 again, twice a week or more,

1:38:48.040 --> 1:38:50.700
 recreational use or medicinal use,

1:38:50.700 --> 1:38:54.320
 undergo pretty profound changes in the way that they speak,

1:38:54.320 --> 1:38:57.880
 but in a very specific set of ways.

1:38:57.880 --> 1:38:59.720
 Now, first of all,

1:38:59.720 --> 1:39:02.600
 the changes in speech shouldn't surprise us at all

1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:05.720
 because both sativa varieties of cannabis

1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:08.100
 and indica varieties of cannabis

1:39:08.100 --> 1:39:10.800
 impact those brain centers involved in movement,

1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:13.660
 the basal ganglia, remember the go-no-go circuitry,

1:39:13.660 --> 1:39:15.480
 the circuitry that makes you want to do things

1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:18.080
 and the circuitry that makes you want to withhold action,

1:39:18.080 --> 1:39:21.040
 and it tends to shift the body and brain

1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:22.680
 toward more inaction.

1:39:23.940 --> 1:39:27.180
 And cannabis impacts CB1 receptors in the cerebellum,

1:39:27.180 --> 1:39:31.120
 which is involved in motor planning, execution, and balance.

1:39:31.120 --> 1:39:35.000
 So regardless of whether or not people are using cannabis

1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:37.520
 of the sativa or the indica variety,

1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:39.480
 there are disruptions in motor circuitry.

1:39:39.480 --> 1:39:40.900
 And as you may have heard,

1:39:40.900 --> 1:39:44.480
 if you listen to our episode with Rockefeller professor,

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:48.040
 Dr. Eric Jarvis, who works on speech and movement,

1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:50.640
 speech is movement, right?

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:53.160
 The movements of the mouth, the movements of the hands,

1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:55.840
 those are intimately related in terms of our speech.

1:39:55.840 --> 1:39:58.920
 In fact, the centers of the brain involved in hand movements

1:39:58.920 --> 1:40:01.440
 are part of the speech areas and vice versa.

1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:03.200
 Eric actually pointed out

1:40:03.200 --> 1:40:05.040
 that if you put your hands behind your back,

1:40:05.040 --> 1:40:07.280
 provided you normally do have use of your hands,

1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:10.280
 it actually will reduce your fluidity of speech.

1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:12.440
 And so I'm going to put them back in front of me now.

1:40:13.740 --> 1:40:18.280
 The point is smoking marijuana or consuming marijuana

1:40:18.280 --> 1:40:21.520
 by edible changes one's speech

1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:23.040
 and does it in a very specific way.

1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:26.640
 And in this study by Adam Vogel and colleagues,

1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:30.460
 they explored a huge different variety of aspects of speech.

1:40:30.460 --> 1:40:32.640
 And this can be done using spectral processing,

1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:34.200
 which is fancy nerd speak

1:40:34.200 --> 1:40:36.440
 for looking at how much inflection there is

1:40:36.440 --> 1:40:38.720
 or looking at how long people hold vowels

1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:39.860
 or consonants, et cetera.

1:40:39.860 --> 1:40:40.840
 And again, these are people

1:40:40.840 --> 1:40:42.800
 not under the influence of cannabis,

1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:45.000
 but rather people who tend to be

1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:46.200
 under the influence of cannabis

1:40:46.200 --> 1:40:48.200
 when not participating in the study.

1:40:48.200 --> 1:40:51.360
 In other words, chronic recreational cannabis users.

1:40:51.360 --> 1:40:54.680
 So what are the two major shifts that cannabis causes

1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:56.080
 on our patterns of speech?

1:40:56.080 --> 1:40:57.920
 Well, the first one is a change

1:40:57.920 --> 1:40:59.900
 in what's called spectral tilt.

1:40:59.900 --> 1:41:03.740
 And that's fancy nerd speak for vocal effort and intensity.

1:41:03.740 --> 1:41:06.720
 So I'm not a pot smoker, I confess,

1:41:08.440 --> 1:41:10.840
 but if I were to say the sentence,

1:41:11.820 --> 1:41:13.400
 vocal effort and intensity

1:41:13.400 --> 1:41:16.180
 are important components of speech.

1:41:16.180 --> 1:41:17.940
 That's the way I would say that sentence

1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:20.500
 if I was striving to enunciate very carefully

1:41:20.500 --> 1:41:24.180
 and to accent certain words and syllables.

1:41:24.180 --> 1:41:27.280
 A pot smoker or somebody who uses

1:41:27.280 --> 1:41:29.960
 recreational cannabis fairly often

1:41:29.960 --> 1:41:32.480
 would have reduced spectral tilt,

1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:34.920
 AKA vocal effort and intensity,

1:41:34.920 --> 1:41:39.220
 and might say spectral tilt is vocal effort and intensity,

1:41:39.220 --> 1:41:40.440
 and it differed between groups

1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:41.660
 and appeared to change in line

1:41:41.660 --> 1:41:44.840
 with the duration of abstinence from cannabis use.

1:41:44.840 --> 1:41:47.080
 That I think is not a far cry

1:41:47.080 --> 1:41:49.520
 from the change in spectral tilt that they observed here.

1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:54.080
 In addition, there are changes in verbal timing.

1:41:54.080 --> 1:41:57.660
 That is pronunciation of words and accenting

1:41:57.660 --> 1:42:00.200
 particular syllables of words

1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:04.680
 in people that consume cannabis or smoke cannabis.

1:42:04.680 --> 1:42:09.280
 So rather than emphasize particular words within a sentence,

1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:11.260
 so again, I'll just use a sentence from the paper

1:42:11.260 --> 1:42:13.500
 so that you can gain more knowledge from the paper.

1:42:13.500 --> 1:42:16.000
 Cannabis, and I'll say it the way that I would say it,

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.960
 since I'm not a cannabis user.

1:42:18.960 --> 1:42:21.440
 Cannabis, marijuana, is the most commonly used

1:42:21.440 --> 1:42:22.560
 illicit drug in the world

1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:24.720
 with approximately 4% of adults

1:42:24.720 --> 1:42:27.640
 aged 15 to 64 years reporting recent use.

1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:29.720
 And the citation is from the United Nations

1:42:29.720 --> 1:42:33.000
 Office on Drugs and Crime, 2019.

1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:34.020
 So that would be the way

1:42:34.020 --> 1:42:35.900
 that I would typically read that sentence.

1:42:35.900 --> 1:42:38.440
 And having gone into the data on this paper

1:42:38.440 --> 1:42:41.120
 and of course evaluated references therein

1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:44.180
 and listened to some of the spectral analysis

1:42:44.180 --> 1:42:46.160
 that they include as data,

1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:47.940
 you can literally go into these papers online

1:42:47.940 --> 1:42:51.240
 and hear recordings of people who are cannabis users

1:42:51.240 --> 1:42:52.760
 or non-cannabis users.

1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:55.280
 And I'll try and give you a clear sense

1:42:55.280 --> 1:42:57.720
 without picking an extreme example

1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:00.720
 of how somebody who's a fairly consistent

1:43:00.720 --> 1:43:02.520
 or even occasional cannabis user

1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:04.280
 might read that very same sentence.

1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:08.960
 Cannabis, marijuana, is the most commonly used

1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:10.360
 illicit drug in the world

1:43:10.360 --> 1:43:12.600
 with approximately 4% of adults

1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:15.840
 aged 15 to 64 years reporting recent use.

1:43:15.840 --> 1:43:17.960
 And the citation comes from the United Nation

1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:20.960
 Office on Drugs and Crime, 2019.

1:43:20.960 --> 1:43:23.440
 Now you'll notice that wasn't a dramatic difference.

1:43:23.440 --> 1:43:25.440
 And of course I could have taken the liberty

1:43:25.440 --> 1:43:27.180
 to pick an extreme example of the sort

1:43:27.180 --> 1:43:29.480
 that they did occasionally observe

1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:31.720
 in evaluating subjects for this paper.

1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:34.060
 I could have said something like cannabis,

1:43:34.060 --> 1:43:36.400
 marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug,

1:43:36.400 --> 1:43:37.640
 but frankly that would have been

1:43:37.640 --> 1:43:39.320
 selecting an outlier example.

1:43:39.320 --> 1:43:40.200
 And I don't want to do that.

1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:42.680
 I don't want to skew the data as they say.

1:43:42.680 --> 1:43:47.040
 Rather, if you heard the first time I read the sentence

1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:48.280
 and the second time I read the sentence,

1:43:48.280 --> 1:43:51.880
 what's mainly different is the difference

1:43:51.880 --> 1:43:54.200
 in the amount of enunciation

1:43:54.200 --> 1:43:56.080
 and accenting of particular words

1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:57.480
 and symbols within a sentence.

1:43:57.480 --> 1:44:00.360
 So the total content that's delivered is exactly the same.

1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:02.560
 And while I wasn't measuring my pace,

1:44:02.560 --> 1:44:07.360
 the overall rate of communication is essentially the same,

1:44:07.360 --> 1:44:09.400
 but there's less sort of lilting

1:44:09.400 --> 1:44:11.240
 and falling of the voice and less accenting.

1:44:11.240 --> 1:44:14.320
 That's the major consistent effect of cannabis use.

1:44:14.320 --> 1:44:16.320
 Now, of course, there are examples of people

1:44:16.320 --> 1:44:18.640
 who are using a lot of cannabis

1:44:18.640 --> 1:44:21.720
 and it impacts brain centers involved in movement and speech

1:44:21.720 --> 1:44:23.840
 so much so that they really do have

1:44:23.840 --> 1:44:26.560
 the really drawn out kind of nah.

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:29.080
 And oftentimes this will be detected in the laugh.

1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.840
 You know, there's this sort of stereotypical stoner laugh

1:44:31.840 --> 1:44:34.340
 as it's sometimes called rather than say ha ha ha,

1:44:34.340 --> 1:44:36.720
 or that's a fake laugh, obviously.

1:44:36.720 --> 1:44:37.860
 It's hard to make myself laugh

1:44:37.860 --> 1:44:38.920
 if something's not actually funny.

1:44:38.920 --> 1:44:40.360
 I'll have to think of something funny

1:44:40.360 --> 1:44:41.480
 when people will say ha,

1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:43.360
 like that's a bit more of the way I might laugh,

1:44:43.360 --> 1:44:45.840
 like ha, sort of the inspiratory laugh

1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:48.460
 or the ha, which is expiratory laugh.

1:44:48.460 --> 1:44:50.200
 People who use cannabis chronically

1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:52.180
 will often do the ah, right,

1:44:52.180 --> 1:44:54.560
 which is sort of the back of the throat, ah.

1:44:54.560 --> 1:44:57.240
 It's sort of the, it's neither inspiratory

1:44:57.240 --> 1:44:58.400
 nor expiratory laugh.

1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:00.020
 And believe it or not, there's an entire literature

1:45:00.020 --> 1:45:03.000
 on inspiratory inhaling versus expiratory laughs.

1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:06.700
 And there's also a literature on cannabis

1:45:06.700 --> 1:45:09.400
 altering the pattern of inspiratory and expiratory laughs.

1:45:09.400 --> 1:45:11.780
 It almost sounds like a sarcastic laugh

1:45:11.780 --> 1:45:14.320
 when in fact they may not be feeling sarcastic at all.

1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:16.880
 And I have a very close friend and colleague

1:45:16.880 --> 1:45:19.260
 who's a phenomenal neurosurgeon and neuroscientist

1:45:19.260 --> 1:45:20.480
 by the name of Dr. Eddie Chang.

1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:23.800
 He's the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF and his lab

1:45:23.800 --> 1:45:25.820
 and him are expert in the study

1:45:25.820 --> 1:45:29.560
 of neuroscience controlling language and speech.

1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:34.100
 And he often tells me that he can predict

1:45:34.100 --> 1:45:36.240
 with almost certainty whether or not somebody

1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:38.220
 is a regular cannabis user

1:45:38.220 --> 1:45:42.280
 based not just on the patterns of speech that they use,

1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:45.300
 but even just by recording specific neurons in their brain

1:45:45.300 --> 1:45:47.860
 that underlie the laugh reflex

1:45:47.860 --> 1:45:49.440
 and certain patterns of speech.

1:45:49.440 --> 1:45:52.540
 So this idea that cannabis use changes your ability

1:45:52.540 --> 1:45:55.820
 to speak and enunciate clearly does appear to be true.

1:45:55.820 --> 1:45:58.560
 And the stereotype that cannabis use

1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:00.640
 tends to create more of a drawl

1:46:00.640 --> 1:46:04.800
 or kind of a, if you will, a laziness in the laugh

1:46:04.800 --> 1:46:08.000
 and some of the reflexive enunciations that people use

1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:09.260
 does also appear to be true.

1:46:09.260 --> 1:46:11.940
 And I say all that of course with the caveat

1:46:11.940 --> 1:46:15.020
 that many people out there will know individuals

1:46:15.020 --> 1:46:17.960
 or perhaps you yourselves are individuals

1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:22.180
 that may use cannabis, but that have incredible articulation

1:46:22.180 --> 1:46:23.300
 probably better than mine

1:46:23.300 --> 1:46:24.660
 and better than other people out there

1:46:24.660 --> 1:46:25.940
 who speak for a living.

1:46:25.940 --> 1:46:28.020
 So I'm not saying that 100% of people

1:46:28.020 --> 1:46:31.300
 that use cannabis regularly can't speak well or clearly.

1:46:31.300 --> 1:46:32.980
 That's simply not what I'm saying.

1:46:32.980 --> 1:46:35.520
 And I don't want to communicate that idea at all.

1:46:35.520 --> 1:46:38.740
 But it is the case that people who are regular cannabis users

1:46:38.740 --> 1:46:40.740
 are impacting the neural circuits involved

1:46:40.740 --> 1:46:43.100
 in movement, movement also controls speech

1:46:43.100 --> 1:46:46.380
 and therefore cannabis is impacting speech.

1:46:46.380 --> 1:46:48.340
 Now I'd like to turn our attention to whether or not

1:46:48.340 --> 1:46:51.100
 cannabis can increase sexual activity,

1:46:51.100 --> 1:46:54.460
 sexual desire and or sexual function.

1:46:54.460 --> 1:46:56.420
 So we're going to be talking about libido,

1:46:56.420 --> 1:46:59.300
 about sexual desire and about effects of cannabis

1:46:59.300 --> 1:47:00.600
 on hormones.

1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:02.660
 And while this might sound like a discussion

1:47:02.660 --> 1:47:06.080
 that's purely oriented towards recreational use of cannabis,

1:47:06.080 --> 1:47:08.380
 that is people using cannabis to heighten

1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:12.020
 or increase their sense of arousal for sexual activity.

1:47:12.020 --> 1:47:14.540
 It actually ventures into the clinical realm too,

1:47:14.540 --> 1:47:17.600
 meaning there have been excellent peer-reviewed studies

1:47:17.600 --> 1:47:19.100
 that I'll describe to you in a moment

1:47:19.100 --> 1:47:23.060
 exploring the use of cannabis or THC more specifically

1:47:23.060 --> 1:47:26.980
 for something called hypoactive sexual desire disorder,

1:47:26.980 --> 1:47:30.420
 which refers to a persistent or recurrent deficiency

1:47:30.420 --> 1:47:32.740
 or absence of sexual fantasies and thoughts

1:47:32.740 --> 1:47:37.300
 and or desire for or receptivity to sexual activity.

1:47:37.300 --> 1:47:39.620
 This is a disorder that is fairly common,

1:47:39.620 --> 1:47:43.580
 anywhere from six to 9% of people, both males and females.

1:47:43.580 --> 1:47:47.580
 It used to be considered higher prevalence in females

1:47:47.580 --> 1:47:50.760
 than in males, but now those numbers seem to be evening out.

1:47:50.760 --> 1:47:54.440
 So basically there are anywhere from six to 9%

1:47:54.440 --> 1:47:58.700
 of people out there who have very diminished sexual desire.

1:47:58.700 --> 1:48:01.260
 And so a number of those people are interested

1:48:01.260 --> 1:48:02.980
 in figuring out ways to increase their amount

1:48:02.980 --> 1:48:04.260
 of sexual desire.

1:48:04.260 --> 1:48:07.180
 And of course there are people in the general population

1:48:07.180 --> 1:48:10.660
 who may not have hypoactive sexual desire disorder

1:48:10.660 --> 1:48:13.340
 who are interested in using cannabis recreationally

1:48:13.340 --> 1:48:15.580
 in order to increase their desire for

1:48:15.580 --> 1:48:18.540
 or their experience of sexual activity.

1:48:18.540 --> 1:48:21.140
 Now, first we have to acknowledge that sexual desire

1:48:21.140 --> 1:48:24.100
 and activity is a complex set of processes,

1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:27.660
 meaning it's not just one event, sex, the verb,

1:48:27.660 --> 1:48:31.740
 it involves arousal, it involves sex, the verb,

1:48:31.740 --> 1:48:35.340
 and it involves a whole set of mindsets and emotional states

1:48:35.340 --> 1:48:37.780
 that vary tremendously between individuals.

1:48:37.780 --> 1:48:41.980
 But once again, we can distill out a few basic principles

1:48:41.980 --> 1:48:44.380
 and I should emphasize these are by no means

1:48:44.380 --> 1:48:46.500
 the only chemicals in neural circuits involved

1:48:46.500 --> 1:48:48.940
 in the sexual arc, as we'll call it,

1:48:48.940 --> 1:48:51.720
 desire, the act of sex, et cetera,

1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:54.260
 but they are central to it, they are vital to it.

1:48:54.260 --> 1:48:56.980
 They would be considered what I would call necessary

1:48:56.980 --> 1:48:58.380
 but not sufficient, okay?

1:48:58.380 --> 1:49:00.260
 So there'll be other chemicals involved too,

1:49:00.260 --> 1:49:01.760
 but the main chemicals in neural circuits

1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:03.540
 are those involved in dopamine.

1:49:03.540 --> 1:49:05.820
 So the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway,

1:49:05.820 --> 1:49:08.740
 in particular a brain structure called nucleus accumbens,

1:49:08.740 --> 1:49:10.360
 which we'll talk about more in a moment,

1:49:10.360 --> 1:49:13.220
 is vital to all motivated behaviors

1:49:13.220 --> 1:49:16.340
 and to the seeking out of all particular types

1:49:16.340 --> 1:49:18.960
 of pleasurable experiences and sex is no exception.

1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:21.980
 So when we hear that the nucleus accumbens is activated,

1:49:21.980 --> 1:49:24.820
 that almost always means that dopamine has been released

1:49:24.820 --> 1:49:27.540
 in that area and other areas of the brain and body,

1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:29.500
 and we can consider dopamine central

1:49:29.500 --> 1:49:34.500
 to the desire for pursuit of end act of sex.

1:49:34.860 --> 1:49:38.500
 In addition to that, there are molecules like oxytocin,

1:49:38.500 --> 1:49:40.020
 which are involved in pair bonding,

1:49:40.020 --> 1:49:41.140
 and they're going to be neural circuits

1:49:41.140 --> 1:49:43.580
 specific to the oxytocin circuitry,

1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:47.380
 but in terms of sexual arousal and sexual behavior,

1:49:47.380 --> 1:49:50.100
 it's really the dopamine pathway in this nucleus accumbens,

1:49:50.100 --> 1:49:51.820
 which are especially vital.

1:49:52.720 --> 1:49:54.560
 That allows us to address the question,

1:49:54.560 --> 1:49:58.840
 does cannabis increase, decrease,

1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:01.660
 or have no effect on sexual desire

1:50:01.660 --> 1:50:04.660
 and or the ability to have sex?

1:50:04.660 --> 1:50:08.700
 And therein, we will find some very interesting answers

1:50:08.700 --> 1:50:12.180
 because once again, it will point to the fact

1:50:12.180 --> 1:50:15.940
 that the effects of cannabis on different individuals

1:50:15.940 --> 1:50:20.260
 can be highly divergent, meaning in one set of individuals,

1:50:20.260 --> 1:50:22.780
 cannabis will make them far less anxious,

1:50:22.780 --> 1:50:24.380
 and in another set of individuals,

1:50:24.380 --> 1:50:26.740
 the same strain of cannabis at the same dosage

1:50:26.740 --> 1:50:28.320
 will make them extremely anxious,

1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:31.940
 the same can be said also of sexual activity.

1:50:31.940 --> 1:50:33.980
 And this was beautifully illustrated

1:50:33.980 --> 1:50:35.860
 in the context of sexual desire

1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:37.820
 in the journal Psychopharmacology

1:50:37.820 --> 1:50:39.420
 in a paper published in 2017.

1:50:39.420 --> 1:50:43.300
 The title of this paper is Individual Prolactin Reactivity

1:50:43.300 --> 1:50:46.940
 Modulates Response of Nucleus Accumbens to Erotic Stimuli

1:50:46.940 --> 1:50:51.420
 During Acute Cannabis Intoxication, an FMRI pilot study.

1:50:51.420 --> 1:50:53.580
 So I'll give a little bit of definition

1:50:53.580 --> 1:50:54.700
 to some of the terms in the title

1:50:54.700 --> 1:50:57.620
 that will make it easier for you to understand the paper,

1:50:57.620 --> 1:50:59.100
 but then I'll just march through the results

1:50:59.100 --> 1:51:01.820
 because they are very straightforward and easy to understand

1:51:01.820 --> 1:51:03.380
 and very interesting.

1:51:03.380 --> 1:51:06.540
 FMRI is just functional magnetic resonance imaging.

1:51:06.540 --> 1:51:09.260
 So basically, subjects in this experiment

1:51:09.260 --> 1:51:12.020
 came into the laboratory.

1:51:12.020 --> 1:51:16.180
 They were either people who had not used cannabis before

1:51:16.180 --> 1:51:19.180
 or who had used cannabis before.

1:51:19.180 --> 1:51:20.940
 They were placed into a brain scanner,

1:51:20.940 --> 1:51:22.660
 one of these FMRI devices.

1:51:22.660 --> 1:51:26.080
 It looks like a tube that people are backed up into

1:51:26.080 --> 1:51:27.460
 and then they can view images in there

1:51:27.460 --> 1:51:28.820
 and their brain can be imaged

1:51:28.820 --> 1:51:31.180
 without having to remove any skull or drill into the skull,

1:51:31.180 --> 1:51:32.320
 no neurosurgery.

1:51:33.700 --> 1:51:35.820
 The participants in this study were grouped

1:51:35.820 --> 1:51:37.660
 according to whether or not they'd experienced

1:51:37.660 --> 1:51:39.580
 any aphrodisiac effects

1:51:39.580 --> 1:51:41.740
 during the intoxication with cannabis.

1:51:41.740 --> 1:51:43.740
 So that would be the first group, group A.

1:51:43.740 --> 1:51:45.940
 They literally called it group A for aphrodisiac.

1:51:45.940 --> 1:51:47.060
 And then the second group,

1:51:47.060 --> 1:51:48.820
 and this is the only thing I don't like about this study,

1:51:48.820 --> 1:51:50.300
 is rather than call it group B,

1:51:50.300 --> 1:51:52.660
 they called them group non-A,

1:51:52.660 --> 1:51:54.700
 which just gets a little confusing.

1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:56.420
 So I'll try and simplify all this.

1:51:56.420 --> 1:51:57.820
 There are two groups

1:51:57.820 --> 1:52:02.180
 and one group experiences sexual arousal

1:52:02.180 --> 1:52:06.260
 when under the influence of cannabis, THC specifically.

1:52:06.260 --> 1:52:07.620
 The other group does not.

1:52:07.620 --> 1:52:10.620
 And it turns out this is a very commonly observed

1:52:10.620 --> 1:52:14.260
 divergence of effects of cannabis.

1:52:14.260 --> 1:52:16.820
 Some people experience a lot of sexual arousal

1:52:16.820 --> 1:52:19.180
 from cannabis and THC in particular,

1:52:19.180 --> 1:52:20.560
 and some people do not.

1:52:20.560 --> 1:52:24.100
 In fact, they experience suppression of sexual desire.

1:52:24.100 --> 1:52:25.940
 And it's always been a little bit mysterious

1:52:25.940 --> 1:52:27.940
 as to why that is.

1:52:27.940 --> 1:52:29.320
 Well, in this study,

1:52:29.320 --> 1:52:33.720
 they showed people in both groups erotic images,

1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:35.880
 and they measured sexual arousal

1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:36.940
 through a number of different measures.

1:52:36.940 --> 1:52:37.840
 We won't go into all that.

1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:39.300
 It was largely subjective.

1:52:39.300 --> 1:52:40.220
 There've been other studies

1:52:40.220 --> 1:52:43.260
 where they've actually measured things like erections

1:52:43.260 --> 1:52:45.780
 in males and vaginal lubrication in females,

1:52:45.780 --> 1:52:47.840
 the so-called autonomic responses

1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:51.220
 that people can't lie about, so to speak,

1:52:51.220 --> 1:52:54.340
 and that tap into other aspects

1:52:54.340 --> 1:52:57.640
 of the so-called sexual arousal process.

1:52:57.640 --> 1:52:59.780
 In this study, they also took blood samples

1:52:59.780 --> 1:53:03.160
 to look at the concentration of things like cannabinoids.

1:53:03.160 --> 1:53:04.440
 So this is a really nice study

1:53:04.440 --> 1:53:07.360
 in that they actually measured how much THC

1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:09.660
 was in the bloodstream in different individuals

1:53:09.660 --> 1:53:12.400
 who reacted to these erotic stimuli in different ways.

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:15.220
 And they measured hormones, namely cortisol,

1:53:15.220 --> 1:53:16.280
 which is a stress hormone,

1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:17.820
 which tends to negatively correlate

1:53:17.820 --> 1:53:20.540
 with sexual arousal and prolactin.

1:53:20.540 --> 1:53:22.640
 And the interesting takeaway from the study

1:53:22.640 --> 1:53:24.980
 was that for people,

1:53:24.980 --> 1:53:27.440
 and it didn't matter if it was males or females,

1:53:27.440 --> 1:53:28.840
 because they looked at both,

1:53:30.260 --> 1:53:35.260
 for people that experienced elevated prolactin levels

1:53:35.400 --> 1:53:39.260
 under cannabis intoxication, that's how they referred to it.

1:53:39.260 --> 1:53:40.980
 People take cannabis, they measured prolactin.

1:53:40.980 --> 1:53:43.900
 Some people had elevated prolactin, some people did not.

1:53:45.260 --> 1:53:48.000
 For the people that had elevated levels of prolactin,

1:53:49.200 --> 1:53:52.420
 they did not observe activation of brain areas

1:53:52.420 --> 1:53:54.340
 associated with sexual arousal,

1:53:54.340 --> 1:53:56.440
 in this case, the right nucleus accumbens.

1:53:56.440 --> 1:53:59.640
 So you have two nucleus accumbi, I guess they'd be called,

1:53:59.640 --> 1:54:00.800
 one on each side of the brain.

1:54:00.800 --> 1:54:02.520
 And the activation of that brain area

1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:05.520
 is strongly associated with dopamine and with arousal

1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:07.880
 and sexual arousal in particular in this study.

1:54:07.880 --> 1:54:10.000
 And if people had elevated prolactin,

1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.880
 they did not experience activation of nucleus accumbens

1:54:12.880 --> 1:54:15.400
 and they did not report feeling sexually aroused

1:54:15.400 --> 1:54:16.240
 to those pictures,

1:54:16.240 --> 1:54:18.500
 at least not to the same degree as the other group.

1:54:18.500 --> 1:54:20.620
 So some people's prolactin levels go up

1:54:20.620 --> 1:54:22.680
 when they ingest cannabis

1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:25.880
 and those people do not achieve elevated levels

1:54:25.880 --> 1:54:29.360
 of sexual arousal when under the influence of cannabis,

1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:32.200
 even if they're looking at erotic stimuli.

1:54:32.200 --> 1:54:35.740
 That makes sense because prolactin

1:54:35.740 --> 1:54:39.120
 is mutually inhibitory, as we would say.

1:54:39.120 --> 1:54:41.040
 It's kind of in a push-pull with dopamine.

1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:42.280
 When dopamine levels are high,

1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:44.560
 prolactin levels tend to be low.

1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:46.160
 And when prolactin levels are high,

1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:48.000
 dopamine levels tend to be low.

1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.540
 The other group, so-called group A,

1:54:50.540 --> 1:54:53.480
 that experienced elevated levels of sexual arousal

1:54:53.480 --> 1:54:55.240
 when under the influence of cannabis

1:54:55.240 --> 1:54:56.860
 and viewing erotic stimuli,

1:54:57.740 --> 1:55:01.600
 that group did not show elevated levels of prolactin

1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:03.800
 in response to cannabis.

1:55:03.800 --> 1:55:04.840
 So this, I believe,

1:55:04.840 --> 1:55:08.040
 resolves a longstanding controversy in the field,

1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:11.300
 which is does cannabis increase sexual arousal?

1:55:11.300 --> 1:55:12.280
 Well, it depends.

1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:14.220
 If you fall into the category of person

1:55:14.220 --> 1:55:18.000
 who has elevated levels of prolactin in response to cannabis,

1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.960
 then no, actually cannabis will suppress

1:55:20.960 --> 1:55:23.240
 your sexual response and desire.

1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:26.400
 If, however, you are in the category of person

1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:29.840
 that does not have elevated levels of prolactin

1:55:29.840 --> 1:55:31.700
 in response to cannabis,

1:55:31.700 --> 1:55:35.080
 well then erotic stimuli can potentially,

1:55:35.080 --> 1:55:37.760
 and in fact do, increase sexual arousal

1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:39.320
 in the majority of individuals.

1:55:39.320 --> 1:55:40.820
 Now, many of you are probably hearing this

1:55:40.820 --> 1:55:43.400
 and wondering whether or not you fall into

1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:45.860
 one category of individual or another.

1:55:45.860 --> 1:55:48.960
 And the key thing here to understand

1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:53.100
 is that levels of prolactin heading into the study

1:55:53.100 --> 1:55:56.100
 did not predict, did not predict,

1:55:56.100 --> 1:55:59.140
 whether or not people would respond to cannabis

1:55:59.140 --> 1:56:02.300
 with elevated or non-elevated

1:56:02.300 --> 1:56:04.960
 or even reduced levels of sexual arousal.

1:56:04.960 --> 1:56:08.680
 It was whether or not people's prolactin levels went up

1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:11.280
 or did not go up that predicted

1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:14.680
 whether or not their levels of arousal would go up or not.

1:56:14.680 --> 1:56:17.100
 So if you are somebody who, yes,

1:56:17.100 --> 1:56:20.440
 does experience elevated levels of sexual arousal

1:56:20.440 --> 1:56:23.600
 and function when under the influence of cannabis,

1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:25.160
 well, that's very likely that cannabis

1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:26.880
 does not increase your prolactin levels,

1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:29.080
 at least not to a significant degree

1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:30.440
 while you're taking it.

1:56:30.440 --> 1:56:32.520
 And if you are somebody who does not experience

1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:35.000
 increases in sexual arousal or function

1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:36.940
 or even diminished sexual arousal and function

1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:38.340
 when under the influence of cannabis,

1:56:38.340 --> 1:56:39.740
 it's very likely the cannabis

1:56:39.740 --> 1:56:41.720
 is increasing your levels of prolactin.

1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:44.320
 Unfortunately, there's no way to know or predict

1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:46.360
 based on some other measure.

1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:49.080
 I think the outcome measure that is increased

1:56:49.080 --> 1:56:51.560
 or not increased or even reduced sexual arousal

1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:54.940
 is really the litmus test by which one can figure that out.

1:56:54.940 --> 1:56:57.200
 While we are on the topic of the effects of cannabis

1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:00.320
 on sexual function and hormones like prolactin,

1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:01.640
 it's probably worth mentioning

1:57:01.640 --> 1:57:04.080
 that cannabis has been studied extensively

1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:06.260
 for its impact on other hormones.

1:57:06.260 --> 1:57:09.960
 And we can summarize those literature in the following way.

1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:12.060
 And here I'm referring to studies only on adults.

1:57:12.060 --> 1:57:14.400
 We will talk about the developing brain and body

1:57:14.400 --> 1:57:17.400
 in a little bit, but it is very clear

1:57:17.400 --> 1:57:22.400
 that smoking cannabis increases prolactin levels.

1:57:23.580 --> 1:57:24.440
 Very, very clear.

1:57:24.440 --> 1:57:27.840
 Now you might say, didn't you just describe a study

1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:31.480
 about a set of individuals whose prolactin didn't increase

1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:35.760
 and as a consequence, their level of sexual desire went up?

1:57:35.760 --> 1:57:37.520
 Yes, there are a subset of individuals

1:57:37.520 --> 1:57:38.860
 for which that's true.

1:57:38.860 --> 1:57:43.860
 But people who smoke cannabis do experience increases

1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:46.780
 in prolactin and that's especially pronounced

1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:49.760
 in people that smoke cannabis more than twice a week.

1:57:49.760 --> 1:57:51.480
 So this is important.

1:57:51.480 --> 1:57:54.420
 Prolactin, as I referred to earlier,

1:57:54.420 --> 1:57:59.420
 is reciprocal or mutually inhibitory with dopamine.

1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:01.480
 One way to think about this is in the context

1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:03.600
 of the normal sexual arousal arc

1:58:03.600 --> 1:58:05.380
 whereby dopamine is increased

1:58:05.380 --> 1:58:07.200
 when people are sexually aroused,

1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:10.640
 but then after orgasm, both in males and females,

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.800
 prolactin levels skyrocket.

1:58:12.800 --> 1:58:15.880
 This is actually what creates the so-called refractory period

1:58:15.880 --> 1:58:18.380
 for males during which they cannot achieve erection again

1:58:18.380 --> 1:58:19.580
 for some period of time.

1:58:19.580 --> 1:58:22.360
 That relates directly to how long

1:58:22.360 --> 1:58:25.240
 the prolactin increase lasts, okay?

1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:30.220
 Prolactin is also increased in new parents of all species,

1:58:30.220 --> 1:58:35.220
 including humans, which at least partially explain

1:58:35.220 --> 1:58:38.480
 some of the reported or typical reductions

1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:41.040
 in sexual desire and activity in new parents.

1:58:41.040 --> 1:58:43.140
 Now there are other reasons for that too, sleep deprivation,

1:58:43.140 --> 1:58:46.960
 but nature is smart and has arranged a set of hormones

1:58:46.960 --> 1:58:48.300
 and circuits in the brain and body

1:58:48.300 --> 1:58:50.280
 such that when tending to a newborn

1:58:50.280 --> 1:58:53.100
 is the most important thing, it relegates,

1:58:53.100 --> 1:58:57.780
 it reduces the importance of producing more children

1:58:57.780 --> 1:59:00.060
 and sexual activity in those moments

1:59:00.060 --> 1:59:01.940
 and days and weeks, sometimes longer.

1:59:01.940 --> 1:59:04.520
 So when prolactin levels are up, dopamine levels are down.

1:59:04.520 --> 1:59:06.500
 Smoking marijuana more than twice a week

1:59:06.500 --> 1:59:09.020
 significantly increases prolactin.

1:59:09.020 --> 1:59:12.060
 There are fewer studies exploring whether or not

1:59:12.060 --> 1:59:14.260
 edible marijuana has the same effect,

1:59:14.260 --> 1:59:18.160
 although the preliminary evidence suggests that it does not.

1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:21.180
 I get into this in a lot more detail in a future episode,

1:59:21.180 --> 1:59:24.100
 all about hormones with Dr. Kyle Gillette,

1:59:24.100 --> 1:59:25.900
 who's been on this podcast before,

1:59:25.900 --> 1:59:28.340
 but he verified that and my read of the literature

1:59:28.340 --> 1:59:33.020
 is that the edible forms of marijuana,

1:59:33.020 --> 1:59:35.260
 cannabis, probably, again,

1:59:35.260 --> 1:59:37.060
 let's put an asterisk next to this,

1:59:37.060 --> 1:59:39.400
 but it appears do not have as much

1:59:39.400 --> 1:59:41.060
 of a prolactin elevating effect

1:59:41.060 --> 1:59:45.000
 and therefore not as much of a dopamine suppressive effect

1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:46.140
 and therefore not as much

1:59:46.140 --> 1:59:48.340
 of a testosterone suppressing effect.

1:59:48.340 --> 1:59:50.000
 And that gets to the issue of testosterone.

1:59:50.000 --> 1:59:52.740
 Does cannabis marijuana suppress testosterone?

1:59:52.740 --> 1:59:55.640
 And this is a very controversial literature and here's why.

1:59:56.660 --> 1:59:59.700
 Some studies say, yes, it suppresses testosterone

2:00:00.660 --> 2:00:02.020
 in males and females.

2:00:02.020 --> 2:00:03.700
 And keep in mind that testosterone in females

2:00:03.700 --> 2:00:06.380
 is vital for libido and cognitive function,

2:00:06.380 --> 2:00:08.380
 cellular repair, et cetera.

2:00:08.380 --> 2:00:11.340
 So it's not just important in males, of course.

2:00:11.340 --> 2:00:14.340
 However, other studies say that cannabis

2:00:14.340 --> 2:00:16.500
 does not decrease testosterone.

2:00:16.500 --> 2:00:19.640
 And it seems to depend on whether or not

2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:21.460
 the cannabis is brought into the system

2:00:21.460 --> 2:00:23.620
 by way of smoking or edible.

2:00:23.620 --> 2:00:27.160
 And it seems to depend on whether or not the cannabis

2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:29.980
 is used chronically by an individual or acutely.

2:00:29.980 --> 2:00:32.800
 And here, I just want to zoom out and say that studies

2:00:32.800 --> 2:00:35.160
 on cannabis or drugs of any kind in humans

2:00:35.160 --> 2:00:36.200
 are really complicated.

2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:37.060
 If you think about it,

2:00:37.060 --> 2:00:38.740
 someone has to come into the laboratory.

2:00:38.740 --> 2:00:41.420
 And let's say you want to study chronic cannabis use.

2:00:41.420 --> 2:00:43.940
 Well, you can't keep them in the laboratory all the time.

2:00:43.940 --> 2:00:45.680
 So you have to rely on their self-report

2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:47.900
 of how often they use cannabis and in what form.

2:00:47.900 --> 2:00:50.020
 And you can't really control from one individual

2:00:50.020 --> 2:00:51.940
 to the next of how much cannabis and THC

2:00:51.940 --> 2:00:52.900
 they're bringing into their system.

2:00:52.900 --> 2:00:55.620
 One person might smoke cannabis out of a bong

2:00:55.620 --> 2:01:00.620
 and take big, deep lungs full bong inhalations or such.

2:01:02.260 --> 2:01:04.540
 Other people might smoke joints.

2:01:04.540 --> 2:01:06.100
 Other people might use edibles.

2:01:06.100 --> 2:01:08.420
 It becomes very complicated to know what people have done

2:01:08.420 --> 2:01:10.320
 and that they're reporting it accurately.

2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:12.980
 And no joke here, especially if marijuana

2:01:12.980 --> 2:01:14.940
 is impacting the short-term memory systems.

2:01:14.940 --> 2:01:16.140
 They might not actually remember.

2:01:16.140 --> 2:01:18.620
 They might not be tracking it that well.

2:01:18.620 --> 2:01:21.460
 Contrast that with studies of the acute use of cannabis

2:01:21.460 --> 2:01:24.040
 and THC, where people who are not regular users

2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:25.140
 come into the laboratory.

2:01:25.140 --> 2:01:28.260
 And now suddenly with institutional guidelines

2:01:28.260 --> 2:01:30.580
 and safety protocols are under the influence

2:01:30.580 --> 2:01:31.740
 of THC and cannabis.

2:01:31.740 --> 2:01:32.940
 Well, now you're dealing with a person

2:01:32.940 --> 2:01:37.120
 who may not have experience with the elevated heart rate

2:01:37.120 --> 2:01:39.100
 and blood pressure that's characteristic of cannabis

2:01:39.100 --> 2:01:40.100
 because it is a stimulant,

2:01:40.100 --> 2:01:42.060
 at least when initially brought into the system,

2:01:42.060 --> 2:01:44.380
 even if it might eventually lead to relaxation.

2:01:44.380 --> 2:01:45.780
 So now you've got someone who's anxious

2:01:45.780 --> 2:01:48.780
 or somebody who's not anxious, who's deeply relaxed,

2:01:48.780 --> 2:01:49.980
 and you're trying to study these effects.

2:01:49.980 --> 2:01:52.420
 So it's a moving target of sorts.

2:01:52.420 --> 2:01:56.060
 It's very complicated to study marijuana and cannabis

2:01:56.060 --> 2:01:57.780
 and its various derivatives in this way.

2:01:57.780 --> 2:01:59.860
 Now you can probably appreciate better

2:01:59.860 --> 2:02:02.540
 as to why there's so little nuanced data

2:02:02.540 --> 2:02:04.780
 about sativa versus indica

2:02:04.780 --> 2:02:07.980
 versus different ratios of CBD and THC.

2:02:07.980 --> 2:02:09.740
 It's really difficult to do these studies

2:02:09.740 --> 2:02:10.620
 in the first place.

2:02:10.620 --> 2:02:13.360
 That said, the general rules are smoking marijuana

2:02:13.360 --> 2:02:14.900
 increases prolactin in men and women,

2:02:14.900 --> 2:02:17.260
 which will reduce dopamine and testosterone.

2:02:17.260 --> 2:02:19.920
 Smoking marijuana chronically,

2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:22.380
 meaning more than twice a week,

2:02:22.380 --> 2:02:25.300
 does appear to reduce testosterone significantly

2:02:25.300 --> 2:02:28.580
 and elevate so-called aromatase enzymes,

2:02:28.580 --> 2:02:30.480
 which are the enzymes that convert testosterone

2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:31.520
 into estrogen.

2:02:31.520 --> 2:02:33.740
 This might partially explain the effect

2:02:33.740 --> 2:02:36.540
 that occurs in about 35% of males,

2:02:36.540 --> 2:02:38.340
 which is gynecomastia,

2:02:38.340 --> 2:02:41.060
 which is a development of breast tissue in males,

2:02:41.060 --> 2:02:42.660
 in particular young males

2:02:42.660 --> 2:02:44.500
 who have elevated levels of testosterone

2:02:44.500 --> 2:02:47.320
 or who are taking exogenous testosterone

2:02:47.320 --> 2:02:49.300
 for testosterone replacement therapy,

2:02:49.300 --> 2:02:51.740
 or if they're taking high doses, anabolic steroids,

2:02:51.740 --> 2:02:55.340
 or in females, the increase in breast size,

2:02:55.340 --> 2:02:58.200
 which is due to additional estrogen

2:02:58.200 --> 2:02:59.900
 from testosterone converted to estrogen.

2:02:59.900 --> 2:03:01.780
 So it does appear that marijuana and cannabis

2:03:01.780 --> 2:03:03.700
 increase estrogen, reduce testosterone,

2:03:03.700 --> 2:03:07.420
 increase prolactin, especially in chronic users.

2:03:07.420 --> 2:03:08.900
 Now I'm sure that some people out there will say,

2:03:08.900 --> 2:03:12.320
 well, their testosterone levels are exceedingly high

2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:13.740
 or they are fine,

2:03:13.740 --> 2:03:15.420
 meaning the constellation of symptoms

2:03:15.420 --> 2:03:18.620
 associated with low testosterone and elevated estrogen

2:03:18.620 --> 2:03:20.140
 are not present in them.

2:03:20.140 --> 2:03:25.080
 That probably means one of two things or both.

2:03:25.080 --> 2:03:27.040
 They either had elevated levels of testosterone

2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:28.700
 to begin with, so their ceiling was higher,

2:03:28.700 --> 2:03:30.640
 so bringing it down didn't have that much of effect,

2:03:30.640 --> 2:03:33.460
 or that they have very low levels

2:03:33.460 --> 2:03:35.620
 of aromatase in their system.

2:03:35.620 --> 2:03:38.180
 There are some anecdotal evidence

2:03:38.180 --> 2:03:41.180
 that smoking particular parts of the marijuana plant,

2:03:41.180 --> 2:03:42.740
 in particular the seeds,

2:03:42.740 --> 2:03:45.380
 can increase aromatase

2:03:45.380 --> 2:03:47.380
 in the conversion of testosterone to estrogen.

2:03:47.380 --> 2:03:48.500
 I think in the old days,

2:03:48.500 --> 2:03:50.540
 the lower was the seeds make you sterile,

2:03:50.540 --> 2:03:52.660
 and I think that was related to what I just told you,

2:03:52.660 --> 2:03:55.780
 this increase in conversion of testosterone to estrogen.

2:03:55.780 --> 2:03:57.540
 There's a vast literature

2:03:57.540 --> 2:04:00.740
 on the effects of cannabis on fertility.

2:04:00.740 --> 2:04:05.200
 It does seem, yes, it does seem to alter sperm motility

2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:06.620
 and sperm health and function

2:04:06.620 --> 2:04:08.800
 when taken chronically more than twice per week,

2:04:08.800 --> 2:04:12.100
 in particular high doses of high potency THC.

2:04:12.100 --> 2:04:14.300
 This is something we will cover in far more detail

2:04:14.300 --> 2:04:16.380
 on a future episode all about fertility.

2:04:16.380 --> 2:04:19.540
 And in females, there's an increase in estrogen

2:04:19.540 --> 2:04:22.460
 as a consequence of smoking marijuana

2:04:22.460 --> 2:04:26.420
 and increasing prolactin and estrogen in parallel.

2:04:26.420 --> 2:04:29.060
 Whether or not that's detrimental isn't clear,

2:04:29.060 --> 2:04:33.760
 although I point out that elevated estrogen and prolactin

2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:36.180
 can be associated, again, can be associated,

2:04:36.180 --> 2:04:38.620
 not necessarily, and certainly not causative,

2:04:38.620 --> 2:04:41.540
 but can be associated with elevated levels

2:04:41.540 --> 2:04:43.580
 or frequency of breast cancer detection.

2:04:43.580 --> 2:04:46.020
 So cannabis and its effects on hormones

2:04:46.020 --> 2:04:47.600
 are not without consequence.

2:04:48.840 --> 2:04:52.100
 There are effects of cannabis on cortisol.

2:04:52.100 --> 2:04:54.660
 In some individuals, it greatly increases cortisol

2:04:54.660 --> 2:04:57.980
 due to the anxiety and paranoia it can create,

2:04:57.980 --> 2:05:00.300
 and in other individuals, it reduces cortisol.

2:05:00.300 --> 2:05:02.220
 Again, we have these divergent effects,

2:05:02.220 --> 2:05:03.700
 but I want to be very clear.

2:05:03.700 --> 2:05:05.940
 The effects on prolactin, meaning elevated prolactin,

2:05:05.940 --> 2:05:07.980
 the effects on testosterone, meaning,

2:05:07.980 --> 2:05:10.780
 at least most studies point to reduced levels of testosterone

2:05:10.780 --> 2:05:12.460
 and increased estrogen,

2:05:12.460 --> 2:05:15.380
 that seems to be true for most all individuals

2:05:15.380 --> 2:05:17.720
 that chronically use cannabis.

2:05:17.720 --> 2:05:21.380
 Whereas the effects on cortisol tend to be divergent,

2:05:21.380 --> 2:05:23.620
 cannabis increases cortisol in some individuals

2:05:23.620 --> 2:05:25.220
 and decreases cortisol in others.

2:05:25.220 --> 2:05:28.640
 In general, increases in cortisol that are ongoing

2:05:28.640 --> 2:05:31.940
 are not healthy for us and so on.

2:05:31.940 --> 2:05:34.500
 And then of course, there are other effects on hormones,

2:05:34.500 --> 2:05:35.900
 and I'll just briefly summarize those,

2:05:35.900 --> 2:05:39.820
 that THC in particular, not CBD, but THC in particular,

2:05:39.820 --> 2:05:41.640
 is known to be strongly inhibitory

2:05:41.640 --> 2:05:43.940
 for something called gonadotropin-releasing hormone.

2:05:43.940 --> 2:05:45.980
 This is a hormone that's released from the brain,

2:05:45.980 --> 2:05:49.460
 from the hypothalamus, that then feeds onto,

2:05:49.460 --> 2:05:51.640
 or I should say, signals to the pituitary gland,

2:05:51.640 --> 2:05:52.980
 which is also near the roof of your mouth.

2:05:52.980 --> 2:05:54.460
 A lot of stuff happening near the roof of your mouth,

2:05:54.460 --> 2:05:56.060
 it turns out, biologically.

2:05:56.060 --> 2:05:59.220
 And reduced levels of gonadotropin-releasing hormone

2:05:59.220 --> 2:06:00.460
 caused by cannabis use,

2:06:00.460 --> 2:06:03.620
 reduced levels of LH, luteinizing hormone, and FSH,

2:06:03.620 --> 2:06:05.880
 which reduce levels of testosterone

2:06:05.880 --> 2:06:08.080
 and sperm production in males,

2:06:08.080 --> 2:06:12.240
 and egg health and ovulation

2:06:12.240 --> 2:06:14.940
 and menstrual function in females.

2:06:14.940 --> 2:06:17.860
 Now, I'm sure there are a number of women out there

2:06:17.860 --> 2:06:19.900
 who will say they have perfectly normal menstrual cycles

2:06:19.900 --> 2:06:22.100
 despite using cannabis.

2:06:22.100 --> 2:06:24.500
 I'm certainly not going to dispute that.

2:06:24.500 --> 2:06:28.140
 But if you are somebody who's trying to maximize fertility

2:06:28.140 --> 2:06:30.840
 or regulate or balance hormones,

2:06:30.840 --> 2:06:34.140
 marijuana and cannabis reduces GnRH,

2:06:35.140 --> 2:06:38.620
 that is the gonadotropin released from the hypothalamus,

2:06:38.620 --> 2:06:40.700
 and thereby reduces luteinizing hormone

2:06:40.700 --> 2:06:42.180
 and follicle-stimulating hormone,

2:06:42.180 --> 2:06:43.820
 which are released from the pituitary

2:06:43.820 --> 2:06:45.460
 and travel in the bloodstream

2:06:45.460 --> 2:06:48.540
 to support normal ovarian function and health

2:06:48.540 --> 2:06:51.080
 and normal testicular function and health

2:06:51.080 --> 2:06:53.220
 in females and males, respectively.

2:06:53.220 --> 2:06:55.300
 Up until now, I've been discussing the biological

2:06:55.300 --> 2:06:57.920
 and psychological effects of cannabis.

2:06:57.920 --> 2:06:59.380
 Now, I'd like to shift our attention

2:06:59.380 --> 2:07:02.500
 to some of the negative health effects of cannabis

2:07:02.500 --> 2:07:05.440
 and shine light on some of the individuals

2:07:05.440 --> 2:07:08.860
 or groups out there that need to be especially wary of

2:07:08.860 --> 2:07:11.700
 and probably avoid cannabis use entirely,

2:07:11.700 --> 2:07:16.180
 including ingestion of cannabis by way of edible.

2:07:16.180 --> 2:07:17.300
 And I frame things that way

2:07:17.300 --> 2:07:20.060
 because I think there is an increasingly large number

2:07:20.060 --> 2:07:22.620
 of people out there that appreciate

2:07:22.620 --> 2:07:27.320
 that smoking tobacco or smoking cannabis,

2:07:27.320 --> 2:07:31.800
 vaping tobacco, yes, vaping tobacco or vaping cannabis,

2:07:32.840 --> 2:07:35.900
 each and all have negative health consequences

2:07:35.900 --> 2:07:38.860
 on the lungs and on the so-called endothelial cells

2:07:38.860 --> 2:07:41.200
 of the body, the cells that make up the vasculature,

2:07:41.200 --> 2:07:43.360
 the capillaries and blood vessels.

2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:45.120
 If you don't already know this,

2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.600
 I'll make it very clear and I'll make it very brief.

2:07:48.600 --> 2:07:53.440
 Whether or not you smoke or vape tobacco or cannabis,

2:07:53.440 --> 2:07:56.240
 you are severely impairing the function

2:07:56.240 --> 2:07:58.860
 of endothelial cells that make up the capillaries

2:07:58.860 --> 2:08:01.140
 and blood vessels of your brain and body.

2:08:01.140 --> 2:08:05.800
 And that is known to decrease cognitive capacity over time,

2:08:05.800 --> 2:08:07.600
 increase probability of strokes,

2:08:07.600 --> 2:08:10.980
 severely impact lung function,

2:08:10.980 --> 2:08:14.360
 and also lead to things like peripheral neuropathies.

2:08:14.360 --> 2:08:16.280
 It leads to sexual dysfunction

2:08:16.280 --> 2:08:19.660
 because of lack of blood flow to the genitals,

2:08:19.660 --> 2:08:22.480
 can lead to other aspects of reproductive damage,

2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:25.080
 including to the ovaries and testes.

2:08:25.080 --> 2:08:27.200
 Essentially, there is no other way to state it

2:08:27.200 --> 2:08:30.020
 except that smoking and vaping

2:08:30.020 --> 2:08:32.460
 have negative health consequences

2:08:32.460 --> 2:08:35.620
 that are independent of the substances

2:08:36.540 --> 2:08:38.980
 that people are trying to get into their bloodstream

2:08:38.980 --> 2:08:40.280
 by smoking or vaping.

2:08:40.280 --> 2:08:41.960
 So people smoke and vape tobacco

2:08:41.960 --> 2:08:44.160
 and people smoke and vape cannabis.

2:08:44.160 --> 2:08:45.640
 And in both cases,

2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:49.000
 if we just set aside the direct effects of tobacco

2:08:49.000 --> 2:08:52.420
 and the direct effects of cannabis,

2:08:52.420 --> 2:08:56.060
 we can confidently say that the process of smoking,

2:08:56.060 --> 2:08:57.760
 of inhaling smoke into the lungs,

2:08:57.760 --> 2:08:59.680
 and yes, also vaping,

2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:04.680
 bringing the chemicals that transport nicotine,

2:09:04.760 --> 2:09:08.120
 or in this case, cannabis into the lungs by way of vaping,

2:09:08.120 --> 2:09:11.500
 are both severely detrimental to endothelial cells.

2:09:11.500 --> 2:09:14.360
 I think a few years ago when vaping wasn't as prominent,

2:09:14.360 --> 2:09:16.360
 there was this question and this idea

2:09:16.360 --> 2:09:18.840
 that maybe vaping was going to be far healthier

2:09:18.840 --> 2:09:22.640
 or at least not as bad as smoking,

2:09:22.640 --> 2:09:24.880
 but now we can see a huge number

2:09:24.880 --> 2:09:26.460
 of negative health effects of vaping,

2:09:26.460 --> 2:09:29.200
 some of which are distinct from the effects of smoking.

2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:32.320
 So if you'd like more information on smoking versus vaping,

2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:34.280
 please see the episode that I did on nicotine.

2:09:34.280 --> 2:09:36.080
 We will also do an entire episode

2:09:36.080 --> 2:09:38.600
 all about vaping in the future,

2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:41.360
 but there's really no way to slice it and dice it

2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:42.600
 or candy code it.

2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:45.560
 The fact of the matter is that smoking has clear

2:09:45.560 --> 2:09:48.080
 and severe negative health consequences,

2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:50.480
 regardless of whether or not you're smoking tobacco

2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:52.820
 or cannabis, THC,

2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:57.780
 and vaping has negative health consequences,

2:09:57.780 --> 2:09:59.400
 whether or not you're using the vape

2:09:59.400 --> 2:10:01.720
 to bring in nicotine or THC

2:10:01.720 --> 2:10:04.240
 or some combination of THC and CBD.

2:10:04.240 --> 2:10:05.560
 That's simply the way it is.

2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:07.680
 With that said, now I'd like to focus our attention

2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:10.480
 on the direct effects that cannabis has,

2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:15.160
 either by way of THC action or by way of CBD action

2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:18.240
 in terms of positive or negative health effects

2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:19.200
 on the brain and body.

2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:22.920
 And we're going to explore that first as a function of age.

2:10:22.920 --> 2:10:26.080
 And the reason we're going to do that is related to a fact

2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:27.960
 that I mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:31.520
 which is that the CB1 and the CB2 receptors,

2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:33.960
 the two receptors for cannabis

2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:36.640
 to which THC and CBD and CBN

2:10:36.640 --> 2:10:40.760
 and all other psychoactive compounds in cannabis bind to

2:10:40.760 --> 2:10:45.320
 to have their actions are present throughout development.

2:10:45.320 --> 2:10:46.160
 Believe it or not,

2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:49.340
 they are present very soon after conception

2:10:49.340 --> 2:10:53.560
 and the CB1 and CB2 receptors actually play a critical role

2:10:53.560 --> 2:10:55.760
 in the development of the fetus.

2:10:55.760 --> 2:10:58.400
 Now you might wonder why that is

2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:00.400
 because of course the developing fetus

2:11:00.400 --> 2:11:02.560
 doesn't necessarily expect to see cannabis

2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:05.840
 or to be exposed to cannabis and THC and CBD.

2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:10.600
 But as you recall, endogenous cannabinoids are present

2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:12.160
 in the adult brain and body

2:11:12.160 --> 2:11:14.880
 and endogenous cannabinoids it turns out

2:11:14.880 --> 2:11:16.920
 are also present in the developing fetus.

2:11:16.920 --> 2:11:19.560
 In fact, endogenous cannabinoids are present

2:11:19.560 --> 2:11:22.180
 at much greater levels than the developing fetus

2:11:22.180 --> 2:11:25.840
 than they are after a child is born.

2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:27.800
 And levels of endogenous cannabinoids

2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:30.240
 actually go down across development.

2:11:30.240 --> 2:11:31.520
 I find this really interesting.

2:11:31.520 --> 2:11:34.060
 What this means is that endogenous cannabinoids

2:11:34.060 --> 2:11:37.040
 and activation of the CB1 and CB2 receptors

2:11:37.040 --> 2:11:40.320
 are an integral part of neural development.

2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:42.200
 And this is going to become especially relevant

2:11:42.200 --> 2:11:44.080
 in considering whether or not pregnant mothers

2:11:44.080 --> 2:11:48.180
 should or should not use cannabis or CBD.

2:11:48.180 --> 2:11:51.240
 And it also points to some very interesting biology

2:11:52.540 --> 2:11:54.280
 in terms of how the brain develops

2:11:54.280 --> 2:11:55.640
 and how the body develops.

2:11:55.640 --> 2:11:58.920
 Now the development of the brain and nervous system and body

2:11:58.920 --> 2:12:01.140
 is a fascinating and vast literature,

2:12:01.140 --> 2:12:04.120
 certainly far too vast to cover in today's episode,

2:12:04.120 --> 2:12:06.880
 especially at this late hour, as it were.

2:12:06.880 --> 2:12:08.780
 But we will have a future episode

2:12:08.780 --> 2:12:10.840
 all about brain development.

2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:12.880
 In terms of the effects of cannabis,

2:12:13.720 --> 2:12:17.360
 it's sufficient to say that cannabinoid receptors

2:12:17.360 --> 2:12:21.160
 are present and active in the developing fetus.

2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:23.480
 They are present and active in the newborn.

2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:26.000
 They are present and active in adolescents.

2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:30.080
 And across that time from conception until adolescence,

2:12:30.080 --> 2:12:32.820
 endogenous cannabinoids are mainly responsible

2:12:32.820 --> 2:12:35.940
 for the actions of those cannabinoid receptors.

2:12:35.940 --> 2:12:37.900
 During that time, the cannabinoid receptors

2:12:37.900 --> 2:12:39.780
 are having very specific effects

2:12:39.780 --> 2:12:42.320
 that are distinct from their effects later in life.

2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:44.160
 And those effects can largely be explained

2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:45.500
 in terms of neural development.

2:12:45.500 --> 2:12:49.160
 Again, we don't have time for an entire lecture on this now,

2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:51.600
 but during development,

2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:54.280
 your body was a collection of a bunch of cells.

2:12:54.280 --> 2:12:55.920
 It's actually called a blastula,

2:12:55.920 --> 2:12:57.260
 which means a ball of cells.

2:12:57.260 --> 2:12:59.700
 And then those cells actually have to grow out connections

2:12:59.700 --> 2:13:01.360
 and duplicate themselves.

2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:03.240
 And this is a very interesting process

2:13:03.240 --> 2:13:06.120
 by which neurons initially are situated far apart,

2:13:06.120 --> 2:13:07.680
 and then they grow out connections

2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:09.000
 and make contacts with one another.

2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:10.280
 They remove certain connections,

2:13:10.280 --> 2:13:13.260
 depending on what kind of life events you're exposed to.

2:13:13.260 --> 2:13:15.520
 If you have a wonderful event early in life

2:13:15.520 --> 2:13:17.480
 or a traumatic early life,

2:13:17.480 --> 2:13:19.340
 those connections change, et cetera.

2:13:20.300 --> 2:13:21.840
 The important point for today's discussion

2:13:21.840 --> 2:13:25.080
 is that the CB1 receptor in particular

2:13:25.080 --> 2:13:28.680
 is expressed on every neuron in the developing brain

2:13:28.680 --> 2:13:30.020
 and has been shown to be important

2:13:30.020 --> 2:13:33.060
 for every aspect of neural development,

2:13:33.060 --> 2:13:35.160
 from the proliferation of cells,

2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:37.500
 meaning getting enough cells to create a brain,

2:13:37.500 --> 2:13:40.000
 to the outgrowth of the so-called axons,

2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:43.220
 the little wires that connect up neurons with one another,

2:13:43.220 --> 2:13:45.560
 to the steering, the direction

2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:50.560
 at which those axons go in development, which is essential.

2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:54.200
 And even so far as to explain the connections

2:13:54.200 --> 2:13:56.760
 that form between neurons, the so-called synapses,

2:13:56.760 --> 2:13:58.660
 and then how those synapses work.

2:13:58.660 --> 2:14:02.920
 So the basic statement here is that endogenous cannabinoids

2:14:02.920 --> 2:14:05.080
 and CB1 receptor activation are critical

2:14:05.080 --> 2:14:08.040
 for every aspect of brain wiring and development.

2:14:08.900 --> 2:14:11.380
 With that in mind, the statement I'm about to make

2:14:11.380 --> 2:14:14.160
 is absolutely terrifying, at least to me,

2:14:14.160 --> 2:14:17.000
 and frankly, it should be terrifying to you as well.

2:14:17.000 --> 2:14:21.720
 And the statement is the current statistics

2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:25.440
 on cannabis use in pregnant mothers

2:14:25.440 --> 2:14:27.560
 is absolutely shocking.

2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:30.080
 The most recent survey of pregnant mothers

2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:33.720
 in the United States show that 15%, one five,

2:14:33.720 --> 2:14:37.620
 15% of pregnant mothers report using cannabis

2:14:37.620 --> 2:14:40.460
 in some form or another, either smoking it

2:14:40.460 --> 2:14:43.840
 or more likely ingestion of an edible,

2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:46.160
 because they are aware of the negative effects of smoking

2:14:46.160 --> 2:14:49.040
 on the developing fetus, ingestion of an edible

2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:53.540
 to increase THC and or CBD during pregnancy,

2:14:53.540 --> 2:14:56.920
 which to me, I have to say as a developmental neurobiologist

2:14:56.920 --> 2:15:00.480
 is frankly, it's scary.

2:15:00.480 --> 2:15:03.560
 It's absolutely scary because that CB1 receptor

2:15:03.560 --> 2:15:06.320
 is not just a minor player in neural development,

2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:09.440
 it is absolutely central to every critical aspect

2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:11.520
 of brain wiring and development.

2:15:11.520 --> 2:15:12.940
 Now, the long-term implications

2:15:12.940 --> 2:15:15.740
 or even the short-term implications of this 15%

2:15:15.740 --> 2:15:18.880
 of mothers self-reporting the use of cannabis

2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:22.160
 at some point during pregnancy are not yet known.

2:15:22.160 --> 2:15:25.720
 This is, as we would say, it's an experiment that's ongoing,

2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:28.560
 but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out these data

2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:31.400
 and just implore you, please, please, please,

2:15:31.400 --> 2:15:33.300
 if you are pregnant or considering getting pregnant,

2:15:33.300 --> 2:15:35.440
 you're a cannabis user, whether or not you're using edibles,

2:15:35.440 --> 2:15:40.440
 if you're a CBD user, please do whatever is necessary

2:15:41.280 --> 2:15:45.100
 to not ingest cannabis or smoke cannabis

2:15:45.100 --> 2:15:47.760
 or ingest CBD during pregnancy.

2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:50.080
 Now, there may be certain clinical indications

2:15:50.080 --> 2:15:53.280
 by which your physician and your OBGYN

2:15:53.280 --> 2:15:55.520
 and the pediatrician that will eventually

2:15:55.520 --> 2:16:00.520
 be the pediatrician for your child will prescribe CBD,

2:16:00.700 --> 2:16:02.400
 although it's hard to imagine what those are.

2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:07.360
 I contacted a number of different pediatricians and OBGYNs

2:16:07.360 --> 2:16:10.460
 and not a single one said they would ever suggest

2:16:10.460 --> 2:16:12.960
 and in fact would strongly discourage their patients

2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:15.980
 from using cannabis during pregnancy.

2:16:15.980 --> 2:16:20.880
 But I think that the advent of edible forms of cannabis

2:16:20.880 --> 2:16:25.800
 and the combination of THC and CBD in certain products

2:16:25.800 --> 2:16:28.760
 and the fact that most people view CBD as safer

2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:32.120
 because it does not include as, or does not have,

2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:35.200
 I should say, the psychoactive effects that THC does

2:16:35.200 --> 2:16:39.560
 has led to a situation where you have 15%

2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:41.340
 of pregnant mothers using cannabis

2:16:41.340 --> 2:16:43.080
 at some point during pregnancy

2:16:43.080 --> 2:16:45.400
 and maybe even frequently throughout pregnancy

2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:47.280
 and the effects on the developing fetus

2:16:47.280 --> 2:16:49.040
 are completely unknown,

2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:54.040
 but recall that cannabis and THC and CBD out-compete,

2:16:54.800 --> 2:16:56.860
 meaning they park in the receptor

2:16:56.860 --> 2:16:58.600
 for endogenous cannabinoids

2:16:58.600 --> 2:17:01.160
 and prevent endogenous cannabinoids

2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:04.480
 from having their normal level and pattern of action.

2:17:04.480 --> 2:17:06.060
 So this is absolutely critical.

2:17:06.060 --> 2:17:08.560
 I cannot encourage you enough, or rather I should say,

2:17:08.560 --> 2:17:12.720
 I cannot discourage enough the use of cannabis

2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:16.320
 and any related compounds in cannabis,

2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:18.320
 edible or smoked, certainly not smoked,

2:17:18.320 --> 2:17:21.160
 but even edible during pregnancy.

2:17:21.160 --> 2:17:25.420
 And certainly in breastfeeding lactating mothers,

2:17:25.420 --> 2:17:26.400
 the same is also true.

2:17:26.400 --> 2:17:30.000
 Recall that cannabis and THC and CBD

2:17:30.000 --> 2:17:32.320
 are incredibly lipophilic.

2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:35.800
 They are fat soluble and they get into cells very readily

2:17:35.800 --> 2:17:37.240
 and they cross the blood brain barrier,

2:17:37.240 --> 2:17:39.720
 they cross the blood placental barrier.

2:17:39.720 --> 2:17:41.520
 So when I encountered this statistic,

2:17:41.520 --> 2:17:43.500
 I had to kind of wipe my eyes a few times.

2:17:43.500 --> 2:17:44.680
 I could not believe it.

2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:46.840
 And yet I cross-checked that number

2:17:46.840 --> 2:17:47.920
 with a few other studies.

2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:50.200
 A few others have come in a little bit lower at,

2:17:50.200 --> 2:17:51.920
 somewhere like 13 to 14%

2:17:51.920 --> 2:17:53.280
 and a few have come in a little bit higher,

2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:57.380
 but the average of 15% is both striking and shocking.

2:17:57.380 --> 2:17:59.400
 So I don't know how to make the message more clear.

2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:00.560
 I hope that is clear.

2:18:00.560 --> 2:18:05.560
 Please do not use any cannabis, THC or related things,

2:18:06.600 --> 2:18:09.320
 including CBD, smoked or edible.

2:18:09.320 --> 2:18:12.860
 If you're pregnant, lactating, et cetera.

2:18:12.860 --> 2:18:15.240
 Now we are at the point where we need to consider

2:18:15.240 --> 2:18:17.120
 some of the negative health effects of cannabis

2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:19.600
 that have been well-documented in peer-reviewed studies.

2:18:19.600 --> 2:18:20.920
 And before I do this,

2:18:20.920 --> 2:18:22.640
 I want to return to a point that I made earlier,

2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:25.380
 which is that nothing that I am about to say

2:18:25.380 --> 2:18:28.100
 relates directly to issues of legality.

2:18:28.100 --> 2:18:30.440
 If we consider alcohol, for instance,

2:18:30.440 --> 2:18:32.900
 alcohol is legal in most areas of the world.

2:18:32.900 --> 2:18:34.780
 It's certainly legal in the US

2:18:34.780 --> 2:18:37.960
 and yet there's an age limit for its use.

2:18:37.960 --> 2:18:39.920
 Typically it's not available to people

2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:41.640
 until they're 21 or older.

2:18:41.640 --> 2:18:43.200
 It's not to say that certain people don't use it

2:18:43.200 --> 2:18:46.960
 before age 21, but it's not legal.

2:18:46.960 --> 2:18:50.080
 It is illegal to buy or possess alcohol,

2:18:50.080 --> 2:18:52.160
 consume alcohol before age 21.

2:18:52.160 --> 2:18:53.420
 And I think with good reason,

2:18:53.420 --> 2:18:55.980
 because the brain is still developing.

2:18:55.980 --> 2:19:00.980
 Likewise, we can have a informed discussion about cannabis

2:19:01.700 --> 2:19:03.420
 and its various components

2:19:03.420 --> 2:19:06.680
 that can fully acknowledge the reality,

2:19:06.680 --> 2:19:11.660
 which is that one of the major harms of cannabis in the past

2:19:11.660 --> 2:19:15.260
 has been the legal ramifications of cannabis being illegal.

2:19:16.160 --> 2:19:18.980
 That's a statement that is no longer controversial.

2:19:18.980 --> 2:19:21.000
 And this is not a discussion about legalization

2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:22.280
 or non-legalization.

2:19:22.280 --> 2:19:24.240
 If you look to the scientific literature,

2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:26.720
 the epidemiological literature,

2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:29.320
 there are wonderful data out of Carleton University

2:19:29.320 --> 2:19:32.440
 and elsewhere in Canada showing that

2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:36.360
 many of the negative effects of marijuana

2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:41.120
 and THC are due to the criminal justice system itself.

2:19:41.120 --> 2:19:45.600
 That is the creation of illicit drug businesses,

2:19:45.600 --> 2:19:47.760
 the creation of organized crime,

2:19:47.760 --> 2:19:50.200
 the creation of a number of different features

2:19:50.200 --> 2:19:54.200
 related to the illegality of cannabis.

2:19:54.200 --> 2:19:57.280
 And again, this isn't the topic of today's episode,

2:19:57.280 --> 2:19:59.240
 but that should be acknowledged.

2:19:59.240 --> 2:20:02.040
 And at the same time, we need to acknowledge that

2:20:02.040 --> 2:20:05.680
 when a compound, a drug or whatever you want to call it,

2:20:05.680 --> 2:20:08.960
 becomes legal, there's a tendency to assume

2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:11.200
 that it's safe and safe for everybody.

2:20:11.200 --> 2:20:15.840
 And with respect to cannabis and THC and perhaps even CBD,

2:20:15.840 --> 2:20:20.800
 but certainly for THC and cannabis that's smoked or vaped

2:20:20.800 --> 2:20:24.760
 or consumed in edible form, that is simply not the case.

2:20:24.760 --> 2:20:28.420
 There are clear data pointing to negative health effects

2:20:28.420 --> 2:20:30.440
 of cannabis use and THC use,

2:20:30.440 --> 2:20:32.480
 which again is not to say that there are not

2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:36.000
 positive effects on mood, anxiety, pain relief, et cetera.

2:20:36.000 --> 2:20:37.520
 Those are out there and they exist,

2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:39.200
 and we will mention some of those, of course,

2:20:39.200 --> 2:20:40.780
 and we've talked about some of those,

2:20:40.780 --> 2:20:42.900
 creativity, for instance, et cetera.

2:20:42.900 --> 2:20:46.280
 But if we do not acknowledge the negative health effects

2:20:46.280 --> 2:20:48.320
 that are documented in the literature,

2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:51.520
 then we are overlooking some very important data,

2:20:51.520 --> 2:20:54.960
 especially as it relates to the development of psychosis

2:20:54.960 --> 2:20:56.960
 in certain individuals.

2:20:56.960 --> 2:21:01.180
 So with that said, there are very strong data,

2:21:01.180 --> 2:21:03.280
 and I will provide links to these resources,

2:21:03.280 --> 2:21:04.840
 pointing to the fact that for people

2:21:04.840 --> 2:21:07.180
 who are chronic users of cannabis,

2:21:07.180 --> 2:21:09.720
 that is using it twice a week or more,

2:21:09.720 --> 2:21:13.560
 that over time their levels of anxiety actually increase.

2:21:13.560 --> 2:21:15.580
 And this is true even for individuals

2:21:15.580 --> 2:21:17.200
 that are using strains of cannabis

2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:21.460
 that while under the influence of cannabis, reduce anxiety.

2:21:21.460 --> 2:21:26.460
 Over time, meaning over the course of 12 or more months,

2:21:26.500 --> 2:21:29.500
 there is a well-documented effect

2:21:29.500 --> 2:21:34.500
 of the anxiety relief that cannabis and THC initially brought

2:21:35.220 --> 2:21:36.840
 being less and less potent.

2:21:36.840 --> 2:21:41.320
 That is, people need to smoke more of it or ingest more THC

2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:44.240
 in order to achieve the same level of anxiety relief.

2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:47.960
 And in some cases, a switch from anxiety relief

2:21:47.960 --> 2:21:50.080
 to increase in anxiety.

2:21:50.080 --> 2:21:52.420
 And again, that's increase in anxiety,

2:21:52.420 --> 2:21:55.860
 not just when the drug is not being consumed,

2:21:55.860 --> 2:21:58.600
 but also while under the influence of the drug.

2:21:58.600 --> 2:21:59.900
 Why would that be?

2:21:59.900 --> 2:22:01.760
 We have to go back to our understanding

2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:05.000
 of the CB1 receptor and the potency

2:22:05.000 --> 2:22:08.200
 with which THC binds to that CB1 receptor.

2:22:09.240 --> 2:22:12.660
 When THC is brought into the system over and over again,

2:22:13.640 --> 2:22:16.000
 meaning twice a week or more,

2:22:16.000 --> 2:22:19.320
 the binding of THC to that CB1 receptor

2:22:19.320 --> 2:22:23.480
 eventually causes a sort of habituation or attenuation

2:22:23.480 --> 2:22:26.740
 of the entire process of binding the receptor

2:22:26.740 --> 2:22:28.680
 and creating the psychoactive effects.

2:22:28.680 --> 2:22:30.720
 So initially it creates anxiety relief,

2:22:30.720 --> 2:22:35.080
 but over time the affinity for the receptor doesn't change,

2:22:35.080 --> 2:22:36.600
 meaning it can still park in that slot

2:22:36.600 --> 2:22:39.360
 with a lot of affinity, a lot of strength,

2:22:39.360 --> 2:22:43.120
 but there are fewer receptors available.

2:22:43.120 --> 2:22:46.540
 And then the signaling that's downstream of those receptors

2:22:46.540 --> 2:22:48.720
 becomes less and less robust.

2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:50.800
 Now, this is a topic we didn't get into

2:22:50.800 --> 2:22:52.380
 in too much detail today,

2:22:52.380 --> 2:22:55.240
 because I didn't want to include even more biological detail,

2:22:55.240 --> 2:22:56.880
 but the CB1 receptor

2:22:56.880 --> 2:23:00.180
 is a so-called G protein-coupled receptor.

2:23:00.180 --> 2:23:02.660
 That's a mouthful, but a G protein-coupled receptor

2:23:02.660 --> 2:23:04.800
 basically is like a bucket brigade.

2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:06.620
 So while some receptors in the brain and body

2:23:06.620 --> 2:23:09.960
 are such that when something, a chemical binds to them,

2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:11.640
 that receptor has a direct action,

2:23:11.640 --> 2:23:14.060
 like it opens and allows stuff to rush into the cell,

2:23:14.060 --> 2:23:16.280
 increases the excitability of the cell,

2:23:16.280 --> 2:23:18.000
 so-called fast effects.

2:23:18.000 --> 2:23:20.360
 These G protein-coupled receptors,

2:23:20.360 --> 2:23:23.560
 and CB1 is a G protein-coupled receptor,

2:23:23.560 --> 2:23:25.000
 they are more like a bucket brigade,

2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:28.320
 where they kick off a process through one molecule

2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:30.720
 that then is handed off to another molecule,

2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:32.820
 that this then is handed off to another molecule.

2:23:32.820 --> 2:23:36.160
 It's a long chain or cascade of events.

2:23:36.160 --> 2:23:38.660
 Those long chains or cascades of events

2:23:38.660 --> 2:23:42.280
 have a lot of opportunity for regulation, for adjustment.

2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:44.080
 You know, receptor systems in the brain and body,

2:23:44.080 --> 2:23:46.400
 especially receptor systems like the cannabinoid system

2:23:46.400 --> 2:23:49.320
 that are used to being kind of tickled, not punched,

2:23:49.320 --> 2:23:51.360
 you know, tickled by endogenous cannabinoids

2:23:51.360 --> 2:23:53.940
 every once in a while, some binds, has an effect,

2:23:53.940 --> 2:23:58.080
 but certainly not bound with incredible potency

2:23:58.080 --> 2:23:59.080
 and over and over again,

2:23:59.080 --> 2:24:01.520
 as they are when THC is coming into the system.

2:24:01.520 --> 2:24:03.140
 Well, those systems, eventually over time,

2:24:03.140 --> 2:24:07.040
 they adjust themselves so that the body and those cells

2:24:07.040 --> 2:24:09.360
 can achieve so-called homeostasis.

2:24:09.360 --> 2:24:13.740
 So when people are using THC more than twice a week,

2:24:13.740 --> 2:24:16.240
 what ends up happening is those G protein-coupled receptors

2:24:16.240 --> 2:24:17.960
 and the downstream signaling mechanisms

2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:19.480
 start to adjust themselves,

2:24:19.480 --> 2:24:23.280
 and it requires more and more drug,

2:24:23.280 --> 2:24:26.020
 so either higher dosages or more frequent use.

2:24:26.960 --> 2:24:29.380
 And a lot of the positive effects,

2:24:29.380 --> 2:24:30.880
 the so-called decrease in anxiety,

2:24:30.880 --> 2:24:32.660
 increased focus, increased creativity,

2:24:32.660 --> 2:24:34.120
 some of that starts to wane.

2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:35.160
 It starts to dissipate,

2:24:35.160 --> 2:24:37.820
 and people wonder why they have to use so much cannabis

2:24:37.820 --> 2:24:40.440
 just to achieve a fraction of the effect

2:24:40.440 --> 2:24:44.520
 that they used to be able to achieve with even a lower dose.

2:24:44.520 --> 2:24:46.660
 So anxiety is getting worse over time,

2:24:46.660 --> 2:24:49.240
 and that's anxiety during the drug use

2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:51.140
 and outside of the drug use.

2:24:51.140 --> 2:24:54.940
 Some people work around that or try to work around that

2:24:54.940 --> 2:24:57.920
 by using varying strains of cannabis

2:24:57.920 --> 2:25:01.620
 or changing the pattern of delivery from smoking to vaping

2:25:01.620 --> 2:25:04.720
 or from vaping to edible and from edible to transdermal.

2:25:04.720 --> 2:25:06.720
 Anyway, they go through a lot of gymnastics

2:25:06.720 --> 2:25:09.860
 and writhing and seeking,

2:25:09.860 --> 2:25:12.820
 but nonetheless, anxiety increases over time.

2:25:12.820 --> 2:25:17.400
 Also, it's very clear that depression increases over time,

2:25:17.400 --> 2:25:19.600
 and especially, this is surprising to me,

2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:22.740
 but especially for individuals that were not depressed

2:25:22.740 --> 2:25:24.260
 at the outset of their use.

2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:25.840
 In other words, they didn't start using cannabis

2:25:25.840 --> 2:25:27.480
 because they were depressed,

2:25:27.480 --> 2:25:30.660
 but rather the depression starts to emerge

2:25:30.660 --> 2:25:34.300
 as a consequence of the cannabis and THC use.

2:25:34.300 --> 2:25:35.220
 So that's serious.

2:25:35.220 --> 2:25:37.760
 In fact, we now know,

2:25:37.760 --> 2:25:40.200
 based on really solid epidemiological evidence,

2:25:40.200 --> 2:25:43.020
 that depression is not a strong predictor

2:25:43.020 --> 2:25:45.440
 of seeking out cannabis.

2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:48.080
 It doesn't drive terribly many people

2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:50.000
 to seek out cannabis use,

2:25:50.000 --> 2:25:54.440
 but cannabis use itself makes people four times likelier

2:25:54.440 --> 2:25:57.600
 to develop a chronic major depression.

2:25:57.600 --> 2:26:01.600
 So anxiety is increasing, depression is increasing,

2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:05.000
 and this turns out to be especially relevant

2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:06.800
 and important to young people.

2:26:06.800 --> 2:26:07.720
 Why do I say that?

2:26:07.720 --> 2:26:09.360
 Well, if you look at the data,

2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:11.480
 and again, I think some of the strongest data

2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:13.880
 or data to come out of the Canadian system,

2:26:13.880 --> 2:26:15.920
 they've done some really beautiful controlled studies.

2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:18.400
 I really hope to invite some of the people

2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:20.680
 who arranged and ran those studies

2:26:20.680 --> 2:26:22.820
 as guests onto the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:26:22.820 --> 2:26:25.560
 But if you look at the data out of Canada

2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:26.600
 or you look at some of the data

2:26:26.600 --> 2:26:28.360
 out of Northern Europe and the US,

2:26:28.360 --> 2:26:31.120
 what you find is that the probability

2:26:31.120 --> 2:26:33.280
 that somebody will use cannabis

2:26:33.280 --> 2:26:35.960
 and then go on to use it chronically

2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:37.720
 correlates very strongly with age.

2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:40.820
 So for instance, some of the highest degree of cannabis use

2:26:40.820 --> 2:26:44.800
 is among individuals 16 to 24 years old.

2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:48.400
 In fact, in individuals who are 16 to 24 years old,

2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:50.720
 and in particular in students

2:26:50.720 --> 2:26:53.240
 and people who are working, surprising,

2:26:53.240 --> 2:26:56.160
 more than in unemployed populations,

2:26:56.160 --> 2:26:59.600
 being young, 16 to 24, at least to me that's young,

2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:03.680
 and being a student or working doubles the likelihood

2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:06.400
 that somebody is going to use cannabis on a regular basis,

2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:08.600
 twice or more per week.

2:27:08.600 --> 2:27:11.120
 The typical age of initiating cannabis use nowadays

2:27:11.120 --> 2:27:14.760
 is about 19 years old, so 18.7,

2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:18.400
 and about 20% of people in that age bracket

2:27:18.400 --> 2:27:22.000
 of 16 to 24 years old are using cannabis daily,

2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:24.860
 either by vaping, by smoking, or by edible.

2:27:24.860 --> 2:27:27.160
 That's an enormous number, at least by my read,

2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:28.360
 it's an enormous number,

2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:30.660
 and here's why it's of really serious concern.

2:27:32.040 --> 2:27:35.860
 During the ages of 16 to 24,

2:27:35.860 --> 2:27:38.780
 the cannabinoid receptors are still available.

2:27:38.780 --> 2:27:40.760
 They are not being as strongly driven

2:27:40.760 --> 2:27:42.640
 by endogenous cannabinoids,

2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:47.640
 but by ingestion of THC and or CBD,

2:27:47.900 --> 2:27:49.360
 there are downstream effects

2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:51.320
 on the signaling within those cells

2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:55.120
 that all the data point to creating

2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:58.340
 a much, much higher likelihood

2:27:58.340 --> 2:28:02.160
 of developing major depression, severe anxiety,

2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:04.640
 or psychosis at later ages.

2:28:04.640 --> 2:28:05.840
 So to be very clear,

2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:09.400
 cannabis use between the ages of 16 to 24

2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:13.200
 in both males and females is increasing anxiety,

2:28:13.200 --> 2:28:15.560
 increasing depression in the immediate years,

2:28:15.560 --> 2:28:17.440
 and within the one year's time or so,

2:28:17.440 --> 2:28:21.160
 so much so that people are using cannabis ongoing

2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:24.080
 in an attempt to reduce that anxiety

2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:25.580
 and reduce that depression.

2:28:25.580 --> 2:28:27.240
 But in addition to that,

2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:28.140
 the cannabis use,

2:28:28.140 --> 2:28:31.340
 and because of the signaling mechanisms involved,

2:28:31.340 --> 2:28:33.820
 are predisposing those individuals

2:28:33.820 --> 2:28:35.600
 to psychosis later in life.

2:28:36.580 --> 2:28:38.920
 If you look at individuals who start using cannabis

2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:43.660
 even younger, age 14, or even as young as 12,

2:28:43.660 --> 2:28:46.040
 the probability of psychosis later in life,

2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:49.680
 in particular schizophrenic or schizophrenic-like episodes,

2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:51.360
 more than doubles.

2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:54.240
 So this is a really serious concern,

2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:56.480
 and this is completely aside

2:28:56.480 --> 2:28:58.680
 from any so-called positive effects

2:28:58.680 --> 2:29:01.300
 or beneficial effects of cannabis

2:29:01.300 --> 2:29:04.000
 that people might derive from occasional use as adults,

2:29:04.000 --> 2:29:06.000
 meaning people older than 25.

2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:07.720
 So for the person who's older than 25,

2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:10.000
 who eats an edible every once in a while,

2:29:10.000 --> 2:29:12.320
 or who smokes cannabis every once in a while,

2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:14.040
 and people love to make the argument,

2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:15.780
 it's not as bad as alcohol,

2:29:15.780 --> 2:29:17.520
 which frankly is a terrible argument,

2:29:17.520 --> 2:29:19.080
 because if you saw our episode on alcohol,

2:29:19.080 --> 2:29:20.860
 alcohol is pretty bad.

2:29:20.860 --> 2:29:23.760
 But even so, it's just not a good argument.

2:29:23.760 --> 2:29:25.140
 Saying that something is good

2:29:25.140 --> 2:29:27.020
 because it's not as bad as something else

2:29:27.020 --> 2:29:29.280
 is simply just not a good or valid argument,

2:29:29.280 --> 2:29:30.980
 at least not biologically speaking.

2:29:32.520 --> 2:29:35.240
 The use of cannabis in young populations

2:29:35.240 --> 2:29:38.680
 is very strongly predisposing people to psychotic episodes.

2:29:38.680 --> 2:29:42.680
 And we know the mechanism by which this occurs.

2:29:42.680 --> 2:29:46.860
 This occurs by a thinning of the so-called gray matter.

2:29:46.860 --> 2:29:50.280
 And it's called gray matter because with neurons,

2:29:50.280 --> 2:29:52.680
 nerve cells, they have a so-called cell body.

2:29:52.680 --> 2:29:54.640
 That's the part that contains the DNA

2:29:54.640 --> 2:29:57.080
 and manufactures all the neurotransmitters, et cetera.

2:29:57.080 --> 2:30:00.080
 And those are shipped out to the other parts of the neuron

2:30:00.080 --> 2:30:02.480
 that include the axon, the wires between axons.

2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:05.080
 And those axons under the microscope

2:30:05.080 --> 2:30:07.000
 because they have a lot of fatty tissue around them,

2:30:07.000 --> 2:30:08.260
 and this is healthy fatty tissue

2:30:08.260 --> 2:30:10.320
 that allows electrical transmission to be fast.

2:30:10.320 --> 2:30:12.800
 That fatty tissue, those portions of the cells

2:30:12.800 --> 2:30:13.920
 are called white matter.

2:30:13.920 --> 2:30:15.560
 So you have gray matter and white matter.

2:30:15.560 --> 2:30:17.360
 Gray matter are the so-called cell bodies

2:30:17.360 --> 2:30:19.680
 where the DNA and all this stuff is manufactured.

2:30:19.680 --> 2:30:23.680
 White matter are the axons or the wires

2:30:23.680 --> 2:30:25.280
 through which all the key components

2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:27.740
 are shipped out to the synapse, et cetera.

2:30:29.160 --> 2:30:31.360
 Wonderful data, and I do say wonderful

2:30:31.360 --> 2:30:33.760
 because this is part of a large-scale consortium,

2:30:33.760 --> 2:30:35.080
 and we will provide a link to the paper.

2:30:35.080 --> 2:30:37.720
 This was published in Translational Psychiatry

2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:40.920
 just this year, point to the fact

2:30:40.920 --> 2:30:45.200
 that adolescent cannabis use accelerates the thinning

2:30:45.200 --> 2:30:47.900
 of the prefrontal cortex and the gray matter in particular.

2:30:47.900 --> 2:30:51.560
 So what this means is while during normal development,

2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:53.840
 the gray matter, the prefrontal cortex,

2:30:53.840 --> 2:30:56.240
 and all the cells there are indeed intended,

2:30:56.240 --> 2:30:58.440
 it's a normal process for it to thicken

2:30:58.440 --> 2:31:02.560
 and then thin a little bit as connections are adjusted

2:31:02.560 --> 2:31:04.640
 and people learn and mature and grow up.

2:31:04.640 --> 2:31:07.200
 This is part of the normal, healthy maturational process,

2:31:07.200 --> 2:31:09.800
 independent of cannabis use.

2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:13.800
 When kids, because these really are kids, use cannabis

2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:15.860
 and it doesn't matter the mode of cannabis delivery,

2:31:15.860 --> 2:31:18.360
 whether or not it's vaping or smoking or edible,

2:31:18.360 --> 2:31:21.520
 that gray matter thins at a much, much greater rate.

2:31:21.520 --> 2:31:23.200
 And the reason I like this paper published

2:31:23.200 --> 2:31:26.380
 in Translational Psychiatry this year so much

2:31:26.380 --> 2:31:29.520
 is that they link the amount of cannabis use,

2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:32.760
 heavy, moderate, light, or no cannabis use

2:31:32.760 --> 2:31:35.480
 to the rate of prefrontal cortical thinning.

2:31:35.480 --> 2:31:38.500
 And it's absolutely clear from these data

2:31:38.500 --> 2:31:41.520
 that the more often young people,

2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:44.720
 meaning individuals between the age of 14 and 25,

2:31:44.720 --> 2:31:48.800
 the more often they consume or smoke or vape cannabis,

2:31:48.800 --> 2:31:52.220
 the faster and the more extreme that cortical thinning is.

2:31:52.220 --> 2:31:53.620
 And the cortical thinning is occurring

2:31:53.620 --> 2:31:56.760
 in exactly the area of the brain that's involved in planning,

2:31:56.760 --> 2:32:00.560
 in control over one's emotions, in reflexes,

2:32:00.560 --> 2:32:04.000
 in organizing one's life in a number of different ways,

2:32:04.000 --> 2:32:06.640
 anywhere from cleaning one's room, literally,

2:32:06.640 --> 2:32:08.120
 you know, knowing what goes where,

2:32:08.120 --> 2:32:10.720
 to making plans that extend out through the day,

2:32:10.720 --> 2:32:12.140
 through the week, through a year,

2:32:12.140 --> 2:32:14.040
 essentially becoming a functional human being

2:32:14.040 --> 2:32:15.960
 involves using your prefrontal cortex

2:32:15.960 --> 2:32:17.520
 in a variety of different contexts

2:32:17.520 --> 2:32:19.320
 and different sort of time domains,

2:32:19.320 --> 2:32:21.840
 the time domain of an hour, the time domain of a day.

2:32:21.840 --> 2:32:25.000
 Making plans and being able to execute plans

2:32:25.000 --> 2:32:26.960
 is fundamental to being a healthy human being.

2:32:26.960 --> 2:32:29.080
 And it's absolutely clear from these data

2:32:29.080 --> 2:32:32.800
 that the more cannabis one uses,

2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:35.360
 the more impaired those neural circuits are.

2:32:35.360 --> 2:32:38.800
 There's simply no other way to view these data.

2:32:38.800 --> 2:32:42.420
 In fact, so much so that even small amounts of cannabis use

2:32:42.420 --> 2:32:44.560
 are associated with rates of cortical thinning

2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:46.000
 and degrees of cortical thinning

2:32:46.000 --> 2:32:48.340
 that are really detrimental and concerning

2:32:48.340 --> 2:32:51.200
 for normal cognitive processes.

2:32:51.200 --> 2:32:54.160
 If you were somebody who smoked marijuana

2:32:54.160 --> 2:32:57.160
 or consumed cannabis in any form or another

2:32:57.160 --> 2:32:59.080
 during adolescence,

2:32:59.080 --> 2:33:01.000
 does that mean that your prefrontal cortex

2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:03.760
 can never be rescued, that it can't come back?

2:33:03.760 --> 2:33:05.280
 Well, the short answer is

2:33:05.280 --> 2:33:07.380
 it probably can be rescued to some degree.

2:33:07.380 --> 2:33:10.940
 It will depend on how much cannabis you were using

2:33:10.940 --> 2:33:14.920
 and how often and what strains of cannabis, et cetera.

2:33:14.920 --> 2:33:16.640
 There's really no traveling back in time.

2:33:16.640 --> 2:33:18.120
 As my graduate advisor used to say,

2:33:18.120 --> 2:33:20.040
 you know, time machines are broken.

2:33:20.040 --> 2:33:21.480
 At least for now, we don't have time machines.

2:33:21.480 --> 2:33:24.720
 So all you can really do is try and emphasize,

2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:28.540
 first of all, quitting cannabis in any form

2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:33.560
 and focusing on behaviors that emphasize endothelial cell,

2:33:33.560 --> 2:33:35.680
 blood flow, health to the brain.

2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:38.720
 So that would be cardiovascular exercise,

2:33:38.720 --> 2:33:41.480
 adequate nutrition, not smoking nicotine.

2:33:41.480 --> 2:33:43.840
 And there are a number of other things that one can do.

2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:45.000
 We will do an entire episode

2:33:45.000 --> 2:33:48.960
 all about trying to reverse the effects of cannabis

2:33:48.960 --> 2:33:50.840
 and other drug use during adolescence.

2:33:50.840 --> 2:33:52.940
 We don't have time to do a deep dive on that right now,

2:33:52.940 --> 2:33:54.560
 but all the things that standardize

2:33:54.560 --> 2:33:58.040
 and kind of promote health, adequate sleep,

2:33:58.040 --> 2:34:01.560
 good social connection, regular cardiovascular

2:34:01.560 --> 2:34:04.640
 and weight training exercise, healthy nutrition,

2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:05.800
 what that represents to you,

2:34:05.800 --> 2:34:08.080
 healthy metabolic function and weight, et cetera.

2:34:08.080 --> 2:34:11.120
 Those are all going to facilitate some recovery

2:34:11.120 --> 2:34:14.640
 of brain function in particular prefrontal cortical function

2:34:14.640 --> 2:34:16.120
 by way of all the positive effects

2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:19.160
 that those behaviors and choices have.

2:34:19.160 --> 2:34:22.240
 But with that said, if you are in the age bracket

2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:23.280
 that I've been referring to,

2:34:23.280 --> 2:34:25.700
 this 14 to 25-year-old age bracket,

2:34:25.700 --> 2:34:30.560
 and you are a occasional even or chronic cannabis user,

2:34:30.560 --> 2:34:34.040
 you should be very, very careful and concerned

2:34:34.040 --> 2:34:36.960
 about the long-term effects that could potentially have.

2:34:36.960 --> 2:34:39.380
 That statement is bolstered by another statistic,

2:34:39.380 --> 2:34:42.820
 which is that unlike a lot of other drugs,

2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:47.600
 the rate of cannabis use is strongly related

2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:52.520
 to how dangerous people perceive cannabis to be.

2:34:52.520 --> 2:34:54.760
 And that might seem obvious on the one hand.

2:34:54.760 --> 2:34:57.240
 If you think something is very, very dangerous,

2:34:57.240 --> 2:34:58.840
 you would expect that the probability

2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:01.000
 that somebody would use it would be very, very low.

2:35:01.000 --> 2:35:02.080
 And if they think something is safe,

2:35:02.080 --> 2:35:04.500
 the probability would be high.

2:35:04.500 --> 2:35:06.600
 But that isn't necessarily the case.

2:35:06.600 --> 2:35:10.480
 If you think about it, cannabis is a unique instance

2:35:10.480 --> 2:35:12.920
 in which nowadays we are hearing,

2:35:12.920 --> 2:35:15.360
 yes, it's becoming legal in a number of areas.

2:35:15.360 --> 2:35:16.320
 And we talked earlier about

2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:19.280
 why that's probably a good thing in most circumstances,

2:35:19.280 --> 2:35:22.360
 but that we aren't just hearing that cannabis is safe,

2:35:22.360 --> 2:35:25.960
 or it's not just being implied that cannabis is safer,

2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:28.080
 but many more people are talking

2:35:28.080 --> 2:35:30.820
 about the positive effects of cannabis

2:35:30.820 --> 2:35:32.360
 without a lot of discussion

2:35:32.360 --> 2:35:34.320
 about the negative effects of cannabis.

2:35:34.320 --> 2:35:35.840
 And I realize that saying this

2:35:35.840 --> 2:35:37.360
 is going to upset some people out there

2:35:37.360 --> 2:35:38.760
 because I know that there are a number of people

2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:41.080
 who fought very hard for the legalization process,

2:35:41.080 --> 2:35:42.880
 and I want to acknowledge that.

2:35:42.880 --> 2:35:44.100
 I also want to acknowledge

2:35:44.100 --> 2:35:49.100
 the many known positive effects of cannabis in adults

2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:52.520
 with very occasional use,

2:35:52.520 --> 2:35:55.280
 provided it is delivered safely

2:35:55.280 --> 2:35:59.520
 and in the safe context and setting and with legality.

2:35:59.520 --> 2:36:02.000
 That is entirely distinct from the issue

2:36:02.000 --> 2:36:03.440
 of whether or not cannabis is safe

2:36:03.440 --> 2:36:05.680
 for the developing brain and body.

2:36:05.680 --> 2:36:09.860
 Again, I'm not demonizing anybody for using cannabis,

2:36:09.860 --> 2:36:12.760
 but I want to make the point very simply and very directly.

2:36:12.760 --> 2:36:17.200
 It is far and away a different circumstance for the brain

2:36:18.200 --> 2:36:21.920
 for an individual to be 25 years or older

2:36:21.920 --> 2:36:25.960
 and using cannabis in whatever form occasionally,

2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:27.720
 or maybe even frequently,

2:36:27.720 --> 2:36:32.720
 than it is for a young person aged 14 to 25

2:36:33.040 --> 2:36:36.620
 to be using cannabis either by smoking or vaping

2:36:36.620 --> 2:36:41.240
 or by edible or any other form on the brain and body.

2:36:41.240 --> 2:36:44.240
 It's absolutely clear that the brain continues to develop

2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:46.200
 at least until age 25,

2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:47.980
 and that a huge number of systems

2:36:47.980 --> 2:36:51.280
 related to mood regulation, so-called executive function,

2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:53.040
 the ability to organize one's thoughts,

2:36:53.040 --> 2:36:55.500
 plan and execute plans,

2:36:55.500 --> 2:36:58.040
 essentially to become a functional human being, right?

2:36:58.040 --> 2:37:00.480
 That's one portion of becoming a functional human being,

2:37:00.480 --> 2:37:02.620
 but certainly is an essential one.

2:37:02.620 --> 2:37:05.000
 All of that relies on the fine tuning

2:37:05.000 --> 2:37:06.800
 of this neural circuitry

2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:09.680
 that we've been talking about up until now.

2:37:09.680 --> 2:37:12.720
 And it's abundantly clear

2:37:12.720 --> 2:37:15.880
 that cannabis and THC in particular

2:37:15.880 --> 2:37:19.320
 dramatically disrupt those processes.

2:37:20.200 --> 2:37:23.940
 So if this isn't clear enough just from my statements,

2:37:23.940 --> 2:37:26.000
 I'd like to point to a particular paper.

2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:27.620
 This is one of the more impactful papers

2:37:27.620 --> 2:37:29.640
 in this area in recent years.

2:37:29.640 --> 2:37:33.680
 This is a paper published in Lancet Psychiatry in 2022.

2:37:33.680 --> 2:37:36.720
 Title is Association of Cannabis Potency

2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:40.300
 with Mental Ill Health and Addiction, a Systematic Review.

2:37:40.300 --> 2:37:41.960
 There are a number of very important points

2:37:41.960 --> 2:37:43.780
 in this very fine paper.

2:37:43.780 --> 2:37:46.240
 Lancet Psychiatry is one of the premier

2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:47.640
 medical journals out there,

2:37:48.480 --> 2:37:51.400
 and they evaluated a huge number of studies.

2:37:51.400 --> 2:37:54.420
 They actually looked at more than 4,000 studies.

2:37:54.420 --> 2:37:57.560
 They selected the ones that were only the most rigorous

2:37:57.560 --> 2:38:00.440
 in terms of study design and analysis

2:38:00.440 --> 2:38:02.640
 and rigor of conclusions.

2:38:02.640 --> 2:38:06.400
 And they looked at how early use of cannabis

2:38:06.400 --> 2:38:10.840
 impacted later probability of development of psychosis

2:38:10.840 --> 2:38:12.960
 and other psychiatric conditions.

2:38:12.960 --> 2:38:16.600
 And the takeaways from this study are very clear.

2:38:16.600 --> 2:38:19.820
 First of all, chronic cannabis use,

2:38:19.820 --> 2:38:21.320
 so more than twice per week,

2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:22.960
 has consistently been associated

2:38:22.960 --> 2:38:24.320
 with mental health disorders.

2:38:24.320 --> 2:38:26.920
 I'm pulling some phrases directly from the paper.

2:38:26.920 --> 2:38:29.080
 Heavy cannabis use,

2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:32.600
 meaning cannabis use more frequent than twice per week,

2:38:32.600 --> 2:38:35.740
 has been associated with four times the risk

2:38:35.740 --> 2:38:37.180
 of psychosis later in life.

2:38:37.180 --> 2:38:40.700
 In particular, schizophrenia and bipolar-like episodes.

2:38:40.700 --> 2:38:43.020
 Now we've done an episode on bipolar disorder,

2:38:43.020 --> 2:38:44.660
 so-called bipolar depression.

2:38:44.660 --> 2:38:46.220
 We have not yet done one on schizophrenia,

2:38:46.220 --> 2:38:48.780
 but both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia

2:38:48.780 --> 2:38:51.860
 have a very, very strong genetic component.

2:38:51.860 --> 2:38:55.340
 There's a 30, three zero, 30 times greater likelihood

2:38:55.340 --> 2:38:56.560
 that you'll have bipolar disorder

2:38:56.560 --> 2:38:59.420
 if you have a first relative who has bipolar disorder.

2:38:59.420 --> 2:39:01.800
 And then it's also the case

2:39:01.800 --> 2:39:04.300
 that using cannabis, especially during adolescence

2:39:04.300 --> 2:39:07.440
 and the teen years and up until age 25,

2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:10.760
 create a four times greater risk of psychosis

2:39:10.760 --> 2:39:12.540
 for those that have a predisposition

2:39:12.540 --> 2:39:15.860
 to bipolar disorder and or schizophrenia.

2:39:15.860 --> 2:39:18.660
 Now, I don't hear very much about this in the media.

2:39:18.660 --> 2:39:20.060
 This paper got some attention

2:39:20.060 --> 2:39:22.780
 and then it sort of got swept away.

2:39:22.780 --> 2:39:24.460
 I don't think that was an intentional sweeping way.

2:39:24.460 --> 2:39:25.900
 There's just a lot of events in the world,

2:39:25.900 --> 2:39:27.780
 as you well know.

2:39:27.780 --> 2:39:31.160
 But I think it's a particularly important set of findings

2:39:31.160 --> 2:39:34.940
 because obviously in looking at so many studies,

2:39:34.940 --> 2:39:37.300
 it distills out the strongest findings that are out there

2:39:37.300 --> 2:39:40.580
 and really pulls the consistent messages

2:39:40.580 --> 2:39:42.700
 that are arriving from all these different studies.

2:39:42.700 --> 2:39:45.980
 And as they point out, and again, I'm paraphrasing here,

2:39:45.980 --> 2:39:47.580
 this is the first systematic review

2:39:47.580 --> 2:39:50.820
 of the Association of Cannabis Potency.

2:39:50.820 --> 2:39:53.300
 And all of the data point to a very clear conclusion,

2:39:53.300 --> 2:39:58.300
 which is the more potent the THC concentration,

2:39:58.460 --> 2:40:00.660
 the higher probability of developing psychosis

2:40:00.660 --> 2:40:02.180
 or a major depressive episode

2:40:02.180 --> 2:40:04.620
 or a major anxiety disorder later in life.

2:40:04.620 --> 2:40:06.960
 That should be of particular concern

2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:10.600
 because we know we are absolutely clear

2:40:10.600 --> 2:40:12.420
 about the fact that with the advent

2:40:12.420 --> 2:40:14.860
 of all these new strains of cannabis

2:40:14.860 --> 2:40:19.520
 and with the engineering and availability of cannabis

2:40:19.520 --> 2:40:24.060
 at much higher potency, meaning THC potency,

2:40:24.060 --> 2:40:26.960
 the risk of psychosis is going up and up

2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:28.520
 and is likely to continue going up

2:40:28.520 --> 2:40:31.100
 unless something is done to reduce

2:40:31.100 --> 2:40:36.100
 the frequency of cannabis use to zero ideally

2:40:36.100 --> 2:40:39.180
 or to very low frequency, very low potency

2:40:39.180 --> 2:40:43.620
 in adolescents and teens and people aged 25 or younger.

2:40:43.620 --> 2:40:45.880
 I know a lot of people don't want to hear this message

2:40:45.880 --> 2:40:47.200
 because first of all, it's alarming.

2:40:47.200 --> 2:40:49.800
 And second of all, as I mentioned earlier,

2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:53.140
 the statistics tell us that the greatest number of people

2:40:53.140 --> 2:40:54.500
 that are starting to use cannabis

2:40:54.500 --> 2:40:57.240
 are in the age bracket of 16 to 24.

2:40:57.240 --> 2:41:00.360
 Many of them are functional in other areas of life.

2:41:00.360 --> 2:41:03.720
 They are students, they are employed, et cetera.

2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:05.840
 But when you couple that with the fact

2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:08.560
 that the most frequent adopters of cannabis use

2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:11.280
 are in this age bracket of 16 to 24,

2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:14.640
 they're twice as likely to use as other individuals

2:41:14.640 --> 2:41:17.480
 or to start using cannabis as our other individuals.

2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:19.520
 Plus the general perception out there

2:41:19.520 --> 2:41:22.600
 because of the way that cannabis is discussed in the media

2:41:22.600 --> 2:41:24.760
 and by sports figures and by celebrities

2:41:24.760 --> 2:41:27.240
 and by politicians, et cetera,

2:41:27.240 --> 2:41:30.920
 that it's not as bad as alcohol and maybe not that bad

2:41:30.920 --> 2:41:33.580
 and maybe even has health benefits,

2:41:33.580 --> 2:41:35.000
 then you're essentially setting up a system

2:41:35.000 --> 2:41:37.040
 where young people are far more likely

2:41:37.040 --> 2:41:39.680
 to adopt and continue cannabis use

2:41:39.680 --> 2:41:42.640
 without realizing these serious health consequences

2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:43.760
 that await them later.

2:41:45.280 --> 2:41:48.120
 With all of that said, I of course, again,

2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:51.480
 want to acknowledge that there have been

2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:56.480
 well-demonstrated effects of cannabis for reducing pain,

2:41:56.920 --> 2:41:58.920
 in particular in chemotherapy

2:41:58.920 --> 2:42:02.240
 and in the context of reducing nausea

2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:04.800
 in people suffering from cancer or chemotherapy.

2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:07.440
 There is a well-known effect

2:42:07.440 --> 2:42:09.960
 that one can generally point to as positive

2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:13.400
 using cannabis for things like glaucoma,

2:42:13.400 --> 2:42:15.680
 for lowering intraocular pressure

2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:17.200
 and offsetting the loss of neurons

2:42:17.200 --> 2:42:18.220
 that would lead to blindness.

2:42:18.220 --> 2:42:19.640
 Although there are other tools, of course,

2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:21.240
 that don't involve cannabis use

2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:23.560
 that can accomplish that as well,

2:42:23.560 --> 2:42:28.440
 so-called intraocular pressure-lowering drugs or drops.

2:42:28.440 --> 2:42:33.120
 There is a list of probably a dozen or more

2:42:33.120 --> 2:42:35.900
 psychological and bodily ailments

2:42:35.900 --> 2:42:37.760
 that can be aided by cannabis use,

2:42:37.760 --> 2:42:41.220
 in particular edible cannabis use of particular strains.

2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:45.760
 Of course, I'm going to address each and every one of those

2:42:45.760 --> 2:42:48.200
 in episodes where I'm talking, for instance,

2:42:48.200 --> 2:42:51.040
 about eye disease or about chronic pain.

2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:52.840
 I am in no way, shape, or form

2:42:52.840 --> 2:42:56.540
 trying to rob the incredible efforts of the laboratories

2:42:56.540 --> 2:42:58.660
 and people that have worked very hard

2:42:58.660 --> 2:43:02.680
 to study and establish the valid uses of cannabis

2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:04.320
 for treating various ailments

2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:06.280
 and that continue to study cannabis

2:43:06.280 --> 2:43:08.360
 in order to try and ameliorate

2:43:08.360 --> 2:43:10.880
 the symptoms of different ailments.

2:43:10.880 --> 2:43:12.780
 But today I really wanted to emphasize

2:43:12.780 --> 2:43:14.960
 the biology of cannabis.

2:43:14.960 --> 2:43:18.160
 Some of the often discussed effects,

2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:19.660
 I guess one could call them positive effects,

2:43:19.660 --> 2:43:20.940
 things like enhanced creativity

2:43:20.940 --> 2:43:22.200
 and really point to the nuance

2:43:22.200 --> 2:43:26.640
 and actually the divergence of people who take cannabis

2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:28.520
 and some experience heightened levels of creativity

2:43:28.520 --> 2:43:29.520
 and some do not.

2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:33.500
 Some people experience heightened levels of sexual arousal

2:43:33.500 --> 2:43:36.360
 and some people experience the exact opposite

2:43:36.360 --> 2:43:37.840
 and so on and so forth,

2:43:37.840 --> 2:43:40.640
 rather than focus on all the potential positive

2:43:40.640 --> 2:43:44.040
 and sort of emerging positive data about cannabis

2:43:44.040 --> 2:43:45.740
 in different medical contexts.

2:43:45.740 --> 2:43:46.580
 And at the same time,

2:43:46.580 --> 2:43:48.480
 I strongly feel that it's important

2:43:48.480 --> 2:43:51.820
 to acknowledge the shocking,

2:43:51.820 --> 2:43:54.300
 because there's really no other way to describe it,

2:43:54.300 --> 2:43:57.760
 the shocking effects of cannabis use

2:43:57.760 --> 2:43:58.840
 on the developing fetus

2:43:58.840 --> 2:44:01.040
 and the fact that so many pregnant

2:44:01.040 --> 2:44:03.220
 and lactating mothers are using cannabis.

2:44:03.220 --> 2:44:06.440
 I mean, that number 15% still has me dizzy

2:44:06.440 --> 2:44:07.500
 with kind of disbelief

2:44:07.500 --> 2:44:08.800
 and yet we need to acknowledge this

2:44:08.800 --> 2:44:11.340
 and address this immediately.

2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:13.700
 And I think it's vital to understand

2:44:13.700 --> 2:44:18.700
 that cannabis use through any delivery mechanism,

2:44:18.980 --> 2:44:21.200
 smoking or vaping or edible or otherwise

2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:24.700
 is very, very concerning.

2:44:24.700 --> 2:44:26.840
 In fact, dangerous to the developing brain,

2:44:26.840 --> 2:44:29.580
 certainly for the fetal brain and for the baby brain,

2:44:30.460 --> 2:44:32.600
 but also for the adolescent brain

2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:35.580
 and for the teen and young adult brain,

2:44:35.580 --> 2:44:37.440
 not just because of the effects that it can have

2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:38.280
 in the immediate term,

2:44:38.280 --> 2:44:41.440
 those slow creeping increases in anxiety and depression

2:44:41.440 --> 2:44:43.740
 brought on by cannabis use,

2:44:43.740 --> 2:44:47.900
 but also the time release, if you will,

2:44:47.900 --> 2:44:49.900
 on the development of psychosis

2:44:49.900 --> 2:44:52.600
 and other types of major psychiatric disorders

2:44:52.600 --> 2:44:54.240
 later in life.

2:44:54.240 --> 2:44:56.420
 I acknowledge we've covered a lot of ground today

2:44:56.420 --> 2:44:58.180
 and yet there's still far more ground

2:44:58.180 --> 2:44:59.120
 that we could have covered

2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:02.800
 and that we will indeed cover in future episodes.

2:45:02.800 --> 2:45:05.420
 Nevertheless, if you are learning from

2:45:05.420 --> 2:45:06.920

 That's the best way to support this podcast.

2:45:32.580 --> 2:45:33.500
 As mentioned earlier,

2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:35.820
 the Huberman Lab podcast now has a premium channel.

2:45:35.820 --> 2:45:37.000
 You can subscribe to that

2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:39.580

2:45:50.740 --> 2:45:53.140
 for mental, physical health and performance.

2:45:53.140 --> 2:45:56.140
 Again, that's HubermanLab.com slash premium.

2:45:56.140 --> 2:45:56.980
 Not so much today,

2:45:56.980 --> 2:45:59.420
 but in many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,

2:45:59.420 --> 2:46:00.700
 we talk about supplements.

2:46:00.700 --> 2:46:02.900
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:46:02.900 --> 2:46:04.900
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:46:04.900 --> 2:46:06.900
 for things like enhancing sleep and focus

2:46:06.900 --> 2:46:08.580
 and hormone optimization.

2:46:08.580 --> 2:46:09.620
 The Huberman Lab podcast

2:46:09.620 --> 2:46:11.220
 has partnered with Momentous Supplements.

2:46:11.220 --> 2:46:12.300
 If you'd like to see the supplements

2:46:12.300 --> 2:46:13.360
 that the Huberman Lab podcast

2:46:13.360 --> 2:46:14.820
 has partnered with Momentous on,

2:46:14.820 --> 2:46:17.220
 you can go to Live Momentous spelled O-U-S,

2:46:17.220 --> 2:46:19.700
 so LiveMomentous.com slash Huberman.

2:46:19.700 --> 2:46:21.660
 And there you'll see a number of the supplements

2:46:21.660 --> 2:46:23.620
 that we talk about regularly on the podcast.

2:46:23.620 --> 2:46:25.560
 I should just mention that that catalog of supplements

2:46:25.560 --> 2:46:27.040
 is constantly being updated.

2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:27.980
 If you haven't already signed up

2:46:27.980 --> 2:46:29.180
 for the Neural Network newsletter,

2:46:29.180 --> 2:46:31.940
 this is a monthly Huberman Lab podcast newsletter

2:46:31.940 --> 2:46:35.000
 in which you get some brief show notes summaries

2:46:35.000 --> 2:46:37.940
 as well as a lot of actionable tools in summary form.

2:46:37.940 --> 2:46:39.600
 Many people find these very useful

2:46:39.600 --> 2:46:42.140
 for distilling out the vast amount of information

2:46:42.140 --> 2:46:43.540
 that we cover on the podcast.

2:46:43.540 --> 2:46:45.860
 So for instance, if you go to HubermanLab.com,

2:46:45.860 --> 2:46:47.620
 you can click on the menu,

2:46:47.620 --> 2:46:51.020
 click to Neural Network newsletter or simply newsletter,

2:46:51.020 --> 2:46:52.980
 and you can sign up, just give us your email.

2:46:52.980 --> 2:46:54.860
 We do not share your email with anybody.

2:46:54.860 --> 2:46:57.160
 And again, it's completely zero cost.

2:46:57.160 --> 2:46:59.300
 We also have examples of previous newsletters

2:46:59.300 --> 2:47:00.460
 that you can download immediately

2:47:00.460 --> 2:47:01.820
 without having to sign up for anything

2:47:01.820 --> 2:47:03.500
 and decide whether or not you want to sign up.

2:47:03.500 --> 2:47:05.060
 Again, that's the Neural Network newsletter

2:47:05.060 --> 2:47:06.820
 at HubermanLab.com.

2:47:06.820 --> 2:47:08.900
 If you're not already following us on social media,

2:47:08.900 --> 2:47:11.340
 we are Huberman Lab on Instagram, on Twitter,

2:47:11.340 --> 2:47:13.100
 on Facebook, and on LinkedIn.

2:47:13.100 --> 2:47:16.020
 And especially on Instagram and on Twitter,

2:47:16.020 --> 2:47:18.300
 I cover many of the tools that are discussed

2:47:18.300 --> 2:47:19.340
 on the Huberman Lab podcast,

2:47:19.340 --> 2:47:21.180
 but also a lot of science and science-based tools

2:47:21.180 --> 2:47:23.340
 not covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.

2:47:23.340 --> 2:47:25.620
 Again, it's Huberman Lab on all platforms.

2:47:25.620 --> 2:47:27.080
 So once again, thank you for joining me

2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:29.860
 for today's discussion all about cannabis.

2:47:29.860 --> 2:47:33.020
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

2:47:33.020 --> 2:47:38.020
 I'll see you next time.
