00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.640
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.640 --> 00:13.740
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.740 --> 00:15.760
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.540
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.540 --> 00:19.400
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.400 --> 00:21.320
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.320 --> 00:23.500
 to bring you zero cost to consumer information

00:23.500 --> 00:26.520
 about science and science-related tools.

00:26.520 --> 00:27.360
 Along those lines,

00:27.360 --> 00:30.340
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:30.340 --> 00:32.660
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

00:32.660 --> 00:34.360
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

00:34.360 --> 00:37.280
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

00:37.280 --> 00:39.900
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

00:39.900 --> 00:43.120
 and so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of the podcast.

00:43.120 --> 00:44.960
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

00:44.960 --> 00:46.620
 is because I found it rather dizzying

00:46.620 --> 00:48.880
 to know which vitamins and minerals to take,

00:48.880 --> 00:50.960
 and Athletic Greens covers all my bases

00:50.960 --> 00:52.440
 for vitamins and minerals.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.160
 It also includes probiotics,

00:54.160 --> 00:57.000
 and there are now a lot of data supporting the fact

00:57.000 --> 01:00.500
 that probiotics are important for the gut brain access,

01:00.500 --> 01:03.320
 for immunity, for metabolic health, endocrine health,

01:03.320 --> 01:04.760
 many, many things.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.640
 So I take Athletic Greens once, sometimes twice a day.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.200
 I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon juice,

01:10.200 --> 01:12.300
 and to me, it tastes delicious.

01:12.300 --> 01:13.840
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

01:13.840 --> 01:17.000
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

01:17.000 --> 01:18.160
 and if you do that,

01:18.160 --> 01:21.900
 they'll also give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

01:21.900 --> 01:23.280
 There are a lot of data now showing

01:23.280 --> 01:25.800
 that vitamin D3 is important for immune function

01:25.800 --> 01:28.840
 and a number of other important biological processes.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.920
 In addition, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

01:32.920 --> 01:35.000
 you'll get five free travel packs.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.660
 Travel packs make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens

01:37.660 --> 01:39.720
 when you're in the car, on the plane,

01:39.720 --> 01:41.240
 or generally on the road.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.400
 So that's athleticgreens.com to get Athletic Greens,

01:44.400 --> 01:46.720
 the year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2,

01:46.720 --> 01:48.920
 and the five free travel packs.

01:48.920 --> 01:52.000
 Our second sponsor of today's podcast is Headspace.

01:52.000 --> 01:55.540
 Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.

01:55.540 --> 01:58.380
 I've been meditating on and off since I was 16 years old.

01:58.380 --> 02:01.000
 I'm 45 now, so that's about 30 years

02:01.000 --> 02:02.680
 of on and off meditation,

02:02.680 --> 02:05.740
 and I confess most of that time, it was off,

02:05.740 --> 02:07.140
 meaning I find it really hard

02:07.140 --> 02:09.420
 to stick to a meditation practice.

02:09.420 --> 02:11.100
 A few years ago, I discovered Headspace

02:11.100 --> 02:12.400
 while flying on JetBlue flights,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.820
 because at that time, they were offering Headspace

02:14.820 --> 02:17.560
 as something you could watch instead of TV or movies,

02:17.560 --> 02:19.100
 and it made me feel great.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.360
 I'd find that I arrived where I was going,

02:21.360 --> 02:24.680
 more rested, more relaxed, and I got the Headspace app,

02:24.680 --> 02:26.240
 and I started using it daily,

02:26.240 --> 02:28.200
 and I've continued to use it daily.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.220
 Headspace has a large number of meditations,

02:31.220 --> 02:33.100
 all supported by science.

02:33.100 --> 02:35.380
 There's also now just a tremendous amount of science

02:35.380 --> 02:38.720
 supporting a meditation practice for all sorts of things,

02:38.720 --> 02:42.040
 like improved sleep, reduced impulsivity,

02:42.040 --> 02:43.600
 improved cognition.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.360
 They're just a myriad of positive effects of meditation.

02:46.360 --> 02:49.400
 The hardest thing is doing it, and Headspace makes that easy.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.100
 If you want to try the Headspace app

02:51.100 --> 02:53.080
 and all the meditations they have,

02:53.080 --> 02:56.120
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer,

02:56.120 --> 02:58.280
 and you'll get one month completely free

02:58.280 --> 02:59.960
 of all the meditations they have.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.840
 That's headspace.com slash special offer

03:02.840 --> 03:05.160
 to get one month free of Headspace.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.940
 The third sponsor of today's podcast is Magic Spoon.

03:07.940 --> 03:12.240
 Magic Spoon is a low carb, grain-free, keto-friendly cereal.

03:12.240 --> 03:14.840
 As I've mentioned a few times before on this podcast,

03:14.840 --> 03:16.760
 the way I eat throughout the day has everything to do

03:16.760 --> 03:19.380
 with when I want to be alert and when I want to be sleepy.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.600
 So in the first part of the day, I fast,

03:21.600 --> 03:24.260
 because that enhances alertness.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.440
 Then I eat keto.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.520
 So my lunch and my afternoon meals are ketogenic.

03:28.520 --> 03:31.080
 And then in the evening, I eat starches and vegetables

03:31.080 --> 03:33.320
 because those aid the transition to sleep.

03:33.320 --> 03:36.980
 So for me, Magic Spoon as a keto cereal is a great snack.

03:36.980 --> 03:38.140
 It's really tasty.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.840
 I don't actually mix mine with milk.

03:39.840 --> 03:40.960
 I just eat it directly.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.760
 They have a bunch of different flavors.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.200
 I like the frosted flavor,

03:44.200 --> 03:45.800
 also because it tastes like donuts,

03:45.800 --> 03:49.120
 and I have a pastry affliction, and I love pastries.

03:49.120 --> 03:52.720
 So Magic Spoon allows me to remain on keto during the day.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.280
 It's healthy. It tastes great.

03:54.280 --> 03:55.540
 I really enjoy it.

03:55.540 --> 03:56.880
 So if you want to try Magic Spoon,

03:56.880 --> 03:59.500
 you can go to magicspoon.com slash Huberman

03:59.500 --> 04:01.640
 for a variety pack of different flavors.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.540
 And if you put Huberman at checkout,

04:03.540 --> 04:05.840
 you'll get $5 off the variety pack.

04:05.840 --> 04:08.280
 That's magicspoon.com slash Huberman

04:08.280 --> 04:09.960
 to try a variety pack of different flavors

04:09.960 --> 04:12.940
 of Magic Spoon keto, grain-free, low carb cereal.

04:12.940 --> 04:15.520
 Put Huberman at checkout, you get $5 off.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.480
 A quick note before we begin today's discussion

04:18.480 --> 04:21.320
 about the neuroscience of motivation.

04:21.320 --> 04:24.400
 I'm pleased to announce that we have now captioned

04:24.400 --> 04:27.360
 episodes one and two in Spanish,

04:27.360 --> 04:30.380
 and soon all the episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast

04:30.380 --> 04:33.400
 will be captioned on YouTube in Spanish.

04:33.400 --> 04:35.520
 We've used some of the revenue from the podcast

04:35.520 --> 04:38.960
 to hire expert captioners, so it should be accurate.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.920
 You might catch a mistake here or there,

04:40.920 --> 04:43.800
 or a dialect difference from time to time,

04:43.800 --> 04:47.660
 but by our read and by our experts' reads,

04:47.660 --> 04:48.900
 it's all accurate.

04:48.900 --> 04:52.200
 So we're very pleased that people who speak Spanish

04:52.200 --> 04:54.720
 and digest information best in Spanish

04:54.720 --> 04:57.620
 can now digest the information here on the podcast.

04:57.620 --> 04:59.600
 Thanks to everyone for supporting the podcast,

04:59.600 --> 05:02.280
 which allows us to broaden our reach in these ways.

05:02.280 --> 05:05.280
 And we do hope to expand to other languages

05:05.280 --> 05:06.760
 in the very near future.

05:06.760 --> 05:08.240
 This month, we're talking all about

05:08.240 --> 05:10.080
 the neuroscience of emotions.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.520
 And today we're going to talk about

05:11.520 --> 05:13.360
 an extremely important topic

05:13.360 --> 05:17.160
 that's central to our daily life, and that's motivation.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.760
 We're going to talk about pleasure and reward.

05:19.760 --> 05:22.880
 What underlies our sense of pleasure or reward?

05:22.880 --> 05:24.800
 We're going to talk about addictions.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.160
 You can't have a discussion about pleasure and reward

05:27.160 --> 05:29.520
 without having a discussion about addictions

05:29.520 --> 05:32.020
 and the addictive properties of certain substances,

05:32.020 --> 05:34.880
 as well as how to break free of addiction.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.480
 As well, we're going to talk about the neurochemistry

05:38.480 --> 05:40.720
 of drive and mindset.

05:40.720 --> 05:42.560
 So all these themes are woven together

05:42.560 --> 05:44.360
 in the context of emotions.

05:44.360 --> 05:45.280
 Each one of them, of course,

05:45.280 --> 05:47.960
 could also be its own entire month of the podcast.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.360
 And in fact, we are going to have

05:49.360 --> 05:52.360
 an entire month devoted to addiction.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.600
 And I have a very special guest

05:53.600 --> 05:55.560
 that's going to be joining us to talk about

05:55.560 --> 05:57.960
 the science and clinical practices

05:57.960 --> 06:00.640
 that we know are important for understanding

06:00.640 --> 06:02.320
 and treating addiction.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.080
 But for now, let's just talk about

06:04.080 --> 06:06.720
 the neuroscience of motivation and reward,

06:06.720 --> 06:08.320
 of pleasure and pain,

06:08.320 --> 06:11.340
 because those are central to what we think of as emotions,

06:11.340 --> 06:12.440
 whether or not we feel good,

06:12.440 --> 06:14.280
 whether or not we feel we're on track in life,

06:14.280 --> 06:16.720
 whether or not we feel we're falling behind.

06:16.720 --> 06:20.720
 So motivation is fundamental to our daily life.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.960
 It's what allows us to get out of bed in the morning.

06:22.960 --> 06:25.320
 It's what allows us to pursue long-term goals

06:25.320 --> 06:26.880
 or short-term goals.

06:26.880 --> 06:30.360
 Motivation and the chemistry of motivation

06:30.360 --> 06:35.360
 is tightly wound in with the neurochemistry of movement.

06:35.480 --> 06:39.080
 In fact, the same single molecule, dopamine,

06:39.080 --> 06:42.260
 is responsible for our sense of motivation

06:42.260 --> 06:44.600
 and for movement.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.600
 Even though nerves controlling muscles,

06:47.600 --> 06:49.760
 so again, these are nerves in the spinal cord or brain

06:49.760 --> 06:51.620
 that move our limbs,

06:51.620 --> 06:53.480
 the effector chemical there,

06:53.480 --> 06:55.720
 the one that actually causes the muscles to twitch,

06:55.720 --> 06:58.080
 to contract, is acetylcholine.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.680
 In the brain, acetylcholine is responsible for focus.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.060
 However, whether or not we move,

07:03.060 --> 07:04.800
 whether or not we want to move,

07:04.800 --> 07:09.400
 whether or not we have the desire to overcome barriers of,

07:09.400 --> 07:11.120
 you know, they could be social barriers

07:11.120 --> 07:13.600
 or financial barriers or time constraints,

07:13.600 --> 07:16.060
 that depends on this molecule we call dopamine.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.880
 It's a fascinating molecule,

07:17.880 --> 07:22.200
 and it lies at the center of so many great things in life,

07:22.200 --> 07:25.000
 and it lies at the center of so many terrible aspects

07:25.000 --> 07:27.020
 of life, namely addiction and certain forms

07:27.020 --> 07:28.640
 of mental disease.

07:28.640 --> 07:31.760
 So if ever there was a double-edged blade

07:31.760 --> 07:34.400
 in the world of neuroscience, it's dopamine.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.420
 So let's talk about what dopamine is,

07:36.420 --> 07:39.400
 and as always, we are going to talk about actionable tools.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.640
 Today, we're definitely going to talk about some things

07:41.640 --> 07:43.040
 related to supplementation,

07:43.040 --> 07:45.000
 although you might be surprised to learn

07:45.000 --> 07:47.520
 that it's not all just about increasing dopamine,

07:47.520 --> 07:49.460
 and in particular, in some cases,

07:49.460 --> 07:51.220
 that's the wrong thing to do.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.060
 Sometimes it's appropriate, sometimes it's not.

07:54.060 --> 07:56.920
 More so, we're going to talk about tools

07:56.920 --> 07:59.560
 related to what's called dopamine scheduling,

07:59.560 --> 08:01.320
 how the way that you're leading your life

08:01.320 --> 08:03.560
 and the way that you're conceptualizing your goals

08:03.560 --> 08:05.640
 can actually predict whether or not

08:05.640 --> 08:08.240
 you're going to continue to pursue those goals,

08:08.240 --> 08:09.900
 and therefore, whether or not you will succeed

08:09.900 --> 08:11.460
 in achieving those goals,

08:11.460 --> 08:14.100
 as well as whether or not you will quit.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.000
 There's a fundamental relationship

08:16.000 --> 08:18.320
 between dopamine released in your brain

08:18.320 --> 08:20.600
 and your desire to exert effort,

08:20.600 --> 08:23.200
 and you can actually control the schedule

08:23.200 --> 08:24.140
 of dopamine release,

08:24.140 --> 08:26.600
 but it requires the appropriate knowledge.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.040
 This is one of those cases where understanding

08:29.040 --> 08:30.440
 the way the dopamine system works

08:30.440 --> 08:32.640
 will allow you to leverage it to your benefit,

08:32.640 --> 08:35.400
 and if you don't understand the way that dopamine works,

08:35.400 --> 08:38.600
 there's a good chance that it's going to pull you out

08:38.600 --> 08:39.840
 into the current of life,

08:39.840 --> 08:41.640
 meaning the rest of the world

08:41.640 --> 08:43.840
 is going to control your dopamine schedules.

08:43.840 --> 08:45.880
 So I'm excited to tell you about today's information.

08:45.880 --> 08:47.080
 You're going to learn some basic science.

08:47.080 --> 08:48.480
 You're going to learn a lot of tools,

08:48.480 --> 08:50.240
 and these tools, I believe, are applicable

08:50.240 --> 08:52.760
 whether or not you're five years old, eight years old,

08:52.760 --> 08:55.140
 80 years old, or anything in between.

08:55.140 --> 08:56.800
 So let's talk about dopamine.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.400
 Let's get a few basic facts on the table.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.300
 Dopamine was discovered in the late 1950s,

09:03.300 --> 09:06.040
 and it was discovered as the precursor,

09:06.040 --> 09:08.920
 meaning the thing from which epinephrine

09:08.920 --> 09:10.800
 or adrenaline is made.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.000
 Now, that's fundamentally important

09:13.000 --> 09:15.840
 because this molecule we call dopamine nowadays

09:15.840 --> 09:19.640
 we think of as the molecule of reward and pleasure,

09:19.640 --> 09:22.020
 but actually it is the substrate

09:22.020 --> 09:24.280
 from which adrenaline is made,

09:24.280 --> 09:25.360
 and in the brain,

09:25.360 --> 09:28.060
 it's the substrate from which epinephrine is made.

09:28.060 --> 09:30.280
 Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline,

09:30.280 --> 09:32.800
 except in the brain we call it epinephrine.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.520
 Epinephrine, as you may recall from previous podcasts,

09:35.520 --> 09:36.880
 or if you haven't, no problem,

09:36.880 --> 09:41.000
 epinephrine allows us to get into action.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.280
 It stimulates changes in the blood vessels,

09:43.280 --> 09:45.560
 in the heart, in the organs and tissues of the body

09:45.560 --> 09:47.880
 that bias us for movement,

09:47.880 --> 09:50.140
 and if you'd like to learn more about epinephrine,

09:50.140 --> 09:53.760
 you can check out our episode on mastering stress.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.600
 We talk a lot about it there.

09:55.600 --> 09:57.240
 Dopamine was initially thought to be

09:57.240 --> 09:59.280
 just the building block for epinephrine,

09:59.280 --> 10:01.440
 and it is indeed the chemical building block

10:01.440 --> 10:03.640
 from which epinephrine is made.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.200
 However, dopamine does a lot of things on its own.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.200
 It's not always converted to epinephrine.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.280
 Dopamine is released from several sites

10:11.280 --> 10:12.700
 in the brain and body,

10:12.700 --> 10:15.120
 but perhaps the most important one for today's discussion

10:15.120 --> 10:17.040
 about motivation and reward

10:17.040 --> 10:20.320
 is something that's sometimes just called the reward pathway

10:20.320 --> 10:21.400
 for the aficionados,

10:21.400 --> 10:24.720
 it's sometimes called the mesolimbic reward pathway,

10:24.720 --> 10:26.560
 but it's fundamentally important

10:26.560 --> 10:29.960
 to your desire to engage in action,

10:29.960 --> 10:32.280
 and it's fundamentally important

10:32.280 --> 10:36.520
 for people getting addicted to substances or behaviors.

10:36.520 --> 10:37.920
 So how does this work?

10:37.920 --> 10:40.740
 Well, you've got a structure in the deep part of your brain

10:40.740 --> 10:44.080
 called the VTA, it stands for ventral tegmental area.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.240
 As always, you don't have to remember these names,

10:46.240 --> 10:48.240
 but if you want to, I offer them to you

10:48.240 --> 10:51.640
 for further Googling, research, reading, et cetera.

10:51.640 --> 10:55.140
 The VTA or ventral tegmental area contains neurons

10:55.140 --> 10:58.480
 that send what we call axons, little wires,

10:58.480 --> 11:01.440
 that spit out dopamine at a different structure

11:01.440 --> 11:03.360
 called the nucleus accumbens.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.080
 And those two structures, VTA and nucleus accumbens,

11:06.080 --> 11:10.240
 form really the core machinery of the reward pathway

11:10.240 --> 11:13.880
 and the pathway that controls your motivation for anything.

11:13.880 --> 11:16.160
 You can think of them like an accelerator,

11:16.160 --> 11:18.740
 they bias you for action.

11:18.740 --> 11:22.400
 However, within the reward pathway, there's also a break.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.840
 The break or restriction on that dopamine,

11:24.840 --> 11:26.440
 which controls when it's released

11:26.440 --> 11:29.560
 and how much it's released is the prefrontal cortex.

11:29.560 --> 11:31.900
 The prefrontal cortex is the neural real estate

11:31.900 --> 11:33.720
 right behind your forehead.

11:33.720 --> 11:36.160
 It's discussed for so many aspects of neuroscience,

11:36.160 --> 11:39.240
 you hear about it for decision-making, executive function,

11:39.240 --> 11:40.840
 for planning, et cetera.

11:40.840 --> 11:42.580
 And indeed it's responsible for a lot of those.

11:42.580 --> 11:44.640
 It's this really unique real estate

11:44.640 --> 11:46.740
 that we were all endowed with as humans.

11:46.740 --> 11:49.560
 Other animals don't have much of it, we have a lot of it.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.880
 And that prefrontal cortex acts as a break

11:51.880 --> 11:53.360
 on the dopamine system.

11:53.360 --> 11:56.920
 Without that break, you would be purely a pleasure

11:56.920 --> 11:58.320
 seeking animal.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.040
 You would be purely pleasure seeking.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.300
 You would have no basis for regulating your behavior

12:04.300 --> 12:07.760
 in terms of trying to get things that make you feel good.

12:07.760 --> 12:12.080
 And that brings us to the important feature of motivation,

12:12.080 --> 12:14.860
 which is that motivation is a two-part process,

12:14.860 --> 12:19.060
 which is about balancing pleasure and pain, okay?

12:19.060 --> 12:21.640
 Most people think about motivation and reward and dopamine

12:21.640 --> 12:24.280
 as just trying to achieve pleasure.

12:24.280 --> 12:27.840
 And indeed dopamine is released in the brain from the VTA

12:27.840 --> 12:29.900
 at the nucleus accumbens

12:29.900 --> 12:32.540
 when we experience things that we like.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.940
 So here's the way to conceptualize this.

12:34.940 --> 12:36.920
 And if you can internalize this in your mind,

12:36.920 --> 12:39.280
 it will really help you as you move through your day

12:39.280 --> 12:41.260
 trying to understand why you might be motivated

12:41.260 --> 12:43.320
 or not motivated for certain things.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.920
 So when you're just sitting around

12:44.920 --> 12:46.320
 not doing much of anything,

12:46.320 --> 12:47.720
 maybe you wake up in bed in the morning,

12:47.720 --> 12:50.480
 you're thinking about getting up or not,

12:50.480 --> 12:53.920
 this reward pathway is releasing dopamine

12:53.920 --> 12:56.880
 at a rate of about three or four times per second.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.360
 It's kind of firing at a low level.

12:58.360 --> 13:00.800
 When I say firing, I mean electrical activity in the neurons.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.960
 So when you're just around, you feel okay, not depressed,

13:03.960 --> 13:06.220
 not highly motivated, not excited,

13:06.220 --> 13:09.080
 maybe three or four times a second.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.500
 If suddenly you get excited about something,

13:11.500 --> 13:14.720
 you anticipate something, not receive an award,

13:14.720 --> 13:17.720
 but you get excited in an anticipatory way,

13:17.720 --> 13:22.200
 then the rate of firing, the rate of activity

13:22.200 --> 13:24.480
 in this reward pathway suddenly increases

13:24.480 --> 13:26.840
 to like 30 or 40 times.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.400
 And it has the effect of creating a sense of action

13:30.400 --> 13:32.160
 or desire to move in the direction

13:32.160 --> 13:33.680
 of the thing that you're craving.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.320
 In fact, it's fair to say that dopamine is responsible

13:37.320 --> 13:39.360
 for wanting and for craving.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.160
 And that's distinctly different

13:41.160 --> 13:43.240
 from the way that you hear it talked about normally,

13:43.240 --> 13:44.920
 which is that it's involved in pleasure.

13:44.920 --> 13:48.280
 So yes, dopamine is released in response to sex.

13:48.280 --> 13:49.800
 It's released in response to food.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.400
 It's released in response to a lot of things,

13:52.400 --> 13:55.280
 but it's mostly released in anticipation

13:55.280 --> 13:57.600
 and craving for a particular thing.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.160
 It has the effect of narrowing our focus

14:00.160 --> 14:02.040
 for the thing that we crave.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.240
 And that thing could be as simple as a cup of coffee.

14:04.240 --> 14:07.180
 It could be as important as a big board meeting.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.480
 It could be a big final exam.

14:08.480 --> 14:11.600
 It could be the person that we're excited to meet or see.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.440
 Dopamine doesn't care about what you're craving.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.240
 It just releases at a particular rate.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.200
 In fact, if we just take a step back

14:19.200 --> 14:21.240
 and we look at the scientific data

14:21.240 --> 14:25.240
 on how much the dopamine firing increases

14:25.240 --> 14:26.560
 in response to different things,

14:26.560 --> 14:28.820
 you get a pretty interesting window

14:28.820 --> 14:30.660
 into how your brain works

14:30.660 --> 14:33.280
 and why you might be motivated or not motivated.

14:33.280 --> 14:35.120
 Let's say you're hungry

14:35.120 --> 14:37.640
 or you're looking forward to a cup of coffee

14:37.640 --> 14:40.520
 or you're going to see your partner.

14:40.520 --> 14:43.720
 Well, your dopamine neurons are firing at a low rate

14:43.720 --> 14:46.400
 until you start thinking about the thing that you want

14:46.400 --> 14:48.880
 or the thing that you're looking forward to.

14:48.880 --> 14:51.720
 Let's say you're craving chocolate or a good meal,

14:51.720 --> 14:53.600
 steak if you like steak

14:53.600 --> 14:56.120
 or a nice plate of pasta if you like pasta.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.160
 When you eat that food,

14:58.160 --> 14:59.920
 the amount of dopamine that's released

14:59.920 --> 15:04.040
 in this reward pathway goes up about 50% above baseline.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.640
 The neurons there go from firing

15:06.640 --> 15:08.440
 three or four times per second

15:08.440 --> 15:10.560
 to six or 10 times per second.

15:10.560 --> 15:13.120
 It really depends and these aren't exact numbers

15:13.120 --> 15:13.960
 but if we were to measure

15:13.960 --> 15:16.040
 the amount of dopamine that's released,

15:16.040 --> 15:18.640
 it goes up about 50%, all right?

15:19.560 --> 15:23.620
 Sex, which is fundamental to our species continuation

15:23.620 --> 15:24.760
 and reproduction,

15:24.760 --> 15:27.900
 although it doesn't have to be for conceiving children,

15:27.900 --> 15:30.100
 sex does release dopamine

15:30.100 --> 15:33.040
 and it increases dopamine levels about 100%.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.480
 So basically doubles them.

15:35.360 --> 15:38.160
 Nicotine of the sort that's in cigarettes

15:38.160 --> 15:41.240
 or some people are taking nicotine in supplemental form

15:41.240 --> 15:45.740
 increases the amount of dopamine about 150% above baseline.

15:45.740 --> 15:48.240
 It also does some other things that we're going to talk about

15:48.240 --> 15:50.600
 but nicotine does that

15:50.600 --> 15:52.080
 and it's kind of interesting that nicotine

15:52.080 --> 15:54.280
 would increase the amount of dopamine in your brain

15:54.280 --> 15:57.640
 very quickly within seconds.

15:57.640 --> 16:00.780
 That's 150 times over baseline

16:00.780 --> 16:04.360
 as opposed to sex which is 100% above

16:04.360 --> 16:06.960
 or food which is 50%.

16:06.960 --> 16:09.640
 Cocaine and amphetamine increase the amount of dopamine

16:09.640 --> 16:11.760
 that's released a thousand fold

16:11.760 --> 16:14.980
 within about 10 seconds of consuming the drug.

16:14.980 --> 16:18.980
 However, just thinking about food, about sex,

16:19.840 --> 16:22.040
 about nicotine if you like nicotine

16:22.040 --> 16:23.680
 or cocaine or amphetamine

16:23.680 --> 16:26.480
 can increase the amount of dopamine that's released

16:26.480 --> 16:30.240
 to the same degree as actually consuming the drug.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.760
 Now it depends, in some cases for instance,

16:32.760 --> 16:36.040
 the cocaine user, the addict that wants cocaine

16:36.040 --> 16:37.880
 can't just think about cocaine

16:37.880 --> 16:40.740
 and increase the amount that's released about a thousand fold

16:40.740 --> 16:42.120
 it's actually much lower

16:42.120 --> 16:44.720
 but it's just enough to put them on the motivation track

16:44.720 --> 16:47.080
 for it to crave that particular thing.

16:47.080 --> 16:48.240
 Now there are reasons why

16:48.240 --> 16:49.800
 you would have brain circuitry like this.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.000
 I mean, brain circuitry like this

16:51.000 --> 16:52.840
 didn't evolve to get you addicted.

16:52.840 --> 16:56.400
 Brain circuitry like this evolved

16:56.400 --> 16:59.560
 in order to motivate behaviors toward particular goals,

16:59.560 --> 17:03.120
 water when you're thirsty, sex in order to reproduce.

17:03.120 --> 17:04.400
 And we're going to talk about the relationship

17:04.400 --> 17:06.880
 between estrogen and testosterone in the dopamine system

17:06.880 --> 17:10.500
 because those hormones actually bias dopamine to be released.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.780
 These things and these brain areas and neurons

17:13.780 --> 17:16.640
 were part of the evolutionary history

17:16.640 --> 17:19.280
 that led to the continuation of our species.

17:19.280 --> 17:21.640
 Things like cocaine and amphetamine

17:21.640 --> 17:23.240
 are disastrous for most people

17:23.240 --> 17:25.440
 because they release so much dopamine

17:25.440 --> 17:27.200
 and they create these closed loops

17:27.200 --> 17:30.360
 where people then only crave the particular thing,

17:30.360 --> 17:31.700
 cocaine and amphetamine

17:31.700 --> 17:34.480
 that leads to those massive amounts of dopamine release.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.840
 Most things don't release that level of dopamine.

17:37.840 --> 17:40.740
 Nowadays, there's a ton of interest in social media

17:40.740 --> 17:42.340
 and in video games.

17:42.340 --> 17:45.080
 And there have been some measurements

17:45.080 --> 17:46.760
 of the amount of dopamine released.

17:46.760 --> 17:49.000
 Video games, especially video games

17:49.000 --> 17:51.040
 that have a very high update speed

17:51.040 --> 17:53.280
 where there's novel territory all the time.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.700
 Novelty is a big stimulus of dopamine.

17:55.700 --> 17:56.960
 Those can release dopamine

17:56.960 --> 17:59.680
 somewhere between nicotine and cocaine.

17:59.680 --> 18:02.600
 So very high levels of dopamine release.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.700
 Social media is an interesting one

18:04.700 --> 18:05.960
 because the amount of dopamine

18:05.960 --> 18:08.880
 that's released in response to logging onto social media

18:08.880 --> 18:10.740
 initially could be quite high,

18:10.740 --> 18:12.500
 but it seems like likely

18:12.500 --> 18:14.920
 that there's a taper in the amount of dopamine

18:14.920 --> 18:16.720
 and yet people still get addicted.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.540
 So why?

18:17.540 --> 18:20.060
 Why is it that we can get addicted to things

18:20.060 --> 18:23.840
 that fail to elicit the same massive amount of pleasure

18:23.840 --> 18:25.520
 that they initially did?

18:25.520 --> 18:28.040
 Being addicted to something isn't just about

18:28.040 --> 18:29.560
 the fact that it feels so good

18:29.560 --> 18:31.040
 that you want to do it over and over again.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.760
 And that's because of this pleasure pain balance

18:34.760 --> 18:36.160
 that underlies motivation.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.320
 So let's look a little bit closer

18:37.320 --> 18:38.480
 at the pleasure pain balance

18:38.480 --> 18:41.000
 because therein lies the tools

18:41.000 --> 18:42.960
 for you to be able to control motivation

18:42.960 --> 18:45.920
 toward healthy things and avoid motivated behaviors

18:45.920 --> 18:48.140
 towards things that are destructive for you.

18:48.140 --> 18:51.320
 There are a lot of reasons why people try novel behaviors,

18:51.320 --> 18:52.580
 whether or not those are drugs

18:52.580 --> 18:55.660
 or whether or not those are adventure thrill-seeking things

18:55.660 --> 18:59.700
 or they seek out new partners or they take a new class.

18:59.700 --> 19:02.040
 As you'll notice, I'm not placing any judgment

19:02.040 --> 19:03.880
 or value on these different behaviors.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.080
 Although I think it's fair to point out that

19:06.080 --> 19:09.720
 for most people, addictive drugs like cocaine

19:09.720 --> 19:12.400
 and amphetamine are very destructive.

19:13.280 --> 19:17.480
 Actually, we know that about 15 to 20% of people

19:17.480 --> 19:20.680
 have a genetic bias towards addiction

19:20.680 --> 19:23.680
 that you sometimes hear that the first time

19:23.680 --> 19:26.220
 that you use a drug, you can become addicted to it.

19:26.220 --> 19:28.120
 That's actually not been shown to be true

19:28.120 --> 19:29.720
 for most things and most people,

19:29.720 --> 19:31.640
 but for some people that actually is true.

19:31.640 --> 19:32.960
 And we'll talk a little bit later

19:32.960 --> 19:35.760
 about why certain people are heavily biased

19:35.760 --> 19:38.760
 toward becoming addicts on the first use

19:38.760 --> 19:40.020
 of a particular drug.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.120
 It's actually very interesting.

19:41.120 --> 19:43.000
 It has everything to do with whether or not

19:43.000 --> 19:46.220
 they were formally addicted to something else.

19:46.220 --> 19:49.400
 But in any case, the way that addiction works

19:49.400 --> 19:51.560
 and the way that motivation works generally

19:51.560 --> 19:53.120
 in the non-addictive setting

19:53.120 --> 19:54.920
 is that when you anticipate something,

19:54.920 --> 19:56.600
 a little bit of dopamine is released.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.040
 And then when you reach that thing,

19:58.040 --> 20:00.240
 you engage in that thing,

20:00.240 --> 20:02.680
 the amount of dopamine goes up even further.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.540
 But as you repeatedly pursue a behavior

20:05.540 --> 20:07.880
 and you repeatedly engage with a particular thing,

20:07.880 --> 20:11.100
 let's say you love running or you love chocolate.

20:11.100 --> 20:13.560
 As you eat a piece of chocolate,

20:13.560 --> 20:15.880
 believe it or not, it tastes good.

20:15.880 --> 20:20.400
 And then there's a shift away from activation of dopamine.

20:20.400 --> 20:22.880
 And there are other chemicals that are released

20:22.880 --> 20:25.760
 that trigger a low level sense of pain.

20:25.760 --> 20:27.760
 Now you might not feel it as physical pain,

20:27.760 --> 20:32.240
 but the craving that you feel is both one part dopamine

20:32.240 --> 20:34.920
 and one part the mirror image of dopamine,

20:34.920 --> 20:36.860
 which is the pain or the craving

20:36.860 --> 20:39.080
 for yet another piece of chocolate.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.440
 And this is a very important and subtle feature

20:41.440 --> 20:44.400
 of the dopamine system that's not often discussed.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.180
 People always talk about it just as pleasure.

20:46.180 --> 20:48.820
 You love social media, so it gives you dopamine.

20:48.820 --> 20:49.680
 And so you engage in that.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.960
 You like chocolate, it releases dopamine, so you do that.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.460
 But for every bit of dopamine that's released,

20:54.460 --> 20:57.160
 there's another circuit in the brain that creates,

20:57.160 --> 20:58.200
 you can think of it as kind of like

20:58.200 --> 21:00.240
 a downward deflection in pleasure.

21:00.240 --> 21:02.160
 So you engage in something you really want,

21:02.160 --> 21:03.640
 and there's an increase in pleasure.

21:03.640 --> 21:07.720
 And then there's a, without you doing anything,

21:07.720 --> 21:09.140
 there's a mirror image of that,

21:09.140 --> 21:11.160
 which is a downward deflection in pleasure,

21:11.160 --> 21:12.400
 which we're calling pain.

21:12.400 --> 21:13.940
 So for every bit of pleasure,

21:13.940 --> 21:16.820
 there is a mirror image experience of pain.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.180
 And they overlap in time very closely.

21:19.180 --> 21:21.360
 So it's sometimes hard to sense this, but try it.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.280
 The next time you eat something really delicious,

21:23.280 --> 21:25.120
 you'll take a bite, it tastes delicious.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.880
 And part of the experience is to want more of that thing.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.000
 This is true for any pleasureful experience.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.320
 Now, the diabolical part about dopamine

21:34.320 --> 21:36.600
 is that because it didn't evolve

21:36.600 --> 21:38.220
 in order to get you to indulge

21:38.220 --> 21:40.720
 in more and more and more of something,

21:40.720 --> 21:44.120
 what happens is that initially,

21:44.120 --> 21:47.460
 you experience an increase in pleasure,

21:47.460 --> 21:50.820
 and you also experience this increase in pain shortly after

21:50.820 --> 21:53.040
 or woven in with the pleasure

21:53.040 --> 21:55.040
 that makes you want more of that thing.

21:55.040 --> 21:57.840
 But with each subsequent time

21:57.840 --> 21:59.640
 that you encounter that thing,

21:59.640 --> 22:01.260
 that you pursue the chocolate,

22:01.260 --> 22:04.120
 that you pursue the lover,

22:04.120 --> 22:08.320
 each time the experience of dopamine release and pleasure

22:08.320 --> 22:10.200
 is diminished a little bit.

22:11.080 --> 22:14.480
 And the diabolical thing is that the pain response

22:14.480 --> 22:16.560
 is increased a little bit.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.120
 And this is best observed

22:18.120 --> 22:20.320
 in the context of drug-seeking behavior.

22:20.320 --> 22:24.080
 The first time someone decides to take cocaine or amphetamine,

22:24.080 --> 22:25.520
 they may do it out of boredom.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.040
 They may do it out of peer pressure.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.660
 They may do it to relieve some internal sense.

22:29.660 --> 22:31.280
 Maybe they're bored or they're just excited.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.320
 Maybe they're high in novelty seeking.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.260
 There are a lot of reasons why people might try a drug,

22:36.260 --> 22:39.860
 far too many for us to get into or parse here.

22:39.860 --> 22:40.840
 Maybe they don't even want to do it,

22:40.840 --> 22:42.300
 but someone encourages them.

22:42.300 --> 22:44.720
 They will experience a huge dopamine release

22:44.720 --> 22:47.880
 and they will feel likely very good.

22:47.880 --> 22:49.240
 However, the next time they take it,

22:49.240 --> 22:50.960
 it won't feel quite as good.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.400
 And it won't feel even as good

22:52.400 --> 22:54.420
 the third time or the next time.

22:54.420 --> 22:58.580
 But the amount of pain, the amount of craving

22:58.580 --> 23:01.360
 that they experience for the drug will increase over time.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.340
 So much of our pursuit of pleasure

23:03.340 --> 23:06.640
 is simply to reduce the pain of craving.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.920
 So the next time you experience something you really like,

23:08.920 --> 23:10.580
 I don't want to take you out of that experience,

23:10.580 --> 23:13.480
 but it's really important that you notice this,

23:13.480 --> 23:15.820
 that if there's something you really enjoy,

23:15.820 --> 23:19.240
 part of that enjoyment is about the anticipation

23:19.240 --> 23:21.720
 and wanting of more of that thing.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.280
 And that's the pain system in action.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.320
 And so we can distinguish between dopamine,

23:26.320 --> 23:28.240
 which is really about pleasure and dopamine,

23:28.240 --> 23:30.920
 which is really about motivation to pursue more

23:30.920 --> 23:34.880
 in order to relieve or exclude future pain.

23:34.880 --> 23:35.840
 Let me repeat that.

23:35.840 --> 23:37.940
 Dopamine isn't as much about pleasure

23:37.940 --> 23:42.360
 as much as it is about motivation and desire to pursue more

23:42.360 --> 23:46.080
 in order to reduce the amount of pain.

23:46.080 --> 23:49.060
 And we are now talking about pain as a psychological pain

23:49.060 --> 23:50.840
 and a craving, although people

23:50.840 --> 23:53.800
 that miss a lover very badly

23:53.800 --> 23:57.080
 or that really crave a food very badly

23:57.080 --> 24:01.120
 or that are addicted to a drug and can't access it

24:01.120 --> 24:04.280
 will experience that as a physical craving

24:04.280 --> 24:05.360
 and a mental craving.

24:05.360 --> 24:07.480
 The body and brain are linked in this way.

24:07.480 --> 24:09.440
 It's almost, they'll describe it as painful.

24:09.440 --> 24:10.760
 They yearn for it.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.240
 And I think the word yearning

24:12.240 --> 24:14.280
 is one that's very valuable in this context

24:14.280 --> 24:18.320
 because yearning seems to include a whole body experience

24:18.320 --> 24:21.680
 more than just wanting, which could just be up in the mind.

24:21.680 --> 24:25.320
 So your desire for something is proportional

24:25.320 --> 24:29.420
 to how pleasureful it is to indulge in that thing,

24:29.420 --> 24:31.200
 but also how much pain you experience

24:31.200 --> 24:32.640
 when you don't have it.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.200
 And you can now start to let your mind wander

24:35.200 --> 24:37.020
 into all sorts of examples of addictions

24:37.020 --> 24:39.140
 or things that you happen to like.

24:39.140 --> 24:41.080
 I'll use the example that I sometimes use on here,

24:41.080 --> 24:42.520
 which is my love of croissants,

24:42.520 --> 24:43.820
 although several of you pointed out

24:43.820 --> 24:45.260
 these are called croissants,

24:45.260 --> 24:46.960
 but then it sounds like I'm trying to speak French

24:46.960 --> 24:48.880
 and I always tried to do that when I was a kid

24:48.880 --> 24:50.740
 and I went to a bilingual school and it failed then,

24:50.740 --> 24:51.640
 and it's going to fail now.

24:51.640 --> 24:53.680
 So I'm going to call them croissants.

24:53.680 --> 24:54.560
 They're delicious.

24:54.560 --> 24:55.400
 I love them.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.600
 A really good one makes me want to eat six.

24:58.600 --> 24:59.440
 It's true.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.640
 I have pretty good impulse control, I think,

25:01.640 --> 25:04.060
 but it makes me want to eat six.

25:04.060 --> 25:05.980
 I taste it and it tastes so delicious.

25:05.980 --> 25:09.140
 And unless I really force myself

25:09.140 --> 25:11.460
 to experience the taste of it in my mouth

25:11.460 --> 25:13.400
 and how flaky I'm getting hungry for it right now

25:13.400 --> 25:15.320
 and delicious the croissant is,

25:15.320 --> 25:17.280
 mostly the taste of that croissant

25:17.280 --> 25:19.200
 makes me want to eat more croissants.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.200
 Now, eventually blood sugar goes up,

25:21.200 --> 25:22.640
 satiety is reached, et cetera.

25:22.640 --> 25:23.540
 What happens then?

25:23.540 --> 25:25.880
 What is satisfaction and satiety about?

25:25.880 --> 25:27.820
 Well, that's a separate neuromodulator.

25:27.820 --> 25:30.520
 That's about the neuromodulator serotonin.

25:30.520 --> 25:32.320
 It's about oxytocin.

25:32.320 --> 25:34.260
 It's about a hormone system

25:34.260 --> 25:35.820
 that involves something called prolactin.

25:35.820 --> 25:38.220
 So we're going to talk about all of those

25:38.220 --> 25:40.720
 in the book, The Molecule of More, wonderful book.

25:41.880 --> 25:44.360
 Those were described as the here and now molecules,

25:44.360 --> 25:47.120
 the ones that allow you to experience your sensations

25:47.120 --> 25:48.400
 and pleasure in the present

25:48.400 --> 25:51.660
 and for which the brain stops projecting into the future.

25:51.660 --> 25:53.560
 So now let's talk about craving

25:53.560 --> 25:55.960
 and these so-called here and now molecules

25:55.960 --> 25:59.040
 and how those engage in a kind of push-pull balance

25:59.040 --> 26:02.240
 that will allow you to not just feel more motivated

26:02.240 --> 26:04.480
 but also to enjoy the things in life

26:04.480 --> 26:07.600
 that you are pursuing to a much greater degree.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.520
 We have neurons in an area of our brain

26:09.520 --> 26:12.220
 called the raphe, R-A-P-H-E.

26:12.220 --> 26:15.160
 The raphe releases serotonin

26:15.160 --> 26:16.740
 at different places in the brain.

26:16.740 --> 26:20.920
 Serotonin is the molecule of bliss and contentment

26:20.920 --> 26:22.560
 for what you already have.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.600
 I've talked before about exteroception.

26:25.600 --> 26:28.400
 Exteroception is a focus on the outside world,

26:28.400 --> 26:31.000
 everything beyond the confines of your skin.

26:31.000 --> 26:32.840
 We've also talked about interoception,

26:32.840 --> 26:34.880
 a focus on things that are happening internally

26:34.880 --> 26:36.540
 within the confines of your skin.

26:36.540 --> 26:41.540
 Dopamine and serotonin can be thought of

26:42.760 --> 26:45.200
 as related to exteroception.

26:45.200 --> 26:47.580
 Dopamine makes us focused on things outside us

26:47.580 --> 26:50.460
 that are beyond what we call our personal space

26:50.460 --> 26:53.280
 where we actually have to move and take action

26:53.280 --> 26:54.820
 in order to achieve things.

26:54.820 --> 26:57.640
 And serotonin in general has to do with the things

26:57.640 --> 26:59.320
 that are in our immediate here and now,

26:59.320 --> 27:00.540
 hence the description of these

27:00.540 --> 27:02.700
 as the here and now molecules.

27:02.700 --> 27:06.480
 So it's interesting to point out that the body

27:06.480 --> 27:09.220
 and the brain can direct its attention

27:09.220 --> 27:10.900
 towards things outside us or inside us

27:10.900 --> 27:12.480
 or split our attention between those.

27:12.480 --> 27:14.040
 I talked about this in a previous podcast,

27:14.040 --> 27:16.240
 but if you didn't see it, no problem.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.620
 Just understand that dopamine biases us

27:18.620 --> 27:20.780
 toward thinking about what we don't have.

27:20.780 --> 27:23.420
 Whereas serotonin and some of the related molecules

27:23.420 --> 27:25.560
 like the endocannabinoids,

27:25.560 --> 27:27.060
 if you picked up on the word cannabinoid,

27:27.060 --> 27:28.160
 yes, it's like cannabis

27:28.160 --> 27:32.420
 because cannabis attaches to endocannabinoid receptors.

27:32.420 --> 27:35.280
 And the endocannabinoids are receptors and chemicals

27:35.280 --> 27:37.460
 that the cannabinoids that you naturally make

27:37.460 --> 27:40.080
 that are involved in things like forgetting.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.180
 It's not a coincidence that pot smokers

27:42.180 --> 27:43.700
 don't have the most terrific memory.

27:43.700 --> 27:45.500
 You may know a few that have great memories,

27:45.500 --> 27:48.080
 but chances are they would have even better memories

27:48.080 --> 27:50.240
 if they weren't pot smokers.

27:50.240 --> 27:52.940
 But you make these molecules that bind to these receptors

27:52.940 --> 27:54.720
 that make you feel kind of blissed out

27:54.720 --> 27:56.760
 and content in the present.

27:56.760 --> 27:58.660
 Those are receptors that exist in us

27:58.660 --> 28:03.100
 not for sake of consuming THC or marijuana,

28:03.100 --> 28:07.320
 but for sake of binding of our natural endogenous cannabinoids.

28:07.320 --> 28:08.520
 So you've got these two systems.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.340
 They're kind of like a push-pull.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.860
 And if you were to say, do the,

28:12.860 --> 28:14.820
 in the book, wherever you go, there you are,

28:14.820 --> 28:17.480
 Jon Kabat-Zinn talks about this meditation practice

28:17.480 --> 28:19.460
 that's different than most meditation practices

28:19.460 --> 28:21.020
 where you eat one almond

28:21.020 --> 28:23.780
 and you focus all of your attention on the almond,

28:23.780 --> 28:26.380
 the taste of the almond, the texture of the almond.

28:26.380 --> 28:28.700
 That's really a mindfulness practice

28:28.700 --> 28:31.380
 that's geared towards trying to take a behavior

28:31.380 --> 28:33.640
 which is normally about pursuit.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.780
 Normally feeding is we're going,

28:35.780 --> 28:38.040
 we engage in feeding because of dopamine.

28:38.040 --> 28:39.220
 We pursue more of a food

28:39.220 --> 28:40.820
 because of that pleasure pain relationship

28:40.820 --> 28:42.140
 I talked about before.

28:42.140 --> 28:44.500
 The focus on the one almond

28:44.500 --> 28:47.320
 or becoming very present in any behavior

28:47.320 --> 28:49.100
 that normally would be a kind of

28:49.100 --> 28:51.340
 exteroceptive pursuit behavior

28:51.340 --> 28:53.460
 and bring it into the here and now,

28:53.460 --> 28:57.980
 that's a mental trick or a mental task

28:57.980 --> 29:00.740
 that the mindfulness community has really embraced

29:00.740 --> 29:02.980
 in order to try and create increased pleasure

29:02.980 --> 29:04.540
 for what you already have.

29:04.540 --> 29:06.740
 It's really trying to accomplish a shift

29:06.740 --> 29:08.700
 from dopamine being released

29:08.700 --> 29:11.420
 to serotonin and the cannabinoid system

29:11.420 --> 29:13.480
 being involved in that behavior.

29:13.480 --> 29:15.460
 So if you're interested in mindfulness

29:15.460 --> 29:17.380
 which is something I've talked about before in this podcast

29:17.380 --> 29:20.020
 and I sort of made some off the cuff jokes

29:20.020 --> 29:22.480
 about the opposite of mindfulness being mindlessness.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.080
 Mindfulness is a vast space.

29:24.080 --> 29:25.600
 That is a mindful practice

29:25.600 --> 29:26.980
 that a lot of people have engaged in.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.620
 And indeed it can give you deeper appreciation

29:29.620 --> 29:31.440
 for things that you already have.

29:31.440 --> 29:33.740
 Dopamine has the quality of making people

29:33.740 --> 29:35.920
 kind of rabidly in pursuit of things.

29:35.920 --> 29:38.060
 Look at people who are high on cocaine or amphetamine

29:38.060 --> 29:41.080
 and they are almost entirely exteroceptive.

29:41.080 --> 29:45.820
 Drugs like marijuana, the opioids,

29:45.820 --> 29:50.220
 anything that really hits the serotonin system hard

29:50.220 --> 29:52.140
 tend to make people rather lethargic

29:52.140 --> 29:53.740
 and content to stay exactly where they are.

29:53.740 --> 29:56.020
 They don't want to pursue much at all.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.460
 Occasionally when people smoke marijuana

29:59.460 --> 30:01.680
 or consume THC, their appetite goes way up

30:01.680 --> 30:03.340
 and they really want to consume food.

30:03.340 --> 30:05.660
 That's because of its effects on insulin

30:05.660 --> 30:07.140
 and its effects on blood sugar

30:07.140 --> 30:09.020
 which is a slightly separate matter.

30:09.020 --> 30:11.260
 But since some of you probably your minds

30:11.260 --> 30:14.180
 might've gone to those either experiences

30:14.180 --> 30:18.220
 or reports of what pot does, that's why it does that.

30:18.220 --> 30:20.400
 So you've got these molecules like dopamine

30:20.400 --> 30:22.180
 that make you focused on the things you want

30:22.180 --> 30:23.220
 and the things you crave.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.700
 And then you've got the molecules

30:24.700 --> 30:26.860
 that make you content with what you have.

30:26.860 --> 30:30.040
 So the most important thing perhaps

30:30.040 --> 30:32.940
 in creating a healthy emotional landscape

30:32.940 --> 30:33.900
 is to have a balance

30:33.900 --> 30:36.140
 between these two neuromodulator systems.

30:36.140 --> 30:38.300
 People that are always in anticipation

30:38.300 --> 30:40.360
 and desire and seeking,

30:40.360 --> 30:42.740
 that's wonderful for pursuing goals.

30:42.740 --> 30:45.180
 However, it's terrible for enjoying life.

30:45.180 --> 30:46.000
 And actually those people

30:46.000 --> 30:47.740
 are actually quite difficult to be around.

30:47.740 --> 30:50.420
 There's a certain almost sociopathic element

30:50.420 --> 30:53.140
 to people who are what they call hyper dopaminergic.

30:53.140 --> 30:56.140
 People who are always on the dopaminergic scale

30:56.140 --> 30:59.300
 to the point where they are always pursuing goals.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.600
 In fact, those people are known to be

31:01.600 --> 31:03.740
 at least in the psychological spectrum,

31:03.740 --> 31:05.540
 they can be very manipulative.

31:05.540 --> 31:07.820
 Dopamine and the pursuit of something

31:07.820 --> 31:10.080
 doesn't necessarily have to be high energy

31:10.080 --> 31:12.180
 and intense from the outside

31:12.180 --> 31:13.640
 when you observe it from the outside.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.300
 In fact, there are people who will manipulate

31:16.300 --> 31:17.920
 in order to get what they want.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.100
 This has been shown

31:19.100 --> 31:21.220
 who have high levels of dopamine release in their brain

31:21.220 --> 31:24.380
 but they've learned that a kind of passive manipulation

31:24.380 --> 31:27.440
 is the best way to maneuver through a particular environment.

31:27.440 --> 31:29.900
 I don't want to focus too much on sociopathy

31:29.900 --> 31:32.860
 because those are kind of extreme examples

31:32.860 --> 31:37.460
 but it just goes to show that people who identify a goal

31:37.460 --> 31:39.820
 and realize the series of steps that they need to take

31:39.820 --> 31:40.980
 in order to achieve that goal

31:40.980 --> 31:43.580
 can either do it through ethical means or non-ethical means.

31:43.580 --> 31:45.100
 They can do it through active pursuit

31:45.100 --> 31:46.580
 being the kind of type A person

31:46.580 --> 31:48.060
 that's always declaring their goals

31:48.060 --> 31:50.060
 and going after it, posting it on Instagram,

31:50.060 --> 31:53.100
 telling everybody about it, trying to recruit others.

31:53.100 --> 31:54.420
 There's that phenotype.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.860
 There's that kind of signature of dopamine.

31:57.860 --> 31:58.920
 And then there are the people

31:58.920 --> 32:00.420
 that want to get what they want

32:00.420 --> 32:02.400
 and they're doing it by always serving other people,

32:02.400 --> 32:04.340
 by always taking care of everybody else's needs,

32:04.340 --> 32:07.060
 by always trying to accomplish their goals

32:07.060 --> 32:09.800
 but through a mode that at least from the outside

32:09.800 --> 32:13.680
 seems more passive or more about supporting others.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.580
 Neither of these are good or bad

32:15.580 --> 32:17.820
 and that's because dopamine is a molecule.

32:17.820 --> 32:20.420
 It doesn't care how you reach your goals.

32:20.420 --> 32:22.540
 It only cares that you reach your goals

32:22.540 --> 32:26.000
 because the internal sensation is one again

32:26.000 --> 32:29.220
 of mild pleasure, a little bit of pain,

32:29.220 --> 32:30.680
 although more pain over time

32:30.680 --> 32:32.480
 if you're not reaching those goals

32:32.480 --> 32:36.380
 and it takes you away from the here and now.

32:36.380 --> 32:38.200
 So at about this point in the podcast,

32:38.200 --> 32:40.120
 I'm guessing that some of you are thinking,

32:40.120 --> 32:41.820
 okay, great, I want more dopamine.

32:41.820 --> 32:43.220
 I want to be more motivated.

32:43.220 --> 32:45.280
 I don't want to procrastinate as much

32:45.280 --> 32:47.740
 and I want to be able to experience life.

32:47.740 --> 32:50.760
 I want these here and now molecules to be released as well.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.080
 Well, there is a way to do that

32:52.080 --> 32:55.460
 but you have to understand the source of procrastination

32:55.460 --> 32:57.020
 is not one thing.

32:57.020 --> 32:59.200
 There are basically two kinds of procrastinators

32:59.200 --> 33:01.300
 or so says the research.

33:01.300 --> 33:04.500
 The first kind are people that actually really enjoy

33:04.500 --> 33:07.740
 the stress of the impending deadline.

33:07.740 --> 33:09.560
 It's the only way they can get into action.

33:09.560 --> 33:13.380
 These are people that really like the feeling of

33:13.380 --> 33:15.260
 something being due in an hour

33:15.260 --> 33:17.940
 and how activated and sharp and focused

33:17.940 --> 33:19.380
 that makes them feel.

33:19.380 --> 33:23.140
 Those people are people that are tapping into

33:23.140 --> 33:25.300
 the epinephrine system, the stress system

33:25.300 --> 33:28.580
 and for which the stress really tightens their ability

33:28.580 --> 33:31.620
 to see, it creates that soda straw view of the world.

33:31.620 --> 33:33.820
 It creates an action element in the body

33:33.820 --> 33:35.700
 that makes them feel like they want to move.

33:35.700 --> 33:39.360
 It really eliminates all the distractions for them.

33:39.360 --> 33:43.020
 So they're actually leveraging stress, internal stress

33:43.020 --> 33:44.740
 in order to achieve a state

33:44.740 --> 33:47.640
 that they can't seem to otherwise achieve.

33:47.640 --> 33:49.780
 I won't tell you what to do in order to overcome

33:49.780 --> 33:51.100
 all kinds of procrastination,

33:51.100 --> 33:54.540
 but from a logical perspective, it makes sense therefore

33:54.540 --> 33:56.780
 for those kinds of people to think about other ways

33:56.780 --> 33:58.940
 that they can get their system into activation.

33:58.940 --> 34:00.520
 I've talked about this in previous podcasts

34:00.520 --> 34:03.020
 but a couple of those tools might be

34:03.020 --> 34:05.300
 the what we call super oxygenation breathing

34:05.300 --> 34:07.700
 which I admit is not always super oxygenating.

34:07.700 --> 34:11.100
 So this would be, if you didn't want to consume anything

34:11.100 --> 34:16.100
 this could be 25 or 30 cycles of in deep inhales and exhales

34:16.100 --> 34:20.020
 it's likely to create some anxiety and low level stress.

34:20.020 --> 34:21.660
 If you're someone who's prone to panic attacks

34:21.660 --> 34:24.300
 I wouldn't recommend this, but it's pretty straightforward.

34:24.300 --> 34:26.180
 It will deploy adrenaline into your system

34:26.180 --> 34:29.020
 and you will find that your visual field is focused

34:29.020 --> 34:31.660
 and you will be able to work and focus better

34:31.660 --> 34:33.260
 than if you just kind of waited around

34:33.260 --> 34:37.120
 for some wave of motivation to wash over you.

34:37.120 --> 34:40.020
 Normally you're waiting for that deadline to come into sight

34:40.020 --> 34:41.840
 and then that's what the stimulus is.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.860
 But you can self-direct adrenaline release

34:43.860 --> 34:45.460
 without ingesting anything.

34:45.460 --> 34:49.540
 You can also ingest coffee, caffeine, or mate

34:49.540 --> 34:50.360
 or something like that

34:50.360 --> 34:53.420
 which is what I prefer very often to coffee

34:53.420 --> 34:54.420
 which has caffeine.

34:54.420 --> 34:57.240
 Caffeine does release dopamine at low levels.

34:57.240 --> 34:59.660
 How much it releases dopamine isn't clear.

34:59.660 --> 35:02.500
 It seems to increase firing in these neurons

35:02.500 --> 35:04.540
 in the nucleus accumbens by about 30%

35:04.540 --> 35:07.540
 which is a pretty low level, but it can create agitation.

35:07.540 --> 35:11.660
 So for caffeine sensitive people, that could be a problem.

35:11.660 --> 35:14.020
 I've talked before about things like L-tyrosine

35:14.020 --> 35:16.860
 the precursor to dopamine or macuna purines.

35:16.860 --> 35:18.260
 I talked about that in the last episode

35:18.260 --> 35:19.700
 but if you didn't see that, just to remind you

35:19.700 --> 35:23.920
 L-tyrosine is present in red meats, it's in certain nuts

35:23.920 --> 35:27.280
 and L-tyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.220
 You can supplement L-tyrosine if you like

35:29.220 --> 35:31.200
 you will get a big inflection in dopamine

35:31.200 --> 35:33.100
 but there is a crash associated with it.

35:33.100 --> 35:36.940
 However, it will increase motivation in the short term.

35:36.940 --> 35:38.180
 Not suggesting anyone do this.

35:38.180 --> 35:39.980
 I want to be very clear, say what I always say.

35:39.980 --> 35:40.900
 I'm not a doctor.

35:40.900 --> 35:42.060
 I don't prescribe anything.

35:42.060 --> 35:42.900
 I'm a professor.

35:42.900 --> 35:43.860
 I profess things.

35:43.860 --> 35:46.380
 You have to know whether or not these things are appropriate

35:46.380 --> 35:48.740
 for your mental and physical health or not.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.140
 So you need to consult a doctor.

35:50.140 --> 35:52.180
 For instance, people who suffer

35:52.180 --> 35:54.500
 from schizotypal or schizophrenia or mania

35:54.500 --> 35:56.620
 should probably not be taking supplements

35:56.620 --> 35:59.020
 that increase their dopamine levels.

35:59.020 --> 36:02.780
 Now, if you can't increase your level of focus

36:02.780 --> 36:04.300
 and your level of alertness and your level

36:04.300 --> 36:05.980
 of motivation using breathing,

36:05.980 --> 36:08.660
 well then there might be something else at play.

36:08.660 --> 36:10.140
 There are other procrastinators

36:10.140 --> 36:12.980
 for which they simply are not releasing enough dopamine.

36:12.980 --> 36:15.060
 They're not making enough dopamine.

36:15.060 --> 36:17.660
 And for those people, there are a variety of things

36:17.660 --> 36:18.780
 that can increase dopamine.

36:18.780 --> 36:21.180
 I do suggest you talk to a psychiatrist or doctor.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.700
 I've talked about macuna purines

36:22.700 --> 36:27.700
 which is 99.9% L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine.

36:28.080 --> 36:31.060
 So there are people that do much better

36:31.060 --> 36:34.820
 when they take things that increase their dopamine levels.

36:34.820 --> 36:39.020
 There are antidepressants like wellbutrin, bupryron

36:39.020 --> 36:41.240
 which increase, is the other name for it,

36:41.240 --> 36:43.360
 which increase dopamine and epinephrine.

36:43.360 --> 36:45.480
 It can increase risk of epileptic attacks

36:45.480 --> 36:46.320
 if you're epileptic.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.180
 So again, you have to talk to your doctor

36:48.180 --> 36:51.520
 but they will increase dopamine and motivation and focus.

36:52.700 --> 36:55.360
 However, if you think back to our earlier discussion

36:55.360 --> 37:00.360
 about dopamine, dopamine, if it's very high,

37:00.700 --> 37:04.040
 creates a sense of pleasure and the desire for more.

37:04.040 --> 37:06.420
 So you can also become a person

37:06.420 --> 37:08.860
 for which enough is never enough.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.120
 The only thing that dopamine really wants

37:11.120 --> 37:13.280
 is more of the thing that releases dopamine.

37:13.280 --> 37:15.180
 And so big inflections in dopamine,

37:15.180 --> 37:16.780
 whether or not they come from cocaine

37:16.780 --> 37:19.100
 or whether or not they come from a supplementation,

37:19.100 --> 37:21.540
 caffeine exercise study regime

37:21.540 --> 37:24.480
 will just make you want more of something.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.900
 And we've all heard before of growth mindset,

37:26.900 --> 37:29.300
 this incredible discovery of my colleague, Carol Dweck

37:29.300 --> 37:30.900
 or some of these positive mindsets

37:30.900 --> 37:32.940
 that the psychology community has put forth

37:32.940 --> 37:35.080
 as really good for pursuit of goals

37:35.080 --> 37:38.940
 and pursuit of things that require long bouts of effort.

37:38.940 --> 37:41.860
 Well, it's wonderful if you can learn to attach dopamine

37:41.860 --> 37:44.120
 to that process psychologically,

37:44.120 --> 37:46.500
 but if you're starting to augment the amount of dopamine,

37:46.500 --> 37:47.740
 increase the amount of dopamine

37:47.740 --> 37:50.740
 through things like supplementation and prescription drugs,

37:50.740 --> 37:52.140
 what's going to happen is

37:52.140 --> 37:54.900
 you're not only going to need to pursue more and more

37:54.900 --> 37:58.300
 of the sorts of things that are associated with the dopamine.

37:58.300 --> 38:01.780
 So doing more studying, more sport, more pursuit,

38:01.780 --> 38:05.020
 higher mountains, more money, more whatever.

38:05.020 --> 38:09.340
 But we know that over time, the mirror image of that,

38:09.340 --> 38:12.700
 the pain of lack of accomplishment will also increase.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.420
 This is the pleasure pain relationship

38:14.420 --> 38:15.940
 that we talked about earlier.

38:15.940 --> 38:17.940
 So in a few moments, I'm going to talk about

38:17.940 --> 38:21.100
 how to think about healthy dopamine schedules,

38:21.100 --> 38:23.580
 but I just want to take a step back for a second

38:23.580 --> 38:26.580
 and talk a little bit about the flip side of dopamine.

38:26.580 --> 38:29.560
 What happens after this so-called dopamine crash?

38:29.560 --> 38:32.340
 What mechanisms are installed in us?

38:32.340 --> 38:33.180
 Because believe it or not,

38:33.180 --> 38:35.620
 there are mechanisms that are installed in all of us

38:35.620 --> 38:39.100
 that really put the complete and total brake on dopamine,

38:39.100 --> 38:41.460
 why they're there and what they do,

38:41.460 --> 38:43.500
 because you've experienced these before

38:43.500 --> 38:46.620
 and there are actually ways that you can navigate them,

38:46.620 --> 38:48.500
 these dopamine crashes

38:48.500 --> 38:51.340
 or these intentional dopamine suppression mechanisms

38:51.340 --> 38:54.380
 in order to leverage healthier dopamine schedules

38:54.380 --> 38:56.240
 and to feel more motivated.

38:56.240 --> 39:00.940
 Perhaps one of the most fundamental mechanisms in all humans

39:00.940 --> 39:04.620
 is the neural circuitry designed for seeking out mates

39:04.620 --> 39:06.220
 and for reproduction.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.220
 And that's because the continuation of any one species

39:09.220 --> 39:12.660
 is the primary driver for any species.

39:12.660 --> 39:13.940
 That's just the reality.

39:13.940 --> 39:15.700
 Now I'm removing all context here.

39:15.700 --> 39:17.700
 So whatever I say, of course,

39:17.700 --> 39:22.700
 it's on a backdrop of consensual, age appropriate,

39:23.580 --> 39:27.260
 species appropriate, context appropriate, all of that.

39:27.260 --> 39:30.140
 This is not about the sociology of reproduction in sex.

39:30.140 --> 39:31.820
 This is about the biology.

39:31.820 --> 39:35.420
 The biology of sex in males and females,

39:35.420 --> 39:38.380
 it doesn't matter if it's XX chromosome, XY chromosome,

39:38.380 --> 39:41.380
 XXY, XYY, doesn't matter.

39:41.380 --> 39:45.780
 The reality is that dopamine is released on anticipation

39:45.780 --> 39:48.900
 and consummation of sex and reproduction.

39:48.900 --> 39:53.820
 And after orgasm, regardless of chromosomal background,

39:53.820 --> 39:57.140
 there's a dramatic decrease in dopamine

39:57.140 --> 40:00.100
 and an increase in a hormone called prolactin.

40:00.100 --> 40:02.980
 Now prolactin is associated with milk letdown

40:03.940 --> 40:05.340
 in lactating mothers.

40:05.340 --> 40:08.100
 It's also present in males.

40:08.100 --> 40:11.740
 And in general, prolactin creates a sense of lethargy,

40:11.740 --> 40:14.540
 of stillness and lack of desire to move

40:14.540 --> 40:16.500
 and lack of desire to pursue more

40:16.500 --> 40:18.940
 of whatever released the dopamine.

40:18.940 --> 40:21.760
 Prolactin in fact sets the refractory period

40:21.760 --> 40:25.100
 on a male's ability to mate again.

40:25.100 --> 40:27.300
 Now this is going to vary tremendously

40:27.300 --> 40:29.020
 from individual to individual.

40:29.020 --> 40:31.360
 It also can, there are data showing

40:31.360 --> 40:33.180
 that it can vary tremendously

40:33.180 --> 40:35.340
 from mate pairing to mate pairing.

40:35.340 --> 40:39.220
 The number one thing that releases dopamine is novelty.

40:39.220 --> 40:42.960
 And it is true that the refractory period is shortened

40:42.960 --> 40:44.820
 by the introduction of novel mates.

40:44.820 --> 40:47.700
 This was first shown in a kind of classic experiment

40:48.740 --> 40:50.500
 of all things in chickens.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.480
 This is called the Coolidge effect.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.940
 And the story is, the story goes,

40:54.940 --> 40:56.160
 and I believe it's a true story.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.820
 It's actually in all the neuroendocrinology textbooks.

40:58.820 --> 41:00.200
 So I believe it's true.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.180
 Is that president Calvin Coolidge

41:02.180 --> 41:05.820
 was visiting a chicken farm.

41:05.820 --> 41:07.700
 They were being taken around

41:07.700 --> 41:10.540
 and the person who was hosting the visit

41:10.540 --> 41:12.500
 showed them a rooster,

41:12.500 --> 41:15.140
 that was Coolidge and his wife were on the visit

41:15.140 --> 41:20.140
 and said, this rooster copulates thousands of times per day.

41:20.620 --> 41:23.860
 And Mrs. Coolidge apparently kind of elbowed

41:23.860 --> 41:25.840
 president Coolidge and said, you hear that?

41:25.840 --> 41:29.020
 Kind of like pointing out the prowess of this rooster

41:29.020 --> 41:32.540
 and Coolidge said, yeah, but let me ask you a question.

41:32.540 --> 41:34.580
 Same hen or different hens?

41:34.580 --> 41:36.300
 It turns out it was different hens.

41:36.300 --> 41:38.700
 And the reason is the introduction of a novel mate

41:38.700 --> 41:40.940
 increases dopamine levels.

41:40.940 --> 41:43.320
 And what's interesting about this

41:43.320 --> 41:45.900
 is that after copulation,

41:45.900 --> 41:47.620
 prolactin goes through the roof

41:47.620 --> 41:49.820
 and prevents further copulation.

41:49.820 --> 41:51.960
 Dopamine crashes.

41:51.960 --> 41:55.180
 But the introduction of some sort of novelty shortens this.

41:55.180 --> 42:00.180
 Now, this is not a ploy for people to change mates often.

42:01.140 --> 42:03.140
 What this is is a story about the dopamine

42:03.140 --> 42:06.380
 and prolactin system that also exists in humans.

42:06.380 --> 42:09.380
 Now there are actually things that people

42:09.380 --> 42:11.300
 in certain communities take

42:11.300 --> 42:13.340
 in order to bypass these refractory periods.

42:13.340 --> 42:16.520
 There's actually drugs that increase dopamine,

42:16.520 --> 42:19.020
 suppress prolactin and vice versa.

42:19.020 --> 42:21.780
 There's actually another way to suppress prolactin.

42:21.780 --> 42:26.780
 Vitamin B6 is a fairly potent prolactin inhibitor

42:27.100 --> 42:28.140
 as is zinc.

42:28.140 --> 42:29.900
 And if you look out there in the literature

42:29.900 --> 42:31.120
 and for those of you that are in the wellness

42:31.120 --> 42:32.700
 and kind of sports performance community,

42:32.700 --> 42:36.840
 a lot of the so-called quote unquote testosterone boosters

42:36.840 --> 42:40.900
 are actually combinations of vitamin B6 and zinc

42:40.900 --> 42:42.420
 which inhibit prolactin

42:42.420 --> 42:45.900
 and by way of inhibiting prolactin increase dopamine.

42:45.900 --> 42:49.980
 So they do have some functional effect in that regard.

42:49.980 --> 42:51.900
 They're not really increasing testosterone directly.

42:51.900 --> 42:54.540
 They're suppressing prolactin levels.

42:54.540 --> 42:57.420
 And there are clinical conditions like hyperprolactinemia

42:57.420 --> 43:01.300
 which leads to massive decreases in libido, et cetera.

43:01.300 --> 43:02.760
 And there are prescription drugs

43:02.760 --> 43:05.220
 to treat hyperprolactinemia,

43:05.220 --> 43:06.740
 which of course you should always talk

43:06.740 --> 43:07.700
 to an endocrinologist

43:07.700 --> 43:09.780
 about those sorts of prescription drugs.

43:09.780 --> 43:12.660
 So it's interesting that this very basic mechanism

43:12.660 --> 43:13.980
 of dopamine and prolactin,

43:13.980 --> 43:17.200
 this sort of motivation, no, no more motivation,

43:17.200 --> 43:20.140
 is a system that evolved for reproduction first

43:20.140 --> 43:21.900
 but that actually takes place.

43:21.900 --> 43:25.100
 And you can see elsewhere in the world.

43:25.100 --> 43:27.740
 For instance, schizophrenia,

43:27.740 --> 43:30.760
 a disease that has many different types and facets,

43:30.760 --> 43:33.200
 but schizophrenia is a case of,

43:33.200 --> 43:37.060
 often of hyperactivation of the dopamine system.

43:37.060 --> 43:39.600
 So much so that it can make people feel kind of high,

43:39.600 --> 43:40.460
 they hallucinate.

43:40.460 --> 43:42.180
 I mean, we're talking very, very high

43:42.180 --> 43:46.220
 or dysregulated dopamine circuits in the brain.

43:46.220 --> 43:49.780
 One of the treatments for schizophrenia

43:49.780 --> 43:52.760
 are drugs that block dopamine receptors.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.620
 And if you have the, it's unfortunate,

43:55.620 --> 43:57.460
 there are so many people that are out on the street

43:57.460 --> 43:59.100
 these days who have schizophrenia,

43:59.100 --> 44:01.800
 some of whom are taking their meds, some of whom aren't.

44:01.800 --> 44:04.100
 If you ever see somebody on the street

44:04.100 --> 44:07.380
 that's doing what's, it's like a lip smacking and writhing,

44:07.380 --> 44:09.820
 it's actually called tardive dyskinesia.

44:09.820 --> 44:12.700
 This is a movement disorder

44:12.700 --> 44:16.300
 that's created by taking these anti-dopaminergic drugs.

44:16.300 --> 44:18.900
 So you can imagine these anti-dopaminergic drugs

44:18.900 --> 44:21.220
 while being very effective in suppressing hallucinations,

44:21.220 --> 44:23.340
 they create these movement problems

44:23.340 --> 44:27.580
 because of dopamine's importance for the movement circuitry,

44:27.580 --> 44:30.100
 so-called pyramidal circuitry for the aficionados.

44:30.100 --> 44:32.940
 In addition, you sometimes see in males

44:32.940 --> 44:34.460
 that take these drugs,

44:34.460 --> 44:37.920
 drugs like haloperidol and the other dopamine blockers,

44:37.920 --> 44:41.060
 that they actually develop breast tissue, gynecomastia.

44:41.060 --> 44:43.500
 So the development of male breast tissue

44:43.500 --> 44:46.140
 is because of the elevated levels of prolactin

44:46.140 --> 44:48.540
 because they're suppressing their dopamine so much.

44:48.540 --> 44:50.060
 Now that's a really extreme case,

44:50.060 --> 44:53.740
 but maybe perhaps if you see somebody

44:53.740 --> 44:56.100
 engaging in these very strange kind of face writhing

44:56.100 --> 44:57.700
 and body writhing behaviors,

44:57.700 --> 45:00.060
 that's actually not a consequence of their mental illness,

45:00.060 --> 45:03.180
 that's a consequence most often of the drugs

45:03.180 --> 45:04.980
 that they're taking to treat the mental illness,

45:04.980 --> 45:07.060
 those are side effects of those drugs.

45:07.060 --> 45:08.860
 Now prolactin is increased

45:08.860 --> 45:12.340
 anytime we have some really heightened, intense experience.

45:12.340 --> 45:15.740
 It's not just released after sex and reproduction.

45:15.740 --> 45:19.260
 Prolactin is released after some major event.

45:19.260 --> 45:20.820
 It's actually responsible,

45:20.820 --> 45:24.440
 it's thought for some of postpartum depression

45:24.440 --> 45:27.140
 for different types of kind of the letdown, the low.

45:27.140 --> 45:30.100
 I can distinctly remember that after finals

45:31.020 --> 45:33.340
 or after publishing a big paper,

45:33.340 --> 45:34.740
 I would be very, very happy,

45:34.740 --> 45:37.740
 but then I'd find that, oh, like what next?

45:37.740 --> 45:40.300
 Or things might seem a little bit dimmed or dulled out

45:40.300 --> 45:42.560
 for the next day or so, or the following week.

45:42.560 --> 45:43.940
 The timescales on these are going to vary

45:43.940 --> 45:45.900
 because some people release a lot of dopamine

45:45.900 --> 45:48.620
 for a very long time in response to something great.

45:48.620 --> 45:51.660
 And other people have a quick inflection of dopamine

45:51.660 --> 45:53.360
 and then they're back to feeling not so great.

45:53.360 --> 45:55.440
 It really varies from person to person.

45:55.440 --> 45:57.680
 In fact, long ago,

45:57.680 --> 45:59.820
 as I learned about dopamine reward circuitry

45:59.820 --> 46:02.860
 and the relationship between dopamine and prolactin,

46:02.860 --> 46:04.260
 I started to leverage this.

46:04.260 --> 46:07.060
 Believe it or not, after some major event,

46:07.060 --> 46:11.860
 I would take a couple hundred milligrams of vitamin B6.

46:11.860 --> 46:14.020
 I think for people who have diabetic neuropathy,

46:14.020 --> 46:16.140
 you need to be careful with vitamin B6,

46:16.140 --> 46:17.060
 check with your doctor.

46:17.060 --> 46:19.860
 I was told, although I haven't found the literature on this

46:19.860 --> 46:24.020
 that it can, in some cases, exacerbate peripheral neuropathy.

46:24.020 --> 46:28.320
 But for most people, it's thought to be reasonably safe,

46:28.320 --> 46:31.000
 but again, always check with your physician.

46:31.000 --> 46:34.220
 But I would take some B6 to kind of offset some of that low.

46:34.220 --> 46:36.080
 And actually, I don't know if it was subjective or not,

46:36.080 --> 46:40.300
 but it seemed to have somewhat of a positive effect.

46:40.300 --> 46:43.060
 I also started just internalizing the fact

46:43.060 --> 46:44.900
 that dopamine is so subjective.

46:44.900 --> 46:47.200
 There are objective aspects to dopamine

46:47.200 --> 46:48.500
 and how much is released,

46:48.500 --> 46:51.500
 but there's also some subjective effects to dopamine.

46:51.500 --> 46:53.580
 And so one of the things that you can do

46:53.580 --> 46:56.180
 in order to generally just be a happier person,

46:56.180 --> 46:58.700
 especially if you're a person in pursuit of long-term goals

46:58.700 --> 47:02.900
 of any kind, is the longer that you can extend

47:02.900 --> 47:05.660
 that positive phase of the dopamine release

47:05.660 --> 47:09.460
 and the more that you can blunt the pain response to that,

47:09.460 --> 47:11.460
 the better, and you can actually do this cognitively.

47:11.460 --> 47:14.740
 I used to joke with my lab that when we'd publish a paper,

47:14.740 --> 47:16.340
 I would get really excited,

47:16.340 --> 47:18.660
 but I wouldn't allow myself to get too excited.

47:18.660 --> 47:19.820
 What I wanted to do instead,

47:19.820 --> 47:23.100
 and what I've still tried to do is try and extend the arc

47:23.100 --> 47:25.840
 of that positive experience as long as I possibly can,

47:25.840 --> 47:27.880
 simply by thinking back like, oh, that was really cool.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.260
 I really enjoyed doing that work.

47:29.260 --> 47:31.500
 I really enjoyed the discovery.

47:31.500 --> 47:33.280
 I really enjoyed doing that with the people

47:33.280 --> 47:35.480
 that I was working with at the time.

47:35.480 --> 47:37.060
 What a pleasure that was.

47:37.060 --> 47:39.240
 I can get this very easily from pictures of people

47:39.240 --> 47:41.680
 and things like Costello that I really enjoy,

47:41.680 --> 47:42.940
 trips that I've taken.

47:42.940 --> 47:45.560
 So you can extend pleasure without having to engage

47:45.560 --> 47:47.540
 in the behavior over and over.

47:47.540 --> 47:50.300
 That's extending the arc of that dopamine release.

47:50.300 --> 47:52.660
 As well, it offsets some of the pain

47:52.660 --> 47:55.880
 of not having that experience occur

47:55.880 --> 47:57.460
 over and over and over again.

47:57.460 --> 47:59.020
 Now, for the high performers out there,

47:59.020 --> 48:00.600
 you're probably familiar with this.

48:00.600 --> 48:02.340
 Many people who have a big achievement,

48:02.340 --> 48:04.260
 their first thoughts are, well, now what?

48:04.260 --> 48:05.220
 What am I going to do next?

48:05.220 --> 48:06.420
 How am I ever going to exceed that?

48:06.420 --> 48:09.020
 And indeed, many people who are very high

48:09.020 --> 48:10.700
 on this kind of dopamine sensation

48:10.700 --> 48:13.780
 and novelty-seeking scale are prone to addiction.

48:13.780 --> 48:16.620
 They're prone to the rabid pursuit of external goals,

48:16.620 --> 48:20.200
 of exteroception, to the neglect of these internal mechanisms

48:20.200 --> 48:22.260
 that allow them to feel calm and happy.

48:22.260 --> 48:25.240
 So for people that are very driven, very motivated,

48:26.320 --> 48:28.460
 adopting a practice of being able to engage

48:28.460 --> 48:31.000
 in the here and now, the sort of almond-type practices

48:31.000 --> 48:34.860
 we talked about earlier, of learning how to achieve

48:34.860 --> 48:37.200
 a really good night's sleep on a regular basis

48:37.200 --> 48:38.780
 through tools and mechanisms

48:38.780 --> 48:40.560
 I talked about in previous podcasts,

48:40.560 --> 48:44.380
 gives a sort of balance to the pleasure-seeking

48:44.380 --> 48:47.840
 and offsetting of pain and the pleasure in the here and now.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.500
 So pleasure is really two things.

48:49.500 --> 48:52.540
 It's a joy in pursuit,

48:52.540 --> 48:55.560
 but it's also the joy in what you have.

48:55.560 --> 48:58.860
 And there's a beautiful model of emotional development

48:58.860 --> 49:00.540
 that was developed by Alan Shore,

49:00.540 --> 49:02.640
 a professor at UCLA and psychiatrist,

49:02.640 --> 49:04.840
 that talks about some of the basics

49:04.840 --> 49:07.600
 of good infant parent attachment,

49:07.600 --> 49:09.700
 where good parenting that leads

49:09.700 --> 49:14.100
 to healthy adult relationships and emotion regulation

49:14.100 --> 49:16.240
 tends to include both sides

49:16.240 --> 49:19.480
 of this dopamine serotonin spectrum.

49:19.480 --> 49:21.820
 You talk about the relationship between child

49:21.820 --> 49:24.820
 and parent typically was the mother, but also father,

49:24.820 --> 49:27.340
 where you can get the child really excited

49:27.340 --> 49:29.080
 by kind of squealing and ramping them up

49:29.080 --> 49:31.320
 or talking about something or ice cream or play,

49:31.320 --> 49:32.720
 and the kid gets very excited.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.080
 That's the dopaminergic system,

49:34.080 --> 49:36.600
 the anticipation of something that's coming,

49:36.600 --> 49:39.000
 but as well engaging with children

49:39.000 --> 49:40.500
 in a way that's really about everything

49:40.500 --> 49:42.120
 that you have right in the here and now,

49:42.120 --> 49:43.620
 the reading of the book,

49:43.620 --> 49:46.900
 the kids always seem to ask one more time, one more,

49:46.900 --> 49:49.000
 they seem to want more of the things that they enjoy,

49:49.000 --> 49:51.300
 but really engaging with them

49:51.300 --> 49:54.080
 in a way that increases their sense of pleasure

49:54.080 --> 49:55.460
 for what's right there,

49:55.460 --> 49:57.000
 as well as giving them a lot of things

49:57.000 --> 50:00.360
 to be excited about and positive anticipation.

50:00.360 --> 50:04.000
 Now, having worked years ago with at-risk kids

50:04.000 --> 50:05.900
 and also with young kids at summer camps

50:05.900 --> 50:06.920
 and things like that,

50:06.920 --> 50:08.200
 one of the things that you learn

50:08.200 --> 50:11.500
 is you never say maybe to a kid about a reward.

50:11.500 --> 50:13.480
 If you say we might have ice cream later,

50:13.480 --> 50:16.000
 you are essentially saying we are having ice cream.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.400
 They don't hear the maybe part.

50:17.400 --> 50:19.880
 And it turns out adults don't either.

50:19.880 --> 50:20.720
 It's really interesting.

50:20.720 --> 50:22.940
 There's something called reward prediction error.

50:22.940 --> 50:24.080
 I've talked about this before,

50:24.080 --> 50:26.160
 but I haven't really talked about it deeply

50:26.160 --> 50:28.300
 in the context of the dopamine system.

50:28.300 --> 50:31.240
 Dopamine, as I've said, is involved in anticipation

50:31.240 --> 50:33.400
 of wanting, not of having.

50:33.400 --> 50:36.360
 It's involved in motivation toward the thing that you want.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.360
 And it biases us towards action.

50:39.420 --> 50:42.640
 Reward prediction error equals the actual amount of dopamine

50:42.640 --> 50:44.480
 that's released in response to something

50:44.480 --> 50:48.160
 versus minus the amount that's expected, okay?

50:48.160 --> 50:51.480
 So if you tell a kid we might have ice cream,

50:51.480 --> 50:54.520
 they hear we're going to have ice cream and they expect it.

50:54.520 --> 50:56.280
 And if you later say,

50:56.280 --> 50:58.280
 well, we're not going to have ice cream,

50:58.280 --> 50:59.640
 and I said maybe,

50:59.640 --> 51:00.660
 that's actually going to lead

51:00.660 --> 51:03.680
 to a much bigger crash in dopamine.

51:03.680 --> 51:07.540
 It's going to lead to a negative signal, a punishment signal.

51:07.540 --> 51:09.760
 It's literally going to feel like pain.

51:09.760 --> 51:12.260
 So kids, you can leverage this.

51:12.260 --> 51:13.500
 If your parents say maybe,

51:13.500 --> 51:16.660
 they're effectively telling your dopamine system absolutely.

51:16.660 --> 51:18.160
 Now, adults are like this too.

51:18.160 --> 51:21.760
 If we think something might happen and it doesn't happen,

51:21.760 --> 51:25.440
 there's a big crash in our affect, in our emotionality.

51:25.440 --> 51:26.960
 And that's because that dopamine system

51:26.960 --> 51:29.600
 goes from firing about three to four times per second

51:29.600 --> 51:31.920
 to about 10 or 15 times per second

51:31.920 --> 51:34.660
 in the possibility that something might happen.

51:34.660 --> 51:37.760
 Possibility is deeply woven into our biology

51:37.760 --> 51:40.120
 of the dopamine and motivation system

51:40.120 --> 51:43.320
 as a way for us presumably in ancient times

51:43.320 --> 51:44.940
 to explore novel territories

51:44.940 --> 51:46.920
 and get a sense that maybe there's water there.

51:46.920 --> 51:48.360
 Maybe there are mates there.

51:48.360 --> 51:49.640
 Maybe there's better food there.

51:49.640 --> 51:51.440
 Maybe there's resources there.

51:51.440 --> 51:55.860
 The maybe is an important thing that in language terms,

51:55.860 --> 51:59.360
 maybe means maybe, but in neurobiological terms,

51:59.360 --> 52:02.500
 maybe means perhaps there's going to be the surprise

52:02.500 --> 52:04.800
 of an even bigger dopamine reward.

52:04.800 --> 52:06.360
 And the one thing dopamine loves

52:06.360 --> 52:09.520
 more than anything else is surprise.

52:09.520 --> 52:12.200
 When we get something positive, we go to the mailbox,

52:12.200 --> 52:14.120
 we're expecting some bills and you open it up

52:14.120 --> 52:15.400
 and you get a letter from somebody

52:15.400 --> 52:16.920
 you haven't thought about in a long time

52:16.920 --> 52:21.280
 and you adore that person, that's a huge dopamine release.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.800
 It actually triggers neuroplasticity.

52:22.800 --> 52:24.040
 You probably never forget that

52:24.040 --> 52:27.480
 because of the way that dopamine gates plasticity.

52:27.480 --> 52:32.160
 When we get a surprise of something that we didn't want,

52:32.160 --> 52:34.520
 also it creates plasticity.

52:34.520 --> 52:38.080
 So the surprise, novelty, motivation and reward,

52:38.080 --> 52:41.440
 they're all woven into this package that we call dopamine.

52:41.440 --> 52:44.520
 And the cool thing is you can actually regulate

52:44.520 --> 52:48.800
 this whole system in a way that will steer you

52:48.800 --> 52:51.560
 or lean you towards more positive anticipation

52:51.560 --> 52:53.560
 of things in life and less disappointment.

52:53.560 --> 52:55.120
 It's simply a matter of adjusting

52:55.120 --> 52:57.560
 what we call the dopamine schedule.

52:57.560 --> 52:59.960
 Okay, a couple of things before we continue.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.720
 We're going to talk about attention deficit

53:01.720 --> 53:03.280
 in a few minutes, but before that,

53:03.280 --> 53:04.520
 I want to talk about something

53:04.520 --> 53:07.340
 that I've mentioned before in previous podcasts,

53:07.340 --> 53:10.360
 but that you may not be aware of.

53:10.360 --> 53:13.760
 And if you're aware of, you may still be doing,

53:13.760 --> 53:18.160
 which is severely injuring your ability to release dopamine.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.660
 It's creating a sense of disappointment

53:20.660 --> 53:23.160
 in ways that are most likely hurting you

53:23.160 --> 53:24.240
 mentally and physically.

53:24.240 --> 53:27.460
 And that's the blunting of dopamine

53:28.360 --> 53:30.400
 by viewing light in the middle of the night.

53:30.400 --> 53:31.800
 I realize this is not a discussion

53:31.800 --> 53:33.200
 about sleep and circadian rhythms,

53:33.200 --> 53:35.440
 but the data now are so strong showing

53:35.440 --> 53:40.320
 that viewing bright light from about 10 PM to 4 AM

53:40.320 --> 53:42.640
 too often triggers activation

53:42.640 --> 53:44.940
 of this circuit called the habenula.

53:44.940 --> 53:47.280
 So this is I, it goes from your retina

53:47.280 --> 53:51.080
 to a structure called the habenula, H-A-B-E-N-U-L-A.

53:51.080 --> 53:53.960
 Then from the habenula to some of this reward circuitry

53:53.960 --> 53:57.280
 and it suppresses the activation of the reward circuitry,

53:57.280 --> 53:58.800
 not just in that moment,

53:58.800 --> 54:00.360
 but to things that you normally

54:00.360 --> 54:02.960
 positively anticipate and pursue.

54:02.960 --> 54:04.160
 And the reason I'm bringing this up now

54:04.160 --> 54:05.560
 is because I haven't really gone into depth

54:05.560 --> 54:06.720
 on the dopamine system before.

54:06.720 --> 54:09.780
 Now you understand you have this very precious reward system

54:09.780 --> 54:11.860
 that's kind of a double-edged sword.

54:11.860 --> 54:14.320
 It needs to be taken care of and treated well.

54:14.320 --> 54:17.440
 You want to use it, but not overuse it, et cetera.

54:17.440 --> 54:20.240
 But getting bright light exposure in the middle of the night

54:20.240 --> 54:23.160
 is reducing your capacity to release dopamine.

54:23.160 --> 54:24.440
 So it's not just about the sleep

54:24.440 --> 54:25.760
 that you're not getting in that time.

54:25.760 --> 54:28.960
 It's also that you're not getting the dopamine

54:28.960 --> 54:31.220
 that would otherwise be available to you.

54:31.220 --> 54:32.680
 So you're actually taking,

54:32.680 --> 54:34.560
 think of light in the middle of the night

54:34.560 --> 54:36.000
 as a kind of antagonist,

54:36.000 --> 54:37.880
 as kind of a blocker of dopamine.

54:37.880 --> 54:39.240
 Maybe that'll help you.

54:39.240 --> 54:40.340
 If you're somebody who has to work

54:40.340 --> 54:41.280
 in the middle of the night

54:41.280 --> 54:43.980
 and you want to bypass this dopamine suppression,

54:43.980 --> 54:46.480
 please see the episode about jet lag and shift work

54:46.480 --> 54:47.560
 because there are a lot of tips there

54:47.560 --> 54:49.000
 that will allow you to do that.

54:49.000 --> 54:51.640
 In order to understand how to control the dopamine system,

54:51.640 --> 54:53.940
 how to leverage it for a better life,

54:55.140 --> 54:56.720
 you need to understand the results

54:56.720 --> 54:58.480
 of a very important experiment.

54:59.640 --> 55:03.640
 This experiment was able to separate pleasure

55:03.640 --> 55:05.000
 from motivation.

55:05.000 --> 55:08.560
 It's a very simple, but like many simple experiments,

55:08.560 --> 55:10.860
 a very elegant experiment.

55:10.860 --> 55:11.700
 What they did,

55:11.700 --> 55:14.280
 and this has now been done in animals and in humans,

55:15.080 --> 55:17.200
 they offered rats food.

55:17.200 --> 55:19.640
 It was a food that they particularly liked

55:19.640 --> 55:22.380
 and the animals would lever press for a pellet of food,

55:22.380 --> 55:23.680
 kind of classic experiment.

55:23.680 --> 55:27.000
 They'd eat the food and they presumably liked the food

55:27.000 --> 55:30.080
 because they were motivated to press the lever and eat it.

55:30.080 --> 55:31.040
 Great.

55:31.040 --> 55:32.440
 They took other rats.

55:33.920 --> 55:35.780
 They eliminated the dopamine neurons.

55:35.780 --> 55:37.800
 You can do this by injection of a neurotoxin

55:37.800 --> 55:39.540
 that destroys these neurons.

55:39.540 --> 55:41.800
 So they actually had no dopamine in their brain.

55:41.800 --> 55:44.360
 They have no ability to release dopamine

55:44.360 --> 55:46.800
 and they gave them a lever.

55:46.800 --> 55:48.480
 The rats would sit there and they'd hit the lever

55:48.480 --> 55:49.400
 and they'd eat the food.

55:49.400 --> 55:51.680
 They're still enjoyed the food.

55:52.680 --> 55:53.580
 So you say, well, okay,

55:53.580 --> 55:55.480
 so dopamine isn't involved in motivation

55:55.480 --> 55:56.840
 and it isn't involved in pleasure.

55:56.840 --> 55:58.880
 No, it absolutely is.

55:58.880 --> 56:01.120
 They could still enjoy the food,

56:01.120 --> 56:04.860
 but if they moved the rat literally one body length

56:04.860 --> 56:06.600
 away from the lever,

56:06.600 --> 56:08.680
 what they found was the animals that had dopamine

56:08.680 --> 56:10.760
 would move over to the lever, press it and eat.

56:10.760 --> 56:11.720
 And the ones,

56:11.720 --> 56:14.580
 the rats that did not have dopamine available to them

56:14.580 --> 56:17.460
 wouldn't even move one body length,

56:17.460 --> 56:20.940
 one rat length to the lever in order to press it

56:20.940 --> 56:22.020
 and get the food.

56:22.020 --> 56:25.100
 Dopamine therefore is not about the ability

56:25.100 --> 56:26.780
 to experience pleasure.

56:26.780 --> 56:29.820
 It is about motivation for pleasure.

56:29.820 --> 56:31.780
 This has been repeated in humans

56:31.780 --> 56:33.740
 in a variety of different scenarios.

56:33.740 --> 56:36.700
 You can't really do the lever press thing quite as easily,

56:37.700 --> 56:40.820
 but we know that people have low levels of dopamine

56:40.820 --> 56:42.620
 are simply less motivated

56:42.620 --> 56:44.460
 even though they can achieve pleasure.

56:44.460 --> 56:46.780
 And this has serious ramifications

56:46.780 --> 56:51.380
 for the fact that now quote unquote pleasure

56:51.380 --> 56:55.660
 or ways to induce things that we believe give us pleasure

56:55.660 --> 56:57.500
 are everywhere and they're within reach.

56:57.500 --> 56:59.000
 We don't have to forage for our food.

56:59.000 --> 57:03.740
 There's a lot of highly processed, high sugar, high fat foods.

57:03.740 --> 57:06.100
 There's also foods that are healthy that tastes good,

57:06.100 --> 57:08.320
 but they're, and hopefully they're pretty easy to get

57:08.320 --> 57:09.540
 although that different people

57:09.540 --> 57:11.840
 have different access to things of course.

57:11.840 --> 57:15.420
 But dopamine isn't about the ability to experience pleasure.

57:15.420 --> 57:19.420
 It's about how motivated you are to reach those pleasures.

57:19.420 --> 57:21.500
 And so many of you are probably thinking,

57:21.500 --> 57:23.420
 wow, I'm not a very motivated person.

57:23.420 --> 57:25.260
 Like you talked about the one kind of procrastination

57:25.260 --> 57:28.900
 earlier, what about when I just feel kind of meh about life?

57:28.900 --> 57:31.760
 Now, for some of you, there may be a real clinical depression

57:31.760 --> 57:33.200
 and you should talk to a professional.

57:33.200 --> 57:35.680
 There are very good prescription drugs

57:35.680 --> 57:37.380
 that can really help people.

57:37.380 --> 57:41.520
 There's also great non-drug treatments of psychotherapy

57:41.520 --> 57:43.820
 and other treatments that are being developed

57:43.820 --> 57:45.020
 in addition to psychotherapy

57:45.020 --> 57:47.600
 and the various kinds of psychoanalysis, et cetera,

57:47.600 --> 57:48.860
 that one can use.

57:48.860 --> 57:50.380
 I think the data really points to the fact

57:50.380 --> 57:52.940
 that a combination of pharmacology

57:52.940 --> 57:55.700
 and talk therapies are generally best.

57:55.700 --> 57:57.260
 And there are a huge range of these things.

57:57.260 --> 57:58.820
 I know many of you are in these professions.

57:58.820 --> 58:00.620
 We're not going to talk about that right now.

58:00.620 --> 58:02.620
 There is a compound that's kind of interesting

58:02.620 --> 58:06.580
 in the supplement space that isn't Macuna purines L-DOPA.

58:06.580 --> 58:08.540
 It's not L-tyrosine

58:08.540 --> 58:12.540
 that isn't promoting massive releases of dopamine

58:12.540 --> 58:14.420
 or even dopamine alone,

58:14.420 --> 58:17.020
 but a combination of dopamine and serotonin.

58:17.020 --> 58:18.780
 And it's an intriguing molecule.

58:18.780 --> 58:20.460
 It's sold over the counter.

58:20.460 --> 58:24.060
 Again, you have to check with your healthcare provider

58:24.060 --> 58:26.080
 before you would take anything or remove anything.

58:26.080 --> 58:27.180
 That's very important.

58:28.300 --> 58:33.300
 But it's phenylethylamine or PEA.

58:33.300 --> 58:38.300
 PEA or beta phenylethylamine releases dopamine

58:42.100 --> 58:44.620
 at low levels, but also serotonin at low levels.

58:44.620 --> 58:48.540
 So it's kind of a cocktail of the motivation molecules

58:48.540 --> 58:51.700
 as well as the quote unquote here and now molecules.

58:51.700 --> 58:55.600
 And people's response to this varies widely,

58:55.600 --> 58:58.800
 but many people report feeling heightened sense

58:58.800 --> 59:01.220
 of mental acuity, wellbeing, et cetera.

59:01.220 --> 59:03.540
 It is a bit of a stimulant like anything

59:03.540 --> 59:04.540
 that triggers activation,

59:04.540 --> 59:06.740
 the dopamine and norepinephrine pathway,

59:06.740 --> 59:08.080
 but it is an interesting supplement.

59:08.080 --> 59:10.620
 I actually haven't tried it before.

59:10.620 --> 59:12.260
 So I can't report on my own experiences.

59:12.260 --> 59:15.940
 I will point you however, to examine.com.

59:15.940 --> 59:17.920
 It wouldn't be a Huberman Lab podcast episode

59:17.920 --> 59:19.420
 if I didn't point you to examine.com,

59:19.420 --> 59:21.180
 this incredible free resource

59:21.180 --> 59:23.000
 where you can put in any supplement

59:23.000 --> 59:25.460
 and it will tell you the quote unquote human effect matrix.

59:25.460 --> 59:27.200
 It'll point you to the various studies.

59:27.200 --> 59:28.980
 We always provide a link to this in the caption.

59:28.980 --> 59:30.660
 It's an amazing resource.

59:30.660 --> 59:32.860
 So you can go there to explore more,

59:32.860 --> 59:37.860
 but I haven't talked about beta-phenyl ethyl amine before

59:37.940 --> 59:39.020
 in previous podcasts.

59:39.020 --> 59:41.900
 And I wanted to add it to the list of things

59:41.900 --> 59:46.020
 that tap into the dopamine system that are in this,

59:46.020 --> 59:49.280
 I guess we call it now the supplementation space.

59:49.280 --> 59:52.340
 I personally am fascinated by these supplements

59:52.340 --> 59:54.180
 and the things that exist out there

59:54.180 --> 59:57.360
 that are non-prescription that seem to,

59:57.360 --> 1:00:00.300
 at least in some people have positive effects.

1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:01.400
 For instance, last episode,

1:00:01.400 --> 1:00:03.340
 we talked about acetyl-l-carnitine,

1:00:03.340 --> 1:00:05.320
 which there are several papers

1:00:05.320 --> 1:00:06.880
 that report antidepressant effects,

1:00:06.880 --> 1:00:08.960
 as well as positive effects on other things,

1:00:08.960 --> 1:00:12.020
 sperm health, ovarian health, et cetera.

1:00:12.020 --> 1:00:15.660
 I learned from a colleague that acetyl-l-carnitine in Europe

1:00:15.660 --> 1:00:16.920
 is actually a prescription drug.

1:00:16.920 --> 1:00:19.140
 In the US, it's sold over the counter.

1:00:19.140 --> 1:00:20.860
 So I guess, depending on where you're listening to this,

1:00:20.860 --> 1:00:22.780
 the availability might vary.

1:00:22.780 --> 1:00:24.280
 And as always, I put the caveat,

1:00:24.280 --> 1:00:25.780
 you have to check with your healthcare provider

1:00:25.780 --> 1:00:26.600
 if it's right for you,

1:00:26.600 --> 1:00:29.900
 but I'm fascinated by the fact that these things exist

1:00:29.900 --> 1:00:33.540
 and that they lie somewhere between prescription drugs

1:00:33.540 --> 1:00:34.780
 and doing nothing.

1:00:34.780 --> 1:00:37.040
 And that makes them interesting compounds.

1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:40.960
 And I think that PEA, beta-phenylethylamine,

1:00:40.960 --> 1:00:44.500
 is yet another one of such compounds.

1:00:46.380 --> 1:00:48.620
 I'm going to talk a lot about attention deficit

1:00:48.620 --> 1:00:50.860
 and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

1:00:50.860 --> 1:00:52.220
 in a future episode,

1:00:52.220 --> 1:00:53.600
 but I do want to mention it today

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:57.020
 in the context of dopamine and impulsivity.

1:00:57.020 --> 1:01:01.820
 So ADHD or ADD, so attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

1:01:01.820 --> 1:01:03.740
 ADD, are clinical diagnoses.

1:01:03.740 --> 1:01:06.180
 I think a lot of people nowadays walk around and say,

1:01:06.180 --> 1:01:08.980
 I have ADD or you have ADD.

1:01:08.980 --> 1:01:12.380
 And indeed, one can create a sort of ADD

1:01:12.380 --> 1:01:14.780
 by attention switching all the time.

1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:16.600
 I'm a big fan of Cal Newport.

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:18.500
 He wrote the book, Deep Work.

1:01:18.500 --> 1:01:20.540
 I believe he was the one who said,

1:01:20.540 --> 1:01:22.980
 context switching is terrible for the brain.

1:01:22.980 --> 1:01:24.620
 It's like the worst thing for the brain

1:01:24.620 --> 1:01:27.300
 because then the brain learns to context switch

1:01:27.300 --> 1:01:31.180
 and real deep work, productivity, learning of all kinds,

1:01:31.180 --> 1:01:32.560
 good relationships of all kinds

1:01:32.560 --> 1:01:34.380
 really come from depth of experience,

1:01:34.380 --> 1:01:38.320
 not from breadth of experience within the moment.

1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:40.780
 And so I think it's important to know

1:01:40.780 --> 1:01:43.420
 that there's clinical ADHD and ADD,

1:01:43.420 --> 1:01:46.820
 and then there's the kind that people are kind of inducing

1:01:46.820 --> 1:01:50.020
 and through distraction and social media

1:01:50.020 --> 1:01:51.500
 and phones, et cetera.

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:56.500
 And those can sometimes lead to clinical ADHD and ADD.

1:01:57.040 --> 1:02:01.900
 But I want to talk about ADHD and ADD in kids just briefly.

1:02:01.900 --> 1:02:04.020
 The drugs that are normally given

1:02:04.020 --> 1:02:08.220
 to treat those conditions, ADHD and ADD,

1:02:08.220 --> 1:02:09.780
 are things like Adderall,

1:02:09.780 --> 1:02:12.600
 things that have very amphetamine-like qualities

1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:13.660
 and structures.

1:02:13.660 --> 1:02:17.540
 And you might ask, why would they do that?

1:02:17.540 --> 1:02:20.040
 Well, it turns out that in kids,

1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:22.660
 these activate that forebrain circuitry,

1:02:22.660 --> 1:02:27.500
 the break that exists on the deeper mesolimbic circuitry.

1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:29.740
 So as you recall, there's the VTA and nucleus accumbens,

1:02:29.740 --> 1:02:31.620
 that's the kind of accelerators on dopamine.

1:02:31.620 --> 1:02:32.940
 And then there's the prefrontal cortex,

1:02:32.940 --> 1:02:36.140
 which acts as a break and can limit impulsivity.

1:02:36.140 --> 1:02:39.260
 And those drugs tend to increase the activity of neurons

1:02:39.260 --> 1:02:41.460
 in that pathway, the prefrontal cortex,

1:02:41.460 --> 1:02:42.920
 and it reduces impulsivity.

1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:45.480
 In fact, there's a experiment described

1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:46.820
 in the book, The Molecule of More,

1:02:46.820 --> 1:02:48.180
 which is really interesting,

1:02:48.180 --> 1:02:51.700
 where they looked at impulsivity in obese children.

1:02:51.700 --> 1:02:55.420
 And it turns out, they did this experiment in a safe way,

1:02:55.420 --> 1:02:58.120
 that they looked at kids,

1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:00.140
 both obese kids and non-obese kids,

1:03:00.140 --> 1:03:03.700
 and their willingness to cross a very busy highway.

1:03:03.700 --> 1:03:06.420
 And it turns out that the obese kids got hit by cars

1:03:06.420 --> 1:03:09.620
 more often than non-obese children.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:11.900
 It turns out this was a virtual reality experiment.

1:03:11.900 --> 1:03:13.060
 And it had nothing to do with the fact

1:03:13.060 --> 1:03:15.520
 that they were obese or limitations on movement

1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:16.660
 or speed of movement.

1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:18.900
 It was that the obese children were more impulsive

1:03:18.900 --> 1:03:20.120
 in a variety of contexts,

1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:22.660
 not just in this virtual crossing the street thing.

1:03:22.660 --> 1:03:25.540
 And it turns out, the data points to the fact

1:03:25.540 --> 1:03:29.180
 that impulsivity at age 10 is actually predictive

1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:32.940
 of overeating disorders at a later stage in life.

1:03:32.940 --> 1:03:35.140
 So some of these drugs that are designed

1:03:35.140 --> 1:03:38.440
 to create heightened activity in the braking system,

1:03:38.440 --> 1:03:42.140
 the decelerator of the reward pathway,

1:03:42.140 --> 1:03:44.060
 are designed to reduce impulsivity

1:03:44.060 --> 1:03:46.340
 because they suppress the release of dopamine,

1:03:46.340 --> 1:03:50.020
 and they allow, hopefully, they allow children,

1:03:50.020 --> 1:03:52.140
 and when they become adults,

1:03:52.140 --> 1:03:55.700
 to better control the schedule of dopamine release.

1:03:55.700 --> 1:03:57.880
 So now let's talk about what is a dopamine schedule

1:03:57.880 --> 1:04:00.000
 and how you can leverage this

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.900
 in order to have heightened levels of motivation,

1:04:02.900 --> 1:04:05.140
 but not get so much dopamine that you're experiencing

1:04:05.140 --> 1:04:06.540
 or crash afterwards,

1:04:06.540 --> 1:04:09.100
 and also so that you can experience heightened pleasure

1:04:09.100 --> 1:04:12.520
 from the various pursuits that you are engaged in in life.

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.500
 I know many of you are interested in tools

1:04:15.500 --> 1:04:18.020
 that will allow you to be more motivated,

1:04:18.020 --> 1:04:21.080
 to focus longer, sleep better.

1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:23.500
 That's really what the Huberman Lab Podcast is all about,

1:04:23.500 --> 1:04:26.100
 but always framed in the context

1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:30.420
 of neurobiological principles and objective mechanisms.

1:04:30.420 --> 1:04:32.580
 There are some tools that we can apply

1:04:32.580 --> 1:04:35.360
 to the dopamine system and motivation

1:04:35.360 --> 1:04:37.260
 that can really improve our ability

1:04:37.260 --> 1:04:39.260
 to stay in pursuit of things,

1:04:39.260 --> 1:04:42.940
 as well as enjoy things after we've achieved our goals,

1:04:42.940 --> 1:04:45.300
 or even en route to our goals.

1:04:45.300 --> 1:04:47.020
 And here's the key principle.

1:04:48.260 --> 1:04:51.100
 Dopamine is very subjective,

1:04:51.100 --> 1:04:53.340
 meaning you can either allow yourself

1:04:53.340 --> 1:04:56.240
 to experience the pleasure of reaching a milestone,

1:04:56.240 --> 1:05:00.700
 of achieving or some craving or not.

1:05:00.700 --> 1:05:03.940
 Now that won't work in the extreme cases of drugs

1:05:03.940 --> 1:05:05.620
 like cocaine and amphetamine,

1:05:05.620 --> 1:05:07.620
 but it's actually pretty powerful

1:05:07.620 --> 1:05:10.460
 what one can do with the subjective system.

1:05:10.460 --> 1:05:12.500
 In fact, I'm going to describe to you an experiment

1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:16.140
 that highlights just how powerful the subjective readout

1:05:16.140 --> 1:05:17.940
 or the subjective interpretation

1:05:17.940 --> 1:05:19.560
 of a given experience really can be,

1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:22.180
 even at the level of pharmacology.

1:05:22.180 --> 1:05:24.820
 I love examples of subjective effects

1:05:24.820 --> 1:05:27.520
 over things that would otherwise seem hardwired,

1:05:27.520 --> 1:05:30.180
 because they really illustrate the interplay

1:05:30.180 --> 1:05:33.700
 between our cognition, our belief system,

1:05:33.700 --> 1:05:36.500
 and what would otherwise be these,

1:05:36.500 --> 1:05:39.420
 just plug and chug kind of mechanisms of,

1:05:39.420 --> 1:05:41.180
 you eat X amount of chocolate,

1:05:41.180 --> 1:05:43.100
 or you drink X amount of water

1:05:43.100 --> 1:05:45.560
 after being water deprived for a certain amount of time,

1:05:45.560 --> 1:05:47.140
 and you get X amount of dopamine.

1:05:47.140 --> 1:05:48.460
 Here's the experiment.

1:05:48.460 --> 1:05:52.660
 The experiment was just published on March 18th, 2021,

1:05:52.660 --> 1:05:53.860
 so very recently.

1:05:53.860 --> 1:05:55.340
 And the title of the experiment

1:05:55.340 --> 1:05:58.240
 is expectation for stimulant type,

1:05:58.240 --> 1:06:01.940
 modifies caffeine's effects on mood and cognition.

1:06:01.940 --> 1:06:03.380
 This was done in college students.

1:06:03.380 --> 1:06:05.280
 It's a fascinating study.

1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:09.940
 What they did is they gave college students

1:06:09.940 --> 1:06:13.620
 either placebo, essentially nothing,

1:06:13.620 --> 1:06:15.400
 or 200 milligrams of caffeine.

1:06:15.400 --> 1:06:18.620
 200 milligrams of caffeine is about what's in,

1:06:18.620 --> 1:06:20.580
 well, a typical coffee,

1:06:20.580 --> 1:06:23.420
 like a medium coffee that you would buy, a drip coffee,

1:06:23.420 --> 1:06:25.280
 or a coffee that you'd make at home.

1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:26.460
 It's a fair amount of caffeine.

1:06:26.460 --> 1:06:27.900
 If you were to take it in pill form,

1:06:27.900 --> 1:06:29.540
 it would definitely make you feel more alert

1:06:29.540 --> 1:06:31.400
 unless you were one of those mutants,

1:06:31.400 --> 1:06:34.580
 literally mutants that is insensitive to caffeine.

1:06:34.580 --> 1:06:36.300
 And those mutants are pretty rare.

1:06:36.300 --> 1:06:38.740
 So they took 65 undergraduate students

1:06:38.740 --> 1:06:40.780
 in college.

1:06:40.780 --> 1:06:44.320
 They randomized them to either placebo or caffeine.

1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:45.840
 And they told them

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:49.280
 that they were either getting caffeine or Adderall.

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:51.560
 Now, Adderall cognitively

1:06:51.560 --> 1:06:55.440
 carries a very different expectation.

1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:56.880
 College students know Adderall

1:06:56.880 --> 1:06:59.420
 to be a much stronger stimulant than caffeine.

1:06:59.420 --> 1:07:01.720
 They know it to create a sort of high.

1:07:01.720 --> 1:07:03.480
 This is the way the students described it.

1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:06.680
 And they thought that it would increase their level of focus

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:08.380
 and their ability to perform work.

1:07:08.380 --> 1:07:09.480
 So what's really interesting

1:07:09.480 --> 1:07:12.280
 is there was definitely an effect

1:07:12.280 --> 1:07:13.660
 of placebo versus caffeine.

1:07:13.660 --> 1:07:15.360
 That's not surprising, however, right?

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:19.160
 You take a placebo, you may or may not feel more alert,

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:20.640
 but you take 200 milligrams of caffeine,

1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:22.340
 very likely you're going to feel very alert.

1:07:22.340 --> 1:07:24.640
 But there was also an effect

1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:26.320
 of whether or not the students

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:28.960
 thought they were getting caffeine or Adderall.

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:30.240
 The subjects receiving caffeine

1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:33.800
 reported feeling more stimulated, anxious, and motivated

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:36.200
 than the subjects that received the placebo, okay.

1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:38.160
 But the ones that expected Adderall

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:40.120
 reported stronger amphetamine effects.

1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:42.100
 So they felt much more high.

1:07:42.100 --> 1:07:45.360
 They performed better on a working memory test.

1:07:45.360 --> 1:07:46.920
 And in general,

1:07:46.920 --> 1:07:50.320
 they had all the increased cognitive effects

1:07:50.320 --> 1:07:52.400
 that would have been seen with Adderall,

1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:54.320
 but they were only ingesting caffeine.

1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:58.340
 And so this shows an interaction between the drug caffeine

1:07:58.340 --> 1:08:01.360
 and the expectation that it was Adderall.

1:08:01.360 --> 1:08:03.460
 So it led to heightened performance

1:08:03.460 --> 1:08:05.160
 simply because the students thought

1:08:05.160 --> 1:08:06.400
 they were getting Adderall.

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:08.160
 Now, I don't know whether or not

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:10.560
 they told them at the end that it wasn't Adderall.

1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:11.500
 I doubt that they did.

1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:13.500
 This, if you want to look it up,

1:08:13.500 --> 1:08:14.820
 this study was published

1:08:14.820 --> 1:08:19.160
 in the Journal of Experimental Clinical Psychopharmacology.

1:08:19.160 --> 1:08:23.240
 The paper is Looby et al, L-O-O-B-Y et al.

1:08:23.240 --> 1:08:26.400
 And again, it was just published March 18th, 2021.

1:08:26.400 --> 1:08:28.140
 Speaks to the fact that,

1:08:28.140 --> 1:08:30.440
 yes, there are so-called placebo effects,

1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:31.800
 but this is different than placebo.

1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:34.920
 This is a belief effect about what the specific reactions

1:08:34.920 --> 1:08:37.320
 to a given stimulant ought to be.

1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:38.720
 And I think this is very important

1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:40.620
 because I think that it points to the fact

1:08:40.620 --> 1:08:43.440
 that the top down,

1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:45.340
 the kind of higher level cognitive processes

1:08:45.340 --> 1:08:48.800
 are impacting even the most basic fundamental aspects

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:52.600
 of say dopamine release or adrenaline release

1:08:52.600 --> 1:08:53.480
 or epinephrine release

1:08:53.480 --> 1:08:56.180
 in ways that can positively impact performance.

1:08:56.180 --> 1:08:57.920
 In this case, it was a positive improvement

1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:00.000
 in working memory and focus.

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:01.480
 As long as we're talking about caffeine,

1:09:01.480 --> 1:09:04.400
 I'd like to point out a study that's really interesting.

1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:06.880
 This was published in Journal of Neuroscience,

1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:08.880
 which is the Society for Neurosciences

1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:10.240
 kind of flagship journal.

1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:11.080
 It's their journal.

1:09:11.080 --> 1:09:12.840
 It's a good journal.

1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:14.880
 And what they showed was that caffeine

1:09:14.880 --> 1:09:18.060
 can increase dopamine release in the brain by about 30%.

1:09:18.060 --> 1:09:18.920
 That wasn't surprising.

1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:21.000
 I even said that earlier.

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.120
 But what they also showed

1:09:23.120 --> 1:09:27.480
 is that it has a protective effect on dopamine neurons.

1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:29.440
 So caffeine in some cases

1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:31.900
 may not just increase dopamine release,

1:09:31.900 --> 1:09:33.880
 but it might actually have a protective effect

1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:35.500
 on dopamine neurons.

1:09:35.500 --> 1:09:38.360
 Now that's distinctly different from some claims

1:09:38.360 --> 1:09:41.620
 that drugs like MDMA, ecstasy,

1:09:41.620 --> 1:09:44.760
 have been, it's been argued can are neurotoxic

1:09:44.760 --> 1:09:47.240
 for things like dopamine and serotonin neurons.

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:48.960
 The study that was published about that

1:09:48.960 --> 1:09:50.240
 in the journal Science,

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:53.840
 which is an extremely prestigious, excellent journal,

1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:57.800
 later it was shown that it wasn't MDMA ecstasy

1:09:57.800 --> 1:09:59.920
 that was given in that case.

1:09:59.920 --> 1:10:01.960
 It was actually amphetamine,

1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:04.960
 which is known to destroy dopaminergic

1:10:04.960 --> 1:10:06.360
 and serotonergic neurons.

1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:07.180
 So what does this mean?

1:10:07.180 --> 1:10:09.340
 This means that low levels of caffeine may,

1:10:09.340 --> 1:10:10.480
 at least in a few studies,

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:13.480
 be protective for dopamine neurons over time.

1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:15.600
 That MDMA ecstasy,

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:17.460
 something that's in clinical trials right now

1:10:17.460 --> 1:10:19.840
 for the treatment of trauma, PTSD,

1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:21.760
 of various kinds and depression,

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:24.560
 but still illegal at this point in time,

1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:26.680
 may, although it doesn't appear yet

1:10:26.680 --> 1:10:27.840
 from any published studies,

1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:29.520
 destroy dopaminergic neurons,

1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:30.960
 perhaps serotonergic neurons.

1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:33.320
 So there's a real asterisk and a question mark there,

1:10:33.320 --> 1:10:36.320
 but amphetamine, and in particular methamphetamine,

1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:40.140
 is very destructive for dopaminergic neurons.

1:10:40.140 --> 1:10:43.360
 So I don't think any of us needed any additional reasons

1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:45.360
 to avoid methamphetamine,

1:10:45.360 --> 1:10:48.480
 this drug that creates huge increases in dopamine,

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:51.600
 and then huge crashes from that dopamine,

1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:53.060
 very destructive drug,

1:10:53.060 --> 1:10:54.040
 but in addition to that,

1:10:54.040 --> 1:10:56.400
 seems to destroy dopaminergic neurons.

1:10:56.400 --> 1:10:59.360
 From time to time, I've talked about nicotine on here,

1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:02.720
 not smoking because obviously smoking is bad,

1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:06.020
 lung cancer is bad for health, et cetera,

1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:10.100
 but nicotine in supplemental form,

1:11:10.100 --> 1:11:12.460
 I've mentioned that a very famous neuroscientist,

1:11:12.460 --> 1:11:14.400
 Nobel Prize winning scientists,

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:15.600
 choose a lot of Nicorette,

1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:17.800
 I know other people who choose Nicorette,

1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:20.240
 they believe in its neuroprotective effects

1:11:20.240 --> 1:11:21.800
 for Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,

1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:24.320
 and indeed nicotine can stimulate dopamine release,

1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:25.740
 we talked about that earlier.

1:11:25.740 --> 1:11:27.840
 Whether or not it has a protective effect isn't clear,

1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:30.400
 the protective effects might be through the noradrenergic

1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:32.200
 and acetylcholine systems,

1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:35.400
 those findings are still unclear,

1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:37.000
 but it is interesting to note

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:40.680
 that nicotine can increase prolactin somewhat,

1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:41.680
 there are a couple of studies,

1:11:41.680 --> 1:11:43.640
 I'd be happy to link to them in the caption,

1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:45.900
 that shows that nicotine taken too much

1:11:45.900 --> 1:11:48.720
 over two long periods of time can also increase prolactin,

1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:51.840
 which again is the opposite side of dopamine.

1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:55.280
 So today we've talked a lot about the dopamine system

1:11:55.280 --> 1:11:57.220
 and those kinds of schedules

1:11:57.220 --> 1:12:00.580
 that will allow craving or addiction.

1:12:00.580 --> 1:12:02.580
 What's the schedule of dopamine

1:12:02.580 --> 1:12:04.640
 that's going to allow you to maximize

1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:08.160
 on your pursuit of pleasure and your elimination of pain?

1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:10.760
 And we get the answer to that

1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:14.120
 from our good friend gambling.

1:12:14.120 --> 1:12:15.680
 The reason gambling works,

1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:17.880
 the reason why people will throw their lives away,

1:12:17.880 --> 1:12:21.660
 the reason why people go back again and again and again

1:12:21.660 --> 1:12:25.000
 to places like Las Vegas and Atlantic City

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.060
 is because of the hope and anticipation.

1:12:28.060 --> 1:12:31.940
 Those are cities and places built on dopamine, right?

1:12:31.940 --> 1:12:34.280
 They are leveraging your dopamine system.

1:12:34.280 --> 1:12:37.000
 And I realized that there are experienced gamblers,

1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:38.480
 there are people that enjoy gambling,

1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:40.120
 I'll actually just say,

1:12:40.120 --> 1:12:41.720
 I like sitting at the roulette table,

1:12:41.720 --> 1:12:44.480
 I always take a designated amount of money, it's not much,

1:12:44.480 --> 1:12:46.600
 I enjoy playing a little bit of roulette,

1:12:46.600 --> 1:12:47.920
 I certainly enjoy when I win,

1:12:47.920 --> 1:12:49.680
 I certainly don't like it when I lose,

1:12:49.680 --> 1:12:51.600
 but I do it surely for the pleasure of playing

1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:55.320
 and I do it very seldom, I don't have a gambling problem.

1:12:55.320 --> 1:12:57.480
 And if I did, I'd probably tell you,

1:12:57.480 --> 1:12:59.640
 but I don't have a gambling problem

1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:02.280
 yet people throw away the entire lives on gambling.

1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:03.400
 And as a friend of mine

1:13:03.400 --> 1:13:06.020
 who's a certified addiction treatment specialist

1:13:06.020 --> 1:13:09.400
 tells me that gambling addiction is a particularly sinister

1:13:09.400 --> 1:13:12.320
 because the next time really could be

1:13:12.320 --> 1:13:13.800
 the thing that changes everything.

1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:14.840
 Unlike other addictions,

1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:16.520
 the next time really could change everything

1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:18.960
 and that's embedded in the mind of the gambling addict

1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:22.640
 and rarely does it work out in favor of the wellbeing

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:25.280
 of the gambling addict and their family.

1:13:25.280 --> 1:13:28.540
 However, the intermittent reinforcement schedule

1:13:28.540 --> 1:13:31.760
 was discovered long ago by scientific researchers.

1:13:31.760 --> 1:13:34.400
 So this is the slot machine that every once in a while

1:13:34.400 --> 1:13:36.320
 gives you a win to keep you playing.

1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:39.960
 This is the probability of winning on the craps table

1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:41.800
 or the roulette table or at blackjack,

1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:44.720
 just often enough that you're willing to buy tickets,

1:13:44.720 --> 1:13:46.260
 head out there, play again,

1:13:46.260 --> 1:13:47.740
 go downstairs again from your room,

1:13:47.740 --> 1:13:49.820
 even though you swore you were done for the night.

1:13:49.820 --> 1:13:53.360
 Intermittent reinforcement is the most powerful form

1:13:53.360 --> 1:13:56.640
 of dopamine reward schedule to keep you doing something.

1:13:56.640 --> 1:13:59.980
 So we can export that, we can use it for good.

1:13:59.980 --> 1:14:01.740
 If there's something that you're pursuing in life,

1:14:01.740 --> 1:14:03.560
 whether or not it's an academic goal

1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:05.880
 or a financial goal or relationship goal,

1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:08.420
 one of the things that you can do

1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:11.240
 to ensure that you will remain on the path to that goal

1:14:11.240 --> 1:14:12.520
 for a very long time

1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:13.680
 and that you will continue

1:14:13.680 --> 1:14:16.000
 to exceed your previous performance

1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:18.980
 as well as continue to enjoy the dopamine release

1:14:18.980 --> 1:14:21.020
 that occurs when you hit the milestones

1:14:21.020 --> 1:14:22.800
 that you want to achieve

1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:27.800
 is to occasionally remove reward subjectively.

1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:30.640
 Let's say you set out a goal of making,

1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:31.800
 I'm going to make this quantitative

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:32.940
 with respect to finances

1:14:32.940 --> 1:14:34.480
 because it just is an easy description,

1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:37.400
 but this could also be in sport, this could be in school,

1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:38.240
 this could be in music,

1:14:38.240 --> 1:14:40.080
 could be in anything, creative endeavors.

1:14:40.080 --> 1:14:42.360
 But let's say you set out a certain financial goal

1:14:42.360 --> 1:14:44.360
 or let's say you want to get a certain number of followers

1:14:44.360 --> 1:14:46.880
 on whatever social media platform.

1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:49.480
 As you reach each one of those goals,

1:14:49.480 --> 1:14:51.920
 you should know now that the amount of dopamine

1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:52.880
 is not going to peak,

1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:55.600
 it's actually going to diminish and make you crave more.

1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:58.240
 The key to avoiding that crash,

1:14:58.240 --> 1:14:59.800
 but to still keep it in healthy levels

1:14:59.800 --> 1:15:01.920
 that will allow you to continue your pursuit

1:15:01.920 --> 1:15:05.320
 is as you are staircasing toward your goal,

1:15:05.320 --> 1:15:07.240
 maybe that's dollars, maybe that's followers,

1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:10.200
 maybe that's grades, maybe that's some other metric,

1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:12.200
 it's medals or trophies,

1:15:12.200 --> 1:15:16.900
 you actually want to blunt the reward response

1:15:16.900 --> 1:15:19.500
 for some of those intermediate goals.

1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:21.600
 Now I'm not telling you you shouldn't celebrate your wins,

1:15:21.600 --> 1:15:24.140
 but I'm telling you not to celebrate all of them.

1:15:24.140 --> 1:15:27.100
 Whereas a good friend of mine who recently,

1:15:27.100 --> 1:15:30.060
 fortunately for him, had a great financial success,

1:15:30.060 --> 1:15:32.960
 he asked me and somebody else, a good friend of mine,

1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:35.740
 who's very tuned into dopamine reward schedules,

1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:37.900
 understands how they work at a really deep level.

1:15:37.900 --> 1:15:39.700
 And he said, I don't know what to do next.

1:15:39.700 --> 1:15:41.780
 And we said, oh, well, that's simple.

1:15:41.780 --> 1:15:43.740
 You should just give most of it away.

1:15:43.740 --> 1:15:45.620
 And this wasn't a ploy to receive

1:15:45.620 --> 1:15:46.940
 any of the money ourselves.

1:15:46.940 --> 1:15:50.700
 This was really about reducing the impact of that reward.

1:15:50.700 --> 1:15:52.420
 Now, hopefully giving money away,

1:15:52.420 --> 1:15:53.960
 if you already have enough of it,

1:15:53.960 --> 1:15:57.280
 would be something that was rewarding in and of itself.

1:15:57.280 --> 1:16:00.900
 But if you're a student who's pursuing goals in university,

1:16:00.900 --> 1:16:03.660
 or you're an athlete who's pursuing goals,

1:16:03.660 --> 1:16:06.960
 it actually makes sense from a rational perspective,

1:16:06.960 --> 1:16:09.180
 once you understand these mechanisms,

1:16:09.180 --> 1:16:13.140
 to hit a new high point of performance,

1:16:13.140 --> 1:16:15.180
 or to get that A plus or for you,

1:16:15.180 --> 1:16:17.480
 if it's an A minus, et cetera,

1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:19.900
 and to tell yourself, okay, that was good,

1:16:19.900 --> 1:16:23.020
 but to actually actively blunt the reward,

1:16:23.020 --> 1:16:26.500
 to not go and celebrate too intensely.

1:16:26.500 --> 1:16:27.700
 Because in doing that,

1:16:27.700 --> 1:16:30.120
 you keep your dopamine system in check,

1:16:30.120 --> 1:16:32.660
 and you ensure that you're going to stay on the path

1:16:32.660 --> 1:16:34.780
 of continued pursuit, not just for that thing,

1:16:34.780 --> 1:16:35.860
 but for all things.

1:16:35.860 --> 1:16:39.620
 Big increases in dopamine lead to big crashes in dopamine,

1:16:39.620 --> 1:16:42.580
 and big increases in dopamine up the ante.

1:16:42.580 --> 1:16:45.180
 They increase the extent to which

1:16:45.180 --> 1:16:48.060
 you are willing to invest time and energy

1:16:48.060 --> 1:16:51.180
 in order to achieve goals and rewards

1:16:51.180 --> 1:16:52.640
 that may be out of your reach.

1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:54.960
 You never really know if you're going to succeed.

1:16:54.960 --> 1:16:57.660
 So to make this crystal clear,

1:16:57.660 --> 1:17:00.700
 celebrate your wins, but don't celebrate every win.

1:17:00.700 --> 1:17:02.220
 That's one way that you can ensure

1:17:02.220 --> 1:17:04.940
 that you're going to continue down the path of progress.

1:17:04.940 --> 1:17:06.900
 And I think most of the learning tools

1:17:06.900 --> 1:17:09.200
 that are in schools are about reward,

1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:12.100
 hopefully for genuine performance.

1:17:12.100 --> 1:17:13.540
 They are about encouraging us.

1:17:13.540 --> 1:17:15.980
 We do have to believe that we can perform well.

1:17:15.980 --> 1:17:17.620
 One of the hallmarks of growth mindset

1:17:17.620 --> 1:17:19.100
 is the internalization,

1:17:19.100 --> 1:17:21.740
 that we're not getting it right yet.

1:17:21.740 --> 1:17:23.820
 The word yet is very important.

1:17:23.820 --> 1:17:28.580
 And also the sense that we reward our good behavior,

1:17:28.580 --> 1:17:31.860
 our good performance, but not every time.

1:17:31.860 --> 1:17:34.820
 One way to do this is to actually take the reward

1:17:34.820 --> 1:17:37.660
 and reinforcement out of your own hands and your own mind.

1:17:37.660 --> 1:17:41.260
 And you tell somebody that they are in control

1:17:41.260 --> 1:17:42.340
 of whether or not you're allowed

1:17:42.340 --> 1:17:43.600
 to feel good about your wins.

1:17:43.600 --> 1:17:46.840
 Now, this is, I realize it's very unnatural for most people,

1:17:46.840 --> 1:17:50.100
 but if you're somebody who's simply going to be in pursuit

1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:52.340
 and you're going to really register your wins,

1:17:52.340 --> 1:17:53.780
 and you think that that's going to actually

1:17:53.780 --> 1:17:55.140
 make you a better performer,

1:17:55.140 --> 1:17:57.620
 it will in the short term, but not in the long term.

1:17:57.620 --> 1:18:02.060
 So you can lift the, what, Las Vegas and Atlantic City

1:18:02.060 --> 1:18:05.660
 and other gambling mechanisms and places

1:18:05.660 --> 1:18:06.620
 have known for a long time.

1:18:06.620 --> 1:18:07.900
 They lifted it from the scientists.

1:18:07.900 --> 1:18:10.980
 You can now take it back and you can start to leverage that

1:18:10.980 --> 1:18:12.480
 and you just make it intermittent.

1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:15.300
 You reward yourself not on a predictable schedule.

1:18:15.300 --> 1:18:17.620
 So not every other time or every third time

1:18:17.620 --> 1:18:19.740
 or every 10th time, but sometimes it's three in a row,

1:18:19.740 --> 1:18:21.820
 then not at all for 10 days.

1:18:21.820 --> 1:18:24.420
 So reward is important.

1:18:24.420 --> 1:18:26.340
 Self-reward is critically important,

1:18:26.340 --> 1:18:28.340
 but make sure that you're not doing it

1:18:28.340 --> 1:18:30.660
 on such a predictable schedule

1:18:30.660 --> 1:18:33.580
 that you burn out these dopamine circuits

1:18:33.580 --> 1:18:35.660
 or that you undercut your own ability

1:18:35.660 --> 1:18:38.540
 to strive and achieve.

1:18:38.540 --> 1:18:41.460
 I actually have a story from graduate school

1:18:41.460 --> 1:18:43.100
 in which I was forced

1:18:43.100 --> 1:18:45.200
 into an intermittent reinforcement schedule

1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:47.700
 that I do believe has served me very well

1:18:47.700 --> 1:18:50.620
 in my scientific career and other aspects of life.

1:18:50.620 --> 1:18:53.540
 My graduate advisor was an amazing scientist.

1:18:53.540 --> 1:18:56.420
 Unfortunately, she passed away, but amazing scientist

1:18:56.420 --> 1:18:59.200
 and amazing human being with a very dry

1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:01.980
 and somewhat cruel sense of humor.

1:19:01.980 --> 1:19:03.620
 Her name was Barbara Chapman.

1:19:03.620 --> 1:19:07.100
 And we published a paper in the journal Science.

1:19:07.100 --> 1:19:11.100
 And Science, Nature and Cell are considered the big three,

1:19:11.100 --> 1:19:13.740
 the most competitive journals to publish in.

1:19:13.740 --> 1:19:15.880
 I had a first author paper in Science.

1:19:15.880 --> 1:19:18.340
 It was really exciting to me.

1:19:18.340 --> 1:19:19.340
 I was a graduate student.

1:19:19.340 --> 1:19:21.240
 I was very excited about the discovery.

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:22.820
 I was excited that it was in Science.

1:19:22.820 --> 1:19:24.900
 I was just thrilled.

1:19:24.900 --> 1:19:27.200
 And I remember when the paper finally got accepted

1:19:27.200 --> 1:19:29.280
 because it involved a ton of revisions

1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:31.980
 and a lot of very hard work.

1:19:31.980 --> 1:19:35.660
 And she came in and she said, you know, paper got accepted.

1:19:35.660 --> 1:19:36.920
 I was super excited.

1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:38.960
 And she just kind of sat there and nodded.

1:19:38.960 --> 1:19:41.700
 And I said, are we going to celebrate?

1:19:41.700 --> 1:19:42.820
 Are we going to have a party?

1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:44.400
 Or like, what are we going to do?

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:45.580
 And I'll never forget her answer.

1:19:45.580 --> 1:19:50.400
 She said, hmm, I think we should skip this one.

1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:51.740
 And I thought she was joking.

1:19:51.740 --> 1:19:53.220
 And I said, what do you mean skip this one?

1:19:53.220 --> 1:19:54.060
 We're going to publish the paper.

1:19:54.060 --> 1:19:55.420
 She said, yeah, we're going to publish the paper.

1:19:55.420 --> 1:20:00.140
 But she said, you know, maybe when you get like four more,

1:20:00.140 --> 1:20:02.180
 maybe three, maybe two.

1:20:02.180 --> 1:20:03.820
 And I thought she was messing with me.

1:20:03.820 --> 1:20:05.060
 And she wasn't messing with me.

1:20:05.060 --> 1:20:05.900
 And she was right.

1:20:05.900 --> 1:20:06.900
 We never had a party.

1:20:06.900 --> 1:20:09.100
 We never had a celebration for that paper.

1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:12.360
 I think she was really trying to instill two ideas in me.

1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:14.700
 One is that the work itself

1:20:14.700 --> 1:20:16.560
 was what was supposed to be most rewarding.

1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:19.440
 The practice of experimentation or writing the paper,

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:20.940
 the experience of achieving something

1:20:20.940 --> 1:20:22.380
 they worked very hard at.

1:20:22.380 --> 1:20:24.140
 And that did indeed feel amazing.

1:20:24.140 --> 1:20:26.800
 I actually can still feel it in my body now, the excitement.

1:20:26.800 --> 1:20:29.260
 So there's still a dopamine release

1:20:29.260 --> 1:20:31.060
 or that arc is going very long.

1:20:31.060 --> 1:20:35.120
 This would be almost 20 years ago now that this happened.

1:20:35.120 --> 1:20:36.500
 So that's remarkable.

1:20:36.500 --> 1:20:38.660
 The other one is that she's right.

1:20:38.660 --> 1:20:40.580
 We never went out and celebrated

1:20:40.580 --> 1:20:42.340
 and we did celebrate other wins,

1:20:42.340 --> 1:20:44.780
 other papers in the future and things of that sort.

1:20:44.780 --> 1:20:48.580
 But she was either consciously or subconsciously

1:20:48.580 --> 1:20:50.820
 putting me on an intermittent reward schedule.

1:20:50.820 --> 1:20:54.180
 And to this day, when something really good happens,

1:20:54.180 --> 1:20:56.500
 I actually hesitate as to whether or not

1:20:56.500 --> 1:20:58.940
 I want to internalize that and celebrate

1:20:58.940 --> 1:21:00.220
 whether I want to tell anybody,

1:21:00.220 --> 1:21:01.860
 which is its own form of celebration

1:21:01.860 --> 1:21:03.660
 because then you're getting positive feedback.

1:21:03.660 --> 1:21:08.260
 And so I am very cautious with how I deploy dopamine release

1:21:08.260 --> 1:21:09.560
 in response to wins.

1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:10.780
 It's certainly not the only way

1:21:10.780 --> 1:21:12.880
 that I've navigated my career.

1:21:12.880 --> 1:21:15.060
 There are a number of other principles I incorporate,

1:21:15.060 --> 1:21:20.060
 but intermittent reward for wins, for achievements

1:21:20.060 --> 1:21:22.680
 is a very powerful way to ensure

1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.260
 that you will stay on the path of pursuit.

1:21:25.260 --> 1:21:27.220
 At this point in the podcast,

1:21:27.220 --> 1:21:30.540
 I'd like to take a moment to address some corrections.

1:21:30.540 --> 1:21:32.540
 I made some errors in previous episodes.

1:21:32.540 --> 1:21:33.740
 They weren't major errors,

1:21:33.740 --> 1:21:35.700
 but a couple of you pointed them out.

1:21:35.700 --> 1:21:38.980
 And it's important to me that we strive for accuracy.

1:21:38.980 --> 1:21:42.300
 So the first one was I talked in a previous episode

1:21:42.300 --> 1:21:45.020
 about the potential benefits for some people,

1:21:45.020 --> 1:21:49.740
 not all of ashwagandha and its role in blunting cortisol

1:21:49.740 --> 1:21:54.160
 in a way of offsetting medium-term and some long-term stress.

1:21:54.160 --> 1:21:56.340
 It's a supplement that I've benefited from.

1:21:56.340 --> 1:21:59.020
 It works through the GABA system and some other systems.

1:21:59.020 --> 1:22:01.980
 Someone pointed out a study that admittedly

1:22:01.980 --> 1:22:03.020
 was done in rats.

1:22:03.020 --> 1:22:05.620
 I was focusing mainly on studies in humans

1:22:05.620 --> 1:22:08.060
 during the episode, but they point out a study

1:22:08.060 --> 1:22:09.460
 that was done in rats that showed

1:22:09.460 --> 1:22:13.700
 that long-term administration of ashwagandha

1:22:13.700 --> 1:22:16.380
 could actually create some negative effects,

1:22:16.380 --> 1:22:17.500
 mainly on the thyroid

1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:20.660
 and perhaps even the cortisol system,

1:22:20.660 --> 1:22:22.240
 maybe the melatonin system.

1:22:22.240 --> 1:22:24.420
 I just want to acknowledge that study.

1:22:24.420 --> 1:22:26.660
 I'll reference it in the caption.

1:22:26.660 --> 1:22:27.900
 Again, that was a rat study.

1:22:27.900 --> 1:22:29.200
 I was focused on human studies.

1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:31.080
 Please go to examine.com.

1:22:31.080 --> 1:22:31.920
 Put in ashwagandha.

1:22:31.920 --> 1:22:33.620
 It will tell you the various effects

1:22:33.620 --> 1:22:35.620
 on different aspects of brain and body.

1:22:35.620 --> 1:22:37.500
 It will also link to the PubMed articles

1:22:37.500 --> 1:22:38.780
 that are relevant there.

1:22:38.780 --> 1:22:40.340
 It is called the human effect matrix

1:22:40.340 --> 1:22:42.020
 because that's only focused on humans.

1:22:42.020 --> 1:22:43.840
 That's one of the reasons I like examine.com

1:22:43.840 --> 1:22:45.700
 is it's focused on human studies.

1:22:45.700 --> 1:22:47.460
 Again, a wonderful free resource.

1:22:48.300 --> 1:22:50.920
 But I do appreciate that you pointed out that study

1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:52.580
 because I do want people to be aware

1:22:52.580 --> 1:22:54.220
 of the range of effects

1:22:54.220 --> 1:22:56.220
 that these various compounds can have.

1:22:57.380 --> 1:22:59.860
 As well, a couple of times in previous episodes,

1:22:59.860 --> 1:23:04.620
 I said 5-HTP and not 5-HT.

1:23:04.620 --> 1:23:06.420
 5-HT is serotonin.

1:23:06.420 --> 1:23:09.660
 5-HTP is a precursor to serotonin.

1:23:09.660 --> 1:23:11.860
 I was talking about supplements and compounds

1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:14.560
 that can stimulate the release of serotonin.

1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:15.620
 In the previous episode,

1:23:15.620 --> 1:23:17.580
 I was actually referring to it in a context

1:23:17.580 --> 1:23:20.660
 for which I don't personally like to take 5-HTP.

1:23:20.660 --> 1:23:22.660
 That's just my own bias

1:23:22.660 --> 1:23:24.460
 for reasons I described in that episode.

1:23:24.460 --> 1:23:27.460
 But if you heard me say 5-HTP

1:23:27.460 --> 1:23:31.220
 when I meant to say 5-HT, I apologize.

1:23:31.220 --> 1:23:33.280
 And then last, I just want to point out again,

1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:34.420
 something that I mentioned in the beginning,

1:23:34.420 --> 1:23:36.540
 which is that the Huberman Lab Podcast

1:23:36.540 --> 1:23:38.840
 is now subtitled in Spanish.

1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:40.060
 Episodes one and two,

1:23:40.060 --> 1:23:41.920
 as well as our welcome video are in Spanish.

1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:44.780
 The other ones will be subtitled soon.

1:23:44.780 --> 1:23:47.100
 You can expect that within the next couple of weeks.

1:23:47.100 --> 1:23:49.440
 So if you know Spanish-speaking people

1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:52.140
 who prefer to digest the information in Spanish,

1:23:52.140 --> 1:23:53.700
 or that's you,

1:23:53.700 --> 1:23:56.140
 you can look forward to the Spanish subtitles.

1:23:56.140 --> 1:23:58.060
 You need to activate those

1:23:58.060 --> 1:24:00.300
 in the caption feature on YouTube.

1:24:00.300 --> 1:24:03.900
 Unfortunately, we don't have Spanish dubbing over

1:24:03.900 --> 1:24:06.020
 in the audio platforms.

1:24:06.020 --> 1:24:09.740
 I realize once again, we've covered a lot of material.

1:24:09.740 --> 1:24:13.140
 Hopefully you now know far more about the dopamine system,

1:24:13.140 --> 1:24:15.180
 reward and motivation

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:17.820
 than you did at the beginning of this podcast.

1:24:17.820 --> 1:24:20.540
 Hopefully you also understand the other side

1:24:20.540 --> 1:24:21.660
 of dopamine and reward,

1:24:21.660 --> 1:24:25.100
 which is pain and the balance of this pleasure pain system,

1:24:25.100 --> 1:24:28.020
 as well as the molecules that we call,

1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:30.560
 or that were described in the Molecule of More book,

1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:32.780
 I should say, as the here and now molecules,

1:24:32.780 --> 1:24:36.020
 things like serotonin and the endocannabinoids.

1:24:36.020 --> 1:24:38.860
 We talked about a variety of supplement-based tools,

1:24:38.860 --> 1:24:40.740
 things like vitamin B6 and zinc

1:24:40.740 --> 1:24:43.300
 as they relate to prolactin, PEA,

1:24:43.300 --> 1:24:45.320
 very interesting compound.

1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:46.740
 Again, I've never tried it.

1:24:46.740 --> 1:24:48.980
 Very interesting, definitely in use out there.

1:24:48.980 --> 1:24:51.020
 L-DOPA, macuna purines,

1:24:51.020 --> 1:24:52.900
 talked about caffeine,

1:24:53.840 --> 1:24:55.340
 talked about nicotine,

1:24:55.340 --> 1:24:57.980
 talked about how some of the effects of Adderall

1:24:57.980 --> 1:24:59.820
 can be created purely cognitively

1:24:59.820 --> 1:25:01.700
 without actually ingesting Adderall,

1:25:01.700 --> 1:25:04.100
 simply by telling people they're ingesting Adderall,

1:25:04.100 --> 1:25:04.980
 giving them caffeine.

1:25:04.980 --> 1:25:06.740
 Very interesting study

1:25:06.740 --> 1:25:08.860
 that I referenced a little bit earlier.

1:25:08.860 --> 1:25:12.220
 And we talked about scheduling dopamine,

1:25:12.220 --> 1:25:16.260
 adopting the intermittent reward schedule for yourself

1:25:16.260 --> 1:25:19.080
 in order to ensure long-term engagement

1:25:19.080 --> 1:25:21.820
 with pursuits that I hope are healthy pursuits

1:25:21.820 --> 1:25:24.260
 and ones that serve you well.

1:25:24.260 --> 1:25:27.260
 This was by no means an exhaustive coverage

1:25:27.260 --> 1:25:29.960
 of all things dopamine and motivation.

1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:32.140
 It was by no means the only time

1:25:32.140 --> 1:25:35.120
 that we're going to talk about dopamine and motivation.

1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:37.500
 Next episode, we're going to continue to talk about emotions

1:25:37.500 --> 1:25:40.100
 from yet another perspective.

1:25:40.100 --> 1:25:42.460
 But hopefully you have enough now to think about

1:25:42.460 --> 1:25:43.600
 in the meantime,

1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:45.700
 and that you can consider adopting

1:25:45.700 --> 1:25:47.420
 in your own life and practices.

1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:49.940
 As always, I really want to thank you

1:25:49.940 --> 1:25:51.440
 for your time and attention.

1:25:51.440 --> 1:25:53.180
 If you've learned something useful today,

1:25:53.180 --> 1:25:54.560
 please pass it along.

1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:56.660
 One of the things that we teach in science

1:25:56.660 --> 1:25:59.520
 that I think is really wonderful to adopt in general in life

1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:02.940
 is this idea of watch one, do one, teach one.

1:26:02.940 --> 1:26:04.460
 This is what we tell graduate students

1:26:04.460 --> 1:26:06.380
 and med students and postdocs.

1:26:06.380 --> 1:26:08.520
 Watch somebody do something, learn it,

1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:11.060
 then do it, apply it, see if it works for you,

1:26:11.060 --> 1:26:12.280
 and then teach it.

1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:14.340
 So it's usually not watch one, do one, teach one.

1:26:14.340 --> 1:26:17.480
 It's usually watch one, do 20,

1:26:17.480 --> 1:26:20.860
 teach as many people as you possibly want.

1:26:20.860 --> 1:26:22.140
 I'm not looking for attribution.

1:26:22.140 --> 1:26:24.420
 These are tools that are grounded in neuroscience

1:26:24.420 --> 1:26:26.300
 for which I can't claim attribution.

1:26:26.300 --> 1:26:27.780
 I'm just passing them along

1:26:27.780 --> 1:26:29.400
 so that you can adopt them if you like

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:31.580
 and pass them along if you think people

1:26:31.580 --> 1:26:33.160
 can benefit from them.

1:26:33.160 --> 1:26:34.780
 Many of you have continued to ask

1:26:34.780 --> 1:26:37.660
 how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:26:37.660 --> 1:26:38.860
 If you like what we're doing here

1:26:38.860 --> 1:26:41.000
 and you like the information that we're sharing,

1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.260
 please click subscribe on the YouTube channel.

1:26:43.260 --> 1:26:44.740
 That really helps us.

1:26:44.740 --> 1:26:48.020
 As well, if you want to hit the notifications button,

1:26:48.020 --> 1:26:49.620
 that will allow you to make sure

1:26:49.620 --> 1:26:51.140
 you don't miss any episodes.

1:26:51.140 --> 1:26:53.980
 Typically, we release episodes every Monday,

1:26:53.980 --> 1:26:56.140
 but in the future, we may release episodes

1:26:56.140 --> 1:26:59.140
 as well as short clips more often than that.

1:26:59.140 --> 1:27:02.660
 As well, if you want to subscribe on Apple or Spotify

1:27:02.660 --> 1:27:05.060
 or both, that's a great help to us.

1:27:05.060 --> 1:27:06.880
 And on Apple, you have the opportunity

1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:09.280
 to leave us up to a five-star review.

1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:11.580
 We do use the comment section here on YouTube

1:27:11.580 --> 1:27:14.740
 to inform future content and to address any questions

1:27:14.740 --> 1:27:16.880
 and clear up any miscommunications

1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:18.940
 or misconceptions that might arise.

1:27:18.940 --> 1:27:21.400
 So please put your questions, your comments,

1:27:21.400 --> 1:27:23.140
 and your suggestions for future content

1:27:23.140 --> 1:27:25.120
 in the comment section below.

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:27.540
 The other way to support us is to check out our sponsors

1:27:27.540 --> 1:27:29.900
 that were mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.

1:27:29.900 --> 1:27:32.680
 The links to those sponsors are in the captions.

1:27:32.680 --> 1:27:34.940
 As well, we've set up a Patreon account,

1:27:34.940 --> 1:27:38.060
 which is patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman

1:27:38.060 --> 1:27:40.220
 that allows you to support the podcast

1:27:40.220 --> 1:27:42.320
 at any level that you like.

1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:44.460
 As well, because we mentioned supplements

1:27:44.460 --> 1:27:46.580
 from time to time throughout the podcast,

1:27:46.580 --> 1:27:49.500
 and people always ask about what brands and sources

1:27:49.500 --> 1:27:52.120
 we use or suggest for those supplements,

1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:55.820
 we partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

1:27:55.820 --> 1:27:57.820
 Thorne supplements are known to be

1:27:57.820 --> 1:28:00.560
 among the most stringent supplements in terms of

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:02.460
 the specificity of what's in the bottle,

1:28:02.460 --> 1:28:03.760
 matches what's on the label,

1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:07.140
 the quality of the ingredients is exceedingly high.

1:28:07.140 --> 1:28:09.980
 The Mayo Clinic and all the major sports organizations

1:28:09.980 --> 1:28:13.060
 are partnered with Thorne because of that stringency

1:28:13.060 --> 1:28:15.140
 and that commitment to rigor.

1:28:15.140 --> 1:28:18.300
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I personally take,

1:28:18.300 --> 1:28:20.700
 as well as get 20% off any of the supplements

1:28:20.700 --> 1:28:25.120
 that Thorne makes, you can go to thorne.com slash U,

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:27.780
 that's the letter U slash Huberman,

1:28:27.780 --> 1:28:30.300
 and you can see what I take and any of those supplements,

1:28:30.300 --> 1:28:33.580
 as well as any of the other products on the Thorne site

1:28:33.580 --> 1:28:35.980
 will be available to you at 20% off.

1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:39.820
 That's thorne.com slash U slash Huberman

1:28:39.820 --> 1:28:43.600
 to get 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.

1:28:43.600 --> 1:28:44.820
 Finally, I want to thank you

1:28:44.820 --> 1:28:46.480
 for your time and attention today.

1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:48.820
 I hope you learned a lot and that you learned

1:28:48.820 --> 1:28:51.460
 a lot of possible tools that you could incorporate

1:28:51.460 --> 1:28:55.660
 into your life as it relates to motivation and emotions.

1:28:55.660 --> 1:28:57.540
 Thank you for your interest in science.

1:28:57.540 --> 1:29:22.540
 I'll see you in the next one.
