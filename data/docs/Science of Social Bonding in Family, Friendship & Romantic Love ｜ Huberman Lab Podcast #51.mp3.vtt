00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.320
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.320 --> 00:12.960
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.960 --> 00:14.880
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.880 --> 00:18.000
 Today's episode is about the biology, psychology,

00:18.000 --> 00:20.720
 and practices of social bonding.

00:20.720 --> 00:23.700
 From the day we are born until the day we die,

00:23.700 --> 00:25.400
 the quality of our social bonds

00:25.400 --> 00:28.240
 dictates much of our quality of life.

00:28.240 --> 00:31.440
 It should therefore be no surprise that our brain,

00:31.440 --> 00:34.120
 and indeed much of our entire nervous system,

00:34.120 --> 00:36.780
 is wired for social bonds.

00:36.780 --> 00:40.360
 Now, social bonds occur between infant and parent.

00:40.360 --> 00:43.040
 There are even particular wiring diagrams

00:43.040 --> 00:45.760
 within the brain and spinal cord and body

00:45.760 --> 00:48.080
 that are oriented towards the specific bonds

00:48.080 --> 00:50.360
 that occur between infant and mother,

00:50.360 --> 00:52.860
 as well as infant and father.

00:52.860 --> 00:56.180
 And we have specific brain circuitries for friendship,

00:56.180 --> 00:58.780
 specific brain circuitries that are activated

00:58.780 --> 01:00.560
 in romantic relationships.

01:00.560 --> 01:03.580
 And as it goes, specific brain circuitries

01:03.580 --> 01:06.940
 that are activated when we break up with a romantic partner,

01:06.940 --> 01:08.380
 or when they break up with us,

01:08.380 --> 01:11.200
 or when somebody passes away, moves away,

01:11.200 --> 01:15.520
 or otherwise leaves our lives in one form or another.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.040
 Today, we are going to talk about

01:17.040 --> 01:19.440
 those brain and nervous system circuitries.

01:19.440 --> 01:21.400
 We're also going to talk about the neurochemicals

01:21.400 --> 01:24.240
 and hormones that underlie their function.

01:24.240 --> 01:26.880
 And we are going to touch on a number of important

01:26.880 --> 01:30.560
 and actionable tools that you can apply in everyday life.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.120
 And because we are headed into the holiday,

01:33.120 --> 01:35.840
 the New Year's and Christmas holiday,

01:35.840 --> 01:38.300
 that you can deploy in your various interactions

01:38.300 --> 01:40.040
 with family members and friends.

01:40.040 --> 01:42.020
 And should you not be spending time

01:42.020 --> 01:43.120
 with family members and friends,

01:43.120 --> 01:44.900
 today we are also going to talk about

01:44.900 --> 01:48.260
 how to achieve social bonds out of the context

01:48.260 --> 01:51.320
 of family and romantic partnership and friendship.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.120
 So today's episode is going to include a lot of science,

01:54.120 --> 01:55.800
 a lot of actionable tools,

01:55.800 --> 01:57.760
 and I'm confident that you will come away

01:57.760 --> 02:00.700
 from today's episode with tremendous knowledge

02:00.700 --> 02:02.580
 about how you function.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.000
 For instance, if you're an introvert or an extrovert,

02:05.000 --> 02:05.840
 why is that?

02:05.840 --> 02:08.240
 Turns out there may be a neurochemical basis for that.

02:08.240 --> 02:10.320
 Maybe you're somebody that really enjoys social media.

02:10.320 --> 02:11.680
 Maybe you're somebody that doesn't.

02:11.680 --> 02:14.680
 Today, I'm going to talk about a gene or a set of genes

02:14.680 --> 02:17.560
 that predicts whether or not you will follow more people

02:17.560 --> 02:21.640
 or seek out more online social interactions or fewer.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.720
 Believe it or not, there's biology around that now,

02:23.720 --> 02:25.760
 and it's excellent peer reviewed work.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.960
 We will also talk about how bonds are broken

02:28.960 --> 02:31.220
 and why breakups can be so painful,

02:31.220 --> 02:32.500
 not just romantic breakups,

02:32.500 --> 02:35.160
 but breakups with friendships and coworkers

02:35.160 --> 02:38.080
 and how to move through those more seamlessly.

02:38.080 --> 02:40.840
 So regardless of your age and regardless of whether or not

02:40.840 --> 02:43.760
 you are in a romantic partnership of one form or another

02:43.760 --> 02:47.280
 or not, I do believe this episode will be useful to you

02:47.280 --> 02:49.380
 as you explore the social bonds

02:49.380 --> 02:50.800
 that already exist in your life

02:50.800 --> 02:55.160
 and as you seek out new and changing social bonds.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.560
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

02:57.560 --> 03:00.120
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.040
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:02.040 --> 03:04.560
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:04.560 --> 03:07.180
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:07.180 --> 03:08.120
 In keeping with that theme,

03:08.120 --> 03:10.680
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.380
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

03:12.380 --> 03:14.360
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:14.360 --> 03:16.860
 that are the absolute highest quality.

03:16.860 --> 03:18.520
 I've spent a lifetime working on the biology

03:18.520 --> 03:19.440
 of the visual system,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.660
 and the visual system has many important features

03:21.660 --> 03:22.740
 that allow us, for instance,

03:22.740 --> 03:24.580
 to see things with crystal clarity,

03:24.580 --> 03:26.800
 even if it's brightly lit or dimly lit

03:26.800 --> 03:30.060
 or they're changing brightness in our environment.

03:30.060 --> 03:32.860
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are designed

03:32.860 --> 03:35.440
 with the biology of the visual system in mind.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.480
 So when you wear them,

03:36.480 --> 03:38.520
 you don't have to take them off and put them back on

03:38.520 --> 03:41.000
 like you would with other types of sunglasses and eyeglasses,

03:41.000 --> 03:43.640
 and you're always going to see things with crystal clarity.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.280
 In addition, they're very lightweight,

03:45.280 --> 03:46.680
 so usually you forget that you're wearing them.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.080
 I certainly forget when I'm wearing mine.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.920
 I wear readers at night and when I drive

03:49.920 --> 03:52.480
 and I wear sunglasses often throughout the day.

03:52.480 --> 03:53.460
 The other thing that's really great

03:53.460 --> 03:55.400
 about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:55.400 --> 03:58.040
 is that you can wear them doing anything.

03:58.040 --> 04:00.640
 You can wear them while running, while cycling.

04:00.640 --> 04:03.080
 If you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face.

04:03.080 --> 04:06.660
 But unlike a lot of other performance eyeglasses out there,

04:06.660 --> 04:07.800
 they have a terrific aesthetic

04:07.800 --> 04:11.120
 that you could also wear to work, to school, out to dinner.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.580
 They're basically going to be worn anywhere, anytime.

04:13.580 --> 04:15.960
 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,

04:15.960 --> 04:18.600
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com

04:18.600 --> 04:22.000
 and enter the code Huberman to save 20% off your first order.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.080
 Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com

04:24.080 --> 04:27.580
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout to get 20% off.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.280
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

04:30.280 --> 04:31.760
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

04:31.760 --> 04:34.040
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.360
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012

04:37.360 --> 04:38.500
 and I've taken it ever since,

04:38.500 --> 04:40.920
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.620
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

04:42.620 --> 04:44.340
 and the reason that I still take Athletic Greens

04:44.340 --> 04:46.840
 once or twice a day is because it covers

04:46.840 --> 04:50.640
 all of my vitamin mineral probiotic foundational needs.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.000
 There's now a wealth of evidence pointing to the fact

04:53.000 --> 04:54.760
 that vitamins, minerals, and probiotics

04:54.760 --> 04:57.880
 support a healthy gut microbiome, healthy immune system,

04:57.880 --> 05:00.160
 healthy nervous system, healthy endocrine system,

05:00.160 --> 05:01.360
 that's the hormone system.

05:01.360 --> 05:04.200
 And with Athletic Greens, it really covers all those bases.

05:04.200 --> 05:05.600
 In fact, when people ask me

05:05.600 --> 05:07.360
 what one supplement they should take,

05:07.360 --> 05:09.240
 I recommend Athletic Greens.

05:09.240 --> 05:10.560
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:10.560 --> 05:13.140
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

05:13.140 --> 05:15.840
 And if you do that, you can claim a special offer.

05:15.840 --> 05:17.540
 They're giving five free travel packs,

05:17.540 --> 05:19.540
 which make it very easy to mix up the Athletic Greens

05:19.540 --> 05:21.960
 while on the road, in the car, on the plane, et cetera,

05:21.960 --> 05:25.320
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.120
 There's now a lot of evidence supporting that vitamin D3

05:29.120 --> 05:33.000
 is great for our metabolism, endocrine system, mood, sleep,

05:33.000 --> 05:34.720
 a huge number of biological functions.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.060
 And K2 has also been shown to be important

05:37.060 --> 05:39.320
 for cardiovascular health and various aspects

05:39.320 --> 05:40.200
 of blood lipids.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.920
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

05:42.920 --> 05:44.300
 you can claim a special offer.

05:44.300 --> 05:45.360
 You'll get your Athletic Greens,

05:45.360 --> 05:47.280
 five free travel packs of Athletic Greens,

05:47.280 --> 05:50.480
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.200
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

05:53.200 --> 05:54.540
 Headspace is a meditation app

05:54.540 --> 05:56.520
 supported by 25 published studies

05:56.520 --> 06:00.040
 and has over 600,000 five-star reviews.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.040
 I've been meditating for a very long time,

06:02.040 --> 06:04.680
 more than three decades, but I confess,

06:04.680 --> 06:07.920
 I haven't been a consistent meditator until recently.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.860
 I think many people have that experience.

06:09.860 --> 06:12.000
 We've all heard about the terrific science

06:12.000 --> 06:14.360
 and benefits of a regular meditation practice,

06:14.360 --> 06:17.020
 things like reduced anxiety, improved sleep,

06:17.020 --> 06:19.240
 sharper cognition and focus.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.480
 However, sticking to a meditation practice can be tricky

06:22.480 --> 06:24.360
 and many people start and then they stop,

06:24.360 --> 06:25.480
 or at least that's what happened to me

06:25.480 --> 06:27.080
 until a few years ago when I started using

06:27.080 --> 06:30.160
 the Headspace app to do my meditation.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.000
 Headspace has short meditations

06:32.000 --> 06:34.680
 of just a couple minutes long, longer meditations.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.680
 Ideally for me, I like to do a 20-minute meditation

06:37.680 --> 06:38.840
 at least three times a week,

06:38.840 --> 06:40.560
 but sometimes because of my schedule

06:40.560 --> 06:41.680
 and other things going on,

06:41.680 --> 06:43.560
 I only sneak in a five-minute meditation

06:43.560 --> 06:45.320
 once or twice a week.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.240
 With Headspace, you have a huge number of meditations

06:48.240 --> 06:49.320
 to select from.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.660
 So if you want to try Headspace,

06:50.660 --> 06:53.440
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer

06:53.440 --> 06:55.640
 and if you do that, you'll get a completely free

06:55.640 --> 06:58.840
 one-month trial with all of Headspace's meditations.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.620
 That's the full library of meditations

07:00.620 --> 07:02.140
 that Headspace has to offer.

07:02.140 --> 07:04.000
 That's the best deal offered by Headspace right now.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.440
 So again, if you're interested,

07:05.440 --> 07:08.520
 go to headspace.com slash special offer today.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.880
 Let's talk about the biology of social bonding

07:10.880 --> 07:11.800
 and I want to point out

07:11.800 --> 07:14.840
 that I use the word bonding intentionally.

07:14.840 --> 07:18.960
 It's a verb and in biology, we want to think about verbs

07:18.960 --> 07:22.280
 because everything in biology is a process.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.000
 It's not an event.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.480
 And when we think about things in biology as a process,

07:26.480 --> 07:28.360
 that means it's going to have multiple steps

07:28.360 --> 07:30.880
 and today we are going to explore the steps

07:30.880 --> 07:33.380
 start to finish of social bonding,

07:33.380 --> 07:35.700
 meaning how social bonds are established,

07:35.700 --> 07:38.020
 how they are maintained, how they are broken

07:38.020 --> 07:40.360
 and how they are reestablished.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.880
 Now an important feature of biology generally,

07:42.880 --> 07:45.760
 but in particular, as it relates to social bonding

07:45.760 --> 07:48.560
 is that the neural circuits,

07:48.560 --> 07:51.580
 meaning the brain areas and neurons and the hormones,

07:51.580 --> 07:54.360
 things like oxytocin, which we'll talk about today

07:54.360 --> 07:57.000
 and the other chemicals in the brain and body

07:57.000 --> 08:00.240
 that are responsible for the process we call social bonding

08:00.240 --> 08:04.020
 are not unique to particular social bonds.

08:04.020 --> 08:05.360
 They are generic.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.000
 What I mean by that is that the same brain circuits

08:08.000 --> 08:10.600
 that are responsible for establishing a bond

08:10.600 --> 08:14.220
 between parent and child are actually repurposed

08:14.220 --> 08:16.160
 in romantic relationships.

08:16.160 --> 08:18.640
 And this might not come as a surprise to many of you.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.620
 Many of you are probably familiar with this idea

08:20.620 --> 08:23.880
 of securely attached people versus anxious attached people

08:23.880 --> 08:25.640
 versus avoidant attached people.

08:25.640 --> 08:27.400
 We're going to touch on that a little bit,

08:27.400 --> 08:30.480
 but all of that has roots in whether or not children

08:30.480 --> 08:34.120
 and parents formed healthy social bonds

08:34.120 --> 08:37.360
 or whether or not they had challenged social bonds.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.200
 Now it's clear from the scientific

08:40.200 --> 08:42.520
 and psychological literature

08:42.520 --> 08:46.000
 that just because you might've had a not so great

08:46.000 --> 08:49.100
 or even terrible social bond with a parent

08:49.100 --> 08:52.240
 or with some other caretaker or loved one as a child,

08:52.240 --> 08:55.180
 that doesn't fate you to have poor social bonds as an adult.

08:55.180 --> 08:57.540
 There's a lot of plasticity in the system,

08:57.540 --> 08:58.960
 meaning it can change,

08:58.960 --> 09:01.480
 it can rewire in response to experience.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.140
 And as we will soon discover,

09:04.140 --> 09:07.240
 there are specific components within the neural circuits

09:07.240 --> 09:10.320
 of your brain that are responsible for social bonding

09:10.320 --> 09:13.520
 that allow you to place subjective labels

09:13.520 --> 09:15.320
 on why you are doing certain things

09:15.320 --> 09:18.020
 and to rewire the neural circuits for social bonding.

09:18.020 --> 09:19.920
 So we're going to touch on all of that today.

09:19.920 --> 09:22.540
 But the important feature really to point out

09:22.540 --> 09:25.120
 is that we don't have 12 different circuits

09:25.120 --> 09:27.820
 in the brain and body for different types of social bonds.

09:27.820 --> 09:30.840
 We have one, and there's some universal features

09:30.840 --> 09:33.640
 that underlie all forms of social bonds.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.240
 So we're going to start by exploring

09:35.240 --> 09:37.000
 what those neural circuits are.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.240
 And then we are going to see how they plug in

09:39.240 --> 09:41.280
 to different types of social bonds.

09:41.280 --> 09:44.880
 And then we are going to explore things like introversion,

09:44.880 --> 09:47.560
 extraversion, where you're going to touch on a little bit

09:47.560 --> 09:50.360
 about things like trauma bonds, healthy bonds,

09:50.360 --> 09:52.240
 and various other aspects

09:52.240 --> 09:54.600
 of how humans can bond to one another.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.280
 And as you'll soon discover,

09:56.280 --> 09:58.760
 there is a unique chemical signature

09:58.760 --> 10:01.200
 of all bonding of all kinds.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.040
 And you're going to learn

10:02.040 --> 10:04.460
 how to modulate that chemical signature.

10:04.460 --> 10:06.080
 Before we talk about social bonding,

10:06.080 --> 10:08.180
 I want to talk about its mirror image,

10:08.180 --> 10:11.680
 which is lack of social bonding or social isolation.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.860
 Now, for better or for worse,

10:13.860 --> 10:16.520
 there is a tremendous literature

10:16.520 --> 10:19.340
 on the biology of social isolation

10:19.340 --> 10:21.120
 and all of the terrible things that happen

10:21.120 --> 10:24.160
 when animals or humans are socially isolated

10:24.160 --> 10:25.900
 at particular phases of life.

10:26.740 --> 10:29.080
 Now, for those of you that are introverts,

10:29.080 --> 10:31.080
 you are not necessarily damaging yourself

10:31.080 --> 10:33.080
 by deciding to spend less time with other people.

10:33.080 --> 10:34.200
 Many people like time alone.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.080
 I personally am an introvert.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.300
 I get a thrill out of spending time

10:38.300 --> 10:40.360
 with one or two close friends,

10:40.360 --> 10:42.540
 but I enjoy a lot of time by myself.

10:42.540 --> 10:43.600
 I like to socialize,

10:43.600 --> 10:45.640
 so I wouldn't call myself an extreme introvert,

10:45.640 --> 10:47.880
 but I know there are some extreme introverts out there.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.680
 But when we talk about social isolation,

10:49.680 --> 10:54.000
 what we're referring to is when animals or humans

10:54.000 --> 10:56.980
 are restricted from having the social contacts

10:56.980 --> 10:59.160
 that they would prefer to have.

10:59.160 --> 11:02.480
 And to just briefly touch on the major takeaways

11:02.480 --> 11:05.920
 from this literature, which spans back 100 years or more,

11:07.680 --> 11:10.460
 being socially isolated is stressful.

11:10.460 --> 11:13.480
 And one of the hallmark features of social isolation

11:13.480 --> 11:16.060
 is chronically elevated stress hormones,

11:16.060 --> 11:18.040
 like adrenaline, also called epinephrine,

11:18.040 --> 11:21.680
 like cortisol, a stress hormone that at healthy levels

11:21.680 --> 11:24.020
 is good for combating inflammation,

11:24.020 --> 11:25.960
 helps us have energy early in the day,

11:25.960 --> 11:27.300
 focused throughout the day.

11:27.300 --> 11:30.240
 But if cortisol is elevated for too long,

11:30.240 --> 11:33.140
 which is the consequence of social isolation,

11:33.140 --> 11:36.240
 the immune system suffers and other chemicals

11:36.240 --> 11:38.360
 start to be released in the brain and body

11:38.360 --> 11:40.780
 that are designed to motivate the organism,

11:40.780 --> 11:43.500
 animal or human, to seek out social bonds.

11:44.800 --> 11:46.560
 An example of one such chemical

11:46.560 --> 11:48.840
 is a peptide called tachykinin.

11:48.840 --> 11:53.720
 Tachykinin is present in flies, in mice, and in humans,

11:53.720 --> 11:56.460
 and under conditions of social isolation,

11:56.460 --> 11:59.760
 its levels go up, and because of the brain areas

11:59.760 --> 12:02.400
 that contain receptors for tachykinin,

12:02.400 --> 12:06.120
 people start feeling very aggressive and irritable

12:06.120 --> 12:07.920
 after social isolation.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.040
 Now, that should be a little bit counterintuitive to you.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.160
 You would think, oh, if you isolate an animal or human,

12:13.160 --> 12:14.820
 and then you give them the opportunity

12:14.820 --> 12:17.280
 for social interaction, they should behave very well,

12:17.280 --> 12:18.120
 they should be thrilled,

12:18.120 --> 12:19.960
 they're finally getting the nourishment,

12:19.960 --> 12:21.900
 the social nourishment that they've been lacking

12:21.900 --> 12:24.200
 for so long, it turns out that's not the case.

12:24.200 --> 12:27.560
 Chronic social isolation changes the nature

12:27.560 --> 12:29.760
 of the brain and body such that it makes

12:29.760 --> 12:31.760
 social connection harder,

12:31.760 --> 12:35.000
 and it makes the person who's been isolated irritable,

12:35.000 --> 12:37.560
 even aggressive with other people.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.900
 Now, I don't want to go too deeply

12:38.900 --> 12:41.580
 into the biology of social isolation,

12:41.580 --> 12:43.920
 because it doesn't actually afford us that much insight

12:43.920 --> 12:46.520
 into what healthy social bonding looks like.

12:46.520 --> 12:48.320
 So today we're going to focus more

12:48.320 --> 12:50.820
 on the functional biology,

12:50.820 --> 12:52.240
 dual meaning of the word functional,

12:52.240 --> 12:55.920
 as opposed to the pathology of social isolation.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.060
 However, I do want to point out

12:58.060 --> 13:01.720
 that social isolation starts to deteriorate

13:01.720 --> 13:05.440
 certain aspects of brain and body pretty quickly,

13:05.440 --> 13:07.600
 but how quickly depends, again,

13:07.600 --> 13:09.960
 on how introverted or extroverted somebody is.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.000
 So if you're somebody who's socially isolated

13:12.000 --> 13:13.920
 for the holidays or has been socially isolated

13:13.920 --> 13:16.960
 for a period of time and is craving social contact,

13:16.960 --> 13:18.440
 that is a healthy craving.

13:18.440 --> 13:20.360
 And as we'll learn next,

13:20.360 --> 13:22.400
 the healthy craving for social contact

13:22.400 --> 13:24.120
 has a very specific brain circuit,

13:24.120 --> 13:26.120
 has a very specific neurochemical signature

13:26.120 --> 13:27.240
 associated with it,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.400
 and has some remarkable features

13:29.400 --> 13:32.960
 that you can leverage in social contacts of all kinds.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.760
 I think some of the more important and exciting work

13:35.760 --> 13:40.040
 on social bonding comes from the laboratory of Kay Tai.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.040
 Kay is a professor

13:41.040 --> 13:43.220
 at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies.

13:43.220 --> 13:44.880
 She's an investigator with the Howard Hughes

13:44.880 --> 13:46.240
 Medical Institute.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.700
 And in recent years,

13:47.700 --> 13:49.840
 I would say in about the last five or six years,

13:49.840 --> 13:53.240
 her laboratory has made a fundamental discovery

13:53.240 --> 13:55.500
 as to why we seek out

13:55.500 --> 13:58.420
 and put so much effort into social bonds.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.000
 And the key discovery that she made

14:01.000 --> 14:04.600
 is that much like hunger, much like temperature,

14:04.600 --> 14:06.520
 much like thirst,

14:06.520 --> 14:09.140
 we have brain circuits that are devoted

14:09.140 --> 14:12.880
 to what's called a social homeostasis.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.320
 Many of you have probably heard about homeostasis before.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.320
 Homeostasis is the characteristic

14:18.320 --> 14:21.240
 of various biological circuits and even individual cells

14:21.240 --> 14:23.480
 to try and maintain a certain level.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.840
 It's most easily thought of in the context of hunger.

14:25.840 --> 14:26.820
 If you don't eat for a while,

14:26.820 --> 14:29.520
 your drive to pursue food and think about food

14:29.520 --> 14:33.160
 and make food and spend money on food,

14:33.160 --> 14:36.160
 and indeed to enjoy food goes up.

14:36.160 --> 14:37.800
 Whereas when you're well-fed,

14:37.800 --> 14:39.720
 you don't tend to seek out food

14:39.720 --> 14:42.080
 with as much vigor or as much intensity.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.900
 You wouldn't invest as much time, effort, money, et cetera.

14:44.900 --> 14:48.280
 So homeostasis is the aspect of cells, tissues,

14:48.280 --> 14:50.980
 and organisms to seek some sort of balance,

14:50.980 --> 14:53.240
 to regulate themselves.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.080
 In a crude way,

14:54.080 --> 14:56.060
 you can think about the thermostat on your home

14:56.060 --> 14:57.680
 as a homeostatic circuit.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.200
 When the temperature goes up a little bit,

14:59.200 --> 15:01.640
 it cools things down to maintain a certain temperature.

15:01.640 --> 15:05.400
 When the room gets cold, it hits a certain level

15:05.400 --> 15:07.920
 and a sensor detects that, it clicks on,

15:07.920 --> 15:08.840
 and then the heat goes on

15:08.840 --> 15:10.880
 to maintain a certain set temperature.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.880
 So that's a simple way of thinking about homeostasis.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.080
 Every homeostatic circuit has three components,

15:17.080 --> 15:18.240
 or at least three.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.960
 One is a detector,

15:19.960 --> 15:23.360
 meaning the organism or the thermostat on your wall

15:23.360 --> 15:25.120
 has to have some way of detecting

15:25.120 --> 15:27.840
 what's going on in the environment, all right?

15:27.840 --> 15:30.120
 In the context of social bonding,

15:30.120 --> 15:32.040
 whether or not you are interacting with others

15:32.040 --> 15:33.860
 and whether or not those interactions are going well.

15:33.860 --> 15:36.200
 So that has to be detected, that's the first thing.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.740
 Then there has to be a control center,

15:37.740 --> 15:39.280
 that's the second thing.

15:39.280 --> 15:42.920
 And the control center is the one that makes the adjustments

15:42.920 --> 15:44.920
 to, in the case of social bonding,

15:44.920 --> 15:47.320
 to your behavior and to your psychology.

15:47.320 --> 15:49.720
 So you'll soon learn that there are ways

15:49.720 --> 15:52.160
 in which the more time that you spend alone,

15:52.160 --> 15:54.920
 the more motivated you are to seek out

15:54.920 --> 15:59.100
 the pictures of faces, the interactions with actual people,

15:59.100 --> 16:01.320
 physical contact, and so forth.

16:01.320 --> 16:02.960
 Now that might seem obvious to you,

16:02.960 --> 16:05.740
 but thanks to the work of Keitai and others,

16:06.980 --> 16:08.080
 it's remarkable to learn

16:08.080 --> 16:09.800
 that there are specific brain centers

16:09.800 --> 16:11.900
 that are adjusting our psychology and biology

16:11.900 --> 16:14.560
 so that we seek out bonds more aggressively,

16:14.560 --> 16:18.320
 or maybe we don't because we are perfectly sated

16:18.320 --> 16:21.320
 or satiated with respect to how much contact

16:21.320 --> 16:22.720
 we've had with other people.

16:23.600 --> 16:26.820
 Now, the third component of this homeostatic circuit

16:26.820 --> 16:28.160
 is the effector.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.280
 The effector is actually what drives

16:30.280 --> 16:32.200
 the behavioral response.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.640
 It's what leads you to pick up your social media

16:34.640 --> 16:35.460
 and start scrolling.

16:35.460 --> 16:37.020
 It's what leads you to text a friend.

16:37.020 --> 16:40.040
 It's what leads you to call a friend or make plans

16:40.040 --> 16:42.640
 and what leads you to follow through on those plans.

16:42.640 --> 16:45.520
 So again, those three components are a detector,

16:45.520 --> 16:48.520
 a control center, and an effector.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.000
 And as you'll soon learn,

16:50.000 --> 16:53.600
 the neural circuit that controls this social homeostasis

16:53.600 --> 16:55.240
 actually has a fourth component.

16:55.240 --> 16:57.280
 And that fourth component is one

16:57.280 --> 16:59.520
 that places subjective understanding

16:59.520 --> 17:01.840
 as to why you are doing what you are doing

17:01.840 --> 17:06.840
 and establishes your place in a hierarchy.

17:06.900 --> 17:08.020
 Now, I know the word hierarchy

17:08.020 --> 17:10.500
 can be a little bit of a barbed wire one

17:10.500 --> 17:12.120
 because people immediately start thinking

17:12.120 --> 17:16.020
 about boss and subordinate or in couples,

17:16.020 --> 17:17.600
 a leader and a follower.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.960
 But when we talk about social hierarchies

17:19.960 --> 17:21.780
 in the context of human interactions,

17:21.780 --> 17:24.920
 social hierarchies are very plastic,

17:24.920 --> 17:28.060
 meaning in one setting, one person can be the leader.

17:28.060 --> 17:30.420
 In another setting, the other person can be the leader.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.720
 You probably have groups of friends or family members

17:32.720 --> 17:34.920
 where you're constantly passing the baton

17:34.920 --> 17:37.800
 as to who's going to drive, who's going to navigate,

17:37.800 --> 17:40.400
 who's going to pick the restaurant,

17:40.400 --> 17:42.140
 who's going to clear the dishes,

17:42.140 --> 17:44.640
 and who's going to do certain activities and not others.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.880
 So hierarchies are very dynamic.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.280
 And as a consequence,

17:48.280 --> 17:52.040
 social bonding has to be very plastic and very fluid

17:52.040 --> 17:54.440
 so that you move from one environment to the next,

17:54.440 --> 17:55.880
 even with the same people,

17:55.880 --> 17:58.120
 you have to be able to make those adjustments.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.020
 And in the case of the social homeostasis circuit,

18:01.020 --> 18:04.020
 those adjustments are made by a particular brain structure.

18:04.020 --> 18:05.540
 I've talked about in this podcast before,

18:05.540 --> 18:07.140
 it's called the prefrontal cortex.

18:07.140 --> 18:09.980
 It is the seat of our higher consciousness, if you will.

18:09.980 --> 18:13.040
 It's what allows us to play subjective labels on things

18:13.040 --> 18:16.800
 so we are not strictly input-output, we're not robotic.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.400
 Meaning if you go to dinner with a friend

18:19.400 --> 18:22.020
 and they are exceptional at choosing restaurants,

18:22.020 --> 18:24.880
 well, in the context of the social homeostasis circuit,

18:24.880 --> 18:26.500
 your prefrontal cortex would allow them

18:26.500 --> 18:28.600
 to pick the restaurant because basically

18:28.600 --> 18:31.160
 they are dominant over you in their capacity

18:31.160 --> 18:34.020
 to pick good restaurants, at least in this example.

18:34.020 --> 18:36.160
 Whereas as you leave that restaurant

18:36.160 --> 18:37.380
 and perhaps you are navigating

18:37.380 --> 18:39.840
 to where to get a drink after dinner

18:39.840 --> 18:41.560
 or where to walk through the city,

18:41.560 --> 18:43.480
 perhaps you have the better sense of direction.

18:43.480 --> 18:47.080
 And so then the social bonding has to be maintained

18:47.080 --> 18:49.360
 as you switch the hierarchy, okay?

18:49.360 --> 18:51.200
 So that's the role of that fourth element,

18:51.200 --> 18:52.600
 the prefrontal cortex.

18:52.600 --> 18:56.220
 Now, I just briefly want to touch on some of the brain areas

18:56.220 --> 18:58.760
 that thanks to the work of Keitai and others,

18:58.760 --> 19:03.640
 we now know underlie the detection, control, and response.

19:03.640 --> 19:06.600
 Okay, I call them the detector, control center, and effector

19:06.600 --> 19:08.400
 because inside of that description

19:08.400 --> 19:11.140
 isn't just a bunch of names of neural structures.

19:11.140 --> 19:12.280
 There are also hints

19:12.280 --> 19:14.920
 as to what the underlying neurochemicals are.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.440
 And by understanding what the neurochemicals are,

19:17.440 --> 19:19.740
 you can start to think about tools that you can use

19:19.740 --> 19:22.960
 to form social bonds and maintain social bonds

19:22.960 --> 19:24.640
 in better, healthier ways.

19:24.640 --> 19:26.760
 So let's talk about the detector first.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.760
 Now, keep in mind that you have your senses.

19:28.760 --> 19:30.540
 You have your vision, you have your hearing,

19:30.540 --> 19:33.360
 you have touch, you have smell, you have taste.

19:33.360 --> 19:36.000
 Sensation, as I've talked about many times before

19:36.000 --> 19:37.840
 in the podcast, but I'll just remind you,

19:37.840 --> 19:41.520
 sensation is the conversion of physical stimuli

19:41.520 --> 19:44.480
 in the environment into electrical and chemical signals

19:44.480 --> 19:45.580
 in your nervous system.

19:45.580 --> 19:46.720
 The language of the nervous system

19:46.720 --> 19:48.520
 is electrical and chemical signals.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.160
 So photons of light are converted

19:50.160 --> 19:51.520
 to electrical and chemical signals.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.080
 Pressure on the skin or light touch on the skin

19:54.080 --> 19:56.120
 is converted into electrical and chemical signals

19:56.120 --> 19:57.440
 and so on and so forth.

19:57.440 --> 20:00.500
 So all of that, of course, is flowing into the nervous system

20:00.500 --> 20:04.640
 but the detector that underlies social homeostasis

20:04.640 --> 20:06.920
 involves mainly two structures.

20:06.920 --> 20:09.360
 One is called the ACC, the anterior cingulate cortex,

20:09.360 --> 20:12.120
 and the other is the BLA, basolateral amygdala.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.240
 And when you hear the word amygdala,

20:13.240 --> 20:14.900
 you're probably thinking fear.

20:14.900 --> 20:16.420
 But today, as you'll see,

20:16.420 --> 20:18.800
 the amygdala actually has many different subcompartments

20:18.800 --> 20:19.920
 and components.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.600
 And there's a reason why the basolateral amygdala,

20:22.600 --> 20:25.160
 which is associated with certain aspects

20:25.160 --> 20:27.600
 of aversive behaviors, meaning moving away

20:27.600 --> 20:29.880
 from certain types of things or interactions,

20:29.880 --> 20:32.760
 there's a reason why the BLA is such an integral part

20:32.760 --> 20:34.640
 of the detector system.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.080
 And that's because just as it's important to form

20:37.080 --> 20:39.640
 healthy social bonds, it's vitally important

20:39.640 --> 20:42.520
 to try and avoid unhealthy social bonds.

20:42.520 --> 20:45.200
 And so the basolateral amygdala is mainly associated

20:45.200 --> 20:47.160
 with these aversive type responses

20:47.160 --> 20:49.580
 of just moving away from certain things.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.220
 The control center in the social homeostasis circuit

20:54.220 --> 20:56.880
 involves a brain area called the lateral hypothalamus

20:56.880 --> 21:00.120
 and the periventricular hypothalamus.

21:00.120 --> 21:03.600
 The lateral hypothalamus and the periventricular hypothalamus

21:03.600 --> 21:08.560
 contain neurons that are able to access the hormone system

21:08.560 --> 21:11.560
 in order to influence the release of things like oxytocin,

21:11.560 --> 21:13.680
 which is a hormone neuropeptide.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.000
 It's kind of part hormone, part neurotransmitter.

21:16.000 --> 21:16.840
 It's kind of a hybrid.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.400
 We're going to talk a lot about oxytocin today.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.600
 So we've got the ACC and the BLA.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.100
 These are areas that are mainly involved

21:23.100 --> 21:25.840
 in moving away from things, although also toward them.

21:25.840 --> 21:26.660
 That's the detector.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.200
 Then we've got the control center,

21:28.200 --> 21:30.040
 which is in the hypothalamus.

21:30.040 --> 21:34.240
 And then there's a very special and important area

21:34.240 --> 21:37.420
 associated with social bonding that I want everyone to learn,

21:37.420 --> 21:40.840
 which is the dorsal raphe nucleus or DRN,

21:40.840 --> 21:42.000
 dorsal raphe nucleus.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.760
 The dorsal raphe nucleus is a small collection of neurons

21:44.760 --> 21:47.820
 in the midbrain, so it's deep in the brain.

21:47.820 --> 21:50.880
 And most of the time when you hear about raphe,

21:50.880 --> 21:54.700
 R-A-P-H-E, by the way, raphe nucleus,

21:54.700 --> 21:56.360
 you're talking about serotonin.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.280
 Serotonin is a neuromodulator that is often associated

21:59.280 --> 22:03.080
 with feelings of satiety after eating, warmth,

22:03.080 --> 22:06.820
 basically satisfaction with things that you already have.

22:07.720 --> 22:10.740
 However, within this dorsal raphe nucleus,

22:10.740 --> 22:14.680
 there is a small subset of neurons that release dopamine.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.120
 Dopamine is a neuromodulator most often associated

22:17.120 --> 22:21.000
 with movement, craving, motivation, and desire.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.340
 And the neural circuits that are rich with dopamine

22:24.340 --> 22:26.040
 are things like the substantia nigra,

22:26.040 --> 22:28.840
 the mesolimbic dopamine system, the VTA,

22:28.840 --> 22:30.120
 the nucleus accumbens, et cetera.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.040
 Those names don't have to mean anything to you.

22:32.040 --> 22:35.800
 However, this unique population of dopamine neurons

22:35.800 --> 22:39.600
 in the raphe is truly unique in that it's responsible

22:39.600 --> 22:43.180
 for mediating what I've been calling social homeostasis.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.800
 It is the effector or the response

22:46.800 --> 22:48.820
 that mediates social homeostasis.

22:48.820 --> 22:51.920
 Now, I haven't told you exactly what social homeostasis is.

22:51.920 --> 22:54.800
 Social homeostasis, just like hunger,

22:54.800 --> 22:59.420
 is the process by which when you lack social interaction,

22:59.420 --> 23:00.700
 you start to crave it.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.440
 What's very interesting about the fact

23:03.440 --> 23:06.680
 that there are dopamine neurons in this raphe structure

23:06.680 --> 23:10.400
 that is the effector for social homeostasis

23:10.400 --> 23:15.400
 is that what this means is that when you are not interacting

23:15.540 --> 23:18.660
 with people at a frequency or intensity

23:18.660 --> 23:23.660
 that is right for you, dopamine is released into the brain.

23:23.660 --> 23:26.300
 In most popular conversations about dopamine

23:26.300 --> 23:28.020
 and even in scientific circles,

23:28.020 --> 23:29.400
 when you hear dopamine release,

23:29.400 --> 23:31.620
 you think about reward or feeling good

23:31.620 --> 23:33.180
 because indeed many behaviors

23:33.180 --> 23:36.160
 and drugs of abuse increase dopamine.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.000
 That's one of the reasons

23:37.000 --> 23:39.240
 they have so much addictive potential.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.380
 However, dopamine is not associated with feeling good.

23:42.380 --> 23:45.440
 It is actually the neurochemical that's responsible

23:45.440 --> 23:48.960
 for movement toward things that feel good.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.820
 So to zoom out and conceptualize what we have here,

23:51.820 --> 23:54.420
 we have a brain area that is a detector

23:54.420 --> 23:56.340
 that either will move us toward or away

23:56.340 --> 23:59.860
 from certain types of experiences or sensations.

24:00.840 --> 24:03.500
 We have a control center that is going to release

24:03.500 --> 24:06.700
 certain hormones and neuropeptides into our brain and blood

24:06.700 --> 24:08.400
 depending on the sorts of interactions

24:08.400 --> 24:10.220
 that we happen to be having.

24:10.220 --> 24:12.500
 And we have this response system,

24:12.500 --> 24:14.460
 which is the dorsal raphe nucleus

24:14.460 --> 24:15.940
 that contains dopamine neurons.

24:15.940 --> 24:19.220
 And when we are not interacting with people

24:19.220 --> 24:22.100
 at the frequency or intensity that we crave,

24:22.100 --> 24:25.240
 dopamine is released and that dopamine causes us

24:25.240 --> 24:28.840
 to seek out social interactions of particular kinds.

24:28.840 --> 24:31.480
 So let's talk about what social homeostasis is

24:31.480 --> 24:32.740
 and how it plays out.

24:32.740 --> 24:35.380
 And again, let's use hunger as an example.

24:35.380 --> 24:37.020
 So let's say you're a person

24:37.020 --> 24:40.140
 who eats every three or four hours regularly.

24:40.140 --> 24:41.900
 So on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,

24:41.900 --> 24:44.880
 you're just accustomed to eating every three or four hours.

24:44.880 --> 24:49.380
 If just suddenly I steal your meal out of the fridge

24:49.380 --> 24:50.780
 at work, something I would not do,

24:50.780 --> 24:53.540
 but just for sake of mental experimentation,

24:54.760 --> 24:57.840
 that would probably cause you to go and seek out food

24:57.840 --> 24:58.740
 through some other route.

24:58.740 --> 25:00.740
 You might buy food, you'd probably be upset first,

25:00.740 --> 25:02.480
 but then you go buy food or replace the food

25:02.480 --> 25:03.320
 that you were going to eat.

25:03.320 --> 25:04.320
 You'd be hungry for that food.

25:04.320 --> 25:08.280
 And indeed there are hormonal type mechanisms

25:08.280 --> 25:11.320
 and other mechanisms that when we eat regularly

25:11.320 --> 25:13.040
 and we predict that food is coming in,

25:13.040 --> 25:14.540
 we actually start secreting insulin,

25:14.540 --> 25:16.460
 which is for mobilizing blood sugar,

25:16.460 --> 25:18.260
 there are hormones in the bloodstream

25:18.260 --> 25:21.500
 that make us hungry on a regular clock-like schedule,

25:21.500 --> 25:24.200
 and you would seek out more food.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.940
 Similarly, if you're somebody who is accustomed

25:26.940 --> 25:29.860
 to a lot of social interaction,

25:29.860 --> 25:33.520
 and suddenly I take away that social interaction,

25:33.520 --> 25:35.420
 you would feel kind of let down.

25:35.420 --> 25:39.020
 You would crave a replacement social interaction.

25:39.020 --> 25:41.420
 You might be upset that you had a lunch date with a friend,

25:41.420 --> 25:43.500
 you're used to having lunch with them every Wednesday,

25:43.500 --> 25:47.280
 and they cancel and you would crave the interaction, okay?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.500
 This is called a prosocial craving.

25:49.500 --> 25:52.540
 And indeed, this is what you see in animals and humans.

25:52.540 --> 25:56.340
 If you, what's called acutely isolate them,

25:56.340 --> 25:58.220
 which is just a fancy scientific word of saying,

25:58.220 --> 26:01.900
 deprive them of social interactions in a short-term basis,

26:01.900 --> 26:04.260
 they start engaging in prosocial behaviors.

26:04.260 --> 26:05.400
 They start texting other people,

26:05.400 --> 26:08.020
 they start seeking out social interactions

26:08.020 --> 26:11.460
 of different kinds, and that makes perfect sense, right?

26:11.460 --> 26:13.940
 But thought of from a different side,

26:13.940 --> 26:16.400
 you could also imagine how, well,

26:16.400 --> 26:18.380
 if you're getting a social interaction

26:18.380 --> 26:20.180
 with somebody on a daily or weekly basis,

26:20.180 --> 26:22.740
 and suddenly you remove that interaction,

26:22.740 --> 26:24.820
 well, then people might not care.

26:24.820 --> 26:25.660
 They might just think, well,

26:25.660 --> 26:27.180
 I'll get the interaction tomorrow or the next year

26:27.180 --> 26:28.860
 or the next day because they're sated,

26:28.860 --> 26:31.180
 much in the same way that the person who eats very regularly

26:31.180 --> 26:32.740
 might say, well, I ate four hours ago

26:32.740 --> 26:34.280
 and I'll eat eight hours later, no big deal.

26:34.280 --> 26:35.860
 But that's not what happens.

26:35.860 --> 26:38.400
 There's a prediction that we are going to have

26:38.400 --> 26:39.900
 certain types of interactions,

26:39.900 --> 26:42.460
 and when those interactions don't happen,

26:42.460 --> 26:44.540
 we replace that lack of interaction

26:44.540 --> 26:46.260
 with a drive and a motivation

26:46.260 --> 26:48.620
 to seek out social interaction.

26:48.620 --> 26:52.020
 And that drive and motivation is caused by,

26:52.020 --> 26:54.700
 or I should say is driven by dopamine release

26:54.700 --> 26:56.500
 from that dorsal raphe.

26:56.500 --> 27:00.100
 And so the takeaway is that when we lack social interaction

27:00.100 --> 27:03.060
 that we expect, we become prosocial.

27:03.060 --> 27:07.400
 However, if we are chronically socially isolated,

27:07.400 --> 27:09.580
 meaning we don't have interactions with people

27:09.580 --> 27:13.520
 for a long time, we become actually more introverted.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.900
 This is separate from all of the tacky kind and stuff

27:15.900 --> 27:16.980
 that I talked about earlier

27:16.980 --> 27:19.020
 or falling into states of chronic stress,

27:19.020 --> 27:22.280
 but it's well-established now that in humans and in animals,

27:23.220 --> 27:25.860
 if you don't give them enough social interaction,

27:25.860 --> 27:28.060
 they actually become antisocial.

27:28.060 --> 27:29.940
 And so this is actually a little bit like

27:29.940 --> 27:33.020
 what one might see with long-term fasting, okay?

27:33.020 --> 27:34.820
 I give the example of eating every four hours.

27:34.820 --> 27:38.140
 Now let's give the parallel example of somebody

27:38.140 --> 27:41.140
 who's been fasting perhaps for two or three days.

27:41.140 --> 27:42.940
 If they are expecting to eat

27:42.940 --> 27:45.460
 and then the meal doesn't arrive,

27:45.460 --> 27:48.500
 they are not necessarily going to immediately

27:48.500 --> 27:49.900
 try and seek out food.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.160
 And that's a little bit counterintuitive.

27:51.160 --> 27:52.000
 You would have thought,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.180
 well, they haven't eaten in a very long time.

27:53.180 --> 27:55.460
 They're going to be very motivated to seek out food,

27:55.460 --> 27:57.960
 but no, they are accustomed to fasting.

27:57.960 --> 28:01.780
 Similarly, the social homeostasis circuit works in a way

28:01.780 --> 28:04.380
 such that when we don't have social interactions

28:04.380 --> 28:05.820
 for a very long time,

28:05.820 --> 28:09.720
 we start to lose our craving for social interactions.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.720
 Let's look at the social homeostasis circuit

28:11.720 --> 28:13.660
 through the lens of what's commonly called

28:13.660 --> 28:16.420
 introversion and extroversion.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.300
 Now, typically when we hear about introverts,

28:18.300 --> 28:20.300
 we think about the quiet person at the party

28:20.300 --> 28:22.140
 or the person that doesn't want to go out at all.

28:22.140 --> 28:23.480
 And we think about an extrovert

28:23.480 --> 28:24.900
 as somebody who's really social,

28:24.900 --> 28:26.540
 the so-called social butterfly,

28:26.540 --> 28:29.260
 who enjoys social interactions, is really chatty,

28:29.260 --> 28:31.000
 is kind of life of the party type person.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.940
 That's the cliche or the kind of pop psychology cliche.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.920
 But actually in the psychology literature,

28:35.920 --> 28:37.860
 that's not really the way it holds up.

28:38.900 --> 28:42.380
 Many people who appear introverted are actually extroverted.

28:42.380 --> 28:46.900
 The quiet person at a party could be an extrovert,

28:46.900 --> 28:49.420
 except that they just don't talk very much.

28:49.420 --> 28:51.740
 The characteristic of an extrovert is somebody

28:51.740 --> 28:55.100
 that gets energy or feels good from social interactions.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.380
 They sort of get a lift.

28:56.380 --> 28:59.020
 And we can predict that that lift occurs

28:59.020 --> 29:01.060
 because of some release of dopamine

29:01.060 --> 29:02.140
 within their brain and body.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.460
 And indeed there's evidence for that.

29:03.460 --> 29:05.520
 Neuroimaging studies support that.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.580
 Other forms of neurobiological analysis

29:07.580 --> 29:09.100
 support that as well.

29:09.100 --> 29:12.300
 We can also imagine that the person who's talking a lot

29:12.300 --> 29:14.500
 is somebody who's very extroverted.

29:14.500 --> 29:17.420
 But oftentimes people who talk a lot for their work

29:17.420 --> 29:19.500
 or they're somebody who's very social

29:19.500 --> 29:21.100
 when you interact with them,

29:21.100 --> 29:22.620
 that person gets back to their car

29:22.620 --> 29:25.580
 and is absolutely depleted and exhausted by that interaction

29:25.580 --> 29:28.400
 or all sorts of social interactions.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.020
 So we really can't predict whether or not somebody

29:31.020 --> 29:32.620
 is an introvert or an extrovert

29:32.620 --> 29:34.060
 simply based on their behavior.

29:34.060 --> 29:37.120
 It's really more of an internal subjective label.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.540
 However, if we look at introversion and extroversion

29:39.540 --> 29:42.940
 through this lens of the social homeostatic set point,

29:42.940 --> 29:45.700
 and we think about dopamine as this molecule

29:45.700 --> 29:49.360
 that drives motivation to seek out social interactions,

29:50.400 --> 29:54.660
 what we can reasonably assume is that introverts are people

29:54.660 --> 29:57.080
 that when they engage in certain forms

29:57.080 --> 29:58.840
 of social interaction,

29:58.840 --> 30:01.920
 either the amount of dopamine that's released

30:01.920 --> 30:04.980
 is greater than it is in an extrovert.

30:04.980 --> 30:07.420
 That's right, I said greater than it is in an extrovert.

30:07.420 --> 30:10.000
 And so they actually feel quite motivated

30:10.000 --> 30:12.920
 but also satisfied by very brief

30:12.920 --> 30:17.260
 or we could say sort of sparse social interactions.

30:17.260 --> 30:20.520
 They don't need a lot of social engagement to feel sated.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.740
 Again, the parallel example will be hunger.

30:22.740 --> 30:25.000
 This would be somebody who doesn't need to eat much

30:25.000 --> 30:26.900
 in order to feel satisfied.

30:26.900 --> 30:30.540
 Whereas the extrovert, we can reasonably assume

30:30.540 --> 30:32.480
 releases less dopamine

30:32.480 --> 30:35.100
 in response to an individual social interaction.

30:35.100 --> 30:37.300
 And so they need much more social interaction

30:37.300 --> 30:40.500
 in order to feel filled up by that interaction.

30:40.500 --> 30:41.580
 And indeed, this is supported

30:41.580 --> 30:43.820
 by the neurobiological imaging studies.

30:43.820 --> 30:46.220
 So rather than thinking about introverts and extroverts

30:46.220 --> 30:47.780
 as chatty versus quiet,

30:48.980 --> 30:52.220
 it's useful to think about people, maybe yourself,

30:52.220 --> 30:53.820
 maybe other people you know,

30:53.820 --> 30:56.340
 as how much social interaction they need

30:56.340 --> 30:59.660
 in order to bring the social homeostasis into balance.

30:59.660 --> 31:01.020
 Now there's the fourth component

31:01.020 --> 31:03.420
 of this social homeostasis circuit that I mentioned before

31:03.420 --> 31:05.180
 and that's the prefrontal cortex.

31:05.180 --> 31:07.240
 The prefrontal cortex is involved in thinking

31:07.240 --> 31:08.620
 and planning and action,

31:08.620 --> 31:11.580
 and has extensive connections with areas of the brain

31:11.580 --> 31:13.260
 like the hypothalamus,

31:13.260 --> 31:16.660
 which is responsible for a lot of motivated drives.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.020
 It also has connections

31:18.020 --> 31:19.740
 with the various reward centers of the brain

31:19.740 --> 31:22.480
 and it can act as kind of an accelerator,

31:22.480 --> 31:25.500
 meaning it can encourage more electrical activity

31:25.500 --> 31:29.320
 of other brain centers or as a brake on those brain centers.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.900
 Really good example, it's kind of a trivial one

31:31.900 --> 31:33.360
 in the context of today's discussion,

31:33.360 --> 31:35.160
 but it's a concrete one, so I'll use it,

31:35.160 --> 31:38.680
 would be, I know many people out there use cold showers

31:38.680 --> 31:40.180
 as a way to stimulate metabolism

31:40.180 --> 31:42.180
 and build up resilience and this sort of thing.

31:42.180 --> 31:44.140
 If you get into a very cold shower

31:44.140 --> 31:46.740
 and you feel as if you want to get out,

31:46.740 --> 31:48.440
 but you force yourself to stay in,

31:49.300 --> 31:50.560
 you're forcing yourself to stay in

31:50.560 --> 31:51.880
 because your prefrontal cortex

31:51.880 --> 31:54.660
 is placing some subjective label on that experience.

31:54.660 --> 31:56.660
 Either you're doing it for a certain benefit

31:56.660 --> 31:59.600
 or you've got a timer and you're using the timer

31:59.600 --> 32:01.700
 as the regulator of how long you're going to stay in,

32:01.700 --> 32:03.500
 basically you're overriding reflexes

32:03.500 --> 32:06.720
 and that's the main function of the prefrontal cortex.

32:06.720 --> 32:07.620
 But as I mentioned earlier,

32:07.620 --> 32:09.580
 the prefrontal cortex components

32:09.580 --> 32:12.180
 that wire into the social homeostasis circuit

32:12.180 --> 32:14.140
 are responsible for evaluating

32:14.140 --> 32:16.380
 where you are in a given hierarchy.

32:16.380 --> 32:19.180
 And that affords you a ton of flexibility

32:19.180 --> 32:20.980
 in terms of the types of social interactions

32:20.980 --> 32:21.900
 that you can engage in

32:21.900 --> 32:24.380
 and whether or not you're going to spend time

32:24.380 --> 32:26.060
 with certain people or not,

32:26.060 --> 32:28.020
 whether or not you're going to engage and then disengage.

32:28.020 --> 32:28.900
 What do I mean by this?

32:28.900 --> 32:31.200
 Well, let's say you're an extroverted person.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.480
 You're somebody that likes a lot of social interaction

32:33.480 --> 32:36.940
 and you get a lot of dopamine release on whole

32:36.940 --> 32:38.420
 from a lot of social interaction.

32:38.420 --> 32:41.340
 So maybe one interaction with a teller at the supermarket

32:41.340 --> 32:43.220
 isn't really going to give you much dopamine,

32:43.220 --> 32:45.660
 but going to a party will give you more dopamine

32:45.660 --> 32:48.980
 and so you seek out these larger social interactions.

32:48.980 --> 32:50.880
 However, you might go to a party

32:50.880 --> 32:52.960
 where somebody says something or you see somebody there

32:52.960 --> 32:54.660
 that you'd much prefer not to see

32:54.660 --> 32:56.440
 and therefore you decide to leave.

32:57.480 --> 32:59.380
 The deciding to leave is regulated

32:59.380 --> 33:01.540
 by that prefrontal cortex component.

33:01.540 --> 33:03.340
 So it's important to understand

33:03.340 --> 33:05.300
 that just because there's a homeostatic circuit

33:05.300 --> 33:07.940
 that involves areas like the amygdala and the hypothalamus

33:07.940 --> 33:10.680
 and these deep brain regions like the dorsal raphe,

33:11.740 --> 33:12.580
 as a human being,

33:12.580 --> 33:14.660
 you have flexibility over your social interactions

33:14.660 --> 33:17.580
 and that flexibility arrives from those prefrontal circuits.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.120
 So there's a ton of subjective nature to it.

33:20.120 --> 33:21.900
 There's a lot of context to it.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.620
 So while there are some predictable elements

33:24.620 --> 33:25.580
 of these circuits,

33:25.580 --> 33:28.200
 they are not simply what we would call plug and chug.

33:28.200 --> 33:29.380
 You have flexibility.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.340
 You are able to say, you know, I love parties,

33:31.340 --> 33:32.960
 but I really don't want to go to that party

33:32.960 --> 33:34.220
 because so-and-so is there.

33:34.220 --> 33:38.060
 Or I very much don't like going across town in traffic,

33:38.060 --> 33:39.300
 but I'm going to do it today

33:39.300 --> 33:41.620
 because a certain collection of people

33:41.620 --> 33:43.820
 or perhaps a certain individual

33:43.820 --> 33:45.380
 will be at that particular party.

33:45.380 --> 33:47.020
 And so the prefrontal cortex again

33:47.020 --> 33:49.620
 is what allows you that subjective ruling

33:49.620 --> 33:52.840
 or ruling over what would otherwise just be reflexes.

33:52.840 --> 33:55.060
 So now I'd like to drill a little bit deeper

33:55.060 --> 33:57.680
 into this incredible neural structure

33:57.680 --> 33:59.780
 that is the dorsal raphe nucleus

33:59.780 --> 34:02.140
 and the small collection of neurons,

34:02.140 --> 34:03.980
 the dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe,

34:03.980 --> 34:05.300
 because while it's a small collection,

34:05.300 --> 34:06.700
 they are very powerful.

34:08.380 --> 34:11.780
 Loneliness has been defined by the great psychologists,

34:11.780 --> 34:15.060
 John Cacioppo, as the distress that results

34:15.060 --> 34:16.820
 from discrepancies between ideal

34:16.820 --> 34:18.580
 and perceived social relationships.

34:18.580 --> 34:19.400
 Let me repeat that.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.860
 Loneliness is not just being isolated.

34:21.860 --> 34:24.720
 Loneliness, as he defines it,

34:24.720 --> 34:27.300
 is the distress that results from discrepancies

34:27.300 --> 34:30.060
 between ideal and perceived social relationships.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.980
 It's when we expect things to be one way

34:31.980 --> 34:33.580
 and they're actually another way.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.980
 And which way we expect them to be

34:35.980 --> 34:39.060
 and which way they turn out, again, is highly subjective.

34:39.060 --> 34:40.900
 What you expect from friendships

34:40.900 --> 34:42.420
 and what other people expect from friendships

34:42.420 --> 34:43.780
 could be entirely different,

34:43.780 --> 34:46.220
 but the circuit that underlies friendship bonding

34:46.220 --> 34:47.660
 is exactly the same.

34:47.660 --> 34:50.000
 And it is this dorsal raphe nucleus

34:50.000 --> 34:51.720
 and the dopamine neurons in that nucleus

34:51.720 --> 34:54.100
 that underlie the bond that is social friendship

34:54.100 --> 34:56.020
 and all types of social bonds.

34:56.020 --> 34:58.340
 There's a key finding in the literature.

34:58.340 --> 34:59.460
 The title of this paper is

34:59.460 --> 35:01.060
 Dorsal Raphe Dopamine Neurons

35:01.060 --> 35:03.940
 Represent the Experience of Social Isolation.

35:03.940 --> 35:05.660
 This is a paper from Kay Tye's lab.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.220
 The first author is Matthews,

35:07.220 --> 35:09.540
 Gillian Matthews, to be specific.

35:09.540 --> 35:12.420
 What they did is they were able to selectively activate

35:12.420 --> 35:15.540
 the dopamine neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus.

35:15.540 --> 35:16.900
 And when they did that,

35:16.900 --> 35:19.380
 they induced a loneliness-like state.

35:19.380 --> 35:21.860
 Now, how did they know it was a loneliness-like state?

35:21.860 --> 35:23.500
 They knew because it motivated

35:23.500 --> 35:25.600
 the seeking out of social connections.

35:26.460 --> 35:28.680
 This is the kind of social hunger

35:28.680 --> 35:30.580
 that I was referring to before.

35:30.580 --> 35:32.420
 Whereas when the dopamine neurons

35:32.420 --> 35:34.300
 of the dorsal raphe are inhibited,

35:34.300 --> 35:36.740
 meaning their activity is quieted,

35:36.740 --> 35:40.860
 that suppressed a loneliness state.

35:40.860 --> 35:42.940
 So that's a little counterintuitive, right?

35:42.940 --> 35:45.660
 It's a group of neurons that when activated

35:45.660 --> 35:47.280
 makes you feel lonely.

35:47.280 --> 35:51.060
 And when this brain area is not activated,

35:51.060 --> 35:52.620
 it suppresses loneliness.

35:52.620 --> 35:53.460
 But if you think about it,

35:53.460 --> 35:56.180
 that's exactly the kind of circuit that you would want

35:56.180 --> 35:58.740
 in order to drive social behavior.

35:58.740 --> 36:01.660
 When you're feeling lonely, dopamine is released

36:01.660 --> 36:04.620
 and it causes you to go out and seek social interactions.

36:04.620 --> 36:08.580
 When this brain area has enough social interactions,

36:08.580 --> 36:09.780
 that's sort of a figure of speech,

36:09.780 --> 36:11.960
 brain areas don't have enough social interactions.

36:11.960 --> 36:14.460
 But when enough social interactions have happened,

36:14.460 --> 36:15.700
 that the neurons in this brain area

36:15.700 --> 36:17.700
 shut down their production of dopamine,

36:17.700 --> 36:21.100
 well, the loneliness state turns off.

36:21.100 --> 36:23.100
 So what we think of as loneliness,

36:23.100 --> 36:25.680
 as this big kind of dark cloud

36:25.680 --> 36:29.220
 or fog in our psychological landscape,

36:29.220 --> 36:31.440
 boils down to a very small set of neurons

36:31.440 --> 36:34.540
 releasing a specific neurochemical for motivation.

36:34.540 --> 36:36.360
 And to me, this really changes the way

36:36.360 --> 36:37.820
 that we think about loneliness

36:37.820 --> 36:40.740
 and that we think about social interactions.

36:40.740 --> 36:43.820
 There's so much subjective landscape to loneliness

36:43.820 --> 36:45.880
 and to social interactions.

36:45.880 --> 36:46.820
 But at the end of the day,

36:46.820 --> 36:49.660
 what it really is is that we are all social animals

36:49.660 --> 36:51.180
 to some extent or another,

36:51.180 --> 36:53.500
 and we all crave social interactions

36:53.500 --> 36:54.860
 to some extent or another,

36:54.860 --> 36:57.220
 although the extent will vary

36:57.220 --> 36:58.460
 depending on where you are

36:58.460 --> 37:00.820
 in the introversion-extroversion continuum,

37:00.820 --> 37:02.540
 and it is indeed a continuum.

37:02.540 --> 37:05.380
 Now, the other aspect of the study that was really important

37:05.380 --> 37:09.020
 gets back to that issue of hierarchy and social rank.

37:09.020 --> 37:13.380
 What they found is that depending on where you see yourself

37:13.380 --> 37:15.260
 in the social rank,

37:15.260 --> 37:17.220
 the dopamine neurons in the raphe

37:17.220 --> 37:19.880
 will lead to one consequence or another,

37:19.880 --> 37:22.380
 meaning moving toward social interactions

37:22.380 --> 37:24.140
 or moving away from them.

37:24.140 --> 37:26.060
 So the whole system is set up

37:26.060 --> 37:27.820
 so that you have a ton of flexibility

37:27.820 --> 37:29.840
 and control over social interactions.

37:29.840 --> 37:32.460
 So just a couple of key points and actionable takeaways

37:32.460 --> 37:35.060
 based on the information I've offered up until now.

37:36.260 --> 37:38.560
 If you think of yourself as an introvert,

37:39.620 --> 37:42.460
 it's very likely that you get a lot of dopamine

37:42.460 --> 37:46.180
 from a few or minimal social interactions,

37:46.180 --> 37:47.940
 whereas if you're an extrovert,

37:47.940 --> 37:49.980
 contrary to what you might think,

37:49.980 --> 37:52.220
 social interactions are not going to flood your system

37:52.220 --> 37:53.180
 with dopamine.

37:53.180 --> 37:57.180
 They actually are going to lead to less dopamine release

37:57.180 --> 37:58.780
 than it would for an introvert,

37:58.780 --> 37:59.980
 and therefore you're going to need

37:59.980 --> 38:02.020
 a lot more social interactions

38:02.020 --> 38:04.980
 in order to feel filled up by those interactions.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.500
 Now, I've been drawing a lot of parallels

38:06.500 --> 38:08.820
 between this social seeking

38:08.820 --> 38:12.380
 or avoiding social isolation and hunger,

38:12.380 --> 38:14.220
 but is that really the case?

38:14.220 --> 38:17.440
 And could it be that there are actually interactions

38:17.440 --> 38:18.740
 between the different drives,

38:18.740 --> 38:21.500
 meaning could social isolation

38:21.500 --> 38:24.240
 or the desire to seek out social interactions

38:24.240 --> 38:27.260
 actually relate to the hunger system and vice versa?

38:27.260 --> 38:29.580
 And indeed the answer is yes.

38:29.580 --> 38:33.680
 We don't have 50 different homeostatic systems

38:33.680 --> 38:36.740
 and 50 different neurochemicals

38:36.740 --> 38:39.780
 to underlie our drive to eat,

38:39.780 --> 38:42.860
 our drive for romantic interactions,

38:42.860 --> 38:46.080
 our drive for friendship interactions.

38:46.080 --> 38:49.100
 We have essentially one, maybe two,

38:49.100 --> 38:51.980
 and they all funnel into the same dopamine system.

38:51.980 --> 38:53.500
 And there's a beautiful paper

38:53.500 --> 38:55.180
 that illustrates some of the crossover

38:55.180 --> 38:58.540
 between these different homeostatic drives.

38:58.540 --> 38:59.540
 The title of the paper is

38:59.540 --> 39:03.080
 acute social isolation evokes midbrain craving responses

39:03.080 --> 39:04.620
 similar to hunger.

39:04.620 --> 39:07.460
 This is from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT,

39:07.460 --> 39:09.980
 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.340
 Dr. Kay Tai is also an author on this paper.

39:12.340 --> 39:13.940
 The paper was published in Nature Neuroscience.

39:13.940 --> 39:16.340
 It's a really terrific paper.

39:16.340 --> 39:18.660
 Just to briefly summarize what they did,

39:18.660 --> 39:20.880
 they took people that were categorized

39:20.880 --> 39:23.140
 as socially connected, healthy human adults.

39:23.140 --> 39:24.220
 So these are people that are used

39:24.220 --> 39:26.500
 to pretty frequent social interactions.

39:27.380 --> 39:31.380
 And they socially isolated them for about 10 hours.

39:31.380 --> 39:35.040
 And they had no opportunity to access social media,

39:35.040 --> 39:38.180
 email, fiction reading even,

39:38.180 --> 39:39.740
 and certainly didn't have the opportunity

39:39.740 --> 39:41.800
 to interact with people face-to-face.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.660
 So what this did is it increased social craving,

39:44.660 --> 39:46.540
 both objectively, the people said

39:46.540 --> 39:48.600
 that they were now craving social interactions,

39:48.600 --> 39:50.020
 and then they did brain imaging

39:50.020 --> 39:52.100
 in response to images of people,

39:52.100 --> 39:56.060
 people interacting, food, flowers, other types of stimuli.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.380
 Some of the stimuli or these images,

39:58.380 --> 40:01.040
 we call them stimuli, but they're images really,

40:01.040 --> 40:02.980
 had a lot of social engagement going on in them.

40:02.980 --> 40:03.820
 Others did not.

40:03.820 --> 40:06.420
 Some had a lot of faces showing, others did not.

40:06.420 --> 40:08.140
 And as you might suspect,

40:08.140 --> 40:11.540
 there was activation of many of the brain areas

40:11.540 --> 40:12.700
 that we've talked about earlier,

40:12.700 --> 40:14.660
 dorsal raphe nucleus and other brain areas

40:14.660 --> 40:17.400
 associated with dopaminergic neurons.

40:17.400 --> 40:22.400
 When the socially isolated people viewed social cues,

40:22.700 --> 40:24.700
 people interacting faces and so on,

40:24.700 --> 40:27.100
 and less so for things like flowers.

40:27.100 --> 40:30.880
 However, they also had increased responses

40:30.880 --> 40:34.380
 to images of food, which is interesting,

40:34.380 --> 40:36.820
 and actually is consistent with the literature

40:36.820 --> 40:38.680
 that when people are socially isolated,

40:38.680 --> 40:41.140
 they often will start eating more,

40:41.140 --> 40:43.940
 or they will change the nature of the foods that they eat.

40:43.940 --> 40:46.300
 Now, we think of that as comfort foods

40:46.300 --> 40:48.900
 or soothing oneself through eating

40:48.900 --> 40:51.900
 rather than social interaction as a kind of pathology.

40:51.900 --> 40:53.840
 But while it might not be healthy,

40:53.840 --> 40:56.060
 depending on the context and the person,

40:56.060 --> 40:57.420
 it's really important to understand

40:57.420 --> 40:59.640
 that the reason that happens

40:59.640 --> 41:01.780
 is because we have a common circuit

41:01.780 --> 41:03.880
 and that the system, meaning the person,

41:03.880 --> 41:05.860
 is actually craving dopamine release.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.120
 They don't consciously know this,

41:07.120 --> 41:08.740
 this is all subconsciously carried out,

41:08.740 --> 41:10.420
 but they're craving dopamine release.

41:10.420 --> 41:12.460
 And if they can't get it from social interactions

41:12.460 --> 41:15.500
 as they normally would, they'll start seeking it from food.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.900
 Now, they did an important reverse experiment as well

41:18.900 --> 41:22.640
 where they had subjects go on 10 hours of food fasting.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.520
 Now, these were not people that were familiar with fasting.

41:25.520 --> 41:28.240
 They weren't doing intermittent fasting.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.820
 They were eating more typical meal schedules.

41:30.820 --> 41:33.700
 And so that created increased hunger, et cetera,

41:33.700 --> 41:37.060
 but it also increased their appetite, if you will,

41:37.060 --> 41:38.740
 for social interactions.

41:38.740 --> 41:40.340
 And so the important point here

41:40.340 --> 41:42.340
 is that there's a common biology,

41:42.340 --> 41:43.820
 there's a common circuitry

41:43.820 --> 41:46.900
 that underlies homeostatic craving of things

41:46.900 --> 41:50.060
 that maintain us as individuals and as a species.

41:50.060 --> 41:53.240
 And it really places social interactions

41:53.240 --> 41:55.820
 as right up there in the list of things

41:55.820 --> 41:58.540
 that we could consider so vital for our survival

41:58.540 --> 41:59.380
 and for our health.

41:59.380 --> 42:02.580
 Things like food, water, social interactions

42:02.580 --> 42:07.100
 are really sit within a top tier amongst each other,

42:07.100 --> 42:09.180
 and they use the same common circuitry,

42:09.180 --> 42:11.100
 dorsal raphe dopamine neurons,

42:11.100 --> 42:12.380
 in addition to other structures

42:12.380 --> 42:14.800
 in order to create this drive

42:14.800 --> 42:17.180
 to seek out certain types of stimuli.

42:17.180 --> 42:19.900
 Now, this is a very reductionist view of social bonding.

42:19.900 --> 42:21.360
 I realize that.

42:21.360 --> 42:23.060
 But it's important to realize

42:23.060 --> 42:25.540
 that while we place all this subjective context,

42:25.540 --> 42:26.820
 oh, I miss this person,

42:26.820 --> 42:30.380
 or I really would like to avoid that person,

42:30.380 --> 42:31.220
 at the end of the day,

42:31.220 --> 42:33.820
 it really all funnels into a system

42:33.820 --> 42:35.700
 whereby a single neurochemical

42:35.700 --> 42:38.580
 is either being released and motivating us

42:38.580 --> 42:41.220
 to seek out more of a particular type of interaction

42:41.220 --> 42:42.120
 or is not released,

42:42.120 --> 42:43.580
 and therefore we are perfectly comfortable

42:43.580 --> 42:45.660
 staying exactly where we are.

42:45.660 --> 42:47.900
 As I say this, some of you are probably thinking,

42:47.900 --> 42:50.220
 oh, that's probably what happens when you fall in love.

42:50.220 --> 42:51.680
 And indeed, that's the case.

42:51.680 --> 42:54.300
 When people enter romantic relationships

42:54.300 --> 42:56.320
 that to them are very satisfying,

42:56.320 --> 42:59.340
 there's this period that the theory is

42:59.340 --> 43:02.140
 that it lasts anywhere from six days to six months,

43:02.140 --> 43:03.100
 although some people report

43:03.100 --> 43:06.260
 that this feeling can last many, many years, even decades,

43:06.260 --> 43:10.160
 of just feeling completely filled up and sated

43:10.160 --> 43:12.740
 by the experience of being with that person,

43:12.740 --> 43:15.900
 so much so that cravings for food are reduced,

43:15.900 --> 43:17.520
 cravings for sleep are reduced.

43:17.520 --> 43:18.740
 Now, there's all sorts of activities

43:18.740 --> 43:21.140
 and things that go along with new romantic partnerships

43:21.140 --> 43:23.260
 that take up time that might get in the way

43:23.260 --> 43:25.600
 of things like sleep or things like food.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.820
 But the point is that dopamine is the final common pathway

43:29.820 --> 43:31.700
 by which we seek out things

43:31.700 --> 43:34.380
 and we end up feeling as if we are satisfied

43:34.380 --> 43:36.500
 by certain types of interactions.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.620
 Now, similarly, if you've ever been isolated

43:38.620 --> 43:40.380
 for a long period of time,

43:40.380 --> 43:43.620
 your focus might've shifted to what you're going to eat,

43:43.620 --> 43:44.720
 what you're going to cook for dinner

43:44.720 --> 43:46.500
 in a much more heightened way,

43:46.500 --> 43:48.780
 the importance of those sensory stimuli

43:48.780 --> 43:50.100
 and those types of interactions,

43:50.100 --> 43:52.820
 and indeed the taste of food itself expands.

43:52.820 --> 43:55.700
 So normally, when we are in social relationships

43:55.700 --> 43:58.120
 that are ones that are familiar to us,

43:58.120 --> 44:00.260
 we have a balance of these different drives.

44:00.260 --> 44:03.300
 But when one particular drive takes over

44:03.300 --> 44:05.820
 and we are very focused on it,

44:05.820 --> 44:08.480
 because they all funnel into the same circuitry,

44:08.480 --> 44:10.440
 there really isn't the seeking out

44:10.440 --> 44:12.280
 of certain types of behaviors like food seeking

44:12.280 --> 44:13.900
 when we're newly in love.

44:13.900 --> 44:16.140
 Now, that doesn't mean that food won't taste good to us

44:16.140 --> 44:16.980
 or that we don't seek it.

44:16.980 --> 44:18.740
 And indeed, there are experiments that have been done

44:18.740 --> 44:20.260
 where if people have just fallen in love,

44:20.260 --> 44:22.960
 the taste of a strawberry can just be incredible.

44:22.960 --> 44:25.020
 The other effect of dopamine is that it changes

44:25.020 --> 44:26.860
 the way that we interpret sensory stimuli.

44:26.860 --> 44:28.980
 Our detectors actually change

44:28.980 --> 44:30.420
 when we are in heightened states

44:30.420 --> 44:33.340
 of dopaminergic activity or drive.

44:33.340 --> 44:35.700
 Basically, what this means is that things seem better

44:35.700 --> 44:38.900
 than they would when we have less dopamine in our system.

44:38.900 --> 44:41.460
 The point here is that there's a lot of crossover.

44:41.460 --> 44:43.460
 There's a lot of meshing together

44:43.460 --> 44:45.200
 of different homeostatic drives,

44:45.200 --> 44:47.540
 that they don't exist in separate channels.

44:47.540 --> 44:49.380
 And it's only under conditions

44:49.380 --> 44:51.940
 in which one particular homeostatic drive

44:51.940 --> 44:53.820
 is kind of being played out to the extreme,

44:53.820 --> 44:56.180
 such as the example of falling in love,

44:56.180 --> 44:59.900
 that we tend to avoid or sort of overlook

44:59.900 --> 45:01.300
 the other homeostatic drives.

45:01.300 --> 45:04.020
 And that's because simply we're getting enough dopamine,

45:04.020 --> 45:05.600
 we don't need anymore.

45:05.600 --> 45:06.820
 Up until now, I've been focused

45:06.820 --> 45:09.620
 on the organizational logic of social bonding,

45:09.620 --> 45:10.860
 which is really just nerd speak

45:10.860 --> 45:13.500
 for how is it that we form bonds, avoid bonds?

45:13.500 --> 45:15.660
 Why do people seek out more or fewer bonds

45:15.660 --> 45:17.260
 than others, et cetera?

45:17.260 --> 45:19.600
 Now I'd like to shift gears a bit

45:19.600 --> 45:23.060
 and focus on what are some things that we can do

45:23.060 --> 45:26.600
 to encourage the formation of healthy bonds.

45:27.620 --> 45:29.260
 There's a beautiful study that was published

45:29.260 --> 45:32.420
 in Cell Reports, Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

45:32.420 --> 45:33.260
 The title of this paper is

45:33.260 --> 45:35.380
 is Conscious Processing of Narrative Stimuli

45:35.380 --> 45:38.040
 Synchronizes Heart Rate Between Individuals.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.740
 I mentioned this on a previous podcast,

45:39.740 --> 45:41.180
 but I'd like to mention it again

45:41.180 --> 45:42.340
 and go into a little bit more depth

45:42.340 --> 45:44.960
 because it points to specific actionable items

45:44.960 --> 45:48.000
 that we can all use in order to enhance the quality

45:48.000 --> 45:51.260
 and depth of social bonds of all kinds.

45:51.260 --> 45:54.740
 Now, this study involved a very simple type of experiment.

45:54.740 --> 45:56.440
 They had people listen to a story.

45:56.440 --> 45:59.100
 Everybody in the study listened to the same story,

45:59.100 --> 46:00.880
 but they listened to that story at different times

46:00.880 --> 46:02.800
 and indeed in different locations.

46:02.800 --> 46:05.860
 So different people, same story.

46:05.860 --> 46:07.860
 And they measured things like heart rate.

46:07.860 --> 46:09.620
 They measured breathing, et cetera.

46:09.620 --> 46:11.780
 Now, what was the motivation for doing this?

46:11.780 --> 46:14.420
 Well, there's a long standing literature showing

46:14.420 --> 46:17.180
 that our physiology, things like our heart rate,

46:17.180 --> 46:19.000
 our breathing, our skin conductance,

46:19.000 --> 46:20.500
 meaning the amount of sweating,

46:22.180 --> 46:24.820
 can be synchronized between individuals.

46:24.820 --> 46:27.860
 And that synchronization can occur

46:27.860 --> 46:29.540
 according to a variety of different things.

46:29.540 --> 46:31.500
 There've been studies that have people look at one another

46:31.500 --> 46:34.540
 and they look and actually see that their pupil size

46:34.540 --> 46:36.780
 of their eyes starts to synchronize.

46:36.780 --> 46:38.940
 People's breathing can synchronize.

46:38.940 --> 46:42.500
 People's body temperatures can even start to synchronize

46:42.500 --> 46:44.620
 or at least shifts in body temperature can synchronize.

46:44.620 --> 46:46.820
 One person gets cooler, the other person gets cooler.

46:46.820 --> 46:48.540
 A lot of this is subconscious.

46:48.540 --> 46:50.600
 Some of it can be detected by conscious cues

46:50.600 --> 46:51.660
 like flushing of the skin

46:51.660 --> 46:53.720
 or actually seeing someone's pupils change.

46:53.720 --> 46:56.700
 But actually the pupil reflex is a really good example

46:56.700 --> 46:59.780
 whereby except for rare cases

46:59.780 --> 47:01.580
 and certain highly trained individuals,

47:01.580 --> 47:03.940
 most people can't control their pupil reflexes

47:03.940 --> 47:05.300
 in a very deliberate way.

47:05.300 --> 47:06.920
 It's truly a reflex.

47:06.920 --> 47:08.920
 It's an autonomic reflex.

47:08.920 --> 47:10.420
 So there's a lot of literature showing

47:10.420 --> 47:14.060
 that within small groups or two people,

47:14.060 --> 47:15.960
 these physiological signals can be synchronized.

47:15.960 --> 47:19.180
 What this study found was that when people listen

47:19.180 --> 47:21.580
 to the same story but at different times,

47:21.580 --> 47:23.760
 their heart rates start to synchronize.

47:23.760 --> 47:25.380
 This is incredible because people are listening

47:25.380 --> 47:27.000
 to the story at different times,

47:27.000 --> 47:28.460
 but the gaps between their heartbeats

47:28.460 --> 47:29.820
 become very stereotyped

47:29.820 --> 47:32.660
 and map almost precisely onto one another.

47:32.660 --> 47:33.700
 That's incredible.

47:34.580 --> 47:37.820
 Now, we also know from an extensive literature

47:37.820 --> 47:42.300
 that the quality and perceived depth of a social bond

47:43.180 --> 47:45.140
 correlates very strongly

47:45.140 --> 47:48.760
 with how much physiological synchronization there is

47:48.760 --> 47:50.580
 between individuals.

47:50.580 --> 47:54.500
 In other words, when your bodies feel the same,

47:54.500 --> 47:57.620
 you tend to feel more bonded to somebody else.

47:57.620 --> 48:00.380
 And so this whole thing is a rather circular argument.

48:00.380 --> 48:01.980
 When you feel closer to somebody else,

48:01.980 --> 48:04.040
 your physiology synchronize.

48:04.040 --> 48:06.140
 And the reverse is true as well.

48:06.140 --> 48:07.740
 When your physiologies are synchronized,

48:07.740 --> 48:09.780
 you feel closer to other people.

48:09.780 --> 48:11.540
 This is what I call the concert phenomenon.

48:11.540 --> 48:14.260
 If you ever go to see your favorite band

48:14.260 --> 48:17.080
 or you go to a concert that you particularly love,

48:17.080 --> 48:19.140
 you will often look over at somebody

48:19.140 --> 48:21.040
 and you'll see them enjoying the same thing.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.440
 And they're often in a similar state as you are.

48:23.440 --> 48:25.860
 Maybe the sort of like favorite song comes on

48:25.860 --> 48:28.960
 and you actually feel connected to that person.

48:28.960 --> 48:29.800
 You feel like you're in,

48:29.800 --> 48:31.820
 obviously there's a shared experience,

48:31.820 --> 48:34.520
 but there's also a shared physiological response

48:34.520 --> 48:35.700
 to that experience.

48:35.700 --> 48:39.060
 And so this can happen en masse with large groups of people,

48:39.060 --> 48:41.480
 or it can happen just between two individuals.

48:41.480 --> 48:43.200
 And as this study points out,

48:43.200 --> 48:44.820
 it can actually happen between individuals

48:44.820 --> 48:46.940
 without them actually interacting with one another

48:46.940 --> 48:49.820
 when the story they are listening to is the anchor

48:49.820 --> 48:51.740
 or the driver of their physiology.

48:51.740 --> 48:53.900
 This really points to the fact

48:53.900 --> 48:57.100
 that the body and the brain are reciprocally connected.

48:57.100 --> 49:00.740
 Yes, indeed, what we think, what we hear, what we feel

49:00.740 --> 49:02.980
 drives our physiology, our heartbeat,

49:02.980 --> 49:04.500
 our respiration, et cetera,

49:04.500 --> 49:06.080
 but our heartbeat and respiration

49:06.080 --> 49:09.240
 also are influencing our state of mind.

49:09.240 --> 49:10.080
 And in this case,

49:10.080 --> 49:12.900
 it's encouraging certain types of social bonds

49:12.900 --> 49:15.580
 when our heart rates are synchronized.

49:15.580 --> 49:16.940
 You can leverage this.

49:16.940 --> 49:17.940
 How can you leverage this?

49:17.940 --> 49:21.780
 Well, let's take a upcoming example of the holidays.

49:21.780 --> 49:24.280
 There's a sort of a joke.

49:24.280 --> 49:29.020
 I think it was Ram Dass, sort of Buddhist philosopher type

49:29.020 --> 49:31.740
 that said, if you think you're enlightened,

49:31.740 --> 49:32.940
 go visit your parents.

49:32.940 --> 49:34.400
 And I think what he was referring to

49:34.400 --> 49:36.320
 is that some people, not all people,

49:36.320 --> 49:38.340
 have challenging relationships with their parents.

49:38.340 --> 49:40.600
 We're going to talk about child-parent attachment

49:40.600 --> 49:42.080
 and interactions in a few minutes,

49:42.080 --> 49:45.340
 but some people have a wonderful relationship

49:45.340 --> 49:47.820
 to both their parents and more power to them.

49:47.820 --> 49:49.440
 I think that's wonderful.

49:49.440 --> 49:50.900
 We should all be so lucky.

49:50.900 --> 49:52.620
 Many people have challenged relationships

49:52.620 --> 49:53.440
 with their parents,

49:53.440 --> 49:55.700
 or they have a great relationship with their parents,

49:55.700 --> 49:59.580
 but their parents know, or they know how to drive that dart

49:59.580 --> 50:03.020
 right into that particular soft piece of psychological flesh

50:03.020 --> 50:05.060
 by saying just the slightest thing,

50:05.060 --> 50:07.620
 or even by raising their eyebrow or rolling their eyes,

50:07.620 --> 50:09.100
 or the tone in which they do something.

50:09.100 --> 50:11.400
 This is also true between siblings.

50:11.400 --> 50:13.580
 I think many of you can think of examples

50:13.580 --> 50:14.540
 where this is true.

50:15.760 --> 50:18.540
 Many people, when they interact with others,

50:18.540 --> 50:22.220
 expect that the mere interaction with the other person

50:22.220 --> 50:24.700
 is going to create the sense of bonding.

50:24.700 --> 50:26.060
 And often that is the case.

50:26.060 --> 50:29.540
 For instance, if people are involved in intimate disclosure,

50:29.540 --> 50:33.660
 if people enjoy each other's company so much

50:33.660 --> 50:36.540
 that just the mere sight of somebody evokes great feelings

50:36.540 --> 50:38.860
 and it's mutual, that often can happen.

50:38.860 --> 50:41.700
 But in many types of social interactions,

50:41.700 --> 50:45.180
 it's not the direct interaction with that person

50:45.180 --> 50:46.580
 that makes us feel close to them,

50:46.580 --> 50:49.180
 but rather it's shared experience.

50:49.180 --> 50:52.580
 And shared experience is shared physiology.

50:52.580 --> 50:55.660
 That's the point I'm trying to make by way of this study

50:55.660 --> 50:57.820
 about conscious processing of narrative stimuli

50:57.820 --> 51:00.380
 synchronizes heart rate of different individuals.

51:00.380 --> 51:04.020
 So for instance, if you have a somewhat challenged

51:04.020 --> 51:07.580
 or a somewhat, let's call it a slight friction

51:07.580 --> 51:10.540
 in getting close with somebody,

51:10.540 --> 51:12.480
 or it can be a challenging interaction,

51:12.480 --> 51:15.760
 oftentimes it's very useful to focus outward

51:15.760 --> 51:18.580
 on some other common narrative, a movie.

51:18.580 --> 51:20.620
 Oftentimes people will watch a game together.

51:20.620 --> 51:22.460
 Actually, there's a lot of critique

51:22.460 --> 51:26.120
 that people or families will focus outward too much

51:26.120 --> 51:27.460
 on external events.

51:27.460 --> 51:30.960
 But these external events can be observing the grandchild

51:30.960 --> 51:31.980
 and how wonderful they are,

51:31.980 --> 51:34.460
 or observing the meal and how wonderful it is.

51:34.460 --> 51:37.720
 Or as we commonly see in various traditions,

51:37.720 --> 51:40.000
 there's a story that's repeated each year.

51:40.000 --> 51:41.420
 Certainly in the upcoming holidays,

51:41.420 --> 51:45.220
 there's Christmas stories, there are themes and traditions.

51:45.220 --> 51:46.740
 And those themes and traditions

51:46.740 --> 51:49.800
 anchor a number of different aspects of our psychology.

51:49.800 --> 51:50.740
 They're really wonderful.

51:50.740 --> 51:53.300
 They thread through the ages really

51:53.300 --> 51:55.900
 and allow us to link our own experiences up

51:55.900 --> 51:59.060
 with previous generations and experiences.

51:59.060 --> 52:02.360
 But in addition to that, they synchronize our physiologies.

52:02.360 --> 52:03.960
 And so sometimes it can be useful

52:03.960 --> 52:06.960
 rather than expecting others to shift our physiology

52:06.960 --> 52:08.400
 in the way that we wish,

52:08.400 --> 52:11.640
 or us shifting their physiologies in the way that we wish,

52:11.640 --> 52:14.700
 and then expecting some bond to mushroom out of that

52:14.700 --> 52:16.740
 in some beautiful way,

52:16.740 --> 52:19.900
 to focus on some external stimulus,

52:19.900 --> 52:21.780
 to focus on something that will synchronize

52:21.780 --> 52:23.060
 the physiologies of both people.

52:23.060 --> 52:24.620
 That can act as a bridge

52:24.620 --> 52:26.460
 in order to establish social bonds.

52:26.460 --> 52:28.820
 And this is not a hack or a workaround

52:28.820 --> 52:30.700
 for making terrible relationships good.

52:30.700 --> 52:32.300
 This is actually at the seat

52:32.300 --> 52:35.400
 of what we come away from a social interaction with

52:35.400 --> 52:38.200
 as feeling, wow, that was a really wonderful time.

52:38.200 --> 52:40.100
 Often a really wonderful time

52:40.100 --> 52:42.820
 can be by virtue of the specific things that were said

52:42.820 --> 52:45.440
 or the specific things that one engaged in.

52:45.440 --> 52:46.960
 But more often than not,

52:46.960 --> 52:49.300
 the final common pathway, we should say,

52:49.300 --> 52:53.980
 of great experiences was a great physiological experience

52:53.980 --> 52:56.980
 and a shared physiological experience.

52:56.980 --> 52:58.580
 I have a short anecdote that relates to this.

52:58.580 --> 52:59.580
 I have an older sibling,

52:59.580 --> 53:01.540
 and she used to say that when she was in college,

53:01.540 --> 53:03.340
 the best dates that she ever went on

53:03.340 --> 53:05.620
 were dates where she was asked to go out

53:05.620 --> 53:06.700
 and listen to music.

53:06.700 --> 53:09.160
 She pointed out, however, that oftentimes

53:09.160 --> 53:10.240
 the guys that would ask her out

53:10.240 --> 53:11.340
 would take her to jazz clubs.

53:11.340 --> 53:12.180
 She always had the theory

53:12.180 --> 53:13.620
 that they would ask her to jazz clubs

53:13.620 --> 53:15.860
 because at jazz clubs, typically you would sit down

53:15.860 --> 53:18.380
 and then she had to conclude that they couldn't dance.

53:18.380 --> 53:19.420
 My sister likes to dance.

53:19.420 --> 53:21.420
 And so anytime someone actually had the nerve

53:21.420 --> 53:22.260
 to take her dancing,

53:22.260 --> 53:24.740
 those turned out to be particularly,

53:24.740 --> 53:27.220
 let's just say, satisfying dates and relationships.

53:27.220 --> 53:28.280
 At least they lasted longer.

53:28.280 --> 53:29.120
 That's all I know about them.

53:29.120 --> 53:30.420
 That's all I want to know about them.

53:30.420 --> 53:32.060
 She's my sister after all.

53:32.060 --> 53:35.860
 But the theory behind whoever was asking her out

53:35.860 --> 53:37.260
 on these dates was the right one,

53:37.260 --> 53:39.260
 which is that if you want to bond with somebody,

53:39.260 --> 53:41.800
 you create a common physiological response

53:41.800 --> 53:44.460
 through a common and shared experience.

53:44.460 --> 53:46.940
 And that is often a good entry way

53:46.940 --> 53:50.040
 into establishing whether or not, it's always a question,

53:50.040 --> 53:52.300
 whether or not there can be common physiological experience

53:52.300 --> 53:54.140
 between two individuals.

53:54.140 --> 53:56.460
 Up until now, we've been talking about social bonding

53:56.460 --> 53:58.060
 through the lens of neural circuits

53:58.060 --> 53:59.940
 that are already established.

53:59.940 --> 54:01.460
 However, early in the episode,

54:01.460 --> 54:03.380
 I mentioned that these very neural circuits

54:03.380 --> 54:05.100
 that are responsible for social bonding

54:05.100 --> 54:07.260
 in adult forms of attachment,

54:07.260 --> 54:10.320
 be it romantic or friendship or otherwise,

54:10.320 --> 54:13.260
 are actually established during development.

54:13.260 --> 54:16.420
 One of the more important and I think exciting areas

54:16.420 --> 54:20.460
 of early attachment as it relates to adult attachment

54:20.460 --> 54:23.460
 comes to us from the work of Alan Shore.

54:23.460 --> 54:28.460
 Alan Shore, spelled A-L-L-A-N, Shore, S-C-H-O-R-E,

54:28.940 --> 54:31.700
 is a psychoanalyst who also has deep understanding

54:31.700 --> 54:34.740
 of neurobiology of attachment,

54:34.740 --> 54:38.060
 both in childhood and in adulthood.

54:38.060 --> 54:40.940
 And he's focused a lot on differences

54:40.940 --> 54:44.820
 between right brain and left brain forms of attachment.

54:44.820 --> 54:47.740
 Now, in a early episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

54:47.740 --> 54:50.740
 I touched into the fact that most of what's discussed

54:50.740 --> 54:53.460
 in the general public and sort of pop psychology

54:53.460 --> 54:56.380
 and even in some neurobiology courses

54:56.380 --> 54:58.820
 about right brain versus left brain

54:58.820 --> 55:00.780
 and one side of the brain being more emotional

55:00.780 --> 55:04.060
 and the other side being more rational is completely wrong.

55:04.940 --> 55:08.360
 Most of what I see out there is actually backwards

55:08.360 --> 55:10.100
 to the way things actually work.

55:10.100 --> 55:13.220
 And while there is some what we call lateralization

55:13.220 --> 55:16.160
 of function, meaning certain brain functions

55:16.160 --> 55:18.660
 are handled by neurons on one side of the brain

55:18.660 --> 55:21.740
 or the other, the idea that one side of your brain

55:21.740 --> 55:24.220
 is emotional and the other side of your brain is rational

55:24.220 --> 55:26.420
 is just simply not true.

55:26.420 --> 55:28.620
 However, the work of Alan Shore

55:28.620 --> 55:31.380
 points to some very concrete neural circuits

55:31.380 --> 55:34.700
 that do have a lateralization bias,

55:34.700 --> 55:36.780
 meaning they are more right brain than left brain

55:36.780 --> 55:38.900
 or more left brain than right brain,

55:38.900 --> 55:41.400
 that underlies certain forms of attachment

55:41.400 --> 55:45.940
 between child and parent, in particular, child and mother,

55:45.940 --> 55:49.620
 and that these right brain isms, if you will,

55:49.620 --> 55:53.880
 and left brain isms for attachment get played out

55:53.880 --> 55:58.460
 again and again in our forms of attachment as adults.

55:58.460 --> 56:00.780
 So I'd like to talk about that work briefly now

56:00.780 --> 56:01.980
 because I think it really points

56:01.980 --> 56:05.540
 to a number of important features of how we establish bonds

56:05.540 --> 56:08.540
 and the different routes to establishing bonds.

56:08.540 --> 56:10.300
 So within the field of psychoanalysis,

56:10.300 --> 56:12.300
 there's a longstanding discussion, of course,

56:12.300 --> 56:14.820
 about the so-called unconscious or subconscious,

56:14.820 --> 56:16.700
 the things that we are not aware of.

56:16.700 --> 56:19.140
 And I think there's growing evidence pointing to the fact

56:19.140 --> 56:22.620
 that at least one major component of the subconscious

56:22.620 --> 56:25.900
 or the unconscious is the so-called autonomic nervous system.

56:25.900 --> 56:27.300
 The autonomic nervous system

56:27.300 --> 56:28.900
 is the portion of our nervous system

56:28.900 --> 56:31.380
 that controls our reflexive breathing, our heart rate,

56:31.380 --> 56:35.660
 our skin conductance, meaning our sweating, pupil size.

56:35.660 --> 56:38.020
 It's the aspect of our nervous system

56:38.020 --> 56:40.180
 that makes us more alert or more calm.

56:40.180 --> 56:42.820
 It's the so-called sympathetic, meaning for alertness

56:42.820 --> 56:45.340
 or parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system,

56:45.340 --> 56:48.100
 parasympathetic for more calming responses.

56:48.100 --> 56:52.640
 Now, what Dr. Schor's work and the work of others

56:52.640 --> 56:57.100
 is now showing is that early infant parent,

56:57.100 --> 56:58.820
 in particular infant mother attachment,

56:58.820 --> 57:02.700
 involves a coordination or synchronization

57:02.700 --> 57:06.560
 of these right brain circuits and these left brain circuits

57:06.560 --> 57:10.740
 as they relate to the autonomic nervous system.

57:10.740 --> 57:11.800
 How does this play out?

57:11.800 --> 57:14.700
 Well, it plays out where early on as an infant,

57:14.700 --> 57:16.620
 when you're born, you're truly helpless,

57:16.620 --> 57:18.820
 you can't feed yourself, you can't warm yourself,

57:18.820 --> 57:19.900
 you can't change yourself,

57:19.900 --> 57:22.780
 and you certainly can't ambulate, walk anywhere

57:22.780 --> 57:24.400
 to get the things that you need.

57:25.260 --> 57:28.940
 All of those functions, all of those needs, rather,

57:28.940 --> 57:31.380
 are met by your primary caretaker.

57:31.380 --> 57:33.480
 Typically, that's the mother.

57:33.480 --> 57:35.220
 Fathers, of course, play a role also,

57:35.220 --> 57:38.020
 but because of breastfeeding or even bottle feeding,

57:38.020 --> 57:40.300
 typically mothers play a more prominent role.

57:40.300 --> 57:43.140
 I realize there are exceptions, but that's the general rule.

57:44.700 --> 57:46.840
 There are now brain imaging studies

57:46.840 --> 57:51.100
 examining the brains of infants and the brains of mothers

57:51.100 --> 57:54.780
 as they interact and showing that the physical contact

57:54.780 --> 57:58.720
 between the two, the breathing of the mother and child,

57:58.720 --> 58:00.760
 the heart rate of the mother and child,

58:00.760 --> 58:02.980
 and indeed the pupil size of the mother and child

58:02.980 --> 58:05.120
 are actually actively getting coordinated.

58:05.120 --> 58:07.540
 In other words, the mother is regulating

58:07.540 --> 58:10.220
 the infant's autonomic nervous system primarily,

58:10.220 --> 58:11.780
 and the infant is also regulating

58:11.780 --> 58:13.540
 the mother's autonomic nervous system.

58:13.540 --> 58:16.180
 A small coo from a baby or a cry,

58:16.180 --> 58:17.580
 which is a stress cry from a baby,

58:17.580 --> 58:19.820
 will definitely regulate the autonomic nervous system

58:19.820 --> 58:20.900
 of the mother.

58:20.900 --> 58:25.900
 This whole right brain system is directly tapped

58:26.460 --> 58:28.420
 into the so-called oxytocin system,

58:28.420 --> 58:30.460
 and we'll talk more about oxytocin in a moment.

58:30.460 --> 58:32.840
 Oxytocin, again, being this peptide hormone

58:32.840 --> 58:35.340
 that is involved in social bonds of all kinds,

58:35.340 --> 58:37.640
 but that at least in early childhood

58:37.640 --> 58:40.060
 is very closely associated with milk letdown

58:40.060 --> 58:41.540
 and milk production.

58:41.540 --> 58:44.660
 There's actually a lot of stimulation of oxytocin release

58:44.660 --> 58:47.020
 in the mother by nursing itself,

58:47.020 --> 58:48.820
 so physical contact with the nipple

58:49.940 --> 58:53.720
 and by the contact of skin between baby and mother,

58:53.720 --> 58:55.060
 and there's specificity there.

58:55.060 --> 58:57.900
 It's not just any baby that can evoke

58:57.900 --> 59:01.020
 the most amount of oxytocin release from the mother.

59:01.020 --> 59:04.340
 Now, however, there are examples where just holding a child

59:04.340 --> 59:06.800
 will evoke oxytocin release in the non-parent

59:06.800 --> 59:08.540
 or somebody other than the parent.

59:08.540 --> 59:10.140
 I think most people experience that.

59:10.140 --> 59:12.580
 That's the new puppy or new baby phenomenon,

59:12.580 --> 59:16.340
 because indeed puppies can evoke oxytocin release as well.

59:16.340 --> 59:18.720
 The point is not that oxytocin is only released

59:18.720 --> 59:21.460
 in response to the primary relationship

59:21.460 --> 59:23.400
 or the mother and their child,

59:23.400 --> 59:26.580
 but rather that the amount of oxytocin scales

59:26.580 --> 59:29.780
 with how closely related one is to that particular child

59:29.780 --> 59:31.240
 and vice versa.

59:31.240 --> 59:33.160
 So there's oxytocin release occurring

59:33.160 --> 59:35.040
 in both the child and the mother.

59:35.040 --> 59:38.620
 So this right brain system is an emotional

59:38.620 --> 59:40.420
 but autonomic system.

59:40.420 --> 59:44.380
 It is below our subconscious detection.

59:44.380 --> 59:49.380
 Now, as we get older, there's another system

59:49.420 --> 59:53.720
 that starts to come into play in parent-child interactions,

59:53.720 --> 59:56.380
 and this also comes into play in sibling interactions

59:56.380 --> 59:58.460
 and so forth, and that's the left brain system

59:58.460 --> 1:00:00.180
 as described by Alan Shore.

1:00:00.180 --> 1:00:03.200
 Now, again, this isn't about emotion versus rationality.

1:00:03.200 --> 1:00:04.580
 This is about autonomic

1:00:04.580 --> 1:00:06.700
 versus more conscious forms of bonding.

1:00:06.700 --> 1:00:09.820
 So on the left brain circuit side,

1:00:09.820 --> 1:00:12.540
 there is evidence for, based on neuroimaging studies,

1:00:12.540 --> 1:00:15.060
 but also animal studies to support the idea

1:00:15.060 --> 1:00:17.540
 that on the left brain side of things,

1:00:17.540 --> 1:00:21.020
 there is a processing more of narratives

1:00:21.020 --> 1:00:23.980
 that are very concrete, logical narratives, okay?

1:00:23.980 --> 1:00:27.660
 And again, I have to zoom out and just really tamp down

1:00:27.660 --> 1:00:29.700
 the idea that it's not that one side of the brain

1:00:29.700 --> 1:00:31.900
 is emotional and the other side is rational,

1:00:31.900 --> 1:00:34.460
 but rather that these two things are happening in parallel,

1:00:34.460 --> 1:00:36.860
 and that there's a bit of a dominance

1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:40.340
 for the left brain circuitry to be involved

1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:42.300
 in the kinds of bonding that are associated

1:00:42.300 --> 1:00:44.180
 with prediction and reward.

1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:48.140
 So a good example would be reading to a child every night,

1:00:48.140 --> 1:00:49.620
 sitting there and reading.

1:00:49.620 --> 1:00:51.100
 I can recall reading to my niece

1:00:51.100 --> 1:00:53.500
 and seeing her parents read to her,

1:00:53.500 --> 1:00:56.360
 and she had no clue whatsoever with what they were saying,

1:00:56.360 --> 1:00:58.360
 because she, well, at least I don't know,

1:00:58.360 --> 1:00:59.880
 but she certainly couldn't speak,

1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:01.680
 but she liked looking at the pictures,

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.580
 and it was a very predictable sort of interaction.

1:01:04.580 --> 1:01:06.260
 It was, okay, out come the books,

1:01:06.260 --> 1:01:09.020
 it was usually here's the bath, then there's the pajamas,

1:01:09.020 --> 1:01:11.460
 then there's the lights go down, then out comes the book,

1:01:11.460 --> 1:01:13.820
 and then there's the interaction between parent and child,

1:01:13.820 --> 1:01:16.920
 which of course usually also involves physical contact.

1:01:16.920 --> 1:01:18.220
 So it's not like the right brain system

1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:20.260
 and the left brain system are operating separately,

1:01:20.260 --> 1:01:21.900
 they're operating in parallel.

1:01:21.900 --> 1:01:24.020
 But that sort of prediction and reward

1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:25.500
 kids like to be read to

1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:27.980
 is generally mediated by this left brain system.

1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:30.100
 And this carries on as children get older

1:01:30.100 --> 1:01:33.040
 and as parents take on and evolve their parenting roles.

1:01:34.340 --> 1:01:38.940
 It's very apparent that healthy social bonding

1:01:38.940 --> 1:01:40.940
 between children and caretaker

1:01:42.020 --> 1:01:44.860
 relies on the fact that both this right brain system

1:01:44.860 --> 1:01:46.820
 and the left brain system are engaged,

1:01:46.820 --> 1:01:49.940
 that there's a synchronization of autonomic function,

1:01:49.940 --> 1:01:54.260
 meaning a joining together in actual somatic feeling,

1:01:54.260 --> 1:01:58.400
 and that there's a synchronization of experience

1:01:58.400 --> 1:02:01.260
 that's more about some outward or external stimulus,

1:02:01.260 --> 1:02:03.420
 like reading a book or watching a show together,

1:02:03.420 --> 1:02:07.900
 or enjoying some common experience of a meal together.

1:02:07.900 --> 1:02:09.220
 And of course, as children get older,

1:02:09.220 --> 1:02:10.900
 they're able to access more and more

1:02:10.900 --> 1:02:12.620
 cognitively sophisticated things.

1:02:12.620 --> 1:02:13.820
 You can watch a movie with them

1:02:13.820 --> 1:02:15.540
 and they'll make predictions about which characters

1:02:15.540 --> 1:02:17.140
 are going to show up, for instance,

1:02:17.140 --> 1:02:19.860
 or you can take them to a concert

1:02:19.860 --> 1:02:22.620
 and they can appreciate the concert or play in that concert,

1:02:22.620 --> 1:02:24.940
 and they appreciate that they're being appreciated, okay?

1:02:24.940 --> 1:02:26.000
 So there are a million different,

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:27.900
 there's infinite number of examples here,

1:02:27.900 --> 1:02:30.780
 but the idea is that there are two parallel circuits

1:02:30.780 --> 1:02:33.320
 that are important for establishing bonds,

1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:36.340
 and that this is set up very early on in childhood,

1:02:36.340 --> 1:02:40.420
 and that it's neither emotional nor rational, but both.

1:02:40.420 --> 1:02:43.100
 Now, both of these circuits tap into the circuitry

1:02:43.100 --> 1:02:44.460
 that we talked about earlier,

1:02:44.460 --> 1:02:48.580
 where dopamine is released and molecules like serotonin,

1:02:48.580 --> 1:02:50.100
 which again is a neuromodulator

1:02:50.100 --> 1:02:52.900
 more associated with feelings of warmth,

1:02:52.900 --> 1:02:55.760
 comfort, and satisfaction with our immediate surroundings

1:02:55.760 --> 1:02:57.980
 and possessions rather than seeking of things

1:02:57.980 --> 1:03:00.200
 and motivation and drive to go look for things,

1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:01.840
 as is the case with dopamine.

1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:04.420
 So there's still interactions with those systems,

1:03:04.420 --> 1:03:07.300
 but the work of Alan Shore has stimulated

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:10.620
 a lot of interest in what are these circuits

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:13.540
 that underlie these autonomic bonding,

1:03:13.540 --> 1:03:17.580
 this matching of heart rate and breathing,

1:03:17.580 --> 1:03:20.020
 and what are the neural circuits that underlie

1:03:20.020 --> 1:03:24.480
 this bonding or this synchronization of experience

1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:26.540
 on the kind of left brain side.

1:03:26.540 --> 1:03:28.980
 And the reason I find this model so attractive

1:03:28.980 --> 1:03:32.960
 is that it's very clear that healthy child-parent bonds

1:03:32.960 --> 1:03:36.100
 are established not by one or the other

1:03:36.100 --> 1:03:39.100
 of these right brain or left brain systems, but by both.

1:03:39.100 --> 1:03:42.020
 And there isn't enough time to go into it right now,

1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:44.900
 but some of you are probably familiar with this idea

1:03:44.900 --> 1:03:47.780
 of anxious attached versus avoidant attached

1:03:47.780 --> 1:03:51.300
 versus there's a kind of dissociative attached model

1:03:51.300 --> 1:03:53.680
 of infant-parent bonding.

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:56.060
 Just briefly, what's becoming clear

1:03:56.060 --> 1:03:58.500
 from the neurobiological imaging studies

1:03:58.500 --> 1:04:03.180
 is that as people start to advance into adolescence

1:04:03.180 --> 1:04:07.720
 and adulthood and well into their elderly years,

1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:09.700
 the same circuits that were active

1:04:09.700 --> 1:04:12.700
 and established in childhood are repurposed

1:04:12.700 --> 1:04:14.820
 for other forms of attachment.

1:04:14.820 --> 1:04:18.060
 And that to have truly complete bonds

1:04:18.060 --> 1:04:18.980
 with other individuals,

1:04:18.980 --> 1:04:21.540
 but in particular with romantic partners,

1:04:21.540 --> 1:04:24.020
 it's important that there be both synchronization

1:04:24.020 --> 1:04:27.140
 of physiology and synchronization of these more,

1:04:27.140 --> 1:04:29.220
 I guess we could call them more rational

1:04:29.220 --> 1:04:31.540
 or predictive type circuits.

1:04:31.540 --> 1:04:34.020
 So we can leverage this information.

1:04:34.020 --> 1:04:37.240
 We can start to think about what sorts of bonds to us

1:04:37.240 --> 1:04:39.860
 feel very enriching and very complete.

1:04:39.860 --> 1:04:42.060
 We know that we can have, for instance,

1:04:42.060 --> 1:04:44.020
 an emotional connection with somebody,

1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:46.400
 but we can also have a cognitive connection with somebody.

1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:48.860
 I have many colleagues with whom I have

1:04:48.860 --> 1:04:52.780
 deep intellectual connection and convergence with.

1:04:52.780 --> 1:04:56.020
 I wouldn't say that I have deep emotional connection

1:04:56.020 --> 1:04:58.180
 with most of them, a few of them, yes,

1:04:58.180 --> 1:04:59.380
 but most of them, no.

1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:03.140
 Others in my life, for instance,

1:05:03.140 --> 1:05:05.820
 I have a deep emotional connection to,

1:05:05.820 --> 1:05:08.340
 but not a lot of deep cognitive connection to.

1:05:08.340 --> 1:05:10.180
 A good example would be the connection that I had

1:05:10.180 --> 1:05:12.580
 with my bulldog who unfortunately passed away,

1:05:12.580 --> 1:05:17.580
 but Costello, we had a very close emotional connection.

1:05:17.620 --> 1:05:19.500
 It was based on touch, it was based on our walks,

1:05:19.500 --> 1:05:22.900
 it was based on fun, it was very autonomic.

1:05:22.900 --> 1:05:25.880
 We rarely discussed, if ever, what we were doing.

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:27.900
 We had a felt relationship

1:05:27.900 --> 1:05:29.980
 as opposed to a cognitive relationship.

1:05:29.980 --> 1:05:33.640
 And while I'm sort of half kidding about that as an example,

1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:36.300
 it's a really good example, it was a very real bond.

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:38.220
 And in fact, just as a brief anecdote,

1:05:38.220 --> 1:05:40.060
 I can remember when Costello was a puppy

1:05:40.060 --> 1:05:43.240
 and I was entirely responsible for his wellbeing,

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:45.780
 I, like any parent of any infant,

1:05:45.780 --> 1:05:48.460
 I lost my appetite for those few weeks

1:05:48.460 --> 1:05:49.780
 when I was house training him,

1:05:49.780 --> 1:05:52.240
 and I seemed to lose all ability

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:54.060
 to process any cognitive information.

1:05:54.060 --> 1:05:55.640
 Now, I was also sleep deprived,

1:05:55.640 --> 1:05:59.180
 but I was entirely focused on the autonomic bond

1:05:59.180 --> 1:06:00.220
 that we were forming.

1:06:00.220 --> 1:06:01.880
 Now, thankfully, that eventually

1:06:01.880 --> 1:06:03.780
 was established pretty quickly.

1:06:03.780 --> 1:06:06.860
 Basically, I went on to just basically feed him,

1:06:06.860 --> 1:06:08.480
 walk him and do everything for him,

1:06:08.480 --> 1:06:10.740
 and we had a wonderful relationship.

1:06:10.740 --> 1:06:12.700
 Now, it's very clear that what we're talking about here

1:06:12.700 --> 1:06:14.180
 is a form of empathy.

1:06:15.280 --> 1:06:18.220
 Empathy is the ability to feel,

1:06:18.220 --> 1:06:21.580
 or at least think we feel what others feel.

1:06:21.580 --> 1:06:24.840
 Because again, as my colleague and the great bio engineer

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:27.860
 and psychiatrist at Stanford, Carl Deisseroth,

1:06:27.860 --> 1:06:30.500
 has said, and he was a guest on this podcast,

1:06:31.380 --> 1:06:33.440
 we really don't know how other people feel.

1:06:33.440 --> 1:06:34.940
 We just get the sense that perhaps

1:06:34.940 --> 1:06:36.060
 we are feeling the same thing

1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:37.260
 or we're feeling something different

1:06:37.260 --> 1:06:40.060
 and we infer or we project what they might be thinking.

1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:44.700
 Empathy is this sense that we are sensing

1:06:44.700 --> 1:06:46.340
 what other people are sensing, okay?

1:06:46.340 --> 1:06:48.060
 And there's no real way to verify that

1:06:48.060 --> 1:06:49.700
 except if you're measuring physiologies,

1:06:49.700 --> 1:06:51.620
 you could get some insight into that.

1:06:51.620 --> 1:06:52.780
 In the clinical psychology

1:06:52.780 --> 1:06:55.920
 and in the neurobiological literature now,

1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:59.340
 it's understood that there is both emotional empathy,

1:06:59.340 --> 1:07:01.420
 like actually feeling what somebody is feeling,

1:07:01.420 --> 1:07:04.700
 and what is now called cognitive empathy.

1:07:04.700 --> 1:07:06.220
 Cognitive empathy is this idea

1:07:06.220 --> 1:07:09.900
 that we both see and experience something the same way

1:07:09.900 --> 1:07:11.580
 at a mental level.

1:07:11.580 --> 1:07:14.140
 Emotional empathy is this idea that yes,

1:07:14.140 --> 1:07:17.140
 I can feel what you feel at a visceral,

1:07:17.140 --> 1:07:19.780
 somatic or autonomic level.

1:07:19.780 --> 1:07:24.340
 And it's absolutely clear that strong social bonds

1:07:24.340 --> 1:07:26.700
 between children and caretaker

1:07:26.700 --> 1:07:28.500
 involve both emotional empathy,

1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:31.220
 this autonomic function, and cognitive empathy,

1:07:31.220 --> 1:07:33.380
 that there's a mutual understanding

1:07:33.380 --> 1:07:35.980
 of how the other person feels

1:07:35.980 --> 1:07:38.340
 and how the other person thinks

1:07:38.340 --> 1:07:39.840
 in order to be able to make predictions

1:07:39.840 --> 1:07:41.220
 about what they're going to do.

1:07:41.220 --> 1:07:44.100
 It's also very clear based on the emerging literature

1:07:44.100 --> 1:07:45.720
 that romantic relationships,

1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:47.640
 and to some extent friendships,

1:07:47.640 --> 1:07:50.100
 although friendships have been explored a bit less

1:07:50.100 --> 1:07:51.200
 in the literature,

1:07:51.200 --> 1:07:54.100
 that emotional empathy and cognitive empathy

1:07:54.100 --> 1:07:56.660
 are both required in order to establish

1:07:56.660 --> 1:07:58.860
 what we call a trusting social bond.

1:07:58.860 --> 1:08:00.980
 And there's some beautiful experiments done

1:08:00.980 --> 1:08:03.980
 using neuroimaging of two individuals playing a trust game,

1:08:03.980 --> 1:08:05.740
 essentially a game where you're trying to predict

1:08:05.740 --> 1:08:06.840
 the other person's behavior,

1:08:06.840 --> 1:08:09.060
 whether or not they will behave in a trustworthy way.

1:08:09.060 --> 1:08:12.460
 And these experiments tend to use real money,

1:08:12.460 --> 1:08:14.060
 so there's actually something at stake.

1:08:14.060 --> 1:08:15.760
 And you can more or less predict

1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:18.340
 whether or not somebody feels a lot of trust

1:08:18.340 --> 1:08:20.420
 for somebody else and whether or not they believe

1:08:20.420 --> 1:08:23.020
 they will act in a trustworthy manner

1:08:23.020 --> 1:08:25.060
 based on whether or not they have high levels

1:08:25.060 --> 1:08:28.340
 of both cognitive empathy and emotional empathy.

1:08:28.340 --> 1:08:29.660
 So for those of you that are seeking

1:08:29.660 --> 1:08:33.000
 to establish deeper bonds or bonds of any kind,

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.180
 it's important that you think about synchronization

1:08:35.180 --> 1:08:37.660
 of bodily states, we talked about that earlier,

1:08:37.660 --> 1:08:40.060
 and synchronization of cognitive states.

1:08:40.060 --> 1:08:41.780
 Now that doesn't mean you have to agree on everything.

1:08:41.780 --> 1:08:44.860
 In fact, oftentimes people who feel very close

1:08:44.860 --> 1:08:47.700
 to one another cognitively and emotionally

1:08:47.700 --> 1:08:48.860
 argue about all sorts of things

1:08:48.860 --> 1:08:50.220
 and disagree about a lot of things.

1:08:50.220 --> 1:08:51.880
 In fact, we probably know,

1:08:51.880 --> 1:08:54.060
 I certainly know people and couples

1:08:54.060 --> 1:08:56.100
 that seem to bond through arguing,

1:08:56.100 --> 1:08:59.040
 which is an interesting phenotype in itself.

1:08:59.040 --> 1:09:01.700
 But the point isn't that there be total convergence

1:09:01.700 --> 1:09:03.340
 of opinion or stance,

1:09:03.340 --> 1:09:06.460
 but rather that we understand how the other feels

1:09:06.460 --> 1:09:09.100
 and we believe that they understand how we feel,

1:09:09.100 --> 1:09:11.380
 that we understand how the other person thinks,

1:09:11.380 --> 1:09:15.220
 and that they think that we understand how they think.

1:09:15.220 --> 1:09:17.540
 So it's a reciprocal loop between two people

1:09:17.540 --> 1:09:20.540
 that involves this cognition and involves emotion.

1:09:20.540 --> 1:09:24.020
 And it's grounded, as Dr. Schor has pointed out,

1:09:24.020 --> 1:09:26.260
 in our earliest forms of attachment.

1:09:26.260 --> 1:09:27.820
 And that makes perfect sense

1:09:27.820 --> 1:09:29.480
 because the same sorts of circuits

1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:32.260
 that are responsible for social homeostasis,

1:09:32.260 --> 1:09:33.860
 the kind of right brain and left brain circuits

1:09:33.860 --> 1:09:37.220
 that are responsible for infant-mother attachment,

1:09:37.220 --> 1:09:39.860
 and then later for more intellectual

1:09:39.860 --> 1:09:43.340
 or predictive type attachments between child and caregiver

1:09:43.340 --> 1:09:45.900
 are the exact same circuits that we superimpose

1:09:45.900 --> 1:09:47.980
 into all other types of relationships

1:09:47.980 --> 1:09:49.800
 throughout the rest of our life.

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:52.180
 And I should just mention that for those of you

1:09:52.180 --> 1:09:57.180
 that might be thinking that you had a less than satisfactory

1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:01.640
 infant-caretaker interaction or form of attachment,

1:10:01.640 --> 1:10:02.720
 you are not alone.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:05.740
 And in fact, much of the work that Dr. Schor focuses on

1:10:05.740 --> 1:10:08.420
 is about how those early circumstances

1:10:08.420 --> 1:10:10.520
 can be understood and rewired

1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:13.100
 toward the development of healthy adult attachment.

1:10:13.100 --> 1:10:15.020
 And if you want to check out his work,

1:10:15.020 --> 1:10:18.220
 he's actually got a few YouTube videos out there.

1:10:18.220 --> 1:10:21.340
 Again, it's Alan Schor, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E.

1:10:21.340 --> 1:10:23.340
 I'd love to get him as a guest on the podcast.

1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:26.260
 He also has a book, it's called Right Brain Psychotherapy,

1:10:26.260 --> 1:10:27.400
 and it's an excellent book.

1:10:27.400 --> 1:10:28.540
 It's actually pretty accessible,

1:10:28.540 --> 1:10:29.700
 even if you don't have a background

1:10:29.700 --> 1:10:32.360
 in biology or psychology.

1:10:32.360 --> 1:10:34.260
 I found it to be very interesting.

1:10:34.260 --> 1:10:36.060
 There are a lot of excellent references.

1:10:36.060 --> 1:10:37.500
 And again, if you're listening,

1:10:37.500 --> 1:10:38.920
 Dr. Schor or you know Alan Schor,

1:10:38.920 --> 1:10:41.020
 we'd love to get you on the podcast.

1:10:41.020 --> 1:10:42.780
 One of the key themes to understand

1:10:42.780 --> 1:10:46.260
 about biological processes is that they often work

1:10:46.260 --> 1:10:48.660
 on short timescales and longer timescales.

1:10:48.660 --> 1:10:50.420
 And up until now, we've mainly been talking

1:10:50.420 --> 1:10:52.740
 about the stuff that happens on short timescales.

1:10:52.740 --> 1:10:54.660
 So the kind of synchronization of heart rate

1:10:54.660 --> 1:10:56.780
 or activation of a given set of neurons

1:10:56.780 --> 1:10:58.420
 that dumps some dopamine and causes us

1:10:58.420 --> 1:11:02.780
 to seek out more social interaction or less, for instance.

1:11:02.780 --> 1:11:06.100
 But every biological circuit and function needs

1:11:06.100 --> 1:11:08.780
 to have longstanding effects as well.

1:11:08.780 --> 1:11:09.900
 And typically when you're thinking

1:11:09.900 --> 1:11:12.380
 about longstanding effects in the brain and body,

1:11:12.380 --> 1:11:14.340
 you start looking towards the hormone system.

1:11:14.340 --> 1:11:16.940
 It's not always the case, but more often than not,

1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:19.900
 neurotransmitters and neuromodulators are pretty quick,

1:11:19.900 --> 1:11:22.140
 whereas hormones have longer lasting effects.

1:11:22.140 --> 1:11:24.180
 In fact, a lot of hormones can actually travel

1:11:24.180 --> 1:11:26.060
 to the nucleus of a cell and actually change

1:11:26.060 --> 1:11:28.060
 which genes are expressed.

1:11:28.060 --> 1:11:32.140
 So if ever there was a hormone or hormone-like molecule

1:11:32.140 --> 1:11:35.940
 that's associated with social bonding, it's oxytocin.

1:11:35.940 --> 1:11:39.140
 And oxytocin has gotten a ton of interest

1:11:39.140 --> 1:11:40.420
 in the popular press.

1:11:40.420 --> 1:11:42.540
 I don't know why that is, but perhaps it's because

1:11:42.540 --> 1:11:43.540
 of all the incredible things

1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:46.220
 that oxytocin is associated with.

1:11:46.220 --> 1:11:48.700
 And it is indeed a lot of things.

1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:52.500
 So for instance, oxytocin is released in the brain

1:11:52.500 --> 1:11:55.540
 and binds to receptors in different locations in the body.

1:11:55.540 --> 1:11:57.180
 And the moment you hear different locations

1:11:57.180 --> 1:11:59.940
 in the body, receptors, you should think,

1:11:59.940 --> 1:12:01.660
 well, it's going to have lots of different effects.

1:12:01.660 --> 1:12:02.860
 And indeed it does.

1:12:02.860 --> 1:12:05.820
 Oxytocin is involved in orgasm.

1:12:05.820 --> 1:12:08.500
 It's involved in social recognition.

1:12:08.500 --> 1:12:09.340
 That's right.

1:12:09.340 --> 1:12:11.900
 When you see people that you consider your people,

1:12:11.900 --> 1:12:16.380
 your team, your group, your friends, oxytocin is released.

1:12:16.380 --> 1:12:19.700
 Even if you don't come into physical contact with them.

1:12:19.700 --> 1:12:22.180
 Oxytocin is also associated with pair bonding,

1:12:22.180 --> 1:12:24.820
 the feeling that they are your person

1:12:24.820 --> 1:12:27.520
 and that you are their person is a common language

1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:28.580
 people use.

1:12:28.580 --> 1:12:31.440
 It's also associated with honesty.

1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:33.140
 Believe it or not, there are experiments that show

1:12:33.140 --> 1:12:37.320
 that if people receive oxytocin through an inhalation spray,

1:12:37.320 --> 1:12:39.300
 that they will be more honest and forthcoming

1:12:39.300 --> 1:12:40.840
 about certain things.

1:12:40.840 --> 1:12:44.740
 And the oxytocin system and variants in the oxytocin system

1:12:44.740 --> 1:12:46.620
 have also been associated with autism

1:12:46.620 --> 1:12:48.660
 and various autism spectrum disorders.

1:12:48.660 --> 1:12:51.020
 So there's a huge range of behaviors that it's involved in

1:12:51.020 --> 1:12:53.060
 because you have receptors for oxytocin

1:12:53.060 --> 1:12:54.740
 and lots of different brain structures

1:12:54.740 --> 1:12:56.780
 and areas of the body that do different things.

1:12:56.780 --> 1:12:59.580
 However, there's some very consistent effects of oxytocin

1:12:59.580 --> 1:13:00.980
 that are worth just listing off.

1:13:00.980 --> 1:13:04.000
 And then I'm going to talk about two separate pathways

1:13:04.000 --> 1:13:07.320
 by which oxytocin can manifest its effects

1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:09.380
 and how you can actually regulate oxytocin

1:13:09.380 --> 1:13:13.220
 in ways that are interesting and perhaps useful as well.

1:13:13.220 --> 1:13:15.160
 First of all, oxytocin is involved

1:13:15.160 --> 1:13:18.380
 in the milk letdown reflex, lactation.

1:13:18.380 --> 1:13:19.420
 This makes perfect sense.

1:13:19.420 --> 1:13:23.620
 There needs to be a cue by which the suckling on the nipple

1:13:23.620 --> 1:13:27.060
 of the infant causes the release or letdown of milk

1:13:27.060 --> 1:13:29.860
 and milk letdown and lactation is controlled by prolactin,

1:13:29.860 --> 1:13:31.860
 another hormone, but also oxytocin.

1:13:33.180 --> 1:13:36.180
 Oxytocin is also involved in uterine contraction

1:13:36.180 --> 1:13:38.320
 during childbirth.

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:39.900
 It's involved in cervical dilation

1:13:39.900 --> 1:13:43.520
 to allow the baby to pass out of the birth canal.

1:13:43.520 --> 1:13:47.660
 So it's involved in induction of breastfeeding and of labor,

1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:50.180
 which is remarkable and especially remarkable

1:13:50.180 --> 1:13:52.580
 given that in males, or at least in some male animals

1:13:52.580 --> 1:13:54.880
 and in some male humans, and I do want to say some,

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:55.840
 and I'll get back to this,

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:58.140
 it can be involved in the erection response.

1:13:58.140 --> 1:14:00.100
 It can be involved in the orgasm response

1:14:00.100 --> 1:14:01.400
 in both males and females.

1:14:01.400 --> 1:14:03.780
 Although there, there's a very interesting difference.

1:14:03.780 --> 1:14:06.500
 There's a little bit of controversy about this,

1:14:06.500 --> 1:14:10.500
 but it does appear that in females,

1:14:10.500 --> 1:14:15.460
 sexual stimulation and orgasm cause the release of oxytocin,

1:14:15.460 --> 1:14:17.580
 whereas in males, sexual stimulation

1:14:17.580 --> 1:14:19.660
 does not cause the release of oxytocin,

1:14:19.660 --> 1:14:22.320
 but rather a different molecule vasopressin

1:14:22.320 --> 1:14:24.920
 is triggered by sexual stimulation.

1:14:24.920 --> 1:14:27.840
 But orgasm does trigger the release of oxytocin in males,

1:14:27.840 --> 1:14:31.060
 but with a delay of about 30 minutes.

1:14:31.060 --> 1:14:34.140
 Why that is and the specific function of that is not clear,

1:14:34.140 --> 1:14:36.440
 but it does seem that oxytocin is involved

1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:39.380
 in the sexual response in both males and females.

1:14:39.380 --> 1:14:42.460
 The main types of interactions that release oxytocin

1:14:42.460 --> 1:14:45.240
 at high levels are, first of all,

1:14:45.240 --> 1:14:47.920
 that the interaction be between individuals

1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:52.600
 that see each other as very closely associated, right?

1:14:52.600 --> 1:14:55.740
 So a infant and mother are very closely associated,

1:14:55.740 --> 1:14:57.520
 whether or not it's an adopted infant or not.

1:14:57.520 --> 1:14:59.020
 Oftentimes they are in close contact.

1:14:59.020 --> 1:15:01.860
 Oftentimes they are from the very body of the other.

1:15:01.860 --> 1:15:05.240
 And so the amount or the amplitude of oxytocin release

1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:08.380
 tends to scale with how closely associated individuals are.

1:15:08.380 --> 1:15:11.500
 Just the sight of one's baby or smell of one's baby

1:15:11.500 --> 1:15:15.040
 can evoke oxytocin release and vice versa from the mother.

1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:17.180
 Physical contact even more so.

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:20.640
 In romantic partners, physical contact,

1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:22.960
 even the sight of a picture of a partner

1:15:22.960 --> 1:15:27.620
 can evoke oxytocin release and sexual desire, also trust.

1:15:27.620 --> 1:15:29.620
 So there's this whole collection of psychological

1:15:29.620 --> 1:15:31.880
 and physiological things that are packaged

1:15:31.880 --> 1:15:34.100
 into the oxytocin system.

1:15:34.100 --> 1:15:36.560
 It's not just a one-way system.

1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:38.780
 Now, a lot of people out there have written to me

1:15:38.780 --> 1:15:41.320
 asking about inhalant oxytocin,

1:15:41.320 --> 1:15:43.720
 asking whether or not that can actually increase

1:15:43.720 --> 1:15:46.080
 the depth or rate of pair bonding.

1:15:46.080 --> 1:15:48.380
 And there does seem to be some evidence for that.

1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:51.240
 Now, I think in most places, oxytocin is prescription,

1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:53.740
 although it might be over the counter in others.

1:15:53.740 --> 1:15:55.500
 I don't know, you have to check where you are.

1:15:55.500 --> 1:15:56.900
 As far as I know, you can't just go out

1:15:56.900 --> 1:15:59.780
 and buy oxytocin nasal spray, although you may be able to.

1:15:59.780 --> 1:16:01.860
 Forgive me, I'm naive to that point.

1:16:01.860 --> 1:16:05.940
 But it's interesting to note that some drugs

1:16:05.940 --> 1:16:07.640
 that are being used in clinical trials

1:16:07.640 --> 1:16:09.880
 for things like trauma and are also used

1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:12.980
 in clinical therapeutic settings for increasing bonding,

1:16:12.980 --> 1:16:16.360
 in particular MDMA, also called ecstasy,

1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:18.800
 increase dopamine and serotonin.

1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:19.800
 We know this.

1:16:19.800 --> 1:16:22.960
 Dopamine and serotonin have a vast number of effects

1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:23.880
 throughout the brain and body

1:16:23.880 --> 1:16:25.240
 that I've talked about some of them today

1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:26.620
 in another podcast.

1:16:26.620 --> 1:16:31.020
 But one of the lesser appreciated effects of MDMA

1:16:31.020 --> 1:16:33.200
 is that it causes huge increases,

1:16:33.200 --> 1:16:35.580
 massive increases in the amount of oxytocin

1:16:35.580 --> 1:16:38.140
 that's released into the brain and body.

1:16:38.140 --> 1:16:40.380
 And MDMA-assisted psychotherapy,

1:16:40.380 --> 1:16:43.080
 while still illegal, as far as I know,

1:16:43.080 --> 1:16:44.060
 certainly in the United States,

1:16:44.060 --> 1:16:45.780
 but in most places throughout the world,

1:16:45.780 --> 1:16:47.800
 is being explored in clinical trials,

1:16:47.800 --> 1:16:49.880
 not just for trauma, not just for depression,

1:16:49.880 --> 1:16:50.980
 not just for eating disorders,

1:16:50.980 --> 1:16:55.300
 but also for reestablishing what seem to be fractured

1:16:55.300 --> 1:16:57.940
 or challenged bonds between romantic partners.

1:16:57.940 --> 1:17:00.100
 And while most of the attention has been focused

1:17:00.100 --> 1:17:03.700
 on the dopaminergic and serotonergic aspects

1:17:03.700 --> 1:17:06.460
 of the MDMA response, it's clear to me,

1:17:06.460 --> 1:17:08.060
 based on my read of the literature,

1:17:08.060 --> 1:17:10.900
 that the enormously elevated oxytocin

1:17:10.900 --> 1:17:14.400
 that occurs during the consumption of MDMA

1:17:14.400 --> 1:17:17.100
 is part of the reason why people experience

1:17:17.100 --> 1:17:20.820
 during the MDMA session and post-MDMA session

1:17:20.820 --> 1:17:24.620
 a much greater degree and depth of kinship

1:17:24.620 --> 1:17:26.700
 or feeling of connection with that person.

1:17:26.700 --> 1:17:28.380
 And it's important to point out

1:17:28.380 --> 1:17:31.740
 that that feeling of connection is of the autonomic type

1:17:31.740 --> 1:17:33.060
 that I was referring to earlier,

1:17:33.060 --> 1:17:36.240
 a la Alan Shore's work, that it's not of the,

1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:38.220
 oh, we think about things the exact same way,

1:17:38.220 --> 1:17:39.560
 we agree on everything now,

1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:43.260
 it's more of that their physiologies are synchronized.

1:17:43.260 --> 1:17:47.160
 So much so that even in individuals within a couple

1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:50.880
 where one does a therapeutic session and the other does not,

1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:54.060
 they still both feel quite more bonded to the other.

1:17:54.060 --> 1:17:56.540
 Now, oftentimes in the clinical therapeutic setting,

1:17:56.540 --> 1:17:59.360
 both members of a couple or romantic partnership,

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:03.820
 whatever that form it may take, are consuming MDMA

1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:08.020
 and then thereby experiencing elevated oxytocin

1:18:08.020 --> 1:18:09.580
 and this enhanced sense of bonding.

1:18:09.580 --> 1:18:11.420
 And again, it's this autonomic bonding,

1:18:11.420 --> 1:18:13.660
 but it's so powerful,

1:18:13.660 --> 1:18:15.860
 meaning the oxytocin response is so powerful

1:18:15.860 --> 1:18:18.820
 that it doesn't even require that both individuals

1:18:18.820 --> 1:18:21.100
 experience this huge inflection in oxytocin

1:18:21.100 --> 1:18:23.740
 and that's because one person's physiology

1:18:23.740 --> 1:18:24.900
 is influencing the other

1:18:24.900 --> 1:18:28.380
 and oxytocin is this kind of bridging signal

1:18:28.380 --> 1:18:30.100
 that occurs in both nervous systems,

1:18:30.100 --> 1:18:31.780
 synchronizes things like heartbeat.

1:18:31.780 --> 1:18:34.120
 Obviously it's associated with touch

1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:36.220
 and so if people are touching or people are engaging

1:18:36.220 --> 1:18:37.920
 in the sorts of behaviors that I mentioned earlier

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:40.700
 that can increase oxytocin further,

1:18:40.700 --> 1:18:43.260
 that's going to further increase the depth of the bond.

1:18:43.260 --> 1:18:47.120
 But the point here is that there's actually a hormonal glue

1:18:47.120 --> 1:18:48.940
 between individuals, okay?

1:18:48.940 --> 1:18:52.100
 Infant and mother, friends, teammates,

1:18:52.100 --> 1:18:53.780
 romantic partners and so on

1:18:53.780 --> 1:18:56.820
 and that hormonal glue is oxytocin.

1:18:56.820 --> 1:19:00.580
 Now, people vary in the extent to which they feel

1:19:00.580 --> 1:19:04.340
 or have the capacity to feel bonded to anyone.

1:19:04.340 --> 1:19:07.280
 And it is now generally understood

1:19:07.280 --> 1:19:09.380
 that some of that variation

1:19:09.380 --> 1:19:12.820
 might depend on variations in oxytocin receptors

1:19:12.820 --> 1:19:16.000
 or what are called gene polymorphisms for oxytocin.

1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:18.500
 Genes can have a number of different sequences in them.

1:19:18.500 --> 1:19:19.700
 They're nucleotide sequences.

1:19:19.700 --> 1:19:21.140
 We won't go into genetics right now.

1:19:21.140 --> 1:19:23.780
 As and Gs and Cs and Ts in various combinations

1:19:23.780 --> 1:19:24.740
 are what make up the genes.

1:19:24.740 --> 1:19:27.780
 Genes are transcribed into RNA.

1:19:27.780 --> 1:19:32.780
 RNA is translated into proteins that affect cells, okay?

1:19:32.980 --> 1:19:35.780
 The oxytocin gene encodes for oxytocin

1:19:35.780 --> 1:19:38.660
 and variants in that gene change the amount

1:19:38.660 --> 1:19:41.580
 and function of oxytocin.

1:19:41.580 --> 1:19:43.780
 There's a really interesting study

1:19:43.780 --> 1:19:46.640
 published just this last year in a relatively new journal.

1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:48.720
 That journal has a kind of a unusual name.

1:19:48.720 --> 1:19:51.360
 It's Helion, I think it's Helion and not Helion,

1:19:51.360 --> 1:19:53.640
 but Helion, H-E-L-I-Y-O-N.

1:19:53.640 --> 1:19:55.420
 This is a cell press journal.

1:19:55.420 --> 1:19:57.820
 As far as I can tell, it's a very solid journal.

1:19:57.820 --> 1:20:01.460
 Certainly the cell press label is very stringent.

1:20:01.460 --> 1:20:04.060
 And this paper is entitled

1:20:04.060 --> 1:20:07.740
 the relation between oxytocin receptor gene polymorphisms,

1:20:07.740 --> 1:20:12.100
 which just means changes in genes or variations in genes,

1:20:12.100 --> 1:20:15.300
 adult attachment and Instagram sociability,

1:20:15.300 --> 1:20:16.660
 an exploratory analysis.

1:20:16.660 --> 1:20:19.000
 This is a really wild study, but I like the study.

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:19.840
 It's very thorough.

1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:23.940
 First author, last name Carollo, C-A-R-O-L-L-O.

1:20:23.940 --> 1:20:28.660
 And what they found was that by analyzing the genetics

1:20:28.660 --> 1:20:32.080
 of different individuals who are on social media

1:20:32.080 --> 1:20:36.820
 and looking at how many people those individuals follow

1:20:36.820 --> 1:20:39.700
 and how many people follow them

1:20:39.700 --> 1:20:41.100
 and what they come up with

1:20:41.100 --> 1:20:44.080
 is a so-called social desirability index.

1:20:44.080 --> 1:20:47.820
 They were able to correlate in a very straightforward way

1:20:47.820 --> 1:20:50.340
 that people that carry certain variants

1:20:50.340 --> 1:20:53.760
 in the oxytocin and oxytocin receptor genes

1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:56.260
 actually seek out more online

1:20:56.260 --> 1:20:58.860
 social Instagram interactions.

1:20:58.860 --> 1:21:01.980
 So some people I know, I won't name their names,

1:21:01.980 --> 1:21:05.660
 only follow anywhere from zero to six accounts.

1:21:05.660 --> 1:21:08.760
 Other people follow thousands of accounts

1:21:08.760 --> 1:21:11.760
 and they take the ratio of how many accounts people follow

1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:13.700
 versus how many followers they have.

1:21:13.700 --> 1:21:15.260
 Arguably not a perfect measure,

1:21:15.260 --> 1:21:17.400
 but a nice one in the sense that you can do this

1:21:17.400 --> 1:21:19.240
 in a completely unbiased way

1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:21.620
 with many, many thousands of subjects.

1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:24.380
 And then they were able to get genomic analysis

1:21:24.380 --> 1:21:26.020
 from a number of these subjects.

1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:29.100
 And it turns out that people who have,

1:21:29.100 --> 1:21:33.040
 let's say higher levels of oxytocin function

1:21:33.040 --> 1:21:37.020
 or potential levels of oxytocin function

1:21:37.020 --> 1:21:40.980
 actively seek out more social interactions on social media.

1:21:40.980 --> 1:21:43.300
 So this I think represents an important first

1:21:43.300 --> 1:21:46.380
 in the area of how social media and data from social media

1:21:46.380 --> 1:21:49.060
 are starting to merge with biological data

1:21:49.060 --> 1:21:51.860
 in terms of predicting how avidly people

1:21:51.860 --> 1:21:55.140
 will seek out social interactions of an online type.

1:21:55.140 --> 1:21:58.260
 And nowadays we hear a lot about how online

1:21:58.260 --> 1:22:00.940
 we are connected, but we're not really, what is it?

1:22:00.940 --> 1:22:02.700
 We're communicating, but we're not connected

1:22:02.700 --> 1:22:04.180
 or the connections aren't real.

1:22:04.180 --> 1:22:06.060
 I think we're going to need to revisit that.

1:22:06.060 --> 1:22:07.960
 While I'm certainly a believer in the idea

1:22:07.960 --> 1:22:10.960
 that face-to-face communication and common interactions

1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:14.100
 with people standing in the same space

1:22:14.100 --> 1:22:16.620
 or playing sports together, enjoying music together,

1:22:16.620 --> 1:22:18.900
 enjoying meals together is vitally important.

1:22:18.900 --> 1:22:22.140
 There's an entire generation or several generations

1:22:22.140 --> 1:22:23.980
 of people that are coming up

1:22:23.980 --> 1:22:27.340
 who much of their social interaction has been online.

1:22:27.340 --> 1:22:28.540
 And if you think about it,

1:22:28.540 --> 1:22:30.980
 all of the things that we've spelled out earlier

1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:33.540
 about common mental narrative,

1:22:33.540 --> 1:22:35.740
 this left brain system, a la Alan Shore,

1:22:35.740 --> 1:22:39.900
 or autonomic bonding or synchronization of heartbeats

1:22:39.900 --> 1:22:41.220
 according to common stories,

1:22:41.220 --> 1:22:44.460
 all that is happening in online social interactions.

1:22:44.460 --> 1:22:48.360
 When a thousand of us look at the exact same Instagram post,

1:22:48.360 --> 1:22:51.940
 yes, we will have a thousand independent responses to that,

1:22:51.940 --> 1:22:54.900
 but chances are many of us have a similar or same response

1:22:54.900 --> 1:22:56.840
 based on the data that we talked about earlier

1:22:56.840 --> 1:22:58.340
 in synchronization of heartbeats.

1:22:58.340 --> 1:23:01.340
 And so we are socially bonded with other people

1:23:01.340 --> 1:23:02.660
 through social media.

1:23:02.660 --> 1:23:05.500
 And it's very apparent that the oxytocin system

1:23:05.500 --> 1:23:07.620
 is playing some role in that.

1:23:07.620 --> 1:23:10.440
 And this, if we zoom out, makes perfect sense,

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:15.380
 because again, dopamine, serotonin, prolactin, oxytocin,

1:23:15.380 --> 1:23:18.620
 none of these systems were placed in us

1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:23.060
 or are organized within us in order to encourage specific

1:23:23.060 --> 1:23:25.820
 and only specific types of social interactions.

1:23:25.820 --> 1:23:28.020
 The one that we can say is absolutely critical

1:23:28.020 --> 1:23:30.340
 is the child-parent interaction, right?

1:23:30.340 --> 1:23:32.120
 Because children simply can't take care of themselves,

1:23:32.120 --> 1:23:33.180
 they need a caretaker.

1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:35.100
 I should have said caretaker, not parent.

1:23:35.100 --> 1:23:38.540
 But infants, if they're not taking care, will die.

1:23:38.540 --> 1:23:42.540
 But beyond that, we have evolved or come to realize

1:23:42.540 --> 1:23:44.720
 many different types of social interactions.

1:23:44.720 --> 1:23:48.140
 And online interactions nowadays are very, very common.

1:23:48.140 --> 1:23:49.220
 I'm certainly involved in them.

1:23:49.220 --> 1:23:50.600
 I'm guessing you're involved in them as well.

1:23:50.600 --> 1:23:53.660
 We're involved in one right now, for example.

1:23:53.660 --> 1:23:56.820
 The oxytocin system is absolutely threaded through

1:23:56.820 --> 1:23:59.460
 and largely responsible for those types

1:23:59.460 --> 1:24:01.320
 of social bonds as well.

1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:04.220
 And incidentally, oxytocin is the name of the fifth song

1:24:04.220 --> 1:24:07.100
 on Billie Eilish's second album, Happier Than Ever.

1:24:07.100 --> 1:24:09.160
 So we've covered a lot about the biology

1:24:09.160 --> 1:24:11.420
 and indeed the neural circuitry and neurochemistry

1:24:11.420 --> 1:24:15.240
 and neuroendocrinology of social bonding.

1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:17.740
 I want to make sure that I highlight the key features

1:24:17.740 --> 1:24:21.140
 that go into any and all of your social bonds.

1:24:21.140 --> 1:24:24.320
 First of all, all social bonds have the potential

1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:27.220
 to include both what we called emotional empathy

1:24:27.220 --> 1:24:28.620
 and cognitive empathy.

1:24:28.620 --> 1:24:31.060
 And so if you are interested in establishing

1:24:31.060 --> 1:24:33.980
 and deepening social bonds of any kind,

1:24:33.980 --> 1:24:36.540
 it's important that you put some effort

1:24:36.540 --> 1:24:39.380
 toward this thing that we call emotional empathy,

1:24:39.380 --> 1:24:42.820
 which is really about sharing autonomic experience.

1:24:42.820 --> 1:24:43.960
 Now, depending on the relationship,

1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:45.260
 that will take on different contexts.

1:24:45.260 --> 1:24:47.020
 What's appropriate in one type of bond

1:24:47.020 --> 1:24:49.340
 is not going to be appropriate in another type of bond.

1:24:49.340 --> 1:24:50.740
 Physical contact, for instance,

1:24:50.740 --> 1:24:52.960
 is appropriate for certain types of bonds

1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:54.600
 and not for others.

1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:58.540
 Nonetheless, emotional empathy and the synchronization

1:24:58.540 --> 1:25:02.060
 of autonomic function, heart rate, breathing, et cetera,

1:25:02.060 --> 1:25:03.820
 can be best accomplished by paying attention

1:25:03.820 --> 1:25:07.440
 to external events, in particular narrative, story, music,

1:25:07.440 --> 1:25:10.040
 and perhaps sports or other types of experience

1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:12.780
 as an external stimulus to drive synchrony

1:25:12.780 --> 1:25:15.200
 of those internal states.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:16.860
 The other aspect of forming deep bonds

1:25:16.860 --> 1:25:18.940
 is cognitive empathy.

1:25:18.940 --> 1:25:22.980
 Again, cognitive empathy is not about agreeing on things

1:25:22.980 --> 1:25:25.020
 or viewing things the exact same way.

1:25:25.020 --> 1:25:27.380
 It's about really gaining understanding

1:25:27.380 --> 1:25:30.100
 of how somebody else thinks about something,

1:25:30.100 --> 1:25:31.440
 really paying attention to that,

1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:35.180
 and then paying attention to how you think about

1:25:35.180 --> 1:25:36.740
 and feel about something.

1:25:36.740 --> 1:25:38.300
 So that's what cognitive empathy is.

1:25:38.300 --> 1:25:40.660
 So emotional and cognitive empathy together

1:25:40.660 --> 1:25:43.460
 are what make up these really robust bonds

1:25:43.460 --> 1:25:45.060
 of various kinds.

1:25:45.060 --> 1:25:48.020
 Now, we also talked about introversion and extroversion,

1:25:48.020 --> 1:25:51.540
 and I'd like to try and dismantle the common misperceptions

1:25:51.540 --> 1:25:52.980
 about introversion and extroversion,

1:25:52.980 --> 1:25:54.420
 because when we look at the neural circuitry,

1:25:54.420 --> 1:25:57.520
 as you recall, introverts are not people

1:25:57.520 --> 1:25:59.700
 that don't like social interaction.

1:25:59.700 --> 1:26:03.360
 It's just that they feel filled up or sated

1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:07.540
 by less social interaction than would be an extrovert.

1:26:07.540 --> 1:26:08.700
 And that's because,

1:26:08.700 --> 1:26:11.660
 at least according to the social homeostasis circuit model,

1:26:11.660 --> 1:26:13.620
 they actually get more dopamine

1:26:13.620 --> 1:26:16.060
 from less social interaction, okay?

1:26:16.060 --> 1:26:19.580
 It's like somebody who's sated by less amount of food, okay?

1:26:19.580 --> 1:26:21.640
 It doesn't mean they don't have the same appetite.

1:26:21.640 --> 1:26:24.380
 It just means that they get more from less.

1:26:24.380 --> 1:26:28.760
 Whereas extroverts get less dopamine release

1:26:28.760 --> 1:26:31.300
 from an equivalent amount of social interaction.

1:26:31.300 --> 1:26:33.180
 And of course, these aren't precise measurements,

1:26:33.180 --> 1:26:36.520
 but on the whole, extroverts need more social interaction,

1:26:36.520 --> 1:26:39.480
 more frequent, more long-lasting, et cetera,

1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:41.520
 in order to achieve that dopamine threshold.

1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:43.800
 Because again, dopamine is driving

1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:46.420
 that craving of social interaction.

1:26:46.420 --> 1:26:48.500
 And once it's met, then people don't feel

1:26:48.500 --> 1:26:51.200
 like they have to seek social interaction as much.

1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:52.780
 So for those of you that feel

1:26:52.780 --> 1:26:54.980
 as if you're an introvert or extrovert,

1:26:54.980 --> 1:26:57.100
 or that know introverts and extroverts,

1:26:57.100 --> 1:26:59.700
 it's not about how verbal people are.

1:26:59.700 --> 1:27:01.340
 It's not about how much they seek out

1:27:01.340 --> 1:27:03.420
 social interactions per se.

1:27:03.420 --> 1:27:05.260
 It's about how much social interaction

1:27:05.260 --> 1:27:08.120
 is enough for the given person.

1:27:08.120 --> 1:27:10.200
 Now, the whole reason for providing this framework,

1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:12.820
 this biological circuitry, et cetera,

1:27:12.820 --> 1:27:15.760
 is not to simply put a reductionist view

1:27:15.760 --> 1:27:18.220
 on things that you already realized and knew,

1:27:18.220 --> 1:27:20.220
 but rather to give you some leverage points

1:27:20.220 --> 1:27:23.340
 to understand how is it that you form social bonds?

1:27:23.340 --> 1:27:24.620
 How is it that you might be challenged

1:27:24.620 --> 1:27:26.580
 in forming certain types of social bonds?

1:27:26.580 --> 1:27:28.500
 And to think about entry points

1:27:28.500 --> 1:27:31.240
 to both establishing and reinforcing social bonds

1:27:31.240 --> 1:27:32.620
 of different kinds.

1:27:32.620 --> 1:27:34.540
 Hopefully, it will also give you insight

1:27:34.540 --> 1:27:37.940
 into why breakups, whether it be between friendships

1:27:37.940 --> 1:27:40.620
 or romantic partners, can be so painful.

1:27:40.620 --> 1:27:43.180
 A breakup of any kind involves both a breaking

1:27:43.180 --> 1:27:46.340
 of that emotional empathy and that cognitive empathy.

1:27:46.340 --> 1:27:49.660
 And indeed, it has a neurobiological

1:27:49.660 --> 1:27:51.140
 and hormonal underpinning, right?

1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:54.300
 We go into some sense a social isolation,

1:27:54.300 --> 1:27:56.780
 even if we're surrounded by other types of people.

1:27:56.780 --> 1:27:59.580
 If one of our major sources of oxytocin

1:27:59.580 --> 1:28:01.860
 or one of our major sources of dopamine

1:28:01.860 --> 1:28:03.740
 suddenly is not around,

1:28:03.740 --> 1:28:06.860
 that is incredibly devastating to a nervous system.

1:28:06.860 --> 1:28:09.360
 And to borrow from the great psychologist

1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:11.600
 and neurobiologist, Lisa Feldman Barrett,

1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:14.200
 who says, you know, we are not just individuals,

1:28:14.200 --> 1:28:17.460
 we are nervous systems influencing other nervous systems,

1:28:17.460 --> 1:28:19.340
 and their nervous systems are influencing us.

1:28:19.340 --> 1:28:21.400
 I think that's the right way to think about it.

1:28:21.400 --> 1:28:23.380
 So it should come as no surprise

1:28:23.380 --> 1:28:26.400
 that breakups of various kinds are very challenging,

1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:29.620
 regardless of what underlied that breakup,

1:28:29.620 --> 1:28:31.780
 whether or not somebody moving or an actual decision

1:28:31.780 --> 1:28:35.300
 of one person to leave the relationship or both, et cetera.

1:28:35.300 --> 1:28:39.140
 On the more positive side, largely biological,

1:28:39.140 --> 1:28:43.300
 but to some extent, psychological view of social bonding

1:28:43.300 --> 1:28:46.900
 will also allow you to orient in this vast landscape

1:28:46.900 --> 1:28:48.660
 that we call social bonds,

1:28:48.660 --> 1:28:50.480
 to understand why it is perhaps

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:52.480
 that you seek out so many online interactions.

1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:55.880
 Maybe you have the oxytocin polymorphism

1:28:55.880 --> 1:28:57.740
 that causes you to want more,

1:28:57.740 --> 1:29:00.100
 follow more accounts or interact more with people

1:29:00.100 --> 1:29:02.660
 and comment more, respond to comments, who knows?

1:29:04.940 --> 1:29:06.460
 I'm also hoping that it will allow you

1:29:06.460 --> 1:29:09.720
 to get a lens into how you can strengthen the social bonds

1:29:09.720 --> 1:29:11.100
 that you want to strengthen

1:29:11.100 --> 1:29:12.700
 and to establish new social bonds

1:29:12.700 --> 1:29:14.620
 that you want to establish.

1:29:14.620 --> 1:29:16.780
 None of this is meant to manipulate

1:29:16.780 --> 1:29:19.940
 or leverage social bonds that wouldn't otherwise form.

1:29:19.940 --> 1:29:22.180
 To the contrary, it's about identifying

1:29:22.180 --> 1:29:24.460
 what are the specific routes

1:29:24.460 --> 1:29:27.140
 by which social bonds are created

1:29:27.140 --> 1:29:31.780
 and allowing you, I hope, to work with people

1:29:31.780 --> 1:29:34.520
 that you feel challenged in forming social bonds with,

1:29:34.520 --> 1:29:36.540
 or maybe deciding to completely divorce

1:29:36.540 --> 1:29:38.140
 from those social bonds entirely

1:29:38.140 --> 1:29:39.340
 because there's absolutely no hope

1:29:39.340 --> 1:29:41.940
 of ever forming emotional or cognitive empathy.

1:29:41.940 --> 1:29:44.220
 I certainly acknowledge that that could be the case too.

1:29:44.220 --> 1:29:46.540
 So there's both a light and a dark and a gray zone

1:29:46.540 --> 1:29:48.620
 to this entire thing that we call social bonding.

1:29:48.620 --> 1:29:52.540
 What is not graded, but is absolute, as they say,

1:29:52.540 --> 1:29:54.900
 is that social bonds are vitally important

1:29:54.900 --> 1:29:56.340
 to us as a species,

1:29:56.340 --> 1:29:58.820
 whether or not they are at a distance over social media,

1:29:58.820 --> 1:30:00.340
 whether or not they are in close proximity,

1:30:00.340 --> 1:30:02.460
 actual physical contact.

1:30:02.460 --> 1:30:04.000
 Today, what I've really tried to illustrate

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.860
 is that there are a common set of biological,

1:30:06.860 --> 1:30:10.140
 neurochemical, and hormonal underpinnings

1:30:10.140 --> 1:30:11.900
 to what we call social bonding.

1:30:11.900 --> 1:30:15.320
 And so while it is complex and it is subjective,

1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:16.660
 it involves the hierarchies,

1:30:16.660 --> 1:30:19.220
 it involves our previous upbringing,

1:30:19.220 --> 1:30:22.020
 it involves our goals, et cetera,

1:30:22.020 --> 1:30:24.260
 it is not infinitely complex.

1:30:24.260 --> 1:30:26.820
 And in that sense, it is tractable.

1:30:26.820 --> 1:30:29.780
 Hopefully I've offered you some levers or some entry points

1:30:29.780 --> 1:30:31.420
 under which you can both understand

1:30:31.420 --> 1:30:33.100
 and move towards social bonds

1:30:33.100 --> 1:30:36.720
 that would be more satisfying and more gratifying for you.

1:30:36.720 --> 1:30:37.980
 That's certainly one of the goals.

1:30:37.980 --> 1:30:40.520
 The other one is that hopefully if you're a clinician

1:30:40.520 --> 1:30:42.440
 or simply the friend that people go to

1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:43.780
 or the family member that people go to

1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:45.060
 when they are challenged

1:30:45.060 --> 1:30:47.580
 through various challenges and social bonds,

1:30:47.580 --> 1:30:49.860
 that you can start to perhaps pass along

1:30:49.860 --> 1:30:54.240
 some of the information as a way of people understanding

1:30:54.240 --> 1:30:56.440
 what they're going through as they are breaking up,

1:30:56.440 --> 1:30:58.200
 but also as they are falling in love,

1:30:58.200 --> 1:30:59.860
 as they are forming attachments

1:30:59.860 --> 1:31:01.780
 and as they are being challenged with attachments.

1:31:01.780 --> 1:31:02.920
 That's my hope.

1:31:02.920 --> 1:31:05.180
 And especially as you head into the holidays

1:31:05.180 --> 1:31:09.880
 and end of year, but also as it continues into 2022,

1:31:09.880 --> 1:31:11.420
 I would hope that you would take this knowledge

1:31:11.420 --> 1:31:12.820
 and apply it in any of the ways

1:31:12.820 --> 1:31:15.840
 that you feel are meaningful and adaptive for you.

1:31:15.840 --> 1:31:18.300

 Please also check out our sponsors

1:31:46.780 --> 1:31:48.500
 mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.

1:31:48.500 --> 1:31:51.060
 That's perhaps the best way to support this podcast.

1:31:51.060 --> 1:31:52.200
 And we have a Patreon.

1:31:52.200 --> 1:31:54.740
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:31:54.740 --> 1:31:56.480
 And there you can support the podcast

1:31:56.480 --> 1:31:58.100
 at any level that you like.

1:31:58.100 --> 1:32:00.020
 We didn't talk about supplements on today's episode

1:32:00.020 --> 1:32:03.600
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, but on many episodes we do.

1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:05.620
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:32:05.620 --> 1:32:07.940
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

1:32:07.940 --> 1:32:10.860
 for things like enhancing the depth and quality of sleep,

1:32:10.860 --> 1:32:14.620
 for things like focus, immune system, et cetera.

1:32:14.620 --> 1:32:16.640
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take,

1:32:16.640 --> 1:32:20.820
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:32:20.820 --> 1:32:22.580
 The reason we partnered with Thorne

1:32:22.580 --> 1:32:24.820
 is because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency

1:32:24.820 --> 1:32:27.620
 in terms of the quality of the ingredients

1:32:27.620 --> 1:32:28.820
 that they include in their supplements

1:32:28.820 --> 1:32:30.500
 and the precision of the amounts

1:32:30.500 --> 1:32:32.020
 of the supplements that they include.

1:32:32.020 --> 1:32:33.100
 This is not true for a lot

1:32:33.100 --> 1:32:35.580
 of other supplement brands out there.

1:32:35.580 --> 1:32:37.420
 Thorne is partnered with the Mayo Clinic,

1:32:37.420 --> 1:32:38.580
 with all the major sports teams,

1:32:38.580 --> 1:32:41.180
 so there's tremendous confidence in their stringency.

1:32:41.180 --> 1:32:44.080
 Again, if you go to thorne.com slash the letter U

1:32:44.080 --> 1:32:46.300
 slash Huberman, you can see all the supplements that I take.

1:32:46.300 --> 1:32:48.420
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements,

1:32:48.420 --> 1:32:50.540
 and if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

1:32:50.540 --> 1:32:51.420
 through that portal,

1:32:51.420 --> 1:32:54.040
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:32:54.040 --> 1:32:55.180
 that Thorne makes.

1:32:55.180 --> 1:32:57.020
 If you're not already following the Huberman Lab

1:32:57.020 --> 1:32:59.620
 on Instagram and Twitter, please do so.

1:32:59.620 --> 1:33:02.540
 On Instagram, I regularly teach short snippets

1:33:02.540 --> 1:33:04.640
 about neuroscience and neuroscience-related tools.

1:33:04.640 --> 1:33:06.280
 Some of that information overlaps

1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:07.780
 with what's covered on the podcast.

1:33:07.780 --> 1:33:09.540
 Often, it does not.

1:33:09.540 --> 1:33:13.320
 So check us out at Huberman Lab on Instagram and on Twitter.

1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:15.380
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:33:15.380 --> 1:33:17.340
 thank you for your interest in science.
