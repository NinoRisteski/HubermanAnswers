00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.220
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.220 --> 00:12.700
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.700 --> 00:14.460
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.460 --> 00:17.540
 Today, we are talking all about the science of gratitude.

00:17.540 --> 00:18.380
 In part, we're doing this

00:18.380 --> 00:20.540
 because of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday,

00:20.540 --> 00:23.700
 which of course is all about giving thanks, gratitude,

00:23.700 --> 00:25.980
 but also because there's now a wealth of data

00:25.980 --> 00:29.700
 showing that having an effective gratitude practice

00:29.700 --> 00:32.840
 can impact a huge number of health variables,

00:32.840 --> 00:36.060
 both mental health and physical health in positive ways,

00:36.060 --> 00:37.480
 things like cardiovascular health,

00:37.480 --> 00:40.500
 things like relationships, things like mental health,

00:40.500 --> 00:42.720
 things like physical and cognitive performance,

00:42.720 --> 00:44.100
 and these are not small effects.

00:44.100 --> 00:46.860
 These are very large positive effects.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.700
 However, in researching this episode,

00:48.700 --> 00:51.540
 I was completely surprised as to what constitutes

00:51.540 --> 00:54.680
 an effective gratitude practice.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.300
 I, I think like many of you,

00:56.300 --> 00:58.160
 would have thought that an effective gratitude practice

00:58.160 --> 01:00.540
 simply involves writing down a few things

01:00.540 --> 01:02.200
 or many things that we're grateful for.

01:02.200 --> 01:03.700
 We're thinking about those,

01:03.700 --> 01:07.520
 or really making an effort to somaticize

01:07.520 --> 01:10.860
 or feel some of the elements of gratitude

01:10.860 --> 01:13.700
 while writing out that list or thinking about that list.

01:13.700 --> 01:16.500
 It turns out that an effective gratitude practice

01:16.500 --> 01:18.300
 doesn't resemble that at all.

01:18.300 --> 01:20.620
 The neuroimaging data, the physiological data,

01:20.620 --> 01:22.780
 looking at things like inflammatory markers,

01:23.780 --> 01:26.220
 other studies purely looking at the psychology

01:26.220 --> 01:28.660
 and the long and short-term effects of an effective

01:28.660 --> 01:32.020
 gratitude practice point to a completely different approach

01:32.020 --> 01:35.820
 to using gratitude to positively impact health metrics.

01:35.820 --> 01:37.300
 Fortunately, these are things that we can all do

01:37.300 --> 01:38.660
 very easily.

01:38.660 --> 01:41.020
 Some of them are actually fun.

01:41.020 --> 01:42.940
 You can do them in a variety of contexts.

01:42.940 --> 01:44.640
 So today we're going to talk about the science

01:44.640 --> 01:46.720
 of effective gratitude practices,

01:46.720 --> 01:48.260
 and we're going to describe what those are

01:48.260 --> 01:50.700
 and how you can incorporate them into your life.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.280
 Before we dive into today's topic,

01:52.280 --> 01:54.700
 I just want to highlight a particularly interesting set

01:54.700 --> 01:56.580
 of findings from the literature.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.960
 This is a study that came out in the journal Cell Report,

01:58.960 --> 02:00.780
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

02:00.780 --> 02:02.940
 It's very relevant to today's topic.

02:02.940 --> 02:04.720
 In fact, we're going to spend more time with this paper

02:04.720 --> 02:06.700
 a little bit later in the episode.

02:06.700 --> 02:10.780
 The study involved having subjects listen to a story.

02:11.980 --> 02:14.780
 The subjects are all listening to the same story,

02:14.780 --> 02:16.820
 but those subjects are not listening to it together.

02:16.820 --> 02:19.220
 They're not rounded up in a circle or all in a room.

02:19.220 --> 02:22.580
 They're in separate rooms or entirely separate locations

02:22.580 --> 02:25.380
 on the planet, or they are actually brought

02:25.380 --> 02:27.960
 into the laboratory on separate days.

02:27.960 --> 02:31.860
 What this study found is that different subjects

02:31.860 --> 02:33.980
 listening to the same story

02:33.980 --> 02:38.500
 undergo the same variation in heart rate.

02:38.500 --> 02:41.140
 In other words, the gaps between their heartbeats

02:41.140 --> 02:43.060
 start to resemble one another

02:43.060 --> 02:44.980
 in response to the same story.

02:44.980 --> 02:46.320
 Now, this is very interesting.

02:46.320 --> 02:50.660
 This is a coordination of the physiology of the body

02:50.660 --> 02:54.580
 in response to a narrative, a story, in different people.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.020
 And yet when they line up the heart rates

02:57.020 --> 02:59.140
 of these different people who listen to the story

02:59.140 --> 03:00.580
 at completely different times,

03:00.580 --> 03:03.460
 they find that those heart rates map onto one another

03:03.460 --> 03:04.600
 almost identically.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.620
 It's really remarkable.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.300
 We're going to talk about what this means

03:08.300 --> 03:11.140
 in terms of coordination of neural circuits in the brain

03:11.140 --> 03:13.720
 and neural circuits in the body and the organs

03:13.720 --> 03:15.220
 such as the heart, but also the lungs

03:15.220 --> 03:16.420
 and other organs of the body,

03:16.420 --> 03:20.040
 and what this means for changing one's overall state.

03:20.040 --> 03:23.140
 A key thing that's going to come up today again and again

03:23.140 --> 03:25.840
 is the distinction between traits,

03:25.840 --> 03:29.620
 which are pervasive aspects of who we are

03:29.620 --> 03:32.660
 and how we tend to react to different types of circumstances

03:32.660 --> 03:34.780
 and states, which are more transient.

03:34.780 --> 03:37.600
 They tend to, you know, you can invoke a state in somebody,

03:37.600 --> 03:40.060
 a state of fear or a state of relaxation.

03:40.060 --> 03:42.580
 But what this study really starts to point to

03:42.580 --> 03:44.320
 is that there are specific approaches

03:44.320 --> 03:45.700
 that any of us can take

03:45.700 --> 03:48.660
 in order to really rewire our nervous system

03:48.660 --> 03:51.460
 such that we are calmer if we want to be calmer

03:51.460 --> 03:52.900
 in certain circumstances,

03:52.900 --> 03:55.580
 that we are more responsive in certain circumstances

03:55.580 --> 03:56.620
 if that's our goal.

03:56.620 --> 03:58.860
 So we'll return to how one would go about doing that.

03:58.860 --> 04:01.540
 I think these results are just beautiful

04:01.540 --> 04:03.300
 in the sense that they really show

04:03.300 --> 04:05.380
 that our brain and our body are highly coordinated

04:05.380 --> 04:06.780
 because people are listening to the story

04:06.780 --> 04:10.300
 and the heart rate is changing in response to the story,

04:10.300 --> 04:13.780
 but that there is a, what we call a stereotopy,

04:13.780 --> 04:17.560
 a sort of stereotyped response to a given story.

04:17.560 --> 04:18.760
 In my mind, there was no reason

04:18.760 --> 04:20.360
 why the results had to be this way.

04:20.360 --> 04:21.940
 You know, two people listen to the same story.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.860
 Why should their heart rates be almost identical

04:23.860 --> 04:24.980
 to the same story?

04:24.980 --> 04:26.420
 Very, very interesting and points

04:26.420 --> 04:28.980
 to the power of narrative and story

04:28.980 --> 04:30.900
 in coordinating our physiology.

04:30.900 --> 04:32.980
 And this is something powerful that we can leverage.

04:32.980 --> 04:35.340
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

04:35.340 --> 04:37.940
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:37.940 --> 04:39.900
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:39.900 --> 04:42.560
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:42.560 --> 04:45.380
 and science-related tools to the general public.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.340
 In keeping with that theme,

04:46.340 --> 04:49.160
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.020
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

04:51.020 --> 04:53.060
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

04:53.060 --> 04:55.380
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

04:55.380 --> 04:57.400
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,

04:57.400 --> 04:58.740
 and I can tell you that the visual system

04:58.740 --> 05:00.420
 has a number of important features

05:00.420 --> 05:02.540
 that allow you to see things with crystal clarity

05:02.540 --> 05:04.420
 no matter what environment you're in.

05:04.420 --> 05:06.100
 So that means if you're in bright sunlight

05:06.100 --> 05:07.500
 or you go into shadows,

05:07.500 --> 05:09.280
 you should be able to see everything clearly.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.340
 But many eyeglasses and sunglasses actually short circuit

05:12.340 --> 05:13.900
 that feature of our visual system

05:13.900 --> 05:15.860
 and make it such that we have to take off our glasses

05:15.860 --> 05:17.100
 or if our screen dims,

05:17.100 --> 05:19.060
 we feel like we can't see things quite right.

05:19.060 --> 05:20.940
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:20.940 --> 05:22.900
 have completely solved that problem.

05:22.900 --> 05:24.380
 In addition, they're very lightweight,

05:24.380 --> 05:26.440
 so you don't even remember that they're on your face.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.620
 And if you get sweaty, they don't slip off.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.340
 They were actually designed for cycling and running

05:31.340 --> 05:33.460
 and things of that sort, but they have a terrific aesthetic.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.740
 So I wear readers at night or out to dinner

05:35.740 --> 05:37.880
 or when I'm driving, I wear their sunglasses.

05:37.880 --> 05:39.180
 And the aesthetics are really terrific

05:39.180 --> 05:40.900
 even though they're so-called performance glasses

05:40.900 --> 05:42.300
 because as many of you know,

05:42.300 --> 05:44.700
 performance glasses often make people look like cyborgs.

05:44.700 --> 05:46.260
 These sunglasses and eyeglasses

05:46.260 --> 05:48.240
 have the kind of aesthetic that you can wear them anywhere,

05:48.240 --> 05:49.180
 while cycling, running,

05:49.180 --> 05:51.540
 but also doing anything else you might be doing.

05:51.540 --> 05:52.960
 If you'd like to try Roca glasses,

05:52.960 --> 05:56.140
 you can go to roca.com, that's R-O-K-A.com

05:59.500 --> 06:01.860
 Again, that's Roca, R-O-K-A.com

06:01.860 --> 06:04.100
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

06:04.100 --> 06:07.340
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

06:07.340 --> 06:09.860
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:09.860 --> 06:12.340
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:12.340 --> 06:13.860
 to help you better meet your immediate

06:13.860 --> 06:15.820
 and long-term health goals.

06:15.820 --> 06:18.760
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done

06:18.760 --> 06:21.460
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

06:21.460 --> 06:23.740
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

06:23.740 --> 06:26.380
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

06:26.380 --> 06:28.840
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

06:28.840 --> 06:30.980
 you can also get insights into your genes

06:30.980 --> 06:33.620
 and how those affect or should affect your immediate

06:33.620 --> 06:35.760
 and long-term health choices.

06:35.760 --> 06:37.260
 A big problem with a lot of blood tests

06:37.260 --> 06:39.140
 and DNA tests out there, however,

06:39.140 --> 06:40.500
 is that you get the data back

06:40.500 --> 06:42.300
 and you don't know what to do with the data.

06:42.300 --> 06:43.900
 Inside Tracker has solved that problem

06:43.900 --> 06:46.280
 with a very easy to use dashboard

06:46.280 --> 06:48.200
 where you get your numbers back from your blood tests,

06:48.200 --> 06:50.760
 your DNA tests, and then it points to specific

06:50.760 --> 06:54.020
 lifestyle factors, nutritional factors, and so forth

06:54.020 --> 06:55.420
 that can allow you to bring the numbers

06:55.420 --> 06:57.740
 into the ranges that are optimal for you.

06:57.740 --> 07:00.200
 This is a huge advantage over other blood tests

07:00.200 --> 07:01.840
 and DNA tests out there.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.660
 Another feature that Inside Tracker has

07:03.660 --> 07:05.700
 is their inner age test.

07:05.700 --> 07:08.700
 The inner age test shows you what your biological age is

07:08.700 --> 07:11.340
 and you can compare that to your chronological age.

07:11.340 --> 07:14.580
 And of course your biological age is equally,

07:14.580 --> 07:16.900
 if not more important than your chronological age.

07:16.900 --> 07:18.180
 So this is an important number

07:18.180 --> 07:20.140
 that you can get from Inside Tracker.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.660
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

07:21.660 --> 07:24.900
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

07:24.900 --> 07:27.900
 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.060
 And if you're listening to this

07:29.060 --> 07:31.200
 during the week of Thanksgiving, 2021,

07:31.200 --> 07:32.940
 and you live in the United States,

07:32.940 --> 07:35.540
 you can get a special offer for this week only.

07:35.540 --> 07:38.660
 You can get $200 off their ultimate package,

07:38.660 --> 07:40.780
 25% off any other package,

07:40.780 --> 07:43.300
 and you'll get the inner age test for free.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.620
 Again, just go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman.

07:46.620 --> 07:49.500
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Magic Spoon.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.060
 Magic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,

07:52.060 --> 07:53.860
 keto-friendly cereal.

07:53.860 --> 07:56.840
 I'm not following a ketogenic nutrition plan.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.480
 What works best for me is to fast

07:58.480 --> 08:01.340
 until about 11 AM or noon most days,

08:01.340 --> 08:03.480
 and then to eat a low carbohydrate lunch,

08:03.480 --> 08:06.060
 a low carbohydrate snack in the afternoon,

08:06.060 --> 08:08.740
 and in the evening is when I eat my starches.

08:08.740 --> 08:10.580
 That's what allows me to be alert throughout the day

08:10.580 --> 08:12.460
 for work, for exercise, and so forth,

08:12.460 --> 08:14.140
 and then to sleep really well at night.

08:14.140 --> 08:15.640
 That's just what works for me,

08:15.640 --> 08:18.520
 but it does require that throughout the day,

08:18.520 --> 08:21.060
 I'm eating fewer carbohydrates than I am at night.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.560
 And oftentimes I want a snack,

08:22.560 --> 08:25.560
 and the snack I want is usually Magic Spoon.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.540
 Magic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,

08:27.540 --> 08:29.180
 13 to 14 grams of protein,

08:29.180 --> 08:32.420
 and only four net grams of carbohydrates in each serving.

08:32.420 --> 08:33.760
 It's absolutely delicious.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.620
 I particularly like the frosted flavor

08:36.620 --> 08:37.660
 because it tastes like donuts,

08:37.660 --> 08:39.620
 and then I try not to eat donuts.

08:39.620 --> 08:40.940
 No vendetta against donuts,

08:40.940 --> 08:43.480
 but it's not really compatible with my eating plan.

08:43.480 --> 08:46.220
 They also have flavors like cocoa, fruity, peanut butter.

08:46.220 --> 08:47.540
 They're really delicious.

08:47.540 --> 08:50.180
 Any ideas you have about keto-friendly cereals

08:50.180 --> 08:51.540
 and foods not being delicious,

08:51.540 --> 08:52.700
 you have to try Magic Spoon.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.660
 It'll change your mind.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.940
 In fact, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it right now.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.140
 If you want to try Magic Spoon,

08:57.140 --> 08:59.940
 you can go to magicspoon.com slash Huberman

09:11.180 --> 09:12.540
 Let's talk about gratitude.

09:12.540 --> 09:15.020
 And to begin, I'd like to emphasize the various aspects

09:15.020 --> 09:16.760
 of mental and physical health that have been shown

09:16.760 --> 09:19.860
 to benefit from a regular gratitude practice.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.180
 There are studies showing that performing

09:22.180 --> 09:25.420
 a gratitude practice twice or three times

09:25.420 --> 09:28.520
 or even just once a week can lead to a pervasive,

09:28.520 --> 09:33.080
 a long-lasting impact on subjective wellbeing.

09:33.080 --> 09:35.300
 People report feeling happier, more meaning,

09:35.300 --> 09:38.580
 joy, even awe for their life experience,

09:38.580 --> 09:41.420
 simply in response to adding a gratitude practice.

09:41.420 --> 09:43.700
 The key thing is it has to be the right gratitude practice.

09:43.700 --> 09:44.620
 And we're going to talk about

09:44.620 --> 09:46.840
 what the right gratitude practice looks like

09:46.840 --> 09:48.300
 in just a little bit.

09:48.300 --> 09:52.200
 But there are additional benefits of a gratitude practice.

09:52.200 --> 09:56.140
 There are studies showing that a regular gratitude practice

09:56.140 --> 09:59.740
 can provide resilience to trauma in two ways.

09:59.740 --> 10:02.340
 It can provide a reframing and resilience

10:02.340 --> 10:04.260
 to prior traumatic experiences.

10:04.260 --> 10:06.780
 So buffering people against the negative

10:06.780 --> 10:08.940
 physiological effects and psychological effects

10:08.940 --> 10:12.980
 of earlier trauma, but also inoculating them in many ways

10:12.980 --> 10:15.980
 to any traumas that might arrive later in life.

10:15.980 --> 10:17.660
 So that's a powerful thing.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.300
 And today we will talk about

10:19.300 --> 10:20.540
 how that's actually accomplished.

10:20.540 --> 10:23.260
 It's actually accomplished by shifting the way

10:23.260 --> 10:25.260
 that the fear and defense networks

10:25.260 --> 10:27.380
 in the brain actually function.

10:27.380 --> 10:29.680
 We'll get right down into the details of that.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.620
 The other thing that a gratitude practice does

10:31.620 --> 10:34.700
 is it's been shown to benefit social relationships,

10:34.700 --> 10:36.660
 but not just for the relationship

10:36.660 --> 10:38.440
 in which you express gratitude, right?

10:38.440 --> 10:40.060
 So on the face of it, you might think,

10:40.060 --> 10:42.560
 okay, if I express gratitude for somebody over and over,

10:42.560 --> 10:43.860
 over and over, over and over,

10:43.860 --> 10:45.540
 then I'm going to feel better about that person.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.360
 And indeed that is one effect of a gratitude practice

10:48.360 --> 10:51.860
 that's called a prosocial or inter-social gratitude practice.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.800
 But there are now several studies,

10:54.800 --> 10:56.500
 recent studies in good journals,

10:56.500 --> 10:59.580
 pointing to the fact that a regular gratitude practice

10:59.580 --> 11:01.900
 can also enhance one's social relationships

11:01.900 --> 11:05.060
 across the board, in the workplace, at school,

11:05.060 --> 11:07.060
 with family, in romantic relationships,

11:07.060 --> 11:08.900
 and even one's relationship to themselves,

11:08.900 --> 11:10.380
 which is really what the subjective feelings

11:10.380 --> 11:11.500
 of wellbeing are.

11:11.500 --> 11:15.240
 So it's clear to me that an effective gratitude practice

11:15.240 --> 11:19.260
 has an outsized effect on many, many aspects

11:19.260 --> 11:20.720
 of mental and physical health.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.860
 And for those of you that are coming to this conversation

11:22.860 --> 11:24.820
 thinking gratitude practice,

11:24.820 --> 11:26.680
 oh, that's kind of wishy-washy or woo,

11:26.680 --> 11:28.740
 it's going to involve putting your hand on your heart

11:28.740 --> 11:30.620
 and feeling into all the amazing things

11:30.620 --> 11:31.500
 that you happen to have,

11:31.500 --> 11:32.900
 even when things are really terrible,

11:32.900 --> 11:34.740
 that's not where we're going at all.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.900
 And equally important is to understand

11:37.900 --> 11:42.820
 that the neurochemical, the anti-inflammatory,

11:42.820 --> 11:46.340
 and the neural circuit mechanisms

11:46.340 --> 11:50.480
 that gratitude can invoke are equally on par

11:50.480 --> 11:53.160
 with some of the effects of pharmacology,

11:53.160 --> 11:56.020
 of things like high-intensity interval training and exercise

11:56.020 --> 11:57.300
 and other things that we think of

11:57.300 --> 12:00.660
 as kind of more potent forms of self-intervention.

12:00.660 --> 12:04.140
 So if you are of the mindset that a gratitude practice

12:04.140 --> 12:06.220
 is kind of weak sauce,

12:06.220 --> 12:08.700
 buckle up because the data actually point to the fact

12:08.700 --> 12:12.180
 that a gratitude practice is a very, very potent way

12:12.180 --> 12:14.700
 in which you can steer your mental and physical health

12:14.700 --> 12:16.380
 in positive directions,

12:16.380 --> 12:18.900
 and that those effects are very long lasting.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.020
 Before we dive into the tools and mechanisms

12:21.020 --> 12:23.140
 and scientific studies around gratitude,

12:23.140 --> 12:25.540
 I'd like to just set the framework for the discussion.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.140
 Gratitude is what we call a prosocial behavior

12:28.140 --> 12:30.620
 or a prosocial mindset.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.780
 Now, you can be grateful for something

12:32.780 --> 12:34.880
 without it involving anybody else.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.420
 So the social part isn't meant to convey anything

12:37.420 --> 12:39.580
 about interpersonal relations, although it can.

12:39.580 --> 12:40.800
 And today we're going to talk a lot

12:40.800 --> 12:43.700
 about how interpersonal relations can be incorporated

12:43.700 --> 12:46.620
 into a gratitude practice in really powerful ways.

12:46.620 --> 12:49.540
 But prosocial behaviors are basically any behavior

12:49.540 --> 12:53.860
 or mode of thinking that allow us to be more effective

12:53.860 --> 12:57.460
 in interactions with other people, including ourselves.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.540
 Now, prosocial is not just a name

12:59.540 --> 13:01.780
 that we give these different tools

13:01.780 --> 13:03.740
 and practices and mindsets.

13:03.740 --> 13:06.100
 They're actually neural circuits in the brain

13:06.100 --> 13:07.900
 that are specifically wired

13:07.900 --> 13:10.180
 for prosocial thoughts and behaviors.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.740
 And these are distinctly different

13:11.740 --> 13:13.020
 from the circuits in the brain

13:13.020 --> 13:15.440
 that are involved in defensive behaviors.

13:15.440 --> 13:17.900
 So without getting into too much detail just yet,

13:17.900 --> 13:19.420
 we will later,

13:19.420 --> 13:20.700
 we have circuits in the brain

13:20.700 --> 13:22.660
 that are what we call a repetitive.

13:22.660 --> 13:24.980
 They are designed to bring us closer to things

13:24.980 --> 13:28.020
 and to bring us into closer relation

13:28.020 --> 13:31.020
 to the details of that sensory experience.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.180
 Now, that could be a delicious food that you're eating.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.800
 It could be interacting with a loved one.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.280
 It could be interacting with a friend

13:36.280 --> 13:37.940
 or anyone that you happen to like.

13:37.940 --> 13:39.940
 It could even be in your relation to yourself.

13:39.940 --> 13:42.500
 These circuits that we're calling prosocial circuits

13:42.500 --> 13:44.540
 light up in the brain in neuroimaging,

13:44.540 --> 13:46.700
 meaning the neurons are firing more actively,

13:46.700 --> 13:49.700
 more electrically, robustly,

13:49.700 --> 13:52.640
 sort of like turning up the volume on these neural circuits

13:52.640 --> 13:53.660
 in the brain.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.360
 And the neural circuits in the brain

13:55.360 --> 13:59.400
 that are associated with aversive or defensive behaviors,

13:59.400 --> 14:00.500
 things like backing up,

14:00.500 --> 14:02.700
 things like covering up the vital organs of the body,

14:02.700 --> 14:04.720
 things like a quaking of the voice,

14:04.720 --> 14:05.900
 all of the things that are associated

14:05.900 --> 14:09.180
 with defensive behaviors are actually antagonized,

14:09.180 --> 14:10.740
 meaning they are reduced

14:10.740 --> 14:13.780
 when the prosocial circuits are more active.

14:13.780 --> 14:15.700
 So the framework here that I'd like to set

14:15.700 --> 14:17.380
 is that we have this kind of seesaw

14:17.380 --> 14:18.920
 of neural circuits in the brain,

14:18.920 --> 14:21.100
 one set that are prosocial

14:21.100 --> 14:23.600
 and are designed to bring us closer to others,

14:23.600 --> 14:24.900
 including ourselves,

14:24.900 --> 14:27.420
 closer to certain sensory experiences, right?

14:27.420 --> 14:29.140
 Because a lot of prosocial behaviors

14:29.140 --> 14:32.420
 can also be geared towards things like pets or food

14:32.420 --> 14:35.060
 or anything that we find we want to be closer to

14:35.060 --> 14:36.140
 and want more of.

14:36.140 --> 14:39.840
 Whereas the defensive circuits involve areas of the brain,

14:39.840 --> 14:42.460
 yes, such as areas that are involved in fear,

14:42.460 --> 14:44.880
 but also areas of the brain and body

14:44.880 --> 14:46.840
 that are literally associated with freezing

14:46.840 --> 14:48.160
 or with backing up.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.860
 So the way to think about gratitude

14:49.860 --> 14:52.500
 is that falls under this category of prosocial behaviors,

14:52.500 --> 14:54.120
 which are designed to bring us closer

14:54.120 --> 14:56.720
 to different types of things

14:56.720 --> 14:59.880
 and to enhance the level of detail

14:59.880 --> 15:02.300
 that we extract from those experiences.

15:02.300 --> 15:04.700
 Now, the existence of these two neural circuits

15:04.700 --> 15:08.500
 that I've placed on this sort of a metaphorical seesaw,

15:08.500 --> 15:09.340
 if you will,

15:10.720 --> 15:13.340
 runs counter to a lot of the messaging

15:13.340 --> 15:17.160
 or the ideas that were put forth in the last century

15:17.160 --> 15:20.940
 about the psychology of happiness and gratitude

15:20.940 --> 15:25.940
 versus the psychology of depression and struggle

15:25.980 --> 15:28.240
 and concern about the future.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.380
 In fact, I'd like to read a quote from the great,

15:30.380 --> 15:33.340
 and we really should call him the great Sigmund Freud,

15:33.340 --> 15:37.820
 because despite having certain traits

15:37.820 --> 15:40.140
 that people criticize him of,

15:40.140 --> 15:43.820
 Freud was indeed a genius about many aspects of psychology.

15:43.820 --> 15:45.840
 But I just want to read you

15:45.840 --> 15:48.360
 Freud's stance on happiness,

15:48.360 --> 15:51.100
 and this invokes elements of gratitude as well,

15:51.100 --> 15:53.000
 and then you can gauge for yourself.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.780
 Quote, our possibilities of happiness

15:56.780 --> 15:59.620
 are already restricted by our constitution.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.300
 So he's saying that we're basically wired

16:01.300 --> 16:03.900
 to not have happiness easily.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.360
 Unhappiness is much less difficult to experience.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.900
 We are threatened with suffering from three directions,

16:08.900 --> 16:10.440
 one from our own body,

16:10.440 --> 16:12.740
 which is doomed to decay and dissolution

16:12.740 --> 16:15.860
 and which cannot even do without pain and anxiety

16:15.860 --> 16:17.100
 as warning signals.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.940
 Two, from the external world,

16:18.940 --> 16:21.040
 which may rage against us with overwhelming

16:21.040 --> 16:23.060
 and merciless forces of destruction.

16:23.060 --> 16:26.700
 And three, and finally, from our relations with others,

16:26.700 --> 16:28.880
 the suffering of which from this last source

16:28.880 --> 16:32.300
 is perhaps more painful to us than any other.

16:32.300 --> 16:33.580
 That's Sigmund Freud.

16:33.580 --> 16:36.540
 And not all of his writings were that pessimistic,

16:36.540 --> 16:37.360
 if you will.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.820
 What Freud is referring to there

16:40.820 --> 16:42.380
 are those defensive circuits.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.940
 And of course, he talked about psychological defensives.

16:44.940 --> 16:46.140
 And in full disclosure,

16:46.140 --> 16:51.020
 I am a huge fan of much of the psychological literature

16:51.020 --> 16:53.820
 and psychoanalysis of Sigmund Freud

16:53.820 --> 16:56.340
 and his descendants, Jung and others.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.620
 I think there are strong elements of truth there,

16:58.620 --> 17:00.620
 but it gives you a sense of the kind of mindset

17:00.620 --> 17:03.800
 of psychology early in the last century.

17:03.800 --> 17:04.640
 And then of course,

17:04.640 --> 17:06.900
 was the emergence of the positive psychology movement,

17:06.900 --> 17:10.600
 which was really about invoking the understanding

17:10.600 --> 17:14.320
 and eventually the elucidation of the neural circuits

17:14.320 --> 17:17.420
 for things like happiness and awe and affiliation

17:17.420 --> 17:20.020
 and things that we are calling prosocial circuits.

17:20.020 --> 17:23.300
 So the field of psychology has a dark and light,

17:23.300 --> 17:24.200
 if you will,

17:24.200 --> 17:27.380
 and the field of neuroscience has a dark and light.

17:27.380 --> 17:30.300
 You have these, what we call parallel pathways in the brain.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.220
 And we have parallel pathways in the mind

17:32.220 --> 17:34.300
 that set us up for feeling good about things

17:34.300 --> 17:36.620
 or for feeling less good about things.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.860
 I think what's really salient from the quote from Freud

17:38.860 --> 17:41.580
 is that what he's saying is our default

17:41.580 --> 17:43.700
 is to be concerned about the future,

17:43.700 --> 17:46.540
 to be wrapped in our defenses.

17:46.540 --> 17:48.580
 And to some extent that's true.

17:48.580 --> 17:50.660
 And the reason we can say that's true

17:50.660 --> 17:55.300
 is because most of us need a gratitude practice.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.560
 We need to do certain things in order to feel good

17:58.560 --> 17:59.500
 and to feel happy.

17:59.500 --> 18:01.260
 We actually have to put work into it.

18:01.260 --> 18:04.060
 It is quite possible that there's an asymmetry

18:04.060 --> 18:05.700
 in the way that these prosocial

18:05.700 --> 18:08.080
 versus defensive circuits are set up,

18:08.080 --> 18:10.660
 such that because defensive circuits

18:10.660 --> 18:12.180
 are designed to keep us safe,

18:12.180 --> 18:13.840
 psychologically and physically safe,

18:13.840 --> 18:16.240
 that they have more robustness

18:16.240 --> 18:19.180
 or they can actually drive our behavior more easily.

18:19.180 --> 18:21.240
 I'll give you an analogy in the system

18:21.240 --> 18:23.300
 that I'm most familiar with as a neuroscientist,

18:23.300 --> 18:24.720
 which is the visual system.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.700
 In the visual system, we have parallel pathways.

18:27.700 --> 18:30.540
 We have neurons in our eye that respond

18:30.540 --> 18:32.660
 when things in our environment get brighter.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.340
 Literally when the lights go up,

18:34.340 --> 18:36.320
 these neurons start firing like crazy.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.300
 And we have neurons in our eye that respond

18:38.300 --> 18:40.580
 when things get darker, when things start dimming

18:40.580 --> 18:42.540
 or go from white to black.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.940
 The circuits for detecting darkening

18:46.940 --> 18:49.400
 are much more robust and much more numerous

18:49.400 --> 18:51.380
 than are the circuits for brightness.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.040
 And that is probably related, probably,

18:54.040 --> 18:56.740
 to the fact that dark objects

18:56.740 --> 19:01.740
 or experiencing looming, meaning incoming objects

19:01.740 --> 19:03.580
 and being able to perceive them

19:03.580 --> 19:05.900
 is something that's vital to our survival.

19:05.900 --> 19:08.820
 Whereas being able to perceive the brightening of things

19:08.820 --> 19:11.140
 might be important to survival in certain contexts,

19:11.140 --> 19:13.620
 car lights coming at you at night or something of that sort,

19:13.620 --> 19:16.780
 but not as often in a kind of a evolutionary

19:16.780 --> 19:19.520
 or ethological context as the darkening of things.

19:19.520 --> 19:23.020
 So I think Freud's quote and the field of psychology

19:23.020 --> 19:26.340
 now point to the fact that indeed

19:26.340 --> 19:28.380
 we have the capacity for happiness

19:28.380 --> 19:31.300
 and we have the capacity for great worry and concern

19:31.300 --> 19:33.480
 and depression and unhappiness.

19:33.480 --> 19:36.920
 And the neural circuit literature also supports that.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.980
 The key thing for today's discussion

19:38.980 --> 19:41.940
 is that gratitude turns out to be

19:41.940 --> 19:43.780
 one of the most potent wedges

19:43.780 --> 19:46.260
 by which we can insert our thinking,

19:46.260 --> 19:49.460
 and as you also see, the physiology of our body,

19:49.460 --> 19:51.020
 between these two circuits

19:51.020 --> 19:54.120
 and give a little more levity, if you will,

19:54.120 --> 19:55.340
 to the side of the seesaw

19:55.340 --> 19:59.420
 that's associated with positive prosocial feelings.

19:59.420 --> 20:03.760
 And if you keep imagining this seesaw imagery,

20:03.760 --> 20:06.280
 what's really beautiful about gratitude practices

20:06.280 --> 20:09.020
 is that if they're performed repeatedly

20:09.020 --> 20:11.640
 and not even that often, but repeatedly,

20:11.640 --> 20:14.820
 then one can actually shift their neural circuits

20:14.820 --> 20:16.300
 such that the seesaw

20:16.300 --> 20:18.900
 that I'm calling prosocial versus defensive behaviors

20:18.900 --> 20:20.220
 can actually start to tilt.

20:20.220 --> 20:21.660
 And the little hinge, if you will,

20:21.660 --> 20:22.900
 on the seesaw in the middle

20:22.900 --> 20:25.300
 can be adjusted in a little tighter

20:25.300 --> 20:29.700
 when the side for gratitude and for wellbeing

20:29.700 --> 20:32.800
 and for feelings of happiness is a little bit higher.

20:32.800 --> 20:34.540
 What this means is that

20:34.540 --> 20:35.900
 whether or not Freud was right or wrong,

20:35.900 --> 20:38.980
 whether or not the neuroscientists in one camp

20:38.980 --> 20:40.300
 or another right or wrong,

20:40.300 --> 20:42.060
 we now know with certainty

20:42.060 --> 20:43.660
 that a regular gratitude practice

20:43.660 --> 20:45.640
 can shift the prosocial circuit

20:45.640 --> 20:49.320
 so that they dominate our physiology and our mindset

20:49.320 --> 20:52.420
 in ways that can enhance many, many aspects

20:52.420 --> 20:54.860
 of our physical and mental health by default.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.340
 So we don't always have to constantly be in practice

20:57.340 --> 20:58.920
 trying to be happy.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.580
 So the succinct way of saying all this is,

21:01.580 --> 21:03.460
 yes, indeed, we might be wired

21:03.460 --> 21:07.260
 or in such that we have a greater propensity

21:07.260 --> 21:09.260
 for unhappiness than happiness,

21:09.260 --> 21:11.540
 but gratitude practices,

21:11.540 --> 21:12.940
 provided they are the effective ones

21:12.940 --> 21:15.400
 and they are performed regularly,

21:15.400 --> 21:17.300
 can shift those circuits

21:17.300 --> 21:19.760
 such that we are happier on average

21:19.760 --> 21:22.240
 even when we are not performing those practices.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.920
 Now I'd like to talk about some of the neurochemistry

21:24.920 --> 21:27.580
 and neural circuits associated with gratitude

21:27.580 --> 21:29.680
 and prosocial behaviors.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.080
 Numerous times on this podcast,

21:31.080 --> 21:33.560
 I've talked about so-called neuromodulators.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.240
 Those of you that might've forgotten

21:35.240 --> 21:37.440
 or have never heard of neuromodulators before,

21:37.440 --> 21:39.360
 neuromodulators are chemicals that are released

21:39.360 --> 21:40.860
 in the brain and body

21:40.860 --> 21:43.640
 that change the activity of other neural circuits.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.820
 They make certain brain areas more likely to be active

21:46.820 --> 21:50.560
 and other brain areas less likely to be active.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.400
 These neuromodulators have names like dopamine,

21:52.400 --> 21:54.920
 serotonin, acetylcholine, epinephrine, and so on.

21:56.160 --> 21:58.960
 The main neuromodulators associated with gratitude

21:58.960 --> 22:02.440
 and prosocial behaviors tends to be serotonin.

22:02.440 --> 22:05.820
 Serotonin is released from a very small collection

22:05.820 --> 22:09.920
 of neurons in the brainstem called the RAFA,

22:09.920 --> 22:12.640
 R-A-P-H-E, the RAFA nucleus,

22:12.640 --> 22:14.240
 and a few other places in the brain.

22:14.240 --> 22:16.720
 And the RAFA neurons send these little wires

22:16.720 --> 22:20.080
 that we call axons out to numerous places in the brain

22:20.080 --> 22:22.160
 and they tend to increase the activity

22:22.160 --> 22:26.200
 of particular neural circuits that lend themselves

22:26.200 --> 22:30.840
 to more approach to particular types of experiences.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.160
 That makes total sense if you think about it,

22:33.160 --> 22:36.120
 have a chemical that under certain circumstances

22:36.120 --> 22:37.480
 is released in the brain

22:37.480 --> 22:40.560
 that triggers the activity of neural circuits

22:40.560 --> 22:42.920
 that makes the organism, you,

22:42.920 --> 22:46.440
 more likely to stay in an interaction with something

22:46.440 --> 22:49.760
 or even lean in and seek a more detailed interaction

22:49.760 --> 22:51.520
 with that person, place, or thing.

22:53.280 --> 22:57.040
 Beautiful work from a cognitive neuropsychologist.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.120
 His name is Antonio Damasio.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.400
 He's a world-class neuroscientist,

23:02.400 --> 23:04.200
 has been in the game a very long time,

23:04.200 --> 23:07.420
 has explored the so-called neural correlates of gratitude.

23:07.420 --> 23:11.040
 And two main brain areas are activated

23:11.040 --> 23:13.400
 by these serotonergic systems.

23:13.400 --> 23:15.960
 And when people experience something

23:15.960 --> 23:18.460
 that makes them feel gratitude,

23:18.460 --> 23:20.840
 even if it's shallow gratitude or deep,

23:20.840 --> 23:22.940
 and if it's all the way to deep gratitude,

23:22.940 --> 23:25.580
 they see activation of these particular brain circuits

23:25.580 --> 23:26.520
 I'll mention in a moment.

23:26.520 --> 23:28.720
 And the amount of activation scales

23:28.720 --> 23:31.600
 with how intensely the person experienced

23:31.600 --> 23:33.480
 the feeling of gratitude.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.440
 And those two areas have particular names.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.520
 You don't need to know the names,

23:36.520 --> 23:37.840
 but for those of you that want to know,

23:37.840 --> 23:39.920
 they are the anterior cingulate cortex

23:39.920 --> 23:41.880
 and the medial prefrontal cortex.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.340
 And of course, these brain areas are connected

23:43.340 --> 23:45.440
 to a number of other networks in the brain.

23:45.440 --> 23:48.560
 In fact, that's how they get you or others

23:48.560 --> 23:51.040
 to lean into certain experiences

23:51.040 --> 23:53.400
 because when these areas are active,

23:53.400 --> 23:56.040
 certain thought processes get invoked.

23:56.040 --> 23:59.000
 Those thought processes probably resemble something like,

23:59.000 --> 24:01.020
 hmm, I'd like to experience more of this,

24:01.020 --> 24:02.480
 or hmm, this feels really good.

24:02.480 --> 24:06.560
 And then they literally feed onto your muscles

24:06.560 --> 24:10.860
 via the neurons, making you happy to stay stationary

24:10.860 --> 24:12.320
 if you're experiencing something you like,

24:12.320 --> 24:14.100
 or to move closer to something

24:14.100 --> 24:17.680
 that you find attractive to you, literally.

24:17.680 --> 24:19.600
 So these are powerful circuits.

24:19.600 --> 24:20.920
 Of these two brain areas,

24:20.920 --> 24:22.720
 the one I'd like to focus on the most

24:22.720 --> 24:25.900
 is the medial prefrontal cortex.

24:25.900 --> 24:27.000
 Many of you have probably heard

24:27.000 --> 24:28.540
 of the medial prefrontal cortex

24:28.540 --> 24:30.760
 because this is the area of the brain

24:30.760 --> 24:35.120
 that is involved in planning and in deep thinking

24:35.120 --> 24:37.760
 and evaluation of different types of experiences,

24:37.760 --> 24:39.800
 past, present, or future.

24:39.800 --> 24:42.400
 It seems actually that pretty much every study

24:42.400 --> 24:44.360
 of a human anything seems to involve

24:44.360 --> 24:45.680
 the medial prefrontal cortex,

24:45.680 --> 24:47.740
 or at least one could get that impression

24:47.740 --> 24:49.440
 just by looking at scientific abstracts

24:49.440 --> 24:51.600
 and papers these days.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.520
 So I think it's worth us taking a step back

24:53.520 --> 24:55.800
 and asking what does the medial prefrontal cortex

24:55.800 --> 24:57.200
 really do, right?

24:57.200 --> 24:59.560
 How could this one piece of neural real estate

24:59.560 --> 25:01.720
 that we all have right behind our forehead,

25:01.720 --> 25:04.360
 how could that be involved in so many different things?

25:04.360 --> 25:05.560
 And the reason it can be involved

25:05.560 --> 25:06.580
 in so many different things,

25:06.580 --> 25:09.220
 and the reason it's especially important for gratitude

25:09.220 --> 25:13.600
 is that medial prefrontal cortex sets context, okay?

25:13.600 --> 25:14.920
 It sets context,

25:14.920 --> 25:19.300
 and it literally defines the meaning of your experience.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.660
 Now, this is not at all an abstract phenomenon.

25:21.660 --> 25:25.880
 I'm going to give a very physiological example of this,

25:25.880 --> 25:27.800
 and then we're going to translate it to gratitude,

25:27.800 --> 25:29.840
 but I really want everyone to understand

25:29.840 --> 25:32.160
 how is it that medial prefrontal cortex

25:32.160 --> 25:35.760
 sets the context of everything in your life?

25:35.760 --> 25:37.480
 Well, it does it the following way.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.420
 You have a number of circuits deeper in your brain

25:40.420 --> 25:43.120
 that simply create some sensations,

25:43.120 --> 25:44.580
 or they allow you, I should say,

25:44.580 --> 25:46.580
 to perceive certain sensations.

25:46.580 --> 25:49.140
 Let's use the example of cold exposure,

25:49.140 --> 25:51.140
 something that we'd sometimes talk about in this podcast

25:51.140 --> 25:52.080
 for other reasons.

25:52.960 --> 25:55.140
 If you were to deliberately place yourself

25:55.140 --> 25:58.640
 into an ice bath, it would be uncomfortable,

25:58.640 --> 26:01.000
 even if you're adapted to cold and so forth.

26:02.840 --> 26:05.740
 The discomfort is non-negotiable.

26:05.740 --> 26:09.000
 However, if you are doing it because you want to,

26:09.000 --> 26:10.600
 or because you have knowledge

26:10.600 --> 26:12.740
 that there are particular health benefits,

26:13.880 --> 26:18.880
 the medial prefrontal cortex can then control areas

26:19.120 --> 26:21.280
 of your deeper brain, like the hypothalamus,

26:21.280 --> 26:24.060
 to positively impact the neurochemicals

26:24.060 --> 26:25.440
 that are released into your system.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.120
 You'll still get a lot of adrenaline

26:27.120 --> 26:28.800
 by getting into the ice bath,

26:28.800 --> 26:31.880
 but the fact that you are doing this deliberately

26:31.880 --> 26:34.400
 and your knowledge that you are making the choice,

26:34.400 --> 26:35.840
 that it's you that's deciding

26:35.840 --> 26:38.460
 to put yourself through this discomfort,

26:38.460 --> 26:41.840
 has been shown to create a very different

26:41.840 --> 26:45.240
 and positive effect on things like dopamine,

26:45.240 --> 26:48.200
 on things like anti-inflammatory markers

26:48.200 --> 26:49.740
 in your immune system, et cetera,

26:49.740 --> 26:53.660
 compared to if someone pushes you into an ice bath,

26:53.660 --> 26:56.400
 or if you are doing it because someone insists

26:56.400 --> 26:58.780
 that you do it and you really, really don't want to.

26:58.780 --> 27:00.800
 So there's a very subtle distinction here.

27:00.800 --> 27:04.940
 It's just the distinction of motivation and desire

27:04.940 --> 27:07.680
 or lack of motivation and being forced into something.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.360
 And there are a number of other effects

27:09.360 --> 27:10.800
 of this that have been described.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.200
 In the episode with Robert Sapolsky

27:13.200 --> 27:15.240
 that I did earlier this last year,

27:15.240 --> 27:17.240
 he talked about a study in animals,

27:17.240 --> 27:18.600
 which has also been shown in humans.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.360
 If you take a mouse, for instance,

27:20.360 --> 27:22.000
 and it runs on a running wheel,

27:22.000 --> 27:23.800
 which mice really like to do,

27:23.800 --> 27:25.120
 there are many positive effects

27:25.120 --> 27:26.400
 on reducing blood pressure,

27:26.400 --> 27:29.480
 improvements in neurochemistry, et cetera, in that mouse.

27:29.480 --> 27:32.880
 However, if there's a mouse in the cage right next to it

27:32.880 --> 27:34.200
 that's trapped in the running wheel

27:34.200 --> 27:37.240
 and it has to run every time the other mouse runs

27:37.240 --> 27:38.640
 because the wheels are linked,

27:38.640 --> 27:40.480
 well, then the second mouse

27:40.480 --> 27:43.240
 that's forced to do the exact same running

27:43.240 --> 27:46.680
 experiences negative shifts in their overall health metrics.

27:46.680 --> 27:49.300
 Blood pressure goes up, stress hormones go up, et cetera,

27:49.300 --> 27:51.520
 because it's not actually making the choice.

27:51.520 --> 27:54.640
 Medial prefrontal cortex is the knob,

27:54.640 --> 27:58.720
 or the switch, rather, that can take one experience

27:58.720 --> 28:01.080
 and allow us to frame it

28:01.080 --> 28:04.000
 such that it creates positive health effects.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.720
 And the exact same experience framed

28:06.720 --> 28:08.140
 as something we don't want to do,

28:08.140 --> 28:09.540
 or that we are forced to do,

28:09.540 --> 28:11.620
 can create negative health effects.

28:11.620 --> 28:13.400
 Now, how exactly the neurons

28:13.400 --> 28:16.360
 in medial prefrontal cortex do that is rather complicated

28:16.360 --> 28:18.600
 and frankly, not completely understood,

28:18.600 --> 28:21.220
 but it's somehow able to adjust the activity

28:21.220 --> 28:23.400
 of other neural circuits that are purely reflexive.

28:23.400 --> 28:24.260
 As we say in neuroscience,

28:24.260 --> 28:25.720
 like really dumb neural circuits

28:25.720 --> 28:29.400
 that are just like switches and place a context onto it.

28:29.400 --> 28:34.160
 So gratitude is a mindset

28:34.160 --> 28:37.760
 that activates prefrontal cortex,

28:37.760 --> 28:41.400
 and in doing so sets the context of your experience

28:41.400 --> 28:44.600
 such that you can derive tremendous health benefits,

28:44.600 --> 28:46.160
 which leads us to the question,

28:46.160 --> 28:48.760
 what kind of gratitude practice

28:48.760 --> 28:50.640
 is going to accomplish this, right?

28:50.640 --> 28:53.080
 Because it is not simply the case that I could take a knife,

28:53.080 --> 28:54.360
 don't, please don't do this experiment,

28:54.360 --> 28:56.800
 and cut my hand and say, oh, you know,

28:56.800 --> 28:58.680
 I'm going to enjoy this.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.880
 I'm doing this because this is good for me

29:00.880 --> 29:01.780
 and it won't hurt.

29:01.780 --> 29:03.480
 Of course it'll hurt just like the ice bath is cold

29:03.480 --> 29:08.480
 no matter what, but I can't lie to myself, right?

29:08.520 --> 29:12.920
 If I have some knowledge that cutting myself is bad for me,

29:12.920 --> 29:14.720
 that's very hard to override.

29:14.720 --> 29:17.240
 And so the medial prefrontal cortex

29:17.240 --> 29:20.320
 has a tremendous capacity to set context,

29:20.320 --> 29:23.240
 and it does that beautifully with respect to gratitude,

29:23.240 --> 29:25.280
 but you can't simply lie to yourself.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.240
 You can't simply say, oh, well,

29:27.240 --> 29:29.420
 every experience is a learning experience,

29:29.420 --> 29:32.720
 or, you know, a terrible thing that happens,

29:32.720 --> 29:34.820
 oh, good, I'm just going to say good,

29:34.820 --> 29:37.540
 and that your body will react as if it's good for you.

29:37.540 --> 29:38.520
 That's a myth.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.320
 And frankly, it's a myth that's fairly pervasive

29:41.320 --> 29:44.960
 in the self-help and self-actualization literature.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.800
 We have the opportunity to reframe

29:46.800 --> 29:49.000
 and set context on our experiences,

29:49.000 --> 29:51.840
 but that requires a very specific set of practices.

29:51.840 --> 29:53.560
 We can't simply lie to ourselves

29:53.560 --> 29:55.760
 or quote unquote fake it until we make it.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.420
 Neural circuitry is very powerful and very plastic.

29:58.420 --> 30:01.640
 It can be modified, and it's very context dependent,

30:01.640 --> 30:02.800
 but it's not stupid.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.560
 And when you lie to yourself about whether or not

30:05.560 --> 30:08.580
 an experience is actually good for you or not,

30:09.560 --> 30:11.340
 your brain knows.

30:11.340 --> 30:14.980
 So what does an effective gratitude practice look like?

30:14.980 --> 30:18.660
 Well, let's examine what an ineffective,

30:18.660 --> 30:21.400
 what a poor gratitude practice looks like,

30:21.400 --> 30:25.080
 because therein lies some really important information,

30:25.080 --> 30:26.640
 including the fact that I,

30:26.640 --> 30:29.240
 and I think millions of other people out there

30:29.240 --> 30:30.260
 are doing it wrong.

30:31.720 --> 30:34.280
 Most gratitude practices that you see online

30:34.280 --> 30:38.040
 and that people talk about in various talks and so forth

30:38.040 --> 30:42.380
 involve something like writing down or reciting

30:42.380 --> 30:46.860
 or thinking about five or 10 or three or 20 things

30:46.860 --> 30:48.920
 that you're especially grateful for,

30:48.920 --> 30:52.120
 and then really trying to feel into some of those,

30:52.120 --> 30:56.100
 really try and think deeply about the emotions,

30:56.100 --> 30:59.280
 the sensations, the perceptions that are associated

30:59.280 --> 31:01.020
 with those particular people, places,

31:01.020 --> 31:02.340
 and things on your list.

31:04.180 --> 31:07.440
 Most studies actually point to the fact

31:07.440 --> 31:10.800
 that that style of gratitude practice

31:10.800 --> 31:13.660
 is not particularly effective in shifting

31:13.660 --> 31:16.240
 your neural circuitry, your neural chemistry,

31:16.240 --> 31:17.960
 or your somatic circuitry,

31:17.960 --> 31:19.480
 the circuits in your body,

31:19.480 --> 31:21.400
 because you literally have organs and neural circuits

31:21.400 --> 31:24.320
 that are connected, the circuits of your brain and body

31:24.320 --> 31:28.280
 toward enhanced activation of prefrontal cortex,

31:28.280 --> 31:31.400
 enhanced activation of these pro-social neural networks

31:31.400 --> 31:33.400
 that we were talking about earlier.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.720
 Now that may come as a surprise to many of you,

31:35.720 --> 31:38.220
 and certainly came as a surprise to me.

31:39.120 --> 31:42.400
 There is some evidence that if there's a shift

31:42.400 --> 31:44.680
 in so-called autonomic arousal

31:44.680 --> 31:46.940
 during these gratitude practices,

31:46.940 --> 31:49.100
 these ones that I'm calling ineffective,

31:49.100 --> 31:51.640
 that they can be made slightly more effective.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.240
 So what do I mean by a shift in autonomic arousal?

31:54.240 --> 31:58.020
 Well, very briefly, we have a aspect to our nervous system,

31:58.020 --> 31:59.360
 both within our brain and body

31:59.360 --> 32:01.480
 that we call the autonomic nervous system.

32:01.480 --> 32:02.560
 It's a little bit of a misnomer

32:02.560 --> 32:04.640
 because autonomic means automatic,

32:04.640 --> 32:06.720
 and in fact, we can take control

32:06.720 --> 32:08.320
 of the autonomic nervous system.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.840
 It has one branch, meaning one set of connections

32:11.840 --> 32:14.580
 and circuits that are associated with making us more alert,

32:14.580 --> 32:18.100
 the so-called sympathetic nervous system,

32:18.100 --> 32:19.480
 or I should say sympathetic arm

32:19.480 --> 32:20.600
 of the autonomic nervous system,

32:20.600 --> 32:21.800
 but that's really a mouthful.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.260
 It's really associated with enhanced alertness of any kind

32:25.260 --> 32:26.880
 for excitement or fear,

32:26.880 --> 32:28.480
 and it has nothing to do with sympathy.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.080
 It's just about enhanced alertness.

32:30.080 --> 32:33.080
 And then the other arm of the autonomic nervous system

32:33.080 --> 32:35.680
 is the so-called parasympathetic arm

32:35.680 --> 32:36.960
 of the autonomic nervous system,

32:36.960 --> 32:38.240
 but that's also a mouthful.

32:38.240 --> 32:41.360
 So let's just say it's the calming aspect

32:41.360 --> 32:42.760
 of the autonomic nervous system.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.140
 So it's associated with decreased heart rate,

32:45.140 --> 32:47.800
 decreased breathing rate, et cetera.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.920
 So we have these two aspects to our autonomic nervous system,

32:51.920 --> 32:54.760
 and it has been shown that if people are brought

32:54.760 --> 32:58.340
 into a state of heightened sympathetic tone,

32:58.340 --> 33:00.500
 meaning more alertness,

33:00.500 --> 33:03.900
 then the intensity of the emotions that they experience

33:03.900 --> 33:06.380
 in their gratitude practice is enhanced,

33:06.380 --> 33:08.800
 and the effectiveness of that gratitude practice

33:08.800 --> 33:10.600
 can be enhanced.

33:10.600 --> 33:14.000
 This is seen nowadays somewhat commonly

33:14.000 --> 33:16.600
 as having people, for instance,

33:16.600 --> 33:18.600
 cyclic hyperventilated breathing,

33:18.600 --> 33:20.600
 as we call it in my laboratory,

33:20.600 --> 33:22.720
 breathing that's very intense of the inhale,

33:22.720 --> 33:25.840
 exhale, inhale, exhale very deeply for 25 or 30 breaths.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.720
 Then people will sit in a meditative stance,

33:27.720 --> 33:31.360
 or they'll focus on their notepad and paper,

33:31.360 --> 33:33.720
 and they'll write out the things that they're grateful for,

33:33.720 --> 33:35.940
 and then they'll really try and feel into those things,

33:35.940 --> 33:37.640
 or they'll think about those things.

33:37.640 --> 33:38.840
 And it makes perfect sense

33:38.840 --> 33:41.960
 as to why enhancing autonomic arousal

33:41.960 --> 33:46.100
 toward more alertness would create more robust feelings

33:46.100 --> 33:49.820
 or more robust impact of these gratitude practices,

33:49.820 --> 33:52.800
 because in that state, you are more alert,

33:52.800 --> 33:55.020
 and therefore you are able to bring more detail,

33:55.020 --> 33:57.860
 more richness to the perception and the understanding

33:57.860 --> 34:00.520
 of what those things on your list happen to be.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.520
 But, and I should say

34:02.520 --> 34:05.280
 that there are numerous other approaches to this,

34:05.280 --> 34:06.680
 sort of self-help type stuff

34:06.680 --> 34:08.500
 and self-actualization seminars,

34:08.500 --> 34:10.600
 people will do things like cold baths,

34:10.600 --> 34:11.880
 or they'll do chanting,

34:11.880 --> 34:14.460
 or they'll have any number of different experiences,

34:14.460 --> 34:15.680
 all of which are mainly geared

34:15.680 --> 34:18.200
 towards increased autonomic arousal.

34:18.200 --> 34:20.440
 There are even practices out there using pharmacology

34:20.440 --> 34:22.240
 to create increased autonomic arousal

34:22.240 --> 34:23.760
 and then drop into gratitude.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.440
 Across the board,

34:26.440 --> 34:30.200
 those increase the potency of the gratitude practice

34:30.200 --> 34:32.640
 of listing things out on paper or in one's mind

34:32.640 --> 34:34.460
 or saying them out loud.

34:34.460 --> 34:37.960
 But somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,

34:37.960 --> 34:40.600
 that form of just expressing thanks,

34:40.600 --> 34:44.880
 expressing gratitude is not the most effective way

34:44.880 --> 34:48.220
 to shift these pro-social circuits in positive ways

34:48.220 --> 34:52.880
 for one's physiology and anatomy and psychology.

34:52.880 --> 34:57.260
 Turns out that the most potent form of gratitude practice

34:57.260 --> 35:01.120
 is not a gratitude practice where you give gratitude

35:01.120 --> 35:02.440
 or express gratitude,

35:02.440 --> 35:05.400
 but rather where you receive gratitude,

35:05.400 --> 35:07.040
 where you receive thanks.

35:07.040 --> 35:09.280
 And this to me was very surprising.

35:09.280 --> 35:11.520
 There are a number of studies about this now.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.480
 One in particular that I think is interesting

35:13.480 --> 35:15.140
 is called the prefrontal activation

35:15.140 --> 35:16.960
 while listening to a letter of gratitude

35:16.960 --> 35:19.320
 read aloud by a coworker face-to-face,

35:19.320 --> 35:21.320
 a NIRS study, N-I-R-S.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.560
 I'll explain what all this means.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.260
 You now know what the prefrontal activation part is.

35:25.260 --> 35:27.500
 This is activation of the prefrontal cortex.

35:27.500 --> 35:32.240
 The NIRS, N-I-R-S study, that's just a technical term.

35:32.240 --> 35:35.420
 It's a form of imaging brain activity.

35:35.420 --> 35:36.480
 It's non-invasive.

35:36.480 --> 35:38.640
 So it's kind of a skull cap.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.880
 It looks like a hoodie with a bunch of wires

35:40.880 --> 35:42.160
 coming out of it basically

35:42.160 --> 35:43.720
 that can measure neural activity

35:43.720 --> 35:46.080
 without having to remove any parts of the skull

35:46.080 --> 35:49.480
 or put a person into one of these tube-like fMRI machines,

35:49.480 --> 35:50.760
 which is very invasive.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.100
 It's also a wonderful tool

35:52.100 --> 35:55.580
 because it allows human subjects in the laboratory

35:55.580 --> 35:58.380
 to move around and to engage with one another.

35:58.380 --> 36:00.240
 So in this particular experiment,

36:00.240 --> 36:04.340
 what they did is they had coworkers write a letter

36:04.340 --> 36:08.600
 of gratitude of thanks to another coworker,

36:08.600 --> 36:10.100
 unbeknownst to the other coworker,

36:10.100 --> 36:12.040
 and then they sat down together

36:12.040 --> 36:13.520
 and then they imaged brain activity

36:13.520 --> 36:14.960
 as this letter was being read

36:14.960 --> 36:17.640
 and as the letter was being heard, received.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.640
 And it showed very robust effects

36:20.640 --> 36:22.680
 on these prefrontal networks

36:22.680 --> 36:25.640
 that pointed to the fact that receiving gratitude

36:25.640 --> 36:27.480
 is actually much more potent

36:27.480 --> 36:29.660
 in terms of the positive shifts that it can create

36:29.660 --> 36:31.440
 than giving gratitude.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.200
 So this raises a couple of important points.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.320
 First of all, if you are somebody

36:35.320 --> 36:38.900
 who is prone to write letters of gratitude,

36:38.900 --> 36:41.600
 ideally, I think it's requisite

36:41.600 --> 36:43.440
 that these be genuine letters of gratitude

36:43.440 --> 36:48.440
 or saying things that are genuine expressions of gratitude,

36:48.620 --> 36:50.960
 this could be by text or in-person or by phone,

36:52.680 --> 36:54.960
 you have within you a very potent form

36:54.960 --> 36:57.280
 of shifting somebody else's neurology.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.920
 Now, that's wonderful,

36:58.920 --> 37:01.660
 and I think there are many people like that out there,

37:01.660 --> 37:04.920
 but for many people who want to experience

37:04.920 --> 37:07.320
 the positive effects of gratitude,

37:07.320 --> 37:11.000
 it's probably not the most advantageous approach

37:11.000 --> 37:12.040
 to just sit around waiting,

37:12.040 --> 37:13.880
 hoping that someone's going to deliver

37:13.880 --> 37:16.120
 all these letters or words of gratitude.

37:16.120 --> 37:18.240
 How is it that you can create that sense

37:18.240 --> 37:20.280
 of receiving gratitude for yourself

37:20.280 --> 37:23.140
 and thereby derive the effects of gratitude

37:23.140 --> 37:24.920
 as outlined in this particular study?

37:24.920 --> 37:27.160
 And there we go back to the important work

37:27.160 --> 37:29.360
 of the great Antonio Damasio

37:29.360 --> 37:32.040
 who explored these neural correlates of gratitude

37:32.040 --> 37:33.560
 to define the areas of the brain

37:33.560 --> 37:35.360
 that are associated with pro-social behaviors

37:35.360 --> 37:37.360
 like the prefrontal cortex.

37:37.360 --> 37:40.280
 And what's really interesting about the work

37:40.280 --> 37:42.400
 that Damasio and colleagues did is,

37:42.400 --> 37:44.160
 first of all, they used functional

37:44.160 --> 37:45.500
 magnetic resonance imaging.

37:45.500 --> 37:48.580
 So this is a very high resolution approach

37:48.580 --> 37:51.360
 to exploring what areas of the brain are active

37:51.360 --> 37:53.760
 and it has very high, what we call temporal resolution,

37:53.760 --> 37:57.240
 meaning you can see things in time at very fine scales.

37:57.240 --> 38:00.040
 So a lot of mechanistic detail

38:00.040 --> 38:02.000
 can emerge from these sorts of studies.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.900
 What they did was interesting.

38:03.900 --> 38:07.640
 Rather than have people express gratitude,

38:07.640 --> 38:10.660
 they had the subjects go into the scanner,

38:10.660 --> 38:12.200
 so their brains are being imaged,

38:12.200 --> 38:17.200
 and they watched narratives, stories about other people

38:18.120 --> 38:22.000
 experiencing positive things in their life.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.620
 And in this case, these were powerful stories.

38:24.620 --> 38:27.200
 These were stories about survivors of genocide

38:27.200 --> 38:28.520
 so that's what they're watching.

38:28.520 --> 38:29.800
 The subjects were subjects

38:29.800 --> 38:32.160
 that were not survivors of genocide.

38:32.160 --> 38:34.220
 So they were watching these videotapes

38:34.220 --> 38:36.880
 of people that had survived genocide

38:36.880 --> 38:40.880
 and had people help them along the way

38:40.880 --> 38:43.200
 as part of their story of survival,

38:43.200 --> 38:46.120
 either psychological and obviously they survived

38:46.120 --> 38:49.140
 long enough to make the video or physical survival.

38:49.140 --> 38:50.860
 So within these stories,

38:50.860 --> 38:54.620
 there was conveyance of a lot of struggle.

38:54.620 --> 38:57.440
 These people talked about the horrible situations they were

38:57.440 --> 39:02.440
 but also small but highly significant features

39:02.680 --> 39:04.040
 of their history that had led

39:04.040 --> 39:06.280
 to their own feelings of gratitude.

39:06.280 --> 39:09.380
 So for instance, it says a woman at the image,

39:09.380 --> 39:12.320
 this is literally from the scientific paper,

39:12.320 --> 39:14.040
 somebody had been sick for weeks.

39:14.040 --> 39:16.920
 So the woman's describing how she'd been sick for weeks.

39:16.920 --> 39:21.380
 And then another prisoner who was a doctor

39:21.380 --> 39:23.440
 finds a particular medicine somehow,

39:23.440 --> 39:26.540
 it doesn't describe how, and literally saves her life.

39:26.540 --> 39:30.560
 Or an ally who was also in a stricken circumstance

39:31.920 --> 39:34.460
 gave this person a pair of glasses

39:34.460 --> 39:36.860
 when their eyesight started to falter.

39:36.860 --> 39:38.080
 So these sorts of stories.

39:38.080 --> 39:40.120
 Now, just hearing this in the context

39:40.120 --> 39:42.180
 of nothing but a scientific paper and discussion,

39:42.180 --> 39:44.340
 these probably aren't that impactful.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.240
 What's really important about this study

39:46.240 --> 39:48.300
 and is really important for all of us to know

39:48.300 --> 39:52.000
 is that these stories of other people receiving things

39:52.000 --> 39:54.400
 that were powerful for them in their life trajectory

39:54.400 --> 39:56.640
 is embedded in story.

39:56.640 --> 40:00.240
 And the human brain especially

40:00.240 --> 40:02.560
 is so oriented towards story.

40:02.560 --> 40:06.000
 We have neural circuits that like to link together

40:06.000 --> 40:08.840
 past, present, future, have different characters,

40:08.840 --> 40:10.680
 protagonists and antagonists.

40:10.680 --> 40:11.800
 From the time we're very young

40:11.800 --> 40:12.840
 until the time we're very old,

40:12.840 --> 40:15.200
 story is one of the major ways

40:15.200 --> 40:17.000
 that we organize information in the brain.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.600
 There does seem to be storytelling

40:19.600 --> 40:22.320
 and story listening circuits in the brain.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.880
 So what's important is not simply

40:24.880 --> 40:26.480
 that these people survive genocide,

40:26.480 --> 40:29.160
 that's obviously important and wonderful,

40:29.160 --> 40:31.800
 but it's not just that they were helped along the way,

40:31.800 --> 40:33.720
 it's that the description of their help

40:33.720 --> 40:35.800
 is embedded in a larger story.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.700
 So the human subject in this scientific study

40:38.700 --> 40:41.180
 is watching these powerful stories.

40:41.180 --> 40:44.720
 And the neural circuits associated with prosocial behaviors

40:44.720 --> 40:48.320
 and with gratitude become robustly active

40:48.320 --> 40:51.740
 when they start to feel some affiliation

40:51.740 --> 40:53.120
 with the person telling the story.

40:53.120 --> 40:54.680
 They start to feel some resonance.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.640
 We might call that empathy,

40:56.640 --> 40:58.840
 but it doesn't necessarily have to be empathy.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.900
 Empathy is a somewhat complicated thing to define

41:01.900 --> 41:04.840
 because it involves literally a setting aside

41:04.840 --> 41:08.520
 of one's own emotions and really focusing almost entirely

41:08.520 --> 41:11.460
 or experiencing almost entirely the emotions of another.

41:11.460 --> 41:13.740
 It could be sympathy, it could be empathy.

41:13.740 --> 41:17.000
 What we do know is that the stories themselves

41:17.000 --> 41:18.680
 were able to shift the physiology

41:18.680 --> 41:20.800
 of the subjects in this study

41:20.800 --> 41:23.960
 and activate these what we're calling gratitude circuitry

41:23.960 --> 41:25.920
 that involves the prefrontal cortex.

41:25.920 --> 41:27.980
 So if you think about the earlier study

41:27.980 --> 41:30.460
 that receiving gratitude is the most powerful way

41:30.460 --> 41:33.000
 to activate these circuits for gratitude,

41:33.960 --> 41:35.840
 the subjects in this study in many ways

41:35.840 --> 41:38.720
 are receiving a sense of gratitude,

41:39.720 --> 41:43.320
 but through the narrative of one of these other subjects,

41:43.320 --> 41:44.800
 which I find fascinating.

41:44.800 --> 41:47.240
 I would have thought a great gratitude practice

41:47.240 --> 41:48.280
 would be to sit down and list out

41:48.280 --> 41:49.480
 all the things you're grateful for.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.180
 That just seems so logical to me,

41:51.180 --> 41:52.840
 but it turns out that these neural circuits

41:52.840 --> 41:53.680
 don't work that way.

41:53.680 --> 41:56.480
 That to really activate these circuits for gratitude

41:56.480 --> 41:59.480
 and the serotonin and probably the oxytocin system as well

41:59.480 --> 42:01.380
 and its prefrontal networks,

42:01.380 --> 42:03.900
 one has to powerfully associate

42:03.900 --> 42:06.180
 with the idea of receiving help.

42:07.080 --> 42:11.960
 The subjects are associating or experiencing empathy

42:11.960 --> 42:14.800
 or sympathy for somebody else who received help.

42:14.800 --> 42:17.160
 In the other study we described a few minutes ago,

42:17.160 --> 42:20.200
 the person hearing the letter was receiving gratitude

42:20.200 --> 42:23.040
 and that would amplify the activity of these circuits.

42:23.040 --> 42:26.060
 And that takes us to a larger theme

42:26.060 --> 42:28.440
 of what are these prosocial circuits?

42:28.440 --> 42:31.400
 And an important concept to emerge from this

42:31.400 --> 42:33.720
 is one that's most often associated

42:33.720 --> 42:35.860
 with the autism literature, frankly,

42:35.860 --> 42:38.200
 which is this idea of theory of mind.

42:38.200 --> 42:40.280
 So just very briefly, theory of mind

42:40.280 --> 42:42.520
 is the ability to attribute

42:42.520 --> 42:45.900
 or to understand the experience of another

42:45.900 --> 42:47.840
 without actually experiencing the thing

42:47.840 --> 42:49.000
 that they're experiencing.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.720
 Again, it kind of sounds like empathy,

42:50.720 --> 42:54.240
 but this was actually a term

42:54.240 --> 42:56.020
 that's now been demonstrated

42:56.020 --> 42:57.520
 in the psychology and neuroscience

42:57.520 --> 43:01.000
 that's been linked to some very robust findings

43:01.000 --> 43:03.140
 associated with brain areas and so forth

43:03.140 --> 43:07.720
 that was looking at autistic kids and non-autistic kids.

43:07.720 --> 43:08.980
 The person largely responsible

43:08.980 --> 43:12.560
 for developing theory of mind is Simon Baron Cohen.

43:12.560 --> 43:14.620
 I believe he's either the brother or the cousin,

43:14.620 --> 43:16.040
 I can't recall which,

43:16.040 --> 43:18.280
 to the comedian Sasha Baron Cohen.

43:18.280 --> 43:21.100
 Simon Baron Cohen is a professor at Oxford University,

43:21.100 --> 43:23.120
 or at least he was the last time I checked.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.000
 And the theory of mind test

43:26.000 --> 43:28.880
 can be done on adults or on children.

43:28.880 --> 43:30.800
 And we can sort of do that experiment right now,

43:30.800 --> 43:32.860
 if you like, and you can think about how you would behave

43:32.860 --> 43:36.440
 if you were a subject in a theory of mind test.

43:36.440 --> 43:38.560
 Theory of mind test involves you or a child

43:38.560 --> 43:40.120
 or some other adults sitting down

43:40.120 --> 43:43.880
 and watching a video of a child going into a room

43:43.880 --> 43:45.040
 or a person going to a room,

43:45.040 --> 43:48.440
 opening up a desk or a dresser, a drawer, for instance,

43:48.440 --> 43:50.880
 or a desk drawer, and placing something in it,

43:50.880 --> 43:53.680
 like a pen or a toy, and then leaving.

43:53.680 --> 43:56.760
 And then another person walking into the room

43:56.760 --> 44:00.460
 and clearly looking for something in the room,

44:00.460 --> 44:02.280
 and one presumes it's the toy or the pen,

44:02.280 --> 44:03.520
 depending on the context.

44:04.640 --> 44:06.640
 People who have strong theory of mind

44:06.640 --> 44:09.040
 make the obvious conclusion

44:09.040 --> 44:13.540
 that the person looking around for the pen or the toy

44:13.540 --> 44:16.760
 is confused or they're perplexed.

44:16.760 --> 44:18.160
 They don't know where the toy is.

44:18.160 --> 44:19.440
 They're looking for the toy.

44:19.440 --> 44:23.240
 Someone who is fairly far to one side

44:23.240 --> 44:26.400
 of the autism or Asperger's spectrum

44:26.400 --> 44:29.760
 will simply focus on the location of the object,

44:29.760 --> 44:32.680
 on the location of the pen or the toy.

44:32.680 --> 44:34.280
 And this is especially true in children.

44:34.280 --> 44:36.080
 They will say, well, it's in the second drawer.

44:36.080 --> 44:36.920
 It's in the second drawer.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.720
 And they'll say, well, how does the person

44:38.720 --> 44:39.640
 who comes into the room feel?

44:39.640 --> 44:41.200
 And they'll say, well, it's in the drawer.

44:41.200 --> 44:45.320
 So they tend to focus on the specific factual elements

44:45.320 --> 44:48.300
 of the scenario rather than place their mind

44:48.300 --> 44:51.920
 into the mind of the other person, so-called theory of mind.

44:51.920 --> 44:54.240
 Now, that doesn't mean that people with autism

44:54.240 --> 44:56.200
 and Asperger's don't have empathy.

44:56.200 --> 44:57.720
 In some cases, they can.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.720
 It sort of depends on where they are in the spectrum

44:59.720 --> 45:00.600
 and so forth.

45:00.600 --> 45:04.560
 But theory of mind has very strong basis

45:04.560 --> 45:06.880
 in these prefrontal cortex neural circuits

45:06.880 --> 45:09.720
 that we were talking about because, as you now know,

45:09.720 --> 45:12.540
 the prefrontal cortex sets context

45:12.540 --> 45:14.040
 on what we see and experience.

45:14.040 --> 45:16.840
 And the theory of mind task that I just described

45:16.840 --> 45:21.840
 very briefly is a pure example of context setting, right?

45:23.160 --> 45:25.680
 It's not about just the factual elements

45:25.680 --> 45:28.020
 about the location of the objects.

45:28.020 --> 45:29.120
 It's about the context.

45:29.120 --> 45:31.180
 Someone is looking for something that someone else

45:31.180 --> 45:34.160
 put someplace that makes it such that that object

45:34.160 --> 45:35.080
 is hidden.

45:35.080 --> 45:37.200
 So basically, theory of mind is your ability

45:37.200 --> 45:39.680
 to put yourself into the mindset of another.

45:39.680 --> 45:44.360
 And in order to get activation of these gratitude circuits,

45:44.360 --> 45:47.780
 one needs to put themselves into the mindset of another

45:47.780 --> 45:50.080
 or to directly receive gratitude.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.580
 So let's just take a moment and start to think about

45:52.580 --> 45:54.000
 how we are going to build out

45:54.000 --> 45:55.900
 the ultimate gratitude practice,

45:55.900 --> 46:00.220
 meaning the most effective gratitude practice for us to do

46:00.220 --> 46:02.020
 because of all the many positive effects

46:02.020 --> 46:04.680
 that an effective gratitude practice can have

46:04.680 --> 46:06.080
 if it's the proper one.

46:08.160 --> 46:11.360
 It's very clear that receiving gratitude is powerful,

46:11.360 --> 46:13.500
 but it's also very clear that waiting around

46:13.500 --> 46:16.340
 to receive that gratitude is an impractical approach.

46:16.340 --> 46:19.500
 Now, there are methods that have been developed

46:19.500 --> 46:22.640
 by my colleague at Stanford, Kelly McGonigal,

46:22.640 --> 46:25.480
 and others that actually have developed things

46:25.480 --> 46:28.380
 for the workplace, for school, for coworkers and students

46:28.380 --> 46:32.500
 to write out particular worksheets related to

46:32.500 --> 46:34.600
 what they're thankful for from others and exchange them.

46:34.600 --> 46:36.200
 And so those are very useful practices.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.520
 I don't want to take anything away from the important work

46:38.520 --> 46:40.520
 that Kelly and others have done.

46:40.520 --> 46:42.960
 But in the absence of having other people

46:42.960 --> 46:45.120
 to do these practices with,

46:45.120 --> 46:47.440
 what we know for sure is that

46:47.440 --> 46:50.580
 there has to be a real experience

46:50.580 --> 46:53.160
 of somebody else's experience,

46:53.160 --> 46:56.440
 and that the best way to do that is story.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.760
 So in thinking about how to build out

46:58.760 --> 47:00.980
 an effective gratitude practice,

47:00.980 --> 47:02.940
 it's very worthwhile, I believe,

47:02.940 --> 47:07.940
 to find someone's narrative that's powerful for you.

47:08.240 --> 47:10.680
 In many ways to think about this is

47:10.680 --> 47:13.760
 it's got to be a story that inspires you

47:13.760 --> 47:16.780
 because of the, for lack of a better phrase,

47:16.780 --> 47:18.640
 the beauty of the human spirit

47:18.640 --> 47:21.880
 or the ability of humans to help other humans.

47:21.880 --> 47:25.440
 And I find this remarkable because what this really means

47:25.440 --> 47:28.080
 is that the circuits for gratitude

47:28.080 --> 47:32.320
 are such that we can exchange gratitude.

47:32.320 --> 47:35.280
 We can actually observe someone else getting help,

47:35.280 --> 47:36.760
 someone else giving help.

47:36.760 --> 47:40.020
 And that observation of our species

47:40.020 --> 47:42.120
 doing that for one another

47:42.120 --> 47:46.880
 allows us to experience the feeling of a genuine chemical

47:46.880 --> 47:50.540
 and neural circuit activation lift, if you will.

47:50.540 --> 47:53.820
 Very, very different than simply writing out the things

47:53.820 --> 47:55.680
 that you're thankful for, right?

47:55.680 --> 47:57.800
 And so how would you do this?

47:57.800 --> 48:01.000
 Well, people digest story in a number of different ways.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.880
 People watch movies, people listen to podcasts,

48:03.880 --> 48:04.980
 people read books.

48:04.980 --> 48:07.480
 There are a tremendous number of stories out there.

48:08.680 --> 48:10.820
 It's clear that an effective gratitude practice

48:10.820 --> 48:13.260
 has to be repeated from time to time.

48:13.260 --> 48:16.600
 So what I would not suggest is that we build a protocol

48:16.600 --> 48:18.380
 in which you're constantly foraging

48:18.380 --> 48:21.160
 for inspirational stories over and over again.

48:21.160 --> 48:24.280
 Social media and the internet are replete with those.

48:24.280 --> 48:27.200
 That's not going to be a very potent protocol or tool

48:27.200 --> 48:29.820
 because the most potent protocol or tool for gratitude

48:29.820 --> 48:32.520
 is going to be one that you repeat over and over again.

48:33.820 --> 48:36.320
 Rather, the most effective protocol or tool

48:36.320 --> 48:40.800
 is going to be either to think into,

48:40.800 --> 48:42.360
 and you could write this out if you like,

48:42.360 --> 48:45.360
 but think into when somebody was thankful

48:45.360 --> 48:47.080
 for something that you did

48:47.080 --> 48:49.600
 and really start to think about how you felt

48:49.600 --> 48:54.420
 in receiving that gratitude or, and or I should say,

48:55.800 --> 48:59.320
 imagining or thinking about deeply the emotional experience

48:59.320 --> 49:02.840
 of somebody else receiving help.

49:02.840 --> 49:05.180
 Now, what narrative you select

49:05.180 --> 49:07.960
 is going to be very dependent on you and your taste.

49:07.960 --> 49:10.840
 It's going to be very dependent on what resonates with you.

49:10.840 --> 49:14.180
 But again, I want to emphasize that the story

49:14.180 --> 49:17.080
 that you select does not have to have any semblance

49:17.080 --> 49:18.720
 to your own life experience.

49:18.720 --> 49:21.000
 It's just about what happens to move you.

49:21.000 --> 49:23.940
 And so the way that one could do this,

49:23.940 --> 49:26.200
 and actually I've started this practice for myself

49:26.200 --> 49:28.120
 on the basis of the learnings I've had

49:28.120 --> 49:31.280
 in the last few weeks around preparing for this episode,

49:31.280 --> 49:34.040
 is to find a story that's particularly meaningful for you

49:34.040 --> 49:38.000
 and then to just take some short notes, bullet point notes

49:38.000 --> 49:40.540
 about maybe list out, for instance,

49:40.540 --> 49:43.360
 on just a small sheet of paper or in your phone,

49:43.360 --> 49:46.960
 if that's your preference, just list out, for instance,

49:46.960 --> 49:51.700
 what the struggle was, what the help was,

49:51.700 --> 49:55.760
 and something about how that impacts you emotionally.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.100
 Okay, this is something just for you.

49:57.100 --> 49:59.380
 You don't have to share it with anybody.

49:59.380 --> 50:02.920
 That kind of shorthand list of bullet point notes

50:02.920 --> 50:06.160
 serves as your shorthand for getting into this mode

50:06.160 --> 50:09.480
 that we're calling gratitude and actually closely mimics

50:09.480 --> 50:11.760
 a lot of what was done in these various studies.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.360
 Because even though the studies I've talked about

50:13.360 --> 50:17.120
 up until now were really focused on what we call acute

50:17.120 --> 50:20.280
 imaging studies, where someone watched a story

50:20.280 --> 50:22.840
 or received gratitude while the experiment was done

50:22.840 --> 50:24.580
 and then that's it, one and done.

50:24.580 --> 50:27.720
 There are other studies looking at gratitude in this context

50:27.720 --> 50:29.480
 over many weeks, up to six weeks.

50:29.480 --> 50:32.360
 And what one observes is that there's so-called

50:32.360 --> 50:34.560
 neuroplasticity of these circuits.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.800
 Neuroplasticity is the brain and nervous system's ability

50:36.800 --> 50:38.520
 to change in response to experience.

50:38.520 --> 50:41.540
 And that these neural circuits start developing

50:41.540 --> 50:43.520
 a familiarity with the narrative.

50:43.520 --> 50:45.600
 So that, for instance, let's say you sit down

50:45.600 --> 50:47.320
 the first time you've found a story

50:47.320 --> 50:49.100
 that you find particularly compelling,

50:49.100 --> 50:52.080
 you've written down a few notes about what that story is,

50:52.080 --> 50:55.200
 just to remind you, and then you read those out

50:55.200 --> 50:58.080
 and you think into the richness of that experience,

50:58.080 --> 51:00.480
 that receiving of gratitude, or if you prefer,

51:00.480 --> 51:02.200
 you're doing the protocol where you're thinking about

51:02.200 --> 51:05.600
 when someone was deeply grateful or was genuinely grateful

51:05.600 --> 51:07.440
 to you, that you're thinking about that,

51:07.440 --> 51:10.040
 the neural circuits become activated more easily

51:10.040 --> 51:12.400
 with each subsequent repeat of the practice.

51:12.400 --> 51:15.380
 Now, this could be done literally for one minute

51:15.380 --> 51:17.660
 or two minutes or three minutes.

51:17.660 --> 51:20.080
 This is not an extensively long practice.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.680
 And that's another beauty of gratitude practices

51:22.680 --> 51:25.500
 is that they have these outsized positive effects

51:25.500 --> 51:27.560
 on so many aspects of our physiology,

51:27.560 --> 51:29.460
 but these are very short practices.

51:29.460 --> 51:30.600
 They're the kind of thing that you can do,

51:30.600 --> 51:32.920
 walk into your car, the kind of thing you can just sit down

51:32.920 --> 51:35.260
 for a minute and set a timer and do,

51:35.260 --> 51:36.720
 because they are really about changing

51:36.720 --> 51:38.440
 your state of mind and body.

51:38.440 --> 51:41.640
 And if you have an experience of receiving gratitude

51:41.640 --> 51:43.840
 or a story that's very potent for you,

51:43.840 --> 51:47.260
 it becomes a sort of shortcut into the gratitude network,

51:47.260 --> 51:48.980
 these pro-social networks,

51:48.980 --> 51:50.520
 meaning the activation of these circuits

51:50.520 --> 51:52.240
 becomes almost instantaneous.

51:52.240 --> 51:53.240
 And that's very different

51:53.240 --> 51:55.400
 than a lot of other practices out there.

51:55.400 --> 51:57.880
 I'm not aware of any meditation practices, for instance,

51:57.880 --> 52:00.840
 that you can do only a few times,

52:00.840 --> 52:03.640
 and then within a week or so,

52:03.640 --> 52:04.920
 you just have to do them for one minute,

52:04.920 --> 52:07.680
 you immediately drop into the kind of optimal state

52:07.680 --> 52:10.120
 that that meditation practice is designed to create.

52:10.120 --> 52:11.800
 There are some shorter meditation practices

52:11.800 --> 52:14.020
 that are very potent and very effective like that,

52:14.020 --> 52:16.700
 but gratitude and the circuits associated with it

52:16.700 --> 52:18.600
 appear to be especially plastic,

52:18.600 --> 52:23.200
 meaning especially prone to being able to be triggered

52:23.200 --> 52:24.860
 in the good sense of the word triggered,

52:24.860 --> 52:26.780
 just by simply reminding yourself

52:26.780 --> 52:28.360
 of this particular narrative.

52:28.360 --> 52:30.760
 Now there's another very clear and positive effect

52:30.760 --> 52:33.840
 of using this narrative or story-based approach

52:33.840 --> 52:35.480
 to a gratitude practice.

52:35.480 --> 52:39.240
 And that's what story does for our physiology.

52:40.480 --> 52:41.440
 Earlier in the episode,

52:41.440 --> 52:43.840
 I mentioned this really incredible study

52:43.840 --> 52:46.200
 in which listening to a story

52:47.100 --> 52:51.400
 coordinated the heart rate of different individuals

52:51.400 --> 52:54.980
 and literally changed the way that their heart was beating.

52:54.980 --> 52:57.000
 The title of this study

52:57.000 --> 52:59.820
 is conscious processing of narrative stimuli

52:59.820 --> 53:01.960
 synchronizes heart rate between individuals.

53:01.960 --> 53:06.040
 The first author is Perez, again, published in Cell Reports,

53:06.040 --> 53:08.100
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

53:08.100 --> 53:09.760
 And it's a really elegant study.

53:09.760 --> 53:11.340
 They looked at instantaneous heart rate.

53:11.340 --> 53:13.000
 They use electrocardiogram to do that,

53:13.000 --> 53:15.400
 which is simply a way to look at heart beats

53:15.400 --> 53:17.520
 with very fine precision.

53:17.520 --> 53:19.660
 They also looked at the breathing of subjects

53:19.660 --> 53:21.720
 as they listened to these stories.

53:21.720 --> 53:24.480
 Some of you may know that breathing and heart rate

53:24.480 --> 53:25.800
 are actually linked to one another

53:25.800 --> 53:27.300
 in a really interesting way.

53:27.300 --> 53:30.000
 The simple way to put it is that when you inhale,

53:30.000 --> 53:32.060
 your heart rate speeds up a little bit.

53:32.060 --> 53:34.800
 And when you exhale, your heart rate slows down.

53:34.800 --> 53:38.240
 And this is because of the movement of the diaphragm

53:38.240 --> 53:40.580
 in your thoracic cavity.

53:40.580 --> 53:43.040
 And the physicians and medical types

53:43.040 --> 53:45.680
 call this respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.280
 There's a mechanism there we could get into,

53:47.280 --> 53:49.640
 but I don't want to distract us from the main theme here.

53:49.640 --> 53:52.160
 So just remember when you inhale, your heart rate speeds up.

53:52.160 --> 53:54.480
 And when you exhale, your heart rate slows down.

53:54.480 --> 53:55.320
 They looked at breathing.

53:55.320 --> 53:57.880
 They looked at heart rate in different individuals.

53:57.880 --> 54:02.880
 And listening to a story produced very consistent gaps

54:05.560 --> 54:08.800
 between the heart rates of the people who are listening.

54:08.800 --> 54:12.040
 Different individuals in the study who were not located

54:12.040 --> 54:15.080
 in the same place when they listened to the story,

54:15.080 --> 54:17.200
 listening to the story in different times,

54:17.200 --> 54:19.620
 different days entirely,

54:19.620 --> 54:23.860
 had very similar heartbeat patterns listening to this story.

54:23.860 --> 54:25.820
 What this means for your gratitude practice

54:25.820 --> 54:29.740
 is that having a story that you can return to

54:29.740 --> 54:32.500
 over and over again, even if it's not the entire story,

54:32.500 --> 54:34.800
 you're just using the shorthand bullet point

54:34.800 --> 54:36.420
 version of your story,

54:36.420 --> 54:40.420
 will create a perceptible and real shift

54:40.420 --> 54:43.320
 in your heartbeat and in your breathing.

54:43.320 --> 54:46.080
 And actually that's been demonstrated over and over now

54:46.080 --> 54:47.840
 that an effective gratitude practice

54:47.840 --> 54:49.800
 is one that can rapidly shift,

54:49.800 --> 54:52.720
 not just the activation of these circuits in your brain

54:52.720 --> 54:54.320
 for pro-social behaviors,

54:54.320 --> 54:59.320
 but also activation of particular circuits in your heart

55:00.500 --> 55:02.760
 and in your lungs and the other organs of your body

55:02.760 --> 55:06.320
 such that you can get into a reproducible state

55:06.320 --> 55:08.600
 of gratitude each time.

55:08.600 --> 55:10.200
 So an important component here

55:10.200 --> 55:13.200
 is that there be some element of story.

55:13.200 --> 55:15.120
 Again, you don't have to listen to or read

55:15.120 --> 55:17.280
 or think about the entire story start to finish

55:17.280 --> 55:18.920
 in order to extract these benefits

55:18.920 --> 55:22.520
 and that it be the same story over and over.

55:22.520 --> 55:25.320
 And as a consequence, that's going to shift your physiology

55:25.320 --> 55:27.800
 into presumably a more relaxed state

55:27.800 --> 55:28.940
 because typically that's the one

55:28.940 --> 55:30.920
 that's associated with gratitude.

55:30.920 --> 55:33.960
 Although activation of these gratitude circuits

55:33.960 --> 55:38.340
 has also been shown to create sense of awe or sense of joy.

55:38.340 --> 55:41.120
 There are a few studies looking at and kind of parsing

55:41.120 --> 55:43.460
 the difference between gratitude and joy.

55:43.460 --> 55:46.020
 I was able to find a few studies about that,

55:46.020 --> 55:49.600
 but in general, the neural circuits that are activated

55:49.600 --> 55:51.080
 tend to overlap quite a lot

55:51.080 --> 55:54.300
 with those that create a sense of gratitude.

55:54.300 --> 55:56.720
 So we don't want to split hairs unnecessarily there.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.840
 The key thing is that you want to use the same story,

55:59.840 --> 56:02.200
 even if it's your own experience or somebody else's

56:02.200 --> 56:04.280
 and keep coming back to it over and over again.

56:04.280 --> 56:05.960
 That makes it a very potent tool

56:05.960 --> 56:08.920
 that you can get a tremendous amount of benefit from

56:08.920 --> 56:12.620
 with even as short as 60 seconds of practice.

56:12.620 --> 56:16.160
 Earlier, I talked about how you can't lie to yourself

56:16.160 --> 56:19.040
 and say, you know, I'm so grateful for this thing

56:19.040 --> 56:20.600
 that I actually hate.

56:20.600 --> 56:23.080
 And in a moment, I'm going to tell you

56:23.080 --> 56:24.440
 about some scientific data

56:24.440 --> 56:28.180
 that proves the statement I made is true

56:28.180 --> 56:30.820
 and that you can't just lie to yourself

56:30.820 --> 56:33.940
 and derive the benefits of a gratitude practice.

56:33.940 --> 56:35.720
 The data are also going to point to the fact

56:35.720 --> 56:38.540
 that if you are giving gratitude,

56:38.540 --> 56:40.680
 not just receiving it, but giving gratitude,

56:40.680 --> 56:43.000
 that too has to be genuine.

56:43.000 --> 56:44.800
 There's a really interesting study

56:44.800 --> 56:46.440
 published in Scientific Reports,

56:46.440 --> 56:48.640
 which is a nature research journal.

56:48.640 --> 56:51.780
 The title of it is, neural responses to intention

56:51.780 --> 56:53.840
 and benefit appraisal are critical

56:53.840 --> 56:55.880
 in distinguishing gratitude and joy.

56:55.880 --> 56:57.800
 It's a somewhat complicated study,

56:57.800 --> 56:59.480
 so I'm just going to hit on some of the high points.

56:59.480 --> 57:00.740
 But basically what they did

57:00.740 --> 57:03.800
 is they use functional magnetic resonance imaging.

57:03.800 --> 57:06.520
 So they could look at brain circuitry activation

57:06.520 --> 57:08.420
 with very high precision.

57:08.420 --> 57:11.040
 And they had people receiving money

57:12.520 --> 57:15.280
 in the context of this experiment.

57:15.280 --> 57:18.440
 And they had some knowledge as to whether or not

57:18.440 --> 57:19.980
 the money that they were receiving

57:19.980 --> 57:23.360
 was given to them wholeheartedly or reluctantly.

57:23.360 --> 57:25.360
 And there were a number of different variables in the study,

57:25.360 --> 57:26.920
 including how much money was given.

57:26.920 --> 57:28.280
 So in some cases it was very little,

57:28.280 --> 57:29.480
 in other cases it was modest,

57:29.480 --> 57:31.720
 in other cases it was a lot more.

57:31.720 --> 57:33.640
 And they also varied the extent

57:33.640 --> 57:35.440
 to which the giver of the money,

57:35.440 --> 57:37.240
 that they called the benefactor,

57:37.240 --> 57:38.640
 was doing it wholeheartedly

57:38.640 --> 57:41.080
 or seemed to be doing it somewhat reluctantly.

57:41.080 --> 57:45.260
 And they looked at whether or not the sense of gratitude

57:45.260 --> 57:48.280
 scaled with the amount of money received

57:49.340 --> 57:53.120
 and or the intention of the benefactor,

57:53.120 --> 57:54.640
 whether or not the person giving the money

57:54.640 --> 57:57.040
 was doing it wholeheartedly or reluctantly.

57:57.040 --> 57:59.680
 And what's remarkable is that

57:59.680 --> 58:04.200
 while the amount of money given was a strong component

58:04.200 --> 58:07.240
 in whether or not somebody felt

58:07.240 --> 58:10.160
 that they had received gratitude, which makes sense,

58:10.160 --> 58:13.440
 you know, the amount of money is some metric

58:13.440 --> 58:17.000
 of whether or not somebody feels thanked.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.000
 The stronger variable, the bigger impact,

58:20.000 --> 58:22.860
 came from whether or not the person giving the money

58:22.860 --> 58:26.060
 was giving it with a wholehearted intention

58:26.060 --> 58:28.280
 and not a reluctant intention.

58:28.280 --> 58:30.040
 And of course there was an interaction

58:30.040 --> 58:31.840
 where the best circumstance of course

58:31.840 --> 58:34.020
 is where the person received a lot of money

58:34.020 --> 58:35.520
 from somebody who wholeheartedly

58:35.520 --> 58:36.800
 wanted to give them a lot of money.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.360
 And they did every derivation of this,

58:38.360 --> 58:40.120
 but this is important.

58:40.120 --> 58:43.560
 This tells us many things that extend way beyond

58:43.560 --> 58:44.800
 gratitude practices,

58:44.800 --> 58:49.800
 which is that genuine thanks are what count, okay?

58:50.200 --> 58:52.240
 We could probably presume that,

58:52.240 --> 58:56.800
 but receiving genuine thanks is also a strong variable

58:56.800 --> 59:00.980
 in determining whether or not we experience real gratitude

59:00.980 --> 59:02.960
 or whether or not it's empty,

59:02.960 --> 59:05.120
 regardless of the size of a gift.

59:05.120 --> 59:08.440
 So this constrains our gratitude practices somewhat,

59:08.440 --> 59:11.600
 but I think in an interesting and important way,

59:11.600 --> 59:13.440
 you can't make this stuff up.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.760
 You can't tell yourself that an experience was great

59:15.760 --> 59:18.240
 or that, you know, I got a lot of money

59:18.240 --> 59:20.560
 and therefore it justified it,

59:20.560 --> 59:21.480
 even though, you know,

59:21.480 --> 59:23.080
 I think that they gave it to me reluctantly

59:23.080 --> 59:25.800
 or my boss hates me, but they gave me a raise.

59:25.800 --> 59:28.480
 That stuff stings for all the right reasons,

59:28.480 --> 59:31.240
 because there are circuits in our brain and body

59:31.240 --> 59:34.560
 that are oriented towards these pro-social interactions.

59:34.560 --> 59:37.240
 And in some sense, what we are looking for as a species,

59:37.240 --> 59:39.600
 what these circuits want, if you will,

59:39.600 --> 59:41.980
 is to receive things from people

59:41.980 --> 59:43.820
 that are giving them wholeheartedly.

59:43.820 --> 59:46.900
 And that tells us that if we are the giver,

59:46.900 --> 59:48.960
 that we better be giving wholeheartedly

59:48.960 --> 59:51.640
 or we are undermining the sense of gratitude

59:51.640 --> 59:53.780
 that someone is going to receive from us.

59:53.780 --> 59:55.560
 So we are gradually building up

59:55.560 --> 59:58.000
 the ultimate gratitude practice

59:58.000 --> 1:00:01.000
 based on the variety of scientific literature

1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:02.340
 that's out there.

1:00:02.340 --> 1:00:04.940
 And I know that many people are probably interested

1:00:04.940 --> 1:00:06.480
 in developing a gratitude practice

1:00:06.480 --> 1:00:08.080
 that has long lasting,

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:09.800
 maybe even permanent positive effects

1:00:09.800 --> 1:00:11.340
 on their neural circuitry.

1:00:11.340 --> 1:00:13.760
 So with that in mind,

1:00:13.760 --> 1:00:17.240
 I want to turn our attention to a really interesting study.

1:00:17.240 --> 1:00:19.840
 It's entitled Effects of Gratitude Meditation

1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:22.040
 on Neural Network Functional Connectivity

1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:24.100
 and Brain-Heart Coupling.

1:00:24.100 --> 1:00:26.000
 And to make a long story short

1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:28.920
 and a lot simpler than that title,

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:32.780
 repeated gratitude practice changes the way

1:00:32.780 --> 1:00:34.640
 that your brain circuits work.

1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:37.680
 And it also changes the way in which your heart

1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:39.960
 and your brain interact.

1:00:39.960 --> 1:00:40.880
 You're familiar with the fact

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:41.880
 that your brain controls your heart

1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:43.240
 because you could be stressed about something

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:44.600
 that's perceived with your brain

1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:46.520
 and then your heart rate will speed up.

1:00:46.520 --> 1:00:47.960
 You're probably also familiar with the fact

1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:49.360
 that if your heart rate speeds up

1:00:49.360 --> 1:00:50.840
 for some reason or no reason,

1:00:50.840 --> 1:00:51.680
 you're probably thinking,

1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:52.920
 well, what's making my heart rate speed up?

1:00:52.920 --> 1:00:54.800
 And that's because the brain and the heart

1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:57.980
 are reciprocally innervated, as we say.

1:00:57.980 --> 1:00:59.920
 They're talking to one another in both directions.

1:00:59.920 --> 1:01:02.120
 It's a two-way highway.

1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:04.880
 This study looked at changes in so-called

1:01:04.880 --> 1:01:07.400
 functional connectivity within the brain

1:01:07.400 --> 1:01:09.600
 and between the brain and the heart

1:01:09.600 --> 1:01:12.280
 in response to gratitude practices.

1:01:12.280 --> 1:01:14.320
 And as a control, they used what I think

1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:16.880
 is very interesting, a resentment intervention.

1:01:16.880 --> 1:01:20.880
 I think resentment is an apt control

1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:23.080
 and quite different than gratitude.

1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:24.120
 To make a long story short,

1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:27.000
 what they found is that a repeated gratitude practice

1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.520
 could change the resting state,

1:01:29.520 --> 1:01:32.840
 functional connectivity in emotion and motivation

1:01:32.840 --> 1:01:34.320
 related brain regions.

1:01:34.320 --> 1:01:36.420
 If I haven't mentioned a strong enough incentive

1:01:36.420 --> 1:01:40.020
 for doing a regular gratitude practice until now,

1:01:40.020 --> 1:01:42.600
 this is definitely the one to pay attention to.

1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:45.400
 Because what they found was a regular gratitude practice

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:50.040
 could shift the functional connectivity of emotion pathways

1:01:50.040 --> 1:01:53.320
 in ways that made anxiety and fear circuits

1:01:53.320 --> 1:01:54.880
 less likely to be active

1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:57.620
 and circuits for feelings of wellbeing,

1:01:57.620 --> 1:02:01.420
 but also motivation to be much more active.

1:02:01.420 --> 1:02:03.140
 I find that remarkable and important

1:02:03.140 --> 1:02:04.620
 because a number of people

1:02:04.620 --> 1:02:06.280
 struggle with issues of motivation.

1:02:06.280 --> 1:02:08.500
 A lot of people who are highly motivated

1:02:08.500 --> 1:02:10.720
 also have issues with anxiety and fear.

1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:13.320
 And so this study really points to the fact

1:02:13.320 --> 1:02:14.320
 that it's a twofer.

1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:16.040
 If you have a good gratitude practice

1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:17.900
 and you repeat it regularly,

1:02:17.900 --> 1:02:20.760
 you reduce the fear anxiety circuits,

1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:25.760
 you increase the efficacy of the positive emotion,

1:02:25.760 --> 1:02:28.480
 feel good circuits and the circuits associated

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:31.540
 with motivation and pursuits are actually enhanced as well.

1:02:31.540 --> 1:02:33.340
 So that's very strong incentive

1:02:33.340 --> 1:02:36.920
 to have a gratitude practice and one that you use regularly.

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:39.320
 We'll talk about how regularly in just a moment.

1:02:40.600 --> 1:02:42.600
 I don't want to go into too many details of this study,

1:02:42.600 --> 1:02:44.440
 although we will put a reference to it if you like,

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:46.960
 it includes a lot of FMRI data,

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.480
 imaging data of different brain areas,

1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:50.720
 many, many tables and examples of matrices

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:54.820
 of before and after gratitude, after resentment, et cetera,

1:02:54.820 --> 1:02:57.160
 you do indeed have circuits in your brain for resentment,

1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:00.040
 whether you like it or not, we all do.

1:03:00.040 --> 1:03:01.560
 And some people just,

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:03.500
 those circuits are more robust than others.

1:03:03.500 --> 1:03:06.680
 But the remarkable thing is one can shift these circuits

1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:09.400
 in the direction that I think most people would like,

1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:11.600
 which is more sense of wellbeing and motivation

1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:14.800
 and less resentment and fear, literally.

1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:17.200
 And what's really cool about this study also

1:03:17.200 --> 1:03:21.800
 is that the interventions are only five minutes long.

1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:24.440
 It's incredible, five minutes long.

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:26.760
 And so as we start to build out

1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:29.280
 our ideal gratitude practice,

1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:31.220
 we know that it has to have certain features.

1:03:31.220 --> 1:03:34.240
 First of all, it has to be grounded in a story,

1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:36.520
 probably a story that you've heard in its entirety

1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:39.880
 at least once, but then you can have a shorthand version,

1:03:39.880 --> 1:03:41.980
 the so-called bullet points that I talked about before

1:03:41.980 --> 1:03:44.760
 that allow you to drop into that story

1:03:44.760 --> 1:03:46.880
 or the emotional associations with that story.

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:49.000
 So you don't have to listen to the whole story each time.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:52.020
 And that story should be one in which you are genuinely

1:03:52.020 --> 1:03:54.760
 being thanked for something and it made you feel good.

1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:57.480
 Or it could be a story about someone else

1:03:57.480 --> 1:03:59.640
 genuinely expressing thanks, okay?

1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:03.240
 Based on the description of the gratitude practices

1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:04.680
 that we talked about earlier.

1:04:05.740 --> 1:04:08.320
 Your gratitude practice can be very brief.

1:04:08.320 --> 1:04:11.300
 I mean, it can be as brief as one minute, 60 seconds

1:04:11.300 --> 1:04:13.840
 or five minutes, which still seems very brief to me.

1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:15.080
 Although in these studies,

1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:17.300
 they were getting these really major effects

1:04:17.300 --> 1:04:20.380
 just from five minutes of gratitude practice.

1:04:20.380 --> 1:04:25.380
 Some of these papers involve people doing some focusing

1:04:25.520 --> 1:04:28.280
 on their breathing and calming themselves

1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:29.960
 as they go into the gratitude practice,

1:04:29.960 --> 1:04:32.040
 but that's within the five-minute block.

1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:34.180
 So if you decide that you're going to do

1:04:34.180 --> 1:04:36.280
 a gratitude practice that involves first,

1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:38.760
 doing some calming breathing,

1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:40.660
 exhale-emphasized breathing, for instance,

1:04:40.660 --> 1:04:41.840
 or physiological sighs,

1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:43.540
 things I've talked about before on this podcast

1:04:43.540 --> 1:04:44.480
 that can help calm you down

1:04:44.480 --> 1:04:45.760
 because they have a lot of exhales,

1:04:45.760 --> 1:04:47.640
 which you now know slows your heart rate down,

1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:50.820
 and then doing your gratitude practice, that's fine.

1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:52.260
 It's actually not necessary,

1:04:52.260 --> 1:04:54.800
 but a lot of these studies used that.

1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:57.680
 I think once a narrative has been set,

1:04:57.680 --> 1:04:59.760
 you've heard the story and it has meaning for you,

1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:01.720
 or you have a recollection of a story

1:05:01.720 --> 1:05:03.220
 where you are genuinely thanked,

1:05:03.220 --> 1:05:05.680
 then I think just 60 seconds

1:05:05.680 --> 1:05:09.160
 or maybe 120 seconds should be sufficient.

1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:10.500
 Then the question becomes how often

1:05:10.500 --> 1:05:12.200
 to repeat this gratitude practice.

1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:17.240
 That's not exactly clear from the existing literature.

1:05:17.240 --> 1:05:19.760
 I can't point to any one study that says five times a week

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:20.600
 or four times a week.

1:05:20.600 --> 1:05:22.760
 So I'm going to throw out a number,

1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:24.560
 which is three times a week,

1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:26.220
 and then people will ask,

1:05:26.220 --> 1:05:28.420
 well, when should I do that gratitude practice?

1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:31.600
 And I'll tell you what I tell most everybody

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:33.960
 about most every practice with a few exceptions,

1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:36.880
 which is the best time of day to do this practice

1:05:36.880 --> 1:05:39.600
 is when you first wake up in the morning

1:05:39.600 --> 1:05:42.880
 or before you go to sleep at night or any time of day.

1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:45.400
 So we've talked about some of the neural circuitry changes

1:05:45.400 --> 1:05:48.320
 associated with a regular gratitude practice.

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:50.760
 And I should mention that there's an additional

1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:53.360
 neural circuitry shift that occurs.

1:05:53.360 --> 1:05:55.040
 It relates to a structure that I mentioned

1:05:55.040 --> 1:05:57.720
 just briefly earlier, which is the so-called ACC

1:05:57.720 --> 1:05:59.500
 or anterior cingulate cortex.

1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:02.000
 This is an area of the brain that has several functions,

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:03.960
 but more and more data are pointing to the fact

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:07.640
 that the ACC is actually involved in empathy

1:06:07.640 --> 1:06:10.700
 and is involved in understanding the emotional states

1:06:10.700 --> 1:06:11.760
 of others in general,

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:13.920
 even if it doesn't invoke a sense of empathy.

1:06:13.920 --> 1:06:17.000
 And there are several studies that point to the fact

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:19.760
 that in humans who have a regular gratitude practice,

1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:23.200
 the ACC becomes more robustly engaged,

1:06:23.200 --> 1:06:25.400
 even with these very brief gratitude practices.

1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:27.600
 We actually have a project in our lab.

1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:31.560
 This is actually done in animal models

1:06:31.560 --> 1:06:33.400
 where animals observe other animals

1:06:33.400 --> 1:06:37.200
 experiencing certain emotional states.

1:06:37.200 --> 1:06:39.520
 And one of the brain areas that we've identified

1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:41.400
 as important for this,

1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:43.600
 it's kind of a primordial form of empathy

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:46.440
 because we really don't know what these mice are thinking.

1:06:46.440 --> 1:06:47.520
 We work on humans.

1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:49.400
 In the case where we work on humans, of course,

1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:50.880
 we ask them and they tell us

1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:52.960
 what they think they're thinking.

1:06:52.960 --> 1:06:54.240
 With the mice, we ask them,

1:06:54.240 --> 1:06:56.020
 but they don't tell us much of anything interesting.

1:06:56.020 --> 1:06:58.600
 Instead, we measure a number of physiological signals.

1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:01.040
 But the important point is that the ACC,

1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:02.720
 the anterior cingulate cortex,

1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:04.680
 seems to be an important hub

1:07:04.680 --> 1:07:09.120
 for the generation and execution of empathy

1:07:09.120 --> 1:07:11.760
 as it relates to feelings and empathic behaviors,

1:07:11.760 --> 1:07:14.420
 altruistic behaviors of animals helping animals

1:07:14.420 --> 1:07:16.380
 and humans helping other humans.

1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:18.920
 We see this in the animal models, we see this in humans.

1:07:18.920 --> 1:07:21.820
 So if you want to be a more empathic person,

1:07:21.820 --> 1:07:24.080
 a gratitude practice is also going to be

1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:26.600
 very effective for that, it appears,

1:07:26.600 --> 1:07:29.020
 especially using this narrative type approach

1:07:29.020 --> 1:07:31.300
 where you are using someone else's narrative

1:07:31.300 --> 1:07:33.240
 of receiving gratitude

1:07:33.240 --> 1:07:36.280
 as a way to tap into your own sense of gratitude.

1:07:36.280 --> 1:07:38.920
 Thus far, we've mainly talked about the effects of gratitude

1:07:38.920 --> 1:07:41.640
 on neural circuit activation and changes

1:07:41.640 --> 1:07:43.840
 a little bit about some of the changes that are happening

1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:46.400
 in terms of the body, heart rate and breathing and so forth.

1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:48.160
 But we haven't talked a lot yet

1:07:48.160 --> 1:07:51.840
 about the changes in health metrics,

1:07:51.840 --> 1:07:55.440
 in things like inflammation or reductions in inflammation

1:07:55.440 --> 1:07:57.840
 and immunity and things of that sort.

1:07:57.840 --> 1:08:00.120
 So with that in mind, I'd like to describe the results

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:02.160
 of a really interesting recent study

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:03.160
 that was published in the journal

1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:04.720
 Brain Behavior and Immunity.

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:06.040
 This was published 2021.

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:09.580
 The title of the study is Exploring Neural Mechanisms

1:08:09.580 --> 1:08:11.700
 of the Health Benefits of Gratitude in Women,

1:08:11.700 --> 1:08:13.160
 a Randomized Control Trial.

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:15.340
 The first author is Hazlitt.

1:08:15.340 --> 1:08:18.940
 And basically what this paper showed was that

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.520
 women who had a regular gratitude practice

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:26.280
 of the sort that we've been talking about up until now

1:08:26.280 --> 1:08:29.880
 showed reductions in amygdala activity,

1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:32.280
 a brain area associated with threat detection,

1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:34.760
 a intimate part of the fear network in the brain.

1:08:34.760 --> 1:08:38.160
 So reductions in amygdala activation

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:42.780
 and large reductions in the production

1:08:42.780 --> 1:08:44.480
 of something called TNF alpha,

1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:48.460
 tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6, interleukin-6.

1:08:48.460 --> 1:08:50.380
 Now, if you happen to have listened to the episode

1:08:50.380 --> 1:08:53.560
 that I did on activating your immune system

1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:57.640
 and immune function, you heard about TNF alpha and IL-6.

1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:01.120
 TNF alpha and IL-6 are inflammatory cytokines.

1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:03.840
 These are chemicals that exist in your body

1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:06.840
 and that are released from cells

1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:10.900
 when there is damage or kind of a systemic stress

1:09:10.900 --> 1:09:13.120
 when your system is in duress.

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:15.160
 And in the short term, they can be beneficial.

1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:17.340
 They can call in signals for wound healing

1:09:17.340 --> 1:09:19.140
 and repair of cells, et cetera.

1:09:19.140 --> 1:09:22.920
 But you don't want TNF alpha and IL-6 levels to be too high

1:09:22.920 --> 1:09:26.200
 and you don't want those levels to be up for too long.

1:09:26.200 --> 1:09:28.080
 And so this study is really nice

1:09:28.080 --> 1:09:30.000
 because they showed significant effects

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.840
 in reducing TNF alpha and IL-6

1:09:32.840 --> 1:09:36.200
 in response to a gratitude practice.

1:09:36.200 --> 1:09:38.560
 And because they also observed reductions

1:09:38.560 --> 1:09:40.240
 in amygdala activation,

1:09:41.360 --> 1:09:44.260
 this area associated with threat detection and fear,

1:09:44.260 --> 1:09:47.240
 it's likely, and I should emphasize likely

1:09:47.240 --> 1:09:49.780
 because I don't know, that the direction of the effect

1:09:49.780 --> 1:09:51.240
 is that there are neural circuit changes

1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:54.120
 which in turn shift the degree

1:09:54.120 --> 1:09:55.840
 to which these inflammatory cytokines

1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:56.720
 are released in the body.

1:09:56.720 --> 1:09:59.600
 Although for all I know, it could be the other way too.

1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:02.040
 It could be that having a gratitude practice

1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:03.880
 shifts something about heart rate and breathing,

1:10:03.880 --> 1:10:07.480
 which in turn shifts or lowers the amount of TNF alpha

1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:10.480
 and IL-6 and that in turn reduces activation of the amygdala.

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:12.960
 We don't really know the direction of the effect,

1:10:12.960 --> 1:10:14.640
 excuse me, but if I had to speculate,

1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:17.320
 I would speculate that it was a shift in neural circuitry

1:10:17.320 --> 1:10:20.980
 that led to a change in the circuits of the body.

1:10:20.980 --> 1:10:23.000
 And another interesting aspect of this study

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.920
 is that the reductions in amygdala activation

1:10:25.920 --> 1:10:29.740
 and the reductions in TNF alpha and IL-6 were very rapid.

1:10:29.740 --> 1:10:31.940
 They occurred almost immediately

1:10:31.940 --> 1:10:35.000
 after the gratitude practice was completed.

1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:36.640
 And even though that study was performed

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:38.960
 exclusively on female subjects,

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:41.920
 based on the biology and circuitry of the amygdala

1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:45.280
 and the biology of TNF alpha and IL-6

1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:49.360
 performing this inflammatory role in both men and women,

1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:51.440
 I don't see any reason why the results of that study

1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:54.200
 wouldn't pertain to both men and women.

1:10:54.200 --> 1:10:57.040
 So what about the chemistry associated with gratitude?

1:10:57.040 --> 1:10:58.560
 Are there certain chemicals in our brain

1:10:58.560 --> 1:11:00.560
 or that we could enhance in our brain

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:03.020
 that would enhance our gratitude practice?

1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:04.880
 Indeed, there are.

1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:08.280
 And earlier I mentioned the chemical, the neuromodulator,

1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:10.960
 serotonin, as having a powerful influence

1:11:10.960 --> 1:11:12.500
 on the activation of neural circuits

1:11:12.500 --> 1:11:15.460
 associated with prosocial behaviors and gratitude

1:11:15.460 --> 1:11:18.600
 and other sort of feel-good behaviors.

1:11:18.600 --> 1:11:20.060
 To make a long story short,

1:11:20.060 --> 1:11:22.800
 neuromodulators like dopamine and epinephrine

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:24.800
 and norepinephrine tend to place us

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:27.920
 into a state of exteroception,

1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:31.360
 meaning a state of observing things and focusing on things

1:11:31.360 --> 1:11:34.160
 outside the immediate reach of our body

1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:35.220
 and confines of our skin.

1:11:35.220 --> 1:11:37.200
 They tend to put us in pursuit

1:11:37.200 --> 1:11:39.680
 or in thinking about things out in the future

1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:42.140
 or out away from our physical body.

1:11:43.120 --> 1:11:45.300
 Whereas the neuromodulator serotonin

1:11:45.300 --> 1:11:47.360
 and some of the associated pathways

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:51.360
 like oxytocin and other neurochemicals tend to,

1:11:51.360 --> 1:11:53.460
 I want to emphasize, tend to be associated

1:11:53.460 --> 1:11:56.280
 with states that are about contentment

1:11:56.280 --> 1:11:58.840
 with what we have within the confines of our body

1:11:58.840 --> 1:12:00.440
 and our immediate experience.

1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:02.080
 So they're not so much about pursuit,

1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:04.720
 but about gratitude and about appreciation

1:12:04.720 --> 1:12:06.740
 for what we already have.

1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:11.080
 I'd be remiss if I didn't therefore point out

1:12:11.080 --> 1:12:14.500
 that if one were to shift their chemistry

1:12:14.500 --> 1:12:17.080
 toward having higher levels of serotonin,

1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:19.940
 you would, by all logic,

1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:22.280
 experience heightened levels of gratitude.

1:12:22.280 --> 1:12:23.560
 And indeed, some people do this.

1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:25.800
 They will take compounds that increase serotonin.

1:12:25.800 --> 1:12:27.480
 There are a number of compounds out there.

1:12:27.480 --> 1:12:29.880
 As you know, I'm certainly not suggesting people do that.

1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:31.800
 A couple of the supplement-based

1:12:31.800 --> 1:12:34.620
 legal over-the-counter approaches to this

1:12:34.620 --> 1:12:39.520
 are things like 5-HTP, which is a precursor to serotonin.

1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:42.520
 Some people will take 5-HTP to try and enhance their sleep.

1:12:42.520 --> 1:12:45.640
 I'm not a fan of doing that personally.

1:12:45.640 --> 1:12:47.240
 I've talked about this in the sleep episodes,

1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:52.240
 but the state that we call sleep has a very complex

1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:55.640
 and important architecture as it relates to neurochemicals.

1:12:55.640 --> 1:12:58.180
 And by taking serotonin by supplement

1:12:58.180 --> 1:13:00.500
 or by stimulating serotonin release by supplement

1:13:00.500 --> 1:13:02.560
 with 5-HTP or with tryptophan,

1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:05.940
 which is an amino acid precursor to serotonin,

1:13:05.940 --> 1:13:07.360
 one can run into the problem

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:10.320
 of disrupting the normal architecture of sleep cycles

1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:11.160
 throughout the night.

1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:14.160
 I experienced that as if I've taken 5-HTP or tryptophan,

1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:15.320
 I fall asleep very deeply,

1:13:15.320 --> 1:13:16.960
 but then I wake up three hours later

1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:18.520
 and I can't fall asleep at all.

1:13:18.520 --> 1:13:20.500
 And actually it sometimes even messes up my sleep

1:13:20.500 --> 1:13:21.800
 the subsequent night.

1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:24.480
 Some people are not so sensitive to 5-HTP and tryptophan

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:25.560
 and they actually really like it.

1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.560
 So again, you have to talk to your doctor,

1:13:27.560 --> 1:13:28.600
 decide what's right for you,

1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:30.400
 you're responsible for your health, not me,

1:13:30.400 --> 1:13:31.920
 and you have to determine what works for you.

1:13:31.920 --> 1:13:33.500
 Everyone's slightly individual.

1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:38.500
 But one could imagine enhancing their amount of serotonin

1:13:38.800 --> 1:13:42.680
 in their brain and body by taking 5-HTP or tryptophan

1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:44.000
 before gratitude practice.

1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:45.320
 That seems a little bit extreme

1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:47.400
 given that the gratitude practice is only about a minute

1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:49.180
 to five minutes long on a regular basis.

1:13:49.180 --> 1:13:51.480
 But there may be instances in which you're really trying

1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:54.280
 to amplify these circuitry in the brain and body

1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:55.960
 that are associated with gratitude.

1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:57.360
 And therefore that might be something

1:13:57.360 --> 1:13:58.960
 that you want to explore.

1:13:58.960 --> 1:14:01.180
 There's a new compound that's out there,

1:14:01.180 --> 1:14:04.000
 a legal over-the-counter compound.

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:06.180
 At least it's legal in the United States.

1:14:06.180 --> 1:14:07.640
 I don't know about overseas.

1:14:07.640 --> 1:14:12.640
 And that's a compound called KANA, K-A-N-N-A.

1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:14.200
 It's an interesting compound.

1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:16.920
 It goes by another name as well, which is,

1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:19.200
 and I'm going to mispronounce this and I apologize.

1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:22.120
 This is selecium tortosum.

1:14:22.120 --> 1:14:24.600
 Please see our timestamps if you want to see the spelling

1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:28.320
 of that, but I'll just call it KANA

1:14:28.320 --> 1:14:29.320
 by its other name for short.

1:14:29.320 --> 1:14:33.500
 It's an herb that is traditionally chewed

1:14:33.500 --> 1:14:35.320
 prior to stressing endeavors,

1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:37.280
 is how it's described on examine.com.

1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:38.880
 But I looked at some of the studies on this.

1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:39.720
 It's kind of interesting.

1:14:39.720 --> 1:14:43.220
 It very likely increases the amount of serotonin in the body

1:14:43.220 --> 1:14:44.440
 and pretty potently.

1:14:45.360 --> 1:14:48.040
 It is generally taken in dosages

1:14:48.040 --> 1:14:50.520
 of anywhere from 25 to 50 milligrams.

1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:55.520
 And it creates a kind of a pro-social gratitude enhancing,

1:14:56.580 --> 1:14:58.840
 or I should say gratitude circuitry,

1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:03.100
 pro-social neural circuitry enhancing effect

1:15:03.100 --> 1:15:05.180
 because of the ways that it interacts

1:15:05.180 --> 1:15:08.360
 with the serotonergic pathways of the brain.

1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:10.240
 So it also has another name.

1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:13.840
 It's sometimes called the zembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N.

1:15:13.840 --> 1:15:15.520
 Again, I'm not suggesting that people run out

1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:19.160
 and take this stuff, but there is an emerging practice

1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:22.240
 of people using zembrin,

1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:26.640
 salicium tortosium, also called KANA, K-A-N-N-A,

1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:28.440
 in order to enhance these states

1:15:28.440 --> 1:15:32.240
 that are about comfort and pleasure

1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:36.160
 with what one has in their immediate sphere of experience.

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:39.160
 And so one could imagine if it's safe for you

1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:42.260
 and right for you and legal where you live,

1:15:42.260 --> 1:15:45.560
 in enhancing serotonin by taking KANA

1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:47.920
 and then doing your gratitude practice.

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:49.200
 What's the logic behind that?

1:15:49.200 --> 1:15:53.280
 Well, oftentimes we hear about supplements

1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:55.280
 and pharmacology for quote unquote,

1:15:55.280 --> 1:15:58.040
 increasing plasticity or opening plasticity.

1:15:58.040 --> 1:15:59.880
 If I had a dollar for every time someone said,

1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:02.800
 I hear that such and such opens plasticity.

1:16:02.800 --> 1:16:05.280
 Well, indeed there are molecules associated

1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:07.200
 with the thing that we call neuroplasticity,

1:16:07.200 --> 1:16:09.520
 but neuroplasticity is not an event.

1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:12.400
 It's a process, meaning it has many, many steps.

1:16:12.400 --> 1:16:13.720
 It occurs during wakefulness.

1:16:13.720 --> 1:16:15.920
 It's consolidated during sleep and so forth.

1:16:15.920 --> 1:16:19.720
 So taking a substance that increases a neurochemical

1:16:19.720 --> 1:16:22.680
 in your brain will likely,

1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:24.320
 provided it's the right substance

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:26.520
 and it's the right practice,

1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:29.300
 will likely enhance the amplitude

1:16:29.300 --> 1:16:31.280
 or the intensity of that practice

1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:34.520
 and make it a more potent form of inducing neuroplasticity,

1:16:34.520 --> 1:16:37.440
 meaning it will create longer lasting

1:16:37.440 --> 1:16:39.480
 or more robust brain changes

1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:42.000
 than if one hadn't increased their chemistry

1:16:42.000 --> 1:16:45.540
 in this way, this way of taking something.

1:16:45.540 --> 1:16:46.800
 But that doesn't necessarily mean

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:48.960
 that you couldn't get to the very same place without it

1:16:48.960 --> 1:16:52.040
 by simply doing a slightly longer gratitude practice

1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:54.720
 or putting a little bit more mental effort into it.

1:16:54.720 --> 1:16:58.960
 That said, I think the future of neuroplasticity

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:01.520
 really resides in not just one approach,

1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:04.280
 not just neurochemistry and taking substances

1:17:04.280 --> 1:17:05.760
 to increase neuroplasticity,

1:17:05.760 --> 1:17:07.460
 not just behavioral practices

1:17:07.460 --> 1:17:09.440
 to try and increase neuroplasticity,

1:17:09.440 --> 1:17:11.680
 not just brain machine interfaces

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:14.480
 or devices to increase neuroplasticity,

1:17:14.480 --> 1:17:17.280
 but rather the convergence of multiple tools.

1:17:17.280 --> 1:17:20.760
 So you could imagine enhancing serotonergic transmission,

1:17:20.760 --> 1:17:22.960
 as we say, in the brain using something like Kana

1:17:22.960 --> 1:17:25.280
 combined with a gratitude practice

1:17:25.280 --> 1:17:26.560
 in the not too distant future.

1:17:26.560 --> 1:17:27.920
 This will probably also be combined

1:17:27.920 --> 1:17:30.360
 with some sort of noninvasive device

1:17:30.360 --> 1:17:32.960
 to stimulate the prefrontal cortex at the same time.

1:17:32.960 --> 1:17:34.320
 Please don't do that recreationally.

1:17:34.320 --> 1:17:36.820
 Those devices are for clinical use only currently.

1:17:37.880 --> 1:17:39.560
 But I think you start to get the idea.

1:17:39.560 --> 1:17:41.920
 So for those of you that are a little bit more exploratory

1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:44.080
 and you want to go and do some reading on this,

1:17:44.080 --> 1:17:45.960
 I thought you might find Kana interesting.

1:17:45.960 --> 1:17:47.080
 I certainly did.

1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:49.080
 There are a number of studies that will pop up on PubMed.

1:17:49.080 --> 1:17:53.080
 I recommend using examine.com as your jumping off point.

1:17:53.080 --> 1:17:55.460
 There are some decent studies that they describe

1:17:55.460 --> 1:17:57.120
 in their so-called human effect matrix.

1:17:57.120 --> 1:17:58.720
 So those are studies done on humans.

1:17:58.720 --> 1:18:01.120
 And the main effects that have been documented

1:18:01.120 --> 1:18:03.920
 in the scientific literature are minor

1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:07.160
 but significant increases in cognition, executive function.

1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:09.500
 Executive function is something that's also associated

1:18:09.500 --> 1:18:12.040
 with prefrontal cortex and reductions in anxiety.

1:18:12.040 --> 1:18:14.120
 And that seems to be a common theme that we're seeing

1:18:14.120 --> 1:18:15.360
 again and again.

1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:19.340
 You saw this in the study, the trial where we saw reductions

1:18:19.340 --> 1:18:22.440
 in TNF alpha and reductions in amygdala activation.

1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:26.920
 So which would ostensibly lead to reductions in anxiety.

1:18:26.920 --> 1:18:29.760
 You're seeing increases in activity and brain networks

1:18:29.760 --> 1:18:31.460
 that are associated with feelings of wellbeing.

1:18:31.460 --> 1:18:33.840
 So again, back to that kind of push-pull

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:37.200
 of defensive anxiety and fear-like circuitry in the brain

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:39.840
 being antagonistic, as we say,

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:41.960
 to the circuits that are associated with pro-social,

1:18:41.960 --> 1:18:45.500
 feeling good, receiving good feelings type circuitry

1:18:45.500 --> 1:18:47.040
 and events in life.

1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:49.340
 So as you now know, there is a lot of science

1:18:49.340 --> 1:18:52.600
 about how gratitude can positively impact neural circuits

1:18:52.600 --> 1:18:56.080
 in the brain, anti-inflammatory markers in the body,

1:18:56.080 --> 1:18:58.880
 brain, heart, breathing coordination,

1:18:58.880 --> 1:19:00.040
 and on and on and on.

1:19:01.000 --> 1:19:03.220
 I'd like to just highlight the key elements

1:19:03.220 --> 1:19:06.080
 of the most effective, at least to my knowledge,

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:07.520
 gratitude practice.

1:19:07.520 --> 1:19:09.120
 And when I say the most effective,

1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:11.840
 what I'm doing is I'm gleaning from the scientific studies

1:19:11.840 --> 1:19:15.200
 I was able to find and combining the various findings

1:19:15.200 --> 1:19:18.700
 of those studies into what I think is a very practical

1:19:18.700 --> 1:19:21.400
 and what should certainly be a very effective

1:19:21.400 --> 1:19:23.620
 gratitude practice for all the positive effects

1:19:23.620 --> 1:19:25.140
 that we described.

1:19:25.140 --> 1:19:28.620
 First of all, that gratitude practice has to be grounded

1:19:28.620 --> 1:19:31.320
 in a narrative, meaning a story.

1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:33.840
 You don't have to recite or hear that story

1:19:33.840 --> 1:19:37.000
 every single time you do the gratitude practice,

1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.200
 but you have to know what that story was

1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:42.920
 and what the gratitude practice references back to.

1:19:42.920 --> 1:19:45.800
 Second of all, that story can be one

1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:50.040
 of you receiving genuine thanks.

1:19:50.040 --> 1:19:52.560
 And the key elements there are that you are the one

1:19:52.560 --> 1:19:54.560
 receiving the thanks, the gratitude,

1:19:54.560 --> 1:19:59.480
 and that it's being given to you genuinely, wholeheartedly.

1:20:00.840 --> 1:20:05.440
 Or it can be a story of you observing someone else

1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:08.840
 receiving thanks or expressing thanks.

1:20:08.840 --> 1:20:11.720
 And that has to be a genuine interaction as well,

1:20:11.720 --> 1:20:14.800
 both between the giver and the receiver.

1:20:15.640 --> 1:20:18.380
 So those are the first three elements.

1:20:18.380 --> 1:20:21.600
 What I recommend would be after you've established

1:20:21.600 --> 1:20:24.920
 the story that you want to use for your gratitude practice,

1:20:24.920 --> 1:20:28.120
 that you write down three or four simple bullet points

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:31.760
 that can serve as salient reminders of that story for you.

1:20:31.760 --> 1:20:34.200
 It will serve as kind of a cue for that story

1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:39.200
 without having to listen to or talk out the entire story.

1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:43.040
 I would recommend writing down something about the state

1:20:43.040 --> 1:20:44.720
 that you or the other person were in

1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:47.020
 before they received the gratitude,

1:20:47.020 --> 1:20:50.080
 the state that you were in or that the person was in

1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:52.000
 after they received the gratitude,

1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.480
 and any other elements that lend

1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:57.380
 some sort of emotional weight or tone to the story.

1:20:57.380 --> 1:20:59.840
 This could be three pages of text if you like,

1:20:59.840 --> 1:21:02.280
 or it could just be a couple of bullet points.

1:21:02.280 --> 1:21:03.360
 I don't think it really matters.

1:21:03.360 --> 1:21:05.460
 The important thing is that it's embedded in your memory

1:21:05.460 --> 1:21:06.560
 and that it's really associated

1:21:06.560 --> 1:21:09.040
 with this genuine exchange of thanks

1:21:09.040 --> 1:21:10.920
 and the receival of thanks.

1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:12.640
 I think those are the key elements.

1:21:12.640 --> 1:21:13.600
 And then it's very simple.

1:21:13.600 --> 1:21:17.520
 The entire practice involves reading off these bullet points

1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:22.520
 as a cue to your nervous system of the sense of gratitude.

1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:25.280
 And then for about one minute,

1:21:25.280 --> 1:21:26.820
 which is a trivial amount of time

1:21:26.820 --> 1:21:29.580
 if you really think about it, or maybe two minutes,

1:21:29.580 --> 1:21:31.640
 or if you're really ambitious up to five minutes

1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:35.400
 of just really feeling into that genuine experience

1:21:35.400 --> 1:21:36.760
 of having received gratitude

1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:40.960
 or observed someone else receiving gratitude.

1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:43.320
 And then in terms of frequency,

1:21:43.320 --> 1:21:46.000
 I think a good rule of thumb would be to do that

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:47.340
 about three times a week.

1:21:47.340 --> 1:21:49.760
 And the time of day doesn't really matter.

1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:51.280
 I can't see why there would be

1:21:51.280 --> 1:21:53.160
 any so-called circadian effects of this.

1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:55.000
 I know some people like to do a gratitude practice

1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:56.720
 before they go to sleep at night.

1:21:56.720 --> 1:21:58.480
 I don't see any problem with doing this

1:21:58.480 --> 1:21:59.500
 before you go to sleep at night.

1:21:59.500 --> 1:22:01.320
 I also don't see any problem with you doing this

1:22:01.320 --> 1:22:03.360
 on your lunch break or mid-morning

1:22:03.360 --> 1:22:04.420
 or first thing in the morning.

1:22:04.420 --> 1:22:07.040
 I can't see any logic for placing it

1:22:07.040 --> 1:22:09.660
 any one time of day and not another.

1:22:09.660 --> 1:22:10.680
 So I think the most important thing

1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:13.400
 is that you do it at least three times a week.

1:22:13.400 --> 1:22:15.760
 And as mentioned before, it's very, very brief.

1:22:15.760 --> 1:22:19.360
 So there are very few barriers to entry for doing this.

1:22:19.360 --> 1:22:22.000
 So if we just take a step back from this protocol

1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.120
 and compare it to what's typically out there

1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:26.520
 in the literature, which is,

1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:28.400
 make a list of all the things you're thankful for,

1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:31.000
 recite in your mind all the things you're thankful for,

1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:31.840
 count your blessings.

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:32.840
 So I think everybody should be

1:22:32.840 --> 1:22:34.000
 counting their blessings all the time.

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:35.880
 There's always something to be thankful for.

1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:38.800
 But in terms of a scientifically grounded

1:22:38.800 --> 1:22:43.040
 gratitude practice that is also scientifically demonstrated

1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:47.000
 to shift your physiology at the level of your immune system

1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.580
 and your neural circuitry, reducing anxiety,

1:22:49.580 --> 1:22:52.180
 increasing motivation, all these wonderful things

1:22:52.180 --> 1:22:55.860
 that so many of us are chasing all the time as goals,

1:22:55.860 --> 1:22:58.400
 I think a gratitude practice reveals itself

1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:02.120
 to be an immensely powerful tool for any and all of us

1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:04.500
 to use, and that should come as no surprise

1:23:04.500 --> 1:23:05.940
 because these pro-social circuits,

1:23:05.940 --> 1:23:09.760
 these circuits for gratitude are not a recent phenomenon.

1:23:09.760 --> 1:23:12.480
 Discussions about gratitude date back hundreds,

1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:14.040
 if not thousands of years.

1:23:14.040 --> 1:23:16.160
 What we've done today is to take the modern science

1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:20.360
 right up until 2021 and to really distill from that

1:23:20.360 --> 1:23:22.880
 the neuroimaging data, the neurochemistry,

1:23:22.880 --> 1:23:25.360
 the various aspects of brain-body connectivity,

1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:27.920
 look at the protocols, take various subject groups,

1:23:27.920 --> 1:23:29.360
 some were done in women, some were done

1:23:29.360 --> 1:23:31.040
 in between two individuals, some were done

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:36.040
 with brain imaging, all the various changes on a theme

1:23:37.040 --> 1:23:39.680
 that allow us to point to a simple

1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:42.920
 but very effective protocol that certainly we could all use

1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:47.440
 around Thanksgiving, but Thanksgiving is just but one day

1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:49.400
 throughout the entire year, of course.

1:23:49.400 --> 1:23:51.840
 I personally have been using a gratitude protocol

1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:55.120
 for the last several years, but that protocol was based

1:23:55.120 --> 1:23:59.280
 on my ignorance really about the scientific literature

1:23:59.280 --> 1:24:02.120
 and was mainly based on what I'd heard out there

1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:05.240
 on the internet, which is that I should list out

1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:08.640
 or think about or verbally recite the things

1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:09.760
 that I'm grateful for.

1:24:10.640 --> 1:24:12.700
 The sort of protocol that we arrived at today

1:24:12.700 --> 1:24:14.460
 based on the scientific literature

1:24:14.460 --> 1:24:16.420
 is distinctly different from that.

1:24:16.420 --> 1:24:19.720
 And as a consequence, I've started to script out

1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:22.680
 a protocol identical to the one I just described,

1:24:22.680 --> 1:24:24.760
 and I intend to use that going forward.

1:24:54.400 --> 1:24:56.840
 During today's episode and in many previous episodes,

1:24:56.840 --> 1:24:58.080
 I mentioned supplements.

1:24:58.080 --> 1:24:59.300
 Supplements aren't for everybody,

1:24:59.300 --> 1:25:00.900
 but if you are going to use supplements,

1:25:00.900 --> 1:25:02.380
 it's imperative that those supplements

1:25:02.380 --> 1:25:03.920
 be of the very highest quality.

1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:05.920
 For that reason, we partnered with Thorne,

1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:08.800
 that's T-H-O-R-I-N-E, because Thorne supplements

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:10.720
 have the highest levels of stringency

1:25:10.720 --> 1:25:13.440
 in terms of the quality of the ingredients they include

1:25:13.440 --> 1:25:15.600
 and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients

1:25:15.600 --> 1:25:17.600
 they include in their products.

1:25:17.600 --> 1:25:19.420
 They partnered with every major sports team

1:25:19.420 --> 1:25:20.500
 as well as the Mayo Clinic,

1:25:20.500 --> 1:25:22.660
 so we're delighted to be partnered with them as well.

1:25:22.660 --> 1:25:24.300
