00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.280 --> 00:12.000
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.000 --> 00:15.020
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.020 --> 00:17.440
 Today, my guest is Dr. David Anderson.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.400
 Dr. Anderson is a professor of biology

00:19.400 --> 00:21.960
 at the California Institute of Technology,

00:21.960 --> 00:25.440
 often commonly referred to as Caltech University.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.080
 Dr. Anderson's research focuses on emotions

00:28.080 --> 00:30.000
 and states of mind and body.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.840
 And indeed, he emphasizes how emotions

00:31.840 --> 00:34.560
 like happiness, sadness, anger, and so on

00:34.560 --> 00:36.280
 are actually subcategories

00:36.280 --> 00:39.360
 of what are generally governed by states,

00:39.360 --> 00:42.120
 that is, things that are occurring in the nervous system

00:42.120 --> 00:45.760
 in our brain and in the connections between brain and body

00:45.760 --> 00:47.500
 that dictate whether or not we feel good

00:47.500 --> 00:50.660
 about how we are feeling and that drive our behaviors,

00:50.660 --> 00:54.520
 that is, bias us to be in action or inaction

00:54.520 --> 00:57.500
 and strongly influence the way we interpret our experience

00:57.500 --> 00:58.680
 and our surroundings.

00:58.680 --> 01:01.160
 Today, Dr. Anderson teaches us, for instance,

01:01.160 --> 01:02.680
 why people become aggressive

01:02.680 --> 01:06.900
 and why that aggression can sometimes take the form of rage.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.900
 I also talk about sexual behavior

01:08.900 --> 01:11.260
 and the boundaries and overlap

01:11.260 --> 01:13.640
 between aggression and sexual behavior.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.600
 And that discussion about aggression and sexual behavior

01:16.600 --> 01:19.120
 also starts to focus on particular aspects

01:19.120 --> 01:21.360
 of neural circuits and states of mind and body

01:21.360 --> 01:24.800
 that govern things like, for instance, male-male aggression

01:24.800 --> 01:28.760
 versus male-female aggression versus female-female aggression.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.040
 So today, you will learn a lot

01:30.040 --> 01:31.480
 about the biological mechanisms

01:31.480 --> 01:33.880
 that govern why we feel the way we feel.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.840
 Indeed, Dr. Anderson is an author

01:35.840 --> 01:38.320
 of a terrific new popular book entitled

01:38.320 --> 01:41.000
 "'The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.'"

01:41.000 --> 01:43.200
 I've read this book several times now.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.040
 I can tell you it contains so many gems

01:45.040 --> 01:47.520
 that are firmly grounded in the scientific research.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.520
 In fact, a lot of what's in the book

01:49.520 --> 01:51.660
 contrasts with many of the common myths

01:51.660 --> 01:53.900
 about emotions and biology.

01:53.900 --> 01:56.520
 So whether or not you're a therapist or you're a biologist

01:56.520 --> 01:58.500
 or you're simply just somebody interested

01:58.500 --> 02:00.200
 in why we feel the way we feel

02:00.200 --> 02:02.120
 and why we act the way we act,

02:02.120 --> 02:03.920
 I cannot recommend the book highly enough.

02:03.920 --> 02:04.740
 Again, the title is,

02:04.740 --> 02:07.220
 "'The Nature of the Beast, How Emotions Guide Us.'"

02:07.220 --> 02:09.480
 Today's discussion also ventures into topics

02:09.480 --> 02:12.120
 such as mental health and mental illness.

02:12.120 --> 02:13.940
 And some of the exciting discoveries

02:13.940 --> 02:15.760
 that have been made by Dr. Anderson's laboratory

02:15.760 --> 02:18.600
 and other laboratories identifying specific peptides,

02:18.600 --> 02:21.200
 that is, small proteins that can govern

02:21.200 --> 02:23.680
 whether or not people feel anxious or less anxious,

02:23.680 --> 02:25.360
 aggressive or less aggressive.

02:25.360 --> 02:27.140
 This is an important area of research

02:27.140 --> 02:28.480
 that has direct implications

02:28.480 --> 02:30.560
 for much of what we read about in the news,

02:30.560 --> 02:33.080
 both unfortunate and fortunate events,

02:33.080 --> 02:35.080
 and that will no doubt drive

02:35.080 --> 02:37.060
 the future of mental health treatments.

02:37.060 --> 02:40.600
 Dr. Anderson is considered one of the most pioneering

02:40.600 --> 02:43.840
 and important researchers in neurobiology of our time.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.940
 Indeed, he is a member of the National Academy of Sciences

02:45.940 --> 02:49.120
 and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.440
 I've mentioned the HHMI once or twice before

02:51.440 --> 02:54.440
 when we've had other HHMI guests on this podcast,

02:54.440 --> 02:55.880
 but for those of you that are not familiar,

02:55.880 --> 02:57.200
 the Howard Hughes Medical Institute

02:57.200 --> 02:59.380
 funds a small number of investigators

02:59.380 --> 03:02.800
 doing particularly high-risk, high-benefit work,

03:02.800 --> 03:05.580
 and it is an extremely competitive process

03:05.580 --> 03:08.800
 to identify those Howard Hughes investigators.

03:08.800 --> 03:09.760
 They're essentially appointed,

03:09.760 --> 03:11.540
 and then every five years,

03:11.540 --> 03:13.720
 they have to compete against one another

03:13.720 --> 03:16.080
 and against a new incoming flock

03:16.080 --> 03:18.680
 of would-be HHMI investigators

03:18.680 --> 03:19.920
 to get another five years of funding.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.100
 They are literally given a grade every five years

03:22.100 --> 03:24.580
 as to whether or not they can continue, not continue,

03:24.580 --> 03:27.120
 or whether or not they should worry about being funded

03:27.120 --> 03:28.540
 for an extended period of time.

03:28.540 --> 03:30.300
 Dr. Anderson has been an investigator

03:30.300 --> 03:33.860
 with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute since 1989.

03:33.860 --> 03:35.740
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:35.740 --> 03:38.080
 is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.

03:38.080 --> 03:40.280
 We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.

03:40.280 --> 03:42.000
 First of all, they ship internationally

03:42.000 --> 03:43.900
 because we know that many of you are located

03:43.900 --> 03:45.400
 outside of the United States.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.420
 Second of all, and perhaps most important,

03:47.420 --> 03:49.960
 the quality of their supplements is second to none,

03:49.960 --> 03:51.640
 both in terms of purity and precision

03:51.640 --> 03:53.580
 of the amounts of the ingredients.

03:53.580 --> 03:56.200
 Third, we've really emphasized supplements

03:56.200 --> 03:58.400
 that are single-ingredient supplements

03:58.400 --> 04:00.480
 and that are supplied in dosages

04:00.480 --> 04:03.440
 that allow you to build a supplementation protocol

04:03.440 --> 04:05.280
 that's optimized for cost,

04:05.280 --> 04:07.160
 that's optimized for effectiveness,

04:07.160 --> 04:09.300
 and that you can add things and remove things

04:09.300 --> 04:10.640
 from your protocol in a way

04:10.640 --> 04:12.400
 that's really systematic and scientific.

04:12.400 --> 04:13.600
 If you'd like to see the supplements

04:13.600 --> 04:14.920
 that we partner with Momentus on,

04:14.920 --> 04:18.020
 you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

04:18.020 --> 04:19.160
 There you'll see those supplements,

04:19.160 --> 04:21.600
 and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding

04:21.600 --> 04:24.320
 the library of supplements available through Momentus

04:24.320 --> 04:25.240
 on a regular basis.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.840
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

04:27.840 --> 04:29.560
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

04:29.560 --> 04:30.840
 that this podcast is separate

04:30.840 --> 04:33.000
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.200
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:35.200 --> 04:37.080
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

04:37.080 --> 04:38.980
 about science and science-related tools

04:38.980 --> 04:40.240
 to the general public.

04:40.240 --> 04:41.320
 In keeping with that theme,

04:41.320 --> 04:44.120
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.940
 Our first sponsor is Levels.

04:45.940 --> 04:47.420
 Levels is a program that lets you see

04:47.420 --> 04:49.020
 how different foods affect your health

04:49.020 --> 04:51.040
 by giving you real-time feedback on your diet

04:51.040 --> 04:53.440
 using a continuous glucose monitor.

04:53.440 --> 04:55.080
 One of the most important factors governing

04:55.080 --> 04:56.600
 our immediate and long-term health,

04:56.600 --> 04:59.600
 and indeed our ability to think and focus clearly,

04:59.600 --> 05:01.160
 is our blood glucose levels,

05:01.160 --> 05:03.040
 also referred to as blood sugar.

05:03.040 --> 05:05.160
 To maintain healthy energy and focus throughout the day,

05:05.160 --> 05:07.120
 you want to keep your blood glucose levels steady

05:07.120 --> 05:09.500
 and avoid peaks and crashes.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.740
 I first started using Levels about a year ago

05:11.740 --> 05:12.840
 as a way to better understand

05:12.840 --> 05:15.320
 how specific foods, food combinations,

05:15.320 --> 05:18.440
 exercise, and supplements impact my blood glucose levels.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.200
 And it's been tremendously informative.

05:20.200 --> 05:21.700
 In fact, it's changed and shaped

05:21.700 --> 05:23.900
 the way that I organize my entire day.

05:23.900 --> 05:26.600
 Levels even provides a simple score after you eat a meal

05:26.600 --> 05:28.100
 so you can see how different foods affect you

05:28.100 --> 05:30.120
 and develop a personalized nutrition program

05:30.120 --> 05:31.700
 that's ideal for you.

05:31.700 --> 05:33.540
 So if you're interested in learning more about Levels

05:33.540 --> 05:35.480
 and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself,

05:35.480 --> 05:38.080
 you can go to levels.link.huberman.

05:38.080 --> 05:41.400
 That's levels.link.huberman.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.040
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.080
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

05:46.080 --> 05:47.960
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

05:47.960 --> 05:50.000
 They also have some really unique features

05:50.000 --> 05:53.520
 because they are customized to your unique sleep needs.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.360
 I've talked over and over again on this podcast

05:55.360 --> 05:56.680
 and on other podcasts,

05:56.680 --> 05:58.840
 about the fact that sleep is the foundation

05:58.840 --> 06:01.260
 of mental health, physical health, and performance.

06:01.260 --> 06:03.100
 There's just simply no other substitute

06:03.100 --> 06:05.600
 for a quality night's sleep on a regular basis.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.000
 I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress

06:07.000 --> 06:08.040
 for well over a year now,

06:08.040 --> 06:09.960
 and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.340
 And that's in large part

06:11.340 --> 06:14.080
 because the mattress was designed for me.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.080
 What you need to know, however,

06:15.080 --> 06:16.640
 is what's the ideal mattress for you?

06:16.640 --> 06:18.980
 And you can do that by going to Helix site.

06:18.980 --> 06:21.320
 You can take their brief quiz, which will ask you,

06:21.320 --> 06:22.960
 do you sleep on your side, your back, your stomach,

06:22.960 --> 06:24.580
 or maybe you don't know, or maybe all three,

06:24.580 --> 06:26.120
 do you tend to run hot or cold in the night?

06:26.120 --> 06:28.080
 Maybe you know, maybe you don't.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.080
 At the end of that short quiz,

06:29.080 --> 06:30.780
 they will match you to the ideal mattress for you.

06:30.780 --> 06:33.120
 I matched to the DUSK, the D-U-S-K mattress,

06:33.120 --> 06:34.640
 but again, that's what I need.

06:34.640 --> 06:35.800
 That's not necessarily what you need

06:35.800 --> 06:37.680
 in order to get your best night's sleep.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.200
 But if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

06:39.200 --> 06:41.480
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

06:41.480 --> 06:42.720
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

06:42.720 --> 06:44.560
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.820
 And you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order

06:47.820 --> 06:49.000
 and two free pillows.

06:49.000 --> 06:49.880
 They have terrific pillows.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.040
 And you get to try out that mattress

06:51.040 --> 06:52.240
 for a hundred nights risk-free.

06:52.240 --> 06:54.200
 They'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it,

06:54.200 --> 06:55.400
 but I'm certain you will.

06:55.400 --> 06:56.240
 Again, if you're interested in,

06:56.240 --> 06:58.680
 you go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

06:58.680 --> 07:02.160
 for up to $200 off your mattress order and two free pillows.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.640
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.280
 Element is an electrolyte drink

07:06.280 --> 07:08.700
 that has everything you need and nothing you don't,

07:08.700 --> 07:11.960
 meaning no sugar, but it has sodium, magnesium,

07:11.960 --> 07:13.720
 and potassium in the proper ratios.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.800
 Sodium, magnesium, and potassium are critical

07:15.800 --> 07:17.580
 for the functioning of all your cells,

07:17.580 --> 07:20.280
 but of your neurons, your nerve cells in particular.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.160
 Many people out there, believe it or not,

07:22.160 --> 07:25.060
 need to ingest more sodium and more potassium

07:25.060 --> 07:29.080
 and magnesium in the proper ratios to sodium and potassium.

07:29.080 --> 07:31.240
 For those of you that are pre-hypertensive or hypertensive,

07:31.240 --> 07:33.100
 you definitely don't want to crank up your sodium intake,

07:33.100 --> 07:33.980
 but many people out there,

07:33.980 --> 07:36.400
 especially people following low carb diets

07:36.400 --> 07:38.480
 or eating exceptionally clean,

07:38.480 --> 07:40.900
 very well may need more sodium.

07:40.900 --> 07:42.800
 And by drinking Element mixed with water,

07:42.800 --> 07:44.360
 which is what I do once or twice a day,

07:44.360 --> 07:47.400
 and certainly also during workouts and after workouts,

07:47.400 --> 07:49.140
 you can optimize mental functioning

07:49.140 --> 07:50.640
 and physical performance

07:50.640 --> 07:52.600
 by increasing your electrolyte balance

07:52.600 --> 07:54.700
 in the proper ratios.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.680
 If you'd like to try Element,

07:55.680 --> 07:59.920
 you can go to drink element, that's lmnt.com slash Huberman,

07:59.920 --> 08:01.940
 and you'll get a free sample pack with your order.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.300
 Again, that's drinklmnt.com slash Huberman

08:05.300 --> 08:07.400
 to get a free sample pack with your order.

08:07.400 --> 08:10.760
 And now for my discussion with Dr. David Anderson.

08:10.760 --> 08:11.840
 David, great to be here

08:11.840 --> 08:14.120
 and great to finally sit down and chat with you.

08:14.120 --> 08:14.960
 Great to be here too.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.000
 Thank you so much.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.420
 Yeah, I have a ton of questions,

08:17.420 --> 08:20.280
 but I want to start with something fairly basic,

08:20.280 --> 08:23.640
 but that I'm aware is a pretty vast landscape.

08:23.640 --> 08:27.680
 And that's the difference between emotions and states,

08:27.680 --> 08:28.960
 if indeed there is a difference,

08:28.960 --> 08:31.880
 and how we should think about emotions.

08:31.880 --> 08:33.560
 What are they?

08:33.560 --> 08:37.200
 They have all these names, happiness, sadness, depression,

08:37.200 --> 08:38.740
 anger, rage.

08:38.740 --> 08:39.960
 How should we think about them?

08:39.960 --> 08:44.520
 And why might states be at least as useful

08:44.520 --> 08:46.960
 a thing to think about, if not more useful?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.400
 That's great.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.400
 First, the short answer to your question

08:50.400 --> 08:55.400
 is that I see emotions as a type of internal state,

08:55.480 --> 08:59.200
 in the sense that arousal is also a type of internal state,

08:59.200 --> 09:01.320
 motivation's a type of internal state,

09:01.320 --> 09:04.240
 sleep is a type of internal state.

09:04.240 --> 09:08.480
 And the sort of simplest way I think of internal states

09:08.480 --> 09:10.500
 is that, as you've shown in your own work,

09:10.500 --> 09:15.360
 they change the input to output transformation of the brain.

09:15.360 --> 09:18.240
 When you're asleep, you don't hear something

09:18.240 --> 09:20.120
 that you would hear if you were awake,

09:20.120 --> 09:22.240
 unless it's a really, really loud noise.

09:22.240 --> 09:25.040
 So from that broad perspective,

09:25.040 --> 09:30.040
 I see emotion as a class of state that controls behavior.

09:30.220 --> 09:33.800
 The reason I think it's useful to think about it as a state

09:33.800 --> 09:38.800
 is it puts the focus on it as a neurobiological process,

09:39.320 --> 09:42.600
 rather than as a psychological process.

09:42.600 --> 09:46.480
 And this gets around all of the definitional problems

09:46.480 --> 09:49.560
 that people have with the word emotion,

09:49.560 --> 09:53.440
 where many people equate emotion with feeling,

09:53.440 --> 09:58.440
 which is a subjective sense that we can only study in humans

09:59.040 --> 10:01.720
 because to find out what someone's feeling,

10:01.720 --> 10:04.880
 you have to ask them, and people are the only animals

10:04.880 --> 10:07.280
 that can talk that we can understand.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.560
 So that's how I think about emotion.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.420
 It's the, if you think of an iceberg,

10:13.420 --> 10:15.600
 it's the heart of the iceberg

10:15.600 --> 10:18.080
 that's below the surface of the water.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.320
 The feeling part is the tip that's sort of floating

10:21.320 --> 10:23.720
 above the surface of your consciousness.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.780
 Not that that isn't important, it is,

10:25.780 --> 10:28.300
 but you have to understand consciousness

10:28.300 --> 10:30.400
 if you wanna understand feelings,

10:30.400 --> 10:33.840
 and we're not ready to study that in animals yet.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.480
 And so that's how I think about it.

10:36.480 --> 10:39.120
 What are the different components of a state?

10:40.160 --> 10:43.620
 You know, you mentioned arousal as a key component.

10:43.620 --> 10:45.840
 What are some of the other features of states

10:45.840 --> 10:50.280
 that represent this, as you so beautifully put in your book,

10:50.280 --> 10:52.320
 that represent below the tip of the iceberg?

10:52.320 --> 10:53.280
 Right, right.

10:53.280 --> 10:58.280
 So you can break states up

10:58.280 --> 11:03.280
 into different facets, or people would call them dimensions.

11:03.880 --> 11:08.280
 And so there have been people who've thought of emotions

11:08.280 --> 11:11.080
 as having just really two dimensions,

11:11.080 --> 11:16.080
 an arousal dimension, how intense is it,

11:16.720 --> 11:19.960
 and also a valence dimension,

11:19.960 --> 11:24.160
 which is, is it positive or negative, good or bad?

11:24.160 --> 11:28.360
 Ralph Adolphs and I have tried to expand that a little bit

11:28.360 --> 11:31.040
 to think about components of emotion,

11:31.040 --> 11:34.120
 particularly those that distinguish emotion states

11:34.120 --> 11:36.120
 from motivational states,

11:36.120 --> 11:38.620
 because they are very closely related.

11:39.640 --> 11:43.600
 One of those important properties is persistence.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.540
 And this is something that distinguishes

11:46.540 --> 11:50.360
 state-driven behaviors from simple reflexes.

11:50.360 --> 11:55.360
 Reflexes tend to terminate when the stimulus turns off,

11:55.800 --> 11:58.480
 like the doctor hitting your knee with a hammer.

11:58.480 --> 12:00.920
 It initiates with the stimulus onset,

12:00.920 --> 12:03.700
 and it terminates with the stimulus offset.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.240
 Emotions tend to outlast, often,

12:06.240 --> 12:08.400
 the stimulus that evoke them.

12:08.400 --> 12:12.540
 If you're walking along a trail here in Southern California,

12:12.540 --> 12:15.200
 you hear a rattlesnake rattling.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.940
 You're gonna jump in the air,

12:16.940 --> 12:19.280
 but your heart is gonna continue to beat,

12:19.280 --> 12:20.760
 and your palms sweat,

12:20.760 --> 12:23.320
 and your mouth is gonna be dry for a while

12:23.320 --> 12:25.480
 after it's slithered off in the bush,

12:25.480 --> 12:27.240
 and you're gonna be hypervigilant.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.520
 If you see something that even remotely

12:29.520 --> 12:33.520
 looks snake-like, a stick, you're gonna stop and jump.

12:33.520 --> 12:38.520
 So persistence is an important feature of emotion states.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.480
 Not all states have persistence.

12:42.480 --> 12:45.420
 So for example, you think about hunger.

12:45.420 --> 12:48.480
 Once you've eaten, the state is gone.

12:48.480 --> 12:50.120
 You're not hungry anymore.

12:50.120 --> 12:52.380
 But if you're really angry,

12:52.380 --> 12:54.280
 and you get into a fight with somebody,

12:54.280 --> 12:56.120
 even after the fight is over,

12:56.120 --> 13:00.080
 you may remain riled up for a long time,

13:00.080 --> 13:02.440
 and it takes you a while to calm down.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.360
 And that may have to do with the arousal dimension

13:05.360 --> 13:06.680
 or some other part of it.

13:07.520 --> 13:11.920
 And then generalization is an important component

13:11.920 --> 13:16.920
 of emotion states that make them,

13:16.920 --> 13:21.380
 if they have been triggered in one situation,

13:21.380 --> 13:24.400
 they can apply to another situation.

13:24.400 --> 13:28.120
 And my favorite example of that is you come home from work

13:28.120 --> 13:30.020
 and your kid is screaming.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.600
 If you had a good day at work,

13:31.600 --> 13:34.040
 you might pick it up and soothe it.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.960
 And if you had a bad day at work,

13:35.960 --> 13:39.280
 you might react very differently to it and scream at it.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.280
 And so that's a generalization of the state

13:42.280 --> 13:45.520
 that was triggered at work by something your boss said

13:45.520 --> 13:48.920
 to you to a completely different interaction.

13:48.920 --> 13:51.480
 And again, that's something that distinguishes

13:51.480 --> 13:54.460
 emotion states from motivation states.

13:54.460 --> 13:57.240
 Motivation states are really specific.

13:57.240 --> 14:02.240
 Find and eat food, obtain and consume water.

14:02.440 --> 14:06.960
 And they're involved in homeostatic maintenance.

14:06.960 --> 14:11.920
 So states are very multifaceted,

14:11.920 --> 14:16.920
 and just asking questions about how these components

14:17.840 --> 14:22.640
 of states are encoded, like what makes a state persist?

14:22.640 --> 14:26.320
 What gives a state a positive or a negative valence?

14:26.320 --> 14:30.240
 How do you crank up or crank down the intensity of the state?

14:30.240 --> 14:32.860
 It just opens up a whole bunch of questions

14:32.860 --> 14:35.120
 that you can ask in the brain

14:35.120 --> 14:37.160
 with the kinds of tools we have now.

14:38.480 --> 14:40.100
 You mentioned arousal a few times,

14:40.100 --> 14:42.040
 and you mentioned valence.

14:42.040 --> 14:45.640
 Realizing that there are these other aspects of states,

14:45.640 --> 14:47.820
 I'd like to just talk about arousal a little bit more

14:47.820 --> 14:50.240
 and valence, because at a very basic level,

14:50.240 --> 14:52.400
 it seems to me that arousal,

14:52.400 --> 14:55.920
 we can be very alert and pissed off,

14:55.920 --> 15:00.920
 stressed, worried, you have insomnia.

15:01.140 --> 15:03.480
 We can also be very alert and be quite happy.

15:03.480 --> 15:05.940
 So the valence flips.

15:05.940 --> 15:08.320
 We could be very, people can be sexually aroused.

15:08.320 --> 15:11.240
 People can be aroused in all sorts of ways.

15:11.240 --> 15:16.240
 Is there any simple or simple-ish neurochemical signature

15:16.480 --> 15:18.000
 that can flip valence?

15:18.000 --> 15:20.840
 So for instance, is there any way that we can safely say

15:20.840 --> 15:25.720
 that arousal with some additional dopamine release

15:25.720 --> 15:28.240
 is going to be of positive valence,

15:28.240 --> 15:31.640
 and arousal with very low dopamine

15:31.640 --> 15:33.860
 is going to be of negative valence?

15:33.860 --> 15:38.860
 I would be reluctant to say that it's a chemical flip.

15:39.340 --> 15:43.260
 I would say it's more likely to be a circuit flip,

15:43.260 --> 15:45.060
 different circuits being engaged,

15:45.060 --> 15:49.000
 and it might be that a given neurochemical, even dopamine,

15:49.000 --> 15:52.660
 is involved in both positively valenced arousal

15:52.660 --> 15:55.060
 and negatively valenced arousal.

15:55.060 --> 15:59.300
 That's why people think about these as different axes.

15:59.300 --> 16:04.300
 So I think the interesting question that you touch on is,

16:04.600 --> 16:08.000
 is arousal something that is just completely generic

16:08.000 --> 16:11.500
 in the brain, or are there actually different kinds

16:11.500 --> 16:15.340
 of arousal that are specific to different behaviors?

16:15.340 --> 16:16.460
 And you raise the question,

16:16.460 --> 16:20.320
 sexual arousal feels different from aggressive arousal,

16:20.320 --> 16:21.540
 for example.

16:21.540 --> 16:26.100
 And we actually published a paper on this back in 2009

16:26.100 --> 16:29.980
 in Fruit Flies, where we found some evidence

16:29.980 --> 16:32.860
 for two types of arousal states,

16:32.860 --> 16:35.680
 one of which is sleep-wake arousal.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.400
 You're more aroused when you wake up

16:37.400 --> 16:39.900
 than when you're asleep, and flies show that.

16:39.900 --> 16:44.900
 And the other is a startle response, an arousal response,

16:45.220 --> 16:48.820
 to a mechanical stimulus, a noxious mechanical stimulus.

16:48.820 --> 16:50.780
 If you puff air on flies,

16:50.780 --> 16:53.540
 kind of like trying to swat the wasp away

16:53.540 --> 16:55.640
 from your burger at the picnic table,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.700
 they come back more and more and more vigorously.

16:58.700 --> 17:01.820
 And we were able to dissect this and show

17:01.820 --> 17:05.220
 that although both of those forms of arousal

17:05.220 --> 17:09.340
 require dopamine, they were exerted

17:09.340 --> 17:13.500
 through completely separable neural circuits in the fly.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.220
 And so that really put, number one, the emphasis on,

17:17.220 --> 17:20.660
 it's the circuit that determines the type of arousal,

17:20.660 --> 17:24.140
 but also that arousal isn't unitary,

17:24.140 --> 17:27.420
 that there are behavior-specific forms of arousal.

17:27.420 --> 17:29.820
 And I think the jury is still out

17:29.820 --> 17:32.380
 as to whether there is such a thing

17:32.380 --> 17:35.820
 as completely generalized arousal or not.

17:35.820 --> 17:38.460
 I think some people would argue there is,

17:38.460 --> 17:40.920
 but I think more attention needs to be paid

17:40.920 --> 17:43.820
 to this question of domain-specific

17:43.820 --> 17:46.660
 or behavior-specific forms of arousal.

17:46.660 --> 17:48.220
 Yeah, it's a super interesting idea,

17:48.220 --> 17:50.260
 because I always thought of arousal as along a continuum,

17:50.260 --> 17:52.060
 like you can either be in a panic attack

17:52.060 --> 17:54.300
 at the one end of the extreme, or you can be in a coma,

17:54.300 --> 17:56.740
 and then somewhere in the middle, you're alert and calm.

17:56.740 --> 18:00.580
 But then this issue of valence really, as you say,

18:00.580 --> 18:02.100
 presents this opportunity that really

18:02.100 --> 18:05.100
 there might be multiple circuits for arousal

18:05.100 --> 18:08.940
 or multiple mechanisms that would include neurochemicals

18:08.940 --> 18:11.260
 as well as different neural pathways.

18:11.260 --> 18:15.140
 So I'd like to talk a bit about a state,

18:15.140 --> 18:18.100
 if it is indeed a state, which is aggression.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.520
 Your lab's worked extensively on this.

18:20.520 --> 18:22.940
 And if you would, could you highlight

18:22.940 --> 18:25.060
 some of the key findings there,

18:25.060 --> 18:27.580
 which brain areas that are involved,

18:27.580 --> 18:30.340
 the beautiful work of Dai-Yu Lin and others in your lab,

18:32.060 --> 18:35.380
 that point to the idea that indeed there are

18:35.380 --> 18:37.180
 kind of switches in the brain,

18:37.180 --> 18:40.280
 but that thinking of switches for aggression

18:40.280 --> 18:42.580
 might be too simple.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.400
 How should we think about aggression?

18:44.400 --> 18:48.000
 And I'll just sort of skew the question a bit more

18:48.000 --> 18:51.700
 by saying we see lots of different kinds of aggression,

18:51.700 --> 18:56.360
 this terrible school shooting down in Texas recently,

18:56.360 --> 18:58.320
 clearly an act that included aggression,

18:58.320 --> 19:00.180
 and yet you could imagine

19:00.180 --> 19:01.380
 that's a very different type of aggression

19:01.380 --> 19:05.540
 than an all-out rage or a controlled aggression.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.700
 There's a lot of variation there.

19:06.700 --> 19:09.060
 So what are your thoughts on aggression,

19:09.060 --> 19:11.000
 how it's generated the neural circuit mechanisms,

19:11.000 --> 19:13.840
 and some of the variation in what we call aggression?

19:13.840 --> 19:17.700
 Yeah, this is a great question, and it's a large area.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.400
 I would say that the, first of all,

19:21.340 --> 19:24.780
 the word aggression in my mind

19:24.780 --> 19:28.340
 refers more to a description of behavior

19:28.340 --> 19:31.300
 than it does to an internal state.

19:32.380 --> 19:35.300
 Aggression could reflect an internal state

19:35.300 --> 19:38.280
 that we would call anger in humans,

19:38.280 --> 19:43.140
 or could reflect fear, or it could reflect hunger

19:43.140 --> 19:45.140
 if it's predatory aggression.

19:45.140 --> 19:47.700
 And so this gets at the issue that you raised

19:47.700 --> 19:51.420
 of the different types of aggression that exist.

19:51.420 --> 19:55.740
 The work that Dayu did when she was in my lab

19:55.740 --> 19:58.740
 that really broke open the field

19:58.740 --> 20:01.780
 to the application of modern genetic tools

20:01.780 --> 20:04.020
 for studying circuits in mice

20:04.020 --> 20:09.020
 is that she found a way to evoke aggression in mice

20:09.020 --> 20:14.020
 using optogenetics to activate specific neurons

20:15.460 --> 20:18.340
 in a region of the hypothalamus,

20:18.340 --> 20:21.340
 the ventromedial hypothalamus, VMH,

20:21.340 --> 20:26.340
 which people had been studying and looking at for decades,

20:27.460 --> 20:32.380
 following first the work in Katz,

20:32.380 --> 20:36.500
 the famous Nobel Prize winning work of Walter Hess,

20:36.500 --> 20:40.100
 and then followed by work done by Meno Crook

20:40.100 --> 20:42.620
 in the Netherlands in rats

20:42.620 --> 20:46.980
 where they would stick electrical wires into the brain

20:46.980 --> 20:49.760
 and send electric currents into the brain,

20:49.760 --> 20:52.860
 and they could trigger a placid cat

20:52.860 --> 20:56.080
 to suddenly bare its teeth, hiss,

20:56.080 --> 20:58.520
 and almost strike out at the experimenter,

20:59.420 --> 21:03.500
 and they could trigger rats to fight with each other.

21:03.500 --> 21:07.220
 And even in Hess's original experiments,

21:07.220 --> 21:10.020
 he describes two types of aggression

21:10.020 --> 21:11.940
 that he evokes from Katz

21:11.940 --> 21:14.700
 depending on where in the hypothalamus

21:14.700 --> 21:16.860
 he puts his electrode,

21:16.860 --> 21:20.060
 one of which he calls defensive rage,

21:20.060 --> 21:24.380
 that's the ears laid back, teeth bared and hissing,

21:24.380 --> 21:27.560
 and the other one is predatory aggression

21:27.560 --> 21:30.660
 where the cat has its ears forward

21:30.660 --> 21:34.420
 and it's like batting with its paw at a mouse-like object

21:34.420 --> 21:36.800
 like it wants to catch it and eat it.

21:36.800 --> 21:40.740
 So he already had at that stage some information

21:40.740 --> 21:42.820
 about segregation in the brain

21:42.820 --> 21:44.780
 of different forms of aggression.

21:44.780 --> 21:48.260
 So fast forward to 2008, 2009

21:53.000 --> 21:54.780
 when Dayu came to the lab

21:54.780 --> 21:58.180
 and we had started working on aggression in fruit flies

21:58.180 --> 22:00.860
 and I wanted to bring it into mice

22:00.860 --> 22:03.260
 so that we could apply genetic tools.

22:03.260 --> 22:05.480
 And we started by having Dayu,

22:05.480 --> 22:08.180
 who was an electrophysiologist,

22:08.180 --> 22:11.780
 just repeat the electrical stimulation

22:11.780 --> 22:15.260
 of the ventromedial hypothalamus in the mouse,

22:15.260 --> 22:19.340
 just like people had done in rats, in cats, in hamsters,

22:19.340 --> 22:20.460
 even in monkeys.

22:20.460 --> 22:23.580
 And she could not get that experiment to work

22:23.580 --> 22:26.420
 over 40 different trials.

22:26.420 --> 22:27.540
 It just didn't work.

22:27.540 --> 22:31.140
 What she got instead was fear behaviors.

22:31.140 --> 22:35.800
 She got freezing, cornering, and crouching.

22:35.800 --> 22:39.100
 And finally in desperation,

22:39.100 --> 22:41.820
 and we got a lot of input from Meno Crook on this,

22:41.820 --> 22:43.100
 he really was mystified.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.860
 Why doesn't it work in mice?

22:44.860 --> 22:47.720
 We realized why there had been no paper

22:47.720 --> 22:52.460
 on brain stimulated aggression in mice in 50 years

22:52.460 --> 22:54.900
 because the experiment doesn't work.

22:54.900 --> 22:59.220
 And the one bit of credit I can claim there

22:59.220 --> 23:03.320
 is I convinced Dayu to try optogenetics

23:03.320 --> 23:08.320
 because it just had sort of come into use deep in the brain

23:09.800 --> 23:12.120
 from Carl Deiss-Roth and others' work.

23:13.160 --> 23:16.180
 And I thought maybe because it could be directed

23:16.180 --> 23:19.400
 more specifically to a region of the brain

23:19.400 --> 23:22.580
 and types of cells and optogenetic stimulation,

23:22.580 --> 23:24.700
 than electrical stimulation,

23:24.700 --> 23:25.540
 it might work.

23:25.540 --> 23:27.880
 And Dayu said, never, never gonna work.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.620
 If it doesn't work with electricity,

23:29.620 --> 23:32.700
 why should it work with optogenetics?

23:32.700 --> 23:35.480
 And the fact is that it did work

23:35.480 --> 23:40.140
 and we were able to trigger aggression in this region

23:40.140 --> 23:44.020
 using optogenetic stimulation of ventromedial hypothalamus.

23:44.020 --> 23:46.620
 And in retrospect, I think the reason

23:46.620 --> 23:50.320
 that we were seeing all these fear behaviors

23:50.320 --> 23:53.780
 is because right at the upper part,

23:53.780 --> 23:56.740
 if you think of ventromedial hypothalamus

23:56.740 --> 23:59.300
 like a pear sitting on the ground,

23:59.300 --> 24:02.000
 the fat part of the pear near the ground

24:02.000 --> 24:03.880
 is where the aggression neurons are,

24:03.880 --> 24:07.520
 but the upper part of the pear has fear neurons.

24:07.520 --> 24:11.120
 And it could be because it's so small in a mouse,

24:11.120 --> 24:15.160
 when you inject electrical current anywhere in the pear,

24:15.160 --> 24:17.680
 it flows up through the entire pear

24:17.680 --> 24:19.780
 and it activates the fear circuits

24:19.780 --> 24:22.800
 and those totally dominate aggression.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.540
 And so that's why we were never able to see

24:25.540 --> 24:28.020
 any fighting with electrical stimulation.

24:28.020 --> 24:29.740
 Whereas when you use optogenetics,

24:29.740 --> 24:34.100
 you confine the stimulation just to the region

24:34.100 --> 24:38.500
 where you've implanted the channelrhodopsin gene

24:38.500 --> 24:39.960
 into those neurons.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.600
 And so fast forward from that,

24:43.600 --> 24:47.820
 from a lot of work from Dayu now on her own at NYU

24:47.820 --> 24:51.020
 and with her postdoc, Anna-Gret Faulkner,

24:51.020 --> 24:53.580
 there's, as well as work of other people,

24:53.580 --> 24:57.380
 there's evidence that the type of fighting

24:57.380 --> 25:01.820
 that we elicit when we stimulate VMH

25:01.820 --> 25:06.820
 is offensive aggression that is actually rewarding

25:06.900 --> 25:08.380
 to male mice. They like it.

25:08.380 --> 25:09.300
 They like it.

25:09.300 --> 25:13.260
 Male mice will press, learn to poke their nose

25:13.260 --> 25:16.380
 or press a bar to get the opportunity

25:16.380 --> 25:20.020
 to beat up a subordinate male mouse.

25:20.020 --> 25:22.260
 And in more recent experiments,

25:22.260 --> 25:25.940
 if you activate those neurons and the mouse has a chance

25:25.940 --> 25:29.100
 to be in one of two compartments in a box,

25:29.100 --> 25:31.260
 they will gravitate towards the compartment

25:31.260 --> 25:33.460
 where those neurons are activated.

25:33.460 --> 25:35.980
 It has a positive valence.

25:35.980 --> 25:38.460
 And when I went into this field and I was thinking,

25:38.460 --> 25:43.460
 well, what goes on in my brain and my body when I'm furious?

25:43.580 --> 25:47.500
 It certainly doesn't feel like a rewarding experience.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.180
 It's not something that I would want to repeat

25:50.180 --> 25:52.640
 because it feels good when I'm in that state.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.580
 It doesn't feel good at all when I'm in that state.

25:55.580 --> 25:59.300
 And it is still, I think, a mystery

25:59.300 --> 26:01.300
 as to where that type of aggression,

26:01.300 --> 26:03.840
 which is more defensive aggression,

26:03.840 --> 26:07.100
 the kind of aggression you feel if you're being attacked

26:07.100 --> 26:10.020
 or if you've been cheated by somebody,

26:10.020 --> 26:14.780
 where that is encoded in the brain and how that works still,

26:14.780 --> 26:17.460
 I think, is a very important mystery

26:17.460 --> 26:18.980
 that we haven't solved.

26:18.980 --> 26:22.260
 And predatory aggression there has been some progress on.

26:22.260 --> 26:24.540
 So mice show predatory aggression.

26:24.540 --> 26:27.260
 They use that to catch crickets that they eat,

26:27.260 --> 26:29.780
 and that involves different circuits

26:29.780 --> 26:32.780
 than the ventromedial hypothalamic circuits.

26:32.780 --> 26:36.700
 So it's become clear that if you want to call it

26:36.700 --> 26:41.700
 the state of aggressiveness is multifaceted.

26:41.860 --> 26:44.580
 It depends on the type of aggression,

26:44.580 --> 26:47.820
 and it involves different sorts of circuits.

26:47.820 --> 26:50.360
 There is, there's a paper suggesting

26:50.360 --> 26:54.740
 that there might be a final common pathway

26:54.740 --> 26:57.780
 for all aggression in a region,

26:57.780 --> 26:59.220
 which is one of my favorites.

26:59.220 --> 27:01.820
 It's called the substantia in naminata,

27:01.820 --> 27:03.780
 the substance with no name.

27:03.780 --> 27:04.620
 You know, I like-

27:04.620 --> 27:06.340
 Anatomists are so creative.

27:06.340 --> 27:10.260
 Or the nucleus ambiguous, you know, or the zona inserta.

27:10.260 --> 27:13.140
 These are places that no one can think of what they are.

27:13.140 --> 27:16.080
 Anyhow, that might be a final common pathway

27:16.080 --> 27:18.820
 for predatory aggression and offensive

27:18.820 --> 27:20.460
 and defensive aggression.

27:20.460 --> 27:22.620
 But it can be really hard to tell

27:22.620 --> 27:25.500
 just from looking at a mouse fight,

27:25.500 --> 27:29.660
 whether it's engaged in offensive or defensive aggression.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.480
 We've tried to take that apart

27:31.480 --> 27:34.620
 using machine learning analysis of behavior.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.940
 But in rats, for example, it's much clearer

27:37.940 --> 27:40.100
 when the animal is engaged in offensive

27:40.100 --> 27:41.860
 versus defensive aggression.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.660
 They direct their bites at different parts

27:44.660 --> 27:46.080
 of the opponent's body.

27:46.080 --> 27:46.920
 In particular-

27:46.920 --> 27:51.240
 Neck versus, offensive aggression is flank directed.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.880
 Defensive aggression goes for the neck,

27:53.880 --> 27:55.200
 goes for the throat.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.500
 I've seen some nature specials

27:56.500 --> 27:59.860
 where in a very barbaric way, at least to me,

27:59.860 --> 28:02.700
 it seems like hyenas will try and go after

28:02.700 --> 28:05.200
 the reproductive axis.

28:05.200 --> 28:07.420
 They'll go after testicles and penis.

28:07.420 --> 28:08.860
 And they basically want to,

28:08.860 --> 28:12.500
 it seems they want to limit future breeding potential.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.740
 Or create pain.

28:13.740 --> 28:15.700
 Or create pain or both.

28:15.700 --> 28:18.820
 Yeah, I mean, in terms of offensive aggression

28:18.820 --> 28:23.220
 and your reflection that it doesn't feel good,

28:23.220 --> 28:24.500
 I mean, I can say,

28:24.500 --> 28:27.080
 I know some people who really enjoy fighting.

28:28.100 --> 28:29.460
 I have a relative who is a lawyer.

28:29.460 --> 28:32.160
 He loves to argue and fight.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.740
 I don't think of him as physically aggressive.

28:34.740 --> 28:35.580
 In fact, he's not,

28:35.580 --> 28:38.580
 but loves to fight and loves to prosecute

28:38.580 --> 28:41.380
 and go after people and he's pretty effective at it.

28:41.380 --> 28:44.500
 I have a friend, former military special operations

28:44.500 --> 28:46.260
 and very calm guy,

28:46.260 --> 28:49.780
 had a great career in military special operations.

28:49.780 --> 28:52.700
 And he'll quite plainly say, I love to fight.

28:52.700 --> 28:54.380
 It's one of my great joys.

28:54.380 --> 28:55.860
 He really enjoyed his work.

28:56.980 --> 28:58.840
 And also respected the other side

28:58.840 --> 29:01.820
 because they offered the opportunity to test that

29:01.820 --> 29:03.060
 and to experience that joy.

29:03.060 --> 29:04.980
 So in a kind of bizarre way to somebody like me

29:04.980 --> 29:08.740
 who I'll certainly defend my stance if I need to,

29:08.740 --> 29:10.860
 but I certainly don't consider myself

29:10.860 --> 29:12.960
 somebody who offensively goes after people

29:12.960 --> 29:13.800
 just to go after them.

29:13.800 --> 29:17.260
 There's no quote unquote dopamine hit here,

29:17.260 --> 29:19.880
 acknowledging that dopamine does many things, of course.

29:19.880 --> 29:21.300
 I have a couple of questions

29:21.300 --> 29:24.020
 about the way you describe the circuitry.

29:24.020 --> 29:26.880
 I should say the way the circuitry is arranged.

29:26.880 --> 29:28.020
 And of course we don't know

29:28.020 --> 29:31.580
 because we weren't consulted at the design phase,

29:31.580 --> 29:35.900
 but why do you think there would be such a close positioning

29:35.900 --> 29:38.220
 of neurons that can elicit

29:38.220 --> 29:41.260
 such divergent states and behaviors?

29:41.260 --> 29:43.540
 I mean, you're talking about this pear shaped structure

29:43.540 --> 29:46.060
 where the neurons that generate fear

29:46.060 --> 29:48.300
 are cheek to jowl with the neurons

29:48.300 --> 29:51.660
 that generate offensive aggression of all things.

29:51.660 --> 29:55.900
 It's like putting the neurons that control swallowing

29:55.900 --> 29:57.980
 next to the neurons that control vomiting.

29:57.980 --> 30:00.820
 It just seems to me that on the one hand,

30:00.820 --> 30:03.060
 this is the way that neural circuits are often arranged.

30:03.060 --> 30:04.620
 And yet to me, it's always been perplexing

30:04.620 --> 30:06.300
 as to why this would be the case.

30:06.300 --> 30:10.200
 Yeah, I think that is a very profound question.

30:10.200 --> 30:14.180
 And I've wondered about that a lot.

30:15.260 --> 30:19.120
 If you think from an evolutionary perspective,

30:20.320 --> 30:25.060
 it might have been the case that defensive behaviors

30:25.060 --> 30:30.060
 and fear arose before offensive aggression,

30:31.580 --> 30:33.840
 because animals first and foremost

30:33.840 --> 30:38.200
 have to defend themselves from predation by other animals.

30:38.200 --> 30:41.280
 And maybe it's only when they're comfortable

30:41.280 --> 30:45.300
 with having warded off predation and made themselves safe

30:45.300 --> 30:47.920
 that they can start to think about

30:47.920 --> 30:51.900
 who's gonna be the alpha male in my group here.

30:51.900 --> 30:56.420
 And so it could be that if you think that brain regions

30:56.420 --> 31:00.260
 and cell populations evolved by duplication

31:00.260 --> 31:05.260
 and modification of preexisting cell populations,

31:05.460 --> 31:08.700
 that might be the way that those regions

31:08.700 --> 31:10.760
 wound up next to each other.

31:11.640 --> 31:14.340
 And developmentally, they start out

31:14.340 --> 31:16.780
 from a common pool of precursors

31:16.780 --> 31:18.580
 that expresses the same gene,

31:18.580 --> 31:21.300
 the fear neurons and the aggression neurons.

31:21.300 --> 31:22.580
 And then with development,

31:22.580 --> 31:24.980
 it gets shut off in the aggression neurons

31:24.980 --> 31:27.660
 and maintained in the fear neurons.

31:27.660 --> 31:31.020
 Now that view says, oh, it's an accident

31:31.020 --> 31:32.700
 of evolution and development,

31:32.700 --> 31:36.180
 but I think there must be a functional part as well.

31:36.180 --> 31:38.900
 So one thing we know about offensive aggression

31:38.900 --> 31:42.540
 is that strong fear shuts it down.

31:42.540 --> 31:46.180
 Whereas defensive aggression, at least in rats,

31:46.180 --> 31:48.780
 is actually enhanced by fear.

31:48.780 --> 31:52.700
 It's one of the big differences between defensive aggression

31:52.700 --> 31:54.300
 and offensive aggression.

31:54.300 --> 31:55.980
 And you think about it, if you think about it,

31:55.980 --> 31:59.300
 if offensive aggression is rewarding and pleasurable,

31:59.300 --> 32:01.680
 if you start to get really scared,

32:01.680 --> 32:03.780
 that tends to take the fun out of it.

32:03.780 --> 32:07.140
 And maybe these two regions are close to each other

32:07.140 --> 32:12.140
 to facilitate inhibition of aggression by the fear neurons.

32:13.380 --> 32:16.600
 We know for a fact that if we deliberately stimulate

32:16.600 --> 32:19.380
 those fear neurons at the top of the pair,

32:19.380 --> 32:21.500
 when two animals are involved in a fight,

32:21.500 --> 32:24.300
 it just stops the fight dead in its tracks

32:24.300 --> 32:27.020
 and they go off into the corner and freeze.

32:27.020 --> 32:29.080
 So at least hierarchically,

32:29.080 --> 32:32.560
 it seems like fear is the dominant behavior

32:32.560 --> 32:34.340
 over offensive aggression.

32:34.340 --> 32:37.340
 And how that inhibition would work is not clear

32:37.340 --> 32:39.940
 because all these neurons are pretty much excitatory.

32:39.940 --> 32:42.020
 They're almost all glutamatergic.

32:42.020 --> 32:45.740
 And so one of the interesting questions for the future

32:45.740 --> 32:49.300
 is how exactly does fear dominate over

32:49.300 --> 32:52.720
 and shut down offensive aggression in the brain?

32:52.720 --> 32:53.700
 How does that work?

32:53.700 --> 32:54.780
 Is it all circuitry?

32:54.780 --> 32:56.560
 Are there chemicals involved?

32:56.560 --> 33:00.340
 What's the mechanism and when is it called into play?

33:00.340 --> 33:03.260
 But I think that's the way I tend to think about

33:03.260 --> 33:06.420
 why these neurons are all mixed up together.

33:06.420 --> 33:10.520
 And it's not just fight and freezing or fight and flight.

33:10.520 --> 33:13.100
 There are also metabolic neurons

33:13.100 --> 33:16.060
 that are mixed together in VMH as well.

33:16.060 --> 33:18.380
 Controlling body-wide metabolism?

33:18.380 --> 33:21.780
 Yeah, there are neurons there that respond to glucose.

33:21.780 --> 33:24.540
 When glucose goes up in your bloodstream,

33:24.540 --> 33:25.820
 they're activated.

33:25.820 --> 33:30.200
 And VMH has a whole history in the field of obesity

33:30.200 --> 33:35.200
 because if you destroy it in a rat, you get a fat rat.

33:35.260 --> 33:38.260
 So the way most of the world thinks about VMH

33:38.260 --> 33:39.220
 is they think about,

33:39.220 --> 33:42.140
 oh, that's the thing that keeps you from getting fat.

33:42.140 --> 33:44.220
 It's the anti-obesity area.

33:44.220 --> 33:47.220
 But in the area of social behavior,

33:47.220 --> 33:50.740
 we see it as a center for control of aggression

33:50.740 --> 33:51.860
 and fear behaviors.

33:51.860 --> 33:56.440
 And again, why these neurons and these functions,

33:56.440 --> 33:58.420
 I like to call them the four Fs,

33:58.420 --> 34:00.820
 feeding, freezing, fighting, and mating,

34:00.820 --> 34:03.340
 that they all seem to be closely intermingled

34:03.340 --> 34:06.500
 with each other, maybe because crosstalk between them

34:06.500 --> 34:09.580
 is very important to help the animal's brain

34:09.580 --> 34:12.860
 decide what behavior to prioritize

34:12.860 --> 34:16.300
 and what behavior to shut down at any given moment.

34:17.220 --> 34:18.420
 One of the things that we will do

34:18.420 --> 34:22.400
 is link to the incredible videos of these mice

34:22.400 --> 34:26.500
 that have selective stimulation of neurons in the VMH,

34:26.500 --> 34:28.860
 DAUs and the other studies that you've done.

34:28.860 --> 34:33.540
 Whenever I teach, I show those videos at some point

34:33.540 --> 34:36.620
 with the caveats and warnings that are required

34:36.620 --> 34:40.860
 when one is about to see a video of a mouse

34:40.860 --> 34:42.100
 trying to mate with another mouse

34:42.100 --> 34:43.460
 or mating with another mouse.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.200
 And they seem both to be quite happy

34:45.200 --> 34:46.580
 about the mating experience,

34:46.580 --> 34:49.120
 at least as far as we know as observers of mice.

34:50.220 --> 34:55.220
 And then upon stimulation of those VMH neurons,

34:55.520 --> 34:58.940
 one of the mice essentially tries to kill the other mouse.

34:58.940 --> 35:02.820
 And then when that stimulation is stopped,

35:02.820 --> 35:04.700
 they basically go back to hanging out.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.180
 They don't go right back to mating.

35:06.180 --> 35:07.620
 There's some reconciliation clearly

35:07.620 --> 35:09.880
 that needs to happen first, we assume.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.180
 But it's just so striking.

35:11.180 --> 35:12.760
 I think equally striking is the video

35:12.760 --> 35:15.940
 where the mouse is alone in there with the glove.

35:16.820 --> 35:20.180
 The VMH neurons are stimulated and the mouse goes into a rage

35:20.180 --> 35:23.020
 it looks like it wants to kill the glove basically.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.560
 So striking, I encourage people to go watch those

35:25.560 --> 35:29.740
 because it really puts a tremendous amount of color

35:29.740 --> 35:30.880
 on what we're describing.

35:30.880 --> 35:34.960
 And it's just the idea that there are switches in the brain

35:34.960 --> 35:37.460
 to me really became clear upon seeing that.

35:37.460 --> 35:39.420
 One of the concepts, excuse me,

35:39.420 --> 35:42.100
 one of the concepts that you've raised

35:42.100 --> 35:45.340
 in your lectures before and that I think was Hess's idea

35:45.340 --> 35:47.580
 is this idea of a sort of hydraulic pressure,

35:47.580 --> 35:51.220
 or maybe it was Conrad, I can't speak now, excuse me,

35:51.220 --> 35:54.420
 Conrad Lorenz, Martin, who talked about

35:54.420 --> 35:57.260
 a kind of hydraulic pressure towards behavior.

35:57.260 --> 36:00.100
 I'm fascinated by this idea of hydraulic pressure

36:00.100 --> 36:03.220
 because I don't consider myself a hot tempered person,

36:03.220 --> 36:06.420
 but I am familiar with the fact that when I lose my temper,

36:06.420 --> 36:09.740
 it takes quite a while for me to simmer down.

36:09.740 --> 36:11.260
 I can't think about anything else.

36:11.260 --> 36:12.680
 I don't want to think about anything else.

36:12.680 --> 36:15.400
 In fact, trying to think about anything else

36:15.400 --> 36:17.420
 becomes aversive to me,

36:17.420 --> 36:21.940
 which to me underscores this notion of prioritization

36:21.940 --> 36:25.400
 of the different states and potentially conflicting states.

36:26.780 --> 36:28.620
 What do you think funnels into this idea

36:28.620 --> 36:31.060
 of hydraulic pressure toward a state?

36:31.060 --> 36:36.060
 And why is it perhaps that sometimes we can be very angry

36:36.080 --> 36:39.800
 and if we succeed in winning an argument,

36:39.800 --> 36:41.940
 all of a sudden it will subside?

36:41.940 --> 36:44.340
 Because clearly that means that there are external influences

36:44.340 --> 36:46.180
 it's a complex space here that we're creating.

36:46.180 --> 36:47.700
 I realize I'm creating a bit of a cloud

36:47.700 --> 36:49.880
 and I'm doing it on purpose because to me,

36:49.880 --> 36:52.460
 the idea of a hydraulic pressure towards a state like sleep,

36:52.460 --> 36:55.180
 there's a sleep pressure, there's a pressure towards,

36:55.180 --> 36:58.060
 that all makes sense, but what's involved?

36:58.060 --> 37:02.100
 Is it too multifactorial to actually separate out

37:02.100 --> 37:06.540
 the variables, but what's really driving hydraulic pressure

37:06.540 --> 37:08.060
 toward a given state?

37:08.060 --> 37:11.980
 Yeah, so a really important question.

37:11.980 --> 37:15.460
 I think one way that is helpful, at least for me,

37:15.460 --> 37:18.420
 to break this question apart and think about it

37:18.420 --> 37:22.960
 is to distinguish homeostatic behaviors

37:22.960 --> 37:27.500
 that is need-based behaviors where the pressure is built up

37:27.500 --> 37:32.220
 because of a need, like I'm hungry, I need to eat,

37:32.220 --> 37:35.900
 I'm thirsty, I need to drink, I'm hot,

37:35.900 --> 37:38.140
 I need to get to a cold place.

37:38.140 --> 37:41.680
 It's basically the thermostat model of your brain.

37:41.680 --> 37:44.020
 You have a set point and then if the temperature

37:44.020 --> 37:46.060
 gets too hot, you turn on the AC

37:46.060 --> 37:47.960
 and if the temperature gets too cold,

37:47.960 --> 37:49.700
 you turn on the heater and you put yourself

37:49.700 --> 37:51.140
 back to the set point.

37:51.140 --> 37:53.760
 I don't think that's how aggression works.

37:53.760 --> 37:56.780
 That is, it's not that we all go around,

37:56.780 --> 37:59.080
 at least subjectively, I don't go around

37:59.080 --> 38:02.680
 with an accumulating need to fight,

38:02.680 --> 38:05.820
 which I then look for something to,

38:05.820 --> 38:07.200
 an excuse to release it.

38:07.200 --> 38:09.020
 Now, maybe there are people that do that

38:09.020 --> 38:12.460
 and they go out and look for bar fights to get into.

38:12.460 --> 38:13.300
 Or Twitter.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.220
 Yeah, or Twitter.

38:14.220 --> 38:16.380
 Twitter seems to, I'm sort of half joking

38:16.380 --> 38:20.420
 because Twitter seems to draw a reasonably sized crowd

38:20.420 --> 38:24.440
 of people that are there for combat of some sort,

38:24.440 --> 38:26.420
 even though the total intellectual power

38:26.420 --> 38:28.900
 of any of their comments is about that of a cap gun.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.440
 They seem to really like to fire off that cap gun.

38:31.440 --> 38:33.700
 But I agree.

38:33.700 --> 38:35.940
 Before we continue with today's discussion,

38:35.940 --> 38:38.040
 I'd like to just briefly acknowledge our sponsor,

38:38.040 --> 38:41.260
 Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

38:41.260 --> 38:44.300
 Athletic Greens, AKA AG1, is an all-in-one

38:44.300 --> 38:45.980
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink

38:45.980 --> 38:49.020
 that also has adaptogens and digestive enzymes.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.740
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since way back in 2012,

38:51.740 --> 38:54.180
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

38:54.180 --> 38:55.780
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

38:55.780 --> 38:58.740
 and the reason I still drink Athletic Greens twice a day

38:58.740 --> 39:01.640
 is that it supplies total foundational coverage

39:01.640 --> 39:03.040
 of my vitamin mineral needs,

39:03.040 --> 39:05.540
 and it supplies important nutrients

39:05.540 --> 39:07.540
 that I need to support my gut microbiome.

39:07.540 --> 39:09.260
 The gut microbiome, as many of you know,

39:09.260 --> 39:10.380
 supports the immune system.

39:10.380 --> 39:12.400
 It also supports the so-called gut-brain axis,

39:12.400 --> 39:14.780
 which is vital for mood, for energy levels,

39:14.780 --> 39:16.020
 for regulating focus,

39:16.020 --> 39:17.860
 and many other features of our mental health

39:17.860 --> 39:20.180
 and physical health that impact our daily performance

39:20.180 --> 39:21.820
 and high performance in any endeavors

39:21.820 --> 39:23.220
 we might be involved in.

39:23.220 --> 39:24.600
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

39:24.600 --> 39:27.260
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

39:27.260 --> 39:28.880
 and claim a special offer.

39:28.880 --> 39:30.540
 They're giving away five free travel packs

39:30.540 --> 39:34.420
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2 with every order.

39:34.420 --> 39:36.660
 And of course, vitamin D3K2 are vital

39:36.660 --> 39:38.740
 for all sorts of things like hormone health

39:38.740 --> 39:41.140
 and metabolic health and K2 for cardiovascular health

39:41.140 --> 39:42.320
 and calcium regulation.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.540
 Again, you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

39:45.540 --> 39:46.860
 to claim that special offer.

39:46.860 --> 39:51.860
 So you can think of this accumulated hydraulic pressure

39:51.860 --> 39:55.580
 either being based on something that you were deprived of,

39:55.580 --> 39:57.980
 creating an accumulating need,

39:57.980 --> 40:00.580
 or something that you want to do,

40:00.580 --> 40:04.940
 building up a drive or a pressure to do that.

40:04.940 --> 40:09.020
 And the natural way to think about that, at least for me,

40:09.020 --> 40:13.560
 is as gradual increases in neural activity

40:13.560 --> 40:15.980
 in a particular region of the brain.

40:15.980 --> 40:19.940
 And so for example, in the area of the hypothalamus

40:19.940 --> 40:22.980
 that controls feeding, Scott Stearnsen and others

40:22.980 --> 40:26.260
 have shown that the hungrier you get,

40:26.260 --> 40:29.440
 the higher the level of activity in that region

40:29.440 --> 40:30.320
 in the brain.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.960
 And then when you eat, boom,

40:31.960 --> 40:34.620
 the activity goes right back down again.

40:34.620 --> 40:38.660
 And that state is actually negatively valence.

40:38.660 --> 40:41.860
 So it's like the animal, quote unquote,

40:41.860 --> 40:44.580
 feels increasingly uncomfortable,

40:44.580 --> 40:47.180
 just like we feel increasingly uncomfortable

40:47.180 --> 40:48.620
 the hungrier we are.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.020
 And then when we eat, it taps it down.

40:51.020 --> 40:53.340
 But there is this increased activity.

40:53.340 --> 40:55.500
 And I think in the case of aggression,

40:55.500 --> 40:59.140
 our data and others show that the more strongly

40:59.140 --> 41:03.680
 you drive this region of the brain optogenetically,

41:03.680 --> 41:07.300
 the more of just a hair trigger you need

41:07.300 --> 41:10.300
 to set the animal off to get it to fight.

41:10.300 --> 41:13.660
 Now, the interesting thing is that if there is nothing

41:13.660 --> 41:17.580
 for the animal to attack, it doesn't really do much

41:17.580 --> 41:19.700
 when you're stimulating this region.

41:19.700 --> 41:23.180
 It sort of wanders around the cage a little bit more,

41:23.180 --> 41:27.740
 but it will not actually show overt attack

41:27.740 --> 41:29.660
 unless you put something in front of it.

41:29.660 --> 41:32.340
 And the same thing is true for the areas we've described

41:32.340 --> 41:34.500
 that control mating behavior.

41:34.500 --> 41:36.420
 This is what Lindsay is working on.

41:36.420 --> 41:40.040
 You can stimulate those areas till you're blue in the face

41:40.040 --> 41:42.220
 and the mouse just sort of wanders around.

41:42.220 --> 41:45.060
 But if you put another mouse in, wham,

41:45.060 --> 41:46.820
 he will try to mount that mouse.

41:46.820 --> 41:49.060
 If you put a kumquat in the cage,

41:49.060 --> 41:51.240
 he'll try to mount the kumquat.

41:51.240 --> 41:54.880
 And so it becomes a sort of any port in the storm.

41:54.880 --> 41:59.880
 So there is this idea that the drive is building up pressure

42:00.820 --> 42:03.600
 that somehow needs to be released

42:03.600 --> 42:07.700
 where that pressure is actually being exerted.

42:07.700 --> 42:10.320
 If you accept that it's increased activity

42:10.320 --> 42:12.940
 in some circuit or circuits someplace,

42:12.940 --> 42:17.940
 what is it pushing up against that needs something else

42:18.780 --> 42:22.900
 to sort of unplug it in the Lorentz hydraulic model?

42:22.900 --> 42:25.100
 That is, you don't see the behavior

42:25.100 --> 42:27.940
 until you release a valve on this bucket

42:27.940 --> 42:31.460
 and let the accumulated pressure flow out.

42:31.460 --> 42:33.980
 And that's one of the things we're trying to study

42:33.980 --> 42:37.440
 in the context of the mating behavior as well.

42:37.440 --> 42:40.620
 How does the information that there's an object

42:40.620 --> 42:44.060
 in front of you come together with this drive state

42:44.060 --> 42:47.020
 that is generated by stimulating these neurons

42:47.020 --> 42:50.860
 in the hypothalamus to say, okay, pull the trigger and go,

42:50.860 --> 42:53.540
 it's time to mate, it's time to attack.

42:53.540 --> 42:56.860
 And we're just starting to get some insights into that now.

42:56.860 --> 42:59.700
 Fascinating, and I should mention to people,

42:59.700 --> 43:01.020
 Dr. Anderson mentioned Lindsay.

43:01.020 --> 43:02.640
 Lindsay is a former graduate student of mine

43:02.640 --> 43:04.480
 that's now a postdoc in David's lab.

43:04.480 --> 43:06.380
 And I haven't caught up with her recently

43:06.380 --> 43:09.100
 to hear about these experiments, but they sound fascinating.

43:09.100 --> 43:11.660
 I would love to spend some time on this issue

43:11.660 --> 43:15.980
 of why is it that a mouse won't attack nothing,

43:15.980 --> 43:19.140
 but it'll attack even a glove or,

43:19.140 --> 43:22.060
 and why, well, we'll only try and mate

43:22.060 --> 43:24.580
 if there's another mouse to mate with.

43:24.580 --> 43:28.320
 It's actually, I think fortunately for you,

43:28.320 --> 43:29.460
 you're not spending a lot of time

43:29.460 --> 43:32.460
 on Twitter and Instagram or YouTube,

43:32.460 --> 43:35.460
 but there's this whole online community that exists now.

43:35.460 --> 43:39.880
 As far as I know, it's almost exclusively young males

43:39.880 --> 43:42.860
 who are obsessed with this idea.

43:42.860 --> 43:44.000
 I'll just say it has a name,

43:44.000 --> 43:46.440
 it's called NoFap of no masturbation

43:46.440 --> 43:48.520
 as a way to maintain their motivation to go out

43:48.520 --> 43:52.100
 and actually seek mates because of the ready availability

43:52.100 --> 43:54.180
 of online pornography.

43:54.180 --> 43:57.340
 There's probably a much larger population of young males

43:57.340 --> 43:59.200
 that are never actually going out and seeking mates

43:59.200 --> 44:01.740
 because they're getting porn addicted, et cetera.

44:01.740 --> 44:03.860
 There's actually a serious issue that came up

44:03.860 --> 44:05.820
 in our episode with Anna Lemke who wrote the book,

44:05.820 --> 44:09.420
 Dopamine Nation, because the availability of pornography,

44:09.420 --> 44:12.380
 there's a whole social context that's being created

44:12.380 --> 44:14.760
 around this and genuine addiction.

44:14.760 --> 44:17.020
 So humans are not like the mice

44:17.020 --> 44:18.540
 or mice are not like the humans.

44:18.540 --> 44:21.420
 Humans seem to resolve the issue on their own

44:21.420 --> 44:24.340
 in ways that might actually impede seeking and finding

44:24.340 --> 44:26.780
 of sexual partners and or long-term mates.

44:26.780 --> 44:28.500
 So serious issue there.

44:28.500 --> 44:30.980
 I raise it as a serious issue that I hear a lot about

44:30.980 --> 44:33.060
 because I get asked hundreds, if not thousands

44:33.060 --> 44:33.900
 of questions about this.

44:33.900 --> 44:36.900
 Is there any physiological basis for what they call NoFap?

44:36.900 --> 44:39.800
 And I never actually replied because there's no data,

44:39.800 --> 44:43.060
 but what you're raising here is a very interesting

44:43.060 --> 44:47.620
 mechanistic scenario that can,

44:47.620 --> 44:49.540
 as you mentioned, is being explored.

44:49.540 --> 44:54.100
 So what do we know about the internal state

44:54.100 --> 44:57.020
 of a mouse whose VMH is being stimulated

44:57.020 --> 45:00.680
 or a mouse whose other brain region

45:00.680 --> 45:03.340
 that can stimulate the desire to mate?

45:03.340 --> 45:05.620
 What do we know about the internal state of that mouse

45:05.620 --> 45:07.500
 if it's just alone in the cage wandering around?

45:07.500 --> 45:09.540
 Is it wandering around really wanting to mate

45:09.540 --> 45:10.660
 and really wanting to fight?

45:10.660 --> 45:15.380
 We of course don't know, but is its heart rate up?

45:15.380 --> 45:17.260
 Is its blood pressure up?

45:17.260 --> 45:19.900
 Is it wishing that there was pornography?

45:19.900 --> 45:23.980
 Is it, something's going on presumably

45:23.980 --> 45:28.980
 that's different than prior to that stimulation

45:28.980 --> 45:31.260
 and is it arousal?

45:31.260 --> 45:33.740
 And what do you think it is about the visual

45:33.740 --> 45:36.960
 or olfactory perception of a conspecific

45:36.960 --> 45:40.380
 that ungates this tremendous repertoire of behaviors?

45:40.380 --> 45:43.820
 Right, that is the central question.

45:43.820 --> 45:47.720
 I can say at least with respect to the fear neurons

45:47.720 --> 45:49.740
 that sit on top of the aggression neurons,

45:49.740 --> 45:53.340
 we know that when those neurons are activated

45:53.340 --> 45:56.220
 optogenetically in the same way we would activate

45:56.220 --> 46:00.020
 the aggression neurons that there's clearly an arousal

46:00.020 --> 46:01.300
 process that's occurring.

46:01.300 --> 46:04.320
 You can see the pupils dilate in the animal.

46:04.320 --> 46:07.660
 There is an increase in stress hormone release

46:07.660 --> 46:09.100
 into the bloodstream.

46:09.100 --> 46:12.520
 We've shown that heart rate goes up.

46:12.520 --> 46:17.300
 So in addition to the drive to actually freeze

46:17.300 --> 46:19.660
 which is what those animals do,

46:19.660 --> 46:24.660
 there is autonomic arousal and neuroendocrine activation

46:24.660 --> 46:26.220
 of stress responses.

46:26.220 --> 46:29.060
 And some of that is probably shared

46:29.060 --> 46:32.220
 by the aggression neurons and the mating neurons

46:32.220 --> 46:35.460
 although we haven't investigated it in as much detail.

46:35.460 --> 46:38.780
 But I wouldn't be surprised because they project

46:38.780 --> 46:43.420
 to many of the same regions that the fear neurons

46:43.420 --> 46:47.660
 project to which is a interesting issue in the context

46:47.660 --> 46:50.440
 to discuss later maybe in the context of why

46:50.440 --> 46:53.300
 we're comfortable with mental illnesses that are based

46:53.300 --> 46:56.660
 on maladaptations of fear but not mental illnesses

46:56.660 --> 46:59.800
 that are based on maladaptations of aggression

46:59.800 --> 47:02.540
 if they have pretty similar circuits in the brain.

47:02.540 --> 47:06.300
 But that's how I would imagine there is

47:06.300 --> 47:08.860
 an arousal dimension as you say.

47:08.860 --> 47:10.940
 There are stress hormones that are activated.

47:10.940 --> 47:15.620
 These regions, VMH projects to about 30 different regions

47:15.620 --> 47:18.400
 in the brain and it gets input

47:18.400 --> 47:20.100
 from about 30 different regions.

47:20.100 --> 47:23.460
 So I kind of see it as both an antenna

47:23.460 --> 47:25.180
 and a broadcasting center.

47:25.180 --> 47:28.820
 It's like a satellite dish that takes in information

47:28.820 --> 47:32.260
 from different sensory modalities, smell,

47:32.260 --> 47:37.100
 maybe vision, mechanosensation and then it sort

47:37.100 --> 47:40.780
 of synthesizes and integrates that into

47:40.780 --> 47:44.620
 a fairly low dimensional as the computational people

47:44.620 --> 47:48.860
 call it representation of this pressure to attack

47:48.860 --> 47:51.820
 and it broadcasts that all over the brain

47:51.820 --> 47:54.820
 to trigger all these systems that have to be brought

47:54.820 --> 47:58.540
 into play if the animal is gonna engage in aggression

47:58.540 --> 48:01.400
 because aggression is a very risky thing

48:01.400 --> 48:03.060
 for an animal to engage in.

48:03.060 --> 48:06.800
 It could wind up losing and it could wind up getting killed

48:06.800 --> 48:10.340
 and so its brain constantly has to make

48:10.340 --> 48:13.400
 a cost benefit analysis of whether to continue

48:13.400 --> 48:16.460
 on that path or to back off as well.

48:16.460 --> 48:19.620
 And I think that part of this broadcasting function

48:19.620 --> 48:24.620
 of this region is engaging all these other brain domains

48:24.620 --> 48:29.320
 that play a role in this kind of cost benefit analysis.

48:29.320 --> 48:31.380
 I wanna talk more about mating behavior,

48:31.380 --> 48:35.180
 but as a segue to that, as we're talking about aggression

48:35.180 --> 48:38.440
 and mating behavior, I think hormones.

48:38.440 --> 48:41.020
 And whenever there's an opportunity on this podcast

48:41.020 --> 48:44.700
 to shatter a common myth, I grab it.

48:44.700 --> 48:46.860
 One of the common myths that's out there

48:46.860 --> 48:49.940
 and I think that persists is that testosterone

48:49.940 --> 48:52.780
 makes animals and humans aggressive

48:52.780 --> 48:56.820
 and estrogen makes animals placid and kind or emotional.

48:56.820 --> 48:59.100
 And as we both know, nothing could be further

48:59.100 --> 49:01.300
 from the truth, although there's some truth to the idea

49:01.300 --> 49:03.880
 that these hormones are all involved.

49:03.880 --> 49:08.340
 Robert Sapolsky supplied some information to me

49:08.340 --> 49:11.380
 when he came on this podcast that if you give people

49:11.380 --> 49:13.620
 exogenous testosterone, it tends to make them more

49:13.620 --> 49:15.500
 of the way they were before.

49:15.500 --> 49:17.600
 If they were a jerk before, they'll become more of a jerk.

49:17.600 --> 49:20.100
 If they were very altruistic, they'll become more altruistic.

49:20.100 --> 49:22.420
 And then eventually I pointed out you'll aromatize

49:22.420 --> 49:23.820
 that testosterone and estrogen

49:23.820 --> 49:25.080
 and you'll start getting opposite effects.

49:25.080 --> 49:28.000
 So it's a murky space, it's not straightforward.

49:28.000 --> 49:32.140
 But if I'm not mistaken, testosterone plays a role

49:32.140 --> 49:33.460
 in generating aggression.

49:33.460 --> 49:38.180
 However, the specific hormones that are involved

49:38.180 --> 49:43.180
 in generating aggression via VMH are things other

49:43.180 --> 49:44.300
 than testosterone.

49:44.300 --> 49:45.620
 Can you tell us a little bit more about that?

49:45.620 --> 49:47.740
 Because there's some interesting surprises in there.

49:47.740 --> 49:50.220
 Yeah, that's a really important question.

49:50.220 --> 49:55.220
 So when we finally identified the neurons in VMH

49:55.420 --> 49:58.840
 that control aggression with a molecular marker,

49:58.840 --> 50:02.660
 we found out that that marker was the estrogen receptor.

50:02.660 --> 50:05.100
 So that might strike you as a little strange.

50:05.100 --> 50:10.100
 Why should aggression promoting neurons in male mice

50:10.100 --> 50:13.540
 be labeled with the estrogen receptor?

50:13.540 --> 50:17.340
 Other labs have shown that the estrogen receptor

50:17.340 --> 50:20.980
 in adult male mice is necessary for aggression.

50:20.980 --> 50:24.940
 If you knock out the gene in VMH, they don't fight.

50:24.940 --> 50:27.380
 And it's been shown, and a lot of this is work

50:27.380 --> 50:29.900
 from your colleague Nirav Shah at Stanford,

50:29.900 --> 50:32.740
 who is one of my former PhD students,

50:32.740 --> 50:37.740
 that if you castrate a mouse and it loses the ability

50:37.740 --> 50:41.840
 to fight, not only can you rescue fighting

50:41.840 --> 50:44.960
 with a testosterone implant, but you can rescue it

50:44.960 --> 50:46.780
 with an estrogen implant.

50:46.780 --> 50:50.040
 So you can bypass completely the requirement

50:50.040 --> 50:54.040
 for testosterone to restore aggressiveness to the mice.

50:54.040 --> 50:57.400
 And as you say, it's because many of the effects

50:57.400 --> 51:00.840
 of testosterone, although not all, many of them

51:00.840 --> 51:04.620
 are mediated by its conversion to estrogen

51:04.620 --> 51:07.400
 by a process called aromatization.

51:07.400 --> 51:10.960
 It's carried out by an enzyme called aromatase.

51:10.960 --> 51:13.580
 In fact, people may have, most of your listeners

51:13.580 --> 51:17.600
 may have heard of aromatase, because aromatase inhibitors

51:17.600 --> 51:20.560
 are widely used in female humans

51:20.560 --> 51:23.600
 as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

51:23.600 --> 51:28.600
 They are a way of reducing the production of estrogen

51:28.840 --> 51:31.000
 by preventing testosterone

51:31.000 --> 51:33.240
 from being converted into estrogen.

51:33.240 --> 51:35.360
 And in fact, there are a lot of animal experiments

51:35.360 --> 51:38.920
 showing if you give males aromatase inhibitors,

51:38.920 --> 51:42.240
 they stop fighting as well as also stop

51:42.240 --> 51:44.880
 being sexually active.

51:44.880 --> 51:48.480
 And so that's one of the counterintuitive ideas.

51:48.480 --> 51:52.380
 And Nirao has shown that progesterone also seems

51:52.380 --> 51:54.160
 to play a role in aggression,

51:54.160 --> 51:57.060
 because these aggression neurons also express

51:57.060 --> 51:58.660
 the progesterone receptor.

51:58.660 --> 52:02.200
 So here are two hormones that are classically thought of

52:02.200 --> 52:04.680
 as female reproductive hormones.

52:04.680 --> 52:08.120
 This is what goes up and goes down during the estrus cycle,

52:08.120 --> 52:10.080
 estrogen and progesterone,

52:10.080 --> 52:13.360
 and yet they're playing a very important role

52:13.360 --> 52:17.200
 in controlling aggression in male mice,

52:17.200 --> 52:20.000
 and presumably in male humans as well.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.280
 Fascinating.

52:21.280 --> 52:24.760
 So estrogen is doing many more things

52:24.760 --> 52:26.420
 than I think most people believe,

52:26.420 --> 52:29.500
 and testosterone is doing maybe different

52:29.500 --> 52:32.120
 and fewer things in some cases and more in others.

52:32.120 --> 52:35.920
 I've known some aggressive females

52:35.920 --> 52:38.480
 over the time I've been alive.

52:38.480 --> 52:41.280
 What's involved in female aggression that's unique

52:41.280 --> 52:43.920
 from the pathways that generate male aggression?

52:43.920 --> 52:45.720
 Great, great question.

52:45.720 --> 52:49.160
 So we and other labs have studied this

52:49.160 --> 52:52.500
 in both mice and also in fruit flies.

52:52.500 --> 52:56.880
 So one thing in mice that distinguishes aggression

52:56.880 --> 52:59.160
 in females from males is that male mice

52:59.160 --> 53:02.240
 are pretty much ready to fight at the drop of a hat.

53:02.240 --> 53:07.240
 Female mice only fight when they are nurturing

53:08.040 --> 53:11.800
 and nursing their pups after they've delivered a litter,

53:11.800 --> 53:13.660
 and there's a window there

53:13.660 --> 53:16.600
 where they become hyper aggressive,

53:16.600 --> 53:19.160
 and then after their pups are weaned,

53:19.160 --> 53:20.700
 that aggressiveness goes away.

53:20.700 --> 53:23.200
 So this is pretty remarkable

53:23.200 --> 53:25.960
 that you take a virgin female mouse

53:25.960 --> 53:27.600
 and expose it to a male,

53:27.600 --> 53:30.640
 and her response is to become sexually receptive

53:30.640 --> 53:32.040
 and to mate with him,

53:32.040 --> 53:34.560
 and now you let her have her pups

53:34.560 --> 53:37.520
 and you put the same male or another male mouse

53:37.520 --> 53:38.540
 in the cage with her,

53:38.540 --> 53:41.640
 and instead of trying to mate with him, she attacks him.

53:41.640 --> 53:44.920
 So there is some presumably hormonal

53:44.920 --> 53:49.080
 and also neuronal switch that's occurring in the brain

53:49.080 --> 53:52.120
 that switches the response of the female

53:52.120 --> 53:55.040
 from sex to aggression

53:55.040 --> 53:57.640
 when she goes from virginity to maternity,

53:57.640 --> 53:59.740
 and we recently showed in a paper,

53:59.740 --> 54:03.140
 this is work from one of my students, Mungu Liu,

54:03.140 --> 54:05.560
 that within VMH in females,

54:05.560 --> 54:09.960
 there are two clearly divisible subsets

54:09.960 --> 54:12.660
 of estrogen receptor neurons,

54:12.660 --> 54:17.120
 and she showed that one of those subsets controls fighting

54:17.120 --> 54:19.400
 and the other one controls mating,

54:19.400 --> 54:21.120
 and in fact, if you stimulate

54:21.120 --> 54:24.960
 the fighting-specific subset in a virgin,

54:24.960 --> 54:27.160
 you can get the virgin to attack,

54:27.160 --> 54:31.240
 which is something that we were never able to do before,

54:31.240 --> 54:34.580
 and if you stimulate the mating one, you enhance mating.

54:34.580 --> 54:37.040
 The reason we could never get these results

54:37.040 --> 54:39.960
 when we stimulated the whole population

54:39.960 --> 54:41.560
 of estrogen receptor neurons

54:41.560 --> 54:45.320
 is that these effects are opposite and they cancel out,

54:45.320 --> 54:49.120
 and so it turns out that if you measure the activity

54:49.120 --> 54:51.380
 of the fighting and the mating neurons

54:51.380 --> 54:55.240
 going from a virgin to a maternal female,

54:55.240 --> 54:58.360
 the aggression neurons are very low

54:58.360 --> 55:01.180
 in their activity in the virgin,

55:01.180 --> 55:04.160
 but once the female has pups,

55:04.160 --> 55:08.800
 the activation ability of those neurons goes way up

55:08.800 --> 55:11.060
 and the mating neurons stay the same,

55:11.060 --> 55:14.720
 so if you think of the balance between them like a seesaw,

55:14.720 --> 55:19.080
 in the virgin, there is more activity in the mating neurons

55:19.080 --> 55:20.440
 than in the fighting neurons,

55:20.440 --> 55:23.040
 whereas in the nursing mother,

55:23.040 --> 55:25.720
 there's more activity or more activation

55:25.720 --> 55:29.000
 in the other way around, the fighting neurons in the mating.

55:29.000 --> 55:31.240
 Did I say fighting and mating in the first?

55:31.240 --> 55:33.920
 Mating neurons dominate fighting in the virgin,

55:33.920 --> 55:37.500
 fighting neurons dominate mating in the mother,

55:37.500 --> 55:41.720
 so that's a really cool observation,

55:41.720 --> 55:44.200
 and it's not something that happens in males,

55:44.200 --> 55:48.440
 and we don't know what causes that or controls that.

55:48.440 --> 55:52.640
 Interestingly, this gets into the whole issue

55:52.640 --> 55:57.180
 of neurons that are present in females but not in males,

55:57.180 --> 56:00.560
 so we've known for, the field has known for a long time

56:00.560 --> 56:04.760
 that male and female fruit flies have sex-specific neurons,

56:04.760 --> 56:07.380
 and most of the neurons that we've identified

56:07.380 --> 56:10.440
 in fruit flies that control fighting in males

56:10.440 --> 56:11.760
 are male-specific.

56:11.760 --> 56:14.400
 They're not found in the female brain,

56:14.400 --> 56:18.800
 but recently, we discovered a set of female-specific

56:18.800 --> 56:21.620
 fighting neurons in the female brain,

56:21.620 --> 56:24.600
 together with a couple of other laboratories.

56:24.600 --> 56:28.900
 Now, they do share one common population of neurons

56:28.900 --> 56:31.240
 in both male and female flies

56:31.240 --> 56:34.480
 that in females activates the female-specific

56:34.480 --> 56:37.160
 fighting neurons and in males activates

56:37.160 --> 56:38.900
 the male-specific fighting neurons,

56:38.900 --> 56:42.720
 so it's kind of a hierarchy with this common neuron on top,

56:42.720 --> 56:46.560
 and in mice, we discovered that there are

56:46.560 --> 56:49.760
 male-specific neurons in VMH,

56:49.760 --> 56:54.160
 and those neurons are activated during male aggression.

56:54.160 --> 56:57.040
 Now, the neurons that are active in females

56:57.040 --> 57:01.020
 when females fight in VMH are not sex-specific,

57:01.020 --> 57:03.920
 so they are also found in males,

57:03.920 --> 57:06.420
 so this is already showing you some complexity.

57:06.420 --> 57:10.480
 The male mouse VMH has both male-specific

57:10.480 --> 57:13.920
 aggression neurons and generic aggression neurons,

57:13.920 --> 57:17.080
 and then the female VMH, the mating cells,

57:17.080 --> 57:18.760
 are only found in females.

57:18.760 --> 57:22.320
 They are female-specific and not found in the male brain,

57:22.320 --> 57:23.880
 and so we're trying to find out

57:23.880 --> 57:27.320
 what these sex-specific populations of neurons are doing,

57:27.320 --> 57:30.760
 but that indicates that that is some of the mechanism

57:30.760 --> 57:34.160
 by which different sexes show different behaviors.

57:34.160 --> 57:36.920
 I'm fixated on this transition

57:36.920 --> 57:39.760
 from the virgin female mouse to the maternal female mouse,

57:39.760 --> 57:42.500
 I have a couple of questions about whether or not,

57:42.500 --> 57:45.260
 for instance, the transition is governed

57:45.260 --> 57:46.440
 by the presence of pups.

57:46.440 --> 57:48.080
 So for instance, if you take a virgin female,

57:48.080 --> 57:49.280
 she'll mate with a male.

57:50.140 --> 57:53.360
 Once she's had pups, she'll try and fight that male

57:53.360 --> 57:56.280
 or presumably another intruder female, right?

57:56.280 --> 57:59.040
 Equally towards females and male intruders.

57:59.040 --> 58:00.980
 Does that require the presence of her pups,

58:00.980 --> 58:02.420
 meaning if you were to take those pups

58:02.420 --> 58:03.960
 and give them to another mother,

58:03.960 --> 58:06.720
 does she revert to the more virgin-like behavior?

58:06.720 --> 58:09.160
 Is it related to, is it triggered by lactation

58:09.160 --> 58:10.980
 or could it actually be triggered

58:10.980 --> 58:12.660
 by the mating behavior itself?

58:12.660 --> 58:16.060
 Because it's possible for the virgin to become a non-virgin,

58:16.060 --> 58:18.280
 but not actually have a litter of pups.

58:18.280 --> 58:20.560
 Right, those are all great questions

58:20.560 --> 58:23.480
 and we don't know the answer to most of them.

58:23.480 --> 58:27.360
 What I can say is that a nursing mother

58:27.360 --> 58:30.640
 doesn't have to have her pups with her in the cage

58:30.640 --> 58:35.420
 in order to attack an intruder male or an intruder female.

58:35.420 --> 58:40.180
 She is just in a state of brain

58:40.180 --> 58:43.420
 that makes her aggressive to any intruder.

58:43.420 --> 58:47.200
 And those aggression neurons in that female's brain

58:47.200 --> 58:51.860
 are activated by both male and female intruders equally.

58:51.860 --> 58:54.920
 Whereas in male mice, the aggression neurons

58:54.920 --> 58:59.140
 are only ever activated by males, not by females,

58:59.140 --> 59:02.380
 because males are never supposed to attack females.

59:02.380 --> 59:04.580
 They're only supposed to mate with them.

59:04.580 --> 59:07.300
 So that's another difference in how those neurons

59:07.300 --> 59:11.580
 are tuned to signals from different conspecifics.

59:11.580 --> 59:13.860
 Does it require lactation?

59:13.860 --> 59:15.420
 I don't know the answer to that.

59:15.420 --> 59:17.300
 I think there are some experiments

59:17.300 --> 59:20.420
 where people have tried to, classical experiments,

59:20.420 --> 59:24.540
 people have tried to reproduce the changes in hormones

59:24.540 --> 59:28.060
 that occur during pregnancy in female rats

59:28.060 --> 59:30.180
 to see if it can make them aggressive.

59:30.180 --> 59:33.820
 And some of those manipulations do to some extent,

59:33.820 --> 59:36.140
 but there's a whole biology there

59:36.140 --> 59:38.300
 that remains to be explored

59:38.300 --> 59:40.700
 about how much of this is hormones,

59:40.700 --> 59:43.840
 how much of this is circuitry and electricity,

59:43.840 --> 59:46.580
 and how much of it is other factors

59:46.580 --> 59:48.680
 that we haven't identified yet.

59:48.680 --> 59:50.060
 I don't want to anthropomorphize,

59:50.060 --> 59:52.900
 but well, I'll just ask the question.

59:52.900 --> 59:56.500
 So the other day I was watching ferrets mate, right?

59:56.500 --> 1:00:00.620
 Mustelids, they're mustelids and they're mating behavior.

1:00:00.620 --> 1:00:02.260
 I guess I didn't say why I was watching this.

1:00:02.260 --> 1:00:05.940
 Doesn't matter, it simply doesn't matter.

1:00:05.940 --> 1:00:08.460
 But if one observes the mating behaviors

1:00:08.460 --> 1:00:09.580
 of different animals,

1:00:09.580 --> 1:00:11.320
 we know that there's a tremendous range

1:00:11.320 --> 1:00:13.400
 of mating behaviors in humans.

1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:15.500
 There can be no aggressive component,

1:00:15.500 --> 1:00:16.580
 there could be aggressive component.

1:00:16.580 --> 1:00:19.800
 Humans have all sorts of kinks and fetishes and behaviors,

1:00:19.800 --> 1:00:21.780
 and most of which probably has never been documented

1:00:21.780 --> 1:00:23.700
 because most of this happens in private.

1:00:23.700 --> 1:00:24.980
 And here I always say on this podcast,

1:00:24.980 --> 1:00:27.540
 anytime we're talking about sexual behavior in humans,

1:00:27.540 --> 1:00:28.780
 we're always making the presumption

1:00:28.780 --> 1:00:31.320
 that it's consensual, age appropriate,

1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:33.380
 context appropriate, and species appropriate.

1:00:33.380 --> 1:00:35.520
 Let's say we're talking about a lot of different species.

1:00:35.520 --> 1:00:38.940
 With that said, just to set context,

1:00:38.940 --> 1:00:41.900
 I was watching this video of ferrets mating

1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:44.500
 and it's quite violent actually.

1:00:44.500 --> 1:00:47.260
 There's a lot of neck biting, there's a lot of squealing.

1:00:47.260 --> 1:00:49.380
 If I were going to project an anthropomorphize,

1:00:49.380 --> 1:00:52.380
 I'd say it's not really clear they both want to be there.

1:00:53.740 --> 1:00:54.860
 One would make that assumption.

1:00:54.860 --> 1:00:57.100
 And of course we don't know, we have no idea.

1:00:57.100 --> 1:00:58.620
 This could be the ritual.

1:00:58.620 --> 1:01:02.740
 But it seems to me that there is some crossover

1:01:02.740 --> 1:01:06.460
 of aggression and mating behavior circuitry

1:01:06.460 --> 1:01:08.580
 during the act of mating.

1:01:08.580 --> 1:01:12.020
 And do you think that reflects this sort of

1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:15.780
 stew of competing neurons

1:01:15.780 --> 1:01:19.120
 that are prioritizing in real time?

1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:22.420
 Because of course, as states, they have persistence,

1:01:22.420 --> 1:01:23.260
 as you point out.

1:01:23.260 --> 1:01:25.220
 And you can imagine that states overlapping

1:01:25.220 --> 1:01:27.740
 in four different states, the motivational drive to mate,

1:01:27.740 --> 1:01:30.340
 the motivational drive to get away from this experience,

1:01:30.340 --> 1:01:34.660
 the motivational drive to eat at some point,

1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:35.900
 to defecate at some point,

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:37.420
 all of these things are competing.

1:01:37.420 --> 1:01:41.280
 And what we're really seeing is a bias in probabilities.

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:44.100
 But when you look at mating behavior of various animals,

1:01:44.100 --> 1:01:47.760
 you see an aggressive component sometimes, but not always.

1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:49.260
 Is it species specific?

1:01:49.260 --> 1:01:51.260
 Is it context specific?

1:01:51.260 --> 1:01:54.900
 And more generally, do you think that there is crosstalk

1:01:54.900 --> 1:01:57.100
 between these different neuronal populations

1:01:57.100 --> 1:01:58.940
 and the animal itself might be kind of confused

1:01:58.940 --> 1:01:59.980
 about what's going on?

1:01:59.980 --> 1:02:02.300
 Right, great, great questions.

1:02:02.300 --> 1:02:04.180
 I can't really speak to the issue

1:02:04.180 --> 1:02:06.500
 of whether this is species specific

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:09.240
 because I'm not a naturalist or a zoologist.

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:11.620
 I've seen, like you have, in the wild,

1:02:11.620 --> 1:02:14.020
 for example, lions when they mate.

1:02:14.020 --> 1:02:15.180
 I've seen them in Africa.

1:02:15.180 --> 1:02:18.500
 There's often a biting component of that as well.

1:02:18.500 --> 1:02:20.620
 One of the things that surprised us

1:02:20.620 --> 1:02:24.440
 when we identified neurons in VMHVL

1:02:24.440 --> 1:02:27.260
 that control aggression in males

1:02:27.260 --> 1:02:29.940
 is that within that population,

1:02:29.940 --> 1:02:34.820
 there is a subset of neurons that is activated by females

1:02:34.820 --> 1:02:37.380
 during male-female mating encounters.

1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:42.380
 Now, you don't generally think of mouse sex as rough sex,

1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:48.400
 but there is a lot of what superficially looks

1:02:48.420 --> 1:02:50.520
 like violent behavior sometimes,

1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:54.940
 especially if the female rejects the male and runs away.

1:02:54.940 --> 1:02:57.420
 And there's some evidence

1:02:57.420 --> 1:03:02.020
 that those female selective neurons in VMH

1:03:02.020 --> 1:03:06.460
 are part of the mating behavior.

1:03:06.460 --> 1:03:10.100
 If you shut them down, the animals don't mate

1:03:10.100 --> 1:03:13.260
 as effectively as they otherwise would.

1:03:13.260 --> 1:03:15.500
 What happens when you stimulate them?

1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:17.660
 We don't yet know because we don't have a way

1:03:17.660 --> 1:03:20.860
 to specifically do that without activating

1:03:20.860 --> 1:03:22.820
 the male aggression neurons.

1:03:22.820 --> 1:03:26.460
 But I think they must be there for a reason

1:03:26.460 --> 1:03:30.420
 because VMH is not traditionally the brain region

1:03:30.420 --> 1:03:34.140
 to which male sexual behavior has been assigned.

1:03:34.140 --> 1:03:38.020
 That's another area called the medial preoptic area.

1:03:38.020 --> 1:03:41.100
 And there we have shown that there are neurons

1:03:41.100 --> 1:03:44.120
 that definitely stimulate mating behavior.

1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:46.980
 In fact, if we activate those mating neurons

1:03:46.980 --> 1:03:48.740
 in a male while it's in the middle

1:03:48.740 --> 1:03:52.460
 of attacking another male, it will stop fighting,

1:03:52.460 --> 1:03:55.400
 start singing to that male and start to try

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:58.900
 to mount that male until we shut those neurons off.

1:03:58.900 --> 1:04:02.260
 So those are the make love not war neurons

1:04:02.260 --> 1:04:05.460
 and VMH are the make war not love neurons.

1:04:05.460 --> 1:04:08.140
 And there are dense interconnections

1:04:08.140 --> 1:04:10.500
 between these two nuclei,

1:04:10.500 --> 1:04:13.740
 which are very close to each other in the brain.

1:04:13.740 --> 1:04:16.380
 And we've shown that some of those connections

1:04:16.380 --> 1:04:20.340
 are mutually inhibitory to prevent the animal

1:04:20.340 --> 1:04:24.780
 from attacking a mate that it's supposed to be mating with

1:04:24.780 --> 1:04:28.500
 or to prevent it from mating with an animal

1:04:28.500 --> 1:04:29.980
 it's supposed to be attacking.

1:04:29.980 --> 1:04:32.180
 But it's also possible that there are

1:04:32.180 --> 1:04:36.260
 some cooperative interactions between those structures

1:04:36.260 --> 1:04:39.960
 as well as antagonistic interactions

1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:42.900
 and the balance of whether it's the cooperative

1:04:42.900 --> 1:04:46.140
 or antagonistic interactions that are firing

1:04:46.140 --> 1:04:49.060
 at any given moment in a mating encounter,

1:04:49.060 --> 1:04:54.060
 as you suggest, may determine whether a moment

1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:59.180
 of coital bliss among two lions may suddenly turn

1:05:00.460 --> 1:05:04.480
 into a snap or a growl and a bearing of fangs.

1:05:04.480 --> 1:05:07.840
 We don't know that, but certainly the substrate,

1:05:07.840 --> 1:05:10.980
 the wiring is there for that to happen.

1:05:10.980 --> 1:05:14.100
 I'm sure people's minds are running wild with all this.

1:05:14.100 --> 1:05:16.780
 I'll just use this as an opportunity to raise something

1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:19.840
 I've wondered about for far too long,

1:05:19.840 --> 1:05:23.180
 which is I have a friend who's a psychiatrist

1:05:23.180 --> 1:05:25.540
 who works on the treatment of fetishes.

1:05:25.540 --> 1:05:27.660
 This is not a psychiatrist that I was treated by.

1:05:27.660 --> 1:05:29.260
 I'll just point that out.

1:05:29.260 --> 1:05:32.100
 But they mentioned something very interesting to me

1:05:32.100 --> 1:05:36.140
 long ago, which is that when you look at true fetishes

1:05:36.140 --> 1:05:38.180
 and what meets the criteria for fetish,

1:05:38.180 --> 1:05:40.820
 that there does seem to be some,

1:05:40.820 --> 1:05:43.780
 what one would think would be competing circuitry

1:05:43.780 --> 1:05:46.940
 that suddenly becomes aligned.

1:05:46.940 --> 1:05:51.940
 For instance, avoidance of feces, dead bodies, feet,

1:05:52.820 --> 1:05:55.120
 things that are very infectious.

1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:58.820
 Typically, those states of disgust are antagonistic

1:05:58.820 --> 1:06:03.820
 to states of desire, as one would hope is present

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:05.720
 during sexual behavior.

1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:09.660
 Fetishes often involve exactly those things

1:06:09.660 --> 1:06:14.660
 that are aversive, feet, dead bodies,

1:06:15.060 --> 1:06:17.500
 disgusting things to most people.

1:06:17.500 --> 1:06:20.000
 And true fetishes in the pathologic sense

1:06:21.220 --> 1:06:24.840
 exist when people have basically a requirement

1:06:24.840 --> 1:06:26.500
 for thinking about, or even the presence

1:06:26.500 --> 1:06:29.500
 of those ordinarily disgusting things

1:06:29.500 --> 1:06:31.420
 in order to become sexually aroused,

1:06:31.420 --> 1:06:33.760
 as if the circuitry has crossed over.

1:06:33.760 --> 1:06:35.940
 And the statement that rung in my mind was

1:06:35.940 --> 1:06:39.500
 people don't develop fetishes to mailboxes

1:06:39.500 --> 1:06:44.220
 or to the color red or to random objects and things.

1:06:44.220 --> 1:06:47.220
 They develop fetishes to things that are highly infectious

1:06:47.220 --> 1:06:50.140
 and counter reproductive, repetitive states.

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:51.900
 So I find that interesting.

1:06:51.900 --> 1:06:53.820
 I don't know if you have any reflections on that

1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:55.660
 as to why that might be.

1:06:55.660 --> 1:06:57.980
 I'm tempted to ask whether or not you've ever observed

1:06:57.980 --> 1:06:59.420
 fetish-like behavior in mice,

1:06:59.420 --> 1:07:02.460
 but I find it fascinating that you have this area

1:07:02.460 --> 1:07:04.840
 of the brain that's so highly conserved, the hypothalamus,

1:07:04.840 --> 1:07:06.980
 which you have these dense populations intermixed

1:07:06.980 --> 1:07:09.820
 and that the addition of a forebrain,

1:07:09.820 --> 1:07:12.860
 especially in humans that can think and make decisions

1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:15.860
 could in some ways facilitate the expression

1:07:15.860 --> 1:07:16.960
 of these primitive behaviors,

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:19.140
 but could also complicate the expression

1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:20.540
 of primitive behaviors.

1:07:20.540 --> 1:07:22.700
 Right, I would agree.

1:07:22.700 --> 1:07:26.100
 I think one way of looking at fetishes

1:07:26.100 --> 1:07:28.660
 from a neurobiological standpoint

1:07:28.660 --> 1:07:33.660
 is that they represent a kind of repetitive conditioning

1:07:33.660 --> 1:07:38.660
 where something that is natively aversive or disgusting

1:07:39.440 --> 1:07:44.440
 by being repeatedly paired with a rewarding experience

1:07:44.880 --> 1:07:49.140
 changes its valence, its sign,

1:07:49.140 --> 1:07:54.140
 so that now it somehow produces the anticipation of reward

1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:57.840
 the next time a person sees it.

1:07:57.840 --> 1:07:58.720
 Now, I don't know how,

1:07:58.720 --> 1:08:01.160
 I don't know that literature in animals,

1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:04.760
 so I don't know if you could condition a mouse

1:08:04.760 --> 1:08:06.480
 to eat feces, for example,

1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:10.320
 although there are animals that are naturally coprophagic.

1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:14.680
 That is, and maybe mice do that occasionally, I'm not sure,

1:08:14.680 --> 1:08:18.080
 but that is one way to think about it,

1:08:18.080 --> 1:08:20.880
 and that could certainly involve in humans

1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:23.360
 the more recently evolved parts of the brain,

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:27.360
 the cortex that is sort of orchestrating

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:29.920
 both what behaviors are happening

1:08:29.920 --> 1:08:33.320
 and whether reward states are turning on

1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:37.040
 in association with those behaviors that are happening,

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:41.240
 and that's the part that I think is difficult

1:08:41.240 --> 1:08:44.340
 and challenging to study in a mouse,

1:08:44.340 --> 1:08:48.280
 but certainly bears thinking about

1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:50.820
 because it's a really interesting,

1:08:50.820 --> 1:08:53.760
 again, sort of counterintuitive aspect,

1:08:53.760 --> 1:08:55.000
 again, like rough sex,

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.040
 people that want to have fighting or violence

1:08:58.040 --> 1:09:01.080
 or aggressiveness in order to be sexually aroused

1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:03.760
 and fetishes, and in fact,

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:05.800
 when we made that discovery initially,

1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:08.060
 it raised the question in my mind

1:09:08.060 --> 1:09:13.060
 whether some people that are serial rapists,

1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:16.800
 for example, and engage in sexual violence

1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:20.920
 might in some level have their wires crossed in some way

1:09:20.920 --> 1:09:23.680
 that these states that are supposed to be

1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:26.880
 pretty much separated and mutually antagonistic

1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:31.480
 are not and are actually more rewarding and reinforcing.

1:09:31.480 --> 1:09:33.880
 I think it's gonna be a long time

1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:36.000
 before we have figured it out,

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:37.800
 but when you think about it,

1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:41.440
 there is no treatment that we have

1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:46.440
 for a violent sexual offender that eliminates the violence,

1:09:46.600 --> 1:09:50.600
 but not the sexual desire and sexual urge,

1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:54.820
 whether it's physical castration or chemical castration,

1:09:54.820 --> 1:09:57.280
 it eliminates both.

1:09:57.280 --> 1:09:59.280
 Definitely an area that I think,

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:03.440
 well, human neuroscience in general needs a lot of tools,

1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:06.800
 in terms of how to probe and manipulate neural circuitry.

1:10:06.800 --> 1:10:09.740
 I'd love to turn to this area that you mentioned,

1:10:09.740 --> 1:10:12.020
 the medial preoptic area.

1:10:12.020 --> 1:10:15.040
 I'm fascinated by it because just as within the VMH,

1:10:15.040 --> 1:10:19.140
 you have these neurons for mating and fighting or aggression,

1:10:19.140 --> 1:10:21.660
 my understanding is medial preoptic area

1:10:21.660 --> 1:10:24.840
 contains neurons for mating, but also for

1:10:24.840 --> 1:10:26.360
 temperature regulation.

1:10:26.360 --> 1:10:28.480
 And perhaps I'm making too much of a leap here,

1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:31.040
 but I've always wondered about this phrase in heat.

1:10:32.040 --> 1:10:37.000
 As certainly the menstrual or estrous cycle in females

1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:38.880
 is related to changes in body temperature.

1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:40.560
 In fact, measuring body temperature is one way

1:10:40.560 --> 1:10:44.840
 that women can fairly reliably predict ovulation, et cetera.

1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:48.380
 Although additional, this is not a show about contraception,

1:10:48.380 --> 1:10:50.560
 please rely on multiple methods as necessary.

1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:54.320
 Don't use this discussion as your guide for contraception

1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:55.360
 based on temperature.

1:10:55.360 --> 1:10:58.200
 But if you stimulate certain neurons

1:10:58.200 --> 1:10:59.360
 in the medial preoptic area,

1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:02.600
 you can trigger dramatic changes in body temperature

1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:06.160
 and or mating behavior.

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:07.480
 What's the relationship, if any,

1:11:07.480 --> 1:11:10.680
 between temperature and mating, or do we simply not know?

1:11:11.640 --> 1:11:15.160
 I don't know what the relationship is

1:11:15.160 --> 1:11:18.800
 between temperature and mating neurons

1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:20.960
 in the preoptic area.

1:11:20.960 --> 1:11:25.360
 I suspect that they are different populations of neurons

1:11:25.360 --> 1:11:29.840
 because it's become pretty clear that the preoptic area

1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:32.560
 has many different subsets of neurons

1:11:32.560 --> 1:11:36.200
 that are specifically active during different behaviors,

1:11:36.200 --> 1:11:38.780
 even different phases of mating behavior.

1:11:38.780 --> 1:11:40.560
 So there are mounting neurons,

1:11:40.560 --> 1:11:43.160
 there are intermission, thrusting neurons,

1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:46.080
 and ejaculation neurons, and sniffing neurons.

1:11:46.080 --> 1:11:48.640
 Wait, wait, so I think I've heard this before,

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:50.240
 but I just wanna make sure that people get this,

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:51.440
 and I wanna make sure I get this.

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:55.540
 So you're telling me within the medial preoptic area,

1:11:55.540 --> 1:11:57.840
 there are specific neurons that if you stimulate them

1:11:57.840 --> 1:12:00.800
 will make males thrust as if they're mating?

1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:05.800
 No, so this is not based on stimulation experiments.

1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:08.940
 It's based on imaging experiments right now

1:12:08.940 --> 1:12:11.840
 that we see when we look in the preoptic area

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:14.140
 at what neurons are active

1:12:14.140 --> 1:12:17.280
 during different phases of aggression,

1:12:17.280 --> 1:12:19.280
 we see that there are different neurons

1:12:19.280 --> 1:12:21.480
 that are active during sniffing,

1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:24.920
 mounting, thrusting, and ejaculation,

1:12:24.920 --> 1:12:28.040
 and they become repeatedly activated

1:12:28.040 --> 1:12:30.280
 each time the animal goes through that cycle.

1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:31.120
 During mating.

1:12:31.120 --> 1:12:32.920
 During the mating cycle.

1:12:32.920 --> 1:12:34.400
 There are also some neurons there

1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:37.400
 that are active during aggression, which are distinct,

1:12:37.400 --> 1:12:40.480
 and we don't know whether those neurons are there

1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:44.660
 to promote aggression or to inhibit mating

1:12:44.660 --> 1:12:46.240
 when animals are fighting.

1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:49.560
 We have some evidence that suggests it may be the latter,

1:12:49.560 --> 1:12:51.440
 but we don't know for sure yet.

1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:54.240
 The thermosensitive neurons are really interesting

1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:57.480
 because you mentioned the phrase in heat,

1:12:57.480 --> 1:12:59.820
 and then in the context of aggression,

1:12:59.820 --> 1:13:02.960
 you talk about hot-blooded people or hotheads.

1:13:02.960 --> 1:13:04.760
 There's just recently a paper showing

1:13:04.760 --> 1:13:08.900
 there are thermoregulatory neurons in VMH as well.

1:13:08.900 --> 1:13:13.560
 So all of these homeostatic systems for metabolic control

1:13:13.560 --> 1:13:18.560
 and temperature control are intermingled in these nuclei,

1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:22.900
 these zones that control these basic survival behaviors

1:13:22.900 --> 1:13:26.900
 like mating and aggression and predator defense.

1:13:26.900 --> 1:13:31.280
 And I would imagine that the thermoregulation

1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:35.560
 is tightly connected to energy expenditure

1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:39.180
 and that, again, these neurons are mixed together

1:13:39.180 --> 1:13:43.080
 to facilitate integration of all these signals

1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:46.640
 by the brain in some way that we don't understand

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:48.520
 to maintain the proper balance

1:13:48.520 --> 1:13:53.520
 between energy conservation and energy consumption

1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:56.800
 during this particular behavior or that behavior.

1:13:56.800 --> 1:13:58.980
 I mean, I've always been fascinated by the question,

1:13:58.980 --> 1:14:03.040
 why is it that violence goes up in the summertime

1:14:03.040 --> 1:14:04.840
 when the temperatures are high?

1:14:04.840 --> 1:14:08.400
 Does it really have something to do with the idea

1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:12.080
 that increased temperature increases violence?

1:14:12.080 --> 1:14:15.360
 Seems hard to believe because we're homeothermic

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:20.360
 and we pretty much stay around 98.6 Fahrenheit.

1:14:20.720 --> 1:14:23.640
 Could be other social reasons why that happens.

1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:25.600
 People are outside out on the street

1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:27.080
 bumping into each other.

1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:30.280
 But I think there could well be something

1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:34.040
 that ties thermoregulation to aggressiveness

1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:38.200
 as well as to mating behavior.

1:14:38.200 --> 1:14:39.160
 Fascinating, Gal.

1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:43.360
 I asked in the hopes that maybe in the years to come,

1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:46.400
 your lab will parse some of the temperature relationships.

1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:49.320
 And I realized it could be also regulated

1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:50.480
 by hormones in general.

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:51.880
 So it's tapping into two systems

1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:53.080
 for completely different reasons.

1:14:53.080 --> 1:14:57.000
 But anyway, an area that intrigues me

1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:58.600
 because of this notion of hotheadedness

1:14:58.600 --> 1:15:00.440
 or cool, common, collected.

1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:02.880
 And also the fact that,

1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:04.400
 I probably should have asked about this earlier,

1:15:04.400 --> 1:15:07.240
 that arousal itself is tethered

1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:09.640
 to the whole mating and reproductive process.

1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:12.040
 I mean, without a sort of seesawing back

1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:16.080
 between the sympathetic and parasympathetic arousal,

1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:19.520
 relaxed states, there is no mating that will take place.

1:15:20.760 --> 1:15:23.440
 So it's fascinating the way these different competing forces

1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:25.760
 and seesaws operate.

1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:27.920
 Several times during the discussion so far,

1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:32.920
 we've hit on this idea that the same behavior

1:15:32.940 --> 1:15:34.760
 can reflect different states

1:15:34.760 --> 1:15:38.400
 and different states can converge on multiple behaviors

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:39.380
 as well.

1:15:39.380 --> 1:15:42.420
 You had a paper not long ago about mounting behavior,

1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:45.520
 which I found fascinating.

1:15:45.520 --> 1:15:47.760
 Maybe you could tell us about that result

1:15:47.760 --> 1:15:49.800
 because to me, it really speaks to the fact

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:53.880
 that mounting behavior can in one context be sexual

1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.840
 and in another context actually be related

1:15:55.840 --> 1:15:57.960
 to we presume dominance.

1:15:57.960 --> 1:16:02.640
 And I think that my friends who practice jujitsu

1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:04.840
 will say they, when I talk about that result,

1:16:04.840 --> 1:16:05.880
 they say, of course, you know,

1:16:05.880 --> 1:16:08.800
 mounting the other person and dominating them,

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:10.200
 there's nothing sexual about it.

1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:12.380
 It's about overtaking them physically,

1:16:12.380 --> 1:16:14.320
 literally being on their next side

1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:17.480
 as opposed to on their own, lying on their own back.

1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:20.060
 Just fascinating, very primitive.

1:16:20.060 --> 1:16:23.060
 And yet I think speaks to this idea

1:16:23.060 --> 1:16:24.880
 that mounting behavior might be one

1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:27.680
 of the most fundamental ways in which animals

1:16:27.680 --> 1:16:30.840
 and perhaps even humans express dominance

1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:34.020
 and or sexual interactions.

1:16:34.020 --> 1:16:37.500
 Yep, that's a fascinating question.

1:16:37.500 --> 1:16:39.840
 And it was harder to figure out

1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:41.200
 than you might've thought.

1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:44.160
 So we've, there's been this debate for a long time

1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:48.700
 in the field when you see two male mice mounting each other,

1:16:48.700 --> 1:16:50.860
 is this homosexual behavior?

1:16:50.860 --> 1:16:54.280
 Is this a case of mistaken sexual identification

1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:56.400
 or is this dominance behavior?

1:16:56.400 --> 1:16:59.520
 And if you train an AI algorithm

1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:03.800
 to try to distinguish male-male mounting

1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:07.120
 from male-female mounting, it does not do a very good job

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:11.440
 because motorically those behaviors look so similar.

1:17:11.440 --> 1:17:16.320
 And so how did we wind up figuring out

1:17:16.320 --> 1:17:20.900
 that most male-male mounting is dominance mounting?

1:17:20.900 --> 1:17:24.040
 There are two important clues.

1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:26.880
 One is the context.

1:17:26.880 --> 1:17:29.640
 And so male-male mounting tends

1:17:29.640 --> 1:17:32.360
 to be more prominent among mice

1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:35.600
 when they haven't had a lot of fighting experience.

1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:40.420
 And then as they become more experienced in fighting,

1:17:40.420 --> 1:17:43.720
 they will show relatively less mounting

1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:46.080
 towards the other male and more attack.

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:50.140
 And they'll transition quickly from mounting to attack.

1:17:50.140 --> 1:17:54.560
 And so the mounting is always seen in this context

1:17:54.560 --> 1:17:58.000
 of an overall aggressive interaction.

1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:00.240
 And then the second thing, which believe it or not,

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:04.780
 was suggested by a computational theoretical person

1:18:04.780 --> 1:18:06.840
 in my lab, Anne Kennedy,

1:18:06.840 --> 1:18:09.160
 who now has her own lab at Northwestern.

1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:12.500
 She said, well, males are known to sing

1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:15.600
 when they mount females, ultrasonic vocalizations.

1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:18.960
 Why don't you see what kinds of songs they're singing

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:20.280
 when they're mounting males?

1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:21.800
 Maybe it's a different kind of song.

1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:25.120
 Well, what we found out is they don't sing at all

1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:26.880
 when they're mounting a male.

1:18:26.880 --> 1:18:31.880
 So you can easily distinguish whether mounting behavior

1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:36.880
 by a male mouse is reproductive or agonistic,

1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:40.200
 aggressive according to whether it's accompanied

1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:43.580
 by ultrasonic vocalizations or not.

1:18:43.580 --> 1:18:47.080
 And it turns out that different brain regions

1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:49.120
 are maximally active

1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:51.080
 during these different types of mounting.

1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:55.120
 So VMH, the aggression locus,

1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:58.380
 is actually active during dominance mounting,

1:18:58.380 --> 1:19:01.560
 and you can stimulate mounting if you,

1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:05.440
 dominance mounting, if you weakly activate VMH,

1:19:05.440 --> 1:19:08.880
 whereas MPOA is most strongly activated

1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:10.820
 during sexual mounting,

1:19:10.820 --> 1:19:12.800
 and that's always accompanied

1:19:12.800 --> 1:19:14.720
 by the ultrasonic vocalization.

1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:18.520
 So this shows how difficult and dangerous it can be

1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:23.360
 to try to infer an animal's state or intent or emotion

1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:25.840
 from the behavior that it's exhibiting,

1:19:25.840 --> 1:19:29.100
 because the same behavior can mean very different things

1:19:29.100 --> 1:19:30.480
 depending on the context

1:19:30.480 --> 1:19:32.160
 or the interaction with the animal.

1:19:32.160 --> 1:19:33.820
 And I would say even more so

1:19:33.820 --> 1:19:37.640
 with when that animal is a human or is multiple humans.

1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:38.480
 That's right.

1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:40.400
 And there are many examples.

1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:44.400
 Animals show chasing to obtain food,

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:47.060
 a prey animal that they're gonna kill and eat,

1:19:47.060 --> 1:19:49.840
 and they show chasing to obtain a mate

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:51.620
 that they're gonna have sex with.

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:55.560
 And so the intent of the chasing is completely different,

1:19:55.560 --> 1:19:57.400
 and we don't know in all these cases

1:19:57.400 --> 1:19:59.520
 whether there are separate circuits

1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:01.760
 or common circuits that are being activated.

1:20:02.700 --> 1:20:04.800
 I'm obsessed with dogs and dog breeds

1:20:04.800 --> 1:20:06.140
 and et cetera, et cetera.

1:20:06.140 --> 1:20:08.760
 And one thing I can tell you

1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:12.760
 is that female dogs will mount and thrust.

1:20:12.760 --> 1:20:17.040
 We had a female pit bull mix, very sweet dog,

1:20:17.040 --> 1:20:20.640
 but in observing her, it convinced me

1:20:20.640 --> 1:20:22.880
 that one can never assume

1:20:22.880 --> 1:20:25.680
 that male dogs are more aggressive than female dogs.

1:20:25.680 --> 1:20:27.760
 There's a, it turns out in talking to people

1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:31.280
 who are quite skilled at dog genetics and dog breeding,

1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:33.920
 that there's a dominance hierarchy within a litter,

1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:38.280
 and it crosses over male-female delineations.

1:20:39.480 --> 1:20:40.840
 So you can get a female in the litter

1:20:40.840 --> 1:20:43.200
 that's very dominant, a male that's very subordinate,

1:20:43.200 --> 1:20:45.880
 and no one really knows what relates to.

1:20:45.880 --> 1:20:47.440
 This is also why little dogs sometimes

1:20:47.440 --> 1:20:50.600
 will get right up in the face of a big Doberman Pinscher

1:20:50.600 --> 1:20:51.440
 and just start barking,

1:20:51.440 --> 1:20:53.080
 which is an idiotic thing for it to do,

1:20:53.080 --> 1:20:56.280
 but they can be dominant over a much larger dog.

1:20:56.280 --> 1:20:58.560
 Very strange, to me anyway.

1:20:59.480 --> 1:21:02.160
 Female-female mounting, do you observe it in mice?

1:21:03.140 --> 1:21:04.640
 Are there known circuits?

1:21:04.640 --> 1:21:07.240
 And what evokes female-female mounting,

1:21:07.240 --> 1:21:10.440
 or female-to-male mounting, if it occurs?

1:21:10.440 --> 1:21:11.280
 Good.

1:21:11.280 --> 1:21:13.520
 Yes, there is female,

1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:16.460
 there are clear examples of females

1:21:16.460 --> 1:21:19.080
 displaying male-type mounting behavior

1:21:19.080 --> 1:21:20.580
 towards other females.

1:21:20.580 --> 1:21:23.960
 We see this most commonly in the lab

1:21:23.960 --> 1:21:27.360
 where we are housing females with their sister,

1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:29.580
 say three or four in a cage.

1:21:29.580 --> 1:21:33.480
 We take one out and we have her mate with a male

1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:35.260
 where the male's doing the mounting.

1:21:35.260 --> 1:21:39.040
 Now we take that female and we put her back in the cage

1:21:39.040 --> 1:21:42.840
 with her litter mates and she starts mounting them.

1:21:42.840 --> 1:21:45.960
 Now what the function of that is,

1:21:45.960 --> 1:21:49.040
 if it has any function or what it means,

1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:51.160
 what's driving it, we don't know.

1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:55.480
 But we do know that if we stimulate the mount,

1:21:55.480 --> 1:21:58.280
 the neurons that control mounting in males

1:21:58.280 --> 1:21:59.800
 in the medial preoptic area,

1:21:59.800 --> 1:22:03.760
 if we stimulate that same population in females,

1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:07.200
 it evokes male-type mounting

1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:09.700
 towards either a male or a female target.

1:22:09.700 --> 1:22:13.960
 In fact, we have a movie where we have a female

1:22:13.960 --> 1:22:16.560
 that has just been mounted by a male.

1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:19.640
 So the male's on top and she's underneath

1:22:19.640 --> 1:22:24.160
 and we stimulate that region of MPOA in the female

1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:27.440
 and she crawls out from underneath the male

1:22:27.440 --> 1:22:31.560
 who has just mounted her, circles around behind him

1:22:31.560 --> 1:22:33.400
 and climbs up on top of him

1:22:33.400 --> 1:22:36.560
 and starts to try to mount him and thrust at him.

1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:39.020
 That has a name online, it's called a switch.

1:22:39.020 --> 1:22:40.680
 Is that right?

1:22:40.680 --> 1:22:41.760
 Don't ask me how I know that.

1:22:41.760 --> 1:22:42.840
 Okay.

1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:47.020
 But it's a pretty, yeah, it's a term that you hear.

1:22:48.080 --> 1:22:50.640
 You also hear the term topping from the bottom,

1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:52.440
 which it sounds like that is a literal topping

1:22:52.440 --> 1:22:53.280
 from the bottom. I see.

1:22:53.280 --> 1:22:55.760
 That's more of a psychological phrase from what I hear.

1:22:55.760 --> 1:22:59.920
 I have friends that are educating me in this language,

1:22:59.920 --> 1:23:02.000
 mostly because I find this kind

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.160
 of neurobiological discussion fascinating.

1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:08.100
 At some point, right, I attempt in my mind

1:23:08.100 --> 1:23:11.880
 to superimpose observations from the online communities

1:23:11.880 --> 1:23:14.440
 that I've been told about and asked about to this,

1:23:14.440 --> 1:23:16.520
 but I should point out it's always dangerous

1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:20.720
 and in fact, inappropriate to make a one-to-one link.

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:23.600
 Humans are, they maintain all the same neural circuitry

1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:26.000
 and pathways that we're talking about today in mice,

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:30.200
 but that forebrain does allow for context, et cetera.

1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:31.040
 Yep.

1:23:31.040 --> 1:23:36.040
 So what the function is of female mounting,

1:23:36.040 --> 1:23:39.580
 I don't know, it could be a type of dominance display.

1:23:39.580 --> 1:23:42.420
 It's hard to measure that because people haven't worked

1:23:42.420 --> 1:23:46.120
 on female dominance hierarchies to the same extent

1:23:46.120 --> 1:23:49.100
 that they've worked on male dominance hierarchies,

1:23:49.100 --> 1:23:54.100
 but it indicates that the circuits for male type mounting

1:23:54.120 --> 1:23:56.920
 are there in females as early work

1:23:56.920 --> 1:24:00.240
 from Catherine Dulock suggested some years ago.

1:24:00.240 --> 1:24:01.760
 Fascinating, fascinating.

1:24:01.760 --> 1:24:04.820
 I love that paper because as you pointed out for Chase,

1:24:04.820 --> 1:24:08.120
 you know, for mounting behavior, you know,

1:24:08.120 --> 1:24:11.440
 we see it and we think one thing specifically.

1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:13.340
 And after hearing this result, actually,

1:24:13.340 --> 1:24:14.960
 I'm not a big fan of fight sports.

1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:16.880
 I watch them occasionally because friends are into them,

1:24:16.880 --> 1:24:21.320
 but I've seen boxing matches, MMA matches,

1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:23.140
 where at the end of a round,

1:24:23.140 --> 1:24:25.120
 if someone felt that they dominated,

1:24:25.120 --> 1:24:29.240
 they will do the unsportsmanlike thing of the thrusting

1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:30.880
 on the back of the other person before they get off,

1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:32.480
 almost like I dominated you.

1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:35.080
 And so mimicking sexual like behavior,

1:24:35.080 --> 1:24:37.360
 but there's no reason to think that it's sexual,

1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:40.320
 but they're sending a message of dominance is what implies.

1:24:41.620 --> 1:24:45.520
 I'd love to talk about something slightly off

1:24:45.520 --> 1:24:47.620
 from this circuitry, but I think that's related

1:24:47.620 --> 1:24:49.300
 to the circuitry, at least in some way,

1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:52.560
 which is this structure that I've always been fascinated by

1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:54.940
 and I can't figure out what the hell it's for

1:24:54.940 --> 1:24:56.080
 because it seems to be involved in everything,

1:24:56.080 --> 1:25:00.320
 which is the PAG, the periaqueductal gray,

1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:01.800
 which is a little bit further back in the brain

1:25:01.800 --> 1:25:03.380
 for people that don't know.

1:25:03.380 --> 1:25:05.040
 It's been studied in the context of pain.

1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:06.600
 It's been studied in the context

1:25:06.600 --> 1:25:08.520
 of the so-called lordosis response,

1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:10.960
 the receptivity or arching of the back of the female

1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:13.560
 to receive intromission and mating from the male.

1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:16.480
 How should we think about PAG?

1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:19.600
 Clearly it can't be involved in everything.

1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:21.640
 I'm guessing it's at least as complex

1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:22.640
 as some of these other regions

1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:23.580
 that we've been talking about,

1:25:23.580 --> 1:25:25.420
 different types of neurons controlling different things,

1:25:25.420 --> 1:25:27.880
 but how does PAG play into this?

1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:29.960
 In particular, I wanna know,

1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:33.520
 is there some mechanism of pain modulation and control

1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:37.400
 during fighting and or mating?

1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:39.600
 And the reason I ask is that,

1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:42.240
 while I'm not a combat sports person,

1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:44.560
 years ago I did a little bit of martial arts

1:25:44.560 --> 1:25:46.800
 and it always was impressive to me

1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:49.320
 how little it hurt to get punched during a fight

1:25:49.320 --> 1:25:51.920
 and how much it hurt afterwards, right?

1:25:51.920 --> 1:25:54.440
 So there clearly is some endogenous pain control

1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:58.760
 that then wears off and then you feel beat up,

1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:00.720
 at least in my case, I felt beat up.

1:26:00.720 --> 1:26:04.200
 What's PAG doing vis-a-vis pain and vis-a-vis,

1:26:04.200 --> 1:26:06.200
 and what's pain doing vis-a-vis these other behaviors?

1:26:06.200 --> 1:26:07.040
 Good, good.

1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:12.040
 So I think of PAG like a old fashioned telephone switchboard

1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:17.460
 where there are calls coming in

1:26:17.460 --> 1:26:20.840
 and then the cables have to be punched into the right hole

1:26:20.840 --> 1:26:24.800
 to get the information to be routed to the right recipient

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:26.480
 on the other end of it,

1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:30.600
 because pretty much every type of innate behavior

1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:34.360
 you can think of has had the PAG implicated.

1:26:34.360 --> 1:26:37.480
 There's a whole literature showing the involvement

1:26:37.480 --> 1:26:41.660
 of the PAG in fear, different regions of the PAG.

1:26:41.660 --> 1:26:45.320
 The dorsal PAG is involved in panic-like behavior,

1:26:45.320 --> 1:26:46.360
 running away.

1:26:46.360 --> 1:26:49.840
 The ventral PAG is involved in freezing behavior.

1:26:50.900 --> 1:26:55.900
 Both the MPOA and VMH send projections to the PAG,

1:26:55.900 --> 1:26:58.900
 to different regions of the PAG.

1:26:58.900 --> 1:27:02.800
 So in cross-section, I hate to say this,

1:27:02.800 --> 1:27:04.200
 but in cross-section,

1:27:04.200 --> 1:27:06.940
 the PAG kind of looks like the water in a toilet

1:27:06.940 --> 1:27:09.980
 when you're standing over an open toilet bowl.

1:27:09.980 --> 1:27:14.980
 And if you imagine a clock face projected onto that,

1:27:15.040 --> 1:27:19.960
 it's like the PAG has sectors from one to 12,

1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:21.300
 maybe even more of them.

1:27:21.300 --> 1:27:22.920
 And in each of those sectors,

1:27:22.920 --> 1:27:25.740
 you find different neurons from the hypothalamus

1:27:25.740 --> 1:27:26.880
 are projecting.

1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:31.220
 So could turn out that there is a topographic arrangement

1:27:31.220 --> 1:27:34.220
 along the dorsal ventral axis of the PAG

1:27:34.220 --> 1:27:37.020
 and the medial lateral axis of the PAG

1:27:37.020 --> 1:27:39.860
 that determines the type of behavior

1:27:39.860 --> 1:27:43.140
 that will be emitted when neurons in that region

1:27:43.140 --> 1:27:43.980
 are stimulated.

1:27:43.980 --> 1:27:46.060
 And I think sort of all of the evidence

1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:47.840
 is pointing in that direction,

1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:50.580
 but by no means has it been mapped out.

1:27:50.580 --> 1:27:54.040
 Now, the thing that you mentioned about it not hurting

1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:56.940
 when you got beat up during martial arts,

1:27:56.940 --> 1:27:59.260
 there is a well-known phenomenon

1:27:59.260 --> 1:28:03.820
 called fear-induced analgesia,

1:28:03.820 --> 1:28:08.740
 where when an animal is in a high state of fear,

1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:11.220
 like if it's trying to defend itself,

1:28:11.220 --> 1:28:16.220
 there is a suppression of pain responses.

1:28:16.220 --> 1:28:20.660
 And I'm not sure completely about the mechanisms

1:28:20.660 --> 1:28:22.740
 and how well that's understood.

1:28:22.740 --> 1:28:27.740
 But for example, the adrenal gland has a peptide in it

1:28:28.780 --> 1:28:32.220
 that is released from the adrenal medulla,

1:28:32.220 --> 1:28:34.900
 which controls the fight or flight responses.

1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:38.940
 And that peptide has analgesic activities.

1:28:38.940 --> 1:28:40.020
 Now whether- Ask what that peptide is.

1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:43.300
 It's called bovine adrenal medullary peptide

1:28:43.300 --> 1:28:45.480
 of 22 amino acid residues.

1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:49.500
 And I only know about it because it activates a receptor

1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:51.560
 that we discovered many years ago

1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:54.780
 that's involved in pain, and we thought it promoted pain,

1:28:54.780 --> 1:28:57.700
 but it turns out that this actually inhibits pain.

1:28:57.700 --> 1:29:00.460
 It's like an endogenous analgesic.

1:29:00.460 --> 1:29:05.380
 Whether this is happening, this type of analgesia

1:29:05.380 --> 1:29:08.100
 is happening when an animal is engaged

1:29:08.100 --> 1:29:13.100
 in offensive aggression or in mating behavior,

1:29:13.220 --> 1:29:16.420
 I don't know, but it certainly is possible.

1:29:16.420 --> 1:29:20.480
 And I don't know whether these analgesic mechanisms

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:22.500
 are happening in the PAG.

1:29:22.500 --> 1:29:25.540
 They could also be happening a little further down

1:29:25.540 --> 1:29:26.620
 in the spinal cord.

1:29:26.620 --> 1:29:30.000
 The PAG is really continuous with the spinal cord.

1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.900
 If you just follow it down towards the tail of an animal,

1:29:33.900 --> 1:29:36.700
 you will wind up in the spinal cord.

1:29:36.700 --> 1:29:40.620
 And so it could be that there are influences

1:29:40.620 --> 1:29:44.020
 acting at many levels on pain in the PAG

1:29:44.020 --> 1:29:46.380
 and in the spinal cord as well.

1:29:46.380 --> 1:29:49.100
 And it may well be known, I just don't know it.

1:29:49.100 --> 1:29:51.780
 I wanna distinguish clearly between things

1:29:51.780 --> 1:29:55.100
 that are not known, that I know are unknown,

1:29:55.100 --> 1:29:58.780
 which is in a fairly small area where I have expertise

1:29:58.780 --> 1:30:01.820
 from things that may be known, but I'm ignorant of them

1:30:01.820 --> 1:30:04.300
 because I just don't have a broad enough knowledge base

1:30:04.300 --> 1:30:05.140
 to know that.

1:30:05.140 --> 1:30:08.220
 Sure, we appreciate those delineations.

1:30:09.260 --> 1:30:10.700
 Thank you, PAG.

1:30:10.700 --> 1:30:11.740
 I think this description of it

1:30:11.740 --> 1:30:14.100
 is an old-fashioned telephone switchboard.

1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:16.420
 And now every time I look into the toilet,

1:30:16.420 --> 1:30:18.140
 I'll think about the periaqueductal gray.

1:30:18.140 --> 1:30:20.260
 And every time I see an image of periaqueductal gray,

1:30:20.260 --> 1:30:21.260
 I'll think about a toilet.

1:30:21.260 --> 1:30:23.660
 That is an excellent description

1:30:23.660 --> 1:30:25.220
 because in fact, I drew a circle

1:30:25.220 --> 1:30:27.640
 with a little thing at the bottom.

1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:30.300
 Well, I'll put a link to a picture of PAG

1:30:30.300 --> 1:30:33.220
 and you'll understand why David and I are chuckling here

1:30:33.220 --> 1:30:35.420
 because indeed it looks like a toilet

1:30:35.420 --> 1:30:36.820
 when staring into a toilet.

1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:40.360
 Tell us about tachykinin.

1:30:40.360 --> 1:30:41.700
 I've talked about this a couple of times

1:30:41.700 --> 1:30:42.940
 on different podcast episodes

1:30:42.940 --> 1:30:47.420
 because of its relationship to social isolation.

1:30:47.420 --> 1:30:51.100
 And in part because the podcast was launched

1:30:51.100 --> 1:30:53.700
 during a time when there was more social isolation.

1:30:54.660 --> 1:30:56.820
 My understanding is that tachykinin,

1:30:56.820 --> 1:30:59.360
 and you'll tell us what it is in a moment,

1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:01.820
 is present in flies and mice and in humans

1:31:01.820 --> 1:31:05.860
 and may do similar things in those species.

1:31:05.860 --> 1:31:06.700
 That's right.

1:31:06.700 --> 1:31:09.580
 So, tachykinin is,

1:31:09.580 --> 1:31:12.980
 refers to a family of related neuropeptides.

1:31:12.980 --> 1:31:15.180
 So these are brain chemicals.

1:31:15.180 --> 1:31:19.420
 They're different from dopamine and serotonin

1:31:19.420 --> 1:31:23.080
 in that they're not small organic molecules.

1:31:23.080 --> 1:31:25.860
 They're actually short pieces of protein

1:31:25.860 --> 1:31:28.760
 that are directly encoded by genes

1:31:28.760 --> 1:31:32.300
 that are active in specific neurons and not in others.

1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:34.100
 And when those neurons are active,

1:31:34.100 --> 1:31:36.900
 those neuropeptides are released together

1:31:36.900 --> 1:31:40.560
 with classical transmitters like glutamate, whatever.

1:31:40.560 --> 1:31:44.980
 Tachykinins have been famously implicated in pain,

1:31:44.980 --> 1:31:49.980
 particularly tachykinin-1, which is called substance P,

1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:53.340
 one of the original pain modulating.

1:31:53.340 --> 1:31:57.460
 This is something that promotes inflammatory pain.

1:31:57.460 --> 1:32:00.020
 But there are other tachykinin genes.

1:32:00.020 --> 1:32:01.660
 In mice, there are two.

1:32:01.660 --> 1:32:03.980
 In humans, I think there are three.

1:32:03.980 --> 1:32:06.700
 And in Drosophila, there is one.

1:32:06.700 --> 1:32:09.260
 And the way we got into tachykinins

1:32:09.260 --> 1:32:12.540
 is from studying aggression in flies.

1:32:12.540 --> 1:32:17.300
 We thought, since neuropeptides have this remarkable

1:32:17.300 --> 1:32:21.260
 parallel evolutionary conservation of structure

1:32:21.260 --> 1:32:25.460
 and function, like neuropeptide Y controls feeding

1:32:25.460 --> 1:32:28.980
 in worms, in flies, and mice, and in people,

1:32:28.980 --> 1:32:32.200
 oxytocin-like peptides control reproduction

1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:35.580
 in worms and mice and in people,

1:32:35.580 --> 1:32:37.660
 we thought we might find peptides

1:32:37.660 --> 1:32:40.660
 that control aggression in flies and in people.

1:32:40.660 --> 1:32:44.720
 And so we did a screen, unbiased screen of peptides

1:32:44.720 --> 1:32:48.660
 and found indeed that one of the tachykinins,

1:32:48.660 --> 1:32:51.580
 Drosophila tachykinin, those neurons,

1:32:51.580 --> 1:32:54.780
 when you activate them, strongly promote aggression

1:32:54.780 --> 1:32:57.560
 and it depends on the release of tachykinin.

1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:00.580
 Now, the interesting thing is that in flies,

1:33:00.580 --> 1:33:05.440
 just like in people and practically any other social animal

1:33:05.440 --> 1:33:06.940
 that shows aggression,

1:33:06.940 --> 1:33:10.420
 social isolation increases aggressiveness.

1:33:10.420 --> 1:33:14.940
 So putting a violent prisoner in solitary confinement

1:33:14.940 --> 1:33:16.380
 is absolutely the worst,

1:33:16.380 --> 1:33:19.060
 most counterproductive thing you could do to them.

1:33:19.060 --> 1:33:23.060
 And indeed we found in flies that social isolation

1:33:23.060 --> 1:33:26.900
 increases the level of tachykinin in the brain.

1:33:26.900 --> 1:33:29.160
 And if we shut that gene down,

1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:32.640
 it prevents the isolation from increasing aggression.

1:33:32.640 --> 1:33:35.660
 So since my lab also works on mice,

1:33:35.660 --> 1:33:38.960
 it was natural to see whether tachykinins

1:33:38.960 --> 1:33:42.260
 might be upregulated in social isolation

1:33:42.260 --> 1:33:44.500
 and whether they play a role in aggression.

1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:46.860
 And this is work done by a former postdoc,

1:33:46.860 --> 1:33:48.060
 Moriel Zelikovsky,

1:33:48.060 --> 1:33:50.860
 now at University of Salt Lake City in Utah.

1:33:50.860 --> 1:33:54.720
 And she found remarkably that when mice

1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:56.880
 are socially isolated for two weeks,

1:33:56.880 --> 1:34:01.880
 there is this massive upregulation of tachykinin II

1:34:02.460 --> 1:34:03.420
 in their brain.

1:34:03.420 --> 1:34:06.300
 In fact, if you tag the peptide

1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:09.940
 with a green fluorescent protein from a jellyfish,

1:34:09.940 --> 1:34:12.940
 genetically, the brain looks green

1:34:12.940 --> 1:34:14.940
 when the mice are socially isolated

1:34:14.940 --> 1:34:17.740
 because there's so much of this stuff released.

1:34:17.740 --> 1:34:22.740
 And she went on to show that that increase in tachykinin

1:34:24.100 --> 1:34:27.820
 is responsible for the effect of social isolation

1:34:27.820 --> 1:34:31.620
 to increase aggressiveness and to increase fear

1:34:31.620 --> 1:34:33.260
 and to increase anxiety.

1:34:33.260 --> 1:34:36.860
 And in fact, there are drugs that block the receptor

1:34:36.860 --> 1:34:41.180
 for tachykinin, which were tested in humans and abandoned

1:34:41.180 --> 1:34:43.820
 because they had no efficacy in the tests

1:34:43.820 --> 1:34:45.600
 that they were analyzed for.

1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:49.760
 If you give those drugs to a socially isolated mouse,

1:34:49.760 --> 1:34:53.420
 it blocks all of the effects of social isolation.

1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:55.340
 It blocks the aggression,

1:34:55.340 --> 1:34:58.920
 it blocks the increased fear and the increased anxiety.

1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:02.540
 And that Moriel described it, the mice just look chill.

1:35:02.540 --> 1:35:05.260
 It's not a sedative, which is really important.

1:35:05.260 --> 1:35:08.240
 It's not that the mice are going to sleep.

1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:13.220
 Most remarkably is once you socially isolate a mouse

1:35:13.220 --> 1:35:14.620
 and it becomes aggressive,

1:35:14.620 --> 1:35:18.960
 you can never put it back in its cage with its brothers

1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:22.100
 from its litter because it will kill them all overnight.

1:35:22.100 --> 1:35:25.940
 But if you give it this drug, which is called Osanatant,

1:35:25.940 --> 1:35:29.700
 that blocks tachykinin II,

1:35:29.700 --> 1:35:33.300
 that mouse can be returned to the cage with its brothers

1:35:33.300 --> 1:35:37.340
 and will not attack them and seems to be happy about that

1:35:37.340 --> 1:35:38.700
 for the rest of the time.

1:35:38.700 --> 1:35:42.540
 So this is an incredibly powerful effect of this drug.

1:35:42.540 --> 1:35:44.780
 And I've been really interested

1:35:44.780 --> 1:35:48.140
 in trying to get pharmaceutical companies

1:35:48.140 --> 1:35:49.300
 to test this drug,

1:35:49.300 --> 1:35:52.980
 which has a really good safety profile in humans,

1:35:52.980 --> 1:35:56.380
 in testing it in people who are subjected

1:35:56.380 --> 1:36:00.620
 to social isolation stress or bereavement stress.

1:36:00.620 --> 1:36:02.980
 And this is one of the areas

1:36:02.980 --> 1:36:06.940
 where I learned an eye-opening lesson

1:36:06.940 --> 1:36:09.700
 as a basic scientist who naively thought

1:36:09.700 --> 1:36:11.460
 that if you make a discovery

1:36:11.460 --> 1:36:15.220
 and it has translational applications to humans,

1:36:15.220 --> 1:36:17.740
 that pharmaceutical companies are going to be falling

1:36:17.740 --> 1:36:20.020
 all over themselves to try it.

1:36:20.020 --> 1:36:25.020
 And they're not interested because once burned, twice shy.

1:36:25.020 --> 1:36:29.660
 These drugs were tested for efficacy in schizophrenia.

1:36:29.660 --> 1:36:31.700
 I have no idea why.

1:36:31.700 --> 1:36:34.780
 There's very little preclinical data to suggest that.

1:36:34.780 --> 1:36:37.380
 Not surprisingly, they failed.

1:36:37.380 --> 1:36:41.940
 When a drug fails in clinical trials in phase three,

1:36:41.940 --> 1:36:45.940
 it costs $100 million to the company

1:36:45.940 --> 1:36:48.740
 that carried out that clinical trial.

1:36:48.740 --> 1:36:53.500
 So there's a huge slag heap of discarded pharmaceuticals.

1:36:53.500 --> 1:36:57.780
 Many of them inhibitors of neuropeptide action

1:36:57.780 --> 1:37:02.220
 that could be useful in other indications,

1:37:02.220 --> 1:37:04.100
 such as the one we discovered.

1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:07.500
 But there's a huge economic disincentive

1:37:07.500 --> 1:37:11.860
 for pharmaceutical companies to test them again,

1:37:11.860 --> 1:37:14.300
 because the conclusion that they drew

1:37:14.300 --> 1:37:16.140
 from all these failed tests,

1:37:16.140 --> 1:37:20.220
 particularly in the 2010s and before that,

1:37:20.220 --> 1:37:22.740
 is that the reason they failed

1:37:22.740 --> 1:37:26.540
 is because animal experiments with drugs

1:37:26.540 --> 1:37:31.180
 don't predict how humans will respond to the drugs.

1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:35.100
 And therefore, we shouldn't try to extrapolate

1:37:35.100 --> 1:37:38.740
 from any other data that we get from animal experiments,

1:37:38.740 --> 1:37:40.820
 mouse or rat experiments, to humans,

1:37:40.820 --> 1:37:43.540
 because they'll lead us down the wrong track.

1:37:43.540 --> 1:37:45.940
 And I think that that is probably wrong.

1:37:45.940 --> 1:37:48.220
 In some cases, it may be right,

1:37:48.220 --> 1:37:51.140
 but in other cases, there's good reason to think,

1:37:51.140 --> 1:37:54.020
 because these brain regions and molecules

1:37:54.020 --> 1:37:56.740
 are so evolutionarily conserved

1:37:56.740 --> 1:38:00.500
 that they ought to be playing a similar role in humans.

1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:04.260
 In fact, there is a paper showing

1:38:04.260 --> 1:38:09.260
 that in humans that have borderline personality disorder,

1:38:09.780 --> 1:38:11.460
 there's a strong correlation

1:38:11.460 --> 1:38:15.500
 between their self-reported level of aggressiveness

1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:18.620
 and serum levels of a tachykinin,

1:38:18.620 --> 1:38:20.660
 in this case, tachykinin-1,

1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:22.860
 as detected by radioimmunoassay.

1:38:22.860 --> 1:38:25.100
 This is work of Emil Coccaro,

1:38:25.100 --> 1:38:28.620
 who's a clinical psychiatrist at the University of Chicago.

1:38:28.620 --> 1:38:33.220
 So there is a smoking gun in the case of humans as well.

1:38:33.220 --> 1:38:36.220
 And I was actually trying

1:38:36.220 --> 1:38:38.780
 to interest a pharmaceutical company

1:38:38.780 --> 1:38:41.700
 that was testing these drugs,

1:38:41.700 --> 1:38:46.700
 actually for treatment of hot flashes in females, in humans,

1:38:46.860 --> 1:38:49.860
 where there is actually good animal data

1:38:49.860 --> 1:38:51.980
 to think that it might be useful.

1:38:51.980 --> 1:38:55.140
 But I realized that this clinical trial

1:38:55.140 --> 1:38:58.700
 was going on during the COVID pandemic.

1:38:58.700 --> 1:38:59.900
 And I approached them and said,

1:38:59.900 --> 1:39:02.860
 look, nature may have actually done for you

1:39:02.860 --> 1:39:05.020
 the experiment that I want you to do,

1:39:05.020 --> 1:39:08.140
 because some of the people who are getting drug or placebo

1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:10.620
 are gonna have been socially isolated,

1:39:10.620 --> 1:39:12.140
 and some of them will have not.

1:39:12.140 --> 1:39:14.780
 Why don't you get them to fill out questionnaires

1:39:14.780 --> 1:39:17.340
 and see whether the ones who are given the drug

1:39:17.340 --> 1:39:21.540
 and socially isolated felt less stressed and less anxious

1:39:21.540 --> 1:39:23.900
 than the ones who were not socially isolated,

1:39:23.900 --> 1:39:26.180
 and they would not touch it

1:39:26.180 --> 1:39:29.300
 because they're in the middle of a clinical trial

1:39:29.300 --> 1:39:31.820
 for a different indication for this drug,

1:39:31.820 --> 1:39:35.220
 and they have to report any observation

1:39:35.220 --> 1:39:38.980
 that they make about that drug in their patient population.

1:39:38.980 --> 1:39:41.460
 So if they were to ask these questions

1:39:41.460 --> 1:39:44.060
 and get an unfavorable answer,

1:39:44.060 --> 1:39:46.740
 oh my God, I felt even worse when I took this drug

1:39:46.740 --> 1:39:47.980
 and I was isolated,

1:39:47.980 --> 1:39:51.220
 they would be obliged to report that to the FDA,

1:39:51.220 --> 1:39:53.180
 and that could torpedo the chances

1:39:53.180 --> 1:39:54.820
 for the drug being approved

1:39:54.820 --> 1:39:56.900
 in the thing that it was in clinical trials for.

1:39:56.900 --> 1:40:00.980
 So it's better not to ask and not to know

1:40:02.380 --> 1:40:05.180
 than it is to try to find out more information

1:40:05.180 --> 1:40:07.780
 that could lead to another clinical indication.

1:40:07.780 --> 1:40:12.660
 So I remain convinced that this family of drugs

1:40:12.660 --> 1:40:17.100
 could have very powerful uses in treating some forms

1:40:17.100 --> 1:40:21.260
 of stress-induced anxiety or aggressiveness in humans,

1:40:21.260 --> 1:40:24.420
 but it's just very difficult for economic reasons

1:40:24.420 --> 1:40:26.940
 to find a way to get somebody to test that.

1:40:26.940 --> 1:40:30.460
 Yeah, a true shame that these companies won't do this,

1:40:30.460 --> 1:40:32.300
 and especially given the fact

1:40:32.300 --> 1:40:34.180
 that many of these drugs exist

1:40:34.180 --> 1:40:36.900
 and their safety profiles are established,

1:40:36.900 --> 1:40:39.540
 because that's always a serious consideration

1:40:39.540 --> 1:40:41.780
 when embarking on a clinical trial.

1:40:41.780 --> 1:40:44.460
 And perhaps in hearing this discussion,

1:40:44.460 --> 1:40:46.340
 someone out there will understand

1:40:46.340 --> 1:40:49.620
 the key importance of this and will reach out to us,

1:40:49.620 --> 1:40:52.300
 will provide ways to do that

1:40:52.300 --> 1:40:55.140
 to get such a study going in humans.

1:40:55.140 --> 1:40:57.540
 Because I think if enough laboratories

1:40:57.540 --> 1:40:59.820
 ran small-scale clinical trials,

1:40:59.820 --> 1:41:02.060
 pharma certainly would perk up their ears, right?

1:41:02.060 --> 1:41:05.660
 I mean, they're so strategic sometimes to their own.

1:41:05.660 --> 1:41:07.540
 I mean, I would like to say also,

1:41:07.540 --> 1:41:10.340
 I'd like to see this tested on pets.

1:41:10.340 --> 1:41:13.060
 I mean, there's a huge number of pets right now

1:41:13.060 --> 1:41:15.660
 that are suffering separation anxiety

1:41:15.660 --> 1:41:18.540
 because humans bought them to keep them company

1:41:18.540 --> 1:41:19.900
 during the COVID pandemic.

1:41:19.900 --> 1:41:20.740
 And now they're home alone.

1:41:20.740 --> 1:41:22.420
 And now they're home alone, okay?

1:41:22.420 --> 1:41:24.540
 And if this thing works in mice,

1:41:24.540 --> 1:41:26.380
 there's certainly a higher chance

1:41:26.380 --> 1:41:28.980
 it's gonna work in dogs or in cats

1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:30.780
 than it is gonna work in humans.

1:41:30.780 --> 1:41:33.740
 And if it did, that would be even more encouragement

1:41:33.740 --> 1:41:35.660
 to continue along those lines.

1:41:35.660 --> 1:41:39.180
 People sometimes forget that although we work on animals

1:41:39.180 --> 1:41:41.500
 and we ultimately wanna understand humans,

1:41:41.500 --> 1:41:44.220
 we care about how our results apply

1:41:44.220 --> 1:41:46.740
 to the welfare of animals as well,

1:41:46.740 --> 1:41:48.780
 and particularly domestic pets,

1:41:48.780 --> 1:41:51.980
 which is a billion, multi-billion dollar industry

1:41:51.980 --> 1:41:52.900
 in this country.

1:41:52.900 --> 1:41:56.300
 So if there's ways that they can be made to feel better

1:41:56.300 --> 1:41:59.500
 when they're separated from their owners,

1:41:59.500 --> 1:42:01.300
 that would certainly be a good thing.

1:42:01.300 --> 1:42:02.780
 Absolutely.

1:42:02.780 --> 1:42:03.820
 We will put out the call.

1:42:03.820 --> 1:42:05.060
 We are putting out the call.

1:42:05.060 --> 1:42:10.540
 And I know for sure there will be a response.

1:42:10.540 --> 1:42:13.420
 Just underscoring what we've been talking about even more,

1:42:13.420 --> 1:42:16.740
 every time we hear about a school shooting,

1:42:16.740 --> 1:42:18.060
 like in Texas recently,

1:42:18.060 --> 1:42:20.300
 or I happened to be in New York during the time

1:42:20.300 --> 1:42:23.020
 when there was a subway shooting,

1:42:23.020 --> 1:42:28.140
 for whatever reason, I listened to the book about Columbine

1:42:28.140 --> 1:42:30.020
 that went into a very detailed way

1:42:30.020 --> 1:42:33.260
 about the origin of those boys and that committed that.

1:42:33.260 --> 1:42:38.260
 And every single time the person who commits those acts

1:42:39.180 --> 1:42:41.460
 is socially isolated, as far as I know.

1:42:41.460 --> 1:42:42.980
 There might be some exceptions there.

1:42:42.980 --> 1:42:44.300
 And sometimes this crosses over

1:42:44.300 --> 1:42:46.460
 with other mental health issues, but sometimes no,

1:42:46.460 --> 1:42:48.180
 no apparent mental health issues.

1:42:48.180 --> 1:42:52.420
 So social isolation clearly drives powerful neurochemical

1:42:52.420 --> 1:42:54.300
 and neurobiological changes.

1:42:54.300 --> 1:42:57.020
 I really hope that tachykinin 1 and 2,

1:42:57.020 --> 1:42:58.860
 those are the main ones in humans,

1:42:58.860 --> 1:43:01.420
 will be explored in more detail.

1:43:01.420 --> 1:43:02.940
 Also, I didn't know that tachykinin 1

1:43:02.940 --> 1:43:05.860
 is substance P and substance P is tachykinin 1.

1:43:05.860 --> 1:43:08.060
 Tachykinin 1 is the gene name

1:43:08.060 --> 1:43:12.260
 and tachykinin 2 in humans is called neurokinin B.

1:43:12.260 --> 1:43:14.180
 That's the name of the protein.

1:43:14.180 --> 1:43:16.100
 I just referred to it by the gene name

1:43:16.100 --> 1:43:17.300
 because it makes it easier

1:43:17.300 --> 1:43:18.780
 and I don't have to keep remembering

1:43:18.780 --> 1:43:20.300
 two names for each thing.

1:43:20.300 --> 1:43:22.060
 And I, if I'm not mistaken,

1:43:22.060 --> 1:43:25.540
 you put yourself in the company of geneticists

1:43:25.540 --> 1:43:26.820
 because of your original training

1:43:26.820 --> 1:43:29.860
 was in genetics, immunology and areas related to that.

1:43:29.860 --> 1:43:31.540
 It was in cell biology

1:43:31.540 --> 1:43:34.700
 and I didn't actually have formal training in genetics

1:43:34.700 --> 1:43:35.900
 as a graduate student,

1:43:35.900 --> 1:43:38.180
 but I think I'm a geneticist at heart.

1:43:38.180 --> 1:43:41.300
 That's just the way I like to think about things.

1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:43.420
 And when I started working on flies,

1:43:43.420 --> 1:43:46.020
 that sort of, I came out of the closet

1:43:46.020 --> 1:43:48.220
 as a geneticist, as it were.

1:43:48.220 --> 1:43:49.660
 Wonderful.

1:43:49.660 --> 1:43:50.900
 As long as we're talking about humans,

1:43:50.900 --> 1:43:51.780
 I'd love to get your thoughts

1:43:51.780 --> 1:43:53.200
 about human studies of emotion.

1:43:53.200 --> 1:43:55.140
 I know you wrote this book with Ralph Adol.

1:43:55.140 --> 1:43:56.220
 So you have this new book,

1:43:56.220 --> 1:43:57.380
 which we'll provide a link to,

1:43:57.380 --> 1:43:59.840
 which I've read front to back twice.

1:43:59.840 --> 1:44:01.020
 It's phenomenal.

1:44:01.020 --> 1:44:02.460
 I've mentioned it before on the podcast.

1:44:02.460 --> 1:44:05.140
 It's really, there are books that are worth reading

1:44:05.140 --> 1:44:06.620
 and then there are books that are important.

1:44:06.620 --> 1:44:08.220
 And I think this book is truly important

1:44:08.220 --> 1:44:10.800
 for the general population to read and understand.

1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:13.220
 And neuroscientists should read and understand the contents

1:44:13.220 --> 1:44:17.060
 because we, as a culture,

1:44:17.060 --> 1:44:19.500
 are way off in terms of how we think about emotions

1:44:19.500 --> 1:44:21.340
 and states and behaviors.

1:44:21.340 --> 1:44:22.460
 So we'll put a link to that.

1:44:22.460 --> 1:44:25.880
 It's really worth the time and energy to read it.

1:44:25.880 --> 1:44:27.520
 And it's written beautifully, I should say.

1:44:27.520 --> 1:44:30.280
 Very accessible, even for non-scientists.

1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:35.280
 There's a heat map diagram in that book that I think about.

1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:38.660
 This is a heat map diagram of subjective reports

1:44:38.660 --> 1:44:43.660
 that people gave of where they experience an emotion

1:44:43.740 --> 1:44:46.540
 or a feeling, a somatic feeling in their body

1:44:46.540 --> 1:44:51.140
 or in their head or both when they are angry, sad, calm,

1:44:51.140 --> 1:44:53.820
 lonely, et cetera, et cetera.

1:44:53.820 --> 1:44:56.520
 And I wouldn't want people to think that those heat maps

1:44:56.520 --> 1:45:00.900
 were generated by any physiological measurement

1:45:00.900 --> 1:45:01.860
 because they were not.

1:45:01.860 --> 1:45:04.900
 And yet, I don't think we can have a discussion

1:45:04.900 --> 1:45:08.340
 about emotions and states and the sorts of behaviors

1:45:08.340 --> 1:45:09.180
 that we're talking about today

1:45:09.180 --> 1:45:11.720
 without thinking about the body also.

1:45:11.720 --> 1:45:12.860
 And I'm not coming to this

1:45:12.860 --> 1:45:14.940
 as a Northern California mind body.

1:45:14.940 --> 1:45:16.260
 I've been to Esalen once.

1:45:16.260 --> 1:45:17.420
 I didn't go in the baths.

1:45:17.420 --> 1:45:18.980
 I went there, I gave a talk and I left.

1:45:18.980 --> 1:45:20.500
 It is very beautiful.

1:45:20.500 --> 1:45:21.660
 If anyone wants to know what it looks like,

1:45:21.660 --> 1:45:24.700
 I think that final scene of Mad Men is shot at Esalen.

1:45:24.700 --> 1:45:26.620
 It's a very beautiful place.

1:45:26.620 --> 1:45:31.620
 And yet, mind body to me is a neurobiological construct

1:45:31.820 --> 1:45:33.180
 because the nervous system extends

1:45:33.180 --> 1:45:35.100
 through the out of the cranial vault

1:45:35.100 --> 1:45:37.340
 and into the spinal cord and body and back and forth.

1:45:37.340 --> 1:45:41.220
 Okay, how should we think about the body

1:45:41.220 --> 1:45:43.460
 and in terms of states?

1:45:43.460 --> 1:45:45.760
 And at some point, I'd love for you to comment

1:45:45.760 --> 1:45:47.580
 on that heat map experiment

1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:50.280
 because it does seem that there's some regularity

1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:52.860
 as to where people experience emotions.

1:45:52.860 --> 1:45:54.580
 When people are in a rage, for instance,

1:45:54.580 --> 1:45:58.100
 they seem to feel it both in their gut and in their head,

1:45:58.100 --> 1:46:00.580
 it seems, on average.

1:46:00.580 --> 1:46:05.300
 And people love to extrapolate to gut intuition

1:46:05.300 --> 1:46:08.740
 or that the chakras or anger is in the stomach

1:46:08.740 --> 1:46:11.780
 and this goes to Eastern medicine, et cetera.

1:46:11.780 --> 1:46:14.980
 How should we think about mind body in the context of states

1:46:14.980 --> 1:46:16.780
 and think about it as scientists,

1:46:16.780 --> 1:46:20.060
 maybe even as neuroscientists or geneticists?

1:46:20.060 --> 1:46:21.140
 Good.

1:46:21.140 --> 1:46:25.160
 So for the answer to the first question about the heat maps

1:46:25.160 --> 1:46:28.460
 and people associating certain parts of their body

1:46:28.460 --> 1:46:30.880
 with certain emotional feelings,

1:46:30.880 --> 1:46:33.420
 this goes back to something called

1:46:33.420 --> 1:46:35.660
 the somatic marker hypothesis

1:46:35.660 --> 1:46:38.340
 that was proposed by Antonio Damasio,

1:46:38.340 --> 1:46:41.380
 who is a neurologist at USC.

1:46:41.380 --> 1:46:45.500
 The idea that our subjective feeling

1:46:45.500 --> 1:46:50.500
 of a particular emotion is in part associated

1:46:50.500 --> 1:46:55.140
 with a sensation of something happening

1:46:55.140 --> 1:46:57.500
 in a particular part of our body.

1:46:57.500 --> 1:47:02.500
 The gut, the heart, I don't see the liver invoked very much

1:47:02.740 --> 1:47:06.700
 in emotional characterization.

1:47:06.700 --> 1:47:08.260
 But gall and the gallbladder?

1:47:08.260 --> 1:47:09.340
 Yes.

1:47:09.340 --> 1:47:10.180
 Somebody having a lot of gall.

1:47:10.180 --> 1:47:11.020
 That's right.

1:47:11.020 --> 1:47:12.100
 I don't know why I make a fist when I say that,

1:47:12.100 --> 1:47:14.120
 but I'm guessing the gallbladder is shaped like a fist.

1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:14.960
 That's right.

1:47:16.060 --> 1:47:20.260
 And if there is a physiology underlying these heat maps,

1:47:20.260 --> 1:47:22.860
 it could reflect increased blood flow

1:47:22.860 --> 1:47:24.380
 to these different structures.

1:47:24.380 --> 1:47:28.060
 And that in turn reflects what you were talking about,

1:47:28.060 --> 1:47:31.800
 that is emotion definitely involves communication

1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:33.780
 between the brain and the body,

1:47:33.780 --> 1:47:36.900
 and it's bi-directional communication.

1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:41.280
 And it's mediated by the peripheral nervous system,

1:47:41.280 --> 1:47:44.520
 the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous system,

1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:47.460
 which control heart rate, for example,

1:47:47.460 --> 1:47:50.220
 blood vessel, blood pressure,

1:47:50.220 --> 1:47:54.740
 and those neurons receive input from the hypothalamus

1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:58.380
 and other blood brain regions, central brain regions,

1:47:58.380 --> 1:48:00.380
 that control their activity.

1:48:00.380 --> 1:48:05.040
 And when the brain is put in a particular state,

1:48:05.040 --> 1:48:09.020
 it activates sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons,

1:48:09.020 --> 1:48:13.780
 which have effects on the heart and on blood pressure.

1:48:13.780 --> 1:48:18.140
 And these in turn feed back onto the brain

1:48:18.140 --> 1:48:20.040
 through the sensory system.

1:48:20.040 --> 1:48:23.860
 And a large part of this bi-directional communication

1:48:23.860 --> 1:48:27.220
 is also mediated through the vagus nerve,

1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:30.860
 which many of your listeners and viewers

1:48:30.860 --> 1:48:31.700
 may have heard about,

1:48:31.700 --> 1:48:35.700
 because it's become a topic of intense activity now.

1:48:35.700 --> 1:48:38.340
 People have known for a long time.

1:48:38.340 --> 1:48:43.340
 So the vagus nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers

1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:47.300
 that comes out basically of your skull,

1:48:47.300 --> 1:48:49.460
 out of the central nervous system,

1:48:49.460 --> 1:48:54.460
 and then sends fibers in to your heart,

1:48:54.500 --> 1:48:58.180
 your gut, all sorts of visceral organs.

1:48:58.180 --> 1:49:01.460
 So when you have, and that information is both,

1:49:01.460 --> 1:49:04.740
 you used the words earlier in our discussion,

1:49:04.740 --> 1:49:06.940
 afferent and efferent.

1:49:06.940 --> 1:49:11.740
 So the vagal fibers sense things

1:49:11.740 --> 1:49:13.860
 that are happening in the body.

1:49:13.860 --> 1:49:16.940
 So when you're, the reason you feel your stomach

1:49:16.940 --> 1:49:19.580
 hide up in knots if you're tense

1:49:19.580 --> 1:49:22.980
 is that those vagal fibers are sensing

1:49:22.980 --> 1:49:25.900
 the contraction of the gut muscles.

1:49:25.900 --> 1:49:27.780
 And they're also afferents,

1:49:27.780 --> 1:49:31.140
 which means that information coming out of the brain

1:49:31.140 --> 1:49:34.780
 can influence those peripheral organs as well.

1:49:34.780 --> 1:49:37.100
 And there's work from a number of labs

1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:40.380
 just in the last six months or so

1:49:40.380 --> 1:49:43.420
 where people are starting to decode

1:49:43.420 --> 1:49:48.260
 the components of the different fibers in the vagus nerve.

1:49:48.260 --> 1:49:51.240
 And it's amazing how much specificity is.

1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:55.360
 There are specific vagal nerves that go to the lung,

1:49:55.360 --> 1:49:57.620
 that control breathing responses,

1:49:57.620 --> 1:50:01.620
 that go to the gut, that go to other organs.

1:50:01.620 --> 1:50:06.260
 It's almost like a set of color-coded lines,

1:50:06.260 --> 1:50:08.120
 labeled lines for those things.

1:50:08.120 --> 1:50:13.460
 And now how those vagal afferents play a role

1:50:13.460 --> 1:50:16.600
 in the playing out of emotion states

1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:18.900
 is a fascinating question that people

1:50:18.900 --> 1:50:21.700
 are just beginning to scrape the surface of.

1:50:21.700 --> 1:50:23.820
 But I think what's exciting now

1:50:23.820 --> 1:50:25.980
 is that people are gonna be developing tools

1:50:25.980 --> 1:50:28.940
 that will allow us to turn on or turn off

1:50:28.940 --> 1:50:33.380
 specific subsets of fibers within the vagus nerve

1:50:33.380 --> 1:50:37.060
 and ask how that affects particular emotional behaviors.

1:50:37.060 --> 1:50:38.680
 So you're absolutely right.

1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:41.340
 This brain-body connection is critical,

1:50:41.340 --> 1:50:45.020
 not just for the gut, but for the heart, for the lungs,

1:50:45.020 --> 1:50:48.060
 for all kinds of other parts of your body.

1:50:48.060 --> 1:50:50.540
 And Darwin recognized that as well.

1:50:50.540 --> 1:50:54.680
 And I think it's a central feature of emotion state.

1:50:54.680 --> 1:50:56.380
 And I think what underlies

1:50:56.380 --> 1:50:59.860
 are subjective feelings of an emotion.

1:50:59.860 --> 1:51:01.420
 Incredible.

1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:04.300
 David, I have to say, as a true fan of the work

1:51:04.300 --> 1:51:07.060
 that your lab has been doing over so many decades,

1:51:07.060 --> 1:51:09.140
 and first of all, I was delighted

1:51:09.140 --> 1:51:10.620
 when you stopped working on stem cells,

1:51:10.620 --> 1:51:12.540
 not because you weren't doing incredible work there,

1:51:12.540 --> 1:51:16.100
 but because I saw a talk where you showed a movie

1:51:16.100 --> 1:51:19.860
 of an octopus spitting out, or not spitting,

1:51:19.860 --> 1:51:22.340
 but squirting out a bunch of ink and escaping.

1:51:22.340 --> 1:51:24.660
 And you said you were gonna work on things of the sort

1:51:24.660 --> 1:51:25.540
 that we're talking about today,

1:51:25.540 --> 1:51:29.060
 fear, aggression, mating behaviors, social behaviors.

1:51:29.060 --> 1:51:31.420
 It's been incredible to see the work that your lab has done.

1:51:31.420 --> 1:51:36.420
 And I know I speak on behalf of a tremendous number of people

1:51:37.100 --> 1:51:39.220
 when I say thank you for taking time

1:51:39.220 --> 1:51:40.740
 out of your important schedule

1:51:40.740 --> 1:51:42.680
 to share with us what you've learned.

1:51:42.680 --> 1:51:45.460
 My last question is a simple one,

1:51:45.460 --> 1:51:48.340
 which is will you come back and talk to us again

1:51:48.340 --> 1:51:50.820
 in the future about the additional work that's sure to come?

1:51:50.820 --> 1:51:52.300
 I would be happy to do that.

1:51:52.300 --> 1:51:55.700
 And I really have appreciated your questions.

1:51:55.700 --> 1:51:57.460
 They've all been right on the money.

1:51:57.460 --> 1:51:59.620
 You've hit all of the critical,

1:51:59.620 --> 1:52:01.860
 important issues in this field,

1:52:01.860 --> 1:52:05.620
 and you've uncovered what is known,

1:52:05.620 --> 1:52:08.820
 the little bit is known, and how much is not known.

1:52:08.820 --> 1:52:13.100
 And I think it's important to emphasize the unknown things

1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:15.420
 because that's what the next generation

1:52:15.420 --> 1:52:18.100
 of neuroscientists has to solve.

1:52:18.100 --> 1:52:21.140
 And so I hope this will help to attract young people

1:52:21.140 --> 1:52:24.300
 into this field because it's so important,

1:52:24.300 --> 1:52:27.620
 particularly for our understanding of mental illness

1:52:27.620 --> 1:52:31.700
 and mental health and psychiatry,

1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:36.060
 we've got to figure out how emotion systems are controlled

1:52:36.060 --> 1:52:39.920
 in a causal way if we ever want to improve

1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:42.580
 on the psychiatric treatments that we have now.

1:52:42.580 --> 1:52:44.980
 And that's gonna require the next generation

1:52:44.980 --> 1:52:46.780
 of people coming into the field.

1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:48.860
 Absolutely, I second that.

1:52:48.860 --> 1:52:50.380
 Well, thank you, it's been a delight.

1:52:50.380 --> 1:52:53.500
 Thank you, great, really appreciate it.

1:52:53.500 --> 1:52:54.620
 Thank you for joining me today

 It's a truly masterful exploration of the biology

1:53:04.680 --> 1:53:07.180
 and psychology behind what we call emotions

1:53:07.180 --> 1:53:09.060
 and states of mind and body.

1:53:51.220 --> 1:53:52.980
 We are Huberman Lab on Twitter,

1:53:52.980 --> 1:53:55.000
 and we are also Huberman Lab on Instagram.

1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.340
 In both places, I cover science and science-related tools,

1:53:58.340 --> 1:53:59.900
 some of which overlap with the content

1:53:59.900 --> 1:54:01.060
 of the Huberman Lab podcast,

1:54:01.060 --> 1:54:03.300
 but much of which is unique from the content

1:54:03.300 --> 1:54:04.820
 covered on the Huberman Lab podcast.

1:54:04.820 --> 1:54:06.540
 Again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram

1:54:06.540 --> 1:54:08.180
 and Huberman Lab on Twitter.

1:54:08.180 --> 1:54:11.100
 Please also check out our Neural Network monthly newsletter.

1:54:11.100 --> 1:54:14.580
 This is a newsletter that has summaries of podcast episodes.

1:54:14.580 --> 1:54:16.860
 It also includes a lot of actionable protocols.

1:54:16.860 --> 1:54:18.920
 It's very easy to sign up for the newsletter.

1:54:18.920 --> 1:54:21.080
 You go to HubermanLab.com, click on the menu,

1:54:21.080 --> 1:54:23.140
 go to newsletter, you supply your email,

1:54:23.140 --> 1:54:25.140
 but we do not share your email with anybody.

1:54:25.140 --> 1:54:28.060
 We have a very clear and rigorous privacy policy,

1:54:28.060 --> 1:54:30.260
 which is we do not share your email with anybody.

1:54:30.260 --> 1:54:32.780
 And the newsletter comes out once a month,

1:54:32.780 --> 1:54:34.300
 and it is completely zero cost.

1:54:34.300 --> 1:54:36.340
 Again, just go to HubermanLab.com

1:54:36.340 --> 1:54:38.800
 and go to the Neural Network newsletter.

1:54:38.800 --> 1:54:41.120
 I'd also like to point out that the Huberman Lab podcast

1:54:41.120 --> 1:54:44.620
 has a clips channel, so these are brief clips,

1:54:44.620 --> 1:54:46.660
 anywhere from three to 10 minutes

1:54:46.660 --> 1:54:50.240
 that encompass single concepts and actionable protocols

1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:52.140
 related to sleep, to focus,

1:54:52.140 --> 1:54:53.420
 interviews with various guests.

1:54:53.420 --> 1:54:54.800
 We talk about things like caffeine,

1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:57.920
 when to drink caffeine relative to sleep, alcohol,

1:54:57.920 --> 1:54:59.880
 when and how and if anyone should ingest it

1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:03.540
 relative to sleep, dopamine, serotonin, mental health,

1:55:03.540 --> 1:55:05.140
 physical health, and on and on,

1:55:05.140 --> 1:55:07.100
 all the things that relate to the topics

1:55:07.100 --> 1:55:08.440
 most of interest to you.

1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:11.100
 You can find that easily by going to YouTube,

1:55:11.100 --> 1:55:13.980
 look for Huberman Lab clips in the search area,

1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:15.580
 and it will take you there, subscribe,

1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:17.920
 and we are constantly updating those with new clips.

1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:19.460
 This is especially useful, I believe,

1:55:19.460 --> 1:55:21.500
 for people that have missed some of the earlier episodes

1:55:21.500 --> 1:55:23.060
 or you're still working through the back catalog

1:55:23.060 --> 1:55:24.140
 of Huberman Lab podcasts,

1:55:24.140 --> 1:55:26.260
 which admittedly can be rather long.

1:55:26.260 --> 1:55:28.580
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:55:28.580 --> 1:55:30.420
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:55:30.420 --> 1:55:57.420
 I'll see you in the next one.
