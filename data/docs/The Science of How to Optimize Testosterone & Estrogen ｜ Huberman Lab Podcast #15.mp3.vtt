00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.940
 for everyday life.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.160 --> 00:15.320
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.320 --> 00:17.160
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.160 --> 00:18.980
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:18.980 --> 00:21.020
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.020 --> 00:23.100
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.100 --> 00:25.100
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.100 --> 00:26.940
 to the general public.

00:26.940 --> 00:29.160
 Before we begin today, just want to acknowledge

00:29.160 --> 00:30.840
 that if you're watching this on YouTube,

00:30.840 --> 00:33.840
 yes, I have a bandage on the left side of my face.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.200
 I was trying to cook something for Costello and I,

00:36.200 --> 00:38.280
 and I got burned, burned myself.

00:38.280 --> 00:40.040
 It was a cooking accident, I'm fine,

00:40.040 --> 00:41.880
 no need to dwell on it, we can move on.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.000
 But I just wanted to let you know,

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
 everybody's going to be okay.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.480
 He got a great meal, I got a burn and a great meal.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.700
 Today's episode is brought to us by Four Sigmatic.

00:50.700 --> 00:52.600
 Four Sigmatic is a wellness company

00:52.600 --> 00:54.680
 that makes mushroom coffee.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.800
 For those of you that haven't heard

00:55.800 --> 00:58.320
 of mushroom coffee before, just want to make clear,

00:58.320 --> 00:59.840
 these are not psychedelic mushrooms,

00:59.840 --> 01:02.840
 and no, the coffee does not taste like mushrooms at all.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.160
 It tastes amazing, and it tastes like coffee.

01:06.160 --> 01:09.720
 I started using Four Sigmatic coffee a few years ago,

01:09.720 --> 01:11.240
 and then we actually stocked it in my lab,

01:11.240 --> 01:14.940
 we still stock it in my lab, because it tastes really good.

01:14.940 --> 01:17.540
 And it also happens to have two types of mushrooms in it

01:17.540 --> 01:20.760
 that I particularly like because of their supplement

01:20.760 --> 01:22.360
 and medicinal qualities.

01:22.360 --> 01:24.940
 And those two are lion's mane mushroom,

01:24.940 --> 01:27.340
 which has been shown in several research studies

01:27.340 --> 01:30.960
 to have a mild anxiolytic, meaning anti-anxiety effect,

01:30.960 --> 01:32.520
 and mood elevating effect.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.520
 Those are from research studies done independently.

01:35.520 --> 01:37.620
 As well, it has chaga mushroom.

01:37.620 --> 01:41.120
 Chaga mushroom has been shown to increase growth factors

01:41.120 --> 01:44.080
 that impact the nervous system, like nerve growth factor.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.520
 So that's the reason I drink it,

01:45.520 --> 01:47.140
 and that's the reason we stock it in the lab,

01:47.140 --> 01:49.240
 and that's the reason why I drink it at home.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.920

01:50.920 --> 01:54.360

 for up to 40% off and free shipping.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.240
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Blinkist.

02:15.240 --> 02:18.140
 Blinkist is an app that has thousands of nonfiction books

02:18.140 --> 02:21.160
 condensed down to just 15 minutes of key takeaways

02:21.160 --> 02:22.960
 that you can read or listen to.

02:22.960 --> 02:26.360
 For me, I really like listening to books on Blinkist,

02:26.360 --> 02:28.320
 even books that I've already read.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.520
 Typically, the way I consume information

02:30.520 --> 02:34.320
 is unless it's fiction, I'll listen to a nonfiction book

02:34.320 --> 02:36.720
 or I'll read the actual physical hard copy

02:36.720 --> 02:39.100
 of a nonfiction book, and then at the end,

02:39.100 --> 02:40.720
 I like to take some notes about things

02:40.720 --> 02:43.640
 that really stuck with me or key takeaways

02:43.640 --> 02:46.120
 that I'd like to teach or share with other people.

02:46.120 --> 02:48.880
 With Blinkist, it allows me to go back to those books

02:48.880 --> 02:50.680
 and get all the essential items,

02:50.680 --> 02:51.960
 some of which I might've missed

02:51.960 --> 02:53.040
 in the course of listening to

02:53.040 --> 02:54.840
 or reading the full length version.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.440
 And if I haven't read a book before,

02:56.440 --> 02:57.880
 it also gives me a sense of whether or not

02:57.880 --> 02:59.680
 I'd like to read the book.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.840
 Blinkist has some terrific science category books.

03:02.840 --> 03:04.680
 For example, my colleague and friend,

03:04.680 --> 03:06.480
 David Eagleman's book, LiveWired,

03:06.480 --> 03:09.120
 which came out recently is all about neuroplasticity.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.300
 It's a fantastic book.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.680
 I read the full length book

03:11.680 --> 03:13.500
 and I've listened to it on Blinkist

03:13.500 --> 03:17.260
 and it's a terrific synopsis of LiveWired.

03:17.260 --> 03:20.000
 That's in there, David Sinclair's book, Lifespan.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.740
 Many of you probably know that David Sinclair,

03:21.740 --> 03:24.140
 professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School

03:24.140 --> 03:27.880
 is a real pioneer in the aging and longevity field.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.420
 His book, Lifespan is terrific.

03:29.420 --> 03:31.300
 I've read the full length book, I've listened to it

03:31.300 --> 03:33.000
 and I've listened to it on Blinkist.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.280
 And so it really captures a lot of the essential elements

03:35.280 --> 03:37.620
 that you would want to get from that book.

03:37.620 --> 03:39.040
 Blinkist is also just a great way

03:39.040 --> 03:41.000
 to get through many books on the bookshelf

03:41.000 --> 03:42.920
 that you've been meaning to get to

03:42.920 --> 03:44.560
 but you haven't had time.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.920
 With Blinkist, you can get unlimited access to read

03:46.920 --> 03:49.160
 or to listen to a massive library books,

03:49.160 --> 03:50.880
 not just science books.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.880
 And they're all condensed in this way of just 15 minutes

03:53.880 --> 03:56.120
 will allow you to get all the key information.

03:56.120 --> 03:57.800
 So right now for a limited time,

03:57.800 --> 03:59.120
 Blinkist has a special offer

03:59.120 --> 04:01.960

04:23.120 --> 04:26.360
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Theragun.

04:26.360 --> 04:29.160
 Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device

04:29.160 --> 04:31.520
 that releases deep muscle tension.

04:31.520 --> 04:34.360
 I was introduced to Theragun on a dive expedition

04:34.360 --> 04:37.360
 for my laboratory a few years ago.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.920
 On that expedition, we were working very hard,

04:39.920 --> 04:41.080
 we were diving all day,

04:41.080 --> 04:43.560
 we were carrying Pelican cases with equipment,

04:43.560 --> 04:45.880
 we were carrying tanks, very sore,

04:45.880 --> 04:48.840
 very tired by the end of the day as was everybody else.

04:48.840 --> 04:50.400
 Someone brought along a Theragun

04:50.400 --> 04:52.320
 and pretty soon that thing was getting passed around

04:52.320 --> 04:54.640
 and it became the most coveted device on board

04:54.640 --> 04:57.480
 because it really works to relieve the soreness

04:57.480 --> 04:59.480
 and deep muscle tension that accumulates

04:59.480 --> 05:00.880
 with physical work, exercise,

05:00.880 --> 05:03.100
 even just sitting too long throughout the day.

05:03.100 --> 05:05.060
 So when I got back, I got a Theragun,

05:05.060 --> 05:06.960
 I still use the Theragun daily.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.880
 It's terrific because it's very quiet

05:08.880 --> 05:10.960
 so you can use it while watching a movie

05:10.960 --> 05:12.360
 or even while having a conversation

05:12.360 --> 05:14.480
 without it feeling intrusive.

05:14.480 --> 05:17.080
 It really gets down into the meat of the muscle if you want

05:17.080 --> 05:20.060
 or you can use it more superficially if you like.

05:20.060 --> 05:21.600
 If you want to try Theragun,

05:21.600 --> 05:25.000
 you can go to theragun.com slash Huberman.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.680
 They have several models available.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.680
 The first one starts at $190,

05:28.680 --> 05:30.340
 which if you think about it is comparable

05:30.340 --> 05:32.640
 to the price of a professional massage,

05:32.640 --> 05:34.640
 except that unlike a professional massage,

05:34.640 --> 05:37.120
 you can use the Theragun for as long as you want

05:37.120 --> 05:39.980
 throughout the day and for as many days as you like.

05:39.980 --> 05:42.440
 That's theragun.com slash Huberman

05:42.440 --> 05:44.080
 and I should mention that there's also

05:44.080 --> 05:45.760
 a 30-day money back guarantee.

05:45.760 --> 05:47.820
 So if you don't like the product, you send it back,

05:47.820 --> 05:49.160
 you get your money back.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.040
 This month on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

05:51.040 --> 05:52.920
 we're talking all about hormones,

05:52.920 --> 05:56.280
 these incredible chemicals that can impact our mood,

05:56.280 --> 06:00.160
 our behavior, our feelings of optimism or pessimism.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.700
 The amazing thing about hormones

06:01.700 --> 06:04.480
 is that hormones impact all those things,

06:04.480 --> 06:07.000
 but all those things, how we feel and what we do

06:07.000 --> 06:09.920
 and what we think also can impact our hormones.

06:09.920 --> 06:12.280
 And so it's a really fascinating area of biology

06:12.280 --> 06:15.080
 that impacts every single one of us every day,

06:15.080 --> 06:19.040
 both in wakefulness and in sleep and throughout the lifespan

06:19.040 --> 06:21.880
 Today, we're going to be talking about hormone optimization

06:21.880 --> 06:24.600
 and we're mainly going to be focusing on estrogen

06:24.600 --> 06:27.000
 and testosterone and their derivatives.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.480
 Last episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

06:29.480 --> 06:31.580
 we talked about sexual development.

06:31.580 --> 06:35.800
 That is how the chromosomes, the gonads and hormones

06:35.800 --> 06:38.000
 impact what we call sexual development

06:38.000 --> 06:39.880
 leading all the way up to puberty.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.400
 Today, we're mainly going to talk about processes

06:42.400 --> 06:44.420
 that happen from puberty onward.

06:44.420 --> 06:45.600
 Although we might talk a little bit

06:45.600 --> 06:47.000
 about development as well.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.900
 So today we're going to talk a lot about basic biology,

06:49.900 --> 06:52.560
 but we're going to weave in a lot of practical tools

06:52.560 --> 06:54.440
 along the way for how to optimize

06:54.440 --> 06:57.720
 these incredibly powerful things that we call hormones.

06:57.720 --> 06:59.240
 Before we dive into our discussion

06:59.240 --> 07:01.060
 about hormone optimization,

07:01.060 --> 07:03.520
 I want to raise what I think is a very important point

07:03.520 --> 07:06.600
 that at least I hadn't heard of until recently,

07:06.600 --> 07:09.580
 which is the concept of salutogenesis.

07:09.580 --> 07:12.760
 Many of us are familiar with the concept of pathogenesis,

07:12.760 --> 07:14.940
 the idea that there are all these scary diseases

07:14.940 --> 07:18.040
 like dementia and heart disease and stroke

07:18.040 --> 07:19.820
 and all these things that await us

07:19.820 --> 07:21.480
 if we don't take good care of ourselves

07:21.480 --> 07:24.320
 and that might await us even if we do.

07:24.320 --> 07:26.200
 That's the pathogenic model.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.100
 Salutogenesis is something I learned about

07:28.100 --> 07:30.240
 from one of my Stanford Medicine colleagues,

07:30.240 --> 07:32.160
 which is a different orientation toward health

07:32.160 --> 07:35.520
 and wellbeing where you're taking on particular behaviors,

07:35.520 --> 07:38.360
 you're taking on a particular stance towards nutrition

07:38.360 --> 07:40.780
 and exercise, supplementation, et cetera,

07:40.780 --> 07:44.300
 in order to promote wellbeing above where you would be

07:44.300 --> 07:46.640
 if you were not doing those behaviors.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.460
 If you think about these two things,

07:48.460 --> 07:50.800
 salutogenesis and the pathogenic model

07:50.800 --> 07:53.200
 are really two sides of the same coin,

07:53.200 --> 07:54.680
 but I'll just give an example

07:54.680 --> 07:57.560
 of how this might affect you in a real way.

07:57.560 --> 08:01.200
 If you like exercise because it feels good, great,

08:01.200 --> 08:04.760
 but many people exercise or eat well for that matter

08:04.760 --> 08:08.200
 in order to avoid heart disease or to avoid dementia,

08:08.200 --> 08:12.440
 to avoid negative changes in body composition.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.240
 And while that's powerful and certainly is the case,

08:15.240 --> 08:18.100
 that exercise will help you move away from all those things,

08:18.100 --> 08:20.920
 the salutogenesis model differs in that

08:20.920 --> 08:22.760
 it involves a mindset and an orientation

08:22.760 --> 08:25.300
 towards doing those things in order to feel good,

08:25.300 --> 08:27.240
 in order to enhance your level of energy,

08:27.240 --> 08:29.360
 in order to improve endocrine function

08:29.360 --> 08:30.900
 and metabolic function.

08:30.900 --> 08:33.800
 So it's really part of the pathogenic model

08:33.800 --> 08:36.420
 and yet salutogenesis is really more of a mindset

08:36.420 --> 08:38.760
 toward why you would do these particular behaviors.

08:38.760 --> 08:41.160
 And really the most powerful mindset is going to be one

08:41.160 --> 08:43.800
 where you are thinking about the pathogenic model,

08:43.800 --> 08:46.640
 doing things so that you don't end up sick, et cetera,

08:46.640 --> 08:48.340
 and to move away from sickness,

08:48.340 --> 08:50.420
 as well as the salutogenic model,

08:50.420 --> 08:51.260
 where you're doing things

08:51.260 --> 08:53.740
 in order to move towards health and wellbeing.

08:53.740 --> 08:55.680
 We think of health and wellness nowadays

08:55.680 --> 08:58.680
 or the wellness community or wellness practices,

08:58.680 --> 09:00.280
 and in many ways,

09:00.280 --> 09:02.900
 that is the essence of the salutogenic model,

09:02.900 --> 09:04.600
 but I found it very interesting to know

09:04.600 --> 09:06.820
 that within the field of allopathic medicine,

09:06.820 --> 09:07.880
 these two models exist,

09:07.880 --> 09:09.840
 but we don't hear about the salutogenic model

09:09.840 --> 09:11.000
 quite as often.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.320
 So it's just something to keep in mind,

09:12.320 --> 09:14.440
 especially because of some of the mindset effects

09:14.440 --> 09:16.760
 that were discussed in previous episodes.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.480
 I'm not going to go into these in detail again right now,

09:19.480 --> 09:23.240
 but if you might recall from the episode on food and mood,

09:23.240 --> 09:25.120
 we talked about some of these incredible studies

09:25.120 --> 09:28.180
 that were done by Alia Crum's group at Stanford and others,

09:28.180 --> 09:30.600
 showing that if you tell people

09:30.600 --> 09:32.800
 that the behavior that they're about to do,

09:32.800 --> 09:35.160
 in this case, it was people cleaning up hotel rooms

09:35.160 --> 09:36.340
 because that was their job,

09:36.340 --> 09:38.400
 if you tell them that it's good for them,

09:38.400 --> 09:41.420
 then you see much greater positive health effects

09:41.420 --> 09:43.600
 than if they aren't aware of that information,

09:43.600 --> 09:44.680
 that it's good for them.

09:44.680 --> 09:46.640
 So we should really be thinking about

09:46.640 --> 09:49.100
 not just moving away from disease and negative things,

09:49.100 --> 09:51.700
 but also why certain things are good for us,

09:51.700 --> 09:53.560
 because it's well-established now

09:53.560 --> 09:55.660
 from really good scientific studies,

09:55.660 --> 09:58.440
 that keeping in mind the positive effects of things

09:58.440 --> 10:01.880
 can really have an outsized effect on wellbeing

10:01.880 --> 10:04.980
 right down to the level of our physiology.

10:04.980 --> 10:07.660
 So let's talk about hormone optimization.

10:07.660 --> 10:10.540
 Today, we're going to talk about hormone optimization

10:10.540 --> 10:13.320
 in reference to estrogen and testosterone

10:13.320 --> 10:14.920
 and their derivatives.

10:14.920 --> 10:17.680
 Now, estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives

10:17.680 --> 10:20.140
 are what we call sex steroids.

10:20.140 --> 10:24.580
 Now, the sex steroids immediately call to mind sex,

10:24.580 --> 10:25.760
 for obvious reasons,

10:25.760 --> 10:28.720
 and steroids, meaning anabolic steroids.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.760
 But I just want to emphasize that estrogen and testosterone

10:31.760 --> 10:33.500
 are present in everybody.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.460
 It's their ratios that determine their effects.

10:36.460 --> 10:37.720
 So today, we're going to talk about

10:37.720 --> 10:39.340
 how you can optimize their ratios

10:39.340 --> 10:41.840
 depending on your particular life goals,

10:41.840 --> 10:44.720
 because the ratio of estrogen and testosterone

10:44.720 --> 10:48.080
 in every individual has profound influence

10:48.080 --> 10:52.260
 on feelings of wellbeing, feelings of optimism,

10:52.260 --> 10:55.240
 feelings of anxiety or lack of anxiety,

10:55.240 --> 10:58.000
 on reproduction, on sexual behavior

10:58.000 --> 11:00.020
 independent of reproduction.

11:00.020 --> 11:03.220
 They are profoundly powerful molecules,

11:03.220 --> 11:06.840
 and we all make these molecules to some degree or another,

11:06.840 --> 11:09.860
 but there are also important behavioral tools,

11:09.860 --> 11:13.400
 supplementation tools, as well as prescription drugs

11:13.400 --> 11:16.580
 that can impact the ratios of testosterone and estrogen

11:16.580 --> 11:18.200
 in really powerful ways.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.320
 So we're going to cover all of that.

11:20.320 --> 11:24.120
 I want to emphasize that when you hear sex steroids

11:24.120 --> 11:25.560
 or steroid hormones,

11:25.560 --> 11:28.200
 most people think about anabolic steroids.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.560
 And of course, anabolic steroids

11:30.560 --> 11:34.860
 are derivatives of testosterone or testosterone itself.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.200
 And they are heavily used and abused

11:37.200 --> 11:38.200
 in the sports community,

11:38.200 --> 11:40.280
 as well as outside the sports community.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.260
 But there, of course, are many steroids

11:42.260 --> 11:43.700
 that are not anabolic steroids

11:43.700 --> 11:45.220
 that are also abused in sports.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.500
 Today, we're not talking about drugs and sports,

11:47.500 --> 11:49.860
 but I think that it carries such a heavy weight

11:49.860 --> 11:51.340
 when people hear the word steroids,

11:51.340 --> 11:54.020
 they think about anabolic steroids.

11:54.020 --> 11:56.400
 So while today's discussion will certainly be relevant

11:56.400 --> 11:57.600
 to physical performance, in fact,

11:57.600 --> 12:00.540
 we're going to talk about how specific types of exercise,

12:00.540 --> 12:02.760
 particular patterns of cold exposure,

12:02.760 --> 12:04.840
 as well as particular patterns, believe it or not,

12:04.840 --> 12:08.920
 of breathing can impact sex steroid hormones,

12:08.920 --> 12:11.120
 both estrogen and testosterone.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.600
 The discussion isn't really geared

12:12.600 --> 12:14.560
 towards performance enhancement in sport,

12:14.560 --> 12:16.580
 although we will do an entire episode,

12:16.580 --> 12:17.860
 perhaps even an entire month

12:17.860 --> 12:21.400
 related to performance enhancement in physical enterprises.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.340
 So one of the first things to understand

12:23.340 --> 12:25.520
 if you want to optimize your hormones

12:25.520 --> 12:27.300
 is where they come from.

12:27.300 --> 12:29.060
 There are a lot of different glands in the body

12:29.060 --> 12:30.060
 that produce hormones.

12:30.060 --> 12:31.940
 There's the pineal gland.

12:31.940 --> 12:34.620
 Some hormones are made in the hypothalamus.

12:34.620 --> 12:36.340
 Hormones are made by the gonads,

12:36.340 --> 12:38.620
 the ovaries or the testes.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.380
 You've got the thyroid gland.

12:40.380 --> 12:41.580
 There are a bunch of different glands

12:41.580 --> 12:43.100
 that make these different hormones,

12:43.100 --> 12:45.100
 but when we're talking about the sex steroid hormones,

12:45.100 --> 12:46.460
 estrogen and testosterone,

12:46.460 --> 12:49.700
 the major sources are ovaries for estrogen

12:49.700 --> 12:51.300
 and the testes for testosterone,

12:51.300 --> 12:55.080
 although the adrenals can also make testosterone.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.380
 Now, there are also some enzymes.

12:57.380 --> 13:01.740
 Enzymes are things that can change chemical composition,

13:01.740 --> 13:03.780
 and the enzymes that we're going to talk about today

13:03.780 --> 13:05.900
 are the aromatases mainly.

13:05.900 --> 13:09.440
 The aromatases convert testosterone into estrogen.

13:09.440 --> 13:13.300
 So in a male, for instance, that has very high testosterone,

13:13.300 --> 13:15.100
 some of that is going to be converted

13:15.100 --> 13:16.660
 into estrogen by aromatase,

13:16.660 --> 13:18.760
 and aromatase is made by body fat.

13:18.760 --> 13:21.100
 It's also made in the testes themselves.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.200
 A lot of people don't realize this,

13:22.200 --> 13:24.240
 but the testes actually have the capacity

13:24.240 --> 13:28.500
 to manufacture estrogen and aromatase, albeit at low levels,

13:28.500 --> 13:30.180
 but this turns out to be important

13:30.180 --> 13:34.900
 for optimizing hormone levels in males at later points,

13:34.900 --> 13:36.300
 and we'll discuss that.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.260
 It's important to note that there's a huge range

13:38.260 --> 13:40.100
 in terms of the levels of hormones,

13:40.100 --> 13:43.500
 testosterone and estrogen, between individuals,

13:43.500 --> 13:45.100
 and it actually occurs

13:45.100 --> 13:47.100
 within individuals across the lifespan.

13:47.100 --> 13:48.780
 I'm not going to throw out specific numbers

13:48.780 --> 13:51.580
 of X picograms per deciliter, et cetera, today,

13:51.580 --> 13:53.540
 because that's going to vary a lot.

13:53.540 --> 13:54.500
 It's going to depend on whether or not

13:54.500 --> 13:56.480
 you're measuring in picograms or nanograms

13:56.480 --> 13:57.320
 and that sort of thing.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.860
 If you want to examine your hormones,

13:58.860 --> 14:02.020
 you should do that in conjunction with a medical doctor,

14:02.020 --> 14:03.260
 ideally an endocrinologist,

14:03.260 --> 14:05.160
 can help you sort out that information,

14:05.160 --> 14:07.700
 but the important thing to know is that

14:07.700 --> 14:10.660
 prepubescent females make very little estrogen,

14:10.660 --> 14:11.660
 and when we talk about estrogen,

14:11.660 --> 14:13.340
 we mainly talk about estradiol,

14:13.340 --> 14:15.520
 which is the most active form of estrogen

14:15.520 --> 14:17.300
 in both males and females.

14:17.300 --> 14:20.860
 So prepubescent females, very low levels of estrogen.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.740
 During puberty, levels of estrogen,

14:23.740 --> 14:26.740
 AKA estradiol, basically skyrocket,

14:26.740 --> 14:29.220
 and then across the lifespan,

14:29.220 --> 14:30.380
 estrogen is going to vary

14:30.380 --> 14:32.320
 depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle,

14:32.320 --> 14:34.180
 but as one heads into menopause,

14:34.180 --> 14:36.060
 which typically takes place nowadays,

14:36.060 --> 14:38.800
 somewhere between age 45 and 60,

14:38.800 --> 14:40.300
 levels of estrogen are going to drop,

14:40.300 --> 14:43.100
 and then post-menopause levels of estrogen are very low.

14:44.140 --> 14:46.840
 As well, testosterone will fluctuate across the lifespan.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.220
 Testosterone is going to be relatively low,

14:49.220 --> 14:51.340
 pre-puberty in males.

14:51.340 --> 14:53.860
 During puberty, it's going to skyrocket,

14:53.860 --> 14:57.160
 and then the current numbers are that it drops off

14:57.160 --> 14:59.380
 at about a rate of 1% per year,

14:59.380 --> 15:00.980
 although we're going to talk about some data

15:00.980 --> 15:01.900
 that show that there's actually

15:01.900 --> 15:04.420
 tremendous variation in testosterone levels.

15:04.420 --> 15:08.020
 There's actually a lot of examples of men in their 90s,

15:08.020 --> 15:10.540
 their 90s, who still have testosterone levels

15:10.540 --> 15:13.320
 that mimic pubertal levels, which is remarkable

15:13.320 --> 15:15.780
 and speaks to the huge variation in testosterone levels

15:15.780 --> 15:17.540
 across individuals.

15:17.540 --> 15:20.900
 So let's talk about other sources of these hormones,

15:20.900 --> 15:24.260
 and then it will make clear what avenues

15:24.260 --> 15:27.540
 you might want to take in order to optimize these hormones.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.680
 The other glands and tissues in the body

15:29.680 --> 15:32.620
 that make these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,

15:32.620 --> 15:34.860
 as I mentioned briefly, are the adrenals.

15:34.860 --> 15:37.140
 So the adrenals right up top the kidneys,

15:37.140 --> 15:41.180
 and the release of these steroid hormones from the adrenals,

15:41.180 --> 15:42.480
 in particular testosterone

15:42.480 --> 15:45.280
 and some of its related derivatives,

15:45.280 --> 15:48.860
 are mainly activated by competition.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.900
 So let's talk about competition,

15:50.900 --> 15:53.500
 because it turns out that competition

15:53.500 --> 15:57.960
 is a powerful influence on the sex steroid hormones,

15:57.960 --> 15:59.300
 and the sex steroid hormones

15:59.300 --> 16:02.180
 powerfully influence competition.

16:02.180 --> 16:03.740
 So most people don't realize this,

16:03.740 --> 16:07.540
 but most males of a given mammalian species

16:07.540 --> 16:08.860
 never get to reproduce.

16:08.860 --> 16:11.900
 In fact, they never even get to have sex at all.

16:11.900 --> 16:13.560
 And we don't often think about that,

16:13.560 --> 16:16.900
 but testosterone plays a powerful role

16:16.900 --> 16:19.340
 in determining which members of a given species

16:19.340 --> 16:20.660
 will get to reproduce,

16:20.660 --> 16:22.780
 which ones of that species

16:22.780 --> 16:25.460
 will actually get access to females.

16:25.460 --> 16:28.600
 And so here I'm not talking about humans specifically,

16:28.600 --> 16:33.160
 but it's well-known in species like elephant seals,

16:33.160 --> 16:37.980
 in species like antlered animals and rams, for instance,

16:37.980 --> 16:39.780
 that the higher levels of testosterone

16:39.780 --> 16:42.280
 correlate with access to females.

16:42.280 --> 16:44.460
 Now, one interpretation of this

16:44.460 --> 16:46.700
 is that the females are detecting

16:46.700 --> 16:49.320
 which males have high testosterone and selecting them.

16:49.320 --> 16:50.540
 They're more receptive to them.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.660
 We're going to talk about receptivity for mating

16:53.660 --> 16:54.860
 in a moment.

16:54.860 --> 16:57.840
 But it's actually more so

16:57.840 --> 17:00.380
 that the males that have higher testosterone

17:01.360 --> 17:05.140
 forage further and will fight harder for the females.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.420
 And this is really interesting

17:06.420 --> 17:08.360
 because there's very good evidence now

17:08.360 --> 17:11.920
 that testosterone can reduce anxiety,

17:11.920 --> 17:13.820
 promote novelty seeking,

17:13.820 --> 17:17.220
 and promote competitive interactions.

17:17.220 --> 17:19.640
 And so before you leap too far with this in your mind

17:19.640 --> 17:21.480
 and think about all these human behaviors,

17:21.480 --> 17:22.320
 just stay with me

17:22.320 --> 17:23.560
 because there's a little bit of biology here

17:23.560 --> 17:24.900
 that makes it all make sense.

17:24.900 --> 17:27.100
 And it turns out to be pretty simple.

17:28.340 --> 17:31.120
 We have a brain region called the amygdala.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.540
 In Latin, that just means almond.

17:32.540 --> 17:35.100
 But the amygdala is most famous for its role in fear.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.660
 We hear a lot about fear and the amygdala.

17:37.660 --> 17:40.700
 But the amygdala is really involved in threat detection.

17:40.700 --> 17:43.420
 It sets our thresholds for anxiety

17:43.420 --> 17:46.920
 and what we consider scary or too much.

17:46.920 --> 17:49.540
 Testosterone, secreted from the gonads

17:49.540 --> 17:50.860
 and elsewhere in the body,

17:50.860 --> 17:52.840
 binds to the amygdala

17:52.840 --> 17:55.660
 and changes the threshold for stress.

17:55.660 --> 17:59.140
 So I've said before on previous versions of this podcast

17:59.140 --> 18:00.500
 and on other podcasts,

18:00.500 --> 18:03.200
 that testosterone has this incredible effect

18:03.200 --> 18:05.900
 of making effort feel good.

18:05.900 --> 18:07.300
 But what I was really referring to

18:07.300 --> 18:10.540
 is the fact that testosterone lowers stress and anxiety,

18:10.540 --> 18:14.300
 in particular, in males of a given species.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.340
 Now, this is important

18:15.340 --> 18:17.840
 because we often think of testosterone

18:17.840 --> 18:19.720
 as creating whatever,

18:19.720 --> 18:22.340
 masculinization or it's, you know,

18:22.340 --> 18:25.180
 virilization or all these terms are thrown around.

18:25.180 --> 18:26.260
 But what's it really doing

18:26.260 --> 18:28.380
 when it comes to mate choice and competition?

18:28.380 --> 18:31.740
 What it's doing is it's reducing the threshold for anxiety.

18:31.740 --> 18:32.880
 And in doing so,

18:32.880 --> 18:35.540
 it selects individuals of a given species

18:35.540 --> 18:36.860
 to push further,

18:36.860 --> 18:40.040
 being willing to, you know, suffer more,

18:40.040 --> 18:41.340
 although it also reduces pain,

18:41.340 --> 18:42.820
 so maybe they also suffer less,

18:42.820 --> 18:45.780
 in pursuit of reproduction in females.

18:45.780 --> 18:47.660
 Now, it's well-known in humans

18:47.660 --> 18:49.620
 that both males and females

18:49.620 --> 18:51.940
 who have elevated levels of testosterone

18:51.940 --> 18:54.060
 will engage in more novelty seeking.

18:54.060 --> 18:55.420
 And I do want to point out

18:55.420 --> 18:59.460
 that even individuals without testes have testosterone

18:59.460 --> 19:02.420
 and peaks in testosterone have similar effects,

19:02.420 --> 19:06.180
 regardless of whether or not someone has ovaries or testes.

19:06.180 --> 19:08.140
 Testosterone increases

19:08.140 --> 19:10.820
 generally lead to more foraging,

19:10.820 --> 19:12.580
 more novelty seeking,

19:12.580 --> 19:16.240
 increases in libido and increases in desire to mate.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.900
 So it is the case that increases in testosterone

19:18.900 --> 19:22.020
 promote competitive and foraging type behaviors

19:22.020 --> 19:26.180
 in humans and in non-human mammals.

19:26.180 --> 19:30.240
 But it's also true that competition itself

19:30.240 --> 19:33.300
 can increase androgens such as testosterone.

19:33.300 --> 19:34.180
 I want to repeat that.

19:34.180 --> 19:36.440
 Competitive environments themselves

19:36.440 --> 19:38.640
 can increase testosterone.

19:38.640 --> 19:41.560
 Now, some people have come to the conclusion

19:41.560 --> 19:43.900
 that if you win, your testosterone goes up,

19:43.900 --> 19:46.880
 and if you lose, your testosterone goes down.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.420
 And to some extent that's true,

19:48.420 --> 19:50.540
 but that's not a direct effect on the gonads.

19:50.540 --> 19:53.320
 That's actually mediated by the neuromodulator dopamine.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.020
 We talked about dopamine in the episode

19:55.020 --> 19:56.700
 on motivation and drive.

19:56.700 --> 19:58.260
 And dopamine and testosterone

19:58.260 --> 20:01.140
 have a remarkable interplay in the body.

20:01.140 --> 20:03.260
 Dopamine is actually released in the brain

20:03.260 --> 20:05.440
 in ways that has the pituitary,

20:05.440 --> 20:07.720
 this gland that sits over the roof of your mouth,

20:07.720 --> 20:09.720
 release certain hormones that then go on

20:09.720 --> 20:12.220
 to promote the release of more testosterone.

20:12.220 --> 20:15.980
 And indeed, winning promotes more dopamine

20:15.980 --> 20:18.700
 and later more testosterone.

20:18.700 --> 20:20.600
 However, in the short term,

20:20.600 --> 20:23.180
 just competing increases testosterone

20:23.180 --> 20:26.020
 independent of whether or not you win or lose.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.340
 So the short version of this

20:28.340 --> 20:32.180
 is that competition increases testosterone.

20:32.180 --> 20:34.120
 And this may be an ancient mechanism

20:34.120 --> 20:37.380
 whereby the androgens such as testosterone

20:37.380 --> 20:38.860
 are feeding back to encourage

20:38.860 --> 20:41.380
 more competitive type behaviors.

20:41.380 --> 20:42.780
 Because every species,

20:42.780 --> 20:44.380
 whether or not you're talking about reproduction

20:44.380 --> 20:46.060
 or other resource allocation,

20:46.060 --> 20:47.620
 is involved in competition.

20:47.620 --> 20:49.540
 Not every individual of a species

20:49.540 --> 20:51.620
 gets access to the same number of mates

20:51.620 --> 20:53.500
 or the same quality of mates.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.980
 And this is true in both directions

20:54.980 --> 20:57.180
 for males and females and everything in between.

20:57.180 --> 20:59.260
 So I just want to emphasize once more,

20:59.260 --> 21:01.080
 in case I went through it too quickly,

21:01.080 --> 21:04.340
 that increases in testosterone in females

21:04.340 --> 21:08.540
 are also going to lead to increase in reproductive behavior

21:08.540 --> 21:10.660
 or seeking out reproductive behavior.

21:10.660 --> 21:11.680
 They increase libido.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.860
 In fact, there's a particular phase of the menstrual cycle

21:13.860 --> 21:17.620
 where testosterone peaks just before ovulation

21:17.620 --> 21:22.620
 that on average leads female humans to seek out sex

21:22.620 --> 21:24.880
 more than they would otherwise during their cycle.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.460
 And this is all by self-report,

21:26.460 --> 21:29.460
 but this is also while measuring things like testosterone,

21:29.460 --> 21:31.160
 estrogen ratios, and so forth.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.440
 So it's really interesting that a single molecule,

21:33.440 --> 21:36.160
 regardless of chromosomal or gonadal background,

21:36.160 --> 21:41.160
 is increasing seeking of mates across individuals,

21:41.220 --> 21:44.860
 increasing desire to compete or willingness to compete,

21:44.860 --> 21:48.220
 and lowering the threshold for stress and anxiety.

21:48.220 --> 21:49.440
 It's important to point out

21:49.440 --> 21:51.620
 that while increases in testosterone

21:51.620 --> 21:55.620
 promote seeking of mates and reproduction

21:55.620 --> 21:57.740
 in both males and females,

21:57.740 --> 22:01.100
 in females, it's actually increases in estrogen

22:01.100 --> 22:03.820
 that promote receptivity to mating.

22:03.820 --> 22:06.540
 So testosterone is driving the seeking of sex

22:06.540 --> 22:11.260
 and estrogen is promoting the actual act of sex

22:11.260 --> 22:14.860
 from females, so-called receptivity, consensual receptivity.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.860
 In males, it's interesting to point out

22:16.860 --> 22:20.100
 that testosterone is promoting seeking of sex,

22:20.100 --> 22:24.800
 but it's also estrogen in males that's important for libido.

22:24.800 --> 22:27.460
 If estrogen levels are brought too low,

22:27.460 --> 22:29.580
 then men will completely lose their libido.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.960
 This is often not discussed or overlooked

22:31.960 --> 22:34.600
 in the discussion about testosterone therapy

22:34.600 --> 22:36.300
 and performance-enhancing drugs.

22:36.300 --> 22:38.980
 People think that hyperandrogenized individuals,

22:38.980 --> 22:41.480
 meaning people that have very high levels of androgen,

22:41.480 --> 22:43.520
 will have very high levels of libido,

22:43.520 --> 22:46.900
 and they will provided estrogen is available

22:46.900 --> 22:49.840
 in sufficient ratios to match that testosterone.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.180
 So it's not simply the case

22:51.180 --> 22:53.200
 that high levels of testosterone

22:53.200 --> 22:56.180
 produce a lot of sex and mating behavior

22:56.180 --> 22:58.460
 and low levels of estrogen are good across the board.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.300
 You actually need both in both males and females.

23:01.300 --> 23:02.840
 It's just that in females,

23:02.840 --> 23:05.560
 the testosterone levels are always going to be lower

23:05.560 --> 23:06.580
 than the estrogen levels.

23:06.580 --> 23:08.360
 And in males, the estrogen levels

23:08.360 --> 23:10.740
 are always going to be lower than testosterone levels.

23:10.740 --> 23:14.340
 So testosterone promotes sex-seeking behavior.

23:14.340 --> 23:16.000
 And the real question then is,

23:16.000 --> 23:18.760
 does sex itself promote testosterone?

23:18.760 --> 23:21.540
 And the answer is somewhat complicated,

23:21.540 --> 23:24.720
 but the short version is yes.

23:24.720 --> 23:28.220
 And as you recall, sex has multiple stages.

23:28.220 --> 23:30.180
 So there's the physical act of sex,

23:30.180 --> 23:31.580
 there's the seeking of sex,

23:31.580 --> 23:34.740
 and then there's orgasm and ejaculation.

23:34.740 --> 23:37.760
 Now, it's important to distinguish between these

23:37.760 --> 23:41.580
 because whether or not sex itself increases testosterone

23:41.580 --> 23:44.820
 depends on whether or not the male ejaculates.

23:44.820 --> 23:46.820
 And this is very important to understand

23:46.820 --> 23:48.540
 because on a previous episode,

23:48.540 --> 23:51.760
 I mentioned how dopamine increases with sexual activity.

23:51.760 --> 23:53.500
 Remember, dopamine and testosterone

23:53.500 --> 23:56.860
 tend to increase linearly with one another.

23:56.860 --> 23:59.700
 But then after ejaculation, there's a release of prolactin,

23:59.700 --> 24:02.740
 and prolactin actually sets the refractory period in males

24:02.740 --> 24:05.260
 during which he can't have sex again.

24:05.260 --> 24:07.160
 And the duration of the refractory period

24:07.160 --> 24:09.380
 will vary tremendously depending on how much

24:09.380 --> 24:12.260
 and how long that prolactin release occurs.

24:12.260 --> 24:14.360
 I also described in a previous episode

24:14.360 --> 24:16.980
 how some people take vitamin B6,

24:16.980 --> 24:18.100
 I'm not suggesting anyone do this,

24:18.100 --> 24:21.540
 but take vitamin B6 in order to reduce prolactin levels

24:21.540 --> 24:24.660
 and thereby reduce the duration of the refractory period.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.020
 But getting at this question

24:26.020 --> 24:28.700
 about testosterone and sexual behavior,

24:28.700 --> 24:29.820
 it's important to distinguish

24:29.820 --> 24:31.740
 between these different phases of reproduction

24:31.740 --> 24:33.640
 or reproductive behaviors.

24:33.640 --> 24:36.340
 So there are studies showing

24:36.340 --> 24:40.060
 that sexual behavior itself can increase testosterone.

24:40.060 --> 24:43.380
 There was a study published in 2011 from Escasa et al.,

24:43.380 --> 24:46.420
 E-S-C-A-S-A, this is the stuff of textbooks,

24:46.420 --> 24:49.900
 this is on PubMed, these are quality studies,

24:49.900 --> 24:53.980
 showing that men who observe sex,

24:53.980 --> 24:56.900
 so I guess this would be observing pornography,

24:56.900 --> 24:59.700
 will have slight increases in testosterone

24:59.700 --> 25:01.080
 during the observation.

25:01.080 --> 25:03.900
 These people actually were willing to have blood draws taken

25:03.900 --> 25:05.740
 while watching pornography.

25:05.740 --> 25:07.500
 They had increases in testosterone

25:07.500 --> 25:10.620
 that were very modest of about 10%.

25:10.620 --> 25:13.560
 Whereas when people participated in sex,

25:13.560 --> 25:15.680
 they actually did this study where people had blood draws

25:15.680 --> 25:18.340
 and they had real sex with their partners,

25:18.340 --> 25:22.240
 and they had 70% increases in testosterone.

25:22.240 --> 25:24.400
 So there are increases in testosterone

25:24.400 --> 25:29.020
 that are quite significant during the physical act of sex

25:29.020 --> 25:32.480
 and far less so during observing sex.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.260
 Now, the question that I often get,

25:34.260 --> 25:36.180
 in fact, it's one of the questions I get most often

25:36.180 --> 25:38.680
 in the comments on YouTube, I don't know why that is,

25:38.680 --> 25:43.680
 is whether or not ejaculation adjusts testosterone levels.

25:44.500 --> 25:47.140
 And it turns out there are two studies that I could find

25:47.140 --> 25:50.000
 that were quality studies on PubMed that addressed this,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.180
 that sex and ejaculation itself

25:52.180 --> 25:54.800
 does not reduce testosterone levels,

25:54.800 --> 25:57.340
 although it will increase prolactin levels

25:57.340 --> 25:59.400
 for the reasons I described a moment ago.

25:59.400 --> 26:04.400
 However, abstinence or sex without ejaculation

26:05.260 --> 26:09.020
 for a week or more will increase testosterone levels

26:09.020 --> 26:11.420
 up to 400%.

26:11.420 --> 26:13.900
 So the answer is actually complicated.

26:13.900 --> 26:15.460
 It's not straightforward.

26:15.460 --> 26:18.600
 What it means is that sex itself increases testosterone.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.380
 However, abstinence also increases testosterone

26:21.380 --> 26:22.580
 even further.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.660
 So it's a nuanced answer.

26:24.660 --> 26:27.560
 And I hope this is satisfactory, no pun intended,

26:27.560 --> 26:29.560
 to those of you that have been asking me

26:29.560 --> 26:33.020
 what is the relationship between sex and ejaculation

26:33.020 --> 26:34.740
 and testosterone and dopamine?

26:34.740 --> 26:36.220
 It is nuanced.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.380
 And you have to understand that nuance

26:38.380 --> 26:40.960
 if you want to understand how certain behaviors

26:40.960 --> 26:44.140
 impact hormones and how hormones impact those behaviors.

26:44.140 --> 26:46.060
 As I mentioned before, in females,

26:46.060 --> 26:51.020
 testosterone also primes the motivation to seek out sex.

26:51.020 --> 26:55.880
 And sex itself also increases testosterone,

26:55.880 --> 26:58.040
 but it also increases prolactin.

26:58.040 --> 27:00.660
 So in both men and women,

27:00.660 --> 27:04.620
 sex increases prolactin post-sex.

27:04.620 --> 27:06.340
 It's just the way that the system works.

27:06.340 --> 27:08.560
 It's that testosterone and dopamine increase

27:08.560 --> 27:12.140
 in the seeking out and the behavior of sex.

27:12.140 --> 27:15.940
 And then after sex, prolactin levels go up.

27:15.940 --> 27:17.100
 There's kind of a quiescence.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.220
 The whole nervous system is promoted towards calm.

27:19.220 --> 27:21.460
 And this may actually have something to do with pair bonding

27:21.460 --> 27:23.780
 and the encouragement of individuals

27:23.780 --> 27:26.260
 to spend more time together to exchange different smells

27:26.260 --> 27:27.900
 and hormones and maybe even pheromones.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.860
 And we're going to talk about pheromones in a moment.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.900
 A few years ago, there was a lot of excitement

27:31.900 --> 27:33.820
 about the hormone DHEA,

27:33.820 --> 27:35.980
 which is mainly made by the adrenals.

27:35.980 --> 27:40.260
 DHEA has been promoted as kind of a catchall

27:40.260 --> 27:42.580
 for increasing testosterone and estrogen

27:42.580 --> 27:43.580
 in males and females.

27:43.580 --> 27:46.260
 And indeed, DHEA will increase

27:46.260 --> 27:48.140
 both testosterone and estrogen.

27:48.140 --> 27:49.700
 This is something to be mindful of

27:49.700 --> 27:51.380
 if you're thinking about taking DHEA

27:51.380 --> 27:54.620
 or you're taking DHEA already.

27:54.620 --> 27:57.820
 DHEA will increase both testosterone and estrogen

27:57.820 --> 28:00.780
 and the extent to which it increases one or the other

28:00.780 --> 28:02.720
 will depend on whether or not you're starting off

28:02.720 --> 28:04.660
 with more estrogen than testosterone

28:04.660 --> 28:05.500
 or whether or not you're starting off

28:05.500 --> 28:07.060
 with more testosterone than estrogen

28:07.060 --> 28:09.380
 and whether or not you have a lot of aromatase.

28:09.380 --> 28:11.380
 So for individuals that have a lot of aromatase

28:11.380 --> 28:13.740
 being made by the testes or by body fat,

28:13.740 --> 28:15.560
 if you take DHEA, there's a good chance

28:15.560 --> 28:17.580
 that a fair portion of that is going to be shuttled

28:17.580 --> 28:19.020
 towards estrogen production

28:19.020 --> 28:21.420
 and not towards testosterone production.

28:21.420 --> 28:24.140
 Whereas in individuals that have low levels of testosterone

28:24.140 --> 28:25.940
 to begin with, high levels of estrogen,

28:25.940 --> 28:27.220
 there's a good chance that the DHEA

28:27.220 --> 28:29.340
 is going to promote mainly estrogen production.

28:29.340 --> 28:30.860
 At least that's what I could find

28:30.860 --> 28:33.080
 from the research studies that I examined.

28:33.080 --> 28:34.540
 So the way to think about DHEA,

28:34.540 --> 28:39.540
 it's a kind of global promoter of the sex steroid hormones

28:39.540 --> 28:41.640
 and its specific effects are going to depend

28:41.640 --> 28:43.060
 a little bit on where you started

28:43.060 --> 28:45.220
 and whether or not you have ovaries or testes.

28:45.220 --> 28:46.460
 So just as there are behaviors

28:46.460 --> 28:48.580
 that can increase testosterone,

28:48.580 --> 28:51.860
 there are behaviors that can decrease testosterone.

28:51.860 --> 28:55.600
 And one of the most well-characterized ones in humans

28:55.600 --> 28:58.320
 is becoming a parent.

28:58.320 --> 29:03.320
 So expecting fathers have an almost 50% decrease

29:03.320 --> 29:08.020
 in testosterone levels, both free and bound testosterone.

29:09.520 --> 29:12.180
 As well, their cortisol levels, a stress hormone,

29:12.180 --> 29:15.640
 drop by almost threefold, which is incredible.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.340
 And their estradiol levels double,

29:18.340 --> 29:20.200
 so their estrogen levels double.

29:20.200 --> 29:23.180
 So expecting fathers, many people have known,

29:23.180 --> 29:24.880
 put on additional body weight.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.940
 Everyone always thought that it's because they're eating

29:26.940 --> 29:29.360
 in parallel with their pregnant wife,

29:29.360 --> 29:32.740
 but it turns out that these effects of reduced testosterone,

29:32.740 --> 29:35.100
 increased estradiol, and reduced cortisol

29:35.100 --> 29:38.880
 can all be explained by an increase in prolactin.

29:38.880 --> 29:43.020
 So not just in humans, but in other species as well.

29:43.020 --> 29:45.740
 When the male and female of that species

29:45.740 --> 29:49.380
 are expecting young, they lay down more body fat.

29:49.380 --> 29:51.120
 The assumption is that this is to prepare

29:51.120 --> 29:53.200
 for long nights of no sleep,

29:53.200 --> 29:56.460
 which occurs in many species, not just in humans.

29:56.460 --> 29:59.820
 So it's really interesting that this hormone prolactin

29:59.820 --> 30:03.640
 can start suppressing whole categories of hormones,

30:03.640 --> 30:04.780
 sex steroid hormones,

30:04.780 --> 30:08.040
 and can start increasing whole categories of other ones.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.580
 So we hear about the dad bod.

30:09.580 --> 30:12.180
 There are a lot of explanations for the dad bod

30:12.180 --> 30:14.580
 that extend well beyond this podcast episode,

30:14.580 --> 30:17.180
 but it is a well-known phenomenon

30:17.180 --> 30:18.820
 that testosterone is going to drop,

30:18.820 --> 30:20.380
 prolactin's going to increase,

30:20.380 --> 30:23.900
 estradiol's going to increase in males and females

30:23.900 --> 30:25.940
 that are expecting children.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.460
 Now, how long that lasts is very interesting.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.820
 It actually has to do with how much contact

30:31.820 --> 30:35.100
 and how much contact with the smells of the baby,

30:35.100 --> 30:37.380
 of the offspring the father happens to have.

30:37.380 --> 30:39.860
 So how available or unavailable he is

30:39.860 --> 30:41.900
 will actually impact his level of hormones.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.680
 Now, I am definitely not promoting the idea

30:43.680 --> 30:47.020
 that fathers or mothers take time away from their offspring

30:47.020 --> 30:48.900
 in order to keep their testosterone levels high

30:48.900 --> 30:50.180
 or to restore them.

30:50.180 --> 30:51.660
 That's not what I'm saying at all.

30:51.660 --> 30:53.020
 It's just interesting to point out

30:53.020 --> 30:55.700
 that these evolutionary mechanisms push us toward

30:55.700 --> 30:59.360
 or bias us toward particular categories of behaviors

30:59.360 --> 31:00.940
 by influencing our hormones,

31:00.940 --> 31:02.780
 which then feed back and promote more

31:02.780 --> 31:04.160
 of that particular behavior.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.900
 Because as I mentioned before,

31:05.900 --> 31:08.680
 peaks in testosterone in males and females

31:08.680 --> 31:12.300
 cause individuals to seek sex, not promote parenting.

31:12.300 --> 31:16.140
 Whereas reductions in testosterone, increases in prolactin,

31:16.140 --> 31:20.300
 and decreases in cortisol move individuals of both sexes

31:20.300 --> 31:21.780
 toward parenting behavior

31:21.780 --> 31:23.780
 and less toward reproductive behavior.

31:23.780 --> 31:27.440
 The other behavior that markedly reduces testosterone

31:27.440 --> 31:29.100
 in both males and females

31:29.100 --> 31:32.260
 and markedly reduces the desire for seeking sex

31:32.260 --> 31:35.240
 and sex itself is illness.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.520
 And many of you might say, well, duh,

31:37.520 --> 31:38.600
 when people don't feel sick,

31:38.600 --> 31:40.140
 they don't feel like seeking out mates

31:40.140 --> 31:41.620
 and they don't feel like having sex.

31:41.620 --> 31:44.140
 But have you ever wondered why that actually is?

31:44.140 --> 31:47.260
 Well, it turns out that it can be explained by the release

31:47.260 --> 31:49.760
 of what are called inflammatory cytokines.

31:49.760 --> 31:52.300
 So cytokines are related to the immune system.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.260
 They travel in the lymph and in the blood

31:54.260 --> 31:57.960
 and they attack invader cells like bacteria and viruses.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.940
 And under conditions of illness,

31:59.940 --> 32:01.700
 we make a lot of different cytokines.

32:01.700 --> 32:03.660
 Some of them are anti-inflammatory,

32:03.660 --> 32:05.780
 but some of them are pro-inflammatory.

32:05.780 --> 32:08.900
 And the best known example of a pro-inflammatory cytokine

32:08.900 --> 32:10.940
 is IL-6.

32:10.940 --> 32:15.220
 And it's known that IL-6 when injected into individuals

32:15.220 --> 32:17.700
 will decrease the desire for sex

32:17.700 --> 32:20.380
 and eventually will reduce levels of testosterone

32:20.380 --> 32:23.620
 and estrogen independent of feeling lousy.

32:23.620 --> 32:27.740
 So the reason why people don't want sex when they're sick

32:27.740 --> 32:30.040
 is because levels of IL-6 are increased.

32:30.040 --> 32:32.620
 Now, this is important because as we start to think about

32:32.620 --> 32:35.500
 the different ways to modulate the sex steroid hormones,

32:35.500 --> 32:37.240
 so-called optimize the hormones,

32:38.380 --> 32:42.020
 keeping levels of IL-6 low is going to be important

32:42.020 --> 32:44.100
 for them to exert their effects.

32:44.100 --> 32:46.460
 Now, IL-6 doesn't just travel to the gonads

32:46.460 --> 32:47.500
 and shut down the gonads.

32:47.500 --> 32:50.000
 It actually has ways to interact

32:50.000 --> 32:52.360
 with some of the receptors that the steroid hormones,

32:52.360 --> 32:54.460
 estrogen and testosterone bind to,

32:54.460 --> 32:55.860
 and impact those receptors

32:55.860 --> 32:58.600
 so that the sex steroid hormones can't have their effect.

32:58.600 --> 33:00.660
 In short, and put simply,

33:00.660 --> 33:02.900
 inflammatory cytokines like IL-6

33:02.900 --> 33:04.740
 are bad for sex steroid hormones.

33:04.740 --> 33:07.200
 And so we're going to talk about how to modulate IL-6

33:07.200 --> 33:08.980
 in the direction that you would want

33:08.980 --> 33:13.300
 and how to increase another cytokine called IL-10,

33:13.300 --> 33:16.620
 which is anti-inflammatory in ways that can help promote

33:16.620 --> 33:19.180
 or at least support the sex steroid hormones.

33:19.180 --> 33:20.380
 So as we move forward,

33:20.380 --> 33:22.180
 we're going to now start to consider

33:22.180 --> 33:24.420
 what sorts of behavioral practices,

33:24.420 --> 33:26.060
 as well as other things,

33:26.060 --> 33:28.140
 can modulate the sex steroid hormones

33:28.140 --> 33:30.340
 in the directions that you want them to go.

33:31.220 --> 33:32.740
 But before we do that,

33:32.740 --> 33:35.460
 and in order to set the stage for that,

33:35.460 --> 33:37.180
 you should be asking yourself,

33:37.180 --> 33:41.100
 how is it or why is it at a mechanistic level

33:41.100 --> 33:44.040
 that behaviors can modulate hormones at all?

33:44.040 --> 33:44.980
 If you think about it,

33:44.980 --> 33:47.240
 it's kind of strange that just the mere act

33:47.240 --> 33:49.500
 of being a parent or parenting

33:49.500 --> 33:52.000
 can change testosterone levels so dramatically

33:52.000 --> 33:54.580
 or estradiol levels so dramatically.

33:54.580 --> 33:55.420
 What is it?

33:55.420 --> 33:56.840
 Is it the sweat of the baby?

33:56.840 --> 33:58.340
 Is it their saliva?

33:58.340 --> 33:59.720
 Is it the sight of the baby?

33:59.720 --> 34:01.000
 Is it holding the baby?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.700
 Or is it all those things?

34:02.700 --> 34:05.060
 It turns out that many of those effects

34:05.060 --> 34:06.780
 are because of smell,

34:06.780 --> 34:11.020
 or in some cases, even possibly pheromones.

34:11.020 --> 34:12.220
 Now I talked about hormones.

34:12.220 --> 34:13.700
 Hormones, again, are a chemical,

34:13.700 --> 34:14.540
 travels in the body,

34:14.540 --> 34:17.040
 impacts tissues and cells elsewhere in the body.

34:17.040 --> 34:19.180
 A pheromone is a chemical that's released

34:19.180 --> 34:20.700
 by one member of a species

34:20.700 --> 34:24.060
 that goes and impacts members elsewhere,

34:24.060 --> 34:26.940
 but of the same species or even of other species.

34:26.940 --> 34:30.780
 Now pheromone effects are absolutely well-established

34:30.780 --> 34:32.340
 in lots of animal species,

34:32.340 --> 34:34.760
 but they are very controversial in humans.

34:34.760 --> 34:36.140
 Today, I'm going to talk about

34:36.140 --> 34:38.400
 some of the well-established ones in animals.

34:38.400 --> 34:40.380
 I've mentioned one or two of these before

34:40.380 --> 34:41.780
 on previous podcasts,

34:41.780 --> 34:44.420
 but I haven't mentioned several of them.

34:44.420 --> 34:47.420
 And I'm going to talk about the evidence

34:47.420 --> 34:51.740
 for pheromones in humans that are well-established.

34:51.740 --> 34:54.720
 So the main ones in animals that are discussed

34:54.720 --> 34:56.060
 are called the Leibniz effect,

34:56.060 --> 34:57.500
 the Witten effect, the Bruce effect,

34:57.500 --> 34:58.460
 and the Vandenberg effect,

34:58.460 --> 35:01.500
 named after the people that discovered them.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.100
 The Leibniz effect is when you house females

35:04.100 --> 35:07.360
 of a given species together with no males,

35:07.360 --> 35:08.900
 they start displaying longer,

35:08.900 --> 35:10.340
 what are called estrous cycles.

35:10.340 --> 35:12.700
 In many species, they don't have menstrual cycles,

35:12.700 --> 35:13.820
 which are 28 days.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.140
 They have estrous cycles,

35:15.140 --> 35:18.100
 which tend to be four days or some variant thereof.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.460
 It's an interesting phenomenon

35:21.460 --> 35:23.500
 because what it means is that the presence of the male

35:23.500 --> 35:28.120
 itself is changing the ovulation cycle.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.980
 Now, many people out there,

35:29.980 --> 35:33.220
 imagine mostly the people that are ovulating out there,

35:33.220 --> 35:35.500
 will say, of course, I notice I ovulate differently

35:35.500 --> 35:36.940
 or my cycle changes

35:36.940 --> 35:39.380
 when I'm in the presence of my partner or I'm not.

35:39.380 --> 35:40.560
 But the pheromone effect

35:40.560 --> 35:43.820
 that mirrors this Leibniz effect in humans

35:43.820 --> 35:45.420
 has still not really been identified.

35:45.420 --> 35:47.320
 Nobody knows what the exact chemical is,

35:47.320 --> 35:50.220
 but nonetheless, this is a strong effect in some animals.

35:50.220 --> 35:52.320
 The other one is the Bruce effect,

35:52.320 --> 35:53.780
 and this is a very dramatic effect

35:53.780 --> 35:58.780
 whereby a pregnant animal will abort or reabsorb her fetus

35:59.120 --> 36:01.340
 if the dad of those animals,

36:01.340 --> 36:03.780
 the father that sired the litter,

36:03.780 --> 36:06.380
 because these are animals, they're litters,

36:06.380 --> 36:11.380
 is removed and a novel male is placed in her vicinity

36:11.460 --> 36:12.820
 for about 48 hours.

36:12.820 --> 36:15.500
 And what's interesting is the way that this happens

36:15.500 --> 36:18.780
 is a pheromone that comes from male urine

36:19.880 --> 36:23.820
 activates the gonadotropin-releasing hormone system

36:23.820 --> 36:28.500
 and causes a reintroduction of the estrous cycle

36:28.500 --> 36:30.900
 and a spontaneous abortion of the fetus.

36:30.900 --> 36:33.220
 Now, a lot of people have taken the Bruce effect

36:33.220 --> 36:34.460
 kind of to its extreme

36:34.460 --> 36:37.240
 and asked whether or not in humans miscarriages are caused

36:37.240 --> 36:40.400
 by detecting the pheromones or odors of novel males,

36:40.400 --> 36:41.980
 meaning the non-dad male,

36:41.980 --> 36:43.600
 and that's still an open question.

36:43.600 --> 36:45.320
 Nobody knows if that's true or not,

36:45.320 --> 36:47.500
 so I want to emphasize that.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.100
 The other one is the Vandenberg effect,

36:49.100 --> 36:50.120
 and this is one I alluded to

36:50.120 --> 36:51.740
 in a previous episode of the podcast,

36:51.740 --> 36:55.420
 which is that puberty in females can be accelerated

36:55.420 --> 36:58.260
 by placing a novel sexually competent male

36:58.260 --> 37:01.420
 in with a young female who has not undergone puberty.

37:01.420 --> 37:04.620
 There's also a version of this, which I haven't described,

37:04.620 --> 37:06.480
 which is delay of puberty,

37:06.480 --> 37:09.220
 where you take juvenile female animals

37:09.220 --> 37:11.060
 that have not undergone puberty

37:11.060 --> 37:13.780
 and you put them with more mature females

37:13.780 --> 37:15.780
 of the same species,

37:15.780 --> 37:20.660
 and that introduction of more females will cause a delay,

37:20.660 --> 37:23.220
 a significant delay in the onset of puberty.

37:23.220 --> 37:24.860
 So these are all pheromone effects,

37:24.860 --> 37:26.340
 and we know they're pheromone effects

37:26.340 --> 37:28.460
 because they're not conscious.

37:28.460 --> 37:31.060
 They also don't require actual contact

37:31.060 --> 37:33.700
 with the other members of a given species.

37:33.700 --> 37:35.420
 These are all effects that can be mediated

37:35.420 --> 37:38.220
 by the urine from a given species

37:38.220 --> 37:40.100
 or by the sweat of a given species,

37:40.100 --> 37:41.660
 and speaking of sweat,

37:41.660 --> 37:45.860
 the one pheromone effect that I'm very aware of

37:45.860 --> 37:47.580
 from the published literature

37:47.580 --> 37:50.940
 is a paper that was published in 1998

37:50.940 --> 37:52.740
 by Stern and McClintock,

37:52.740 --> 37:53.900
 which was getting at this question

37:53.900 --> 37:55.660
 of synchronization of menstrual cycles.

37:55.660 --> 37:59.340
 Now, the whole idea of synchronization of menstrual cycles

37:59.340 --> 38:01.320
 is pretty controversial.

38:01.320 --> 38:02.480
 For a long time, people said,

38:02.480 --> 38:06.020
 oh, this is absolutely a well-characterized phenomenon,

38:06.020 --> 38:07.420
 people living in dormitories,

38:07.420 --> 38:09.980
 their menstrual cycles would synchronize,

38:09.980 --> 38:11.620
 people living in environments together

38:11.620 --> 38:14.420
 with their menstrual cycles would synchronize,

38:14.420 --> 38:16.020
 and then some studies came out

38:16.020 --> 38:18.520
 that kind of undercut those data

38:18.520 --> 38:20.320
 and said, no, this actually doesn't happen,

38:20.320 --> 38:21.780
 and it was kind of controversial,

38:21.780 --> 38:24.380
 but there is a very clear effect

38:24.380 --> 38:26.740
 that was described by Stern and McClintock.

38:26.740 --> 38:28.300
 What they did actually

38:28.300 --> 38:32.500
 was they took females, they charted their cycles,

38:32.500 --> 38:37.500
 and then they had other females wear pads in their armpits,

38:37.660 --> 38:40.820
 and they collected sweat from those females,

38:40.820 --> 38:43.620
 and then they took the sweat from those pads

38:43.620 --> 38:45.180
 in those females' armpits,

38:45.180 --> 38:46.500
 and they introduced them to women

38:46.500 --> 38:50.600
 who had never had contact with the people who had sweated.

38:50.600 --> 38:52.180
 They only had contact with their sweat.

38:52.180 --> 38:54.060
 In fact, they swabbed it underneath their nose,

38:54.060 --> 38:55.780
 but if that sounds gross,

38:55.780 --> 38:57.620
 they dilute it in alcohol,

38:57.620 --> 38:59.620
 so much so that they can't actually detect

38:59.620 --> 39:01.140
 the odor of the sweat.

39:01.140 --> 39:03.740
 That's actually very important because it's not the smell,

39:03.740 --> 39:06.540
 it's the pheromone chemical itself,

39:06.540 --> 39:08.620
 and it turns out the pheromone chemical itself

39:08.620 --> 39:12.400
 can modulate the menstrual cycle,

39:12.400 --> 39:14.780
 although it doesn't necessarily synchronize it

39:14.780 --> 39:16.260
 with the sweater.

39:16.260 --> 39:20.620
 What it does is it changes the duration

39:20.620 --> 39:22.340
 and the pattern of ovulation

39:22.340 --> 39:24.740
 relative to so-called follicular phase.

39:24.740 --> 39:29.580
 Long and short of this is that the sweat and pheromones

39:29.580 --> 39:34.060
 of females can modulate the menstrual cycle patterns

39:34.060 --> 39:35.800
 of other adult females.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.140
 It's just a question of whether or not they synchronize,

39:38.140 --> 39:39.980
 and if you're kind of rolling your eyes now and saying,

39:39.980 --> 39:42.260
 well, of course they do, and this is really detailed,

39:42.260 --> 39:44.100
 this is how the science is done,

39:44.100 --> 39:47.680
 and the reason why people are so skeptical

39:47.680 --> 39:50.620
 about the presence of pheromone effects in humans

39:50.620 --> 39:54.780
 is that there's no well-identified pheromone organ.

39:54.780 --> 39:57.200
 We have an area of our nose that's responsible for smelling,

39:57.200 --> 40:00.700
 that's well-established, it's been observed in MRIs

40:00.700 --> 40:02.880
 many, many times in cadavers, many, many times

40:02.880 --> 40:04.700
 in pretty much all individuals,

40:04.700 --> 40:06.980
 but the vomeronasal organ,

40:06.980 --> 40:08.700
 which is the pheromone detecting organ,

40:08.700 --> 40:10.600
 hasn't really been found in humans.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.220
 There's something called Jacobson's organ,

40:12.220 --> 40:14.620
 which is thought to be the organ in the nose.

40:14.620 --> 40:17.180
 It's actually on the top of the roof of the mouth,

40:17.180 --> 40:18.620
 and in the kind of back of the nose,

40:18.620 --> 40:21.620
 there's a few wine tasters, I never can pronounce this,

40:21.620 --> 40:22.460
 what are they called?

40:22.460 --> 40:25.580
 Sommelier, whatever, it's the people that are excellent

40:25.580 --> 40:29.460
 at drinking and detecting the essences of wine

40:29.460 --> 40:30.780
 that you have to go through all these tests

40:30.780 --> 40:32.800
 in order to get certified as one of them.

40:32.800 --> 40:33.700
 Somebody tell me.

40:35.020 --> 40:38.140
 They are using probably a similar mechanism

40:38.140 --> 40:41.600
 of mixing taste and smell, and Jacobson's organ,

40:41.600 --> 40:45.940
 if it exists, the vomeronasal equivalent in humans

40:45.940 --> 40:49.280
 is thought to be a combination of smell and taste.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.720
 Now, it gets even weirder and cooler

40:52.720 --> 40:55.400
 when you think about a given study that was done in humans,

40:55.400 --> 41:00.400
 where if you take hundreds of t-shirts from boyfriends,

41:00.600 --> 41:03.160
 keep them separate, you take those t-shirts,

41:03.160 --> 41:05.940
 you wash them many times separately,

41:05.940 --> 41:08.660
 and then you offer them to the girlfriends,

41:08.660 --> 41:11.980
 the longtime partners of those guys,

41:11.980 --> 41:15.820
 and what you'll find is that the girlfriend

41:15.820 --> 41:18.580
 can pick out her boyfriend's t-shirt

41:18.580 --> 41:21.220
 among hundreds of other t-shirts,

41:21.220 --> 41:22.720
 not because it smells different,

41:22.720 --> 41:25.340
 but because something about it seems different.

41:25.340 --> 41:27.460
 It might smell different to her

41:27.460 --> 41:30.500
 in some way that's kind of imperceptible even to her,

41:30.500 --> 41:34.420
 and the level of accuracy in detecting that t-shirt,

41:34.420 --> 41:35.520
 her partner's t-shirt,

41:35.520 --> 41:39.120
 is way above statistical significant thresholds,

41:39.120 --> 41:41.020
 so much so that you almost have to say

41:41.020 --> 41:42.740
 there's something about these effects

41:42.740 --> 41:44.740
 that are real pheromone effects,

41:44.740 --> 41:45.980
 although people still argue

41:45.980 --> 41:47.560
 that there are no pheromone effects in humans,

41:47.560 --> 41:49.100
 that it's all through olfaction.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.060
 I think these are interesting and important to understand

41:51.060 --> 41:52.260
 because it means that a lot of things

41:52.260 --> 41:53.500
 coming through our nose,

41:53.500 --> 41:55.780
 whether or not it's pheromones or smells,

41:55.780 --> 41:59.500
 are impacting hormones and our ability to attach memories

41:59.500 --> 42:02.260
 and kind of recognition of mates and other people,

42:02.260 --> 42:04.380
 including our children, not just our mates.

42:04.380 --> 42:06.420
 And of course, perfume manufacturers

42:06.420 --> 42:08.700
 have really picked up on the idea of pheromones

42:08.700 --> 42:10.900
 and have entire laboratories set up

42:10.900 --> 42:13.620
 to build chemical compounds into perfumes

42:13.620 --> 42:15.360
 that are designed to attract other mates.

42:15.360 --> 42:18.820
 This is a well-established and well-documented phenomenon.

42:18.820 --> 42:21.180
 And the last point I'll make about pheromones

42:21.180 --> 42:24.220
 is that this combination of taste and smell

42:24.220 --> 42:27.260
 is such a real thing in the animal world

42:27.260 --> 42:30.040
 that there's something called the flemming response.

42:30.040 --> 42:33.460
 During the mating season for different animals,

42:33.460 --> 42:35.060
 you can actually even see this in horses,

42:35.060 --> 42:36.980
 but for animals that are seasonal maters,

42:36.980 --> 42:38.740
 they'll do something called the flemming response

42:38.740 --> 42:41.660
 where they actually open their lips and their mouth

42:41.660 --> 42:43.820
 and they expose their gums

42:43.820 --> 42:46.700
 so that they can capture pheromones

42:46.700 --> 42:48.420
 that are floating in the wind and the environment.

42:48.420 --> 42:51.140
 They actually are looking for mates using their mouth

42:51.140 --> 42:52.220
 and kind of sniffing around.

42:52.220 --> 42:53.620
 If you own a dog and you watch the way

42:53.620 --> 42:55.120
 that the dog will sniff around,

42:55.120 --> 42:58.020
 selecting where they want to urinate, males and females,

42:58.020 --> 43:01.980
 there's often, they're bringing molecules into their nose.

43:01.980 --> 43:03.660
 I know it sounds kind of gross sniffing urine,

43:03.660 --> 43:06.120
 but there are a lot of pheromones in urine of animals.

43:06.120 --> 43:08.700
 A lot of pheromones are traveling in the wind.

43:08.700 --> 43:10.660
 Again, whether or not this is happening in humans,

43:10.660 --> 43:12.940
 I don't know, but then you think about the perfume thing

43:12.940 --> 43:15.700
 and here people are putting these scents on themselves

43:15.700 --> 43:19.300
 that contain putative pheromones, human pheromones,

43:19.300 --> 43:21.020
 and walking around hoping that their scents

43:21.020 --> 43:24.140
 are going to evoke mate-seeking behavior

43:24.140 --> 43:26.900
 from other individuals of the same human species.

43:26.900 --> 43:30.060
 So we are among the animals in this behavior

43:30.060 --> 43:31.100
 independent of whether or not

43:31.100 --> 43:32.860
 you believe pheromone effects exist.

43:32.860 --> 43:34.460
 So let's get back to behaviors

43:34.460 --> 43:36.680
 that can help optimize hormone levels.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.640
 One of the main behaviors

43:39.640 --> 43:41.840
 that's been shown to be associated

43:41.840 --> 43:45.680
 with poor levels of estrogen

43:45.680 --> 43:49.000
 relative to age match controls for people with ovaries

43:49.000 --> 43:51.720
 or lower levels of testosterone

43:51.720 --> 43:55.080
 compared to age match controls for people with testes

43:55.960 --> 43:58.040
 is apnea.

43:59.040 --> 44:02.980
 Apnea has everything to do with underbreathing

44:02.980 --> 44:06.280
 and the buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body.

44:06.280 --> 44:08.880
 There are other effects of apnea as well,

44:08.880 --> 44:11.440
 but if there's a consistent literature

44:11.440 --> 44:15.960
 in this whole story about aging and reductions in hormones

44:15.960 --> 44:20.520
 and general health and reductions in hormones, it's apnea.

44:20.520 --> 44:23.840
 I went deep into the literature on advanced menopause

44:23.840 --> 44:27.440
 or when menopausal symptoms are exacerbated.

44:27.440 --> 44:29.840
 And I went into the literature on andropause

44:29.840 --> 44:31.720
 or early onset andropause,

44:31.720 --> 44:34.260
 so levels of testosterone that are far lower

44:34.260 --> 44:36.820
 than they should be for a given age.

44:36.820 --> 44:41.040
 And in every case, you could find multiple papers

44:41.040 --> 44:45.800
 that showed that apnea or poor efficiency of breathing

44:45.800 --> 44:48.880
 and buildup of too much carbon dioxide in the body

44:48.880 --> 44:51.880
 was a problem, mostly sleep apnea,

44:51.880 --> 44:54.840
 although apnea in general was shown to be an issue

44:54.840 --> 44:56.800
 negatively impacting hormones.

44:56.800 --> 45:00.580
 Now, the directionality of this effect isn't entirely clear.

45:00.580 --> 45:04.400
 It could be that reductions in estrogen cause apnea.

45:04.400 --> 45:05.760
 And actually there's some reason

45:05.760 --> 45:07.040
 to believe that might be the case.

45:07.040 --> 45:09.440
 I found at least one paper showing

45:09.440 --> 45:13.180
 that there are estrogen receptors on some of the neurons

45:13.180 --> 45:15.740
 that actually innervate the lungs

45:15.740 --> 45:17.320
 and allow for the perception

45:17.320 --> 45:19.440
 of how full or empty the lungs are.

45:19.440 --> 45:23.320
 In other words, reductions in estrogen may adjust breathing

45:23.320 --> 45:26.840
 by changing our sensitivity to our own lungs.

45:26.840 --> 45:29.400
 Now, that was true for males and females.

45:29.400 --> 45:31.900
 Remember, estrogen in both males and females.

45:31.900 --> 45:36.520
 But as well, I found papers in which testosterone reductions

45:36.520 --> 45:38.120
 were associated with apnea

45:38.120 --> 45:41.200
 and testosterone receptors are also found

45:41.200 --> 45:44.860
 on a lot of cells in the so-called viscera,

45:44.860 --> 45:46.300
 including the lungs.

45:46.300 --> 45:49.160
 So again, the directionality of the effect isn't clear.

45:49.160 --> 45:51.140
 But what's really interesting is that

45:51.140 --> 45:54.280
 there are very clear ways in which patterns of breathing,

45:54.280 --> 45:56.580
 especially patterns of breathing in sleep,

45:56.580 --> 46:00.680
 can modulate hormones in ways that are immediately actionable

46:00.680 --> 46:03.800
 and can serve to optimize both estrogen and testosterone,

46:03.800 --> 46:06.580
 regardless of whether or not you have ovaries or testes.

46:06.580 --> 46:08.060
 So what is apnea?

46:08.060 --> 46:09.780
 Apnea is underbreathing

46:09.780 --> 46:13.320
 or mainly cessation of breathing during sleep.

46:13.320 --> 46:14.560
 So people are holding their breath

46:14.560 --> 46:16.520
 and then they'll suddenly wake up.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.680
 Actually, I've talked about the physiological sigh

46:18.680 --> 46:20.880
 on previous episodes of this podcast

46:20.880 --> 46:24.180
 of this pattern of double inhales followed by exhales

46:24.180 --> 46:25.320
 that one can do consciously

46:25.320 --> 46:28.800
 to reduce stress and anxiety and offload carbon dioxide.

46:28.800 --> 46:29.920
 That pattern of breathing

46:29.920 --> 46:32.340
 is actually what kicks in spontaneously

46:32.340 --> 46:35.160
 anytime we have an apnea episode in sleep,

46:35.160 --> 46:36.860
 although in many people who have apnea,

46:36.860 --> 46:39.600
 they don't engage the physiological sigh.

46:39.600 --> 46:42.820
 People who are dramatically overweight

46:42.820 --> 46:45.520
 also suffer a lot from apnea during sleep.

46:45.520 --> 46:46.760
 There's actually a lot of buildup

46:46.760 --> 46:48.440
 of carbon dioxide in the body,

46:48.440 --> 46:51.540
 and that can lead to excessive sleepiness during the day,

46:51.540 --> 46:54.200
 inability to access the deeper phases of sleep,

46:54.200 --> 46:59.080
 and it's well-established that going into deep sleep

46:59.080 --> 47:01.140
 and getting the proper patterns of slow wave sleep

47:01.140 --> 47:04.160
 and REM sleep are important for hormone optimization.

47:04.160 --> 47:07.720
 I talked about how to modulate sleep and optimize sleep

47:07.720 --> 47:09.840
 in the first month of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

47:09.840 --> 47:12.400
 so please check out those episodes if you have sleep issues

47:12.400 --> 47:13.880
 or you want to work on your sleep.

47:13.880 --> 47:15.660
 Also check out Matt Walker's terrific book,

47:15.660 --> 47:17.040
 "'While We Sleep,"

47:17.040 --> 47:20.140
 and that will help you find various protocols

47:20.140 --> 47:22.200
 to help you optimize your sleep.

47:22.200 --> 47:25.320
 But the issue of breathing itself

47:25.320 --> 47:28.320
 can be adjusted in the daytime waking hours

47:28.320 --> 47:31.140
 in ways that can powerfully impact both sleep,

47:31.140 --> 47:33.360
 reduce incidents of sleep apnea,

47:33.360 --> 47:36.600
 and apparently from some emerging literature

47:36.600 --> 47:39.520
 can also help to optimize various hormones

47:39.520 --> 47:42.480
 even just by breathing in particular ways while awake.

47:42.480 --> 47:43.780
 So here's how this works.

47:44.640 --> 47:46.680
 There's now a lot of literature showing

47:46.680 --> 47:48.920
 that breathing through the nose, not through the mouth,

47:48.920 --> 47:51.960
 is powerful for improving lots of things.

47:51.960 --> 47:54.560
 First of all, it improves cosmetic features

47:54.560 --> 47:55.480
 of the jaw and face.

47:55.480 --> 47:59.080
 This was first well-established by my colleagues at Stanford

47:59.080 --> 48:02.440
 in a book called, Jaws, the story of a hidden epidemic.

48:02.440 --> 48:04.680
 This is by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich,

48:04.680 --> 48:06.680
 who are both faculty at Stanford,

48:06.680 --> 48:08.640
 has a foreword by Robert Sapolsky,

48:08.640 --> 48:10.180
 the great Robert Sapolsky,

48:10.180 --> 48:13.680
 and it also has a heavy endorsement up front

48:13.680 --> 48:15.320
 by Jared Diamond, the author of,

48:15.320 --> 48:17.480
 "'Guns, Germs, and Steel,' the Pulitzer winner."

48:17.480 --> 48:19.460
 So a lot of heavy hitters on this book, Jaws.

48:19.460 --> 48:22.220
 It's not a book that a lot of people know about, unfortunately

48:22.220 --> 48:26.000
 but it really describes the benefits of nasal breathing

48:26.000 --> 48:28.880
 and the terrible things that happen

48:28.880 --> 48:30.440
 when people, in particular children,

48:30.440 --> 48:33.240
 but adults also, are heavy mouth breathers.

48:33.240 --> 48:35.040
 So mouth breathers have changes

48:35.040 --> 48:36.960
 in the cosmetics of their face and jaw

48:36.960 --> 48:40.560
 that are really bad in terms of attractiveness,

48:40.560 --> 48:41.920
 and this was done in twin studies.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.240
 You can look in the book and see some of this.

48:43.240 --> 48:46.200
 It's really dramatic how being a mouth breather

48:46.200 --> 48:49.540
 tends to make the chin drop back behind the upper mandible.

48:49.540 --> 48:51.840
 There's a lengthening in the face, a drooping of the eyes.

48:51.840 --> 48:53.460
 It can be quite dramatic or modest

48:53.460 --> 48:55.400
 depending on how much mouth breathing.

48:55.400 --> 48:57.200
 Now, sometimes we have to breathe with our mouths

48:57.200 --> 48:59.440
 but there's also a lot of data and studies

48:59.440 --> 49:01.280
 described in this book, Jaws,

49:01.280 --> 49:05.000
 that describe how nose breathing in wakefulness

49:05.000 --> 49:08.780
 and in sleep promotes all sorts of positive things

49:08.780 --> 49:11.500
 related to not just cosmetics

49:11.500 --> 49:14.560
 but also the improvement of gas exchange

49:14.560 --> 49:17.120
 with carbon dioxide and oxygen in the body.

49:17.120 --> 49:20.280
 And as well, it can modify levels

49:20.280 --> 49:22.600
 of different neurotransmitters and neuromodulators

49:22.600 --> 49:25.640
 in ways that positively can impact hormones.

49:25.640 --> 49:28.760
 So believe it or not, being a nasal breather

49:28.760 --> 49:30.520
 and avoiding being a mouth breather

49:30.520 --> 49:33.400
 can actually positively impact hormones,

49:33.400 --> 49:36.480
 and in particular, the hormones testosterone and estrogen,

49:36.480 --> 49:38.700
 although the way that it does that

49:38.700 --> 49:41.260
 is by making you a better sleeper,

49:41.260 --> 49:43.920
 which allows you to produce more testosterone

49:43.920 --> 49:47.300
 and the appropriate amounts of testosterone and estrogen.

49:48.160 --> 49:52.200
 But it does that in part through indirect mechanisms

49:52.200 --> 49:54.160
 because deep sleep supports the gonads,

49:54.160 --> 49:55.880
 the ovaries and the testicles,

49:55.880 --> 49:58.600
 and the turnover of cells and the production of cells.

49:58.600 --> 50:01.360
 Remember, in the ovary, particular cells

50:01.360 --> 50:03.760
 and the egg follicles themselves make estrogen,

50:03.760 --> 50:08.760
 and in the testicle that the sertoli cells

50:09.380 --> 50:10.800
 and the lytic cells are important

50:10.800 --> 50:14.360
 for the formation of sperm and for testosterone respectively.

50:14.360 --> 50:16.600
 So what does this all mean?

50:16.600 --> 50:19.060
 This means we have to be breathing properly.

50:19.060 --> 50:22.300
 It almost sounds kind of like kind of new agey,

50:22.300 --> 50:23.560
 like, oh, you have to breathe properly,

50:23.560 --> 50:24.480
 get your hormones right.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.520
 But no, you have to breathe properly

50:26.520 --> 50:28.120
 to get your breathing and sleep right

50:28.120 --> 50:30.120
 so that your sleep can actually be deep enough

50:30.120 --> 50:32.320
 and you're not entering apnea states,

50:32.320 --> 50:35.240
 and then that will support gonad function.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.800
 And I wouldn't be putting this out

50:36.800 --> 50:39.440
 as one of the main behavioral tools upfront

50:39.440 --> 50:42.120
 if it weren't for the fact that the effects of apnea

50:42.120 --> 50:44.800
 on these hormones are dramatic and terrible,

50:44.800 --> 50:47.160
 and the positive effects of getting breathing right

50:47.160 --> 50:49.080
 on these hormones, testosterone and estrogen,

50:49.080 --> 50:50.880
 are dramatic and wonderful.

50:50.880 --> 50:52.860
 So let's talk about a few of those studies briefly

50:52.860 --> 50:56.120
 so I can underscore the value of proper breathing

50:56.120 --> 50:57.980
 in order to optimize hormones.

50:57.980 --> 51:01.180
 So I was able to find at least four quality studies

51:01.180 --> 51:06.000
 showing that when apnea is reduced in sleep or eliminated,

51:06.000 --> 51:08.400
 there are significant increases

51:08.400 --> 51:11.440
 in testosterone in males and in proper estrogen

51:11.440 --> 51:13.900
 to testosterone ratios in females.

51:13.900 --> 51:17.000
 And the way that it works is very interesting.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.220
 Apparently, it works by reductions in cortisol.

51:21.220 --> 51:22.900
 Now, cortisol is a stress hormone

51:22.900 --> 51:25.000
 that is released early in the day as we wake up

51:25.000 --> 51:27.920
 and serves healthy roles in protecting us against infection,

51:27.920 --> 51:29.880
 reducing inflammation, et cetera.

51:29.880 --> 51:31.800
 But you don't want cortisol to be too high,

51:31.800 --> 51:34.080
 and you certainly don't want to elevate it too long

51:34.080 --> 51:36.100
 throughout the day and night.

51:36.100 --> 51:39.480
 And so we all know, because now we've been told a lot

51:39.480 --> 51:42.540
 in the last decade or so, that getting proper sleep

51:42.540 --> 51:44.240
 is important for all these aspects of health.

51:44.240 --> 51:47.480
 Getting proper sleep can really offset all the reductions

51:47.480 --> 51:50.320
 in testosterone and estrogen and reductions in fertility

51:50.320 --> 51:52.020
 that occur if we don't get enough sleep.

51:52.020 --> 51:55.840
 But seldom is it discussed how sleep actually adjusts

51:55.840 --> 51:57.720
 things like testosterone and estrogen,

51:57.720 --> 52:00.980
 and it does it by modifying cortisol.

52:00.980 --> 52:04.920
 So the molecule cholesterol can be converted

52:04.920 --> 52:06.920
 into testosterone or estrogen,

52:06.920 --> 52:10.600
 but there's a competition whereby the cholesterol

52:10.600 --> 52:13.920
 will turn into cortisol and not testosterone,

52:13.920 --> 52:17.680
 or it'll turn into cortisol and not estrogen

52:17.680 --> 52:19.660
 if stress levels are too high.

52:19.660 --> 52:21.200
 So the simple version of this

52:21.200 --> 52:24.640
 is getting your breathing right during the waking hours,

52:24.640 --> 52:27.840
 meaning primarily, unless you're working out really hard

52:27.840 --> 52:30.080
 or there's some other reason why you're maybe eating

52:30.080 --> 52:31.620
 or speaking that you need to be breathing

52:31.620 --> 52:33.600
 through your mouth, you should be a nose breather.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.080
 There's really good evidence for that now.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.960
 And in sleep, you also want to be a nose breather

52:38.960 --> 52:41.620
 because that's going to increase the amount of oxygen

52:41.620 --> 52:42.460
 that you're bringing into your system

52:42.460 --> 52:45.440
 and the amount of carbon dioxide that you're offloading.

52:45.440 --> 52:47.280
 There are other positive effects of it as well,

52:47.280 --> 52:49.400
 but you're basically reducing apnea.

52:49.400 --> 52:52.080
 Breath holding in sleep leads to buildup of carbon dioxide

52:52.080 --> 52:54.020
 and leads to increases in cortisol,

52:54.020 --> 52:58.000
 which then decrease testosterone and decrease estrogen

52:58.000 --> 53:01.340
 in negative ways across all sexes, okay?

53:01.340 --> 53:04.000
 So the simple version of this is get your breathing right.

53:04.000 --> 53:04.840
 So how do you do that?

53:04.840 --> 53:05.800
 How do you get your breathing right?

53:05.800 --> 53:08.800
 Well, for some people that have severe sleep apnea,

53:08.800 --> 53:10.560
 they're going to need the CPAP machine.

53:10.560 --> 53:12.260
 This is a machine that you actually put on your face

53:12.260 --> 53:14.580
 and it helps you breathe properly in sleep.

53:14.580 --> 53:16.740
 Many people, however, are starting to do this thing

53:16.740 --> 53:17.820
 of taping their mouth shut.

53:17.820 --> 53:20.040
 Now, this sounds a little bit extreme

53:20.040 --> 53:21.560
 and you certainly don't want to do this

53:21.560 --> 53:22.620
 in any way that's dangerous.

53:22.620 --> 53:25.340
 James Nestor talked about this in his book,

53:25.340 --> 53:27.480
 "'Breath, The New Science of a Lost Art,"

53:27.480 --> 53:29.500
 that simply taping shut the mouth

53:29.500 --> 53:32.840
 with some tape that will allow you to open your mouth

53:32.840 --> 53:33.960
 if you really need to.

53:33.960 --> 53:36.040
 During sleep can allow people to shift over

53:36.040 --> 53:40.560
 from being mouth breathers and snorers to nose breathers.

53:40.560 --> 53:44.440
 In the daytime, the best way to get good at nasal breathing

53:44.440 --> 53:46.160
 is to dilate the nasal passages

53:46.160 --> 53:47.500
 because a lot of people have a hard time

53:47.500 --> 53:49.240
 breathing through their nose.

53:49.240 --> 53:50.560
 And one way to do this

53:50.560 --> 53:52.320
 is to just breathe through your nose more.

53:52.320 --> 53:54.640
 And one way to do that is that when you exercise,

53:54.640 --> 53:56.800
 in particular cardiovascular exercise,

53:56.800 --> 53:59.560
 most of the time, provided you're not in maximum effort,

53:59.560 --> 54:01.260
 you should be nasal breathing.

54:01.260 --> 54:02.840
 Now, for a lot of people,

54:02.840 --> 54:05.440
 nasal breathing during exercise is hard at first,

54:05.440 --> 54:06.440
 but as you do it,

54:06.440 --> 54:10.320
 because the sinuses have a capacity to dilate over time,

54:10.320 --> 54:11.880
 you'll get better at it.

54:11.880 --> 54:14.920
 The sinuses, if you haven't ever held a skull,

54:15.920 --> 54:17.640
 because of my job as a neuroscientist,

54:17.640 --> 54:18.640
 I've held a lot of skulls,

54:18.640 --> 54:21.160
 taken a lot of brains out of a lot of skulls,

54:21.160 --> 54:23.760
 teach neuroanatomy and have done that for, goodness,

54:24.600 --> 54:26.420
 God knows how many species I've done that for,

54:26.420 --> 54:27.260
 including human.

54:27.260 --> 54:30.120
 But what the sinuses are is they're actually,

54:30.120 --> 54:32.440
 what you've got are you've got these little portals

54:32.440 --> 54:35.640
 in the bone that run up here and down here

54:35.640 --> 54:37.760
 behind the nose and into the jaw.

54:37.760 --> 54:39.760
 If you ever had a cold and your sinuses are stuffed up,

54:39.760 --> 54:42.280
 you feel like you have congestion here and here

54:42.280 --> 54:44.560
 and around your ears and in your cheeks and in your face.

54:44.560 --> 54:47.780
 And that's because the sinuses are actually portals

54:47.780 --> 54:50.840
 where the bones are fused together,

54:50.840 --> 54:52.760
 kind of interdigitate like this,

54:52.760 --> 54:54.960
 but they're lined, of course, with mucous membranes.

54:54.960 --> 54:57.060
 And as you start to nasal breathe more,

54:57.060 --> 54:59.200
 the nasal passages will start to dilate more.

54:59.200 --> 55:01.240
 Don't worry, you're not going to get giant nostrils.

55:01.240 --> 55:02.680
 But what's going to end up happening

55:02.680 --> 55:04.120
 is you're going to have an easier time breathing

55:04.120 --> 55:06.180
 through your nose just from waking.

55:06.180 --> 55:10.660
 So my advice would be breathe through your nose

55:10.660 --> 55:13.800
 while exercising, unless you're in maximum effort.

55:13.800 --> 55:16.240
 Pretty soon, what you'll find is you actually can

55:16.240 --> 55:18.000
 create more output than you would

55:18.000 --> 55:19.520
 if you were breathing through your mouth.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.040
 And of course, there are exceptions to this.

55:21.040 --> 55:23.460
 If you're swimming, follow that breath protocol.

55:23.460 --> 55:24.880
 For fighters and martial artists,

55:24.880 --> 55:27.720
 there's reason to do the kind of exhale breathing

55:27.720 --> 55:29.600
 through the mouth, the shh kind of thing.

55:29.600 --> 55:31.480
 There are reasons to do that sort of thing

55:31.480 --> 55:33.160
 for particular sports, but for most people

55:33.160 --> 55:36.060
 who are kind of recreational athletes or exercisers,

55:36.060 --> 55:37.480
 learn to be a nasal breather.

55:37.480 --> 55:40.760
 It has positive cosmetic effects, it reduces apnea,

55:40.760 --> 55:44.040
 it offloads more carbon dioxide, it increases lung capacity,

55:44.040 --> 55:48.440
 it dilates the sinuses, and it prevents apnea in sleep.

55:48.440 --> 55:51.640
 So unless you have severe apnea and you need the CPAP,

55:51.640 --> 55:53.740
 becoming a nasal breather can have all sorts

55:53.740 --> 55:55.880
 of positive effects by reducing cortisol,

55:55.880 --> 55:59.120
 reducing apnea, and indirectly,

55:59.120 --> 56:02.720
 raising testosterone and estrogen in the proper ratios.

56:02.720 --> 56:05.080
 So this might seem kind of foundational and indirect,

56:05.080 --> 56:07.260
 but when you go into the scientific literature,

56:07.260 --> 56:10.100
 it comes through as one of the most powerful things

56:10.100 --> 56:13.320
 that you can do that is zero cost,

56:13.320 --> 56:15.560
 takes a little effort, but at zero cost,

56:15.560 --> 56:19.760
 and it has all these positive effects across the board,

56:19.760 --> 56:22.780
 both cosmetic and in sleep and hormonal, et cetera.

56:22.780 --> 56:25.680
 So that's the first piece of behavioral advice.

56:25.680 --> 56:27.440
 The second piece of behavioral advice

56:27.440 --> 56:30.540
 relates to the viewing of light.

56:30.540 --> 56:33.160
 And many of you have heard me talk about this before,

56:33.160 --> 56:35.040
 and I'm not going to belabor the point

56:35.040 --> 56:38.360
 that viewing bright light within the first hour of waking,

56:38.360 --> 56:39.680
 whether or not it's from artificial light

56:39.680 --> 56:40.960
 or ideally from sunlight,

56:40.960 --> 56:44.060
 has these powerful effects on sleep and wakefulness.

56:44.060 --> 56:46.960
 But we have to return to this if you want to understand

56:46.960 --> 56:49.000
 how light can impact hormones,

56:49.000 --> 56:52.200
 because hormones, light and dopamine,

56:52.200 --> 56:54.040
 have a very close-knit relationship,

56:54.040 --> 56:57.400
 so much so that your light viewing behavior

56:57.400 --> 56:59.520
 can actually have a direct effect

56:59.520 --> 57:01.720
 on hormone levels and fertility.

57:01.720 --> 57:05.360
 It can have a direct effect on hormone levels and libido.

57:05.360 --> 57:07.980
 It can have a direct effect on hormone levels

57:07.980 --> 57:09.800
 and your ability to heal quickly.

57:09.800 --> 57:11.320
 And I'm not talking about shining light

57:11.320 --> 57:12.400
 on particular injuries.

57:12.400 --> 57:14.480
 That may or may not have positive effects.

57:15.480 --> 57:18.820
 We can argue about that on a subsequent episode, it may,

57:18.820 --> 57:21.320
 but what I'm talking about is viewing light with your eyes.

57:21.320 --> 57:22.560
 So let's talk about that now

57:22.560 --> 57:26.440
 because the scientific literature on this are robust

57:26.440 --> 57:28.400
 and they extend back several decades,

57:28.400 --> 57:30.920
 and yet I think most people don't really understand

57:30.920 --> 57:32.400
 how powerful this relationship is

57:32.400 --> 57:35.160
 between light, dopamine, hormones,

57:35.160 --> 57:37.680
 and all the great things that the sex steroid hormones do

57:37.680 --> 57:41.000
 when they're available in your body in the proper ratios.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.920
 In order to understand the powerful effects

57:42.920 --> 57:45.740
 that light can have on the sex steroid hormones,

57:45.740 --> 57:49.020
 we need to understand seasonal breeding animals.

57:49.020 --> 57:51.160
 Now, humans are not seasonal breeders,

57:51.160 --> 57:52.800
 but if you understand the biology

57:52.800 --> 57:56.360
 of how light impacts various neurotransmitters and hormones,

57:56.360 --> 57:58.280
 you'll set yourself up for a deep understanding

57:58.280 --> 58:01.000
 of what you should do with your light viewing behavior.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.640
 So several species of animals,

58:03.640 --> 58:05.600
 many species of animals, in fact,

58:05.600 --> 58:09.880
 like rabbits and fox and various mustelids

58:09.880 --> 58:11.360
 like ferrets and ermines,

58:11.360 --> 58:14.960
 change their pelage color across the seasons.

58:14.960 --> 58:16.800
 This might be kind of a duh,

58:16.800 --> 58:20.660
 but fox in winter are often white or light gray,

58:20.660 --> 58:25.140
 and those same animals will be brown or darker colored

58:25.140 --> 58:27.360
 in the summertime and spring months.

58:27.360 --> 58:29.680
 Now, those same animals breed in the spring,

58:29.680 --> 58:31.400
 and they shut down breeding.

58:31.400 --> 58:33.880
 They actually shut down ovulation.

58:33.880 --> 58:36.320
 They often shut down testosterone production

58:36.320 --> 58:37.880
 in the winter months.

58:37.880 --> 58:41.200
 So right now I'm just correlating color of fur

58:41.200 --> 58:43.140
 with tendency to breed.

58:43.140 --> 58:44.460
 Tendency to breed, as we know,

58:44.460 --> 58:47.920
 is going to be related to the levels of sex steroid hormones,

58:47.920 --> 58:49.400
 estrogen and testosterone.

58:49.400 --> 58:53.300
 Now, why would these two things be linked?

58:53.300 --> 58:57.900
 Well, it turns out that dopamine is the link between them.

58:57.900 --> 58:59.520
 So dopamine has a precursor.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.660
 That precursor is tyrosine,

59:01.660 --> 59:04.580
 which is an amino acid, comes from food.

59:04.580 --> 59:06.960
 And when dopamine levels are high, as I mentioned before,

59:06.960 --> 59:10.240
 there's a tendency for more gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

59:10.240 --> 59:12.300
 luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,

59:12.300 --> 59:13.240
 all the hormones that come

59:13.240 --> 59:15.600
 from the hypothalamic-pituitary axis

59:15.600 --> 59:18.340
 and stimulate estrogen and testosterone release

59:18.340 --> 59:20.960
 from the ovary and testes.

59:22.100 --> 59:24.520
 Dopamine basically increases all of that.

59:25.920 --> 59:28.660
 The precursor to dopamine is tyrosine,

59:28.660 --> 59:30.460
 but the precursor to a lot

59:30.460 --> 59:33.300
 of the melanin-producing elements of cells

59:33.300 --> 59:36.500
 that give pigmentation, including for the hair,

59:37.360 --> 59:41.280
 is tyrosine and tyrosinase, an enzyme.

59:41.280 --> 59:45.440
 So yes, the same amino acid-based pathway

59:45.440 --> 59:47.740
 and many of the same enzymes

59:47.740 --> 59:50.420
 that are devoted to dopamine

59:50.420 --> 59:53.820
 and dopamine-increasing the sex steroid hormones

59:53.820 --> 59:57.420
 are devoted to giving pigmentation to the hair and skin.

59:58.280 --> 1:00:02.940
 And this is why in the summer months, when days are longer,

1:00:02.940 --> 1:00:05.260
 animals are breeding more.

1:00:05.260 --> 1:00:07.560
 And this is also why in the winter months,

1:00:07.560 --> 1:00:11.640
 when days are shorter, animals are breeding less.

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:15.720
 This is also why in humans, many people, not all,

1:00:15.720 --> 1:00:18.800
 feel an elevation and mood in the spring and summer months

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:21.160
 because of the amount of sunlight they're getting

1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:24.380
 is increased relative to the winter months.

1:00:24.380 --> 1:00:25.460
 Now, some of you may be saying,

1:00:25.460 --> 1:00:27.400
 I love the fall, I love the winter.

1:00:27.400 --> 1:00:29.860
 Sensitivity to light in these dopamine systems

1:00:29.860 --> 1:00:32.160
 has a strong genetic component.

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:33.440
 So you go to some areas of the world,

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:36.080
 I have relatives who are Scandinavian,

1:00:36.080 --> 1:00:38.320
 and in some areas of Scandinavia,

1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:40.640
 people know that there's a kind of seasonal effect

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.680
 to the disorder, there's kind of a seasonal depression,

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:45.460
 and people get sadder and more quiescent in the winter,

1:00:45.460 --> 1:00:47.600
 there's actually less going out,

1:00:47.600 --> 1:00:49.780
 and therefore there's less sexual behavior,

1:00:49.780 --> 1:00:52.560
 there's less partying and things of that sort.

1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:55.280
 But other people will say, no, during the winter months,

1:00:55.280 --> 1:00:57.960
 I feel great and I love the holidays around winter, et cetera.

1:00:57.960 --> 1:00:59.560
 So there's a lot of variation.

1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:02.400
 But in general, the pathway is the following.

1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:04.300
 Increased viewing of sunlight,

1:01:04.300 --> 1:01:06.900
 and it has to be to the eyes, it's not to the skin,

1:01:06.900 --> 1:01:08.780
 increased viewing of sunlight,

1:01:08.780 --> 1:01:11.180
 increases dopamine levels in the brain,

1:01:11.180 --> 1:01:13.840
 increased dopamine levels in animals and humans,

1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:17.320
 increases the amount of these melanocytes

1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:20.780
 and the activity of these melanin-producing cells,

1:01:20.780 --> 1:01:23.680
 which give pigmentation to the skin and hair,

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:27.760
 and indirectly increase the amount

1:01:27.760 --> 1:01:29.720
 of testosterone and estrogen

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:33.240
 and thereby reproductive behavior, feelings of wellbeing,

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:36.360
 social interactions, reductions, anxiety, et cetera,

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:37.440
 all of which should make sense

1:01:37.440 --> 1:01:39.540
 based on what we've talked about already

1:01:39.540 --> 1:01:41.920
 in terms of the biology and the impact

1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:43.880
 of these steroid hormones

1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:46.420
 on various aspects of the mind and body.

1:01:46.420 --> 1:01:49.000
 So how does this translate to a protocol?

1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.560
 This translates to the protocol

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:54.380
 of if you want to optimize testosterone and estrogen,

1:01:54.380 --> 1:01:57.040
 you need to get your light viewing behavior correct.

1:01:57.040 --> 1:01:59.960
 It's not just about optimizing your sleep,

1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:01.000
 which is also important,

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.760
 it's about getting sufficient amount of light in your eyes

1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:06.120
 so you have sufficient levels of dopamine.

1:02:06.120 --> 1:02:09.100
 So the simple protocols for that I've reviewed before,

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:11.220
 but it means getting anywhere from two to 10 minutes

1:02:11.220 --> 1:02:13.980
 of bright light exposure in your eyes early in the day.

1:02:13.980 --> 1:02:16.680
 It is not sufficient to do this with sunglasses

1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:18.480
 unless you have to do that for safety reasons.

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:21.160
 It's fine to wear prescription lenses and contacts.

1:02:21.160 --> 1:02:23.080
 If you can't get sunlight for whatever reason,

1:02:23.080 --> 1:02:24.900
 you want to use bright artificial light,

1:02:24.900 --> 1:02:26.900
 but that is absolutely critical

1:02:26.900 --> 1:02:29.280
 for timing the cortisol release properly,

1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:31.880
 limiting cortisol release to the early part of the day,

1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:33.380
 getting increases in dopamine

1:02:33.380 --> 1:02:35.440
 that are going to promote the production

1:02:35.440 --> 1:02:38.120
 of testosterone and estrogen to healthy levels.

1:02:38.120 --> 1:02:39.800
 The other aspect of light viewing behavior

1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:41.360
 that's extremely important

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:45.480
 is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes

1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:46.600
 in the middle of the night.

1:02:46.600 --> 1:02:48.480
 If you're viewing bright light in the middle of the night,

1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:50.440
 you are suppressing dopamine release.

1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:52.180
 If you're suppressing dopamine release,

1:02:52.180 --> 1:02:55.000
 you are suppressing testosterone levels.

1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.800
 So much so that I would wager that a major effect

1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:03.800
 of sleep deprivation on reducing testosterone and estrogen

1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:06.700
 is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per se,

1:03:06.700 --> 1:03:08.140
 it's because usually when people

1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:09.440
 are not getting enough sleep,

1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:11.560
 they're getting too much light in their eyes

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.620
 in the middle of the night as well.

1:03:13.620 --> 1:03:16.660
 A study on this has not been completed yet,

1:03:16.660 --> 1:03:19.400
 but there are two studies published in Cell and Neuron,

1:03:19.400 --> 1:03:21.520
 both cell press journals, excellent journals,

1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:23.780
 showing that viewing bright light with the eyes

1:03:23.780 --> 1:03:26.360
 in the middle of the circadian night

1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:28.680
 has a detrimental effect on dopamine,

1:03:28.680 --> 1:03:31.480
 and therefore has a detrimental effect

1:03:31.480 --> 1:03:33.760
 on things like testosterone and estrogen.

1:03:33.760 --> 1:03:36.160
 So you can't even begin to talk about supplements

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:38.460
 and other ways to optimize testosterone, diet,

1:03:38.460 --> 1:03:40.200
 and its effects on testosterone and estrogen

1:03:40.200 --> 1:03:43.020
 and fertility and reproductive behavior, et cetera,

1:03:43.020 --> 1:03:44.880
 until you get your breathing right,

1:03:44.880 --> 1:03:48.400
 until you get things like your light viewing behavior right.

1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:49.940
 So bright light early in the day

1:03:49.940 --> 1:03:52.080
 and throughout the day is great.

1:03:52.080 --> 1:03:55.160
 View as much bright light, ideally sunlight, as you can,

1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:56.600
 as much as you safely can.

1:03:56.600 --> 1:03:58.720
 You obviously don't want to burn your retinas

1:03:58.720 --> 1:03:59.600
 or damage your retinas,

1:03:59.600 --> 1:04:01.360
 so never look at any light that's so bright

1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:02.640
 it's painful to look at.

1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:04.260
 But getting a lot of light in your eyes

1:04:04.260 --> 1:04:06.600
 is not just about adjusting your sleep-wake rhythms,

1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:09.520
 it's also about optimizing your sex steroid hormones.

1:04:09.520 --> 1:04:11.360
 And avoiding bright light in the middle of the night

1:04:11.360 --> 1:04:14.180
 is not just about not disrupting your sleep,

1:04:14.180 --> 1:04:17.440
 it's also about optimizing the sex steroid hormones.

1:04:17.440 --> 1:04:19.040
 And now that you understand

1:04:19.040 --> 1:04:20.540
 a bit of how the sex steroid hormones work

1:04:20.540 --> 1:04:22.940
 and how powerful they are for reducing anxiety

1:04:22.940 --> 1:04:24.720
 and all these other effects,

1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:26.680
 this should be straightforward to do,

1:04:26.680 --> 1:04:28.040
 or hopefully it's inspired you

1:04:28.040 --> 1:04:29.580
 to get your light viewing behavior

1:04:29.580 --> 1:04:31.560
 and your breathing behavior correct.

1:04:31.560 --> 1:04:33.880
 In fact, in thinking about tools,

1:04:33.880 --> 1:04:36.880
 for many people that are suffering from low levels

1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:38.420
 of estrogen if they want higher levels,

1:04:38.420 --> 1:04:41.340
 or low levels of testosterone if they want higher levels,

1:04:41.340 --> 1:04:44.520
 just getting the breathing and light viewing behavior,

1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:48.360
 which will indirectly support sleep behavior,

1:04:48.360 --> 1:04:51.500
 can be a huge and positive effect

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:53.720
 on levels of sex steroid hormones.

1:04:53.720 --> 1:04:56.600
 I can already anticipate that in hearing this,

1:04:56.600 --> 1:04:59.000
 you might wonder whether or not viewing light

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:02.480
 is going to, for instance, increase your testosterone a lot

1:05:02.480 --> 1:05:04.720
 when in fact you want your estrogen increased,

1:05:04.720 --> 1:05:06.680
 or it's going to increase your estrogen a lot

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:09.420
 when you want your testosterone increased.

1:05:09.420 --> 1:05:12.520
 Everything I'm describing here is for people,

1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:15.180
 regardless of chromosomal or gonadal background.

1:05:15.180 --> 1:05:17.880
 So I'm trying to basically offer all this information

1:05:17.880 --> 1:05:19.820
 in one swoop.

1:05:19.820 --> 1:05:23.960
 But basically, if you're somebody who naturally has ovaries

1:05:23.960 --> 1:05:26.560
 and has higher levels of estrogen than testosterone,

1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:28.920
 then viewing bright light early in the day

1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:30.920
 because of dopamine's effects

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:33.960
 is going to promote more estrogen

1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:35.960
 and subtle increases in testosterone.

1:05:35.960 --> 1:05:37.600
 Whereas if you're somebody who starts off

1:05:37.600 --> 1:05:40.200
 with more testosterone and lower estrogen,

1:05:40.200 --> 1:05:42.440
 so somebody presumably who has testes,

1:05:42.440 --> 1:05:44.360
 or maybe you're supplementing with testosterone

1:05:44.360 --> 1:05:46.360
 through other sources for whatever reason,

1:05:46.360 --> 1:05:49.440
 bright light viewing is going to increase testosterone

1:05:49.440 --> 1:05:51.320
 and estrogen in parallel,

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:52.720
 but you're still going to maintain

1:05:52.720 --> 1:05:54.600
 the ratio of testosterone to estrogen.

1:05:54.600 --> 1:05:56.060
 In short, you don't have to worry

1:05:56.060 --> 1:05:57.840
 that you're going to increase the wrong hormone.

1:05:57.840 --> 1:06:00.040
 This is all about optimizing the ratios of hormones

1:06:00.040 --> 1:06:01.800
 that you already have.

1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:03.380
 Okay, so we've talked about breathing.

1:06:03.380 --> 1:06:04.920
 We've talked about light.

1:06:04.920 --> 1:06:07.280
 Let's talk about a third element

1:06:07.280 --> 1:06:09.840
 that there seems to be some excitement about lately

1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:11.940
 for other reasons,

1:06:11.940 --> 1:06:15.420
 but that can actually have some pretty profound influences

1:06:15.420 --> 1:06:19.160
 on hormone levels, and that's heat and cold.

1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:21.800
 So as always, rather than just offer a tool,

1:06:21.800 --> 1:06:24.040
 I'm going to tell you the underlying science

1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:26.340
 as it relates to naturally occurring phenomenon,

1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:27.680
 because in understanding that

1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:29.160
 and understanding the mechanism,

1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:31.480
 you're going to be in a far better position

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.680
 to understand the tools and mechanisms

1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:36.720
 and how you might want to adjust them for your own life.

1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:39.120
 So now you understand the relationship

1:06:39.120 --> 1:06:43.120
 between light, day length, dopamine, and hormone levels,

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:45.520
 and everyone should realize

1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:48.000
 that temperature and day length are linked,

1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:49.060
 and I'm sure as I say that,

1:06:49.060 --> 1:06:51.120
 you're probably thinking, oh, of course.

1:06:51.120 --> 1:06:53.880
 In summer, when there's more sunlight,

1:06:53.880 --> 1:06:55.480
 days are longer, nights are shorter.

1:06:55.480 --> 1:06:57.400
 In general, it tends to be warmer out,

1:06:57.400 --> 1:06:59.760
 and in winter, when nights are longer, days are shorter,

1:06:59.760 --> 1:07:01.780
 it tends to be colder out.

1:07:01.780 --> 1:07:03.760
 And in the winter months,

1:07:03.760 --> 1:07:07.680
 testosterone and estrogen tend to be lower in many animals

1:07:07.680 --> 1:07:11.880
 and in humans, and in the summer months,

1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:13.360
 because of the role of dopamine

1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:15.960
 in promoting the sex steroid hormones,

1:07:15.960 --> 1:07:18.800
 when days are longer and it's warmer,

1:07:18.800 --> 1:07:21.800
 humans tend to make more estrogen and testosterone

1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:24.220
 relative to the other months of the year.

1:07:24.220 --> 1:07:27.360
 Now, these effects can be somewhat weak and modulated,

1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:29.800
 as opposed to in seasonally breathing animals

1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:32.120
 where they're really dramatic, okay?

1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:37.120
 But the point is that temperature and day length

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:40.180
 and sunlight, those are all intimately related

1:07:40.180 --> 1:07:42.780
 because of the systems that we evolved in, right?

1:07:42.780 --> 1:07:44.280
 So before we had artificial light

1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:46.720
 and artificial heating and artificial cooling,

1:07:46.720 --> 1:07:49.840
 our biology evolved under systems where temperature,

1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:52.080
 day length, and the hormones

1:07:52.080 --> 1:07:54.120
 were correlated with one another.

1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:56.060
 So nowadays, there's a lot of interest

1:07:56.060 --> 1:07:59.940
 in using cold as a way to stimulate testosterone.

1:07:59.940 --> 1:08:03.280
 This is mainly because in the sports community,

1:08:03.280 --> 1:08:05.520
 in particular in the bodybuilding community,

1:08:05.520 --> 1:08:08.600
 they are always seeking ways to maximize testosterone,

1:08:08.600 --> 1:08:12.000
 dihydrotestosterone, keep estrogen to its minimum required

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:15.080
 to still have libido and still have skin elasticity,

1:08:15.080 --> 1:08:17.480
 but also walk around with saran wrap skin,

1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:20.520
 then all this kind of extreme stuff that happens there

1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:23.640
 has led to a recent movement where, believe it or not,

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:25.840
 I heard this and I couldn't believe I went and checked,

1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:28.600
 although I didn't buy them, that on Amazon,

1:08:28.600 --> 1:08:30.000
 you can actually find,

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:34.200
 people have their literally underwear that have ice packs,

1:08:34.200 --> 1:08:35.800
 or I think they're ice pack underwear,

1:08:35.800 --> 1:08:38.280
 so that people are making themselves cold

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:39.600
 at the level of the gonads

1:08:39.600 --> 1:08:42.600
 in order to try and increase testosterone and libido.

1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:43.960
 Sounds pretty crazy.

1:08:43.960 --> 1:08:46.040
 But believe it or not,

1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:48.760
 that and things like ice baths and cold showers

1:08:48.760 --> 1:08:53.160
 can have positive effects on the sex steroid hormones,

1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:55.200
 both testosterone, mainly in males,

1:08:55.200 --> 1:08:57.880
 and estrogen, mainly in females.

1:08:57.880 --> 1:08:59.560
 And you might say, wait,

1:08:59.560 --> 1:09:03.960
 I thought cold makes the reproductive axis

1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:07.260
 kind of shut down a bit or reduces testosterone and estrogen

1:09:07.260 --> 1:09:09.720
 but it turns out it's not actually the cold

1:09:09.720 --> 1:09:11.720
 that's having these effects in people.

1:09:11.720 --> 1:09:15.160
 Things like the ice bath, cold showers, cold water swims,

1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:17.900
 these ice underwear, whatever they are,

1:09:17.900 --> 1:09:20.900
 can't believe that these actually exist, but they do exist.

1:09:20.900 --> 1:09:25.240
 What happens is there's a rebound in vasodilation

1:09:25.240 --> 1:09:26.080
 after cooling.

1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:29.200
 So cooling causes vasoconstriction.

1:09:29.200 --> 1:09:30.820
 And then after the cooling,

1:09:30.820 --> 1:09:33.260
 there's a rebound vasodilation

1:09:33.260 --> 1:09:36.700
 and there's more infusion of blood into the gonads.

1:09:36.700 --> 1:09:39.440
 There's also an effect that's neural.

1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:41.340
 So let me explain how this works

1:09:41.340 --> 1:09:43.460
 because there are only a few studies on this,

1:09:43.460 --> 1:09:45.180
 none of which looking at the frozen underwear

1:09:45.180 --> 1:09:46.820
 but that have looked at cold exposure

1:09:46.820 --> 1:09:49.020
 and levels of androgens and estrogens.

1:09:49.020 --> 1:09:50.580
 That's kind of interesting.

1:09:50.580 --> 1:09:53.860
 So you have to remember that the gonad,

1:09:53.860 --> 1:09:57.540
 the ovaries and the testes, are heavily vascularized.

1:09:57.540 --> 1:09:59.540
 Remember, even at the level of the brain,

1:09:59.540 --> 1:10:01.780
 GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone,

1:10:01.780 --> 1:10:03.940
 comes from neurons that, believe it or not,

1:10:03.940 --> 1:10:06.120
 start off in your nose early in development,

1:10:06.120 --> 1:10:07.620
 migrate into the hypothalamus.

1:10:07.620 --> 1:10:08.440
 I'm not making that up.

1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:09.280
 They started off in your nose,

1:10:09.280 --> 1:10:10.940
 migrate into the hypothalamus.

1:10:10.940 --> 1:10:13.660
 Those neurons extend processes,

1:10:13.660 --> 1:10:16.580
 we call them axons, into the pituitary

1:10:16.580 --> 1:10:19.720
 and release GnRH into the pituitary.

1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:22.380
 There's a lot of vascularization within the pituitary,

1:10:22.380 --> 1:10:24.660
 so now those hormones, or GnRH,

1:10:24.660 --> 1:10:27.820
 can stimulate follicle-stimulating hormone,

1:10:27.820 --> 1:10:28.780
 luteinizing hormone,

1:10:28.780 --> 1:10:31.660
 which then are released and travel into the bloodstream.

1:10:32.940 --> 1:10:36.380
 Then those hormones reach the ovary or testes

1:10:36.380 --> 1:10:39.460
 and they have to get into the ovary and testes.

1:10:39.460 --> 1:10:43.140
 And the way they do that is through the vascular system.

1:10:43.140 --> 1:10:45.900
 And people forget, but the vascular system

1:10:45.900 --> 1:10:49.800
 and how constricted or dilated vessels are

1:10:49.800 --> 1:10:52.900
 is controlled by neurons, right?

1:10:52.900 --> 1:10:54.180
 This is what we discussed this

1:10:54.180 --> 1:10:57.260
 during the discussion about stress in the stress episode.

1:10:57.260 --> 1:11:00.400
 But it's well-known to neuroscientists

1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:04.300
 that the best way to shut down neurons is to cool them.

1:11:04.300 --> 1:11:06.420
 So there are a lot of examples of this

1:11:06.420 --> 1:11:07.520
 in the scientific literature,

1:11:07.520 --> 1:11:08.580
 but most people aren't aware of it

1:11:08.580 --> 1:11:09.740
 because you're not digging around

1:11:09.740 --> 1:11:11.300
 in the methods section of these papers.

1:11:11.300 --> 1:11:14.180
 But when we want to shut down neurons,

1:11:14.180 --> 1:11:15.900
 we can do things like inject drugs

1:11:15.900 --> 1:11:17.620
 that will do that like lidocaine,

1:11:17.620 --> 1:11:19.180
 the stuff that makes you numb at the dentist,

1:11:19.180 --> 1:11:20.820
 or you can use different inhibitors.

1:11:20.820 --> 1:11:22.980
 But one of the best ways to do it experimentally

1:11:22.980 --> 1:11:24.320
 is to just cool neurons.

1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:26.620
 When you make neurons cold,

1:11:26.620 --> 1:11:28.260
 because there's a temperature dependence

1:11:28.260 --> 1:11:30.600
 of when neurons can be active and when they can't,

1:11:30.600 --> 1:11:32.300
 the neurons shut down.

1:11:32.300 --> 1:11:36.300
 So the most plausible explanation for why cold exposure,

1:11:36.300 --> 1:11:40.140
 either through one to 10-minute ice bath or cold shower

1:11:40.140 --> 1:11:41.820
 or the ice underpants thing,

1:11:41.820 --> 1:11:45.100
 would increase testosterone or increase estrogen

1:11:45.100 --> 1:11:47.180
 is that you're cooling the neurons

1:11:47.180 --> 1:11:50.460
 that control vasoconstriction and vasodilation

1:11:50.460 --> 1:11:55.240
 and shutting down the entry of blood,

1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:59.140
 or at least reducing it, and hormones into the gonad.

1:11:59.140 --> 1:12:02.180
 And then when the gonad and the surrounding area

1:12:02.180 --> 1:12:06.300
 heats up again, you're getting a rebound hypervasodilation

1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:09.060
 that delivers excessive levels of,

1:12:09.060 --> 1:12:12.300
 not excessive, but increased levels of GnRH

1:12:12.300 --> 1:12:15.740
 and other hormones and carriers and carrier proteins

1:12:15.740 --> 1:12:18.280
 and so forth that would then stimulate the gonad

1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:20.100
 to release more testosterone,

1:12:20.100 --> 1:12:22.860
 or would stimulate the gonad to release more estrogen.

1:12:22.860 --> 1:12:25.660
 That's the most plausible explanation I can come up with.

1:12:25.660 --> 1:12:28.220
 There aren't a lot of studies looking at direct effects

1:12:28.220 --> 1:12:29.780
 of temperature on the gonad.

1:12:29.780 --> 1:12:32.400
 And it's going to be a difficult study to carry out

1:12:32.400 --> 1:12:35.100
 in any case, because unless they were done in vitro

1:12:35.100 --> 1:12:38.020
 in a dish, it's very hard to eliminate all the other things

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:40.260
 like vasoconstriction and vasodilation.

1:12:40.260 --> 1:12:42.900
 Put simply, we don't know whether or not cold and heat

1:12:42.900 --> 1:12:47.660
 directly affect the production of testosterone and estrogen.

1:12:47.660 --> 1:12:51.300
 We only know that cold and heat can modulate those

1:12:51.300 --> 1:12:53.060
 probably through indirect mechanisms

1:12:53.060 --> 1:12:54.980
 like controlling the amount of blood flow

1:12:54.980 --> 1:12:57.880
 by way of shutting down or activating the neurons.

1:12:57.880 --> 1:12:59.340
 Now, there's a lot of lore

1:12:59.340 --> 1:13:02.120
 around heating up the gonads too much.

1:13:02.120 --> 1:13:07.120
 There's actually a whole set of pseudoscience web pages

1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:09.920
 out there saying, well, if you want a girl,

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:12.680
 you should conceive the child at this room temperature.

1:13:12.680 --> 1:13:13.520
 And if you want a boy,

1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:15.640
 you should conceive the child at this room temperature.

1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:18.360
 I don't think there's really any firm scientific evidence

1:13:18.360 --> 1:13:20.440
 for that, for either one.

1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:22.980
 But there's some interesting literature

1:13:22.980 --> 1:13:26.260
 about temperature dependence of production of hormones.

1:13:26.260 --> 1:13:28.720
 And I think that it probably relates to these mechanisms

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:32.300
 of vasodilation and neural control over vasodilation.

1:13:32.300 --> 1:13:35.400
 And of course, excessively high heat is not good

1:13:35.400 --> 1:13:39.000
 for the testes, for sperm production, or for sperm health.

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.160
 Sperm have all sorts of proteins in the cap,

1:13:41.160 --> 1:13:43.080
 things like pentraxins and other things

1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:44.540
 that cause them to swim faster

1:13:44.540 --> 1:13:47.240
 when they're expressed properly and in the right locations.

1:13:47.240 --> 1:13:49.720
 And heat actually alters the location

1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:51.480
 and the function a lot of those proteins.

1:13:51.480 --> 1:13:52.960
 They're very heat sensitive.

1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:54.360
 And so that's why excessive heat

1:13:54.360 --> 1:13:56.780
 is truly not good for fertility,

1:13:56.780 --> 1:13:59.320
 which may be independent of heat's roles

1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:02.760
 in promoting estrogen or testosterone.

1:14:02.760 --> 1:14:04.640
 Okay, so now we've talked about breathing,

1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:06.200
 light, and temperature.

1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:07.520
 We talked about parenthood.

1:14:07.520 --> 1:14:09.560
 We talked about competition.

1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:11.880
 And we talked about some pheromone effects.

1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:15.120
 Now let's talk about particular forms of exercise

1:14:15.120 --> 1:14:18.520
 and how they modulate the steroid hormones.

1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:22.100
 And then we're going to talk about various supplements,

1:14:22.100 --> 1:14:24.160
 both in reference to testosterone

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:26.040
 and in reference to estrogen.

1:14:26.040 --> 1:14:29.640
 So now let's talk about how exercise in its various forms,

1:14:29.640 --> 1:14:32.280
 weight training, endurance work, weight training to failure,

1:14:32.280 --> 1:14:34.320
 or less intense weight training,

1:14:34.320 --> 1:14:36.840
 can impact testosterone levels.

1:14:36.840 --> 1:14:37.960
 But I want to remind you

1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:39.500
 that we're talking about testosterone

1:14:39.500 --> 1:14:41.500
 both in males and females.

1:14:41.500 --> 1:14:44.480
 And based on what you know from earlier in the episode,

1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:46.960
 testosterone can have numerous positive effects

1:14:46.960 --> 1:14:50.180
 in both males and females provided they're in optimal range.

1:14:50.180 --> 1:14:53.400
 So if you look on the web, people will say,

1:14:53.400 --> 1:14:57.200
 oh, you know, testosterone is increased by weight training.

1:14:57.200 --> 1:14:58.960
 You want to do the big, heavy compound movement,

1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:01.280
 squats and deadlifts and chins and things of that sort.

1:15:01.280 --> 1:15:02.720
 But what about the scientific studies?

1:15:02.720 --> 1:15:04.340
 Like what's the actual basis for this?

1:15:04.340 --> 1:15:05.560
 Because if you just take a step back

1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:07.640
 and look at this from the perspective of a scientist,

1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:09.640
 you'd say, okay, what is a squat?

1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:12.240
 A squat is loading up a bunch of weights on a bar

1:15:12.240 --> 1:15:14.280
 and then, you know, sitting down essentially

1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:16.080
 and standing up over and over again.

1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:17.840
 What's a deadlift?

1:15:17.840 --> 1:15:19.520
 It's lifting heavy weights from the ground.

1:15:19.520 --> 1:15:22.000
 Why would that increase testosterone, right?

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:24.540
 This is what's often not discussed in the weight training

1:15:24.540 --> 1:15:26.240
 or even the exercise science community.

1:15:26.240 --> 1:15:30.000
 What would actually stimulate the release of testosterone

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:31.860
 from the adrenals and or testes?

1:15:31.860 --> 1:15:34.500
 And which one is it, adrenals or testes or both?

1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:37.460
 And that's often not discussed, but as a neuroscientist,

1:15:37.460 --> 1:15:38.760
 this is the kinds of things we think about

1:15:38.760 --> 1:15:43.160
 because we think always that genes don't create behavior,

1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:45.320
 immune systems don't know when to be activated,

1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:48.240
 lungs don't know when to inhale or exhale,

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:49.520
 hearts don't know when to beat

1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:52.460
 except for the information that it gets from neurons.

1:15:52.460 --> 1:15:55.040
 The nervous system controls all of that.

1:15:55.040 --> 1:15:59.720
 And so really the answer has to be in the neural system

1:15:59.720 --> 1:16:02.200
 that's related to these particular types

1:16:02.200 --> 1:16:04.240
 of weight-bearing exercises.

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:07.000
 So when you go into this literature,

1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:09.480
 it's kind of hard to find real mechanism.

1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:10.720
 You see a lot of effects.

1:16:10.720 --> 1:16:13.360
 You'll hear things like androgen receptor content,

1:16:13.360 --> 1:16:15.560
 meaning testosterone and its derivatives,

1:16:15.560 --> 1:16:18.360
 receptor content following heavy resistance exercise,

1:16:18.360 --> 1:16:20.760
 and you'll find some examples that, for instance,

1:16:21.800 --> 1:16:23.300
 you know, they do muscle biopsies,

1:16:23.300 --> 1:16:26.120
 they can actually see receptor increases

1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:29.220
 looking at either high volume or low volume,

1:16:29.220 --> 1:16:31.960
 really intense exercise, and you can find a lot of that,

1:16:31.960 --> 1:16:33.520
 but not a lot of mechanism

1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:36.040
 about how the nervous system would do this.

1:16:36.040 --> 1:16:38.240
 And the reason you'd want to know how it can do it

1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:41.880
 is that you could potentially build better protocols

1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:45.400
 or figure out exactly what about these movements

1:16:45.400 --> 1:16:48.280
 is triggering increases in androgen receptors

1:16:48.280 --> 1:16:50.080
 and testosterone.

1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:52.920
 So what's interesting is when you start digging

1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:55.320
 into the more mechanistic studies,

1:16:55.320 --> 1:16:58.360
 what you find is that heavy weight training,

1:16:58.360 --> 1:17:02.200
 so this is weight training where the sets are done

1:17:02.200 --> 1:17:05.680
 with anywhere from kind of one to eight rep range,

1:17:05.680 --> 1:17:08.200
 so this translates differently depending on ratio

1:17:08.200 --> 1:17:10.000
 of muscle fiber type and so forth,

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.240
 but where basically people are working at anywhere

1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:15.360
 from like 70% to 95% of their maximum

1:17:15.360 --> 1:17:16.760
 or sometimes even going right down

1:17:16.760 --> 1:17:18.400
 to their one repetition maximum,

1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:21.160
 really kind of max effort,

1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:25.440
 what you find is that using the nervous system

1:17:25.440 --> 1:17:27.740
 in a way in which they're moving heavy loads,

1:17:27.740 --> 1:17:30.040
 so that I would translate to recruitment

1:17:30.040 --> 1:17:33.320
 of high threshold motor units for you muscle physiologists.

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:36.560
 And there's a rule in muscle physiology

1:17:36.560 --> 1:17:39.360
 about the neuron recruitment for moving muscles

1:17:39.360 --> 1:17:42.200
 where you basically use the minimum number of motor units

1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:45.160
 of neurons to activate muscle as you possibly can,

1:17:45.160 --> 1:17:48.460
 as loads increase, you have to recruit more and more neurons.

1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:50.520
 You always hear about recruiting muscle fibers,

1:17:50.520 --> 1:17:52.240
 but really it's recruiting more neurons

1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:55.040
 to recruit more muscle fibers.

1:17:55.040 --> 1:17:58.240
 And what you find is that heavy weight training,

1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:00.460
 but not weight training to failure,

1:18:00.460 --> 1:18:03.740
 where completion of a repetition is impossible,

1:18:03.740 --> 1:18:06.520
 leads to the greatest increases in testosterone.

1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:08.960
 Now I'm sure there are a bunch of exercise jockeys out there

1:18:08.960 --> 1:18:10.880
 that are going to come at me with a bunch of things

1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:13.120
 where, oh yeah, but high volume and this

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:16.600
 and training to failure and that, sure.

1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:19.360
 If you're willing to kind of put things side by side,

1:18:19.360 --> 1:18:22.480
 adjust for exogenous testosterone treatment

1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:25.040
 and all the rest, which was done in these studies,

1:18:25.040 --> 1:18:28.900
 what you find in general is that weight training

1:18:28.900 --> 1:18:32.100
 with heavy loads, so anywhere from one rep maximum

1:18:32.100 --> 1:18:35.880
 to somewhere in the six to eight repetition range

1:18:35.880 --> 1:18:39.840
 in males or females increases testosterone significantly.

1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:44.080
 And it does it for about a day, sometimes up to 48 hours.

1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:45.580
 And the studies that I found,

1:18:45.580 --> 1:18:48.800
 which seem to hold the most rigor or weight

1:18:48.800 --> 1:18:49.920
 based on where they're published,

1:18:49.920 --> 1:18:51.240
 as opposed to being published in the journal,

1:18:51.240 --> 1:18:52.720
 never heard of it, they're published in

1:18:52.720 --> 1:18:55.180
 good quality exercise physiology journals.

1:18:57.280 --> 1:19:02.280
 For instance, the paper by Ratames, R-A-T-A-M-E-S-S et al,

1:19:04.040 --> 1:19:06.400
 which was published in 2005,

1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:09.420
 which talks about modulations in androgen receptor content

1:19:09.420 --> 1:19:10.920
 after heavy resistance exercise,

1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:13.560
 looks at going to failure, not to failure.

1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:18.560
 The work of Sciardo et al, published in 2006,

1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:20.300
 differential effects of strength training

1:19:20.300 --> 1:19:21.880
 leading to failure versus not failure

1:19:21.880 --> 1:19:24.780
 on hormonal responses, strength, and power gains.

1:19:24.780 --> 1:19:25.960
 There are a lot of studies here,

1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:29.500
 and I will certainly put the links to these in the caption.

1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:31.800
 Many of these actually include Duncan French,

1:19:31.800 --> 1:19:34.160
 who runs the UFC Training Center,

1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:35.660
 who I've had the privilege of meeting

1:19:35.660 --> 1:19:38.180
 and discussing some of this with before,

1:19:38.180 --> 1:19:39.880
 as well as other authors, of course.

1:19:39.880 --> 1:19:41.920
 But they all point to the fact that there's something

1:19:41.920 --> 1:19:44.520
 about the engagement of the neurons

1:19:44.520 --> 1:19:48.520
 that recruit high threshold motor units in muscle

1:19:48.520 --> 1:19:51.320
 when moving heavy loads, but not to failure,

1:19:51.320 --> 1:19:54.280
 that has to provide some sort of feedback signal

1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:56.720
 either to the gonad to produce more testosterone

1:19:56.720 --> 1:20:01.600
 or is increasing the activity of receptors in the body.

1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:03.200
 Now, why do I say that?

1:20:03.200 --> 1:20:05.360
 Well, this is the puzzle, right?

1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:06.880
 How is it that a particular movement,

1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:09.300
 just like how is it that interacting with your child

1:20:09.300 --> 1:20:11.740
 is increasing or decreasing testosterone?

1:20:11.740 --> 1:20:13.240
 This is the kind of fundamental question

1:20:13.240 --> 1:20:14.720
 at the mechanistic level.

1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:17.080
 And we answered the question for child rearing.

1:20:17.080 --> 1:20:19.680
 It has probably something to do with smell and pheromones,

1:20:19.680 --> 1:20:21.780
 although I'm sure there are other cues as well,

1:20:21.780 --> 1:20:26.780
 but there's clearly a influence of hard work

1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:31.120
 at the neural level and then at the muscular level

1:20:31.120 --> 1:20:33.140
 for increasing testosterone.

1:20:33.140 --> 1:20:37.400
 And there's also clearly an effect of working too hard

1:20:37.400 --> 1:20:40.280
 and presumably increasing cortisol too much,

1:20:40.280 --> 1:20:41.800
 although I'm speculating there,

1:20:41.800 --> 1:20:44.320
 in terms of reducing testosterone.

1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:46.880
 And so the reason we're getting nitty gritty about this

1:20:46.880 --> 1:20:48.840
 is because ultimately we'd really like to understand

1:20:48.840 --> 1:20:50.580
 what are the optimal protocols?

1:20:50.580 --> 1:20:51.420
 Out there in the literature,

1:20:51.420 --> 1:20:54.480
 you hear move heavy objects to increase testosterone.

1:20:54.480 --> 1:20:55.560
 Some of that will be converted

1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:57.500
 to the more powerful androgen DHT

1:20:57.500 --> 1:20:59.680
 by 5-alpha reductase, et cetera.

1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:01.980
 But we really don't understand yet

1:21:01.980 --> 1:21:04.720
 how these particular behaviors increase testosterone

1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:06.040
 and whether or not it's doing that

1:21:06.040 --> 1:21:07.600
 by modulating the receptors

1:21:07.600 --> 1:21:09.760
 or it's modeling testosterone release directly,

1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:11.580
 presumably testosterone release directly

1:21:11.580 --> 1:21:13.640
 and sensitivity of the receptors.

1:21:13.640 --> 1:21:15.680
 That's what most of the muscle physiology studies

1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:17.480
 that I was able to find point to.

1:21:17.480 --> 1:21:18.800
 But this basically boils down

1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:20.500
 to a particular set of protocols

1:21:20.500 --> 1:21:22.640
 where if you want to increase testosterone

1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:24.200
 for whatever reason,

1:21:24.200 --> 1:21:26.800
 that weight training with heavy loads,

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:30.360
 but not to failure seems to be the best supported,

1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:33.380
 at least scientifically supported solution to that.

1:21:33.380 --> 1:21:35.320
 Now, it may not raise your testosterone levels

1:21:35.320 --> 1:21:36.400
 as high as you want,

1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:39.660
 but it's definitely taking things in the correct direction.

1:21:39.660 --> 1:21:42.020
 Now, many of you might be endurance athletes

1:21:42.020 --> 1:21:46.880
 or also enjoy exercise besides heavy weight bearing exercise

1:21:46.880 --> 1:21:49.280
 and there are several studies exploring

1:21:49.280 --> 1:21:52.460
 whether or not endurance activity

1:21:52.460 --> 1:21:55.800
 can increase or decrease androgen levels

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:58.340
 and whether or not you combine endurance activity

1:21:58.340 --> 1:21:59.180
 and weight training,

1:21:59.180 --> 1:22:00.680
 whether or not that has any effect

1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:03.760
 if you do the endurance activity first or second.

1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:06.040
 And the takeaway from all of this

1:22:06.040 --> 1:22:09.880
 was that endurance activity, if performed first,

1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:12.640
 leads to decreases in testosterone

1:22:12.640 --> 1:22:14.520
 during the weight training session

1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:17.180
 as compared to the same weight training session done first

1:22:17.180 --> 1:22:18.520
 followed by endurance activity.

1:22:18.520 --> 1:22:21.420
 In other words, if you want to optimize testosterone levels,

1:22:21.420 --> 1:22:23.900
 it seems to be the case that weight training first

1:22:23.900 --> 1:22:27.380
 and doing cardio type endurance activity afterward

1:22:27.380 --> 1:22:29.320
 is the right order of business.

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:30.960
 Now, when these are done on separate days,

1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:32.800
 it doesn't seem to have an effect.

1:22:32.800 --> 1:22:35.120
 They showed no statistical interaction,

1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:37.020
 but it seems that if you're going to do these

1:22:37.020 --> 1:22:39.200
 in the same workout episode,

1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:41.420
 that it's move heavy loads first,

1:22:41.420 --> 1:22:43.880
 then do cardiovascular exercise.

1:22:43.880 --> 1:22:46.400
 So there's a little bit of data looking specifically

1:22:46.400 --> 1:22:49.560
 at how endurance exercise impacts testosterone

1:22:49.560 --> 1:22:50.560
 and its derivatives.

1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:53.160
 And it's very clear that high-intensity interval training,

1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:54.360
 sprinting, et cetera,

1:22:54.360 --> 1:22:58.040
 which somewhat mimics the neural activity that occurs

1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:00.060
 while moving heavy weight loads

1:23:00.060 --> 1:23:02.120
 is going to increase testosterone.

1:23:02.120 --> 1:23:04.800
 There's ample evidence for that in the literature.

1:23:04.800 --> 1:23:09.560
 And that endurance exercise that extends beyond 75 minutes

1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:12.000
 is going to start to lead to reductions in testosterone,

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.240
 presumably by increases in cortisol.

1:23:14.240 --> 1:23:17.800
 But of course, the intensity of the exercise

1:23:17.800 --> 1:23:19.240
 is going to be important too.

1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:21.860
 I don't think anyone really believes

1:23:21.860 --> 1:23:23.160
 that hiking for the three hours

1:23:23.160 --> 1:23:25.240
 is going to reduce your testosterone.

1:23:25.240 --> 1:23:27.380
 Whereas I think if one were to go out

1:23:27.380 --> 1:23:29.320
 and run hard for three hours,

1:23:29.320 --> 1:23:31.660
 that you can imagine there'd be reductions in testosterone

1:23:31.660 --> 1:23:34.560
 by way of increases in cortisol.

1:23:34.560 --> 1:23:37.600
 And so while this area certainly needs more research,

1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:40.140
 it's pretty clear that limiting the endurance exercise

1:23:40.140 --> 1:23:43.100
 to 75 minutes or less, not making it too intense,

1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:46.660
 is one way to keep cortisol from going through the roof.

1:23:46.660 --> 1:23:48.240
 But I've talked on previous episodes

1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:50.020
 and there are a lot of others who have talked out there

1:23:50.020 --> 1:23:51.380
 about how to clamp cortisol,

1:23:51.380 --> 1:23:53.540
 how to keep cortisol more reduced.

1:23:53.540 --> 1:23:56.460
 This is also one of the reasons why you can imagine

1:23:56.460 --> 1:23:59.080
 that various individuals, either for competition

1:23:59.080 --> 1:24:00.860
 or just for their own purposes,

1:24:00.860 --> 1:24:03.980
 rely on testosterone therapy, exogenous testosterone,

1:24:03.980 --> 1:24:07.500
 not just for weight training, but for endurance exercise.

1:24:07.500 --> 1:24:09.740
 So this is one of the reasons why every once in a while

1:24:09.740 --> 1:24:11.260
 professional cyclists will get popped

1:24:11.260 --> 1:24:12.820
 for performance in hectic drugs,

1:24:12.820 --> 1:24:14.020
 meaning they'll get caught.

1:24:14.020 --> 1:24:16.640
 And it's not just that they're increasing red blood cells

1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:18.500
 through EPO and things of that sort.

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:20.540
 Oftentimes they're also taking testosterone,

1:24:20.540 --> 1:24:22.540
 not because they want to be large

1:24:22.540 --> 1:24:24.960
 or have massively hypertrophied muscles,

1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:28.060
 but because they're injecting testosterone,

1:24:28.060 --> 1:24:29.200
 they don't have to worry about

1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:31.780
 cortisol-induced reductions in testosterone.

1:24:31.780 --> 1:24:34.380
 They can just clamp or keep their testosterone levels high.

1:24:34.380 --> 1:24:35.780
 Not something I'm recommending,

1:24:35.780 --> 1:24:38.040
 but I'm just justifying the rationale

1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:41.180
 for why an endurance athlete would want to do that at all.

1:24:41.180 --> 1:24:45.060
 So now let's switch over to talking about estrogen.

1:24:45.060 --> 1:24:46.100
 So there are many people

1:24:46.100 --> 1:24:48.760
 who are trying to optimize their estrogen levels.

1:24:48.760 --> 1:24:50.780
 And one of the places where this shows up a lot,

1:24:50.780 --> 1:24:53.580
 and I get a lot of questions about, is menopause.

1:24:53.580 --> 1:24:55.420
 So menopause, as I mentioned earlier,

1:24:55.420 --> 1:24:59.860
 is this fairly massive reduction in the amount of estrogen

1:24:59.860 --> 1:25:01.900
 that is circulating in one's blood,

1:25:01.900 --> 1:25:05.900
 mainly because the ovary is now depleted

1:25:05.900 --> 1:25:08.020
 of some estrogen production of its own,

1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:09.720
 the eggs are not being produced,

1:25:09.720 --> 1:25:11.980
 they've been depleted, et cetera.

1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:15.620
 So menopause is characterized by a variety of symptoms.

1:25:15.620 --> 1:25:17.780
 And it's multifaceted,

1:25:17.780 --> 1:25:20.060
 probably deserves an entire episode on its own,

1:25:20.060 --> 1:25:23.300
 but things like hot flashes, things like mood swings,

1:25:23.300 --> 1:25:26.580
 things like headaches, in particular, migraine headaches.

1:25:26.580 --> 1:25:28.300
 There can be a lot of brain fog.

1:25:28.300 --> 1:25:30.500
 It can be very, very disruptive for people.

1:25:30.500 --> 1:25:32.260
 Now you sometimes hear about andropause,

1:25:32.260 --> 1:25:35.120
 which is thought to be the kind of analog to menopause,

1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:37.400
 but menopause has certain characteristics

1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:42.400
 that make it a very robust phenomenon for most women.

1:25:42.740 --> 1:25:44.620
 Whereas for men,

1:25:44.620 --> 1:25:47.540
 andropause is going to sometimes happen, sometimes won't.

1:25:47.540 --> 1:25:49.580
 In fact, without going into the details

1:25:49.580 --> 1:25:51.860
 of the graphs and the data,

1:25:51.860 --> 1:25:53.580
 it's very clear, as I mentioned earlier,

1:25:53.580 --> 1:25:57.780
 that some men maintain levels of circulating androgens

1:25:57.780 --> 1:26:00.900
 that are quite high, even as similar as they were in puberty

1:26:00.900 --> 1:26:02.620
 and their teen years and 20s,

1:26:02.620 --> 1:26:04.660
 well into their 60s, 70s, and 80s,

1:26:04.660 --> 1:26:06.540
 if they're optimizing a lot of other things,

1:26:06.540 --> 1:26:09.180
 and probably genetics plays a role as well.

1:26:09.180 --> 1:26:10.920
 Whereas some males won't,

1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:13.660
 but within the female population

1:26:13.660 --> 1:26:16.320
 or population of individuals that have ovaries,

1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:20.060
 there's a very stereotyped and characteristic reduction

1:26:20.060 --> 1:26:23.880
 in estrogen levels as the number of eggs becomes depleted.

1:26:23.880 --> 1:26:26.440
 And that's what we think of as menopause.

1:26:26.440 --> 1:26:28.420
 So what are the various things

1:26:28.420 --> 1:26:30.000
 that one can do for menopause?

1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.620
 Well, one of the most common ones

1:26:32.620 --> 1:26:36.020
 is that physicians will prescribe supplemental estrogen.

1:26:36.020 --> 1:26:37.780
 So this is hormone therapy

1:26:37.780 --> 1:26:39.860
 where somebody takes either their oral estrogen

1:26:39.860 --> 1:26:42.060
 or they'll use a patch or a pellet,

1:26:42.060 --> 1:26:45.460
 some way to secrete estradiol into the system.

1:26:45.460 --> 1:26:49.320
 And that has varying success, depending on the individual.

1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:51.000
 Some people respond very well to it.

1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:53.260
 Other people really have challenges with it.

1:26:53.260 --> 1:26:55.340
 And there are a lot of side effects associated with it

1:26:55.340 --> 1:26:57.620
 for some people, not others.

1:26:57.620 --> 1:27:00.220
 In addition, there's a concern always

1:27:00.220 --> 1:27:01.860
 about supplementing estrogen

1:27:01.860 --> 1:27:06.140
 when there's a breast cancer background in the family,

1:27:06.140 --> 1:27:08.220
 or there's concern about breast cancer for any reason,

1:27:08.220 --> 1:27:11.100
 because a lot of those cancers are estrogen dependent.

1:27:11.100 --> 1:27:15.180
 And that's why drugs like tamoxifen and anastrozole

1:27:15.180 --> 1:27:18.060
 and drugs that block either aromatase

1:27:18.060 --> 1:27:21.700
 or block, excuse me, estrogen receptors directly

1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:23.020
 were initially developed.

1:27:23.020 --> 1:27:25.180
 You see them a lot on the internet, again,

1:27:25.180 --> 1:27:27.380
 for all the sports folks

1:27:27.380 --> 1:27:30.260
 who are trying to increase testosterone and reduce estrogen.

1:27:30.260 --> 1:27:32.400
 But remember, those drugs were initially developed

1:27:32.400 --> 1:27:36.040
 as ways to prevent estrogen binding

1:27:36.040 --> 1:27:39.140
 to the estrogen receptor as cancer treatments.

1:27:39.140 --> 1:27:41.700
 So I want to be very clear, and I've said this many times,

1:27:41.700 --> 1:27:44.780
 we always put in the caption of each episode, of course,

1:27:44.780 --> 1:27:47.220
 that I'm not a physician, I'm not an MD,

1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:48.820
 I don't prescribe anything, I'm a professor,

1:27:48.820 --> 1:27:49.640
 I'm professed things,

1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:51.140
 I'm here to translate the scientific literature

1:27:51.140 --> 1:27:53.380
 and point to what might be some useful avenues

1:27:53.380 --> 1:27:54.720
 for exploration.

1:27:54.720 --> 1:27:56.300
 But this is just for information purposes.

1:27:56.300 --> 1:27:58.300
 You should definitely talk to your doctor

1:27:58.300 --> 1:28:00.140
 about anything that I'm talking about now

1:28:00.140 --> 1:28:02.380
 or in any episode for that matter.

1:28:02.380 --> 1:28:06.220
 So if you look at the literature on menopause

1:28:06.220 --> 1:28:10.120
 outside of just standard estrogen therapy,

1:28:10.120 --> 1:28:12.900
 there are some very interesting compounds out there

1:28:12.900 --> 1:28:15.180
 that have been used and that are supported

1:28:15.180 --> 1:28:17.420
 by quality peer-reviewed studies.

1:28:17.420 --> 1:28:19.420
 And again, I'll refer you once again

1:28:19.420 --> 1:28:21.700
 to this amazing website, examine.com,

1:28:21.700 --> 1:28:24.300
 where you can put in essentially any condition

1:28:24.300 --> 1:28:25.140
 or any supplement,

1:28:25.140 --> 1:28:27.400
 and it will point you to the human effect matrix,

1:28:27.400 --> 1:28:29.420
 not animal studies,

1:28:29.420 --> 1:28:32.180
 but human studies that have explored these things.

1:28:32.180 --> 1:28:34.340
 Now, there are a huge variety of them here,

1:28:34.340 --> 1:28:35.820
 so I won't go into all of them,

1:28:35.820 --> 1:28:38.840
 but some of the pro-estrogenic compounds

1:28:38.840 --> 1:28:42.220
 that have been shown to be powerful

1:28:42.220 --> 1:28:44.300
 in the context of menopause,

1:28:44.300 --> 1:28:46.300
 as well as other conditions

1:28:46.300 --> 1:28:48.980
 where estrogen is lower than one would like,

1:28:48.980 --> 1:28:51.340
 include a description and some of the literature,

1:28:51.340 --> 1:28:52.380
 I'll get into this in a moment,

1:28:52.380 --> 1:28:54.940
 of something like black cohosh.

1:28:54.940 --> 1:28:56.560
 I think that's the correct pronunciation.

1:28:56.560 --> 1:29:00.980
 It's literally the word black and then C-O-H-O-S-H.

1:29:00.980 --> 1:29:02.640
 And it's very interesting.

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:05.820
 There are 13 peer-reviewed studies

1:29:05.820 --> 1:29:08.380
 that have reached prominence

1:29:08.380 --> 1:29:10.060
 in the kind of commercial landscape

1:29:10.060 --> 1:29:12.540
 where this substance, black cohosh,

1:29:12.540 --> 1:29:15.140
 has been promoted as a way to increase estrogen.

1:29:15.140 --> 1:29:18.320
 Turns out that the effects are consistent,

1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:19.500
 but are fairly minor,

1:29:19.500 --> 1:29:22.260
 fairly minor increases in estrogen.

1:29:22.260 --> 1:29:25.080
 So it does seem to be a real effect.

1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:27.980
 It is significant over the placebo effect,

1:29:27.980 --> 1:29:30.940
 but there's also a significant placebo effect

1:29:30.940 --> 1:29:32.700
 in some of these studies as well.

1:29:32.700 --> 1:29:35.700
 So what's interesting when you look at these studies

1:29:35.700 --> 1:29:38.060
 is that many of them were carried out

1:29:38.060 --> 1:29:40.380
 over a period of six plus months,

1:29:40.380 --> 1:29:42.460
 they're double-blind studies, et cetera,

1:29:42.460 --> 1:29:46.820
 and almost all of them led to modest increases in estrogen

1:29:46.820 --> 1:29:51.820
 and modest decreases in menopause-related symptoms.

1:29:52.240 --> 1:29:56.220
 Now, a few additional details about these studies,

1:29:56.220 --> 1:30:00.580
 they were generally carried out on women age 45 to 64.

1:30:00.580 --> 1:30:03.320
 In some cases, they look specifically at women

1:30:03.320 --> 1:30:05.140
 that were clinically obese or overweight,

1:30:05.140 --> 1:30:07.040
 although not always.

1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:09.500
 The subject size pools are pretty big,

1:30:09.500 --> 1:30:12.080
 anywhere from 50 to 87,

1:30:12.080 --> 1:30:16.060
 these are decent size, 132 subjects, et cetera.

1:30:16.060 --> 1:30:18.180
 So these look to be like quality studies,

1:30:18.180 --> 1:30:19.340
 and they basically point to the fact

1:30:19.340 --> 1:30:22.580
 that black cohosh can have a modest effect

1:30:22.580 --> 1:30:25.040
 in improving menopause symptoms.

1:30:25.040 --> 1:30:30.040
 The other one is Panax ginseng, so P-N-A-X, ginseng,

1:30:31.640 --> 1:30:33.340
 has been shown to decrease some symptoms

1:30:33.340 --> 1:30:37.080
 associated with menopause, mostly related to libido,

1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:40.220
 although the other effects were unreliable.

1:30:40.220 --> 1:30:41.700
 Other things like maca,

1:30:41.700 --> 1:30:43.780
 which is known to increase dopamine actually,

1:30:43.780 --> 1:30:46.460
 had minor effects, things like,

1:30:46.460 --> 1:30:47.980
 the names here are a little hard to pronounce,

1:30:47.980 --> 1:30:52.980
 so forgive me, things like Valeriana officionalis

1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:55.820
 has shown that there can be some improvement

1:30:55.820 --> 1:30:57.440
 in the hot flash symptoms

1:30:57.440 --> 1:30:59.340
 and some of the insomnia associated with that,

1:30:59.340 --> 1:31:01.180
 so that might be worth exploring,

1:31:01.180 --> 1:31:02.720
 again, discuss with your doctor,

1:31:02.720 --> 1:31:05.900
 but these were both 100 subject plus

1:31:07.380 --> 1:31:09.420
 age 45 to 64 individuals,

1:31:09.420 --> 1:31:11.540
 double-blind placebo-controlled studies

1:31:11.540 --> 1:31:14.620
 that showed significant but modest effects.

1:31:14.620 --> 1:31:17.940
 There was one substance in the gallery

1:31:17.940 --> 1:31:21.840
 of the compounds that was looked at

1:31:21.840 --> 1:31:24.500
 that turns out to be particularly interesting,

1:31:24.500 --> 1:31:27.540
 and this one is also particularly difficult to pronounce,

1:31:27.540 --> 1:31:32.020
 and it's Puraria mirifica,

1:31:32.020 --> 1:31:33.780
 so I'm going to spell this out for you.

1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:38.780
 It's P-U-E-R-A-R-I-A, Puraria mirifica, M-I-R-I-F-I-C-A,

1:31:46.340 --> 1:31:49.100
 and there are four studies on this compound

1:31:49.100 --> 1:31:53.260
 that show in every case it to be very potent,

1:31:53.260 --> 1:31:56.100
 in fact, comparable to estrogen therapy,

1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:57.940
 estrogen replacement therapy,

1:31:57.940 --> 1:31:59.780
 in reducing the symptoms of menopause,

1:31:59.780 --> 1:32:01.260
 so this was pretty striking

1:32:01.260 --> 1:32:02.620
 because when you go through these studies

1:32:02.620 --> 1:32:06.920
 and you look again, they seem to be pretty well controlled

1:32:06.920 --> 1:32:08.740
 as far as I could tell,

1:32:08.740 --> 1:32:11.580
 and they explored a pretty wide subject pool,

1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:16.140
 and it seems that every single one of these studies

1:32:16.140 --> 1:32:21.140
 when looking side-by-side at Puraria mirifica,

1:32:21.300 --> 1:32:22.840
 which is also called,

1:32:22.840 --> 1:32:26.380
 now this is really hard to pronounce, quaocuracao,

1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:30.380
 I guess that's the name that they use in various countries,

1:32:30.380 --> 1:32:33.900
 that it was comparable to estrogen replacement therapy,

1:32:33.900 --> 1:32:36.900
 so I mention this because a lot of people contacted me

1:32:36.900 --> 1:32:39.160
 and said, what about the insomnia in menopause?

1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:41.100
 What about the headaches in menopause?

1:32:41.100 --> 1:32:42.580
 Now, I'm not suggesting you run out

1:32:42.580 --> 1:32:44.340
 and immediately start taking any of these compounds.

1:32:44.340 --> 1:32:46.180
 Please talk to your doctor.

1:32:46.180 --> 1:32:50.660
 Any hormone-related compound is a serious consideration

1:32:50.660 --> 1:32:53.140
 because of the relationship to breast cancers,

1:32:53.140 --> 1:32:55.420
 but just in general, these compounds are,

1:32:55.420 --> 1:32:57.780
 estrogen and testosterone are exceedingly powerful

1:32:57.780 --> 1:33:01.200
 in terms of controlling our mental and physical states,

1:33:01.200 --> 1:33:03.520
 and so you want to approach them with caution,

1:33:03.520 --> 1:33:06.380
 but I thought that that one in particular was interesting

1:33:06.380 --> 1:33:10.620
 and for which there are quite a few PubMed-documented

1:33:10.620 --> 1:33:13.320
 peer-reviewed studies in quality journals.

1:33:13.320 --> 1:33:16.340
 Okay, so now let's talk about the role of specific compounds,

1:33:16.340 --> 1:33:17.840
 some of which, many of which,

1:33:17.840 --> 1:33:20.040
 can be taken in supplementation form

1:33:20.040 --> 1:33:22.520
 or extracted from diet and nutrition

1:33:22.520 --> 1:33:25.620
 in order to optimize sex steroid hormones,

1:33:25.620 --> 1:33:27.660
 and again, I just want to emphasize

1:33:27.660 --> 1:33:29.660
 that I'm not suggesting anyone take anything

1:33:29.660 --> 1:33:31.020
 or stop taking anything.

1:33:31.020 --> 1:33:33.060
 This is purely for informational purposes,

1:33:33.060 --> 1:33:34.460
 but some of the data on these

1:33:34.460 --> 1:33:37.220
 is quite striking and impressive.

1:33:39.220 --> 1:33:44.100
 It's very clear that certain collections of nutrients

1:33:44.100 --> 1:33:48.660
 are useful for promoting testosterone and estrogen production

1:33:48.660 --> 1:33:50.580
 in their proper ratios,

1:33:50.580 --> 1:33:52.880
 and those things are what I would call

1:33:52.880 --> 1:33:54.780
 the sort of usual suspects.

1:33:54.780 --> 1:33:58.180
 Vitamin D, which is important for so many biological

1:33:58.180 --> 1:34:00.500
 functions, including endocrine functions,

1:34:00.500 --> 1:34:04.020
 zinc, magnesium, et cetera,

1:34:04.020 --> 1:34:06.300
 and if you want to look into this more deeply

1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:08.720
 and you want to understand exactly what the negative effects

1:34:08.720 --> 1:34:10.920
 are of not having sufficient zinc, magnesium,

1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:13.300
 and what those levels might actually be,

1:34:13.300 --> 1:34:16.580
 there's a paper that's available, you can go on PubMed,

1:34:16.580 --> 1:34:18.580
 I can't pronounce this last name, I'm sorry,

1:34:18.580 --> 1:34:23.580
 it looks to me like Wrozosek, but it's W-R-Z-O-S-E-K.

1:34:25.060 --> 1:34:27.820
 I hope I didn't butcher that too badly.

1:34:27.820 --> 1:34:32.820
 Wrozosek et al, 2020 in Endocrinology and Metabolism Review.

1:34:33.040 --> 1:34:35.940
 So there's a recent paper in a good peer review journal

1:34:35.940 --> 1:34:39.260
 that talks mainly about how the hypothalamic

1:34:39.260 --> 1:34:43.020
 pituitary adrenal axis and the sex steroid hormones

1:34:43.020 --> 1:34:47.400
 are negatively impacted by deficiencies in magnesium,

1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:50.060
 deficiencies in vitamin D, and deficiencies in zinc.

1:34:50.060 --> 1:34:53.260
 However, that doesn't point to the levels

1:34:53.260 --> 1:34:56.580
 that one should take in order to optimize.

1:34:56.580 --> 1:34:58.780
 So it doesn't say take X amount of zinc

1:34:58.780 --> 1:35:01.180
 or X amount of magnesium or X amount of vitamin D.

1:35:01.180 --> 1:35:05.820
 For that information, because it's so context dependent

1:35:05.820 --> 1:35:07.860
 and individual dependent, I highly recommend

1:35:07.860 --> 1:35:09.460
 you go to examine.com.

1:35:09.460 --> 1:35:11.660
 You can put in zinc or magnesium or vitamin D,

1:35:11.660 --> 1:35:14.060
 and they will give you ranges of dosages

1:35:14.060 --> 1:35:15.880
 that are supported by specific studies.

1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:18.780
 Again, that information is completely free to you,

1:35:18.780 --> 1:35:22.100
 and it's very useful in figuring that out.

1:35:22.100 --> 1:35:24.600
 I personally have supplemented with zinc, magnesium,

1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:25.980
 and vitamin D for years,

1:35:26.900 --> 1:35:28.380
 but many other people do that as well.

1:35:28.380 --> 1:35:29.660
 And the question is always how much?

1:35:29.660 --> 1:35:32.220
 And that's why I'm a proponent of getting blood work done

1:35:32.220 --> 1:35:33.420
 because that's how you know whether or not

1:35:33.420 --> 1:35:36.100
 your androgen levels, as well as things like

1:35:36.100 --> 1:35:39.220
 vitamin D levels, et cetera, are sufficiently high.

1:35:39.220 --> 1:35:40.780
 So the takeaway from these studies

1:35:40.780 --> 1:35:43.260
 looking at what deficiencies cause

1:35:43.260 --> 1:35:45.820
 in terms of deficits in testosterone and estrogen

1:35:45.820 --> 1:35:47.700
 really point in the direction of

1:35:47.700 --> 1:35:50.580
 make sure you're getting adequate zinc, magnesium, and D3

1:35:50.580 --> 1:35:53.340
 unless you want these steroid hormone levels

1:35:53.340 --> 1:35:55.260
 to be reduced for whatever reason.

1:35:55.260 --> 1:35:57.680
 One of the things that's been shown time and time again

1:35:57.680 --> 1:36:00.900
 to have very negative effects on sex steroid hormones,

1:36:00.900 --> 1:36:04.340
 testosterone mainly in men, estrogen mainly in women,

1:36:04.340 --> 1:36:06.540
 is opioids.

1:36:06.540 --> 1:36:10.460
 There's this whole issue, of course, of the opioid epidemic.

1:36:10.460 --> 1:36:11.900
 It's deserving of an entire episode

1:36:11.900 --> 1:36:13.580
 where you're going to talk about that

1:36:13.580 --> 1:36:15.900
 with experts in addiction

1:36:15.900 --> 1:36:19.180
 and people that treat pain and so forth,

1:36:19.180 --> 1:36:23.500
 but the opioids dramatically reduce levels

1:36:23.500 --> 1:36:25.460
 of testosterone and estrogen.

1:36:25.460 --> 1:36:29.500
 And they do that mainly by disrupting the receptors

1:36:29.500 --> 1:36:31.780
 on gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons,

1:36:31.780 --> 1:36:33.300
 these neurons within the hypothalamus

1:36:33.300 --> 1:36:34.940
 that communicate to the pituitary.

1:36:34.940 --> 1:36:38.260
 And in fact, people that take large amounts of opioids

1:36:38.260 --> 1:36:41.440
 or even take low levels of opioids for long periods of time

1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:44.020
 will develop all sorts of endocrine syndromes.

1:36:44.020 --> 1:36:45.860
 That's been shown over and over again.

1:36:45.860 --> 1:36:48.700
 Gynecomastia or male breast development in males,

1:36:48.700 --> 1:36:51.100
 disruptions to the ovary in females.

1:36:51.100 --> 1:36:53.660
 It's really a quite terrible situation.

1:36:53.660 --> 1:36:58.140
 So excessive opioids are very problematic

1:36:58.140 --> 1:36:59.540
 for sex steroid hormones.

1:36:59.540 --> 1:37:02.020
 I don't think anyone will have any trouble

1:37:02.020 --> 1:37:03.140
 finding any literature on that.

1:37:03.140 --> 1:37:04.100
 You can just go into PubMed,

1:37:04.100 --> 1:37:09.060
 you can put opioids, testosterone or opioids, estrogen,

1:37:09.060 --> 1:37:11.000
 but the major effect is actually way up

1:37:11.000 --> 1:37:14.020
 in the hypothalamus to shut down the production of GnRH,

1:37:14.020 --> 1:37:15.760
 the very hormone that stimulates

1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:17.960
 testosterone and estrogen release.

1:37:17.960 --> 1:37:21.500
 Now there's an entire industry devoted to supplements

1:37:21.500 --> 1:37:22.900
 and various things that people can take

1:37:22.900 --> 1:37:24.220
 to increase testosterone.

1:37:24.220 --> 1:37:27.580
 Some of which have scientific data to support them,

1:37:27.580 --> 1:37:29.140
 some of which do not,

1:37:29.140 --> 1:37:31.540
 and some of which have anecdotal support

1:37:31.540 --> 1:37:33.300
 and some of which do not.

1:37:33.300 --> 1:37:35.020
 This ranges so broadly.

1:37:35.020 --> 1:37:38.740
 I mean, things like the material off deer antlers,

1:37:38.740 --> 1:37:41.340
 which is high in supposedly IGF-1,

1:37:41.340 --> 1:37:43.740
 which is in the growth hormone pathway,

1:37:43.740 --> 1:37:48.640
 all the way to actual consumption of bull testes.

1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:50.160
 You can go on Amazon right now,

1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:51.000
 I certainly don't suggest that you do this,

1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:55.500
 and you can actually buy ground-up testes from cows,

1:37:57.860 --> 1:37:59.420
 and you can consume those.

1:37:59.420 --> 1:38:01.260
 Now, a lot of that's going to be broken down in the gut.

1:38:01.260 --> 1:38:02.900
 I'm certainly not suggesting you do that,

1:38:02.900 --> 1:38:06.080
 but just to point out, this is a huge and vast literature,

1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:08.040
 and it actually dates back hundreds of years,

1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:12.260
 even though testosterone wasn't discovered that long ago

1:38:12.260 --> 1:38:14.580
 as a specific hormone molecule

1:38:14.580 --> 1:38:18.020
 and characterized and then resynthesized,

1:38:18.020 --> 1:38:20.100
 it has a huge industry

1:38:20.100 --> 1:38:22.400
 because of the powerful effects that it has.

1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:23.760
 Likewise with estrogen,

1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:25.540
 the development of the birth control pill

1:38:25.540 --> 1:38:28.140
 was only made possible by understanding the structure

1:38:28.140 --> 1:38:29.980
 of estrogen and estradiol,

1:38:29.980 --> 1:38:31.660
 and we're going to talk all about birth control

1:38:31.660 --> 1:38:35.020
 and how it works and its influence on various other pathways

1:38:35.020 --> 1:38:36.460
 in a future episode.

1:38:36.460 --> 1:38:38.780
 But there are these supplement compounds

1:38:38.780 --> 1:38:41.800
 that are supported by the scientific literature

1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:45.380
 in terms of their ability to adjust androgens,

1:38:45.380 --> 1:38:48.340
 things like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.

1:38:48.340 --> 1:38:50.940
 One of the ones that has really good evidence for it

1:38:50.940 --> 1:38:53.020
 is creatine.

1:38:53.020 --> 1:38:55.900
 It's very clear that something about creatine,

1:38:55.900 --> 1:38:58.520
 although the mechanism isn't exactly clear,

1:38:58.520 --> 1:39:01.300
 either increases 5-alpha reductase

1:39:01.300 --> 1:39:04.440
 or makes the testosterone molecule more susceptible

1:39:04.440 --> 1:39:07.220
 to certain enzymatic reactions

1:39:07.220 --> 1:39:09.300
 that leads to increases in DHT.

1:39:09.300 --> 1:39:11.760
 DHT, dihydrotestosterone,

1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:13.080
 as I mentioned in the previous episode,

1:39:13.080 --> 1:39:15.900
 has this dramatic role in creating

1:39:15.900 --> 1:39:19.100
 a kind of masculinization of the brain prenatally.

1:39:19.100 --> 1:39:22.620
 It also defines the primary sex characteristic

1:39:22.620 --> 1:39:24.540
 of the growth of the penis, et cetera,

1:39:24.540 --> 1:39:29.180
 and beyond infancy and early childhood and later in life,

1:39:29.180 --> 1:39:31.860
 it has powerful effects in creating balding

1:39:31.860 --> 1:39:33.020
 and beard growth, et cetera,

1:39:33.020 --> 1:39:36.740
 and it has a much higher affinity for the androgen receptor

1:39:36.740 --> 1:39:39.180
 than does testosterone.

1:39:39.180 --> 1:39:42.040
 So creatine can increase DHT,

1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:45.020
 which means that if you take creatine

1:39:45.020 --> 1:39:47.500
 and you're very DHT susceptible,

1:39:47.500 --> 1:39:49.660
 then you might experience some hair loss.

1:39:49.660 --> 1:39:50.820
 This has been heavily debated.

1:39:50.820 --> 1:39:52.280
 Does creatine cause baldness?

1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:53.120
 It's going to depend.

1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:55.540
 It's going to depend on how much 5-alpha reductase you have

1:39:55.540 --> 1:39:58.020
 and how prone to hair loss you are.

1:39:58.020 --> 1:40:00.840
 Some people can take creatine without any problem

1:40:00.840 --> 1:40:01.680
 in terms of hair loss.

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:02.700
 Some people cannot.

1:40:02.700 --> 1:40:05.060
 They start losing their hair to levels

1:40:05.060 --> 1:40:07.940
 that, at least for them, aren't comfortable.

1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:10.540
 There are a few other things that can increase testosterone,

1:40:10.540 --> 1:40:13.780
 and it has to do with the way that testosterone exists

1:40:13.780 --> 1:40:16.020
 in its free and its bound form.

1:40:16.020 --> 1:40:19.340
 So testosterone, the molecule,

1:40:19.340 --> 1:40:20.840
 is got a total testosterone.

1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:21.840
 That's usually what's measured.

1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:23.140
 This is the kind of levels

1:40:23.140 --> 1:40:24.260
 that are typically thrown around

1:40:24.260 --> 1:40:26.180
 of anywhere from 300 to 900,

1:40:26.180 --> 1:40:27.620
 being the kind of natural range,

1:40:27.620 --> 1:40:29.380
 and then super physiological,

1:40:29.380 --> 1:40:32.020
 getting up into 1200, 1600 range.

1:40:32.020 --> 1:40:35.780
 But testosterone isn't just roaming around free

1:40:35.780 --> 1:40:37.940
 in the blood, at least most of it isn't.

1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:39.140
 Most of it is bound

1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:43.200
 to either sex hormone binding globulin, SHBG,

1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:44.460
 or to albumin.

1:40:44.460 --> 1:40:46.100
 They're needed as transporters

1:40:46.100 --> 1:40:48.140
 to get testosterone into cells

1:40:48.140 --> 1:40:49.940
 so that testosterone can have its effects

1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:51.220
 on gene expression,

1:40:51.220 --> 1:40:54.620
 as well as other pathways within the cells.

1:40:54.620 --> 1:40:58.380
 So people talk about that the level of free testosterone

1:40:58.380 --> 1:40:59.540
 is really what's important

1:40:59.540 --> 1:41:01.900
 and that you want to optimize free testosterone.

1:41:01.900 --> 1:41:03.820
 That's a little bit of a tricky statement.

1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:07.540
 That's kind of like it's true,

1:41:07.540 --> 1:41:10.560
 and yet it's not really reflective

1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:11.780
 of a thorough understanding

1:41:11.780 --> 1:41:14.400
 of how these binding globulins work.

1:41:14.400 --> 1:41:15.660
 Remember, these binding globulins

1:41:15.660 --> 1:41:17.540
 aren't there to soak up all your testosterone

1:41:17.540 --> 1:41:19.620
 just to make it hard for you to free up testosterone

1:41:19.620 --> 1:41:22.940
 and make gains in the gym or whatever it is,

1:41:22.940 --> 1:41:24.140
 or have increases in libido.

1:41:24.140 --> 1:41:26.820
 They're there to actually transport testosterone

1:41:26.820 --> 1:41:28.280
 to specific tissues,

1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:30.020
 to shuttle them to specific tissues,

1:41:30.020 --> 1:41:34.000
 and to set the rate of bound and unbound testosterone

1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.500
 so that it's not all unbound at once.

1:41:36.500 --> 1:41:39.300
 And it's always interesting to look in the literature

1:41:39.300 --> 1:41:41.940
 and see how everyone wants to free up their testosterone

1:41:41.940 --> 1:41:42.780
 so that it can work.

1:41:42.780 --> 1:41:46.020
 But sex hormone binding globulin

1:41:46.020 --> 1:41:47.860
 can bind up too much testosterone

1:41:47.860 --> 1:41:50.380
 to the point where it's having negative effects on libido

1:41:50.380 --> 1:41:53.300
 or on muscle growth and fat loss and things of that sort.

1:41:53.300 --> 1:41:55.140
 This is true in males and females.

1:41:55.140 --> 1:41:58.520
 Or it can be doing exactly what it's supposed to do,

1:41:58.520 --> 1:42:01.340
 which is shuttling testosterone to the proper tissues

1:42:01.340 --> 1:42:02.860
 and organs where it has all these effects,

1:42:02.860 --> 1:42:04.260
 including the brain.

1:42:04.260 --> 1:42:09.260
 So there are supplements, in particular, Tonga Ali,

1:42:09.900 --> 1:42:11.500
 which has this other name.

1:42:11.500 --> 1:42:13.440
 It's something I've called Tonga Ali.

1:42:13.440 --> 1:42:15.580
 Sometimes it's called, and forgive me,

1:42:15.580 --> 1:42:16.560
 that's hard to pronounce,

1:42:16.560 --> 1:42:21.480
 but uricoma longifolia jack.

1:42:21.480 --> 1:42:22.760
 They always seem to have these names

1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:27.120
 that kind of allude to androgenic features,

1:42:27.120 --> 1:42:29.300
 like I don't know why longifolia jack.

1:42:29.300 --> 1:42:30.240
 I don't know.

1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:31.380
 I think it's kind of obvious

1:42:31.380 --> 1:42:34.000
 why that sounds sort of androgenic.

1:42:35.740 --> 1:42:37.600
 This has been shown in several studies,

1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:39.140
 and you can find these on examine.com,

1:42:39.140 --> 1:42:40.420
 or you can go to PubMed if you like.

1:42:40.420 --> 1:42:41.260
 I've looked at these.

1:42:41.260 --> 1:42:43.780
 That it does seem to have some pro-fertility,

1:42:43.780 --> 1:42:48.780
 pro-free testosterone and subtle aphrodisiac effects.

1:42:49.180 --> 1:42:52.540
 It does also seem to be a slight anti-estrogen.

1:42:52.540 --> 1:42:56.020
 So the reports of this are people take this

1:42:56.020 --> 1:42:58.460
 anywhere from 400 to 800 milligrams a day.

1:42:58.460 --> 1:42:59.880
 Again, I'm not suggesting you do that,

1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:01.260
 but that's kind of what's out there.

1:43:01.260 --> 1:43:03.860
 And there is some decent scientific literature

1:43:03.860 --> 1:43:05.680
 to support the fact that it liberates

1:43:05.680 --> 1:43:07.820
 some of the bound testosterone

1:43:07.820 --> 1:43:10.540
 and allows more free testosterone to be available.

1:43:10.540 --> 1:43:12.900
 Some of the reported quote-unquote side effects

1:43:12.900 --> 1:43:15.900
 are things like excessive alertness and insomnia

1:43:15.900 --> 1:43:17.660
 if it's taken too late in the day and so forth.

1:43:17.660 --> 1:43:19.820
 But I encourage you to explore that further

1:43:19.820 --> 1:43:22.580
 if increasing free testosterone

1:43:22.580 --> 1:43:25.460
 is something that you're interested in doing.

1:43:25.460 --> 1:43:29.580
 examine.com includes a lot of other things

1:43:29.580 --> 1:43:31.900
 that can increase testosterone.

1:43:31.900 --> 1:43:34.260
 One of the things that's been purported

1:43:34.260 --> 1:43:36.940
 to free up testosterone in the blood

1:43:36.940 --> 1:43:39.820
 are things like nettles, stinging nettles.

1:43:39.820 --> 1:43:41.780
 Although I should point out that the literature points

1:43:41.780 --> 1:43:45.120
 to stinging nettle also having some fairly potent effects

1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:47.300
 on the prostate and on the liver.

1:43:47.300 --> 1:43:49.060
 And so it might be a tricky molecule,

1:43:49.060 --> 1:43:52.280
 maybe not an attractive one for people to take.

1:43:52.280 --> 1:43:54.460
 So we talked about creatine, we talked about Tonga Ali.

1:43:54.460 --> 1:43:57.380
 It's clear that boron, which is really interesting,

1:43:57.380 --> 1:44:00.200
 believe it or not, I think boron comes from,

1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:02.420
 I think these were like meteors that landed on earth

1:44:02.420 --> 1:44:03.860
 that now they extract boron.

1:44:03.860 --> 1:44:07.400
 It's one of these crazy stories that when you look at it,

1:44:07.400 --> 1:44:08.660
 you go, how could that possibly be?

1:44:08.660 --> 1:44:11.020
 But there's actually, that's how it works.

1:44:11.020 --> 1:44:15.120
 That boron, there's some scientific support for it

1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:16.500
 freeing up more testosterone.

1:44:16.500 --> 1:44:17.720
 And again, freeing up testosterone

1:44:17.720 --> 1:44:19.280
 may be exactly what you want.

1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:21.140
 I just don't think that we should demonize

1:44:21.140 --> 1:44:23.860
 these carrier proteins like albumin and SHBG.

1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:26.660
 In fact, albumin is very important for testosterone

1:44:26.660 --> 1:44:28.300
 to be able to make it into the brain

1:44:28.300 --> 1:44:31.420
 to have some of the pro-androgenic effects

1:44:31.420 --> 1:44:33.580
 on the cognitive effects of testosterone,

1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:35.220
 because in both males and females,

1:44:35.220 --> 1:44:38.140
 testosterone can shift these behaviors

1:44:38.140 --> 1:44:43.140
 like mate-seeking, reductions in anxiety and so forth

1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:45.660
 that we talked about before, only by making it

1:44:45.660 --> 1:44:46.480
 into the brain.

1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:48.460
 And there is this thing called the blood-brain barrier,

1:44:48.460 --> 1:44:51.860
 which is fascinating and deserving of an entire episode also

1:44:51.860 --> 1:44:54.840
 and getting molecules across the blood-brain barrier,

1:44:54.840 --> 1:44:56.700
 even if they're sex steroid hormones,

1:44:56.700 --> 1:44:59.380
 which are lipophilic and can pass through cell membranes,

1:44:59.380 --> 1:45:00.820
 requires carriers.

1:45:00.820 --> 1:45:05.620
 And those carriers often are bound to or include albumin.

1:45:05.620 --> 1:45:10.620
 And so it's not the goal to free up all your testosterone,

1:45:11.220 --> 1:45:13.140
 but getting free testosterone into a range

1:45:13.140 --> 1:45:15.580
 that works for your particular goals and needs

1:45:15.580 --> 1:45:17.180
 is an attractive one.

1:45:17.180 --> 1:45:19.700
 And that's why we're discussing these particular tools.

1:45:19.700 --> 1:45:21.900
 The amounts of boron that people take,

1:45:21.900 --> 1:45:24.300
 and you can find this again on PubMed or Examine,

1:45:24.300 --> 1:45:26.420
 but people take a couple grams of it a day.

1:45:26.420 --> 1:45:28.120
 I'm not aware of any specific side effects,

1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:30.260
 but you always, always, always want to examine

1:45:30.260 --> 1:45:31.980
 for the particular side effects.

1:45:31.980 --> 1:45:34.580
 And people with different backgrounds and conditions,

1:45:34.580 --> 1:45:37.100
 as we talked about for menopause and estrogen,

1:45:37.100 --> 1:45:38.100
 have to be careful,

1:45:38.100 --> 1:45:40.900
 because when you're starting to modulate hormones,

1:45:40.900 --> 1:45:44.020
 you're starting to modulate not just the tissues

1:45:44.020 --> 1:45:46.900
 that thrive on binding of those hormones,

1:45:46.900 --> 1:45:51.220
 but remember, the reason why there's so much breast cancer,

1:45:51.220 --> 1:45:53.340
 and there's a reason why there's so much testicular cancer,

1:45:53.340 --> 1:45:55.320
 is that any tissue that undergoes

1:45:55.320 --> 1:45:58.240
 rapid reproduction of particular cells,

1:45:58.240 --> 1:46:00.660
 so there's a lot of reproduction of cells

1:46:00.660 --> 1:46:01.900
 and shedding of uterine lining,

1:46:01.900 --> 1:46:04.580
 and the reproduction of cells and eggs in the ovary,

1:46:04.580 --> 1:46:06.260
 and in the testes, there's the production

1:46:06.260 --> 1:46:09.220
 of Leydig and Sertoli cells,

1:46:09.220 --> 1:46:12.660
 and there's this kind of ongoing production of sperm,

1:46:12.660 --> 1:46:15.460
 that's why those tissues are particularly vulnerable

1:46:15.460 --> 1:46:16.640
 to the development of cancers.

1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:18.860
 And many of those cancers are androgen-sensitive.

1:46:18.860 --> 1:46:21.240
 That's why one of the major treatments

1:46:21.240 --> 1:46:23.740
 for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer

1:46:23.740 --> 1:46:26.740
 is to give antiandrogenic drugs, okay?

1:46:26.740 --> 1:46:28.340
 It's not just a shutdown,

1:46:28.340 --> 1:46:33.020
 all things related to being androgenized,

1:46:33.020 --> 1:46:35.720
 it's really about trying to prevent testosterone

1:46:35.720 --> 1:46:37.660
 from encouraging growth of tumors.

1:46:37.660 --> 1:46:41.540
 So I want to really emphasize the caution there,

1:46:41.540 --> 1:46:43.780
 because it is easy when thinking about

1:46:43.780 --> 1:46:46.180
 optimizing estrogen and testosterone to just think,

1:46:46.180 --> 1:46:48.940
 oh, more is better, more is definitely not better,

1:46:48.940 --> 1:46:50.740
 and it's not just because they can aromatize

1:46:50.740 --> 1:46:52.400
 or convert into other things,

1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:54.920
 it's because cancers or any tissue

1:46:54.920 --> 1:46:57.780
 that has a lot of turnover of cells

1:46:57.780 --> 1:47:00.340
 is going to thrive on androgen,

1:47:00.340 --> 1:47:01.580
 anything that promotes growth,

1:47:01.580 --> 1:47:03.540
 it's going to thrive on estrogen.

1:47:03.540 --> 1:47:05.740
 Remember, brain tissue doesn't turn over that much,

1:47:05.740 --> 1:47:07.660
 there isn't really much production of new neurons,

1:47:07.660 --> 1:47:09.580
 brain cancers happen, but they're kind of rare,

1:47:09.580 --> 1:47:11.900
 and when they do happen, they tend to be glial cells,

1:47:11.900 --> 1:47:13.520
 which have a lot of proliferation.

1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:14.940
 Glial cells can proliferate,

1:47:14.940 --> 1:47:17.060
 adult neurons don't create more of themselves,

1:47:17.060 --> 1:47:19.420
 they don't create more neurons in general,

1:47:19.420 --> 1:47:21.860
 except in a few places in the brain and body.

1:47:21.860 --> 1:47:26.860
 So any tissue that recycles itself is prone to cancers,

1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:31.260
 and those tissues thrive on androgens and estrogens

1:47:31.260 --> 1:47:32.640
 to create more tumors,

1:47:32.640 --> 1:47:34.060
 so you have to be careful

1:47:34.060 --> 1:47:35.580
 anytime you're modulating hormones,

1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:38.420
 especially androgens and estrogens.

1:47:38.420 --> 1:47:40.020
 And in my scouring of the literature

1:47:40.020 --> 1:47:41.820
 and looking at kind of what's out there

1:47:41.820 --> 1:47:43.860
 and what people are talking about,

1:47:43.860 --> 1:47:46.700
 and I also mean in the scientific literature,

1:47:46.700 --> 1:47:49.860
 one of the things that is new to me anyway,

1:47:49.860 --> 1:47:54.380
 probably not new to a lot of the gym rats out there,

1:47:54.380 --> 1:47:56.460
 or the people that spend a lot of time on YouTube videos

1:47:56.460 --> 1:47:58.820
 talking about androgens,

1:47:58.820 --> 1:48:01.540
 are these, forgive me for butchering the name again,

1:48:01.540 --> 1:48:03.620
 are these ectosteroids.

1:48:03.620 --> 1:48:08.360
 So ectosteroids are molecules

1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:12.100
 that come from things like spinach, believe it or not,

1:48:12.100 --> 1:48:16.420
 that have a lot of similarity to the cholesterol molecule.

1:48:16.420 --> 1:48:19.220
 The one that's being discussed a lot out there right now

1:48:19.220 --> 1:48:21.860
 is something called turkisterone.

1:48:21.860 --> 1:48:23.500
 I wish I knew why it was called turkisterone.

1:48:23.500 --> 1:48:25.020
 Someone tell me why it's called turkisterone.

1:48:25.020 --> 1:48:27.380
 Does it have anything to do with turkeys?

1:48:27.380 --> 1:48:30.300
 I don't know why it's called turkisterone.

1:48:30.300 --> 1:48:32.300
 Perhaps someone will know.

1:48:32.300 --> 1:48:35.020
 In any case, these ectosteroids

1:48:35.020 --> 1:48:36.820
 are similar enough to cholesterol.

1:48:36.820 --> 1:48:39.300
 Remember, cholesterol is the precursor

1:48:39.300 --> 1:48:42.060
 to testosterone, cortisol, and estrogen.

1:48:42.060 --> 1:48:45.780
 And it appears that some of these ectosteroids

1:48:45.780 --> 1:48:48.060
 do have bioavailability,

1:48:48.060 --> 1:48:49.980
 or their metabolites are bioavailable.

1:48:49.980 --> 1:48:52.620
 And this was something that for many years,

1:48:52.620 --> 1:48:55.220
 people talked about whether or not insect hormones

1:48:55.220 --> 1:48:56.740
 or hormones from other species

1:48:56.740 --> 1:48:58.940
 could actually be used by humans,

1:48:58.940 --> 1:49:01.320
 or whether or not it would have any effect at all.

1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:02.720
 And it's pretty clear,

1:49:02.720 --> 1:49:04.400
 based on a study that I was able to find,

1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:06.980
 there's a paper that came out in 2019.

1:49:06.980 --> 1:49:11.100
 It's a comparative study in the archives of toxicology.

1:49:11.100 --> 1:49:15.900
 This is Isenman et al., I-S-E-N-M-A-N-N et al.,

1:49:15.900 --> 1:49:17.820
 that talks about the ectosteroids

1:49:18.740 --> 1:49:21.960
 and was given in conjunction with strength training

1:49:21.960 --> 1:49:22.860
 or no strength training.

1:49:22.860 --> 1:49:24.300
 This is a 10-week intervention.

1:49:24.300 --> 1:49:27.540
 And their conclusion is that these ectosteroids

1:49:27.540 --> 1:49:31.360
 had a fairly significant, above placebo controls,

1:49:31.360 --> 1:49:34.940
 increases in muscle mass, strength, hypertrophy effects,

1:49:34.940 --> 1:49:37.020
 all the sorts of things that one would expect

1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:39.540
 with increases in androgen.

1:49:39.540 --> 1:49:43.540
 Their conclusion of this study is not my conclusion,

1:49:43.540 --> 1:49:45.300
 although I may or may not agree with them.

1:49:45.300 --> 1:49:46.540
 This isn't about my opinions.

1:49:46.540 --> 1:49:47.480
 It's just, I want to be clear,

1:49:47.480 --> 1:49:48.940
 these are their words, not mine.

1:49:48.940 --> 1:49:52.900
 But they say that, in their words, quote,

1:49:52.900 --> 1:49:55.460
 "'Our results strongly suggest the inclusion of ectosteroid

1:49:55.460 --> 1:49:56.920
 in the list of prohibitive substances.'"

1:49:56.920 --> 1:49:58.580
 So they're saying these things are so powerful

1:49:58.580 --> 1:50:00.240
 that they should be on the list of banned substances,

1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:04.340
 which might be upsetting to some,

1:50:04.340 --> 1:50:07.420
 or some of you might be thinking, well, who cares?

1:50:07.420 --> 1:50:12.420
 The whole issue of augmenting hormones in sports

1:50:12.620 --> 1:50:14.600
 is a very interesting issue.

1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:16.900
 In fact, if you just want a little anecdote about that,

1:50:16.900 --> 1:50:18.860
 I can't reveal names here, of course,

1:50:18.860 --> 1:50:21.860
 but what I learned recently was very surprising to me,

1:50:21.860 --> 1:50:24.860
 which is that many athletes in pro sports

1:50:24.860 --> 1:50:27.020
 are taking testosterone,

1:50:27.020 --> 1:50:30.540
 and they are able to do that legally,

1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:32.500
 not just because it's available by prescription,

1:50:32.500 --> 1:50:33.860
 but they are allowed to do that

1:50:33.860 --> 1:50:35.860
 under the rules of their sport,

1:50:35.860 --> 1:50:38.860
 in the fine print that no one, including me, had ever seen,

1:50:39.780 --> 1:50:41.140
 if they've had an injury.

1:50:41.140 --> 1:50:42.800
 So if athletes are injured,

1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:45.660
 then it opens up the door for certain forms

1:50:45.660 --> 1:50:47.860
 of testosterone augmentation,

1:50:47.860 --> 1:50:50.460
 and other types of augmentations

1:50:50.460 --> 1:50:52.740
 that are not available to them if they're not injured,

1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:54.140
 which always makes me wonder now,

1:50:54.140 --> 1:50:55.180
 when I see them getting injured,

1:50:55.180 --> 1:50:57.660
 whether or not that's an attempt to get some of the support,

1:50:57.660 --> 1:51:00.060
 because there's absolutely no question

1:51:00.060 --> 1:51:03.980
 that estrogens and testosterone modulate gene expression,

1:51:03.980 --> 1:51:06.380
 modulate strength, modulate the way the brain works,

1:51:06.380 --> 1:51:09.660
 modulates our relationship to effort and anxiety, et cetera.

1:51:09.660 --> 1:51:11.820
 And while we're talking about supplementation,

1:51:11.820 --> 1:51:13.380
 the effects of supplementation,

1:51:14.540 --> 1:51:17.100
 I would say in some individuals can be quite dramatic,

1:51:17.100 --> 1:51:19.680
 but they're always, always, always,

1:51:20.740 --> 1:51:24.980
 except in extreme cases, going to be far subtler,

1:51:24.980 --> 1:51:29.900
 excuse me, far more subtle, to use the proper English,

1:51:29.900 --> 1:51:32.080
 far more subtle than would be, for instance,

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:34.540
 just in injecting testosterone

1:51:34.540 --> 1:51:36.780
 or injecting estrogen, et cetera.

1:51:36.780 --> 1:51:40.020
 So I think we should just be honest and upfront about that.

1:51:41.260 --> 1:51:44.980
 So thus far, in terms of talking about optimizing hormones,

1:51:44.980 --> 1:51:47.420
 and in the discussion of supplementation,

1:51:48.460 --> 1:51:49.800
 I haven't really talked about things

1:51:49.800 --> 1:51:51.740
 that actually affect the brain directly,

1:51:51.740 --> 1:51:54.780
 that increase the pituitary output and things of that sort.

1:51:54.780 --> 1:51:55.880
 We've mainly been talking about things

1:51:55.880 --> 1:51:57.460
 that free up testosterone,

1:51:57.460 --> 1:52:00.580
 or that increase estrogen at the level of the periphery.

1:52:00.580 --> 1:52:02.100
 But if you remember way back to the beginning

1:52:02.100 --> 1:52:02.980
 of this episode,

1:52:02.980 --> 1:52:05.120
 hormones are made in different locations in the body,

1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:07.840
 and there are hormones that promote the release

1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:09.380
 and the production of hormones

1:52:09.380 --> 1:52:10.440
 from other tissues in the body.

1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:14.140
 And one of the main hormones for that is luteinizing hormone.

1:52:14.140 --> 1:52:15.300
 Luteinizing hormone, again,

1:52:15.300 --> 1:52:17.200
 comes from the pituitary, circulates,

1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:18.820
 and either goes to the ovary

1:52:18.820 --> 1:52:23.820
 to promote various aspects of egg maturation,

1:52:23.940 --> 1:52:26.660
 as well as production of estrogen,

1:52:26.660 --> 1:52:31.660
 and to the testes to promote testosterone and sperm production.

1:52:31.700 --> 1:52:35.360
 And the prescription version

1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:39.100
 of increasing luteinizing hormone is something called HCG,

1:52:39.100 --> 1:52:40.740
 or human chorionic gonadotropin,

1:52:40.740 --> 1:52:41.920
 which has been synthesized

1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:44.460
 and is now available as a prescription drug.

1:52:44.460 --> 1:52:48.860
 It's taken in various contexts for increasing fertility,

1:52:48.860 --> 1:52:51.020
 both by males and by females.

1:52:51.020 --> 1:52:54.680
 It can increase, for all the reasons that now make sense,

1:52:54.680 --> 1:52:56.020
 it can increase sperm production,

1:52:56.020 --> 1:52:59.020
 it can produce ovulation frequency,

1:52:59.020 --> 1:53:02.180
 it can produce the number of eggs even that are deployed

1:53:02.180 --> 1:53:03.660
 in a given ovulation,

1:53:03.660 --> 1:53:06.420
 although that's not always a good thing.

1:53:06.420 --> 1:53:10.020
 It basically is pro-fertility, pro-testosterone,

1:53:10.020 --> 1:53:12.940
 pro-estrogen, depending on your background.

1:53:12.940 --> 1:53:17.940
 And what's interesting is HCG was initially synthesized,

1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:22.220
 collected and synthesized from pregnant women's urine,

1:53:22.220 --> 1:53:27.020
 and believe it or not, before it was synthetically made

1:53:27.020 --> 1:53:29.720
 and sold as a prescription drug,

1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:33.560
 there was actually a black market for pregnant women's urine

1:53:33.560 --> 1:53:35.260
 where people would buy the urine.

1:53:35.260 --> 1:53:37.840
 I don't know, I'm guessing that they probably

1:53:37.840 --> 1:53:40.580
 just consumed it, which is weird.

1:53:40.580 --> 1:53:44.180
 But in any case, human chorionic gonadotropin

1:53:44.180 --> 1:53:46.320
 is now available as a prescription drug,

1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:48.540
 and it's one of the things that many people use

1:53:48.540 --> 1:53:51.180
 to increase testosterone or estrogen

1:53:51.180 --> 1:53:52.580
 for increasing fertility.

1:53:52.580 --> 1:53:54.100
 In some cases, I think it's used

1:53:54.100 --> 1:53:55.740
 to increase sports performance

1:53:55.740 --> 1:53:59.120
 or when people have shut down their gonads

1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:01.940
 for whatever reason, because of excessive hormone therapies

1:54:01.940 --> 1:54:04.980
 or they have some sort of,

1:54:04.980 --> 1:54:07.600
 sometimes they're actually lesions to the pituitary.

1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:10.220
 Sometimes people have a tumor in the pituitary.

1:54:10.220 --> 1:54:11.940
 It's actually not common,

1:54:11.940 --> 1:54:14.320
 but among brain tumors and neural tumors,

1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:15.900
 it's one of the more common ones.

1:54:15.900 --> 1:54:18.340
 And then you get deficiencies in LH and FSH,

1:54:18.340 --> 1:54:20.920
 and so people will take HCG to stimulate the gonads.

1:54:20.920 --> 1:54:21.900
 So there are a variety of reasons

1:54:21.900 --> 1:54:23.820
 why these drugs were created.

1:54:23.820 --> 1:54:26.380
 But there are certain supplements, not many,

1:54:26.380 --> 1:54:28.980
 that apparently can increase luteinizing hormone

1:54:28.980 --> 1:54:31.980
 and thereby can increase testosterone and estrogen.

1:54:31.980 --> 1:54:34.540
 And one of the more well-documented ones

1:54:34.540 --> 1:54:39.140
 is Fadogia agrestis, that's F-A-D-O-G-I-A,

1:54:39.140 --> 1:54:42.900
 separate word A-G-R-E-S-T-I-S,

1:54:42.900 --> 1:54:45.900
 which, at least according to the literature

1:54:45.900 --> 1:54:47.040
 that I was able to find,

1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:49.080
 can increase levels of luteinizing hormone

1:54:49.080 --> 1:54:52.460
 and thereby levels of testosterone or levels of estrogen.

1:54:52.460 --> 1:54:55.920
 And again, if an individual were to take Fadogia agrestis,

1:54:55.920 --> 1:54:57.500
 what they would probably find is that

1:54:57.500 --> 1:54:59.960
 testosterone and estrogen would increase

1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:03.320
 in any one of any chromosomal or gonadal background.

1:55:03.320 --> 1:55:05.020
 But remember, it's the ratio of both.

1:55:05.020 --> 1:55:08.420
 So both, if someone has low estrogen, high testosterone,

1:55:08.420 --> 1:55:10.260
 let's say they have testes just by way of example,

1:55:10.260 --> 1:55:13.320
 then both of those would be expected to increase.

1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:15.820
 And if someone has high estrogen and low testosterone,

1:55:15.820 --> 1:55:17.880
 and let's just say has ovaries,

1:55:17.880 --> 1:55:19.540
 then both of those would increase

1:55:19.540 --> 1:55:21.960
 by taking Fadogia agrestis.

1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:24.260
 The side effect profile of Fadogia agrestis

1:55:24.260 --> 1:55:27.540
 hasn't really been documented, so it's a little unclear.

1:55:27.540 --> 1:55:29.340
 I just want to emphasize

1:55:29.340 --> 1:55:32.340
 that anytime someone's going to start taking supplements

1:55:32.340 --> 1:55:34.900
 that, or modifying sex steroid hormones,

1:55:34.900 --> 1:55:37.900
 getting blood work done is extremely important

1:55:38.740 --> 1:55:39.660
 for safety reasons,

1:55:39.660 --> 1:55:42.100
 and also just to know whether or not things are working.

1:55:42.100 --> 1:55:43.860
 And because all of these things

1:55:43.860 --> 1:55:45.860
 are subject to negative feedback,

1:55:45.860 --> 1:55:47.640
 talked about this previously,

1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:48.700
 previous episode,

1:55:48.700 --> 1:55:51.580
 but if testosterone goes high or too high,

1:55:51.580 --> 1:55:54.320
 it can feed back and shut down luteinizing hormone,

1:55:54.320 --> 1:55:57.200
 which will then shut down for the testosterone production.

1:55:57.200 --> 1:55:59.580
 Likewise, if estrogens are going too high

1:55:59.580 --> 1:56:02.140
 or they're going too high at various phases of the cycle,

1:56:02.140 --> 1:56:05.460
 that can start to throw off various other hormones,

1:56:05.460 --> 1:56:09.900
 including FSH, progesterone, LH.

1:56:09.900 --> 1:56:11.140
 The menstrual cycle itself

1:56:11.140 --> 1:56:13.820
 is a just absolutely exquisite balance

1:56:13.820 --> 1:56:17.500
 of feedback of luteinizing hormone kept low and constant,

1:56:17.500 --> 1:56:19.820
 at least for the first 14 days of the cycle.

1:56:19.820 --> 1:56:21.340
 Then mid-cycle, there's a peak,

1:56:21.340 --> 1:56:24.180
 and that's typically when ovulation occurs.

1:56:24.180 --> 1:56:25.940
 That's why pregnancy is most likely

1:56:25.940 --> 1:56:28.120
 during the middle of the 28-day cycle.

1:56:28.120 --> 1:56:33.120
 FSH kind of goes up and then down across the first 14 days.

1:56:33.120 --> 1:56:37.160
 So taking anything or really modifying one's estrogens

1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:40.380
 or testosterone on that background of the menstrual cycle

1:56:40.380 --> 1:56:42.780
 is really going to disrupt the way those things interact,

1:56:42.780 --> 1:56:45.100
 and it's just such an exquisite feedback loop.

1:56:45.100 --> 1:56:48.180
 So I'm not saying don't do that,

1:56:48.180 --> 1:56:50.860
 but you definitely want to be aware of what you're doing,

1:56:50.860 --> 1:56:52.860
 and blood draws are one way to do that.

1:56:52.860 --> 1:56:55.780
 Monitoring cycles for ovulating females

1:56:55.780 --> 1:56:56.700
 is another way to do that.

1:56:56.700 --> 1:56:58.900
 And in males, having a good window

1:56:58.900 --> 1:57:00.620
 into what's going on with testosterone,

1:57:00.620 --> 1:57:05.620
 DHT, aromatase, estradiol, LH, et cetera, is just vital.

1:57:06.460 --> 1:57:09.020
 And it's really part and parcel

1:57:09.020 --> 1:57:11.440
 with the practice of thinking about optimizing

1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:13.940
 these incredible things that we call sex steroid hormones,

1:57:13.940 --> 1:57:16.340
 estrogen, and testosterone, and their derivatives.

1:57:16.340 --> 1:57:18.580
 The list of supplements and molecules

1:57:18.580 --> 1:57:22.220
 that can adjust estrogen and testosterone is vast,

1:57:22.220 --> 1:57:23.820
 and I only touched on a few of these.

1:57:23.820 --> 1:57:26.000
 I really tried to emphasize the ones

1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:29.280
 for which there are human studies

1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:32.640
 or that have mostly human studies,

1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:34.300
 or maybe even just one human study.

1:57:34.300 --> 1:57:36.680
 There are other things out there

1:57:36.680 --> 1:57:38.140
 for which there are scientific data,

1:57:38.140 --> 1:57:39.740
 things like bulbine natalensis,

1:57:39.740 --> 1:57:42.940
 which definitely has support for increasing testosterone,

1:57:42.940 --> 1:57:45.180
 but all the studies were in rats.

1:57:45.180 --> 1:57:46.780
 I think there is some evidence in humans,

1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:48.660
 but the evidence mainly comes in the form

1:57:48.660 --> 1:57:50.660
 of what we call sponsored research,

1:57:50.660 --> 1:57:52.780
 so companies paying for research,

1:57:52.780 --> 1:57:54.860
 which is different than independent research

1:57:54.860 --> 1:57:58.340
 by people who are not biased in terms of the outcome.

1:57:58.340 --> 1:58:00.060
 And the reason I didn't throw out things

1:58:00.060 --> 1:58:04.100
 like bulbine natalensis is they seem to have liver toxicity

1:58:04.100 --> 1:58:08.220
 similar to high levels of anabolic exogenous steroids.

1:58:08.220 --> 1:58:10.560
 There's some problems associated with them

1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:14.720
 that make them important to think about

1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:18.340
 if you're curious about this area and the endocrinology,

1:58:18.340 --> 1:58:21.380
 but also somewhat precarious.

1:58:21.380 --> 1:58:23.720
 And that's one category,

1:58:23.720 --> 1:58:26.060
 so stuff that doesn't have a lot of evidence in humans

1:58:26.060 --> 1:58:27.580
 might actually be dangerous.

1:58:28.580 --> 1:58:32.740
 The other category of things that has been shown to improve

1:58:32.740 --> 1:58:35.060
 or levels of, or increase, I should say,

1:58:35.060 --> 1:58:36.980
 I don't want to say improve because it's up to you

1:58:36.980 --> 1:58:37.860
 whether or not you want to increase

1:58:37.860 --> 1:58:39.660
 or decrease estrogen and testosterone.

1:58:39.660 --> 1:58:41.820
 That's highly individual, how could I know,

1:58:41.820 --> 1:58:43.760
 are the things that are kind of housekeeping

1:58:43.760 --> 1:58:45.820
 for production of estrogen and testosterone,

1:58:45.820 --> 1:58:50.080
 things like magnesium, things like D3, things like zinc.

1:58:50.080 --> 1:58:53.100
 Those are the things that are going to create

1:58:53.100 --> 1:58:56.220
 an overall milieu of opportunity

1:58:56.220 --> 1:58:58.420
 to produce normal endogenous levels

1:58:58.420 --> 1:59:01.820
 rather than increasing endogenous levels further.

1:59:01.820 --> 1:59:04.220
 And so I really want to highlight that there's a difference

1:59:04.220 --> 1:59:07.260
 between taking something to create a kind of backdrop

1:59:07.260 --> 1:59:09.400
 of general support and taking something

1:59:09.400 --> 1:59:11.740
 that's going to create a big inflection

1:59:11.740 --> 1:59:14.040
 in the levels of a given hormone.

1:59:14.040 --> 1:59:17.300
 So once again, we covered a tremendous amount of information.

1:59:17.300 --> 1:59:20.660
 We covered some basic science of hormones and pheromones,

1:59:20.660 --> 1:59:23.340
 estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives.

1:59:23.340 --> 1:59:26.400
 We talked about supplementation and behaviors,

1:59:26.400 --> 1:59:28.220
 competition and parenting,

1:59:28.220 --> 1:59:30.280
 and how all these things interact.

1:59:30.280 --> 1:59:32.540
 And I hope that you'll come away from this

1:59:32.540 --> 1:59:34.620
 with a deeper mechanistic understanding

1:59:34.620 --> 1:59:37.500
 of how the brain and body are interacting

1:59:37.500 --> 1:59:41.100
 to control the output and the ways

1:59:41.100 --> 1:59:42.700
 in which these incredible things

1:59:42.700 --> 1:59:45.940
 that we call sex steroid hormones work and influence us.

1:59:45.940 --> 1:59:47.600
 I hope you'll also come away with some ideas

1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:48.860
 of things that you can do

1:59:48.860 --> 1:59:52.460
 in particular behavioral practices that can improve sleep

1:59:52.460 --> 1:59:54.740
 and your relationship to light, et cetera,

1:59:54.740 --> 1:59:57.820
 because those things really set the foundation

1:59:57.820 --> 2:00:01.560
 not just for healthy steroid hormone output,

2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:04.660
 but for all sorts of health effects

2:00:04.660 --> 2:00:07.980
 and for both the psychology and the biology

2:00:07.980 --> 2:00:09.940
 of your nervous system.

2:00:09.940 --> 2:00:11.980
 So I'm sure there'll be many questions.

2:00:11.980 --> 2:00:14.660
 There are many things that I couldn't get to today.

2:00:14.660 --> 2:00:17.000
 I do try and limit these episodes to about 90 minutes,

2:00:17.000 --> 2:00:20.800
 which is the optimal ultradian cycle for learning.

2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:21.740
 It's a lot of information,

2:00:21.740 --> 2:00:23.380
 but we've timestamped everything for you.

2:00:23.380 --> 2:00:27.280
 So feel free to look over it in parts or circle back

2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:29.500
 where you might want deeper understanding.

2:00:29.500 --> 2:00:32.660
 And please put your questions in the comment section below.

2:00:32.660 --> 2:00:35.340
 Please put suggestions for future episodes

2:00:35.340 --> 2:00:36.920
 and things that relate to hormones

2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:38.560
 in the comment section below.

2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:40.260
 We do look at those and we do use them

2:00:40.260 --> 2:00:43.540
 to inform the content for subsequent episodes.

2:00:43.540 --> 2:00:45.860

 Please also inform your friends, family, coworkers,

2:01:01.220 --> 2:01:02.900
 anyone that you think might also benefit

2:01:02.900 --> 2:01:04.600
 from the information that we're covering.

2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:06.540
 That really helps us grow our audience

2:01:06.540 --> 2:01:08.980
 and bring more information to you.

2:01:08.980 --> 2:01:11.120
 As well, please check out our sponsors

2:01:11.120 --> 2:01:13.340
 mentioned at the beginning of each episode.

2:01:13.340 --> 2:01:15.180
 And we also have a Patreon.

2:01:15.180 --> 2:01:18.820
 That's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

2:01:18.820 --> 2:01:20.980
 At the Patreon, you can help support the podcast

2:01:20.980 --> 2:01:23.040
 at any level that you like.

2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:27.820
 As well, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:01:27.820 --> 2:01:29.260
 which is a supplement company.

2:01:29.260 --> 2:01:30.540
 The reason we partnered with Thorne

2:01:30.540 --> 2:01:32.580
 is that they have the highest levels of stringency

2:01:32.580 --> 2:01:35.580
 in terms of the quality of the supplements that they make

2:01:35.580 --> 2:01:37.760
 and the quantity of the individual ingredients.

2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:40.100
 Some things that's not always the case

2:01:40.100 --> 2:01:41.580
 with various supplement companies,

2:01:41.580 --> 2:01:43.620
 but Thorne is exquisitely good

2:01:43.620 --> 2:01:45.420
 about the stringency of their products.

2:01:45.420 --> 2:01:46.860
 They partner with the Mayo Clinic

2:01:46.860 --> 2:01:48.840
 and all the major sports teams.

2:01:48.840 --> 2:01:50.020
 If you want to check out Thorne

2:01:50.020 --> 2:01:51.580
 and see the supplements that I take,

2:01:51.580 --> 2:01:56.140
 you can go to thorne.com slash you slash Huberman.

2:01:56.140 --> 2:01:58.340
 And if you do that, you can see the supplements I take,

2:01:58.340 --> 2:02:00.980
 but as well, it'll allow you to get 20% off

2:02:00.980 --> 2:02:01.980
 any of those supplements

2:02:01.980 --> 2:02:04.660
 or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

2:02:04.660 --> 2:02:08.540
 That's thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E dot com

2:02:08.540 --> 2:02:11.420
 slash the letter U slash Huberman

2:02:11.420 --> 2:02:14.180
 to get 20% off any Thorne supplements.

2:02:14.180 --> 2:02:16.540
 In closing, I hope you'll leave today's episode

2:02:16.540 --> 2:02:19.260
 with a much richer understanding of the mechanisms

2:02:19.260 --> 2:02:21.340
 that control the endocrine and nervous system

2:02:21.340 --> 2:02:24.060
 in the context of estrogen and testosterone,

2:02:24.060 --> 2:02:26.020
 as well as take away various tools

2:02:26.020 --> 2:02:28.140
 that you might choose to apply.

2:02:28.140 --> 2:02:31.260
 And next week, we'll be back with another episode

2:02:31.260 --> 2:02:32.620
 about the role of hormones

2:02:32.620 --> 2:02:35.820
 and its important interactions with the nervous system.

2:02:35.820 --> 2:02:36.740
 And that will, of course,

2:02:36.740 --> 2:02:39.680
 include both mechanisms and tools as well.

2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:42.380
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.

2:02:42.380 --> 2:02:58.380
 And as always, thank you for your interest in science.
