00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.220 --> 00:11.660
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:11.660 --> 00:14.780
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.780 --> 00:18.180
 Today, we're going to talk about the neuroscience of fear.

00:18.180 --> 00:20.460
 We are also going to talk about trauma

00:20.460 --> 00:23.380
 and post-traumatic stress disorders.

00:23.380 --> 00:27.060
 The neuroscience of fear has a long history in biology

00:27.060 --> 00:29.540
 and in the field of psychology.

00:29.540 --> 00:33.420
 However, I think it's fair to say that in the last 10 years,

00:33.420 --> 00:35.220
 the field of neuroscience has shed light

00:35.220 --> 00:37.420
 on not just the neural circuits,

00:37.420 --> 00:39.540
 meaning the areas of the brain

00:39.540 --> 00:43.060
 that control the fear response and the ways that it does it,

00:43.060 --> 00:46.060
 but some important ways to extinguish fears

00:46.060 --> 00:48.780
 using behavioral therapies, drug therapies,

00:48.780 --> 00:51.300
 and what we call brain-machine interfaces.

00:51.300 --> 00:53.660
 Today, we are going to talk about all of those,

00:53.660 --> 00:55.140
 and you are going to come away

00:55.140 --> 00:57.800
 with both an understanding of the biology of fear

00:57.800 --> 01:00.880
 and trauma, as well as many practical tools

01:00.880 --> 01:03.380
 to confront fear and trauma.

01:03.380 --> 01:04.820
 In fact, we are going to discuss

01:04.820 --> 01:07.420
 one very recently published study

01:07.420 --> 01:12.420
 in which five minutes a day of deliberate exposure to stress

01:12.580 --> 01:16.000
 was shown to alleviate longstanding depressive

01:16.000 --> 01:17.940
 and fear-related symptoms.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.780
 We will get into the details of that study

01:19.780 --> 01:22.100
 and the protocol that emerges from that study

01:22.100 --> 01:23.940
 a little later in the podcast,

01:23.940 --> 01:25.960
 but it stands as a really important,

01:25.960 --> 01:28.340
 somewhat counterintuitive example

01:28.340 --> 01:32.420
 of how stress itself can be used to combat fear.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.520
 To give you a sense of where we are going,

01:34.520 --> 01:37.160
 I'll just lay out the framework for today's podcast.

01:37.160 --> 01:38.620
 First, I'm going to teach you

01:38.620 --> 01:41.300
 about the biology of fear and trauma,

01:41.300 --> 01:44.700
 literally the cells and circuits and connections in the body

01:44.700 --> 01:46.420
 and chemicals in the body

01:46.420 --> 01:49.340
 that give rise to the so-called fear response,

01:49.340 --> 01:52.020
 and why sometimes, but not always,

01:52.020 --> 01:54.360
 fear can turn into trauma.

01:54.360 --> 01:58.240
 I will also describe the biology of how fear is unlearned,

01:58.240 --> 02:00.060
 or what we call extinguished,

02:00.060 --> 02:03.680
 and there too, you're going to get some serious surprises.

02:03.680 --> 02:04.920
 You're going to learn, for instance,

02:04.920 --> 02:06.800
 that we can't just eliminate fears,

02:06.800 --> 02:10.660
 we actually have to replace fears with a new positive event.

02:10.660 --> 02:12.980
 And again, there are tools with which to do that,

02:12.980 --> 02:14.940
 and I will teach you those tools today.

02:14.940 --> 02:17.640
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

02:17.640 --> 02:20.580
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

02:20.580 --> 02:22.500
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:22.500 --> 02:25.100
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

02:25.100 --> 02:27.840
 and science-related tools to the general public.

02:27.840 --> 02:28.860
 In keeping with that theme,

02:28.860 --> 02:31.620
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:31.620 --> 02:33.880
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.500
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

02:35.500 --> 02:37.900
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

02:37.900 --> 02:41.140
 I've been taking Athletic Greens every day since 2012,

02:41.140 --> 02:43.540
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

02:43.540 --> 02:45.340
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,

02:45.340 --> 02:47.280
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens,

02:47.280 --> 02:49.360
 is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral

02:49.360 --> 02:51.100
 and probiotic needs.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.180
 Nowadays, there's a lot of data out there

02:53.180 --> 02:55.860
 pointing to the fact that a healthy gut microbiome,

02:55.860 --> 02:57.900
 literally little microbes that live in our gut

02:57.900 --> 02:58.980
 that are good for us,

02:58.980 --> 03:01.280
 is important to support our immune system,

03:01.280 --> 03:03.260
 our nervous system, our endocrine system,

03:03.260 --> 03:06.560
 and various aspects of our immediate and long-term health.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.400
 With Athletic Greens,

03:07.400 --> 03:09.420
 I get all the vitamins and minerals that I need,

03:09.420 --> 03:13.160
 plus the probiotics ensure a healthy gut microbiome.

03:13.160 --> 03:14.260
 It also tastes really good.

03:14.260 --> 03:16.540
 I mix mine up with some water, a little bit of lemon juice.

03:16.540 --> 03:17.860
 I'll have that early in the day,

03:17.860 --> 03:20.340
 and sometimes a second time later in the day as well.

03:20.340 --> 03:22.220
 It's compatible with intermittent fasting.

03:22.220 --> 03:25.580
 It's compatible with vegan diets, with keto diets,

03:25.580 --> 03:26.740
 and essentially every diet

03:26.740 --> 03:29.480
 that you could possibly imagine out there.

03:29.480 --> 03:31.800
 It's also filled with adaptogens for recovery.

03:31.800 --> 03:33.660
 It has digestive enzymes for gut health,

03:33.660 --> 03:34.740
 and it has a number of other things

03:34.740 --> 03:37.140
 that support the immune system.

03:37.140 --> 03:38.520
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

03:38.520 --> 03:41.060
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

03:41.060 --> 03:42.580
 to claim their special offer.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.080
 They'll give you five free travel packs

03:44.080 --> 03:45.960
 that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

03:45.960 --> 03:47.060
 while you're on the road,

03:47.060 --> 03:50.580
 and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

03:50.580 --> 03:53.420
 There's now a lot of evidence that vitamin D3

03:53.420 --> 03:57.140
 supports a huge number of metabolic factors,

03:57.140 --> 03:59.260
 immune system factors, endocrine factors.

03:59.260 --> 04:00.980
 Basically, we need vitamin D3.

04:00.980 --> 04:02.320
 We can get it from the sun,

04:02.320 --> 04:04.820
 but many people are deficient in vitamin D3

04:04.820 --> 04:06.020
 even if they are getting

04:06.020 --> 04:07.940
 what they think is sufficient sunlight.

04:07.940 --> 04:10.340
 And K2 is important for cardiovascular health.

04:10.340 --> 04:13.240
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

04:13.240 --> 04:14.780
 you can claim their special offer,

04:14.780 --> 04:15.940
 the five free travel packs,

04:15.940 --> 04:18.780
 plus the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

04:18.780 --> 04:21.980
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

04:21.980 --> 04:24.480
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:24.480 --> 04:26.900
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

04:26.900 --> 04:28.440
 to help you better understand your body

04:28.440 --> 04:30.340
 and help you reach your health goals.

04:30.340 --> 04:31.500
 I've long been a believer

04:31.500 --> 04:33.280
 in getting regular blood work done

04:33.280 --> 04:35.860
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

04:35.860 --> 04:38.180
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

04:38.180 --> 04:40.740
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.220
 And now with the advent of modern DNA tests,

04:43.220 --> 04:44.420
 you can also get information

04:44.420 --> 04:46.500
 about how your specific genes are impacting

04:46.500 --> 04:48.360
 your immediate and long-term health.

04:48.360 --> 04:49.860
 Now, a problem with a lot of blood tests

04:49.860 --> 04:52.320
 and DNA tests out there is you get the numbers back,

04:52.320 --> 04:54.340
 but you don't know what to do with those numbers.

04:54.340 --> 04:57.020
 With Inside Tracker, they make it very simple

04:57.020 --> 04:59.260
 to figure out what to do to bring those numbers

04:59.260 --> 05:01.180
 into the ranges that are right for you.

05:01.180 --> 05:03.940
 They have a dashboard that's very easy to use.

05:03.940 --> 05:07.420
 You can see the numbers from your blood and or DNA tests,

05:07.420 --> 05:10.060
 and it will point to specific lifestyle factors,

05:10.060 --> 05:12.900
 nutritional factors, as well as supplementation,

05:12.900 --> 05:15.140
 maybe even prescription factors that would be right

05:15.140 --> 05:17.020
 for you to bring the numbers into range

05:17.020 --> 05:18.500
 that are ideal for your immediate

05:18.500 --> 05:19.980
 and long-term health goals.

05:19.980 --> 05:21.660
 Another feature that Inside Tracker has

05:21.660 --> 05:23.540
 is their inner age test.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.820
 This test shows you what your biological age is

05:25.820 --> 05:28.140
 and compares that to your chronological age

05:28.140 --> 05:30.840
 and what you can do to improve your biological age,

05:30.840 --> 05:32.740
 which of course is the important number.

05:32.740 --> 05:34.100
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

05:34.100 --> 05:36.720
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:41.680 --> 05:44.540
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

05:44.540 --> 05:46.580
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

05:46.580 --> 05:49.180
 that are of the absolute highest quality.

05:49.180 --> 05:50.680
 I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress

05:50.680 --> 05:52.120
 for close to a year now,

05:52.120 --> 05:54.220
 and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.

05:54.220 --> 05:56.980
 Helix has a quiz that takes about two minutes to complete

05:56.980 --> 05:59.760
 and matches your body type and sleep preferences

05:59.760 --> 06:01.580
 to the perfect mattress for you.

06:01.580 --> 06:02.800
 Some people sleep on their side,

06:02.800 --> 06:03.860
 some people sleep on their back,

06:03.860 --> 06:05.180
 some people sleep on their stomach,

06:05.180 --> 06:07.140
 some people run hot, some people run cold,

06:07.140 --> 06:09.180
 some people don't know which part of their body

06:09.180 --> 06:10.380
 they sleep on.

06:10.380 --> 06:12.780
 You take this test, it's very brief, two minutes,

06:12.780 --> 06:15.240
 and after that test, Helix will match you

06:15.240 --> 06:17.160
 to the mattress that's ideal for you.

06:17.160 --> 06:20.000
 I matched to the so-called DUSK mattress

06:20.000 --> 06:22.160
 because I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm,

06:22.160 --> 06:24.400
 not too soft, and I like to sleep kind of,

06:24.400 --> 06:25.240
 sort of on my stomach

06:25.240 --> 06:27.220
 in kind of a crawling soldier position.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.620
 I just, that seems to be always how I wake up

06:29.620 --> 06:30.920
 in the morning anyway.

06:30.920 --> 06:32.660
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

06:32.660 --> 06:34.980
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

06:34.980 --> 06:36.260
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

06:36.260 --> 06:38.020
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress,

06:38.020 --> 06:41.420
 and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders,

06:41.420 --> 06:43.240
 and you'll get two free pillows.

06:43.240 --> 06:44.460
 Again, if you're interested,

06:44.460 --> 06:46.820
 please go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

06:46.820 --> 06:49.740
 for up to $200 off and two free pillows.

06:49.740 --> 06:51.640
 So what is fear?

06:51.640 --> 06:55.960
 Well, fear falls into a category of nervous system phenomenon

06:55.960 --> 06:59.620
 that we can reliably call an emotion,

06:59.620 --> 07:01.980
 and it is hotly debated nowadays,

07:01.980 --> 07:05.500
 and it's been hotly debated really for centuries

07:05.500 --> 07:08.780
 what an emotion is and what an emotion isn't.

07:08.780 --> 07:12.100
 Now, that's not a debate that I want to get into today.

07:12.100 --> 07:16.160
 I think it's fair to say that emotions include responses

07:16.160 --> 07:18.680
 within our body, quickening of heart rate,

07:18.680 --> 07:20.260
 changes in blood flow,

07:20.260 --> 07:22.020
 things that we experience as a warming

07:22.020 --> 07:23.540
 or a cooling of our skin,

07:23.540 --> 07:25.860
 but that there's also a cognitive component.

07:25.860 --> 07:28.020
 There are thoughts, there are memories.

07:28.020 --> 07:30.260
 There's all sorts of stuff that goes on in our mind

07:30.260 --> 07:34.820
 and in our body that together we call an emotion,

07:34.820 --> 07:36.780
 and there's a vast amount of interest

07:36.780 --> 07:39.340
 and literature devoted to trying to understand

07:39.340 --> 07:41.040
 how many different emotions there are,

07:41.040 --> 07:43.380
 how different people experience emotions,

07:43.380 --> 07:45.940
 and that's certainly a topic that we will embrace

07:45.940 --> 07:47.840
 in a future podcast episode.

07:47.840 --> 07:52.040
 But today, I just want to talk about fear as a response,

07:52.040 --> 07:55.720
 because when we talk about fear as a physiological response

07:55.720 --> 07:57.720
 and as a cognitive response,

07:57.720 --> 08:00.880
 then we can get down to some very concrete mechanisms

08:00.880 --> 08:04.060
 and some very concrete and practical tools

08:04.060 --> 08:08.780
 that can be used to deal with fear when fear is not wanted.

08:08.780 --> 08:12.800
 So let's talk first about what fear isn't.

08:14.580 --> 08:16.780
 Most people are familiar with stress,

08:16.780 --> 08:19.900
 both as a concept and as an experience.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.500
 Stress is a physiological response.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.360
 It involves quickening of the heart rate,

08:24.360 --> 08:26.680
 typically quickening of breathing,

08:26.680 --> 08:28.540
 blood flow getting shuttled to certain areas

08:28.540 --> 08:30.800
 of the brain and body and not to others.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.100
 It can create a hypervigilance or an awareness.

08:33.100 --> 08:36.300
 Typically, that awareness is narrower,

08:36.300 --> 08:38.120
 literally narrower in space,

08:38.120 --> 08:40.000
 like a soda straw view of the world,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.260
 than when we are relaxed.

08:42.260 --> 08:45.700
 And it is fair to say that we cannot have fear

08:45.700 --> 08:49.540
 without having several, if not all of the elements

08:49.540 --> 08:51.100
 of the stress response.

08:51.100 --> 08:54.180
 However, we can have stress without having fear.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.240
 Likewise, people are familiar with the phrase,

08:58.240 --> 09:00.460
 or the word, rather, anxiety.

09:00.460 --> 09:04.640
 Anxiety tends to be stress about some future event,

09:04.640 --> 09:07.500
 although it can mean other things as well.

09:07.500 --> 09:11.420
 We can't really have fear without seeing or observing

09:11.420 --> 09:14.340
 or experiencing some of the elements of anxiety,

09:14.340 --> 09:17.160
 but we can have anxiety without having fear.

09:18.000 --> 09:21.260
 So what you're starting to realize is that fear is built up

09:21.260 --> 09:25.540
 from certain basic elements that include stress and anxiety.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.660
 And then there is trauma.

09:27.660 --> 09:31.340
 And trauma also requires a specific,

09:31.340 --> 09:33.060
 what we will call operational definition.

09:33.060 --> 09:35.140
 An operational definition is just a definition

09:35.140 --> 09:36.780
 that allows us to have a conversation

09:36.780 --> 09:40.000
 because we both agree on, or mostly agree on,

09:40.000 --> 09:42.140
 what the meaning of a given word is.

09:42.140 --> 09:43.780
 It makes conversations much easier.

09:43.780 --> 09:44.860
 In fact, I would argue,

09:44.860 --> 09:47.100
 if we all had operational definitions

09:47.100 --> 09:48.540
 for more things in the world,

09:48.540 --> 09:51.080
 that there would be fewer misunderstandings and arguments,

09:51.080 --> 09:53.380
 and we'd all move a lot further as a species.

09:53.380 --> 09:55.860
 But that's another topic entirely.

09:55.860 --> 09:58.580
 The operational definition of trauma

09:58.580 --> 10:02.980
 is that some fear took place,

10:02.980 --> 10:05.500
 which of course includes stress and anxiety,

10:05.500 --> 10:08.800
 and that fear somehow gets embedded

10:08.800 --> 10:10.700
 or activated in our nervous system

10:10.700 --> 10:15.120
 such that it shows up at times when it's maladaptive,

10:15.120 --> 10:17.100
 meaning that fear doesn't serve us well,

10:17.100 --> 10:19.940
 and it gets reactivated at various times.

10:19.940 --> 10:21.980
 Like when you first wake up in the morning,

10:21.980 --> 10:25.120
 if you're not in the presence of something that scared you,

10:25.120 --> 10:27.820
 but you suddenly have what feels like a panic attack

10:27.820 --> 10:29.260
 and you're in deep fear,

10:29.260 --> 10:31.940
 well, that's post-traumatic stress.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.980
 That's post-traumatic fear.

10:33.980 --> 10:35.460
 So I don't want to get bogged down

10:35.460 --> 10:36.940
 too much in the nomenclature,

10:36.940 --> 10:39.000
 but what I'm doing here is building up

10:39.000 --> 10:40.980
 a sort of a series of layers

10:40.980 --> 10:43.340
 where stress and anxiety form the foundation

10:43.340 --> 10:45.380
 of what we're calling fear and trauma.

10:45.380 --> 10:47.820
 And then there are other phrases out there

10:47.820 --> 10:50.740
 that we would be remiss if we didn't mention

10:50.740 --> 10:53.180
 things like phobias and panic attacks.

10:53.180 --> 10:55.940
 Panic attacks are the experience of extreme fear,

10:55.940 --> 10:58.040
 but without any fear-inducing stimulus.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.980
 So it's kind of like trauma.

10:59.980 --> 11:03.000
 And a phobia tends to be extreme fear

11:04.000 --> 11:06.500
 of something specific, fear of spiders,

11:06.500 --> 11:09.480
 fear of heights, fear of flying, fear of dying,

11:09.480 --> 11:11.640
 these kinds of things, okay?

11:11.640 --> 11:12.980
 The reason for laying all that out there

11:12.980 --> 11:15.160
 is not to create a word soup to confuse us.

11:15.160 --> 11:16.980
 Rather, it is to simplify the issue

11:16.980 --> 11:18.820
 because now that we acknowledge

11:18.820 --> 11:20.340
 that there are many different phrases

11:20.340 --> 11:22.100
 to describe this thing that we call fear

11:22.100 --> 11:24.020
 and then related phenomenon,

11:24.020 --> 11:26.960
 we can start to just focus on two of these issues,

11:26.960 --> 11:29.260
 fear and trauma, as it relates

11:29.260 --> 11:31.700
 to specific biological processes,

11:31.700 --> 11:33.860
 specific cognitive processes,

11:33.860 --> 11:37.100
 and we can start to dissect how fears are formed,

11:37.100 --> 11:39.300
 how fears are unformed,

11:39.300 --> 11:41.260
 and how new memories can come

11:41.260 --> 11:44.920
 to replace previously fearful experiences.

11:44.920 --> 11:47.100
 So in this effort to establish a common language

11:47.100 --> 11:48.960
 around fear and trauma,

11:48.960 --> 11:52.140
 I want to point out autonomic arousal.

11:52.140 --> 11:55.540
 Autonomic arousal relates to this aspect

11:55.540 --> 11:56.460
 of our nervous system

11:56.460 --> 11:58.120
 that we call the autonomic nervous system.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.060
 Autonomic means automatic.

12:00.060 --> 12:01.260
 That's somewhat of a misnomer

12:01.260 --> 12:03.500
 because there are aspects of your autonomic nervous system

12:03.500 --> 12:04.820
 that you can control,

12:04.820 --> 12:06.220
 but your autonomic nervous system

12:06.220 --> 12:08.380
 controls things like digestion,

12:08.380 --> 12:12.360
 urination, sexual behavior, stress.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.420
 When you want to be awake,

12:13.420 --> 12:14.780
 when you want to be asleep,

12:14.780 --> 12:17.180
 it basically has two branches to it,

12:17.180 --> 12:20.200
 two branches meaning two different systems.

12:20.200 --> 12:23.420
 One is the so-called sympathetic autonomic nervous system.

12:23.420 --> 12:24.780
 It has nothing to do with sympathy.

12:24.780 --> 12:27.420
 It has everything to do with increasing alertness.

12:27.420 --> 12:29.460
 Think of the sympathetic nervous system

12:29.460 --> 12:32.000
 as the alertness nervous system.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.420
 It's what ramps up your levels of alertness,

12:34.420 --> 12:35.940
 ramps up your levels of vigilance.

12:35.940 --> 12:37.860
 Think about it as the accelerator

12:37.860 --> 12:39.640
 on your alertness and attention.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.060
 The other branch of the autonomic nervous system

12:43.060 --> 12:46.220
 is the so-called parasympathetic branch

12:46.220 --> 12:47.460
 of the autonomic nervous system.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.020
 I know that's a mouthful.

12:49.020 --> 12:51.800
 The parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system

12:51.800 --> 12:54.940
 are the cells and neurons and chemicals

12:54.940 --> 12:57.120
 and other aspects of your brain and body

12:57.120 --> 12:59.280
 that are involved in the calming nervous system.

12:59.280 --> 13:02.540
 So sympathetic is alerting, parasympathetic is calming,

13:02.540 --> 13:04.420
 and it acts as sort of a seesaw

13:04.420 --> 13:06.620
 to adjust your overall level of alertness.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.580
 So for instance, right now I'm alert,

13:08.580 --> 13:10.100
 but I feel pretty calm.

13:10.100 --> 13:11.900
 I'm not ready to go to sleep or anything like that.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.140
 I don't feel like I need a nap.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.700
 I'm alert, but I'm calm.

13:14.700 --> 13:16.540
 I'm not in a state of stress or panic.

13:16.540 --> 13:19.820
 So that seesaw we could imagine is more or less level.

13:19.820 --> 13:21.780
 Maybe it's tilted up a little bit

13:21.780 --> 13:25.560
 to the side of increased sympathetic or alertness

13:25.560 --> 13:28.380
 rather than parasympathetic because I feel wide awake.

13:28.380 --> 13:30.160
 If I were sleepy, the opposite would be true.

13:30.160 --> 13:32.500
 The parasympathetic side would be increased

13:32.500 --> 13:34.140
 relative to the sympathetic side.

13:35.340 --> 13:36.500
 There are many different aspects

13:36.500 --> 13:37.700
 to the autonomic nervous system,

13:37.700 --> 13:39.740
 but one of the main aspects is an aspect

13:39.740 --> 13:42.100
 that's going to come up again and again and again today.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.020
 It's very important that you understand what it is.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.660
 It's called the HPA axis.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.140
 The HPA axis stands

13:48.140 --> 13:51.920
 for hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.060
 The hypothalamus is a collection of neurons.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.420
 It's an area of your brain, real estate,

13:57.420 --> 13:59.700
 that's deep in the brain, at the base of the brain,

13:59.700 --> 14:02.120
 that contains many, many different areas

14:02.120 --> 14:05.580
 that control things like temperature and desire to have sex,

14:05.580 --> 14:08.420
 desire to eat, thirst.

14:08.420 --> 14:12.760
 It also controls the desire to not mate, have sex,

14:12.760 --> 14:17.280
 not eat, not drink more water or any other type of fluid.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.820
 So it has accelerators and breaks in there as well.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.720
 The hypothalamus connects to the so-called pituitary.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.500
 The pituitary lives close to the roof of your mouth.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.340
 It releases hormones into your bloodstream.

14:29.340 --> 14:32.020
 And so the hypothalamus has this ability

14:32.020 --> 14:34.820
 to trigger the release or prevent the release

14:34.820 --> 14:37.900
 of particular hormones like cortisol

14:37.900 --> 14:41.100
 or the hormones that go stimulate ovaries

14:41.100 --> 14:45.060
 to produce estrogen or testes to produce testosterone

14:45.060 --> 14:48.180
 or adrenals to produce adrenaline.

14:48.180 --> 14:49.480
 And speaking of the adrenals,

14:49.480 --> 14:52.420
 that A in the HPA are the adrenals.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.800
 You have two glands that sit above your kidneys

14:54.800 --> 14:55.980
 in your lower back.

14:55.980 --> 14:59.500
 They receive signals by way of nerve cells, neurons,

14:59.500 --> 15:01.700
 and by way of hormones and other things released

15:01.700 --> 15:03.620
 from the brain and elsewhere in the body.

15:03.620 --> 15:05.940
 And they release different hormones

15:05.940 --> 15:08.620
 and other types of chemicals into the body.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.140
 And the two main ones that you need to know

15:10.140 --> 15:12.220
 about today are adrenaline,

15:12.220 --> 15:14.980
 also called epinephrine, and cortisol.

15:14.980 --> 15:17.160
 Both of those are so-called stress hormones,

15:17.160 --> 15:19.220
 but they're not always involved in stress.

15:19.220 --> 15:21.500
 They're also involved in waking up in the morning

15:21.500 --> 15:25.660
 when you, excuse me, when you rise from sleep.

15:25.660 --> 15:29.020
 And so this HPA axis should be thought of

15:29.020 --> 15:30.060
 in the following way.

15:30.060 --> 15:33.060
 The HPA axis includes a piece of the brain,

15:33.060 --> 15:36.400
 the hypothalamus, the pituitary, and the adrenal.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.920
 So it's a beautiful three-part system

15:38.920 --> 15:43.400
 that can use your brain to alert or wake up your body

15:43.400 --> 15:45.220
 and prepare it for action.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.420
 And it can do that in the short term

15:47.420 --> 15:49.900
 by triggering the release of hormones and chemicals

15:49.900 --> 15:53.220
 that make you alert and ready to go right away.

15:53.220 --> 15:56.180
 And by triggering the release of neurotransmitters

15:56.180 --> 15:57.740
 and hormones and other chemicals

15:57.740 --> 16:01.340
 that give that alertness a very long tail,

16:01.340 --> 16:04.660
 a very long latency before it shuts off.

16:04.660 --> 16:08.180
 And that's important because one of the hallmarks of fear

16:08.180 --> 16:10.520
 and one of the hallmarks of trauma

16:10.520 --> 16:14.840
 is that they involve fear responses that are long lasting.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.320
 Even if those fearful events,

16:17.320 --> 16:20.740
 the events in the world that trigger the HPA axis

16:20.740 --> 16:21.660
 can be very brief,

16:21.660 --> 16:24.860
 like a car that almost hits you as you step off the curb

16:24.860 --> 16:28.020
 or something, a gunshot that goes off suddenly,

16:28.020 --> 16:30.860
 and it's just a very quick, like 500 millisecond

16:30.860 --> 16:32.580
 or one second event,

16:32.580 --> 16:36.380
 the fear response can reverberate through your system

16:36.380 --> 16:40.260
 because the chemicals that are involved in this HPA axis

16:40.260 --> 16:44.380
 have a fast component and a longer lasting component.

16:44.380 --> 16:47.580
 And the longer lasting component can actually change

16:47.580 --> 16:51.580
 not just the connections of different areas of the brain

16:51.580 --> 16:53.020
 and the way that our organs work,

16:53.020 --> 16:55.060
 like our heart and the way that we breathe,

16:55.060 --> 16:57.700
 it actually can feed back to the brain

16:57.700 --> 17:00.420
 and literally control gene expression,

17:00.420 --> 17:03.520
 which can take many days and build out new circuits

17:03.520 --> 17:07.980
 and new chemicals that can embed fear in our brain and body.

17:07.980 --> 17:09.760
 And that might sound very depressing,

17:09.760 --> 17:11.940
 but there's a reason and there's an adaptive reason

17:11.940 --> 17:15.180
 why there's this slow and fast phase of the HPA axis

17:15.180 --> 17:16.840
 and the fear response.

17:16.840 --> 17:20.220
 And fortunately, that gene expression

17:20.220 --> 17:23.460
 and the long arc of the fear response,

17:23.460 --> 17:25.160
 the way it kind of lives in our system,

17:25.160 --> 17:28.340
 kind of like a phantom in some ways,

17:28.340 --> 17:31.560
 can also be leveraged to undo the fear response,

17:31.560 --> 17:34.280
 to extinguish the fear response and replace it

17:34.280 --> 17:37.340
 with non-fearful associations.

17:37.340 --> 17:39.740
 So let's dig a little deeper into the neural circuits

17:39.740 --> 17:42.960
 and biology of fear, because in doing that,

17:42.960 --> 17:46.620
 we can start to reveal the logic of how to attack fear

17:46.620 --> 17:47.620
 if that's the goal.

17:48.620 --> 17:50.540
 We can't really have a discussion about fear

17:50.540 --> 17:53.940
 without discussing the famous amygdala.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.100
 Famous because I think most people by now

17:56.100 --> 17:57.980
 have heard of the amygdala.

17:57.980 --> 18:01.580
 Amygdala means almond, it's an almond-shaped structure

18:01.580 --> 18:02.960
 on both sides of the brain.

18:02.960 --> 18:04.240
 So you have one on the right side of your brain

18:04.240 --> 18:06.020
 and one on the left side of your brain.

18:06.020 --> 18:09.820
 The amygdala is part of what we can call the threat reflex.

18:09.820 --> 18:12.920
 And this is very important to conceptualize fear

18:12.920 --> 18:15.140
 as including a reflex.

18:15.140 --> 18:18.100
 So much as you have reflexes that cause you

18:18.100 --> 18:21.380
 to lift your foot up if you are to step on something sharp,

18:21.380 --> 18:23.920
 you literally have a reflex within your spinal cord

18:23.920 --> 18:25.900
 that causes you to lift up one foot

18:25.900 --> 18:27.700
 and extend the other one toward the ground,

18:27.700 --> 18:28.940
 believe it or not.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.480
 You always think that you step on something sharp,

18:30.480 --> 18:31.700
 you pull your foot up,

18:31.700 --> 18:33.560
 but you actually step on something sharp,

18:33.560 --> 18:35.340
 you pull your foot up and in pulling it up,

18:35.340 --> 18:37.300
 there's another reflex that's activated

18:37.300 --> 18:39.060
 that as you extend your other leg

18:39.060 --> 18:40.980
 so that you don't fall over.

18:40.980 --> 18:45.120
 Similarly, in the process of experiencing fear,

18:45.120 --> 18:48.340
 you have a reflex for particular events

18:48.340 --> 18:49.580
 in your brain and body.

18:49.580 --> 18:51.900
 And that reflex involves things like

18:51.900 --> 18:54.380
 quickening of your heart rate, hypervigilance,

18:54.380 --> 18:57.000
 your attentional systems pop on,

18:57.000 --> 19:01.180
 increased ability to access energy stores

19:01.180 --> 19:04.060
 for movement and thought and so forth.

19:04.060 --> 19:08.380
 But just like that step on the tack reflex example,

19:08.380 --> 19:10.540
 all of the neural circuits that are associated

19:10.540 --> 19:13.820
 with being calm, with being able to go to sleep,

19:13.820 --> 19:16.880
 with being able to visualize the full picture

19:16.880 --> 19:18.420
 of your environment, literally,

19:18.420 --> 19:19.980
 to see your entire environment

19:19.980 --> 19:21.480
 or to hear other things around you,

19:21.480 --> 19:23.100
 all of those get shut down

19:23.100 --> 19:26.580
 when the so-called threat reflex gets activated.

19:26.580 --> 19:29.620
 And the amygdala is part of the threat reflex,

19:29.620 --> 19:31.340
 so much so that we can really say

19:31.340 --> 19:33.740
 that it's the final common pathway

19:33.740 --> 19:36.380
 through which the threat reflex flows.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.980
 In other words, the amygdala is essential

19:38.980 --> 19:41.020
 for the threat response.

19:41.020 --> 19:44.640
 But the threat reflex and the threat response

19:44.640 --> 19:46.140
 is kind of a dumb response.

19:46.140 --> 19:47.620
 It's not a sophisticated thing.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.980
 It's very generic.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.580
 And this is also a very important point.

19:51.580 --> 19:54.740
 One of the beauties of the fear system

19:54.740 --> 19:56.620
 is that it's very generalizable.

19:56.620 --> 20:00.300
 It's not designed for you to be afraid of any one thing.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.340
 Sure, there are some debates

20:02.340 --> 20:04.520
 and probably some good data out there

20:04.520 --> 20:08.760
 that support the fact that human babies are innately,

20:08.760 --> 20:10.180
 meaning it requires no learning,

20:10.180 --> 20:11.940
 innately afraid of certain things

20:11.940 --> 20:14.300
 like heights or snakes or spiders.

20:14.300 --> 20:15.420
 There's debate about this,

20:15.420 --> 20:19.380
 and it depends on the quality of the experiment, et cetera.

20:19.380 --> 20:22.260
 But the real capacity of the fear system

20:22.260 --> 20:24.580
 is that we can become afraid of anything

20:24.580 --> 20:27.500
 provided that this threat system is activated

20:27.500 --> 20:30.540
 in conjunction with some external experience.

20:30.540 --> 20:32.920
 So the way I'd like you to think about the amygdala

20:32.920 --> 20:34.420
 is not as a fear center,

20:34.420 --> 20:38.700
 but that it's a critical component of the threat reflex.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.760
 I'd like you to also internalize the idea

20:40.760 --> 20:42.620
 that the threat reflex involves

20:42.620 --> 20:44.380
 this activation of certain systems

20:44.380 --> 20:46.420
 and suppression of all the systems for calming,

20:46.420 --> 20:48.340
 the parasympathetic system.

20:48.340 --> 20:51.020
 And now I'm going to describe the way

20:51.020 --> 20:52.980
 that information flows into

20:52.980 --> 20:54.980
 and through this threat reflex.

20:54.980 --> 20:58.260
 And in doing that, it will reveal how specific things,

20:58.260 --> 21:00.860
 like a spider, like a snake, like a physical trauma,

21:00.860 --> 21:03.880
 like a car accident, like a fear of public speaking,

21:03.880 --> 21:08.060
 whatever happens to scare you or scare somebody,

21:08.060 --> 21:11.740
 how that gets attached to this reflex.

21:11.740 --> 21:14.140
 Because this reflex is very generic.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.180
 It doesn't really know what to be afraid of.

21:17.180 --> 21:19.480
 It only knows how to create the sensation,

21:19.480 --> 21:22.820
 this internal landscape that we think of as fear.

21:22.820 --> 21:25.920
 So while the amygdala might look like an almond,

21:25.920 --> 21:28.420
 it's actually part of a much bigger complex

21:28.420 --> 21:32.700
 or collection of neurons called the amygdaloid complex.

21:32.700 --> 21:36.740
 That complex has anywhere from 12 to 14 areas,

21:36.740 --> 21:39.740
 depending on which neuroanatomist is naming things

21:39.740 --> 21:41.020
 and carving it up.

21:41.020 --> 21:43.480
 In neuroscience and in much of biology,

21:43.480 --> 21:44.960
 we like to joke that there are lumpers

21:44.960 --> 21:45.960
 and there are splitters.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.500
 So some people like to draw boundaries

21:47.500 --> 21:49.540
 between every little distinct difference

21:49.540 --> 21:50.900
 and say, oh, that's a separate area

21:50.900 --> 21:51.900
 and other people are lumpers.

21:51.900 --> 21:54.180
 And they say, well, listen, why complicate things?

21:54.180 --> 21:55.540
 Let's lump those together.

21:55.540 --> 21:58.060
 I'm neither a lumper nor a splitter.

21:58.060 --> 21:59.460
 I'm somewhere in between.

21:59.460 --> 22:02.380
 I think the number 12 is a good number

22:02.380 --> 22:04.860
 in terms of the number of different areas of the amygdala.

22:04.860 --> 22:06.320
 Why is that important to us?

22:06.320 --> 22:08.460
 Well, it turns out that the amygdala

22:08.460 --> 22:10.740
 is not just a area for threat.

22:10.740 --> 22:13.460
 It's an area for generating threat reflexes

22:13.460 --> 22:16.760
 that integrates lots of different types of information.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.940
 So for those of you that want to know,

22:18.940 --> 22:20.980
 I'm going to give you some names, some nomenclature.

22:20.980 --> 22:21.820
 For those of you that don't,

22:21.820 --> 22:22.740
 you can tune out for this,

22:22.740 --> 22:26.400
 but basically information from our memory systems,

22:26.400 --> 22:29.460
 like the hippocampus and from our sensory systems,

22:29.460 --> 22:32.980
 our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth, et cetera.

22:32.980 --> 22:36.260
 So taste information, vision, auditory information,

22:36.260 --> 22:39.880
 touch, et cetera, flow into the so-called lateral portion

22:39.880 --> 22:43.080
 of the amygdala or the amygdala complex.

22:43.080 --> 22:44.700
 It flows into the lateral portion

22:44.700 --> 22:47.180
 and then there are multiple outputs from the amygdala.

22:47.180 --> 22:49.660
 And this is where things get particularly interesting

22:49.660 --> 22:51.640
 because the outputs of the amygdala

22:51.640 --> 22:52.700
 have a lot of different areas,

22:52.700 --> 22:54.340
 but there are two main pathways.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.820
 One involves the hypothalamus,

22:57.820 --> 22:58.660
 which you heard about before,

22:58.660 --> 23:00.420
 this collection of neurons that control

23:00.420 --> 23:03.140
 a lot of our primitive drives for sex,

23:03.140 --> 23:06.140
 for food, for thirst, and for warmth, et cetera.

23:06.140 --> 23:09.580
 And it also feeds out to our adrenals,

23:09.580 --> 23:11.940
 those glands that you learned about a few minutes ago

23:11.940 --> 23:15.340
 to create a sense of alertness and action.

23:15.340 --> 23:17.300
 It also feeds out.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.760
 What I mean by feeds out, by the way,

23:18.760 --> 23:20.940
 is there are neurons that send wires,

23:20.940 --> 23:23.140
 we call those wires axons connections,

23:23.140 --> 23:24.460
 where they can release chemicals

23:24.460 --> 23:26.300
 and trigger the activation of different brain areas.

23:26.300 --> 23:30.020
 So it feeds out to other brain areas such as the PAG.

23:30.020 --> 23:33.000
 PAG is very interesting for our discussion today.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.860
 It's the periaqueductal gray.

23:34.860 --> 23:38.340
 The periaqueductal gray contains neurons

23:38.340 --> 23:42.580
 that can trigger freezing, can trigger the,

23:42.580 --> 23:44.900
 some people talk about the fawning response,

23:44.900 --> 23:48.580
 which is kind of an appeasing response to traumatic events,

23:48.580 --> 23:51.720
 but some people outright freeze in response to fear, right?

23:51.720 --> 23:53.580
 We've heard of fight or flight,

23:53.580 --> 23:55.580
 and indeed the pathway that I'm describing

23:55.580 --> 23:58.460
 can create a sense of fight and cause people

23:58.460 --> 24:00.740
 to want to lean in in an aggressive way

24:00.740 --> 24:02.720
 to combat things that they're afraid of,

24:02.720 --> 24:07.420
 or flight to run away, essentially to avoid by mobilizing

24:07.420 --> 24:09.700
 the thing that they feel they're threatened by.

24:09.700 --> 24:11.860
 Now, even in the absence of some threat,

24:11.860 --> 24:15.500
 somebody that has, say, a fear of public speaking

24:15.500 --> 24:18.880
 might hesitate or move away from a podium

24:18.880 --> 24:22.100
 or hesitate or move away from raising their hand,

24:22.100 --> 24:24.060
 if raising their hand meant that they might be called on

24:24.060 --> 24:25.860
 and would be public speaking.

24:25.860 --> 24:26.960
 So there's fight and flight,

24:26.960 --> 24:28.740
 but there's also the freeze response.

24:28.740 --> 24:30.980
 And the freeze response is controlled

24:30.980 --> 24:32.000
 by a number of brain centers,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.480
 but the periaqueductal gray, the PAG,

24:34.480 --> 24:36.720
 is central for this freeze response.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.860
 And neurons there also create

24:38.860 --> 24:40.860
 what are called endogenous opioids.

24:40.860 --> 24:43.220
 Many of you have heard of the opioid crisis,

24:43.220 --> 24:46.460
 which is a crisis of prescription medication

24:46.460 --> 24:48.420
 given out too broadly for people that don't need it,

24:48.420 --> 24:50.980
 who become addicted to opioids.

24:50.980 --> 24:53.080
 Those are exogenous opioids,

24:53.080 --> 24:57.940
 but endogenous opioids are chemicals released from neurons

24:57.940 --> 24:59.880
 in the PAG and from elsewhere in the body

24:59.880 --> 25:01.520
 that give us a sense of numbing.

25:01.520 --> 25:03.000
 They actually numb us against pain.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.140
 And you can imagine why biology

25:05.140 --> 25:06.740
 would be organized this way.

25:06.740 --> 25:09.360
 A threat occurs or something that we perceive as a threat,

25:09.360 --> 25:12.300
 we're afraid of it, and a natural analgesic

25:12.300 --> 25:13.380
 is released into our body

25:13.380 --> 25:15.340
 because there's likely to be an interaction

25:15.340 --> 25:17.740
 that's very uncomfortable, that's physically uncomfortable.

25:17.740 --> 25:20.420
 So it's like we have our own endogenous release

25:20.420 --> 25:24.300
 of these opioids and that's occurring in the PAG.

25:24.300 --> 25:25.620
 The other area, and again,

25:25.620 --> 25:27.280
 sorry to litter the conversation

25:27.280 --> 25:28.980
 with these names of structures,

25:28.980 --> 25:32.180
 but some people seem to enjoy knowing these structures.

25:32.180 --> 25:34.900
 You're fine if you just understand what the structures do.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.300
 If you want to know the names, that's fine.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.540
 But the other structure is the locus coeruleus.

25:38.540 --> 25:41.480
 The locus coeruleus creates a sense of arousal

25:41.480 --> 25:43.760
 by releasing adrenaline, epinephrine,

25:43.760 --> 25:46.360
 and norepinephrine, a related chemical, into the brain.

25:46.360 --> 25:50.360
 So basically the activation of the amygdaloid complex

25:50.360 --> 25:52.100
 could be from any number of different things,

25:52.100 --> 25:53.660
 a memory of something fearful,

25:53.660 --> 25:57.420
 an actual sensory experience of something that's fearful.

25:57.420 --> 26:02.160
 But then the fear response itself is taking part

26:02.160 --> 26:04.500
 because of the threat reflex gets activated.

26:04.500 --> 26:08.100
 And that threat reflex then sends a whole set

26:08.100 --> 26:10.340
 of other functions into action,

26:10.340 --> 26:12.380
 freezing, activation of the adrenals,

26:12.380 --> 26:15.500
 activation of locus coeruleus for arousal and alertness,

26:15.500 --> 26:18.980
 activation of this endogenous pain system

26:18.980 --> 26:21.820
 or anti-pain system in the PAG.

26:21.820 --> 26:23.660
 That's one pathway out of the amygdala.

26:23.660 --> 26:25.940
 The other pathway out of the amygdala

26:25.940 --> 26:27.540
 is to a very interesting area

26:27.540 --> 26:31.020
 that typically is associated with reward and even addiction.

26:31.020 --> 26:33.520
 So this might come as a surprise to many of you.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.060
 In fact, it came as a surprise to me.

26:35.060 --> 26:36.420
 I remember when these data were published,

26:36.420 --> 26:39.780
 but the amygdaloid complex actually projects to areas

26:39.780 --> 26:42.940
 of the dopamine system, the so-called nucleus accumbens,

26:42.940 --> 26:44.640
 the mesolimbic reward pathway.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.220
 For those of you that want to look that up

26:47.220 --> 26:49.500
 or that remember from the dopamine episodes,

26:50.380 --> 26:51.740
 we have pathways in our brain

26:51.740 --> 26:54.280
 that are associated with pursuit, motivation and reward.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.760
 And the neuromodulator dopamine is largely responsible

26:56.760 --> 26:58.940
 for that feeling of craving, pursuit and reward.

26:58.940 --> 27:03.380
 And this threat center is actually able to communicate with

27:03.380 --> 27:05.400
 and activate the dopamine system.

27:05.400 --> 27:08.100
 And later you will realize why that is very important

27:08.100 --> 27:10.580
 and why you can leverage the dopamine system

27:10.580 --> 27:14.820
 in order to wire in new memories to replace fearful ones.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.700
 So I've been hitting you with a lot of names of things,

27:16.700 --> 27:17.820
 but for the moment,

27:17.820 --> 27:20.320
 even if you're interested in all the neuroscience names

27:20.320 --> 27:22.260
 and structures and so forth,

27:22.260 --> 27:24.700
 I'd like you to just conceptualize

27:24.700 --> 27:26.660
 that you have a circuit in your brain,

27:26.660 --> 27:29.460
 meaning a set of cells and connections

27:29.460 --> 27:32.120
 that are arranged in the following way.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.700
 You have a threat reflex

27:33.700 --> 27:38.280
 that can be activated at any time, very easily,

27:38.280 --> 27:40.380
 but what activates that threat reflex

27:40.380 --> 27:41.860
 can depend on two things.

27:41.860 --> 27:46.020
 One are prior memories coming from brain areas

27:46.020 --> 27:48.420
 that are involved in storage of memories,

27:48.420 --> 27:50.480
 or it can be immediate experiences.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.980
 Things are happening in the now, okay?

27:52.980 --> 27:55.160
 So where's something fearful to happen right now?

27:55.160 --> 27:57.300
 Your threat reflex could be activated.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.360
 Were you to remember something very scary

27:59.360 --> 28:00.380
 that happened to you in the past?

28:00.380 --> 28:02.060
 Your threat reflex could be activated.

28:02.060 --> 28:07.060
 And that threat reflex circuit has two major outputs.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.340
 One of the major outputs is to areas

28:09.340 --> 28:11.440
 that are involved in the threat response,

28:11.440 --> 28:15.020
 freezing, pain management, and alertness.

28:15.020 --> 28:17.460
 And the other major output is to areas involved

28:17.460 --> 28:22.360
 in reward, motivation, and reinforcement, okay?

28:23.640 --> 28:25.060
 There's a fourth component,

28:25.060 --> 28:26.820
 and I promise this is the last component

28:26.820 --> 28:28.460
 that we need to put into this picture

28:28.460 --> 28:30.060
 of the neural circuits for fear.

28:30.060 --> 28:33.040
 And this is a circuit that involves an area of the brain

28:33.040 --> 28:35.980
 called the prefrontal cortex and some of its subdivisions,

28:35.980 --> 28:37.540
 so literally in the front.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.380
 And it's involved in what we call top-down processing.

28:42.380 --> 28:47.160
 Top-down processing is the way that your prefrontal cortex

28:47.160 --> 28:50.780
 and other areas of the brain can control

28:50.780 --> 28:53.760
 or suppress a reflex, okay?

28:55.100 --> 28:58.640
 A good example of this would be the step on the tack example

28:58.640 --> 28:59.480
 that I gave before.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.540
 So when you step on a tack,

29:00.540 --> 29:02.220
 you immediately pull up your foot

29:02.220 --> 29:03.540
 and you extend the other leg.

29:03.540 --> 29:07.540
 That's the reflex that prevents you from injuring yourself

29:07.540 --> 29:08.800
 and from falling over.

29:10.180 --> 29:14.900
 However, if you wanted, not that you would want to,

29:14.900 --> 29:18.140
 but if you wanted, you could, for instance,

29:18.140 --> 29:20.260
 place your foot onto a tack

29:20.260 --> 29:22.260
 and decide not to pull your foot away.

29:22.260 --> 29:23.340
 It would be difficult.

29:23.340 --> 29:25.140
 And again, I don't recommend that you do that,

29:25.140 --> 29:28.320
 but you could override that reflex, okay?

29:28.320 --> 29:30.280
 There are other examples of reflexes,

29:30.280 --> 29:32.140
 like, for instance, getting into cold water.

29:32.140 --> 29:35.420
 Most people will start to huddle their body.

29:35.420 --> 29:37.220
 Most people won't want to get into the cold water.

29:37.220 --> 29:39.140
 Many people will jump out.

29:39.140 --> 29:41.240
 But all of that is reflexive.

29:42.140 --> 29:44.000
 And should you want to,

29:44.000 --> 29:47.380
 you could override that reflex through top-down processing.

29:47.380 --> 29:48.420
 You could tell yourself,

29:48.420 --> 29:50.380
 oh, I heard on a previous Huberman Lab podcast

29:50.380 --> 29:53.060
 or on an Instagram post that cold water exposure

29:53.060 --> 29:56.180
 can be beneficial for metabolism and resilience, et cetera,

29:56.180 --> 29:57.020
 and indeed it can.

29:57.020 --> 29:59.260
 And you can decide to get into the water

29:59.260 --> 30:01.860
 and to stretch out your body, not to huddle,

30:01.860 --> 30:05.240
 and you can fight those reflexes, okay?

30:05.240 --> 30:07.820
 The fighting of reflex is carried out

30:07.820 --> 30:09.280
 through top-down processing,

30:09.280 --> 30:11.100
 largely through the prefrontal cortex.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.900
 You provide a narrative.

30:12.900 --> 30:15.820
 You tell yourself, I want to do this, or I should do this,

30:15.820 --> 30:19.660
 or even though I don't want to, I'm going to do it anyway.

30:19.660 --> 30:22.260
 So top-down processing is not just

30:22.260 --> 30:23.600
 for getting into cold water.

30:23.600 --> 30:26.500
 And it certainly isn't for overriding reflexes

30:26.500 --> 30:30.000
 that can damage us like stepping on the tack example.

30:30.000 --> 30:33.020
 It is the way in which we can override

30:33.020 --> 30:35.300
 any number of internal reflexes,

30:35.300 --> 30:38.140
 including the threat reflex.

30:38.140 --> 30:43.140
 And the way that we do that is by giving a new story

30:43.180 --> 30:46.940
 or a new narrative to this experience that we call threat.

30:46.940 --> 30:48.500
 And you know the threat response.

30:48.500 --> 30:50.460
 The threat response is quickening of the heart rate,

30:50.460 --> 30:52.040
 quickening of the breathing.

30:52.040 --> 30:54.440
 We don't generally like the feeling of adrenaline

30:54.440 --> 30:55.280
 in our system.

30:55.280 --> 30:56.940
 A lot of people are so-called adrenaline junkies,

30:56.940 --> 31:00.600
 and they get a mixture of dopamine and adrenaline

31:00.600 --> 31:03.180
 from certain high-intensity events.

31:03.180 --> 31:05.980
 I confess in previous aspects of my life,

31:05.980 --> 31:07.900
 I've tended to like adrenaline.

31:07.900 --> 31:11.700
 I don't think I was at the extreme of thrill-seeking,

31:11.700 --> 31:14.940
 but I'm somebody that, for instance, I tend to like.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.540
 I like roller coasters.

31:16.540 --> 31:19.580
 I've done various things where I'm familiar with

31:19.580 --> 31:22.660
 and I enjoy the sensation of adrenaline in my body,

31:22.660 --> 31:25.600
 but I enjoy it because of the alertness that it brings

31:25.600 --> 31:27.340
 and the hyperacuity that it brings.

31:27.340 --> 31:28.920
 Many people don't feel that way.

31:28.920 --> 31:31.520
 In fact, most people don't like the sensation

31:31.520 --> 31:33.740
 of a lot of adrenaline in their system.

31:33.740 --> 31:37.020
 It makes them feel very uncomfortable and out of control.

31:37.020 --> 31:39.260
 We will do an entire episode about adrenaline

31:39.260 --> 31:41.980
 and adrenaline junkies and adrenaline aversives

31:41.980 --> 31:45.140
 in the future, but the threat reflex

31:45.140 --> 31:47.340
 inevitably involves the release of adrenaline

31:47.340 --> 31:48.700
 into the system.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.740
 And then it becomes a question of whether or not

31:50.740 --> 31:55.060
 you remain still, move forward, or retreat

31:55.060 --> 31:57.460
 from that adrenaline experience.

31:57.460 --> 31:58.740
 And when I say the adrenaline experience,

31:58.740 --> 32:00.140
 I mean the threat reflex.

32:00.140 --> 32:04.340
 So this fourth component of fear is really our ability

32:04.340 --> 32:07.580
 to attach narrative, to attach meaning,

32:07.580 --> 32:10.260
 and to attach purpose to what is,

32:10.260 --> 32:13.720
 by all accounts and purposes, a generic response.

32:13.720 --> 32:16.720
 There's no negotiating what fear feels like.

32:16.720 --> 32:19.180
 There's only negotiating what it means.

32:19.180 --> 32:21.640
 There's only negotiating whether or not you persist,

32:21.640 --> 32:24.180
 whether or not you pause, or whether or not you retreat.

32:24.180 --> 32:26.220
 So this is usually the point in the podcast

32:26.220 --> 32:27.360
 where I think people start asking,

32:27.360 --> 32:29.380
 okay, well, there's the biology, there's the mechanism,

32:29.380 --> 32:32.180
 there's the logic, how do I eliminate fear?

32:32.180 --> 32:34.700
 Well, it's not quite that simple,

32:34.700 --> 32:37.340
 although by understanding the logic and the mechanisms

32:37.340 --> 32:39.260
 by which these circuits are built,

32:39.260 --> 32:41.060
 we can eventually get to that place.

32:42.340 --> 32:46.500
 I do want to plant a flag around a particular type of tool

32:46.500 --> 32:50.180
 or a logical framework around a particular set of tools,

32:50.180 --> 32:53.980
 rather, that we are going to build out through this episode.

32:53.980 --> 32:56.980
 And based on what you now know,

32:56.980 --> 33:01.640
 that the threat reflex gets input and it has outputs,

33:01.640 --> 33:05.660
 and it's subject to these top-down processing events,

33:05.660 --> 33:10.140
 these narratives, you should be asking yourself,

33:10.140 --> 33:13.940
 what sort of narrative should I apply to eliminate fear?

33:13.940 --> 33:16.700
 Well, first let's take a step back

33:16.700 --> 33:18.660
 and it just acknowledged the reality,

33:18.660 --> 33:23.660
 which is that fear is, in some cases, an adaptive response.

33:23.820 --> 33:26.820
 We don't want people eliminating fears

33:26.820 --> 33:29.260
 that can get them injured or killed, right?

33:29.260 --> 33:32.340
 The reason that the fear threat response

33:32.340 --> 33:36.540
 and reflex exists at all is to help us from dying,

33:36.540 --> 33:39.020
 to help us from making really bad decisions.

33:39.020 --> 33:41.800
 It just so happens that a number of things happen to us

33:41.800 --> 33:44.960
 that are not lethal, that don't harm us,

33:44.960 --> 33:47.140
 but that harm us from the inside.

33:47.140 --> 33:49.860
 And I think that, and here I'm borrowing language

33:50.820 --> 33:52.860
 from an excellent researcher

33:52.860 --> 33:56.040
 who's done important work in this area at Harvard.

33:56.040 --> 33:58.060
 His name is Dr. Kerry Ressler.

33:58.060 --> 34:00.780
 He's both a medical doctor and a PhD, so an MD PhD.

34:00.780 --> 34:03.120
 He's the chief scientific officer at McLean Hospital.

34:03.120 --> 34:05.420
 He's a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School,

34:05.420 --> 34:08.400
 and he's done extensive and important work on fear.

34:08.400 --> 34:11.960
 I'm going to refer back to Dr. Ressler's work

34:11.960 --> 34:13.520
 several times during this podcast,

34:13.520 --> 34:15.740
 including important and super interesting work

34:15.740 --> 34:18.620
 on transgenerational passage of trauma.

34:18.620 --> 34:21.580
 He's a absolutely world-class biologist,

34:21.580 --> 34:23.980
 absolutely world-class clinician.

34:23.980 --> 34:28.900
 And Dr. Ressler has described fear before

34:28.900 --> 34:32.780
 as containing a historical component.

34:32.780 --> 34:35.180
 So it's not just about a readiness for things

34:35.180 --> 34:39.340
 that might injure us or kill us in the immediate circumstance

34:39.340 --> 34:42.060
 but also protecting us for the future

34:42.060 --> 34:45.180
 because of our important need and ability to anticipate.

34:45.180 --> 34:49.180
 And what he describes are memories as protective

34:49.180 --> 34:51.520
 or memories as dangerous.

34:51.520 --> 34:55.260
 Some memories, even if they evoke a sense of fear in us

34:55.260 --> 34:56.140
 are protective.

34:56.140 --> 34:58.120
 They protect us from making bad mistakes

34:58.120 --> 34:59.940
 that could get us injured or killed

34:59.940 --> 35:02.660
 or put us into really horrible circumstances.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.620
 Other memories are dangerous

35:04.620 --> 35:08.820
 because they create a sense in us of discomfort

35:08.820 --> 35:10.980
 and they tend to limit our behavior

35:10.980 --> 35:12.860
 in ways that are maladaptive,

35:12.860 --> 35:15.680
 that prevent us from having healthy relationships to others,

35:15.680 --> 35:17.720
 healthy job relationships,

35:17.720 --> 35:20.300
 healthy relationship to ourselves, frankly.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.520
 So this language of memories as protective

35:22.520 --> 35:25.180
 or memories as dangerous in the context of fear

35:25.180 --> 35:26.340
 is not something that I said,

35:26.340 --> 35:30.100
 it's really something that I lifted from Dr. Ressler

35:30.100 --> 35:33.580
 in one of his many impressive lectures.

35:33.580 --> 35:35.780
 And it's an important aspect of fear

35:35.780 --> 35:40.260
 because much of the fear system is a memory system.

35:40.260 --> 35:42.780
 It's designed to embed a memory

35:42.780 --> 35:46.180
 of certain previous experiences in us

35:46.180 --> 35:48.700
 such that the threat reflex is activated

35:49.620 --> 35:52.800
 in the anticipation of what might happen, okay?

35:52.800 --> 35:54.500
 So let's talk for a second about how certain memories

35:54.500 --> 35:56.140
 get attached to this fear system.

35:56.140 --> 35:58.460
 And this brings us to a beautiful

35:58.460 --> 36:00.780
 and indeed Nobel prize-winning aspect

36:00.780 --> 36:02.500
 of biology and physiology,

36:02.500 --> 36:04.700
 which is Pavlovian conditioning.

36:04.700 --> 36:07.180
 Many of you are probably familiar with Pavlov's dogs

36:07.180 --> 36:10.460
 and the famous Pavlovian conditioning experiments.

36:10.460 --> 36:12.220
 They go something like this.

36:12.220 --> 36:15.000
 You know, if you and Pavlov did these experiments

36:15.000 --> 36:18.640
 and ring a bell, a dog doesn't do much

36:18.640 --> 36:20.180
 in response to a bell, it might attend to it,

36:20.180 --> 36:22.680
 but it doesn't salivate typically in response to the bell.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.500
 However, if you pair the ringing of a bell

36:24.500 --> 36:27.340
 with a presentation of food enough times,

36:27.340 --> 36:29.560
 the dog will salivate in response to the food.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.040
 Eventually you take away the food,

36:31.040 --> 36:33.120
 you just ring the bell and the dog will salivate

36:33.120 --> 36:34.900
 in response to the bell, okay?

36:34.900 --> 36:37.600
 So in the context of so-called Pavlovian conditioning,

36:37.600 --> 36:39.620
 these things have names like conditioned stimulus

36:39.620 --> 36:42.100
 and unconditioned stimulus and responses.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.480
 People often get these mixed up

36:43.480 --> 36:45.040
 and it can be a little confusing,

36:45.040 --> 36:47.140
 but I'm just going to make it really simple for you.

36:47.140 --> 36:49.860
 The unconditioned stimulus is the thing

36:49.860 --> 36:53.800
 that evokes a response unconditionally.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.860
 So food is the unconditioned stimulus

36:55.860 --> 36:57.380
 in the example I just gave.

36:57.380 --> 36:59.980
 A foot shock or a loud bang

36:59.980 --> 37:02.540
 would be the unconditioned stimulus in,

37:02.540 --> 37:06.460
 for instance, an experiment geared toward exploring fear.

37:06.460 --> 37:08.700
 That unconditioned stimulus is unconditional.

37:08.700 --> 37:11.100
 It unconditionally evokes a startle

37:11.100 --> 37:13.280
 or in the case of food, salivating.

37:14.260 --> 37:17.020
 The bell in the previous example

37:17.020 --> 37:20.420
 is what we call the conditioned stimulus

37:20.420 --> 37:21.940
 or the conditioning stimulus.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.340
 Sometimes people mix these up.

37:24.340 --> 37:28.700
 The conditioned stimulus is paired with the thing

37:28.700 --> 37:30.540
 that naturally creates a response.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.620
 And then eventually the conditioned stimulus

37:32.620 --> 37:34.520
 creates the response itself.

37:34.520 --> 37:35.360
 You might think, well,

37:35.360 --> 37:38.920
 that just seems endlessly boring and simple,

37:38.920 --> 37:42.340
 but this is actually the way that our fear systems work.

37:42.340 --> 37:44.800
 Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,

37:44.800 --> 37:48.180
 you don't need many, many pairings

37:48.180 --> 37:51.860
 of a bell with some unconditioned stimulus

37:51.860 --> 37:53.200
 in order to get a response.

37:53.200 --> 37:55.020
 You can get what's called one trial learning.

37:55.020 --> 37:57.500
 And in this circuit that involves the amygdala,

37:57.500 --> 38:00.920
 the threat reflex, and all this other stuff

38:00.920 --> 38:03.280
 that I was talking about earlier,

38:03.280 --> 38:05.500
 the system is set up for learning.

38:05.500 --> 38:09.700
 It's set up to create memories and to anticipate problems.

38:09.700 --> 38:10.900
 It's a very good system

38:10.900 --> 38:13.260
 because it was designed to keep us safe.

38:13.260 --> 38:17.900
 And so the way to think about this is that for many people,

38:17.900 --> 38:22.440
 one intense experience, one burn, one bad breakup,

38:22.440 --> 38:25.640
 one bad experience public speaking,

38:25.640 --> 38:28.660
 one bad experience with somebody's pet snake

38:28.660 --> 38:30.300
 or whatever it happens to be

38:30.300 --> 38:33.420
 can cause intense fear in the moment,

38:33.420 --> 38:36.020
 a long reverberatory experience of fear,

38:36.020 --> 38:38.280
 like trouble sleeping that night and the following night,

38:38.280 --> 38:40.340
 memories of the experience that are troubling,

38:40.340 --> 38:42.500
 physiological responses that are troubling.

38:43.540 --> 38:48.120
 Essentially, it gets wired in as a fear with one trial,

38:48.120 --> 38:48.960
 which is quite different

38:48.960 --> 38:50.780
 than the other forms of neuroplasticity.

38:50.780 --> 38:51.720
 Neuroplasticity, of course,

38:51.720 --> 38:53.860
 just being the nervous system's ability to change

38:53.860 --> 38:55.020
 in response to experience.

38:55.020 --> 38:57.380
 Other forms of neuroplasticity like learning a language,

38:57.380 --> 39:02.380
 learning music, learning math, those take a while.

39:02.660 --> 39:05.280
 We don't generally get one trial learning

39:05.280 --> 39:07.100
 to positive or neutral experiences.

39:07.100 --> 39:09.060
 We get one trial learning to negative experiences.

39:09.060 --> 39:11.180
 So there's this asymmetry in how we're wired.

39:11.180 --> 39:14.620
 So now you should understand how classical conditioning,

39:14.620 --> 39:16.800
 as it's called, occurs.

39:16.800 --> 39:20.460
 You go to give a piano recital as a kid,

39:20.460 --> 39:22.500
 you sit down and you freeze up

39:22.500 --> 39:24.400
 and it's horribly embarrassing.

39:24.400 --> 39:27.420
 And even if you just freeze up for a few seconds,

39:27.420 --> 39:30.540
 the heart rate increase and the perspiring, the sweating,

39:30.540 --> 39:33.100
 and the shame that you feel

39:33.100 --> 39:36.220
 leads you to want to avoid playing instruments

39:36.220 --> 39:39.960
 or public displays of performances

39:39.960 --> 39:41.740
 for a long period of time

39:41.740 --> 39:44.500
 unless you do something to overcome it.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.980
 That's one trial learning.

39:45.980 --> 39:48.340
 Some people, it tends to be more

39:48.340 --> 39:50.140
 an accumulation of experiences.

39:50.140 --> 39:53.740
 They have a bad relationship that lasts an entire summer,

39:53.740 --> 39:55.740
 an entire year, or God forbid, a decade.

39:55.740 --> 39:57.960
 And then they have what they feel

39:57.960 --> 39:59.660
 is kind of a general sense of fear

39:59.660 --> 40:01.800
 about closeness to others and attachment.

40:01.800 --> 40:04.280
 These are common fears that people experience.

40:04.280 --> 40:06.480
 Fears can be in the short term,

40:06.480 --> 40:07.540
 fears can be in the long term,

40:07.540 --> 40:08.740
 they can be in the medium term.

40:08.740 --> 40:11.780
 Again, the fear system is very generic.

40:11.780 --> 40:15.420
 It's wired to include memories that are very acute,

40:15.420 --> 40:17.060
 that happen within a moment,

40:17.060 --> 40:20.420
 or that include many, many events and long periods of time

40:20.420 --> 40:22.760
 that kind of funnel into a general sense

40:22.760 --> 40:25.340
 of relationships are bad,

40:25.340 --> 40:28.740
 or this particular city or location is bad.

40:28.740 --> 40:32.360
 So there's a key, what we call temporal component.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.740
 There's a component of the fear system

40:34.740 --> 40:38.220
 being able to batch many events in time

40:38.220 --> 40:40.800
 and create one specific fear,

40:40.800 --> 40:43.820
 or take one very specific isolated incident

40:43.820 --> 40:45.060
 that happened very briefly

40:45.060 --> 40:48.060
 and create one very large general sense of fears.

40:48.060 --> 40:50.580
 And I'll give an example of the latter

40:50.580 --> 40:53.580
 just to kind of flesh this out a little bit.

40:53.580 --> 40:57.980
 I had a friend come visit me in San Francisco some years ago

40:57.980 --> 40:59.500
 and their car got broken into,

40:59.500 --> 41:01.500
 unfortunately, a frequent occurrence in San Francisco

41:01.500 --> 41:02.340
 and in the middle of the day,

41:02.340 --> 41:04.020
 never leave anything in your car in San Francisco.

41:04.020 --> 41:06.740
 They'll break in in the middle of the day, doesn't matter.

41:06.740 --> 41:08.580
 Police can be having coffee right there in front of them.

41:08.580 --> 41:12.260
 They'll still do it for reasons we could discuss.

41:12.260 --> 41:13.680
 This is a problem.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.260
 They got their belongings taken

41:15.260 --> 41:17.260
 and they decided they were never coming back

41:17.260 --> 41:18.480
 to San Francisco.

41:18.480 --> 41:22.840
 This was an isolated incident that forever colored

41:22.840 --> 41:26.460
 their view of the city, which I, you know, frankly,

41:26.460 --> 41:29.180
 understanding the fear system, I can understand.

41:29.180 --> 41:31.540
 We can have isolated incidents that wick out

41:31.540 --> 41:34.740
 to broad decisions about entire places,

41:34.740 --> 41:36.820
 or we can have many experiences

41:36.820 --> 41:39.940
 that funnel into very specific isolated fears

41:39.940 --> 41:42.700
 about particular circumstances, places, and things.

41:42.700 --> 41:43.960
 So I like to think that by now

41:43.960 --> 41:45.840
 you have a pretty good understanding

41:45.840 --> 41:49.240
 of the circuits that underlie the threat reflex,

41:49.240 --> 41:52.980
 the fear response, and how we have top-down control,

41:52.980 --> 41:57.100
 meaning we can attach a narrative to the fear response,

41:57.100 --> 41:59.680
 and that the fear response can be learned

41:59.680 --> 42:03.200
 in association with particular events, okay?

42:04.460 --> 42:07.100
 I haven't really talked about how the learning occurs,

42:07.100 --> 42:09.180
 and so I just want to take a moment and describe that

42:09.180 --> 42:11.180
 because it leads right into our discussion

42:11.180 --> 42:13.460
 about how to eliminate fears,

42:13.460 --> 42:15.080
 and indeed how to replace fears

42:15.080 --> 42:17.260
 with more positive experiences.

42:17.260 --> 42:18.840
 There's a process in our nervous system

42:18.840 --> 42:20.340
 that we call neuroplasticity.

42:20.340 --> 42:22.020
 Neuroplasticity broadly defined

42:22.020 --> 42:23.820
 is the nervous system's ability

42:23.820 --> 42:26.100
 to change in response to experience,

42:26.100 --> 42:28.380
 but at a cellular level,

42:28.380 --> 42:31.180
 that occurs through a couple of different mechanisms.

42:31.180 --> 42:32.440
 One of the main mechanisms

42:32.440 --> 42:34.540
 is something called long-term potentiation.

42:34.540 --> 42:37.660
 Long-term potentiation involves the strengthening

42:37.660 --> 42:39.820
 of particular connections between neurons,

42:39.820 --> 42:42.360
 the connection sites between neurons we call synapses.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.280
 Actually, technically synapses are the gaps

42:44.280 --> 42:45.980
 between those connections,

42:45.980 --> 42:49.820
 but nonetheless, synapses are the point of communication

42:49.820 --> 42:52.300
 between neurons, and those can be strengthened

42:52.300 --> 42:54.260
 so that certain neurons can talk to other neurons

42:54.260 --> 42:57.700
 more robustly than they happened to before.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.960
 And anytime we talk about a particular event,

42:59.960 --> 43:03.100
 the car, the snake, the public speaking,

43:03.100 --> 43:05.580
 the trauma, the horrible experience

43:06.740 --> 43:09.300
 wiring into the fear system,

43:09.300 --> 43:12.300
 what we're talking about is a change in synaptic strengths.

43:12.300 --> 43:14.660
 We're talking about neurons that previously

43:14.660 --> 43:17.920
 did not communicate well, communicating very well.

43:17.920 --> 43:21.720
 It's like going from a old school dial-up connection

43:21.720 --> 43:23.500
 or even an old school telephone connection

43:23.500 --> 43:26.180
 or Morse code connection of communication

43:26.180 --> 43:29.960
 to high-speed ethernet, okay, to a 5G connection.

43:29.960 --> 43:32.140
 It gets faster, it gets more robust,

43:32.140 --> 43:33.960
 and it's very, very clear.

43:33.960 --> 43:37.100
 That's what happens when you get long-term potentiation.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.240
 And long-term potentiation

43:38.240 --> 43:40.060
 involves a couple of cellular mechanisms

43:40.060 --> 43:42.120
 that are going to be relevant to our discussion

43:42.120 --> 43:45.180
 about treatments to undo fear.

43:45.180 --> 43:46.620
 And I'll just throw out a couple of the names

43:46.620 --> 43:49.300
 of some of those cellular elements right now.

43:49.300 --> 43:52.460
 The main one is the so-called NMDA receptor,

43:52.460 --> 43:54.500
 N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.940
 And what this is is this is a little docking site,

43:56.940 --> 44:00.180
 like a little parking slot on a neuron.

44:00.180 --> 44:04.120
 And when a neuron gets activated very strongly,

44:04.120 --> 44:07.060
 like from an intense event, in the example of my friend,

44:07.060 --> 44:10.860
 the intense event almost certainly activated NMDA receptors

44:10.860 --> 44:13.400
 related to their concept of protecting their property

44:13.400 --> 44:17.100
 in their cars, the break into their car

44:17.100 --> 44:20.300
 caused the NMDA receptor to be activated.

44:20.300 --> 44:23.260
 Normally that NMDA receptor is not easily activated.

44:23.260 --> 44:25.900
 And when it is activated, it sets off a cascade,

44:25.900 --> 44:28.800
 a series of signals within those neurons

44:28.800 --> 44:30.020
 that change those neurons.

44:30.020 --> 44:31.760
 It changes the genes they express.

44:31.760 --> 44:35.780
 It shuttles more parking spots to the surface of those cells

44:35.780 --> 44:39.260
 so that the communication to those cells becomes easier.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.540
 It becomes faster.

44:40.540 --> 44:42.580
 And so the way to think about the NMDA receptor

44:42.580 --> 44:46.340
 is it's used sometimes for normal things

44:46.340 --> 44:47.920
 that we do every day, making cups of coffee

44:47.920 --> 44:50.720
 and things like that, but it's often used for learning.

44:50.720 --> 44:53.580
 It's used for creating new associations

44:53.580 --> 44:55.000
 in our nervous system.

44:55.000 --> 44:58.720
 And so the activation of the NMDA receptor and LTP,

44:58.720 --> 45:01.980
 and it involves some other things that you may have heard of

45:01.980 --> 45:05.260
 like brain-derived nootropic factors and calcium entry,

45:05.260 --> 45:07.920
 things that we can leave for a discussion for a future time,

45:07.920 --> 45:11.980
 but basically a whole cascade of events happen within cells

45:11.980 --> 45:15.740
 that then make just even the mere thought of something

45:15.740 --> 45:19.220
 or somebody or some event that happened

45:19.220 --> 45:22.480
 able to activate that threat reflex, okay?

45:22.480 --> 45:25.500
 So long-term potentiation is one of the main mechanisms

45:25.500 --> 45:29.780
 by which we take formally innocuous or irrelevant events

45:29.780 --> 45:31.900
 and we make them scary.

45:31.900 --> 45:33.680
 We make them traumatic.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.020
 Our neurons have mechanisms to do this.

45:36.020 --> 45:38.420
 Now, fortunately, the NMDA receptor

45:38.420 --> 45:39.660
 and long-term potentiation

45:39.660 --> 45:43.140
 can also run the whole system in reverse.

45:43.140 --> 45:45.620
 You can get what's called long-term depression,

45:45.620 --> 45:47.700
 and that doesn't have anything to do

45:47.700 --> 45:50.620
 with the depression associated with low mood.

45:50.620 --> 45:52.900
 What we're talking about is a weakening of connections.

45:52.900 --> 45:55.880
 You can go from having a very high-speed ethernet connection

45:55.880 --> 45:57.780
 between neurons, so to speak,

45:57.780 --> 46:00.700
 to a connection that's more like Morse code

46:00.700 --> 46:04.220
 or is like a poor dial-up connection, a really weak signal.

46:04.220 --> 46:08.240
 And that's what's happening when you extinguish a fear,

46:08.240 --> 46:10.140
 when you unlearn a fear.

46:10.140 --> 46:12.740
 So now I'd like to talk about therapies

46:12.740 --> 46:14.860
 that are carried out in humans

46:14.860 --> 46:17.380
 that allow fears to be undone,

46:17.380 --> 46:19.780
 that allow traumas to be reversed

46:19.780 --> 46:22.580
 such that people no longer feel bad

46:22.580 --> 46:25.740
 about a particular person, place, or thing,

46:25.740 --> 46:28.660
 either real interactions with that person, place, or thing,

46:28.660 --> 46:32.660
 or imagined interactions with that person, place, or thing.

46:32.660 --> 46:35.340
 That process, as I just mentioned,

46:35.340 --> 46:37.980
 also involves things like the NMDA receptor,

46:37.980 --> 46:41.560
 but rather than strengthening the connections,

46:41.560 --> 46:42.940
 the first thing that has to happen

46:42.940 --> 46:45.060
 is there needs to be a weakening of connections

46:45.060 --> 46:47.980
 that associate the person, place, or thing

46:47.980 --> 46:49.860
 with that threat reflex.

46:49.860 --> 46:51.660
 Subsequent to that, we will see,

46:51.660 --> 46:55.020
 there needs to be a strengthening of some new experience

46:55.020 --> 46:56.580
 that's positive, okay?

46:56.580 --> 46:58.860
 This is a key element of where we are headed.

46:58.860 --> 47:03.760
 Contrary to popular belief, it is not going to work

47:03.760 --> 47:06.260
 to simply extinguish a fear.

47:06.260 --> 47:10.660
 One needs to extinguish a fear and or trauma

47:10.660 --> 47:15.420
 and replace that fearful or traumatic memory or idea

47:15.420 --> 47:18.500
 or response with a positive response.

47:18.500 --> 47:21.260
 And this is something that's rarely discussed

47:21.260 --> 47:22.760
 both in the scientific literature,

47:22.760 --> 47:25.200
 but certainly in the general discussion

47:25.200 --> 47:26.540
 around fear and trauma.

47:26.540 --> 47:28.600
 There's this idea that we can extinguish fears,

47:28.600 --> 47:32.060
 we can rewire ourselves, we can eliminate our traumas,

47:32.060 --> 47:35.620
 and indeed we can, but that process has to involve

47:35.620 --> 47:38.220
 not just becoming comfortable

47:38.220 --> 47:40.180
 with a particular fearful event or trauma,

47:40.180 --> 47:44.080
 but also attaching a new positive experience

47:44.080 --> 47:47.660
 to that previously fearful or traumatic event.

47:47.660 --> 47:50.260
 There are a lot of different approaches out there

47:50.260 --> 47:53.860
 that are in clinical use to try and alleviate

47:53.860 --> 47:56.460
 fear and trauma and indeed PTSD,

47:56.460 --> 47:58.580
 post-traumatic stress disorder.

47:58.580 --> 48:03.420
 It might be surprising to learn that many

48:03.420 --> 48:05.820
 of those treatments, such as SSRIs,

48:05.820 --> 48:08.580
 the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

48:08.580 --> 48:11.540
 things like Prozac and Zoloft and similar

48:11.540 --> 48:16.120
 and other antidepressants, or things like benzodiazepines,

48:16.120 --> 48:18.620
 which are essentially like painkillers.

48:18.620 --> 48:22.160
 They create a elevation in certain transmitters

48:22.160 --> 48:24.260
 in the brain, like GABA among others.

48:24.260 --> 48:27.540
 They can have a pain relieving effect.

48:27.540 --> 48:30.220
 They are generally, however, considered anxiolytics.

48:30.220 --> 48:31.800
 They reduce anxiety.

48:32.980 --> 48:37.100
 And even antipsychotic drugs or beta blockers,

48:37.100 --> 48:38.900
 sometimes called adrenergic blockers,

48:38.900 --> 48:41.760
 drugs that are designed to prevent the heart

48:41.760 --> 48:44.420
 from beating too fast or to reduce blood pressure,

48:44.420 --> 48:45.820
 to reduce some elements of that

48:45.820 --> 48:47.940
 hypothalamic pituitary axis response

48:47.940 --> 48:49.500
 that we talked about earlier.

48:49.500 --> 48:52.960
 Many people experience some degree of relief

48:52.960 --> 48:57.540
 from the symptoms of anxiety and fear and PTSD

48:57.540 --> 48:59.420
 in taking these various compounds.

48:59.420 --> 49:02.120
 Indeed, that's why they're prescribed so broadly.

49:02.120 --> 49:05.720
 But you may find it interesting to note

49:05.720 --> 49:08.080
 that none of those current treatments

49:08.080 --> 49:10.540
 are based on the neurobiology of fear,

49:10.540 --> 49:12.480
 at least not directly, right?

49:12.480 --> 49:15.680
 People that take SSRIs oftentimes will experience

49:15.680 --> 49:17.980
 a reduction in anxiety.

49:17.980 --> 49:20.260
 It depends on the dosage and the individual, of course,

49:20.260 --> 49:21.540
 right, and you have to work with a doctor,

49:21.540 --> 49:23.540
 a psychiatrist to determine whether or not

49:23.540 --> 49:25.460
 they're right for you in the correct dosage

49:25.460 --> 49:26.780
 if they are right for you.

49:26.780 --> 49:31.780
 But that modulation of anxiety can indirectly

49:31.780 --> 49:35.080
 reduce the likelihood that one will have a panic attack

49:35.080 --> 49:37.860
 or experience a fear, an intense experience of fear,

49:37.860 --> 49:39.460
 a reliving of a trauma.

49:39.460 --> 49:43.180
 But the SSRIs themselves are not plugging

49:43.180 --> 49:45.620
 into some specific mechanism related

49:45.620 --> 49:47.860
 to how fear comes about in the system.

49:47.860 --> 49:49.620
 It's an indirect support.

49:49.620 --> 49:54.620
 That's important because if the goal of modern psychiatry

49:55.740 --> 49:57.780
 and the goal of modern biology

49:57.780 --> 50:01.000
 is to provide mechanistic understanding

50:01.000 --> 50:02.180
 that leads to treatments,

50:02.180 --> 50:04.540
 we need to think about what are the sorts of treatments

50:04.540 --> 50:06.760
 that tap into the very fear circuits

50:06.760 --> 50:07.900
 that we described before?

50:07.900 --> 50:09.500
 The fact that there are memories attached

50:09.500 --> 50:12.860
 to a generic threat reflex and response,

50:12.860 --> 50:16.060
 and the threat reflex response can be linked up

50:16.060 --> 50:17.700
 with the dopamine system and can be linked up

50:17.700 --> 50:19.760
 with other systems that are involved in pain relief

50:19.760 --> 50:21.420
 and anxiety and so forth.

50:21.420 --> 50:24.600
 And so that brings us to which treatments

50:24.600 --> 50:27.860
 are directly related to the fear circuitry

50:27.860 --> 50:30.020
 and the circuitry related to trauma.

50:30.020 --> 50:33.060
 And the primary one to begin with

50:33.060 --> 50:35.860
 is the so-called behavioral therapies.

50:35.860 --> 50:40.320
 Now, oftentimes we all wish, I think, from time to time,

50:40.320 --> 50:42.380
 that there's some specific pill that we can take,

50:42.380 --> 50:43.500
 or there's some machine or device

50:43.500 --> 50:44.740
 that we can plug our finger into,

50:44.740 --> 50:47.460
 or that we can put on a headset and all of a sudden

50:47.460 --> 50:49.000
 we just rewire our nervous system,

50:49.000 --> 50:51.540
 fear is gone, trauma is gone, but it doesn't work that way.

50:51.540 --> 50:54.700
 And when we think of language and narrative

50:54.700 --> 50:59.580
 as a tool to rewire our nervous system

50:59.580 --> 51:01.500
 in comparison to those kinds of ideas

51:01.500 --> 51:04.260
 about pills and machines and potions,

51:04.260 --> 51:06.240
 it starts to seem a little bit weak, right?

51:06.240 --> 51:08.180
 If we just think, oh, well,

51:08.180 --> 51:10.340
 how could talking actually change the way

51:10.340 --> 51:12.580
 that we respond to something?

51:12.580 --> 51:15.660
 But actually there are three forms of therapy

51:15.660 --> 51:18.140
 that purely through the use of language

51:18.140 --> 51:21.460
 have been shown to have very strong positive impact,

51:21.460 --> 51:24.180
 meaning reduced fears and traumas.

51:24.180 --> 51:27.680
 And those three are prolonged exposure therapy,

51:27.680 --> 51:29.800
 cognitive processing, or CPT,

51:29.800 --> 51:31.620
 and cognitive behavioral therapy.

51:31.620 --> 51:34.320
 And I'm not going to go into the entire literature

51:34.320 --> 51:36.700
 around prolonged exposure, cognitive processing,

51:36.700 --> 51:38.500
 and cognitive behavioral therapy,

51:38.500 --> 51:41.320
 but I will just illustrate the central theme

51:41.320 --> 51:43.180
 that allows them to work.

51:43.180 --> 51:46.780
 Now, remember that the circuit for fear,

51:46.780 --> 51:49.980
 the circuit for trauma involves this generic reflex,

51:49.980 --> 51:51.700
 and then there are those top-down elements

51:51.700 --> 51:53.000
 coming from the forebrain.

51:54.140 --> 51:56.900
 It's very clear because it's been measured

51:56.900 --> 52:00.920
 that if you look at the amount of anxiety,

52:00.920 --> 52:04.620
 the pure physiological anxiety response

52:04.620 --> 52:08.880
 of quickening of heart rate, blushing of the skin,

52:08.880 --> 52:12.980
 sometimes quaking of the hands, the experience of fear,

52:12.980 --> 52:17.780
 over time, when people recount or retell their trauma,

52:17.780 --> 52:20.140
 that the first time they do that,

52:20.140 --> 52:23.540
 especially when it's recounted in a lot of detail,

52:24.500 --> 52:26.720
 there's a tremendous anxiety response,

52:26.720 --> 52:30.680
 sometimes even as great or greater than the actual exposure

52:30.680 --> 52:32.900
 to the fearful event or trauma.

52:32.900 --> 52:35.560
 And obviously this is something that is done

52:35.560 --> 52:37.440
 with a clinician present

52:37.440 --> 52:39.900
 because it is very traumatic to the person.

52:39.900 --> 52:43.220
 They're literally reliving the trauma in full rich detail,

52:43.220 --> 52:46.720
 and they are encouraged to provide full rich detail.

52:46.720 --> 52:50.020
 They're often encouraged to speak in complete sentences,

52:50.020 --> 52:54.060
 to flesh out details about how they felt inside,

52:54.060 --> 52:56.460
 to flesh out details about their memories

52:56.460 --> 52:59.740
 going into this traumatic or fearful event,

52:59.740 --> 53:01.780
 going through it, and after,

53:01.780 --> 53:06.000
 really digging into all the nuance and contours

53:06.000 --> 53:07.700
 of these horrible experiences.

53:07.700 --> 53:12.700
 But what's remarkable is that in the second and the third

53:13.780 --> 53:17.060
 and the fourth retelling of these traumatic

53:17.060 --> 53:20.060
 or fearful events, that anxiety response

53:20.060 --> 53:22.840
 and the amount of the physiological response,

53:22.840 --> 53:24.380
 I should say that the amplitude

53:24.380 --> 53:26.080
 of the physiological response

53:26.080 --> 53:29.540
 becomes progressively diminished with each retelling.

53:29.540 --> 53:32.580
 Now, some of you might be saying, well, duh,

53:32.580 --> 53:34.900
 you tell a story enough times

53:34.900 --> 53:37.900
 that eventually it wears off.

53:37.900 --> 53:39.340
 Just like if you watch a movie enough times

53:39.340 --> 53:41.300
 and you hear the same joke enough times,

53:41.300 --> 53:44.600
 eventually it doesn't have the same impact.

53:44.600 --> 53:46.380
 But that needn't be the case, right?

53:46.380 --> 53:50.640
 You could imagine that this high amplitude anxiety response,

53:50.640 --> 53:52.100
 this high amplitude activation

53:52.100 --> 53:54.820
 of the sympathetic nervous system in retelling

53:54.820 --> 53:58.140
 would actually create a even deeper

53:58.140 --> 54:01.060
 routed fear response and trauma,

54:01.060 --> 54:02.500
 but that's not what happens.

54:02.500 --> 54:05.700
 And every clinician I spoke to in anticipation

54:05.700 --> 54:07.700
 of this episode, which include clinical psychologists,

54:07.700 --> 54:10.060
 psychiatrists, and people who actually work

54:10.060 --> 54:12.680
 on the fear system at a biological level,

54:12.680 --> 54:13.940
 said the exact same thing,

54:13.940 --> 54:17.460
 which is that a detailed recounting

54:17.460 --> 54:21.780
 of the traumatic and fearful events is absolutely essential

54:21.780 --> 54:25.620
 in order to get the positive effects of prolonged exposure,

54:25.620 --> 54:28.080
 cognitive processing, and cognitive behavioral therapy.

54:28.080 --> 54:30.560
 Again, this has to be done with the appropriate support.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.940
 This isn't something that should be taken lightly

54:32.940 --> 54:34.900
 because as we've mentioned before,

54:34.900 --> 54:37.980
 the fear response can have a very long lasting

54:37.980 --> 54:38.940
 contour to it.

54:38.940 --> 54:41.940
 People can sometimes have trouble sleeping for days and days

54:41.940 --> 54:44.100
 and afterwards we'll talk about sleep in a little bit,

54:44.100 --> 54:48.580
 but the point is that the retelling is important.

54:48.580 --> 54:52.780
 And the idea here is to take what was a terrible

54:52.780 --> 54:54.800
 and extremely troubling,

54:56.060 --> 54:57.720
 meaning physiologically troubling,

54:57.720 --> 54:59.820
 psychologically troubling story,

54:59.820 --> 55:04.820
 and turn it into what is essentially a boring bad story.

55:06.580 --> 55:09.660
 It never really becomes a good story at this point

55:09.660 --> 55:12.340
 in the treatment process that we're describing.

55:12.340 --> 55:15.960
 So a terrible event is a terrible event, period,

55:15.960 --> 55:19.260
 but there's a way in which the retelling of that event

55:19.260 --> 55:24.260
 starts to uncouple the threat reflex from the narrative.

55:24.420 --> 55:28.300
 And with each successive retelling in detail

55:28.300 --> 55:31.540
 of these traumatic events, of these fearful events,

55:31.540 --> 55:36.540
 the threat reflex is activated at a progressively

55:36.820 --> 55:39.980
 lower and lower amplitude such that eventually

55:39.980 --> 55:43.440
 it just becomes a really bad, really boring story.

55:44.300 --> 55:48.060
 Now that's one part of the process of getting over a fear.

55:48.060 --> 55:50.540
 It's what we call fear extinction.

55:50.540 --> 55:53.380
 And we can bring ourselves back to our earlier example

55:53.380 --> 55:56.220
 of Pavlovian conditioning because many studies

55:56.220 --> 55:58.380
 have been done both in animals and in humans

55:58.380 --> 56:02.060
 showing that, for instance, if you pair a tone,

56:02.060 --> 56:05.260
 you know, a bell or a buzzer with a foot shock

56:05.260 --> 56:08.040
 that an animal or a person will brace themselves

56:08.040 --> 56:09.020
 for the foot shock,

56:09.920 --> 56:12.560
 eventually you can just give the bell or tone

56:12.560 --> 56:14.940
 and the person will experience that same freezing up

56:14.940 --> 56:17.660
 or the same fight or flight or freeze response.

56:17.660 --> 56:19.660
 So you condition that.

56:19.660 --> 56:23.460
 But if you give the tone or the bell over and over

56:23.460 --> 56:25.860
 and there's no foot shock, there's no pain,

56:25.860 --> 56:27.740
 and in humans, this is sometimes done with foot shock,

56:27.740 --> 56:29.780
 sometimes believe it or not with mild burn,

56:29.780 --> 56:31.440
 there are even some studies, there's older studies,

56:31.440 --> 56:33.660
 you couldn't do those now, nor would you want to,

56:33.660 --> 56:37.300
 but eventually what happens is the tone,

56:37.300 --> 56:41.020
 the bell no longer evokes that response, okay?

56:41.020 --> 56:45.540
 So you see this as a reversal of the classical conditioning

56:45.540 --> 56:47.740
 and we call that reversal extinction.

56:47.740 --> 56:51.420
 So the retelling of this traumatic or fearful narrative,

56:51.420 --> 56:56.140
 excuse me, fearful narrative is essentially

56:56.140 --> 56:58.180
 an extinction process.

56:58.180 --> 56:59.820
 Now, how is this done?

56:59.820 --> 57:02.860
 One can do this in a therapist's office face-to-face,

57:02.860 --> 57:03.860
 that's sometimes done,

57:03.860 --> 57:05.820
 it's sometimes done in group type settings

57:05.820 --> 57:07.260
 where people actually stand up

57:07.260 --> 57:09.660
 or sit in front of a group, small or large,

57:09.660 --> 57:12.740
 and recount in detail their traumatic experience.

57:12.740 --> 57:16.780
 It's sometimes done by people writing out

57:16.780 --> 57:18.740
 the experience in detail.

57:18.740 --> 57:21.740
 And which one of these is most effective

57:21.740 --> 57:24.300
 isn't really clear, the literature points to the fact

57:24.300 --> 57:26.500
 that a feeling of trust, obviously,

57:26.500 --> 57:29.020
 between the patient and the clinician

57:29.020 --> 57:31.740
 or the person and the group is essential,

57:31.740 --> 57:34.100
 some people don't have access to because of finances

57:34.100 --> 57:36.660
 or other limitations to therapy of that sort,

57:36.660 --> 57:38.420
 in that case, journaling in detail

57:39.300 --> 57:41.540
 has been shown to be effective,

57:41.540 --> 57:43.520
 although, again, I want to caution people

57:43.520 --> 57:46.540
 about reactivating traumas without consideration

57:46.540 --> 57:49.020
 for the kinds of social support they might need

57:49.020 --> 57:50.700
 around that reactivation,

57:50.700 --> 57:51.860
 and we will talk a little bit later

57:51.860 --> 57:54.260
 about some of the chemicals involved in social support

57:54.260 --> 57:56.680
 and why those help extinguish fears.

57:56.680 --> 58:00.580
 So the thing to embed in your mind is that recognition

58:00.580 --> 58:04.620
 of the early traumatic or fearful event in detail

58:04.620 --> 58:08.340
 over and over is key to forming a new

58:08.340 --> 58:13.340
 non-traumatic association with that event or person.

58:14.240 --> 58:16.140
 So that's part one.

58:16.140 --> 58:18.900
 You need to diminish the old experience.

58:18.900 --> 58:19.940
 And when I say diminish,

58:19.940 --> 58:24.300
 I mean reduce the amplitude of the physiological response.

58:24.300 --> 58:26.180
 Now, this is just but one approach.

58:26.180 --> 58:27.560
 I'm going to talk about other approaches

58:27.560 --> 58:31.240
 to eliminating fear and trauma as we go forward.

58:31.240 --> 58:34.060
 But I want to emphasize that diminishing the amplitude

58:34.060 --> 58:36.440
 of the physiological response is the first step.

58:36.440 --> 58:39.360
 So it's like a clearing away of the association

58:39.360 --> 58:42.860
 between the person, place, or thing and that threat reflex.

58:42.860 --> 58:46.620
 But even after that's occurred,

58:46.620 --> 58:50.740
 there's an essential need to relearn a new narrative.

58:50.740 --> 58:53.700
 Why is there essential need to relearn a new narrative

58:53.700 --> 58:56.320
 or create a new association?

58:56.320 --> 58:59.340
 Well, that has to do with that fear reflex circuitry.

58:59.340 --> 59:02.940
 As you recall, there are outputs to areas of the brain

59:02.940 --> 59:06.220
 that are associated with dopamine release and reinforcement.

59:06.220 --> 59:08.980
 And that we now know offers the capacity

59:08.980 --> 59:10.760
 for these fear circuits and these circuits

59:10.760 --> 59:14.880
 that underlie trauma to be mapped onto new experiences

59:14.880 --> 59:18.460
 that are of positive association.

59:18.460 --> 59:20.340
 So I'm going to give a kind of basic example.

59:20.340 --> 59:22.320
 It's a kind of a silly example,

59:22.320 --> 59:24.940
 but I'm giving it as a template

59:24.940 --> 59:28.540
 for what could be any number of other different examples.

59:28.540 --> 59:32.020
 Example I'll give is let's say a kid is biking

59:32.020 --> 59:35.140
 to play soccer, soccer practice,

59:35.140 --> 59:38.660
 and they get into a bad car accident, okay?

59:38.660 --> 59:42.180
 Terrible thing to happen, but they survive, they recover.

59:42.180 --> 59:45.420
 And somehow, and we really don't know why

59:45.420 --> 59:48.900
 certain fear memories get wired in more broadly

59:48.900 --> 59:50.300
 or more narrowly.

59:50.300 --> 59:54.080
 Somehow this kid just doesn't even want to bicycle anymore.

59:54.080 --> 59:55.620
 And they actually don't even want to play sports.

59:55.620 --> 59:57.380
 And they actually just don't want to go anywhere.

59:57.380 --> 59:58.580
 They're kind of isolating

59:58.580 --> 1:00:01.000
 and not interacting with friends very much at all.

1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:02.260
 It's a pretty broad response.

1:00:02.260 --> 1:00:03.660
 It didn't have to be that way.

1:00:03.660 --> 1:00:06.820
 Some kids would just decide they don't want to cycle anymore

1:00:06.820 --> 1:00:08.520
 down that particular street.

1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:12.140
 Well, the process of retelling the narrative

1:00:12.140 --> 1:00:15.460
 to a clinician would allow an extinction

1:00:15.460 --> 1:00:17.940
 of the fear response, right?

1:00:17.940 --> 1:00:19.400
 So a reduction in the heart rate,

1:00:19.400 --> 1:00:20.900
 a reduction in the narrowing of focus,

1:00:20.900 --> 1:00:23.680
 a reduction in all the things that we consider fear.

1:00:23.680 --> 1:00:26.540
 But a really good cognitive behavioral therapist

1:00:26.540 --> 1:00:29.280
 or somebody that understands the neuroscience

1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:32.440
 of fear and trauma would understand

1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:34.240
 that that's not sufficient.

1:00:34.240 --> 1:00:37.160
 That's what's really important is that this child,

1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:39.980
 this hypothetical child relearn a new narrative

1:00:39.980 --> 1:00:43.220
 that they don't just manage to bike to soccer practice

1:00:43.220 --> 1:00:45.160
 or manage to spend time with friends,

1:00:45.160 --> 1:00:48.060
 but that they actually start wiring

1:00:48.060 --> 1:00:52.860
 in new positive associations with biking to practice,

1:00:52.860 --> 1:00:55.280
 with playing soccer, with social events.

1:00:55.280 --> 1:00:58.260
 And this is the somewhat surprising feature of this

1:00:58.260 --> 1:01:00.300
 and that they link that back

1:01:00.300 --> 1:01:02.660
 to that early traumatic experience.

1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:05.420
 That it's not just that they're replacing

1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:07.260
 a bad experience and memory

1:01:07.260 --> 1:01:09.180
 with a good experience and memory,

1:01:09.180 --> 1:01:11.740
 but they're actually holding in mind

1:01:11.740 --> 1:01:14.800
 in these top-down narrative circuits, if you will,

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:16.180
 they're holding in mind,

1:01:16.180 --> 1:01:19.420
 ah, I'm not just biking to soccer practice.

1:01:19.420 --> 1:01:20.900
 I'm actually biking to soccer practice

1:01:20.900 --> 1:01:23.440
 and I'm enjoying it despite the fact

1:01:23.440 --> 1:01:25.940
 that I was in a bad car accident,

1:01:25.940 --> 1:01:28.580
 despite the fact that two months ago or two years ago

1:01:28.580 --> 1:01:31.860
 or maybe even 10 years ago, I couldn't even leave my room

1:01:31.860 --> 1:01:33.980
 or I didn't want to associate with anybody.

1:01:33.980 --> 1:01:37.420
 So the building up of the positive associations are key.

1:01:37.420 --> 1:01:40.140
 And the linking of those positive associations

1:01:40.140 --> 1:01:43.780
 with the earlier traumatic event is key

1:01:43.780 --> 1:01:45.580
 for the following reason.

1:01:45.580 --> 1:01:48.680
 The top-down circuitry from the prefrontal cortex

1:01:48.680 --> 1:01:51.840
 to this threat reflex circuit

1:01:51.840 --> 1:01:55.220
 is not like the other connections in that circuit.

1:01:55.220 --> 1:01:56.820
 The other connections in that circuit

1:01:56.820 --> 1:01:59.940
 are what we call glutamatergic and excitatory.

1:01:59.940 --> 1:02:02.800
 They are all about activating other neurons,

1:02:02.800 --> 1:02:04.740
 like a chain reaction, one neuron activates,

1:02:04.740 --> 1:02:07.040
 the next activates, the next dominoes falling.

1:02:08.740 --> 1:02:13.740
 These top-down circuits that feed into the threat reflex

1:02:13.780 --> 1:02:18.180
 and all its parts is what we call inhibitory.

1:02:18.180 --> 1:02:23.180
 It tends to prevent activation of those given circuitries.

1:02:23.700 --> 1:02:26.300
 It tends to prevent activation of the threat reflex.

1:02:26.300 --> 1:02:28.140
 So it's acting as a break.

1:02:28.140 --> 1:02:30.740
 And so when we think of positive experiences

1:02:30.740 --> 1:02:33.420
 being associated with what was previously

1:02:33.420 --> 1:02:35.260
 a negative experience,

1:02:35.260 --> 1:02:36.980
 we're not talking about forgetting

1:02:36.980 --> 1:02:38.500
 that the car accident was horrible

1:02:38.500 --> 1:02:42.060
 or forgetting that the assault was absolutely dreadful.

1:02:42.060 --> 1:02:46.500
 We're talking about attaching a new positive memory

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:51.500
 to the circuitry so that the previous fear response

1:02:51.620 --> 1:02:55.780
 is far less likely to occur and that it remains extinguished.

1:02:55.780 --> 1:02:57.740
 So just to make sure this is absolutely clear,

1:02:57.740 --> 1:02:59.860
 there's a first step which involves retelling

1:02:59.860 --> 1:03:03.060
 and reliving in order to extinguish the fear and the trauma,

1:03:03.060 --> 1:03:05.300
 to reduce the amplitude of the response.

1:03:05.300 --> 1:03:10.300
 Then there's a need to replace or attach positive experiences

1:03:10.540 --> 1:03:13.700
 to the earlier what would be traumatic response.

1:03:13.700 --> 1:03:15.620
 The extinction has to go first.

1:03:15.620 --> 1:03:16.800
 This is key.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:18.520
 You can't simply say, oh, you know,

1:03:18.520 --> 1:03:20.420
 the car accident was actually a good thing

1:03:20.420 --> 1:03:23.300
 because I stayed home a lot that year and I got to study.

1:03:23.300 --> 1:03:26.420
 You can tell yourself that, and that could also be true,

1:03:26.420 --> 1:03:29.540
 but that won't necessarily and probably won't

1:03:29.540 --> 1:03:33.340
 eliminate the fear or the traumatic association

1:03:33.340 --> 1:03:34.620
 of the car accident.

1:03:34.620 --> 1:03:38.060
 And again, I'm using car accident as a general example

1:03:38.060 --> 1:03:39.860
 or generic example here.

1:03:39.860 --> 1:03:41.460
 Okay, so there's a three-part process.

1:03:41.460 --> 1:03:43.460
 One, diminish the old experience

1:03:43.460 --> 1:03:45.540
 through repetitive narrative.

1:03:45.540 --> 1:03:49.980
 And almost inevitably, the initial repetition of that

1:03:49.980 --> 1:03:52.860
 is going to be very high amplitude and quite troubling,

1:03:52.860 --> 1:03:54.420
 but over time it will reduce, right?

1:03:54.420 --> 1:03:57.580
 You're turning the terrible, really upsetting story

1:03:57.580 --> 1:03:59.920
 into a terrible, boring story.

1:04:00.920 --> 1:04:02.260
 That's the extinction process.

1:04:02.260 --> 1:04:04.440
 Then there's a relearning of a new narrative

1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:06.380
 that includes some sort of sense of reward,

1:04:06.380 --> 1:04:09.080
 and that sense of reward has to be tacked back

1:04:09.080 --> 1:04:11.840
 onto the traumatic event

1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:13.820
 or what was previously a traumatic event.

1:04:13.820 --> 1:04:15.960
 And that is all through narrative.

1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:17.620
 It's all through cognition.

1:04:17.620 --> 1:04:19.720
 And I think this is a very important point.

1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:22.940
 Oftentimes I think we tend to undervalue

1:04:23.940 --> 1:04:25.820
 the importance of rationalization

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:27.960
 and of story and of narrative.

1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:31.460
 But the prefrontal cortex is this amazing capacity

1:04:31.460 --> 1:04:34.860
 of our brain real estate to create meaning,

1:04:34.860 --> 1:04:37.340
 to attach meaning and purpose to things

1:04:37.340 --> 1:04:39.560
 that otherwise are just reflexive.

1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:41.380
 And in the example of an ice bath,

1:04:41.380 --> 1:04:42.840
 it might be a little trivial.

1:04:42.840 --> 1:04:44.580
 In the example of the kid with the car accident,

1:04:44.580 --> 1:04:46.620
 it becomes a little more relevant.

1:04:46.620 --> 1:04:50.620
 And in the example of things like people surviving genocide

1:04:50.620 --> 1:04:55.620
 or attaching stories of great victory

1:04:56.440 --> 1:05:00.660
 to what were previously thought of as stories of great loss

1:05:00.660 --> 1:05:03.740
 of time, of people, of any number of things,

1:05:03.740 --> 1:05:07.420
 that process of narrative is one of the major ways

1:05:07.420 --> 1:05:09.700
 that the human brain rewires itself.

1:05:09.700 --> 1:05:12.560
 Narrative should not be undervalued

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:16.180
 as a tool for relieving fear and trauma.

1:05:16.180 --> 1:05:20.500
 In fact, narrative is one of the best and most potent ways

1:05:20.500 --> 1:05:22.780
 that we can rewire our fear circuitry

1:05:22.780 --> 1:05:25.700
 and that indeed we can form completely new relationships

1:05:25.700 --> 1:05:27.180
 to things over time.

1:05:27.180 --> 1:05:30.580
 So basically narrative should not be undervalued

1:05:30.580 --> 1:05:33.460
 as a tool to rewire our nervous system,

1:05:33.460 --> 1:05:36.100
 but it has to be engaged in the correct sequence.

1:05:36.100 --> 1:05:38.820
 And that correct sequence is first extinction,

1:05:38.820 --> 1:05:42.720
 then relearning a new narrative with positive associations

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:44.840
 and attaching those positive associations

1:05:44.840 --> 1:05:48.020
 to the formerly traumatic or fearful event.

1:05:48.020 --> 1:05:50.100
 Now I mentioned prolonged exposure therapy,

1:05:50.100 --> 1:05:53.020
 cognitive processing and cognitive behavioral therapy.

1:05:53.020 --> 1:05:54.520
 For those of you that are seeking relief

1:05:54.520 --> 1:05:57.660
 from fear and traumatic events,

1:05:57.660 --> 1:06:02.060
 you can look up licensed clinicians that can carry out

1:06:02.060 --> 1:06:04.860
 those one or several of those types of therapies.

1:06:04.860 --> 1:06:07.740
 I get a lot of questions about other forms of therapy.

1:06:07.740 --> 1:06:11.820
 One of the ones that comes up a lot is so-called EMDR,

1:06:11.820 --> 1:06:14.460
 eye movement desensitization reprocessing

1:06:14.460 --> 1:06:17.840
 developed by Francine Shapiro in the 80s.

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:19.780
 Eye movement desensitization reprocessing

1:06:19.780 --> 1:06:22.680
 involves moving the eyes side to side

1:06:22.680 --> 1:06:26.000
 while recounting a traumatic or fearful narrative,

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.460
 typically with a clinician present.

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:30.680
 Why would that work?

1:06:30.680 --> 1:06:35.500
 Well, basically when I first heard about EMDR

1:06:35.500 --> 1:06:37.220
 from my stance as a vision scientist,

1:06:37.220 --> 1:06:39.020
 I thought the whole thing was kind of crazy

1:06:39.020 --> 1:06:40.620
 and half-baked frankly.

1:06:40.620 --> 1:06:41.780
 I heard these theories that,

1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:44.560
 oh, it recreates the eye movements

1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:47.160
 in rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep.

1:06:48.080 --> 1:06:49.380
 And that's completely false.

1:06:49.380 --> 1:06:50.580
 It does not.

1:06:50.580 --> 1:06:54.660
 I heard the argument EMDR activates

1:06:54.660 --> 1:06:55.920
 both sides of the brain,

1:06:55.920 --> 1:06:57.300
 which I guess hypothetically

1:06:57.300 --> 1:07:00.140
 was thought to be important somehow.

1:07:01.540 --> 1:07:03.860
 And frankly, there's no evidence whatsoever

1:07:03.860 --> 1:07:05.960
 that EMDR activates both sides of the brain

1:07:05.960 --> 1:07:07.420
 in a way that's beneficial.

1:07:07.420 --> 1:07:09.140
 I mean, by looking from side to side,

1:07:09.140 --> 1:07:11.300
 just because of the way that binocular visual circuits

1:07:11.300 --> 1:07:12.640
 are organized, it will do that.

1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:15.360
 But it never made any sense to me why EMDR would work

1:07:15.360 --> 1:07:18.940
 until several years ago when I saw,

1:07:18.940 --> 1:07:22.300
 because I reviewed no fewer than five papers,

1:07:22.300 --> 1:07:24.500
 some in animal models, others in humans,

1:07:25.820 --> 1:07:28.020
 looking at lateral eye movements,

1:07:28.020 --> 1:07:30.100
 meaning eye movements from side to side with eyes open,

1:07:30.100 --> 1:07:31.540
 not eyes up or down.

1:07:31.540 --> 1:07:34.580
 And what was observed in these experiments,

1:07:34.580 --> 1:07:35.780
 in all of them actually,

1:07:35.780 --> 1:07:39.820
 all five of those papers was a dramatic reduction

1:07:39.820 --> 1:07:43.460
 in the activation and actually an inhibition,

1:07:43.460 --> 1:07:48.040
 a suppression of the fear or threat reflex circuitry,

1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:50.140
 which was a jaw dropper for me.

1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:53.000
 I thought, wow, actually it was a jaw dropper,

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.720
 eye widener for me.

1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:56.400
 I thought, oh my goodness,

1:07:56.400 --> 1:08:00.340
 maybe this EMDR stuff works according to some mechanism

1:08:00.340 --> 1:08:01.520
 and maybe this is the mechanism.

1:08:01.520 --> 1:08:03.580
 And indeed many laboratories, not mine,

1:08:03.580 --> 1:08:05.740
 but many laboratories are now pursuing that idea

1:08:05.740 --> 1:08:07.460
 and it's looking very likely.

1:08:07.460 --> 1:08:09.180
 Why would that happen?

1:08:09.180 --> 1:08:10.740
 Well, just very briefly,

1:08:10.740 --> 1:08:13.940
 a lateralized eye movements of the sort that I'm describing

1:08:13.940 --> 1:08:15.220
 and I'm moving my hand like this,

1:08:15.220 --> 1:08:16.260
 but I'll just do it with my eyes,

1:08:16.260 --> 1:08:19.380
 even though it's a little embarrassing to do that

1:08:19.380 --> 1:08:20.380
 because I know it looks strange,

1:08:20.380 --> 1:08:22.860
 I don't mind because I'm doing EMDR

1:08:22.860 --> 1:08:26.620
 and EMDR reduces activation of the amygdala

1:08:26.620 --> 1:08:29.140
 and related circuitries, which reduces anxiety

1:08:29.140 --> 1:08:33.700
 and reduces the amplitude of the threat reflex,

1:08:33.700 --> 1:08:36.480
 reduces sympathetic autonomic arousal.

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:40.260
 In other words, we feel calmer or we feel less alert,

1:08:40.260 --> 1:08:43.380
 less stressed when moving our eyes from side to side.

1:08:43.380 --> 1:08:45.940
 And the just so story about this

1:08:45.940 --> 1:08:48.660
 is that these are the sorts of eye movements that we do

1:08:48.660 --> 1:08:50.860
 when we are ambulating, moving through space,

1:08:50.860 --> 1:08:53.060
 through some sort of self-generated motion.

1:08:53.060 --> 1:08:58.060
 And one can make up a pretty reasonable story

1:08:58.340 --> 1:09:01.080
 in the evolutionary context or ethological context

1:09:01.080 --> 1:09:04.760
 that forward movement and fear

1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:07.100
 are generally incompatible with one another.

1:09:07.100 --> 1:09:08.500
 That generally a fear response

1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:10.540
 involves a freezing or a retreating.

1:09:10.540 --> 1:09:11.640
 Some people will advance,

1:09:11.640 --> 1:09:14.540
 but that's usually a trained advance in response to fear.

1:09:14.540 --> 1:09:16.020
 So first responders and so forth.

1:09:16.020 --> 1:09:18.600
 Most people freeze or retreat when they're afraid.

1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:20.660
 Forward movement generates these eye movements.

1:09:20.660 --> 1:09:24.920
 It does seem to suppress activation of this threat reflex

1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:26.740
 and the amygdala in particular.

1:09:26.740 --> 1:09:31.740
 So for the many EMDR practitioners out there,

1:09:31.980 --> 1:09:35.420
 these papers, I think are a great celebration.

1:09:35.420 --> 1:09:39.540
 And I think there is now increasing excitement about EMDR

1:09:39.540 --> 1:09:42.580
 in the psychiatric and psychological community

1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:46.960
 for its utility for treating fear, trauma, and PTSD.

1:09:47.780 --> 1:09:50.860
 However, I should point out that in discussing EMDR

1:09:50.860 --> 1:09:53.440
 with various colleagues of mine at Stanford and elsewhere,

1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:57.080
 I was told that EMDR has been shown to be beneficial

1:09:57.080 --> 1:10:00.300
 in particular for single event type traumas

1:10:00.300 --> 1:10:01.960
 or fearful experiences,

1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:05.700
 not so much for relieving the trauma

1:10:05.700 --> 1:10:07.740
 or feelings of fear associated, for instance,

1:10:07.740 --> 1:10:10.760
 with an entire bad marriage or an entire childhood,

1:10:10.760 --> 1:10:13.780
 but more for single, more acute events

1:10:13.780 --> 1:10:17.420
 that can be described within a very kind of brief narrative.

1:10:18.420 --> 1:10:22.220
 Brief, not necessarily in time, but that the car accident,

1:10:22.220 --> 1:10:24.780
 the bad interaction with another individual,

1:10:24.780 --> 1:10:27.420
 the assault, God forbid, these sorts of things.

1:10:27.420 --> 1:10:31.100
 And I realize we're down in the weeds of topics

1:10:31.100 --> 1:10:32.660
 that are unpleasant.

1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:35.020
 And so I have great sensitivity to that,

1:10:35.020 --> 1:10:36.900
 but I think it's also important that we be realistic

1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:39.060
 about the kinds of things that traumatize people.

1:10:39.060 --> 1:10:42.160
 So is EMDR useful?

1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:46.220
 Well, it seems like it works for these single event

1:10:46.220 --> 1:10:49.000
 or kind of constrained event type traumas

1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.620
 that people can describe while moving their eyes

1:10:51.620 --> 1:10:53.900
 from side to side, generally in the presence of a clinician.

1:10:53.900 --> 1:10:58.540
 However, if we think back to the model of how you extinguish

1:10:58.540 --> 1:11:00.860
 and then replace a trauma or fear,

1:11:00.860 --> 1:11:03.580
 remember you have to diminish the old experience,

1:11:03.580 --> 1:11:07.820
 the amplitude of that, that's the extinguish portion.

1:11:07.820 --> 1:11:09.740
 Then you need to relearn a new narrative

1:11:09.740 --> 1:11:13.780
 and attach reward to the old traumatic event.

1:11:13.780 --> 1:11:18.520
 EMDR only really taps into the extinction

1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:23.420
 of the physiological response to the old experience.

1:11:23.420 --> 1:11:26.300
 I'm sure that there are EMDR practitioners out there

1:11:26.300 --> 1:11:27.880
 that are thinking about the attaching

1:11:27.880 --> 1:11:29.900
 of the new narrative and reward,

1:11:29.900 --> 1:11:32.620
 but there I've heard less

1:11:32.620 --> 1:11:35.880
 and I've seen fewer peer-reviewed papers on that.

1:11:35.880 --> 1:11:37.320
 So let's think about this logically.

1:11:37.320 --> 1:11:39.580
 Let's say, and indeed it's the case,

1:11:39.580 --> 1:11:41.820
 that sitting down in a chair,

1:11:41.820 --> 1:11:43.540
 moving eyes side to side deliberately

1:11:43.540 --> 1:11:45.620
 for some period of time reduces activation

1:11:45.620 --> 1:11:46.780
 of the threat reflex.

1:11:48.420 --> 1:11:51.340
 I, or the patient in this case,

1:11:51.340 --> 1:11:55.780
 recites or repeats over and over the traumatic event

1:11:55.780 --> 1:11:57.380
 or the fearful event.

1:11:57.380 --> 1:11:58.820
 I'm doing that in the presence

1:11:58.820 --> 1:12:03.620
 of a lower amplitude response.

1:12:03.620 --> 1:12:05.520
 Remember back to where we talked about

1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:09.220
 how the retelling works best

1:12:09.220 --> 1:12:10.840
 if the first time it's done,

1:12:10.840 --> 1:12:13.060
 there's a huge amplitude response.

1:12:13.060 --> 1:12:15.260
 And then with each successive repeat,

1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:18.500
 that response, the threat response gets lower and lower.

1:12:18.500 --> 1:12:20.500
 With EMDR, you're sort of short circuiting.

1:12:20.500 --> 1:12:22.260
 You're kind of sneaking around the corner

1:12:22.260 --> 1:12:24.100
 of that high amplitude response.

1:12:24.100 --> 1:12:26.660
 And so it's taking a somewhat different approach

1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:30.700
 of trying to extinguish the bad feelings

1:12:31.580 --> 1:12:34.340
 in body and mind associated with an experience

1:12:34.340 --> 1:12:38.020
 by reducing the physiological response.

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:39.060
 So it's somewhat different.

1:12:39.060 --> 1:12:41.280
 And at least to my knowledge,

1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:43.380
 and EMDR practitioners, please correct me,

1:12:43.380 --> 1:12:44.880
 but at least to my knowledge,

1:12:44.880 --> 1:12:48.220
 there isn't an active component to EMDR

1:12:48.220 --> 1:12:52.260
 of relearning a new narrative and attaching reward.

1:12:52.260 --> 1:12:55.080
 Now, reward and attaching reward

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:59.500
 requires a somewhat high amplitude sympathetic arousal.

1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:03.340
 It requires a feeling of a victory, which is arousal.

1:13:03.340 --> 1:13:05.460
 Okay, it's positive arousal, not negative arousal,

1:13:05.460 --> 1:13:06.660
 but it is arousal.

1:13:06.660 --> 1:13:08.220
 So I'm not focusing on this

1:13:08.220 --> 1:13:11.420
 to try and diminish the potential impact of EMDR.

1:13:11.420 --> 1:13:14.900
 I know many people have achieved great relief from EMDR,

1:13:14.900 --> 1:13:17.380
 but it doesn't tap into all the aspects

1:13:17.380 --> 1:13:19.420
 of the extinction and relearning

1:13:19.420 --> 1:13:20.680
 that we talked about previously.

1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:23.260
 And therefore, I think on its own,

1:13:23.260 --> 1:13:24.620
 at least in many cases,

1:13:24.620 --> 1:13:29.280
 is unlikely to be a complete therapy for fear and trauma.

1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:30.200
 If there are people out there

1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:32.340
 who've had terrific results with EMDR,

1:13:32.340 --> 1:13:34.560
 please let us know in the comments section.

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:36.420
 On YouTube would be the ideal place.

1:13:36.420 --> 1:13:38.820
 If you've had bad experiences with EMDR

1:13:38.820 --> 1:13:41.140
 or it didn't work for you, also let us know.

1:13:41.140 --> 1:13:43.100
 I think that EMDR practitioners,

1:13:43.100 --> 1:13:44.380
 like most practitioners

1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:46.220
 in the psychiatric and psychological space,

1:13:46.220 --> 1:13:48.720
 are eager to expand their practices

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:50.140
 in order to make them more effective

1:13:50.140 --> 1:13:54.260
 rather than clinging ardently to something

1:13:54.260 --> 1:13:55.660
 that perhaps is incomplete

1:13:55.660 --> 1:13:57.320
 or that doesn't work for certain individuals.

1:13:57.320 --> 1:14:00.020
 So I think they would appreciate that feedback, as would I.

1:14:00.020 --> 1:14:01.060
 So as I mentioned before,

1:14:01.060 --> 1:14:02.840
 most of these therapies are done in conjunction

1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:07.840
 with a skilled, often one would hope, credentialed clinician.

1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:11.140
 There are many people, however,

1:14:11.140 --> 1:14:12.780
 that don't have access to that

1:14:12.780 --> 1:14:15.160
 or who are working through stuff.

1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:17.100
 They have things in their past

1:14:17.100 --> 1:14:19.140
 that are very uncomfortable to them.

1:14:19.140 --> 1:14:20.900
 And I'm aware that many people

1:14:20.900 --> 1:14:23.260
 are working through those things through journaling,

1:14:23.260 --> 1:14:24.840
 through talking to a friend,

1:14:25.980 --> 1:14:27.220
 through any number of different

1:14:27.220 --> 1:14:29.780
 sort of non-traditional approaches.

1:14:29.780 --> 1:14:32.420
 One thing that really pertains to everybody

1:14:32.420 --> 1:14:36.580
 who's working through fear and trauma of any kind

1:14:36.580 --> 1:14:38.920
 is the importance of social connection

1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:41.540
 as it relates to the chemical systems

1:14:41.540 --> 1:14:44.420
 and the neural circuits associated with fear and trauma.

1:14:44.420 --> 1:14:47.460
 And this is a emerging literature in neuroscience

1:14:47.460 --> 1:14:48.940
 that is really a beautiful one

1:14:48.940 --> 1:14:51.800
 because it's a very conserved biology.

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:54.660
 We see it, believe it or not, in flies, in fruit flies,

1:14:54.660 --> 1:14:56.700
 a commonly used model system,

1:14:56.700 --> 1:14:59.880
 in mice and indeed in humans as well.

1:14:59.880 --> 1:15:03.780
 And this is the work of David Anderson's group at Caltech,

1:15:03.780 --> 1:15:08.740
 of again, of Dr. Ressler's group at Harvard Medical

1:15:08.740 --> 1:15:10.500
 and elsewhere, of course.

1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:14.280
 And this is the work as it relates to tachykinin.

1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:19.240
 Tachykinin is a very interesting molecule in our brain.

1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:24.240
 And it turns out that tachykinin is activated in neurons

1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:26.400
 of what's called the central amygdala

1:15:26.400 --> 1:15:28.060
 and some nearby structures.

1:15:28.060 --> 1:15:32.300
 So really smack dab within the middle of this threat reflex

1:15:33.720 --> 1:15:38.720
 very soon after some traumatic or fear inducing event occurs

1:15:39.060 --> 1:15:42.020
 and it actually sets in motion a number of other things,

1:15:42.020 --> 1:15:46.760
 including changes in gene expression and potentiation,

1:15:46.760 --> 1:15:48.300
 meaning long-term potentiation,

1:15:48.300 --> 1:15:51.980
 activation of NMDA receptors and so on in the circuits

1:15:51.980 --> 1:15:55.420
 that reinforce that fearful or traumatic experience.

1:15:55.420 --> 1:15:57.220
 Now, what's interesting about tachykinin

1:15:57.220 --> 1:16:00.140
 is also that it's been shown to lead to

1:16:01.020 --> 1:16:03.200
 low to moderate levels of anxiety

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:07.300
 and even kind of aggression, irritability.

1:16:07.300 --> 1:16:11.240
 Tachykinin levels are further increased

1:16:11.240 --> 1:16:13.620
 by social isolation.

1:16:13.620 --> 1:16:17.040
 And that social isolation is oftentimes

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:21.420
 what can exacerbate preexisting traumas or fearful events.

1:16:21.420 --> 1:16:23.660
 And in a kind of beautiful symmetry

1:16:23.660 --> 1:16:26.300
 to that kind of dark and depressing story,

1:16:27.340 --> 1:16:30.800
 social connection with people that we trust,

1:16:30.800 --> 1:16:32.680
 and it doesn't have to be direct physical contact,

1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:34.540
 but just social connection,

1:16:34.540 --> 1:16:38.780
 conversing with, sharing a meal with,

1:16:38.780 --> 1:16:41.200
 it could be physical touch if that's appropriate,

1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:45.660
 those sorts of connections actually serve to reduce

1:16:45.660 --> 1:16:48.940
 the effectiveness or even the levels of tachykinin.

1:16:48.940 --> 1:16:50.980
 So the important point here is that

1:16:50.980 --> 1:16:54.860
 trauma is traumatic in and of itself.

1:16:54.860 --> 1:16:58.320
 Fearful events are hard in and of themselves.

1:16:58.320 --> 1:16:59.720
 And if people are working through them,

1:16:59.720 --> 1:17:03.100
 either through clinical work or through individual work,

1:17:03.100 --> 1:17:04.880
 it is important.

1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:09.000
 And ideally one would still be trying to access

1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:13.340
 social connection outside of that specific work

1:17:13.340 --> 1:17:14.600
 related to the trauma.

1:17:14.600 --> 1:17:17.000
 Now, it doesn't necessarily have to be outside of that.

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:18.600
 For instance, if you are,

1:17:18.600 --> 1:17:20.920
 you have a good relationship with a clinician or therapist

1:17:20.920 --> 1:17:22.680
 to the point where there's real trust

1:17:22.680 --> 1:17:25.900
 and you feel a social connection with them, wonderful.

1:17:25.900 --> 1:17:26.740
 But for many people,

1:17:26.740 --> 1:17:29.820
 they have a more transactional relationship

1:17:29.820 --> 1:17:34.080
 to the EMDR practitioner or to their therapist,

1:17:34.080 --> 1:17:36.000
 or they're working through things on their own.

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.360
 And it's really important to understand

1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:40.880
 that regular social connection,

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:43.920
 trusting social connection of any kind

1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:46.320
 is going to be very beneficial for that process.

1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:49.280
 And so this is not kind of just hand wavy,

1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:52.240
 new agey stuff like, oh, you need social connection.

1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:56.440
 There's a actual neurochemical basis for social isolation

1:17:56.440 --> 1:17:59.360
 that has an amplifying effect on fear and trauma.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:03.160
 And there is a neurochemical basis for the relief

1:18:03.160 --> 1:18:06.000
 from fear and trauma and isolation.

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.600
 And in the ideal circumstance,

1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:09.820
 one is working through these traumas and fears

1:18:09.820 --> 1:18:12.120
 very intensely in a very dedicated way,

1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:15.920
 but then is also engaging in the sorts of social interactions

1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:18.240
 that are going to diminish the amount of tachykinin

1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:21.180
 and going to suppress those very circuits

1:18:21.180 --> 1:18:23.280
 that would otherwise be amplified.

1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:26.600
 So next I'd like to talk about some really interesting

1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:29.680
 and almost kind of eerie scientific findings.

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:33.680
 And that's the transgenerational passage of trauma

1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:36.760
 or predisposition to fear and trauma.

1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:39.540
 This is a scientific literature that's been debated

1:18:39.540 --> 1:18:43.400
 many times over the last really 50 plus years,

1:18:43.400 --> 1:18:47.680
 but in more recent studies have really proven

1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:51.960
 that we as humans have the capacity to inherit

1:18:51.960 --> 1:18:56.020
 a predisposition to trauma or fear.

1:18:56.020 --> 1:18:57.920
 Now that doesn't necessarily mean

1:18:57.920 --> 1:19:01.520
 that we will become traumatized or experience extreme fear

1:19:01.520 --> 1:19:04.640
 just because our parents or grandparents experienced that.

1:19:04.640 --> 1:19:07.680
 It's a predisposition, it's a bias.

1:19:07.680 --> 1:19:10.920
 Let me explain the papers that focus on this

1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:12.200
 for a little bit, and then we'll talk about

1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:14.440
 what this means for each of us.

1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:17.080
 One of the most important papers in this area

1:19:17.080 --> 1:19:19.620
 comes to us from someone I mentioned earlier,

1:19:19.620 --> 1:19:21.640
 Dr. Kerry Ressler at Harvard.

1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:23.060
 And the title of the paper is

1:19:23.060 --> 1:19:27.740
 Association of FKB5 Polymorphisms and Childhood Abuse

1:19:27.740 --> 1:19:30.420
 with Risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms

1:19:30.420 --> 1:19:31.900
 in Adults.

1:19:31.900 --> 1:19:33.920
 And there are other papers as well.

1:19:34.900 --> 1:19:36.100
 Another one from the Ressler Lab,

1:19:36.100 --> 1:19:39.760
 first author Brian Dias, D-I-A-S,

1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:42.460
 Parental Olfactory Experience Influences Behavior

1:19:42.460 --> 1:19:44.840
 and Neural Structure in Subsequent Generations.

1:19:44.840 --> 1:19:46.280
 I'm going to summarize these papers

1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:48.800
 and their general contour and papers related to them,

1:19:48.800 --> 1:19:51.680
 although feel free to look up the papers I just described.

1:19:51.680 --> 1:19:53.740
 We will provide a link to them in the caption

1:19:53.740 --> 1:19:55.120
 if you'd like to go further.

1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:57.800
 But basically these explorations involve

1:19:57.800 --> 1:20:02.280
 looking at the histories of human individuals

1:20:03.380 --> 1:20:08.300
 who had trauma or abuse of some kind in their childhood,

1:20:08.300 --> 1:20:11.640
 and then looking at the likelihood of fear

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:15.540
 and PTSD type symptomology in their offspring.

1:20:15.540 --> 1:20:19.400
 And essentially what they identified is that indeed,

1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:20.840
 if you had a parent,

1:20:20.840 --> 1:20:24.100
 and there does seem to be a kind of a bias toward an effect

1:20:24.100 --> 1:20:28.060
 where if the father had abuse

1:20:29.020 --> 1:20:33.140
 and it's severe abuse or moderate abuse,

1:20:33.140 --> 1:20:38.140
 that abuse causes a change in his genetics, in his sperm,

1:20:40.100 --> 1:20:43.560
 that can be passed on to offspring,

1:20:43.560 --> 1:20:46.720
 such that the offspring have a lower threshold

1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:49.820
 to develop trauma or extreme fear

1:20:49.820 --> 1:20:51.480
 to certain types of events.

1:20:51.480 --> 1:20:55.440
 Now, what's important to point out is that predisposition

1:20:55.440 --> 1:20:59.400
 or bias is not necessarily to the same sorts of events.

1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:02.180
 It's not that the abuse itself gets passed

1:21:02.180 --> 1:21:03.960
 from one generation to the next.

1:21:03.960 --> 1:21:05.280
 It's a predisposition.

1:21:05.280 --> 1:21:09.080
 And the title of that paper mentioned FKB5,

1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:12.840
 excuse me, FKBP5 polymorphisms.

1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:17.680
 And the FKBP5 polymorphism maps

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:20.120
 to a location in the genome that's associated

1:21:20.120 --> 1:21:22.160
 with the so-called glucocorticoid system

1:21:22.160 --> 1:21:23.580
 with cortisol release.

1:21:23.580 --> 1:21:27.720
 So the predisposition that one might inherit

1:21:27.720 --> 1:21:29.820
 from having a parent, father or mother,

1:21:29.820 --> 1:21:33.240
 but stronger tendency to inherit it from the father,

1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:34.680
 who experienced abuse,

1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:36.920
 is one in which the glucocorticoid system,

1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:40.360
 the cortisol system and that HPA axis

1:21:40.360 --> 1:21:41.320
 that we talked about before,

1:21:41.320 --> 1:21:44.040
 the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis,

1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:48.560
 is sensitized or reactive in a way

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:52.080
 that sets a lower threshold to become traumatized

1:21:52.080 --> 1:21:54.360
 or very afraid of certain types of events.

1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:57.960
 But it's not unique to the specific type of abuse

1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:00.480
 that the parent experienced.

1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:02.180
 Now, this is really, really important

1:22:02.180 --> 1:22:03.440
 because a lot of times out there,

1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:06.120
 I will hear that there's passage

1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:08.740
 or transgenerational passage of actual trauma,

1:22:08.740 --> 1:22:09.920
 the specific trauma.

1:22:09.920 --> 1:22:13.480
 Now, that could be through narrative telling.

1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:16.560
 If somebody is exposed to a lot of narrative

1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:19.600
 about their parents' trauma in one form or another,

1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:21.740
 it may be that they start to internalize

1:22:21.740 --> 1:22:23.360
 some of that trauma.

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:24.920
 And there could be,

1:22:24.920 --> 1:22:26.840
 because we obviously can't rule it out,

1:22:26.840 --> 1:22:28.540
 there could be some other signatures

1:22:28.540 --> 1:22:31.840
 of prior specific traumas they get passed on to offspring.

1:22:31.840 --> 1:22:34.640
 But more likely, and certainly what these data

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:37.120
 about these polymorphisms point to,

1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:40.780
 is that what gets passed on is a propensity

1:22:40.780 --> 1:22:44.040
 for the threat reflex to get activated

1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:47.540
 and attached to a wider variety

1:22:47.540 --> 1:22:51.960
 or to less intense types of inputs and experiences.

1:22:51.960 --> 1:22:54.320
 And the important point to take away from this

1:22:54.320 --> 1:22:58.800
 is that it's not some magical, mysterious,

1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:01.480
 and mystical thing that's being transplanted

1:23:01.480 --> 1:23:03.120
 from parent to child.

1:23:03.120 --> 1:23:08.120
 It's a gene or it's a modification in a set of genes

1:23:08.220 --> 1:23:11.520
 that gives a heightened level of responsivity

1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:13.240
 to fearful type events,

1:23:13.240 --> 1:23:15.000
 or even a heightened level of responsivity

1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:18.240
 such that things that wouldn't be fear-inducing

1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:20.600
 or trauma-inducing to certain individuals

1:23:20.600 --> 1:23:23.520
 can trigger fear and trauma in these children

1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:25.980
 that inherit this particular gene.

1:23:25.980 --> 1:23:29.040
 Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that they are fated

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:31.120
 to forever be traumatized or live in fear.

1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:32.360
 That's simply not the case.

1:23:32.360 --> 1:23:34.660
 It's just a genetic predisposition.

1:23:34.660 --> 1:23:37.760
 Regardless of whether or not you had a parent or parents

1:23:37.760 --> 1:23:39.740
 that were traumatized or not,

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.800
 there's no evidence, at least as far as I'm aware,

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:47.120
 that the treatments for trauma should be any different.

1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:49.520
 As far as I know, there aren't gene therapies

1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:52.620
 currently aimed at these particular variants

1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:55.880
 like FKBP5 and so forth

1:23:55.880 --> 1:24:00.560
 that could reverse those particular genetic underpinnings

1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:03.480
 of the trauma predisposition.

1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:06.720
 So this transgenerational passage of trauma,

1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:09.700
 I think is extremely interesting in large part

1:24:09.700 --> 1:24:11.560
 because it brings us back to this idea

1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:16.560
 that the threat reflex is part of a larger sensory system.

1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:19.160
 Normally we think of seeing as a sensory system

1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:21.000
 or hearing as a sensory system,

1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.600
 but the threat detection and threat learning system,

1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:28.360
 the fear learning system is in many ways a sensory system.

1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:30.960
 It's just a sensory system that is very generic

1:24:30.960 --> 1:24:31.780
 in its response.

1:24:31.780 --> 1:24:33.400
 That generic response again is good

1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:35.120
 because it allows for flexibility,

1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:38.820
 but it's bad because it reduces specificity, right?

1:24:38.820 --> 1:24:41.920
 We can essentially become fearful or traumatized by anything

1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:43.400
 if the circuit gets activated

1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:46.840
 and these particular children inherit a predisposition

1:24:46.840 --> 1:24:50.420
 for more things and less intense things to traumatize them.

1:24:50.420 --> 1:24:52.580
 In a few minutes, we are going to discuss

1:24:52.580 --> 1:24:54.180
 some of the behavioral treatments,

1:24:54.180 --> 1:24:56.880
 including some really new exciting protocols

1:24:56.880 --> 1:24:59.440
 for dealing with fear and trauma.

1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:01.140
 But for a few minutes,

1:25:01.140 --> 1:25:03.020
 I'd like to discuss some of the drug treatments

1:25:03.020 --> 1:25:06.120
 that are starting to emerge as potential therapeutics,

1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:08.500
 in particular for PTSD.

1:25:08.500 --> 1:25:10.840
 The two drug treatments I'd like to focus on

1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:13.600
 are ketamine assisted psychotherapy

1:25:13.600 --> 1:25:17.380
 and MDMA assisted psychotherapy.

1:25:17.380 --> 1:25:20.240
 Currently ketamine assisted psychotherapy is legal.

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:23.080
 It is approved provided it is prescribed

1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:26.320
 by a board certified physician in the United States.

1:25:26.320 --> 1:25:29.920
 I'm not certain about other areas of the world.

1:25:29.920 --> 1:25:34.400
 MDMA, also sometimes called ecstasy therapy

1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:37.060
 is in clinical trials in the US,

1:25:37.060 --> 1:25:40.840
 it is still an illegal drug to possess or to sell.

1:25:40.840 --> 1:25:43.200
 So I want to be very clear about that.

1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:47.400
 However, MDMA is being explored as a potential therapeutic

1:25:47.400 --> 1:25:50.520
 for PTSD and other forms of trauma.

1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:53.000
 And of course, ketamine and MDMA

1:25:53.000 --> 1:25:56.200
 are also both being explored for chronic depression,

1:25:56.200 --> 1:26:00.320
 eating disorders and a number of other psychiatric disorders.

1:26:00.320 --> 1:26:02.840
 But for the moment, I would just like to touch on

1:26:03.960 --> 1:26:08.280
 ketamine and MDMA as they relate to the fear circuitry

1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:11.240
 and trauma circuitry that we've described

1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:14.020
 in the early part of the episode and throughout the episode,

1:26:14.020 --> 1:26:17.600
 because I think that in viewing them through that lens,

1:26:17.600 --> 1:26:19.220
 we can gain some additional insight

1:26:19.220 --> 1:26:22.040
 into how they might be providing the sorts of relief

1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:23.640
 that some of the early clinical studies

1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:24.960
 are starting to point to.

1:26:24.960 --> 1:26:28.640
 Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic.

1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:30.800
 That's right, it's a dissociative anesthetic.

1:26:30.800 --> 1:26:35.360
 Its main function is to create a state of dissociation.

1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:37.200
 And I've never taken ketamine personally,

1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:40.280
 so I can't describe the experience of it.

1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:43.000
 But a colleague of mine in psychiatry

1:26:43.980 --> 1:26:47.980
 shared their experience with a patient's experience of it

1:26:47.980 --> 1:26:51.500
 as making that patient feel as if quote,

1:26:51.500 --> 1:26:56.200
 they were getting out of the cockpit of a plane,

1:26:56.200 --> 1:26:58.800
 but that they were observing themselves doing it.

1:26:58.800 --> 1:26:59.740
 And this was of course,

1:26:59.740 --> 1:27:03.220
 during a approved therapeutic session

1:27:03.220 --> 1:27:04.920
 that they were doing this.

1:27:04.920 --> 1:27:07.880
 And they were in some sort of intense visualization

1:27:07.880 --> 1:27:09.480
 about a traumatic experience.

1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:11.480
 They were describing some of their depressive symptoms

1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:12.860
 as well as the trauma.

1:27:12.860 --> 1:27:16.580
 And the narrative that they basically created

1:27:16.580 --> 1:27:19.340
 or took away from this, and that was relayed to me,

1:27:19.340 --> 1:27:21.600
 was one in which the patient felt like

1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:23.240
 they were in their own body,

1:27:23.240 --> 1:27:26.200
 but they were also viewing their own body from the outside.

1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:29.200
 So dissociative, in other words.

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:31.120
 Again, I've never had this experience.

1:27:31.120 --> 1:27:34.920
 Some of you may have with ketamine or through other means,

1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:36.760
 but we might want to just take a moment

1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:39.480
 and think about what ketamine actually does

1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:42.080
 and what dissociation actually does

1:27:42.080 --> 1:27:43.560
 at the level of neural circuits.

1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:46.580
 And for that, we can look to this really beautiful paper

1:27:46.580 --> 1:27:48.160
 that was published by my colleagues,

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:50.600
 Karl Deisseroth in psychiatry,

1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:52.300
 Robert Malenka also in psychiatry,

1:27:52.300 --> 1:27:54.560
 Legion Lowe also at Stanford.

1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:58.280
 They paired up or teamed up rather

1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:00.480
 to explore how systemic ketamine

1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:03.360
 adjust circuitries in the brain.

1:28:03.360 --> 1:28:05.560
 And what they discovered was that

1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:08.120
 it changes the rhythm of cortical activity

1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:11.120
 in certain layers of the cortex.

1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:14.040
 The cortex is like a layered sandwich.

1:28:14.040 --> 1:28:16.640
 The cortex of course, being the outside of the brain.

1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:17.940
 And there was a particular rhythm,

1:28:17.940 --> 1:28:19.400
 a one to three Hertz rhythm.

1:28:19.400 --> 1:28:21.440
 One to three Hertz just means a particular frequency

1:28:21.440 --> 1:28:23.400
 of electrical activity.

1:28:23.400 --> 1:28:25.120
 In this case, in these layer five neurons

1:28:25.120 --> 1:28:26.760
 of retrosplenial cortex.

1:28:26.760 --> 1:28:30.260
 So you don't need to know much about retrosplenial cortex

1:28:30.260 --> 1:28:32.320
 or one to three Hertz rhythms.

1:28:32.320 --> 1:28:34.760
 I think the important thing to just take away from this

1:28:34.760 --> 1:28:39.100
 is that there is now starting to be an understanding

1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:41.000
 of how drugs like ketamine work

1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:44.460
 to create this subjective experience

1:28:44.460 --> 1:28:47.240
 that this patient and other patients describe

1:28:47.240 --> 1:28:48.520
 as dissociation.

1:28:49.540 --> 1:28:52.600
 You know, dissociation in its essence

1:28:52.600 --> 1:28:57.040
 is really about not feeling what's happening.

1:28:57.040 --> 1:28:58.980
 It's about viewing what's happening

1:28:58.980 --> 1:29:01.660
 from a different perspective than what normally

1:29:01.660 --> 1:29:03.680
 one would view that experience from.

1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:07.220
 And so if we kind of plug that general notion

1:29:07.220 --> 1:29:10.560
 of dissociation and ketamine induced dissociation

1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:13.280
 into the circuit that we talked about before

1:29:13.280 --> 1:29:15.680
 where we have this threat reflex involved in the amygdala,

1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:18.600
 these outputs for freezing or for reward in the accumbens,

1:29:18.600 --> 1:29:21.900
 and we've got this prefrontal narrative coming down

1:29:21.900 --> 1:29:23.720
 as top-down processing,

1:29:23.720 --> 1:29:27.480
 it brings us right to that prefrontal cortical input

1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:29.880
 to the threat system and that narrative.

1:29:29.880 --> 1:29:32.240
 What seems to be the case in my review

1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:35.560
 of the paper I just described plus a review

1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:39.780
 on how ketamine assisted trauma relief might work

1:29:39.780 --> 1:29:44.000
 is that it somehow allows the patient, the individual,

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:49.000
 to recount their trauma while feeling either none

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:52.800
 or a very different set of emotional experiences

1:29:52.800 --> 1:29:55.480
 that they experienced in the actual trauma

1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:57.000
 or fearful experience.

1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:00.600
 So it's a remapping of new onto old,

1:30:00.600 --> 1:30:03.160
 new meaning new feelings onto old feelings

1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:05.100
 while staying in the exact same narrative.

1:30:05.100 --> 1:30:07.160
 So it's a little bit like EMDR

1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:09.200
 of suppressing the threat reflex,

1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:14.200
 but it seems to bring in a replacement of previous

1:30:15.240 --> 1:30:18.880
 emotional experiences and sensations in the body

1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:20.080
 with new ones.

1:30:20.080 --> 1:30:22.960
 And so in that way, we can sort of view,

1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:26.280
 or we can try and view ketamine assisted psychotherapy

1:30:26.280 --> 1:30:28.760
 for the treatment of trauma as bringing together

1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:30.920
 the three elements that we talked about before.

1:30:30.920 --> 1:30:33.320
 You want to diminish the intensity,

1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:37.080
 the potency of the old original trauma experience

1:30:37.080 --> 1:30:38.280
 or fear experience.

1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:41.200
 So that seems to be accomplished through this dissociation

1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:43.240
 and maybe through the kind of anesthetic component.

1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:45.580
 So it's a reduction in pain in the body,

1:30:45.580 --> 1:30:48.520
 a dissociation, a kind of observing of the self

1:30:48.520 --> 1:30:52.200
 that leads to the extinction of the trauma and the fear.

1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:54.920
 But then there also seems to be an automatic

1:30:54.920 --> 1:30:58.320
 or kind of built in relearning of a new narrative

1:30:58.320 --> 1:30:59.720
 and new set of experiences,

1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:02.860
 which is the next step that we described earlier.

1:31:02.860 --> 1:31:05.200
 So it's an intriguing therapy.

1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:07.200
 It's one that's really catching on.

1:31:07.200 --> 1:31:09.240
 And there are many, many clinics around the US

1:31:09.240 --> 1:31:11.040
 that are now doing it.

1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:14.220
 Whether or not it turns out to be the ultimate treatment

1:31:14.220 --> 1:31:17.720
 for trauma and for fear isn't clear.

1:31:17.720 --> 1:31:21.400
 My colleagues in psychiatry tell me that that's unlikely,

1:31:21.400 --> 1:31:23.300
 although it does seem to be beneficial

1:31:23.300 --> 1:31:24.340
 for a number of people,

1:31:24.340 --> 1:31:27.200
 especially people that are experiencing trauma

1:31:27.200 --> 1:31:28.940
 or have existing traumas and fear

1:31:28.940 --> 1:31:30.840
 that are coupled with depressive symptoms

1:31:30.840 --> 1:31:33.320
 because the data on ketamine and depression

1:31:33.320 --> 1:31:34.780
 seems to be quite strong.

1:31:34.780 --> 1:31:37.320
 So now let's talk about MDMA.

1:31:37.320 --> 1:31:41.160
 MDMA, also sometimes called ecstasy or molly

1:31:41.160 --> 1:31:46.000
 in its recreational form, is a powerful synthetic drug

1:31:47.120 --> 1:31:49.380
 that at least as far as we know,

1:31:49.380 --> 1:31:51.980
 creates a state in the brain and body

1:31:51.980 --> 1:31:54.620
 that is unlike any other chemical state

1:31:54.620 --> 1:31:57.000
 in the brain and body that's normally experienced.

1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:58.200
 What do I mean by that?

1:31:58.200 --> 1:32:01.080
 Well, we have several neuromodulator systems in our body.

1:32:01.080 --> 1:32:03.920
 Neuromodulators are chemicals that change the likelihood

1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:06.160
 that certain neural circuits will be active,

1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:07.880
 meaning they can make it very likely

1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:09.120
 that certain circuits will be active

1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:10.480
 and make it very unlikely

1:32:10.480 --> 1:32:12.780
 that other neural circuits will be active.

1:32:12.780 --> 1:32:15.360
 Good examples of neuromodulators are dopamine,

1:32:15.360 --> 1:32:18.400
 serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine.

1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:20.440
 These tend to work on different systems

1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:21.320
 in the brain and body,

1:32:21.320 --> 1:32:24.620
 but they tend to be activated more or less in parallel.

1:32:24.620 --> 1:32:27.240
 You can have dopamine released in your brain

1:32:27.240 --> 1:32:28.940
 and also norepinephrine.

1:32:28.940 --> 1:32:30.840
 You can have serotonin released in your brain

1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:32.080
 and also acetylcholine.

1:32:32.080 --> 1:32:34.120
 So it's not an all or none kind of thing,

1:32:34.120 --> 1:32:36.520
 but the degrees to which these things are activated

1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:37.760
 tends to vary.

1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:42.760
 And there is a little bit of a seesaw type phenomenon

1:32:42.760 --> 1:32:44.280
 with dopamine and serotonin.

1:32:44.280 --> 1:32:46.620
 Dopamine most commonly associated

1:32:46.620 --> 1:32:49.700
 with activating neural circuits related to motivation,

1:32:49.700 --> 1:32:51.400
 craving, and reward.

1:32:51.400 --> 1:32:54.400
 And serotonin more typically activated

1:32:54.400 --> 1:32:57.760
 in response to situations or conditions

1:32:57.760 --> 1:33:00.200
 in which we are very happy and content with what we have.

1:33:00.200 --> 1:33:02.460
 So dopamine is more about pursuing and seeking.

1:33:02.460 --> 1:33:07.460
 Serotonin is more about kind of a pleasure and satisfaction

1:33:07.520 --> 1:33:10.400
 with resources that we have in our immediate sphere.

1:33:10.400 --> 1:33:11.520
 They don't tend to,

1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:13.960
 serotonin doesn't tend to place the brain and body

1:33:13.960 --> 1:33:18.120
 into a mode of action quite as much as dopamine does,

1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:19.000
 more or less.

1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:23.320
 MDMA is a unique compound

1:33:23.320 --> 1:33:26.400
 in that it leads to very large increases

1:33:26.400 --> 1:33:29.140
 in the amount of both dopamine and serotonin

1:33:29.140 --> 1:33:31.760
 in the brain and body simultaneously.

1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:33.400
 And that's a unique circumstance

1:33:33.400 --> 1:33:38.120
 that is just simply not seen under normal conditions.

1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:39.760
 From a subjective standpoint,

1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:41.840
 people under the influence of MDMA

1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:45.520
 in the therapeutic setting tend to report immense feelings

1:33:45.520 --> 1:33:48.760
 of connection or resonance with people

1:33:48.760 --> 1:33:52.240
 or even things with music, with objects.

1:33:52.240 --> 1:33:55.760
 Certainly if it's being done in conjunction

1:33:55.760 --> 1:33:58.360
 with a family member or a partner

1:33:58.360 --> 1:33:59.680
 or with a therapist,

1:33:59.680 --> 1:34:02.720
 they will feel extremely connected to that person.

1:34:02.720 --> 1:34:06.300
 They'll feel a very close understanding and association

1:34:06.300 --> 1:34:08.780
 oftentimes that goes beyond words.

1:34:08.780 --> 1:34:10.840
 There is a chemical reason for that.

1:34:11.920 --> 1:34:16.920
 It turns out that MDMA causes massive release of oxytocin,

1:34:18.420 --> 1:34:21.140
 this neuropeptide that's associated with pair bonding

1:34:21.140 --> 1:34:22.560
 and with bonding generally.

1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:24.460
 The oxytocin system and the serotonin system

1:34:24.460 --> 1:34:28.400
 are closely linked to one another in the brain and body.

1:34:28.400 --> 1:34:32.160
 And they tend to be co-released often at the same times

1:34:32.160 --> 1:34:33.840
 and by the same sorts of events.

1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:38.840
 So MDMA is one mechanism by which oxytocin is released

1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:41.920
 in these massive amounts.

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:45.520
 And I should just relay some of the levels of oxytocin

1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:47.040
 because they're really quite striking

1:34:47.040 --> 1:34:49.800
 gives a kind of a more vivid picture

1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:53.040
 of why it is the MDMA would make people feel

1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:55.720
 so associated in a positive way

1:34:55.720 --> 1:34:57.600
 with the various things that are happening to them

1:34:57.600 --> 1:34:59.840
 while they're under the influence of the drug.

1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:02.840
 So the paper related to this that I'd like to highlight

1:35:02.840 --> 1:35:06.540
 is in the journal, Psychoneuroendocrinology.

1:35:06.540 --> 1:35:09.860
 The title of the paper is plasma oxytocin concentrations

1:35:09.860 --> 1:35:14.220
 following MDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans.

1:35:14.220 --> 1:35:16.960
 And just remarkably,

1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:20.560
 MDMA increased plasma oxytocin levels

1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:24.440
 to 83.7, this is an average,

1:35:24.440 --> 1:35:27.800
 83.7 picograms per milliliter,

1:35:27.800 --> 1:35:31.240
 about 90 to 120 minutes into the MDMA session

1:35:31.240 --> 1:35:34.600
 compared to a typical level of 18.6.

1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:37.160
 So this is a massive increase in oxytocin.

1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:39.760
 And I think that massive increase in oxytocin

1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:43.680
 is part of the reason why people have these feelings

1:35:43.680 --> 1:35:46.600
 of close resonance and association.

1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:49.140
 Now, the dopamine increases

1:35:49.140 --> 1:35:52.040
 are generally what lead to the feelings of euphoria

1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:53.960
 inside of the MDMA session.

1:35:53.960 --> 1:35:56.640
 And then the serotonin increases, it is thought,

1:35:56.640 --> 1:35:59.160
 are what lead to the feelings of safety and comfort.

1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:01.380
 So again, a very unusual chemical cocktail

1:36:01.380 --> 1:36:05.120
 that would never be seen, at least not at this amplitude,

1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:07.180
 under any normal conditions

1:36:08.120 --> 1:36:12.080
 outside of an MDMA clinical psychotherapeutic session.

1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:14.780
 Why would this state of mind and body

1:36:14.780 --> 1:36:17.840
 be potentially useful for the treatment of trauma?

1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:21.220
 Well, indeed it is revealing itself to be useful

1:36:21.220 --> 1:36:22.160
 for the treatment of trauma.

1:36:22.160 --> 1:36:24.760
 Again, these are legal clinical trials

1:36:24.760 --> 1:36:27.660
 where people are doing this and discovering this.

1:36:27.660 --> 1:36:32.660
 What it seems to allow is a very fast relearning

1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:37.100
 or new associations to be tacked on

1:36:37.100 --> 1:36:39.160
 to the previously traumatic experience.

1:36:39.160 --> 1:36:41.600
 So again, it brings us back to the same model

1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:45.200
 of how people extinguish fears and traumas

1:36:45.200 --> 1:36:47.340
 and replace them with new experiences

1:36:47.340 --> 1:36:49.380
 when there is no drug treatment involved.

1:36:50.240 --> 1:36:53.120
 There needs to be a diminishing of the old experience,

1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:54.160
 meaning an extinction,

1:36:54.160 --> 1:36:55.920
 and then a relearning of a new narrative.

1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:00.880
 What the chemical milieu of MDMA seems to be doing

1:37:00.880 --> 1:37:05.360
 is creating an opportunity for all that to happen very fast

1:37:05.360 --> 1:37:08.620
 without the need for many repetitions of the original trauma

1:37:08.620 --> 1:37:11.060
 and reliving of the original trauma,

1:37:11.060 --> 1:37:13.240
 probably because the reliving of it

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:17.400
 inside of one of these MDMA sessions is very acute,

1:37:17.400 --> 1:37:22.400
 very intense, plus it seems to be offering the opportunity

1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:26.960
 to extinguish and rewrite in or write in a new narrative

1:37:26.960 --> 1:37:30.320
 associated with that trauma very quickly as well.

1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:33.520
 So what this means is that treatments like MDMA

1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:36.360
 that are under investigation in these clinical trials

1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:41.120
 are unlikely to be magic potions, if you will,

1:37:41.120 --> 1:37:45.220
 that allow access to a particular process

1:37:45.220 --> 1:37:48.760
 that would otherwise not be accessible.

1:37:48.760 --> 1:37:51.980
 It's more that the typical process of trauma

1:37:51.980 --> 1:37:53.560
 and fear reduction that's carried out

1:37:53.560 --> 1:37:55.060
 in things like prolonged exposure,

1:37:55.060 --> 1:37:57.440
 cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy

1:37:57.440 --> 1:38:00.240
 seems to be compacted into a much shorter session,

1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:04.140
 and that session is performed at a much higher intensity,

1:38:04.140 --> 1:38:07.240
 higher intensity because the chemical milieu of the brain

1:38:07.240 --> 1:38:09.000
 is completely different.

1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:12.500
 I mean, the experience of MDMA is one in which

1:38:12.500 --> 1:38:14.960
 people have a very heightened sense of euphoria,

1:38:14.960 --> 1:38:16.900
 a very heightened sense of connection,

1:38:16.900 --> 1:38:19.880
 so those positive experiences are essentially prime

1:38:19.880 --> 1:38:22.800
 to be written in and over the traumatic experience,

1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:26.400
 and because of the high levels of serotonin in the system

1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:28.120
 and probably oxytocin as well,

1:38:28.120 --> 1:38:31.320
 there's a safety that's written into the situation

1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:34.680
 that allows people to lean into perhaps narratives

1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:35.880
 or components of narratives

1:38:35.880 --> 1:38:38.500
 that they would otherwise be holding back from.

1:38:38.500 --> 1:38:40.480
 So these are powerful compounds,

1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:43.920
 and I think the future of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy

1:38:43.920 --> 1:38:48.480
 for trauma in particular is holding great promise.

1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:51.040
 As of now, meaning at the time of the recording

1:38:51.040 --> 1:38:53.480
 of this podcast, again, I want to reiterate

1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:56.000
 that these are clinical trials that are being done legally.

1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.240
 These drugs are still illegal to possess or sell

1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:01.640
 outside of clinical trials.

1:39:01.640 --> 1:39:04.840
 Doing this sort of thing is punishable,

1:39:04.840 --> 1:39:07.960
 but it does seem that the FDA

1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:10.240
 and some of the related bodies

1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:12.480
 that control these sorts of things

1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:14.640
 are eyes open to this stuff,

1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:16.760
 and I think it's very likely in the next few years,

1:39:16.760 --> 1:39:20.400
 things like MDMA and certainly ketamine is already

1:39:20.400 --> 1:39:22.680
 in widespread use within the psychiatric community,

1:39:22.680 --> 1:39:25.040
 and I think we're going to be seeing a lot more of that.

1:39:25.040 --> 1:39:27.600
 One thing we have not touched on yet

1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:30.800
 is how do you know if you're traumatized?

1:39:30.800 --> 1:39:34.120
 How do you know if you have chronic fear

1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:35.760
 or a debilitating fear?

1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:39.100
 Much of the psychiatric community focuses

1:39:39.100 --> 1:39:43.320
 on how many other problems people might have,

1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:46.520
 trouble sleeping, trouble eating,

1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:51.080
 trouble maintaining quality work or schoolwork and so forth,

1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:54.640
 and all of those are certainly very valid criteria

1:39:54.640 --> 1:39:56.440
 and necessary criteria for determining

1:39:56.440 --> 1:40:01.000
 whether or not somebody meets clinical diagnosis or not,

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.920
 but there's a biological component

1:40:03.920 --> 1:40:07.160
 that I think we can all assess for ourselves,

1:40:07.160 --> 1:40:12.160
 and that's one of interoceptive versus exteroceptive balance

1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:13.200
 and that sounds confusing,

1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:16.080
 but it's actually really easy to understand.

1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:20.720
 We can focus our perception on the external world,

1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:23.920
 events going on around us beyond the confines of our skin

1:40:23.920 --> 1:40:26.920
 or within the confines of our skin.

1:40:26.920 --> 1:40:29.020
 A focus and a perception on the external world

1:40:29.020 --> 1:40:31.600
 is what's called exteroception,

1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:33.540
 and a focus on what's happening inside us

1:40:33.540 --> 1:40:35.400
 is interoception,

1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:39.780
 and we have the capacity to build mental appraisal

1:40:39.780 --> 1:40:40.760
 into that, right?

1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:42.480
 I can, for instance, stop for a moment

1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:45.860
 and assess how my stomach feels, how hungry I feel,

1:40:45.860 --> 1:40:47.600
 how quick my heart is beating.

1:40:47.600 --> 1:40:49.460
 Some people, by the way, are much better at sensing

1:40:49.460 --> 1:40:52.320
 whether or not their heart is beating at a particular rate

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:53.560
 and others not so much.

1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:55.120
 Some people can actually count their heartbeats

1:40:55.120 --> 1:40:56.520
 without having to take their pulse

1:40:56.520 --> 1:41:00.560
 by placing pressure on their wrist or their neck.

1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:01.680
 Some people can't.

1:41:01.680 --> 1:41:04.040
 In other words, some people have very high interoceptive

1:41:04.040 --> 1:41:06.640
 awareness and other people less so.

1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:09.520
 This whole business of fear and trauma

1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:12.400
 relates to taking external experiences

1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:17.180
 and funneling those experiences into this thing

1:41:17.180 --> 1:41:21.040
 that I'm calling a threat reflex or the fear circuitry.

1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:24.600
 A recent paper published in the journal Science,

1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:28.460
 so absolutely spectacular journal, Science, Nature, and Cell

1:41:28.460 --> 1:41:32.480
 being the apex journals of scientific publishing,

1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:36.040
 gets at this issue of where in our mind

1:41:36.040 --> 1:41:38.040
 and how do we assess

1:41:38.040 --> 1:41:41.360
 whether or not what we are feeling internally

1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:44.720
 is reasonable given what's going on externally.

1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:46.600
 And it's a really fascinating study.

1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:49.280
 I'm just going to highlight a little bit of it for you,

1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:52.300
 and then I'll touch on some of the relevant aspects

1:41:52.300 --> 1:41:55.220
 and how that can be adopted into a practice

1:41:55.220 --> 1:41:59.040
 to assess and reduce fear and anxiety.

1:41:59.040 --> 1:42:00.160
 The title of this paper,

1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:02.400
 published just a few weeks ago in Science,

1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:06.140
 is Fear Balance is Maintained by Bodily Feedback

1:42:06.140 --> 1:42:08.760
 to the Insular Cortex in Mice.

1:42:08.760 --> 1:42:11.060
 We've not talked too much about the insula,

1:42:11.060 --> 1:42:12.460
 also called the insular cortex.

1:42:12.460 --> 1:42:14.580
 This is a brain area that my lab has worked on

1:42:14.580 --> 1:42:16.280
 and other labs have worked on.

1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:20.380
 It's a brain area that has within it a map

1:42:20.380 --> 1:42:24.360
 of our internal interoceptive landscape.

1:42:24.360 --> 1:42:29.040
 It's a map of our internal bodily sensations.

1:42:29.040 --> 1:42:31.600
 It's a really interesting structure.

1:42:31.600 --> 1:42:33.440
 So the way this study was carried out

1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:36.440
 is that subjects were taught or conditioned

1:42:36.440 --> 1:42:38.280
 to a particular danger signal

1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:41.720
 through repeated presentation of a sound with a foot shock.

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:43.360
 So there's a sound and there's a foot shock.

1:42:43.360 --> 1:42:45.600
 And as you know from our earlier discussion

1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:46.720
 about Pavlovian learning,

1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:48.880
 conditioned stimuli and unconditioned stimuli,

1:42:48.880 --> 1:42:53.120
 eventually the sound alone comes to evoke the fear response.

1:42:53.120 --> 1:42:57.860
 And that's just classical conditioning.

1:42:57.860 --> 1:42:59.900
 The insula is this brain area

1:42:59.900 --> 1:43:02.620
 that's associated with determining

1:43:02.620 --> 1:43:06.560
 whether or not one's internal sensations,

1:43:06.560 --> 1:43:09.840
 gut, heart, lungs, et cetera,

1:43:09.840 --> 1:43:14.020
 are reasonable or not given the external circumstances.

1:43:14.020 --> 1:43:18.640
 It can even measure or is associated with our understanding

1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:20.880
 of what are called atrial baroreceptors.

1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:22.480
 These are blood pressure sensors.

1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:25.720
 So believe it or not, when your pulse rate increases

1:43:25.720 --> 1:43:27.480
 or you feel like you're stressed out,

1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:30.140
 your atrial baroreceptors are sending a signal

1:43:30.140 --> 1:43:32.660
 to your insular cortex and your insular cortex is saying,

1:43:32.660 --> 1:43:34.360
 wow, I'm really stressed out.

1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:35.440
 My blood pressure is up.

1:43:35.440 --> 1:43:37.000
 You don't actually have to measure your blood pressure

1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:37.840
 with a cuff.

1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:39.400
 Your insula is doing it for you.

1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:41.480
 It's not getting a quantitative readout,

1:43:41.480 --> 1:43:44.040
 but it's getting a qualitative readout.

1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:46.140
 The main effect of inhibiting

1:43:46.140 --> 1:43:48.420
 or reducing the activity of the insula

1:43:48.420 --> 1:43:53.420
 was that the intensity of an outside world experience

1:43:54.060 --> 1:43:59.060
 led to a range of different internal effects.

1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:01.600
 In other words, for most people,

1:44:01.600 --> 1:44:05.740
 a mild shock would induce a mild increase in heart rate,

1:44:05.740 --> 1:44:07.440
 a mild increase in blood pressure,

1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:10.340
 whereas an intense shock to the skin

1:44:10.340 --> 1:44:12.020
 would lead to a big increase in heart rate

1:44:12.020 --> 1:44:13.880
 and a big increase in blood pressure.

1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:16.600
 Turns out the insula is important

1:44:16.600 --> 1:44:20.560
 for establishing that match of intensity.

1:44:20.560 --> 1:44:23.200
 And when the insula is inhibited,

1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:26.600
 what ends up happening is that a mild shock

1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:28.880
 can create a big increase in blood pressure.

1:44:28.880 --> 1:44:31.000
 And that can be maintained such that

1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:32.600
 anything that's paired with that shock,

1:44:32.600 --> 1:44:35.800
 like a bell or a tone,

1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:38.120
 would lead to a big increase in blood pressure.

1:44:38.120 --> 1:44:40.520
 You've probably seen examples of this in the real world.

1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:41.900
 Maybe this is even you.

1:44:41.900 --> 1:44:45.040
 Some people are very jumpy in response

1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:47.380
 to just even small changes in their environment.

1:44:47.380 --> 1:44:49.860
 So if somebody is working and you walk in and you say hello,

1:44:49.860 --> 1:44:51.720
 and they'll go, and they're kind of, they're jumpy.

1:44:51.720 --> 1:44:55.000
 They have a low threshold to a big anxiety

1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.740
 or a fear response.

1:44:56.740 --> 1:44:58.460
 Other people are really calm.

1:44:58.460 --> 1:45:01.140
 I recall my bulldog, unfortunately, he passed away.

1:45:01.140 --> 1:45:02.560
 But before he passed away,

1:45:02.560 --> 1:45:04.880
 if you walked in the room and you said,

1:45:04.880 --> 1:45:09.000
 hey Costello, he might turn his eyes in your direction.

1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:11.420
 He had a very high threshold to respond.

1:45:11.420 --> 1:45:13.780
 He was pretty low anxiety animal.

1:45:13.780 --> 1:45:15.280
 A lot of people are like that.

1:45:15.280 --> 1:45:17.720
 You come up behind someone and you say, hello,

1:45:17.720 --> 1:45:20.280
 and they just turn around real slow,

1:45:20.280 --> 1:45:22.600
 or they might just turn around at normal speed and say hello,

1:45:22.600 --> 1:45:24.660
 whereas other people would jump out of their seat.

1:45:24.660 --> 1:45:28.240
 The insula seems to be involved in calibrating how big

1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:32.760
 or how high amplitude a given physiological response is.

1:45:32.760 --> 1:45:35.960
 So it's pairing the internal landscape

1:45:35.960 --> 1:45:37.580
 with the external world.

1:45:37.580 --> 1:45:40.140
 And this might seem like just a mechanistic,

1:45:40.140 --> 1:45:41.620
 but non-actionable point.

1:45:41.620 --> 1:45:43.720
 But what you'll see from the next study

1:45:43.720 --> 1:45:47.320
 that I'm going to describe is that recalibrating

1:45:47.320 --> 1:45:49.920
 the relationship between outside events

1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:53.560
 and internal responses, which is the job of the insula,

1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:56.240
 is actually something that's under our control.

1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.080
 And through a very simple, very short protocol,

1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:03.780
 we can actually recalibrate that system so much so

1:46:03.780 --> 1:46:07.560
 that we can potentially reduce the amount of fear

1:46:07.560 --> 1:46:10.340
 and trauma that we experience in response to a memory

1:46:10.340 --> 1:46:11.720
 or to a real event.

1:46:11.720 --> 1:46:15.140
 And the entire process can occur very quickly.

1:46:15.140 --> 1:46:17.820
 So I'm really excited to tell you about this next study

1:46:17.820 --> 1:46:18.660
 for a number of reasons.

1:46:18.660 --> 1:46:19.980
 First of all, it's extremely recent.

1:46:19.980 --> 1:46:22.600
 Second of all, it's very well grounded

1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:25.400
 in our current understanding of the mechanisms

1:46:25.400 --> 1:46:28.080
 of stress, trauma, and PTSD,

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:31.080
 and unlearning of stress, trauma, and PTSD.

1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:35.760
 And third, it points to a actionable protocol

1:46:35.760 --> 1:46:39.120
 that while certainly is not the only approach

1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:41.400
 that I think people could or should take

1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:46.240
 for fear, trauma, and PTSD is one that I think

1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:47.560
 we are going to see implemented

1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:50.260
 into the clinical setting very soon

1:46:50.260 --> 1:46:51.800
 if it's not happening already.

1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:55.560
 Now, there's a fourth reason I'm very interested in it,

1:46:55.560 --> 1:46:58.020
 which is that my lab works on stress, stress relief,

1:46:58.020 --> 1:47:03.020
 and tools for managing sleep and improving focus, et cetera.

1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:04.740
 And one of the hallmarks of the studies

1:47:04.740 --> 1:47:08.600
 we've been doing lately is very brief

1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:11.440
 five minute a day interventions of the sort

1:47:11.440 --> 1:47:13.880
 that was used in this particular study,

1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:15.600
 although I should emphasize I had nothing to do

1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:16.860
 with this particular study.

1:47:16.860 --> 1:47:18.560
 Now, this particular study was carried out

1:47:18.560 --> 1:47:20.800
 in an animal model in mice.

1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:24.180
 The work in my laboratory focuses on human subjects,

1:47:24.180 --> 1:47:27.200
 but the similarities of the stress system,

1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:29.560
 at least at the level that it was explored in this study,

1:47:29.560 --> 1:47:31.180
 I think have great relevance,

1:47:31.180 --> 1:47:34.520
 maybe even direct relevance to humans.

1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:37.440
 So the title of this study is repeated exposure

1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:39.280
 with short-term behavioral stress

1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:42.040
 resolves preexisting stress-induced

1:47:42.040 --> 1:47:43.880
 depressive-like behavior in mice.

1:47:43.880 --> 1:47:45.520
 Again, this study was in mice.

1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:50.000
 And basically what they did is they stressed out mice,

1:47:50.000 --> 1:47:53.720
 got them depressed, and you actually can do that in a mouse

1:47:53.720 --> 1:47:55.320
 using a restraint protocol.

1:47:55.320 --> 1:47:57.840
 And that's a long lasting restraint protocol

1:47:57.840 --> 1:47:59.400
 of 15 minutes or more.

1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:00.360
 Mice don't like it.

1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:01.740
 You do it often enough.

1:48:01.740 --> 1:48:05.160
 They stop working so hard in their life,

1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:09.000
 in their mouse life to gain food, to gain mates.

1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:10.860
 They show depressive symptoms in a number of levels.

1:48:10.860 --> 1:48:12.320
 They show elevated glucocorticoids.

1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:14.240
 You see the same thing in humans.

1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:18.280
 Chronic stress in humans lasting weeks or more

1:48:18.280 --> 1:48:19.580
 does the same exact thing.

1:48:19.580 --> 1:48:21.600
 So again, a very close match here

1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:23.320
 in terms of mechanism overall.

1:48:23.320 --> 1:48:27.040
 And then what they did was a very counterintuitive thing.

1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:31.520
 Rather than give these animals stress relief

1:48:31.520 --> 1:48:34.320
 at the level of reducing their anxiety

1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:35.700
 with benzodiazepines

1:48:35.700 --> 1:48:38.400
 or giving them a nice little mouse vacation

1:48:38.400 --> 1:48:41.100
 or enhanced or enriched environment,

1:48:41.100 --> 1:48:43.060
 things that have been done in a lot of previous studies,

1:48:43.060 --> 1:48:45.840
 what they did is they subjected them to five minutes a day

1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:49.360
 of intense stress, but only five minutes a day.

1:48:49.360 --> 1:48:52.740
 And what they found was miraculously,

1:48:52.740 --> 1:48:54.720
 but also very convincingly,

1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:58.040
 daily short bouts of intense stress

1:48:58.040 --> 1:49:02.880
 actually undid, reversed the effects of chronic stress.

1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:05.200
 And it did this at the level of glucocorticoids,

1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:06.760
 of hormones, of neurotransmitters,

1:49:06.760 --> 1:49:08.720
 and a number of other different mechanisms.

1:49:08.720 --> 1:49:11.880
 Now, I find this very exciting for a number of reasons,

1:49:11.880 --> 1:49:14.520
 but in particular, because my laboratory

1:49:14.520 --> 1:49:16.560
 in collaboration with David Spiegel's laboratory,

1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:18.880
 our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford,

1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:20.760
 been exploring how five minute a day

1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:24.240
 respiration protocols can alleviate stress.

1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:26.800
 And while those data are not yet published,

1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:28.020
 they are at the stage

1:49:28.020 --> 1:49:29.560
 where I'm comfortable talking about them.

1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:32.140
 And we are seeing some very impressive

1:49:32.140 --> 1:49:34.560
 and significant effects on stress reduction,

1:49:34.560 --> 1:49:37.360
 not just from respiration protocols

1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:39.520
 that allow people to calm themselves,

1:49:39.520 --> 1:49:41.480
 but also respiration protocols

1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:43.280
 that bring people into a heightened state

1:49:43.280 --> 1:49:47.120
 of autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress.

1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:50.500
 As my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,

1:49:50.500 --> 1:49:54.660
 he's an MD, psychiatrist, and PhD, likes to say,

1:49:55.600 --> 1:49:59.640
 when it comes to trauma, anxiety, and PTSD,

1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:01.980
 and the treatment of trauma, anxiety, and PTSD,

1:50:01.980 --> 1:50:06.320
 it's not just the state that you are in or that you go into,

1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:07.960
 it's how you got there

1:50:07.960 --> 1:50:10.840
 and whether or not you had anything to do with it.

1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:14.080
 And this brings us right back to those top-down mechanisms

1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:15.480
 and the narrative around

1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:17.340
 what we are experiencing internally.

1:50:17.340 --> 1:50:20.320
 So let's zoom out and I'll explain how this works

1:50:20.320 --> 1:50:21.880
 and what to do about it.

1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:24.120
 We have this brain structure called the insula.

1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:25.680
 We talked about the insula a few minutes ago.

1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.120
 The insula is calibrating how we feel internally

1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:31.240
 versus what's going on externally.

1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:33.540
 It's involved in setting

1:50:33.540 --> 1:50:36.040
 whether or not what we are feeling is appropriate

1:50:36.040 --> 1:50:37.920
 given what's happening.

1:50:39.440 --> 1:50:42.560
 We have a system that can generate threat responses.

1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:45.720
 And in the case of trauma, PTSD, and extreme stress,

1:50:45.720 --> 1:50:47.940
 chronic stress, that system gets ramped up

1:50:47.940 --> 1:50:50.240
 so that it takes very little, maybe even just a memory

1:50:50.240 --> 1:50:53.600
 or maybe even an association that we're not even aware of,

1:50:53.600 --> 1:50:55.160
 you know, a location triggers something,

1:50:55.160 --> 1:50:56.240
 we're not even aware of it,

1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:59.220
 and we start experiencing that symptomology.

1:50:59.220 --> 1:51:01.120
 How do we recalibrate the system?

1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:03.480
 Well, most of the approaches that are out there

1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:05.240
 involving drug treatments,

1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:08.160
 typical drug treatments would involve

1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:11.200
 suppressing the level of internal arousal,

1:51:11.200 --> 1:51:12.860
 just trying to bring that down.

1:51:12.860 --> 1:51:14.860
 Now, some of those drug treatments work,

1:51:14.860 --> 1:51:16.360
 but oftentimes they don't.

1:51:16.360 --> 1:51:18.340
 And if you think about it,

1:51:18.340 --> 1:51:20.380
 it's probably not surprising that they don't

1:51:20.380 --> 1:51:24.960
 because by taking a drug that just lowers your anxiety,

1:51:24.960 --> 1:51:29.360
 overall, you're creating a different sort of

1:51:29.360 --> 1:51:31.520
 miscalibration of the system.

1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:34.440
 So what we've been doing in human subjects

1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:38.440
 is having them do either breathing protocols that calm them,

1:51:38.440 --> 1:51:40.160
 and I'll explain what that is in a moment,

1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:41.520
 or doing breathing protocols

1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:44.040
 that increase their level of autonomic arousal

1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:48.120
 and seeing how that impacts their response to stress overall

1:51:48.120 --> 1:51:50.480
 not just during that particular breathing protocol.

1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:53.000
 So the calming protocol that we use

1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:55.100
 involves these physiological sighs.

1:51:55.100 --> 1:51:56.760
 I've talked about these previously

1:51:56.760 --> 1:51:57.840
 on the podcast and elsewhere,

1:51:57.840 --> 1:51:59.820
 but if you just need a reminder,

1:51:59.820 --> 1:52:01.080
 if you haven't heard about it,

1:52:01.080 --> 1:52:03.160
 there's a pattern of breathing that we all do in sleep

1:52:03.160 --> 1:52:04.960
 when our carbon dioxide levels in our bloodstream

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:07.880
 get too high, and we do this when we get claustrophobic,

1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:09.040
 meaning we do it reflexively,

1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:10.640
 and that's a double inhale through the nose

1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:12.080
 followed by a long exhale.

1:52:12.080 --> 1:52:12.920
 So it's,

1:52:14.400 --> 1:52:16.440
 and yes, the inhales should be through the nose,

1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:18.040
 and yes, the exhales should be done

1:52:18.040 --> 1:52:19.180
 through the mouth, ideally.

1:52:19.180 --> 1:52:20.840
 So it's a big filling of the lungs

1:52:20.840 --> 1:52:24.320
 through two breaths back to back inhales.

1:52:25.520 --> 1:52:27.040
 Even if you can only sneak in a little air

1:52:27.040 --> 1:52:29.760
 on that second one, no talking if you're going to do it right

1:52:29.760 --> 1:52:31.820
 and then a long exhale, which allows you to offload

1:52:31.820 --> 1:52:33.840
 a lot of carbon dioxide in the exhale.

1:52:33.840 --> 1:52:37.680
 And we have people doing that in real time,

1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:38.940
 anytime they experience stress,

1:52:38.940 --> 1:52:41.080
 but the particular breathing protocol

1:52:41.080 --> 1:52:42.880
 that we've been giving human subjects

1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:46.620
 is for them to do the repeated, what we call cyclic sighing.

1:52:46.620 --> 1:52:49.340
 So double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale,

1:52:49.340 --> 1:52:51.720
 double inhale, exhale, repeatedly for five minutes,

1:52:51.720 --> 1:52:53.440
 which is actually a pretty long time to repeat that,

1:52:53.440 --> 1:52:54.840
 but you can do it pretty slowly.

1:52:54.840 --> 1:52:57.720
 And people report and the data point to the fact

1:52:57.720 --> 1:52:58.760
 that it's very calming.

1:52:58.760 --> 1:53:01.080
 People feel more relaxed afterwards,

1:53:01.080 --> 1:53:02.960
 and that relaxation wicks out

1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:05.440
 into other aspects of their life.

1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:08.300
 Now, we did not look at stress and trauma in that condition.

1:53:08.300 --> 1:53:09.720
 We also have another condition

1:53:09.720 --> 1:53:12.200
 where people do what's called cyclic hyperventilation,

1:53:12.200 --> 1:53:13.380
 which is very different

1:53:13.380 --> 1:53:15.920
 and creates a very different internal state

1:53:15.920 --> 1:53:18.960
 and is somewhat stressful.

1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:21.160
 It's five minutes a day of stress,

1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:23.800
 much like the study that I just described,

1:53:23.800 --> 1:53:26.520
 and it involves basically doing this,

1:53:26.520 --> 1:53:28.320
 what I'll do in a moment,

1:53:28.320 --> 1:53:31.300
 for five minutes, which is hyperventilating,

1:53:31.300 --> 1:53:36.160
 which is, ah, ah, ah, ah,

1:53:36.160 --> 1:53:38.800
 but not continuously for the five minutes,

1:53:38.800 --> 1:53:40.580
 because many people would pass out

1:53:40.580 --> 1:53:42.280
 or feel extremely uncomfortable.

1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:45.620
 It involves inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, very deep,

1:53:45.620 --> 1:53:47.400
 inhale through the nose, exhale through the mouth,

1:53:47.400 --> 1:53:49.680
 and then every 25 or 30 breaths or so,

1:53:49.680 --> 1:53:52.360
 doing a full exhale and holding one's breath,

1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:56.800
 lungs empty for about 25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds,

1:53:56.800 --> 1:54:00.000
 and then continuing until five minutes is up.

1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.340
 Subjects report, and our data indicate

1:54:02.340 --> 1:54:06.320
 that people feel a heightened level of autonomic arousal.

1:54:06.320 --> 1:54:07.820
 In fact, I can feel it right now,

1:54:07.820 --> 1:54:09.840
 even from that very brief

1:54:09.840 --> 1:54:12.080
 cyclic hyperventilation bout I just did.

1:54:12.080 --> 1:54:13.480
 You feel a heating up.

1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:16.160
 You feel a, some people will perspire.

1:54:16.160 --> 1:54:17.140
 Some people get wide-eyed.

1:54:17.140 --> 1:54:18.400
 Some people feel agitated.

1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:20.980
 That's adrenaline being released into your system.

1:54:20.980 --> 1:54:23.160
 Now, I'm not suggesting everyone run out and do this,

1:54:23.160 --> 1:54:25.240
 and if you have a predisposition to panic attack

1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:27.080
 or anxiety attacks, please don't do this,

1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:28.840
 because it is very stimulating

1:54:28.840 --> 1:54:31.080
 and can trigger those sorts of attacks,

1:54:31.080 --> 1:54:34.760
 but this five-minute-a-day protocol

1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:37.840
 of cyclic hyperventilation does lead to big increases

1:54:37.840 --> 1:54:41.100
 in autonomic arousal, so it's stressful, in air quotes,

1:54:41.100 --> 1:54:42.880
 but to bring us back to the,

1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:45.120
 my colleague David Spiegel's quote,

1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:47.140
 it really was him that said it, not me.

1:54:47.140 --> 1:54:48.920
 It's not just about the state that you're in.

1:54:48.920 --> 1:54:50.200
 It's about the state that you're in,

1:54:50.200 --> 1:54:51.900
 plus how you got there

1:54:51.900 --> 1:54:55.480
 and whether or not you directed entry into that state,

1:54:55.480 --> 1:54:59.880
 and that point of that one directs their own entry

1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:03.160
 into a state deliberately is really key

1:55:03.160 --> 1:55:06.880
 and I think has an important implications

1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:09.200
 for whether or not there's stress relief

1:55:09.200 --> 1:55:11.020
 and fear relief and trauma relief

1:55:11.020 --> 1:55:12.960
 from bringing oneself into a state

1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:14.560
 of increased autonomic arousal.

1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:15.440
 Why?

1:55:15.440 --> 1:55:18.480
 Because of the way that that fear

1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:20.160
 and trauma circuitry is organized.

1:55:20.160 --> 1:55:21.840
 If you recall, it's got these components

1:55:21.840 --> 1:55:24.000
 of how external events can trigger

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.320
 an internal stress response and fear response

1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:27.520
 and trauma response,

1:55:27.520 --> 1:55:30.920
 but there's that top-down prefrontal component

1:55:30.920 --> 1:55:34.640
 that can inhibit certain aspects

1:55:34.640 --> 1:55:37.980
 of that fear and threat circuitry.

1:55:37.980 --> 1:55:41.480
 Now, earlier we were talking about that prefrontal circuit

1:55:41.480 --> 1:55:43.980
 being engaged through narrative,

1:55:43.980 --> 1:55:46.680
 through self-directed deliberate narrative.

1:55:46.680 --> 1:55:50.120
 It's the person deliberately retelling the story.

1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:53.440
 Here, we're talking about a deliberate reactivation

1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:55.820
 of the sensations in the body.

1:55:55.820 --> 1:55:58.120
 So where I think this is all going,

1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:00.680
 meaning where my laboratory and the Spiegel Laboratory

1:56:00.680 --> 1:56:03.440
 and other laboratories out there are taking this,

1:56:03.440 --> 1:56:08.200
 is you can imagine a very brief five minutes a day,

1:56:08.200 --> 1:56:10.000
 two weeks was the time that they did this

1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:11.840
 for five minutes a day for two weeks,

1:56:11.840 --> 1:56:14.900
 intervention in which people with the support

1:56:14.900 --> 1:56:16.600
 of a clinician, we would hope,

1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:19.800
 would deliberately induce a physiological state

1:56:19.800 --> 1:56:21.680
 that's very stressful, right?

1:56:21.680 --> 1:56:23.560
 Not shying away from the stress response,

1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:26.860
 but increasing their own stress response deliberately,

1:56:26.860 --> 1:56:30.240
 and maybe in conjunction with recounting

1:56:30.240 --> 1:56:33.320
 the traumatic or fearful circumstance.

1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:34.960
 This is far and away different

1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:36.760
 than the kind of state of mind and body

1:56:36.760 --> 1:56:39.600
 that would come about in a ketamine-assisted,

1:56:39.600 --> 1:56:41.360
 trauma-induced psychotherapy session,

1:56:41.360 --> 1:56:45.920
 or a MDMA-assisted trauma psychotherapy session,

1:56:45.920 --> 1:56:50.480
 or in a purely narrative-based psychotherapy session

1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:53.520
 aimed at alleviating fear or trauma.

1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:55.880
 The reason I like these sorts of interventions is that,

1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:58.840
 A, they are very low cost or even zero cost, right?

1:56:58.840 --> 1:57:02.920
 One could, you could imagine doing this while journaling

1:57:02.920 --> 1:57:06.040
 or while recounting a particular experience.

1:57:06.040 --> 1:57:07.340
 Again, they're very compact.

1:57:07.340 --> 1:57:10.600
 Five minutes a day for two weeks

1:57:10.600 --> 1:57:12.380
 is what was done in this particular mouse study.

1:57:12.380 --> 1:57:14.100
 We don't know if that translates directly

1:57:14.100 --> 1:57:15.520
 to the human study or not.

1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:17.020
 What was interesting is that

1:57:17.020 --> 1:57:20.680
 if they used a longer daily bouts of stress,

1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:24.720
 like 15 minutes a day, that actually exacerbated the trauma

1:57:24.720 --> 1:57:26.980
 and exacerbated the fear.

1:57:26.980 --> 1:57:29.220
 So one has to be very careful.

1:57:29.220 --> 1:57:32.480
 Stress and deliberate entry into stress

1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:34.980
 and self-stressing are very potent tools.

1:57:34.980 --> 1:57:38.100
 They're very sharp blades that it does appear,

1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:42.980
 or it's likely can help alleviate trauma and fear.

1:57:42.980 --> 1:57:46.580
 But how long to do this, exactly what the protocol should be

1:57:46.580 --> 1:57:49.440
 is still something that needs to be cultivated.

1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:51.120
 I know there are going to be people out there

1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:53.320
 that nonetheless are going to want to experiment

1:57:53.320 --> 1:57:54.280
 with some of this.

1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:57.620
 I will say that I do not think it matters

1:57:57.620 --> 1:58:00.860
 how one gets into that stressed state,

1:58:00.860 --> 1:58:03.600
 provided it is self-directed.

1:58:03.600 --> 1:58:07.880
 And that therefore could be cold shower.

1:58:07.880 --> 1:58:09.000
 It could be ice bath.

1:58:09.000 --> 1:58:12.340
 It could be anything that induces an acute,

1:58:12.340 --> 1:58:17.340
 meaning a sudden onset of adrenaline and is self-directed.

1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:19.560
 That's really the key feature here.

1:58:19.560 --> 1:58:21.720
 So I'm very excited about these data,

1:58:21.720 --> 1:58:23.320
 both the five-minute intervention data

1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:24.560
 from the animal study,

1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:26.440
 the work that's ongoing in my laboratory

1:58:26.440 --> 1:58:27.960
 and Dr. Spiegel's laboratory,

1:58:27.960 --> 1:58:30.320
 and the work that's being done on the insula,

1:58:30.320 --> 1:58:32.360
 because I think what we're starting to see now

1:58:32.360 --> 1:58:36.160
 is a picture of fear and trauma and PTSD

1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:38.400
 that has this sensory component,

1:58:38.400 --> 1:58:40.100
 what's happening in the world around us,

1:58:40.100 --> 1:58:42.760
 this internal interoceptive component,

1:58:42.760 --> 1:58:44.440
 how appropriate are the signals

1:58:44.440 --> 1:58:45.560
 that are occurring in my body?

1:58:45.560 --> 1:58:46.520
 I mean, let's face it,

1:58:46.520 --> 1:58:47.560
 if you almost get hit by a car

1:58:47.560 --> 1:58:50.400
 and your heart rate is 140 beats per second,

1:58:50.400 --> 1:58:51.840
 and that lasts for a little while,

1:58:51.840 --> 1:58:52.920
 and you're stressed out,

1:58:52.920 --> 1:58:54.040
 and you don't get the best night's sleep,

1:58:54.040 --> 1:58:55.020
 that's pretty normal.

1:58:55.020 --> 1:58:56.760
 That means you have a healthy fear system.

1:58:56.760 --> 1:58:59.760
 If that persists and you're dealing with a lot of issues

1:58:59.760 --> 1:59:02.260
 a week later, six weeks later, two years later,

1:59:02.260 --> 1:59:06.040
 then it's moved into the realm of trauma and PTSD.

1:59:06.040 --> 1:59:09.240
 So we need to always be taking into account

1:59:09.240 --> 1:59:11.040
 the different components of the circuitry.

1:59:11.040 --> 1:59:14.280
 I do think that deliberate self-directed entry

1:59:14.280 --> 1:59:15.900
 into these short bouts of stress

1:59:15.900 --> 1:59:17.440
 is a very promising approach,

1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:20.160
 and it's one that if people are going to experiment,

1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:22.380
 I just, again, want to caution people with anxiety

1:59:22.380 --> 1:59:24.200
 or panic disorders, be very cautious,

1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:25.340
 probably don't do it.

1:59:25.340 --> 1:59:27.300
 Ideally, you would do this in conjunction

1:59:27.300 --> 1:59:29.560
 with support from a clinician,

1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:31.680
 but I'm also aware that there are a lot of people out there

1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:33.120
 that are dealing with trauma

1:59:33.120 --> 1:59:36.880
 and dealing with post-traumatic stress of various kinds,

1:59:36.880 --> 1:59:39.640
 and that they're desperate for various

1:59:39.640 --> 1:59:42.380
 self-directed intervention approaches.

1:59:42.380 --> 1:59:43.380
 So just very briefly,

1:59:43.380 --> 1:59:45.360
 I want to touch on some of the lifestyle

1:59:45.360 --> 1:59:48.920
 and supplementation factors that can impact things

1:59:48.920 --> 1:59:51.940
 like fear and trauma and getting over fear and trauma.

1:59:53.040 --> 1:59:55.120
 To make a long story short,

1:59:55.120 --> 1:59:58.400
 there are many things that we all can and should do

1:59:58.400 --> 2:00:01.080
 to support our overall mental and physical health.

2:00:01.080 --> 2:00:03.080
 And these are the foundational elements

2:00:03.080 --> 2:00:06.560
 of quality nutrition, what that means to you,

2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:08.900
 quality sleep on a regular basis,

2:00:08.900 --> 2:00:10.440
 ample sleep on a regular basis.

2:00:10.440 --> 2:00:13.360
 We have an episode on how to master sleep.

2:00:13.360 --> 2:00:14.480
 In fact, we have four episodes

2:00:14.480 --> 2:00:16.840
 that you can go to Hubermanlab.com or elsewhere

2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:19.880
 and scroll down, and you can find those episodes

2:00:19.880 --> 2:00:23.580
 in order to get your sleep really dialed in, as they say.

2:00:23.580 --> 2:00:27.660
 If you're sleeping regularly and for sufficient duration,

2:00:27.660 --> 2:00:30.880
 all of the systems of your fear circuitry

2:00:31.720 --> 2:00:32.740
 are going to function better,

2:00:32.740 --> 2:00:34.920
 mainly because the autonomic nervous system

2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:36.920
 becomes very dysregulated

2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:41.020
 when we are not getting good sleep on a regular basis.

2:00:42.260 --> 2:00:45.660
 Dysregulated means that out of nowhere,

2:00:45.660 --> 2:00:47.720
 we can have a higher propensity

2:00:47.720 --> 2:00:49.720
 to have sympathetic activation,

2:00:49.720 --> 2:00:52.160
 or we can feel really tired and wired.

2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:53.860
 That seesaw that I described earlier

2:00:53.860 --> 2:00:54.940
 of alertness and calmness,

2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:57.420
 of sympathetic and parasympathetic,

2:00:57.420 --> 2:01:00.820
 in that analogy, we can imagine that seesaw has a hinge,

2:01:00.820 --> 2:01:04.240
 and that hinge can neither be too tight nor too loose.

2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:05.780
 If it's too tight, you can get locked

2:01:05.780 --> 2:01:09.700
 into chronic activation of alertness or chronic fatigue.

2:01:09.700 --> 2:01:11.920
 If it's too loose, you're bouncing all over the place

2:01:11.920 --> 2:01:13.620
 and you might be a little tired and wired one moment,

2:01:13.620 --> 2:01:16.500
 and then really hyper alert.

2:01:16.500 --> 2:01:20.280
 Sleep resets that balance and resets that hinge

2:01:20.280 --> 2:01:22.540
 to the appropriate tightness, if you will,

2:01:22.540 --> 2:01:25.140
 so that all these circuits,

2:01:25.140 --> 2:01:27.520
 and not just the circuits related to fear,

2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:29.980
 but also the circuits related to cognition, clear thinking,

2:01:29.980 --> 2:01:33.820
 to be able to spell out very clear, detailed narratives,

2:01:33.820 --> 2:01:35.340
 to feel like you are in control,

2:01:35.340 --> 2:01:38.120
 you are deliberately bringing yourself into these protocols,

2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:39.380
 if that's what you intend to use.

2:01:39.380 --> 2:01:41.180
 All of that functions much better

2:01:41.180 --> 2:01:42.860
 when you're sleeping well and eating well.

2:01:42.860 --> 2:01:44.460
 We talked about social connection.

2:01:44.460 --> 2:01:48.760
 Those are all indirect supports of trauma relief

2:01:48.760 --> 2:01:51.420
 and of getting over fear, but they are essential.

2:01:51.420 --> 2:01:53.960
 I think of them sort of like the tide,

2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:56.740
 when the tide is high enough, a boat can leave harbor,

2:01:56.740 --> 2:01:58.920
 and if the tide is not high enough,

2:01:58.920 --> 2:02:01.500
 then that boat is going to be stranded on shore.

2:02:01.500 --> 2:02:04.300
 And in this analogy, the boat stranded on shore

2:02:04.300 --> 2:02:06.560
 is your attempt or anybody's attempt

2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:08.360
 to try and work through something.

2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:10.140
 Very hard to do when we're sleep deprived,

2:02:10.140 --> 2:02:13.140
 very hard to do when we're not fed enough

2:02:13.140 --> 2:02:15.540
 or fed the proper foods for you,

2:02:15.540 --> 2:02:17.420
 and that's a highly individual thing.

2:02:17.420 --> 2:02:19.900
 And social connection, as we talked about earlier,

2:02:19.900 --> 2:02:21.940
 creates a general sense of support

2:02:21.940 --> 2:02:23.980
 for the ability to move through things,

2:02:23.980 --> 2:02:25.560
 but also chemical support

2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:27.460
 at the level of suppressing tachykinin, okay?

2:02:27.460 --> 2:02:29.560
 So those foundational elements are absolutely key,

2:02:29.560 --> 2:02:31.180
 but they are indirect.

2:02:31.180 --> 2:02:33.940
 I just want to briefly mention a few of the things

2:02:33.940 --> 2:02:36.900
 that some people find great benefit from

2:02:36.900 --> 2:02:38.480
 in the supplementation realm

2:02:40.080 --> 2:02:44.260
 as it relates to anxiety, stress, fear, and PTSD.

2:02:44.260 --> 2:02:45.800
 But I want to point out that, again,

2:02:45.800 --> 2:02:48.460
 these are somewhat indirect in their support,

2:02:48.460 --> 2:02:53.140
 and most of them focus on reducing anxiety overall.

2:02:53.140 --> 2:02:54.700
 The two that I want to focus on

2:02:54.700 --> 2:02:58.140
 are two that I've never talked about on this podcast before

2:02:58.140 --> 2:02:59.680
 because I've done podcasts before

2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:02.580
 on stress and managing stress in the kind of shorter term.

2:03:02.580 --> 2:03:05.060
 So we've talked about Ashwagandha in a previous podcast.

2:03:05.060 --> 2:03:08.020
 Check out the podcast on stress

2:03:08.020 --> 2:03:11.060
 if you're interested in how that might be relevant

2:03:11.060 --> 2:03:12.440
 as well as other tools.

2:03:12.440 --> 2:03:15.620
 But the two are interesting ones.

2:03:15.620 --> 2:03:18.460
 The first one is saffron, of all things,

2:03:18.460 --> 2:03:21.540
 but there are 12 studies, believe it or not,

2:03:21.540 --> 2:03:25.580
 that orally ingested saffron at 30 milligrams

2:03:25.580 --> 2:03:28.700
 seems to be a reliable dose for reducing anxiety

2:03:28.700 --> 2:03:30.380
 on the standard inventories,

2:03:30.380 --> 2:03:32.120
 the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,

2:03:32.120 --> 2:03:33.380
 for those of you that want to know.

2:03:33.380 --> 2:03:34.680
 And these are significant effects,

2:03:34.680 --> 2:03:38.300
 and these were carried out in both male and female subjects.

2:03:38.300 --> 2:03:40.640
 Here, I'm only referring to human studies.

2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:42.500
 Several of these were double-blind studies.

2:03:42.500 --> 2:03:46.400
 There's a meta-analysis of the positive effects,

2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:49.220
 meaning anxiolytic effects,

2:03:49.220 --> 2:03:53.240
 anxiety-reducing effects, that is, of things like saffron.

2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:54.500
 Definitely have to check with your doctor,

2:03:54.500 --> 2:03:55.460
 make sure it's right for you.

2:03:55.460 --> 2:03:58.220
 But they're fairly impressive effects

2:03:58.220 --> 2:03:59.740
 when you really think about it,

2:03:59.740 --> 2:04:02.540
 given that these are legal over-the-counter substances.

2:04:02.540 --> 2:04:04.100
 Again, check with a doctor.

2:04:04.100 --> 2:04:06.980
 The other one is inositol.

2:04:06.980 --> 2:04:11.700
 Inositol has been shown to create a very notable decrease

2:04:11.700 --> 2:04:13.380
 in anxiety symptoms.

2:04:13.380 --> 2:04:15.540
 It's a fairly high dose that's used,

2:04:15.540 --> 2:04:18.780
 but believe it or not, the potency of this effect

2:04:18.780 --> 2:04:21.620
 is on par with many of the prescription antidepressants.

2:04:21.620 --> 2:04:23.640
 That's pretty impressive.

2:04:23.640 --> 2:04:25.940
 These studies, again, are double-blind studies

2:04:25.940 --> 2:04:29.640
 that all showed decreases in anxiety.

2:04:29.640 --> 2:04:31.860
 These were done in males and females.

2:04:31.860 --> 2:04:33.780
 The age range is very broad, which is great,

2:04:33.780 --> 2:04:38.260
 18 all the way up to 64 across the studies that I looked at.

2:04:38.260 --> 2:04:40.500
 One of the more important things is that

2:04:40.500 --> 2:04:42.220
 the dosages are quite high,

2:04:42.220 --> 2:04:45.540
 18 grams of inositol taken for a full month.

2:04:45.540 --> 2:04:49.220
 And it does take some time for these symptoms of anxiety

2:04:49.220 --> 2:04:52.220
 to be improved.

2:04:52.220 --> 2:04:55.200
 The low dose range was about 12 grams of inositol,

2:04:55.200 --> 2:04:58.900
 so as high as 18, as low as 12 grams.

2:04:58.900 --> 2:05:01.340
 But then again, pretty impressive results

2:05:01.340 --> 2:05:03.500
 considering that these are over-the-counter

2:05:03.500 --> 2:05:05.520
 supplement compounds.

2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:07.700
 There's even some evidence, I should just mention,

2:05:07.700 --> 2:05:10.100
 that the inositol is also used for things like

2:05:10.100 --> 2:05:11.900
 obsessive compulsive disorder.

2:05:11.900 --> 2:05:14.580
 We will do a full episode on OCD in the future.

2:05:14.580 --> 2:05:16.120
 You can count on that.

2:05:16.120 --> 2:05:19.140
 But in the meantime, inositol does seem to have

2:05:19.140 --> 2:05:22.520
 some positive effects on anxiety,

2:05:22.520 --> 2:05:27.380
 and therefore it might provide a supportive indirect effect

2:05:27.380 --> 2:05:31.300
 for people that are trying to work through trauma and PTSD.

2:05:31.300 --> 2:05:32.820
 Now, the question is, when would you take it?

2:05:32.820 --> 2:05:36.180
 Well, by the logic of what we spelled out today,

2:05:36.180 --> 2:05:39.900
 you probably would not want to take it during a session

2:05:39.900 --> 2:05:42.980
 or prior to a session where you were trying to

2:05:42.980 --> 2:05:45.100
 amplify the intensity of an experience

2:05:45.100 --> 2:05:47.020
 and the recounting of an experience

2:05:47.020 --> 2:05:50.420
 in efforts to eventually extinguish that experience.

2:05:50.420 --> 2:05:53.220
 Because if you put a drug or a compound of any kind,

2:05:53.220 --> 2:05:56.220
 prescription drug or supplement of any kind,

2:05:56.220 --> 2:06:00.460
 into your system, you are essentially short-circuiting

2:06:00.460 --> 2:06:04.000
 the extinguishing effect, right?

2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:06.420
 So you could imagine doing this outside of that session

2:06:06.420 --> 2:06:07.980
 as a way to kind of bring your system

2:06:07.980 --> 2:06:09.840
 back to baseline, perhaps.

2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:11.280
 So if you're going to use these sorts of things,

2:06:11.280 --> 2:06:12.860
 you want to think about them logically.

2:06:12.860 --> 2:06:14.820
 And this also really points to the fact that

2:06:14.820 --> 2:06:16.420
 many of the things that people are doing out there

2:06:16.420 --> 2:06:19.780
 to self-medicate, overuse of alcohol or other substances

2:06:19.780 --> 2:06:20.820
 to try and calm themselves,

2:06:20.820 --> 2:06:23.020
 because they have fear, anxiety, and PTSD,

2:06:23.020 --> 2:06:27.020
 are actually driving that fear, anxiety, and PTSD

2:06:27.020 --> 2:06:28.220
 deeper into their system,

2:06:28.220 --> 2:06:30.340
 or at least is not allowing it to relieve itself

2:06:30.340 --> 2:06:33.300
 through any attempts to recount or replay

2:06:33.300 --> 2:06:35.260
 and using these top-down narrative circuits

2:06:35.260 --> 2:06:36.540
 or other approaches.

2:06:36.540 --> 2:06:38.180
 And the last compound I want to mention

2:06:38.180 --> 2:06:39.860
 is a particularly interesting one

2:06:39.860 --> 2:06:42.260
 because it's neither an anxiolytic,

2:06:42.260 --> 2:06:45.100
 nor is it something that increases

2:06:45.100 --> 2:06:47.500
 overall levels of stress and alertness,

2:06:47.500 --> 2:06:52.500
 but it has some kind of MDMA-ish like contour to it.

2:06:52.800 --> 2:06:55.980
 It does not produce, as far as we know,

2:06:55.980 --> 2:06:59.880
 the same mental effects or physical effects as MDMA

2:06:59.880 --> 2:07:01.360
 by any stretch,

2:07:01.360 --> 2:07:03.240
 but that's the substance that I'm referring to,

2:07:03.240 --> 2:07:04.820
 rather, is kava.

2:07:04.820 --> 2:07:08.100
 Kava has been shown in eight studies

2:07:08.100 --> 2:07:11.660
 to have a very potent effect on reducing anxiety.

2:07:11.660 --> 2:07:13.700
 But what's interesting about kava

2:07:13.700 --> 2:07:17.140
 is that kava functions by increasing GABA,

2:07:17.140 --> 2:07:18.980
 this inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain.

2:07:18.980 --> 2:07:21.920
 Remember, GABA is the inhibitory neurotransmitter

2:07:21.920 --> 2:07:24.860
 that is used, that's employed by the very neurons

2:07:24.860 --> 2:07:26.180
 in the prefrontal cortex

2:07:26.180 --> 2:07:30.980
 that serve to inhibit the threat reflex.

2:07:30.980 --> 2:07:32.860
 So it seems to increase GABA,

2:07:32.860 --> 2:07:35.480
 but it also increases dopamine.

2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:37.920
 And that's a somewhat unusual compound.

2:07:37.920 --> 2:07:39.200
 I'm not aware of many compounds

2:07:39.200 --> 2:07:42.460
 that simultaneously increase GABA and increase dopamine.

2:07:42.460 --> 2:07:44.960
 And as you recall, that threat reflex has outputs

2:07:44.960 --> 2:07:47.140
 that tap into the dopamine system.

2:07:47.140 --> 2:07:50.620
 Now, that's a big leap to go from a compound

2:07:50.620 --> 2:07:52.000
 that increases GABA and dopamine

2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.920
 and look at a circuit spelled out on paper in front of us

2:07:54.920 --> 2:07:57.140
 and say, oh, well, there's GABA and dopamine in this circuit

2:07:57.140 --> 2:07:59.260
 and therefore this is a good compound to take.

2:07:59.260 --> 2:08:02.340
 But the effects of kava in human studies

2:08:02.340 --> 2:08:06.220
 are pretty interesting as it relates to anxiety,

2:08:06.220 --> 2:08:08.200
 stress, PTSD, and fear.

2:08:09.040 --> 2:08:10.300
 I'm not going to summarize all of these

2:08:10.300 --> 2:08:13.340
 because there are eight studies that I'm aware of,

2:08:13.340 --> 2:08:14.480
 but I'll just mention again,

2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:15.720
 these are double-blind studies.

2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:17.220
 So the trial design is solid.

2:08:17.220 --> 2:08:20.120
 The age ranges are anywhere from 18 to 64,

2:08:20.120 --> 2:08:21.660
 which is a nice broad age range.

2:08:21.660 --> 2:08:25.960
 The number of subjects is quite high, both men and women,

2:08:26.940 --> 2:08:30.740
 no signs of hepatotoxic signals,

2:08:30.740 --> 2:08:32.180
 so meaning a liver toxicity,

2:08:32.180 --> 2:08:34.300
 although of course, check with your doctor.

2:08:34.300 --> 2:08:36.860
 But what was interesting is that after a period

2:08:36.860 --> 2:08:38.840
 of about three weeks of treatment

2:08:38.840 --> 2:08:42.380
 with anywhere from 150 milligrams

2:08:42.380 --> 2:08:46.420
 of what are called active kava lactones.

2:08:46.420 --> 2:08:49.140
 Okay, so there are dosages that relate to that kava.

2:08:49.140 --> 2:08:51.260
 So 100 milligrams of extract of kava

2:08:51.260 --> 2:08:53.940
 is a kind of a reasonable typical dose in these studies,

2:08:53.940 --> 2:08:58.260
 but that spells out to a certain amount of kava lactone.

2:08:58.260 --> 2:09:00.380
 So you have to kind of boil down

2:09:00.380 --> 2:09:03.100
 to what is the appropriate dosage.

2:09:03.100 --> 2:09:04.940
 And it turns out it's extremely broad.

2:09:04.940 --> 2:09:06.580
 You'll see evidence of 50 milligrams.

2:09:06.580 --> 2:09:08.140
 You'll see evidence of 300 milligrams.

2:09:08.140 --> 2:09:09.740
 It's kind of all over the place,

2:09:09.740 --> 2:09:12.740
 but each of these studies alone and together

2:09:12.740 --> 2:09:15.740
 point to the fact that kava does seem to produce

2:09:15.740 --> 2:09:20.740
 a very potent anxiolytic and general kind of improvement

2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:23.700
 in depressive symptoms and reduction

2:09:23.700 --> 2:09:26.900
 in generalized anxiety across the board.

2:09:26.900 --> 2:09:28.180
 So it's an interesting compound.

2:09:28.180 --> 2:09:30.280
 I've never actually tried any of the compounds

2:09:30.280 --> 2:09:35.280
 I just mentioned, kava, saffron, or anisotol.

2:09:35.660 --> 2:09:37.740
 So I can't report on them personally.

2:09:37.740 --> 2:09:40.720
 I just know that a number of listeners of this podcast

2:09:40.720 --> 2:09:42.460
 are interested in supplements

2:09:42.460 --> 2:09:44.820
 and legal over-the-counter approaches

2:09:44.820 --> 2:09:46.780
 to their biology and psychology.

2:09:46.780 --> 2:09:48.220
 And so that's why I mentioned them.

2:09:48.220 --> 2:09:49.660
 Those were the three for which I found

2:09:49.660 --> 2:09:51.100
 the most convincing evidence

2:09:51.100 --> 2:09:53.180
 and the largest bulk of evidence.

2:09:53.180 --> 2:09:54.780
 So if you're interested in exploring those,

2:09:54.780 --> 2:09:58.620
 proceed with caution, but they do seem quite interesting.

2:09:58.620 --> 2:10:01.260
 So today we've reviewed a large amount of information

2:10:01.260 --> 2:10:05.020
 about the biology of pathways in the brain and body

2:10:05.020 --> 2:10:06.740
 that underlie the fear response

2:10:06.740 --> 2:10:09.460
 and that give rise to chronic fear

2:10:09.460 --> 2:10:12.060
 and in some cases to trauma and PTSD.

2:10:12.940 --> 2:10:16.100
 We also touched on a large variety of approaches

2:10:16.100 --> 2:10:19.600
 to dealing with fear, trauma, and PTSD

2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:23.940
 that currently exist in the clinical landscape out there.

2:10:23.940 --> 2:10:26.120
 I also touched on some of the emerging themes.

2:10:26.120 --> 2:10:28.580
 For instance, this short five-minute a day

2:10:28.580 --> 2:10:32.620
 deliberate self-directed stress of any kind

2:10:32.620 --> 2:10:34.620
 through respiration or other approaches

2:10:34.620 --> 2:10:37.500
 of increasing adrenaline as an approach

2:10:37.500 --> 2:10:40.740
 that might be viable, I should emphasize might be viable

2:10:40.740 --> 2:10:45.740
 for enhancing the speed or the potency of treatments

2:10:46.180 --> 2:10:49.780
 to reduce fear or eliminate trauma.

2:10:49.780 --> 2:10:52.220
 Most important I believe is to understand

2:10:52.220 --> 2:10:54.420
 and really think about the logical structure

2:10:54.420 --> 2:10:57.620
 of the circuits that underlie fear and PTSD.

2:10:57.620 --> 2:11:01.020
 Because in doing that, each of us, all of us

2:11:01.020 --> 2:11:03.220
 can think about what sorts of treatments and approaches

2:11:03.220 --> 2:11:05.140
 make the most sense for them.

2:11:05.140 --> 2:11:06.900
 I also hope that it will help people

2:11:06.900 --> 2:11:11.900
 lean into certain practices involving re-exposure,

2:11:11.940 --> 2:11:13.980
 provided that's done in a supportive environment,

2:11:13.980 --> 2:11:16.540
 re-exposure to a given traumatic event

2:11:16.540 --> 2:11:18.560
 in an attempt to extinguish that.

2:11:18.560 --> 2:11:20.220
 Obviously you want to do that safely,

2:11:20.220 --> 2:11:22.960
 meaning psychologically safely and physically safely.

2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:25.500
 There are great practitioners out there

2:11:25.500 --> 2:11:27.980
 that can help you with that work.

2:11:27.980 --> 2:11:29.540
 There are also a number of people out there,

2:11:29.540 --> 2:11:32.900
 I am certain, that are carrying certain traumas

2:11:32.900 --> 2:11:35.220
 or certain fears that they would like to alleviate

2:11:35.220 --> 2:11:38.260
 that are not in the extreme clinical realm.

2:11:38.260 --> 2:11:40.660
 And that's the reason why I touched on a number of things,

2:11:40.660 --> 2:11:42.580
 including some self-directed practices

2:11:42.580 --> 2:11:46.240
 that might be useful and reasonable for them to explore.

2:11:46.240 --> 2:11:48.180
 I realize we covered a lot of information today.

2:11:48.180 --> 2:11:50.340

 and there you can support this podcast

2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:26.460
 at any level that you like.

2:12:26.460 --> 2:12:27.840
 On this podcast episode

2:12:27.840 --> 2:12:29.840
 and in many previous podcast episodes,

2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:31.420
 I describe supplements.

2:12:31.420 --> 2:12:33.260
 While supplements aren't necessary

2:12:33.260 --> 2:12:35.100
 and perhaps aren't right for everybody,

2:12:35.100 --> 2:12:37.600
 many people derive great benefit from supplements.

2:12:37.600 --> 2:12:39.080
 It is important, however,

2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:40.320
 that if you're going to use supplements,

2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:41.980
 that they be a very high quality

2:12:41.980 --> 2:12:44.560
 and that you can trust that the amounts of supplement

2:12:44.560 --> 2:12:45.980
 listed on the supplement bottle

2:12:45.980 --> 2:12:47.780
 are actually what's contained in the bottle.

2:12:47.780 --> 2:12:50.380
 It's a serious issue with a lot of supplements out there.

2:12:50.380 --> 2:12:53.300
 For that reason, we partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-I-N-E,

2:12:53.300 --> 2:12:55.640
 because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency

2:12:55.640 --> 2:12:57.900
 with respect to the quality of their supplements

2:12:57.900 --> 2:13:00.660
 and the amounts of the supplements listed on the bottle

2:13:00.660 --> 2:13:02.780
 are actually what are contained in the bottle.

2:13:02.780 --> 2:13:04.700
 They've partnered with all the major sports teams

2:13:04.700 --> 2:13:06.020
 as well as the Mayo Clinic,

2:13:06.020 --> 2:13:08.840
 so we have a very high degree of trust with Thorne products.

2:13:08.840 --> 2:13:10.580

2:13:10.580 --> 2:13:13.740

2:13:34.700 --> 2:13:36.980
 there I do short neuroscience tutorials,

2:13:36.980 --> 2:13:38.280
 I offer a lot of tools,

2:13:38.280 --> 2:13:39.900
 oftentimes that don't overlap

2:13:39.900 --> 2:13:41.720
 with the content of the podcast.

2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:43.340
 And last but not least,

2:13:43.340 --> 2:13:45.140
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:13:45.140 --> 2:14:13.140
 I'll see you in the next one.
