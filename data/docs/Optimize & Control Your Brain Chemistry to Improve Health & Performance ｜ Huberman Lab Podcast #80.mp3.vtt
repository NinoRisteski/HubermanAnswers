00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.360
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.360 --> 00:13.360
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.360 --> 00:15.300
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.300 --> 00:17.920
 Today, we're going to discuss your brain chemistry

00:17.920 --> 00:20.800
 and how to control and optimize your brain chemistry

00:20.800 --> 00:22.840
 for all aspects of mental health,

00:22.840 --> 00:25.120
 physical health, and performance.

00:25.120 --> 00:27.520
 Many times before on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:27.520 --> 00:30.800
 and frankly, every time I'm a guest on another podcast,

00:30.800 --> 00:33.680
 I get questions about science and science-based tools

00:33.680 --> 00:36.740
 for things like enhancing sleep, enhancing focus,

00:36.740 --> 00:39.040
 enhancing creativity, improving relationships,

00:39.040 --> 00:41.500
 getting over grief, and on and on,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.220
 all of which are valid questions

00:43.220 --> 00:46.000
 and for which there are protocols that are based in science

00:46.000 --> 00:49.320
 and that work the first time and every time.

00:49.320 --> 00:52.300
 However, far more important than knowing a protocol

00:52.300 --> 00:55.000
 is understanding why a given protocol works.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.960
 That's why I'm always hammering on mechanism

00:56.960 --> 00:59.480
 and explaining the cells and circuits and chemicals,

00:59.480 --> 01:01.060
 at least to some detail,

01:01.060 --> 01:04.080
 so that people can understand not just what to do,

01:04.080 --> 01:07.720
 but why it works and therefore how to change a protocol

01:07.720 --> 01:11.280
 as their life circumstances change or as goals change.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.160
 Now, today we are going to go even a layer deeper.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.120
 We're going to explore the foundations of your biology

01:17.120 --> 01:21.360
 in your brain and body that allow any protocol to work

01:21.360 --> 01:24.460
 because as it turns out, all of the protocols out there,

01:24.460 --> 01:27.120
 whether or not it's a breathing protocol or a supplement

01:27.120 --> 01:30.600
 or a prescription drug or an exercise routine,

01:30.600 --> 01:34.760
 they all tap into and leverage a core set

01:34.760 --> 01:37.300
 of just a few biological mechanisms.

01:37.300 --> 01:38.140
 That's right.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.400
 Beneath everything you are able to do and feel,

01:41.400 --> 01:44.140
 and indeed beneath every protocol that allows you

01:44.140 --> 01:47.120
 to change for the better and optimize your mental health,

01:47.120 --> 01:48.860
 physical health, and performance,

01:48.860 --> 01:50.880
 there's just a small subset of chemicals

01:50.880 --> 01:53.640
 that you're leveraging toward that change.

01:53.640 --> 01:56.400
 So today we're going to talk about the four major pillars

01:56.400 --> 01:59.760
 of neurochemistry that allow you to, for instance,

01:59.760 --> 02:01.680
 be focused when you want to focus,

02:01.680 --> 02:03.820
 that allow you to relax when you need to relax

02:03.820 --> 02:06.920
 and de-stress, that allow you to optimize your sleep,

02:06.920 --> 02:10.000
 that allow you to optimize your exercise routine,

02:10.000 --> 02:12.720
 or to work through a pain point in relationship

02:12.720 --> 02:15.900
 or in career or in your relationship to yourself.

02:15.900 --> 02:17.920
 So what I can say for sure is that by the end

02:17.920 --> 02:21.820
 of this episode, you will have a much richer understanding

02:21.820 --> 02:24.120
 about how your brain and nervous system

02:24.120 --> 02:26.240
 and indeed your entire body work,

02:26.240 --> 02:28.660
 and you will have a much firmer understanding

02:28.660 --> 02:31.720
 as to which protocols and tools to reach for

02:31.720 --> 02:34.720
 given your particular goals in the moment,

02:34.720 --> 02:37.720
 in the day, across the week, across the month,

02:37.720 --> 02:40.720
 across the year, and indeed across your entire lifespan.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.400
 So what we're really going for today are principles,

02:43.400 --> 02:47.280
 deeper understanding of why any given protocol works,

02:47.280 --> 02:50.480
 and we are also going to discuss specific protocols.

02:50.480 --> 02:52.320
 Some of those protocols I've discussed

02:52.320 --> 02:55.080
 on previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

02:55.080 --> 02:57.680
 but I must say many of the protocols and tools

02:57.680 --> 02:59.560
 that I will discuss are brand new

02:59.560 --> 03:02.120
 and based on research that I have not discussed at all,

03:02.120 --> 03:05.480
 simply because the research papers came out only recently,

03:05.480 --> 03:08.800
 or these are papers that I only recently unearthed.

03:08.800 --> 03:11.280
 In fact, I'm going to share with you two recent studies

03:11.280 --> 03:14.120
 in a moment that are exceedingly important

03:14.120 --> 03:17.080
 for optimizing your sleep, and these are studies that,

03:17.080 --> 03:20.440
 again, I've never discussed in any episode on sleep

03:20.440 --> 03:21.840
 or on any other podcast.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.280
 So by the end of today's episode,

03:23.280 --> 03:24.620
 you're going to have far more knowledge

03:24.620 --> 03:26.240
 about your biology and psychology

03:26.240 --> 03:27.560
 than you did at the start,

03:27.560 --> 03:29.420
 and you'll be armed with many more tools,

03:29.420 --> 03:32.680
 and most importantly, principles so that you can navigate

03:32.680 --> 03:35.120
 not just the tools presented on this podcast,

03:35.120 --> 03:37.760
 but in the vast landscape of tools that are out there

03:37.760 --> 03:40.440
 for mental health, physical health, and performance.

03:40.440 --> 03:42.380
 The Huberman Lab Podcast is proud to announce

03:42.380 --> 03:44.640
 that we've partnered with Momentous Supplements.

03:44.640 --> 03:45.920
 We've done that for several reasons.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.960
 First of all, the quality of their supplements

03:47.960 --> 03:49.520
 is exceedingly high.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.600
 Second of all, we wanted to have a location

03:51.600 --> 03:53.200
 where you could find all of the supplements

03:53.200 --> 03:54.880
 discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:54.880 --> 03:56.860
 in one easy to find place.

03:56.860 --> 03:59.840
 You can now find that place at livemomentous.com

03:59.840 --> 04:01.200
 slash Huberman.

04:01.200 --> 04:04.560
 In addition, Momentous Supplements ship internationally,

04:04.560 --> 04:06.400
 something that a lot of other supplement companies

04:06.400 --> 04:07.660
 simply do not do.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.560
 So that's terrific whether or not you live in the US

04:09.560 --> 04:10.640
 or you live abroad.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.400
 Right now, not all of the supplements

04:12.400 --> 04:15.240
 that we discuss on the Huberman Lab Podcast are listed,

04:15.240 --> 04:16.920
 but that catalog of supplements

04:16.920 --> 04:18.640
 is being expanded very rapidly,

04:18.640 --> 04:20.400
 and a good number of them that we've talked about,

04:20.400 --> 04:22.760
 some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus

04:22.760 --> 04:25.040
 and other aspects of mental and physical health

04:25.040 --> 04:25.860
 are already there.

04:25.860 --> 04:28.720
 Again, you can find them at livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

04:28.720 --> 04:32.480
 Every so often, I come across a study or set of studies

04:32.480 --> 04:33.800
 that I get so excited about

04:33.800 --> 04:36.360
 that I start telling everybody in my immediate life,

04:36.360 --> 04:39.320
 and I insist on also sharing it with you,

04:39.320 --> 04:40.620
 the listeners of this podcast,

04:40.620 --> 04:42.520
 because I find the information

04:42.520 --> 04:45.320
 to be so incredibly interesting and actionable.

04:45.320 --> 04:47.120
 The two studies that I'm going to discuss

04:47.120 --> 04:49.640
 both relate to sleep and sleep states

04:49.640 --> 04:51.640
 and how to access better sleep.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.560
 The first one was published in the journal Cell Reports,

04:54.560 --> 04:56.320
 Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.440
 The title of this paper is

04:57.440 --> 05:00.360
 Rapid and Reversible Control of Human Metabolism

05:00.360 --> 05:01.880
 by Individual Sleep States.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.680
 We will provide a link to the study in the show captions.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.820
 The first author is Nora Nowak, N-O-W-A-K.

05:08.820 --> 05:11.840
 And basically what they did is they measured

05:11.840 --> 05:14.040
 the different forms of metabolism that occur

05:14.040 --> 05:15.680
 while humans sleep.

05:15.680 --> 05:17.860
 As far as I know, this is one of the first studies

05:17.860 --> 05:19.300
 of this kind.

05:19.300 --> 05:21.080
 There are many studies of metabolism.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.620
 There are many studies of sleep.

05:22.620 --> 05:25.680
 This study focused on how different states of sleep,

05:25.680 --> 05:27.420
 such as rapid eye movement sleep,

05:27.420 --> 05:28.800
 which is associated with dreaming

05:28.800 --> 05:32.200
 and high emotional content dreams versus slow wave sleep,

05:32.200 --> 05:34.340
 which tends to be more focused on physical repair

05:34.340 --> 05:36.240
 of the body, more mundane dreams,

05:36.240 --> 05:38.880
 how those different states of mind during sleep

05:38.880 --> 05:41.580
 relate to different aspects of metabolism.

05:41.580 --> 05:43.720
 And what they found was absolutely fascinating.

05:43.720 --> 05:47.040
 First of all, they found that sleep states regulate

05:47.040 --> 05:51.240
 more than 50%, half of all the metabolite features

05:51.240 --> 05:54.040
 detected in human breath.

05:54.040 --> 05:54.880
 What does that mean?

05:54.880 --> 05:56.400
 Well, it turns out that you can figure out

05:56.400 --> 05:58.760
 what humans are metabolizing in particular,

05:58.760 --> 06:00.480
 more lipids or more carbohydrate,

06:00.480 --> 06:02.640
 whether or not they're relying more on glucose metabolism

06:02.640 --> 06:04.420
 based on the contents of their breath.

06:04.420 --> 06:06.600
 This is true during waking and during sleep.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.760
 And this is what allowed them to do

06:07.760 --> 06:08.800
 these incredible measurements

06:08.800 --> 06:11.100
 of what's being metabolized during sleep.

06:11.100 --> 06:14.400
 They measured close to 2,000 metabolites in breath

06:14.400 --> 06:17.320
 every 10 seconds across the entire night's sleep.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.760
 And what they found was that there are major pathways

06:20.760 --> 06:23.620
 related to lipid metabolism, fat metabolism,

06:23.620 --> 06:27.200
 or to carbohydrate metabolism or other forms of metabolism

06:27.200 --> 06:30.760
 that are up or down regulated as human beings transition

06:30.760 --> 06:34.560
 between slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,

06:34.560 --> 06:36.200
 and waking, and you might say waking.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.040
 Well, yes, they also looked as people fell asleep

06:38.040 --> 06:39.880
 and as they emerged from sleep, and believe it or not,

06:39.880 --> 06:42.280
 every so often during sleep, you wake up,

06:42.280 --> 06:43.120
 you didn't know this,

06:43.120 --> 06:43.940
 but you wake up in the middle of the night,

06:43.940 --> 06:46.000
 you look around and you go back to sleep.

06:46.000 --> 06:46.840
 You're not aware of it

06:46.840 --> 06:50.480
 because you're still in a rather sleep-like state,

06:50.480 --> 06:52.040
 although you are awake.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.380
 What they found was that sleep

06:53.380 --> 06:54.800
 and the various states of sleep

06:54.800 --> 06:57.820
 regulated individual metabolic pathways.

06:57.820 --> 06:59.320
 They found, for instance,

06:59.320 --> 07:02.000
 that the switch from sleep to wakefulness

07:02.000 --> 07:04.180
 reduces fatty acid oxidation.

07:04.180 --> 07:05.480
 So that means while you're asleep,

07:05.480 --> 07:07.640
 you're oxidating more fatty acids.

07:07.640 --> 07:11.000
 And as you wake up, that becomes less the case.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.960
 And there's a switch in slow wave sleep

07:12.960 --> 07:16.080
 that increases fatty acid oxidation.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.040
 And there's this transition from rapid eye movement sleep

07:19.040 --> 07:20.520
 to other aspects of sleep

07:20.520 --> 07:23.460
 that brings about things like the so-called TCA cycle.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.960
 Some of you familiar with metabolism

07:24.960 --> 07:26.560
 will be familiar with the TCA cycle,

07:26.560 --> 07:28.760
 the so-called tricarbolic acid cycle,

07:28.760 --> 07:31.120
 intermediates, that's fancy nerd speak

07:31.120 --> 07:35.040
 for specific aspects of metabolism being regulated

07:35.040 --> 07:38.400
 during this rapid eye movement sleep transition.

07:38.400 --> 07:39.760
 What does all this mean?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.020
 And how is this actionable?

07:41.020 --> 07:44.220
 Well, on many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

07:44.220 --> 07:46.600
 such as the master sleep episode

07:46.600 --> 07:49.920
 and the episode that we're going into in further depth today,

07:49.920 --> 07:52.680
 we're going to talk about sleep and how to optimize sleep.

07:52.680 --> 07:57.100
 It's been thought of, but not really tamped down,

07:57.100 --> 08:00.320
 that quality and depth of sleep and duration of sleep

08:00.320 --> 08:02.840
 is important for metabolism during the daytime.

08:02.840 --> 08:03.960
 And indeed, that's the case.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.760
 If people are sleep deprived or they're not sleeping enough,

08:06.760 --> 08:08.600
 things like glucose metabolism, et cetera,

08:08.600 --> 08:10.640
 get really disrupted during the daytime.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.720
 But what this current study shows

08:12.720 --> 08:15.960
 is that the metabolism that you experience during sleep,

08:15.960 --> 08:17.200
 or to be more specific,

08:17.200 --> 08:19.800
 the range of different types of metabolism

08:19.800 --> 08:23.320
 that you experience during sleep may serve to tune up

08:23.320 --> 08:26.160
 or to ensure that the specific aspects of metabolism

08:26.160 --> 08:29.500
 that you require during wakefulness are working properly.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.800
 In addition to that,

08:30.800 --> 08:33.820
 this study clearly shows that getting enough sleep

08:33.820 --> 08:35.140
 allows you to transition

08:35.140 --> 08:37.760
 through all the various forms of metabolism

08:37.760 --> 08:40.720
 and use all those different forms of metabolites

08:40.720 --> 08:43.600
 during sleep in a way that's immensely beneficial

08:43.600 --> 08:45.800
 for the systems of your brain and body.

08:45.800 --> 08:49.960
 So the take-home message here is that as the authors state,

08:49.960 --> 08:53.660
 sleep and experiencing the different states of sleep,

08:53.660 --> 08:55.880
 slow wave sleep early in the night predominantly

08:55.880 --> 08:59.120
 plus rapid eye movement sleep toward the end of the night

08:59.120 --> 09:02.560
 is extremely important for optimizing metabolic circuits

09:02.560 --> 09:04.520
 for human performance and health.

09:04.520 --> 09:07.160
 In other words, by not getting sufficient duration sleep,

09:07.160 --> 09:09.800
 you're not allowing your body and brain to transition

09:09.800 --> 09:13.080
 through all the different aspects of fuel utilization,

09:13.080 --> 09:16.280
 and you're not teaching your brain and body

09:16.280 --> 09:19.080
 how to use similar types of fuels during wakefulness.

09:19.080 --> 09:20.760
 So again, all of this points to the fact

09:20.760 --> 09:23.080
 that we need to be getting sufficient quality

09:23.080 --> 09:24.240
 and duration of sleep.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.160
 So if you're sleep deprived even by an hour or so,

09:27.160 --> 09:29.440
 you're going to get far less rapid eye movement sleep

09:29.440 --> 09:30.600
 because rapid eye movement sleep

09:30.600 --> 09:33.520
 is what occurs toward the end of a sleep night.

09:33.520 --> 09:34.560
 During the early part of the night,

09:34.560 --> 09:36.760
 far more slow wave sleep.

09:36.760 --> 09:39.440
 In getting less rapid eye movement sleep,

09:39.440 --> 09:41.280
 we know it makes you more emotionally labile,

09:41.280 --> 09:44.100
 but now we know it's also going to alter certain forms

09:44.100 --> 09:47.720
 of glucose metabolism during the night

09:47.720 --> 09:49.720
 and during wakefulness.

09:49.720 --> 09:52.760
 So that all underscores the need to get sleep.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.720
 But then the question is how to get enough sleep

09:54.720 --> 09:55.640
 and how to make sure you get

09:55.640 --> 09:57.400
 into all these different sleep states.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.820
 And this is particularly important

09:58.820 --> 10:01.080
 for you so-called night owls.

10:01.080 --> 10:02.900
 There's a lot of controversy out there

10:02.900 --> 10:05.700
 as to whether or not different so-called chronotypes exist.

10:05.700 --> 10:07.800
 That is people who just naturally

10:07.800 --> 10:10.680
 or genetically want to be an early bird,

10:10.680 --> 10:12.040
 wake up early and go to bed early.

10:12.040 --> 10:14.520
 So these people that wake up at 4 a.m.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.720
 and would be most comfortable going to bed

10:16.720 --> 10:19.500
 by 7 or 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.

10:19.500 --> 10:21.400
 Then there are so-called night owls,

10:21.400 --> 10:24.820
 people that would feel best or tend to feel best

10:24.820 --> 10:28.720
 when they go to sleep at 1 a.m., 2 a.m., even 3 a.m.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.000
 and like to wake up later, 8, 9, 10,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.920
 or even 11 a.m. or noon.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.200
 And then of course, most people go to sleep somewhere

10:36.200 --> 10:37.880
 between 10 p.m. and midnight

10:37.880 --> 10:41.160
 and wake up somewhere between 5 a.m. and 7 a.m.

10:41.160 --> 10:45.000
 Or I suppose more typically 6 a.m. and 8 a.m.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.120
 Now, whether or not real chronotypes exist

10:47.120 --> 10:50.080
 or whether or not people simply select schedules

10:50.080 --> 10:52.320
 for sleep and wakefulness that they like

10:52.320 --> 10:53.700
 because of their social schedules

10:53.700 --> 10:55.000
 or the activities they enjoy.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.120
 For instance, some people like to really go out.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.220
 They like to go out dancing or hear music

10:59.220 --> 11:02.080
 or spend time in venues that are only open late at night

11:02.080 --> 11:04.440
 and don't even open until noon or after.

11:04.440 --> 11:07.440
 Other people like myself rarely go out at night,

11:07.440 --> 11:09.560
 but I like to get up early, I like to exercise,

11:09.560 --> 11:11.660
 I like to see the sunrise, et cetera.

11:11.660 --> 11:13.520
 So I don't know if I'm a morning person

11:13.520 --> 11:14.360
 or an evening person.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.400
 I just know the things I enjoy tend to happen

11:16.400 --> 11:17.500
 in the early part of the day

11:17.500 --> 11:19.760
 and the things that I don't enjoy quite as much

11:19.760 --> 11:21.660
 tend to happen late at night.

11:21.660 --> 11:22.760
 Regardless of whether or not

11:22.760 --> 11:26.120
 there are real genetic propensities to be a night owl

11:26.120 --> 11:27.360
 or an early bird

11:27.360 --> 11:30.880
 or a sort of typical person right there in the middle,

11:30.880 --> 11:32.800
 it's very important that people have some control

11:32.800 --> 11:33.840
 over their sleep schedule.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.080
 And even more important,

11:35.080 --> 11:38.760
 that people are able to get sufficient amount of REM sleep

11:38.760 --> 11:41.040
 and slow wave sleep for many reasons,

11:41.040 --> 11:42.680
 but including the reasons I discussed

11:42.680 --> 11:45.140
 in the previous study related to metabolism.

11:46.240 --> 11:48.040
 I'm very excited therefore about a study

11:48.040 --> 11:49.560
 that came out in sleep medicine.

11:49.560 --> 11:51.800
 This was a few years ago, but somehow I missed this one.

11:51.800 --> 11:53.360
 It was published in 2019.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.800
 And the title of this article

11:54.800 --> 11:57.040
 is resetting the late timing of night owls

11:57.040 --> 11:58.960
 has a positive impact on mental health,

11:58.960 --> 12:01.000
 physical health and performance.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.840
 This is a study done in humans,

12:02.840 --> 12:04.680
 focusing specifically on people

12:04.680 --> 12:07.480
 that like to stay up late and sleep in,

12:07.480 --> 12:10.880
 but who desire to be able to get up and feel alert

12:10.880 --> 12:12.520
 in order to go to work or study.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.460
 And they want to go to sleep a bit earlier.

12:14.460 --> 12:17.440
 And so there are a lot of questions embedded in this study,

12:17.440 --> 12:18.280
 in particular,

12:18.280 --> 12:20.080
 whether or not people can actually shift their schedule

12:20.080 --> 12:21.840
 by a few hours or more.

12:21.840 --> 12:24.020
 Some people out there contend that if you're a night owl,

12:24.020 --> 12:25.640
 that's just going to be impossible

12:25.640 --> 12:27.640
 or very, very challenging to do.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.240
 Turns out it's not impossible

12:29.240 --> 12:30.680
 and it's not even that challenging to do

12:30.680 --> 12:32.120
 provided you do the right things.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.580
 Just a brief overview of the study,

12:33.580 --> 12:36.000
 and then I'll give you the key takeaways.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.920
 It was a randomized control trial.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.600
 It involved a number of different people,

12:39.600 --> 12:40.960
 both male and female.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.160
 And what they did was they use non-pharmacological,

12:44.160 --> 12:47.160
 practical interventions in a real world setting.

12:47.160 --> 12:48.460
 Here I'm paraphrasing.

12:48.460 --> 12:50.840
 They use targeted light exposure.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.620
 They used consistent sleep wake times.

12:53.620 --> 12:57.720
 They used fixed meal times, caffeine intake, and exercise.

12:57.720 --> 12:59.560
 And this is one of the reasons I love this study so much

12:59.560 --> 13:01.040
 because I've done episodes where I've talked about

13:01.040 --> 13:03.240
 temperature, exercise, feeding,

13:03.240 --> 13:05.880
 and most importantly, light exposure as a way

13:05.880 --> 13:07.960
 to control and shift your sleep wake cycles,

13:07.960 --> 13:11.560
 your so-called circadian timing and entrainment.

13:11.560 --> 13:12.700
 What did they find?

13:12.700 --> 13:14.440
 Well, they found, quote,

13:14.440 --> 13:17.240
 significant improvements in terms of mood,

13:17.240 --> 13:19.920
 so far less depression and stress,

13:19.920 --> 13:20.980
 subjectively measured,

13:20.980 --> 13:23.040
 as well as improved cognitive performance

13:23.040 --> 13:24.160
 that was objectively measured,

13:24.160 --> 13:25.600
 so improved reaction times,

13:25.600 --> 13:27.720
 improved physical grip strength,

13:27.720 --> 13:30.540
 which is actually a measure not just of strength per se,

13:30.540 --> 13:32.640
 but also nervous system function,

13:32.640 --> 13:35.480
 and a number of things that people could do

13:35.480 --> 13:37.520
 in order to optimize their morning hours

13:37.520 --> 13:40.040
 even though they were night owls previously.

13:40.040 --> 13:41.000
 What do they have people do?

13:41.000 --> 13:43.240
 Well, I'm just going to list this off

13:43.240 --> 13:45.440
 in sort of a rapid fire succession.

13:45.440 --> 13:46.840
 Then we'll provide a link to the study

13:46.840 --> 13:47.880
 if you want to learn more.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.040
 First of all, they told participants

13:50.040 --> 13:52.240
 to try and wake up two to three hours

13:52.240 --> 13:53.880
 before their typical wake up time,

13:53.880 --> 13:54.720
 two to three hours.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.640
 That seems brutal to me and probably seems brutal to you

13:57.640 --> 14:00.000
 if you're somebody who typically wakes up at 10 a.m.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.120
 to try and get up at eight or even seven a.m. consistently.

14:04.120 --> 14:06.240
 But they were also asked to maximize

14:06.240 --> 14:08.560
 at outdoor light exposure during the mornings

14:08.560 --> 14:10.920
 for reasons that if you've listened to this podcast before,

14:10.920 --> 14:13.000
 if you've heard me talk about before,

14:13.000 --> 14:14.360
 that I'm constantly talking about,

14:14.360 --> 14:15.920
 I'll probably go into the grave shouting,

14:15.920 --> 14:18.600
 please get as much light exposure

14:18.600 --> 14:20.600
 from sunlight early in the day as possible

14:20.600 --> 14:22.760
 because it sets in motion a huge number of things

14:22.760 --> 14:24.300
 that are beneficial for your mental health

14:24.300 --> 14:26.840
 and physical health, including dopamine production,

14:26.840 --> 14:29.160
 timing melatonin production correctly,

14:29.160 --> 14:32.780
 reducing cortisol peaks late in the day, et cetera, et cetera.

14:32.780 --> 14:35.520
 So they asked them to get a lot of outdoor light exposure.

14:35.520 --> 14:37.120
 They didn't give them a specific amount

14:37.120 --> 14:39.360
 where they said maximize outdoor light exposure

14:39.360 --> 14:41.520
 during the mornings, the time before noon.

14:41.520 --> 14:43.360
 And again, they had them waking up two to three hours

14:43.360 --> 14:45.280
 before their habitual wake up time.

14:45.280 --> 14:47.400
 They were also told, and this is very important

14:47.400 --> 14:49.200
 if you're going to shift your schedule earlier,

14:49.200 --> 14:52.220
 to try and keep sleep wake times fixed

14:52.220 --> 14:54.680
 between their workdays and their weekends.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.360
 So not sleeping in on the weekends

14:56.360 --> 14:58.120
 or not having any sleep in days,

14:58.120 --> 15:00.840
 regardless of how well they slept the night before.

15:00.840 --> 15:01.760
 How fixed?

15:01.760 --> 15:06.420
 Within 15 to 30 minutes of their predesignated time.

15:06.420 --> 15:09.040
 So if they were waking up at seven o'clock one day,

15:09.040 --> 15:12.000
 they set their alarm and they made sure they got out of bed

15:12.000 --> 15:15.360
 at seven o'clock every day, plus or minus 30 minutes,

15:15.360 --> 15:19.520
 but never later than 7.30, never earlier than 6.30.

15:20.680 --> 15:23.200
 Participants were also asked to try and go to sleep

15:23.200 --> 15:26.200
 two to three hours before their habitual bedtime.

15:26.200 --> 15:28.060
 So again, these are people that want to stay up late,

15:28.060 --> 15:33.000
 like 11 p.m. perhaps, but even as late as 1 a.m. or 2 a.m.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.960
 And now they are asked to go to sleep two to three hours

15:35.960 --> 15:37.780
 before the habitual bedtime

15:37.780 --> 15:40.400
 and to wake up two to three hours earlier,

15:40.400 --> 15:41.560
 as I mentioned earlier.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.280
 They were also told, and I love this

15:44.280 --> 15:46.200
 because it fits with many of the things we've talked about

15:46.200 --> 15:47.720
 on this podcast before,

15:47.720 --> 15:50.820
 to try and limit light exposure during the evenings.

15:50.820 --> 15:54.800
 Dim the lights or limit altogether artificial lights.

15:54.800 --> 15:55.860
 Lot of reasons for that.

15:55.860 --> 15:57.560
 I covered that in the master sleep episode.

15:57.560 --> 16:00.720
 I covered that in the optimize health using light episode.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.840
 You can find those at hubermanlab.com.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.520
 They're asking them to do that here.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.920
 And they asked participants to keep a regular schedule

16:06.920 --> 16:11.120
 for their daily meals, not eating on the hour consistently,

16:11.120 --> 16:14.120
 you know, at 9 a.m., noon, 3 p.m. exactly,

16:14.120 --> 16:17.220
 but within, again, about 15 to 30 minutes,

16:17.220 --> 16:19.320
 they're always eating at the same times.

16:19.320 --> 16:20.560
 That was also important.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.680
 And again, that's because we have these so-called

16:22.680 --> 16:24.480
 food-entrained circadian clocks.

16:24.480 --> 16:27.440
 When you eat tells your body when to be alert

16:27.440 --> 16:30.240
 and when you're not eating, when to be asleep.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.120
 And they were told to not drink any caffeine

16:33.120 --> 16:35.200
 after 3 p.m. in the afternoon,

16:35.200 --> 16:37.540
 another theme that we've talked about on this podcast.

16:37.540 --> 16:41.840
 They were also told not to take naps after 4 p.m.

16:41.840 --> 16:45.140
 Naps are an interesting feature of the sleep-wake cycle.

16:45.140 --> 16:48.280
 To be very brief about this and to pull from the episode

16:48.280 --> 16:50.100
 that I did with world sleep expert

16:50.100 --> 16:52.960
 from University of California, Berkeley, Matt Walker,

16:52.960 --> 16:55.140
 naps are great for many people,

16:55.140 --> 16:58.000
 but don't nap if it interferes with your nighttime sleep.

16:58.000 --> 17:01.520
 And in this study, they told them don't nap after 4 p.m.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.920
 And if you are a napper, don't nap for more than 90 minutes.

17:04.920 --> 17:07.120
 10 minute naps are fine, 20 minute naps are fine,

17:07.120 --> 17:08.800
 zero minute naps are fine,

17:08.800 --> 17:10.700
 but don't nap for more than 90 minutes

17:10.700 --> 17:12.140
 and don't nap after 4 p.m.

17:12.140 --> 17:15.840
 And to exercise during the morning.

17:15.840 --> 17:17.440
 Now this one can be a bit controversial

17:17.440 --> 17:19.260
 because I know a lot of the PTs out there

17:19.260 --> 17:22.380
 and a lot of the online, you know,

17:22.380 --> 17:25.680
 gym rats and people who, and runners too for that matter,

17:25.680 --> 17:29.280
 will say, well, according to body temperature and research,

17:29.280 --> 17:31.080
 it's best to exercise in the afternoon.

17:31.080 --> 17:34.160
 Look, it's better to exercise sometime as opposed to no time

17:34.160 --> 17:37.400
 but if you're focused on how to shift your schedule earlier,

17:37.400 --> 17:39.240
 meaning get up early and go to sleep earlier,

17:39.240 --> 17:42.760
 this study had people exercise in the early part of the day,

17:42.760 --> 17:45.680
 certainly before 2 p.m. and ideally before noon.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.200
 So again, this is a really important study

17:48.200 --> 17:51.380
 because it combines a lot of different variables

17:51.380 --> 17:53.600
 to arrive at this very impressive shift

17:53.600 --> 17:55.880
 where people can get up two to three hours earlier

17:55.880 --> 17:57.680
 and then pretty consistently and reflexively

17:57.680 --> 17:59.440
 start going to bed two to three hours earlier,

17:59.440 --> 18:00.760
 feeling more alert during the day.

18:00.760 --> 18:02.440
 Again, improvements in cognitive performance,

18:02.440 --> 18:06.040
 mood and physical performance, grip strength, et cetera.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.600
 Very few studies are able to or willing to tackle

18:09.600 --> 18:12.920
 so many variables and combine them in one study.

18:12.920 --> 18:15.540
 This paper I think does a marvelous job of doing this

18:15.540 --> 18:17.960
 and is incorporating things that individually

18:17.960 --> 18:20.600
 each have some support for them in animal studies

18:20.600 --> 18:22.000
 and previous human studies.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.240
 But as far as I know, this is one of the few studies

18:24.240 --> 18:27.080
 that really combines all these different features

18:27.080 --> 18:28.880
 in one place.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.220
 Eating times, keeping those consistent,

18:31.220 --> 18:35.200
 getting maximal sunlight exposure earlier in the day,

18:35.200 --> 18:36.640
 getting up at a consistent time,

18:36.640 --> 18:40.180
 going to sleep at a consistent time and on and on.

18:40.180 --> 18:41.880
 It's a really marvelous study for that reason.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.280
 And I think for any of you that are night owls

18:44.280 --> 18:47.720
 and any of you that want to reinforce your early waking

18:47.720 --> 18:51.320
 and early to bedtimes, and I think for most all of you

18:51.320 --> 18:53.520
 who fall into that general middle category

18:53.520 --> 18:55.720
 of tend to go to sleep somewhere between 10 p.m.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.080
 and midnight, because that's most people

18:57.080 --> 19:00.600
 and tend to wake up sometime between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m.,

19:00.600 --> 19:02.520
 well, maybe you want to become more of an early riser

19:02.520 --> 19:04.160
 or maybe you're going to travel

19:04.160 --> 19:07.140
 or the seasons are changing and you want to shift your time

19:07.140 --> 19:08.920
 or you have a new job, et cetera,

19:08.920 --> 19:10.760
 or something that's actually very common

19:10.760 --> 19:12.000
 in terms of relationship struggle.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.560
 You want to match your wake sleep times

19:14.560 --> 19:17.000
 or maybe you want to offset your wake sleep times

19:17.000 --> 19:19.100
 from a significant other.

19:19.100 --> 19:21.260
 These sorts of approaches that I described here

19:21.260 --> 19:23.900
 and that are supported by the data in this paper

19:23.900 --> 19:26.700
 are absolutely powerful and science supported.

19:26.700 --> 19:28.180
 And I'm certain that if you were to apply them

19:28.180 --> 19:30.240
 that you would see essentially the same effects

19:30.240 --> 19:31.180
 that were observed here.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.880
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

19:32.880 --> 19:34.760
 that this podcast is separate from my teaching

19:34.760 --> 19:36.280
 and research roles at Stanford.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.360
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

19:38.360 --> 19:40.920
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

19:40.920 --> 19:43.500
 and science-related tools to the general public.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.560
 In keeping with that theme,

19:44.560 --> 19:47.080
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

19:47.080 --> 19:50.560
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens, now called AG1.

19:50.560 --> 19:54.280
 AG1 is an all-in-one vitamin mineral probiotic drink

19:54.280 --> 19:55.780
 that also includes adaptogens

19:55.780 --> 19:57.580
 and digestive enzymes for health.

19:57.580 --> 19:59.580
 Now, the probiotics are particularly important to me

19:59.580 --> 20:01.400
 because there is now a wealth of data

20:01.400 --> 20:02.900
 showing that our gut microbiome,

20:02.900 --> 20:04.720
 that is trillions of little micro-bacteria

20:04.720 --> 20:07.600
 that are good for us, impact our immune system,

20:07.600 --> 20:10.480
 our hormones, and the so-called gut-brain axis,

20:10.480 --> 20:12.540
 the connections between our gut and our brain

20:12.540 --> 20:15.760
 that go in both directions, gut to brain and brain to gut,

20:15.760 --> 20:17.760
 that control things like our mood,

20:17.760 --> 20:20.080
 our ability to think clearly and focus,

20:20.080 --> 20:21.900
 and overall brain health.

20:21.900 --> 20:25.840
 And with AG1, I'm able to optimize that gut-brain axis

20:25.840 --> 20:28.320
 through the probiotics and the vitamins, minerals,

20:28.320 --> 20:30.260
 adaptogens, and digestive enzymes

20:30.260 --> 20:31.860
 support a number of other things

20:31.860 --> 20:33.440
 that relate to immediate and long-term health.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.000
 In fact, anytime people ask me

20:35.000 --> 20:36.920
 what's the one supplement they should take,

20:36.920 --> 20:39.240
 I say AG1 Athletic Greens

20:39.240 --> 20:41.660
 because it's going to cover all of your bases

20:41.660 --> 20:43.560
 to the greatest degree.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.920
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

20:44.920 --> 20:47.600
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

20:47.600 --> 20:48.700
 to claim a special offer.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.480
 They'll give you five free travel packs

20:50.480 --> 20:53.520
 that make it easy to mix up AG1 while you're on the road,

20:53.520 --> 20:56.620
 and they'll give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.540
 Vitamin D3 and K2 are important

20:58.540 --> 21:01.240
 for cardiovascular function, calcium regulation,

21:01.240 --> 21:03.600
 and a number of other important aspects of health.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.920
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

21:06.920 --> 21:09.500
 to claim that special offer of the five free travel packs

21:09.500 --> 21:12.400
 and the year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

21:12.400 --> 21:14.920
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Thesis.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.240
 Thesis makes custom nootropics.

21:17.240 --> 21:20.400
 And frankly, I'm not a big fan of the word nootropics.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.960
 I've said that on various podcasts and on social media posts

21:22.960 --> 21:24.720
 and the reason I'm not a fan of the word nootropics

21:24.720 --> 21:26.520
 is it means smart drugs.

21:26.520 --> 21:28.160
 But as a neuroscientist,

21:28.160 --> 21:30.720
 I know that we don't have circuits in the brain

21:30.720 --> 21:32.840
 or chemicals in the brain for being smart.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.980
 We have circuits in the brain for focus

21:34.980 --> 21:36.960
 and for task switching and for creativity.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.360
 And oftentimes those circuits differ from one another,

21:39.360 --> 21:41.060
 although they collaborate to create things

21:41.060 --> 21:43.280
 that we think of as intelligence or focus

21:43.280 --> 21:45.060
 or creativity, et cetera.

21:45.060 --> 21:46.400
 Thesis understands this,

21:46.400 --> 21:48.900
 and for that reason has developed custom nootropics

21:48.900 --> 21:50.800
 that are matched to your particular goals

21:50.800 --> 21:53.200
 and to your particular biology.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.280
 They give you the opportunity to try several different blends

21:55.280 --> 21:56.260
 over the course of a month

21:56.260 --> 21:57.980
 and discover which ones work best for you

21:57.980 --> 21:59.520
 and which ones don't.

21:59.520 --> 22:01.040
 In addition to that personalization,

22:01.040 --> 22:03.440
 they take it a step further by offering free consultations

22:03.440 --> 22:05.960
 with a coach to help you optimize your experience

22:05.960 --> 22:08.220
 and dial in your perfect formulas.

22:08.220 --> 22:10.540
 I've been using Thesis for about eight months now,

22:10.540 --> 22:12.880
 and I can confidently say that their nootropics

22:12.880 --> 22:14.660
 are the best that I've ever used.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.940
 My go-to formula is the clarity formula

22:16.940 --> 22:19.960
 or the motivation formula when I'm going to work or workout,

22:19.960 --> 22:22.080
 meaning I'm going to do focus cognitive work

22:22.080 --> 22:23.160
 or I'm going to exercise.

22:23.160 --> 22:25.840
 I also like their energy formula prior to exercise.

22:25.840 --> 22:27.840
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

22:27.840 --> 22:31.000
 go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.560
 You can take a three-minute quiz that will help match you

22:33.560 --> 22:35.760
 to the best custom nootropics to start with,

22:35.760 --> 22:37.900
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

22:37.900 --> 22:39.280
 to try in that first month.

22:39.280 --> 22:42.000
 Again, that's takethesis.com slash Huberman

22:42.000 --> 22:43.500
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

22:43.500 --> 22:45.680
 to get 10% off your first order.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.560
 Today's episode is also brought to us by InsideTracker.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.920
 InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform

22:50.920 --> 22:53.640
 that analyzes data from your blood and your DNA

22:53.640 --> 22:55.160
 to help you better understand your body

22:55.160 --> 22:57.080
 and help you reach your health goals.

22:57.080 --> 22:59.880
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

22:59.880 --> 23:01.880
 for the simple reason that many of the things

23:01.880 --> 23:04.080
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

23:04.080 --> 23:07.080
 can only be measured from a quality blood test.

23:07.080 --> 23:09.560
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

23:09.560 --> 23:11.940
 you can also get insight into, for instance,

23:11.940 --> 23:13.320
 what is your biological age

23:13.320 --> 23:15.400
 and how does that compare to your chronological age?

23:15.400 --> 23:16.920
 And of course your biological age

23:16.920 --> 23:18.480
 is really the one that matters.

23:19.480 --> 23:21.560
 With InsideTracker, there's an additional advantage

23:21.560 --> 23:23.360
 over other blood tests and DNA tests.

23:23.360 --> 23:26.180
 And that is with many blood tests and DNA tests out there,

23:26.180 --> 23:29.520
 you get information back about hormones, lipids, et cetera,

23:29.520 --> 23:31.280
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

23:31.280 --> 23:33.440
 With InsideTracker, they have a very simple,

23:33.440 --> 23:37.920
 easy to use personalized platform that tells you

23:37.920 --> 23:40.280
 what sorts of changes to make in your nutrition,

23:40.280 --> 23:42.080
 possible changes to supplementation,

23:42.080 --> 23:43.680
 behavioral changes, et cetera,

23:43.680 --> 23:45.740
 that will allow you to bring the numbers

23:45.740 --> 23:48.000
 related to your hormones and your lipids, et cetera,

23:48.000 --> 23:50.440
 into the ranges that are optimal for your mental health,

23:50.440 --> 23:52.300
 physical health, and performance goals.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.760
 If you'd like to try InsideTracker,

23:53.760 --> 23:56.800
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

23:56.800 --> 23:59.840
 to get 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.

23:59.840 --> 24:03.680
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off.

24:03.680 --> 24:05.280
 Let's talk about how to optimize

24:05.280 --> 24:08.360
 and indeed how to control your brain chemistry

24:08.360 --> 24:10.800
 for sake of health and performance.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.600
 Now, in order to do that,

24:12.600 --> 24:16.020
 we all need to be on the same page about some basic facts.

24:16.020 --> 24:17.960
 Some of those basic facts involve learning

24:17.960 --> 24:19.640
 some basic biology.

24:19.640 --> 24:21.900
 And I promise that even if you don't have a biology

24:21.900 --> 24:23.300
 or chemistry background,

24:23.300 --> 24:24.440
 everything I'm about to say

24:24.440 --> 24:26.620
 should be accessible and clear to you.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.000
 The important thing to know is that your brain

24:30.000 --> 24:31.800
 and your spinal cord

24:31.800 --> 24:35.120
 and the rest of your so-called nervous system

24:35.120 --> 24:37.180
 control all the organs of your body

24:37.180 --> 24:40.120
 and that all the organs of your body feed back,

24:40.120 --> 24:42.160
 meaning they communicate through chemicals

24:42.160 --> 24:44.880
 and other means to your nervous system.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.120
 Now, your nervous system plays a particularly important role

24:48.120 --> 24:50.740
 in generating everything from sleep to wakefulness,

24:50.740 --> 24:54.640
 creativity, stress, calm, et cetera,

24:54.640 --> 24:59.400
 by way of a particular type of cell-cell interaction.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.860
 And that's called synaptic communication.

25:02.860 --> 25:04.560
 What is synaptic communication?

25:04.560 --> 25:06.780
 Well, in order to understand that,

25:06.780 --> 25:08.640
 let's dial back a little bit further

25:08.640 --> 25:10.800
 and try and understand for a moment

25:10.800 --> 25:13.240
 what makes up your nervous system.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.840
 In its simplest form, your nervous system

25:14.840 --> 25:18.560
 is made of nerve cells that we call neurons.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.800
 Neurons communicate with one another through chemicals.

25:21.800 --> 25:25.240
 They release certain chemicals that make other neurons

25:25.240 --> 25:28.480
 more or less likely to be electrically active.

25:28.480 --> 25:30.240
 What do we mean by electrically active?

25:30.240 --> 25:32.840
 We mean, as it sounds,

25:32.840 --> 25:36.280
 electricity passing down through cells

25:36.280 --> 25:40.280
 and then literally causing electricity in other cells.

25:40.280 --> 25:41.800
 The simplest way to think about this

25:41.800 --> 25:44.320
 is maybe when you were a kid or maybe even still now,

25:44.320 --> 25:46.800
 you would wear socks and you'd shuffle along the floor

25:46.800 --> 25:48.500
 to generate some static electricity

25:48.500 --> 25:49.680
 and then you'd touch someone

25:49.680 --> 25:51.800
 and you'd shock them with your finger.

25:51.800 --> 25:52.640
 I'm a younger brother,

25:52.640 --> 25:54.680
 so I'd occasionally do that to my sister.

25:54.680 --> 25:56.360
 I had friends, we would do that to one another.

25:56.360 --> 25:58.560
 I know it's kind of silly and childish,

25:58.560 --> 26:00.200
 yet it illustrates the principle

26:00.200 --> 26:02.280
 that we can generate electricity

26:02.280 --> 26:05.240
 and pass electricity to other beings

26:05.240 --> 26:08.080
 or in the case of neurons, from one neuron to the next.

26:08.080 --> 26:11.520
 The way neurons do that is that in between the neurons,

26:11.520 --> 26:12.400
 they're little spaces.

26:12.400 --> 26:15.000
 Those little spaces are called synapses

26:15.000 --> 26:18.020
 and neurons literally vomit.

26:18.020 --> 26:19.340
 Well, they don't literally vomit,

26:19.340 --> 26:21.600
 but they release little packets

26:21.600 --> 26:24.600
 of so-called transmitter chemical

26:24.600 --> 26:26.660
 into that space we call a synapse.

26:26.660 --> 26:28.680
 It travels across the synapse.

26:28.680 --> 26:32.080
 It attaches to the cell on the other side, the other neuron.

26:32.080 --> 26:34.320
 And then depending on what that chemical is,

26:34.320 --> 26:37.800
 it either makes that next neuron more electrically active

26:37.800 --> 26:40.740
 or less electrically active, so-called excitation.

26:40.740 --> 26:42.640
 It either excites the next neuron

26:42.640 --> 26:44.800
 to be electrically active also,

26:44.800 --> 26:48.200
 or it inhibits, it prevents the next neuron

26:48.200 --> 26:50.400
 from being electrically active.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.220
 So again, very simply, we have nerve cells

26:52.220 --> 26:53.440
 that communicate with one another

26:53.440 --> 26:55.600
 through electricity and chemicals

26:55.600 --> 26:57.520
 that inspire that electricity.

26:57.520 --> 27:01.560
 And the little gaps between neurons are called synapses.

27:01.560 --> 27:02.760
 If you can understand that,

27:02.760 --> 27:04.720
 I'm certain you can make it through the rest of the episode

27:04.720 --> 27:06.920
 and that you will get all the depth

27:06.920 --> 27:09.480
 and important detail that you need to know.

27:09.480 --> 27:11.540
 But I want to go just a little bit further

27:11.540 --> 27:15.160
 and explain that neurons don't just talk one-to-one.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.900
 There are trillions of neurons in your nervous system

27:17.900 --> 27:20.920
 that allow you to be happy, to be in love, to be sad,

27:20.920 --> 27:24.880
 to be in grief, to remember things and so on.

27:24.880 --> 27:27.760
 And what you do at any moment,

27:27.760 --> 27:30.140
 what you feel and what you think,

27:30.140 --> 27:34.840
 relates to which so-called neural circuits are active.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.760
 So a lot of times we think about brain areas

27:36.760 --> 27:38.240
 and we've all seen these pictures of the brain

27:38.240 --> 27:42.080
 where someone was in a FMRI scanner

27:42.080 --> 27:44.420
 or they were in a brain scanner of some sort

27:44.420 --> 27:46.320
 and they saw a picture of something

27:46.320 --> 27:49.580
 and a certain area of the brain lights up as it's called.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.120
 That lighting up of the brain really reflects the activity

27:52.120 --> 27:53.520
 of hundreds, if not thousands,

27:53.520 --> 27:55.920
 maybe even millions of neurons in that region.

27:57.060 --> 27:59.400
 Those images of brain areas lighting up

27:59.400 --> 28:01.700
 and indeed talking about brain areas lighting up

28:01.700 --> 28:03.500
 can be a little bit or a lot misleading

28:03.500 --> 28:05.800
 because in fact, no single brain area

28:05.800 --> 28:08.540
 controls any one single perception

28:08.540 --> 28:10.520
 or behavior or feeling state.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.980
 Rather, we have so-called neural circuits,

28:12.980 --> 28:17.720
 chains of neurons, chains of specific neurons, that is,

28:17.720 --> 28:20.160
 that create different states of mind

28:20.160 --> 28:22.360
 that lead to specific behaviors,

28:22.360 --> 28:25.180
 that lead to specific emotional states.

28:25.180 --> 28:26.940
 And those neural circuits are made up

28:26.940 --> 28:28.440
 of lots of different brain areas

28:28.440 --> 28:30.360
 that light up in particular sequences.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.760
 And when I say light up, excuse me,

28:32.760 --> 28:35.240
 what I mean is that particular brain areas

28:35.240 --> 28:38.760
 either excite or prevent the excitation,

28:38.760 --> 28:40.900
 that is, they inhibit other brain areas

28:40.900 --> 28:42.520
 in a particular sequence.

28:42.520 --> 28:46.200
 Much like keys on a piano played in a particular sequence

28:46.200 --> 28:48.120
 makes up a particular song,

28:48.120 --> 28:52.040
 particular brain areas activated or made silent

28:52.040 --> 28:55.940
 in a particular sequence leads to a particular behavior,

28:55.940 --> 28:57.640
 like getting up out of a chair

28:57.640 --> 28:59.500
 or a particular feeling state,

28:59.500 --> 29:02.200
 like being particularly happy one day when you wake up

29:02.200 --> 29:03.940
 or particularly depressed,

29:03.940 --> 29:07.040
 whether or not that depression is caused by a life event

29:07.040 --> 29:09.560
 or whether or not it arises spontaneously.

29:09.560 --> 29:11.500
 So we have neurons, we have synapses,

29:11.500 --> 29:14.120
 and we have neural circuits.

29:14.120 --> 29:16.680
 And vitally important is the fact

29:16.680 --> 29:19.900
 that which neural circuits are active

29:19.900 --> 29:23.160
 and which neural circuits are likely to be less active

29:23.160 --> 29:24.880
 at any given moment

29:24.880 --> 29:28.680
 depends on two major categories of chemicals.

29:28.680 --> 29:30.680
 It depends on hormones

29:30.680 --> 29:34.400
 and it depends on so-called neuromodulators.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.820
 Now, we're mainly going to focus on neuromodulators today

29:36.820 --> 29:38.280
 because those are the things

29:38.280 --> 29:40.160
 that if you can learn to control them,

29:40.160 --> 29:42.480
 and indeed there are tools to control them,

29:42.480 --> 29:45.920
 then you can control which neural circuits

29:45.920 --> 29:48.960
 are more likely or less likely to be active in you

29:48.960 --> 29:50.120
 at any given moment.

29:50.120 --> 29:53.320
 And in doing so, you can control whether or not

29:53.320 --> 29:57.040
 you are going to be alert and focused or deeply asleep.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.440
 You can control whether or not

29:58.440 --> 30:00.240
 you are going to be in a creative state

30:00.240 --> 30:02.560
 or whether or not you're going to be in a state of mind,

30:02.560 --> 30:07.200
 more fit, more capable that is of doing focused work

30:07.200 --> 30:09.720
 or math or more so-called linear types of work

30:09.720 --> 30:10.920
 where there's a correct answer.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.100
 There's a specific thing to follow

30:13.100 --> 30:15.800
 and you're simply going to plug and chug as it were

30:15.800 --> 30:18.140
 through a particular set of steps

30:18.140 --> 30:19.400
 in order to accomplish something.

30:19.400 --> 30:21.000
 Or for instance, whether or not

30:21.000 --> 30:23.620
 you're going to be in a more relaxed and creative state

30:23.620 --> 30:25.700
 where you're thinking about new ideas

30:25.700 --> 30:27.560
 or new ideas are just seem to be

30:27.560 --> 30:29.760
 spontaneously coming to mind.

30:29.760 --> 30:34.760
 All of that can be controlled to a considerable extent

30:34.840 --> 30:38.100
 by leveraging these so-called neuromodulators.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.800
 What are neuromodulators?

30:39.800 --> 30:44.040
 Neuromodulators are particular chemicals

30:44.040 --> 30:46.840
 that make it likely that certain neural circuits

30:46.840 --> 30:48.760
 will be active and not others.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.480
 And the four neuromodulators

30:50.480 --> 30:51.800
 that we're going to talk about today

30:51.800 --> 30:55.520
 that are of the utmost importance for your goals

30:55.520 --> 31:00.360
 are dopamine, epinephrine, also called adrenaline,

31:00.360 --> 31:03.320
 serotonin, and acetylcholine.

31:03.320 --> 31:07.180
 That's dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.220
 Today, I'm going to teach you

31:09.220 --> 31:11.140
 how each of those different categories

31:11.140 --> 31:15.280
 of neuromodulators work and the things that you can do

31:15.280 --> 31:18.200
 to control those neuromodulators,

31:18.200 --> 31:21.360
 that is increase them or decrease them

31:21.360 --> 31:24.600
 through behavioral tools and supplementation

31:24.600 --> 31:28.120
 in ways that allow you to access the brain and body states

31:28.120 --> 31:30.700
 that you want at the times that you want.

31:30.700 --> 31:31.680
 Just very quickly,

31:31.680 --> 31:35.040
 I want to talk about how neuromodulators are able to work

31:35.040 --> 31:37.720
 regardless of whether or not it's dopamine or serotonin

31:37.720 --> 31:39.440
 or epinephrine, et cetera.

31:40.540 --> 31:43.340
 There are many features of how neuromodulators work,

31:43.340 --> 31:45.560
 but for sake of today's discussion,

31:45.560 --> 31:48.040
 we only need to focus on two of those features.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.480
 And those are fast acting features

31:50.480 --> 31:52.360
 and longer slower features

31:52.360 --> 31:54.980
 or what we call baseline features.

31:54.980 --> 31:58.680
 What am I talking about when I say faster or baseline?

31:58.680 --> 32:01.760
 Well, consider that at any given moment,

32:01.760 --> 32:03.380
 whether or not you're asleep or awake,

32:03.380 --> 32:05.880
 whether or not it's morning or afternoon or night,

32:05.880 --> 32:09.200
 you have some amount of dopamine being released

32:09.200 --> 32:12.040
 in your brain and body, some amount of serotonin,

32:12.040 --> 32:13.680
 some amount of epinephrine,

32:13.680 --> 32:16.560
 and some amount of acetylcholine.

32:16.560 --> 32:19.260
 It is rarely, if ever the case,

32:19.260 --> 32:22.840
 that you have zero dopamine or zero serotonin.

32:22.840 --> 32:25.420
 So often we hear about someone being dopamine depleted,

32:25.420 --> 32:27.680
 or these days you hear a lot about that anyways,

32:27.680 --> 32:31.640
 or you'll hear that people's serotonin is bottomed out.

32:31.640 --> 32:33.840
 In reality, none of these neuromodulators

32:33.840 --> 32:36.200
 ever disappear completely,

32:36.200 --> 32:39.060
 but they tend to be present at different levels

32:39.060 --> 32:40.920
 or different relative levels.

32:40.920 --> 32:42.620
 Another important thing to point out

32:42.620 --> 32:45.060
 is that they don't work alone.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.680
 In fact, as you'll soon learn,

32:46.680 --> 32:50.000
 dopamine and epinephrine are close cousins

32:50.000 --> 32:53.080
 that collaborate in terms of creating states

32:53.080 --> 32:55.400
 of focus and motivation, for instance,

32:55.400 --> 32:58.040
 or in creating states of energy

32:58.040 --> 33:00.280
 and the pursuit of particular goals.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.340
 When I say they're close cousins,

33:01.340 --> 33:04.800
 what I mean is that they tend to impact

33:04.800 --> 33:07.120
 some of the same neural circuits,

33:07.120 --> 33:08.280
 and believe it or not,

33:08.280 --> 33:11.760
 dopamine and epinephrine are chemically related too.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.760
 I'll just tell you right now that epinephrine

33:13.760 --> 33:16.980
 is actually derived from dopamine chemically.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.860
 Epinephrine, that is adrenaline,

33:19.860 --> 33:22.720
 is made from the molecule dopamine.

33:22.720 --> 33:26.260
 Now, dopamine and serotonin can also work together

33:26.260 --> 33:28.280
 to impact certain circuits in the brain,

33:28.280 --> 33:32.060
 but in large part, they operate on separate circuits.

33:32.060 --> 33:35.240
 And acetylcholine, which you'll soon learn

33:35.240 --> 33:38.380
 is involved in states of focus and can actually open up.

33:38.380 --> 33:41.480
 It can literally create states in the mind

33:41.480 --> 33:43.700
 in which your brain is more plastic

33:43.700 --> 33:46.320
 and able to change and learn more quickly.

33:46.320 --> 33:48.720
 Well, acetylcholine can do that on its own,

33:48.720 --> 33:51.160
 but rarely does it do it on its own.

33:51.160 --> 33:53.360
 More typically, it gets assistance

33:53.360 --> 33:55.260
 from some of the other neuromodulators.

33:55.260 --> 33:57.040
 Now, that might seem like it complicates the picture,

33:57.040 --> 33:59.320
 but it actually makes the picture far simpler

33:59.320 --> 34:01.380
 because what we can say for sure

34:01.380 --> 34:04.840
 is that the fast actions of dopamine,

34:04.840 --> 34:06.560
 or the fast actions of epinephrine,

34:06.560 --> 34:09.840
 serotonin, or acetylcholine are actions that occur

34:09.840 --> 34:11.920
 on the order of seconds or minutes

34:11.920 --> 34:13.960
 or up to about an hour or so.

34:13.960 --> 34:17.240
 Whereas the slower actions of those neuromodulators

34:17.240 --> 34:21.300
 tend to occur on the order of hours, days, or even weeks.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.320
 Now, perhaps surprisingly, I'd like to focus

34:23.320 --> 34:26.380
 on the slow actions of the neuromodulators first,

34:26.380 --> 34:29.260
 because those slow actions of the neuromodulators

34:29.260 --> 34:33.200
 are happening in you and in me and in everyone right now.

34:33.200 --> 34:36.020
 And they set the backdrop, the context,

34:36.020 --> 34:39.040
 in which the various tools to manipulate dopamine,

34:39.040 --> 34:43.640
 epinephrine, serotonin, or acetylcholine will work.

34:43.640 --> 34:45.920
 What do I mean by the context or the backdrop

34:45.920 --> 34:47.040
 or the baseline?

34:47.040 --> 34:50.520
 Well, it's fair to say that most people

34:50.520 --> 34:52.660
 are awake during the daytime and asleep at night.

34:52.660 --> 34:54.280
 I do realize that there are people

34:54.280 --> 34:57.340
 who are going to be doing shift work

34:57.340 --> 34:59.200
 or they're raising young children,

34:59.200 --> 35:01.880
 or that might have a sick person at home

35:01.880 --> 35:03.160
 that they're tending to, et cetera,

35:03.160 --> 35:05.760
 or even have insomnia, they're tending to them.

35:05.760 --> 35:09.080
 So schedules of sleep and wakefulness will vary,

35:09.080 --> 35:11.100
 but in general, everybody,

35:11.100 --> 35:13.240
 regardless of whether or not you're nocturnal

35:13.240 --> 35:16.500
 or you're so-called diurnal, you're awake during the day,

35:16.500 --> 35:18.480
 pretty much everybody follows a schedule

35:18.480 --> 35:22.880
 in which from zero to nine hours after waking,

35:23.720 --> 35:25.060
 that is from the time you wake up

35:25.060 --> 35:28.260
 until about nine hours later,

35:28.260 --> 35:32.380
 the neuromodulators dopamine and epinephrine

35:32.380 --> 35:34.320
 tend to be at their highest levels

35:34.320 --> 35:39.060
 that they will be at any point in the 24 hour period,

35:39.060 --> 35:41.040
 in any period of the day.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.960
 So we can call this zero to nine hour period

35:43.960 --> 35:46.600
 phase one of the day, just for simplicity.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.760
 And I've referred to this before in a previous episode,

35:49.760 --> 35:52.220
 but not in this exact context.

35:53.460 --> 35:57.040
 From nine to about 16 hours is what we will call phase two.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.280
 And that's when dopamine and epinephrine levels

36:00.280 --> 36:04.220
 tend to subside a bit compared to the earlier phase one

36:04.220 --> 36:08.840
 part of the day, and serotonin levels start to increase.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.880
 And then phase three of the 24 hour cycle,

36:11.880 --> 36:13.680
 which is from about, and again,

36:13.680 --> 36:15.360
 about the zero approximates,

36:15.360 --> 36:17.400
 from about 17 hours after waking

36:17.400 --> 36:20.000
 until about 24 hours after waking

36:20.000 --> 36:22.440
 is phase three of the day.

36:22.440 --> 36:26.600
 And during that time, there is chaos

36:26.600 --> 36:28.760
 in terms of which neuromodulators

36:28.760 --> 36:30.280
 are most present in the brain.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.540
 And why chaos, what I mean is that during sleep,

36:33.540 --> 36:35.840
 you have incredible peaks in acetylcholine

36:35.840 --> 36:37.880
 and drops in acetylcholine.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.640
 You have incredible peaks in dopamine

36:39.640 --> 36:41.520
 and drops in dopamine.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.240
 You have incredible peaks in serotonin

36:43.240 --> 36:45.120
 and drops in serotonin.

36:45.120 --> 36:48.160
 Most often, you are not going to see much,

36:48.160 --> 36:51.360
 if any, release of epinephrine, adrenaline.

36:51.360 --> 36:54.840
 And that's because epinephrine, also called adrenaline,

36:54.840 --> 36:59.060
 tends to wake us up and put us into action mode behaviors.

36:59.060 --> 37:01.160
 And that's simply not happening during sleep.

37:01.160 --> 37:03.480
 But for the other three neuromodulators,

37:03.480 --> 37:06.600
 across the night, it's sort of chaos.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.580
 You've got peaks and drops and peaks and drops

37:08.580 --> 37:09.680
 in different combinations

37:09.680 --> 37:11.360
 than you would ever see in wakefulness.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.280
 And this plays important roles in dreaming,

37:13.280 --> 37:16.800
 important roles in some of the reparative functions of sleep.

37:16.800 --> 37:20.160
 The point is that during that phase three,

37:20.160 --> 37:22.560
 the levels of neuromodulators are all over the place,

37:22.560 --> 37:24.760
 but it's not random, right?

37:24.760 --> 37:26.880
 I say it's chaos, but it's organized

37:26.880 --> 37:29.620
 according to the specific reparative goals of sleep,

37:29.620 --> 37:32.560
 the specific metabolic roles of sleep, et cetera.

37:32.560 --> 37:35.500
 We're not going to focus too much on phase three today,

37:35.500 --> 37:38.620
 because phase three of the 24 hour cycle,

37:38.620 --> 37:40.480
 that 17 to 24 hour period,

37:40.480 --> 37:42.880
 is one in which you ought to be deeply asleep,

37:42.880 --> 37:44.840
 whether or not you're nocturnal or diurnal, right?

37:44.840 --> 37:47.900
 17 hours after waking, you ought to be asleep.

37:47.900 --> 37:50.380
 And there are a lot of episodes of this podcast,

37:50.380 --> 37:52.720
 and indeed today I started talking about

37:52.720 --> 37:54.880
 two particular studies related to sleep.

37:54.880 --> 37:57.760
 There are a lot of tools to enhance sleep, et cetera.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.320
 And of course, there are things that you can do

37:59.320 --> 38:03.000
 in the late portion of phase two of the day

38:03.000 --> 38:05.680
 in order to enhance your transition time

38:05.680 --> 38:07.440
 into and depth of sleep.

38:07.440 --> 38:10.040
 But you can't really do much during sleep, right?

38:10.040 --> 38:11.200
 You're not taking supplements,

38:11.200 --> 38:13.220
 you're not doing breathing practices.

38:13.220 --> 38:14.540
 There are things to fall back asleep,

38:14.540 --> 38:15.900
 but you're not really doing much during sleep.

38:15.900 --> 38:17.560
 So we're mainly going to focus

38:17.560 --> 38:20.560
 on what we're calling phase one and phase two.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.700
 Phase one being this dopamine epinephrine dominated

38:23.700 --> 38:27.720
 phase of our day, and phase two being this more serotonergic

38:27.720 --> 38:30.040
 or serotonin dominated portion of the day.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.000
 And then you might say, well, what about acetylcholine?

38:33.000 --> 38:34.080
 Forgot about acetylcholine.

38:34.080 --> 38:35.720
 Well, we didn't forget about acetylcholine.

38:35.720 --> 38:39.640
 Acetylcholine is under control more in terms

38:39.640 --> 38:42.920
 of what we happen to be doing at any given moment,

38:42.920 --> 38:44.720
 whether or not we're focusing or not focusing,

38:44.720 --> 38:47.160
 whether or not we're learning or not learning.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.240
 And here I'm referring to acetylcholine specifically

38:49.240 --> 38:51.720
 in the context of the brain and thinking,

38:51.720 --> 38:54.680
 because as some of you are probably shouting out there,

38:54.680 --> 38:56.600
 right, if you're exercise physiologists

38:56.600 --> 39:00.240
 or you know anything about how the brain controls movement,

39:00.240 --> 39:03.840
 acetylcholine is used at the nerve to muscle synapse, right?

39:03.840 --> 39:07.360
 So neurons don't just control other neurons electrically.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.100
 The way you're able to move in fact is

39:09.100 --> 39:11.600
 because neurons are controlling the electric activity

39:11.600 --> 39:15.480
 of muscles, literally the contraction of muscle fibers,

39:15.480 --> 39:18.320
 and that control is exerted

39:18.320 --> 39:19.680
 through the release of acetylcholine.

39:19.680 --> 39:21.680
 So acetylcholine is working at muscles as well,

39:21.680 --> 39:23.480
 but we're not focused on that today.

39:23.480 --> 39:27.800
 We're focused on what we can do during phase one of the day

39:27.800 --> 39:30.060
 and what we can do during phase two of the day

39:30.060 --> 39:33.220
 to control the specific neuromodulators,

39:33.220 --> 39:36.000
 dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine

39:36.000 --> 39:37.920
 toward particular end goals.

39:37.920 --> 39:40.880
 And as I've been harping on for the last five

39:40.880 --> 39:44.160
 or 10 minutes or so, it is important to understand

39:44.160 --> 39:46.400
 that in the early phase one part of the day,

39:46.400 --> 39:48.440
 again, zero to nine hours,

39:48.440 --> 39:52.680
 dopamine and epinephrine already dominate

39:52.680 --> 39:54.720
 the neuromodulator landscape.

39:54.720 --> 39:56.720
 That is, they are already elevated

39:56.720 --> 39:58.680
 and then they will taper off in phase two.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.360
 Whereas in phase two of the day,

40:00.360 --> 40:02.440
 serotonin tends to dominate

40:02.440 --> 40:05.600
 more than dopamine and epinephrine.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.000
 And so if you think about that,

40:08.000 --> 40:11.620
 what it means is that if your goal is to increase serotonin

40:11.620 --> 40:14.480
 in order to get some particular effect

40:14.480 --> 40:19.060
 on your mental performance or physical performance or health,

40:19.060 --> 40:21.880
 or if your goal is to increase your dopamine

40:21.880 --> 40:24.240
 or epinephrine to get some particular effect

40:24.240 --> 40:28.560
 on your mental health, physical performance, et cetera,

40:28.560 --> 40:32.200
 well, then you need to consider what the background level

40:32.200 --> 40:35.980
 of dopamine or epinephrine or serotonin happens to be.

40:35.980 --> 40:39.880
 Because in doing so, you will know which tool to select

40:39.880 --> 40:44.000
 and how hard you need to push on that tool, right?

40:44.000 --> 40:47.120
 If your levels of dopamine are already riding pretty high

40:47.120 --> 40:49.040
 because it's the early part of the day,

40:49.040 --> 40:51.960
 well, then it doesn't take a whole lot more

40:51.960 --> 40:55.300
 to get dopamine to a level in which it can, for instance,

40:55.300 --> 40:57.080
 change your level of motivation.

40:57.080 --> 40:59.320
 Whereas if you are in the late part of the day,

40:59.320 --> 41:01.480
 let's say eight or 9 p.m.

41:01.480 --> 41:03.640
 and you have a lot of serotonin

41:03.640 --> 41:05.600
 swimming around in your system

41:05.600 --> 41:08.300
 and you really need to be focused and alert,

41:08.300 --> 41:11.200
 well, you can do that by leveraging

41:11.200 --> 41:12.760
 the dopamine and epinephrine system

41:12.760 --> 41:15.020
 and indeed the acetylcholine system too,

41:15.020 --> 41:17.800
 but you're going to have to resort to tools

41:17.800 --> 41:20.240
 that can do that far more potently

41:20.240 --> 41:23.500
 and that can do that in a much more sustained way

41:23.500 --> 41:26.060
 if you're going to access the state that you want.

41:26.060 --> 41:29.340
 So again, it's really important to understand

41:29.340 --> 41:32.800
 what the backdrop of these neuromodulators is,

41:32.800 --> 41:36.440
 the so-called baseline, and that they vary across the day

41:36.440 --> 41:38.720
 if you're going to be able to leverage tools

41:38.720 --> 41:40.600
 to optimize your brain chemistry.

41:40.600 --> 41:42.900
 Anyone that tells you do this protocol

41:42.900 --> 41:45.840
 in order to increase your dopamine, do this protocol

41:45.840 --> 41:48.560
 or take this supplement to increase your serotonin,

41:48.560 --> 41:50.920
 they can be telling you the absolute truth,

41:50.920 --> 41:53.160
 but if you don't consider the backdrop

41:53.160 --> 41:55.480
 over which that supplement or behavior

41:55.480 --> 41:57.240
 is going to have its effect,

41:57.240 --> 41:59.800
 well, then you can't really predict the effect it will have,

41:59.800 --> 42:03.560
 but if you can understand these backdrop baseline elements

42:03.560 --> 42:05.240
 to how neuromodulators work,

42:05.240 --> 42:06.920
 well, then you're in a terrific position

42:06.920 --> 42:10.120
 to leverage the best tools in the immediate and short-term

42:10.120 --> 42:12.960
 and that is on the order of seconds, minutes, and hours.

42:12.960 --> 42:16.040
 Before we dive into the more pointed, directed effects

42:16.040 --> 42:19.080
 of specific tools on neuromodulators,

42:19.080 --> 42:21.180
 I'd like to just briefly mention hormones

42:21.180 --> 42:23.780
 because they are also important for understanding

42:23.780 --> 42:26.440
 the background and the context

42:26.440 --> 42:29.560
 and these baseline levels of neuromodulators.

42:29.560 --> 42:32.460
 Now, here I'm going to paint with a bit of a broad brush,

42:32.460 --> 42:34.040
 but what I will say is accurate

42:34.040 --> 42:36.080
 even though it might not be exhaustive.

42:36.080 --> 42:38.920
 What I mean by that is everything I'm about to say is true,

42:38.920 --> 42:41.280
 but it doesn't cover every example in detail

42:41.280 --> 42:43.760
 and nuanced possibility out there.

42:43.760 --> 42:48.000
 Hormones have many different effects on the brain and body

42:48.000 --> 42:49.520
 and not unlike neuromodulators,

42:49.520 --> 42:51.600
 some of those effects are very fast,

42:51.600 --> 42:53.080
 some of them are very slow.

42:53.080 --> 42:55.960
 In fact, certain hormones, for instance,

42:55.960 --> 43:00.960
 the steroid hormones like estrogen and like testosterone

43:01.320 --> 43:04.720
 and corticosterones, and here, of course,

43:04.720 --> 43:07.120
 I'm referring to the steroid hormones for what they are.

43:07.120 --> 43:08.880
 They are indeed steroid hormones,

43:08.880 --> 43:11.060
 but I'm not talking about steroids

43:11.060 --> 43:13.080
 that people inject for sports performance

43:13.080 --> 43:14.280
 or for physical augmentation.

43:14.280 --> 43:16.020
 I'm talking about the steroid hormones

43:16.020 --> 43:17.040
 that you make naturally

43:17.040 --> 43:19.400
 because indeed you make these naturally.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.400
 Well, the steroid hormones

43:21.400 --> 43:23.520
 can actually control gene expression.

43:23.520 --> 43:25.360
 They can change the identity of cells

43:25.360 --> 43:28.240
 and the genes and proteins that cells express.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.520
 This is why during puberty, for instance,

43:30.520 --> 43:33.120
 testosterone and estrogen are released into the body,

43:33.120 --> 43:34.900
 growth hormone is released into the body,

43:34.900 --> 43:38.600
 and bodies and voices and personalities and brains

43:38.600 --> 43:41.160
 change tremendously because literally

43:41.160 --> 43:44.780
 there is a transformation of the breast tissue,

43:44.780 --> 43:47.760
 of the testicular tissue, of the ovarian tissue,

43:47.760 --> 43:49.880
 of the bones, of the muscles,

43:49.880 --> 43:54.500
 of the tissues and cells that control hair growth.

43:54.500 --> 43:57.720
 Gene expression changes in all those cell types

43:57.720 --> 44:02.120
 and the child becomes an adolescent, becomes a young adult.

44:02.120 --> 44:03.740
 That's what puberty really is.

44:03.740 --> 44:07.600
 In fact, puberty is perhaps the most dramatic transformation

44:07.600 --> 44:10.400
 that we go through in our entire lifespan

44:10.400 --> 44:11.920
 in terms of our aging,

44:11.920 --> 44:15.200
 because indeed it reflects a very rapid,

44:15.200 --> 44:16.960
 I should mention, period of aging,

44:16.960 --> 44:19.780
 and transformation of the identity of cells.

44:19.780 --> 44:21.440
 So steroid hormones and other hormones

44:21.440 --> 44:26.100
 can have very slow, long-lasting actions in that way.

44:26.100 --> 44:28.240
 They can also have very fast actions.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.880
 So for instance, adrenaline, epinephrine,

44:30.880 --> 44:32.480
 released from the adrenal glands

44:32.480 --> 44:34.680
 can immediately make your heart beat faster,

44:34.680 --> 44:37.620
 can immediately change the circumference

44:37.620 --> 44:41.000
 of your blood vessels and arteries and capillaries

44:41.000 --> 44:42.560
 and change the way blood flows.

44:42.560 --> 44:45.000
 It can change the way you see the world, literally.

44:45.000 --> 44:46.620
 It does change the way you see the world

44:46.620 --> 44:47.840
 through your visual system.

44:47.840 --> 44:49.400
 And that all happens on the order

44:49.400 --> 44:52.120
 of hundreds of milliseconds or seconds.

44:52.120 --> 44:54.440
 These are extremely fast actions.

44:54.440 --> 44:58.440
 Corticosteroid also can have fast actions and slow actions.

44:58.440 --> 45:02.960
 But since this isn't a discussion about hormones per se,

45:02.960 --> 45:05.380
 and we've done entire episodes like the optimized

45:05.380 --> 45:06.960
 testosterone and estrogen episode,

45:06.960 --> 45:08.680
 you can find that at hubermanlab.com

45:08.680 --> 45:12.040
 or the interview with the incredibly knowledgeable

45:12.040 --> 45:17.040
 and clear and really wonderful tutor

45:17.380 --> 45:19.400
 of actionable information, Dr. Kyle Gillette,

45:19.400 --> 45:20.440
 who is also on this podcast.

45:20.440 --> 45:22.280
 You can learn a lot about hormones there.

45:22.280 --> 45:23.640
 Today, we want to think about hormones

45:23.640 --> 45:25.480
 as they relate to these neuromodulators,

45:25.480 --> 45:29.160
 the dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine, and acetylcholine.

45:29.160 --> 45:33.600
 And in general, testosterone tends to collaborate

45:33.600 --> 45:37.200
 with and increase the action of dopamine.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.560
 That's not always the case, but in general,

45:39.560 --> 45:42.680
 when testosterone goes up, dopamine goes up.

45:42.680 --> 45:44.460
 And sometimes even vice versa,

45:44.460 --> 45:46.520
 when dopamine goes up, testosterone go up.

45:46.520 --> 45:50.760
 And this is true for both males and for females.

45:50.760 --> 45:55.440
 In general, when corticosterones like cortisol

45:55.440 --> 45:58.440
 and some related steroid hormones increase,

45:58.440 --> 46:00.400
 epinephrine levels go up.

46:00.400 --> 46:03.480
 And in general, when hormones like oxytocin

46:03.480 --> 46:08.480
 or prolactin are increased, levels of serotonin go up.

46:08.720 --> 46:12.040
 We can't draw a direct link between any one hormone system

46:12.040 --> 46:13.040
 and acetylcholine.

46:13.040 --> 46:14.960
 Acetylcholine kind of sits off in a category

46:14.960 --> 46:16.460
 of its own in that way.

46:16.460 --> 46:18.900
 But again, in general, testosterone and dopamine

46:18.900 --> 46:21.600
 tend to collaborate in the same direction.

46:21.600 --> 46:24.640
 Cortisol and epinephrine tend to collaborate

46:24.640 --> 46:25.740
 in the same direction.

46:25.740 --> 46:30.260
 Oxytocin and prolactin, which are hormones,

46:30.260 --> 46:33.700
 and serotonin tend to collaborate in the same direction.

46:33.700 --> 46:37.020
 And then we have poor old lonely acetylcholine

46:37.020 --> 46:38.700
 off on its own, but it's not poor and lonely.

46:38.700 --> 46:40.740
 It actually has incredibly potent effects on its own.

46:40.740 --> 46:42.940
 So it's really that it just doesn't need much help

46:42.940 --> 46:45.020
 from the hormone systems,

46:45.020 --> 46:46.700
 or at least not the steroid hormone systems

46:46.700 --> 46:49.180
 in order to have its tremendous effects.

46:49.180 --> 46:51.380
 Now, a lot of what people think about and will do

46:51.380 --> 46:54.380
 when trying to improve mental health and physical health

46:54.380 --> 46:57.220
 is they will try and increase or decrease

46:57.220 --> 46:59.860
 certain categories of hormones of the sort that I mentioned,

46:59.860 --> 47:02.900
 testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, and so on.

47:03.740 --> 47:08.460
 But oftentimes the effects of those manipulations

47:08.460 --> 47:11.060
 in hormones that are going to be most salient

47:11.060 --> 47:13.020
 are not going to be due to the direct effects

47:13.020 --> 47:14.060
 of those hormones.

47:14.060 --> 47:15.420
 Sometimes it could be,

47:15.420 --> 47:18.140
 but oftentimes it's going to be due to their effects

47:18.140 --> 47:19.860
 on the brain and nervous system

47:19.860 --> 47:24.060
 by way of how those hormones impact neuromodulators.

47:24.060 --> 47:26.660
 So for instance, there are various things

47:26.660 --> 47:28.260
 that people can do, both men and women,

47:28.260 --> 47:30.700
 to increase their testosterone and estrogen

47:30.700 --> 47:32.500
 in the appropriate ratios.

47:32.500 --> 47:36.460
 I talked about one such approach in a previous episode,

47:36.460 --> 47:41.060
 and that is to get sunlight onto a large portion

47:41.060 --> 47:43.700
 of one's skin each day.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.820
 Believe it or not, this actually works,

47:45.820 --> 47:48.100
 and it works because your skin

47:48.100 --> 47:51.900
 is actually an endocrine organ, a hormone secreting organ.

47:51.900 --> 47:52.740
 It's a beautiful study.

47:52.740 --> 47:54.320
 I've covered it on this podcast before.

47:54.320 --> 47:56.060
 We will provide a link to this study again,

47:56.060 --> 48:01.060
 but it had people spend at least 20 minutes or so,

48:01.060 --> 48:02.560
 closer to 30 minutes each day,

48:02.560 --> 48:04.500
 trying to maximize sunlight exposure

48:04.500 --> 48:06.140
 to as much of their skin as they could

48:06.140 --> 48:09.420
 in terms of still maintaining decent exposure,

48:09.420 --> 48:11.940
 meaning not overexposing themselves in a cultural way,

48:11.940 --> 48:14.060
 meaning wearing enough clothes that they were decent,

48:14.060 --> 48:16.540
 but still getting a lot of sun exposure

48:16.540 --> 48:18.360
 a couple of times per week or more.

48:19.260 --> 48:21.220
 What they found was that people's testosterone

48:21.220 --> 48:24.140
 and estrogen levels went up, feelings of wellbeing went up,

48:24.140 --> 48:25.940
 feelings of well, or I should say,

48:25.940 --> 48:29.420
 increases in libido were observed as well.

48:29.420 --> 48:32.300
 They subjectively reported more passion, et cetera.

48:32.300 --> 48:35.380
 Testosterone and estrogen did indeed both go up.

48:35.380 --> 48:38.420
 And again, I want to highlight that increases in estrogen,

48:38.420 --> 48:41.940
 not just testosterone, are related to increases in libido

48:41.940 --> 48:43.200
 in both men and women.

48:43.200 --> 48:45.040
 This is why you never want to crush your estrogen

48:45.040 --> 48:47.380
 down to zero, whether or not you're male or female,

48:47.380 --> 48:50.900
 if you want to maintain some sort of healthy libido.

48:50.900 --> 48:53.980
 And general feelings of wellbeing unrelated to libido.

48:53.980 --> 48:57.340
 Well, many of those effects we know

48:57.340 --> 49:00.620
 are not due to direct effects of testosterone and estrogen,

49:00.620 --> 49:03.060
 but rather are due to the effects of testosterone

49:03.060 --> 49:07.140
 and estrogen on the neuromodulators, dopamine and serotonin,

49:07.140 --> 49:10.500
 because much of libido and feelings of wellbeing

49:10.500 --> 49:12.740
 and feelings of relaxation,

49:12.740 --> 49:15.420
 but also desire, motivation, et cetera,

49:15.420 --> 49:19.520
 originate because of the activation of neural circuits

49:19.520 --> 49:22.180
 that dopamine controls and promotes,

49:22.180 --> 49:25.540
 and that serotonin promote and control.

49:25.540 --> 49:28.540
 So this is very important to understand

49:28.540 --> 49:32.440
 as we move toward more specific discussion of the chemicals

49:32.440 --> 49:34.380
 that we call neuromodulators,

49:34.380 --> 49:38.260
 because hormones are controlling those neuromodulators

49:38.260 --> 49:41.020
 in a very slow modulatory way.

49:41.020 --> 49:45.560
 So yes, I said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.020
 I sort of said it twice on purpose.

49:48.020 --> 49:52.220
 And this is a dramatic and potent effect.

49:52.220 --> 49:53.840
 So I'll just give you one more example.

49:53.840 --> 49:57.060
 The hormone prolactin tends to be antagonistic.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.300
 It tends to reduce amounts of dopamine,

49:59.300 --> 50:02.140
 or at least when prolactin levels are high,

50:02.140 --> 50:04.520
 dopamine levels tend to be lower.

50:04.520 --> 50:07.140
 You observe this after the birth of a new child,

50:07.140 --> 50:10.700
 you observe this postcoitally after mating in all species,

50:10.700 --> 50:12.580
 humans and animals.

50:13.540 --> 50:17.780
 When prolactin is elevated, serotonin tends to be elevated.

50:17.780 --> 50:21.300
 And when prolactin is elevated, levels of dopamine

50:21.300 --> 50:26.060
 and the effects of dopamine tend to subside.

50:26.060 --> 50:27.940
 Now, as I move toward explaining

50:27.940 --> 50:31.100
 what each of the four categories of neuromodulators do,

50:31.100 --> 50:32.660
 this will start to make more and more sense

50:32.660 --> 50:34.320
 as to why this would be.

50:34.320 --> 50:37.260
 I always say I wasn't consulted at the design phase,

50:37.260 --> 50:39.500
 meaning I didn't design these circuits.

50:39.500 --> 50:40.880
 And if anyone tells you that they did,

50:40.880 --> 50:42.300
 you should back away quickly

50:42.300 --> 50:44.180
 because none of us designed these circuits.

50:44.180 --> 50:46.500
 This is the way that evolution and nature

50:46.500 --> 50:48.800
 created these systems.

50:48.800 --> 50:51.140
 And they tend to work in a bit of a seesaw fashion,

50:51.140 --> 50:53.980
 prolactin up, dopamine down, right?

50:53.980 --> 50:55.640
 Dopamine up, prolactin down.

50:55.640 --> 50:58.180
 In general, that is the way they work.

50:58.180 --> 51:01.260
 So if we are to take a look at how each of these

51:01.260 --> 51:05.060
 neuromodulator systems functions on its own,

51:05.060 --> 51:07.480
 while understanding that they never truly function

51:07.480 --> 51:10.340
 on their own, we can start to really make sense

51:10.340 --> 51:12.620
 of the landscape of tools that are available to us

51:12.620 --> 51:15.720
 and which tools are going to be most powerful to select

51:15.720 --> 51:18.320
 if our goal is, for instance, to be focused,

51:18.320 --> 51:20.980
 or if our goal is to be less stressed,

51:20.980 --> 51:24.740
 or if our goal is to be highly motivated

51:24.740 --> 51:26.660
 and highly focused for sake of learning.

51:26.660 --> 51:28.680
 All of that is indeed possible

51:28.680 --> 51:31.660
 if you understand these four neuromodulators

51:31.660 --> 51:34.320
 and you understand that while there are many tools

51:34.320 --> 51:36.220
 ranging from pharmacologic to behavioral

51:36.220 --> 51:38.180
 that can tap into these neuromodulator systems

51:38.180 --> 51:40.620
 that can kind of press on the gas of dopamine,

51:40.620 --> 51:43.020
 pull back on serotonin and so on,

51:43.020 --> 51:46.700
 but that there are particular tools,

51:46.700 --> 51:48.660
 both behavioral and supplementation-based,

51:48.660 --> 51:51.440
 and to some extent, prescription drug-based too,

51:51.440 --> 51:53.480
 and we'll touch on a few of those.

51:53.480 --> 51:56.020
 If you understand that and why they work,

51:56.020 --> 51:59.860
 well then you can create a sort of kit,

51:59.860 --> 52:02.980
 a grab bag of things that you can use in any context,

52:02.980 --> 52:05.540
 or I should say that you can look to,

52:05.540 --> 52:07.660
 depending on the context you're in,

52:07.660 --> 52:10.340
 and create the states of body and mind that you want.

52:10.340 --> 52:13.360
 Now, once again, painting with a somewhat broad brush,

52:13.360 --> 52:15.760
 but nonetheless, an accurate brush,

52:15.760 --> 52:20.760
 we can say that dopamine, when elevated above baseline,

52:21.900 --> 52:25.060
 tends to increase states of motivation,

52:25.060 --> 52:28.100
 both mental and physical motivation,

52:28.100 --> 52:30.800
 drive, and to some extent, focus.

52:31.940 --> 52:34.160
 I've said it many times before, and I'll say it again,

52:34.160 --> 52:36.840
 there's a lot of misconception about dopamine.

52:36.840 --> 52:39.000
 Many people out there think that dopamine

52:39.000 --> 52:41.520
 is all about pleasure, you hear about dopamine hits,

52:41.520 --> 52:43.420
 or people chasing dopamine,

52:43.420 --> 52:46.540
 or the need to have a dopamine fast, et cetera.

52:46.540 --> 52:47.860
 Dopamine is not about pleasure,

52:47.860 --> 52:52.220
 dopamine is about motivation, craving, and pursuit,

52:52.220 --> 52:55.700
 for goals or for things that are outside

52:55.700 --> 52:58.340
 our immediate possession and experience.

52:58.340 --> 53:00.900
 The motivation and pursuit of a mate,

53:00.900 --> 53:03.300
 the motivation and pursuit to mate,

53:03.300 --> 53:05.180
 the motivation and pursuit of food,

53:05.180 --> 53:07.540
 the motivation and pursuit of a career goal,

53:07.540 --> 53:08.900
 et cetera, et cetera.

53:08.900 --> 53:12.780
 Things we do not yet have, but that we want,

53:12.780 --> 53:15.980
 and we get into sort of a forward center of mass

53:15.980 --> 53:18.060
 and a pursuit of, and that pursuit can be physical,

53:18.060 --> 53:19.560
 that pursuit can be cognitive,

53:19.560 --> 53:22.460
 it can be both cognitive and physical,

53:22.460 --> 53:25.220
 and it can involve talking about something, right?

53:25.220 --> 53:26.300
 Because in some professions,

53:26.300 --> 53:27.800
 pursuit of things involves talking.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.740
 I think about lawyers, they talk a lot

53:29.740 --> 53:33.260
 in pursuit of winning cases and money, et cetera,

53:33.260 --> 53:35.260
 putting people in jail or keeping people out of jail,

53:35.260 --> 53:36.780
 et cetera, that's done with their mouths,

53:36.780 --> 53:38.160
 not with their bodies.

53:38.160 --> 53:40.940
 Athletes in a state of motivated training

53:40.940 --> 53:43.500
 or in motivated competition use their bodies,

53:43.500 --> 53:45.420
 which all this is obvious, of course,

53:45.420 --> 53:49.620
 but perhaps what is not so obvious is that one molecule,

53:49.620 --> 53:53.460
 not working alone, but predominantly one molecule, dopamine,

53:53.460 --> 53:55.940
 is responsible for all of those motivated states,

53:55.940 --> 53:59.740
 which again underscores the power of these neuromodulators.

53:59.740 --> 54:01.660
 So dopamine, we can think of,

54:01.660 --> 54:03.340
 at least in the context of today's discussion,

54:03.340 --> 54:06.980
 as controlling and indeed promoting motivation,

54:06.980 --> 54:10.940
 drive, and pursuit, and to some extent, focus.

54:12.140 --> 54:15.020
 Epinephrine and a closely related molecule

54:15.020 --> 54:17.860
 called norepinephrine, and again,

54:17.860 --> 54:20.820
 I want to emphasize that epinephrine is adrenaline

54:20.820 --> 54:22.940
 and adrenaline is epinephrine.

54:22.940 --> 54:25.100
 Norepinephrine is noradrenaline

54:25.100 --> 54:27.060
 and noradrenaline is norepinephrine,

54:27.060 --> 54:28.580
 but today we're going to just simply talk

54:28.580 --> 54:30.660
 about epinephrine and norepinephrine.

54:31.840 --> 54:36.000
 That category of neuromodulator is mainly responsible

54:36.000 --> 54:38.620
 for generating our energy,

54:38.620 --> 54:42.580
 our level of fuel and baseline level

54:42.580 --> 54:46.320
 of forward center of mass, as I like to call it.

54:46.320 --> 54:49.400
 You can also think of it as how high your RPM are.

54:49.400 --> 54:53.180
 Now we're not a car and the car analogy sort of falls apart

54:53.180 --> 54:55.460
 as we go further into the biology,

54:55.460 --> 54:57.380
 but it's a decent one for now.

54:57.380 --> 55:00.340
 When epinephrine levels are high, we tend to feel agitated,

55:00.340 --> 55:01.820
 we tend to feel like we want to move,

55:01.820 --> 55:04.560
 we tend to feel like we can't shut down our thinking

55:04.560 --> 55:07.060
 and our anticipation of what's going to happen next.

55:07.060 --> 55:09.620
 And when epinephrine levels are very, very low,

55:09.620 --> 55:11.620
 we actually have less physical energy,

55:11.620 --> 55:13.940
 we tend to have less mental energy

55:13.940 --> 55:16.800
 in terms of generating thoughts very quickly

55:16.800 --> 55:17.840
 and so on and so forth.

55:17.840 --> 55:19.420
 And as I mentioned before,

55:19.420 --> 55:22.100
 dopamine and epinephrine are closely related,

55:22.100 --> 55:25.180
 so much so that we know for a fact

55:25.180 --> 55:27.700
 that epinephrine is actually manufactured

55:27.700 --> 55:29.320
 from the molecule dopamine.

55:29.320 --> 55:31.200
 So that's why I'm talking about these two neuromodulators

55:31.200 --> 55:32.820
 in very close juxtaposition

55:32.820 --> 55:35.780
 because they do indeed collaborate with one another.

55:35.780 --> 55:38.000
 But for sake of today's discussion,

55:38.000 --> 55:41.180
 we can just think of epinephrine as increasing energy.

55:41.180 --> 55:44.340
 Adrenaline increases energy and our state of readiness.

55:44.340 --> 55:48.060
 It also, I should mention, activates our immune system.

55:48.060 --> 55:49.820
 Contrary to popular belief

55:49.820 --> 55:51.980
 that stress inhibits our immune system,

55:51.980 --> 55:53.480
 epinephrine is deployed,

55:53.480 --> 55:56.220
 it's released at great levels in our brain and body

55:56.220 --> 55:57.140
 when we are stressed,

55:57.140 --> 55:58.940
 and that actually protects us

55:58.940 --> 56:02.060
 against infections of multiple kinds,

56:02.060 --> 56:03.420
 at least in the short term.

56:04.460 --> 56:08.220
 That and all the details of that and tools related to that

56:08.220 --> 56:10.540
 were covered in our episode on the immune system,

56:10.540 --> 56:12.220
 if you want to check that out.

56:12.220 --> 56:14.980
 Now, the neuromodulator serotonin

56:14.980 --> 56:17.820
 creates a number of different states in the brain and body,

56:17.820 --> 56:19.940
 but for sake of today's discussion,

56:19.940 --> 56:22.440
 we're going to think about the predominant states

56:22.440 --> 56:23.280
 that it creates,

56:23.280 --> 56:26.380
 and those are states of contentness,

56:26.380 --> 56:30.420
 being happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed,

56:30.420 --> 56:33.820
 and to some extent, even some relief from pain

56:33.820 --> 56:35.240
 or lack of pain.

56:36.220 --> 56:39.200
 Serotonin is associated with a feeling of satiety,

56:39.200 --> 56:42.640
 of having enough of what we already have.

56:42.640 --> 56:46.720
 Now, when serotonin is very, very high,

56:46.720 --> 56:48.760
 people can even be sedate.

56:48.760 --> 56:51.620
 They can be completely amotivated,

56:51.620 --> 56:55.180
 no motivation to seek out things like food or sex or work,

56:55.180 --> 56:56.020
 or et cetera.

56:56.880 --> 56:59.300
 Whereas when serotonin levels are very low,

56:59.300 --> 57:01.460
 people can actually exhibit agitation

57:01.460 --> 57:03.460
 and high levels of stress.

57:03.460 --> 57:05.100
 So the levels matter here,

57:05.100 --> 57:07.880
 but again, for sake of today's conversation,

57:08.740 --> 57:10.220
 when we leverage serotonin,

57:10.220 --> 57:12.780
 where you are really leveraging a neuromodulator

57:12.780 --> 57:15.500
 that tends to increase the activity of neural circuits

57:15.500 --> 57:19.220
 in the brain and body that make us feel relaxed and happy,

57:19.220 --> 57:23.080
 and it tends to decrease the activity of neural circuits

57:23.080 --> 57:25.240
 that make us rabidly in pursuit of things

57:25.240 --> 57:27.180
 that we don't have, right?

57:27.180 --> 57:31.820
 The opposite of content and sated is motivation,

57:31.820 --> 57:35.020
 desire, and hunger and thirst for things that we don't have.

57:35.020 --> 57:39.000
 So serotonin is the molecule of peace.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.900
 It is the molecule of contentness.

57:40.900 --> 57:43.740
 It is the molecule of having enough,

57:43.740 --> 57:45.560
 at least for the time being,

57:45.560 --> 57:48.060
 or the feeling that we have enough for the time being.

57:48.060 --> 57:51.180
 Now, acetylcholine is a fourth category of neuromodulator

57:51.180 --> 57:53.400
 that, as I mentioned earlier, is somewhat, not totally,

57:53.400 --> 57:56.020
 but somewhat distinct from any direct control

57:56.020 --> 57:58.180
 by the major hormone systems of the body,

57:58.180 --> 58:01.220
 or at least the major steroid hormone systems.

58:01.220 --> 58:03.340
 And acetylcholine, we can say,

58:03.340 --> 58:08.340
 is mainly associated with states of focus.

58:08.800 --> 58:10.620
 And we can go a step further and say that

58:10.620 --> 58:13.100
 it's mainly associated with steps of focus

58:13.100 --> 58:16.260
 as they relate to learning and encoding new information,

58:16.260 --> 58:18.580
 so-called neuroplasticity.

58:18.580 --> 58:20.240
 Now, neuroplasticity,

58:20.240 --> 58:22.060
 or the brain and nervous system's ability

58:22.060 --> 58:23.520
 to change in response to experience,

58:23.520 --> 58:26.440
 can be impacted by an enormous number of different chemicals,

58:26.440 --> 58:28.180
 not just acetylcholine.

58:28.180 --> 58:32.500
 But acetylcholine has a particularly potent ability

58:32.500 --> 58:36.560
 to open up the thing that we call neuroplasticity

58:36.560 --> 58:38.860
 to allow plasticity to happen in one moment,

58:38.860 --> 58:41.700
 whereas in a previous moment, it could not occur

58:41.700 --> 58:45.580
 because acetylcholine had not been released in the brain

58:45.580 --> 58:47.800
 or in the spinal cord.

58:47.800 --> 58:51.380
 So acetylcholine is involved in focus and in learning,

58:51.380 --> 58:55.100
 but it is not necessarily always associated

58:55.100 --> 58:58.540
 with learning in the context of highly motivated,

58:58.540 --> 59:00.420
 really ramped up states.

59:00.420 --> 59:04.760
 It can be, but acetylcholine can also be released

59:04.760 --> 59:07.500
 and can encourage the learning and neuroplasticity

59:07.500 --> 59:09.500
 associated with calm states.

59:10.400 --> 59:14.000
 For instance, if somebody has a newborn child,

59:14.000 --> 59:18.460
 we know that they are flooded with oxytocin,

59:18.460 --> 59:20.480
 which has actually even been called the love hormone,

59:20.480 --> 59:22.540
 although it does many things in addition

59:22.540 --> 59:25.340
 to control feelings of romantic attachment

59:25.340 --> 59:27.500
 and attachment to children, et cetera.

59:27.500 --> 59:30.120
 It does all of that, but it does a lot more as well.

59:30.120 --> 59:32.620
 But when people have a new child,

59:32.620 --> 59:34.960
 they also tend to be hyper-focused on that child,

59:34.960 --> 59:38.420
 not just its wellbeing, but they narrow all their thinking,

59:38.420 --> 59:41.580
 all their vision, all their hearing to that child

59:41.580 --> 59:45.440
 and their obvious adaptive reasons for wanting to do that.

59:45.440 --> 59:47.600
 I recall a family dinner we had,

59:47.600 --> 59:49.500
 gosh, this was over 10 years ago,

59:49.500 --> 59:52.980
 we had a couple over, my mom was in the habit

59:52.980 --> 59:54.700
 of inviting people over who didn't have places

59:54.700 --> 59:56.920
 to go on the holidays, because that's just who she is,

59:56.920 --> 59:58.780
 and I think it's quite nice.

59:58.780 --> 1:00:01.180
 So we brought over this couple, they had a newborn,

1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:02.060
 I think this baby had been born

1:00:02.060 --> 1:00:03.380
 maybe two or three weeks before,

1:00:03.380 --> 1:00:07.700
 and it was seated, not seated, it was lying down,

1:00:07.700 --> 1:00:09.100
 it couldn't see, it was like a potato bug,

1:00:09.100 --> 1:00:10.300
 it barely holds head up,

1:00:10.300 --> 1:00:13.260
 but it was lying in a little bassinet on the floor

1:00:13.260 --> 1:00:16.420
 as we ate dinner, and it was almost hilarious,

1:00:16.420 --> 1:00:18.580
 it actually was hilarious, we laughed a lot about this,

1:00:18.580 --> 1:00:20.220
 that the entire meal,

1:00:20.220 --> 1:00:22.500
 they were basically staring at this baby,

1:00:22.500 --> 1:00:24.980
 they were so clearly in love with the baby

1:00:24.980 --> 1:00:28.780
 and so flooded with oxytocin and also prolactin,

1:00:28.780 --> 1:00:31.300
 that they couldn't take their focus off this baby,

1:00:31.300 --> 1:00:34.040
 it was actually really wonderful and endearing to see,

1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:37.340
 but in addition to that, I'd be willing to bet,

1:00:37.340 --> 1:00:39.600
 had I been able to do a little bit of micro dialysis,

1:00:39.600 --> 1:00:42.640
 which is the ability to measure the amounts

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.760
 of neuromodulator at a given location in the brain,

1:00:45.760 --> 1:00:49.020
 had I been able to do that experiment on them,

1:00:49.020 --> 1:00:50.340
 in that moment, I would have found

1:00:50.340 --> 1:00:52.880
 that levels of acetylcholine were exceedingly high

1:00:52.880 --> 1:00:56.140
 because they were so hyper-focused on this child,

1:00:56.140 --> 1:00:59.260
 not just in love with, but focused on that child,

1:00:59.260 --> 1:01:02.180
 and without a doubt, the neural circuits

1:01:02.180 --> 1:01:05.220
 related to focus and plasticity were heavily engaged,

1:01:05.220 --> 1:01:07.340
 again, for obvious adaptive reasons

1:01:07.340 --> 1:01:11.420
 related to child rearing and learning the coos and cries

1:01:11.420 --> 1:01:14.540
 and pain signals and pleasure signals of one's offspring.

1:01:14.540 --> 1:01:17.220
 So we have dopamine associated with motivation,

1:01:17.220 --> 1:01:20.300
 drive, and pursuit, and to some extent, focus.

1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:22.480
 We have epinephrine and norepinephrine associated

1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:26.140
 with energy of having a forward center of mass,

1:01:26.140 --> 1:01:27.940
 mentally and or physically.

1:01:27.940 --> 1:01:29.820
 We have serotonin, which is associated

1:01:29.820 --> 1:01:34.500
 with a peaceful, content, sated state of being.

1:01:34.500 --> 1:01:35.940
 And we have acetylcholine,

1:01:35.940 --> 1:01:39.980
 which is associated with focus and in particular focus

1:01:39.980 --> 1:01:43.460
 as it relates to learning and encoding new information.

1:01:43.460 --> 1:01:45.160
 So let's say you want to be more motivated.

1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:47.780
 You want to be more in pursuit of goals,

1:01:47.780 --> 1:01:50.780
 and you want to have more energy and to be more focused.

1:01:50.780 --> 1:01:52.380
 There are many ways to go about that.

1:01:52.380 --> 1:01:56.060
 In fact, there's a near infinite cloud of opportunities,

1:01:56.060 --> 1:01:59.060
 everything from prescription drugs to illicit drugs,

1:01:59.060 --> 1:02:03.940
 which I certainly do not recommend, supplements, nutrition.

1:02:03.940 --> 1:02:05.760
 You can listen to particular music.

1:02:05.760 --> 1:02:08.620
 You can do all sorts of cognitive, behavioral,

1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:10.700
 nutritional supplementation tricks,

1:02:10.700 --> 1:02:15.320
 or you can just understand that what you're really after

1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:19.740
 are increases in dopamine above baseline that you control.

1:02:19.740 --> 1:02:22.800
 And there are ways to control them that are quite potent.

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:26.180
 And science tells us which tools are going to be

1:02:26.180 --> 1:02:29.780
 the most potent and the most versatile for you.

1:02:29.780 --> 1:02:31.740
 So I'm going to share those tools with you now

1:02:31.740 --> 1:02:35.220
 with the caveat that each one of those tools

1:02:35.220 --> 1:02:37.700
 could be its own entire podcast episode

1:02:37.700 --> 1:02:40.580
 and that we've done it near entire episodes

1:02:40.580 --> 1:02:43.240
 on each of these tools or small collections of these tools.

1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:45.940
 So I'm going to cover these in somewhat superficial manner.

1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:48.140
 We can provide links to previous episodes

1:02:48.140 --> 1:02:50.420
 that relate to each of these tools in detail,

1:02:50.420 --> 1:02:52.760
 but I'll give you enough detail about them

1:02:52.760 --> 1:02:54.980
 that would allow you to incorporate them into your routine

1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:56.140
 should you choose.

1:02:56.140 --> 1:02:57.600
 Let's say you want to increase dopamine

1:02:57.600 --> 1:02:59.460
 for sake of increasing motivation.

1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:03.200
 The first thing to do is to understand

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:06.180
 what the natural behavioral tools are for increasing dopamine

1:03:06.180 --> 1:03:09.140
 and to do those as consistently as possible.

1:03:09.140 --> 1:03:11.140
 Again, these are tools that you'll want to do

1:03:11.140 --> 1:03:14.480
 nearly every day, if not every day.

1:03:14.480 --> 1:03:17.400
 And I know I'm sounding like a broken record on this one,

1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:20.980
 but here again, we come to sunlight

1:03:20.980 --> 1:03:25.060
 and I should say not just the desire to,

1:03:25.060 --> 1:03:28.540
 but really the need for viewing the maximum amount

1:03:28.540 --> 1:03:30.580
 of sunlight that one can reasonably get

1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:32.700
 given schedules and locations in the world,

1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:35.500
 time of year, et cetera, in the early part of the day.

1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:39.060
 Within the first hour of waking,

1:03:39.060 --> 1:03:42.020
 ideally, but certainly in the first three hours of your day,

1:03:42.020 --> 1:03:44.580
 you are going to want to maximize sunlight exposure

1:03:44.580 --> 1:03:45.420
 to your eyes.

1:03:45.420 --> 1:03:48.440
 Never look at the sun or any other light so bright

1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:49.500
 that it's painful to look at.

1:03:49.500 --> 1:03:50.900
 And yes, of course, blinking is fine,

1:03:50.900 --> 1:03:52.340
 but no, take sunglasses off,

1:03:52.340 --> 1:03:53.940
 go outside once the sun is out

1:03:53.940 --> 1:03:55.540
 and get some natural light in your eyes.

1:03:55.540 --> 1:03:57.780
 And if it's appropriate,

1:03:57.780 --> 1:04:00.080
 or I should say in a way that's appropriate,

1:04:00.080 --> 1:04:02.540
 maximize the amount of sunlight exposure to your skin,

1:04:02.540 --> 1:04:04.740
 but please don't get burned.

1:04:04.740 --> 1:04:07.800
 Please do wear sunscreen if you're prone to getting burned.

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:10.360
 Typically, early day sunlight is not going to burn you,

1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:11.740
 at least not most people,

1:04:11.740 --> 1:04:14.040
 unless you're extremely fair skinned.

1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:14.880
 So don't get burned,

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:17.320
 do what you need to in order to protect yourself from burn.

1:04:17.320 --> 1:04:20.120
 There's some emerging controversy about sunscreen

1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:21.780
 and which ones are safe and which ones aren't safe.

1:04:21.780 --> 1:04:23.460
 We have not done an episode on that yet,

1:04:23.460 --> 1:04:26.320
 but I find it to be an important and interesting topic.

1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:28.740
 Daria Rose, Dr. Daria Rose, I should say,

1:04:28.740 --> 1:04:31.220
 has a podcast called the Daria Rose Podcast

1:04:31.220 --> 1:04:34.120
 and did an episode all about sunscreens which are safe,

1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:36.780
 which are not safe by interviewing an expert on that.

1:04:36.780 --> 1:04:39.260
 So I refer you to that podcast as it relates to sunscreen,

1:04:39.260 --> 1:04:42.100
 but get some natural light exposure in your eyes.

1:04:42.100 --> 1:04:44.500
 And if you wake up before the sun comes out,

1:04:44.500 --> 1:04:46.100
 turn on as many bright lights inside

1:04:46.100 --> 1:04:48.540
 as you can turn on reasonably,

1:04:48.540 --> 1:04:49.900
 given your electric bill, et cetera.

1:04:49.900 --> 1:04:52.620
 Get a lot of bright sunlight exposure early in the day

1:04:52.620 --> 1:04:55.380
 and get a lot of sunlight exposure to your skin

1:04:55.380 --> 1:04:56.820
 in the early part of the day

1:04:56.820 --> 1:04:59.300
 in a way that doesn't burn you,

1:04:59.300 --> 1:05:00.880
 meaning burn your skin or blind you.

1:05:00.880 --> 1:05:03.620
 Please, please don't do anything that harms your vision,

1:05:03.620 --> 1:05:05.820
 like stare into bright light that's painful.

1:05:05.820 --> 1:05:07.820
 What does that do?

1:05:07.820 --> 1:05:09.600
 Well, it sets in motion

1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:11.440
 a number of different biological cascades.

1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:12.920
 Some are very fast.

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:15.060
 There are fast actions of sunlight that will trigger,

1:05:15.060 --> 1:05:16.780
 for instance, dopamine release

1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:18.060
 from different parts of your brain

1:05:18.060 --> 1:05:19.660
 and your endocrine system.

1:05:19.660 --> 1:05:23.700
 And we now know that it increases levels of genes

1:05:23.700 --> 1:05:25.180
 related to thyroid hormone

1:05:25.180 --> 1:05:28.700
 and actually increases certain dopamine receptors.

1:05:28.700 --> 1:05:29.760
 So there's a wonderful paper.

1:05:29.760 --> 1:05:31.700
 We will provide a link to this paper

1:05:31.700 --> 1:05:33.340
 that shows that sunlight exposure

1:05:33.340 --> 1:05:36.980
 can actually increase the amount of so-called DRD4.

1:05:36.980 --> 1:05:38.860
 This is a particular type of dopamine receptor,

1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:41.020
 the dopamine receptor 4.

1:05:41.020 --> 1:05:42.660
 The genes for dopamine receptor 4

1:05:42.660 --> 1:05:44.480
 are actually under photic control.

1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:46.300
 So if you get sunlight exposure to your eyes,

1:05:46.300 --> 1:05:47.580
 and it does have to be to your eyes

1:05:47.580 --> 1:05:48.760
 in the early part of the day,

1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:51.420
 you increase the amount of dopamine receptor that you have,

1:05:51.420 --> 1:05:53.520
 which allows whatever circulating dopamine

1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:57.300
 happens to be there to have a greater effect on motivation

1:05:57.300 --> 1:05:59.500
 and I should say also on mood and feelings

1:05:59.500 --> 1:06:01.160
 of being in pursuit

1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:05.220
 and generally in craving and pursuit of things in life.

1:06:05.220 --> 1:06:07.520
 Now there's another way to increase the effect

1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:09.700
 of whatever dopamine happens to be circulating

1:06:09.700 --> 1:06:11.360
 in your brain and body.

1:06:11.360 --> 1:06:14.540
 And this again relates to increasing the number

1:06:14.540 --> 1:06:18.380
 or the efficacy of the receptors for dopamine.

1:06:18.380 --> 1:06:21.020
 Now here we're not talking about the dopamine receptor 4,

1:06:21.020 --> 1:06:23.240
 but a different category of dopamine receptors,

1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:25.220
 the D2 and D3 receptors,

1:06:25.220 --> 1:06:28.380
 which are expressed multiple places in your brain and body

1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:29.540
 and bind dopamine,

1:06:29.540 --> 1:06:31.980
 meaning dopamine parks in them like a parking spot

1:06:31.980 --> 1:06:36.460
 and allows dopamine to generally increase the activity

1:06:36.460 --> 1:06:37.880
 of the neurons and cells

1:06:37.880 --> 1:06:39.900
 that express those dopamine receptors.

1:06:39.900 --> 1:06:41.060
 How do you do that?

1:06:41.060 --> 1:06:45.260
 Well, it turns out that regular ingestion of caffeine

1:06:45.260 --> 1:06:50.060
 at safe and appropriate levels about 100 to 250 milligrams

1:06:50.060 --> 1:06:52.100
 is going to increase the number of D2

1:06:52.100 --> 1:06:54.060
 and D3 dopamine receptors.

1:06:54.060 --> 1:06:57.000
 I talked a little bit about this on a previous episode.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.940
 Again, we'll provide links to these studies,

1:06:58.940 --> 1:07:00.640
 but this is an important finding, I believe,

1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:03.260
 because this is not about the acute,

1:07:03.260 --> 1:07:05.420
 the immediate effects of caffeine on alertness,

1:07:05.420 --> 1:07:06.820
 although those occur too.

1:07:06.820 --> 1:07:08.180
 When you drink caffeine,

1:07:08.180 --> 1:07:10.940
 it's going to increase your levels of adrenaline

1:07:10.940 --> 1:07:12.320
 and so-called epinephrine,

1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:13.700
 which will increase your energy levels.

1:07:13.700 --> 1:07:16.460
 It's going to decrease levels of something called adenosine,

1:07:16.460 --> 1:07:17.820
 which builds up while you're sleepy.

1:07:17.820 --> 1:07:19.140
 It's going to make you feel less sleepy,

1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:20.800
 more alert, more energetic.

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:22.180
 That's sort of obvious,

1:07:22.180 --> 1:07:24.740
 but what's less obvious is that it's increasing the number

1:07:24.740 --> 1:07:26.780
 and efficacy of dopamine receptors

1:07:26.780 --> 1:07:28.820
 so that whatever dopamine happens to be around

1:07:28.820 --> 1:07:32.780
 in your system is going to have more of a potent effect.

1:07:32.780 --> 1:07:34.440
 So how much caffeine should you drink?

1:07:34.440 --> 1:07:35.940
 That's going to vary from person to person.

1:07:35.940 --> 1:07:39.160
 Some people are very sensitive to caffeine, others are not.

1:07:39.160 --> 1:07:42.060
 I tend to be fairly insensitive to caffeine

1:07:42.060 --> 1:07:44.280
 because I've been drinking it for a long period of time,

1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:47.720
 but after one or two cups of espresso or coffee,

1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:48.900
 I feel like I've had enough.

1:07:48.900 --> 1:07:50.620
 I tend to drink my caffeine early in the day,

1:07:50.620 --> 1:07:52.180
 which is what I'm going to recommend that you do,

1:07:52.180 --> 1:07:55.220
 not drinking caffeine past two and certainly not 4 p.m.

1:07:55.220 --> 1:07:56.380
 if you're on a typical schedule

1:07:56.380 --> 1:07:58.060
 and you want to be able to sleep that night,

1:07:58.060 --> 1:07:59.840
 even if you can fall asleep,

1:07:59.840 --> 1:08:01.740
 having too much caffeine in your system is not good

1:08:01.740 --> 1:08:03.620
 because it disrupts the architecture of sleep.

1:08:03.620 --> 1:08:06.700
 And now knowing about all the metabolic variability

1:08:06.700 --> 1:08:09.380
 across the night, according to different stages of sleep,

1:08:09.380 --> 1:08:11.800
 it should be even more obvious

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:13.540
 as to why disrupting the architecture of sleep

1:08:13.540 --> 1:08:14.620
 will be bad for you.

1:08:14.620 --> 1:08:16.700
 So limit that caffeine intake to early in the day

1:08:16.700 --> 1:08:18.680
 and don't go ballistic if you're not,

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:20.120
 certainly don't go ballistic in any case,

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:21.220
 but for most people,

1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:24.480
 anywhere from 100 to 400 milligrams of caffeine

1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:25.900
 is going to have this effect.

1:08:25.900 --> 1:08:29.200
 And this effect again is a slow accumulating effect

1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:31.100
 by drinking caffeine consistently day to day.

1:08:31.100 --> 1:08:33.660
 I get my caffeine mainly from yerba mate tea.

1:08:33.660 --> 1:08:35.140
 I want to emphasize that it's probably a good idea

1:08:35.140 --> 1:08:36.820
 to stay away from the smoked mate,

1:08:36.820 --> 1:08:38.980
 as there's some evidence those can be carcinogenic,

1:08:38.980 --> 1:08:41.140
 but I brew my own yerba mate tea,

1:08:41.140 --> 1:08:43.060
 or sometimes I'll drink coffee or espresso

1:08:43.060 --> 1:08:44.280
 or sometimes both, frankly,

1:08:44.280 --> 1:08:46.380
 as long as I'm hydrating enough and I'm getting enough salt,

1:08:46.380 --> 1:08:48.820
 then I tend to feel fine with that much caffeine.

1:08:48.820 --> 1:08:50.700
 The other way to increase dopamine

1:08:50.700 --> 1:08:52.780
 and to make sure that your baseline levels of dopamine

1:08:52.780 --> 1:08:54.500
 are high enough is to make sure that you're eating

1:08:54.500 --> 1:08:56.820
 sufficient numbers of tyrosine-rich foods.

1:08:56.820 --> 1:08:59.340
 You can look up which foods include tyrosine.

1:08:59.340 --> 1:09:01.620
 Tyrosine is a precursor to dopamine.

1:09:01.620 --> 1:09:04.760
 It's an amino acid that is a direct pathway

1:09:04.760 --> 1:09:06.380
 to dopamine synthesis.

1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:10.660
 And tyrosine foods include things like certain meats,

1:09:10.660 --> 1:09:13.800
 Parmesan cheese, very high in tyrosine, for instance.

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:15.760
 In fact, there's something called the cheese effect,

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:16.600
 believe it or not.

1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:17.780
 I don't want to go too far off topic,

1:09:17.780 --> 1:09:19.320
 but the cheese effect is kind of interesting

1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:22.980
 because certain people will take antidepressants

1:09:22.980 --> 1:09:25.620
 that are so-called MAO inhibitors,

1:09:25.620 --> 1:09:28.000
 monoamine oxidase inhibitors.

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.020
 Anytime you hear ASE, that's an enzyme,

1:09:30.020 --> 1:09:33.480
 they will take these inhibitors that prevent

1:09:33.480 --> 1:09:37.300
 the breakdown of dopamine and other so-called catecholamines

1:09:37.300 --> 1:09:39.820
 which allow more dopamine to be in circulation.

1:09:39.820 --> 1:09:42.440
 But if these people eat certain cheeses,

1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:45.020
 including Parmesan cheese, and there are other foods,

1:09:45.020 --> 1:09:47.140
 of course, that include not just tyrosine,

1:09:47.140 --> 1:09:51.700
 but one of the derivatives of tyrosine called terramine,

1:09:51.700 --> 1:09:54.620
 that generates what's called the cheese effect,

1:09:54.620 --> 1:09:57.100
 which is people get potent migraines, headaches,

1:09:57.100 --> 1:09:58.300
 blood pressure goes up.

1:09:58.300 --> 1:09:59.140
 Why?

1:09:59.140 --> 1:10:01.200
 Well, because they've got a lot of tyrosine in their system

1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:02.540
 and dopamine in their system,

1:10:02.540 --> 1:10:05.880
 and they've got less of the enzyme that removes

1:10:05.880 --> 1:10:07.780
 that dopamine or limits its action.

1:10:07.780 --> 1:10:09.780
 And so they have an excess of dopamine

1:10:09.780 --> 1:10:12.980
 and dopamine has effects on blood pressure, et cetera.

1:10:12.980 --> 1:10:14.740
 So the cheese effect is something to avoid.

1:10:14.740 --> 1:10:18.300
 If you are somebody who's taking drugs that tap into

1:10:18.300 --> 1:10:20.140
 or manipulate the dopamine pathway,

1:10:20.140 --> 1:10:21.720
 either for Parkinson's or depressions,

1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:24.140
 obviously you're going to want to be careful about adjusting

1:10:24.140 --> 1:10:27.780
 up or down levels of dopamine too potently.

1:10:27.780 --> 1:10:31.260
 So mind the cheese effect if you're taking an MAO inhibitor.

1:10:31.260 --> 1:10:33.020
 There's a lot of information about this online.

1:10:33.020 --> 1:10:35.780
 For most people, eating foods like Parmesan cheese,

1:10:35.780 --> 1:10:39.500
 eating foods like certain meats and certain vegetables

1:10:39.500 --> 1:10:41.420
 also can increase tyrosine levels,

1:10:41.420 --> 1:10:43.780
 which will increase dopamine synthesis.

1:10:43.780 --> 1:10:47.020
 So these are ways of modulating more or less the baseline

1:10:47.020 --> 1:10:48.900
 of dopamine that you are able to produce

1:10:48.900 --> 1:10:51.820
 and the ways that dopamine can have its action

1:10:51.820 --> 1:10:54.720
 by way of binding to receptors more potently.

1:10:55.580 --> 1:10:58.240
 Now, there are other ways to increase dopamine

1:10:58.240 --> 1:11:00.500
 in a more acute or directed way,

1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:04.780
 ways to spike your dopamine to enhance your state

1:11:04.780 --> 1:11:09.020
 of motivation, mood, focus, and so on.

1:11:09.020 --> 1:11:11.700
 And in thinking about the vast landscape of tools

1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:14.400
 that can do that, we have one category of tools,

1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:15.820
 which are the really, really bad things

1:11:15.820 --> 1:11:17.220
 that I don't recommend anybody do.

1:11:17.220 --> 1:11:19.560
 In fact, I recommend nobody do ever,

1:11:19.560 --> 1:11:22.860
 which are things like cocaine, methamphetamine, et cetera.

1:11:22.860 --> 1:11:25.820
 They are incredibly destructive for lives

1:11:25.820 --> 1:11:28.500
 because of the way that they so potently increase dopamine

1:11:28.500 --> 1:11:30.940
 and then the crash in dopamine that occurs later.

1:11:30.940 --> 1:11:33.460
 I mean, they can indeed and often do ruin lives.

1:11:33.460 --> 1:11:35.680
 So we're leaving those off the table.

1:11:35.680 --> 1:11:39.260
 There are of course, prescription drugs that many people in,

1:11:39.260 --> 1:11:43.220
 especially people who have clinically diagnosed ADHD,

1:11:43.220 --> 1:11:45.180
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

1:11:45.180 --> 1:11:48.460
 rely on and in fact benefit from in many cases,

1:11:48.460 --> 1:11:52.040
 things like Ritalin, Adderall, Vyvanse.

1:11:52.040 --> 1:11:53.900
 Nowadays, there's also a lot of interest

1:11:53.900 --> 1:11:56.760
 in use of things like modafinil or modafinil.

1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:59.620
 I covered all of those in the episode on ADHD,

1:11:59.620 --> 1:12:01.380
 and you can find that at hubermanlab.com

1:12:01.380 --> 1:12:04.480
 and the other places this podcast is found.

1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:05.760
 Prescription drugs aside,

1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:08.140
 because they require a prescription and a discussion

1:12:08.140 --> 1:12:10.800
 that's in depth and appropriate with your physician,

1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:12.300
 healthcare provider,

1:12:12.300 --> 1:12:15.400
 there are supplements that can very potently

1:12:15.400 --> 1:12:17.120
 increase dopamine as well.

1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:18.300
 Perhaps not to the extent

1:12:18.300 --> 1:12:20.820
 that some of those other prescription drugs can,

1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:22.920
 but certainly to a degree that will impact

1:12:22.920 --> 1:12:24.940
 and increase dopamine and motivation

1:12:24.940 --> 1:12:26.780
 and the other states dopamine is associated with.

1:12:26.780 --> 1:12:29.680
 And the two main categories of supplements

1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:31.780
 that are very effective in raising dopamine,

1:12:31.780 --> 1:12:33.300
 and here I should provide the caveat

1:12:33.300 --> 1:12:35.180
 that anytime you're going to add or remove anything

1:12:35.180 --> 1:12:38.000
 from your supplementation protocols,

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.500
 please talk to a physician

1:12:39.500 --> 1:12:41.340
 who is knowledgeable on these topics.

1:12:41.340 --> 1:12:44.540
 If you're somebody who has or is taking drugs

1:12:44.540 --> 1:12:46.320
 for depression or mania,

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:49.020
 please be very cautious about manipulating your dopamine

1:12:49.020 --> 1:12:49.980
 in any case.

1:12:49.980 --> 1:12:51.400
 I don't just say that to protect us,

1:12:51.400 --> 1:12:52.780
 I say that to protect you.

1:12:53.740 --> 1:12:56.140
 But if we were to look at the supplement landscape

1:12:56.140 --> 1:12:58.100
 and ask which supplements increase dopamine,

1:12:58.100 --> 1:13:00.220
 there are a vast number of them,

1:13:00.220 --> 1:13:02.700
 but the three main ones,

1:13:02.700 --> 1:13:05.140
 the most effective ones that are readily available out there

1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:07.640
 without a prescription are macuna prurines.

1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:10.260
 This is actually the outside of a velvety bean

1:13:10.260 --> 1:13:12.920
 that has been extracted and put into a supplement.

1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:15.480
 Macuna prurines is actual L-DOPA.

1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:18.940
 It's 99% L-DOPA, which is a prescription drug

1:13:18.940 --> 1:13:22.180
 that is given for Parkinson's and for other purposes

1:13:22.180 --> 1:13:25.680
 where increasing dopamine is important.

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:27.680
 I don't recommend macuna prurines.

1:13:27.680 --> 1:13:29.220
 I'm not saying that no one should take it,

1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:31.340
 but I don't take it and I don't recommend it

1:13:31.340 --> 1:13:33.740
 because it tends to so potently

1:13:33.740 --> 1:13:35.220
 and acutely increase dopamine

1:13:35.220 --> 1:13:38.020
 that there's a pretty substantial crash afterwards.

1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:40.620
 So I avoid it and I don't generally suggest

1:13:40.620 --> 1:13:44.400
 that anyone take it unless there's really a clinical need

1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:46.240
 or they're working very closely with somebody

1:13:46.240 --> 1:13:48.440
 that can really monitor that.

1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:52.020
 The other two supplements that can increase dopamine

1:13:52.020 --> 1:13:56.020
 in a short-term way, but in a significant way,

1:13:56.020 --> 1:13:57.220
 are L-tyrosine.

1:13:57.220 --> 1:13:59.680
 So you can buy that as a supplement amino acid.

1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:00.700
 I sometimes take this.

1:14:00.700 --> 1:14:04.340
 I would say I probably take it about once a week maximum

1:14:04.340 --> 1:14:07.120
 for workouts or workouts.

1:14:07.120 --> 1:14:10.140
 I'll take it in dosages of anywhere from 500 milligrams

1:14:10.140 --> 1:14:11.200
 to 1,000 milligrams.

1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:13.700
 People vary tremendously in their sensitivity

1:14:13.700 --> 1:14:15.180
 to supplementing L-tyrosine.

1:14:15.180 --> 1:14:17.200
 I know people that can take two grams.

1:14:17.200 --> 1:14:20.060
 I know people that can barely take 100 milligrams.

1:14:20.060 --> 1:14:22.820
 I know people that the best dose for them is zero milligrams.

1:14:22.820 --> 1:14:23.980
 So there's a lot of variation there

1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:25.340
 depending on sensitivity

1:14:25.340 --> 1:14:28.580
 and their natural baseline levels of dopamine

1:14:28.580 --> 1:14:30.040
 and whether or not they're doing a lot of other things

1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:31.800
 to support dopamine.

1:14:31.800 --> 1:14:33.800
 But nonetheless, taking L-tyrosine will lead

1:14:33.800 --> 1:14:36.560
 to fairly substantial increases in dopamine

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:38.620
 within about 15 to 45 minutes.

1:14:38.620 --> 1:14:41.900
 And it lasts for about 30 minutes to two hours.

1:14:41.900 --> 1:14:43.680
 And then there's kind of a tapering off.

1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:45.820
 Some people experience a little bit of an emotional

1:14:45.820 --> 1:14:48.500
 or, and, or I should say energetic crash.

1:14:48.500 --> 1:14:49.340
 Some people don't.

1:14:49.340 --> 1:14:52.360
 And then the other supplement that I certainly use

1:14:52.360 --> 1:14:53.740
 and that I know a number of other people use

1:14:53.740 --> 1:14:55.340
 is more fast acting, but more potent,

1:14:55.340 --> 1:14:57.180
 which is phenylethylamine.

1:14:57.180 --> 1:15:02.180
 This relates to the so-called PEA molecule, P, P-E-A.

1:15:02.340 --> 1:15:05.660
 And phenylethylamine increases dopamine

1:15:05.660 --> 1:15:07.660
 and some metabolites related to dopamine

1:15:07.660 --> 1:15:09.380
 in ways that really increase energy

1:15:09.380 --> 1:15:11.040
 and feelings of wellbeing and motivation.

1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:12.700
 And again, it's fast acting.

1:15:12.700 --> 1:15:13.980
 So my particular protocol,

1:15:13.980 --> 1:15:17.180
 the one I use is I'll take phenylethylamine

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:19.780
 at dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams

1:15:19.780 --> 1:15:22.580
 along with some L-tyrosine,

1:15:22.580 --> 1:15:25.660
 or I'll take it on its own with a molecule,

1:15:25.660 --> 1:15:26.660
 or I should say a compound

1:15:26.660 --> 1:15:27.740
 that we'll talk about a little bit later

1:15:27.740 --> 1:15:30.280
 as it relates to acetylcholine alpha GPC.

1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:33.240
 But tyrosine and phenylethylamine taken alone or together

1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:35.860
 will make you feel more motivated and more alert,

1:15:35.860 --> 1:15:38.900
 more willing and able to lean into

1:15:38.900 --> 1:15:40.260
 particular motivated behaviors,

1:15:40.260 --> 1:15:42.380
 whether or not they're physical or cognitive.

1:15:42.380 --> 1:15:44.780
 If you'd like to learn more about these compounds

1:15:44.780 --> 1:15:46.860
 and their supplementation and their effects,

1:15:46.860 --> 1:15:48.380
 I encourage you to check out

1:15:48.380 --> 1:15:51.260
 the ever valuable website, examine.com.

1:15:51.260 --> 1:15:54.120
 It's zero cost to access and they provide references

1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:57.040
 and some more details about these sorts of compounds

1:15:57.040 --> 1:15:58.740
 and other related compounds.

1:15:58.740 --> 1:16:00.820
 Now, if we were going to look at behavioral tools

1:16:00.820 --> 1:16:03.100
 for potently increasing dopamine,

1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:05.420
 that too is a vast landscape.

1:16:05.420 --> 1:16:09.660
 And we know based on hundreds, if not thousands of studies,

1:16:09.660 --> 1:16:13.620
 that things like winning at some sort of competition

1:16:13.620 --> 1:16:15.780
 or succeeding in reaching a goal

1:16:15.780 --> 1:16:17.340
 can certainly increase dopamine.

1:16:17.340 --> 1:16:18.980
 We talk a lot about this in the episode

1:16:18.980 --> 1:16:23.180
 on dopamine motivation and drive, but leaving that aside,

1:16:23.180 --> 1:16:25.400
 there are certain behavioral protocols

1:16:25.400 --> 1:16:29.420
 that are unrelated to your overall goals and motivations

1:16:29.420 --> 1:16:31.980
 that can increase dopamine in a very sustained way.

1:16:31.980 --> 1:16:33.740
 And without question,

1:16:33.740 --> 1:16:36.340
 the most potent behavioral tool for doing that

1:16:36.340 --> 1:16:39.540
 is going to be deliberate cold exposure.

1:16:39.540 --> 1:16:43.180
 Deliberate cold exposure has been talked about a lot here

1:16:43.180 --> 1:16:47.660
 and elsewhere in terms of its ability to do things

1:16:47.660 --> 1:16:51.260
 like reduce inflammation as a way to test

1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:54.800
 and improve resilience because uncomfortable cold,

1:16:54.800 --> 1:16:56.520
 provided it's applied safely,

1:16:56.520 --> 1:16:58.700
 is a great way to learn to be more resilient

1:16:58.700 --> 1:17:00.300
 because you're essentially staying

1:17:00.300 --> 1:17:02.380
 or forcing yourself to stay in a circumstance

1:17:02.380 --> 1:17:04.980
 where your system is flooded with adrenaline.

1:17:04.980 --> 1:17:09.980
 But one lesser known aspect of deliberate cold exposure

1:17:10.100 --> 1:17:13.020
 is one that's been demonstrated quite convincingly in humans.

1:17:13.020 --> 1:17:15.020
 It comes from a study published in the year 2000.

1:17:15.020 --> 1:17:16.060
 I'll link to this study.

1:17:16.060 --> 1:17:18.580
 I love this study, by the way.

1:17:18.580 --> 1:17:20.100
 I covered it many times on this podcast

1:17:20.100 --> 1:17:23.400
 because I love it so much and I think it's truly important.

1:17:23.400 --> 1:17:26.440
 And that's the study from Sramak et al.

1:17:26.440 --> 1:17:28.820
 entitled Human Physiological Responses to Immersion

1:17:28.820 --> 1:17:30.380
 into Water of Different Temperatures.

1:17:30.380 --> 1:17:32.220
 I'm not going to go into this into a ton of detail

1:17:32.220 --> 1:17:34.660
 for sake of time, but basically what they show

1:17:34.660 --> 1:17:36.660
 is that putting people into cold water,

1:17:36.660 --> 1:17:39.180
 and I should mention the water that they used in this study

1:17:39.180 --> 1:17:40.160
 wasn't that cold.

1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:41.340
 They had a bunch of different conditions,

1:17:41.340 --> 1:17:43.500
 but they had people that got into, for instance,

1:17:43.500 --> 1:17:46.460
 60 degree Fahrenheit water for up to two hours,

1:17:46.460 --> 1:17:49.420
 had them sitting there in a lawn chair up to their neck,

1:17:49.420 --> 1:17:54.400
 had very long sustained increases in dopamine transmission

1:17:54.400 --> 1:17:57.900
 and dopamine circulation in their brain and body.

1:17:57.900 --> 1:18:00.820
 And also some of the other catecholamines.

1:18:00.820 --> 1:18:02.860
 As I mentioned before, dopamine tends to collaborate

1:18:02.860 --> 1:18:05.220
 with epinephrine and vice versa.

1:18:05.220 --> 1:18:07.060
 Now you don't need to put yourself

1:18:07.060 --> 1:18:08.900
 into 60 degree Fahrenheit water

1:18:08.900 --> 1:18:11.100
 to get these kinds of sustained increases.

1:18:11.100 --> 1:18:13.660
 And you certainly don't need to do it for two hours.

1:18:14.620 --> 1:18:16.120
 We have strong reason to believe,

1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:17.780
 based on subsequent studies,

1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:19.760
 in fact, published just this last year,

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:23.820
 that getting into much colder water of say 50 degrees

1:18:23.820 --> 1:18:27.420
 or 55 degrees or even 45 degrees Fahrenheit

1:18:27.420 --> 1:18:30.580
 can potently increase dopamine and epinephrine as well.

1:18:30.580 --> 1:18:32.140
 And that you don't need to expose yourself

1:18:32.140 --> 1:18:34.580
 to that cold water for nearly as long.

1:18:34.580 --> 1:18:37.500
 So perhaps even as short as one minute

1:18:37.500 --> 1:18:40.640
 or even 30 seconds exposure to really cold water

1:18:40.640 --> 1:18:44.500
 can lead to these potent long lasting increases in dopamine.

1:18:44.500 --> 1:18:46.980
 Many people will ask which protocols to follow.

1:18:46.980 --> 1:18:49.300
 For instance, will a cold shower suffice?

1:18:49.300 --> 1:18:51.580
 Very likely yes, if your shower gets cold enough.

1:18:51.580 --> 1:18:53.440
 Do you need ice floating in the bath?

1:18:53.440 --> 1:18:55.020
 No, it's all about the temperature

1:18:55.020 --> 1:18:57.100
 and not whether or not there's ice present or not.

1:18:57.100 --> 1:18:58.300
 How long to stay in there?

1:18:58.300 --> 1:18:59.660
 There are a lot of details

1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:01.540
 that we don't have time to go into this episode.

1:19:01.540 --> 1:19:05.060
 Please see the episode on the use of deliberate cold

1:19:05.060 --> 1:19:06.340
 for health and performance.

1:19:06.340 --> 1:19:08.060
 You'll find that at hubermanlab.com.

1:19:08.060 --> 1:19:09.640
 We have a newsletter related to this.

1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:11.820
 It gets into a lot of detailed protocols.

1:19:11.820 --> 1:19:16.660
 But in general, we can say that the way to evoke dopamine

1:19:16.660 --> 1:19:18.620
 and epinephrine release using cold water

1:19:18.620 --> 1:19:22.000
 is to ideally you would do cold water immersion.

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:24.100
 If you can't, you'd use cold shower.

1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:26.860
 But you want to use a temperature that is safe,

1:19:26.860 --> 1:19:28.520
 meaning you're not going to have a heart attack,

1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:29.700
 but that is uncomfortable

1:19:29.700 --> 1:19:31.180
 such that you really want to get out

1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:33.980
 and then staying in for anywhere from one minute

1:19:33.980 --> 1:19:36.620
 to 10 minutes, depending on how cold adapted you are,

1:19:36.620 --> 1:19:38.980
 and then getting out and drying off

1:19:38.980 --> 1:19:39.820
 and going about your day

1:19:39.820 --> 1:19:41.020
 unless you have some other protocol

1:19:41.020 --> 1:19:42.820
 that you're trying to extract from the cold.

1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:45.180
 So this is a cold exposure protocol

1:19:45.180 --> 1:19:48.560
 specifically aimed at increasing dopamine.

1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:50.460
 For some people out there, you might think,

1:19:50.460 --> 1:19:51.300
 this is kind of silly,

1:19:51.300 --> 1:19:53.380
 using cold water to increase dopamine.

1:19:53.380 --> 1:19:56.140
 But when you look at the data in humans

1:19:56.140 --> 1:19:58.060
 on the effect of cold water exposure

1:19:58.060 --> 1:19:59.820
 to stimulate long lasting,

1:19:59.820 --> 1:20:02.880
 very significant increases in dopamine and epinephrine,

1:20:02.880 --> 1:20:06.320
 I think you'll agree that this is a really potent tool

1:20:06.320 --> 1:20:09.860
 that provided it's given safely and gone about safely

1:20:09.860 --> 1:20:12.100
 is giving you the kinds of increases in dopamine

1:20:12.100 --> 1:20:14.940
 that you would seek using prescription pharmacology.

1:20:14.940 --> 1:20:16.760
 Now, it shouldn't be used as a replacement

1:20:16.760 --> 1:20:18.540
 for prescription pharmacology,

1:20:18.540 --> 1:20:20.780
 although people have done that to success.

1:20:20.780 --> 1:20:23.660
 One of the previous guests on the Huberman Lab podcast

1:20:23.660 --> 1:20:24.780
 was Dr. Anna Lemke,

1:20:24.780 --> 1:20:26.820
 our director of the Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic

1:20:26.820 --> 1:20:27.660
 at Stanford.

1:20:27.660 --> 1:20:29.660
 She has an amazing book called Dopamine Nation,

1:20:29.660 --> 1:20:32.900
 all about dopamine and both its uses healthy

1:20:32.900 --> 1:20:35.380
 and its perils in things like addiction.

1:20:35.380 --> 1:20:38.020
 And she describes a patient of hers

1:20:38.020 --> 1:20:39.740
 that used deliberate cold exposure

1:20:39.740 --> 1:20:41.660
 to try and maintain dopamine levels

1:20:41.660 --> 1:20:43.300
 while coming off of drugs

1:20:43.300 --> 1:20:45.940
 that were increasing dopamine so potently

1:20:45.940 --> 1:20:48.060
 that they were putting him down the path of addiction.

1:20:48.060 --> 1:20:51.580
 So the use of cold water for increasing dopamine

1:20:51.580 --> 1:20:52.820
 is a real tool.

1:20:52.820 --> 1:20:54.860
 It's, I would say, a power tool.

1:20:54.860 --> 1:20:56.380
 In fact, it's the kind of thing

1:20:56.380 --> 1:20:57.860
 that if you want to increase dopamine

1:20:57.860 --> 1:20:59.660
 for sake of motivation,

1:20:59.660 --> 1:21:01.180
 it might be your first go-to

1:21:01.180 --> 1:21:02.680
 provided you're also doing the things

1:21:02.680 --> 1:21:04.380
 to maintain dopamine baseline,

1:21:04.380 --> 1:21:06.460
 like sunlight exposure in particular,

1:21:06.460 --> 1:21:08.900
 making sure you're getting sufficient amounts of tyrosine

1:21:08.900 --> 1:21:10.580
 containing foods and so on.

1:21:10.580 --> 1:21:11.760
 And now just very briefly,

1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:14.060
 I want to point to a few quick tools

1:21:14.060 --> 1:21:19.060
 that good peer-reviewed data tell us can be leveraged

1:21:19.100 --> 1:21:21.620
 in order to make sure that you have sufficient dopamine

1:21:21.620 --> 1:21:23.740
 when you want it or that it's available

1:21:23.740 --> 1:21:24.900
 for it to be released

1:21:24.900 --> 1:21:27.900
 by any number of the tools I provided thus far.

1:21:27.900 --> 1:21:31.240
 And those are sufficient number of B vitamins.

1:21:31.240 --> 1:21:34.100
 So it turns out that B vitamins,

1:21:34.100 --> 1:21:37.120
 in particular B6 or vitamin B6,

1:21:37.120 --> 1:21:40.020
 can potently reduce prolactin levels.

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:41.780
 And again, prolactin and dopamine

1:21:41.780 --> 1:21:44.040
 tend to work in kind of push-pull fashion.

1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:45.940
 That said, you should be cautious

1:21:45.940 --> 1:21:48.900
 about taking excessive levels of B6.

1:21:48.900 --> 1:21:50.940
 It is a vitamin that if you take too much,

1:21:50.940 --> 1:21:52.780
 you'll likely excrete it through your urine,

1:21:52.780 --> 1:21:54.180
 but there is evidence

1:21:54.180 --> 1:21:56.860
 that having excessively high levels of B6

1:21:56.860 --> 1:21:59.420
 or supplementing with excessively high levels of B6

1:21:59.420 --> 1:22:01.300
 can cause some peripheral neuropathy,

1:22:01.300 --> 1:22:03.580
 some death of nerves in the periphery.

1:22:03.580 --> 1:22:05.540
 If you want to know what dosage levels are relevant there,

1:22:05.540 --> 1:22:06.680
 just simply look it up online.

1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:08.220
 There's a lot of information about this,

1:22:08.220 --> 1:22:09.380
 but you do want to make sure

1:22:09.380 --> 1:22:12.340
 that you're getting enough B6, B12, et cetera,

1:22:12.340 --> 1:22:15.420
 such that you can keep prolactin levels in check.

1:22:15.420 --> 1:22:18.880
 And if you suspect that you have a dopamine deficiency,

1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:19.780
 please talk to your doctor

1:22:19.780 --> 1:22:21.080
 and talk to them about ways

1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:23.020
 you might adjust that prolactin down

1:22:23.020 --> 1:22:25.180
 and thereby dopamine up.

1:22:25.180 --> 1:22:28.700
 The other way to ensure that dopamine levels stay high

1:22:28.700 --> 1:22:31.500
 or put differently that you don't quash

1:22:31.500 --> 1:22:33.760
 whatever dopamine you have in your system

1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:36.620
 is to really avoid bright light exposure to your eyes

1:22:36.620 --> 1:22:38.780
 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

1:22:38.780 --> 1:22:40.000
 Or another way of putting this,

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.500
 because I realize people sleep at different times, et cetera,

1:22:42.500 --> 1:22:45.060
 is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes,

1:22:45.060 --> 1:22:47.660
 not just blue light, but all colors of light,

1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:52.620
 in phase three, that is 17 to 24 hours after waking up,

1:22:52.620 --> 1:22:54.420
 because that's really when you should be asleep

1:22:54.420 --> 1:22:57.640
 or trying to get asleep if you're having trouble sleeping.

1:22:57.640 --> 1:22:59.360
 Work from Samir Hattar's lab,

1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:00.860
 the director of the Chronobiology Unit

1:23:00.860 --> 1:23:02.960
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health,

1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:06.980
 again, a previous Huberman Lab podcast guest,

1:23:06.980 --> 1:23:09.580
 tell us that bright light exposure

1:23:09.580 --> 1:23:13.180
 in phase three of your circadian cycle,

1:23:13.180 --> 1:23:15.540
 17 to 24 hours after waking,

1:23:15.540 --> 1:23:18.500
 can have dramatic effects in reducing dopamine levels

1:23:18.500 --> 1:23:20.340
 by way of activating a neural circuit

1:23:20.340 --> 1:23:22.280
 involving something called the habenula.

1:23:22.280 --> 1:23:24.260
 Want to get into too many details right now,

1:23:24.260 --> 1:23:26.060
 but really try and keep the lights dim

1:23:26.060 --> 1:23:29.120
 in the middle of the night or off if you can do that safely.

1:23:29.120 --> 1:23:30.420
 It's really going to help

1:23:30.420 --> 1:23:32.820
 if you're turning on your phone brightly,

1:23:32.820 --> 1:23:34.720
 if you're turning on bright lights,

1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:37.300
 it's not just going to negatively impact melatonin,

1:23:37.300 --> 1:23:39.060
 the hormone that helps you fall and stay asleep,

1:23:39.060 --> 1:23:43.140
 it's also going to negatively impact dopamine levels,

1:23:43.140 --> 1:23:46.420
 not just that night, but the subsequent day.

1:23:46.420 --> 1:23:49.020
 So that more or less summarizes our coverage

1:23:49.020 --> 1:23:52.620
 of ways to use behavior and supplementation and nutrition

1:23:52.620 --> 1:23:55.460
 to increase dopamine and dopamine receptor efficacy

1:23:55.460 --> 1:23:58.560
 and number, and to keep sufficient amounts of dopamine

1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:02.820
 in your system day to day for motivation, mood, and focus.

1:24:02.820 --> 1:24:04.440
 And of course, keep in mind those things

1:24:04.440 --> 1:24:07.940
 that can suppress dopamine, the bright light exposure,

1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:10.060
 elevated prolactin, and so on.

1:24:10.060 --> 1:24:11.940
 My hope is that by understanding those tools

1:24:11.940 --> 1:24:13.620
 and how they work and understanding

1:24:13.620 --> 1:24:16.540
 that dopamine does certain things and not others,

1:24:16.540 --> 1:24:20.300
 that you can assemble a versatile kit of behaviors

1:24:20.300 --> 1:24:21.680
 and other things that you can do

1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:23.820
 in order to adjust your dopamine levels

1:24:23.820 --> 1:24:26.380
 according to your particular goals.

1:24:26.380 --> 1:24:29.860
 I want to just briefly return to the fact, however,

1:24:29.860 --> 1:24:33.180
 that all of that is riding on that phase one,

1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:34.540
 phase two background,

1:24:34.540 --> 1:24:38.300
 meaning it's probably going to take less cold water exposure

1:24:38.300 --> 1:24:41.100
 or I should say less time doing cold water exposure

1:24:41.100 --> 1:24:43.860
 early in the day to get a big increase in dopamine

1:24:43.860 --> 1:24:45.580
 than it would later in the day,

1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:46.500
 because later in the day,

1:24:46.500 --> 1:24:48.900
 your baseline levels of dopamine are lower

1:24:48.900 --> 1:24:51.620
 and you've got more serotonin circulating.

1:24:51.620 --> 1:24:54.460
 That should make sense to you now as to why that's the case.

1:24:54.460 --> 1:24:56.940
 And does that mean that you should really modify

1:24:56.940 --> 1:24:58.420
 your protocols dramatically?

1:24:58.420 --> 1:25:01.220
 Probably not, but you might keep that in mind

1:25:01.220 --> 1:25:02.280
 that if, for instance,

1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:04.380
 you need to be in a highly motivated focused state

1:25:04.380 --> 1:25:06.520
 in the late part of the day for whatever reason,

1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:10.060
 it might take a few or more of these tools in combination

1:25:10.060 --> 1:25:11.460
 in order to accomplish that.

1:25:11.460 --> 1:25:12.300
 Whereas if you're somebody

1:25:12.300 --> 1:25:13.420
 who feels pretty good during the day,

1:25:13.420 --> 1:25:15.100
 but you're kind of lacking motivation

1:25:15.100 --> 1:25:16.500
 and you want to increase dopamine levels

1:25:16.500 --> 1:25:18.240
 and you don't yet need to

1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:20.940
 or want to resort to prescription drugs or supplementation,

1:25:20.940 --> 1:25:23.260
 well, then you might layer in a couple behavioral protocols,

1:25:23.260 --> 1:25:24.720
 paying attention to, of course,

1:25:24.720 --> 1:25:25.760
 the things that you might be doing

1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:28.580
 that would also potentially suppress dopamine.

1:25:28.580 --> 1:25:31.740
 So again, that kit of tools is designed for you

1:25:31.740 --> 1:25:34.820
 to play with if you choose, if it's safe for you,

1:25:34.820 --> 1:25:37.000
 to apply them, then do that.

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:38.780
 Consider doing them individually,

1:25:38.780 --> 1:25:42.220
 not trying to hit all the tools all at once, right?

1:25:42.220 --> 1:25:44.380
 I mean, why throw all those tools

1:25:44.380 --> 1:25:46.380
 at your dopamine system at once?

1:25:46.380 --> 1:25:48.680
 Better would be to have those tools in your kit

1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:49.860
 and be able to deploy them

1:25:49.860 --> 1:25:51.420
 depending on whether or not you're on travel,

1:25:51.420 --> 1:25:53.880
 whether or not you're eating well or less well,

1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:56.060
 whether or not you're sleeping well or less well,

1:25:56.060 --> 1:25:57.300
 that's highly individual.

1:25:57.300 --> 1:26:00.040
 And I like to think that in having those tools in hand,

1:26:00.040 --> 1:26:01.980
 you'll be able to adjust them and apply them

1:26:01.980 --> 1:26:04.140
 in the ways that allow you to access

1:26:04.140 --> 1:26:06.820
 the dopamine increases that you're after.

1:26:06.820 --> 1:26:08.820
 So next I'd like to talk about epinephrine,

1:26:08.820 --> 1:26:10.700
 also called adrenaline.

1:26:10.700 --> 1:26:13.420
 I want to point out that epinephrine is released

1:26:13.420 --> 1:26:15.560
 both in the brain and the body.

1:26:15.560 --> 1:26:17.700
 In fact, there's a barrier between brain and body

1:26:17.700 --> 1:26:19.140
 that prevents the epinephrine

1:26:19.140 --> 1:26:21.380
 that's released from your adrenal glands

1:26:21.380 --> 1:26:23.320
 from crossing the blood-brain barrier.

1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:27.140
 So your brain has a separate site called the locus coeruleus.

1:26:27.140 --> 1:26:29.240
 This is a collection of neurons in the back of the brain

1:26:29.240 --> 1:26:30.780
 that kind of sprinkler the rest of the brain

1:26:30.780 --> 1:26:35.000
 with epinephrine and essentially wakes up

1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.580
 whatever neural circuits happen to see,

1:26:37.580 --> 1:26:40.460
 or I should say wake up any circuits

1:26:40.460 --> 1:26:43.900
 where that epinephrine happens to arrive, right?

1:26:43.900 --> 1:26:46.560
 And generally increase the excitability of those networks.

1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:50.020
 That's why we say epinephrine increases energy.

1:26:50.020 --> 1:26:51.660
 I'm not talking about caloric energy,

1:26:51.660 --> 1:26:53.700
 although that's distantly related to this,

1:26:53.700 --> 1:26:57.140
 but really energy and the desire to move,

1:26:57.140 --> 1:26:58.840
 the feeling that we can think,

1:26:58.840 --> 1:27:00.500
 the feeling that we can be alert.

1:27:00.500 --> 1:27:02.140
 In fact, if you look at somebody

1:27:02.140 --> 1:27:04.280
 and their eyelids are wide open,

1:27:04.280 --> 1:27:05.120
 in large part,

1:27:05.120 --> 1:27:07.100
 that's because of a lot of adrenaline in their system.

1:27:07.100 --> 1:27:08.620
 If their pupils are really big

1:27:08.620 --> 1:27:11.060
 and their eyes are really wide open in general,

1:27:11.060 --> 1:27:13.380
 that means they have a lot of epinephrine circulating there.

1:27:13.380 --> 1:27:15.460
 Whereas when we're tired and we're kind of hood-eyed

1:27:15.460 --> 1:27:16.580
 and we're just sort of sleepy

1:27:16.580 --> 1:27:18.220
 or our pupils are really small,

1:27:18.220 --> 1:27:20.940
 in general, that's because levels of epinephrine

1:27:20.940 --> 1:27:23.340
 and also dopamine, remember they work together,

1:27:23.340 --> 1:27:26.300
 levels of epinephrine and dopamine tend to be lower.

1:27:26.300 --> 1:27:28.540
 This is also why when people take any drug,

1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:31.640
 like again, not recommending this amphetamine or cocaine

1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:34.340
 or any stimulant, their pupils tend to be huge,

1:27:34.340 --> 1:27:36.740
 their eyes tend to be wide open,

1:27:36.740 --> 1:27:38.740
 they don't blink very often,

1:27:38.740 --> 1:27:42.260
 and the opposite is true when people take sedatives.

1:27:42.260 --> 1:27:43.660
 So it all starts to make sense

1:27:43.660 --> 1:27:46.660
 when you think about the basic actions of these things.

1:27:46.660 --> 1:27:51.240
 For many people, increasing adrenaline or epinephrine

1:27:51.240 --> 1:27:52.520
 might seem like a crazy idea.

1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:55.300
 Most people probably associate this molecule with stress

1:27:55.300 --> 1:27:56.860
 and they would like to be less stressed.

1:27:56.860 --> 1:27:58.740
 And we've done entire episodes about stress,

1:27:58.740 --> 1:28:00.800
 how to master stress, how to leverage stress,

1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:01.820
 how to conquer stress.

1:28:01.820 --> 1:28:03.660
 There are a lot of great tools to do that

1:28:03.660 --> 1:28:05.560
 that are behavioral, supplementation-based.

1:28:05.560 --> 1:28:08.740
 Please see the episode on mastering stress for those tools.

1:28:08.740 --> 1:28:11.860
 But there are people, including me,

1:28:11.860 --> 1:28:14.380
 that want to increase our levels of epinephrine

1:28:14.380 --> 1:28:16.180
 at least early in the day.

1:28:16.180 --> 1:28:17.900
 I'm somebody who wakes up rather slowly.

1:28:17.900 --> 1:28:19.160
 In fact, right after waking up,

1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:21.060
 I rarely want to bounce out of bed.

1:28:21.060 --> 1:28:22.660
 I try and push myself to do that.

1:28:22.660 --> 1:28:25.220
 I'm always impressed by these choco-willink types

1:28:25.220 --> 1:28:29.000
 that are up at 430 or up at five and already into action.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.180
 I tend to be kind of thinking about thinking about

1:28:32.180 --> 1:28:34.680
 maybe being in action early in the day.

1:28:34.680 --> 1:28:37.880
 But I try and push myself to get into action,

1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:40.420
 which itself can increase epinephrine.

1:28:40.420 --> 1:28:42.980
 I should mention that any physical activity,

1:28:42.980 --> 1:28:45.540
 any physical activity, walking, running,

1:28:45.540 --> 1:28:48.900
 weightlifting, swimming, even talking for that matter,

1:28:48.900 --> 1:28:51.220
 is going to increase levels of epinephrine.

1:28:51.220 --> 1:28:54.180
 Locus coeruleus is a brain structure

1:28:54.180 --> 1:28:56.940
 that is tightly coupled with behaviors

1:28:56.940 --> 1:28:58.460
 in a bi-directional way.

1:28:58.460 --> 1:29:01.140
 That is when you are in action,

1:29:01.140 --> 1:29:02.940
 you increase the amount of epinephrine

1:29:02.940 --> 1:29:06.340
 released from locus coeruleus, you wake up the brain.

1:29:06.340 --> 1:29:09.680
 And conversely, when locus coeruleus is active,

1:29:09.680 --> 1:29:10.560
 the brain wakes up.

1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:11.540
 So it's reciprocal.

1:29:11.540 --> 1:29:13.260
 It goes both directions.

1:29:13.260 --> 1:29:16.220
 So I saw a funny tweet actually earlier today.

1:29:16.220 --> 1:29:20.220
 It was something like going to the gym gives you energy,

1:29:20.220 --> 1:29:21.940
 but you need energy to go to the gym.

1:29:21.940 --> 1:29:24.120
 Sounds like a pyramid scheme to me,

1:29:24.120 --> 1:29:25.540
 which made me chuckle,

1:29:25.540 --> 1:29:28.840
 but of course overlooks the fact that indeed,

1:29:28.840 --> 1:29:29.860
 if you have energy,

1:29:29.860 --> 1:29:31.860
 you are more likely to be willing to get

1:29:31.860 --> 1:29:34.380
 into physical movement or cognitive movement

1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:37.900
 and thinking hard or thinking a lot about something.

1:29:37.900 --> 1:29:42.160
 But also it is absolutely scientifically proven

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:46.200
 that being in action increases levels of epinephrine.

1:29:46.200 --> 1:29:49.000
 This is why exercising early in the day

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:51.660
 gives you more energy for rest of day.

1:29:51.660 --> 1:29:53.540
 You still might experience a little bit of a crash

1:29:53.540 --> 1:29:54.580
 in the afternoon,

1:29:54.580 --> 1:29:56.820
 especially if you're getting up extra early,

1:29:56.820 --> 1:29:59.120
 or if you're drinking caffeine too close to waking.

1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:00.300
 I've talked about this before.

1:30:00.300 --> 1:30:03.220
 If you drink too much caffeine close to waking,

1:30:03.220 --> 1:30:04.740
 you're going to have an afternoon crash.

1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:06.860
 Better to push that caffeine intake out

1:30:06.860 --> 1:30:09.100
 about 90 to 120 minutes after waking.

1:30:09.100 --> 1:30:11.300
 I know this is really painful for certain people,

1:30:11.300 --> 1:30:15.140
 but caffeine does increase epinephrine.

1:30:15.140 --> 1:30:17.780
 Caffeine does other things to limit sleepiness.

1:30:17.780 --> 1:30:20.940
 And by pushing it out 90 to 120 minutes after waking,

1:30:20.940 --> 1:30:25.420
 you will avoid the afternoon crash to a large degree.

1:30:25.420 --> 1:30:27.820
 And if you get up and you exercise

1:30:27.820 --> 1:30:29.660
 or even do any movement of any kind,

1:30:29.660 --> 1:30:32.820
 a hundred jumping jacks or a walk if you can't do that,

1:30:32.820 --> 1:30:35.700
 anything like that will increase the total amount

1:30:35.700 --> 1:30:38.280
 of epinephrine that you secrete into your bloodstream

1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:41.980
 and in your brain and will get you more energy,

1:30:41.980 --> 1:30:43.760
 not just in that moment, but throughout the day.

1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:44.700
 So keep that in mind.

1:30:44.700 --> 1:30:47.580
 Exercise does indeed give you energy.

1:30:47.580 --> 1:30:48.940
 It burns caloric energy,

1:30:48.940 --> 1:30:51.860
 but it gives you neural energy by way of increasing

1:30:51.860 --> 1:30:54.680
 epinephrine transmission from locus coeruleus.

1:30:54.680 --> 1:30:58.420
 And presumably if the exercise is intense enough,

1:30:58.420 --> 1:31:01.220
 adrenaline epinephrine release from the adrenals

1:31:01.220 --> 1:31:02.860
 within your body as well.

1:31:02.860 --> 1:31:05.960
 So we have exercise and we have caffeine as potent tools

1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:09.100
 for increasing epinephrine and thereby energy.

1:31:09.100 --> 1:31:11.540
 Another potent tool that's purely behavioral,

1:31:11.540 --> 1:31:14.800
 but is known to work based on excellent studies in humans.

1:31:14.800 --> 1:31:17.260
 And actually my laboratory has been doing similar types

1:31:17.260 --> 1:31:18.940
 of studies that are soon to be published.

1:31:18.940 --> 1:31:22.820
 We hope is so-called cyclic hyperventilation.

1:31:22.820 --> 1:31:25.300
 Some of you may be familiar with Wim Hof breathing.

1:31:25.300 --> 1:31:27.060
 There's also Tummo breathing,

1:31:27.060 --> 1:31:29.900
 which is very similar Kundalini breathing.

1:31:29.900 --> 1:31:32.220
 All of those styles of breathing involve

1:31:32.220 --> 1:31:33.780
 cyclic hyperventilation,

1:31:33.780 --> 1:31:38.160
 deep inhales and either passive exhales or active exhales,

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:40.300
 but repeating inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale

1:31:40.300 --> 1:31:42.660
 in a very deep and repetitive way.

1:31:42.660 --> 1:31:44.620
 If you were to do that right now,

1:31:44.620 --> 1:31:46.540
 doesn't matter if you do it through your nose or mouth,

1:31:46.540 --> 1:31:48.860
 although ideally you would do the inhale through your nose

1:31:48.860 --> 1:31:49.820
 and the exhale through your mouth.

1:31:49.820 --> 1:31:52.900
 If you did that for 25 repetitions,

1:31:52.900 --> 1:31:55.980
 25 inhales and exhales, you would feel more alert.

1:31:55.980 --> 1:31:57.660
 You'd also feel more warm, why?

1:31:57.660 --> 1:32:00.920
 Because you increased epinephrine adrenaline release

1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:02.020
 in the brain and body.

1:32:02.020 --> 1:32:04.520
 It works the first time and it works every time

1:32:04.520 --> 1:32:07.380
 to increase epinephrine and thereby energy.

1:32:07.380 --> 1:32:10.140
 And in fact, there are protocols

1:32:10.140 --> 1:32:11.240
 and great scientific studies

1:32:11.240 --> 1:32:16.060
 of using cyclic hyperventilation for periods of minutes,

1:32:16.060 --> 1:32:17.860
 if not longer, where for instance,

1:32:17.860 --> 1:32:20.580
 you would do 25 big inhales and exhales

1:32:20.580 --> 1:32:22.940
 followed by a brief breath hold with your lungs empty,

1:32:22.940 --> 1:32:27.180
 then repeat 25, then brief breath hold, excuse me, exhale,

1:32:27.180 --> 1:32:28.220
 hold your lungs empty,

1:32:28.220 --> 1:32:30.740
 and then repeat again for a third round if you like.

1:32:30.740 --> 1:32:33.200
 If you do that over and over, you're going to be very alert.

1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:34.260
 You're going to have more energy.

1:32:34.260 --> 1:32:36.060
 You're going to feel like you want to move around

1:32:36.060 --> 1:32:36.900
 a lot more.

1:32:36.900 --> 1:32:38.260
 In fact, you might even feel agitated.

1:32:38.260 --> 1:32:41.220
 So people with a lot of anxiety or prone to panic attack

1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:43.500
 might want to be cautious in how they train

1:32:43.500 --> 1:32:45.220
 and embark on that type of breathing,

1:32:45.220 --> 1:32:46.780
 might want to approach it a little more carefully

1:32:46.780 --> 1:32:48.020
 or avoid it altogether.

1:32:48.020 --> 1:32:50.100
 But for most people, cyclic hyperventilation

1:32:50.100 --> 1:32:51.660
 is simply going to get you more energized

1:32:51.660 --> 1:32:53.660
 and feeling like you want to move,

1:32:53.660 --> 1:32:55.380
 feeling like you can think more clearly

1:32:55.380 --> 1:32:57.100
 and you will be more wide-eyed and alert

1:32:57.100 --> 1:32:59.820
 because you are releasing adrenaline.

1:32:59.820 --> 1:33:01.380
 And the cold water exposure protocol

1:33:01.380 --> 1:33:02.380
 that I talked about earlier,

1:33:02.380 --> 1:33:04.540
 and that's covered in our episode on cold

1:33:04.540 --> 1:33:06.620
 and in the newsletter on cold.

1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:08.540
 Well, that, as I mentioned earlier,

1:33:08.540 --> 1:33:11.900
 potently increases dopamine, but also epinephrine.

1:33:11.900 --> 1:33:13.200
 So that's another terrific tool,

1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:16.720
 whether or not it's applied by cold shower or cold immersion

1:33:16.720 --> 1:33:19.060
 or some other thing like cryo,

1:33:19.060 --> 1:33:20.820
 that is going to make you more alert

1:33:20.820 --> 1:33:23.060
 because it releases adrenaline.

1:33:23.060 --> 1:33:25.500
 Now, we can't really say that there are foods

1:33:25.500 --> 1:33:27.240
 to increase epinephrine.

1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:30.780
 Rather, there are foods that include a lot of tyrosine

1:33:30.780 --> 1:33:32.660
 that will increase dopamine.

1:33:32.660 --> 1:33:34.480
 And remember, dopamine is the molecule

1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:37.200
 from which epinephrine is synthesized.

1:33:37.200 --> 1:33:40.060
 So we can't really point to a particular food

1:33:40.060 --> 1:33:42.080
 or categories of food for increasing epinephrine.

1:33:42.080 --> 1:33:44.500
 I think caffeine and things like it

1:33:44.500 --> 1:33:46.220
 will increase epinephrine.

1:33:46.220 --> 1:33:48.220
 There are, of course, prescription drugs

1:33:48.220 --> 1:33:50.240
 that will increase epinephrine.

1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:53.540
 And of course, there are all sorts of so-called beta blockers

1:33:53.540 --> 1:33:55.920
 that will block the receptors for epinephrine

1:33:55.920 --> 1:33:58.260
 to make you feel calm for public speaking

1:33:58.260 --> 1:34:00.300
 or for various heart conditions, et cetera.

1:34:00.300 --> 1:34:02.240
 That's really the domain of physicians

1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:05.460
 and should really be worked out with your cardiologist,

1:34:05.460 --> 1:34:06.860
 with a physician, et cetera.

1:34:06.860 --> 1:34:09.700
 I think the tools of exercise

1:34:09.700 --> 1:34:13.940
 and should you want very potent increases in adrenaline,

1:34:13.940 --> 1:34:15.660
 high-intensity exercise,

1:34:15.660 --> 1:34:19.220
 as well as the tools of caffeine, cyclic hyperventilation,

1:34:19.220 --> 1:34:20.780
 and deliberate cold exposure,

1:34:20.780 --> 1:34:24.580
 really combined to give you a nice little kit,

1:34:24.580 --> 1:34:26.380
 I would say a versatile kit,

1:34:26.380 --> 1:34:28.100
 of ways to increase epinephrine

1:34:28.100 --> 1:34:30.780
 for sake of having more physical and mental energy.

1:34:30.780 --> 1:34:33.540
 So next is the neuromodulator acetylcholine.

1:34:33.540 --> 1:34:35.180
 And as I mentioned earlier,

1:34:35.180 --> 1:34:38.900
 acetylcholine is associated with states of focus.

1:34:38.900 --> 1:34:40.140
 And those states of focus

1:34:40.140 --> 1:34:42.460
 can be high-energy states of focus.

1:34:42.460 --> 1:34:45.300
 So the ones that are accompanied

1:34:45.300 --> 1:34:47.860
 by high levels of dopamine and epinephrine

1:34:47.860 --> 1:34:49.920
 and where we're really excited about

1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:51.940
 and really lasered in on something,

1:34:51.940 --> 1:34:56.020
 or they can be the calmer, more relaxed states of focus,

1:34:56.020 --> 1:34:58.820
 like reading a book or practicing music

1:34:58.820 --> 1:35:01.120
 or listening very carefully to somebody

1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:03.340
 in a way that's relaxed and calm.

1:35:03.340 --> 1:35:06.980
 And yet nonetheless, where we have a narrow cognitive

1:35:06.980 --> 1:35:10.180
 and typically a narrow visual aperture,

1:35:10.180 --> 1:35:12.900
 and typically also a narrow auditory aperture,

1:35:12.900 --> 1:35:15.720
 that is our auditory system and our visual system

1:35:15.720 --> 1:35:17.900
 and our thinking can be very broad.

1:35:17.900 --> 1:35:19.600
 It can be all over the place,

1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:23.780
 or it can be very narrow and it can be very focused.

1:35:23.780 --> 1:35:27.020
 Acetylcholine is released from two major sites in the brain,

1:35:27.020 --> 1:35:29.560
 nucleus basalis, which is in the forebrain,

1:35:29.560 --> 1:35:32.520
 and extends connections out to many different brain areas

1:35:32.520 --> 1:35:36.660
 to offer the opportunity to release acetylcholine locally

1:35:36.660 --> 1:35:39.140
 and more or less in a chemical way,

1:35:39.140 --> 1:35:42.660
 highlight those particular neurons and synapses

1:35:42.660 --> 1:35:45.660
 for strengthening for plasticity later.

1:35:45.660 --> 1:35:48.940
 And it is released from sites in the back of the brain

1:35:48.940 --> 1:35:52.660
 in a way that can increase the so-called fidelity

1:35:52.660 --> 1:35:56.020
 of information coming in through our eyes,

1:35:56.020 --> 1:35:57.120
 our ears, our nose, et cetera.

1:35:57.120 --> 1:35:58.220
 What do I mean by fidelity?

1:35:58.220 --> 1:35:59.940
 Well, we are constantly being bombarded

1:35:59.940 --> 1:36:03.380
 with sensory information through all of our various senses.

1:36:03.380 --> 1:36:05.720
 And acetylcholine released from this area

1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:08.100
 in the back of the brain has the ability

1:36:08.100 --> 1:36:12.460
 to increase the extent to which say visual information

1:36:12.460 --> 1:36:15.280
 or just visual and auditory information

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:17.320
 would make it through to our consciousness,

1:36:17.320 --> 1:36:19.660
 whereas all the other types of sensory information

1:36:19.660 --> 1:36:22.660
 that are coming in are filtered out.

1:36:22.660 --> 1:36:25.880
 So your brain, because it's taking in all this information,

1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:27.820
 needs to decide what to pay attention to.

1:36:27.820 --> 1:36:29.740
 And in this way, we can say that acetylcholine

1:36:29.740 --> 1:36:32.700
 has a lot to do, not just with focus and air quotes,

1:36:32.700 --> 1:36:34.360
 but literally attention,

1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:38.420
 which neural signals become relevant to our consciousness.

1:36:38.420 --> 1:36:40.060
 There's a whole discussion to be had there,

1:36:40.060 --> 1:36:41.420
 and we don't have time for that.

1:36:41.420 --> 1:36:43.800
 Rather, I'd like to focus on what are the tools

1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:47.680
 that one can use to maintain healthy baselines

1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:50.980
 of acetylcholine and increase acetylcholine

1:36:50.980 --> 1:36:53.660
 for sake of learning any type of information,

1:36:53.660 --> 1:36:55.540
 physical, cognitive, or otherwise.

1:36:55.540 --> 1:36:57.300
 Now, it turns out there've been a lot of studies,

1:36:57.300 --> 1:36:59.100
 including many quality peer-reviewed studies

1:36:59.100 --> 1:37:00.140
 carried out in humans,

1:37:00.140 --> 1:37:03.540
 looking at what happens when you increase acetylcholine

1:37:03.540 --> 1:37:05.380
 levels in the brain,

1:37:05.380 --> 1:37:07.980
 and you accompany that with the attempt to learn.

1:37:07.980 --> 1:37:10.400
 And what you find almost always

1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:13.640
 is that people experience increased focus,

1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:15.020
 that when measured,

1:37:15.020 --> 1:37:18.220
 the neuronal responses become more specific,

1:37:18.220 --> 1:37:20.260
 so less broad scale activity in the brain

1:37:20.260 --> 1:37:23.140
 and more specific neural circuit activity,

1:37:23.140 --> 1:37:27.500
 and that this triggers immediate and long-lasting changes

1:37:27.500 --> 1:37:28.900
 in the way those circuits work,

1:37:28.900 --> 1:37:31.180
 even when acetylcholine is not being deployed,

1:37:31.180 --> 1:37:32.700
 so-called neuroplasticity,

1:37:32.700 --> 1:37:34.340
 the circuits literally change.

1:37:34.340 --> 1:37:35.360
 So this is great.

1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:37.740
 The work of Michael Silver at Berkeley,

1:37:37.740 --> 1:37:40.360
 the work of Mike Merzenich at UCSF,

1:37:40.360 --> 1:37:42.380
 the work of Michael Kilgard down in Texas,

1:37:42.380 --> 1:37:44.860
 all of those laboratories see this again and again and again.

1:37:44.860 --> 1:37:47.500
 Increase acetylcholine before and during learning,

1:37:47.500 --> 1:37:49.460
 and there's a much higher probability

1:37:49.460 --> 1:37:51.500
 that the learning will quote unquote sink in,

1:37:51.500 --> 1:37:53.100
 that the information will be retained

1:37:53.100 --> 1:37:55.380
 because those neural circuits change.

1:37:55.380 --> 1:37:59.060
 Now, ways to increase acetylcholine in a potent way

1:37:59.060 --> 1:38:03.460
 include, again, nutrition and supplementation.

1:38:03.460 --> 1:38:06.980
 It is important to have baseline levels of acetylcholine

1:38:06.980 --> 1:38:08.620
 be sufficiently high as well.

1:38:08.620 --> 1:38:10.620
 And for that, really the ideal situation

1:38:10.620 --> 1:38:12.440
 is to regularly ingest foods

1:38:12.440 --> 1:38:14.420
 that provide enough of the precursors

1:38:14.420 --> 1:38:16.380
 for acetylcholine to be made.

1:38:16.380 --> 1:38:18.900
 If you go online and you were to do a search

1:38:18.900 --> 1:38:21.860
 of which foods contain a lot of choline,

1:38:21.860 --> 1:38:25.200
 which is related to the synthesis of acetylcholine,

1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:27.180
 you would get some interesting information back.

1:38:27.180 --> 1:38:29.120
 For instance, beef liver

1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:31.780
 is the most potent source of choline.

1:38:31.780 --> 1:38:34.600
 I know nowadays there's kind of a growing micro trend,

1:38:34.600 --> 1:38:37.380
 if you will, of ingesting beef liver, even raw liver,

1:38:37.380 --> 1:38:38.340
 which to be honest,

1:38:38.340 --> 1:38:40.860
 the thought of ingesting raw liver of any kind

1:38:40.860 --> 1:38:42.420
 activates my area of postrema,

1:38:42.420 --> 1:38:44.620
 which is the area of the brain that triggers nausea.

1:38:44.620 --> 1:38:46.220
 In fact, I'm starting to salivate a bit,

1:38:46.220 --> 1:38:47.060
 not because I'm hungry,

1:38:47.060 --> 1:38:49.960
 but I think the whole concept makes me ill.

1:38:49.960 --> 1:38:54.540
 Nonetheless, cooked liver or raw liver for that matter,

1:38:54.540 --> 1:38:57.940
 or liver of any kind seems to contain a lot of choline.

1:38:57.940 --> 1:38:59.880
 I realize most people,

1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:02.220
 most people are not going to be running out

1:39:02.220 --> 1:39:04.780
 and ingesting large amounts of beef liver.

1:39:04.780 --> 1:39:07.540
 Eggs contain a lot of choline, beef contains choline,

1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:08.740
 soybeans contain choline.

1:39:08.740 --> 1:39:11.260
 So there are vegan or non-meat sources.

1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:13.860
 Chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans,

1:39:13.860 --> 1:39:16.100
 these sorts of things contain a lot of choline

1:39:16.100 --> 1:39:17.800
 and there are other vegetables that contain choline.

1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:20.180
 So depending on your dietary preferences and needs,

1:39:20.180 --> 1:39:23.300
 you can select certain foods to ingest

1:39:23.300 --> 1:39:24.740
 to get enough choline to synthesize

1:39:24.740 --> 1:39:27.400
 enough baseline acetylcholine.

1:39:28.280 --> 1:39:29.900
 In the realm of supplementation,

1:39:29.900 --> 1:39:33.980
 there are some excellent tools for increasing acetylcholine

1:39:33.980 --> 1:39:35.680
 in the acute short term,

1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:38.540
 meaning over the course of about 30 minutes

1:39:38.540 --> 1:39:40.960
 out to about two hours or maybe even four hours.

1:39:40.960 --> 1:39:44.020
 And the number of different molecules that can do that

1:39:44.020 --> 1:39:45.620
 that are available without a prescription,

1:39:45.620 --> 1:39:48.300
 at least in the US, is pretty vast.

1:39:48.300 --> 1:39:51.080
 The most common of those molecules is actually nicotine.

1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:54.340
 Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are abundant

1:39:54.340 --> 1:39:55.780
 throughout the body and brain.

1:39:55.780 --> 1:39:57.780
 They're in various brain circuits.

1:39:57.780 --> 1:40:02.220
 They are on muscle and yes, smoking nicotine

1:40:02.220 --> 1:40:03.720
 either by vaping or cigarette

1:40:03.720 --> 1:40:07.700
 will activate those nicotinic receptors.

1:40:07.700 --> 1:40:10.180
 But of course, smoking is a terrible thing.

1:40:10.180 --> 1:40:12.740
 It will also activate things like lung cancer.

1:40:12.740 --> 1:40:14.140
 So I definitely don't recommend that.

1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:16.980
 It also activates addiction because of the ways

1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:20.060
 that it triggers activation of the dopamine circuit.

1:40:20.060 --> 1:40:24.100
 So I think that triggering activation

1:40:24.100 --> 1:40:27.220
 of acetylcholine related pathways by ingesting nicotine

1:40:27.220 --> 1:40:31.300
 by way of inhalants is generally a bad idea.

1:40:31.300 --> 1:40:34.740
 However, some people will chew Nicorette

1:40:34.740 --> 1:40:37.760
 or other nicotine type gums.

1:40:37.760 --> 1:40:38.600
 I've never done that,

1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:40.500
 but I have friends who actually rely on that.

1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:42.740
 These are typically former smokers

1:40:42.740 --> 1:40:44.180
 that are trying not to smoke,

1:40:44.180 --> 1:40:47.460
 but still want to get some of the focus enhancement

1:40:47.460 --> 1:40:49.340
 that they experienced from nicotine.

1:40:49.340 --> 1:40:51.300
 Some people are very sensitive to nicotine,

1:40:51.300 --> 1:40:52.260
 and this is important.

1:40:52.260 --> 1:40:54.940
 Some people are very sensitive to ingested nicotine.

1:40:54.940 --> 1:40:58.320
 So nowadays there are nicotine dipped toothpicks.

1:40:58.320 --> 1:40:59.740
 There of course is nicotine gum

1:40:59.740 --> 1:41:00.940
 and other sources of nicotine.

1:41:00.940 --> 1:41:02.740
 Some people can take that and feel fine.

1:41:02.740 --> 1:41:05.700
 Some people take it and feel absolutely terrible.

1:41:05.700 --> 1:41:08.740
 I confess I've never actually tried nicotine

1:41:08.740 --> 1:41:10.580
 in any of those forms.

1:41:10.580 --> 1:41:12.020
 So I don't know how they work for me,

1:41:12.020 --> 1:41:14.500
 but some people do use them as cognitive enhancers.

1:41:14.500 --> 1:41:17.880
 In fact, I know one Nobel prize winning neuroscientist

1:41:17.880 --> 1:41:19.560
 who's quite well known in our field

1:41:19.560 --> 1:41:21.580
 for chewing Nicorette all day long.

1:41:21.580 --> 1:41:23.660
 He insists that it really helps him with his focus

1:41:23.660 --> 1:41:25.860
 and he is exceedingly smart and productive.

1:41:25.860 --> 1:41:28.060
 Although I'm sure there are other reasons for that.

1:41:28.060 --> 1:41:31.100
 Supplements that I have used and do use

1:41:31.100 --> 1:41:33.420
 for increasing acetylcholine

1:41:33.420 --> 1:41:37.980
 are things like Alpha-GPC or Hooperzine.

1:41:37.980 --> 1:41:42.260
 Alpha-GPC is in the choline pathway

1:41:42.260 --> 1:41:44.980
 such that more acetylcholine is synthesized

1:41:44.980 --> 1:41:46.140
 after you ingest it.

1:41:46.140 --> 1:41:48.860
 That's the general logic or framework of how it works.

1:41:48.860 --> 1:41:52.420
 Whereas Hooperzine is mainly in the enzymatic pathway.

1:41:52.420 --> 1:41:55.720
 It tends to adjust how much acetylcholine is broken down

1:41:55.720 --> 1:41:59.580
 and lead to net increases in acetylcholine.

1:41:59.580 --> 1:42:02.660
 I will often take 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC

1:42:02.660 --> 1:42:06.380
 prior to workouts or prior to cognitive work bouts.

1:42:06.380 --> 1:42:09.420
 But when I say often, I tend to do this anywhere

1:42:09.420 --> 1:42:13.480
 from three to four times a week, typically not every day.

1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:14.620
 Although there are people,

1:42:14.620 --> 1:42:16.460
 including people who are trying to offset

1:42:16.460 --> 1:42:17.800
 age-related cognitive decline

1:42:17.800 --> 1:42:20.700
 that will take 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC

1:42:20.700 --> 1:42:22.640
 three times a day every day,

1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:24.640
 which closely mimics some of the studies

1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:25.840
 that have been done on humans

1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:28.780
 looking at offsetting age-related cognitive decline

1:42:28.780 --> 1:42:31.420
 using things like Alpha-GPC.

1:42:31.420 --> 1:42:34.220
 I should point out that there have been a few studies,

1:42:34.220 --> 1:42:37.780
 a few, not many, but these studies emphasize

1:42:37.780 --> 1:42:40.940
 that people who take a lot of Alpha-GPC chronically

1:42:40.940 --> 1:42:44.020
 over time may be at increased risk for stroke.

1:42:44.020 --> 1:42:46.380
 I think the data are still out on that

1:42:46.380 --> 1:42:47.960
 and we need more data.

1:42:47.960 --> 1:42:49.860
 But for me, in terms of thinking about

1:42:49.860 --> 1:42:51.380
 the risk benefit profiles,

1:42:51.380 --> 1:42:53.880
 taking 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC

1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:55.980
 most certainly does increase my ability of focus.

1:42:55.980 --> 1:42:58.860
 I've noticed that I tend to take it alongside caffeine

1:42:58.860 --> 1:43:01.780
 and phenylethylamine, so I take that in combination

1:43:01.780 --> 1:43:03.440
 either before workouts or work bouts,

1:43:03.440 --> 1:43:04.780
 really sharpens my focus.

1:43:04.780 --> 1:43:07.460
 And again, I'm doing that three, maybe four times per week.

1:43:07.460 --> 1:43:09.980
 And I'm careful to do that in the early part of the day

1:43:09.980 --> 1:43:12.260
 so that it does not disrupt my sleep.

1:43:12.260 --> 1:43:14.540
 Although I have taken Alpha-GPC in the second half

1:43:14.540 --> 1:43:17.300
 of the day and I had no trouble sleeping at all.

1:43:17.300 --> 1:43:19.580
 I don't know what the exact half-life is

1:43:19.580 --> 1:43:22.460
 of the given form that's typically in supplementation.

1:43:22.460 --> 1:43:24.500
 It's actually hard to get that information,

1:43:24.500 --> 1:43:27.660
 but typically the focus effects wear off

1:43:27.660 --> 1:43:30.380
 after about two, maybe four hours maximum.

1:43:30.380 --> 1:43:31.660
 Now, one thing that I don't think

1:43:31.660 --> 1:43:33.140
 has ever been discussed before,

1:43:33.140 --> 1:43:34.780
 certainly not on this podcast,

1:43:34.780 --> 1:43:39.540
 is that if you take Alpha-GPC even semi-regularly,

1:43:39.540 --> 1:43:42.500
 you may notice that a particular feature

1:43:42.500 --> 1:43:44.180
 of your blood work will increase,

1:43:44.180 --> 1:43:47.480
 and that's TMAO, which is sometimes associated

1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:50.220
 with increased cardiovascular risk.

1:43:50.220 --> 1:43:53.900
 This may, again, may relate to some of the potential risk

1:43:53.900 --> 1:43:57.980
 of very high levels of Alpha-GPC ingestion over many years,

1:43:57.980 --> 1:43:59.700
 increasing stroke risk.

1:43:59.700 --> 1:44:00.820
 Again, those studies looked at people

1:44:00.820 --> 1:44:03.040
 who've been taking it for up to a decade.

1:44:03.040 --> 1:44:07.740
 But in any case, one way to prevent the increase in TMAO

1:44:07.740 --> 1:44:10.420
 if you're taking Alpha-GPC at all

1:44:10.420 --> 1:44:13.300
 is to take 600 milligrams of garlic

1:44:13.300 --> 1:44:15.820
 because it contains something called allicin.

1:44:15.820 --> 1:44:18.300
 This was a trick that was handed off to me

1:44:18.300 --> 1:44:19.780
 by Dr. Kyle Gillette,

1:44:19.780 --> 1:44:21.960
 who again was a guest on this podcast some time ago

1:44:21.960 --> 1:44:23.860
 talking about hormones and hormone health.

1:44:23.860 --> 1:44:27.180
 Turns out that ingestion of 600 milligrams of allicin

1:44:27.180 --> 1:44:30.280
 alongside or even just same day as Alpha-GPC

1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:33.020
 can really clamp those TMAO levels

1:44:33.020 --> 1:44:35.480
 that would otherwise increase if you're taking Alpha-GPC.

1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:37.140
 And indeed, I've done the blood work

1:44:37.140 --> 1:44:38.940
 and that turns out to be the case.

1:44:38.940 --> 1:44:40.300
 I saw a spike in TMAO.

1:44:40.300 --> 1:44:43.180
 I started taking 600 milligrams of garlic

1:44:43.180 --> 1:44:45.180
 and those TMAO levels came down.

1:44:45.180 --> 1:44:47.100
 And last as it relates to acetylcholine,

1:44:47.100 --> 1:44:49.060
 but certainly not least,

1:44:49.060 --> 1:44:51.740
 just as acetylcholine can increase focus,

1:44:51.740 --> 1:44:54.460
 focus can increase acetylcholine.

1:44:54.460 --> 1:44:57.380
 I talked a lot about this in the episode on focus,

1:44:57.380 --> 1:44:58.820
 but there are behavioral tools

1:44:58.820 --> 1:45:00.540
 that you can use to enhance focus.

1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:03.580
 Things like staring at a particular visual target

1:45:03.580 --> 1:45:05.180
 at the same distance at which

1:45:05.180 --> 1:45:06.540
 you're going to perform some work

1:45:06.540 --> 1:45:09.460
 and doing that for 30 to 60 seconds,

1:45:09.460 --> 1:45:11.880
 narrowing in a very deliberate way your visual field,

1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:14.760
 and then moving into a focused work bout.

1:45:14.760 --> 1:45:19.740
 That behavioral practice of narrowing your visual aperture

1:45:19.740 --> 1:45:22.400
 will increase the amount of acetylcholine transmission

1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:24.140
 in particular neural circuits

1:45:24.140 --> 1:45:25.900
 that will then make it easier to focus.

1:45:25.900 --> 1:45:26.780
 How do we know that?

1:45:26.780 --> 1:45:29.100
 Well, I covered in that episode

1:45:29.100 --> 1:45:30.620
 some of the peer-reviewed studies

1:45:30.620 --> 1:45:33.860
 that relate to protocols that are now actively being deployed

1:45:33.860 --> 1:45:36.340
 in schools in China and elsewhere,

1:45:36.340 --> 1:45:40.100
 where kids are doing deliberate visual focus exercises

1:45:40.100 --> 1:45:41.900
 in order to increase their mental focus.

1:45:41.900 --> 1:45:43.640
 And while they're not doing micro dialysis

1:45:43.640 --> 1:45:46.140
 or brain imaging on those kids in real time,

1:45:46.140 --> 1:45:49.900
 the cognitive effects and indeed the performance effects

1:45:49.900 --> 1:45:52.320
 in terms of academic ability and output

1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:53.500
 are pretty impressive.

1:45:53.500 --> 1:45:55.700
 So acetylcholine increases focus.

1:45:55.700 --> 1:45:58.160
 We talked about some dietary

1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:00.140
 and some supplementation based ways

1:46:00.140 --> 1:46:02.040
 to improve acetylcholine,

1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:04.020
 or I should say increase acetylcholine.

1:46:04.020 --> 1:46:06.980
 And that does in fact lead to increases

1:46:06.980 --> 1:46:08.900
 in one's ability to focus.

1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:11.260
 This is why a lot of the prescription drugs

1:46:11.260 --> 1:46:12.460
 for the treatment of Alzheimer's,

1:46:12.460 --> 1:46:14.380
 age-related cognitive decline,

1:46:14.380 --> 1:46:15.820
 and indeed even some of the drugs

1:46:15.820 --> 1:46:19.160
 that tap into treatments for ADHD

1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:21.560
 also involve the acetylcholine system.

1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:25.060
 So there's nothing surprising or heretical here,

1:46:25.060 --> 1:46:26.380
 but it is important to point out

1:46:26.380 --> 1:46:28.540
 that your behavioral ability to focus

1:46:28.540 --> 1:46:30.940
 is also related to your ability to access

1:46:30.940 --> 1:46:32.480
 and deploy acetylcholine.

1:46:32.480 --> 1:46:37.060
 So never do we want purely pharmacologic treatments

1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:40.180
 to be the only way that people are increasing

1:46:40.180 --> 1:46:41.380
 a given neuromodulator.

1:46:41.380 --> 1:46:43.840
 I always say behaviors first,

1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:46.580
 then nutrition, then supplementation.

1:46:46.580 --> 1:46:49.620
 And then if there's a need, certainly a clinical need,

1:46:49.620 --> 1:46:51.260
 then prescription drugs, et cetera,

1:46:51.260 --> 1:46:53.780
 of course administered through a physician.

1:46:53.780 --> 1:46:55.700
 So let's discuss serotonin.

1:46:55.700 --> 1:46:57.180
 Serotonin, as I mentioned earlier,

1:46:57.180 --> 1:46:59.620
 is associated with brain and body states

1:46:59.620 --> 1:47:03.020
 of wellbeing, of comfort, of satiety.

1:47:03.020 --> 1:47:04.780
 And therefore it should come as no surprise

1:47:04.780 --> 1:47:06.560
 that a lot of the prescription drug treatments

1:47:06.560 --> 1:47:08.020
 for things like depression

1:47:08.020 --> 1:47:10.540
 involve increasing levels of serotonin

1:47:10.540 --> 1:47:12.340
 in the brain and body.

1:47:12.340 --> 1:47:15.020
 That said, anytime you talk about prescription drugs

1:47:15.020 --> 1:47:17.740
 for serotonin, we also want to acknowledge

1:47:17.740 --> 1:47:19.460
 that there are often side effects

1:47:19.460 --> 1:47:21.220
 associated with increasing serotonin.

1:47:21.220 --> 1:47:23.780
 In particular, if serotonin levels go too high,

1:47:23.780 --> 1:47:26.540
 that is if the dosages of those treatments go too high,

1:47:26.540 --> 1:47:28.280
 people will, for instance,

1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:30.540
 feel reduced appetite, reduced libido,

1:47:30.540 --> 1:47:32.500
 increased lethargy, et cetera.

1:47:32.500 --> 1:47:35.060
 And there's a so-called serotonergic syndrome.

1:47:35.060 --> 1:47:37.820
 All of that can and should be considered

1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:40.260
 with a well-trained physician.

1:47:40.260 --> 1:47:41.980
 So because there are prescription drugs

1:47:41.980 --> 1:47:45.620
 controlling the dosage, deciding what dosage to take,

1:47:45.620 --> 1:47:48.520
 deciding which SSRI to take,

1:47:48.520 --> 1:47:50.160
 and whether or not to come off those drugs,

1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:51.180
 how to come off those drugs.

1:47:51.180 --> 1:47:52.720
 Again, all of that should be handled

1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:55.220
 with a licensed physician.

1:47:55.220 --> 1:47:58.780
 That said, there are behavioral tools,

1:47:58.780 --> 1:48:01.060
 nutritional tools, and supplementation tools

1:48:01.060 --> 1:48:03.120
 that can tap into the serotonin system,

1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:04.740
 not to the same degree in potency,

1:48:04.740 --> 1:48:07.700
 but nonetheless in ways that can still impact

1:48:07.700 --> 1:48:11.140
 our feelings of wellbeing in positive ways.

1:48:11.140 --> 1:48:14.140
 So let's focus first on the behavioral tools.

1:48:14.140 --> 1:48:16.640
 And some of these might make people chuckle a little bit,

1:48:16.640 --> 1:48:19.220
 but I want to point out that a lot of these tools

1:48:19.220 --> 1:48:20.300
 are quite potent.

1:48:20.300 --> 1:48:24.060
 In fact, they are power tools for modulating serotonin.

1:48:24.060 --> 1:48:27.000
 And we know that based on human neuroimaging studies,

1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:30.240
 human and animal micro dialysis studies,

1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:32.620
 and other studies that really have evaluated

1:48:32.620 --> 1:48:34.340
 circulating levels of serotonin

1:48:34.340 --> 1:48:37.220
 and the particular brain circuits that release serotonin

1:48:37.220 --> 1:48:39.120
 when people do certain things.

1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:40.380
 What sorts of things?

1:48:40.380 --> 1:48:43.340
 Well, for instance, physical contact,

1:48:43.340 --> 1:48:44.540
 in particular with loved ones,

1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:47.580
 this can be romantic love, this can be children,

1:48:47.580 --> 1:48:51.060
 so your own children, or your spouse,

1:48:51.060 --> 1:48:53.380
 even if it's not sexual contact,

1:48:53.380 --> 1:48:58.260
 friend to friend contact, even friend to animal contact.

1:48:58.260 --> 1:49:01.580
 As a former dog owner, I hope to have another dog soon

1:49:01.580 --> 1:49:03.340
 because unfortunately Costello passed away,

1:49:03.340 --> 1:49:05.580
 but there is something really comforting and wonderful

1:49:05.580 --> 1:49:06.680
 about petting your dog.

1:49:06.680 --> 1:49:10.580
 And certainly given that many of the studies on serotonin

1:49:10.580 --> 1:49:14.280
 and these other neuromodulators were done on animal models,

1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:17.600
 we also know that serotonin is being evoked in the dog

1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:19.020
 and of course in the child

1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:20.860
 and in the significant other, et cetera.

1:49:20.860 --> 1:49:23.420
 So things like holding hands, believe it or not,

1:49:23.420 --> 1:49:26.260
 hugs, cuddling, et cetera,

1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:28.340
 can increase serotonin transmission

1:49:28.340 --> 1:49:30.220
 and they make people feel good.

1:49:30.220 --> 1:49:32.180
 This shouldn't really come as a surprise.

1:49:32.180 --> 1:49:33.420
 There's also gratitude.

1:49:33.420 --> 1:49:35.620
 And we did an entire episode about gratitude.

1:49:35.620 --> 1:49:38.060
 There's a lot of misunderstanding about gratitude.

1:49:38.060 --> 1:49:40.300
 Oftentimes when people hear gratitude, they think,

1:49:40.300 --> 1:49:42.840
 oh, gratitude, this is just being thankful for what you have

1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:44.900
 and it's kind of a weak sauce effect,

1:49:44.900 --> 1:49:48.780
 meaning it's kind of like maybe a little serotonin goes up

1:49:48.780 --> 1:49:50.720
 or maybe there's a little bit of increased feelings

1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:51.900
 of wellbeing.

1:49:51.900 --> 1:49:53.420
 Nothing could be further from the truth.

1:49:53.420 --> 1:49:55.140
 It turns out, first of all,

1:49:55.140 --> 1:49:57.960
 that receiving, not giving gratitude,

1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:00.900
 is what has the most potent effects on increasing serotonin

1:50:00.900 --> 1:50:03.980
 and activity of the brain circuits that involve serotonin

1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:06.740
 and that lead to increases in feelings of wellbeing.

1:50:06.740 --> 1:50:08.140
 So this is interesting.

1:50:08.140 --> 1:50:12.300
 Receiving much more than giving gratitude

1:50:12.300 --> 1:50:14.800
 is what activates those serotonergic pathways.

1:50:14.800 --> 1:50:18.740
 So the takeaway from that is both give and receive gratitude

1:50:18.740 --> 1:50:20.700
 and of course do it in an authentic way.

1:50:20.700 --> 1:50:21.860
 The other thing about gratitude

1:50:21.860 --> 1:50:23.140
 that's somewhat counterintuitive

1:50:23.140 --> 1:50:27.240
 is that observing others giving and receiving gratitude

1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:30.460
 is immensely powerful for evoking serotonin

1:50:30.460 --> 1:50:33.620
 and the activity of serotonergic circuits in you,

1:50:33.620 --> 1:50:34.460
 the observer.

1:50:34.460 --> 1:50:36.900
 So receiving and observing gratitude

1:50:36.900 --> 1:50:38.780
 turns out to be the most potent way

1:50:38.780 --> 1:50:41.660
 to increase serotonin in the brain and body.

1:50:41.660 --> 1:50:43.380
 And these, again, are dramatic effects

1:50:43.380 --> 1:50:46.240
 that are quite long lasting and not the sorts of effects

1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:47.480
 that are going to lead to side effects,

1:50:47.480 --> 1:50:49.860
 at least there's no reason to think they would.

1:50:49.860 --> 1:50:52.740
 Now, what about nutritional approaches

1:50:52.740 --> 1:50:54.080
 to increasing serotonin?

1:50:54.080 --> 1:50:57.580
 Well, just as we have tyrosine as an amino acid precursor

1:50:57.580 --> 1:50:59.820
 upstream of dopamine synthesis,

1:51:00.780 --> 1:51:04.340
 we have the amino acid tryptophan,

1:51:04.340 --> 1:51:07.380
 which is upstream of serotonin synthesis.

1:51:07.380 --> 1:51:09.580
 And one simply has to go online

1:51:09.580 --> 1:51:12.000
 and put in tryptophan-containing foods

1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:13.700
 and you will discover that there are a lot of foods

1:51:13.700 --> 1:51:15.340
 that are enriched in tryptophan

1:51:15.340 --> 1:51:18.940
 that can lead to net increases in the amount of serotonin

1:51:18.940 --> 1:51:20.580
 available in the brain and body.

1:51:20.580 --> 1:51:23.020
 The most kind of famous or infamous of these

1:51:23.020 --> 1:51:25.900
 is white meat turkey, the so-called tryptophan effect,

1:51:25.900 --> 1:51:28.340
 where people get very sleepy after eating white meat turkey

1:51:28.340 --> 1:51:31.420
 and it is indeed highly enriched in tryptophan.

1:51:31.420 --> 1:51:33.660
 Although typically the getting sleepy after eating turkey

1:51:33.660 --> 1:51:36.740
 is most often associated with the Thanksgiving meal

1:51:36.740 --> 1:51:38.500
 and the Thanksgiving meal, at least in the US,

1:51:38.500 --> 1:51:40.860
 is often associated with people vastly overeating.

1:51:40.860 --> 1:51:42.180
 And so I do want to point out

1:51:42.180 --> 1:51:44.220
 that if you fill your gut with food,

1:51:44.220 --> 1:51:46.120
 no matter what that food is,

1:51:46.120 --> 1:51:47.900
 there's going to be a diversion of blood to your gut

1:51:47.900 --> 1:51:49.060
 that's going to make you feel sleepy

1:51:49.060 --> 1:51:51.840
 because there's a diversion of blood away from other tissues.

1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:53.740
 So if you eat a lot, you're going to get sleepy, period,

1:51:53.740 --> 1:51:56.180
 whether or not you eat turkey or some other substance.

1:51:56.180 --> 1:51:57.900
 Nonetheless, there are a number of foods

1:51:57.900 --> 1:52:00.180
 that contain a lot of tryptophan

1:52:00.180 --> 1:52:02.740
 and that some people will leverage

1:52:02.740 --> 1:52:04.700
 in order to try and increase

1:52:04.700 --> 1:52:07.500
 the total amount of circulating serotonin available to them

1:52:07.500 --> 1:52:10.480
 in order to have a modest increase

1:52:10.480 --> 1:52:12.220
 in overall mood and wellbeing.

1:52:12.220 --> 1:52:13.540
 So what are some of these foods?

1:52:13.540 --> 1:52:16.700
 These are things like milk, in particular, whole milk,

1:52:16.700 --> 1:52:18.260
 so full fat milk.

1:52:18.260 --> 1:52:20.660
 I know a number of people choose not to drink milk

1:52:20.660 --> 1:52:22.500
 because they're lactose intolerant.

1:52:22.500 --> 1:52:24.460
 I'm raising my hand because I'm one such person.

1:52:24.460 --> 1:52:28.260
 Although when I was a kid, I did enjoy milk.

1:52:28.260 --> 1:52:31.220
 Canned tuna, turkey, as we mentioned before,

1:52:31.220 --> 1:52:32.940
 high in tryptophan, oats.

1:52:32.940 --> 1:52:35.980
 I am a consumer of oatmeal, so that resonates with me.

1:52:35.980 --> 1:52:38.000
 Cheese, and here I read,

1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:39.380
 although not as high in tryptophan

1:52:39.380 --> 1:52:42.100
 as meat and other dairy sources,

1:52:42.100 --> 1:52:43.500
 certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses

1:52:43.500 --> 1:52:45.180
 can be rich in tryptophan.

1:52:45.180 --> 1:52:48.240
 Certain nuts and seeds, certain breads.

1:52:48.240 --> 1:52:50.060
 Chocolate, I know a number of people

1:52:50.060 --> 1:52:51.440
 will be relieved to hear that.

1:52:51.440 --> 1:52:53.500
 I know chocolate lovers are always looking

1:52:53.500 --> 1:52:55.020
 for an excuse to eat chocolate.

1:52:55.020 --> 1:52:56.660
 I confess I've never really liked chocolate,

1:52:56.660 --> 1:53:00.340
 except, dare I say, I like the smooth 100% chocolates.

1:53:00.340 --> 1:53:02.500
 I know many people gag when they hear 100%.

1:53:02.500 --> 1:53:03.500
 I actually really liked them.

1:53:03.500 --> 1:53:06.040
 And some fruits can be highly enriched in tryptophan.

1:53:06.040 --> 1:53:09.340
 Things like bananas and apples and things of that sort,

1:53:09.340 --> 1:53:12.300
 although not nearly to the degree of things

1:53:12.300 --> 1:53:14.800
 like turkey, canned tuna, and milk.

1:53:14.800 --> 1:53:17.640
 I'm sure there are other excellent sources of tryptophan

1:53:17.640 --> 1:53:20.220
 from the diet, including vegan sources.

1:53:20.220 --> 1:53:23.020
 So please peruse the internet to try and find the sources

1:53:23.020 --> 1:53:25.780
 that are compatible with your nutritional program,

1:53:25.780 --> 1:53:28.700
 if indeed your goal is to increase tryptophan.

1:53:28.700 --> 1:53:31.040
 Now, there are supplements that can increase tryptophan

1:53:31.040 --> 1:53:33.580
 and can do so quite potently.

1:53:33.580 --> 1:53:36.980
 One of the ones that has received increasing attention

1:53:36.980 --> 1:53:41.900
 as of lately is Sissus quadranglearis, complicated name.

1:53:41.900 --> 1:53:45.680
 When taken in dosages of about 300 to 600 milligrams

1:53:45.680 --> 1:53:49.540
 can pretty dramatically increase serotonin levels.

1:53:49.540 --> 1:53:53.780
 In fact, anywhere from 30% to 39% increases

1:53:53.780 --> 1:53:57.780
 in circulating serotonin, that's a big increase.

1:53:57.780 --> 1:53:59.780
 And I can provide a link to that study.

1:53:59.780 --> 1:54:02.700
 The study was focused not so much on serotonin,

1:54:02.700 --> 1:54:06.060
 but was focused mainly on treatment of obesity

1:54:06.060 --> 1:54:07.900
 and appetite and weight loss.

1:54:07.900 --> 1:54:11.340
 And it should come as no surprise that serotonin,

1:54:11.340 --> 1:54:15.060
 if increased, might lead to decreases in appetite.

1:54:15.060 --> 1:54:18.700
 A cautionary note, Sissus quadranglearis

1:54:18.700 --> 1:54:20.020
 may need to be cycled.

1:54:20.980 --> 1:54:22.360
 How quickly to cycle it,

1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:25.140
 meaning do you do two weeks on, two weeks off,

1:54:25.140 --> 1:54:27.540
 whether or not you need to do more rapid cycling,

1:54:27.540 --> 1:54:30.420
 like two days on, two days off, is a matter of debate.

1:54:30.420 --> 1:54:33.220
 There are not a lot of data on this just yet.

1:54:33.220 --> 1:54:35.240
 There are a lot of opinions about this on the internet,

1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:37.900
 but again, not a lot of quality peer review data.

1:54:37.900 --> 1:54:40.260
 Nonetheless, Sissus quadranglearis has been shown

1:54:40.260 --> 1:54:42.820
 to importantly increase serotonin in humans.

1:54:42.820 --> 1:54:45.560
 And for people that are seeking to increase serotonin,

1:54:45.560 --> 1:54:49.180
 maybe in particular, for sake of appetite and weight control,

1:54:49.180 --> 1:54:51.080
 that might be a useful compound.

1:54:51.080 --> 1:54:53.500
 I know many people also take 5-HTP,

1:54:53.500 --> 1:54:56.040
 one of the precursors to serotonin,

1:54:56.040 --> 1:54:58.980
 in dosages of anywhere from 300 to 500 milligrams.

1:54:58.980 --> 1:55:02.240
 Typically, people are doing this in anticipation of sleep,

1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:04.380
 meaning in the final hour of wakefulness

1:55:04.380 --> 1:55:06.220
 before going to sleep.

1:55:06.220 --> 1:55:08.940
 I myself have tried 5-HTP prior to sleep,

1:55:08.940 --> 1:55:11.520
 and all I can tell you is that it led to very deep sleep

1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:12.740
 for about one to three hours,

1:55:12.740 --> 1:55:15.100
 and then I woke up and I could not fall back asleep.

1:55:15.100 --> 1:55:16.860
 I ran that experiment twice

1:55:16.860 --> 1:55:19.680
 before I decided to abandon 5-HTP as a sleep aid,

1:55:19.680 --> 1:55:22.700
 and that's why I've never put it into our sleep kit,

1:55:22.700 --> 1:55:24.860
 or at least my sleep kit.

1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:26.740
 And when I refer to the sleep kit,

1:55:26.740 --> 1:55:28.740
 that's something you can find at HubermanLab.com.

1:55:28.740 --> 1:55:30.160
 This is a zero-cost resource

1:55:30.160 --> 1:55:32.100
 where you can see behavioral tools

1:55:32.100 --> 1:55:34.560
 and also supplementation tools

1:55:34.560 --> 1:55:36.940
 that can improve the transition time into

1:55:36.940 --> 1:55:38.020
 and the depth of sleep,

1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:41.580
 and none of those rely on 5-HTP supplementation.

1:55:41.580 --> 1:55:43.220
 That said, I know a number of people

1:55:43.220 --> 1:55:47.180
 use 5-HTP supplementation outside of sleep,

1:55:47.180 --> 1:55:48.460
 or I should say during the daytime,

1:55:48.460 --> 1:55:50.020
 to try and increase serotonin,

1:55:50.020 --> 1:55:52.940
 and it will indeed increase circulating serotonin.

1:55:52.940 --> 1:55:55.500
 But again, people vary in their sensitivity

1:55:55.500 --> 1:55:57.040
 to these sorts of things.

1:55:57.040 --> 1:55:58.420
 Some people might find, for instance,

1:55:58.420 --> 1:56:01.760
 that 300 milligrams of 5-HTP is just far too much.

1:56:01.760 --> 1:56:04.800
 It blunts their appetite, might even reduce libido.

1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:06.740
 There aren't a lot of very well-controlled studies

1:56:06.740 --> 1:56:07.580
 looking at this,

1:56:07.580 --> 1:56:10.220
 and so it has to be figured out on an individual basis

1:56:10.220 --> 1:56:12.360
 if you decide to approach it at all.

1:56:12.360 --> 1:56:13.860
 Now, one molecule that I've found

1:56:13.860 --> 1:56:16.180
 to be particularly interesting and useful,

1:56:16.180 --> 1:56:18.220
 and this is one that I haven't talked about yet

1:56:18.220 --> 1:56:23.140
 on this podcast, is inositol, in particular, myoinositol.

1:56:23.140 --> 1:56:27.180
 Myoinositol can have the effect of increasing serotonin

1:56:27.180 --> 1:56:29.780
 and other neurochemicals,

1:56:29.780 --> 1:56:32.540
 but primarily, at least in terms of the neuromodulators

1:56:32.540 --> 1:56:34.620
 discussed today, serotonin.

1:56:34.620 --> 1:56:37.980
 I've been taking 900 milligrams of myoinositol

1:56:37.980 --> 1:56:39.380
 every third night or so

1:56:39.380 --> 1:56:41.580
 as a test of its ability to improve sleep,

1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:44.540
 and I have to say, the depth and quality of sleep

1:56:44.540 --> 1:56:47.580
 that I've been obtaining on myoinositol

1:56:47.580 --> 1:56:49.260
 is pretty remarkable.

1:56:49.260 --> 1:56:50.940
 In fact, I've used it alone,

1:56:50.940 --> 1:56:53.540
 and in combination with the magnesium-3-N-8

1:56:53.540 --> 1:56:56.180
 apigenin-theanine sleep kit that I've talked about,

1:56:56.180 --> 1:56:59.160
 and that's included in that, again, zero-cost kit

1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:01.340
 that's available as a PDF on our website.

1:57:01.340 --> 1:57:04.200
 So myoinositol is known to increase circulating levels

1:57:04.200 --> 1:57:05.380
 of serotonin.

1:57:05.380 --> 1:57:09.140
 It has been explored extensively in both animal models

1:57:09.140 --> 1:57:13.300
 and in humans for its daytime use for treating anxiety.

1:57:13.300 --> 1:57:15.380
 It does seem to reduce anxiety,

1:57:15.380 --> 1:57:17.260
 and for all sorts of things.

1:57:17.260 --> 1:57:19.460
 It's been explored for bipolar disorder.

1:57:19.460 --> 1:57:20.420
 We're going to do an episode

1:57:20.420 --> 1:57:22.900
 about bipolar disorder coming up.

1:57:22.900 --> 1:57:25.100
 It's been explored for the treatment of migraine.

1:57:25.100 --> 1:57:27.000
 It's been explored for ADHD.

1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.060
 It's been explored for a huge number

1:57:29.060 --> 1:57:31.300
 of different conditions of brain and body.

1:57:31.300 --> 1:57:34.980
 Again, I've been using the 900 milligrams of myoinositol

1:57:34.980 --> 1:57:38.100
 in the 30 to 60 minutes before sleep to improve my sleep,

1:57:38.100 --> 1:57:40.180
 and it has been doing that very dramatically,

1:57:40.180 --> 1:57:43.140
 especially when I take it alongside the rest

1:57:43.140 --> 1:57:45.300
 of those sleep kit supplements.

1:57:45.300 --> 1:57:47.020
 A quick note about myoinositol

1:57:47.020 --> 1:57:49.360
 for sake of increasing serotonin.

1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:52.020
 If you look at the human studies on myoinositol

1:57:52.020 --> 1:57:53.060
 that are out there,

1:57:53.060 --> 1:57:55.420
 and in particular focus on the human studies,

1:57:55.420 --> 1:57:58.100
 what you'll find is that the dosages that are often used

1:57:58.100 --> 1:57:59.420
 are tremendously high.

1:57:59.420 --> 1:58:01.480
 It's like five grams, eight grams,

1:58:01.480 --> 1:58:05.300
 18 grams of myoinositol taken throughout the day.

1:58:05.300 --> 1:58:06.920
 I don't know how people stomach that,

1:58:06.920 --> 1:58:09.100
 and in fact, many people drop out of those studies

1:58:09.100 --> 1:58:10.860
 because of gastric discomfort,

1:58:11.880 --> 1:58:14.440
 and yet I also wonder how people tolerate it

1:58:14.440 --> 1:58:16.420
 because it has somewhat of a sedative effect,

1:58:16.420 --> 1:58:18.500
 and it's kind of anti-anxiety effect,

1:58:18.500 --> 1:58:20.260
 and I can't even imagine,

1:58:20.260 --> 1:58:22.420
 given my experience with 900 milligrams,

1:58:22.420 --> 1:58:25.260
 what one would experience taking multiple

1:58:25.260 --> 1:58:27.540
 or many more grams per day.

1:58:27.540 --> 1:58:30.460
 So I certainly am not encouraging that,

1:58:30.460 --> 1:58:32.820
 and the only reason I mentioned myoinositol

1:58:32.820 --> 1:58:35.520
 is that it has a known effect of increasing serotonin.

1:58:36.460 --> 1:58:38.020
 At least in my experience,

1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:40.340
 it does not lead to this falling deeply asleep

1:58:40.340 --> 1:58:41.380
 and waking back up.

1:58:41.380 --> 1:58:42.380
 Actually to the contrary,

1:58:42.380 --> 1:58:44.380
 if I wake up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom

1:58:44.380 --> 1:58:45.500
 or I wake up in the middle of the night

1:58:45.500 --> 1:58:47.020
 for whatever other reason,

1:58:47.020 --> 1:58:49.780
 I find it far easier to fall back asleep

1:58:49.780 --> 1:58:53.940
 if I've taken 900 milligrams inositol prior to sleep.

1:58:53.940 --> 1:58:56.960
 So for me, it's proving to be a quite useful compound.

1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:00.700
 I'm not aware of having any serotonergic deficiency overall.

1:59:00.700 --> 1:59:02.560
 I don't consider myself depressed.

1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:05.540
 And of course, I should mention that no supplement,

1:59:05.540 --> 1:59:08.220
 either added or withdrawn from your protocol,

1:59:08.220 --> 1:59:11.300
 should ever be used as a direct replacement

1:59:11.300 --> 1:59:12.620
 for prescription drug treatments

1:59:12.620 --> 1:59:13.660
 that your physician has given you.

1:59:13.660 --> 1:59:15.000
 You should always talk to your physician

1:59:15.000 --> 1:59:18.780
 anytime you remove or add something to your drug protocol

1:59:18.780 --> 1:59:20.700
 or prescription protocol, of course.

1:59:20.700 --> 1:59:23.300
 So we've got behavioral protocols that,

1:59:23.300 --> 1:59:25.740
 as silly as it feels to say,

1:59:25.740 --> 1:59:27.820
 have been shown to potently increase serotonin,

1:59:27.820 --> 1:59:30.540
 things like physical contact, cuddling, holding hands

1:59:30.540 --> 1:59:32.860
 with people that you love, of course, right?

1:59:32.860 --> 1:59:35.380
 I think if there were people that you despised,

1:59:35.380 --> 1:59:38.380
 it would have the opposite effect for obvious reasons,

1:59:38.380 --> 1:59:42.100
 but also receiving gratitude and observing gratitude,

1:59:42.100 --> 1:59:44.240
 very potent increases in serotonin.

1:59:44.240 --> 1:59:47.180
 And things like cystis quadrangularis,

1:59:47.180 --> 1:59:50.060
 things like 5-HTP may have their uses, right?

1:59:50.060 --> 1:59:53.220
 They're very potent at increasing serotonin,

1:59:53.220 --> 1:59:56.140
 but they do seem to have the need to cycle them

1:59:56.140 --> 1:59:57.580
 and they are nuanced.

1:59:57.580 --> 1:59:58.860
 Some people respond well to them.

1:59:58.860 --> 2:00:00.860
 Others, like myself, don't.

2:00:00.860 --> 2:00:03.840
 And of course, always be on the lookout for dramatic

2:00:03.840 --> 2:00:06.260
 or even subtle decreases in appetite or libido

2:00:06.260 --> 2:00:08.260
 or things that you might not want

2:00:08.260 --> 2:00:10.060
 if you are going to be tinkering

2:00:10.060 --> 2:00:13.260
 with your serotonergic levels and pathways.

2:00:13.260 --> 2:00:15.640
 And then myoinositol actually is proving

2:00:15.640 --> 2:00:17.660
 to be quite useful to me.

2:00:17.660 --> 2:00:20.300
 And whether or not that's because of its effects

2:00:20.300 --> 2:00:22.820
 on serotonin or through some of its other effects

2:00:22.820 --> 2:00:24.740
 on maybe reducing anxiety,

2:00:24.740 --> 2:00:25.820
 which certainly I experience

2:00:25.820 --> 2:00:26.780
 if I wake up in the middle of the night,

2:00:26.780 --> 2:00:28.340
 I don't like waking up in the middle of the night,

2:00:28.340 --> 2:00:30.780
 but on myoinositol, I sort of seem to not really care

2:00:30.780 --> 2:00:32.480
 that I woke up and I fall right back asleep.

2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:34.660
 So the direct source of the positive effects

2:00:34.660 --> 2:00:36.060
 that I'm getting aren't clear,

2:00:36.060 --> 2:00:37.780
 but nonetheless, I thought I'd pass it along

2:00:37.780 --> 2:00:40.500
 as a useful tool because it is out there

2:00:40.500 --> 2:00:42.740
 and it is available over the counter

2:00:42.740 --> 2:00:45.180
 and provided you're taking the appropriate safety steps

2:00:45.180 --> 2:00:47.820
 in considering whether or not to use it or not,

2:00:47.820 --> 2:00:49.900
 I think it might be a useful tool.

2:00:49.900 --> 2:00:52.660
 And of course, as with all the other neuromodulators

2:00:52.660 --> 2:00:56.740
 we discussed, you have both a baseline of serotonin

2:00:56.740 --> 2:00:59.820
 and the ability to give or provide yourself peaks

2:00:59.820 --> 2:01:02.180
 of serotonin through these various protocols.

2:01:02.180 --> 2:01:05.580
 The dietary interventions of the sort that I mentioned,

2:01:05.580 --> 2:01:08.460
 meaning eating foods that are enriched in tryptophan,

2:01:08.460 --> 2:01:10.420
 those are mainly going to adjust

2:01:10.420 --> 2:01:12.780
 your baseline levels of tryptophan.

2:01:12.780 --> 2:01:15.180
 For instance, if you really want to be sleepy,

2:01:15.180 --> 2:01:17.140
 sure, you could eat some white meat turkey

2:01:17.140 --> 2:01:20.140
 in hopes that that tryptophan will convert to serotonin

2:01:20.140 --> 2:01:21.800
 and make you sleepy, et cetera.

2:01:21.800 --> 2:01:23.100
 But in general, those are going to be

2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:24.900
 pretty long lasting effects,

2:01:24.900 --> 2:01:25.900
 especially given the fact

2:01:25.900 --> 2:01:28.180
 that not all of the tryptophan you will ingest

2:01:28.180 --> 2:01:31.540
 is going to be converted into serotonin in your brain.

2:01:31.540 --> 2:01:32.740
 It's going to have other effects

2:01:32.740 --> 2:01:35.020
 on other tissues and organs of your body.

2:01:35.020 --> 2:01:37.460
 Nonetheless, if you want to increase serotonin,

2:01:37.460 --> 2:01:40.300
 providing the appropriate baseline context

2:01:40.300 --> 2:01:41.500
 is going to be useful.

2:01:41.500 --> 2:01:43.260
 And again, this is a general theme

2:01:43.260 --> 2:01:45.500
 of all four of these neuromodulators,

2:01:45.500 --> 2:01:48.360
 dopamine, epinephrine, acetylcholine, and serotonin.

2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:49.700
 You want to make sure

2:01:49.700 --> 2:01:52.920
 that you have sufficient baseline levels of those things

2:01:52.920 --> 2:01:55.940
 through things like diet, regular behaviors,

2:01:55.940 --> 2:01:59.400
 and then you have the opportunity to use supplementation,

2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:00.500
 and if it's appropriate for you,

2:02:00.500 --> 2:02:03.320
 prescription drugs and certain behavioral protocols

2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:05.140
 to try and get these potent increases,

2:02:05.140 --> 2:02:08.420
 these acute increases in whichever the neuromodulators

2:02:08.420 --> 2:02:11.860
 you happen to want to leverage for your particular goals.

2:02:11.860 --> 2:02:13.240
 So that brings us to the end

2:02:13.240 --> 2:02:16.500
 of at least this exploration of the neuromodulators,

2:02:16.500 --> 2:02:20.100
 dopamine, epinephrine, acetylcholine, and serotonin.

2:02:20.100 --> 2:02:22.320
 Some of you who are regular listeners of this podcast

2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:24.560
 might be saying, well, we've heard all this before, right?

2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:25.800
 You had an episode on dopamine.

2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:27.180
 You had an episode on anxiety.

2:02:27.180 --> 2:02:28.460
 You had an episode on sleep.

2:02:28.460 --> 2:02:30.440
 And indeed that's true.

2:02:30.440 --> 2:02:33.720
 But what I've tried to provide today is a framework

2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:36.260
 that cuts through all those episodes

2:02:36.260 --> 2:02:38.700
 and at the same time builds out a new

2:02:38.700 --> 2:02:41.100
 and what I believe to be a really important theme

2:02:41.100 --> 2:02:44.060
 and principle, which is that whether or not

2:02:44.060 --> 2:02:47.420
 you're using nutritional tools or supplementation

2:02:47.420 --> 2:02:51.360
 or prescription drugs or any other sort of protocol

2:02:51.360 --> 2:02:55.300
 to try and create a desired effect of focus or energy,

2:02:55.300 --> 2:02:57.640
 motivation, relaxation,

2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:01.920
 you're playing with the same neurochemical ingredients,

2:03:01.920 --> 2:03:05.540
 just as in the realm of nutrition, you have macronutrients,

2:03:05.540 --> 2:03:08.020
 you have proteins, carbohydrates, and fats

2:03:08.020 --> 2:03:09.860
 that can be adjusted in different ratios

2:03:09.860 --> 2:03:11.900
 and arranged at different times

2:03:11.900 --> 2:03:14.700
 in order to achieve certain desired effects.

2:03:14.700 --> 2:03:17.140
 Well, when it comes to your neurochemistry

2:03:17.140 --> 2:03:19.140
 and your ability to perform mentally,

2:03:19.140 --> 2:03:22.980
 to perform physically, and your overall wellbeing,

2:03:23.860 --> 2:03:26.300
 you are dealing with a small handful

2:03:26.300 --> 2:03:28.460
 of especially potent molecules.

2:03:28.460 --> 2:03:31.900
 And I acknowledge that there are many neuromodulators,

2:03:31.900 --> 2:03:33.780
 there are indeed many neurotransmitters,

2:03:33.780 --> 2:03:36.260
 glutamine, glycine, GABA, et cetera.

2:03:36.260 --> 2:03:38.600
 But today we focused on the main four,

2:03:38.600 --> 2:03:43.400
 meaning the most potent and most widespread neuromodulators

2:03:43.400 --> 2:03:46.660
 in the brain and body that give you access

2:03:46.660 --> 2:03:49.660
 to particular brain states and body states

2:03:49.660 --> 2:03:51.900
 of the sort that most people desire.

2:03:51.900 --> 2:03:54.940
 So what I'm hoping is that rather than decide

2:03:54.940 --> 2:03:56.980
 that any one tool is the most useful

2:03:56.980 --> 2:04:00.140
 or that any one neurochemical is most useful

2:04:00.140 --> 2:04:02.260
 for that matter, that the information

2:04:02.260 --> 2:04:07.140
 that I've provided today allows you a kit of versatile tools

2:04:07.140 --> 2:04:11.100
 that allows you to figure out what levels of dopamine

2:04:11.100 --> 2:04:13.660
 and augmentation of dopamine are appropriate

2:04:13.660 --> 2:04:14.980
 and necessary for you.

2:04:14.980 --> 2:04:17.620
 What levels of acetylcholine

2:04:17.620 --> 2:04:20.120
 and tools for manipulating acetylcholine

2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:21.540
 are going to be most useful for you,

2:04:21.540 --> 2:04:23.140
 and so on and so forth.

2:04:23.140 --> 2:04:26.700
 Because at least at this stage in time,

2:04:26.700 --> 2:04:31.700
 that is June, 2022, there is no simple at-home test.

2:04:32.180 --> 2:04:34.820
 In fact, there is no simple laboratory test

2:04:34.820 --> 2:04:36.360
 that allows us to know whether or not

2:04:36.360 --> 2:04:37.600
 our dopamine levels are high

2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:39.220
 and our serotonin levels are low.

2:04:39.220 --> 2:04:41.180
 We can look at somebody and their behavior.

2:04:41.180 --> 2:04:44.020
 We can look at ourselves and our own mood and behavior,

2:04:44.020 --> 2:04:48.720
 and we can infer what those levels may or may not be.

2:04:48.720 --> 2:04:53.020
 But unfortunately, we don't have a really good test

2:04:53.020 --> 2:04:55.180
 of dopamine levels or serotonin levels

2:04:55.180 --> 2:04:58.460
 that would allow us to say, okay, this person

2:04:58.460 --> 2:05:01.860
 or I need to increase dopamine twofold

2:05:01.860 --> 2:05:04.820
 in order to achieve the kind of motivation that we want.

2:05:04.820 --> 2:05:07.060
 Unfortunately, that doesn't exist.

2:05:07.060 --> 2:05:09.000
 Rather, we are confronted with a situation

2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:11.400
 where we understand generally

2:05:11.400 --> 2:05:12.940
 what these different neuromodulators do,

2:05:12.940 --> 2:05:14.940
 the different mental states and physical states

2:05:14.940 --> 2:05:17.820
 that they tend to put us into, and we reviewed those.

2:05:17.820 --> 2:05:21.740
 And we know that there are really potent tools

2:05:21.740 --> 2:05:25.100
 to adjust those neuromodulators, if not alone,

2:05:25.100 --> 2:05:26.900
 but in certain combinations.

2:05:26.900 --> 2:05:30.320
 That is, ingestion of caffeine will tap into

2:05:30.320 --> 2:05:33.720
 and support dopamine and epinephrine.

2:05:33.720 --> 2:05:36.140
 Increasing dopamine and epinephrine

2:05:36.140 --> 2:05:39.340
 alongside increasing acetylcholine

2:05:39.340 --> 2:05:41.500
 will allow us to access certain brain states.

2:05:41.500 --> 2:05:44.660
 That is focused, alert, energized brain states,

2:05:44.660 --> 2:05:47.780
 great for learning and plasticity of all kinds,

2:05:47.780 --> 2:05:50.560
 whereas augmenting serotonin is going to put us

2:05:50.560 --> 2:05:53.060
 into a more relaxed state and so on and so forth.

2:05:53.060 --> 2:05:54.640
 And I'd like you to keep in mind

2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:57.780
 that there is no negotiating the fact

2:05:57.780 --> 2:06:01.000
 that we all have different phases of our 24-hour cycle

2:06:01.000 --> 2:06:03.260
 during which those very same neuromodulators

2:06:03.260 --> 2:06:05.840
 tend to be naturally higher or naturally lower.

2:06:05.840 --> 2:06:08.140
 And I reviewed that at the beginning of the episode.

2:06:08.140 --> 2:06:11.060
 So my wish for you is that you will take this information,

2:06:11.060 --> 2:06:15.380
 experiment with it as you see fit for you and in a safe way,

2:06:15.380 --> 2:06:19.600
 and as you go forward to really try and gain intuition

2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:23.400
 and understanding as to not just how these protocols work,

2:06:23.400 --> 2:06:26.140
 but how any protocol that you might encounter,

2:06:26.140 --> 2:06:29.660
 supplement-based, drug-based, behavioral-based,

2:06:29.660 --> 2:06:30.780
 how those might tap into

2:06:30.780 --> 2:06:32.840
 these different major neuromodulator systems,

2:06:32.840 --> 2:06:36.180
 and from that, to be able to better predict and evaluate

2:06:36.180 --> 2:06:37.920
 whether or not they're going to be useful to you,

2:06:37.920 --> 2:06:39.060
 detrimental to you,

2:06:39.060 --> 2:06:41.240
 or whether or not they should be used in combinations

2:06:41.240 --> 2:06:42.780
 that would be more useful to you.

2:06:42.780 --> 2:06:45.120

 That's the best way to support this podcast.

2:07:17.060 --> 2:07:19.740
 During today's episode, we talked a lot about supplements.

2:07:19.740 --> 2:07:22.000
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.460
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them.

2:07:24.460 --> 2:07:26.300
 As mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,

2:07:26.300 --> 2:07:28.380
 we partnered with Momentous Supplements

2:07:28.380 --> 2:07:29.920
 because they're extremely high quality,

2:07:29.920 --> 2:07:31.700
 they ship internationally,

2:07:31.700 --> 2:07:33.580
 they are available in the dosages

2:07:33.580 --> 2:07:35.900
 and single ingredient formulations

2:07:35.900 --> 2:07:38.220
 that are ideal for building a supplementation protocol.

2:07:38.220 --> 2:07:41.820
 You can find all those at livemomentous.com slash Huberman.

2:07:41.820 --> 2:07:44.060
 If you're not already following us on social media,

2:07:44.060 --> 2:07:48.460
 we are Huberman Lab on Twitter and Huberman Lab on Instagram.

2:07:48.460 --> 2:07:50.820
 There, I cover science and science-based tools,

2:07:50.820 --> 2:07:52.460
 some of which overlap with the content

2:07:52.460 --> 2:07:54.100
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:07:54.100 --> 2:07:55.420
 but much of which is distinct

2:07:55.420 --> 2:07:57.820
 from the content of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:07:57.820 --> 2:07:59.980
 And if you're not already subscribing to our newsletter,

2:07:59.980 --> 2:08:02.500
 we have a neural network newsletter, as it's called.

2:08:02.500 --> 2:08:04.580
 It comes out about once a month.

2:08:04.580 --> 2:08:06.260
 We provide summaries,

2:08:06.260 --> 2:08:09.420
 we provide protocols based on podcast episodes.

2:08:09.420 --> 2:08:11.140
 All of that is zero cost to access.

2:08:11.140 --> 2:08:13.860
 You just go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,

2:08:13.860 --> 2:08:15.580
 click on newsletter, and you can sign up.

2:08:15.580 --> 2:08:17.620
 We do not share your email with anybody

2:08:17.620 --> 2:08:19.740
 and our privacy policy is there.

2:08:19.740 --> 2:08:22.060
 In fact, if you want to see previous newsletters,

2:08:22.060 --> 2:08:25.620
 they are available without having to sign up in PDF form,

2:08:25.620 --> 2:08:28.560
 also at HubermanLab.com under the newsletter tabs,

2:08:28.560 --> 2:08:30.260
 things like a toolkit for sleep

2:08:30.260 --> 2:08:32.300
 and a neuroplasticity super protocol,

2:08:32.300 --> 2:08:35.180
 all available as immediately downloadable PDFs.

2:08:35.180 --> 2:08:38.020
 So I'd like to thank you once again for joining me today

2:08:38.020 --> 2:08:41.020
 in our discussion about these incredibly powerful molecules

2:08:41.020 --> 2:08:46.020
 we call neuromodulators and the things we can do and take

2:08:46.260 --> 2:08:49.040
 in order to control them so that we can enhance

2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:51.460
 our mental health, physical health, and performance.

2:08:51.460 --> 2:08:53.900
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:08:53.900 --> 2:08:55.900
 thank you for your interest in science.
