00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.240 --> 00:10.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.160 --> 00:12.900
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.900 --> 00:14.760
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.760
 Today, we are going to talk about the psychology

00:16.760 --> 00:21.080
 and the biology of desire, love, and attachment.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.600
 Today happens to be Valentine's Day, 2022.

00:24.600 --> 00:27.000
 However, the themes we are going to discuss

00:27.000 --> 00:29.560
 pertain to desire, love, and attachment

00:29.560 --> 00:30.760
 on any given day.

00:30.760 --> 00:33.240
 And indeed, the mechanisms we are going to discuss

00:33.240 --> 00:36.080
 almost certainly were at play thousands of years ago,

00:36.080 --> 00:37.480
 hundreds of years ago,

00:37.480 --> 00:40.160
 and no doubt will still be at play in our minds

00:40.160 --> 00:42.400
 and in our bodies and in our psychologies

00:42.400 --> 00:45.700
 for the decades, centuries, and thousands of years to come.

00:45.700 --> 00:49.000
 Indeed, today, I want to focus on core mechanisms

00:49.000 --> 00:52.280
 that lead individuals to seek out other individuals

00:52.280 --> 00:54.580
 with whom to mate with,

00:54.580 --> 00:57.120
 with whom to have children with or not,

00:57.120 --> 01:00.640
 with whom to enter short or long-term relationships with,

01:00.640 --> 01:03.200
 and perhaps to end those relationships

01:03.200 --> 01:04.920
 or to seek relationships on the side,

01:04.920 --> 01:06.480
 so-called infidelity.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.360
 I'm certainly not going to encourage or discourage

01:08.360 --> 01:09.320
 any of these behaviors.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.700
 I'm simply going to cover the peer-reviewed scientific data

01:12.700 --> 01:16.840
 on all these aspects of desire, love, and attachment.

01:16.840 --> 01:20.260
 I'm going to discuss how our childhood attachment styles,

01:20.260 --> 01:24.760
 as they're called, influence our adult attachment styles.

01:24.760 --> 01:25.980
 Yes, you heard that right.

01:25.980 --> 01:30.660
 How we attached or did not attach to primary caregivers

01:30.660 --> 01:35.280
 in our childhood has much to do with how we attach

01:35.280 --> 01:39.060
 or fail to attach to romantic partners as adults,

01:39.060 --> 01:41.920
 because the same neural circuits,

01:41.920 --> 01:44.400
 the neurons and their connections in the brain and body

01:44.400 --> 01:47.720
 that underlie attachment between infant and caregiver,

01:47.720 --> 01:50.360
 between toddler and parent or other caregiver,

01:50.360 --> 01:53.180
 and during adolescence and in our teenage years,

01:53.180 --> 01:57.080
 are repurposed for adult romantic attachments.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.240
 I know that might be a little eerie to think about,

01:59.240 --> 02:01.000
 but indeed that is true.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.000
 Now, the fortunate thing is that regardless

02:03.000 --> 02:06.900
 of our childhood attachment styles and experiences,

02:06.900 --> 02:10.240
 the neural circuits for desire, love, and attachment

02:10.240 --> 02:11.320
 are quite plastic.

02:11.320 --> 02:13.860
 They are amenable to change in response

02:13.860 --> 02:16.880
 to both what we think and what we feel,

02:16.880 --> 02:18.560
 as well as what we do.

02:18.560 --> 02:22.040
 However, all three aspects that we're discussing today,

02:22.040 --> 02:24.060
 desire, love, and attachment,

02:24.060 --> 02:27.000
 are also strongly biologically driven.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.520
 We're going to talk about biological mechanisms

02:29.520 --> 02:32.120
 such as hormones, biological mechanisms

02:32.120 --> 02:34.320
 such as neurochemicals, things like dopamine,

02:34.320 --> 02:38.820
 oxytocin, and serotonin, and neural circuits, brain areas,

02:38.820 --> 02:41.960
 and indeed areas of the body that interact with the brain

02:41.960 --> 02:45.140
 that control whether or not we desire somebody or not,

02:45.140 --> 02:47.360
 whether or not we lose or increase our desire

02:47.360 --> 02:50.960
 for somebody over time, whether or not we fall in love,

02:50.960 --> 02:53.960
 what love means, and whether or not the relationships

02:53.960 --> 02:57.280
 we form continue to include the elements of desire

02:57.280 --> 02:59.680
 and love over time or not.

02:59.680 --> 03:02.120
 In order to illustrate just how powerfully our biology

03:02.120 --> 03:04.060
 can shape our perception of the attractiveness

03:04.060 --> 03:06.440
 of other people, I want to share with you the results

03:06.440 --> 03:07.880
 of a couple of studies.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.200
 Both studies explore how people rate

03:10.200 --> 03:12.160
 other people's attractiveness.

03:12.160 --> 03:16.240
 And in both studies, the major variable is that women

03:16.240 --> 03:18.840
 are at different stages of their menstrual cycle.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.440
 Now, in the first study, men are rating the attractiveness

03:22.440 --> 03:25.360
 of women according to the smell of those women.

03:25.360 --> 03:26.760
 Now, they're not smelling them directly.

03:26.760 --> 03:29.240
 They're smelling clothing that women wore

03:29.240 --> 03:31.640
 for a couple of days at different phases

03:31.640 --> 03:32.880
 of their menstrual cycle.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.260
 And what they find is that men will rate the odors of women

03:36.260 --> 03:40.760
 as most attractive if those women wore those shirts,

03:40.760 --> 03:44.520
 that clothing, in the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.

03:44.520 --> 03:48.040
 Okay, so this is not to say that men do not find women

03:48.040 --> 03:50.080
 attractive at other stages of their cycle.

03:50.080 --> 03:53.440
 It is to say that men find women's odors

03:53.440 --> 03:57.520
 particularly attractive if those odors were worn by women

03:57.520 --> 03:59.680
 that are in the pre-ovulatory phase

03:59.680 --> 04:02.160
 of their menstrual cycle, okay?

04:02.160 --> 04:04.840
 Now, there was also a study that was done

04:04.840 --> 04:07.680
 where women at different stages of their menstrual cycle

04:07.680 --> 04:09.920
 are rating the odors of men.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.380
 And a similar but mirror symmetric result was found

04:13.380 --> 04:16.260
 such that women who are in the pre-ovulatory phase

04:16.260 --> 04:19.480
 of their menstrual cycle will rate men's odors

04:19.480 --> 04:23.400
 as more attractive than at other stages of their cycle.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.280
 So the simple way to put this is that

04:25.280 --> 04:27.160
 there seems to be something special

04:27.160 --> 04:30.080
 about the pre-ovulatory phase of a woman's menstrual cycle

04:30.080 --> 04:32.320
 that makes men rate them as more attractive

04:32.320 --> 04:36.520
 during that time and women rate men as more attractive

04:36.520 --> 04:38.480
 during that particular time as well.

04:38.480 --> 04:41.360
 So this is a bi-directional effect.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.620
 The way that the second study was done

04:43.620 --> 04:47.440
 where women are rating men was not just to smell the odors

04:47.440 --> 04:50.160
 of those men on t-shirts, they did that,

04:50.160 --> 04:52.760
 but they correlated that with whether or not the shirts

04:52.760 --> 04:54.800
 were worn by men that were particularly

04:54.800 --> 04:56.600
 physically symmetrical.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.640
 They actually had these men divided into groups,

04:58.640 --> 05:00.240
 it was more of a continuum rather,

05:00.240 --> 05:03.520
 rated according to body symmetry and face symmetry.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.040
 And women preferred more symmetrical men

05:07.040 --> 05:09.760
 when they were doing the preference test

05:09.760 --> 05:12.400
 during the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.040
 So again, the point is that pre-ovulatory phase of the cycle

05:15.040 --> 05:19.380
 seems to create a bi-directional mutual attractiveness.

05:19.380 --> 05:22.000
 Now also extremely interesting is that this effect

05:22.000 --> 05:25.200
 does really seem to have something to do with ovulation

05:25.200 --> 05:27.400
 because in both studies,

05:27.400 --> 05:30.340
 they had women that were taking oral contraception or not.

05:30.340 --> 05:31.760
 And what they found was

05:31.760 --> 05:34.480
 if a woman is taking oral contraception,

05:34.480 --> 05:37.720
 it prevented that peak in perceived attractiveness

05:37.720 --> 05:41.800
 by the men, meaning men no longer perceived a woman

05:41.800 --> 05:45.280
 to be more attractive at a particular phase of their cycle.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.360
 And also women taking oral contraception

05:48.360 --> 05:51.700
 no longer preferred the odors of more symmetrical men

05:51.700 --> 05:54.160
 during the pre-ovulatory phase of their cycle.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.120
 Now I want to make sure that it's especially clear

05:57.120 --> 06:00.320
 that it is not the case that oral contraception

06:00.320 --> 06:03.480
 reduced the perception of a woman as attractive,

06:03.480 --> 06:05.280
 that did not happen in these studies.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.800
 It reduced the further increase

06:07.800 --> 06:10.560
 in a male's perception of her as attractive.

06:10.560 --> 06:13.200
 And if women took oral contraception,

06:13.200 --> 06:18.080
 it prevented them from preferring more symmetrical men

06:18.080 --> 06:20.120
 based on the odors of those men.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.680
 Now I realize there are a lot of variables here.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.140
 We've got odors, we've got symmetry,

06:23.140 --> 06:26.240
 we've got menstrual cycle, pre-ovulatory, non-pre-ovulatory,

06:26.240 --> 06:28.040
 and we have whether or not

06:28.040 --> 06:29.720
 people are taking contraception or not.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.680
 But the basic finding is that depending on where women are

06:32.680 --> 06:35.820
 in their menstrual cycle influences both men's perception

06:35.820 --> 06:37.260
 of them as attractive

06:37.260 --> 06:40.440
 and their perception of men as attractive.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.360
 And oral contraception eliminates that effect.

06:43.360 --> 06:45.680
 So I share with you those data to illustrate

06:45.680 --> 06:49.640
 that we often think that somebody is attractive or not

06:49.640 --> 06:52.360
 based on, I don't know how they look,

06:52.360 --> 06:54.500
 their skin, their hair, et cetera.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.360
 But it also illustrates that their odor is a powerful cue

06:58.360 --> 06:59.760
 for some people more than others.

06:59.760 --> 07:02.000
 Some of us tend to be more olfactory driven than others.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.720
 Although if you watched the Huberman Lab podcast episode

07:04.720 --> 07:06.720
 that I did with Professor David Buss

07:06.720 --> 07:08.520
 from the University of Texas, Austin,

07:08.520 --> 07:12.340
 who's a luminary in the field of evolutionary psychology

07:12.340 --> 07:13.980
 and has studied mate choice

07:13.980 --> 07:16.400
 and mate selection bias over decades.

07:16.400 --> 07:18.840
 He's really one of the founders of that field.

07:18.840 --> 07:23.180
 He emphasized findings that odor for many people

07:23.180 --> 07:26.240
 is a maker or a deal breaker.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.280
 Meaning there are some people that even if somebody

07:29.280 --> 07:31.720
 has all the characteristics that they're looking for

07:31.720 --> 07:34.520
 in terms of kindness and attractiveness and values

07:34.520 --> 07:37.120
 and other features that would and should be

07:37.120 --> 07:39.440
 of very high priority in selecting a mate,

07:39.440 --> 07:43.280
 that if someone does not like the way that person smells,

07:43.280 --> 07:46.200
 their innate body odor, independent of colognes

07:46.200 --> 07:48.440
 and perfumes and soaps, et cetera,

07:48.440 --> 07:51.480
 that that's often a complete and total deal breaker.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.200
 I'm sure there are some of you that can relate to that.

07:53.200 --> 07:55.160
 And there are some of you perhaps for which

07:55.160 --> 07:56.440
 that is not the case.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.680
 And you can't even imagine that

07:57.680 --> 07:59.440
 being such a powerful variable.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.280
 And yet the data suggests that indeed

08:02.280 --> 08:04.840
 it is a powerful variable for many people out there.

08:04.840 --> 08:06.500
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

08:06.500 --> 08:07.800
 that this podcast is separate

08:07.800 --> 08:10.100
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

08:10.100 --> 08:12.380
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

08:12.380 --> 08:15.160
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

08:15.160 --> 08:17.760
 and science-related tools to the general public.

08:17.760 --> 08:18.840
 In keeping with that theme,

08:18.840 --> 08:21.540
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

08:21.540 --> 08:23.480
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.800
 Thesis makes custom nootropics.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.960
 Now nootropics is not a word that I'm usually a fan of

08:28.960 --> 08:31.360
 because nootropic means smart drug.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.880
 And there are a lot of different aspects

08:32.880 --> 08:35.000
 to being smart or to intelligence.

08:35.000 --> 08:36.440
 There's the ability to focus.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.480
 There's the ability to task switch.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.680
 There's the ability to be creative.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.960
 And each of those different forms of intelligence

08:42.960 --> 08:44.480
 or expressions of intelligence

08:44.480 --> 08:47.360
 involves different brain circuits, different neurochemicals,

08:47.360 --> 08:50.320
 and indeed different hormones in the body.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.200
 So I think it's rather naive to think

08:52.200 --> 08:54.800
 that there could be one smart drug or nootropic.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.240
 Thesis understands this.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.480
 And so they've developed custom nootropics

08:58.480 --> 09:00.440
 that are tailored to the specific goals

09:00.440 --> 09:02.380
 that you might have in terms of cognitive work

09:02.380 --> 09:06.020
 or physical exercise or skill learning of any kind.

09:06.020 --> 09:08.440
 And they tailor them to the individual.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.820
 They only use the highest quality ingredients,

09:10.820 --> 09:13.000
 many of which I've talked about here on the podcast,

09:13.000 --> 09:15.260
 things like alpha GPC, which I personally use,

09:15.260 --> 09:18.960
 things like phosphatidylserine, which I also use on occasion.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.120
 However, they've taken different combinations

09:21.120 --> 09:24.440
 of those ingredients and put them into different formulations

09:24.440 --> 09:27.320
 designed for particular goals or endpoints.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.640
 For instance, I have thesis nootropics

09:29.640 --> 09:31.440
 that are for motivation,

09:31.440 --> 09:35.160
 others that are for clarity, for mental clarity,

09:35.160 --> 09:37.060
 others that I take pre-workout,

09:37.060 --> 09:40.400
 others that I take post-workout, and so on and so forth.

09:40.400 --> 09:43.040
 Now, in addition to that, thesis understands

09:43.040 --> 09:46.200
 that not every ingredient is terrific for everybody.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.120
 In fact, one particular substance

09:48.120 --> 09:51.060
 that I've talked about on the podcast, ginkgo biloba,

09:51.060 --> 09:53.160
 is very useful for a lot of people.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.600
 However, I don't tolerate it well.

09:54.600 --> 09:56.700
 I get vicious headaches from ginkgo biloba.

09:56.700 --> 09:58.900
 So none of the formulations that they've made for me

09:58.900 --> 10:00.560
 include ginkgo biloba.

10:00.560 --> 10:02.480
 So again, these are custom nootropics

10:02.480 --> 10:04.520
 that are tailored for your particular goals

10:04.520 --> 10:07.640
 and where the ingredients really match your particular needs

10:07.640 --> 10:10.400
 and don't include things that aren't going to work for you

10:10.400 --> 10:12.600
 or that create things like headaches.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.960
 So the personalization and the targeted effects

10:14.960 --> 10:17.240
 of the nootropics is really where the power comes from.

10:17.240 --> 10:19.060
 I've been using thesis nootropics

10:19.060 --> 10:20.440
 for close to six months now,

10:20.440 --> 10:22.760
 and I can confidently say that their nootropics

10:22.760 --> 10:24.760
 have been a total game changer for me.

10:24.760 --> 10:28.160
 My go-to formula is the motivation formula,

10:28.160 --> 10:30.000
 if I'm going to be training or working out

10:30.000 --> 10:31.120
 or I need extra energy,

10:31.120 --> 10:33.240
 and I use the clarity formula nowadays

10:33.240 --> 10:35.320
 for any kind of writing or creative work.

10:35.320 --> 10:37.860
 Those are the two that I've mainly been taking lately.

10:37.860 --> 10:38.700
 If you want to try

10:38.700 --> 10:41.080

 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens,

11:11.840 --> 11:13.440
 now called AG1.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.840
 I've been taking AG1 since 2012,

11:15.840 --> 11:18.160
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.840
 The reason I started taking AG1

11:19.840 --> 11:22.640
 and the reason I still take AG1 once or twice a day

11:22.640 --> 11:26.060
 is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral probiotic needs.

11:26.060 --> 11:27.640
 Probiotics are essential

11:27.640 --> 11:30.580
 because they support what's called a healthy gut microbiome.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.440
 The gut microbiome is vital

11:32.440 --> 11:34.520
 for things like metabolism, hormone function,

11:34.520 --> 11:36.960
 and also we now know our brain function,

11:36.960 --> 11:40.000
 things like focus and memory and our general immune system.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.120
 With AG1, I get the probiotics I need,

11:42.120 --> 11:43.760
 I get the vitamins and minerals that I need

11:43.760 --> 11:47.180
 to cover any nutritional gaps if I'm not eating optimally,

11:47.180 --> 11:49.140
 and even if I am eating optimally,

11:49.140 --> 11:51.560
 AG1 can further support metabolism,

11:51.560 --> 11:52.640
 hormone function, et cetera.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.520
 In fact, whenever people ask me,

11:54.520 --> 11:56.480
 what's the one supplement that I should take

11:56.480 --> 11:59.560
 if I can only take one supplement, I always say AG1.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.280
 I take mine early in the day,

12:01.280 --> 12:03.360
 I mix it with water and some lemon or lime juice,

12:03.360 --> 12:04.240
 I love the way it tastes,

12:04.240 --> 12:05.880
 and I'll take it again later in the day,

12:05.880 --> 12:07.840
 typically in the late afternoon.

12:07.840 --> 12:09.260
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

12:09.260 --> 12:11.880

12:13.440 --> 12:15.280
 They're giving you five free travel packs

12:15.280 --> 12:17.120
 that make it really easy to mix up AG1

12:17.120 --> 12:18.400
 while you're on the road, in the car,

12:18.400 --> 12:19.760
 on the plane, et cetera,

12:19.760 --> 12:22.840
 and a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.420
 There's a ton of data now supporting the fact

12:25.420 --> 12:27.300
 that vitamin D3 is critical

12:27.300 --> 12:29.600
 and that most of us don't get enough vitamin D3

12:29.600 --> 12:31.640
 even if we're getting ample sunlight.

12:31.640 --> 12:33.440
 Vitamin D3 is important for metabolism,

12:33.440 --> 12:34.760
 hormone function, brain function,

12:34.760 --> 12:37.160
 and many other aspects of our biology.

12:37.160 --> 12:40.240
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

12:40.240 --> 12:42.360
 you can get a special offer of the Athletic Greens,

12:42.360 --> 12:43.440
 five free travel packs,

12:43.440 --> 12:46.320
 and the year supply of vitamin D3K2.

12:46.320 --> 12:49.640
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.340
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

12:52.340 --> 12:55.180
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

12:55.180 --> 12:56.760
 to help you better understand your body

12:56.760 --> 12:58.880
 and help you reach your health goals.

12:58.880 --> 13:01.800
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

13:01.800 --> 13:04.200
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

13:04.200 --> 13:06.520
 that influence your immediate and long-term health

13:06.520 --> 13:09.600
 can only be discovered from a quality blood test.

13:09.600 --> 13:12.520
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

13:12.520 --> 13:14.420
 you can also get information, for instance,

13:14.420 --> 13:16.280
 about how your biological age

13:16.280 --> 13:18.000
 compares to your chronological age,

13:18.000 --> 13:20.760
 which of course is a vital measurement.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.480
 Now, one of the major issues

13:22.480 --> 13:24.360
 with blood tests and DNA tests out there

13:24.360 --> 13:26.360
 is that people get the information back

13:26.360 --> 13:30.720
 that lipid marker of one type, it might be high or low,

13:30.720 --> 13:33.460
 or that a hormone of another type might be high or low,

13:33.460 --> 13:34.880
 but they don't give you any information

13:34.880 --> 13:36.680
 about what to do with that information.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.720
 Inside Tracker makes that all very easy to navigate.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.260
 Once you get your results back,

13:41.260 --> 13:43.280
 you can click on any of those results,

13:43.280 --> 13:45.780
 and Inside Tracker will immediately show you

13:45.780 --> 13:47.060
 things that you can do, for instance,

13:47.060 --> 13:50.440
 with your nutrition or supplementation or lifestyle factors

13:50.440 --> 13:52.500
 to help you bring those numbers into the ranges

13:52.500 --> 13:54.360
 that are appropriate for you.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.600
 So it's immensely powerful,

13:55.600 --> 13:57.160
 not just in terms of the measurements,

13:57.160 --> 13:59.240
 but also it provides some directives

13:59.240 --> 14:01.640
 that can help bring those measurements into the ranges

14:01.640 --> 14:04.160
 that are best for your immediate and long-term health.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.600
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

14:05.600 --> 14:08.160

14:10.900 --> 14:13.160
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

14:13.160 --> 14:16.200
 Let's talk about desire, love, and attachment.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.380
 And of course, these are topics

14:17.380 --> 14:18.760
 that grab tremendous interest,

14:18.760 --> 14:21.760
 so it's worth us defining our terms a little bit

14:21.760 --> 14:23.800
 before going any further.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.900
 Of course, we can have many different kinds of loves.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.280
 There's romantic love.

14:28.280 --> 14:31.200
 There's love of family, so-called familial love.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.600
 There's love of pets.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.240
 We can even love objects,

14:34.240 --> 14:36.280
 where we can feel as if we love objects.

14:36.280 --> 14:37.660
 We can love certain activities.

14:37.660 --> 14:40.220
 We can have friends that we love, and so on and so forth.

14:40.220 --> 14:41.800
 The word love is used to encompass

14:41.800 --> 14:44.400
 a lot of different types of relationships.

14:44.400 --> 14:47.860
 Today, we are mainly going to be focused on romantic love

14:47.860 --> 14:51.160
 and the neural mechanisms of romantic love.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.760
 I want to acknowledge here at the outset

14:52.760 --> 14:55.080
 that most of the studies of romantic love

14:55.080 --> 14:58.820
 have focused on monogamous heterosexual love.

14:58.820 --> 15:02.280
 And also, when we talk about studies focused on desire

15:02.280 --> 15:05.240
 and attractiveness and attachment, that's also the case.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.240
 And that simply reflects the general bias of the literature

15:08.240 --> 15:10.600
 over the last 50 to 100 years.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.160
 It does, of course, not rule out that similar

15:13.160 --> 15:15.400
 or different mechanisms could be at play

15:15.400 --> 15:17.540
 in non-monogamous relationships,

15:17.540 --> 15:19.560
 in homosexual relationships,

15:19.560 --> 15:22.880
 or in relationships of any kind or variation.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.400
 It's also worth us defining our terms around desire.

15:26.400 --> 15:28.120
 It can mean lust.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.900
 It can mean the desire for long-term partnership.

15:30.900 --> 15:32.200
 So we need to define our terms.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.920
 And throughout, I will do my best

15:33.920 --> 15:37.300
 to very carefully define what I mean by desire,

15:37.300 --> 15:40.640
 what I mean by love, and what I mean by attachment.

15:41.840 --> 15:46.320
 The formal study of love and desire and attachment

15:46.320 --> 15:49.860
 goes back to the early 1900s.

15:49.860 --> 15:52.640
 One of the classic studies on this is entitled

15:52.640 --> 15:53.600
 Love and Desire.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.520
 It was published in 1912 and really focused

15:56.520 --> 16:01.040
 on two opposing themes within romance.

16:01.040 --> 16:05.400
 One is love, which in that paper was really meant

16:05.400 --> 16:08.080
 to include attachment and dependence

16:08.080 --> 16:11.600
 or interdependence between individuals, right?

16:11.600 --> 16:14.320
 And the other end of the spectrum being desire

16:14.320 --> 16:17.180
 or the sexual desire for another.

16:17.180 --> 16:20.560
 And romance was meant to encapsulate both those things,

16:20.560 --> 16:22.280
 love and desire.

16:22.280 --> 16:25.300
 And for much of the 1900s,

16:25.300 --> 16:26.980
 it was thought that love and desire

16:26.980 --> 16:30.240
 were on sort of opposing ends or in kind of a push-pull.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.360
 And it was the dynamic push and pull

16:32.360 --> 16:37.360
 between love and desire that one could define romance.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.320
 And that actually led to much of what's out there

16:40.320 --> 16:42.200
 in the psychological literature.

16:42.200 --> 16:46.080
 Today, we are going to explore some neurobiological studies,

16:46.080 --> 16:48.240
 some studies of the endocrine system,

16:48.240 --> 16:49.440
 meaning the hormone system,

16:49.440 --> 16:51.320
 that actually support that general model.

16:51.320 --> 16:55.240
 And I'll point you toward what I think is a very useful book

16:55.240 --> 16:57.760
 in thinking about how relationships

16:57.760 --> 17:01.640
 can both form and last over long periods of time

17:01.640 --> 17:03.800
 and how those relationships can include

17:03.800 --> 17:07.880
 both desire and interdependence.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.520
 I'll also talk about some studies

17:09.520 --> 17:12.880
 that have really focused on why relationships succeed

17:12.880 --> 17:15.160
 and why they fail and how that relates

17:15.160 --> 17:17.640
 to whether or not there is sufficient amounts

17:17.640 --> 17:19.400
 of attachment and desire.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.740
 So today we're going to talk about the science

17:20.740 --> 17:22.700
 and indeed you'll also get some tools.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.000
 Those tools should be useful to you

17:24.000 --> 17:27.160
 whether or not you happen to be in a relationship or not,

17:27.160 --> 17:29.300
 whether or not you're seeking a relationship or not.

17:29.300 --> 17:30.940
 I'd like to begin with an anecdote,

17:30.940 --> 17:34.640
 and this is not an anecdote about my relationship history.

17:34.640 --> 17:38.080
 It's a anecdote about my scientific history.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.480
 When I started graduate school,

17:39.480 --> 17:41.960
 the chairman of the department I was in at the time

17:41.960 --> 17:43.720
 said to me, you know,

17:43.720 --> 17:47.160
 most PhDs last longer than most marriages.

17:47.160 --> 17:48.640
 And indeed he was right.

17:48.640 --> 17:52.480
 And also most marriages in this country end in divorce.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.940
 I think it's about 50% with a slight skew

17:55.940 --> 17:59.080
 toward more ending in divorce than persist

17:59.080 --> 18:01.440
 until death do them part.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.780
 But nonetheless, it's about half

18:03.780 --> 18:07.840
 and most marriages end before the eight-year period is up.

18:07.840 --> 18:11.680
 Most PhDs take anywhere from four to nine years.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.840
 So there was a bit of a smearing of averages there,

18:13.840 --> 18:15.160
 but the point he was trying to make

18:15.160 --> 18:17.200
 really landed home for me.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.260
 It did not scare me out of relationships,

18:20.260 --> 18:23.040
 nor did it scare me out of a PhD, obviously.

18:23.040 --> 18:25.960
 What it did illustrate was that there's something

18:25.960 --> 18:29.760
 about our attachment machinery that can be very,

18:29.760 --> 18:32.160
 very compelling such that people take on

18:32.160 --> 18:33.960
 tremendous levels of commitment.

18:33.960 --> 18:36.280
 I have to imagine that most people enter marriages

18:36.280 --> 18:37.920
 assuming that they're going to stay in those marriages.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.040
 I don't think most people enter marriages

18:40.040 --> 18:41.480
 thinking they're going to get divorced,

18:41.480 --> 18:46.120
 but that if 50% of those commitments end in divorce,

18:46.120 --> 18:47.840
 there must also be mechanisms

18:47.840 --> 18:50.700
 by which our attachments can break.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.040
 And today we're going to talk about

18:52.040 --> 18:53.640
 both the forming of attachments

18:53.640 --> 18:55.320
 and the breaking of attachments,

18:55.320 --> 18:57.640
 what can prevent those breaks in attachments,

18:57.640 --> 19:01.000
 and indeed what can lead to reattachments.

19:01.000 --> 19:04.400
 There are biological mechanisms

19:04.400 --> 19:06.880
 to desire, love, and attachment.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.740
 That's abundantly clear.

19:08.740 --> 19:12.520
 Now, there's a robust and very large literature

19:12.520 --> 19:13.840
 in animal models.

19:13.840 --> 19:17.340
 What I mean by that are field studies and laboratory studies

19:17.340 --> 19:19.040
 in primates of different kinds,

19:19.040 --> 19:21.400
 such as macaque monkeys or bonobos.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.940
 People have looked at these sorts of things,

19:23.940 --> 19:26.760
 believe it or not, in ducks, in laboratory mice,

19:26.760 --> 19:29.480
 in different types of birds, et cetera.

19:29.480 --> 19:30.800
 And if you look at that literature,

19:30.800 --> 19:34.640
 you can essentially find biological examples

19:34.640 --> 19:37.120
 in the animal kingdom for just about any behavior

19:37.120 --> 19:39.800
 that you can easily map to human behavior.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.280
 So for instance,

19:41.280 --> 19:43.800
 there's a species of animal called the prairie vole.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.300
 In one portion of the United States,

19:46.300 --> 19:48.400
 this prairie vole species is monogamous.

19:48.400 --> 19:51.560
 They only mate with one other prairie vole,

19:51.560 --> 19:53.520
 only raise young with one other prairie vole

19:53.520 --> 19:55.480
 for their entire life.

19:55.480 --> 19:58.040
 And in another region of the United States,

19:58.040 --> 20:01.080
 the same species of animal, the prairie vole,

20:01.080 --> 20:02.720
 will mate with many individuals.

20:02.720 --> 20:04.040
 They're non-monogamous.

20:04.040 --> 20:06.380
 And the major difference, at least as far as we know,

20:06.380 --> 20:08.360
 between the prairie voles in one location

20:08.360 --> 20:11.920
 and another location is the levels of a molecule

20:11.920 --> 20:13.920
 called vasopressin in the brain and body.

20:13.920 --> 20:16.000
 Vasopressin is present in humans.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.360
 It has numerous biological roles.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.840
 It's responsible, for instance,

20:19.840 --> 20:22.400
 for controlling the amount of urine that you excrete,

20:22.400 --> 20:24.080
 the amount of water that you retain,

20:24.080 --> 20:28.360
 and for sexual desire, as well as mate seeking.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.680
 Levels of vasopressin in prairie voles

20:31.680 --> 20:35.400
 are strongly determinant of whether or not a prairie vole

20:35.400 --> 20:38.320
 is going to be monogamous or non-monogamous.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.220
 Why do I raise this?

20:39.220 --> 20:43.520
 Well, I raise this because the literature on prairie voles

20:43.520 --> 20:47.000
 is quite beautiful and has been discussed quite a lot

20:47.000 --> 20:47.820
 in the popular press.

20:47.820 --> 20:50.980
 You can look it up with an easily just a web engine search.

20:50.980 --> 20:52.520
 You'll find lots of information about this,

20:52.520 --> 20:55.680
 lots of news articles about this and lots of interpretations

20:55.680 --> 20:57.560
 as to how vasopressin might be involved

20:57.560 --> 21:00.600
 in similar or different mechanisms in humans.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.320
 Now, I don't have a problem

21:02.320 --> 21:04.280
 with mapping animal studies to humans.

21:04.280 --> 21:06.160
 I think there's certainly a place for that.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.360
 But if we just sort of lean back and look at the giant mass

21:10.360 --> 21:13.920
 of studies in animals and their mating behavior

21:13.920 --> 21:15.440
 and their mate selection behavior,

21:15.440 --> 21:17.840
 you can essentially find examples of anything.

21:17.840 --> 21:20.000
 You can find examples of polygamy.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.400
 You can find examples of cheating, of infidelity.

21:23.400 --> 21:26.160
 You can find examples of all sorts of different behaviors

21:26.160 --> 21:29.280
 that in your own mind, you can map to human behavior.

21:29.280 --> 21:32.560
 But it's really hard to make the leap from animal models

21:32.560 --> 21:34.560
 to humans in any kind of direct way.

21:34.560 --> 21:37.840
 And so thankfully there's been tremendous work done

21:37.840 --> 21:40.240
 in the last mainly 20 years or so

21:40.240 --> 21:43.440
 looking at human mate selection, human desire,

21:43.440 --> 21:45.440
 human love and human attachment.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.440
 So we're mainly going to focus on those studies today

21:47.440 --> 21:50.880
 and where appropriate, we will map those findings

21:50.880 --> 21:52.720
 back to the findings in animals

21:52.720 --> 21:55.080
 to see if there are some universal truths

21:55.080 --> 21:58.280
 or some universal principles about how the neural circuits

21:58.280 --> 22:00.000
 and biological mechanisms work.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.160
 But by and large, we're going to focus

22:01.160 --> 22:02.300
 on human studies today.

22:02.300 --> 22:03.680
 So unless I say otherwise,

22:03.680 --> 22:05.080
 the data that I'm referring to today

22:05.080 --> 22:07.160
 are entirely from human beings.

22:07.160 --> 22:10.240
 So let's talk about attachment and attachment styles.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.840
 And this will offer you the opportunity

22:11.840 --> 22:15.120
 to answer some important questions for yourself,

22:15.120 --> 22:18.240
 such as what is my, meaning your,

22:18.240 --> 22:20.440
 attachment style in relationship?

22:21.820 --> 22:25.340
 One of the most robust findings in the field of psychology

22:25.340 --> 22:27.680
 is this notion of attachment styles.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.620
 And this was something that was discovered

22:29.620 --> 22:31.280
 through a beautiful set of studies

22:31.280 --> 22:34.740
 that were done by Mary Ainsworth in the 1980s

22:34.740 --> 22:37.240
 in which she developed a laboratory condition

22:37.240 --> 22:39.880
 called the strange situation task.

22:39.880 --> 22:42.520
 Now, the strange situation task has been studied

22:42.520 --> 22:45.120
 over and over again in different cultures,

22:45.120 --> 22:47.360
 in different locations throughout the world.

22:47.360 --> 22:49.580
 And in preparing for this episode,

22:49.580 --> 22:51.400
 I actually spoke to three different psychologists.

22:51.400 --> 22:52.720
 I spoke to a psychoanalyst,

22:52.720 --> 22:54.580
 I spoke to a cognitive behavioral psychologist,

22:54.580 --> 22:56.040
 and I actually spoke to a psychiatrist,

22:56.040 --> 22:57.160
 excuse me, not a psychologist,

22:57.160 --> 23:00.240
 but a psychiatrist with a medical degree and asked,

23:00.240 --> 23:01.960
 is the strange situation task

23:01.960 --> 23:03.880
 and the various attachment styles

23:03.880 --> 23:06.240
 that emerge from that task,

23:06.240 --> 23:08.240
 are those still considered valid?

23:08.240 --> 23:09.860
 And indeed all three of them said,

23:09.860 --> 23:12.160
 if ever there was a literature in psychology

23:12.160 --> 23:17.140
 that is absolutely tamped down and has a firm basis

23:17.140 --> 23:20.120
 in both data and real world principles

23:20.120 --> 23:21.960
 and real world examples,

23:21.960 --> 23:25.500
 it's this notion of attachment styles.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.540
 So what is the strange situation task?

23:27.540 --> 23:30.160
 The strange situation task involves a parent,

23:30.160 --> 23:32.740
 typically a mother in the studies that were done,

23:32.740 --> 23:36.880
 but a parent or other caregiver bringing their child,

23:36.880 --> 23:39.520
 their actual child into a laboratory.

23:39.520 --> 23:43.040
 And there's a room with a stranger

23:43.040 --> 23:45.840
 and the mother enters the room with the child

23:45.840 --> 23:48.040
 and there's some toys in the room

23:48.040 --> 23:51.400
 and typically the mother and the stranger will talk.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.240
 Obviously the stranger is part of the experiment.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.640
 It's not just some random person off the street

23:55.640 --> 23:58.140
 and the child is allowed to move about the room.

23:58.140 --> 24:00.140
 They can observe the mother interacting

24:00.140 --> 24:01.720
 with the other person or not.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.480
 They can play with toys or not,

24:03.480 --> 24:06.760
 but then at some point the mother leaves

24:06.760 --> 24:08.160
 and then at some point later,

24:08.160 --> 24:11.520
 designated by the experimenter, the mother comes back.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.400
 And what is measured in these studies

24:14.400 --> 24:17.800
 is both how the child, the toddler,

24:17.800 --> 24:19.960
 reacts to the mother leaving

24:20.960 --> 24:24.000
 and how the child reacts to the mother returning

24:24.000 --> 24:25.960
 at the end of the experiment.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.680
 And oftentimes this will have two or three different phases

24:29.680 --> 24:31.680
 where the mother will bring the child in,

24:31.680 --> 24:35.440
 then leave, then come back in and leave.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.520
 There are also studies in which the behavior

24:38.520 --> 24:42.080
 of the child with the stranger is also examined.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.540
 So there are a lot of variations of this,

24:43.540 --> 24:48.540
 but the basic findings are that toddlers, children,

24:49.580 --> 24:54.580
 fall into four different categories of attachment style

24:54.760 --> 24:58.280
 and that these attachment styles can predict many features

24:58.280 --> 25:01.120
 of adolescent, teen, young adult,

25:01.120 --> 25:03.480
 and even adult attachment styles,

25:03.480 --> 25:06.640
 not in strange situations of the sort that I just described,

25:06.640 --> 25:08.580
 but in romantic attachments.

25:10.280 --> 25:14.560
 I should mention also that attachment style is plastic,

25:14.560 --> 25:17.240
 meaning it can change across the lifespan.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.660
 So as I described the results,

25:18.660 --> 25:20.680
 I described the different attachment styles

25:20.680 --> 25:21.640
 that are out there.

25:22.520 --> 25:25.880
 And if any of those resonate with you

25:25.880 --> 25:28.880
 or bring to mind certain people in your life,

25:28.880 --> 25:31.600
 please do not assume that those attachment styles

25:31.600 --> 25:34.240
 are rigid and fixed for the entire lifespan.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.920
 There are also terrific data that indicate

25:36.920 --> 25:39.520
 that through specific processes,

25:39.520 --> 25:43.500
 both psychological and some biological adjustments,

25:43.500 --> 25:46.040
 that people can change their attachment style

25:46.040 --> 25:48.580
 and that indeed people who have different attachment styles

25:48.580 --> 25:50.880
 can change the attachment styles of others.

25:50.880 --> 25:52.840
 But just to make very clear what the results

25:52.840 --> 25:53.720
 of the study were,

25:53.720 --> 25:56.400
 I want to review what the four different attachment styles

25:56.400 --> 25:59.640
 are and typically people fall into one group or another,

25:59.640 --> 26:00.960
 but not several.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.820
 So the four patterns of attachment

26:02.820 --> 26:05.120
 that were revealed by these studies,

26:05.120 --> 26:08.780
 again, were revealed by examining the behavior of the child

26:08.780 --> 26:12.160
 in response to the mother leaving and the mother returning

26:12.160 --> 26:15.320
 and the child's response to the stranger

26:15.320 --> 26:16.680
 that is in the room with them.

26:16.680 --> 26:21.080
 The first style is the so-called secure attachment style.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.560
 In the nomenclature of this kind of study,

26:23.560 --> 26:26.200
 these are the so-called B babies as in the letter B,

26:26.200 --> 26:28.440
 bulldog, B, not for bulldogs,

26:28.440 --> 26:30.960
 but just to designate this category.

26:30.960 --> 26:35.800
 The secure attachment style is one in which the child

26:35.800 --> 26:39.040
 will engage with the stranger, with the experimenter,

26:39.040 --> 26:42.280
 while the parent is present in the room,

26:42.280 --> 26:44.480
 but that when the parent, typically it's a mother,

26:44.480 --> 26:47.840
 but when the parent or other caregiver leaves,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.960
 the child does get visibly upset.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.440
 They might whine, they might cry,

26:51.440 --> 26:53.440
 they might even tantrum a bit.

26:53.440 --> 26:55.840
 However, when the caregiver,

26:55.840 --> 26:59.320
 meaning the mother or father or other caregiver returns,

26:59.320 --> 27:02.240
 the child visibly expresses happiness

27:02.240 --> 27:04.000
 that the caregiver has returned, okay?

27:04.000 --> 27:07.680
 So that's the hallmark of the secure attachment style.

27:07.680 --> 27:09.580
 And again, this is all pre-verbal.

27:09.580 --> 27:11.680
 This is happening long before the child can express

27:11.680 --> 27:13.800
 how they feel with words.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.720
 And the interpretation of this is that the secure child

27:16.720 --> 27:19.640
 feels confident that the caregiver is available

27:19.640 --> 27:22.320
 and will be responsive to their needs

27:22.320 --> 27:24.160
 and their communications,

27:24.160 --> 27:28.120
 so that when the child whines or is distressed,

27:28.120 --> 27:29.860
 the parent doesn't come right back into the room,

27:29.860 --> 27:31.160
 but at some point they do,

27:31.160 --> 27:33.320
 and they seem to have a sense of trust

27:33.320 --> 27:35.520
 that if the parent or caregiver leaves,

27:35.520 --> 27:37.240
 that the parent will come back

27:37.240 --> 27:39.780
 and that they're happy that they do.

27:39.780 --> 27:42.020
 These children are also very good

27:42.020 --> 27:45.300
 at exploring novel environments after the parent is gone

27:45.300 --> 27:46.880
 and while the parent is there.

27:46.880 --> 27:49.540
 And almost always when the parent is there,

27:49.540 --> 27:52.080
 they will explore more broadly, literally in space,

27:52.080 --> 27:54.600
 they'll venture out further than they will

27:54.600 --> 27:55.920
 when the parent is gone.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.520
 They also tend to engage with the caregiver in a way

27:59.520 --> 28:01.840
 that's not immediately and completely trusting,

28:01.840 --> 28:04.280
 but that over time seems to evolve

28:04.280 --> 28:06.340
 from one in which they're kind of suspicious of this person

28:06.340 --> 28:09.880
 to one in which they're at least somewhat trusting, okay?

28:09.880 --> 28:11.940
 So those are the general contours

28:11.940 --> 28:13.680
 of the secure attachment style.

28:13.680 --> 28:14.960
 And fortunately, nowadays,

28:14.960 --> 28:17.160
 there are physiological studies measuring things

28:17.160 --> 28:19.960
 like heart rate and breathing and other measures

28:19.960 --> 28:22.840
 that correlate with the subjective assessment

28:22.840 --> 28:25.040
 of what these children are feeling.

28:25.040 --> 28:27.140
 Okay, so first category is secure attached.

28:27.140 --> 28:30.760
 The second category is a so-called anxious avoidant

28:30.760 --> 28:35.560
 or insecurely attached, which are the category A babies.

28:35.560 --> 28:37.620
 The children with anxious avoidant

28:37.620 --> 28:41.160
 insecure attachment patterns generally tend to avoid

28:41.160 --> 28:43.560
 or ignore the caregiver, all right?

28:43.560 --> 28:47.640
 Meaning the parent and show very little emotion

28:47.640 --> 28:51.240
 when the parent leaves or returns.

28:51.240 --> 28:53.960
 So this is the reason they call them avoidant

28:53.960 --> 28:56.380
 or anxious avoidant and kind of insecure.

28:56.380 --> 28:59.360
 There isn't this happiness or joy that the parent is back.

28:59.360 --> 29:01.280
 They don't seem to express that.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.540
 They do not exhibit distress on separation,

29:04.540 --> 29:08.480
 and they generally tend to have some tendency

29:08.480 --> 29:11.020
 to approach the caregiver when they return,

29:11.020 --> 29:14.280
 but there doesn't seem to be a general expression of joy.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.920
 And again, physiological measures support that as well.

29:16.920 --> 29:20.680
 Things like changes in heart rate tend to be less dramatic

29:20.680 --> 29:24.200
 in the anxious avoidant insecure attachment style

29:24.200 --> 29:25.960
 than in the secure attachment style.

29:25.960 --> 29:27.680
 Okay, so that's the second one.

29:28.720 --> 29:32.400
 The third category is the so-called anxious ambivalent

29:32.400 --> 29:35.400
 slash resistant insecure category.

29:35.400 --> 29:36.720
 Okay, I didn't name these categories,

29:36.720 --> 29:39.800
 so you have to blame others in this one instance.

29:39.800 --> 29:40.760
 For everything else, blame me.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.720
 But in this instance, you have to blame the psychologist

29:43.720 --> 29:44.880
 that named this category.

29:44.880 --> 29:48.680
 The anxious ambivalent slash resistant insecure category,

29:48.680 --> 29:51.000
 also called the C babies,

29:51.000 --> 29:54.020
 for the letter C just as a categorization.

29:54.020 --> 29:58.760
 The anxious ambivalent resistant insecure toddlers really

29:58.760 --> 30:01.920
 show distress even before separation from their mother

30:01.920 --> 30:04.840
 or other caregiver, and they tend to be very clingy

30:04.840 --> 30:08.880
 and difficult to comfort when the caregiver returns.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.240
 Okay, so they're distressed

30:10.240 --> 30:12.160
 even before the mother leaves the room,

30:12.160 --> 30:14.040
 and they tend to be very clingy

30:14.040 --> 30:16.740
 and really hard to calm down when the mother returns.

30:18.220 --> 30:21.560
 They tend to show either what seems to be resentment

30:21.560 --> 30:23.440
 in response to the parent's absence,

30:23.440 --> 30:24.920
 we don't really know what they're feeling,

30:24.920 --> 30:26.940
 or some sort of helpless passivity.

30:26.940 --> 30:28.520
 And there's actually subcategorizations

30:28.520 --> 30:29.840
 that the psychologists have come up with

30:29.840 --> 30:31.920
 with C1 subtypes and C2 subtypes.

30:31.920 --> 30:33.560
 We don't have to get bogged down in that.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.960
 But just know that there isn't one absolute measure

30:36.960 --> 30:40.360
 that says, oh, well, this person is anxious ambivalent,

30:40.360 --> 30:41.620
 resistant, insecure.

30:41.620 --> 30:46.320
 They could be somewhat passive, or they could be somewhat

30:46.320 --> 30:47.720
 angry at the caregiver.

30:47.720 --> 30:52.720
 But the basic idea is that before and after the separation,

30:52.760 --> 30:55.240
 they are clingy and difficult to comfort.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.920
 They just can't seem to calm themselves down

30:56.920 --> 30:58.920
 and physiological measures of heart rate

30:58.920 --> 31:01.000
 and hormone measurements such as cortisol

31:01.000 --> 31:02.800
 also support that statement.

31:02.800 --> 31:05.520
 And the third category of attachment style

31:05.520 --> 31:09.120
 is the so-called disorganized or disoriented or D

31:09.120 --> 31:11.120
 for the letter D babies.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.760
 This is a categorization that was added later

31:13.760 --> 31:16.640
 to this strange situation task that is a real hallmark

31:16.640 --> 31:19.400
 of developmental psychology studies.

31:19.400 --> 31:23.320
 It was developed by Mary Ainsworth graduate student,

31:23.320 --> 31:25.600
 Mary Main, who I actually had the great fortune

31:25.600 --> 31:27.240
 of taking a course from and learning from

31:27.240 --> 31:30.700
 when I was a graduate student at Berkeley many years ago.

31:30.700 --> 31:32.820
 And this fourth categorization was controversial

31:32.820 --> 31:35.760
 for a while, but now is generally accepted.

31:35.760 --> 31:40.160
 The key feature of the disorganized disoriented category

31:40.160 --> 31:43.440
 is that the toddlers tend to be tense

31:43.440 --> 31:45.880
 and they tend to encompass a lot of

31:45.880 --> 31:47.560
 kind of odd physical postures.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.920
 They tend to hunch their shoulders.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.680
 They'll put their hands behind their neck.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.200
 They'll cock their head to the side.

31:54.200 --> 31:55.120
 For those of you listening,

31:55.120 --> 31:56.720
 I'm doing this on the video version.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.980
 It's not where you don't have to go see that.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.440
 But for those of you that are watching this on video,

32:01.440 --> 32:04.320
 they tend to kind of constrain their body size a bit

32:04.320 --> 32:06.500
 and go into odd postures that they normally

32:06.500 --> 32:10.340
 wouldn't do anywhere else.

32:10.340 --> 32:12.480
 So this is why it's called the disorganized

32:12.480 --> 32:15.020
 or disoriented category.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.140
 It seems like these children just don't really know

32:17.140 --> 32:19.080
 how to react to a separation.

32:19.080 --> 32:21.740
 And they just start to manifest behaviors

32:21.740 --> 32:24.080
 and emotional tones that aren't observed

32:24.080 --> 32:25.680
 in other situations.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.800
 Okay, so we've got our four categories.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.500
 I'll try and use the shortest possible names

32:29.500 --> 32:30.340
 for each category.

32:30.340 --> 32:32.640
 We've got category one, which is securely attached.

32:32.640 --> 32:35.720
 We've got category two, which is insecurely attached,

32:35.720 --> 32:38.120
 also sometimes called anxious avoidant.

32:38.120 --> 32:39.520
 Then we've got category three,

32:39.520 --> 32:42.720
 which is the resistant insecure category,

32:42.720 --> 32:44.040
 which is anxious ambivalent.

32:44.040 --> 32:45.840
 And then there's this fourth category,

32:45.840 --> 32:48.420
 the disorganized disoriented category

32:48.420 --> 32:50.920
 where the so-called D babies.

32:50.920 --> 32:54.680
 Now, what's interesting about this from the perspective

32:54.680 --> 32:59.680
 of desire, love and attachment is that the categorizations

32:59.840 --> 33:03.480
 of children into one of these four different categories

33:03.480 --> 33:08.280
 as toddlers is strongly predictive of their attachment style

33:08.280 --> 33:11.280
 in romantic partnerships later in life,

33:11.280 --> 33:14.880
 which is to me both amazing and surprising

33:14.880 --> 33:17.080
 and not surprising all at the same time.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.880
 Amazing because it means that, first of all,

33:20.880 --> 33:23.680
 we are relatively hardwired for attachment.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.640
 I think that that's incredible and beautiful

33:26.640 --> 33:29.680
 that we have designated neurons, nerve cells

33:29.680 --> 33:32.600
 and hormonal systems that are there to ensure

33:32.600 --> 33:34.840
 that we have some sort of response

33:34.840 --> 33:38.000
 to a caregiver being there or not being there

33:38.000 --> 33:40.160
 or returning or leaving,

33:40.160 --> 33:42.800
 but also that the same neural circuitries,

33:42.800 --> 33:45.200
 the same hormonal responses are at least

33:45.200 --> 33:49.360
 in some way repurposed for entirely different types

33:49.360 --> 33:51.260
 of attachments later in life.

33:51.260 --> 33:54.200
 So when we hear the psychologists talk

33:54.200 --> 33:57.680
 about how we formed a template early in life

33:57.680 --> 34:00.080
 based on experiences that were even pre-verbal

34:00.080 --> 34:03.040
 before we had language and those templates

34:03.040 --> 34:05.300
 are superimposed on our relationships,

34:05.300 --> 34:07.380
 or we should say our later relationships

34:07.380 --> 34:09.080
 are superimposed on those templates,

34:09.080 --> 34:10.660
 there really is a basis for that.

34:10.660 --> 34:13.380
 We now have neuroimaging studies to support,

34:13.380 --> 34:16.760
 for instance, the work of Alan Shore from UCLA,

34:16.760 --> 34:20.240
 showing that when a mother and child interact,

34:20.240 --> 34:23.040
 either through very soothing interactions

34:23.040 --> 34:25.160
 like bottle feeding or breastfeeding

34:25.160 --> 34:28.240
 or singing to one's baby or putting them to sleep,

34:28.240 --> 34:31.560
 that the brain of the child and the brain of the mother

34:31.560 --> 34:34.720
 are entering a coordinated state of relaxation.

34:34.720 --> 34:36.920
 And it's not one direction mother to child,

34:36.920 --> 34:39.260
 the child is also calming the mother.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.080
 Typically these studies were done with mothers,

34:42.080 --> 34:45.120
 again, sometimes with fathers, but typically with mothers.

34:45.120 --> 34:46.560
 And in addition to that,

34:46.560 --> 34:50.400
 when the mother or other caregiver acts very excited

34:50.400 --> 34:53.360
 and raises their voice or puts a lilt in their voice

34:53.360 --> 34:56.480
 or widens their eyes, that the child will do the same.

34:56.480 --> 34:59.080
 And again, there's a bidirectional interaction

34:59.080 --> 35:01.120
 in that case of excitement.

35:01.120 --> 35:03.200
 And there's the release of neurochemicals

35:03.200 --> 35:04.760
 like dopamine into the bloodstream,

35:04.760 --> 35:06.600
 whereas in the relaxation scenario

35:06.600 --> 35:08.100
 and the soothing scenario,

35:08.100 --> 35:11.820
 we know the release of things like serotonin and oxytocin.

35:11.820 --> 35:15.500
 So the neural systems for attachment

35:15.500 --> 35:18.880
 and the neural systems for what we call autonomic arousal

35:18.880 --> 35:23.680
 for being alert and calm don't act in a vacuum.

35:23.680 --> 35:26.380
 They are tethered to other people in our environment.

35:26.380 --> 35:27.880
 And of course we know this, right?

35:27.880 --> 35:29.060
 We sometimes hear the statement,

35:29.060 --> 35:30.720
 no one can make you feel anything.

35:30.720 --> 35:31.960
 I've always had a little bit of a problem

35:31.960 --> 35:32.960
 with that statement.

35:33.980 --> 35:36.860
 I don't think I'm contradicting anyone in particular,

35:36.860 --> 35:37.700
 but you hear that a lot.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.400
 No one can make you feel anything.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.600
 Indeed they can, right?

35:40.600 --> 35:43.240
 A physical injury can make you feel something.

35:43.240 --> 35:45.440
 If somebody says something that you very much like,

35:45.440 --> 35:46.680
 it can make you feel something.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.280
 And if somebody says something that you very much dislike,

35:49.280 --> 35:50.560
 it will make you feel something.

35:50.560 --> 35:52.920
 So the idea that no one can make us feel anything

35:52.920 --> 35:54.080
 isn't actually true.

35:54.080 --> 35:57.320
 Our nervous system is tethered to the nervous systems

35:57.320 --> 35:59.120
 of others, and that is true

35:59.120 --> 36:01.520
 from the very earliest stages of our lives.

36:01.520 --> 36:04.280
 And in this case, we're talking about how our templates

36:04.280 --> 36:06.920
 for attachment in romantic relationships,

36:06.920 --> 36:09.240
 how we find them, how we maintain them,

36:09.240 --> 36:11.980
 and indeed how we break them and reform them

36:11.980 --> 36:14.280
 is based on a template that was established

36:14.280 --> 36:16.560
 through an entirely different set of priorities,

36:16.560 --> 36:20.340
 which was how we feel safe and secure in novel environments,

36:20.340 --> 36:22.240
 depending on whether or not our primary caregiver

36:22.240 --> 36:23.220
 is there or not.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.900
 Neuroimaging supports that.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.440
 When I say neuroimaging, I mean brain scans support that,

36:27.440 --> 36:30.100
 measures of hormones in the body and brain support that,

36:30.100 --> 36:32.020
 measures of neurochemicals support that.

36:32.020 --> 36:34.240
 There's simply no way around this truth

36:34.240 --> 36:37.080
 that we have a set of roadmaps in our mind

36:37.080 --> 36:40.280
 that are reused for entirely different purposes

36:40.280 --> 36:41.160
 later in life.

36:41.160 --> 36:43.720
 That is vitally important to understand

36:43.720 --> 36:47.720
 because if one is successful in forming

36:47.720 --> 36:52.720
 romantic attachments, maintaining them, et cetera, or not,

36:52.720 --> 36:55.840
 does in fact reflect the earlier templates

36:55.840 --> 36:57.100
 that you've created.

36:57.100 --> 36:59.500
 But as I've mentioned before, the good news is

36:59.500 --> 37:01.620
 that these templates can shift over time.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.160
 And one of the more powerful ways

37:03.160 --> 37:05.160
 to shift those templates over time

37:05.160 --> 37:07.960
 is purely by the knowledge that they exist

37:07.960 --> 37:11.880
 and the understanding that those templates are malleable.

37:11.880 --> 37:15.600
 They can change through the process of neuroplasticity.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.560
 Again, neuroplasticity is just a rewiring

37:17.560 --> 37:21.720
 of nerve connections that is very much present in childhood,

37:21.720 --> 37:23.920
 but also very much present in adulthood.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.440
 So if you're somebody who you think falls

37:26.440 --> 37:28.680
 into category one, two, three, or four,

37:28.680 --> 37:30.760
 or you know somebody or involved with somebody

37:30.760 --> 37:33.240
 who falls into category one, two, three, and four,

37:34.680 --> 37:37.100
 the mere knowledge of that can be very useful.

37:37.100 --> 37:39.120
 But you might ask, well, what do I do with that knowledge?

37:39.120 --> 37:41.360
 Well, fortunately, both psychologists and biologists

37:41.360 --> 37:43.440
 have started to leverage that knowledge

37:43.440 --> 37:46.520
 toward establishing better, more secure bonds

37:46.520 --> 37:48.280
 in adult romantic relationships.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.240
 And there's a book that has really tapped into this.

37:51.240 --> 37:52.160
 I think it's the first book

37:52.160 --> 37:53.880
 that has really addressed this head on.

37:53.880 --> 37:57.460
 And that book comes from two Columbia professors.

37:58.720 --> 38:01.480
 And the title of the book is Attached,

38:02.620 --> 38:04.360
 The New Science of Adult Attachment

38:04.360 --> 38:07.060
 and How It Can Help You Find and Keep Love.

38:07.060 --> 38:11.160
 The authors of this book are Amir Levine and Rachel Heller.

38:11.160 --> 38:15.000
 Again, both of them are skilled academics and researchers

38:15.000 --> 38:17.660
 who have really taken the literature that I described

38:17.660 --> 38:19.040
 on the strange situation task

38:19.040 --> 38:21.080
 and mapped it to adult attachment styles.

38:21.080 --> 38:23.880
 And also they've mapped out ways

38:23.880 --> 38:26.240
 that they've observed in their clinical practice

38:26.240 --> 38:30.480
 and that is laboratory supported for, for instance,

38:30.480 --> 38:32.540
 people that have an anxious ambivalent

38:32.540 --> 38:34.800
 or what we would call an insecure attachment style,

38:34.800 --> 38:38.200
 or for people that fall into the disorganized

38:38.200 --> 38:39.780
 or disoriented attachment style,

38:39.780 --> 38:42.160
 how they can modify that attachment style

38:42.160 --> 38:44.520
 in or out of relationships

38:44.520 --> 38:47.340
 in order to establish what I think everybody wants,

38:47.340 --> 38:48.860
 which is secure attachment.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.100
 Why does everybody want that?

38:50.100 --> 38:52.000
 Well, secure attachment allows people

38:52.000 --> 38:54.040
 to be both in relationship

38:54.040 --> 38:56.160
 or if they choose to be on their own

38:56.160 --> 38:57.600
 or to be in relationship,

38:57.600 --> 38:59.460
 but physically separated from somebody else

38:59.460 --> 39:01.560
 or even emotionally separated from somebody else

39:01.560 --> 39:05.520
 and maintain what we call a stable autonomic equilibrium.

39:05.520 --> 39:08.280
 The ability to remain calm, clear-headed,

39:08.280 --> 39:09.960
 you might not like what's happening,

39:09.960 --> 39:12.660
 but you're able to navigate that with some sense of clarity

39:12.660 --> 39:14.740
 and not excessive discomfort.

39:14.740 --> 39:17.240
 So is there a goal in all of this stuff

39:17.240 --> 39:19.280
 about love, desire, and attachment?

39:19.280 --> 39:20.580
 Indeed, there is.

39:20.580 --> 39:23.720
 The secure attachment style is the one

39:23.720 --> 39:26.080
 that leads to the most stable

39:26.080 --> 39:28.100
 and predictable long-term relationships.

39:28.100 --> 39:31.960
 Put differently, babies, toddlers, adolescents,

39:31.960 --> 39:35.320
 teens, and young adults that have a secure attachment style

39:35.320 --> 39:38.480
 are more likely to find and form long-term relationships

39:38.480 --> 39:40.760
 than are people in the other categories.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.760
 But people in other categories can learn

39:43.760 --> 39:47.640
 and eventually migrate into the secure attachment style.

39:47.640 --> 39:49.920
 And I think that book attached,

39:49.920 --> 39:52.540
 I have no affiliation to the authors or the book itself,

39:52.540 --> 39:53.920
 I should just mention that,

39:53.920 --> 39:55.720
 attached the new science of adult attachment

39:55.720 --> 39:57.500
 and how it can help you find and keep love.

39:57.500 --> 40:00.740
 Really, it sounds very pop psychology-esque,

40:00.740 --> 40:02.000
 but it is really grounded

40:02.000 --> 40:03.840
 in the research psychology literature,

40:03.840 --> 40:06.920
 and there's also some interesting biology there.

40:06.920 --> 40:09.760
 Another point to make about attachment styles

40:09.760 --> 40:12.320
 is that it is possible,

40:12.320 --> 40:14.900
 and some of you may be familiar with circumstances,

40:14.900 --> 40:18.080
 whereby people who are securely attached,

40:18.080 --> 40:19.880
 either because they grew up in an environment

40:19.880 --> 40:22.060
 where secure attachment was cultivated,

40:22.060 --> 40:24.560
 or because they developed that on their own,

40:24.560 --> 40:28.980
 can also migrate out of the securely attached category

40:28.980 --> 40:30.560
 into insecurely attached

40:30.560 --> 40:34.360
 or into avoidant types of attachment styles

40:34.360 --> 40:36.280
 as teens or as young adults

40:36.280 --> 40:40.720
 or as adults of at any age or any stage of life,

40:40.720 --> 40:43.760
 by virtue of being with somebody who has a different,

40:43.760 --> 40:47.280
 perhaps less adaptive attachment style, right?

40:47.280 --> 40:49.620
 What this means is that if you have

40:49.620 --> 40:51.920
 or you develop a secure attachment style,

40:52.760 --> 40:55.600
 it's vitally important to protect that attachment style

40:55.600 --> 40:58.160
 because it is possible to become anxiously attached

40:58.160 --> 41:01.180
 even if you grew up in a stable attachment framework.

41:01.180 --> 41:03.640
 And again, this can happen at any stage.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.480
 So if you're interested in attachment styles

41:05.480 --> 41:08.680
 and how they influence adult romantic attachments,

41:08.680 --> 41:11.380
 and certainly if you are a parent,

41:11.380 --> 41:14.720
 I would encourage you to check out the book Attached.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.000
 Again, it's quite good,

41:16.000 --> 41:18.760
 and I think that it offers a number of actionable tools

41:18.760 --> 41:22.480
 to both form and hold on to secure attachment styles.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.000
 So I mentioned that the neural circuits

41:24.000 --> 41:28.240
 for child-parent or child-caregiver attachment

41:28.240 --> 41:32.420
 are repurposed for romantic attachment later in life.

41:32.420 --> 41:34.800
 But what are these neural circuits?

41:34.800 --> 41:35.720
 What do they do?

41:35.720 --> 41:39.100
 I mean, it's so attractive, if you will,

41:39.100 --> 41:41.640
 to think about a brain area that controls love

41:41.640 --> 41:43.760
 or a brain area that controls desire

41:43.760 --> 41:45.360
 or a brain area that controls attachment,

41:45.360 --> 41:47.200
 but it simply doesn't work that way.

41:47.200 --> 41:49.480
 As I've talked about before on this podcast,

41:49.480 --> 41:50.800
 and I will say again and again,

41:50.800 --> 41:53.860
 because it will persist to be true long after I'm gone,

41:53.860 --> 41:56.680
 is that no one brain area can give rise

41:56.680 --> 42:01.040
 to anything as complex as desire, love, or attachment.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.300
 Instead, there are multiple brain areas

42:03.300 --> 42:05.520
 that through their coordinated action

42:05.520 --> 42:08.280
 create a sort of a song that we call desire

42:08.280 --> 42:09.920
 or a song that we call love

42:09.920 --> 42:12.920
 or a song that we call attachment, not a literal song,

42:12.920 --> 42:14.260
 although there are songs about desire,

42:14.260 --> 42:16.360
 love, and attachment, of course, many songs,

42:16.360 --> 42:19.120
 some good, some not so good,

42:19.120 --> 42:21.400
 but rather different brain areas

42:21.400 --> 42:23.880
 being active in different sequences

42:23.880 --> 42:26.240
 and with different intensities can make us feel

42:26.240 --> 42:29.480
 as if we are in the mode that we call desire

42:29.480 --> 42:32.560
 or in the mode of love or in the mode of attachment.

42:32.560 --> 42:36.360
 But beneath all of that is this element

42:36.360 --> 42:37.880
 of autonomic arousal.

42:37.880 --> 42:40.400
 And I want to focus on autonomic arousal

42:40.400 --> 42:41.460
 just for a bit longer,

42:41.460 --> 42:45.240
 because it really is one of the three core elements

42:45.240 --> 42:48.640
 by which we form and maintain loving attachments

42:48.640 --> 42:51.380
 and by which we break loving attachments.

42:52.320 --> 42:55.160
 The autonomic nervous system, as the name suggests,

42:55.160 --> 42:57.060
 is automatic.

42:57.060 --> 42:59.040
 In fact, that's what autonomic means.

42:59.040 --> 43:01.040
 Now, it's actually the case

43:01.040 --> 43:02.880
 that we can control our autonomic nervous system

43:02.880 --> 43:04.140
 to some degree or another,

43:04.140 --> 43:05.560
 but the autonomic nervous system

43:05.560 --> 43:09.360
 controls things like digestion, our breathing,

43:09.360 --> 43:12.080
 whether or not we're conscious of that breathing or not.

43:12.080 --> 43:14.200
 It controls things like how alert we are

43:14.200 --> 43:15.920
 or how sleepy we are.

43:15.920 --> 43:18.080
 And the autonomic nervous system,

43:18.080 --> 43:19.920
 as I just briefly described earlier,

43:19.920 --> 43:22.680
 is really something that we come into the world with.

43:22.680 --> 43:23.640
 It's hardwired.

43:23.640 --> 43:25.440
 All the elements are there,

43:25.440 --> 43:28.440
 but through interactions with our parent,

43:28.440 --> 43:32.760
 either soothing interactions or fun, playful interactions,

43:32.760 --> 43:35.480
 or dare I say, scary interactions,

43:35.480 --> 43:38.720
 our autonomic nervous system gets tuned up,

43:38.720 --> 43:41.560
 meaning we each develop a tendency

43:41.560 --> 43:44.920
 to either be more alert and anxious or more calm

43:44.920 --> 43:47.040
 or kind of a balance of alert and calm.

43:47.040 --> 43:49.040
 Now, of course, this changes across each day,

43:49.040 --> 43:50.180
 and depending how tired we are,

43:50.180 --> 43:51.640
 late in the day, if we've been awake for a while,

43:51.640 --> 43:52.740
 we tend to get sleepy.

43:52.740 --> 43:54.160
 Early in the day, if we're very rested,

43:54.160 --> 43:56.280
 we tend to wake up and feel very alert.

43:56.280 --> 43:58.040
 So the way to think about the autonomic nervous system

43:58.040 --> 43:59.480
 is it's kind of a seesaw.

43:59.480 --> 44:02.120
 We go back and forth between being very alert.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.760
 We can be alert and calm, or we can be very, very alert.

44:04.760 --> 44:06.220
 We can be in a state of panic.

44:06.220 --> 44:09.200
 We can be fast asleep, so we can be extremely calm,

44:09.200 --> 44:13.040
 or we can just be kind of sleepy, semi-calm,

44:13.040 --> 44:14.880
 but still also alert.

44:14.880 --> 44:17.000
 So think about it like a seesaw.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.940
 And that seesaw has a hinge,

44:19.940 --> 44:23.240
 and that hinge defines how tight or loose that seesaw is,

44:23.240 --> 44:26.080
 how readily it can tilt back and forth.

44:26.080 --> 44:30.120
 Our autonomic tone is how tight that hinge is.

44:30.120 --> 44:32.140
 And there are biological mechanisms to explain this,

44:32.140 --> 44:33.760
 but here, I just want to stay with the analogy

44:33.760 --> 44:35.020
 of the seesaw for now.

44:36.680 --> 44:41.680
 The interactions between child and caregiver early in life

44:41.860 --> 44:44.240
 take the child and the caregiver

44:44.240 --> 44:47.000
 from one end of the seesaw to the other,

44:47.000 --> 44:50.120
 from being very alert in a state of play, for instance,

44:50.120 --> 44:53.980
 to being nursed and being very soothed until we go to sleep.

44:53.980 --> 44:55.940
 And of course, we each have a seesaw.

44:55.940 --> 44:57.320
 The parent and the child has a seesaw,

44:57.320 --> 44:58.160
 and they're interacting.

44:58.160 --> 44:59.360
 What do I mean by that?

44:59.360 --> 45:02.940
 Well, there are beautiful studies and beautiful,

45:02.940 --> 45:05.240
 not in the sense that they focused on a pleasant topic,

45:05.240 --> 45:08.400
 but beautiful because they were done so beautifully well,

45:08.400 --> 45:09.980
 that looked at, for instance,

45:09.980 --> 45:13.740
 the response of mothers and their physiologies

45:13.740 --> 45:16.840
 and the response of children and their physiologies

45:16.840 --> 45:19.520
 during the bombing of cities during World War II,

45:19.520 --> 45:21.500
 so an unpleasant situation.

45:21.500 --> 45:25.100
 But what was revealed during the course of these studies

45:25.100 --> 45:28.720
 was that if the mothers were very stressed

45:28.720 --> 45:31.540
 during an onslaught of bombing of the city,

45:31.540 --> 45:34.880
 the children's physiologies tended to be stressed also

45:34.880 --> 45:37.440
 and persisted in being stressed

45:37.440 --> 45:41.560
 long after that stressful episode was done.

45:41.560 --> 45:43.640
 They actually followed that these children

45:43.640 --> 45:47.360
 well out for many decades afterwards.

45:47.360 --> 45:50.800
 Conversely, if the parent, and in this case, again,

45:50.800 --> 45:53.700
 it was mothers that were explored in these studies,

45:53.700 --> 45:55.460
 had turned this whole business

45:55.460 --> 45:57.160
 of going into the bomb shelters

45:57.160 --> 46:00.040
 into somewhat of a game, taking it seriously,

46:00.040 --> 46:01.680
 but essentially telling the children,

46:01.680 --> 46:02.500
 okay, it's time to go,

46:02.500 --> 46:05.800
 but not expressing much stress or distress.

46:05.800 --> 46:07.080
 The children also didn't develop

46:07.080 --> 46:09.360
 much stress or distress or trauma.

46:09.360 --> 46:10.940
 Now, there were exceptions to this, of course,

46:10.940 --> 46:12.480
 but in general, that was the rule

46:12.480 --> 46:14.860
 that the autonomic nervous systems of children

46:14.860 --> 46:16.880
 tend to mimic the autonomic nervous systems

46:16.880 --> 46:18.760
 of the primary caregiver.

46:18.760 --> 46:22.580
 And the mechanisms by which this occurs has been explored.

46:22.580 --> 46:24.380
 And again, I just referred to the beautiful work

46:24.380 --> 46:28.120
 of Alan Shore at University of California, Los Angeles.

46:28.120 --> 46:32.240
 And then again, his name is Shore, spelled S-C-H-O-R-E.

46:32.240 --> 46:33.880
 I'm looking down briefly at the floor here

46:33.880 --> 46:36.560
 because I'll just reach for the book.

46:36.560 --> 46:39.700
 He has a wonderful book called Right Brain Psychotherapy.

46:39.700 --> 46:40.720
 It's a little bit technical,

46:40.720 --> 46:43.180
 but if you're interested in some of the studies,

46:43.180 --> 46:44.940
 this book, Right Brain Psychotherapy,

46:44.940 --> 46:48.360
 details how everything from nursing of children

46:48.360 --> 46:50.300
 to playtime behavior,

46:50.300 --> 46:52.820
 to strange situation type task behavior

46:52.820 --> 46:53.660
 that we talked about before,

46:53.660 --> 46:56.100
 which of course occurs when children get dropped off

46:56.100 --> 46:59.560
 at daycare or nursery school or with babysitters, et cetera.

46:59.560 --> 47:04.040
 And indeed, all types of caregiver-child interactions

47:04.040 --> 47:06.860
 tune up that autonomic nervous system

47:06.860 --> 47:10.180
 so that the child ends up with an autonomic nervous system

47:10.180 --> 47:14.680
 that either tends to lean more towards alert and anxious

47:14.680 --> 47:16.540
 or can be very alert but calm

47:16.540 --> 47:18.420
 or can be very calm and hard to budge.

47:18.420 --> 47:20.780
 Again, it's the tightness of that hinge

47:20.780 --> 47:23.740
 that really underlies these attachment styles

47:23.740 --> 47:25.220
 that we were talking about earlier.

47:25.220 --> 47:27.980
 And not on this episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

47:27.980 --> 47:29.580
 but on many other previous episodes,

47:29.580 --> 47:31.700
 such as the Master Stress episode

47:31.700 --> 47:34.620
 or some of the Optimize Health episodes.

47:34.620 --> 47:36.940
 You can find these if you want at hubermanlab.com.

47:36.940 --> 47:40.180
 A lot of the tools and techniques that are recommended there

47:40.180 --> 47:43.860
 have to do with readjusting the autonomic nervous system

47:43.860 --> 47:45.540
 in deliberate ways as an adult.

47:45.540 --> 47:48.560
 Again, I won't go into the specific tools,

47:48.560 --> 47:52.620
 but for instance, the physiological sigh,

47:52.620 --> 47:55.140
 this tool that I've talked about extensively

47:55.140 --> 47:58.220
 of two inhales through the nose as deeply as you can

47:58.220 --> 47:59.060
 on the first one,

47:59.060 --> 48:00.860
 sneaking in a little bit more air on the second one,

48:00.860 --> 48:02.860
 and then a long exhale through the mouth

48:02.860 --> 48:05.660
 is a way of adjusting that autonomic seesaw.

48:05.660 --> 48:07.300
 It tends to make us more calm.

48:07.300 --> 48:10.420
 It activates what we call the parasympathetic arm

48:10.420 --> 48:11.840
 of the autonomic nervous system,

48:11.840 --> 48:13.220
 which is just fancy nerd speak

48:13.220 --> 48:16.260
 for it's a quick way to calm yourself down, right?

48:16.260 --> 48:20.640
 Things like ice baths or cold showers or cold immersion

48:20.640 --> 48:24.580
 or hyperventilate hyperventilation by contrast

48:24.580 --> 48:27.840
 are ways in which we can deliberately increase

48:27.840 --> 48:30.540
 the level of our so-called sympathetic arm

48:30.540 --> 48:32.820
 of our autonomic nervous system to make ourselves more alert.

48:32.820 --> 48:33.860
 Why would you want to do that?

48:33.860 --> 48:35.800
 Well, you can do that to be more alert,

48:35.800 --> 48:37.260
 to be more awake if you like,

48:37.260 --> 48:40.460
 or as a form of self-induced stress inoculation

48:40.460 --> 48:43.740
 to be able to tolerate higher levels of adrenaline

48:43.740 --> 48:46.320
 by making it a practice that you self-direct.

48:47.360 --> 48:51.460
 The reason those tools are out there is because many of us,

48:51.460 --> 48:54.340
 for whatever reason, we don't have to blame anyone,

48:54.340 --> 48:56.840
 but because of our childhood templates,

48:56.840 --> 48:58.740
 because of things that happened and didn't happen

48:58.740 --> 49:00.740
 in terms of our interactions with caregivers,

49:00.740 --> 49:02.740
 have autonomic nervous systems that are tilted

49:02.740 --> 49:05.380
 to one side or the other more than we would like,

49:05.380 --> 49:09.140
 or in which the hinge that I'm talking about

49:09.140 --> 49:13.020
 in this analogy is too loose or that is too tight,

49:13.020 --> 49:14.980
 and we're sort of stuck in a mode of anxiousness

49:14.980 --> 49:17.140
 or stuck in a mode of lack of energy.

49:17.140 --> 49:19.520
 That's what those tools are really about.

49:19.520 --> 49:24.520
 But at a deeper level, the autonomic nervous system

49:24.620 --> 49:27.860
 is really the system that governs how we will react

49:27.860 --> 49:32.860
 in response to a romantic partner being present or leaving.

49:33.380 --> 49:35.640
 And I don't necessarily mean leaving the relationship

49:35.640 --> 49:37.740
 entirely, although it could mean that, right?

49:37.740 --> 49:39.620
 We know people, I'm sure you know people,

49:39.620 --> 49:42.080
 that upon the end of a relationship

49:42.080 --> 49:44.940
 that they wanted very much are absolutely crushed.

49:44.940 --> 49:47.540
 And actually in researching this episode there,

49:47.540 --> 49:50.180
 I discovered there's an extensive literature finding

49:50.180 --> 49:53.960
 that the feelings that one has after a breakup

49:53.960 --> 49:57.300
 are very much like a clinical depression in many cases.

49:57.300 --> 49:59.820
 But there are individuals that can look at a breakup

49:59.820 --> 50:03.300
 as a transient event that they don't interpret

50:03.300 --> 50:07.220
 as going to mean so much for all aspects of their life

50:07.220 --> 50:09.600
 or reshaping their view of themselves.

50:09.600 --> 50:10.440
 Why?

50:10.440 --> 50:14.120
 Well, we have different levels of autonomic function.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.760
 And depending on where our seesaw is, if you will,

50:17.760 --> 50:20.060
 some of us become extremely distraught

50:20.060 --> 50:21.780
 and can't recalibrate ourselves,

50:21.780 --> 50:25.340
 can't adjust ourselves down from stress to calm,

50:25.340 --> 50:28.700
 or can't take ourselves from exhausted to more alert

50:28.700 --> 50:30.420
 if we need to do that on our own.

50:30.420 --> 50:32.820
 And so that's why tools for doing that exist.

50:32.820 --> 50:37.700
 But attachment itself is about where

50:37.700 --> 50:39.700
 our autonomic nervous system resides.

50:39.700 --> 50:42.780
 So if I were to offer a set of tools around these topics

50:42.780 --> 50:44.620
 of desire, love, and attachment,

50:44.620 --> 50:46.340
 I would say, first of all, you might want to think about

50:46.340 --> 50:48.700
 whether or not you fall into the secure, insecure

50:48.700 --> 50:51.340
 or other attachment styles.

50:51.340 --> 50:55.340
 Second, I think it is vitally important for all of us,

50:55.340 --> 50:58.120
 but certainly for people that are in relationships

50:58.120 --> 51:01.420
 or seeking relationships to be able to at least

51:01.420 --> 51:05.420
 have some recognition of where our autonomic nervous system

51:05.420 --> 51:08.900
 tends to reside, both in terms of when we are with somebody

51:08.900 --> 51:10.380
 and when they leave.

51:10.380 --> 51:12.300
 When we are apart for long periods of time,

51:12.300 --> 51:13.280
 can we calm ourselves?

51:13.280 --> 51:14.860
 Can we self-soothe?

51:14.860 --> 51:17.940
 Or are we very much dependent on the presence of another

51:17.940 --> 51:19.460
 in order to feel soothed?

51:19.460 --> 51:21.900
 Now, I absolutely want to emphasize

51:21.900 --> 51:23.340
 that there is nothing wrong.

51:23.340 --> 51:26.140
 In fact, there's everything right with feeling great

51:26.140 --> 51:27.540
 in the presence of somebody else.

51:27.540 --> 51:31.420
 That is actually a hallmark of strong and quality

51:31.420 --> 51:32.260
 attachments.

51:32.260 --> 51:34.860
 These days, we hear the term codependent a lot.

51:34.860 --> 51:37.160
 This was a, I believe the term was first coined

51:37.160 --> 51:39.780
 by Pia Mellody, and it actually does occupy

51:39.780 --> 51:44.520
 an important role in the world of trauma, trauma healing,

51:44.520 --> 51:47.160
 so-called trauma bonding, topics of another episode.

51:47.160 --> 51:48.900
 I actually did an episode on fear and trauma,

51:48.900 --> 51:51.240
 and we will do one all about trauma bonding with an expert

51:51.240 --> 51:52.900
 at some point in the future.

51:52.900 --> 51:56.220
 But codependence and codependency,

51:56.220 --> 51:59.660
 the term can sometimes be misinterpreted

51:59.660 --> 52:03.500
 as any dependence on another isn't good.

52:03.500 --> 52:07.060
 Interdependence, healthy interdependence, of course, is good.

52:07.060 --> 52:09.700
 It is the hallmark of healthy child-parent relations,

52:09.700 --> 52:12.500
 sibling relations, and romantic relations.

52:12.500 --> 52:16.460
 But a key element of healthy interdependence is that,

52:16.460 --> 52:19.180
 yes, our autonomic nervous system is adjusted

52:19.180 --> 52:20.780
 by the presence of another,

52:20.780 --> 52:22.460
 but that also that we can adjust

52:22.460 --> 52:24.020
 our own autonomic nervous system

52:24.020 --> 52:26.380
 even in the absence of that person.

52:26.380 --> 52:30.140
 That if the person goes away temporarily or permanently,

52:30.140 --> 52:33.600
 that we can still regulate our own autonomic nervous system,

52:33.600 --> 52:35.900
 both from states of stress to states of calm,

52:35.900 --> 52:40.340
 both from states of exhaustion to states of more alertness.

52:40.340 --> 52:41.620
 And of course, we all need sleep

52:41.620 --> 52:43.820
 to go from exhaustion to alertness.

52:43.820 --> 52:46.860
 But what I'm referring to here is the ability to regulate

52:46.860 --> 52:51.520
 when distraught or regulate when fatigued

52:51.520 --> 52:52.820
 or feeling depressed.

52:52.820 --> 52:56.980
 And that is and is all about the autonomic nervous system.

52:56.980 --> 52:58.660
 So as we talk about attachment styles

52:58.660 --> 53:00.860
 and we talk about infant and toddler

53:00.860 --> 53:01.920
 and adult attachment styles,

53:01.920 --> 53:03.880
 what we are really talking about

53:03.880 --> 53:05.780
 is a complex set of neural circuitries.

53:05.780 --> 53:07.760
 And one of those neural circuitries,

53:07.760 --> 53:09.020
 which is absolutely crucial,

53:09.020 --> 53:11.020
 is this autonomic nervous system.

53:11.020 --> 53:14.780
 So if the autonomic nervous system is one key component

53:14.780 --> 53:18.840
 of desire, love, and attachment, what are the other two?

53:18.840 --> 53:20.860
 And what I'm going to tell you next

53:20.860 --> 53:24.620
 is largely the pioneering work of Helen Fisher,

53:24.620 --> 53:26.640
 who is really an anthropologist

53:26.640 --> 53:28.580
 who's become a bit of a neuroscientist

53:28.580 --> 53:30.740
 and has collaborated with neuroscientists

53:30.740 --> 53:33.460
 to establish brain areas and neural circuits

53:33.460 --> 53:35.180
 that are associated with different aspects

53:35.180 --> 53:36.980
 of attachment, love, and desire.

53:36.980 --> 53:39.660
 I think the first really high quality study

53:39.660 --> 53:42.700
 of neural circuits associated with these themes

53:42.700 --> 53:45.540
 was a paper published in 2005

53:45.540 --> 53:47.740
 in a very fine anatomical journal,

53:47.740 --> 53:50.420
 perhaps the best neuroanatomical journal,

53:50.420 --> 53:53.220
 which is the Journal of Comparative Neurology.

53:53.220 --> 53:54.480
 The Journal of Comparative Neurology

53:54.480 --> 53:56.780
 has been around for more than a hundred years

53:56.780 --> 53:59.940
 and is considered the archival location

53:59.940 --> 54:02.740
 for placing really high quality anatomy.

54:02.740 --> 54:04.580
 They have tremendously high standards.

54:04.580 --> 54:06.740
 And the study that I'm referring to

54:06.740 --> 54:09.460
 is entitled romantic love and FMRI,

54:09.460 --> 54:12.500
 meaning functional magnetic resonance imaging study

54:12.500 --> 54:14.860
 of a neural mechanism for mate choice.

54:14.860 --> 54:19.100
 And Dr. Fisher is a author on this paper,

54:19.100 --> 54:21.940
 as is Arthur Aaron and Lucy Brown.

54:21.940 --> 54:23.980
 So all very fine researchers.

54:23.980 --> 54:27.540
 And this study, as well as several other studies

54:27.540 --> 54:30.500
 using magnetic resonance imaging,

54:30.500 --> 54:33.700
 things like EEG, neuroanatomical tracing, et cetera,

54:33.700 --> 54:35.660
 have identified a large number of brain areas

54:35.660 --> 54:37.100
 that are associated with different aspects

54:37.100 --> 54:38.500
 of desire, love, and attachment.

54:38.500 --> 54:40.620
 And I'll just throw out a few names of those brain areas

54:40.620 --> 54:41.580
 and what they control.

54:41.580 --> 54:43.860
 And then I'll tell you how those anchor

54:43.860 --> 54:46.380
 to the other two categories of neural circuits

54:46.380 --> 54:48.540
 essential for desire, love, and attachment.

54:48.540 --> 54:53.340
 So not surprisingly, the dopamine system in the brain

54:53.340 --> 54:55.880
 is associated with desire, love, and attachment,

54:55.880 --> 54:58.720
 and mainly with desire, although to some extent love.

54:58.720 --> 55:00.900
 Dopamine is a neurochemical sometimes associated

55:00.900 --> 55:05.100
 with reward, but as some of you have heard me say before,

55:05.100 --> 55:09.620
 it is mainly a molecule of motivation, craving, and pursuit.

55:09.620 --> 55:11.940
 And that motivation, craving, and pursuit

55:11.940 --> 55:14.100
 that relates to dopamine is not unique

55:14.100 --> 55:17.020
 to attachment or love or sex or mating, et cetera.

55:17.020 --> 55:20.840
 It is a universal generic currency in the brain

55:20.840 --> 55:22.300
 for pursuing something.

55:22.300 --> 55:25.300
 Food when you're hungry, a mate when you want one,

55:25.300 --> 55:27.060
 two mate when you want two,

55:27.940 --> 55:30.200
 warmth when you're cold, et cetera, et cetera, okay?

55:30.200 --> 55:31.940
 So it's not for one specific purpose,

55:31.940 --> 55:35.960
 but the brain areas associated with dopamine involve,

55:35.960 --> 55:38.540
 for instance, the ventral tegmental area,

55:38.540 --> 55:42.860
 the substantia nigra, areas of that sort, the basal ganglia.

55:42.860 --> 55:44.020
 You don't need to know these names,

55:44.020 --> 55:46.540
 just understand that these are networks of neurons

55:46.540 --> 55:49.100
 that tend to put the person, you,

55:49.100 --> 55:51.660
 into a state of forward action and pursuit

55:51.660 --> 55:53.980
 and craving and motivation.

55:53.980 --> 55:57.140
 They are not about being quiescent, relaxed, et cetera.

55:57.140 --> 56:01.740
 The neural circuits for quiescence and relaxation

56:01.740 --> 56:04.740
 are most associated with love and attachment,

56:04.740 --> 56:07.900
 not surprisingly, and they're the neurochemical serotonin

56:07.900 --> 56:09.780
 and to some extent oxytocin

56:09.780 --> 56:12.260
 are the predominant neurochemicals involved.

56:12.260 --> 56:13.800
 And those are released from brain areas

56:13.800 --> 56:16.460
 such as the raphe nucleus in the back of the brain.

56:16.460 --> 56:18.780
 You may have heard that the majority of serotonin

56:18.780 --> 56:22.060
 in your body is made in your gut, and indeed that's true,

56:22.060 --> 56:23.580
 but I hate to break it to you,

56:23.580 --> 56:27.060
 the serotonin in your gut is not responsible

56:27.060 --> 56:28.740
 for your feelings of love and attachment,

56:28.740 --> 56:30.120
 at least not to a high degree.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.760
 That's mainly going to be the reflection of neurons

56:32.760 --> 56:35.100
 in your brain that make serotonin.

56:35.100 --> 56:36.540
 And there are other areas of the brain

56:36.540 --> 56:39.960
 that make serotonin as well and oxytocin as well,

56:39.960 --> 56:41.020
 but they tend to be associated

56:41.020 --> 56:43.180
 with the kind of warmth and calm

56:43.180 --> 56:45.380
 and the soothing that we feel

56:45.380 --> 56:46.540
 in the presence of another.

56:46.540 --> 56:49.940
 And again, these are not strictly divided circuits.

56:49.940 --> 56:51.900
 We can have dopamine and serotonin present

56:51.900 --> 56:53.700
 in our brain and body at the same time

56:53.700 --> 56:56.020
 to equal or different degrees.

56:56.020 --> 56:58.320
 And we will return in a little bit to what happens

56:58.320 --> 57:00.220
 when levels of dopamine are very high

57:00.220 --> 57:03.140
 and levels of serotonin are low and vice versa and so on,

57:03.140 --> 57:08.140
 including in states of neurochemically modified states

57:08.340 --> 57:11.620
 as it were in when we talk about things like MDMA,

57:11.620 --> 57:13.420
 so-called ecstasy.

57:13.420 --> 57:16.920
 But in the meantime, I want to just discuss

57:16.920 --> 57:20.480
 the two neural circuits that use dopamine,

57:20.480 --> 57:22.740
 that use serotonin and oxytocin,

57:22.740 --> 57:26.100
 and that collaborate with the autonomic nervous system

57:26.100 --> 57:29.320
 to drive what we call desire, love, and attachment.

57:29.320 --> 57:33.740
 And the three circuits are autonomic nervous system,

57:33.740 --> 57:35.280
 we talked about that one.

57:35.280 --> 57:37.880
 Then there's the nervous system components

57:37.880 --> 57:40.040
 or the neural circuits for empathy,

57:40.040 --> 57:43.660
 for being able to see and respond to

57:43.660 --> 57:46.700
 and indeed match the emotional tone

57:46.700 --> 57:49.460
 or the autonomic tone of another.

57:49.460 --> 57:51.180
 And then there's the third category,

57:51.180 --> 57:52.340
 and this might surprise some of you,

57:52.340 --> 57:53.760
 it certainly surprised me,

57:53.760 --> 57:55.380
 but the data point to the fact

57:55.380 --> 57:56.860
 that the third neural circuit

57:56.860 --> 57:59.820
 that's very important for establishing bonds

57:59.820 --> 58:02.740
 is one associated with positive delusions.

58:02.740 --> 58:04.500
 So given that the neural circuits for empathy

58:04.500 --> 58:07.420
 are absolutely crucial for falling in love

58:07.420 --> 58:10.300
 and maintaining stable attachments,

58:10.300 --> 58:11.740
 I'd like to talk about those neural circuits

58:11.740 --> 58:13.260
 and what they are.

58:13.260 --> 58:15.140
 Now, often when we hear empathy,

58:15.140 --> 58:18.500
 we think, oh, empathy is really about listening to

58:18.500 --> 58:21.580
 and really understanding what somebody else is feeling,

58:21.580 --> 58:23.940
 maybe even feeling what they're feeling.

58:23.940 --> 58:25.460
 And indeed that's the case,

58:25.460 --> 58:27.540
 but what do we mean by that, right?

58:27.540 --> 58:29.820
 What is it to feel what another feels?

58:29.820 --> 58:33.140
 Well, what it means is that their seesaw

58:33.140 --> 58:37.600
 is driving your seesaw or your seesaw

58:37.600 --> 58:39.660
 is somehow driving their seesaw,

58:39.660 --> 58:42.620
 that there's a match in terms of the tilt of those seesaws.

58:42.620 --> 58:44.620
 Now, it doesn't have to be an exact match, right?

58:44.620 --> 58:47.620
 If someone that you really care about is very, very stressed,

58:48.620 --> 58:50.300
 you could also become very stressed.

58:50.300 --> 58:53.020
 That's a form of empathic matching,

58:53.020 --> 58:54.700
 and there are indeed neural circuits for that.

58:54.700 --> 58:57.180
 I'll describe what those neural circuits are in a moment,

58:57.180 --> 58:59.660
 but sometimes the best role for us to take

58:59.660 --> 59:02.540
 is actually one in which we are calm

59:02.540 --> 59:03.820
 when the person that we care about

59:03.820 --> 59:05.720
 or that we are romantically involved with

59:05.720 --> 59:07.060
 is very, very anxious.

59:07.060 --> 59:08.380
 And in a few minutes,

59:08.380 --> 59:11.140
 I'll talk about how matching of emotional tone

59:11.140 --> 59:14.840
 can be good or bad for the stability of a relationship.

59:16.160 --> 59:19.880
 And complementarity of autonomic matching

59:19.880 --> 59:21.340
 can be good or bad.

59:21.340 --> 59:22.380
 In other words,

59:22.380 --> 59:25.300
 sometimes it's beneficial for a relationship

59:25.300 --> 59:27.900
 to go into the same state as the other.

59:27.900 --> 59:29.900
 And sometimes it's more beneficial for us

59:29.900 --> 59:33.660
 to not go into the same state as the other.

59:33.660 --> 59:35.900
 But the important feature here

59:35.900 --> 59:39.020
 is that when we talk about emotional matching or empathy

59:39.020 --> 59:40.300
 or going into the same state

59:40.300 --> 59:41.740
 or not going into the same state,

59:41.740 --> 59:43.340
 what we're really talking about

59:43.340 --> 59:48.340
 is whether or not the autonomic seesaw of one individual

59:48.540 --> 59:52.180
 is driving the autonomic seesaw of the other individual.

59:52.180 --> 59:54.500
 And this is a vital principle

59:54.500 --> 59:57.540
 for how we fall in love and form attachments.

59:57.540 --> 1:00:00.420
 And it's actually part of the desire and mating process

1:00:00.420 --> 1:00:01.260
 itself.

1:00:02.660 --> 1:00:04.420
 I would go so far as to say

1:00:04.420 --> 1:00:07.740
 that one of the prerequisites

1:00:07.740 --> 1:00:11.840
 to the propagation and expansion of our species

1:00:11.840 --> 1:00:15.440
 is this notion of autonomic regulation

1:00:15.440 --> 1:00:18.720
 and to some extent matching of autonomic nervous systems.

1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:20.900
 Let me explain what I mean.

1:00:20.900 --> 1:00:22.320
 Last I checked,

1:00:22.320 --> 1:00:24.680
 the only way that new humans can be created

1:00:24.680 --> 1:00:27.060
 is by way of sperm meeting egg,

1:00:27.060 --> 1:00:29.800
 either in body or in dish,

1:00:29.800 --> 1:00:31.220
 but sperm meets egg.

1:00:31.220 --> 1:00:33.940
 And then typically nine months later,

1:00:33.940 --> 1:00:35.100
 we have a human baby.

1:00:36.480 --> 1:00:39.360
 The process of bringing sperm to egg,

1:00:40.500 --> 1:00:43.060
 mating behavior, sex behavior in humans

1:00:43.060 --> 1:00:46.640
 is one of autonomic regulation.

1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:49.740
 And what I mean by that is

1:00:50.780 --> 1:00:54.140
 the process of finding a mate.

1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:54.980
 And in this case,

1:00:54.980 --> 1:00:57.140
 there's actually someone to mate with typically,

1:00:57.140 --> 1:00:58.240
 while scenarios vary,

1:00:58.240 --> 1:01:03.080
 typically is one of elevated autonomic arousal,

1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:04.900
 meaning increased activation

1:01:04.900 --> 1:01:07.060
 of the so-called sympathetic nervous system.

1:01:07.060 --> 1:01:09.140
 This is related to dopamine release

1:01:09.140 --> 1:01:11.300
 and it's related to epinephrine release.

1:01:11.300 --> 1:01:13.100
 There has to be a pursuit

1:01:13.100 --> 1:01:16.260
 or at least there has to be a mobilization

1:01:16.260 --> 1:01:20.360
 to arrive in the same location whereby one can mate.

1:01:20.360 --> 1:01:22.500
 That almost always is the case.

1:01:22.500 --> 1:01:27.500
 However, the sexual arousal itself

1:01:28.560 --> 1:01:31.800
 is in both males and females

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:34.600
 is actually driven primarily

1:01:34.600 --> 1:01:38.980
 by the parasympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system.

1:01:38.980 --> 1:01:42.720
 So while pursuit is one of alertness

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:45.420
 and sympathetic drive, as we say,

1:01:45.420 --> 1:01:48.200
 again, sympathy is not really what's at play here,

1:01:48.200 --> 1:01:49.980
 that the word simpa means together

1:01:49.980 --> 1:01:52.480
 and the activation of the autonomic nervous system

1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:53.780
 toward more alert state

1:01:53.780 --> 1:01:55.800
 is because of a sympathetic nervous system,

1:01:55.800 --> 1:01:57.720
 meaning the co-activation together

1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:00.320
 of many neurons in the brain and spinal cord.

1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:04.480
 But then the actual physiological arousal state

1:02:04.480 --> 1:02:05.840
 that we call sexual arousal

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:09.960
 is predominantly parasympathetically driven, okay?

1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:11.400
 To be quite direct about this,

1:02:11.400 --> 1:02:14.320
 if the sympathetic nervous system activation is too high,

1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:16.560
 the sexual arousal response cannot happen

1:02:16.560 --> 1:02:20.120
 in either males or in females, it's inhibited.

1:02:20.120 --> 1:02:25.000
 However, the orgasm and ejaculation response,

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.720
 which if you think about it is required

1:02:27.720 --> 1:02:32.720
 for sperm to meet egg is sympathetic driven.

1:02:34.460 --> 1:02:37.380
 And then after orgasm and ejaculation,

1:02:37.380 --> 1:02:40.040
 the parasympathetic nervous system kicks back in

1:02:40.040 --> 1:02:42.320
 and there's a calming and relaxation.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:47.320
 So the arc of mating involves sympathetic arousal, okay?

1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:52.240
 Not sympathy, but alertness and arousal for pursuit.

1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:53.920
 Then a tilt of the seesaw,

1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:57.160
 at least to some degree for arousal of the sort

1:02:57.160 --> 1:03:00.000
 that we typically hear of, of sexual arousal.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.640
 Then at the point of orgasm and ejaculation

1:03:03.640 --> 1:03:06.200
 is back to a sympathetic response.

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:07.400
 And how can I say that?

1:03:07.400 --> 1:03:08.640
 How do I know that?

1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:10.380
 The sympathetic nervous system,

1:03:10.380 --> 1:03:12.280
 meaning neurons within the sympathetic arm

1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:13.560
 of the autonomic nervous system

1:03:13.560 --> 1:03:17.400
 are what drive ejaculation and orgasm.

1:03:17.400 --> 1:03:20.800
 And then afterward, there's a return

1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:24.000
 to increased parasympathetic activation.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.600
 And we don't know for sure why that happens,

1:03:26.600 --> 1:03:30.720
 but it's thought that in species that pair bond,

1:03:30.720 --> 1:03:33.000
 humans generally pair bond, not always,

1:03:34.260 --> 1:03:36.920
 the return to more parasympathetic activation

1:03:36.920 --> 1:03:39.840
 after orgasm and ejaculation is thought to increase

1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:43.120
 the exchange of pheromonal odors, excuse me,

1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:45.640
 and to increase pillow talk and pair bonding

1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:47.240
 of different kinds, okay?

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:51.440
 So that's the seesaw going back and forth

1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:53.500
 is actually built into the process

1:03:53.500 --> 1:03:57.100
 by which our entire species propagates.

1:03:57.100 --> 1:04:01.620
 So in some ways, every human is required

1:04:01.620 --> 1:04:03.320
 to navigate that process

1:04:03.320 --> 1:04:05.320
 if they want their offspring to persist.

1:04:05.320 --> 1:04:07.600
 And of course, nowadays there are technologies

1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:12.600
 like in vitro fertilization and intrauterine insemination.

1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:13.800
 There are a variety of ways

1:04:13.800 --> 1:04:15.360
 that technology has allowed people

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:17.880
 to circumvent the actual physical mating process

1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:19.140
 in the way that I described.

1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:21.700
 But by and large, that's the way it's done,

1:04:21.700 --> 1:04:23.900
 and certainly that's the way it was done historically

1:04:23.900 --> 1:04:25.700
 for if not tens of thousands

1:04:25.700 --> 1:04:27.760
 or hundreds of thousands of years.

1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:30.920
 That process is also what happens

1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:34.000
 in all mammalian species that mate, okay?

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:38.640
 So I'm overlooking an entire literature of animal studies.

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:41.760
 The classic studies of this were done by two individuals.

1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:42.760
 I'll just briefly mention them

1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:44.960
 in case you want to look at the literature.

1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:47.420
 There's a guy at the Rockefeller University

1:04:47.420 --> 1:04:50.880
 named Donald Pfaff, P-F-A-F-F,

1:04:50.880 --> 1:04:52.380
 who has done beautiful studies

1:04:52.380 --> 1:04:53.800
 identifying the neural circuitry

1:04:53.800 --> 1:04:56.040
 of what's called the lordosis response.

1:04:56.040 --> 1:04:59.580
 Unlike in humans, the mating behavior of animals

1:04:59.580 --> 1:05:01.800
 is rather stereotyped in terms of the positions

1:05:01.800 --> 1:05:04.000
 that they occupy, and the lordosis response

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.840
 is a kind of a U-shaping or a bending up

1:05:06.840 --> 1:05:08.860
 of the hindquarters of typically of rodents,

1:05:08.860 --> 1:05:10.380
 but of other animals as well.

1:05:10.380 --> 1:05:13.640
 The male mounting is almost always from behind

1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:15.520
 except in some species of primates,

1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:19.520
 and that lordosis response is only going to occur

1:05:19.520 --> 1:05:22.320
 during particular phases of the estrus cycle.

1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:25.900
 The estrus cycle is sort of the analog

1:05:25.900 --> 1:05:28.180
 to the menstrual cycle, but it's not 28 days,

1:05:28.180 --> 1:05:30.400
 it's four days or some other duration

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:32.720
 in other animals, depending on the animal.

1:05:32.720 --> 1:05:36.000
 The lordosis response is strongly regulated by odors,

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:40.120
 by contact, and is estrogen and testosterone controlled,

1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:45.120
 and then the male portion of the mating sequence in animals,

1:05:45.280 --> 1:05:47.760
 the mounting and thrusting and ejaculation as they're called

1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:49.960
 or mounting, thrusting, intromission and ejaculation,

1:05:49.960 --> 1:05:51.740
 those are the four scientific categories

1:05:51.740 --> 1:05:54.960
 that have been described, that's presence in rodents

1:05:54.960 --> 1:05:57.400
 and also in dogs, where it was primarily studied

1:05:57.400 --> 1:06:01.680
 by Frank Beach, who was at University of California Berkeley

1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:04.120
 for a long time, and the entire literature

1:06:04.120 --> 1:06:07.120
 around the neural circuitry for sexual mating behavior

1:06:07.120 --> 1:06:12.120
 in animals largely stemmed from the work of Donald Pfaff

1:06:12.620 --> 1:06:15.360
 and Frank Beach and their scientific offspring,

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:17.320
 not their actual offspring.

1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:19.600
 You can look at that literature if you like.

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:23.680
 There have been human neuroimaging studies of the process

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:26.340
 that I described a few minutes ago, believe it or not,

1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:29.400
 of people in brain scanners,

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:31.280
 not necessarily mating with other people,

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:34.560
 but going through that arc of arousal,

1:06:34.560 --> 1:06:38.960
 sympathetic activation during orgasm or ejaculation,

1:06:38.960 --> 1:06:42.420
 and then the post-ejaculatory or orgasmic phase

1:06:42.420 --> 1:06:45.260
 in both men and women, and the brain areas associated

1:06:45.260 --> 1:06:49.480
 with those have all been mapped out now.

1:06:49.480 --> 1:06:54.440
 The spinal cord areas that control things like erection,

1:06:54.440 --> 1:06:57.100
 vaginal lubrication, ejaculation, and orgasm,

1:06:57.100 --> 1:06:58.660
 those have also been mapped out,

1:06:58.660 --> 1:07:00.860
 and this has all been explored from the perspective

1:07:00.860 --> 1:07:03.420
 of both basic science, just to get an understanding

1:07:03.420 --> 1:07:07.780
 of how our species has sexual interactions and reproduces,

1:07:07.780 --> 1:07:10.380
 but also from the perspective of, for instance,

1:07:10.380 --> 1:07:14.780
 trying to repair sexual function after spinal cord injury,

1:07:14.780 --> 1:07:18.080
 which is a prominent concern for a lot of people,

1:07:18.080 --> 1:07:19.740
 depending on where they have their injury,

1:07:19.740 --> 1:07:22.820
 but in the number of people that have spinal cord injuries.

1:07:22.820 --> 1:07:27.340
 So this is both vital biological and clinical data.

1:07:28.860 --> 1:07:32.500
 The neural circuits for everything that I just described

1:07:32.500 --> 1:07:34.560
 reside in the autonomic nervous system

1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:36.500
 and are coordinated with the neural circuits

1:07:36.500 --> 1:07:38.340
 that are associated with empathy.

1:07:38.340 --> 1:07:41.420
 The neural circuits for empathy, again, there are many,

1:07:41.420 --> 1:07:43.580
 but mainly two structures that you should know about,

1:07:43.580 --> 1:07:44.660
 the prefrontal cortex,

1:07:44.660 --> 1:07:47.420
 which is how we perceive things outside of us

1:07:47.420 --> 1:07:49.860
 and make decisions on the basis of those perceptions,

1:07:49.860 --> 1:07:52.040
 how we organize those decisions,

1:07:52.040 --> 1:07:55.500
 and an area of the brain called the insula, I-N-S-U-L-A.

1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:58.460
 The insula is a really interesting brain area

1:07:58.460 --> 1:08:01.940
 that allows us to interocept to pay attention

1:08:01.940 --> 1:08:04.100
 to what's going on inside our body

1:08:04.100 --> 1:08:07.420
 and to split some of our attention to exterocept.

1:08:07.420 --> 1:08:09.080
 And the mating dance,

1:08:09.080 --> 1:08:11.820
 whether or not it's the dinner and date portion

1:08:11.820 --> 1:08:14.260
 of the mating dance or the actual physical dance

1:08:14.260 --> 1:08:16.500
 part of the main dance or actual mating

1:08:16.500 --> 1:08:20.220
 and sexual behavior, kissing or otherwise,

1:08:20.220 --> 1:08:25.000
 that is a coordinated activity of two bodies.

1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:26.060
 Typically it's two.

1:08:26.060 --> 1:08:28.300
 I realize sometimes it's more, sometimes it's only one,

1:08:28.300 --> 1:08:30.820
 but typically it's two bodies,

1:08:30.820 --> 1:08:33.240
 at least in the framework we're using here.

1:08:33.240 --> 1:08:35.760
 That coordinated dance is one in which

1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:38.380
 the autonomic nervous system of one individual

1:08:39.340 --> 1:08:41.860
 in general is coordinating with the autonomic nervous system

1:08:41.860 --> 1:08:42.900
 of the other individual.

1:08:42.900 --> 1:08:47.380
 And the insula is essentially splitting one's attention

1:08:47.380 --> 1:08:52.160
 between how we feel ourselves, how our body feels,

1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:54.480
 what we're thinking with the thinking

1:08:54.480 --> 1:08:57.300
 and the bodily sensations of the other.

1:08:57.300 --> 1:09:00.620
 And that can be communicated obviously through words.

1:09:00.620 --> 1:09:02.300
 I can be communicated through sounds.

1:09:02.300 --> 1:09:04.080
 It can be communicated through touch

1:09:04.080 --> 1:09:05.820
 and it can be communicated through a number

1:09:05.820 --> 1:09:08.900
 of kind of more subtle cues like pupil size

1:09:08.900 --> 1:09:10.300
 or whether or not,

1:09:10.300 --> 1:09:12.360
 certainly in cases where we recognize the person

1:09:12.360 --> 1:09:14.500
 and we kind of know their responses,

1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:16.420
 their autonomic responses under different conditions,

1:09:16.420 --> 1:09:17.620
 we can assess it.

1:09:17.620 --> 1:09:18.860
 Is the person comfortable?

1:09:18.860 --> 1:09:20.060
 Are they uncomfortable?

1:09:20.060 --> 1:09:23.180
 Are they more focused on me or on themselves?

1:09:23.180 --> 1:09:25.520
 This is the coordinated silent dance

1:09:25.520 --> 1:09:28.600
 that if we look at in neurobiological terms,

1:09:28.600 --> 1:09:32.780
 we can really see is all about the autonomic nervous system,

1:09:32.780 --> 1:09:36.020
 whether or not it's time to tip the seesaw

1:09:36.020 --> 1:09:37.740
 to one side or the other,

1:09:37.740 --> 1:09:39.980
 depending on whether or not the other person's seesaw

1:09:39.980 --> 1:09:42.420
 is tilted higher or lower than the other.

1:09:42.420 --> 1:09:44.220
 Okay, so we have the autonomic nervous system

1:09:44.220 --> 1:09:46.680
 and then we have this thing that we're calling empathy,

1:09:46.680 --> 1:09:49.420
 which is really about autonomic matching.

1:09:49.420 --> 1:09:51.980
 And again, the insula and the prefrontal cortex

1:09:51.980 --> 1:09:55.700
 are neural circuits that are crucial for autonomic matching

1:09:55.700 --> 1:09:58.420
 because they allow us to say what's out there

1:09:58.420 --> 1:10:01.720
 and do I want to match to it or not, okay?

1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:04.400
 And then the third category of neural circuit

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:06.880
 that Helen Fisher and others have found to be important

1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:08.520
 for desire, love and attachment

1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:12.280
 is the neural circuit associated with self-delusion.

1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:14.060
 What do we mean by that?

1:10:14.060 --> 1:10:15.620
 Well, first of all,

1:10:16.860 --> 1:10:20.420
 self-delusion implies a kind of cynicism

1:10:20.420 --> 1:10:21.640
 about love and attachment.

1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:24.580
 And I think it was George Bernard Shaw that said,

1:10:24.580 --> 1:10:27.440
 love is really about overestimating the differences

1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:29.200
 between individuals.

1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:30.960
 Actually, when I hear that and as I say it,

1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:32.840
 I really don't like that quote.

1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:34.900
 I have no bone to pick with George Bernard Shaw,

1:10:34.900 --> 1:10:39.100
 but what it suggests, and I think what he meant was that,

1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:41.920
 in love and attachment,

1:10:41.920 --> 1:10:44.600
 we tend to put so much value in the other

1:10:44.600 --> 1:10:46.940
 that we forget that many of the processes

1:10:46.940 --> 1:10:49.100
 that are going on in our brain and body

1:10:49.100 --> 1:10:51.720
 actually could be evoked by many other people too.

1:10:51.720 --> 1:10:54.020
 But I think it somewhat overlooks

1:10:54.020 --> 1:10:55.720
 the enormous power of attachment

1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:58.360
 and the ways in which somebody's smell,

1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:01.820
 somebody's voice, somebody's everything,

1:11:01.820 --> 1:11:04.320
 or somebody's particular thing or things

1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:08.340
 can really become so vital for our autonomic nervous system

1:11:08.340 --> 1:11:10.980
 to feel soothed and to feel elated, et cetera.

1:11:10.980 --> 1:11:15.640
 So I think that while the quote is accurate

1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:16.480
 in the one sense,

1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:19.660
 I think it does overlook the neural circuits for attachment

1:11:19.660 --> 1:11:23.140
 and just how deeply wired those can become for us.

1:11:23.140 --> 1:11:25.980
 So I will balance that quote

1:11:25.980 --> 1:11:27.820
 with an enormous number of other quotes

1:11:27.820 --> 1:11:30.780
 that I won't mention, but that you can find out there

1:11:30.780 --> 1:11:35.760
 that really point to how incredible the person is

1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:37.240
 that one tends to be attached to,

1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:41.220
 that there's really only one or several people

1:11:41.220 --> 1:11:42.060
 that could ever exist

1:11:42.060 --> 1:11:43.600
 that could evoke those feelings from us.

1:11:43.600 --> 1:11:47.420
 And of course you can read your Neruda poetry

1:11:47.420 --> 1:11:49.060
 and you can find these things all over the place

1:11:49.060 --> 1:11:51.400
 in music and poetry and writing.

1:11:51.400 --> 1:11:55.020
 So for every cynical quote about these neural circuits

1:11:55.020 --> 1:11:57.940
 being generic and could be activated by anybody,

1:11:57.940 --> 1:12:02.540
 I think you'll find an ample number of opposing quotes

1:12:02.540 --> 1:12:04.900
 that these neural circuits can only be activated

1:12:04.900 --> 1:12:07.780
 by that special someone or that particular person,

1:12:07.780 --> 1:12:10.020
 or maybe in just a small set of those people.

1:12:10.020 --> 1:12:11.740
 So what of delusion?

1:12:11.740 --> 1:12:15.520
 Well, the work of Helen Fisher and others

1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:19.540
 has really pointed to the fact that desire, love,

1:12:19.540 --> 1:12:22.500
 and attachment are three separate phases

1:12:22.500 --> 1:12:25.380
 of what we call romantic relationships

1:12:25.380 --> 1:12:27.660
 that typically, not always,

1:12:27.660 --> 1:12:29.820
 but typically desire tends to come first

1:12:29.820 --> 1:12:31.380
 or falls in the early phase,

1:12:32.300 --> 1:12:36.860
 that the process of romantic slash sexual interactions,

1:12:36.860 --> 1:12:38.720
 it doesn't necessarily have to be sex itself,

1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:43.720
 but certainly something that involves intimacy of some kind

1:12:44.180 --> 1:12:46.900
 and generally touch of some kind

1:12:46.900 --> 1:12:49.260
 eventually transitions into what we call love,

1:12:49.260 --> 1:12:53.020
 which eventually transitions into what we call attachment.

1:12:53.020 --> 1:12:55.060
 And I should just mention touch

1:12:55.060 --> 1:12:59.600
 because touch is a fundamental aspect of this whole process.

1:12:59.600 --> 1:13:03.260
 There's an article, a research article I should say,

1:13:03.260 --> 1:13:05.820
 the title of it is relationship specific encoding

1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:10.060
 of social touch in somatosensory and insular cortices,

1:13:10.060 --> 1:13:13.940
 cortices being cortex, cortex is plural, cortices.

1:13:13.940 --> 1:13:16.100
 And again, there's our friend, the insula.

1:13:16.100 --> 1:13:18.900
 So this is a study that explored what brain areas

1:13:18.900 --> 1:13:23.580
 and what body areas are activated by specific forms

1:13:23.580 --> 1:13:25.740
 of attachment and social touch.

1:13:25.740 --> 1:13:27.460
 And what they found not surprisingly

1:13:27.460 --> 1:13:29.500
 is that the areas of the brain

1:13:29.500 --> 1:13:32.060
 they're associated with touch, the somatosensory areas,

1:13:32.060 --> 1:13:35.320
 but more interestingly, the insula cortex

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:38.860
 are strongly activated by touch.

1:13:38.860 --> 1:13:42.100
 So touch and the amount of touching and proximity

1:13:42.100 --> 1:13:45.540
 and skin contact not surprisingly activates brain areas

1:13:45.540 --> 1:13:48.400
 associated with somatosensory touch,

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:50.140
 but also the insular cortex,

1:13:50.140 --> 1:13:53.660
 which again is this brain area that links the internal,

1:13:53.660 --> 1:13:55.740
 our feelings about what's going on inside us

1:13:55.740 --> 1:13:58.860
 and at the surface of our skin with events external.

1:13:58.860 --> 1:14:01.980
 And they found activation of a number of brain areas,

1:14:01.980 --> 1:14:05.620
 the amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, and so on and so on.

1:14:05.620 --> 1:14:07.420
 That's not as essential as just understanding

1:14:07.420 --> 1:14:10.200
 that the insula is the place in which we start

1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:13.760
 to take our experience of our internal landscape,

1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:16.700
 attach that to our perceptions of the external landscape,

1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:19.080
 and then assign that a value

1:14:19.080 --> 1:14:22.060
 or assign that some sort of interpretation.

1:14:22.060 --> 1:14:26.540
 And positive delusion is predictive

1:14:26.540 --> 1:14:28.220
 of long-term attachment.

1:14:28.220 --> 1:14:29.620
 What do we mean by positive delusion?

1:14:29.620 --> 1:14:32.820
 Positive delusion is the contradiction

1:14:32.820 --> 1:14:34.960
 of that George Bernard Shaw quote.

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:38.600
 It's the belief that only this person

1:14:38.600 --> 1:14:40.580
 can make me feel this way.

1:14:40.580 --> 1:14:43.380
 This other person holds the capacity

1:14:43.380 --> 1:14:47.700
 to make me feel this way physically or emotionally or both.

1:14:47.700 --> 1:14:52.700
 And so as we move from desire to love to attachment,

1:14:52.780 --> 1:14:55.860
 our brain circuitry is literally getting tuned up

1:14:55.860 --> 1:14:59.060
 such that that individual that we happen to be attached to,

1:14:59.060 --> 1:15:01.460
 again, here thinking about monogamous relationships,

1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:05.640
 but I guess for non-monogamous relationship be individuals,

1:15:06.820 --> 1:15:10.260
 is and are the way in which our autonomic nervous system

1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:11.140
 can be regulated.

1:15:11.140 --> 1:15:14.220
 They actually get access to our control panel.

1:15:14.220 --> 1:15:16.900
 So it's our autonomic nervous system, empathy,

1:15:16.900 --> 1:15:19.540
 and this positive delusion.

1:15:19.540 --> 1:15:21.940
 Now, positive delusion is critical.

1:15:21.940 --> 1:15:25.840
 If you look at the stability of relationships over time,

1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:27.800
 something that's been extensively studied

1:15:27.800 --> 1:15:31.600
 mainly by psychologists, but now also by neurobiologists,

1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:36.280
 what you find is that there are some key features

1:15:36.280 --> 1:15:38.240
 of interactions between individuals

1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:41.520
 that predict that a relationship will last.

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:43.980
 And those are many, but mainly fall

1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:46.420
 under this category of positive delusions.

1:15:46.420 --> 1:15:48.940
 I'll return to those and what those exactly look like,

1:15:48.940 --> 1:15:51.940
 but there are also just a handful of things

1:15:51.940 --> 1:15:55.320
 that predict that a relationship will fail over time.

1:15:55.320 --> 1:15:58.180
 This is largely the work of the Gottman's.

1:15:58.180 --> 1:15:59.760
 It's actually a husband and wife team

1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:03.200
 up at the University of Washington in Seattle.

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:06.180
 The Gottman's have run a laboratory

1:16:06.180 --> 1:16:08.020
 in the Department of Psychology for a long time.

1:16:08.020 --> 1:16:09.860
 They've also done a lot of public-facing work

1:16:09.860 --> 1:16:11.580
 around relationships.

1:16:11.580 --> 1:16:15.600
 And they've talked about the various aspects

1:16:15.600 --> 1:16:17.880
 of relationships and interactions between people

1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:20.260
 that predict either staying together or breaking up,

1:16:20.260 --> 1:16:24.040
 so much so that they've established a method

1:16:24.040 --> 1:16:26.720
 by which they can look at video interactions

1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:30.540
 between couples and with very high degree of certainty

1:16:30.540 --> 1:16:32.680
 predict whether or not those couples will stay together

1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:33.980
 or break up over time.

1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:35.460
 And they've identified what they call

1:16:35.460 --> 1:16:37.900
 the four horsemen of relationships.

1:16:37.900 --> 1:16:42.900
 These are things that essentially almost always predict

1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:45.140
 that a couple will break up.

1:16:45.140 --> 1:16:47.540
 And I think the current number on this

1:16:47.540 --> 1:16:52.540
 is that Gottman can predict divorce with 94% accuracy,

1:16:53.060 --> 1:16:55.100
 which if you think about is pretty remarkable.

1:16:55.100 --> 1:16:57.940
 So even though these are purely psychological studies,

1:16:57.940 --> 1:17:01.500
 I'm not aware of any analysis of underlying physiology.

1:17:01.500 --> 1:17:04.160
 There are some things that they can observe

1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:07.260
 between couples that can lead them to predict

1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:08.780
 whether or not a couple will stay together

1:17:08.780 --> 1:17:11.380
 or break up with 94% accuracy.

1:17:11.380 --> 1:17:12.760
 So what are those things?

1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:14.420
 Those four behaviors, what they call

1:17:14.420 --> 1:17:18.740
 the four horsemen of the apocalypse for relationships,

1:17:19.780 --> 1:17:24.200
 are one, criticism, two, defensiveness,

1:17:24.200 --> 1:17:27.560
 three, stonewalling, and four, contempt,

1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:31.580
 with contempt being the most powerful predictor

1:17:31.580 --> 1:17:34.060
 of breaking up.

1:17:34.060 --> 1:17:35.980
 Criticism, of course, does not mean

1:17:35.980 --> 1:17:40.880
 that there's no place for criticism in stable relationships.

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:42.100
 Of course, there is.

1:17:42.100 --> 1:17:43.780
 It has to do with how frequent

1:17:43.780 --> 1:17:46.100
 and how intensely that criticism is voiced.

1:17:46.100 --> 1:17:49.380
 Defensiveness, of course, is defensiveness.

1:17:49.380 --> 1:17:52.980
 We know as the sort of lack of ability

1:17:52.980 --> 1:17:55.540
 to hear another or to adopt their stance.

1:17:55.540 --> 1:17:57.300
 So lack of empathy, I think,

1:17:57.300 --> 1:18:00.380
 is one way to interpret defensiveness.

1:18:00.380 --> 1:18:03.220
 Stonewalling, which is actually another form

1:18:03.220 --> 1:18:04.100
 of lack of empathy.

1:18:04.100 --> 1:18:06.180
 It's a turning off of this neural circuit

1:18:06.180 --> 1:18:09.180
 that's so critical for desire, love, and attachment.

1:18:09.180 --> 1:18:13.580
 The stonewalling essentially means the emotional response

1:18:13.580 --> 1:18:15.500
 or the request of another is completely cut off.

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:18.800
 So I don't think there's been brain imaging of this,

1:18:18.800 --> 1:18:20.840
 but I think we can reasonably imagine

1:18:20.840 --> 1:18:24.060
 that it involves untethering your insular response

1:18:24.060 --> 1:18:26.900
 from the other and what they're dealing with

1:18:26.900 --> 1:18:31.420
 and focusing your insular response, no pun intended,

1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:34.200
 on your own internal state or perhaps the state

1:18:34.200 --> 1:18:35.980
 of someone else entirely.

1:18:35.980 --> 1:18:37.420
 We'll talk about infidelity in a moment.

1:18:37.420 --> 1:18:38.540
 And then contempt.

1:18:38.540 --> 1:18:40.740
 And contempt has actually been referred to

1:18:40.740 --> 1:18:43.260
 as the sulfuric acid of relationship.

1:18:43.260 --> 1:18:45.840
 I didn't say that, but Gottman and colleagues have,

1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:48.460
 that it is such a powerful predictor

1:18:48.460 --> 1:18:51.780
 of divorce and breakups in the future.

1:18:51.780 --> 1:18:54.180
 And contempt, of course, by definition,

1:18:54.180 --> 1:18:56.300
 is the feeling that a person or thing

1:18:56.300 --> 1:18:58.780
 is beneath consideration, worthlessness,

1:18:58.780 --> 1:19:00.820
 or deserving scorn.

1:19:00.820 --> 1:19:02.660
 And apparently they can identify this

1:19:02.660 --> 1:19:05.100
 in the videos of couples having discussions

1:19:05.100 --> 1:19:09.180
 and interacting by very elaborate eye rolls,

1:19:09.180 --> 1:19:12.740
 by expressions of anger in one individual

1:19:12.740 --> 1:19:15.480
 when their partner is actually expressing enthusiasm

1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:16.940
 or excitement about something.

1:19:16.940 --> 1:19:19.980
 It's the, oh yeah, you would say that,

1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:23.460
 or deep-seated resentment toward the other,

1:19:23.460 --> 1:19:26.580
 so much so that it's apparent that one

1:19:26.580 --> 1:19:29.220
 kind of actively dislikes the other partner.

1:19:29.220 --> 1:19:33.340
 So contempt, disregard for something

1:19:33.340 --> 1:19:34.580
 that should be taken into account

1:19:34.580 --> 1:19:36.500
 is the other way to think about it.

1:19:36.500 --> 1:19:39.400
 Runs counter to all of the neural circuits,

1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:40.700
 all three of the neural circuits

1:19:40.700 --> 1:19:41.700
 that we talked about before.

1:19:41.700 --> 1:19:45.300
 It certainly is, it is the antithesis of empathy.

1:19:45.300 --> 1:19:47.500
 It is anything but a positive delusion.

1:19:47.500 --> 1:19:49.500
 It's really looking at the other individual,

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:51.460
 either accurately or inaccurately,

1:19:51.460 --> 1:19:53.780
 as somebody that you kind of despise.

1:19:53.780 --> 1:19:57.380
 And then it is an absolute inversion

1:19:57.380 --> 1:19:59.160
 of the autonomic seesaw matching

1:19:59.160 --> 1:20:00.800
 that I was talking about before.

1:20:00.800 --> 1:20:03.580
 It's a dissociating of your seesaw from their seesaw.

1:20:03.580 --> 1:20:05.100
 They're very excited about something,

1:20:05.100 --> 1:20:06.900
 you're unexcited by it.

1:20:06.900 --> 1:20:09.100
 In fact, it's an inversion of their seesaw

1:20:09.100 --> 1:20:12.700
 where they're excited, you're down.

1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:14.880
 They're down, you're up, okay?

1:20:14.880 --> 1:20:19.600
 So it's basically an inversion of all of the neural circuits

1:20:19.600 --> 1:20:22.060
 that Helen Fisher and others have identified

1:20:22.060 --> 1:20:24.420
 as critical for desire, love, and attachment.

1:20:24.420 --> 1:20:27.660
 And therefore it's not surprising that it is

1:20:27.660 --> 1:20:29.460
 so strongly predictive of breakups

1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:32.100
 and in the case of married couples of divorce.

1:20:32.100 --> 1:20:33.980
 For those of you that are interested in the work

1:20:33.980 --> 1:20:37.000
 of the Gottman's and similar work,

1:20:37.000 --> 1:20:39.180
 they've written several popular books.

1:20:39.180 --> 1:20:40.820
 They're fairly easy to find.

1:20:40.820 --> 1:20:43.980
 We can link to one of those in the caption.

1:20:43.980 --> 1:20:46.720
 But they've also developed some quite interesting

1:20:46.720 --> 1:20:50.460
 online resources in their so-called love lab.

1:20:50.460 --> 1:20:52.240
 I guess it's fortunate that they didn't call it

1:20:52.240 --> 1:20:54.380
 the hate lab or the breakup lab

1:20:54.380 --> 1:20:56.900
 because they focused a lot on what predicts breakups.

1:20:56.900 --> 1:20:59.320
 But they've also written extensively

1:20:59.320 --> 1:21:02.500
 and researched extensively in peer-reviewed studies

1:21:03.580 --> 1:21:08.140
 what makes people find appropriate partners for them

1:21:08.140 --> 1:21:12.420
 and to maintain those partnerships over time.

1:21:12.420 --> 1:21:15.040
 So you can go, you can search for Love Lab,

1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:17.140
 University of Washington, Gottman,

1:21:17.140 --> 1:21:19.340
 or any number of their various books.

1:21:19.340 --> 1:21:22.120
 I think you'll find some useful resources there.

1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:27.120
 So I want to shift back to the work of Helen Fisher.

1:21:28.120 --> 1:21:31.120
 She's made some very interesting statements

1:21:31.120 --> 1:21:33.280
 and some very interesting observations

1:21:33.280 --> 1:21:34.960
 that at least to my mind,

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:38.560
 map very well onto the knowledge of neural circuitry

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:40.520
 both in humans and in non-human primates

1:21:40.520 --> 1:21:41.600
 and in other species.

1:21:41.600 --> 1:21:44.640
 I realized that she's not the only name in the game,

1:21:45.880 --> 1:21:47.600
 but she's made some observations

1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:51.040
 that I think are very, as we say parsimonious,

1:21:51.040 --> 1:21:53.660
 meaning they allow us to organize a lot of this stuff

1:21:53.660 --> 1:21:55.800
 into some distinct frameworks.

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:58.800
 She's also done some really beautiful studies

1:21:58.800 --> 1:22:00.740
 that involve data from millions

1:22:00.740 --> 1:22:04.000
 or even tens of millions of individuals on dating sites.

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:05.720
 So I'm going to share those with you in a moment.

1:22:05.720 --> 1:22:10.720
 But before I do that, I just want to paraphrase Dr. Fisher

1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:15.960
 who said that sex drive or desire,

1:22:15.960 --> 1:22:18.040
 the pursuit of someone to mate with,

1:22:18.040 --> 1:22:22.300
 meaning to mate the verb, not necessarily to find a mate,

1:22:23.800 --> 1:22:26.520
 may be, she didn't say definitively,

1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:29.380
 but maybe a way to forage for potential love partners.

1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:32.480
 That the arc of this whole business

1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:34.560
 is really the order that we're describing it,

1:22:34.560 --> 1:22:39.360
 that it's desire, then love, and then attachment.

1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:43.060
 And that oftentimes people can get confused.

1:22:43.060 --> 1:22:44.640
 You may know some of these people,

1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:46.680
 you may be one of these individuals

1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:49.480
 who might confuse desire for attachment

1:22:49.480 --> 1:22:53.800
 or might confuse love for attachment,

1:22:53.800 --> 1:22:56.740
 but that there's a sequence of recruitment

1:22:56.740 --> 1:22:59.600
 of these neural circuits that's established first

1:22:59.600 --> 1:23:02.400
 from the pursuit of someone to mate with.

1:23:02.400 --> 1:23:05.000
 And she's placed this in the context

1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:07.280
 of kind of more modern dating themes

1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:11.680
 where depending on culture, people might explore several,

1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:16.400
 maybe many, many individuals before quote unquote,

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:18.720
 settling down with somebody,

1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:21.060
 at least for some period of time.

1:23:21.060 --> 1:23:23.440
 I think that's an interesting framework

1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:25.640
 because it circumvents a lot

1:23:25.640 --> 1:23:29.560
 of the frankly unanswerable questions

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:33.120
 about whether or not humans were meant to be monogamous

1:23:33.120 --> 1:23:34.180
 or whether or not they weren't.

1:23:34.180 --> 1:23:37.080
 Those are conversations that hold cultural context,

1:23:37.080 --> 1:23:39.720
 that hold all sorts of contexts

1:23:39.720 --> 1:23:42.720
 that really can't be addressed in a laboratory setting.

1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:46.720
 But this idea that sex drive is a way to forage

1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:48.400
 for potential love partners

1:23:48.400 --> 1:23:51.260
 and that love is a kind of a litmus test

1:23:51.260 --> 1:23:53.480
 for whether or not longer term

1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:55.880
 or deeper attachments can and will form

1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:58.360
 is one that at least makes sense to me.

1:23:58.360 --> 1:23:59.200
 Later in the episode,

1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:02.720
 we'll talk about this notion of sex drive and desire.

1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:05.000
 I'll actually talk about some tools

1:24:05.000 --> 1:24:08.960
 that have very strong data really to support them

1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:10.840
 in terms of things that people can do

1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:13.440
 or take to increase libido, both men and women,

1:24:14.540 --> 1:24:17.320
 because there's actually quite good data on that now.

1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:18.740
 But in the meantime,

1:24:18.740 --> 1:24:20.440
 I want to talk about some of the work

1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:24.600
 that Dr. Fisher has done in terms of categorizing people

1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:27.120
 into, again, we have four groups.

1:24:27.120 --> 1:24:30.240
 These are distinct from the A, B, C, and D

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:32.180
 attachment styles described earlier.

1:24:32.180 --> 1:24:33.620
 Although as I described them,

1:24:33.620 --> 1:24:36.520
 you might be able to map them somewhat onto those.

1:24:36.520 --> 1:24:40.120
 And these four groups are groups

1:24:40.120 --> 1:24:42.440
 that were defined through her studies

1:24:42.440 --> 1:24:44.920
 of people that were or are,

1:24:44.920 --> 1:24:46.360
 I don't know if they were

1:24:46.360 --> 1:24:49.560
 or if they are still on match.com,

1:24:49.560 --> 1:24:51.600
 but a very extensive data set.

1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:55.120
 So again, millions, if not tens of millions of individuals,

1:24:55.120 --> 1:24:56.640
 the number I heard her quote,

1:24:56.640 --> 1:24:59.240
 and forgive me if this is not accurate,

1:24:59.240 --> 1:25:02.680
 is that in upwards of 40 million individuals,

1:25:04.340 --> 1:25:06.800
 in terms of whether or not their neurochemical

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:09.120
 and hormone systems are tuned toward

1:25:09.120 --> 1:25:10.980
 particular types of behaviors.

1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:13.280
 What do I mean by that?

1:25:13.280 --> 1:25:17.200
 Well, both men and women, males and females,

1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:19.280
 have both testosterone and estrogen.

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:21.480
 Typically, again, these are averages,

1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:23.300
 but typically men have more testosterone

1:25:23.300 --> 1:25:24.620
 than they do estrogen,

1:25:24.620 --> 1:25:26.880
 and they have more testosterone than do women

1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:28.600
 and less estrogen than do women.

1:25:28.600 --> 1:25:30.620
 Typically women have more estrogen

1:25:30.620 --> 1:25:33.160
 than they do testosterone, again, averages,

1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:38.240
 and they have less testosterone than men,

1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:40.860
 more estrogen than men, and so on and so forth.

1:25:40.860 --> 1:25:42.920
 But both hormone systems are active

1:25:42.920 --> 1:25:46.100
 in both sets of individuals.

1:25:46.100 --> 1:25:50.240
 And of course, all humans, as far as we know,

1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:53.040
 manufacture both dopamine and serotonin.

1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:54.400
 Dopamine, as I mentioned earlier,

1:25:54.400 --> 1:25:57.320
 has a number of effects in the brain and body,

1:25:57.320 --> 1:25:59.400
 but one of the primary effects is that it places us

1:25:59.400 --> 1:26:03.360
 into states of motivation and pursuit for various things.

1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:06.120
 There is a somewhat close relationship

1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:10.480
 between the dopamine system and the testosterone system

1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:11.760
 in the hypothalamus,

1:26:11.760 --> 1:26:13.320
 this brain area above the roof of your mouth,

1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:14.680
 and the pituitary gland,

1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:17.040
 which is responsible for making hormones

1:26:17.040 --> 1:26:20.080
 that make the ovaries and or testes

1:26:21.460 --> 1:26:24.120
 secrete testosterone or estrogen.

1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:26.560
 So there's a lot of signaling that occurs

1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:29.920
 such that dopamine and testosterone tend to operate

1:26:29.920 --> 1:26:33.360
 as kind of close cousins in a system of pursuit.

1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:37.320
 And conversely, the serotonin system tends to, on average,

1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:39.660
 collaborate with the estrogen system

1:26:39.660 --> 1:26:43.400
 to impart certain physiological functions and behaviors.

1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:48.400
 So these aren't hard and fast, or I guess better stated,

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:51.420
 these aren't strict black and white categorizations,

1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:53.480
 but I think those general themes hold

1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:56.480
 when you look at the animal and human data.

1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:00.520
 So Dr. Fisher has taken some liberties,

1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:02.560
 but I think they are what I would call

1:27:02.560 --> 1:27:04.160
 logically and scientifically

1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:06.760
 and neurobiologically grounded liberties

1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:10.520
 in classifying individuals who are on these dating sites

1:27:10.520 --> 1:27:12.960
 according to the types of things they report

1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:15.120
 about themselves and the type of people

1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:19.080
 they tend to match with on these dating sites

1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:22.580
 and created these four categories.

1:27:22.580 --> 1:27:24.520
 The four categories are,

1:27:24.520 --> 1:27:27.720
 she calls one the dopamine category.

1:27:27.720 --> 1:27:30.420
 So these are people who would have high dopamine.

1:27:30.420 --> 1:27:33.960
 And again, that's just a name.

1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:36.760
 It doesn't mean they have low anything else,

1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:39.440
 but they are high on the dopamine scale.

1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:42.600
 People who rate high on the dopamine scale

1:27:42.600 --> 1:27:44.880
 tend to be what the scientists and psychologists

1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:47.040
 call high sensation seeking, novel seeking.

1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:48.320
 They like new things.

1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:49.800
 They like spontaneity.

1:27:49.800 --> 1:27:51.280
 They tend to be very adventurous.

1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:52.900
 And I think that's largely true.

1:27:52.900 --> 1:27:55.060
 If you look at conditions

1:27:55.060 --> 1:27:59.480
 where dopamine is super physiological,

1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:04.480
 it's elevated beyond abnormal levels, things like mania,

1:28:04.840 --> 1:28:07.360
 or when people take certain drugs of abuse

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:08.640
 like cocaine or amphetamine

1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:12.500
 that really raise dopamine levels up very, very high

1:28:12.500 --> 1:28:13.760
 for some period of time,

1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:17.080
 they do tend to increase energy motivation

1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:18.040
 and novelty seeking.

1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:20.060
 And of course, drugs like amphetamine and cocaine

1:28:20.060 --> 1:28:22.120
 have all sorts of deleterious effects

1:28:22.120 --> 1:28:23.160
 that I don't need to go into here,

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:24.880
 but it's worth pointing out.

1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:27.260
 But they don't tend to make people calm and relaxed

1:28:27.260 --> 1:28:30.680
 and seek soothing interactions.

1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:33.720
 Conversely, the group that Dr. Fisher

1:28:33.720 --> 1:28:36.520
 calls the serotonin group

1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:41.520
 tend to be more grounded in soothing activities,

1:28:41.720 --> 1:28:43.400
 quiescent type activities.

1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:45.560
 They actually tend to be on average,

1:28:45.560 --> 1:28:47.760
 they tend to like rules and follow rules.

1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:50.200
 They tend to be home bodies, this sort of thing.

1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:51.820
 They're really, you can imagine them

1:28:51.820 --> 1:28:54.960
 the sort of stable types, but they really like stability.

1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:57.280
 They're not really into spontaneity as much,

1:28:57.280 --> 1:28:58.280
 again, averages.

1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:01.380
 And then she created two other categories,

1:29:01.380 --> 1:29:04.600
 the testosterone category of high testosterone.

1:29:04.600 --> 1:29:07.600
 This again could be males or females.

1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:11.000
 And then the estrogen category again

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.080
 could be males or females.

1:29:12.080 --> 1:29:14.520
 And she gave these different names

1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:15.680
 that I won't go into here.

1:29:15.680 --> 1:29:16.980
 You can look up her work online,

1:29:16.980 --> 1:29:18.840
 but she, you know, names like the director

1:29:18.840 --> 1:29:20.960
 and the follower and things like that.

1:29:20.960 --> 1:29:22.160
 But I don't really want to use those

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:24.600
 as much as I want to stick to the biological terms.

1:29:24.600 --> 1:29:28.440
 So we have dopamine, serotonin, testosterone, and estrogen.

1:29:28.440 --> 1:29:31.440
 Now that might seem like an unfair

1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:33.600
 kind of overgeneralization,

1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:36.360
 but what's interesting is not necessarily

1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:38.600
 the name or the neurochemical system, right?

1:29:38.600 --> 1:29:41.320
 Those could have just been called category one, two, three,

1:29:41.320 --> 1:29:45.280
 and four for all that matters here.

1:29:45.280 --> 1:29:49.520
 What is interesting is seeing how those different groups

1:29:49.520 --> 1:29:53.240
 of individuals that she absolutely can categorize

1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:58.120
 based on their self-reported preferences about behaviors

1:29:58.120 --> 1:29:59.920
 and certain kinds of interactions,

1:29:59.920 --> 1:30:03.040
 how those groups tend to pair up with people

1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:05.380
 in the same or opposite categories.

1:30:05.380 --> 1:30:07.960
 So what her studies reveal is that people

1:30:07.960 --> 1:30:10.000
 that fall into the high sensation seeking,

1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:12.320
 novelty seeking, spontaneity category,

1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:15.800
 the one that she calls the high dopamine category,

1:30:15.800 --> 1:30:19.000
 tend to pair up with, at least in the short term,

1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:22.020
 tend to pair up with people who are also

1:30:22.020 --> 1:30:23.720
 in that dopaminergic category.

1:30:23.720 --> 1:30:26.960
 So these would be people that would spontaneously

1:30:26.960 --> 1:30:30.000
 take a trip or explore something new or a new restaurant.

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:34.460
 They tend to be creative and explorative types.

1:30:34.460 --> 1:30:39.460
 So that group on average tends to date and mate

1:30:39.980 --> 1:30:42.900
 and potentially form long-term relationships

1:30:42.900 --> 1:30:46.000
 within category, again, averages.

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:49.900
 Individuals that she placed into the serotonin group

1:30:49.900 --> 1:30:52.920
 or what she hypothesized would be a high serotonin group,

1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:54.780
 again, they didn't measure serotonin,

1:30:54.780 --> 1:30:58.440
 but people that tend to place value on stability,

1:30:58.440 --> 1:31:01.080
 on rules, on certain forms

1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:04.400
 of kind of traditional organization at home

1:31:04.400 --> 1:31:05.560
 and in relationships,

1:31:05.560 --> 1:31:10.560
 those people also tended to pair up with select, date,

1:31:11.440 --> 1:31:14.680
 we presume mate with, and form stable relationships

1:31:14.680 --> 1:31:17.240
 with people in the same category.

1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:19.760
 Now, individuals in the other two categories,

1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:21.520
 the high testosterone group,

1:31:21.520 --> 1:31:23.480
 and again, testosterone wasn't measured,

1:31:23.480 --> 1:31:25.540
 but she called it the high testosterone group,

1:31:25.540 --> 1:31:30.540
 but these are people that tend to be very directive.

1:31:30.820 --> 1:31:32.320
 They tend to know what they want

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:35.520
 and are comfortable telling other people what they want

1:31:35.520 --> 1:31:40.520
 and from them, these are individuals that in her studies

1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:44.200
 and in other studies tend to be a little bit challenging,

1:31:44.200 --> 1:31:47.200
 meaning they not necessarily challenging to be around,

1:31:47.200 --> 1:31:49.160
 but they tend to challenge other people,

1:31:49.160 --> 1:31:52.740
 kind of push them in order to expand their boundaries,

1:31:52.740 --> 1:31:55.840
 either for sake of the relationship or just in general.

1:31:55.840 --> 1:31:57.160
 And the people they tend to push

1:31:57.160 --> 1:31:59.200
 are the people that they pair up with,

1:31:59.200 --> 1:32:01.240
 which are the people in the estrogen category,

1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:02.280
 what she called high estrogen.

1:32:02.280 --> 1:32:03.800
 Again, they didn't measure estrogen,

1:32:03.800 --> 1:32:06.160
 but the people in the estrogen category

1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:09.240
 were the ones that described themselves

1:32:09.240 --> 1:32:10.840
 and their choices in life

1:32:10.840 --> 1:32:13.440
 and their preferences as being nurturing.

1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:15.000
 They actually seem to like it

1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:18.560
 when someone else is making the major decisions,

1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:19.760
 not every decision.

1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:22.120
 They certainly like to be heard, of course,

1:32:22.120 --> 1:32:25.120
 in terms of their preferences, but that those two types,

1:32:25.120 --> 1:32:27.280
 the, what she called the testosterone

1:32:27.280 --> 1:32:29.800
 and the estrogen type tend to pair up.

1:32:29.800 --> 1:32:32.680
 So why are these categorizations and these averages

1:32:32.680 --> 1:32:33.600
 interesting to me,

1:32:33.600 --> 1:32:36.260
 at least interesting enough to convey to you?

1:32:36.260 --> 1:32:38.920
 The reason they're interesting to me is,

1:32:38.920 --> 1:32:40.460
 again, not because of their names,

1:32:40.460 --> 1:32:43.240
 these molecules were not measured in these individuals,

1:32:43.240 --> 1:32:45.480
 but that they once again bring us

1:32:45.480 --> 1:32:48.160
 to the themes that we addressed before,

1:32:48.160 --> 1:32:50.880
 which are the autonomic nervous system

1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:52.760
 and whether or not it tends to be shifted

1:32:52.760 --> 1:32:54.860
 more towards alertness in action

1:32:54.860 --> 1:32:57.520
 or more towards kind of a stable equilibrium

1:32:57.520 --> 1:32:59.600
 or more towards kind of calm

1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:03.520
 and whether or not individuals are selecting

1:33:03.520 --> 1:33:06.200
 for people who have autonomic nervous systems

1:33:06.200 --> 1:33:08.920
 that are more or less like theirs

1:33:08.920 --> 1:33:10.740
 before they even meet, right?

1:33:10.740 --> 1:33:13.920
 So again, going back to this seesaw analogy,

1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:16.640
 it's almost like people who have the kind of flat seesaw,

1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:19.600
 alert but calm, but not extremely alert,

1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:23.920
 not extremely overly calm in situations,

1:33:23.920 --> 1:33:26.780
 but kind of in the middle seem to be seeking out people

1:33:26.780 --> 1:33:31.340
 that are also at that kind of autonomic equilibrium.

1:33:31.340 --> 1:33:33.720
 People in the, what she called the dopamine category,

1:33:33.720 --> 1:33:35.080
 which really can just be described

1:33:35.080 --> 1:33:37.300
 as high sensation seeking, novelty seeking,

1:33:37.300 --> 1:33:39.040
 they seem to want to pair with one another.

1:33:39.040 --> 1:33:42.520
 So there's a selection for similar

1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:45.680
 in two of the groups, autonomic tone.

1:33:45.680 --> 1:33:50.380
 I find that very interesting because in that decision

1:33:50.380 --> 1:33:53.400
 or that preference for similar autonomic tone,

1:33:53.400 --> 1:33:58.320
 it essentially eliminates a lot of the requirement

1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:01.960
 for figuring out how to match

1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:03.680
 one's autonomic nervous system to another.

1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:07.580
 They simply find someone with a similar tendency, okay?

1:34:07.580 --> 1:34:10.120
 Whereas in the other two groups

1:34:10.120 --> 1:34:11.720
 that she called testosterone and estrogen,

1:34:11.720 --> 1:34:13.540
 the director type and the nurturing

1:34:13.540 --> 1:34:16.240
 kind of somewhat follower type,

1:34:16.240 --> 1:34:18.980
 there's an establishment of balance,

1:34:18.980 --> 1:34:23.980
 but not between two individuals as a match,

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.920
 but rather on the whole in the relationship.

1:34:26.920 --> 1:34:29.420
 One person is kind of driving the novelty seeking

1:34:29.420 --> 1:34:30.960
 in the course of decisions and actions,

1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:33.800
 and the other person is essentially agreeing to those.

1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:37.420
 Now, assuming that those decisions are good for both people.

1:34:37.420 --> 1:34:39.200
 And I emphasize good for both people

1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:41.880
 because one of the themes that Dr. Fisher underscores

1:34:41.880 --> 1:34:44.040
 and I'd like to underscore here as well

1:34:44.040 --> 1:34:48.780
 is that it need not be the case that people pair up

1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:51.000
 exactly according to these categorizations

1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:52.680
 that I've described.

1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:54.960
 Dopamine with dopamine, serotonin with serotonin,

1:34:54.960 --> 1:34:57.720
 testosterone with estrogen, and so on.

1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:00.920
 What is important is that there be a recognition

1:35:00.920 --> 1:35:03.760
 and a respect for the other types

1:35:03.760 --> 1:35:06.320
 or a recognition and a respect for the fact

1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:08.160
 that both are of the same type.

1:35:08.160 --> 1:35:09.880
 You could actually imagine, for instance,

1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:12.480
 that two people of this high sensation seeking,

1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:15.400
 novelty seeking could have a terrifically

1:35:15.400 --> 1:35:16.520
 exciting relationship,

1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:19.760
 but that it actually might be a relationship

1:35:19.760 --> 1:35:23.620
 in which the financial stability isn't quite there

1:35:23.620 --> 1:35:27.000
 or in which the basic stability isn't there.

1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:29.100
 You could imagine, for instance,

1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.900
 a situation in which a relationship between two people

1:35:32.900 --> 1:35:37.180
 of what she called the high serotonin preference

1:35:37.180 --> 1:35:39.640
 would have a relationship that was actually kind of dull

1:35:39.640 --> 1:35:41.760
 in which both of them found themselves kind of bored

1:35:41.760 --> 1:35:45.120
 at some point or in which there wasn't enough

1:35:45.120 --> 1:35:49.080
 of the dynamic tension that sometimes is required

1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:51.540
 in order to keep this cycle of desire,

1:35:51.540 --> 1:35:52.540
 love, and attachment going,

1:35:52.540 --> 1:35:55.020
 something that we will talk about in a moment.

1:35:55.020 --> 1:35:59.900
 So the point here is not that one should necessarily pair up

1:35:59.900 --> 1:36:02.900
 according to these arrangements that I described.

1:36:02.900 --> 1:36:06.600
 The point is that on average, that's what tends to happen

1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:10.660
 and that through a recognition that these categorizations

1:36:10.660 --> 1:36:15.660
 exist, similar to the recognition that the type A, B, C,

1:36:16.060 --> 1:36:19.940
 and D infant and toddler type attachments exist,

1:36:19.940 --> 1:36:23.640
 that we can gain better self-awareness of who we are

1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:26.800
 and how we tend to show up in romantic attachments

1:36:26.800 --> 1:36:31.800
 and thereby navigate healthier mate seeking,

1:36:31.920 --> 1:36:36.380
 healthier breakups, if the case dictates it,

1:36:36.380 --> 1:36:39.340
 and in some cases, healthy long-term relationships

1:36:39.340 --> 1:36:41.280
 by understanding that the other person

1:36:41.280 --> 1:36:44.680
 can either be similar or complimentary to us.

1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:47.060
 One is neither better than the other.

1:36:47.060 --> 1:36:50.680
 It's simply the case that in all romantic attachments

1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:54.540
 from the initial inception of that romantic attachment,

1:36:54.540 --> 1:36:58.080
 desire, love, and attachment,

1:36:58.080 --> 1:37:01.020
 there is an autonomic coordination.

1:37:01.020 --> 1:37:02.820
 And of course there's coordination

1:37:02.820 --> 1:37:06.580
 of all sorts of other things like food, sex, and sleep,

1:37:06.580 --> 1:37:09.260
 and finances, and where people are going to live,

1:37:09.260 --> 1:37:10.620
 and many other features.

1:37:10.620 --> 1:37:14.300
 But that at the core of all that is a seeking

1:37:14.300 --> 1:37:19.100
 of either autonomic likeness or autonomic differences.

1:37:19.100 --> 1:37:22.660
 And I think that recognition can be extremely valuable

1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:27.060
 in thinking about tools to enter and maintain relationships.

1:37:27.060 --> 1:37:30.400
 If one thinks about their autonomic nervous system,

1:37:30.400 --> 1:37:32.880
 not simply as something that is driven

1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:35.340
 by external people and events,

1:37:35.340 --> 1:37:37.940
 but that we can actually gain some control over

1:37:37.940 --> 1:37:40.420
 through techniques of the sort that I talked about earlier

1:37:40.420 --> 1:37:43.160
 and on previous podcasts, but also generally,

1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:46.800
 if we are able to adjust our autonomic nervous system

1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:50.720
 in order to at least appreciate or get some empathy

1:37:50.720 --> 1:37:53.120
 into what someone else is experiencing,

1:37:53.120 --> 1:37:56.380
 then we gain actual cognitive empathy.

1:37:56.380 --> 1:38:00.100
 And this episode isn't about empathy per se,

1:38:00.100 --> 1:38:01.900
 but the theme keeps coming up again and again.

1:38:01.900 --> 1:38:03.380
 And I think it's worth mentioning

1:38:03.380 --> 1:38:06.140
 that when you talk to psychologists,

1:38:06.140 --> 1:38:07.500
 whether or not they're psychoanalysts

1:38:07.500 --> 1:38:09.980
 or from another source of training,

1:38:09.980 --> 1:38:12.300
 what you find is that they don't talk about empathy

1:38:12.300 --> 1:38:16.620
 as a general term, they will talk about emotional empathy.

1:38:16.620 --> 1:38:18.260
 They'll talk about cognitive empathy.

1:38:18.260 --> 1:38:19.900
 And what I'm talking about here today

1:38:19.900 --> 1:38:21.580
 is that you had a third category

1:38:21.580 --> 1:38:25.780
 that is very strongly determinant of relationship dynamics,

1:38:25.780 --> 1:38:27.940
 and that's autonomic empathy.

1:38:27.940 --> 1:38:30.580
 I'm a biologist, I'm not a psychologist,

1:38:30.580 --> 1:38:32.300
 so I love mechanism.

1:38:32.300 --> 1:38:34.620
 And fortunately, there are studies

1:38:34.620 --> 1:38:37.820
 that have been done recently using modern techniques

1:38:37.820 --> 1:38:41.600
 to look at neural mechanisms of romantic attachment.

1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:44.760
 I mentioned earlier some of the brain imaging studies

1:38:44.760 --> 1:38:48.380
 that have been done on child and mother,

1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:51.220
 literally imaging the activity of neurons in the brain

1:38:51.220 --> 1:38:54.960
 as child is nursing or as a mother is soothing baby.

1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:59.260
 And as you learned earlier, baby is soothing mother as well.

1:38:59.260 --> 1:39:00.400
 Those are remarkable studies.

1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:02.080
 You may have seen some of these pictures online.

1:39:02.080 --> 1:39:04.500
 You can see the kind of silhouette of the infant and mother

1:39:04.500 --> 1:39:06.820
 and their brains and even some of the brain

1:39:06.820 --> 1:39:09.580
 activation patterns, really, really beautiful studies.

1:39:09.580 --> 1:39:13.880
 Similar studies have been done in romantic couples

1:39:13.880 --> 1:39:17.140
 with those couples either touching one another,

1:39:17.140 --> 1:39:20.360
 touching and kissing, or in kind of clever,

1:39:20.360 --> 1:39:22.520
 I think, control experiments of the person

1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:24.620
 just touching a pillow or something,

1:39:24.620 --> 1:39:27.820
 or kissing a pillow in order to try and create

1:39:27.820 --> 1:39:30.460
 the most reasonable control

1:39:30.460 --> 1:39:32.700
 for what are actually pretty complicated

1:39:32.700 --> 1:39:35.620
 interpersonal dynamics to do in a brain imaging scanner.

1:39:36.740 --> 1:39:39.140
 But some of the other studies

1:39:39.140 --> 1:39:41.540
 that have been done recently involved so-called EEG.

1:39:41.540 --> 1:39:42.920
 So these are electrical recordings

1:39:42.920 --> 1:39:44.900
 that are done noninvasively,

1:39:44.900 --> 1:39:47.540
 putting a bunch of electrodes on the outside of the scalp.

1:39:47.540 --> 1:39:52.300
 EEG is useful in that you can do it noninvasively.

1:39:52.300 --> 1:39:56.340
 You can do it while people are moving and doing things,

1:39:56.340 --> 1:39:58.800
 kissing, touching, et cetera.

1:39:58.800 --> 1:40:02.220
 It doesn't allow one to image or to evaluate

1:40:02.220 --> 1:40:04.600
 neural activity very deeply in the brain.

1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:06.360
 So you can miss out on a lot of things.

1:40:06.360 --> 1:40:08.900
 It's sort of like looking at the wave structure on the ocean

1:40:08.900 --> 1:40:12.280
 without actually looking into the depths of the ocean.

1:40:12.280 --> 1:40:14.980
 So you can miss certain things, but if you see things,

1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:16.980
 generally you trust they are there,

1:40:16.980 --> 1:40:18.620
 but you can't see what you don't see.

1:40:18.620 --> 1:40:21.060
 Nonetheless, there's some studies

1:40:21.060 --> 1:40:22.940
 that I'll just point you to,

1:40:22.940 --> 1:40:24.660
 and that form the segue

1:40:24.660 --> 1:40:27.380
 for what I'm going to discuss in a moment,

1:40:27.380 --> 1:40:32.380
 which is a study published in Scientific Reports in 2021,

1:40:33.020 --> 1:40:35.260
 entitled Investigating Real-Life Emotions

1:40:35.260 --> 1:40:37.940
 in Romantic Couples, a Mobile EEG Study.

1:40:37.940 --> 1:40:41.220
 So this is, as the title suggests,

1:40:41.220 --> 1:40:43.760
 I think people wear these EEG caps of electrodes,

1:40:44.800 --> 1:40:48.900
 get engaged in very passionate emotional kisses,

1:40:48.900 --> 1:40:50.520
 emotional speech toward one another,

1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:51.680
 standing at different distances.

1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:53.560
 So a lot of cool stuff that you can do

1:40:53.560 --> 1:40:55.840
 that you really couldn't do in a brain scanner,

1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:56.820
 because in a brain scanner,

1:40:56.820 --> 1:40:58.920
 people have to be there usually in a bite bar.

1:40:58.920 --> 1:41:00.380
 They're actually draw hooks like this.

1:41:00.380 --> 1:41:02.380
 I've been in one of these things.

1:41:02.380 --> 1:41:04.300
 There's not a lot of moving around to be had,

1:41:04.300 --> 1:41:07.340
 at least not using the current technology.

1:41:07.340 --> 1:41:09.480
 In any case, what they found was

1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:14.200
 there is a shift in brain waves, brain states,

1:41:14.200 --> 1:41:15.460
 things like alpha waves,

1:41:15.460 --> 1:41:17.300
 which is a particular frequency of brain waves

1:41:17.300 --> 1:41:20.060
 in the neocortex, the kind of outer shell of the brain

1:41:20.060 --> 1:41:22.160
 just beneath the skull.

1:41:22.160 --> 1:41:25.600
 And in people that are kissing

1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:27.700
 or in people that are engaged in romantic speech,

1:41:27.700 --> 1:41:31.740
 or I didn't actually hear what they said to one another,

1:41:31.740 --> 1:41:34.500
 but what the couple seems exciting,

1:41:34.500 --> 1:41:36.740
 romantic, and arousing to them,

1:41:36.740 --> 1:41:38.640
 they see more alpha wave activity

1:41:38.640 --> 1:41:40.260
 compared to the control conditions.

1:41:40.260 --> 1:41:42.660
 And there was some, what we call lateralization,

1:41:42.660 --> 1:41:44.720
 where the left hemisphere was more active than the right

1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:45.560
 and so forth.

1:41:46.760 --> 1:41:48.820
 And these studies are important

1:41:48.820 --> 1:41:52.260
 because we know that the autonomic nervous systems

1:41:52.260 --> 1:41:56.060
 of individuals tend to start to collaborate

1:41:56.060 --> 1:41:59.300
 and actually synchronize at the level of heartbeats,

1:41:59.300 --> 1:42:01.220
 at the level of breathing

1:42:01.220 --> 1:42:03.540
 during romantic interactions of different kinds.

1:42:03.540 --> 1:42:05.940
 But these studies are some of the first of their kind

1:42:05.940 --> 1:42:08.140
 to start looking at neural synchronization

1:42:08.140 --> 1:42:09.900
 between individuals.

1:42:09.900 --> 1:42:14.220
 Now, the simple version of looking at this

1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:17.180
 and the way I would have thought this would all go was,

1:42:17.180 --> 1:42:18.740
 okay, two people start kissing,

1:42:18.740 --> 1:42:20.540
 they start talking about what they find

1:42:20.540 --> 1:42:22.380
 particularly romantic and arousing for them,

1:42:22.380 --> 1:42:24.780
 and their brainwaves will just match to one another.

1:42:24.780 --> 1:42:28.560
 And that's really the basis of romantic attachment

1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:32.260
 and romantic engagement in that sort of thing.

1:42:32.260 --> 1:42:36.300
 But it turns out that the opposite is true.

1:42:36.300 --> 1:42:40.820
 So a really nice study published in a really fine journal,

1:42:40.820 --> 1:42:42.160
 Cerebral Cortex is a journal

1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:43.620
 that I've known about for many years.

1:42:43.620 --> 1:42:46.740
 They published Strong Anatomy, Physiology, and Neuroimaging.

1:42:46.740 --> 1:42:48.940
 There's a study that was published,

1:42:48.940 --> 1:42:53.940
 first author Kajimura in, and this paper really points,

1:42:54.540 --> 1:42:56.940
 again, this is 2021.

1:42:56.940 --> 1:42:58.680
 And the title of this paper is,

1:42:58.680 --> 1:43:01.060
 brain knows who is on the same wavelength.

1:43:01.060 --> 1:43:04.020
 Resting state connectivity can predict compatibility

1:43:04.020 --> 1:43:06.380
 of female-male relationship.

1:43:06.380 --> 1:43:08.820
 Now, what this study did was a little bit different.

1:43:08.820 --> 1:43:10.100
 They looked at the resting

1:43:10.100 --> 1:43:12.860
 or default mode activity of the brain.

1:43:12.860 --> 1:43:15.860
 So rather than evoked activity, as it's called,

1:43:15.860 --> 1:43:18.100
 where people are kissing or are engaged

1:43:18.100 --> 1:43:22.100
 in some sort of activity, this was a neuroimaging study,

1:43:22.100 --> 1:43:25.780
 not EEG, but FMRI, functional magnetic resonance imaging,

1:43:25.780 --> 1:43:29.160
 which is similar to EEG in principle,

1:43:29.160 --> 1:43:31.360
 but allows you to look deep into the brain.

1:43:31.360 --> 1:43:35.460
 And it has a very good resolution in time and space.

1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:37.780
 So fast events can be monitored,

1:43:37.780 --> 1:43:42.100
 and the precise location of those events can be monitored

1:43:42.100 --> 1:43:43.700
 somewhat better than EEG.

1:43:43.700 --> 1:43:44.740
 There are exceptions to this.

1:43:44.740 --> 1:43:47.700
 So for you EEGers out there, EEG,

1:43:47.700 --> 1:43:50.340
 don't come after me with electrodes.

1:43:50.340 --> 1:43:54.180
 Just understand that FMRI gives you a fuller picture

1:43:54.180 --> 1:43:55.100
 of what's going on.

1:43:55.100 --> 1:43:59.500
 And what Kajimura at all found was that contrary

1:43:59.500 --> 1:44:03.840
 to what your reflexive prediction might be,

1:44:04.980 --> 1:44:09.980
 people tend to select people that have resting brain states

1:44:10.060 --> 1:44:11.940
 that are different than theirs,

1:44:11.940 --> 1:44:15.180
 or sometimes they found that are actually opposite

1:44:15.180 --> 1:44:17.260
 to their own resting brain state.

1:44:17.260 --> 1:44:19.300
 And you might say, well, that doesn't make any sense.

1:44:19.300 --> 1:44:22.240
 I thought this is all about autonomic coordination.

1:44:22.240 --> 1:44:24.820
 But actually, if we go back to Helen Fisher's

1:44:24.820 --> 1:44:27.280
 categorizations of the dopamine types,

1:44:27.280 --> 1:44:30.420
 the sensation-seeking types, that is serotonin,

1:44:30.420 --> 1:44:33.180
 the kind of stable rule-following types,

1:44:33.180 --> 1:44:34.480
 testosterone and estrogen types,

1:44:34.480 --> 1:44:36.860
 remember that the two categories that she called

1:44:36.860 --> 1:44:38.140
 testosterone and estrogen type,

1:44:38.140 --> 1:44:40.700
 the director and the follower, the nurturer,

1:44:40.700 --> 1:44:42.140
 I guess it would be the more accurate way,

1:44:42.140 --> 1:44:43.900
 the director and the nurturer,

1:44:43.900 --> 1:44:46.720
 those tend to pair up across categories,

1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:48.420
 not within category.

1:44:48.420 --> 1:44:51.420
 And so I think what's really needed for this field,

1:44:51.420 --> 1:44:53.660
 which to my knowledge hasn't happened yet,

1:44:53.660 --> 1:44:57.980
 is to really start to map the neuroanatomical

1:44:57.980 --> 1:45:00.500
 and neurophysiological findings of,

1:45:00.500 --> 1:45:03.460
 in this case, that resting brain state

1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:06.740
 is in one form in one individual,

1:45:06.740 --> 1:45:09.260
 and they tend to seek out people whose resting brain state

1:45:09.260 --> 1:45:11.880
 is different than theirs, not similar,

1:45:11.880 --> 1:45:15.500
 that needs to be mapped onto the more subjective

1:45:15.500 --> 1:45:19.320
 psychological categorizations that Helen Fisher

1:45:19.320 --> 1:45:21.980
 and indeed the Gottman's and others have created.

1:45:21.980 --> 1:45:24.020
 That's sort of the state of the field now.

1:45:24.020 --> 1:45:26.380
 And I mentioned this, not to confuse you,

1:45:26.380 --> 1:45:30.020
 but to the contrary, to illustrate that it's not just

1:45:30.020 --> 1:45:32.060
 about finding someone just like you.

1:45:32.060 --> 1:45:34.400
 And it's not just about finding someone

1:45:34.400 --> 1:45:35.860
 who's opposite to you.

1:45:35.860 --> 1:45:38.020
 This is actually the reason that I decided to become

1:45:38.020 --> 1:45:40.260
 a biologist at some point in my life,

1:45:40.260 --> 1:45:43.900
 which is that we can find verbal sayings and stories

1:45:43.900 --> 1:45:46.880
 and examples to support just about anything.

1:45:46.880 --> 1:45:49.140
 It's, this is not a knock on the field of psychology,

1:45:49.140 --> 1:45:50.820
 as you can probably tell from today's episode,

1:45:50.820 --> 1:45:52.560
 I have great respect for and reverence

1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:53.660
 for the field of psychology,

1:45:53.660 --> 1:45:56.700
 especially its collaboration with neuroscience

1:45:56.700 --> 1:45:58.060
 and vice versa.

1:45:58.060 --> 1:46:02.040
 But in the popular culture, we can find examples

1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:04.460
 and sayings that support essentially anything

1:46:04.460 --> 1:46:06.380
 as it relates to a relationship.

1:46:06.380 --> 1:46:08.860
 For instance, I've heard, and you've probably heard,

1:46:08.860 --> 1:46:10.860
 absence makes the heart grow fonder.

1:46:10.860 --> 1:46:13.940
 And indeed I've experienced that and I believe it's true,

1:46:13.940 --> 1:46:16.380
 but I also have experienced and I believe to be true

1:46:16.380 --> 1:46:18.800
 that out of sight, out of mind also exists

1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:21.660
 and that there will be a biological mechanism for that.

1:46:21.660 --> 1:46:24.760
 The point here is that matching of same to same

1:46:24.760 --> 1:46:27.260
 or same to different can both be effective

1:46:27.260 --> 1:46:32.260
 in creating the desire, love attachment process.

1:46:32.820 --> 1:46:36.140
 It's a matter of who is looking for same

1:46:36.140 --> 1:46:37.380
 and who is looking for different.

1:46:37.380 --> 1:46:40.120
 And there, I think Dr. Fisher and the work

1:46:40.120 --> 1:46:42.700
 of these neurophysiologists and brain imagers

1:46:42.700 --> 1:46:45.220
 really does point in a direction whereby

1:46:45.220 --> 1:46:48.920
 there is not one form of attachment

1:46:48.920 --> 1:46:51.060
 that is going to be wholly above all else

1:46:51.060 --> 1:46:53.080
 and will predict good outcomes.

1:46:53.080 --> 1:46:56.500
 There is not going to be a case in which opposites attract

1:46:56.500 --> 1:46:58.820
 and that's always the best rule to follow.

1:46:58.820 --> 1:47:01.280
 Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't.

1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:03.900
 There is also not the case that people tend to pair up

1:47:03.900 --> 1:47:05.300
 with similar.

1:47:05.300 --> 1:47:08.100
 Sometimes it will be the case, sometimes it won't.

1:47:08.100 --> 1:47:10.040
 Now, there are certain statistics

1:47:10.040 --> 1:47:11.300
 that support that statement.

1:47:11.300 --> 1:47:13.660
 For instance, people on average,

1:47:13.660 --> 1:47:15.820
 people pair up with individuals

1:47:15.820 --> 1:47:19.140
 of similar educational background, income and attractiveness.

1:47:19.140 --> 1:47:22.380
 That is true on average, but it's not always the case.

1:47:22.380 --> 1:47:25.140
 And again, a knowledge of and a respect

1:47:25.140 --> 1:47:27.740
 for the different categorizations of attachment,

1:47:27.740 --> 1:47:30.140
 the different categorizations of mate seeking

1:47:30.140 --> 1:47:31.580
 described by Fisher and others,

1:47:31.580 --> 1:47:33.540
 and the recognition that matching

1:47:33.540 --> 1:47:36.540
 of autonomic nervous systems, but also mismatching

1:47:36.540 --> 1:47:39.900
 of resting state brain networks are all at play

1:47:39.900 --> 1:47:43.460
 in driving what we are calling desire, love and attachment.

1:47:43.460 --> 1:47:45.480
 So in keeping with the exploration of the fact

1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:49.260
 that there's a saying or a book or a song or an example

1:47:49.260 --> 1:47:51.440
 of pretty much any relationship dynamic,

1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:55.200
 I want to now talk about an article that came out

1:47:55.200 --> 1:47:58.660
 a little over 10 years ago that talked about

1:47:58.660 --> 1:48:02.800
 the universality of love and the ability to fall in love.

1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:04.120
 So this would be very much in line

1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:06.580
 with the George Bernard Shaw quote that I mentioned earlier,

1:48:06.580 --> 1:48:09.100
 that love is really overestimating

1:48:09.100 --> 1:48:10.620
 the differences between individuals.

1:48:10.620 --> 1:48:12.020
 And again, I should say that is not something

1:48:12.020 --> 1:48:13.680
 that I personally believe,

1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:15.600
 although maybe I'm just deluding myself.

1:48:15.600 --> 1:48:18.680
 I like to think that the people that we fall in love with

1:48:20.060 --> 1:48:21.940
 are really special for us,

1:48:21.940 --> 1:48:25.580
 that they could not easily be replaced with anybody else.

1:48:25.580 --> 1:48:26.940
 That's simply my stance.

1:48:26.940 --> 1:48:29.260
 I'm not basing that on any hardcore

1:48:29.260 --> 1:48:31.580
 neuro-biological mechanism,

1:48:31.580 --> 1:48:34.220
 but nonetheless,

1:48:34.220 --> 1:48:37.620
 an article was published in the New York Times in 2015

1:48:37.620 --> 1:48:42.380
 that related to some psychological studies that were done

1:48:42.380 --> 1:48:43.620
 as well as some clinical work,

1:48:43.620 --> 1:48:47.460
 as well as some what I would call pop psychology

1:48:47.460 --> 1:48:50.700
 or things that fall outside the domains of academic science.

1:48:50.700 --> 1:48:54.720
 And the whole basis of this article

1:48:54.720 --> 1:48:58.940
 was 36 questions that lead to love.

1:48:58.940 --> 1:49:02.900
 And it involved a listing out indeed of 36 questions,

1:49:02.900 --> 1:49:06.020
 a set divided into set one, set two, and set three

1:49:06.020 --> 1:49:09.880
 that progress from somewhat ordinary questions

1:49:09.880 --> 1:49:13.700
 about life experience and self-report to more,

1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:18.120
 let's call them deep questions about people's values

1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:20.200
 and things that are emotionally close to them.

1:49:20.200 --> 1:49:21.940
 And I'll just give an example of a few of these.

1:49:21.940 --> 1:49:23.280
 You can find this easily online

1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:25.700
 by just putting into your search engine,

1:49:25.700 --> 1:49:27.940
 36 questions that lead to love.

1:49:27.940 --> 1:49:31.700
 Some of the questions in set number one were, for instance,

1:49:31.700 --> 1:49:34.000
 what would constitute a perfect day for you?

1:49:35.360 --> 1:49:37.100
 For what in your life do you feel most grateful,

1:49:37.100 --> 1:49:38.660
 kind of standard questionnaire stuff.

1:49:38.660 --> 1:49:41.940
 In set two, what is your most treasured memory?

1:49:41.940 --> 1:49:43.380
 What is your most terrible memory?

1:49:43.380 --> 1:49:44.860
 So these are, as you can tell,

1:49:44.860 --> 1:49:45.980
 are drilling a little bit deeper

1:49:45.980 --> 1:49:49.260
 into one's personal experience and emotional system.

1:49:49.260 --> 1:49:54.260
 And then set three, questions 25 through 36,

1:49:54.260 --> 1:49:59.260
 are things, what is a very embarrassing moment in your life?

1:50:00.260 --> 1:50:03.260
 When did you last cry in front of another person

1:50:03.260 --> 1:50:04.940
 and by yourself?

1:50:04.940 --> 1:50:07.060
 What is something that's too serious to be joked about?

1:50:07.060 --> 1:50:10.980
 So it's going deeper into one's emotional system.

1:50:10.980 --> 1:50:13.760
 And even questions like of all the people in your family,

1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:16.660
 whose death would you find most disturbing and why?

1:50:16.660 --> 1:50:19.140
 So pretty heavy stuff there at the end.

1:50:19.140 --> 1:50:21.720
 Now, the reason this article got so much traction

1:50:21.720 --> 1:50:22.940
 and the reason I'm bringing it up today

1:50:22.940 --> 1:50:26.220
 is that there was a statement

1:50:26.220 --> 1:50:28.140
 that was made in and around this article,

1:50:28.140 --> 1:50:32.380
 that if two people went on a date

1:50:32.380 --> 1:50:36.460
 or simply sat down and asked each other these questions

1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:39.420
 and each answered these questions

1:50:39.420 --> 1:50:43.200
 and the other was paying attention carefully

1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:48.080
 and at some level, emotionally responding or not responding,

1:50:48.080 --> 1:50:49.240
 but certainly paying attention

1:50:49.240 --> 1:50:51.140
 to the answers of the other person,

1:50:51.140 --> 1:50:53.980
 that by the end of that exchange

1:50:53.980 --> 1:50:56.740
 where one person asks 36 questions

1:50:56.740 --> 1:50:58.560
 and the other person answers all 36,

1:50:58.560 --> 1:51:01.260
 and then the other person asks all 36

1:51:01.260 --> 1:51:03.340
 and the other person answers all 36,

1:51:03.340 --> 1:51:05.620
 that they would fall in love, right?

1:51:05.620 --> 1:51:08.140
 Which seems like kind of a ridiculous thing.

1:51:08.140 --> 1:51:10.820
 And yet it is the case

1:51:10.820 --> 1:51:13.900
 that people who go through this exercise

1:51:13.900 --> 1:51:17.620
 report feeling as if they know the other person quite well

1:51:17.620 --> 1:51:21.260
 and feeling certain levels of attachment

1:51:21.260 --> 1:51:23.780
 or even love and desire for the other person

1:51:23.780 --> 1:51:27.180
 that they would not have predicted, excuse me,

1:51:27.180 --> 1:51:29.200
 would not have predicted

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:31.180
 had they not gone through that process.

1:51:31.180 --> 1:51:33.100
 So what's going on in this exchange of questions

1:51:33.100 --> 1:51:36.640
 and answers of a progressively more emotional

1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:38.540
 and deep level?

1:51:38.540 --> 1:51:40.020
 Well, what I predict is going on

1:51:40.020 --> 1:51:43.060
 is that inside of that exchange,

1:51:43.060 --> 1:51:46.100
 people are creating a sort of delusional story

1:51:46.100 --> 1:51:48.180
 about the nature of the exchange

1:51:48.180 --> 1:51:51.260
 being a reflection of some deeper attachment.

1:51:51.260 --> 1:51:53.960
 And so even though people are just exchanging words,

1:51:53.960 --> 1:51:56.540
 they're not physically touching,

1:51:56.540 --> 1:51:58.220
 they are not, at least not at the point

1:51:58.220 --> 1:52:02.520
 where they're running these kinds of questionnaire studies,

1:52:03.480 --> 1:52:05.380
 they may touch afterwards for all I know

1:52:05.380 --> 1:52:07.320
 and probably did in some cases,

1:52:07.320 --> 1:52:09.740
 but they're not exchanging life experience

1:52:09.740 --> 1:52:11.300
 in an immediate way.

1:52:11.300 --> 1:52:13.100
 They're not actually going off into the world

1:52:13.100 --> 1:52:15.020
 and doing things together yet.

1:52:15.020 --> 1:52:17.800
 They are simply exchanging narrative.

1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:21.220
 But we know based on recent studies,

1:52:21.220 --> 1:52:23.460
 and I've covered this before on this podcast,

1:52:23.460 --> 1:52:24.280
 but I'll mention again,

1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:27.220
 there was a study published in Cell Reports,

1:52:27.220 --> 1:52:29.360
 a cell press journal, excellent journal,

1:52:29.360 --> 1:52:33.900
 showing that when individuals listen to the same narrative,

1:52:33.900 --> 1:52:35.560
 their heart rates tend to synchronize

1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:37.780
 or at least follow a very similar pattern

1:52:37.780 --> 1:52:39.500
 even if they're not in the same room

1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:41.100
 listening to a given narrative.

1:52:41.100 --> 1:52:44.180
 Whereas in this case, people are facing one another

1:52:44.180 --> 1:52:46.660
 listening to the narratives of each other,

1:52:46.660 --> 1:52:49.920
 certainly they are having autonomic responses,

1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:51.500
 and it stands to reason

1:52:51.500 --> 1:52:54.140
 that their autonomic nervous systems are synchronizing

1:52:54.140 --> 1:52:56.660
 much in the same way that the Cell Reports study found

1:52:56.660 --> 1:52:59.880
 that people will synchronize their autonomic nervous systems

1:52:59.880 --> 1:53:03.800
 to a shared heard story from another.

1:53:03.800 --> 1:53:06.260
 In other words, whether or not we hear a story,

1:53:06.260 --> 1:53:08.460
 watch a movie, listen to a song,

1:53:08.460 --> 1:53:11.300
 or exchange our own individual stories,

1:53:11.300 --> 1:53:13.560
 our autonomic nervous systems have the potential

1:53:13.560 --> 1:53:15.000
 to map onto one another.

1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:17.140
 So I'm not all that surprised

1:53:17.140 --> 1:53:21.820
 that people find that they fall in love, in quotes,

1:53:21.820 --> 1:53:24.180
 after answering these questions to one another,

1:53:24.180 --> 1:53:26.820
 because essentially the way these questions are laid out

1:53:26.820 --> 1:53:28.940
 is they establish a narrative,

1:53:28.940 --> 1:53:30.900
 they establish a very personal narrative,

1:53:30.900 --> 1:53:32.800
 and the other person is listening very closely,

1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:35.940
 and we don't have physiological or brain imaging studies

1:53:35.940 --> 1:53:38.640
 to support what I'm about to say,

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:41.580
 but the reasonable interpretation

1:53:41.580 --> 1:53:45.420
 is that that's causing some sort of autonomic synchronization.

1:53:45.420 --> 1:53:47.460
 So if you want to try this on a date,

1:53:47.460 --> 1:53:50.340
 or even it's actually been hypothesized

1:53:50.340 --> 1:53:52.640
 that this could be useful for existing couples,

1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:54.940
 even if they already know the answers

1:53:54.940 --> 1:53:55.940
 to some of these questions,

1:53:55.940 --> 1:53:57.740
 and that doesn't surprise me either.

1:53:57.740 --> 1:53:59.820
 I think that autonomic coordination is present

1:53:59.820 --> 1:54:02.380
 during mating behavior,

1:54:02.380 --> 1:54:05.880
 it's present during shared experience of the outside world,

1:54:05.880 --> 1:54:08.760
 movies, concerts, watching one's children

1:54:08.760 --> 1:54:10.340
 with somebody else, et cetera,

1:54:10.340 --> 1:54:13.400
 and it's established by sharing one's own narrative

1:54:13.400 --> 1:54:15.140
 of their own personal experience.

1:54:15.140 --> 1:54:17.380
 So I don't want to seem overly reductionist,

1:54:17.380 --> 1:54:21.500
 I'll never propose that all of our sensation, perception,

1:54:21.500 --> 1:54:23.500
 action, and experience in life boils down

1:54:23.500 --> 1:54:26.300
 to us just being bags of chemicals

1:54:26.300 --> 1:54:28.020
 and the action of those chemicals

1:54:28.020 --> 1:54:29.620
 or any aspect of our nervous system,

1:54:29.620 --> 1:54:34.540
 and yet in looking across the psychological literature

1:54:34.540 --> 1:54:36.140
 of development of attachment,

1:54:36.140 --> 1:54:37.820
 in the psychological literature

1:54:37.820 --> 1:54:40.060
 of adult and romantic attachment,

1:54:40.060 --> 1:54:43.380
 and what makes and breaks those attachments,

1:54:43.380 --> 1:54:44.940
 it's very clear to me,

1:54:44.940 --> 1:54:47.060
 and I think courses through the literature

1:54:47.060 --> 1:54:48.380
 at multiple levels,

1:54:48.380 --> 1:54:52.360
 that autonomic coordination is absolutely key

1:54:52.360 --> 1:54:55.620
 for the establishment of desire, love, and attachment.

1:54:55.620 --> 1:54:58.540
 In fact, I talked earlier about how our actual conception

1:54:58.540 --> 1:55:00.820
 is born out of autonomic coordination

1:55:00.820 --> 1:55:02.540
 of one sort or another.

1:55:02.540 --> 1:55:05.580
 So again, it doesn't necessarily mean

1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:08.600
 that autonomic nervous systems always be synchronized.

1:55:08.600 --> 1:55:10.340
 In the case of the two categorizations

1:55:10.340 --> 1:55:14.340
 that Fisher proposed of the director slash testosterone type

1:55:14.340 --> 1:55:19.340
 and the nurturing follower slash estrogen type,

1:55:20.180 --> 1:55:22.460
 it was actually the coordination,

1:55:22.460 --> 1:55:25.920
 but in opposite directions of individuals

1:55:25.920 --> 1:55:27.300
 that fall into each of those categories

1:55:27.300 --> 1:55:29.000
 that led to more stable attachments

1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.800
 or the seeking out of those attachments, I should say.

1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:34.580
 But nonetheless, it's, at least to my mind,

1:55:34.580 --> 1:55:37.140
 very clear that autonomic coordination

1:55:37.140 --> 1:55:41.420
 is a hallmark feature of desire,

1:55:41.420 --> 1:55:44.200
 a hallmark feature of what we call love,

1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:47.060
 and a hallmark feature of what we call attachment.

1:55:47.060 --> 1:55:49.500
 And that the breaking of attachments

1:55:49.500 --> 1:55:53.920
 or the failures of desire, the failures of love,

1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:56.700
 and the failures of attachment over time

1:55:56.700 --> 1:55:58.620
 in line with the work of Gottman and others,

1:55:58.620 --> 1:56:02.520
 and even just simply what's required for mating behavior

1:56:02.520 --> 1:56:05.660
 is also reflected in the autonomic nervous system.

1:56:05.660 --> 1:56:07.260
 But in that case, a failure

1:56:07.260 --> 1:56:09.020
 to coordinate the autonomic nervous systems

1:56:09.020 --> 1:56:11.340
 in some sort of concerted way.

1:56:11.340 --> 1:56:13.220
 Any discussion about desire, love,

1:56:13.220 --> 1:56:15.900
 and attachment would be incomplete

1:56:15.900 --> 1:56:20.380
 if we didn't talk about the dreaded infidelity and cheating.

1:56:20.380 --> 1:56:22.340
 Much has been made of infidelity and cheating

1:56:22.340 --> 1:56:24.740
 and whether or not people who are higher on dopamine

1:56:24.740 --> 1:56:27.380
 and sensation seeking tend to cheat more or less.

1:56:27.380 --> 1:56:30.700
 Frankly, I don't think there's any solid evidence for that.

1:56:31.720 --> 1:56:33.060
 I think there are a lot of examples

1:56:33.060 --> 1:56:34.780
 that we can draw from in our own lives

1:56:34.780 --> 1:56:36.780
 and in the lives of others

1:56:36.780 --> 1:56:39.560
 that would generally support one or the other model,

1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:43.380
 but I'm not aware of any decent physiological studies

1:56:43.380 --> 1:56:46.240
 or psychological studies that really point to that.

1:56:46.240 --> 1:56:48.380
 For instance, I would never say

1:56:48.380 --> 1:56:51.780
 that the serotonergic phenotype as described by Fisher

1:56:52.780 --> 1:56:54.760
 is less prone to cheat,

1:56:54.760 --> 1:56:58.600
 or that the people who have an insecure attachment

1:56:58.600 --> 1:57:01.980
 are more likely to cheat, for instance.

1:57:01.980 --> 1:57:04.420
 I don't think those correlations have been drawn

1:57:04.420 --> 1:57:05.860
 in any kind of meaningful way yet,

1:57:05.860 --> 1:57:09.300
 so I would be cautious about assigning them

1:57:09.300 --> 1:57:11.380
 without that evidence.

1:57:11.380 --> 1:57:14.600
 However, there are some interesting studies involving,

1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:18.860
 again, neuroimaging and some subjective measures in humans,

1:57:18.860 --> 1:57:20.300
 meaning asking them questions

1:57:20.300 --> 1:57:23.780
 that they're good ways to tease out lies from truths

1:57:23.780 --> 1:57:25.500
 in these sorts of studies,

1:57:25.500 --> 1:57:30.280
 and whether or not people tend to find their partner

1:57:30.280 --> 1:57:33.460
 or others more or less attractive

1:57:33.460 --> 1:57:36.780
 depending on how people feel about themselves.

1:57:36.780 --> 1:57:39.420
 And I think this is a very interesting aspect

1:57:39.420 --> 1:57:42.380
 to desire, love, and attachment for the following reason.

1:57:43.880 --> 1:57:45.740
 You hear a lot out there

1:57:45.740 --> 1:57:49.900
 that in order to form a really strong relationship,

1:57:49.900 --> 1:57:52.140
 you have to have a good relationship with yourself,

1:57:52.140 --> 1:57:54.380
 or you have to love yourself,

1:57:54.380 --> 1:57:57.400
 or you often hear, for instance,

1:57:57.400 --> 1:58:01.160
 that it's exactly when you're not looking for a relationship

1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:02.000
 that you're going to find one.

1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:03.380
 You hear this stuff, right?

1:58:03.380 --> 1:58:05.760
 But none of that is really grounded in any studies.

1:58:05.760 --> 1:58:07.480
 Again, that's like out of sight, out of mind,

1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:09.340
 or absence makes the heart grow fonder.

1:58:09.340 --> 1:58:13.460
 There are many life examples to support those statements,

1:58:13.460 --> 1:58:15.380
 and there are many life examples

1:58:15.380 --> 1:58:17.280
 to support statements to the opposite.

1:58:19.020 --> 1:58:21.660
 There's a particular study that I found,

1:58:21.660 --> 1:58:23.900
 this was published in Frontiers in Psychology,

1:58:23.900 --> 1:58:27.980
 but it's a experimental study that involves neuroimaging.

1:58:27.980 --> 1:58:31.740
 The title of this study is manipulation of self-expansion

1:58:31.740 --> 1:58:35.460
 alters responses to attractive alternative partners.

1:58:35.460 --> 1:58:37.140
 And I love the design of this study.

1:58:37.140 --> 1:58:40.500
 What they did in this study is they took couples

1:58:40.500 --> 1:58:44.540
 and they evaluated members of that relationship

1:58:44.540 --> 1:58:46.480
 for what's called self-expansion.

1:58:46.480 --> 1:58:48.740
 Now, self-expansion is a metric

1:58:48.740 --> 1:58:53.340
 that involves one's perception of self

1:58:53.340 --> 1:58:56.800
 as seen through the relationship to the other.

1:58:56.800 --> 1:59:01.060
 And this is something that was developed by the authors

1:59:01.060 --> 1:59:03.440
 are Aaron and Aaron, so they have the same last name.

1:59:03.440 --> 1:59:05.900
 So I'm assuming this was either a sibling team

1:59:05.900 --> 1:59:10.180
 or a somehow related team or a romantic couple team,

1:59:10.180 --> 1:59:13.220
 A-R-O-N and A-R-O-N.

1:59:13.220 --> 1:59:17.440
 Aaron and Aaron in 1986 proposed this self-expansion model

1:59:17.440 --> 1:59:18.660
 of close relationships.

1:59:18.660 --> 1:59:20.580
 And they proposed that people are motivated

1:59:20.580 --> 1:59:22.520
 to enter relationships, I'm reading here,

1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:25.780
 in order to enhance the self and increase self-efficacy.

1:59:25.780 --> 1:59:27.940
 In other words, that one of the reasons

1:59:27.940 --> 1:59:29.860
 why many people enter relationships

1:59:29.860 --> 1:59:31.680
 is that it makes us feel good about ourselves

1:59:31.680 --> 1:59:32.520
 and more capable.

1:59:32.520 --> 1:59:34.860
 And I would see that as a healthy interdependence,

1:59:34.860 --> 1:59:36.600
 not necessarily co-dependence.

1:59:38.340 --> 1:59:41.000
 This is especially strong at the beginning of a relationship,

1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:43.660
 it turns out, when people are forming pair bonds.

1:59:43.660 --> 1:59:48.300
 And it's the case that pleasure, arousal, and excitement,

1:59:48.300 --> 1:59:50.660
 again, all hallmark features

1:59:50.660 --> 1:59:52.460
 of autonomic nervous system function,

1:59:52.460 --> 1:59:54.500
 pleasure, arousal, and excitement,

1:59:55.380 --> 1:59:59.100
 give rise to self-expansion, meaning to self-efficacy.

1:59:59.100 --> 2:00:02.240
 So what this self-expansion model is really about

2:00:02.240 --> 2:00:05.460
 is how great other people that we are close to

2:00:05.460 --> 2:00:08.580
 and romantically attached to can potentially make us feel

2:00:09.420 --> 2:00:12.700
 in terms of what they say, in terms of what they do,

2:00:12.700 --> 2:00:17.700
 in terms of the way in which we believe they feel about us.

2:00:18.120 --> 2:00:20.300
 So it doesn't necessarily have to involve

2:00:20.300 --> 2:00:24.040
 explicit statements of them telling us how great we are

2:00:24.040 --> 2:00:27.060
 or them doing great gestures for us,

2:00:27.060 --> 2:00:30.240
 but how we actually feel they feel about us,

2:00:30.240 --> 2:00:32.400
 turns out to be a very strong parameter

2:00:32.400 --> 2:00:33.900
 in terms of how we feel about ourselves

2:00:33.900 --> 2:00:36.220
 and the relationship overall.

2:00:36.220 --> 2:00:37.740
 Now, some of you out there are probably thinking,

2:00:37.740 --> 2:00:40.800
 oh yeah, isn't there this thing, the love languages, right?

2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:42.540
 I don't have any neuroscience to support that.

2:00:42.540 --> 2:00:43.620
 I think the love languages,

2:00:43.620 --> 2:00:45.820
 I'm not super familiar with this, I didn't list it out,

2:00:45.820 --> 2:00:47.820
 but that some people are,

2:00:49.260 --> 2:00:52.060
 their autonomic nervous system, if you will,

2:00:52.060 --> 2:00:56.420
 tends to be very responsive to gifts or to quality time

2:00:56.420 --> 2:00:58.180
 or to physical touch or acts of kindness.

2:00:58.180 --> 2:00:59.280
 I think I've got a few of these, right?

2:00:59.280 --> 2:01:00.240
 I probably have a few wrong.

2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:01.820
 Anyway, they're easy to find online.

2:01:01.820 --> 2:01:04.460
 And people do tend to have a kind of a bias

2:01:04.460 --> 2:01:05.900
 toward two or three of these things

2:01:05.900 --> 2:01:07.860
 that are especially meaningful for them.

2:01:07.860 --> 2:01:09.060
 And when I hear meaningful,

2:01:09.060 --> 2:01:11.860
 I hear they tend to push the autonomic nervous system

2:01:11.860 --> 2:01:13.820
 and neurochemical systems of the brain and body

2:01:13.820 --> 2:01:15.500
 in a direction that makes us feel good

2:01:15.500 --> 2:01:18.020
 as opposed to lousy or neutral.

2:01:18.020 --> 2:01:21.500
 In any event, this study looked at

2:01:21.500 --> 2:01:26.340
 whether or not people have high levels of self-expansion

2:01:26.340 --> 2:01:30.340
 through the actions or statements of their significant other

2:01:30.340 --> 2:01:34.820
 and how that influences their perception of people

2:01:34.820 --> 2:01:36.220
 outside the relationship,

2:01:36.220 --> 2:01:38.940
 meaning how attractive they perceive people

2:01:38.940 --> 2:01:40.840
 outside the relationship to be,

2:01:40.840 --> 2:01:44.820
 turns out to be strongly influenced by A,

2:01:44.820 --> 2:01:47.860
 whether or not their self-expansion

2:01:47.860 --> 2:01:51.600
 is very strongly driven by the other person

2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:53.260
 that they are involved with,

2:01:53.260 --> 2:01:55.420
 that they're in the romantic relationship with,

2:01:55.420 --> 2:01:57.560
 and whether or not that's being expressed to them.

2:01:57.560 --> 2:01:59.060
 So here's how the study went.

2:01:59.940 --> 2:02:03.860
 First of all, they rated or categorized individuals

2:02:03.860 --> 2:02:06.140
 on the basis of the self-expansion metric.

2:02:06.140 --> 2:02:08.700
 Some people have more of a potential

2:02:08.700 --> 2:02:11.800
 to experience self-expansion through others, right?

2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:13.700
 Some of us feel great about ourselves

2:02:13.700 --> 2:02:15.420
 and we're kind of topped off at that.

2:02:15.420 --> 2:02:17.840
 Others don't feel so great about themselves,

2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:20.340
 but they can feel much better in response to praise,

2:02:20.340 --> 2:02:23.820
 in particular praise or self-expansion type behaviors

2:02:23.820 --> 2:02:25.820
 or statements from people that we really care about.

2:02:25.820 --> 2:02:28.180
 And still other people are a mixture of the two,

2:02:28.180 --> 2:02:30.340
 the kind of moderate levels of both.

2:02:30.340 --> 2:02:32.340
 So they rated them on this scale.

2:02:32.340 --> 2:02:34.900
 And then they had people experience

2:02:34.900 --> 2:02:37.220
 self-expansion narratives.

2:02:37.220 --> 2:02:38.540
 They heard their significant other

2:02:38.540 --> 2:02:40.840
 say really terrific things about them

2:02:40.840 --> 2:02:42.820
 and about the relationship in particular,

2:02:42.820 --> 2:02:46.020
 that the relationship that they have was exciting,

2:02:46.020 --> 2:02:47.340
 novel, and challenging.

2:02:47.340 --> 2:02:49.060
 So that was one form of self-expansion.

2:02:49.060 --> 2:02:50.420
 And they went into some detail

2:02:50.420 --> 2:02:51.560
 as to why that was the case

2:02:51.560 --> 2:02:53.340
 in their particular relationship.

2:02:53.340 --> 2:02:57.860
 Or they heard a narrative from their significant other

2:02:57.860 --> 2:03:02.180
 about strong feelings of love between the two

2:03:02.180 --> 2:03:04.600
 that had been experienced previously in the relationship.

2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:07.620
 So in the one case, it sort of directed more towards them.

2:03:07.620 --> 2:03:08.460
 And in the other case,

2:03:08.460 --> 2:03:10.580
 it's more about the relationship itself.

2:03:10.580 --> 2:03:12.820
 And then they did brain imaging

2:03:12.820 --> 2:03:15.680
 of one person in the relationship,

2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:18.640
 while that person assessed the attractiveness

2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:21.140
 of people outside the relationship.

2:03:21.140 --> 2:03:23.860
 And what they found was that people who were primed

2:03:23.860 --> 2:03:28.680
 for this self-expansion had lower activation

2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:30.220
 of brain areas associated

2:03:30.220 --> 2:03:32.560
 with assessing other's attractiveness,

2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:36.620
 then did the people who experienced a lot of self-expansion.

2:03:36.620 --> 2:03:38.860
 Now, the takeaway from that,

2:03:38.860 --> 2:03:40.480
 at least the way I read this study,

2:03:40.480 --> 2:03:44.740
 is if you're with somebody who really benefits from

2:03:44.740 --> 2:03:47.240
 or experiences a lot of self-expansion,

2:03:48.700 --> 2:03:50.500
 unless you really want them to pay attention

2:03:50.500 --> 2:03:52.680
 to the attractiveness of other people,

2:03:52.680 --> 2:03:56.340
 it stands to reason that they would benefit

2:03:56.340 --> 2:04:01.180
 from more self-expansion type gestures or statements.

2:04:01.180 --> 2:04:03.260
 Not so much centered on the relationship.

2:04:03.260 --> 2:04:04.580
 We have such a great relationship.

2:04:04.580 --> 2:04:07.020
 There's so much love, it's so great, that too.

2:04:07.020 --> 2:04:09.660
 But in the context of this study and these findings,

2:04:09.660 --> 2:04:12.180
 that the person is really terrific,

2:04:12.180 --> 2:04:14.040
 that the relationship that they've created together

2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:16.340
 is really exciting, novel, and challenging,

2:04:16.340 --> 2:04:18.620
 that there's a narrative around the relationship

2:04:18.620 --> 2:04:21.120
 that really has a lot to do with the dynamics

2:04:21.120 --> 2:04:22.060
 between the individuals,

2:04:22.060 --> 2:04:24.660
 in particular, that the person who really likes

2:04:24.660 --> 2:04:27.180
 self-expansion is vital to that dynamic, okay?

2:04:27.180 --> 2:04:28.840
 So it's not looking down at the relationship

2:04:28.840 --> 2:04:30.100
 as a set of equals.

2:04:30.100 --> 2:04:32.020
 There is sort of this bias written into this,

2:04:32.020 --> 2:04:34.000
 of that this person is really essential

2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:34.980
 for the relationship.

2:04:34.980 --> 2:04:36.740
 I'm not saying this is something that anyone has to do.

2:04:36.740 --> 2:04:38.060
 I'm not saying this is right or wrong.

2:04:38.060 --> 2:04:40.120
 This is just what the data say.

2:04:40.120 --> 2:04:42.260
 But what's remarkable is that

2:04:42.260 --> 2:04:44.320
 in the absence of those statements,

2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:49.320
 people who have, or that rate high on this scale

2:04:49.460 --> 2:04:52.880
 of self-expansion rate attractive alternative partners

2:04:52.880 --> 2:04:54.460
 as more attractive.

2:04:54.460 --> 2:04:57.120
 Now, that's interesting to me because it means

2:04:57.120 --> 2:05:00.860
 that their actual perception of others is changing.

2:05:00.860 --> 2:05:04.900
 It's not that their opportunity to see others is changing.

2:05:04.900 --> 2:05:08.380
 This is not a matter of them somehow getting access

2:05:08.380 --> 2:05:11.140
 or no access to attractive alternative partners.

2:05:11.140 --> 2:05:12.440
 Again, attractive alternative partner

2:05:12.440 --> 2:05:14.940
 is literally the language in the title of this paper.

2:05:14.940 --> 2:05:17.140
 They're still seeing all these attractive people.

2:05:17.140 --> 2:05:21.460
 It's just that if they're feeling filled up in air quotes,

2:05:21.460 --> 2:05:24.500
 psychologically filled up, emotionally filled up,

2:05:24.500 --> 2:05:28.420
 autonomically filled, enhanced in the language

2:05:28.420 --> 2:05:31.480
 that we're using today by the self-expansion narrative,

2:05:31.480 --> 2:05:34.740
 well then the same set of attractive faces

2:05:34.740 --> 2:05:38.460
 appear less attractive to a given individual.

2:05:38.460 --> 2:05:41.460
 Now, whether or not this predicts cheating or loyalty,

2:05:41.460 --> 2:05:42.980
 I certainly can't say.

2:05:42.980 --> 2:05:45.760
 That would be very hard to assess in neuroimaging.

2:05:45.760 --> 2:05:49.900
 And there, of course, people rarely,

2:05:49.900 --> 2:05:53.200
 if ever report accurately their cheating behavior.

2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:56.200
 There are some studies in which confidentiality is assured

2:05:56.200 --> 2:05:59.180
 to the point where people seem to be more trusting

2:05:59.180 --> 2:06:01.780
 and willing to reveal cheating behavior.

2:06:01.780 --> 2:06:03.560
 But if you look at the statistics on cheating behavior,

2:06:03.560 --> 2:06:07.100
 it's very hard to track because people lie all the time

2:06:07.100 --> 2:06:09.220
 about their cheating in and outside of the context

2:06:09.220 --> 2:06:12.560
 of psychological and neuroimaging studies.

2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:14.900
 But I find this study, again,

2:06:14.900 --> 2:06:16.700
 the title Manipulation of Self-Expansion

2:06:16.700 --> 2:06:19.140
 alters responses to attractive alternative partners

2:06:19.140 --> 2:06:21.940
 to be absolutely fascinating because again,

2:06:21.940 --> 2:06:25.540
 it points to the fact that the interactions

2:06:25.540 --> 2:06:29.380
 with our significant others shapes our autonomic arousal,

2:06:29.380 --> 2:06:31.540
 shapes our perception of self,

2:06:31.540 --> 2:06:34.000
 and thereby shapes our perception

2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.740
 of other potential partners in the outside world

2:06:36.740 --> 2:06:40.100
 or shuts us down to the potential of other people

2:06:40.100 --> 2:06:41.460
 in the outside world.

2:06:41.460 --> 2:06:43.020
 So when I hear statements such as,

2:06:43.020 --> 2:06:44.620
 it's important that you love yourself

2:06:44.620 --> 2:06:47.180
 in order to really fall in love with somebody else,

2:06:47.180 --> 2:06:51.300
 or it is when one is not looking for a relationship

2:06:51.300 --> 2:06:53.060
 that they're most likely to fall in love

2:06:53.060 --> 2:06:54.620
 and form a stable relationship,

2:06:56.240 --> 2:06:58.060
 I can filter that through these findings

2:06:58.060 --> 2:07:01.460
 to say that it's really the person

2:07:01.460 --> 2:07:06.460
 who needs a lot of self-expansion stimulating statements

2:07:06.460 --> 2:07:09.120
 or actions coming from other people

2:07:09.120 --> 2:07:13.760
 that is most prone to seeing other potential partners

2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:15.720
 out in the world as attractive.

2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:18.360
 And in this sense, we can return

2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:22.080
 to the autonomic nervous system as kind of a glass

2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:24.480
 that it can be filled up through various contexts.

2:07:24.480 --> 2:07:27.240
 It can be filled up through our own ability to regulate it.

2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:30.600
 It can be filled up through other people's ability

2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:32.820
 to enhance our sense of wellbeing.

2:07:32.820 --> 2:07:35.500
 And in some sense, this points to an idea

2:07:35.500 --> 2:07:37.680
 where it is true that the better

2:07:37.680 --> 2:07:39.040
 that we can feel about ourselves

2:07:39.040 --> 2:07:43.520
 in the absence of any self-expansion type input

2:07:43.520 --> 2:07:45.620
 from somebody else really does place us

2:07:45.620 --> 2:07:48.140
 on more stable ground such that when we do receive

2:07:48.140 --> 2:07:50.500
 that praise or we do receive those acts of kindness

2:07:50.500 --> 2:07:53.240
 or service or physical touch or whatever they are,

2:07:53.240 --> 2:07:58.240
 that we are able to further enhance the way that we feel,

2:07:58.720 --> 2:08:02.120
 but that we don't necessarily tether all of our feelings

2:08:02.120 --> 2:08:06.640
 of self-worth or self-expansion to that one individual.

2:08:06.640 --> 2:08:10.200
 So you might think that if person A can only receive

2:08:10.200 --> 2:08:13.560
 the self-expansion from the statements,

2:08:13.560 --> 2:08:15.740
 from the action of the person they're involved with,

2:08:15.740 --> 2:08:19.600
 person B, that that will form a very stable bond.

2:08:19.600 --> 2:08:21.220
 But what this study points to is the fact

2:08:21.220 --> 2:08:23.480
 that that's a very unstable bond,

2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:26.140
 that person A is actually very susceptible

2:08:26.140 --> 2:08:27.440
 to the attractiveness of others

2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:29.680
 because they're so desperately attached

2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:31.180
 to this notion of self-expansion,

2:08:31.180 --> 2:08:32.520
 even if they don't realize it.

2:08:32.520 --> 2:08:34.320
 And so this really does point to the idea

2:08:34.320 --> 2:08:36.520
 that while it is important

2:08:36.520 --> 2:08:38.880
 to link our autonomic nervous systems

2:08:38.880 --> 2:08:42.340
 to establish desire, love, and attachment,

2:08:42.340 --> 2:08:45.880
 that we want to have a stable internal representation

2:08:45.880 --> 2:08:49.120
 of ourselves, a stable autonomic nervous system

2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:50.460
 to some degree or another,

2:08:50.460 --> 2:08:54.640
 so that we can be in stable romantic partnership

2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:55.680
 with another individual

2:08:55.680 --> 2:08:57.380
 if that's what we're really trying to do.

2:08:57.380 --> 2:08:59.200
 So until now, I've been weaving together studies

2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:01.960
 from the field of experimental psychology

2:09:01.960 --> 2:09:03.800
 and the fields of neuroscience,

2:09:03.800 --> 2:09:05.300
 in particular, neuroimaging.

2:09:06.140 --> 2:09:10.440
 But if you recall back to the very beginning of the episode

2:09:10.440 --> 2:09:15.400
 when I was discussing how odors and how hormones

2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:18.460
 and how even birth control can shape people's ratings

2:09:18.460 --> 2:09:20.660
 of attractiveness of others,

2:09:21.760 --> 2:09:24.680
 you'll realize that there's a deeper layer to all this,

2:09:24.680 --> 2:09:29.280
 which is that our biology that resides below

2:09:29.280 --> 2:09:33.160
 our conscious awareness, things like our hormones,

2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:36.180
 things like pheromones even,

2:09:36.180 --> 2:09:41.180
 are shaping the way that we choose, interpret, and act

2:09:42.920 --> 2:09:45.080
 with other potential romantic partners

2:09:45.080 --> 2:09:48.360
 or the romantic partners that we already have.

2:09:48.360 --> 2:09:52.640
 Now, this cannot be overemphasized, right?

2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:56.020
 No matter how much we would like to create

2:09:56.020 --> 2:09:58.420
 a sort of top-down description,

2:09:58.420 --> 2:10:01.820
 meaning from the cortex and our understanding of things

2:10:01.820 --> 2:10:04.640
 onto what we find attractive, who we find attractive,

2:10:04.640 --> 2:10:07.600
 what we enjoy, what we don't enjoy in the pursuit

2:10:07.600 --> 2:10:10.720
 and romantic interactions with others,

2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:14.140
 there always seems to be, and indeed there always is,

2:10:14.140 --> 2:10:18.080
 a deeper layer in which our subconscious processing

2:10:18.080 --> 2:10:20.820
 drives us to find a particular person

2:10:20.820 --> 2:10:22.520
 to be particularly attractive,

2:10:22.520 --> 2:10:26.000
 or in which we have chemistry with somebody,

2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:29.200
 or in which we lack chemistry with somebody.

2:10:29.200 --> 2:10:33.760
 And I would say that one of the more exciting, fascinating,

2:10:33.760 --> 2:10:37.840
 and indeed mysterious aspects of desire, love,

2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:41.360
 and attachment are those subconscious processes,

2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:44.040
 those things that we call chemistry, right?

2:10:44.040 --> 2:10:46.260
 I mean, people will report, for instance,

2:10:46.260 --> 2:10:49.440
 that somebody's smell is just absolutely

2:10:49.440 --> 2:10:51.440
 positively intoxicating for them,

2:10:51.440 --> 2:10:53.840
 or that somebody's smell is absolutely repulsive to them,

2:10:53.840 --> 2:10:55.740
 and they don't know why.

2:10:55.740 --> 2:10:58.280
 That the taste of someone's breath,

2:10:58.280 --> 2:11:00.600
 and I don't mean that in any kind of poetic sense,

2:11:00.600 --> 2:11:03.560
 I literally mean the taste of somebody's breath,

2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:07.320
 in some cases, can be very exciting to somebody.

2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:09.840
 And believe it or not, we can taste each other's breath.

2:11:09.840 --> 2:11:12.440
 I talked about this in the chemical sensing episode

2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:17.080
 some months back, but we actually have receptors

2:11:17.080 --> 2:11:20.320
 for taste and smell that engage in coordinated action,

2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:23.280
 such that we can't really separate taste and smell

2:11:23.280 --> 2:11:25.740
 at some level, and this is especially true

2:11:25.740 --> 2:11:28.360
 when it comes to the formation of romantic relationships

2:11:28.360 --> 2:11:30.040
 and what we call chemistry.

2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:32.800
 Now, is chemistry absolutely required

2:11:32.800 --> 2:11:36.880
 for forming stable attachments for love and for desire?

2:11:36.880 --> 2:11:38.800
 No, of course they're not.

2:11:38.800 --> 2:11:42.820
 But in general, these are primitive mechanisms

2:11:42.820 --> 2:11:44.440
 that exist in all animals.

2:11:44.440 --> 2:11:47.360
 They exist in special forms in humans,

2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:51.020
 but that they drive us toward behaviors that will,

2:11:52.140 --> 2:11:55.560
 as the theory goes, lead to love and attachment.

2:11:55.560 --> 2:11:58.220
 Not always, as Dr. Fisher pointed out,

2:11:58.220 --> 2:12:00.780
 that sex and sex drive is one way

2:12:00.780 --> 2:12:03.200
 to explore potential love relationships

2:12:03.200 --> 2:12:05.800
 and to explore potential attachments,

2:12:05.800 --> 2:12:08.440
 which of course are major investments

2:12:08.440 --> 2:12:11.240
 that extend well beyond one night or a week

2:12:11.240 --> 2:12:13.420
 or a vacation or even a year.

2:12:13.420 --> 2:12:15.920
 When we talk about stable attachments in general,

2:12:15.920 --> 2:12:18.840
 that means long-term attachments in humans.

2:12:18.840 --> 2:12:23.840
 Now, there is a biology to all of that chemistry stuff,

2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:27.300
 and the studies of oral contraception

2:12:27.300 --> 2:12:29.440
 and men finding women more attractive

2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:31.540
 at certain phases of their menstrual cycle

2:12:32.480 --> 2:12:34.520
 and women finding men more attractive

2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:36.980
 at certain phases of the woman's menstrual cycle

2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:39.600
 point to the incredible power

2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:41.520
 of those deeper biological mechanisms.

2:12:43.060 --> 2:12:44.640
 In the Huberman Lab podcast,

2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:47.600
 I discussed both science and science-based tools,

2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:50.740
 and so I'd be remiss if I didn't actually cover

2:12:50.740 --> 2:12:52.320
 some of the tools that relate

2:12:52.320 --> 2:12:55.100
 to those deeper biological mechanisms.

2:12:55.100 --> 2:12:59.100
 Now, the hormones testosterone and estrogen

2:12:59.100 --> 2:13:02.640
 are almost always the first biological chemicals

2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:06.580
 and hormones that are mentioned and described and explored

2:13:06.580 --> 2:13:09.820
 when thinking about desire

2:13:09.820 --> 2:13:12.360
 and love and attachment too, for that matter,

2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:15.160
 since love and attachment stem from desire.

2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:19.600
 I did an entire episode about the biology

2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:21.520
 of testosterone and estrogen

2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:25.140
 and ways to optimize testosterone and estrogen.

2:13:25.140 --> 2:13:28.480
 You can easily find that episode at HubermanLab.com.

2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:29.400
 It's timestamped.

2:13:29.400 --> 2:13:31.200
 There you can find all sorts of information

2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:34.820
 about how certain behaviors or absence of behaviors

2:13:34.820 --> 2:13:37.680
 drive up or down testosterone and estrogen.

2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:41.120
 I also dispel some myths about sexual behavior

2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:42.560
 and things like masturbation

2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:45.680
 and how they relate to testosterone and estrogen,

2:13:45.680 --> 2:13:48.480
 as well as some myths about how those hormones change

2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:49.560
 across the lifespan.

2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:52.580
 I also talk about the role of exercise.

2:13:52.580 --> 2:13:54.040
 I talk about supplementation,

2:13:54.040 --> 2:13:55.580
 and I also talk a little bit

2:13:55.580 --> 2:13:57.100
 about hormone replacement therapy,

2:13:57.100 --> 2:13:59.680
 although that will be the topic for a future episode.

2:13:59.680 --> 2:14:01.160
 So if you're interested in the biology

2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:02.600
 of testosterone and estrogen,

2:14:02.600 --> 2:14:05.440
 two hormones that absolutely influence things

2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:07.700
 like libido and desire,

2:14:07.700 --> 2:14:08.920
 please check out that episode

2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:12.220
 as well as what I'm going to talk about in just a moment.

2:14:12.220 --> 2:14:13.920
 The simple stereotyped version

2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:16.860
 of the hormones testosterone and estrogen

2:14:16.860 --> 2:14:19.680
 are that testosterone drives libido

2:14:19.680 --> 2:14:21.800
 or increases it, AKA sex drive,

2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:23.980
 and that estrogen somehow blunts it

2:14:23.980 --> 2:14:26.840
 or is not involved in libido and sex drive.

2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:29.000
 And that is simply not the case.

2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:30.540
 As I described in that

2:14:30.540 --> 2:14:33.180
 testosterone and estrogen optimization episode,

2:14:33.180 --> 2:14:35.020
 and as I'll tell you now,

2:14:35.020 --> 2:14:38.800
 yes, testosterone and some of its other forms

2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:42.120
 like dihydrotestosterone are strongly related

2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:45.400
 to libido and sex drive and the pursuit

2:14:45.400 --> 2:14:46.560
 and ability to mate.

2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:51.440
 However, the hormone estrogen is also strongly associated

2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:53.640
 with libido and mating behavior.

2:14:53.640 --> 2:14:57.780
 So much so that for people that either chemically

2:14:57.780 --> 2:15:00.960
 or for some other reason have very low estrogen,

2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:02.920
 libido can severely suffer.

2:15:02.920 --> 2:15:06.240
 So it's a coordinated dance of estrogen and testosterone

2:15:06.240 --> 2:15:09.320
 in both males and females that leads to libido

2:15:09.320 --> 2:15:10.360
 or sex drive.

2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:13.360
 So I absolutely wanted to make clear

2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:16.600
 that it's not a simple relationship

2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:18.520
 between testosterone and sex drive

2:15:18.520 --> 2:15:19.560
 or estrogen and sex drive.

2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:23.280
 Both are required at appropriate ratios.

2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:26.080
 Now, with that said,

2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:30.400
 there are things that can shift libido

2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:33.600
 in both men and women in the direction

2:15:33.600 --> 2:15:37.000
 of more desire or more desire to mate,

2:15:37.000 --> 2:15:41.720
 either to seek mates or to mate with existing partners.

2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:44.300
 And there's a quite solid literature

2:15:44.300 --> 2:15:46.720
 around a few of those substances.

2:15:46.720 --> 2:15:49.560
 Now, a common misconception is that because dopamine

2:15:49.560 --> 2:15:52.200
 is involved in motivation and drive,

2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:54.240
 that simply increasing dopamine

2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:57.440
 through any number of different mechanisms or tools

2:15:57.440 --> 2:15:59.880
 will increase libido and sex drive.

2:15:59.880 --> 2:16:04.040
 And that's simply not the case either.

2:16:04.040 --> 2:16:08.460
 It is true that some level of dopamine

2:16:08.460 --> 2:16:11.080
 or increase in dopamine is required

2:16:11.080 --> 2:16:14.200
 for increases in libido.

2:16:14.200 --> 2:16:16.620
 However, because of dopamine's relationship

2:16:16.620 --> 2:16:18.400
 to the autonomic nervous system,

2:16:18.400 --> 2:16:21.200
 and because the autonomic nervous system

2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:24.400
 is so intimately involved, no pun intended,

2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:28.760
 in sexual activity in seeking and actual mating behavior

2:16:28.760 --> 2:16:30.560
 as I described earlier,

2:16:30.560 --> 2:16:32.680
 it's actually the case that if people

2:16:32.680 --> 2:16:35.640
 drive their dopamine system too high,

2:16:35.640 --> 2:16:40.640
 they will be in states of arousal that are high enough

2:16:40.640 --> 2:16:44.400
 such that they seek and want sexual activity,

2:16:44.400 --> 2:16:47.420
 but they can't actually engage the parasympathetic arm

2:16:47.420 --> 2:16:49.240
 of the autonomic nervous system sufficient

2:16:49.240 --> 2:16:51.200
 to become physically aroused.

2:16:51.200 --> 2:16:53.800
 Now, there's a whole description of this

2:16:53.800 --> 2:16:55.540
 that awaits us in a future episode,

2:16:55.540 --> 2:16:58.060
 but I'll summarize now by saying

2:16:58.060 --> 2:17:01.180
 for people that are taking substances

2:17:01.180 --> 2:17:03.320
 just simply to increase dopamine,

2:17:04.720 --> 2:17:06.520
 in order to increase libido,

2:17:06.520 --> 2:17:09.800
 that can be a potentially hazardous route to follow

2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:13.840
 because depending on whether or not that dopamine level

2:17:13.840 --> 2:17:16.820
 is high enough that it puts them into a mode

2:17:16.820 --> 2:17:20.880
 of seeking mates or mating,

2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:23.800
 but they can't adjust their autonomic nervous system

2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:25.440
 during actual mating behavior,

2:17:25.440 --> 2:17:27.440
 what essentially is I'm saying is it can place people

2:17:27.440 --> 2:17:29.020
 into a chronic pursuit,

2:17:29.020 --> 2:17:30.960
 but an inability to perform sexually.

2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:33.520
 And this is true for men and women, okay?

2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:37.200
 So I would just caution people against just thinking,

2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:40.760
 oh, a lack of libido is simply a lack of dopamine.

2:17:40.760 --> 2:17:41.920
 That is not the case.

2:17:41.920 --> 2:17:44.820
 It could be from lower levels of dopamine,

2:17:44.820 --> 2:17:47.680
 but it could also be for other reasons.

2:17:47.680 --> 2:17:50.040
 And so these systems, these signaling systems

2:17:50.040 --> 2:17:53.120
 and these neurochemicals are very intricate

2:17:53.120 --> 2:17:55.800
 and just simply ramping up dopamine

2:17:55.800 --> 2:17:58.160
 has actually been found for instance,

2:17:58.160 --> 2:18:00.060
 in amphetamine and cocaine users,

2:18:00.060 --> 2:18:02.480
 there is a phenomenon in which they become hyper aroused,

2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:03.720
 but can't perform sexually.

2:18:03.720 --> 2:18:06.720
 This is also true for people who take elevated levels

2:18:06.720 --> 2:18:11.040
 of other recreational drugs or who take antidepressants

2:18:11.040 --> 2:18:14.200
 that increase the dopamine system too much, right?

2:18:14.200 --> 2:18:17.000
 Dosage has to be worked out with your physician,

2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:21.000
 with your psychiatrist, such that mood is enhanced

2:18:21.000 --> 2:18:24.720
 and the various aspects of a healthy wellbeing,

2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:26.020
 mind and body are enhanced,

2:18:26.020 --> 2:18:29.400
 but not so much so that that what we call the arousal arc

2:18:29.400 --> 2:18:34.400
 is locked with the seesaw in the sympathetic drive position

2:18:34.520 --> 2:18:37.560
 such that sexual arousal can't occur, okay?

2:18:37.560 --> 2:18:39.900
 So this is an important point to make

2:18:39.900 --> 2:18:43.320
 because I think that a lot of people are under the impression

2:18:43.320 --> 2:18:47.080
 that if they just drive up testosterone, increase dopamine,

2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:48.580
 and generally get themselves

2:18:48.580 --> 2:18:50.240
 into high states of autonomic arousal,

2:18:50.240 --> 2:18:52.520
 that that's going to increase their libido,

2:18:52.520 --> 2:18:54.620
 but that's simply not the way the system works.

2:18:54.620 --> 2:18:57.580
 It's that seesaw and that seesawing back and forth

2:18:57.580 --> 2:19:01.280
 that is the arc of arousal that we talked about earlier.

2:19:01.280 --> 2:19:03.920
 Now, there are substances,

2:19:03.920 --> 2:19:06.440
 legal over-the-counter substances

2:19:06.440 --> 2:19:09.260
 that fall under the categorization of supplements

2:19:09.260 --> 2:19:13.140
 that do indeed increase libido and arousal.

2:19:13.140 --> 2:19:14.440
 And so I'm going to talk about some of those

2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:17.620
 in the context of peer reviewed literature now.

2:19:17.620 --> 2:19:18.960
 I want to be clear, however,

2:19:18.960 --> 2:19:21.600
 that these are by no means required.

2:19:21.600 --> 2:19:22.980
 Many people have healthy libidos

2:19:22.980 --> 2:19:26.400
 or have libidos that are healthy for their life

2:19:26.400 --> 2:19:28.260
 and what they need and want.

2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:32.500
 And as always, in any discussion about supplementation,

2:19:32.500 --> 2:19:34.360
 you absolutely have to check with your physician.

2:19:34.360 --> 2:19:35.640
 I don't just say that to protect us.

2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:37.120
 I say that to protect you.

2:19:37.120 --> 2:19:38.920
 Your health and wellbeing is dependent on you

2:19:38.920 --> 2:19:40.540
 doing certain things and not doing others,

2:19:40.540 --> 2:19:42.080
 and everybody is different.

2:19:42.080 --> 2:19:43.640
 Nonetheless, there are studies

2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:45.800
 that point to specific substances

2:19:45.800 --> 2:19:47.440
 that are sold over-the-counter

2:19:47.440 --> 2:19:49.320
 that at least in the United States are legal

2:19:49.320 --> 2:19:53.540
 and that have been shown to be statistically significant

2:19:53.540 --> 2:19:56.160
 in increasing measures of libido.

2:19:56.160 --> 2:19:58.440
 There are many such substances,

2:19:58.440 --> 2:20:00.920
 but three that in particular

2:20:00.920 --> 2:20:04.240
 have good peer reviewed research to support them

2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:09.240
 are MACA, M-A-C-A, which is actually a root.

2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:13.160
 Tongat Ali, also sometimes called longjack.

2:20:13.160 --> 2:20:14.940
 I didn't name them, forgive me.

2:20:14.940 --> 2:20:18.800
 And tribulus, or tribulus it's sometimes called.

2:20:18.800 --> 2:20:21.440
 I'm going to talk about each of these in sequence,

2:20:21.440 --> 2:20:23.820
 but on the whole,

2:20:24.720 --> 2:20:27.960
 the studies on MACA are quite convincing

2:20:27.960 --> 2:20:32.960
 that consumption of two to three grams per day of MACA,

2:20:33.400 --> 2:20:36.740
 which generally is sold as a powder or a capsule,

2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:40.000
 typically consumed early in the day

2:20:40.000 --> 2:20:42.020
 because it can be somewhat of a stimulant,

2:20:42.020 --> 2:20:44.040
 meaning it can increase alertness

2:20:44.040 --> 2:20:46.940
 and you wouldn't want it to interfere with sleep

2:20:46.940 --> 2:20:48.640
 by taking it too late in the day.

2:20:48.640 --> 2:20:51.940
 But in studies that include both men and women

2:20:51.940 --> 2:20:54.400
 of durations anywhere from eight to 12 weeks

2:20:55.320 --> 2:20:57.480
 of athletes and non-athletes

2:20:57.480 --> 2:21:00.520
 and different variations of MACA,

2:21:00.520 --> 2:21:03.600
 turns out there's black MACA, red MACA, yellow MACA.

2:21:03.600 --> 2:21:06.080
 There are a bunch of different forms of MACA,

2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:10.040
 but that they can increase subjective reports

2:21:10.040 --> 2:21:15.040
 of sexual desire independent of hormone systems.

2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:16.760
 Meaning it does not seem,

2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:19.040
 at least based on the existing literature,

2:21:19.040 --> 2:21:22.080
 that MACA increases testosterone or changes estrogen,

2:21:22.080 --> 2:21:24.920
 at least not on the timescales that these studies were done

2:21:24.920 --> 2:21:27.760
 or with the measures that were performed in these studies.

2:21:27.760 --> 2:21:31.520
 But that MACA, again, consumed in doses

2:21:31.520 --> 2:21:34.240
 of anywhere from two to three grams per day

2:21:34.240 --> 2:21:37.520
 has been shown to significantly increase libido.

2:21:37.520 --> 2:21:41.820
 And in fact, those dosages of MACA have been shown

2:21:41.820 --> 2:21:46.820
 to offset so-called SSRI induced sexual dysfunction.

2:21:47.280 --> 2:21:51.060
 So there are various routes to sexual dysfunction.

2:21:51.060 --> 2:21:55.140
 The SSRIs are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

2:21:55.140 --> 2:21:57.280
 They go by name brands like Prozac and Zoloft,

2:21:57.280 --> 2:21:58.640
 and there are many others now,

2:21:58.640 --> 2:22:00.660
 and generic forms and so forth.

2:22:00.660 --> 2:22:03.620
 Those don't always, I should point out,

2:22:03.620 --> 2:22:04.920
 lead to sexual dysfunction.

2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:06.880
 There's a dose dependence.

2:22:06.880 --> 2:22:09.660
 Some people do quite well on SSRIs

2:22:09.660 --> 2:22:11.660
 and don't have any issues with sexual function.

2:22:11.660 --> 2:22:15.280
 Other people suffer quite a lot from sexual dysfunction

2:22:15.280 --> 2:22:18.040
 while taking SSRIs, highly variable.

2:22:18.040 --> 2:22:22.840
 You need to work with a physician, a qualified psychiatrist.

2:22:22.840 --> 2:22:25.300
 But nonetheless, everything I've been saying

2:22:25.300 --> 2:22:29.400
 about MACA thus far has also been explored

2:22:29.400 --> 2:22:32.000
 in the context of SSRI induced sexual dysfunction.

2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:34.960
 The paper that I'm referring to here

2:22:34.960 --> 2:22:37.840
 is a double-blind randomized pilot dose finding study

2:22:37.840 --> 2:22:39.020
 of MACA root.

2:22:39.020 --> 2:22:41.920
 It goes by the name LMIENI.

2:22:41.920 --> 2:22:43.160
 These always have fancy names,

2:22:43.160 --> 2:22:45.780
 and the Latin names in biology are always more complicated,

2:22:45.780 --> 2:22:48.520
 but it's MACA root for the management of SSRI

2:22:48.520 --> 2:22:49.880
 induced sexual dysfunction.

2:22:49.880 --> 2:22:52.680
 First author is Doerding, D-O-R-D-I-N-G.

2:22:53.640 --> 2:22:56.040
 This was a study done at Mass General,

2:22:56.040 --> 2:22:59.960
 which is one of the satellite locations around Harvard.

2:22:59.960 --> 2:23:02.740
 Harvard Med, it's associated with Harvard Med,

2:23:02.740 --> 2:23:06.940
 that found significant improvements in libido

2:23:06.940 --> 2:23:08.880
 when people were taking a pretty low dose.

2:23:08.880 --> 2:23:11.980
 It was actually, in this case, just 1.5 grams per day,

2:23:13.280 --> 2:23:16.840
 up to a high dose, three grams per day of MACA.

2:23:16.840 --> 2:23:17.920
 And they were doing this

2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:20.560
 in 20 remitted depressed outpatients.

2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:22.120
 So these are people that had depression.

2:23:22.120 --> 2:23:25.000
 Their depression was successfully treated with SSRIs,

2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:25.960
 but they were suffering

2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:28.560
 from some of these SSRI-related sexual effects,

2:23:28.560 --> 2:23:31.420
 and MACA seemed to offset some of those effects

2:23:31.420 --> 2:23:33.660
 significantly in this population.

2:23:33.660 --> 2:23:37.380
 The other studies exploring the lack of effect

2:23:37.380 --> 2:23:41.200
 on serum testosterone in adult healthy men

2:23:41.200 --> 2:23:42.720
 was a 12-week study,

2:23:42.720 --> 2:23:46.640
 again, consuming anywhere from 1.5 to 3 milligrams,

2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:50.520
 meaning, excuse me, 1,500 milligrams to 3,000 milligrams

2:23:50.520 --> 2:23:51.340
 or placebo.

2:23:51.340 --> 2:23:56.340
 So again, this is 1.5 up to three grams of MACA or placebo,

2:23:56.840 --> 2:24:00.680
 and they rated sexual desire, depression,

2:24:00.680 --> 2:24:04.600
 and other measures such as testosterone in the blood.

2:24:04.600 --> 2:24:08.520
 Again, no change in testosterone or estrogen,

2:24:08.520 --> 2:24:11.040
 estradiol levels in men treated with MACA

2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:12.540
 and those treated with placebo.

2:24:12.540 --> 2:24:15.440
 But nonetheless, there was a significant

2:24:15.440 --> 2:24:17.400
 and positive effect on libido

2:24:17.400 --> 2:24:21.160
 with this dosage of 1.5 to three grams per day of MACA.

2:24:21.160 --> 2:24:24.920
 And there are several other studies that also show this,

2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:28.480
 again, in people that are taking SSRIs

2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:31.200
 and people that are not taking SSRIs

2:24:31.200 --> 2:24:34.980
 in chronically over-trained athletes.

2:24:34.980 --> 2:24:36.240
 This was also found to be the case.

2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:38.880
 So it seems like across the board,

2:24:38.880 --> 2:24:42.020
 MACA is a fairly useful supplement

2:24:42.020 --> 2:24:44.800
 for those that are seeking to increase their libido.

2:24:44.800 --> 2:24:47.420
 And there are fewer studies involving women,

2:24:47.420 --> 2:24:49.760
 but there are a few such studies

2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:52.520
 that also point to the same general positive effect

2:24:52.520 --> 2:24:55.960
 on libido in women taking MACA at equivalent doses

2:24:55.960 --> 2:24:57.440
 to those I just described.

2:24:57.440 --> 2:25:00.120
 I think it's noteworthy that MACA supplementation

2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:04.180
 does not seem to adjust testosterone or estrogen levels

2:25:04.180 --> 2:25:07.420
 to any significant degree, but it does change libido.

2:25:07.420 --> 2:25:09.440
 I think that points to the fact

2:25:09.440 --> 2:25:11.840
 that there are multiple systems in the brain and body

2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:15.160
 that influence libido, not just testosterone and estrogen.

2:25:15.160 --> 2:25:16.460
 And indeed, we know that to be the case.

2:25:16.460 --> 2:25:21.040
 Things like PEA, which is a substance found in chocolate

2:25:21.040 --> 2:25:23.680
 and is a substance that some people supplement

2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:27.100
 is known, for instance, to increase sexual desire,

2:25:27.100 --> 2:25:30.220
 but also the perception of sexual experiences

2:25:30.220 --> 2:25:32.640
 as more stimulating, for instance.

2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:34.520
 So there are a lot of pathways in the brain,

2:25:34.520 --> 2:25:36.840
 in particular in the hypothalamus,

2:25:36.840 --> 2:25:39.900
 this ancient area of our brain that harbors neurons

2:25:39.900 --> 2:25:43.560
 and hormone secreting cells, including neurons,

2:25:43.560 --> 2:25:46.760
 that can shape our perceptions of our,

2:25:46.760 --> 2:25:50.560
 even just our tactile experience of others

2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:51.780
 and their attractiveness,

2:25:51.780 --> 2:25:53.920
 and indeed can shift levels of desire

2:25:53.920 --> 2:25:58.120
 independent of changing levels of circulating hormones.

2:25:58.120 --> 2:26:01.120
 Another substance that has been shown to increase libido

2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:06.120
 across a range of human populations is so-called Tonga Ali.

2:26:06.780 --> 2:26:09.080
 I've talked a little bit about this before

2:26:09.080 --> 2:26:13.360
 on the Huberman Lab podcast in reference to testosterone.

2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:14.880
 And I've talked about it extensively

2:26:14.880 --> 2:26:16.580
 as a guest on other podcasts.

2:26:16.580 --> 2:26:19.100
 Tonga Ali goes by a number of different names.

2:26:20.380 --> 2:26:22.640
 One of them is exceedingly difficult for me to pronounce.

2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:26.780
 It's Yurikoma longifolia, also called longjack,

2:26:27.820 --> 2:26:30.400
 but Tonga Ali is the typical name.

2:26:30.400 --> 2:26:31.360
 This is an herb.

2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:34.840
 There's a Malaysian version and an Indonesian version.

2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:37.480
 My understanding is that the Indonesian variety

2:26:37.480 --> 2:26:39.960
 of Tonga Ali is the one that is most potent

2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:43.020
 for its effects on libido.

2:26:43.880 --> 2:26:46.280
 Previously, I've talked about Tonga Ali

2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:49.720
 taken in 400 milligram per day capsules

2:26:49.720 --> 2:26:53.160
 as a means to increase the amount of free,

2:26:53.160 --> 2:26:55.200
 meaning unbound testosterone.

2:26:55.200 --> 2:26:58.920
 So testosterone has a both bound form and an unbound form.

2:26:58.920 --> 2:27:03.060
 Very briefly, the bound form is bound to albumin in the blood

2:27:03.060 --> 2:27:06.440
 or to so-called sex hormone binding globulin.

2:27:06.440 --> 2:27:10.620
 When it's bound, it can't be biologically active

2:27:10.620 --> 2:27:11.960
 at many cells.

2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:13.800
 It is important that some of it be bound

2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:15.880
 in order to get a sort of time release

2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:18.380
 and proper distribution of testosterone through the body,

2:27:18.380 --> 2:27:21.040
 but is the unbound free testosterone

2:27:21.040 --> 2:27:23.480
 that can really have its most potent effects.

2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:26.600
 And there's some evidence that Tonga Ali

2:27:26.600 --> 2:27:28.840
 can increase the amount of unbound,

2:27:28.840 --> 2:27:30.620
 so-called free testosterone

2:27:30.620 --> 2:27:33.200
 by lowering sex hormone binding globulin.

2:27:33.200 --> 2:27:34.840
 Although it is almost certain

2:27:34.840 --> 2:27:38.580
 that it has other routes of mechanism as well.

2:27:38.580 --> 2:27:41.900
 Nonetheless, there are some reports

2:27:41.900 --> 2:27:44.920
 of Tonga Ali increasing libido.

2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:48.400
 One particular article, last author,

2:27:48.400 --> 2:27:51.480
 or I should say last name of first author, excuse me,

2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:53.480
 Ismail, I-S-M-A-L.

2:27:53.480 --> 2:27:57.680
 This was published in an evidence-based complimentary

2:27:57.680 --> 2:27:58.880
 and alternative medicine.

2:27:58.880 --> 2:28:02.680
 It's from 2012, reports a significant increase

2:28:02.680 --> 2:28:05.120
 in libido and sexual function.

2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:07.920
 There are other such studies, not a lot of them,

2:28:07.920 --> 2:28:12.840
 not as many robust controlled quality peer reviewed studies

2:28:12.840 --> 2:28:14.120
 as there are from Maca.

2:28:14.120 --> 2:28:16.720
 Nonetheless, a number of people, men and women,

2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:19.340
 that I know do take Tonga Ali

2:28:19.340 --> 2:28:21.160
 and it seems to work well for them.

2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:22.580
 The question always comes up

2:28:22.580 --> 2:28:23.880
 around discussion of supplements.

2:28:23.880 --> 2:28:25.420
 Do you need to cycle these things?

2:28:25.420 --> 2:28:26.880
 The only way to determine that

2:28:26.880 --> 2:28:29.920
 is really to do your blood work, monitor liver enzymes,

2:28:29.920 --> 2:28:32.160
 monitor hormone levels and so forth.

2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:35.120
 So I simply can't say whether or not you need to

2:28:35.120 --> 2:28:36.680
 or you don't need to cycle them.

2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:40.920
 Typically Tonga Ali and Maca are not cycled

2:28:40.920 --> 2:28:43.600
 in any regular kind of way that I'm aware of,

2:28:43.600 --> 2:28:46.280
 but again, you really need to check with your doctor

2:28:46.280 --> 2:28:49.220
 if you're going to initiate taking any of these things.

2:28:49.220 --> 2:28:50.920
 And you certainly should do your best

2:28:50.920 --> 2:28:53.540
 to monitor your blood work as well as subjective measures

2:28:53.540 --> 2:28:55.420
 in evaluating whether or not they're working for you,

2:28:55.420 --> 2:28:56.720
 say for you and so forth.

2:28:56.720 --> 2:28:59.280
 The third and final substance slash supplement

2:28:59.280 --> 2:29:01.960
 that I want to touch on as it relates to libido

2:29:01.960 --> 2:29:04.720
 is called tribulus terrestis.

2:29:04.720 --> 2:29:09.720
 So that's T-R-I-B-U-L-U-S, terrestis, T-E-R-R-E-S, T-R-I-S.

2:29:09.720 --> 2:29:14.720
 This is a commonly sold over-the-counter supplement

2:29:16.340 --> 2:29:21.340
 for increasing testosterone for fitness purposes and so on.

2:29:22.580 --> 2:29:24.640
 Whether or not it actually does that

2:29:24.640 --> 2:29:27.680
 to a meaningful degree isn't clear,

2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:31.160
 but I'm aware of four peer-reviewed studies

2:29:32.080 --> 2:29:36.720
 that were focused on both males and females

2:29:36.720 --> 2:29:39.800
 ranging anywhere from 18 years old

2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:43.200
 all the way up to 65 plus, they say 65 plus,

2:29:43.200 --> 2:29:45.800
 I guess it could be 70, it could be 80, I don't know,

2:29:45.800 --> 2:29:48.640
 but a fairly broad age range

2:29:48.640 --> 2:29:53.160
 where people took anywhere from 750 milligrams per day

2:29:55.360 --> 2:29:57.400
 divided into three equal doses.

2:29:57.400 --> 2:30:01.340
 So 750 total per day divided into three equal doses

2:30:01.340 --> 2:30:05.400
 of tribulus or placebo for 120 days.

2:30:05.400 --> 2:30:08.720
 This particular study was focused on females

2:30:08.720 --> 2:30:11.160
 and according to the female sexual function

2:30:11.160 --> 2:30:13.940
 index questionnaire, no significant difference

2:30:13.940 --> 2:30:15.560
 between any of the groups.

2:30:15.560 --> 2:30:19.240
 However, free and bioavailable testosterone

2:30:19.240 --> 2:30:21.860
 increased in the group taking tribulus terrestis.

2:30:21.860 --> 2:30:25.280
 Total testosterone did not reach statistical significance.

2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:28.440
 So this is sort of the inverse of what we see with maca

2:30:28.440 --> 2:30:31.120
 where there do seem to be increases in testosterone

2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:34.720
 which would predict that there would be increase in libido,

2:30:34.720 --> 2:30:37.920
 in this case, this was post-menopausal women,

2:30:37.920 --> 2:30:39.220
 there was no increase in libido,

2:30:39.220 --> 2:30:41.120
 there was an increase in testosterone.

2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:43.680
 I mention it only because there might be instances

2:30:43.680 --> 2:30:47.760
 in which people want to increase their testosterone.

2:30:47.760 --> 2:30:50.240
 It does seem that tribulus, at least in that population,

2:30:50.240 --> 2:30:51.840
 is capable of doing that.

2:30:51.840 --> 2:30:54.480
 Now, there's a separate study that was done,

2:30:54.480 --> 2:30:57.080
 a double-blind study lasting anywhere

2:30:57.080 --> 2:31:00.280
 from one to six months that had a clear

2:31:00.280 --> 2:31:02.360
 and significant increase in libido.

2:31:02.360 --> 2:31:05.080
 Now, this was taking six grams.

2:31:05.080 --> 2:31:09.520
 So that's 6,000 milligrams of tribulus root for 60 days.

2:31:09.520 --> 2:31:11.740
 And it did seem to increase various aspects

2:31:11.740 --> 2:31:12.900
 of sexual function.

2:31:13.960 --> 2:31:17.600
 And there was what appeared to be a substantial

2:31:17.600 --> 2:31:20.280
 16.3% increase in testosterone.

2:31:20.280 --> 2:31:21.800
 But in this particular study,

2:31:21.800 --> 2:31:24.680
 because of the variability across individuals

2:31:24.680 --> 2:31:27.620
 that did not actually arrive at statistical significance.

2:31:27.620 --> 2:31:29.680
 Now, there were a number of other studies

2:31:29.680 --> 2:31:32.560
 that explored the role of tribulus,

2:31:32.560 --> 2:31:34.640
 in particular in females.

2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:37.640
 And one of those studies was a study

2:31:37.640 --> 2:31:39.220
 that was actually quite short.

2:31:39.220 --> 2:31:43.040
 It was two to four weeks, it involved 67 subjects.

2:31:43.040 --> 2:31:46.480
 These were subjects that had experienced a loss of libido

2:31:46.480 --> 2:31:50.040
 and took tribulus divided into two equal doses,

2:31:50.040 --> 2:31:51.600
 compared that to placebo.

2:31:51.600 --> 2:31:54.360
 And they did see a significant improvement

2:31:54.360 --> 2:31:58.020
 in these measures of sexual desire and function

2:31:58.020 --> 2:32:00.400
 on this female sexual function index.

2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:03.160
 So there is some evidence that tribulus can be effective

2:32:03.160 --> 2:32:06.080
 in increasing testosterone in certain populations,

2:32:06.080 --> 2:32:08.760
 in increasing sexual desire and function

2:32:08.760 --> 2:32:12.000
 in certain populations, particular in females.

2:32:12.000 --> 2:32:13.920
 I think more studies are certainly needed,

2:32:13.920 --> 2:32:17.880
 but these three substances slash supplements,

2:32:17.880 --> 2:32:20.960
 makka, tonga ali in particular,

2:32:20.960 --> 2:32:23.720
 Indonesian tonga ali and tribulus

2:32:23.720 --> 2:32:27.040
 can indeed create significant increases

2:32:27.040 --> 2:32:29.520
 in sexual desire and in some cases

2:32:29.520 --> 2:32:33.180
 by adjusting the testosterone and estrogen system,

2:32:33.180 --> 2:32:35.000
 in some cases not by adjusting

2:32:35.000 --> 2:32:36.600
 the testosterone and estrogen system.

2:32:36.600 --> 2:32:40.640
 Again, pointing to the complexity of neurochemicals

2:32:40.640 --> 2:32:44.600
 and features that adjust things like libido, aka desire.

2:32:44.600 --> 2:32:46.720
 So we covered a lot of material today

2:32:46.720 --> 2:32:49.120
 related to desire, love, and attachment.

2:32:49.120 --> 2:32:52.600
 And yet I acknowledge that it is not exhaustive

2:32:52.600 --> 2:32:56.760
 of the vast landscape that is the psychology and biology

2:32:56.760 --> 2:32:59.100
 of desire, love, and attachment.

2:32:59.100 --> 2:33:01.360
 Nonetheless, I hope that you found

2:33:01.360 --> 2:33:04.680
 the information interesting and hopefully actionable

2:33:04.680 --> 2:33:07.200
 in some cases toward the relationships

2:33:07.200 --> 2:33:08.880
 of your past, of present,

2:33:08.880 --> 2:33:13.200
 and potentially for the relationships of your future.

2:33:13.200 --> 2:33:15.680

 Some of that material overlaps

2:34:03.040 --> 2:34:04.960
 with material covered on the podcast.

2:34:04.960 --> 2:34:06.400
 Some of it is unique material

2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:08.520
 only covered on Instagram and Twitter.

2:34:08.520 --> 2:34:10.800
 During today's episode and on many previous episodes

2:34:10.800 --> 2:34:14.060
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discussed supplements.

2:34:14.060 --> 2:34:15.680
 While supplements aren't necessary

2:34:15.680 --> 2:34:17.440
 or appropriate for everybody,

2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:19.780
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:34:19.780 --> 2:34:22.760
 for things like enhancing sleep, enhancing focus,

2:34:22.760 --> 2:34:26.640
 or as discussed today, for enhancing libido and desire.

2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:28.360
 If you want to see the supplements that I take,

2:34:28.360 --> 2:34:29.780
 you can go to Thorne.

2:34:29.780 --> 2:34:34.280
 That's T-H-O-R-N-E.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:34:34.280 --> 2:34:37.100
 And there you can get 20% off any of the supplements

2:34:37.100 --> 2:34:38.100
 that I take.

2:34:38.100 --> 2:34:40.300
 And if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

2:34:40.300 --> 2:34:43.920
 through that portal, thorne.com slash the letter U

2:34:43.920 --> 2:34:46.560

2:34:46.560 --> 2:34:48.920
 any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

2:34:48.920 --> 2:34:49.960
 We partnered with Thorne

2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:52.400
 because Thorne has the absolute highest standards

2:34:52.400 --> 2:34:54.680
 with respect to the quality of the ingredients

2:34:54.680 --> 2:34:57.080
 in their supplements and the precision of the amounts

2:34:57.080 --> 2:34:58.240
 of those supplements.
