00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.120
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.120 --> 00:12.960
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.960 --> 00:15.080
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.700
 Today, we're going to talk all about hearing and balance

00:18.700 --> 00:22.200
 and how you can use your ability to hear specific things

00:22.200 --> 00:27.000
 and your balance system in order to learn anything faster.

00:27.000 --> 00:29.520
 The auditory system, meaning the hearing system,

00:29.520 --> 00:30.680
 and your balance system,

00:30.680 --> 00:32.520
 which is called the vestibular system,

00:33.460 --> 00:37.000
 interact with all the other systems of the brain and body

00:37.000 --> 00:39.240
 and used properly can allow you

00:39.240 --> 00:41.020
 to learn information more quickly,

00:41.020 --> 00:45.040
 remember that information longer and with more ease,

00:45.040 --> 00:47.800
 and you can also improve the way you can hear.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.440
 You can improve your balance.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.840
 We're going to talk about tools for all of that.

00:53.400 --> 00:56.260
 This is one area of science where we understand a lot

00:56.260 --> 00:59.240
 about the cells and the mechanisms in the ear

00:59.240 --> 01:00.840
 and in the brain and so forth,

01:00.840 --> 01:02.480
 so we're going to talk about that a little bit,

01:02.480 --> 01:05.660
 and then we're going to get directly into protocols,

01:05.660 --> 01:06.800
 meaning tools.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.380
 We're also going to talk about ways

01:09.380 --> 01:11.920
 in which the auditory and balance systems suffer.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.140
 We're going to talk about tinnitus,

01:13.140 --> 01:15.920
 which is this ringing of the ears that,

01:15.920 --> 01:18.420
 unfortunately for people that suffer from it,

01:18.420 --> 01:19.840
 they really suffer.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.540
 It's very intrusive for them.

01:21.540 --> 01:24.400
 We're going to talk about some treatments that can work

01:24.400 --> 01:25.760
 in some circumstances

01:25.760 --> 01:29.040
 and some of the more recent emerging treatments

01:29.040 --> 01:31.640
 that I think many people aren't aware of.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.180
 We're also going to talk about this,

01:33.180 --> 01:34.840
 what seems like kind of a weird fact,

01:34.840 --> 01:38.800
 which is that 70% of people, all people,

01:38.800 --> 01:41.980
 make what are called autoacoustic emissions.

01:41.980 --> 01:43.520
 Their ears actually make noises.

01:43.520 --> 01:46.780
 Chances are your ears are making noises right now,

01:46.780 --> 01:48.440
 but you can't perceive them,

01:48.440 --> 01:51.560
 and yet those can have an influence on other people

01:51.560 --> 01:53.800
 and animals in your environment.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.240
 It's a fascinating aspect to your biology.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.080
 You're going to learn a lot about how your biology

01:59.080 --> 02:01.940
 and brain and ears and the so-called inner ear

02:01.940 --> 02:03.080
 that's associated with balance,

02:03.080 --> 02:05.480
 you're going to learn a lot about how all those work.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.420
 You're going to learn a lot of neuroscience.

02:07.420 --> 02:10.000
 I'll even tell you what type of music to listen to,

02:10.000 --> 02:10.960
 and if you listen to me,

02:10.960 --> 02:13.660
 you can leverage that in order to learn faster.

02:13.660 --> 02:15.580
 Before we begin talking about the science

02:15.580 --> 02:17.600
 of hearing and balance and tools

02:17.600 --> 02:20.360
 that leverage hearing and balance for learning faster,

02:20.360 --> 02:22.080
 I want to provide some information

02:22.080 --> 02:24.880
 about another way to learn much faster.

02:24.880 --> 02:27.820
 There's a paper that was published recently.

02:27.820 --> 02:30.620
 This is a paper that was published in Cell Reports,

02:30.620 --> 02:32.400
 an excellent journal.

02:32.400 --> 02:36.500
 It's a peer-reviewed paper from a really excellent group

02:36.500 --> 02:38.900
 looking at skill learning.

02:39.740 --> 02:42.340
 Now, previously, I've talked about

02:42.340 --> 02:45.300
 how in the attempt to learn skills,

02:45.300 --> 02:50.300
 the vital thing to do is to get lots of repetitions.

02:50.580 --> 02:52.540
 You've heard of the 10,000 hours thing.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.180
 You've heard of lots of different strategies

02:55.180 --> 02:57.980
 for learning faster, 80-20 rule and all that.

02:57.980 --> 03:00.960
 The bottom line is you need to generate

03:00.960 --> 03:03.500
 many, many repetitions of something

03:03.500 --> 03:04.660
 that you're trying to learn,

03:04.660 --> 03:06.500
 and the errors that you generate

03:06.500 --> 03:08.340
 are also very important for learning.

03:10.080 --> 03:13.020
 It also turns out that taking rest

03:14.140 --> 03:16.520
 within the learning episode is very important.

03:16.520 --> 03:19.380
 I want to be really clear what I'm referring to here.

03:19.380 --> 03:20.980
 In earlier episodes,

03:20.980 --> 03:23.180
 I've discussed how when you're trying to learn something,

03:23.180 --> 03:26.640
 it's beneficial, it's been shown in scientific studies,

03:26.640 --> 03:30.100
 that if you take a 20-minute shallow nap

03:31.060 --> 03:33.820
 or you simply do nothing after a period of learning,

03:33.820 --> 03:35.880
 that it enhances the rates of learning

03:35.880 --> 03:37.060
 and the depth of learning,

03:37.060 --> 03:40.820
 your ability to learn and remember that information.

03:40.820 --> 03:43.120
 What I'm about to describe are new data

03:43.120 --> 03:46.620
 that say that you actually should be injecting rest

03:46.620 --> 03:48.540
 within the learning episode.

03:48.540 --> 03:51.900
 I'm not talking about going to sleep while learning.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.340
 This is the way that the study was done.

03:54.340 --> 03:57.060
 The study involved having people

03:57.060 --> 04:00.300
 learn sequences of numbers or keys on a piano.

04:00.300 --> 04:03.180
 So let's use the keys on a piano example.

04:03.180 --> 04:06.500
 I'm not a musician, but I think I'll get this correct.

04:08.360 --> 04:12.220
 They asked people to practice a sequence of keys,

04:12.220 --> 04:16.980
 G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,

04:16.980 --> 04:19.260
 and they would practice that either continually

04:19.260 --> 04:21.020
 for a given amount of time,

04:21.020 --> 04:23.300
 or they would just do that for 10 seconds.

04:23.300 --> 04:26.820
 They would play G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G,

04:26.820 --> 04:28.420
 G-D-F-E-G for 10 seconds,

04:28.420 --> 04:31.780
 and then they would take a 10-second pause, a rest.

04:31.780 --> 04:35.460
 They would just take a space or a period of time

04:35.460 --> 04:37.080
 where they do nothing for 10 seconds.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.420
 Then they would go back to G-D-F-E-G, G-D-F-E-G.

04:40.420 --> 04:43.840
 So the two conditions essentially

04:44.720 --> 04:46.740
 were to have people practice continually,

04:46.740 --> 04:50.640
 lots of repetitions, or to inject or insert

04:50.640 --> 04:53.420
 these periods of 10 seconds idle time

04:53.420 --> 04:54.540
 where they're not doing anything,

04:54.540 --> 04:55.860
 they're not looking at their phone,

04:55.860 --> 04:57.060
 they're not focusing on anything,

04:57.060 --> 04:59.020
 they're just letting their mind drift

04:59.020 --> 05:00.620
 wherever it wants to go,

05:00.620 --> 05:04.260
 and they are not touching the keys on the keyboard.

05:04.260 --> 05:07.460
 What they found was that the rates of learning,

05:07.460 --> 05:10.300
 the skill acquisition and the retention of the skills

05:10.300 --> 05:11.980
 was significantly faster

05:11.980 --> 05:14.400
 when they injected these short periods of rest,

05:14.400 --> 05:16.260
 these 10-second rest periods.

05:16.260 --> 05:19.380
 And the rates of learning were,

05:19.380 --> 05:22.780
 when I say significantly faster, were much, much faster.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.120
 I'll reveal what that was in just a moment.

05:25.120 --> 05:28.460
 But you might ask, why would this work?

05:28.460 --> 05:31.020
 Why would it be that injecting these 10-second rest periods

05:31.020 --> 05:32.740
 would enhance rates of learning?

05:32.740 --> 05:35.300
 What they called them was micro-offline gains

05:35.300 --> 05:37.180
 because they're sort of taking their brain offline

05:37.180 --> 05:38.420
 from the learning task for a moment.

05:38.420 --> 05:42.060
 Well, it turns out the brain isn't going offline at all.

05:42.060 --> 05:43.460
 You've probably heard of the hippocampus,

05:43.460 --> 05:45.520
 the area of the brain involved in memory,

05:45.520 --> 05:47.220
 and the neocortex, the area of the brain

05:47.220 --> 05:50.340
 that's involved in processing sensory information.

05:50.340 --> 05:53.500
 Well, it turns out that during these brief periods of rest,

05:53.500 --> 05:55.600
 these 10-second rest periods,

05:55.600 --> 05:59.940
 the hippocampus and the cortex are active in ways

06:00.780 --> 06:05.780
 such that you get a 20-times repeat of the GDFEG.

06:06.580 --> 06:08.200
 It's a temporal compression, as they say.

06:08.200 --> 06:12.460
 So basically, the rehearsal continues while you rest,

06:12.460 --> 06:14.700
 but at 20 times the speed.

06:14.700 --> 06:17.620
 So if you were normally getting just, let's just say,

06:17.620 --> 06:22.620
 five repetitions of GDFEG, GDFEG, GDFEG per 10 seconds,

06:23.100 --> 06:25.080
 now you multiply that times 20.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.720
 In the rest periods, you've practiced it 100 times.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.100
 Your brain has practiced it.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.100
 We know this because they were doing brain imaging,

06:31.100 --> 06:33.780
 functional imaging of these people with brain scanners

06:33.780 --> 06:35.360
 while they were doing this.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.920
 This is an absolutely staggering effect.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.140
 And it's one that, believe it or not,

06:41.140 --> 06:43.460
 has been hypothesized or thought to exist

06:43.460 --> 06:45.580
 for a very long time.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.900
 This effect is called the spacing effect,

06:50.900 --> 06:55.900
 and it was actually first proposed by Ebington in 1885.

06:56.940 --> 06:58.820
 And since then, it's been demonstrated

06:58.820 --> 07:01.340
 for a huge number of different what they call domains,

07:01.340 --> 07:04.180
 in the cognitive domain, so for learning languages,

07:04.180 --> 07:06.240
 in the physical domain, so for learning skills

07:06.240 --> 07:08.540
 that involve a motor sequence.

07:08.540 --> 07:10.720
 It's been demonstrated for a huge number

07:10.720 --> 07:13.660
 of different categories of learning.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.060
 If you want to learn all about the spacing effect

07:17.060 --> 07:19.460
 and the categories of learning that it can impact,

07:19.460 --> 07:21.360
 there's a wonderful review article.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.160
 I'll provide a link to it.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.420
 The title of the review article is

07:25.420 --> 07:28.220
 Parallels Between Spacing Effects During Behavioral

07:28.220 --> 07:29.100
 and Cellular Learning.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.040
 What that review really does is it ties

07:31.040 --> 07:33.660
 the behavioral learning and the improvement of skill

07:33.660 --> 07:37.540
 to the underlying changes in neurons

07:37.540 --> 07:39.500
 that can explain that learning.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.960
 I should mention that the paper that I'm referring to,

07:41.960 --> 07:45.040
 the more recent paper that injects these 10-second

07:45.040 --> 07:49.140
 little micro offline gains rest periods,

07:49.140 --> 07:52.340
 is the work of the laboratory of Leonard Cohen,

07:52.340 --> 07:54.300
 not the musician Leonard Cohen.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.340
 He passed away, he was not a neuroscientist,

07:56.340 --> 07:59.780
 a wonderful poet and musician, but not a neuroscientist.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.420
 Again, the paper was published in Cell Reports,

08:01.420 --> 08:04.340
 and we will provide a link to the full paper as well.

08:04.340 --> 08:08.220
 So the takeaway is if you're trying to learn something,

08:08.220 --> 08:09.640
 you need to get those reps in,

08:09.640 --> 08:12.940
 but one way that you can get 20 times the number of reps in

08:12.940 --> 08:16.040
 is by injecting these little 10-second periods

08:16.040 --> 08:17.080
 of doing nothing.

08:17.980 --> 08:19.580
 Again, during those rest periods,

08:19.580 --> 08:21.900
 you really don't want to attend to anything else

08:21.900 --> 08:22.780
 as much as possible.

08:22.780 --> 08:24.260
 You could close your eyes if you want,

08:24.260 --> 08:26.780
 or you can just simply wait and then get right back

08:26.780 --> 08:28.720
 into generating repetitions.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.960
 I find these papers that Cell Reports and other journals

08:31.960 --> 08:34.180
 have been publishing recently to be fascinating

08:34.180 --> 08:36.120
 because they're really helping us understand

08:36.120 --> 08:39.080
 what are the best protocols for learning anything,

08:39.080 --> 08:41.740
 and they really leverage the fact

08:41.740 --> 08:44.420
 that the brain is willing to generate repetitions for us,

08:44.420 --> 08:47.660
 provided that we give it the rest that it needs.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.760
 So inject rest throughout the learning period,

08:49.760 --> 08:52.660
 and if you can, based on the scientific data,

08:52.660 --> 08:54.860
 you would also want to take a 20-minute nap

08:54.860 --> 08:56.820
 or a 20-minute decompressed period

08:56.820 --> 09:00.080
 where you're not doing anything after a period of learning.

09:00.080 --> 09:02.960
 I think those could both synergize

09:02.960 --> 09:05.180
 in order to enhance learning even further,

09:05.180 --> 09:07.020
 although that hasn't been looked at yet.

09:07.020 --> 09:09.540
 Before we begin talking about hearing and balance,

09:09.540 --> 09:11.740
 I just want to mention that this podcast is separate

09:11.740 --> 09:14.260
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

09:14.260 --> 09:16.500
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

09:16.500 --> 09:19.380
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

09:19.380 --> 09:22.540
 and science-related tools to the general public.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.040
 In keeping with that theme,

09:24.040 --> 09:27.100
 I want to thank the sponsors of today's podcast

09:27.100 --> 09:29.400
 and make it clear that we only work with sponsors

09:29.400 --> 09:31.340
 whose products we absolutely love

09:31.340 --> 09:34.780
 and that we think you will benefit from as well.

09:34.780 --> 09:36.840
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.860
 Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses

09:38.860 --> 09:42.660
 that, in my opinion, are the very highest quality available.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.900
 The company was founded by two All-American swimmers

09:44.900 --> 09:47.860
 from Stanford, and everything about their eyeglasses

09:47.860 --> 09:52.420
 and sunglasses were created with performance in mind.

09:52.420 --> 09:55.080
 These eyeglasses and sunglasses have a number of features

09:55.080 --> 09:56.220
 that really make them unique.

09:56.220 --> 09:58.060
 First of all, they're extremely lightweight.

09:58.060 --> 10:01.540
 The optical clarity of the lenses is spectacular.

10:01.540 --> 10:02.940
 And for the sunglasses,

10:02.940 --> 10:04.260
 they have this really great feature,

10:04.260 --> 10:07.640
 which is as you move in and out of shadows

10:07.640 --> 10:11.320
 or as across the day, the amount of sunshine might change,

10:11.320 --> 10:14.360
 you always experience the world as clear and bright.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.840
 And that can only come from really understanding

10:16.840 --> 10:18.580
 how the visual system works.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.500
 The visual system has all these mechanisms

10:20.500 --> 10:22.660
 for adaptation and habituation.

10:22.660 --> 10:24.220
 You don't need to know how those things work,

10:24.220 --> 10:26.180
 but the folks at Roca clearly do

10:26.180 --> 10:27.940
 because you put these glasses on

10:27.940 --> 10:30.020
 and you don't even notice that they're on.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.380
 They also stay on your face even if you get sweaty.

10:32.380 --> 10:34.740
 They were designed to be used while active,

10:34.740 --> 10:37.260
 so running and biking, et cetera, or indoors.

10:37.260 --> 10:38.340
 One thing that I really like

10:38.340 --> 10:40.540
 about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

10:40.540 --> 10:42.340
 is that the aesthetic is terrific.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.540
 Even though they were designed for performance,

10:44.540 --> 10:46.980
 unlike a lot of sunglasses out there

10:46.980 --> 10:48.300
 that were designed for performance

10:48.300 --> 10:50.920
 that look kind of ridiculous, kind of space age,

10:50.920 --> 10:54.060
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses, you could wear anywhere.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.180
 And the aesthetic is really clean

10:56.180 --> 10:57.860
 and they have a huge number of different styles

10:57.860 --> 10:59.220
 to select from.

10:59.220 --> 11:00.920
 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,

11:00.920 --> 11:04.340
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A dot com,

11:08.260 --> 11:10.420
 That's Roca, R-O-K-A dot com,

11:10.420 --> 11:12.620
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

11:12.620 --> 11:15.960
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.380
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

11:18.380 --> 11:21.120
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

11:21.120 --> 11:22.720
 to help you better understand your body

11:22.720 --> 11:24.620
 and reach your health goals.

11:24.620 --> 11:27.740
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

11:27.740 --> 11:30.660
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

11:30.660 --> 11:33.180
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

11:33.180 --> 11:35.960
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.220
 And now with the advent of DNA tests,

11:38.220 --> 11:40.980
 we can get further insight and information

11:40.980 --> 11:43.740
 into how our metabolism is working,

11:43.740 --> 11:47.580
 how our brain is functioning, how our endocrine system,

11:47.580 --> 11:49.900
 meaning our hormone system is functioning.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.180
 One of the issues with a lot of companies and programs

11:52.180 --> 11:54.680
 that involve getting blood and DNA tests, however,

11:54.680 --> 11:56.020
 is that you get the information back,

11:56.020 --> 11:57.620
 you don't know what to do with that information.

11:57.620 --> 12:00.160
 With Inside Tracker, they make all of that very easy.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.980
 First of all, they can send someone to your home

12:01.980 --> 12:03.320
 to take the samples if you like,

12:03.320 --> 12:04.960
 or you can go to a local clinic.

12:06.060 --> 12:07.480
 You get the information back,

12:07.480 --> 12:08.820
 and of course you get all the numbers

12:08.820 --> 12:12.460
 and levels of hormone factors, metabolic factors, et cetera.

12:12.460 --> 12:15.780
 But the dashboard in Inside Tracker provides directives

12:15.780 --> 12:17.560
 so that if you want to bring those numbers up

12:17.560 --> 12:18.820
 or bring them down,

12:18.820 --> 12:20.500
 or if you want to keep them in the same range,

12:20.500 --> 12:24.420
 it points to specific regimens related to nutrition,

12:24.420 --> 12:26.460
 exercise, and other lifestyle factors.

12:26.460 --> 12:28.180
 So you can really move around those numbers

12:28.180 --> 12:31.460
 to best suit your health goals and health status.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.960
 If you want to try Inside Tracker,

12:32.960 --> 12:35.980
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman,

12:35.980 --> 12:39.020
 and you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.

12:39.020 --> 12:41.260
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.140
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Headspace.

12:44.140 --> 12:45.540
 Headspace is a meditation app

12:45.540 --> 12:48.220
 that's backed by 25 published studies.

12:48.220 --> 12:49.580
 And in addition to those,

12:49.580 --> 12:51.900
 there are hundreds of studies showing

12:51.900 --> 12:54.860
 that meditation is beneficial for our brain

12:54.860 --> 12:56.340
 and for our body.

12:56.340 --> 12:58.740
 One of the challenges, however, is maintaining

12:58.740 --> 13:00.260
 a meditation practice.

13:00.260 --> 13:01.960
 I started meditating a long time ago,

13:01.960 --> 13:05.040
 but I found it very hard to keep that practice going.

13:05.040 --> 13:07.300
 Then I discovered the Headspace meditation app,

13:07.300 --> 13:09.900
 and what I found was that because they have meditations

13:09.900 --> 13:12.080
 that are very short, as well as some that are longer

13:12.080 --> 13:14.020
 and some that are much longer,

13:14.020 --> 13:15.620
 I could maintain my meditation practice.

13:15.620 --> 13:17.620
 Sometimes I do a short five-minute meditation.

13:17.620 --> 13:19.700
 Sometimes I do 20-minute meditation.

13:19.700 --> 13:22.740
 I try and meditate at least 20 minutes per day,

13:22.740 --> 13:25.540
 but sometimes, some weeks, I only do it five times a week,

13:25.540 --> 13:27.140
 and I'll just meditate for longer.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.100
 So with Headspace, you have the full palette

13:29.100 --> 13:31.120
 of meditations to select from.

13:31.120 --> 13:32.400
 If you want to try Headspace,

13:32.400 --> 13:35.600
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer,

13:35.600 --> 13:38.360
 and if you do that, you'll get a free one-month trial,

13:38.360 --> 13:40.220
 so no cost whatsoever,

13:40.220 --> 13:41.940
 with their full library of meditations.

13:41.940 --> 13:44.020
 That's the best offer that they have.

13:44.020 --> 13:46.200
 So again, if you want to try Headspace

13:46.200 --> 13:49.280
 and you want to get access to all their meditations for free,

13:49.280 --> 13:52.840
 go to headspace.com slash special offer.

13:52.840 --> 13:53.680
 Can you hear me?

13:53.680 --> 13:55.960
 Can you hear me?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.360
 Okay, well, if you can hear me, that's amazing,

13:58.360 --> 14:01.960
 because what it means is that my voice

14:01.960 --> 14:04.920
 is causing little tiny changes in the airwaves,

14:04.920 --> 14:06.720
 wherever you happen to be,

14:06.720 --> 14:10.480
 and that your ears and whatever's contained in those ears

14:10.480 --> 14:13.700
 and in your brain can take those sound waves

14:13.700 --> 14:14.860
 and make sense of them,

14:14.860 --> 14:17.500
 and that is an absolutely fantastic

14:17.500 --> 14:20.140
 and staggering feat of biology,

14:20.140 --> 14:23.700
 and yet we understand a lot about how that process works.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.140
 So I'm going to teach it to you now in simple terms

14:26.140 --> 14:28.100
 over the next few minutes.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.900
 So what we call ears have a technical name.

14:31.820 --> 14:34.660
 That technical name is oracles,

14:34.660 --> 14:36.940
 but more often they're called pinna.

14:36.940 --> 14:40.360
 The pinna is P-I-N-N-A, pinna,

14:40.360 --> 14:42.980
 and the pinna of your ears,

14:42.980 --> 14:45.880
 this outer part that is made of cartilage and stuff,

14:45.880 --> 14:50.140
 is a range such that it can capture sound

14:50.140 --> 14:53.320
 in the best way for your head size.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.980
 We're going to talk about ear size also,

14:54.980 --> 14:57.160
 because it turns out that your ears change size

14:57.160 --> 15:01.020
 across the lifespan and that how big your ears are,

15:01.020 --> 15:05.120
 or rather how fast your ears are changing size

15:05.120 --> 15:08.140
 is a pretty good indication of how fast you're aging.

15:08.140 --> 15:09.460
 So we'll get to that in a few minutes,

15:09.460 --> 15:12.820
 but I want to talk about these things that we call ears

15:12.820 --> 15:14.940
 and some of the stuff contained within them

15:14.940 --> 15:16.640
 that allow us to hear.

15:16.640 --> 15:19.540
 So the shape of these ears that we have

15:20.500 --> 15:23.300
 is such that it amplifies high frequency sounds.

15:23.300 --> 15:25.500
 High frequency sounds as the name suggests

15:25.500 --> 15:27.020
 is the squeakier stuff, right?

15:27.020 --> 15:28.780
 So low frequency sound.

15:28.780 --> 15:30.080
 Costello snoring in the background,

15:30.080 --> 15:34.780
 that's a low frequency sound or high frequency sound, okay?

15:34.780 --> 15:37.220
 So we have low frequency sounds and high frequency sounds

15:37.220 --> 15:38.860
 and everything in between.

15:38.860 --> 15:41.860
 Now those sound waves get captured by our ears

15:41.860 --> 15:43.700
 and those sound waves,

15:43.700 --> 15:45.060
 for those of you that don't

15:45.060 --> 15:47.580
 maybe fully conceptualize sound waves

15:47.580 --> 15:51.960
 are literally just fluctuations or shifts

15:51.960 --> 15:55.460
 in the way that air is moving

15:55.460 --> 15:57.300
 toward your ear and through space.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.700
 In the same way that water can have waves,

15:59.700 --> 16:01.820
 the air can have waves, okay?

16:01.820 --> 16:04.060
 So it's reverberation of air.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.260
 Those come in through your ears

16:08.260 --> 16:10.800
 and you have what's called your eardrum.

16:10.800 --> 16:13.260
 And on the inside of your eardrum,

16:13.260 --> 16:14.880
 there's a little bony thing

16:14.880 --> 16:16.440
 that's shaped like a little hammer.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.520
 So attached to that eardrum,

16:18.520 --> 16:20.680
 which can move back and forth like a drum,

16:20.680 --> 16:22.480
 it's like a little membrane,

16:22.480 --> 16:24.400
 you've got this hammer attached to it.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.300
 And that hammer has three parts.

16:26.300 --> 16:27.300
 For those of you that want to know,

16:27.300 --> 16:31.500
 those three parts are called malleus, incus, and stapes.

16:31.500 --> 16:33.500
 But basically you can just think about it as a hammer.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.300
 So you've got this eardrum and then a hammer,

16:36.300 --> 16:39.060
 and then that hammer has to hammer on something.

16:39.060 --> 16:43.460
 And what it does is it hammers on a little coiled piece

16:43.460 --> 16:45.700
 of tissue that we call the cochlea,

16:45.700 --> 16:47.020
 sometimes called the cochlea,

16:47.020 --> 16:50.020
 depending on where somebody lives in the country.

16:50.020 --> 16:51.900
 So typically in the Midwest, on the East Coast,

16:51.900 --> 16:52.980
 they call them cochlea.

16:52.980 --> 16:54.700
 And on the West Coast, we call them cochlea.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.280
 Same thing, okay?

16:57.280 --> 17:00.220
 So the snail-shaped structure in your inner ear

17:01.240 --> 17:05.020
 is where sound gets converted into electrical signals

17:05.020 --> 17:06.860
 that the brain can understand.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.980
 But I want to just bring your attention to that little hammer

17:09.980 --> 17:12.200
 because that little hammer is really, really cool.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.420
 What it means is that sound waves come in through your ears.

17:14.420 --> 17:16.260
 That's what's happening right now.

17:16.260 --> 17:20.100
 That eardrum that you have, it's like the top of a drum.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.980
 It's like a membrane, or it can move back and forth.

17:22.980 --> 17:24.380
 It's not super rigid.

17:24.380 --> 17:25.820
 And it moves that little hammer,

17:25.820 --> 17:28.100
 and then the hammer goes dung, dung, dung, dung, dung,

17:28.100 --> 17:31.060
 and hits this coil-shaped thing

17:31.060 --> 17:34.020
 that we're calling the cochlea, okay?

17:34.020 --> 17:39.020
 Now, the cochlea at one end is more rigid than the other.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.460
 So one part can move really easily,

17:41.460 --> 17:44.300
 and the other part doesn't move very easily.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.580
 And that turns out to be very important

17:46.580 --> 17:51.580
 for decoding or separating sounds that are low frequency,

17:51.900 --> 17:53.700
 like Costello's snoring,

17:53.700 --> 17:56.300
 and sounds that are of high frequency,

17:56.300 --> 17:58.180
 like a shriek or a shrill.

17:59.020 --> 18:03.820
 And that's because within that little coiled thing

18:03.820 --> 18:05.460
 we call the cochlea,

18:05.460 --> 18:07.580
 you have all these tiny little,

18:07.580 --> 18:09.740
 what are called hair cells.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.140
 Now, they look like hairs,

18:11.140 --> 18:13.580
 but they're not at all related to the hairs on your head

18:13.580 --> 18:15.180
 or elsewhere on your body.

18:15.180 --> 18:18.660
 They're just shaped like hairs, so we call them hair cells.

18:18.660 --> 18:22.100
 Those hair cells, if they move,

18:22.100 --> 18:23.980
 send signals into the brain

18:23.980 --> 18:26.740
 that a particular sound is in our environment.

18:26.740 --> 18:28.620
 And if those hair cells don't move,

18:28.620 --> 18:32.320
 it means that particular sound is not in our environment,

18:32.320 --> 18:33.160
 okay?

18:33.160 --> 18:35.600
 So just to give you the mental picture of this,

18:35.600 --> 18:36.860
 sound waves are coming in

18:36.860 --> 18:40.940
 because there's stuff out there making noises like my voice.

18:40.940 --> 18:43.980
 It's changing the patterns of air around you

18:43.980 --> 18:45.940
 in very, very subtle ways.

18:45.940 --> 18:48.940
 That information is getting funneled into your ears

18:48.940 --> 18:51.620
 because your pinna's are shaped in a particular way.

18:51.620 --> 18:54.140
 The eardrum then moves this little hammer

18:54.140 --> 18:57.740
 and the hammer bangs on this little snail-shaped thing.

18:57.740 --> 19:00.980
 And because that snail-shaped thing at one end

19:00.980 --> 19:02.780
 is very rigid, it doesn't want to move.

19:02.780 --> 19:05.140
 And at the other end, it's very flexible.

19:05.140 --> 19:09.660
 It can separate out high-frequency and low-frequency sounds.

19:09.660 --> 19:12.260
 And the fact that this thing in your inner ear

19:12.260 --> 19:14.440
 that we call the cochlea is coiled

19:14.440 --> 19:17.560
 is actually really important to understand

19:17.560 --> 19:19.660
 because along its length,

19:19.660 --> 19:22.260
 it varies in how rigid or flexible it is.

19:22.260 --> 19:24.020
 I already mentioned that before.

19:24.020 --> 19:28.000
 And at the base, it's very rigid.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.420
 And that's where the hair cells, if they move,

19:31.420 --> 19:33.860
 will make high-frequency sounds.

19:33.860 --> 19:35.940
 And at the top, what's called the apex,

19:35.940 --> 19:38.980
 it's very flexible and it's more like a bass drum.

19:38.980 --> 19:42.460
 So basically what happens is sound waves come into your ears

19:42.460 --> 19:46.680
 and then at one end of this thing that we call the cochlea,

19:46.680 --> 19:50.500
 at the top, it's essentially encoding

19:50.500 --> 19:52.900
 or only responding to sounds that are like,

19:52.900 --> 19:55.060
 doom, doom, doom, doom.

19:55.060 --> 19:59.060
 Whereas at the bottom, it responds to high-frequency sounds

19:59.060 --> 20:02.740
 like a cymbal, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss, tss.

20:02.740 --> 20:05.060
 Okay, and everywhere in between,

20:05.060 --> 20:08.640
 we have other frequencies, medium frequencies.

20:08.640 --> 20:11.660
 Now, this should stagger your mind.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.720
 If it doesn't already, it should.

20:13.720 --> 20:16.380
 Because what this means is that

20:16.380 --> 20:18.100
 everything that's happening around us,

20:18.100 --> 20:21.460
 whether or not it's music or voices or crying or screaming

20:21.460 --> 20:24.700
 or screaming of delight from small children

20:24.700 --> 20:26.160
 who are excited because they're playing

20:26.160 --> 20:28.020
 or because they get cake,

20:28.020 --> 20:32.340
 all of that is being broken down into its component parts.

20:32.340 --> 20:34.980
 And then your brain is making sense of what it means.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.940
 These things that I've been talking about,

20:37.940 --> 20:40.700
 like the pinna of your ears and this little hammer

20:40.700 --> 20:43.740
 and the cochlea, that's all purely mechanical.

20:43.740 --> 20:45.440
 It has no mind of its own.

20:45.440 --> 20:48.060
 It's just breaking things down into high frequencies,

20:48.060 --> 20:50.060
 medium frequencies, and low frequencies.

20:50.060 --> 20:51.860
 And if you don't understand sound frequency,

20:51.860 --> 20:54.060
 it's really simple to understand.

20:54.060 --> 20:56.180
 Just imagine ripples on a pond.

20:56.180 --> 20:58.780
 And if those ripples are very close together,

20:58.780 --> 20:59.960
 that's high frequency.

20:59.960 --> 21:01.940
 They occur at high frequency.

21:01.940 --> 21:05.360
 If those ripples are further apart, it's low frequency.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.380
 And obviously, medium frequency is in between.

21:07.380 --> 21:08.820
 So just like you can have waves in water,

21:08.820 --> 21:10.140
 you can have waves in air.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.300
 So that's really how it works.

21:12.300 --> 21:16.700
 Now, we are all familiar with light

21:16.700 --> 21:20.260
 and how if you take a prism and put it in front of light,

21:20.260 --> 21:22.980
 it will split that light into its different wavelengths,

21:22.980 --> 21:26.260
 its different colors, red, green, blue, et cetera, right?

21:26.260 --> 21:29.780
 So like the Pink Floyd, Dark Side of the Moon album,

21:29.780 --> 21:32.820
 I think has a prism and it's converting white light

21:32.820 --> 21:34.900
 into all the colors,

21:34.900 --> 21:37.580
 all the wavelengths that are contained in white light.

21:37.580 --> 21:40.740
 Your cochlea essentially acts as a prism.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.980
 It takes all the sound in your environment

21:42.980 --> 21:46.740
 and it splits up those sounds into different frequencies.

21:46.740 --> 21:48.920
 So you can think of the cochlea of your ear

21:48.920 --> 21:50.340
 sort of like a prism.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.620
 And then the brain takes that information

21:52.620 --> 21:55.100
 and puts it back together and makes sense of it.

21:55.100 --> 21:58.160
 So those hair cells in each of your two cochlea,

21:58.160 --> 22:01.320
 because you have two ears, you also have two cochlea,

22:01.320 --> 22:04.860
 send little wires, what we call axons,

22:04.860 --> 22:09.580
 that convey their patterns of activity into the brain.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.180
 And there are a number of different stations

22:12.180 --> 22:14.780
 within the brain that information arrives at

22:14.780 --> 22:17.100
 before it gets up to the parts of your brain

22:17.100 --> 22:19.100
 where you are consciously aware.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.240
 And because some of you have asked for more names

22:21.240 --> 22:22.620
 in nomenclature, I'll give that to you.

22:22.620 --> 22:25.140
 If you don't want a lot of detailed names,

22:25.140 --> 22:26.740
 you can just ignore what I'm about to say.

22:26.740 --> 22:29.940
 But basically the cochlea send information

22:29.940 --> 22:32.300
 to what's called the spiral ganglion.

22:32.300 --> 22:34.260
 The spiral ganglion, a ganglion, by the way,

22:34.260 --> 22:35.820
 if you're going to learn any neuroscience,

22:35.820 --> 22:37.980
 just know that anytime you hear ganglion,

22:37.980 --> 22:40.100
 a ganglion is just a clump.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.900
 So it means a bunch of neurons.

22:41.900 --> 22:43.580
 So a clump of cells.

22:43.580 --> 22:46.140
 So the spiral ganglion is a bunch of neurons

22:46.140 --> 22:48.540
 that the information then goes off to

22:48.540 --> 22:51.740
 what are called the cochlear nuclei in the brainstem.

22:51.740 --> 22:53.980
 Brainstem is kind of down near your neck.

22:53.980 --> 22:55.860
 Then up to a structure that has a really cool name

22:55.860 --> 22:57.220
 called the superior olive

22:57.220 --> 22:59.780
 because you have one on each side of your brain.

22:59.780 --> 23:01.900
 And if I were to bring you to my lab

23:01.900 --> 23:04.340
 and show you the superior olives in your brain

23:04.340 --> 23:07.180
 or anyone else's brain, they look like little olives.

23:07.180 --> 23:08.400
 They even have a little divot in them

23:08.400 --> 23:10.620
 that to me looks like a pimento,

23:10.620 --> 23:13.300
 but they just call them the superior olive.

23:13.300 --> 23:15.540
 And then the neurons in the superior olive,

23:15.540 --> 23:17.380
 then they send information up to what's called

23:17.380 --> 23:19.620
 the inferior colliculus, only called inferior

23:19.620 --> 23:21.220
 because it sits below a structure

23:21.220 --> 23:22.700
 called the superior colliculus.

23:22.700 --> 23:24.540
 And then the information goes up

23:24.540 --> 23:27.340
 to what's called the medial geniculate nucleus

23:27.340 --> 23:28.880
 and then up to your neocortex

23:28.880 --> 23:31.460
 where you make sense of it all.

23:31.460 --> 23:32.900
 Now you don't have to remember all that,

23:32.900 --> 23:36.620
 but you should know that there are a lot of stations

23:36.620 --> 23:39.100
 in which auditory information is processed

23:39.100 --> 23:42.460
 before it gets up to our conscious detection.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.880
 And there is a good reason for that,

23:45.880 --> 23:50.660
 which is that more important than knowing what you're hearing

23:50.660 --> 23:52.900
 you need to know where it's coming from.

23:54.460 --> 23:57.140
 It's vital to our survival that if something,

23:57.140 --> 23:59.080
 for instance, is falling toward us,

23:59.080 --> 24:01.120
 that we know if it's coming to our right side,

24:01.120 --> 24:03.220
 if it's going to hit us from behind,

24:03.220 --> 24:04.260
 we have to know, for instance,

24:04.260 --> 24:07.620
 if a car is coming at us from our left or from our right,

24:07.620 --> 24:10.460
 and our visual system can help with that,

24:10.460 --> 24:13.020
 but our auditory and our visual system collaborate

24:13.020 --> 24:17.820
 to help us find and locate the position of things in space.

24:17.820 --> 24:19.500
 That should come as no surprise.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.380
 If you hear somebody talking off to your right,

24:22.380 --> 24:24.780
 you tend to turn to your right, not to your left.

24:24.780 --> 24:28.220
 If you see somebody's mouth moving in front of you,

24:28.220 --> 24:29.440
 you tend to assume that the sound

24:29.440 --> 24:32.220
 is going to come from right in front of you.

24:32.220 --> 24:37.220
 Disruptions in this auditory hearing and visual matching

24:37.860 --> 24:39.660
 are actually the basis of what's called

24:39.660 --> 24:41.260
 the ventriloquism effect,

24:41.260 --> 24:44.100
 which we'll talk about in a few minutes in more depth,

24:44.100 --> 24:47.460
 but the ventriloquism effect can basically be described

24:47.460 --> 24:51.720
 in simple terms as when you essentially think

24:51.720 --> 24:54.100
 that a sound is coming from a location

24:54.100 --> 24:56.300
 that it's not actually coming from.

24:57.260 --> 24:58.420
 We'll talk about that in a moment,

24:58.420 --> 25:01.060
 but what I'd like you to realize

25:01.060 --> 25:05.020
 is that one of these stations deep in your brainstem

25:05.020 --> 25:07.340
 is responsible for helping you identify

25:07.340 --> 25:09.480
 where sounds are coming from

25:09.480 --> 25:12.880
 through a process that's called interaural time differences.

25:12.880 --> 25:13.980
 And that sounds fancy,

25:13.980 --> 25:17.980
 but really the way you know where things are coming from,

25:17.980 --> 25:21.280
 what direction a car or a bus or a person is coming from

25:21.280 --> 25:25.060
 is because the sound lands in one ear before the other.

25:25.060 --> 25:27.660
 And you have stations in your brain,

25:27.660 --> 25:29.180
 meaning you have neurons in your brain

25:29.180 --> 25:31.860
 that calculate the difference in time of arrival

25:31.860 --> 25:35.340
 for those sound waves in your right versus your left ear.

25:35.340 --> 25:37.240
 And if they arrive at the same time,

25:37.240 --> 25:40.980
 you assume that thing is making noise right in front of you.

25:40.980 --> 25:42.220
 If it's off to your right,

25:42.220 --> 25:43.740
 you assume it's over on your right.

25:43.740 --> 25:45.980
 And if the sound arrives first to your left ear,

25:45.980 --> 25:47.820
 you assume quite correctly

25:47.820 --> 25:50.940
 that the thing is coming toward your left ear.

25:50.940 --> 25:53.740
 So it's a very simple and kind of mechanical system

25:53.740 --> 25:57.000
 at the level of sound localization.

25:57.900 --> 25:59.260
 But what about up and down?

25:59.260 --> 26:00.240
 If you think about it,

26:00.240 --> 26:02.860
 a sound coming from above is going to land on your right ear

26:02.860 --> 26:04.660
 and your left ear at the same time.

26:04.660 --> 26:07.740
 A sound from below is going to land on your right ear

26:07.740 --> 26:09.520
 and your left ear at the same time.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.700
 So the way that we know where things are

26:12.700 --> 26:15.220
 in terms of what's called elevation,

26:15.220 --> 26:17.700
 where they are in the up and down plane

26:19.020 --> 26:21.300
 is by the frequencies.

26:21.300 --> 26:25.460
 The shape of your ears actually modifies the sound

26:25.460 --> 26:27.780
 depending on whether or not it's coming straight at you

26:27.780 --> 26:30.740
 from the floor or from high above.

26:30.740 --> 26:34.340
 And so already at the level of your ears,

26:34.340 --> 26:37.140
 you are taking information about the outside world

26:37.140 --> 26:40.740
 and determining where that information is coming from.

26:40.740 --> 26:44.100
 Now, this all happens very, very fast and subconscious,

26:44.100 --> 26:46.220
 but now you know why.

26:46.220 --> 26:48.700
 If people really want to hear something,

26:48.700 --> 26:51.620
 they make a cup around their ear.

26:51.620 --> 26:53.280
 They essentially make their ear

26:53.280 --> 26:55.700
 into more of a fennec fox type ear.

26:55.700 --> 26:58.340
 If you've ever seen those cute little fennec fox things,

26:58.340 --> 26:59.800
 they have these big spiky ears.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.440
 They kind of look like a French bulldog,

27:01.440 --> 27:04.460
 although they're kind of the fox version of the French bulldog

27:04.460 --> 27:06.100
 with these big, tall ears,

27:06.100 --> 27:08.260
 and they have excellent sound localization.

27:08.260 --> 27:12.200
 And so when people lean in with their hand like this,

27:12.200 --> 27:13.040
 if you're listening to this,

27:13.040 --> 27:15.220
 I'm just cupping my hand at my ear,

27:15.220 --> 27:17.820
 I'm giving myself a bigger pinna.

27:17.820 --> 27:20.300
 Okay, and if I do it on the left side, I can do this side.

27:20.300 --> 27:21.740
 And if I really want to hear something,

27:21.740 --> 27:23.620
 I do it on both sides, okay?

27:23.620 --> 27:25.300
 So this isn't just gesturing.

27:25.300 --> 27:27.420
 This actually serves a mechanical role.

27:27.420 --> 27:30.360
 And actually, if you want to hear where things are coming from

27:30.360 --> 27:33.700
 with a much greater degree of accuracy,

27:33.700 --> 27:35.260
 this can actually help

27:35.260 --> 27:36.940
 because you're capturing sound waves

27:36.940 --> 27:39.160
 and funneling them better.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.600
 It's really remarkable, this whole system.

27:42.440 --> 27:43.660
 So you've got these two ears,

27:43.660 --> 27:45.820
 and because of the differences in the timing

27:45.820 --> 27:47.580
 of when things arrive in those two ears,

27:47.580 --> 27:50.540
 as well as these differences in the frequencies

27:50.540 --> 27:53.940
 that certain things sound, or I should say,

27:53.940 --> 27:56.060
 the differences in the frequencies

27:56.060 --> 27:57.280
 that arrive at your ears,

27:57.280 --> 27:59.900
 depending on whether or not the thing is above you

27:59.900 --> 28:01.600
 or right in front of you or below you,

28:01.600 --> 28:02.440
 you're able to make out

28:02.440 --> 28:04.340
 where things are in space pretty well.

28:04.340 --> 28:06.120
 So now you're probably starting to realize

28:06.120 --> 28:07.600
 that these two things on the side of our head

28:07.600 --> 28:10.720
 that we call ears are there for a lot more

28:10.720 --> 28:14.860
 than hanging earrings on or for other aesthetic purposes

28:14.860 --> 28:17.620
 or for putting sunglasses on top of.

28:17.620 --> 28:21.260
 They are very powerful devices

28:21.260 --> 28:25.140
 for allowing us to capture sound waves from our environment.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.620
 Now I have a question for you,

28:28.620 --> 28:31.980
 which is, can you move your ears?

28:31.980 --> 28:35.520
 Turns out that unlike other animals,

28:35.520 --> 28:38.900
 humans are not terrifically good at moving their ears.

28:38.900 --> 28:42.240
 Other animals can move their ears even independently.

28:42.240 --> 28:44.880
 So Costello is pretty good at raising his ears,

28:44.880 --> 28:45.760
 the two of them together.

28:45.760 --> 28:48.280
 He can't really move his ears separately.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.500
 Some dogs can do that really well.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.740
 In fact, sighthounds and some scent hounds

28:53.740 --> 28:55.480
 do that exquisitely well.

28:55.480 --> 28:58.440
 Some animals like deer and other animals

28:58.440 --> 29:02.080
 that really have very acute hearing

29:02.080 --> 29:05.960
 will put one ear down to a very particular angle

29:05.960 --> 29:07.180
 and will tilt the other one

29:07.180 --> 29:10.520
 and they will actually capture information

29:10.520 --> 29:15.040
 about two distant sound-making organisms.

29:15.040 --> 29:16.940
 Those could be hunters coming after them

29:16.940 --> 29:18.600
 or other animals coming after them.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.200
 They are very good at doing this.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.440
 We're not so good at it,

29:21.440 --> 29:24.960
 but about 60% of people it's thought

29:24.960 --> 29:27.520
 can move their ears consciously

29:27.520 --> 29:29.240
 without having to touch their ears.

29:29.240 --> 29:30.680
 So can you do that?

29:30.680 --> 29:31.520
 Maybe you should try it.

29:31.520 --> 29:32.920
 Ask someone to look at you

29:32.920 --> 29:34.440
 and see whether or not you can do it.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.680
 The typical distances that people can move it

29:37.680 --> 29:40.300
 is usually no more than two or three millimeters.

29:40.300 --> 29:42.940
 It's subtle, but can you flap your pinna

29:42.940 --> 29:45.720
 with just using mental control?

29:45.720 --> 29:48.460
 If you can, or if you can't,

29:49.360 --> 29:52.180
 try looking all the way to your right

29:52.180 --> 29:53.560
 or all the way to your left.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.920
 Obviously, if you're driving a car

29:54.920 --> 29:56.480
 or doing something or exercising,

29:56.480 --> 29:57.780
 don't put yourself in danger right now,

29:57.780 --> 30:01.380
 but if you move your eyes all the way to your left,

30:01.380 --> 30:04.020
 which I'm doing now, or all the way to my right,

30:04.020 --> 30:06.980
 you might feel a little bit of a contraction of the muscles.

30:06.980 --> 30:11.800
 It's that control ear movement, all right?

30:11.800 --> 30:12.780
 Now I want to ask you this.

30:12.780 --> 30:14.560
 Can you raise one eyebrow?

30:14.560 --> 30:15.640
 I'm not very good at it.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.580
 I can do a little bit,

30:16.580 --> 30:20.040
 but it's mostly by like cramping down my face on one side

30:20.040 --> 30:22.280
 and I certainly can't raise my right eyebrow.

30:22.280 --> 30:24.600
 I can only do my left eyebrow.

30:24.600 --> 30:25.640
 I'm trying to talk while I'm doing this,

30:25.640 --> 30:27.040
 so this is why it looks strange.

30:27.040 --> 30:30.120
 People who can raise one eyebrow very easily

30:31.300 --> 30:33.840
 almost always can move their ears

30:33.840 --> 30:35.480
 without having to touch them.

30:35.480 --> 30:39.520
 It's controlled by the same motor pathway.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.440
 And there does seem to be a small

30:41.440 --> 30:44.200
 but statistically significant sex difference

30:44.200 --> 30:47.180
 in the ability to move one's ears.

30:47.180 --> 30:50.480
 Typically, men can do this more than women can,

30:50.480 --> 30:53.080
 although plenty of women can move their ears as well.

30:53.080 --> 30:57.920
 Now, if you think that is all a little strange or off topic,

30:57.920 --> 31:01.400
 it's not because what we're really talking about here

31:01.400 --> 31:04.240
 is a system of the brain,

31:04.240 --> 31:06.220
 but also of the body of the musculature

31:06.220 --> 31:08.400
 for localizing things in space.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.220
 And so you might find it interesting to note

31:11.220 --> 31:14.640
 that one of the things that we share very closely

31:14.640 --> 31:17.960
 with other primates, with non-human primates,

31:17.960 --> 31:20.480
 like macaque monkeys and chimpanzees,

31:20.480 --> 31:24.960
 if you look at their ears, their ears are remarkably similar

31:24.960 --> 31:26.320
 to our ears, or rather,

31:26.320 --> 31:28.840
 our ears are remarkably similar to their ears.

31:29.900 --> 31:33.640
 The eyes of certain monkeys like macaque monkeys

31:33.640 --> 31:36.920
 are remarkably similar to human eyes.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.120
 This is one of the reasons why

31:38.120 --> 31:40.800
 if you look at a baby macaque monkey,

31:40.800 --> 31:44.300
 it has this unbelievably human element to it.

31:44.300 --> 31:49.040
 But the ears of these primates is very similar to our ears,

31:49.040 --> 31:51.640
 our ears similar to their ears.

31:51.640 --> 31:54.200
 If you're interested in ear movements

31:54.200 --> 31:56.440
 and what they could mean,

31:56.440 --> 31:59.240
 and some of the things that ear movements correlate with

31:59.240 --> 32:01.540
 in other aspects of our biology,

32:01.540 --> 32:04.700
 there's a nice paper, actually, a scientific paper.

32:04.700 --> 32:07.920
 The author's last name is Code, C-O-D-E.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.600
 It was published in 1995.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.020
 I'll give a reference to that.

32:11.020 --> 32:13.480
 It's a review article that discusses

32:13.480 --> 32:16.920
 some of the sex differences in ear movement control,

32:16.920 --> 32:18.920
 as well as the relationship between ear movements

32:18.920 --> 32:20.160
 and eye movements.

32:20.160 --> 32:21.840
 And it's a pretty accessible paper.

32:21.840 --> 32:23.520
 It's one that I think any of you

32:23.520 --> 32:27.020
 who are interested in this topic could parse fairly easily.

32:27.020 --> 32:29.860
 And there's some very interesting underlying biology

32:29.860 --> 32:32.660
 and some theories as to why humans would have

32:32.660 --> 32:36.640
 this so-called vestigial or ancient carryover of a system

32:36.640 --> 32:37.920
 for moving our ears.

32:38.780 --> 32:43.000
 Now, if ear movement seems strange,

32:43.000 --> 32:45.760
 next I want to talk about a different feature

32:45.760 --> 32:47.760
 of your hearing and ears

32:47.760 --> 32:49.920
 that's even stranger,

32:49.920 --> 32:53.200
 but that has some really interesting implications

32:53.200 --> 32:54.620
 for your biology.

32:55.680 --> 32:59.120
 And I'm guessing that you've not heard of this.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.800
 What I'm about to describe are called

33:02.800 --> 33:05.160
 autoacoustic emissions.

33:05.160 --> 33:08.200
 And autoacoustic emissions, as the name suggests,

33:08.200 --> 33:10.880
 are sounds that your ears make.

33:12.220 --> 33:15.680
 Believe it or not, 70% of people

33:15.680 --> 33:18.240
 make noises with their ears,

33:18.240 --> 33:20.380
 but they don't actually detect them.

33:20.380 --> 33:21.820
 Like I said, you've never heard of this.

33:21.820 --> 33:24.580
 Okay, that's not what I mean.

33:24.580 --> 33:28.680
 But what I do mean is that 70% of people's ears

33:28.680 --> 33:32.080
 are making noise that's cast out of the ear.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.560
 And these autoacoustic emissions

33:33.560 --> 33:35.360
 actually can be detected by microphones.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.400
 Sometimes they can be detected by other people in the room

33:38.400 --> 33:40.480
 if they have very good hearing.

33:40.480 --> 33:43.580
 Now, it turns out that women,

33:43.580 --> 33:45.160
 or I should be technical here,

33:45.160 --> 33:48.640
 females who report themselves as heterosexual

33:49.820 --> 33:52.660
 have a higher frequency, not frequency of sound,

33:52.660 --> 33:56.840
 but a higher frequency of autoacoustic emissions

33:56.840 --> 34:00.440
 than do men who report themselves as heterosexual.

34:00.440 --> 34:04.200
 Women who report themselves as homosexual or bisexual

34:05.640 --> 34:09.560
 make fewer autoacoustic emissions than heterosexual women.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.640
 These are data that come from Dennis McFadden's lab

34:13.640 --> 34:15.680
 at the University of Texas, Austin.

34:15.680 --> 34:17.480
 He actually discovered these

34:17.480 --> 34:19.360
 what are called sexual dimorphisms

34:19.360 --> 34:22.480
 and differences based on sexual orientation

34:22.480 --> 34:23.560
 without looking for them.

34:23.560 --> 34:24.960
 He was studying hearing.

34:24.960 --> 34:27.180
 He's a auditory scientist.

34:27.180 --> 34:29.080
 And people were coming into his laboratory

34:29.080 --> 34:31.400
 and they were detecting these autoacoustic emissions

34:31.400 --> 34:35.060
 and they started to notice the group differences

34:35.060 --> 34:36.240
 in autoacoustic emissions.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.280
 So they started asking people about their sex

34:39.280 --> 34:41.320
 and about their sexual orientation.

34:41.320 --> 34:45.560
 And these differences fell out of the data, as we say.

34:45.560 --> 34:48.440
 And it's interesting because autoacoustic emissions

34:48.440 --> 34:50.880
 are not something that we associate with sex

34:50.880 --> 34:52.360
 or sexual dimorphism,

34:52.360 --> 34:55.600
 but what these data really underscore is, first of all,

34:55.600 --> 34:57.760
 a lot of us are making noises with our ears,

34:57.760 --> 34:59.420
 some of us more than others,

34:59.420 --> 35:03.560
 and that exposure to certain combinations

35:03.560 --> 35:05.320
 of hormones during development

35:05.320 --> 35:09.680
 are very likely shaping the way that our hearing apparati,

35:09.680 --> 35:12.560
 meaning the cochlea and the pinna and all sorts of things,

35:12.560 --> 35:14.360
 how those develop and how those function

35:14.360 --> 35:15.620
 throughout the lifespan.

35:15.620 --> 35:19.160
 We did do an episode on hormones and sexual development,

35:19.160 --> 35:21.920
 which gets much deeper into the other effects

35:21.920 --> 35:24.380
 that hormones have on the developing brain and body.

35:24.380 --> 35:26.680
 If you want to check out that episode,

35:26.680 --> 35:29.820
 we will put a link to it in the captions.

35:29.820 --> 35:31.920
 So now I want to shift to talking about

35:31.920 --> 35:36.360
 ways to leverage your hearing system, your auditory system,

35:36.360 --> 35:37.880
 so that you can learn anything,

35:37.880 --> 35:39.360
 not just auditory information,

35:39.360 --> 35:41.900
 but anything faster.

35:41.900 --> 35:45.920
 I get a lot of questions about so-called binaural beats.

35:45.920 --> 35:48.200
 Binaural beats, as their name suggests,

35:48.200 --> 35:52.480
 involve playing one frequency of sound to one ear

35:52.480 --> 35:55.200
 and a different frequency of sound to the other ear.

35:55.200 --> 35:58.280
 So it might be doon, doon, doon, doon

35:58.280 --> 35:59.200
 to your right ear,

35:59.200 --> 36:01.600
 and it might be doon, doon, doon, doon, doon, doon,

36:01.600 --> 36:03.060
 to the left ear.

36:03.060 --> 36:06.240
 And the idea is that the brain will take

36:06.240 --> 36:09.320
 those two frequencies of sound

36:09.320 --> 36:12.260
 and because the pathways that bring information

36:12.260 --> 36:14.880
 from the ears into the brain eventually cross over,

36:14.880 --> 36:16.920
 they actually share that information

36:16.920 --> 36:18.640
 with both sides of the brain,

36:18.640 --> 36:21.520
 that the brain will average that information

36:21.520 --> 36:25.000
 and come up with a sort of intermediate frequency.

36:25.000 --> 36:28.340
 And the rationale is that those intermediate frequencies

36:28.340 --> 36:32.480
 place the brain into a state that is better for learning.

36:32.480 --> 36:34.660
 And when I say better for learning,

36:34.660 --> 36:36.620
 I want to be precise about what I mean.

36:36.620 --> 36:39.400
 That could mean more focus for encoding

36:39.400 --> 36:42.800
 or bringing the information in.

36:42.800 --> 36:44.720
 As you may have heard me say before,

36:44.720 --> 36:47.240
 we have to be alert and focused in order to learn.

36:47.240 --> 36:48.440
 There is no passive learning

36:48.440 --> 36:50.140
 unless we're little tiny infants.

36:51.020 --> 36:54.760
 So can binaural beats make us more focused?

36:54.760 --> 36:58.760
 Can binaural beats allow us to relax more if we're anxious?

36:58.760 --> 37:00.300
 I know some people, they go to the dentist

37:00.300 --> 37:02.360
 and the dentist offers binaural beats

37:02.360 --> 37:04.640
 as they drill into your teeth and give root canals

37:04.640 --> 37:05.600
 and things of that sort,

37:05.600 --> 37:06.820
 probably causing some anxiety

37:06.820 --> 37:09.720
 just describing those things right now.

37:09.720 --> 37:13.840
 But those are available in many dental practices.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.440
 Their binaural beats have been thought

37:16.440 --> 37:18.480
 to increase creativity,

37:18.480 --> 37:20.620
 or at least have been proposed to increase creativity.

37:20.620 --> 37:23.320
 So what are the scientific data say about binaural beats?

37:23.320 --> 37:25.640
 There are a number of different apps out there

37:25.640 --> 37:27.000
 that offer binaural beats.

37:27.000 --> 37:28.480
 There are a number of different programs.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.120
 I think you can also even just find these

37:30.120 --> 37:32.160
 on YouTube and on the internet,

37:32.160 --> 37:34.560
 but typically it's an app and you'll program in

37:34.560 --> 37:36.120
 a particular outcome that you want,

37:36.120 --> 37:38.400
 more focused, more creative, fall asleep,

37:38.400 --> 37:40.500
 less anxious, et cetera.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.400
 So what are the scientific data say?

37:42.400 --> 37:45.040
 So believe it or not, the science on binaural beats

37:45.040 --> 37:48.500
 is actually quite extensive and very precise.

37:48.500 --> 37:51.960
 So sound waves are measured typically

37:51.960 --> 37:53.520
 in hertz or kilohertz.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.780
 I know many of you aren't familiar

37:54.780 --> 37:56.900
 with thinking about things in hertz or kilohertz,

37:56.900 --> 37:59.680
 but again, just remember those waves on a pond,

37:59.680 --> 38:01.780
 those ripples on a pond,

38:01.780 --> 38:06.440
 if they're close together, then they are of high frequency.

38:06.440 --> 38:08.680
 And if they're far apart, then they are low frequency.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.840
 So when you hear more hertz,

38:10.840 --> 38:14.660
 what you're essentially hearing is higher frequency, right?

38:14.660 --> 38:16.320
 And so if it's many more kilohertz,

38:16.320 --> 38:17.520
 then it's much higher frequency

38:17.520 --> 38:19.520
 than if it's fewer hertz or kilohertz.

38:19.520 --> 38:22.120
 And so you may have heard of these things

38:22.120 --> 38:25.160
 as delta waves or theta waves or alpha waves

38:25.160 --> 38:26.680
 or beta waves, et cetera.

38:26.680 --> 38:30.320
 Delta waves would be big, slow waves, so low frequency.

38:30.320 --> 38:33.660
 And indeed, there is quality evidence

38:33.660 --> 38:36.060
 from peer-reviewed studies that are not sponsored

38:36.060 --> 38:38.800
 by companies that make binaural beat apps

38:38.800 --> 38:42.760
 that tell us that delta waves like one to four hertz,

38:42.760 --> 38:46.280
 so very low frequency sounds, think Costello's snoring,

38:46.280 --> 38:51.280
 can help in the transition to sleep and for staying asleep.

38:51.280 --> 38:52.680
 And that theta rhythms,

38:52.680 --> 38:55.040
 which are more like four to eight hertz,

38:55.040 --> 39:00.040
 can bring the brain into a state of subtle sleep

39:00.560 --> 39:04.360
 or meditation, so deeply relaxed, but not fully asleep.

39:04.360 --> 39:07.000
 And then you can sort of ascend the staircase of findings

39:07.000 --> 39:08.980
 here, so to speak, and you'll find evidence

39:08.980 --> 39:10.760
 that alpha waves, eight to 13 hertz,

39:10.760 --> 39:14.300
 can increase alertness to a moderate level.

39:14.300 --> 39:16.360
 That's a great state for the brain to be in

39:16.360 --> 39:20.440
 for recall of existing information, okay?

39:20.440 --> 39:23.420
 And that beta waves, 15 to 20 hertz,

39:23.420 --> 39:27.320
 are great for bringing the brain into focus states

39:27.320 --> 39:31.660
 for sustained thought or for incorporating new information,

39:31.660 --> 39:34.100
 and especially gamma waves, the highest frequency,

39:34.100 --> 39:37.680
 the most frequent ripples of sound, so to speak,

39:37.680 --> 39:41.600
 32 to 100 hertz for learning and problem solving.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.920
 Now, all of this matches, or I should say maps

39:44.920 --> 39:48.540
 onto what I've said before about learning really nicely,

39:48.540 --> 39:50.880
 which is that you need to be in a highly alert state

39:50.880 --> 39:52.840
 in order to bring new information in

39:52.840 --> 39:55.440
 in order to access a state of mind

39:55.440 --> 39:57.600
 in which you can tell your brain,

39:57.600 --> 39:59.880
 or the brain is telling itself, okay, I need to learn this.

39:59.880 --> 40:02.440
 This is why stress and unfortunate circumstances

40:02.440 --> 40:04.440
 are so memorable is because our brain gets

40:04.440 --> 40:06.080
 into a really high alert system.

40:06.080 --> 40:08.380
 Here, we're talking about the use of binaural beats

40:08.380 --> 40:11.200
 in order to increase our level of alertness

40:11.200 --> 40:14.140
 or our level of calmness.

40:14.140 --> 40:16.260
 Now, that's important to underscore

40:16.260 --> 40:17.720
 because it's not that there's something

40:17.720 --> 40:20.780
 fundamentally important about the binaural beats.

40:20.780 --> 40:23.380
 They are yet another way of bringing the brain

40:23.380 --> 40:27.480
 into states of deep relaxation through low-frequency sound

40:27.480 --> 40:31.380
 or highly alert states for focused learning

40:31.380 --> 40:33.440
 with more high-frequency sound.

40:33.440 --> 40:35.780
 So they are effective,

40:35.780 --> 40:39.040
 and I'll review a little bit of the data in detail.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.040
 They're effective,

40:40.040 --> 40:44.920
 but it's not that they're uniquely special for learning.

40:44.920 --> 40:46.920
 It's just that they can help some people

40:46.920 --> 40:48.460
 bring their brain into the state

40:48.460 --> 40:50.820
 that allows them to learn better.

40:50.820 --> 40:55.040
 So there are a lot of studies that allowed us to arrive,

40:55.040 --> 40:57.720
 or I should say allowed the field to arrive

40:57.720 --> 41:02.640
 on these parameters of slow, low-frequency waves

41:02.640 --> 41:03.900
 are going to bring you into relaxed states,

41:03.900 --> 41:06.840
 high-frequency waves into more alert states.

41:08.220 --> 41:11.620
 There's very good evidence for anxiety reduction

41:11.620 --> 41:14.280
 from the use of binaural beats.

41:14.280 --> 41:18.300
 And what's interesting is the anxiety reduction

41:18.300 --> 41:22.980
 seems to be most effective when the binaural beats

41:22.980 --> 41:25.280
 are bringing the brain into delta,

41:25.280 --> 41:30.240
 so those slow, big waves like sleep, theta, and alpha states.

41:30.240 --> 41:32.300
 And I'll link to a couple of these studies,

41:32.300 --> 41:36.020
 although I will probably link more to the list

41:36.020 --> 41:38.020
 that really segregates them out one by one

41:38.020 --> 41:40.120
 so you can see them all next to one another.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.580
 There's good evidence that binaural beats

41:41.580 --> 41:43.860
 can be used to treat pain, chronic pain.

41:43.860 --> 41:47.620
 There's three studies in peer-reviewed journals,

41:47.620 --> 41:51.580
 which I took a look at, and they seem to be of good quality,

41:51.580 --> 41:53.280
 not sponsored research, as we say,

41:53.280 --> 41:55.940
 not paid for by any specific company.

41:55.940 --> 41:57.140
 Binaural beats have been shown

41:57.140 --> 42:00.740
 to modestly improve cognition, attention,

42:00.740 --> 42:03.700
 working memory, and even creativity.

42:03.700 --> 42:06.560
 But the real boost from binaural beats

42:06.560 --> 42:10.980
 appears to be for anxiety reduction and pain reduction.

42:10.980 --> 42:12.680
 Some people might find these beneficial

42:12.680 --> 42:16.100
 for these oral surgeries, right?

42:16.100 --> 42:18.800
 Believe it or not, there are people who would rather

42:18.800 --> 42:22.660
 have the entire root canal or cavity drilled

42:22.660 --> 42:25.420
 without Novocain, and that's because they sometimes

42:25.420 --> 42:28.340
 have a syringe phobia or something of that sort,

42:28.340 --> 42:30.120
 or they just don't like being numb from the Novocain,

42:30.120 --> 42:32.100
 or maybe there's an underlying medical reason.

42:32.100 --> 42:34.340
 But I think most people don't enjoy

42:34.340 --> 42:35.300
 getting their teeth drilled,

42:35.300 --> 42:37.700
 even if they have Novocain in there or a root canal.

42:37.700 --> 42:39.700
 And so it seems that binaural beats

42:39.700 --> 42:41.700
 can be effective in that environment,

42:41.700 --> 42:43.220
 and you don't have to go into that sort of

42:43.220 --> 42:45.240
 extreme environment to benefit from binaural beats.

42:45.240 --> 42:49.020
 Binaural beats are either

42:49.020 --> 42:51.980
 relatively inexpensive thing to access.

42:51.980 --> 42:53.700
 Most of the apps are pretty inexpensive.

42:53.700 --> 42:56.460
 I don't have a favorite binaural beats app

42:56.460 --> 42:57.880
 to recommend to you.

42:57.880 --> 43:00.140
 I confess I did use binaural beats a few years ago.

43:00.140 --> 43:03.500
 I kind of shifted over to other what I call

43:03.500 --> 43:06.500
 NSDR, non-sleep deep-rest protocols, in favor of those.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.580
 But many people like binaural beats

43:08.580 --> 43:10.720
 and say that they benefit from them,

43:10.720 --> 43:13.460
 especially while studying or learning.

43:13.460 --> 43:15.540
 I think part of the reason for that

43:15.540 --> 43:19.340
 relates to the ability to channel our focus

43:19.340 --> 43:21.380
 when we have some background noise.

43:21.380 --> 43:24.140
 And this is something I also get asked about a lot.

43:24.140 --> 43:25.720
 Is it better to listen to music

43:25.720 --> 43:27.820
 and have background noise when studying,

43:27.820 --> 43:29.820
 or is it better to have complete silence?

43:29.820 --> 43:33.140
 Well, there's actually a quite good literature on this

43:33.140 --> 43:36.100
 as well, but not so much as it relates to binaural beats,

43:36.100 --> 43:39.380
 but rather whether or not people are listening to music,

43:39.380 --> 43:42.460
 so-called white noise, brown noise,

43:42.460 --> 43:43.580
 believe it or not, there's white noise

43:43.580 --> 43:46.100
 and there's brown noise, there's even pink noise,

43:46.100 --> 43:49.120
 and how that impacts brain states

43:49.120 --> 43:52.340
 that allow us to learn information better or not.

43:52.340 --> 43:55.100
 So now I'd like to talk about white noise.

43:55.100 --> 43:58.940
 And I want to be very clear that white noise has been shown

43:58.940 --> 44:02.480
 to really enhance brain states for learning

44:02.480 --> 44:06.460
 in certain individuals, in particular in adults.

44:06.460 --> 44:09.460
 But white noise actually can have a detrimental effect

44:09.460 --> 44:12.020
 on auditory learning and maybe even the development

44:12.020 --> 44:14.900
 of the auditory system in very young children,

44:14.900 --> 44:16.940
 in particular in infants.

44:16.940 --> 44:19.880
 So first I'd like to talk about the beneficial effects

44:19.880 --> 44:22.280
 of white noise on learning.

44:22.280 --> 44:25.460
 There are some really excellent studies on this.

44:25.460 --> 44:28.540
 The first one that I'd like to just highlight

44:28.540 --> 44:31.740
 is one that's entitled Low-Intensity White Noise

44:31.740 --> 44:34.420
 Improves Performance in Auditory Working Memory Task,

44:34.420 --> 44:35.980
 an FMRI study.

44:35.980 --> 44:40.980
 This is a study that explored whether or not learning

44:40.980 --> 44:45.080
 could be enhanced by playing white noise in the background.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.860
 But the strength of the study is that they looked

44:48.860 --> 44:50.620
 at some of the underlying neural circuitry

44:50.620 --> 44:52.800
 and the activation of the neural circuitry in these people

44:52.800 --> 44:54.380
 as they did the learning task.

44:54.380 --> 44:58.220
 And what it essentially illustrates is that white noise,

44:58.220 --> 45:01.980
 provided that white noise is of low enough intensity,

45:01.980 --> 45:04.880
 meaning not super loud, right?

45:04.880 --> 45:09.100
 Not imperceptible, so not so quiet that you can't hear it,

45:09.100 --> 45:10.740
 but not super loud either.

45:10.740 --> 45:13.740
 It actually could enhance learning to a significant degree.

45:13.740 --> 45:16.540
 And this has been shown now for a huge number

45:16.540 --> 45:18.280
 of different types of learning.

45:19.860 --> 45:21.940
 There's a terrific article as well

45:21.940 --> 45:24.540
 as in a somewhat obscure journal, at least obscure to me,

45:24.540 --> 45:26.240
 which is the effects of noise exposure

45:26.240 --> 45:29.260
 on cognitive performance and brain activity patterns.

45:30.260 --> 45:32.660
 That's a study involving 54 subjects.

45:33.540 --> 45:36.400
 They basically were evaluated for mental workload

45:36.400 --> 45:39.700
 and attention under different levels of noise exposure,

45:39.700 --> 45:43.020
 background noise, and different essentially loudness

45:43.020 --> 45:43.860
 of noise.

45:43.860 --> 45:45.740
 And the reason I like this study is that they looked

45:45.740 --> 45:47.940
 at different levels of noise and types of noise,

45:47.940 --> 45:50.460
 and they varied a number of different things

45:50.460 --> 45:52.780
 as opposed to just doing a kind of two-condition,

45:52.780 --> 45:55.260
 either white noise or no white noise type thing.

45:55.260 --> 45:57.620
 And what they found, again, is that provided

45:57.620 --> 46:00.680
 the white noise is not extremely loud,

46:00.680 --> 46:02.920
 it could really enhance brain function

46:02.920 --> 46:04.500
 for sake of learning any number

46:04.500 --> 46:06.420
 of different kinds of information.

46:06.420 --> 46:10.420
 Now, that's all great, but it really doesn't get

46:10.420 --> 46:12.900
 to the kind of deeper guts of mechanism.

46:12.900 --> 46:15.100
 And as a neuroscientist, what I really want to see

46:15.100 --> 46:16.880
 is not just that something has an effect.

46:16.880 --> 46:17.720
 That's always nice.

46:17.720 --> 46:20.320
 It's always nice to see in a nice peer-reviewed study

46:20.320 --> 46:22.340
 without any kind of commercial biases

46:22.340 --> 46:23.220
 that there's an effect.

46:23.220 --> 46:25.260
 Okay, binaural beats can enhance learning,

46:25.260 --> 46:27.480
 or listening to white noise not too loud

46:27.480 --> 46:28.940
 can enhance learning.

46:28.940 --> 46:31.580
 But you really want to understand mechanism

46:31.580 --> 46:34.760
 because once you understand mechanism,

46:34.760 --> 46:36.300
 not only does it start to make sense,

46:36.300 --> 46:37.660
 but you can also imagine ways

46:37.660 --> 46:40.660
 in which you could develop better tools and protocols.

46:40.660 --> 46:43.500
 So I was very relieved to find,

46:43.500 --> 46:45.820
 or I should say excited to find this study

46:45.820 --> 46:48.460
 published in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.

46:48.460 --> 46:50.620
 This is a 2014 paper.

46:51.700 --> 46:54.700
 White noise improves learning by modulating activity

46:54.700 --> 46:57.380
 in dopaminergic midbrain regions

46:57.380 --> 46:59.620
 and the right superior temporal sulcus, okay?

46:59.620 --> 47:00.500
 Now, I don't expect you to know

47:00.500 --> 47:02.460
 what the right superior temporal sulcus is.

47:02.460 --> 47:03.500
 I don't expect you to know

47:03.500 --> 47:05.260
 what the dopamine midbrain region is,

47:05.260 --> 47:07.260
 but if you're like me,

47:07.260 --> 47:09.740
 you probably took highlighted notice

47:09.740 --> 47:11.220
 of the word dopaminergic.

47:11.220 --> 47:13.660
 Dopamine is a neuromodulator,

47:13.660 --> 47:15.840
 meaning it's a chemical that's released in our brain

47:15.840 --> 47:18.020
 and body, but mostly in our brain,

47:18.020 --> 47:23.020
 that modulates, meaning controls the likelihood

47:23.100 --> 47:24.780
 that certain brain areas will be active

47:24.780 --> 47:26.480
 and other brain areas won't be active.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.740
 And dopamine is associated with motivation.

47:28.740 --> 47:30.500
 Dopamine is associated with craving.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.800
 Motivation is associated with all sorts of different things,

47:32.800 --> 47:34.220
 including movement.

47:34.220 --> 47:37.220
 But what this study so nicely shows

47:38.100 --> 47:42.220
 is that white noise can really enhance

47:42.220 --> 47:43.460
 the activity of neurons

47:43.460 --> 47:45.720
 in what's called the substantia nigra VTA.

47:45.720 --> 47:50.220
 The substantia nigra VTA is a very rich source of dopamine,

47:50.220 --> 47:53.400
 and that's because it's very chock-a-block

47:53.400 --> 47:55.500
 full of dopamine neurons.

47:55.500 --> 47:57.000
 It's an area of the brain

47:57.000 --> 48:01.260
 that is perhaps the richest source of dopamine neurons.

48:01.260 --> 48:03.740
 And you actually can see this brain region

48:03.740 --> 48:04.720
 under the microscope.

48:04.720 --> 48:07.100
 If you take a slice of brain or you look at a brain

48:07.100 --> 48:09.060
 without even staining it for any proteins

48:09.060 --> 48:10.460
 or dopamine or anything,

48:10.460 --> 48:12.780
 it's two very dark regions

48:12.780 --> 48:14.700
 at the kind of bottom of the brain.

48:14.700 --> 48:17.500
 And the reason it's called substantia nigra,

48:17.500 --> 48:19.500
 nigra meaning dark,

48:19.500 --> 48:23.180
 is because the dopamine neurons actually make something

48:23.180 --> 48:25.740
 and that makes those neurons dark.

48:25.740 --> 48:28.260
 And so you've got these two regions down there

48:28.260 --> 48:30.560
 that contain dopamine and can release dopamine

48:30.560 --> 48:32.960
 and essentially activate other brain regions

48:32.960 --> 48:34.680
 and activate our sense of motivation

48:34.680 --> 48:36.700
 and activate our sense of desire

48:36.700 --> 48:39.020
 to continue focusing and learning.

48:39.020 --> 48:41.460
 But you can't just snap your fingers

48:41.460 --> 48:42.500
 and make them release dopamine.

48:42.500 --> 48:44.940
 You actually have to trigger dopamine release from them.

48:44.940 --> 48:46.520
 Now, that trigger can be caused

48:46.520 --> 48:49.080
 by being very excited about something

48:49.080 --> 48:50.780
 or the fact that that thing gave you

48:50.780 --> 48:52.160
 a lot of pleasure in the past

48:52.160 --> 48:55.160
 or you're highly motivated by fear or desire.

48:55.160 --> 48:58.600
 But what's so interesting to me is that it appears

48:58.600 --> 49:02.020
 that white noise itself can raise

49:02.020 --> 49:03.380
 the what we call the basal,

49:03.380 --> 49:05.280
 the baseline levels of dopamine

49:05.280 --> 49:07.440
 that are being released from this area,

49:07.440 --> 49:09.260
 the substantia nigra.

49:09.260 --> 49:12.980
 So now we're starting to get a more full picture

49:12.980 --> 49:15.660
 of how particular sounds in our environment

49:15.660 --> 49:18.260
 can increase learning.

49:18.260 --> 49:20.420
 And that's in part, I believe,

49:20.420 --> 49:24.700
 through the release of dopamine from substantia nigra.

49:24.700 --> 49:28.220
 So I'm not trying to shift you away from binaural beats

49:28.220 --> 49:29.280
 if that's your thing,

49:29.280 --> 49:32.220
 but it does appear that turning on white noise

49:32.220 --> 49:33.860
 at a low level, not too loud,

49:33.860 --> 49:35.100
 you may say, well, how loud?

49:35.100 --> 49:36.140
 And I'll tell you in a moment,

49:36.140 --> 49:39.360
 but not too loud can allow you to learn better

49:39.360 --> 49:41.280
 because of the ways that it's modulating

49:41.280 --> 49:42.640
 your brain chemistry.

49:42.640 --> 49:47.040
 So how loud or how soft should that white noise be

49:47.040 --> 49:48.020
 while you learn?

49:48.900 --> 49:52.460
 Well, in these studies, it seemed that white noise

49:52.460 --> 49:54.300
 that could be heard by the person,

49:54.300 --> 49:55.820
 so it wasn't imperceptible to them,

49:55.820 --> 49:58.740
 so it was loud enough that they could hear,

49:58.740 --> 50:03.740
 but not so loud that they felt it was intrusive

50:03.860 --> 50:05.780
 or irritating to them.

50:05.780 --> 50:07.640
 So that's going to differ from person to person

50:07.640 --> 50:10.860
 because people have different levels of auditory sensitivity.

50:10.860 --> 50:11.820
 It's going to depend on age,

50:11.820 --> 50:13.800
 going to depend on a number of different factors.

50:13.800 --> 50:16.600
 So I can't tell you turn to level two

50:16.600 --> 50:17.900
 on your volume controller.

50:17.900 --> 50:18.740
 That's just not going to work.

50:18.740 --> 50:20.080
 Also, I don't know how far you are

50:20.080 --> 50:21.580
 from a given speaker in the room,

50:21.580 --> 50:23.440
 or if you've got earphones in your head,

50:23.440 --> 50:26.060
 or you've got speakers in the room,

50:26.060 --> 50:27.760
 or if it's coming out of your computer.

50:27.760 --> 50:28.960
 I don't know those things.

50:28.960 --> 50:31.420
 So what you're going to have to do is adjust that white noise

50:31.420 --> 50:33.860
 to a place where it's not interfering

50:33.860 --> 50:35.080
 with your ability to focus,

50:35.080 --> 50:37.820
 but rather it's enhancing your ability to focus.

50:37.820 --> 50:41.200
 I think a good rule of thumb is going to be

50:41.200 --> 50:43.860
 to put it probably on the lower third

50:43.860 --> 50:46.080
 of any kind of volume dial,

50:46.080 --> 50:49.160
 as opposed to in the upper third

50:49.160 --> 50:51.500
 where it would really be blasting.

50:51.500 --> 50:55.840
 And really blasting any noise, frankly, is not good,

50:55.840 --> 50:58.200
 but that's especially not good,

50:58.200 --> 51:01.440
 meaning it's especially bad, if you have headphones in.

51:01.440 --> 51:03.460
 I do want to mention something about headphones

51:03.460 --> 51:07.000
 before I talk about white noise in the developmental context

51:07.000 --> 51:08.700
 and why it can be dangerous there.

51:09.580 --> 51:12.460
 When you put headphones in your ears,

51:13.760 --> 51:17.720
 it has this incredible effect of making the sounds

51:17.720 --> 51:19.680
 like they come from inside your head,

51:19.680 --> 51:21.640
 not from out in the room.

51:21.640 --> 51:23.720
 And now that might seem like kind of a duh,

51:23.720 --> 51:25.880
 but that's actually really amazing, right?

51:25.880 --> 51:28.080
 Your brain assumes that the sounds are coming

51:28.080 --> 51:30.120
 from inside your head,

51:30.120 --> 51:32.020
 as opposed from the environment that you're in

51:32.020 --> 51:33.600
 the moment you put headphones in.

51:33.600 --> 51:34.940
 So if you're listening to an audio book,

51:34.940 --> 51:37.240
 or maybe you're listening to this podcast with headphones,

51:37.240 --> 51:39.100
 that's very different than when you're listening

51:39.100 --> 51:41.640
 to something out in the room and there are other sounds,

51:41.640 --> 51:42.600
 other sound waves,

51:42.600 --> 51:45.200
 especially if you use these noise cancellation headphones.

51:45.200 --> 51:48.120
 So if you're going to use white noise

51:48.120 --> 51:50.560
 to enhance studying or learning of any kind,

51:50.560 --> 51:52.000
 or this also could be for skill learning,

51:52.000 --> 51:54.640
 motor skill learning while you're exercising,

51:54.640 --> 51:58.200
 my suggestion would be that if you're using headphones

51:58.200 --> 52:00.280
 to keep it quite low, right?

52:00.280 --> 52:03.380
 This is an effect on the midbrain dopamine neurons.

52:03.380 --> 52:05.840
 That's a background effect of raising the baseline

52:05.840 --> 52:06.680
 of dopamine release.

52:06.680 --> 52:08.880
 The way that dopamine neurons fires, they're always firing.

52:08.880 --> 52:10.680
 Yours are firing right now, so are mine.

52:10.680 --> 52:12.960
 When something exciting happens, they fire a lot.

52:12.960 --> 52:14.360
 And when something disappointing happens,

52:14.360 --> 52:16.280
 that firing, the release of dopamine

52:16.280 --> 52:17.960
 goes down below baseline.

52:17.960 --> 52:19.560
 What you're talking about here is raising

52:19.560 --> 52:21.620
 your overall levels of attention and motivation,

52:21.620 --> 52:23.440
 which translate to better learning,

52:23.440 --> 52:26.280
 by just tickling those neurons a little bit,

52:26.280 --> 52:28.100
 raising the baseline firing, okay?

52:28.100 --> 52:30.280
 So you're not turning up the white noise

52:30.280 --> 52:32.040
 to the point where you're feeling amazing.

52:32.040 --> 52:34.080
 This isn't like turning on your favorite song.

52:34.080 --> 52:35.800
 This is actually the opposite.

52:35.800 --> 52:39.820
 This is about getting that baseline up just a bit, okay?

52:39.820 --> 52:43.420
 So I recommend turning the volume up just a bit

52:43.420 --> 52:46.720
 so that you can focus entirely on the tasks

52:46.720 --> 52:47.560
 that you're trying to do.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.240
 And of course, you've turned on white noise,

52:49.240 --> 52:50.860
 so your attention might drift to that for a moment.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.840
 Is it too loud? Is it too soft?

52:52.840 --> 52:55.280
 If you can disappear into the work, so to speak,

52:55.280 --> 52:57.140
 if your attention can disappear into the work,

52:57.140 --> 53:00.280
 then that's probably sufficiently quiet.

53:00.280 --> 53:01.200
 And for those of you that say,

53:01.200 --> 53:02.560
 well, I like really loud music,

53:02.560 --> 53:04.400
 and if I just blast the music,

53:04.400 --> 53:05.940
 then I forget about the music.

53:06.820 --> 53:08.520
 I don't suggest blasting music.

53:08.520 --> 53:09.520
 And this is coming from somebody

53:09.520 --> 53:12.200
 who really likes loud music.

53:12.200 --> 53:14.640
 I grew up with kind of a loud, fast rules mentality.

53:14.640 --> 53:17.400
 And if you don't know what loud, fast rules means,

53:17.400 --> 53:18.740
 then I can't help you.

53:18.740 --> 53:22.460
 But there's a time and a place, perhaps,

53:22.460 --> 53:23.620
 to listen to music loud.

53:23.620 --> 53:25.500
 But especially with headphones,

53:25.500 --> 53:30.000
 you can trigger, excuse me, hearing loss quite rapidly.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.180
 And unfortunately, because these hair cells

53:33.180 --> 53:34.120
 that we talked about earlier,

53:34.120 --> 53:35.640
 our central nervous system neurons,

53:35.640 --> 53:37.120
 they do not regenerate.

53:37.120 --> 53:39.000
 They do not come back.

53:39.000 --> 53:41.940
 Now, along the lines of hearing loss,

53:43.000 --> 53:45.200
 I should just say that the best way

53:45.200 --> 53:49.000
 to blow out your hearing for good, to eliminate your hearing,

53:49.000 --> 53:51.880
 is to have very loud sounds

53:51.880 --> 53:54.840
 superimposed on a loud environment, okay?

53:54.840 --> 53:57.400
 So loud environments can cause hearing loss over time.

53:57.400 --> 54:00.300
 So if you work at a construction site clanging really loud,

54:00.300 --> 54:03.700
 or if you work the soundboard in a club or something,

54:03.700 --> 54:05.720
 you are headed towards hearing loss

54:05.720 --> 54:07.600
 unless you protect your hearing

54:07.600 --> 54:10.000
 with earplugs and headphones.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.800
 Nowadays, some of the earplugs are very low profile,

54:12.800 --> 54:13.840
 meaning you can't see them.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.960
 So that's kind of nice so you're not like the,

54:15.960 --> 54:16.980
 like when I was younger,

54:16.980 --> 54:17.940
 you didn't want to be the dork

54:17.940 --> 54:19.360
 to go to the concert with the earplugs,

54:19.360 --> 54:21.800
 but turns out those dorks were smarter than everybody else

54:21.800 --> 54:24.720
 because they're not the ones who are craning their neck

54:24.720 --> 54:26.420
 to try and hear trivial things

54:27.940 --> 54:30.600
 at the age of 30 or so

54:30.600 --> 54:32.440
 because they blew out their hearing.

54:32.440 --> 54:35.340
 So if you are working in a loud environment

54:35.340 --> 54:38.660
 or you expose yourselves to a loud environment,

54:38.660 --> 54:41.960
 you really want to avoid big inflections

54:41.960 --> 54:43.360
 and sound above that.

54:43.360 --> 54:47.200
 So loud environment plus fireworks,

54:47.200 --> 54:49.140
 loud environment plus gunshot,

54:49.140 --> 54:53.560
 loud environments plus very high frequency, intense sound.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.560
 That's what we call the two-hip model.

54:55.560 --> 54:57.800
 When you, this is also true for concussion

54:57.800 --> 54:59.840
 that you can take a kind of a stimulus

54:59.840 --> 55:02.040
 that normally would be below the threshold of injury.

55:02.040 --> 55:05.140
 You add another stimulus at the same time

55:05.140 --> 55:06.820
 that would be below the threshold of injury

55:06.820 --> 55:08.800
 and then suddenly you killed the neurons.

55:08.800 --> 55:10.560
 So I don't want to make people paranoid,

55:10.560 --> 55:11.860
 but you do want to protect your hearing.

55:11.860 --> 55:13.600
 It's no fun to lose your hearing.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.160
 If you're going to use headphones

55:15.160 --> 55:17.040
 and you feel like you want to crank it up all the way,

55:17.040 --> 55:20.740
 just remember that the more that you can get

55:20.740 --> 55:22.060
 out of a lower volume,

55:22.060 --> 55:24.720
 meaning the longer that you can go listening to things

55:24.720 --> 55:25.640
 at lower volume,

55:25.640 --> 55:30.120
 the longer you'll be able to hear that music or that thing.

55:30.120 --> 55:33.840
 So again, I'm not the hearing cop.

55:33.840 --> 55:35.180
 That's not my job,

55:35.180 --> 55:38.120
 but as somebody who's lost some of his high-frequency

55:38.120 --> 55:42.200
 hearing, I can tell you it's not a pleasure.

55:42.200 --> 55:45.480
 The old argument that it helps you not have to hear

55:45.480 --> 55:47.280
 or listen to people that you don't want to listen to

55:47.280 --> 55:48.340
 that doesn't really work.

55:48.340 --> 55:50.360
 They just send you text messages instead.

55:50.360 --> 55:53.960
 So what about white noise and hearing loss in development?

55:53.960 --> 55:55.340
 You know, a lot of people with children

55:55.340 --> 55:57.560
 have these kind of noise machines,

55:57.560 --> 55:59.240
 like sound waves and things like that

55:59.240 --> 56:00.960
 that help the kids sleep.

56:00.960 --> 56:03.620
 And look, I think kids getting good sleep

56:03.620 --> 56:06.520
 and parents getting good sleep is vital to physical

56:06.520 --> 56:08.960
 and mental health and family health.

56:08.960 --> 56:13.880
 So I certainly sympathize with those needs.

56:13.880 --> 56:18.360
 However, there are data that indicate that white noise

56:18.360 --> 56:21.000
 during development can be detrimental

56:21.000 --> 56:22.400
 to the auditory system.

56:22.400 --> 56:23.720
 I don't want to frighten any parents.

56:23.720 --> 56:25.480
 If you played white noise to your kids,

56:25.480 --> 56:27.060
 this doesn't mean that their auditory system

56:27.060 --> 56:29.760
 or their speech patterns are going to be disrupted

56:29.760 --> 56:31.120
 or that their interpretation of speech

56:31.120 --> 56:32.880
 is going to be disrupted forever.

56:32.880 --> 56:37.120
 But there are data published in the journal Science,

56:37.120 --> 56:39.600
 and Science being one of the three apex journals,

56:39.600 --> 56:42.360
 Science, Nature, Cell, the most stringent journals,

56:43.360 --> 56:46.180
 data published in the journal Science some years ago,

56:46.180 --> 56:48.280
 actually by a scientist who I know quite well.

56:48.280 --> 56:49.280
 His name is Edward Chang.

56:49.280 --> 56:50.800
 He's a medical doctor now.

56:50.800 --> 56:51.920
 He's a neurosurgeon.

56:51.920 --> 56:55.080
 He's actually the chair of neurosurgery at UCSF.

56:55.080 --> 56:58.840
 And he runs a laboratory where they study auditory learning,

56:58.840 --> 57:00.440
 neuroplasticity, et cetera.

57:00.440 --> 57:04.740
 He and his mentor at the time, Mike Merzenich,

57:04.740 --> 57:08.600
 published a paper showing that if young animals,

57:08.600 --> 57:10.460
 and this wasn't animal models,

57:10.460 --> 57:14.980
 were exposed to white noise, so shh,

57:14.980 --> 57:18.960
 the very type of noise that I'm saying as a older person,

57:18.960 --> 57:19.800
 and when I say older,

57:19.800 --> 57:21.920
 I mean somebody who's in their late teens,

57:21.920 --> 57:23.520
 early 20s and older,

57:23.520 --> 57:25.880
 could benefit from listening to that at a low level

57:25.880 --> 57:28.500
 in the background for sake of learning.

57:28.500 --> 57:32.040
 Well, they exposed very young animals to this white noise.

57:32.040 --> 57:34.660
 It actually disrupted the maps

57:34.660 --> 57:37.680
 of the auditory world within the brain.

57:37.680 --> 57:39.240
 And we haven't talked about these maps yet,

57:39.240 --> 57:40.640
 but I want to take a moment and talk about them

57:40.640 --> 57:44.000
 and explain this effect and what it might mean for you

57:44.000 --> 57:45.560
 if you have kids or if you were exposed

57:45.560 --> 57:47.640
 to a lot of white noise early on.

57:47.640 --> 57:52.280
 So auditory information goes up into our cortex,

57:52.280 --> 57:55.760
 into essentially the outside portion of our brain

57:55.760 --> 57:59.520
 that's responsible for all of our higher level cognition,

57:59.520 --> 58:03.220
 our planning, our decision-making, et cetera, creativity.

58:03.220 --> 58:06.920
 And up there, we have what are called tonotopic maps.

58:06.920 --> 58:08.400
 What's a tonotopic map?

58:08.400 --> 58:10.720
 Well, remember the cochlea, how it's coiled,

58:10.720 --> 58:12.680
 and at one end, it responds to high frequencies,

58:12.680 --> 58:15.520
 and the other end, it responds to low frequencies?

58:15.520 --> 58:16.720
 Sort of like a piano.

58:16.720 --> 58:19.280
 The keys sound different as you extend down

58:19.280 --> 58:20.960
 and up the piano keys,

58:20.960 --> 58:23.680
 and it's organized in a very systematic way, right?

58:23.680 --> 58:26.720
 It's not all intermixed high frequencies and low frequencies.

58:26.720 --> 58:29.040
 It's organized in a very systematic way

58:29.040 --> 58:30.700
 from one end to the other.

58:30.700 --> 58:33.640
 Your visual system is in what's called a retinotopic map.

58:33.640 --> 58:36.840
 So neighboring points in space off to my right,

58:36.840 --> 58:38.880
 like my two fingers off to my right,

58:38.880 --> 58:43.000
 are mapped to neighboring points in space in my brain.

58:43.000 --> 58:45.400
 And the space right in front of me

58:45.400 --> 58:47.160
 is mapped to a different location in my brain,

58:47.160 --> 58:48.240
 but it's systematic.

58:48.240 --> 58:49.080
 It's regular.

58:49.080 --> 58:49.900
 It's not random.

58:49.900 --> 58:51.040
 It's not salt and pepper.

58:51.040 --> 58:54.960
 It goes from high to low, or from right to center to left.

58:54.960 --> 58:56.080
 In the auditory system,

58:56.080 --> 58:58.460
 we have what are called tonotopic maps,

58:58.460 --> 59:02.320
 where frequency, high frequency to low frequency,

59:02.320 --> 59:04.240
 and everything in between is organized

59:04.240 --> 59:06.340
 in a very systematic way.

59:06.340 --> 59:09.520
 Now, our experience of life from the time we're a baby

59:09.520 --> 59:12.640
 until the time that we die is not systematic.

59:12.640 --> 59:15.160
 We don't hear low frequencies at one part of the room

59:15.160 --> 59:16.040
 or at one part of the day,

59:16.040 --> 59:17.660
 and high frequencies at another part of the room

59:17.660 --> 59:18.840
 and another part of the day.

59:18.840 --> 59:20.400
 They're all intermixed.

59:20.400 --> 59:23.480
 But if you remember, the cochlea separates them out

59:23.480 --> 59:25.560
 just like a prism of light separates out

59:25.560 --> 59:26.740
 the different wavelengths of light.

59:26.740 --> 59:29.980
 The cochlea separates out the different frequencies.

59:29.980 --> 59:32.300
 And the developing brain

59:32.300 --> 59:34.680
 takes those separated out frequencies

59:34.680 --> 59:39.280
 and learns this relationship between itself,

59:39.280 --> 59:41.860
 meaning the child, and the outside world.

59:43.440 --> 59:48.440
 White noise essentially contains no tonotopic information.

59:48.440 --> 59:51.280
 The frequencies are all intermixed.

59:51.280 --> 59:52.840
 It's just noise.

59:52.840 --> 59:55.400
 Whereas when I speak, my voice has,

59:55.400 --> 59:56.240
 now I'm getting technical,

59:56.240 --> 59:58.480
 but it has what's called a certain envelope,

59:58.480 --> 1:00:00.080
 meaning it has some low frequencies

1:00:00.080 --> 1:00:01.440
 and some slightly high frequencies.

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:02.760
 I can make my voice higher,

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:04.040
 although I'm not very good at that.

1:00:04.040 --> 1:00:07.200
 My voice starts to crack and I can make my voice lower,

1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:08.860
 although not as low as Costello's snore.

1:00:08.860 --> 1:00:11.400
 So it has an envelope, it has a container.

1:00:12.280 --> 1:00:14.000
 White noise has no container.

1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:17.400
 It's like all the colors of the rainbow spread out together,

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:19.860
 which is actually what you get when you get white light.

1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:23.400
 White noise is analogous to white light.

1:00:23.400 --> 1:00:28.400
 So one of the reasons why hearing a lot of white noise

1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:31.600
 during development for long periods of time

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:34.360
 can be detrimental to the development of the auditory system

1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:37.120
 is that these tonotopic maps don't form normally.

1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:39.040
 At least they don't in experimental animals.

1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:43.400
 Now, the reason I'm raising this is that many people I know,

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:45.800
 in particular friends who have small children,

1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:50.800
 they say, I want to use a white noise machine while I sleep,

1:00:51.980 --> 1:00:56.160
 but is it okay for my baby to use a white noise machine?

1:00:56.160 --> 1:00:59.740
 And I consulted with various people, scientists about this,

1:00:59.740 --> 1:01:02.080
 and they said, well, you know,

1:01:02.080 --> 1:01:04.360
 the baby is also hearing the parents' voices

1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:06.520
 and is hearing music and is hearing the dog bark,

1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:08.320
 so it's not the only thing they're hearing.

1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:12.780
 However, every single person that I consulted with said,

1:01:12.780 --> 1:01:15.800
 but you know, there's neuroplasticity during sleep,

1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:17.640
 that's when the kid is sleeping,

1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:20.460
 and I don't know that you'd want to expose a child

1:01:20.460 --> 1:01:22.560
 to white noise the entire night,

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:26.320
 because it might degrade that tonotopic map.

1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:28.880
 It might not destroy it, it might not eliminate it,

1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:32.000
 but it could make it a little less clear,

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.960
 like sort of taking the keys on the piano

1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:37.360
 and taping a few of them together, right?

1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:38.720
 So you've still got the highs and lows

1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:41.080
 in the appropriate order and everything in between,

1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:42.720
 but when you tape the keys together,

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:44.320
 you don't get the same fidelity,

1:01:44.320 --> 1:01:46.360
 you don't get the same precision

1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:49.760
 of the noise that comes out of that piano.

1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:52.920
 So again, I don't want to scare anybody,

1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:54.600
 but I would say if you are in a position

1:01:54.600 --> 1:01:57.600
 to make the choice of either using white noise

1:01:57.600 --> 1:01:58.600
 or something similar,

1:01:58.600 --> 1:02:00.280
 pink noise is just a kind of variation,

1:02:00.280 --> 1:02:02.280
 it's got a little bit more of a certain frequency,

1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:04.200
 just like pink light has a little bit more

1:02:04.200 --> 1:02:07.180
 of a certain wavelength than white light, kind of,

1:02:07.180 --> 1:02:11.020
 if you are in a position to make choices

1:02:11.020 --> 1:02:13.860
 about things to put in a young,

1:02:13.860 --> 1:02:16.400
 especially very young child's sleeping environment,

1:02:16.400 --> 1:02:19.680
 white noise might be something to consider avoiding.

1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:21.200
 Again, I'm not telling you what to do,

1:02:21.200 --> 1:02:23.740
 but it's something to perhaps consider avoiding.

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.400
 I don't think most pediatricians

1:02:25.400 --> 1:02:27.300
 are going to be aware of these data,

1:02:27.300 --> 1:02:30.200
 but if you talk to any auditory physiologist

1:02:30.200 --> 1:02:31.960
 or an audiologist or somebody

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:34.280
 who studies auditory development,

1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:37.200
 I'm fairly certain that they would have opinions about that.

1:02:37.200 --> 1:02:39.440
 Now, whether or not their opinions agree with mine

1:02:39.440 --> 1:02:40.840
 and these folks that I consulted with

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:42.640
 or not is a separate matter,

1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:44.960
 I don't know because I don't know them,

1:02:44.960 --> 1:02:47.280
 but it's something that I felt was important enough

1:02:47.280 --> 1:02:51.440
 to cue you to, especially since I've highlighted,

1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:54.080
 excuse me, the opposite effect is true in adulthood.

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:56.460
 Once your auditory system has formed,

1:02:56.460 --> 1:02:58.640
 once it's established these tonotopic maps,

1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:01.160
 then the presence of background white noise

1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:02.720
 should not be a problem at all.

1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:05.240
 In fact, it shouldn't be a problem at all

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:07.300
 because you're also not attending to it.

1:03:07.300 --> 1:03:09.460
 The idea is that it's playing at a low enough volume

1:03:09.460 --> 1:03:11.080
 that you kind of forget it in the background

1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:12.640
 and that it's supporting learning

1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:15.200
 by bringing your brain into a heightened state of alertness

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:17.640
 and especially this heightened state of dopamine,

1:03:17.640 --> 1:03:19.800
 dopaminergic activation of the brain,

1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:22.360
 which will make it easier to learn faster

1:03:22.360 --> 1:03:24.680
 and easier to learn the information.

1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:27.340
 So now I want to talk about auditory learning

1:03:27.340 --> 1:03:29.000
 and actually how you can get better

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:30.960
 at learning information that you hear,

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:33.860
 not just information that you see on a page

1:03:33.860 --> 1:03:35.920
 or motor skill learning.

1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:37.560
 There are a lot of reasons to want to do this.

1:03:37.560 --> 1:03:39.000
 A lot of classroom teaching,

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.520
 whether or not it's by Zoom or in person,

1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:42.960
 is auditory in nature.

1:03:42.960 --> 1:03:47.080
 Not everything is necessarily written down for us.

1:03:47.080 --> 1:03:52.080
 It's also good to get better at listening, or so I'm told.

1:03:52.220 --> 1:03:55.960
 So there's a phenomenon called the cocktail party effect.

1:03:55.960 --> 1:03:58.040
 Now, even if you've never been to a cocktail party,

1:03:58.040 --> 1:04:00.780
 you've experienced and participated

1:04:00.780 --> 1:04:02.900
 in what's called the cocktail party effect.

1:04:02.900 --> 1:04:05.760
 The cocktail party effect is where you are in an environment

1:04:05.760 --> 1:04:07.100
 that's rich with sound,

1:04:07.100 --> 1:04:09.760
 many sound waves coming from many different sources,

1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:10.600
 many different things.

1:04:10.600 --> 1:04:13.220
 So in a city, in a classroom,

1:04:13.220 --> 1:04:16.500
 in a car that contains people having various conversations,

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:20.560
 you somehow need to be able to attend

1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:22.880
 to specific components of those sound waves,

1:04:22.880 --> 1:04:25.640
 meaning you need to hear certain people and not others.

1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:27.920
 The reason it's called the cocktail party effect

1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:30.840
 is that you, and meaning your brain,

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:36.140
 are exquisitely good at creating a cone

1:04:36.140 --> 1:04:39.640
 of auditory attention, a narrow band of attention

1:04:39.640 --> 1:04:42.760
 with which you can extract the information you care about

1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:46.100
 and wipe away or erase all the rest.

1:04:47.180 --> 1:04:48.600
 Now, this takes work.

1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:50.360
 It takes attention.

1:04:50.360 --> 1:04:52.380
 One of the reasons why you might come home

1:04:52.380 --> 1:04:55.960
 from a loud gathering, maybe a stadium, a sports event,

1:04:55.960 --> 1:04:57.720
 or a cocktail party for that matter,

1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:00.560
 and feel just exhausted is because if you were listening

1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:02.500
 to conversations there or trying to listen

1:05:02.500 --> 1:05:04.420
 to those conversations while watching the game

1:05:04.420 --> 1:05:07.160
 and people moving past you and hearing all this noise,

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.520
 clinking of glasses, et cetera,

1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:12.360
 it takes attentional effort,

1:05:12.360 --> 1:05:17.360
 and the brain uses up a lot of energy just at rest,

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:19.940
 but it uses up even more energy

1:05:19.940 --> 1:05:22.160
 when you are paying strong attention to something,

1:05:22.160 --> 1:05:23.640
 literally caloric energy,

1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:25.500
 burning up things like glucose, et cetera.

1:05:25.500 --> 1:05:28.640
 Even if you're ketogenic, it's burning up energy.

1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:32.660
 So the cocktail party effect has been studied extensively

1:05:32.660 --> 1:05:33.840
 in the field of neuroscience,

1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:36.580
 and we now know at a mechanistic level

1:05:36.580 --> 1:05:40.740
 how one accomplishes this feat of attending to certain sounds

1:05:40.740 --> 1:05:43.480
 despite the fact that we are being bombarded

1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:45.380
 with all sorts of other sounds.

1:05:45.380 --> 1:05:46.880
 So there are a couple of ways that we do this.

1:05:46.880 --> 1:05:51.880
 First of all, much as with our visual system,

1:05:51.980 --> 1:05:56.980
 we can expand or contract our visual field of view.

1:05:57.760 --> 1:05:59.560
 So we can go from panoramic vision,

1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:03.320
 see the entire scene that we are in by dilating our gaze.

1:06:03.320 --> 1:06:05.840
 I've talked a lot about this on this podcast and elsewhere.

1:06:05.840 --> 1:06:08.520
 We can, for instance, keep our head and eyes stationary

1:06:08.520 --> 1:06:09.560
 or mostly stationary.

1:06:09.560 --> 1:06:10.560
 You don't have to be rigid about it,

1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:11.920
 and you can expand your field of view

1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:14.200
 so you can see the walls and ceiling and floor.

1:06:14.200 --> 1:06:15.360
 You can see yourself in the environment.

1:06:15.360 --> 1:06:16.720
 That's panoramic view.

1:06:16.720 --> 1:06:18.880
 It's what you would accomplish without having to try at all

1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:21.880
 if you went to a horizon, for instance.

1:06:21.880 --> 1:06:23.520
 Or we can contract our field of view.

1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:26.720
 I can bring my focus to a particular location,

1:06:26.720 --> 1:06:28.560
 what we call a vergence point, directly in front of me.

1:06:28.560 --> 1:06:31.480
 Now I'm pointing at the camera directly in front of me.

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:32.320
 Okay, we can do that.

1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:34.220
 We can expand and contract our visual field of view.

1:06:34.220 --> 1:06:39.220
 Well, we can expand and contract our auditory field of view,

1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:43.080
 so to speak, or our auditory window.

1:06:43.080 --> 1:06:46.400
 You can try this next time you are in an environment

1:06:46.400 --> 1:06:49.440
 that's rich with noise, meaning lots of different sounds.

1:06:49.440 --> 1:06:54.440
 You can just tune out all the noise to a background chatter.

1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:56.900
 You kind of just, you try not focus

1:06:56.900 --> 1:06:59.280
 on any one particular sound,

1:06:59.280 --> 1:07:02.960
 and you get the background kind of chatter of noise.

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:05.040
 And you'll find that it's actually very relaxing

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:06.840
 in comparison to trying to listen to somebody

1:07:06.840 --> 1:07:08.560
 at a cocktail party and you're shouting back and forth.

1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:10.560
 Now, if you're very, very interested in that person

1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:13.940
 or getting to know them better or what they're telling you

1:07:13.940 --> 1:07:15.440
 or some combination of those things,

1:07:15.440 --> 1:07:17.420
 then you'll be very motivated to do it,

1:07:17.420 --> 1:07:21.220
 but nonetheless, it requires energy and effort and attention.

1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:23.280
 How do we do this?

1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:26.120
 Well, it's actually quite simple,

1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:29.600
 or at least it's simple in essence,

1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:32.760
 although the underlying mechanisms are complex.

1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:35.900
 Here, I have to credit the laboratory

1:07:35.900 --> 1:07:39.560
 of a guy named Mike Wehr, W-E-H-R,

1:07:39.560 --> 1:07:41.160
 up at the University of Oregon,

1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:45.220
 who essentially figured out that we are able

1:07:45.220 --> 1:07:48.020
 to accomplish this extraction of particular sounds.

1:07:48.020 --> 1:07:52.160
 We can really hear one person or a small number of people

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:54.840
 amidst a huge background of chatter

1:07:54.840 --> 1:07:59.840
 because we pay attention to the onset of words,

1:07:59.960 --> 1:08:03.000
 but also to the offset of words.

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:07.040
 Now, the way to visualize this is if the background noise

1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:08.920
 is just like a bunch of waves of noise,

1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:11.320
 it's literally just sound waves coming every frequency,

1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:13.720
 low frequency, high frequency, glasses clinking together.

1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:15.200
 If you're at a game, people are shouting,

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:17.080
 people are talking on their phone.

1:08:17.080 --> 1:08:20.280
 There's the crack of the ball if somebody actually manages

1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:24.420
 to hit the ball, the announcer, et cetera.

1:08:24.420 --> 1:08:27.300
 But whatever we're paying attention to,

1:08:27.300 --> 1:08:29.620
 we set up a cone of auditory attention,

1:08:29.620 --> 1:08:32.280
 a kind of a tunnel of auditory attention

1:08:32.280 --> 1:08:34.400
 where we are listening, although we don't realize it,

1:08:34.400 --> 1:08:39.060
 we are listening for the onset and the offset of those words.

1:08:39.060 --> 1:08:41.680
 Now, this is powerful for a couple of reasons.

1:08:41.680 --> 1:08:46.680
 First of all, it's a call to arms, so to speak,

1:08:47.340 --> 1:08:50.520
 to disengage your auditory system

1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:52.420
 when you don't need to focus your attention

1:08:52.420 --> 1:08:53.840
 on something particular.

1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:56.020
 So if you are somebody, you're coming home from work,

1:08:56.020 --> 1:08:57.760
 you've had a very long day,

1:08:57.760 --> 1:09:01.820
 and you're trying to make out a particular conversation

1:09:01.820 --> 1:09:03.420
 on background noise,

1:09:03.420 --> 1:09:06.380
 you might consider just not having that conversation,

1:09:06.380 --> 1:09:10.420
 just letting your auditory landscape be very broad,

1:09:10.420 --> 1:09:11.880
 almost like panoramic vision.

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:14.600
 If you're trying to learn

1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:17.040
 how to extract sound information,

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:22.040
 it could be notes of music, it could be scales of music,

1:09:22.040 --> 1:09:24.780
 it could be words spoken by somebody else.

1:09:24.780 --> 1:09:27.500
 Maybe somebody is telling you what you need to say

1:09:27.500 --> 1:09:29.080
 for a particular speech,

1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:31.440
 or the information that you need to learn

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:34.920
 for a particular topic, and they're telling it to you.

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:37.740
 Deliberately paying attention both to the onset

1:09:37.740 --> 1:09:41.320
 and to the offset of those words can be beneficial

1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:44.860
 because it is exactly the way that the auditory system

1:09:44.860 --> 1:09:47.220
 likes to bring in information.

1:09:47.220 --> 1:09:50.460
 So one of the more common phenomenon

1:09:50.460 --> 1:09:51.740
 that I think we all experience

1:09:51.740 --> 1:09:54.940
 is you go to a party, or you meet somebody new,

1:09:54.940 --> 1:09:57.360
 and you say, hi, I would say, hi, I'm Andrew,

1:09:57.360 --> 1:09:59.820
 and they'd say, hi, I'm Jeff, for instance,

1:09:59.820 --> 1:10:00.660
 great to meet you.

1:10:00.660 --> 1:10:03.920
 And then a minute later, I can't remember the guy's name.

1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:05.660
 Now, is it because I don't care what his name is?

1:10:05.660 --> 1:10:08.100
 No, somehow the presence

1:10:08.100 --> 1:10:10.260
 of other auditory information interfered.

1:10:10.260 --> 1:10:12.740
 It's not that my mind was necessarily someplace else,

1:10:12.740 --> 1:10:17.500
 it's that the signal to noise, as we say, wasn't high enough.

1:10:17.500 --> 1:10:22.460
 Somehow the way he said it or the way it landed on my ears,

1:10:22.460 --> 1:10:24.660
 which is really all that matters, right,

1:10:24.660 --> 1:10:26.440
 when it comes down to learning,

1:10:26.440 --> 1:10:29.820
 is such that it just didn't achieve

1:10:29.820 --> 1:10:31.620
 high enough signal to noise.

1:10:31.620 --> 1:10:33.940
 The noise was too high or the signal was too low

1:10:33.940 --> 1:10:35.820
 or some combination of those.

1:10:35.820 --> 1:10:37.460
 So the next time you ask somebody's name,

1:10:37.460 --> 1:10:40.060
 remember, listen to the onset of what they say

1:10:40.060 --> 1:10:40.900
 and the offset.

1:10:40.900 --> 1:10:43.940
 So it would be paying attention to the j in Jeff,

1:10:43.940 --> 1:10:47.500
 and it would be paying attention to the th in F, in Jeff,

1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:49.540
 excuse me, all right?

1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:53.140
 And chances are you'll be able to remember that name.

1:10:53.140 --> 1:10:58.020
 Now, I don't know if people who are super learners of names

1:10:58.020 --> 1:10:59.380
 do this naturally or not.

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:01.020
 I don't have access to their brains.

1:11:01.020 --> 1:11:02.180
 I don't think they're going to give me access

1:11:02.180 --> 1:11:03.500
 to their brains either,

1:11:03.500 --> 1:11:07.060
 but it's a very interesting way to take the natural biology

1:11:07.060 --> 1:11:08.820
 of auditory attention and learning

1:11:08.820 --> 1:11:11.700
 and apply it to scenarios where you're trying to remember

1:11:11.700 --> 1:11:14.540
 either people's names or specific information.

1:11:14.540 --> 1:11:17.580
 Now, I do acknowledge that trying to learn every word

1:11:17.580 --> 1:11:21.560
 in a sentence by paying attention to its onset and offset

1:11:21.560 --> 1:11:23.020
 could actually be kind of disruptive

1:11:23.020 --> 1:11:24.780
 to the learning process.

1:11:24.780 --> 1:11:27.340
 So this would be more for specific attention.

1:11:27.340 --> 1:11:29.520
 Like you're asking directions in a city and somebody says,

1:11:29.520 --> 1:11:32.220
 okay, you say you're lost, and they say, okay,

1:11:32.220 --> 1:11:34.540
 you're going to go two blocks down,

1:11:34.540 --> 1:11:35.860
 you're going to turn left,

1:11:35.860 --> 1:11:37.820
 and then you're going to see a landmark on your right,

1:11:37.820 --> 1:11:42.820
 and then you're going to go in the third door on your left.

1:11:42.860 --> 1:11:45.420
 That's a lot of information, at least for me, okay?

1:11:45.420 --> 1:11:48.180
 So the way you would want to listen to that is

1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:50.260
 you're going to go down the road.

1:11:50.260 --> 1:11:51.240
 See, I already forgot.

1:11:51.240 --> 1:11:54.720
 You're going to go left, and you're just going to program,

1:11:54.720 --> 1:11:56.220
 and instead of just hearing the word left,

1:11:56.220 --> 1:11:59.900
 you're going to think the L at the front of left and the T.

1:11:59.900 --> 1:12:02.140
 You're going to left, okay?

1:12:02.140 --> 1:12:05.060
 And then, so you're coding in specific words,

1:12:05.060 --> 1:12:07.780
 and what this does is this kind of hijacks

1:12:07.780 --> 1:12:09.980
 these naturally occurring attention mechanisms

1:12:09.980 --> 1:12:12.500
 that the auditory system likes to use.

1:12:12.500 --> 1:12:15.460
 It's a little bit of data that for auditory encoding,

1:12:15.460 --> 1:12:17.640
 this kind of thing can be beneficial.

1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:20.580
 There are a lot of data that attention

1:12:20.580 --> 1:12:23.660
 for auditory coding is beneficial.

1:12:23.660 --> 1:12:26.660
 There are a little bit of data showing

1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:29.980
 that deliberately encoding auditory information this way,

1:12:29.980 --> 1:12:32.760
 meaning trying to learn auditory information this way,

1:12:32.760 --> 1:12:35.580
 can be beneficial or can accelerate learning.

1:12:35.580 --> 1:12:39.000
 And some of these features of what I'm describing here

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:43.580
 map onto some of the work of Mike Merzenich and others

1:12:43.580 --> 1:12:46.500
 that have been designed to try and overcome things

1:12:46.500 --> 1:12:49.780
 like stutter and to treat various forms

1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:52.180
 of auditory learning disorders.

1:12:52.180 --> 1:12:56.620
 But more importantly, and perhaps more powerful,

1:12:56.620 --> 1:12:59.020
 is the work of Mike Merzenich

1:12:59.020 --> 1:13:01.260
 that was done with his then graduate student,

1:13:01.260 --> 1:13:03.700
 Greg Recanzone, that showed that

1:13:03.700 --> 1:13:06.700
 using the attentional system,

1:13:06.700 --> 1:13:09.360
 we can actually learn much faster

1:13:09.360 --> 1:13:12.660
 and we can actually activate neuroplasticity

1:13:12.660 --> 1:13:15.980
 in the adult brain, something that's very challenging to do,

1:13:15.980 --> 1:13:19.460
 and that the auditory system is one of the main ways

1:13:19.460 --> 1:13:22.580
 in which we can access neuroplasticity more broadly.

1:13:22.580 --> 1:13:24.120
 So I just want to take a couple of minutes

1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:26.340
 and describe the work of Recanzone and Merzenich

1:13:26.340 --> 1:13:30.500
 because it's absolutely fantastic and fascinating.

1:13:30.500 --> 1:13:33.980
 What they did is they had subjects

1:13:33.980 --> 1:13:36.940
 try to learn auditory information,

1:13:36.940 --> 1:13:40.020
 except that they told them to pay attention

1:13:40.020 --> 1:13:42.400
 to particular frequencies.

1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:43.760
 So now you know what frequencies are,

1:13:43.760 --> 1:13:47.420
 so essentially high-pitched sounds or low-pitched sounds.

1:13:48.620 --> 1:13:52.300
 What they found was just passively listening

1:13:52.300 --> 1:13:56.180
 to a bunch of stuff does not allow the brain to change

1:13:56.180 --> 1:13:58.920
 and for that stuff to be remembered at all.

1:13:58.920 --> 1:13:59.940
 That's not a surprise.

1:13:59.940 --> 1:14:03.540
 We've all experienced the phenomenon of having someone talk

1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:04.880
 and we see their mouth moving and we're like,

1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:06.620
 yeah, this is really important, this is really important,

1:14:06.620 --> 1:14:07.980
 we're listening, we're trying to listen,

1:14:07.980 --> 1:14:09.260
 and then they walk away and we think,

1:14:09.260 --> 1:14:11.340
 I didn't get any of that.

1:14:11.340 --> 1:14:13.340
 And you wonder whether or not it was them,

1:14:13.340 --> 1:14:14.980
 maybe this is happening to you right now,

1:14:14.980 --> 1:14:17.720
 you wonder whether or not it was you,

1:14:17.720 --> 1:14:19.740
 you wonder whether or not you have trouble with learning

1:14:19.740 --> 1:14:21.220
 or you have attention deficit,

1:14:21.220 --> 1:14:23.180
 it could be any number of different things.

1:14:23.180 --> 1:14:25.260
 But what Recanzone and Merzenich discovered

1:14:25.260 --> 1:14:28.480
 was that if you instruct subjects to listen

1:14:28.480 --> 1:14:32.780
 for particular cues within speech or within sounds,

1:14:32.780 --> 1:14:35.740
 that not only can you learn those things more quickly,

1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:40.740
 but that you can remap these tonotopic maps in the cortex

1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:43.140
 that I referred to earlier,

1:14:43.140 --> 1:14:45.420
 you actually get changes in the neural architecture,

1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:46.980
 the neural circuitry in the brain,

1:14:46.980 --> 1:14:50.640
 and this can occur not only very rapidly,

1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:53.100
 but they can occur in the adult brain,

1:14:53.100 --> 1:14:54.860
 which prior to their work

1:14:54.860 --> 1:14:57.340
 was not thought to be amenable to change.

1:14:57.340 --> 1:14:59.420
 It was long thought that neuroplasticity

1:14:59.420 --> 1:15:01.220
 could only occur in the developing brain,

1:15:01.220 --> 1:15:03.180
 but the work of Recanzone and Merzenich

1:15:03.180 --> 1:15:06.780
 in the auditory system actually was some of the first

1:15:06.780 --> 1:15:10.700
 that really opened up everybody's eyes and ears

1:15:10.700 --> 1:15:14.060
 to the idea that the brain can change in adulthood.

1:15:14.060 --> 1:15:16.340
 So here's how this sort of process would work

1:15:16.340 --> 1:15:18.340
 and how you might apply it.

1:15:18.340 --> 1:15:20.540
 If you are trying to learn music

1:15:20.540 --> 1:15:23.520
 or you're trying to learn information

1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:25.180
 that you're going to then recite,

1:15:25.180 --> 1:15:30.100
 you can decide to highlight certain words

1:15:30.100 --> 1:15:33.620
 or certain frequencies of sound

1:15:33.620 --> 1:15:36.380
 or certain scales or certain keys on the piano

1:15:36.380 --> 1:15:40.220
 and to only focus on those for certain learning bouts, okay?

1:15:40.220 --> 1:15:44.320
 So I'll give an example that's sort of real time for me,

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:45.980
 meaning it's happening right now.

1:15:47.860 --> 1:15:51.340
 I know generally what I want to say when I arrive here.

1:15:51.340 --> 1:15:53.280
 I even know specifically certain things

1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:55.500
 that I want to make sure get across to you,

1:15:56.380 --> 1:15:58.900
 but I don't think about every single word

1:15:58.900 --> 1:16:01.460
 that I'm going to say and the precise order

1:16:01.460 --> 1:16:03.300
 in which I'm going to say those things.

1:16:03.300 --> 1:16:05.200
 That would be actually very disruptive

1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:07.500
 because it wouldn't match my normal patterns of speech

1:16:07.500 --> 1:16:10.540
 and you'd probably think I was sounding rather robotic

1:16:10.540 --> 1:16:11.840
 if I were to do that.

1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:15.820
 So one way that we can remember information is

1:16:15.820 --> 1:16:19.140
 as we write out, for instance, something that we want to say,

1:16:19.140 --> 1:16:20.900
 we can highlight particular words.

1:16:20.900 --> 1:16:22.260
 We can underline those.

1:16:22.260 --> 1:16:24.640
 If we're listening to somebody

1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:28.760
 and they are telling us information,

1:16:28.760 --> 1:16:31.740
 we can decide just to highlight particular words

1:16:31.740 --> 1:16:34.400
 that they said to us and write those down.

1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:36.980
 Now, of course, we're listening to all the information,

1:16:36.980 --> 1:16:38.880
 but the work of Reckinzone and Murzenich

1:16:39.860 --> 1:16:42.480
 and the work of others, in addition to them,

1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:46.620
 his former student or former postdoc, I don't know which,

1:16:46.620 --> 1:16:49.540
 Michael Kilgard, who's now got his own lab down in Texas,

1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:52.440
 or others, have shown that the queuing of attention

1:16:52.440 --> 1:16:54.700
 to particular features of speech,

1:16:54.700 --> 1:16:57.020
 particular components of speech,

1:16:57.020 --> 1:17:00.440
 the way in which it increases our level of attention overall

1:17:00.440 --> 1:17:04.120
 allows us to capture more of the information overall.

1:17:04.120 --> 1:17:05.960
 And so I don't want this to be abstract at all.

1:17:05.960 --> 1:17:07.880
 What this means is when you're listening,

1:17:07.880 --> 1:17:10.400
 you don't have to listen to every word.

1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:12.080
 You're already listening to every word.

1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:14.380
 All the information's coming in through your ears.

1:17:14.380 --> 1:17:18.760
 What you're trying to extract is particular things

1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:20.720
 or themes within the content.

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:22.580
 So maybe you decide, if you're listening to me,

1:17:22.580 --> 1:17:26.160
 that you're only going to listen to the word tools,

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:27.200
 or you're only going to listen

1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:29.800
 to when my voice kind of goes above background.

1:17:29.800 --> 1:17:32.680
 You get to decide what you decide to listen to or not.

1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:34.960
 And what you decide to focus on

1:17:34.960 --> 1:17:37.360
 isn't necessarily as important

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:39.240
 as the fact that you're focusing.

1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:40.520
 So I hope that's clear.

1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:42.800
 The auditory system does this all the time

1:17:42.800 --> 1:17:44.000
 with the cocktail party effect.

1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.720
 What I'm talking about is exporting certain elements

1:17:46.720 --> 1:17:49.360
 of the mechanisms of the cocktail party effect,

1:17:49.360 --> 1:17:51.800
 paying attention to the onset and offset of words,

1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:55.520
 or particular notes within music, or particular scales,

1:17:55.520 --> 1:17:58.020
 or you can make it even broader

1:17:58.020 --> 1:18:00.200
 and particular motifs of music,

1:18:00.200 --> 1:18:03.520
 or particular sentences of words, or particular phrases.

1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:04.480
 And in doing that,

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:08.280
 you extract more of the information overall,

1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:09.480
 even though you're not paying attention

1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:11.760
 to all the information at once.

1:18:11.760 --> 1:18:13.440
 Now I'd like to talk about a phenomenon

1:18:13.440 --> 1:18:15.900
 that you've all experienced before,

1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:17.920
 which is called Doppler.

1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:22.920
 So the Doppler effect is the way that we experience sound

1:18:24.300 --> 1:18:27.840
 when the thing that's making that sound is moving.

1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:30.520
 The simplest way to explain this

1:18:30.520 --> 1:18:35.360
 is to translate the sound into the visual world once again.

1:18:35.360 --> 1:18:39.080
 So if you've ever seen a duck or a goose

1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:41.800
 sitting in a pond or a lake,

1:18:41.800 --> 1:18:44.420
 and it's kind of bobbing up and down,

1:18:44.420 --> 1:18:46.580
 what you'll notice is that the ripples of water

1:18:46.580 --> 1:18:49.360
 that extend out from that duck or goose

1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:52.080
 are fairly regularly spaced in all directions.

1:18:52.080 --> 1:18:54.720
 And that's because that duck or goose is stationary.

1:18:54.720 --> 1:18:55.540
 It's moving up and down,

1:18:55.540 --> 1:18:58.960
 but it's not moving forward or backward or to the side.

1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:02.080
 Now, if that duck or goose were to swim forward

1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:05.920
 by paddling its little webbed feet under the surface,

1:19:05.920 --> 1:19:09.080
 you would immediately notice that the ripples of water

1:19:09.080 --> 1:19:12.460
 that are close to and in front of that duck or goose

1:19:12.460 --> 1:19:15.480
 would be closer together than the ones that trailed it

1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:16.920
 that were behind.

1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:19.960
 And that is essentially what happens with sound as well.

1:19:21.160 --> 1:19:23.320
 With the Doppler effect,

1:19:23.320 --> 1:19:25.720
 we experience sounds that are closer to us

1:19:25.720 --> 1:19:29.440
 at higher frequency, the ripples are closer together,

1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:32.720
 and sounds that are further away at lower frequency,

1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:35.000
 especially when they're moving past us.

1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.060
 So if you've ever, for instance,

1:19:37.060 --> 1:19:39.300
 heard a siren in the distance,

1:19:39.300 --> 1:19:44.300
 nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh, nuh,

1:19:47.760 --> 1:19:50.400
 that's essentially my rendition of a siren,

1:19:50.400 --> 1:19:52.840
 I don't know what ambulance or police or what,

1:19:52.840 --> 1:19:54.920
 passing you on a street.

1:19:54.920 --> 1:19:57.280
 That is the Doppler effect.

1:19:57.280 --> 1:19:59.920
 The Doppler effect is one of the main ways

1:19:59.920 --> 1:20:04.920
 that we make out the direction that things are arriving from

1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:08.040
 and their speeds and trajectories.

1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:11.680
 And we get very good from a very young age

1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:15.280
 at discerning what direction things are arriving from

1:20:15.280 --> 1:20:19.320
 and the direction that they are going to pass us in.

1:20:19.320 --> 1:20:21.240
 And the Doppler effect has probably saved your life

1:20:21.240 --> 1:20:23.000
 many, many times.

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:24.520
 In this way, you just don't realize it

1:20:24.520 --> 1:20:25.920
 because you'll step off the curb

1:20:25.920 --> 1:20:29.280
 or you're driving your car and you pull to the side

1:20:29.280 --> 1:20:32.120
 so that the ambulance or fire truck can go by

1:20:32.120 --> 1:20:37.040
 because you heard that siren off in the distance.

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:38.500
 And then you pull away from the curb

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:39.960
 and you get back on the road,

1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:41.840
 in part because you don't see it any longer,

1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:44.940
 but also you don't hear any other sirens in the distance.

1:20:44.940 --> 1:20:49.000
 Now, some animals such as bats are exquisitely good

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:51.920
 at navigating their environments according to sound.

1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:55.320
 Now, we've all heard that bats don't see,

1:20:55.320 --> 1:20:57.680
 that's actually not true, they actually have vision,

1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:00.280
 but they just rely more heavily on their auditory system.

1:21:00.280 --> 1:21:03.480
 And the way that bats navigate in the dark

1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:06.280
 and the way that bats navigate using sound

1:21:06.280 --> 1:21:07.880
 is through Doppler.

1:21:07.880 --> 1:21:11.120
 Now, they don't simply listen to whether or not

1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:14.640
 things are coming at them or moving away from them

1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:15.760
 and pay attention to Doppler

1:21:15.760 --> 1:21:18.920
 like the siren example I gave for you.

1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:22.600
 What they do is they generate their own sounds.

1:21:22.600 --> 1:21:27.600
 So a bat, as it flies around, is sending out clicks.

1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:32.320
 I think that's my best bat sound, or maybe it is.

1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:35.080
 And they're clicking, they're actually propelling sound out

1:21:35.080 --> 1:21:38.320
 at a particular frequency that they know.

1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:40.180
 Now, whether or not they're conscious of it, I don't know.

1:21:40.180 --> 1:21:41.020
 I've never asked them.

1:21:41.020 --> 1:21:42.500
 And if I did ask them, I don't think they could answer.

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:43.340
 And if they could answer,

1:21:43.340 --> 1:21:45.820
 they couldn't answer in a language that I could understand.

1:21:45.820 --> 1:21:48.120
 But the bat is essentially flying around,

1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:49.760
 sending out sound waves,

1:21:49.760 --> 1:21:52.040
 pinging its environment with sound waves

1:21:52.040 --> 1:21:53.320
 of a particular frequency.

1:21:53.320 --> 1:21:55.800
 And then depending on the frequency of sound waves

1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:58.900
 that come back, they know if they're getting closer

1:21:58.900 --> 1:22:01.120
 to an object or further away from it.

1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:03.880
 So if they send out sounds at a frequency of,

1:22:03.880 --> 1:22:06.660
 this was much slower than it would actually occur,

1:22:06.660 --> 1:22:09.560
 but let's say one every half second,

1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:12.660
 and it's coming back even faster,

1:22:13.780 --> 1:22:15.700
 then they know they're getting closer

1:22:15.700 --> 1:22:18.000
 because of the Doppler effect.

1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.240
 And if it comes back more slowly,

1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:22.260
 they know that there's nothing in front of them.

1:22:22.260 --> 1:22:25.820
 So the bat is essentially navigating its world

1:22:25.820 --> 1:22:29.380
 by creating these auras of sound

1:22:29.380 --> 1:22:32.940
 that bounce back onto them from the various objects,

1:22:32.940 --> 1:22:35.500
 trees, et cetera, buildings, and people.

1:22:35.500 --> 1:22:36.380
 It's kind of eerie to think about,

1:22:36.380 --> 1:22:39.900
 but yes, they see you, they experience you with their sound,

1:22:39.900 --> 1:22:44.420
 they sense you, and they're using Doppler to accomplish it.

1:22:44.420 --> 1:22:47.980
 Now I'd like to talk about ringing in the ears.

1:22:47.980 --> 1:22:50.980
 This is something that I get asked about a lot.

1:22:50.980 --> 1:22:53.340
 And speaking of signal to noise,

1:22:53.340 --> 1:22:55.540
 I don't know if I get asked about it a lot

1:22:55.540 --> 1:22:58.900
 because many people suffer from ringing in their ears

1:22:58.900 --> 1:23:02.100
 or because the people who suffer from ringing in their ears

1:23:02.100 --> 1:23:05.460
 suffer so much that they are more prone to ask.

1:23:05.460 --> 1:23:08.300
 So it could be a sampling bias, I don't know,

1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:10.420
 but I've been asked enough times,

1:23:10.420 --> 1:23:12.780
 and some of the experiences of discomfort

1:23:12.780 --> 1:23:14.340
 that people have expressed

1:23:14.340 --> 1:23:16.300
 about having this ringing of the ears

1:23:17.300 --> 1:23:20.660
 really motivate me to go deep into this literature.

1:23:20.660 --> 1:23:24.100
 So the ringing of the ears that one experiences

1:23:24.100 --> 1:23:29.100
 is called tinnitus, not tinnitus, but tinnitus.

1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:32.700
 And tinnitus can vary in intensity

1:23:32.700 --> 1:23:36.220
 and it can vary according to stress levels.

1:23:36.220 --> 1:23:40.500
 It can vary across the lifespan or even time of day.

1:23:40.500 --> 1:23:43.360
 So it's very subject to kind of background effects

1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:45.800
 and contextual effects.

1:23:45.800 --> 1:23:48.820
 So I think we all know that we should do our best

1:23:48.820 --> 1:23:50.180
 to maximize healthy sleep.

1:23:50.180 --> 1:23:52.020
 We did a number of episodes on that.

1:23:52.020 --> 1:23:53.780
 Essentially the first four episodes

1:23:53.780 --> 1:23:55.620
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast were all about sleep

1:23:55.620 --> 1:23:57.020
 and how to get better sleep.

1:23:57.020 --> 1:24:00.120
 We all know that we should try and limit our stress,

1:24:00.120 --> 1:24:02.220
 and we had an episode about stress

1:24:02.220 --> 1:24:04.400
 and ways to mitigate stress as well.

1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:08.440
 However, there are people, it seems,

1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:09.860
 that are suffering from tinnitus

1:24:09.860 --> 1:24:12.400
 for which stress or lack of sleep

1:24:12.400 --> 1:24:15.000
 just can't explain the presence of the tinnitus.

1:24:15.900 --> 1:24:20.580
 Tinnitus can be caused by disruption to these hair cells

1:24:20.580 --> 1:24:23.660
 that we talked about earlier or damage to the hair cells.

1:24:23.660 --> 1:24:25.180
 So that's another reason why,

1:24:25.180 --> 1:24:28.420
 even if you have good hearing now,

1:24:28.420 --> 1:24:30.060
 that you want to protect that hearing

1:24:30.060 --> 1:24:32.540
 and really avoid putting yourself

1:24:32.540 --> 1:24:34.660
 into these kind of two-hit environments,

1:24:34.660 --> 1:24:36.920
 environments where there's a lot of background noise

1:24:36.920 --> 1:24:40.940
 and then you add another really loud auditory stimulus.

1:24:40.940 --> 1:24:43.540
 This also can happen at different times, I should mention.

1:24:43.540 --> 1:24:46.860
 If you go to a concert or you listen to loud music

1:24:46.860 --> 1:24:49.620
 with your headphones and then you go to a concert

1:24:49.620 --> 1:24:52.140
 or you go into a very loud work environment,

1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:53.900
 the hair cells can still be vulnerable.

1:24:53.900 --> 1:24:56.560
 And once those hair cells are knocked out,

1:24:56.560 --> 1:24:58.780
 currently we don't have the technology to put them back,

1:24:58.780 --> 1:24:59.940
 although many groups,

1:24:59.940 --> 1:25:03.220
 including some excellent groups at Stanford and elsewhere,

1:25:03.220 --> 1:25:05.380
 too, of course, are working on ways

1:25:05.380 --> 1:25:08.720
 to replenish those hair cells and restore hearing.

1:25:09.800 --> 1:25:11.540
 There are treatments for tinnitus

1:25:11.540 --> 1:25:16.380
 that involve taking certain substances.

1:25:17.340 --> 1:25:19.860
 There are medications for tinnitus.

1:25:19.860 --> 1:25:21.820
 In the non-prescription landscape,

1:25:21.820 --> 1:25:24.300
 which is typically what we discuss on this podcast

1:25:24.300 --> 1:25:26.020
 when we discuss taking anything,

1:25:27.620 --> 1:25:29.620
 there are essentially four compounds

1:25:29.620 --> 1:25:32.580
 for which there are quality peer-reviewed data

1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:36.880
 where there does not appear to be any overt commercial bias,

1:25:36.880 --> 1:25:39.060
 meaning that nothing's reported in the papers

1:25:39.060 --> 1:25:41.140
 as funding from a particular company.

1:25:41.140 --> 1:25:46.140
 And those are melatonin, ginkgo bilboa, zinc, and magnesium.

1:25:46.420 --> 1:25:49.060
 Now, I've talked about melatonin before.

1:25:49.060 --> 1:25:53.100
 I'm personally not a fan of melatonin as a sleep aid,

1:25:53.100 --> 1:25:55.440
 but there are four studies.

1:25:56.380 --> 1:25:57.220
 First one entitled,

1:25:57.220 --> 1:26:02.220
 the effects of melatonin on tinnitus and sleep.

1:26:02.660 --> 1:26:05.780
 Second one, treatment of central and sensory neural tinnitus

1:26:05.780 --> 1:26:07.620
 with orally administered melatonin.

1:26:07.620 --> 1:26:09.620
 And then the title goes on much longer,

1:26:09.620 --> 1:26:11.560
 but it's a randomized study.

1:26:11.560 --> 1:26:12.700
 I'm not going to read out all of these.

1:26:12.700 --> 1:26:14.660
 Melatonin, can it stop the ringing?

1:26:14.660 --> 1:26:17.700
 Which is an interesting article, double-blinded study.

1:26:17.700 --> 1:26:20.000
 And the effects of melatonin on tinnitus.

1:26:21.020 --> 1:26:23.820
 Each one of these studies has anywhere from 30

1:26:23.820 --> 1:26:28.260
 to more than 100 subjects, in one case, 102 subjects,

1:26:28.260 --> 1:26:30.980
 both genders as they list them out.

1:26:30.980 --> 1:26:34.060
 Typically it's listed as sex, not gender in studies.

1:26:34.060 --> 1:26:37.400
 So it should say both sexes, but nonetheless.

1:26:38.780 --> 1:26:42.580
 An age range anywhere from 30 years old

1:26:42.580 --> 1:26:44.380
 all the way up to 65 plus.

1:26:44.380 --> 1:26:47.780
 I didn't see any studies of people younger than 30.

1:26:48.760 --> 1:26:51.980
 All three focused on melatonin,

1:26:51.980 --> 1:26:54.620
 not surprisingly because of the titles.

1:26:54.620 --> 1:26:56.060
 Looking at a range of dosages

1:26:56.060 --> 1:26:58.620
 anywhere from three milligrams per day,

1:26:58.620 --> 1:27:02.280
 which is sort of typical of many supplements for melatonin,

1:27:02.280 --> 1:27:05.720
 still much higher than one would manufacture

1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:08.300
 endogenously through your own pineal gland.

1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:12.300
 But three milligrams in these studies

1:27:12.300 --> 1:27:15.340
 for a duration of anywhere from 30 days

1:27:15.340 --> 1:27:19.260
 to much longer in some cases, six months.

1:27:19.260 --> 1:27:22.680
 And all four of these studies found modest,

1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:26.040
 yet still statistically significant effects

1:27:26.040 --> 1:27:28.200
 of taking melatonin by mouth,

1:27:28.200 --> 1:27:30.440
 so it's orally administered melatonin,

1:27:31.340 --> 1:27:36.300
 in reducing the severity of tinnitus.

1:27:36.300 --> 1:27:39.060
 So that's compelling, at least to me.

1:27:39.060 --> 1:27:40.940
 It doesn't sound like a cure.

1:27:40.940 --> 1:27:44.420
 And of course, as always, I'm not a physician.

1:27:44.420 --> 1:27:46.460
 I'm a scientist, so I don't prescribe anything.

1:27:46.460 --> 1:27:47.480
 I only profess things.

1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:48.640
 I report to you the science.

1:27:48.640 --> 1:27:51.060
 You have to decide if melatonin is right for you,

1:27:51.060 --> 1:27:53.100
 if you have tinnitus.

1:27:53.100 --> 1:27:56.260
 And certainly I say that both to protect myself,

1:27:56.260 --> 1:27:57.560
 but also protect you.

1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:00.000
 You're responsible for your health and wellbeing.

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.340
 And I'm not telling anyone to run out

1:28:02.340 --> 1:28:05.240
 and start taking melatonin for tinnitus,

1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:07.300
 but it does seem that it can have some effects

1:28:07.300 --> 1:28:09.480
 in reducing its symptoms.

1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:13.080
 Ginkgo boa boa is an interesting compound.

1:28:13.080 --> 1:28:17.160
 It's been prescribed for or recommended for many,

1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:21.840
 many things, but there are a few studies,

1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:24.920
 again, double-blinded studies lasting one to six months.

1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:27.940
 Any one that has an impressive number of subjects,

1:28:27.940 --> 1:28:32.940
 978 subjects ranging from age 18 all the way up to 65,

1:28:33.080 --> 1:28:34.900
 so on and so forth,

1:28:34.900 --> 1:28:39.900
 that show not huge effects of ginkgo,

1:28:40.440 --> 1:28:41.840
 but as they quote,

1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:44.520
 "'limited evidence' suggests that if tinnitus

1:28:44.520 --> 1:28:47.160
 is a side effect of something else,

1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:49.440
 in particular cognitive decline,"

1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:54.440
 so age-related tinnitus might be helped by ginkgo boa boa.

1:28:56.800 --> 1:28:58.960
 I won't go through all the details of the zinc studies,

1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:01.420
 but it seems that zinc supplementation at higher levels

1:29:01.420 --> 1:29:03.280
 than are typical of most people's intake,

1:29:03.280 --> 1:29:05.280
 so 50 milligrams per day,

1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:07.460
 do appear to be able to reduce subjective symptoms

1:29:07.460 --> 1:29:09.940
 of tinnitus in most of the people

1:29:09.940 --> 1:29:11.720
 that took the supplemented zinc.

1:29:11.720 --> 1:29:13.860
 There aren't a lot of studies on that,

1:29:13.860 --> 1:29:16.800
 so I could only find one double-blinded study.

1:29:16.800 --> 1:29:19.560
 It lasted anywhere from one to six months, 41 subjects,

1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:23.400
 both genders listed out again here, 45 to 64,

1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:25.040
 and they saw a decrease in the severity

1:29:25.040 --> 1:29:28.880
 of tinnitus symptoms with 50 milligrams

1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:31.280
 of elemental zinc supplementation.

1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:34.320
 And then last but not least is the magnesium study.

1:29:34.320 --> 1:29:36.360
 Again, only a single study.

1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:38.320
 It's a phase II study

1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:41.000
 looking at a fairly limited number of subjects,

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:42.920
 so only 19 subjects,

1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:46.440
 taking 532 milligrams of elemental magnesium.

1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:47.720
 For those of you that take magnesium,

1:29:47.720 --> 1:29:49.560
 there's magnesium and elemental magnesium,

1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:52.280
 and it's always translated on the bottle,

1:29:52.280 --> 1:29:54.760
 but it was associated with a lessening of symptoms

1:29:54.760 --> 1:29:56.060
 related to tinnitus.

1:29:56.060 --> 1:29:59.720
 So for you tinnitus sufferers out there,

1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:01.200
 you may already be aware of this.

1:30:01.200 --> 1:30:03.660
 You may already be taking these things

1:30:03.660 --> 1:30:06.280
 and had no positive effects,

1:30:06.280 --> 1:30:08.440
 meaning they didn't help, maybe not.

1:30:08.440 --> 1:30:11.520
 I hope that you'll at least consider these,

1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:13.120
 talk to your doctor about them.

1:30:13.120 --> 1:30:16.240
 I do realize that tinnitus is extremely disruptive.

1:30:16.240 --> 1:30:18.880
 I can't say I empathize

1:30:18.880 --> 1:30:21.520
 because I don't from a place of experience, that is,

1:30:21.520 --> 1:30:22.660
 because I don't have tinnitus,

1:30:22.660 --> 1:30:24.640
 but for those of you that don't, including myself,

1:30:24.640 --> 1:30:27.120
 you can imagine that hearing sounds

1:30:27.120 --> 1:30:28.320
 of things that aren't there

1:30:28.320 --> 1:30:30.400
 and the ringing in one's ears can be very disruptive,

1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:33.000
 and I think would be very disruptive,

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:36.300
 and it explains why people with tinnitus reach out so often

1:30:36.300 --> 1:30:38.320
 with questions about how to alleviate that,

1:30:38.320 --> 1:30:40.840
 and I hope this information was useful to you.

1:30:40.840 --> 1:30:44.800
 I'd like to now talk about balance and our sense of balance,

1:30:44.800 --> 1:30:48.040
 which is controlled by, believe it or not,

1:30:48.040 --> 1:30:50.960
 our ears and things in our ears,

1:30:50.960 --> 1:30:55.540
 as well as by our brain and elements of our spinal cord.

1:30:55.540 --> 1:30:58.160
 But before I do that, I want to ask you another question,

1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:00.720
 or I would rather, I'd like to ask you

1:31:00.720 --> 1:31:03.360
 to ask yourself a question and answer it,

1:31:03.360 --> 1:31:07.240
 which is how big are your ears?

1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:10.540
 It turns out that the ears grow our entire life.

1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:15.400
 In the early stage of our life, they grow more slowly,

1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:19.120
 and then as we age, they grow more quickly.

1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:22.120
 You may have noticed if you have family members

1:31:22.120 --> 1:31:25.000
 who are well into their 70s and 80s,

1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:28.840
 and if you're fortunate into their 90s

1:31:28.840 --> 1:31:32.320
 and maybe even hundreds is that the ears

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:35.160
 of some of these individuals get very, very big

1:31:35.160 --> 1:31:38.400
 relative to their previous ear sizes.

1:31:38.400 --> 1:31:41.440
 It turns out that biological age

1:31:41.440 --> 1:31:46.180
 can actually be measured according to ear size.

1:31:46.180 --> 1:31:47.500
 Now, you have to take a few measurements,

1:31:47.500 --> 1:31:50.400
 but believe it or not, there is a formula

1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:51.880
 in the scientific literature.

1:31:51.880 --> 1:31:56.560
 If you know your ear circumference,

1:31:56.560 --> 1:32:01.320
 so the distance around your ear, ears, plural,

1:32:01.320 --> 1:32:05.280
 presumably you have two, most people do, in millimeters,

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:07.980
 so you're going to take the circumference of your ears

1:32:07.980 --> 1:32:10.120
 in millimeters, how would you do this, right?

1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:11.040
 How would you do this?

1:32:11.040 --> 1:32:14.360
 Maybe you take a string and you put it around your ear

1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:15.400
 and then you measure the string.

1:32:15.400 --> 1:32:16.400
 That's probably going to be easier

1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:19.560
 than marching around your ear or somebody else's ear

1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:21.560
 with a ruler and measuring in millimeters.

1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:23.520
 So what's your ear circumference?

1:32:23.520 --> 1:32:26.380
 On the outside, don't go in on the divot or anything,

1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:28.020
 you're just going around as if you were going to trace

1:32:28.020 --> 1:32:32.320
 the closest fitting oval, assuming your ears are oval,

1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:36.000
 closest fitting oval that matches your ear circumference.

1:32:36.980 --> 1:32:40.920
 Take that number in millimeters, subtract from it.

1:32:40.920 --> 1:32:43.240
 Oh, excuse me, I should do this correctly.

1:32:43.240 --> 1:32:46.040
 Do that for both ears, add them together,

1:32:46.040 --> 1:32:47.840
 add those numbers together, divide by two,

1:32:47.840 --> 1:32:50.120
 get the average for your two ears,

1:32:50.120 --> 1:32:51.800
 get your average ear circumference

1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:53.520
 from across your two ears,

1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:58.180
 then take that number in millimeters, subtract 88.1,

1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:04.360
 and then whatever value that is, multiply it times 1.96,

1:33:04.360 --> 1:33:07.360
 and that will tell you your biological age.

1:33:07.360 --> 1:33:10.700
 Now, why in the world would this be accurate?

1:33:10.700 --> 1:33:14.080
 Well, as we age, there are changes in a number

1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:15.780
 of different biological pathways.

1:33:17.620 --> 1:33:19.680
 One of those pathways is the pathways related

1:33:19.680 --> 1:33:21.760
 to collagen synthesis.

1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:24.520
 So not only are our ears growing,

1:33:24.520 --> 1:33:27.000
 but our noses are growing too.

1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:29.380
 My nose seems to be growing a lot, but then again,

1:33:29.380 --> 1:33:31.200
 I did sports where I would get my nose broken,

1:33:31.200 --> 1:33:32.460
 something I don't recommend.

1:33:32.460 --> 1:33:34.180
 So I always point out, you don't get a nose like mine

1:33:34.180 --> 1:33:38.400
 doing yoga, but nonetheless, my nose is still growing

1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:41.180
 and my ears are still growing, and I suspect as I get older,

1:33:41.180 --> 1:33:45.000
 if I have the good fortune of living into my 80s and 90s,

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:47.320
 my ears are going to continue to grow.

1:33:47.320 --> 1:33:49.240
 A comparison between chronological age

1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:50.760
 and biological age is something that's

1:33:50.760 --> 1:33:52.320
 of really deep interest these days,

1:33:52.320 --> 1:33:54.240
 and the work of David Sinclair

1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:57.480
 at Harvard Medical School and others,

1:33:57.480 --> 1:34:01.000
 so-called Horvath clocks that people have developed,

1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:04.200
 have tapped into how the epigenome and the genome

1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:07.800
 can give us some insight into our biological age

1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:09.800
 and how that compares to our chronological age.

1:34:09.800 --> 1:34:11.980
 Most of us know our chronological age

1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:13.840
 because we know when we were born,

1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:16.920
 and we know where we are relative to that now.

1:34:16.920 --> 1:34:21.920
 But you can start to make a little chart, if you like,

1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:23.860
 about your rates of ear growth.

1:34:23.860 --> 1:34:26.320
 Your rates of ear growth actually correlate pretty well

1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:29.640
 with your rates of biological progression

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:32.440
 through this thing that we call life.

1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:34.680
 So it's not something that we think about too often,

1:34:34.680 --> 1:34:38.760
 but just like our DNA and our epigenome

1:34:38.760 --> 1:34:41.440
 and some other markers of metabolic health

1:34:41.440 --> 1:34:43.920
 and hormone health relate to our age,

1:34:43.920 --> 1:34:46.000
 so does our collagen synthesis,

1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.040
 and one of the places that shows up the most

1:34:48.040 --> 1:34:50.240
 is in these two little goodies on the sides of our heads,

1:34:50.240 --> 1:34:51.720
 which are our ears.

1:34:51.720 --> 1:34:54.880
 So even though it's a little bit of a bizarre metric,

1:34:54.880 --> 1:34:57.640
 it makes perfect sense in the biological context.

1:34:57.640 --> 1:34:59.200
 So let's talk about balance

1:34:59.200 --> 1:35:01.680
 and how to get better at balancing.

1:35:01.680 --> 1:35:03.300
 The reason why we're talking about balance

1:35:03.300 --> 1:35:04.960
 and how to get better at balancing

1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:08.880
 in the episode about hearing is that all the goodies

1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:12.560
 that are going to allow you to do that are in your ears.

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:15.300
 And they're also in your brain,

1:35:15.300 --> 1:35:17.680
 but they're mostly in your ears.

1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:19.920
 So as you recall from the beginning of this episode,

1:35:19.920 --> 1:35:22.760
 you have two cochlea, cochleas,

1:35:22.760 --> 1:35:25.600
 that are one on each side of your head,

1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:27.760
 and that's a little spiral snail-shaped thing

1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:30.640
 that converts sound waves into electrical signals

1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:33.360
 that the rest of your brain can understand.

1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:34.680
 Right next to those,

1:35:34.680 --> 1:35:37.420
 you have what are called semicircular canals.

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:41.420
 The semicircular canals can be best visualized

1:35:41.420 --> 1:35:45.340
 as thinking about three hula hoops with marbles in them.

1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:48.320
 So imagine that you have a hula hoop

1:35:48.320 --> 1:35:51.400
 and it's not filled with marbles all the way around,

1:35:51.400 --> 1:35:54.520
 it's just got some marbles down there at the base.

1:35:54.520 --> 1:35:57.280
 Okay, so if you were to move that hula hoop around,

1:35:57.280 --> 1:35:58.320
 the marbles will move around.

1:35:58.320 --> 1:36:00.860
 Shoo, shoo, shoo, okay?

1:36:00.860 --> 1:36:01.960
 You've got three of those,

1:36:01.960 --> 1:36:04.760
 and each one of those hula hoops has these marbles

1:36:04.760 --> 1:36:05.820
 that can move around.

1:36:05.820 --> 1:36:10.780
 One of those hula hoops is positioned vertically

1:36:10.780 --> 1:36:12.760
 with respect to gravity.

1:36:12.760 --> 1:36:15.540
 So it's basically parallel to your nose.

1:36:15.540 --> 1:36:17.520
 It's like this, if you're watching on a video,

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:19.160
 but basically it's upright.

1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:21.440
 Another one of those hula hoops

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:26.440
 is basically at a 90-degree angle to your nose.

1:36:27.340 --> 1:36:29.740
 It's basically parallel to the floor

1:36:29.740 --> 1:36:33.660
 if you're standing upright now, if you're seated, okay?

1:36:33.660 --> 1:36:37.200
 And the other one is kind of tilted

1:36:37.200 --> 1:36:40.140
 about 45 degrees in between those.

1:36:40.140 --> 1:36:42.860
 Now, why is the system there?

1:36:42.860 --> 1:36:45.260
 Well, those marbles within each one of those hula hoops

1:36:45.260 --> 1:36:49.740
 can move around, but they'll only move around

1:36:49.740 --> 1:36:51.660
 if your head moves in a particular way.

1:36:51.660 --> 1:36:54.520
 And there are three planes or three ways

1:36:54.520 --> 1:36:56.300
 that your head can move.

1:36:56.300 --> 1:37:00.080
 Your head can move up and down, like I'm nodding right now.

1:37:00.080 --> 1:37:01.620
 So that's called pitch.

1:37:01.620 --> 1:37:05.700
 It's pitching forward or pitching back, okay?

1:37:05.700 --> 1:37:08.480
 So it's a nod, up and down.

1:37:08.480 --> 1:37:11.540
 Or I can shake my head no, side to side.

1:37:11.540 --> 1:37:12.900
 That's called yaw.

1:37:12.900 --> 1:37:15.980
 You pilots will be very familiar with this, yaw.

1:37:15.980 --> 1:37:18.260
 Not yawn, yaw.

1:37:18.260 --> 1:37:22.220
 And then there's roll, tilting the head from side to side,

1:37:22.220 --> 1:37:24.780
 the way that a cute puppy might look at you

1:37:24.780 --> 1:37:26.600
 from side to side, okay?

1:37:26.600 --> 1:37:29.500
 Where if somebody doesn't really understand

1:37:29.500 --> 1:37:30.660
 or believe what you're saying,

1:37:30.660 --> 1:37:34.220
 they might tilt their head, very common phenomenon.

1:37:34.220 --> 1:37:35.500
 I mean, nobody does that to me,

1:37:35.500 --> 1:37:37.640
 but they do that to each other.

1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:41.920
 So pitch, yaw, and roll are the movements of the head

1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:45.460
 in each of the three major planes of motion, as we say.

1:37:45.460 --> 1:37:49.720
 And each one of those causes those marbles to move

1:37:49.720 --> 1:37:54.460
 in one or two of the various hula hoops, okay?

1:37:54.460 --> 1:37:57.220
 So if I move my head up and down when I nod,

1:37:57.220 --> 1:38:00.040
 one of those hula hoops, literally right now,

1:38:00.040 --> 1:38:01.380
 the marbles are moving back and forth.

1:38:01.380 --> 1:38:03.180
 They aren't actually marbles, by the way.

1:38:03.180 --> 1:38:08.180
 These are little, kind of like little stones, basically,

1:38:08.300 --> 1:38:10.980
 little calcium-like deposits.

1:38:10.980 --> 1:38:13.780
 And when they roll back and forth,

1:38:13.780 --> 1:38:17.740
 they deflect little hairs, little hair cells

1:38:17.740 --> 1:38:18.900
 that aren't like the hair cells

1:38:18.900 --> 1:38:21.000
 that we use for measuring sound waves.

1:38:21.000 --> 1:38:24.540
 They're not too different, but they are different from them.

1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:27.020
 Not like the hairs on our heads,

1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:30.900
 but they're basically rolling past these little hair cells

1:38:30.900 --> 1:38:32.560
 and causing them to deflect.

1:38:32.560 --> 1:38:36.140
 And when they deflect downward, the neurons,

1:38:36.140 --> 1:38:37.300
 because hair cells are neurons,

1:38:37.300 --> 1:38:40.700
 send information up to the brain.

1:38:40.700 --> 1:38:42.460
 So if I move my head like this,

1:38:42.460 --> 1:38:45.540
 there's a physical movement of these little stones

1:38:45.540 --> 1:38:48.380
 in this hula hoop, as I'm referring to it,

1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:51.700
 but they deflect these hairs, send those hairs,

1:38:51.700 --> 1:38:53.420
 which are neurons, those hair cells,

1:38:53.420 --> 1:38:54.900
 send information off to the brain.

1:38:54.900 --> 1:38:56.620
 If I move my head from side to side,

1:38:56.620 --> 1:38:58.580
 different little stones move.

1:38:58.580 --> 1:39:00.860
 If I roll my head, different stones move.

1:39:00.860 --> 1:39:03.860
 This is an exquisite system that exists

1:39:03.860 --> 1:39:07.500
 in all animals that have a jaw.

1:39:07.500 --> 1:39:10.580
 So any fish that has a jaw has this system.

1:39:10.580 --> 1:39:12.260
 A puppy has this system.

1:39:12.260 --> 1:39:16.080
 Any animal that has a jaw has this so-called balance system,

1:39:16.080 --> 1:39:18.240
 which we call the vestibular system.

1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:20.080
 One of the more important things to know

1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:22.460
 about the vestibular, the balance system,

1:39:22.460 --> 1:39:26.460
 is that it works together with the visual system.

1:39:28.060 --> 1:39:30.020
 Let's say I hear something off to my left

1:39:30.020 --> 1:39:32.780
 and I swing my head over to the left to see what it is.

1:39:34.020 --> 1:39:35.700
 There are two sources of information

1:39:35.700 --> 1:39:38.060
 about where my head is relative to my body,

1:39:38.060 --> 1:39:39.940
 and I need to know that.

1:39:39.940 --> 1:39:43.900
 First of all, when I quickly move my head to the side,

1:39:43.900 --> 1:39:46.380
 those little stones, as I'm referring to them,

1:39:46.380 --> 1:39:47.740
 I realize they're not actually stones,

1:39:47.740 --> 1:39:49.420
 but as I'm referring to them,

1:39:49.420 --> 1:39:52.380
 they quickly activate those hair cells

1:39:52.380 --> 1:39:54.880
 in that one semicircular canal

1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:56.860
 and send a signal off to my brain

1:39:56.860 --> 1:39:58.720
 that my head just moved to the side like this.

1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:00.640
 Not that it went like this and pitched back,

1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:03.940
 or not that it tilted, but it just moved to the side.

1:40:03.940 --> 1:40:08.700
 But also, visual information slid past my field of view.

1:40:08.700 --> 1:40:09.720
 I didn't have to think about it,

1:40:09.720 --> 1:40:11.660
 but just slid past my field of view.

1:40:11.660 --> 1:40:14.300
 And when those two signals combine,

1:40:15.660 --> 1:40:18.580
 my eyes then lock to a particular location.

1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:21.220
 Now, if this is at all complicated,

1:40:21.220 --> 1:40:23.780
 you can actually uncouple these things.

1:40:23.780 --> 1:40:25.060
 It's very easy to do.

1:40:25.060 --> 1:40:26.180
 You can do this right now.

1:40:26.180 --> 1:40:27.860
 In fact, I'd like you to do this experiment

1:40:27.860 --> 1:40:29.580
 if you're not already doing something else

1:40:29.580 --> 1:40:30.780
 that requires your attention,

1:40:30.780 --> 1:40:33.660
 and certainly don't do this if you're driving.

1:40:33.660 --> 1:40:35.460
 You're going to sit down

1:40:35.460 --> 1:40:39.300
 and you're going to move your head to the left very slowly

1:40:40.540 --> 1:40:42.060
 with your eyes open.

1:40:42.060 --> 1:40:45.340
 So you're going to move it very, very slowly.

1:40:45.340 --> 1:40:47.420
 The whole thing should take about five, six,

1:40:47.420 --> 1:40:49.320
 maybe even 10 seconds to complete.

1:40:52.100 --> 1:40:53.700
 Okay, I just did it.

1:40:53.700 --> 1:40:54.940
 Now I'm going to do it very quickly.

1:40:54.940 --> 1:40:57.100
 I'd like you to do it very quickly as well.

1:40:58.320 --> 1:40:59.600
 Now do it slowly again.

1:41:03.940 --> 1:41:05.740
 Okay, what you probably noticed

1:41:05.740 --> 1:41:09.380
 is that it's very uncomfortable to do it slowly,

1:41:09.380 --> 1:41:12.020
 but you can do it very quickly

1:41:12.020 --> 1:41:13.340
 without much discomfort at all.

1:41:13.340 --> 1:41:14.940
 You just move your head to the side.

1:41:14.940 --> 1:41:18.780
 The reason is when you move your head very slowly,

1:41:18.780 --> 1:41:21.980
 those little stones at the base of that hula hoop,

1:41:21.980 --> 1:41:24.000
 they don't get enough momentum to move.

1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:28.180
 So you're actually not generating this signal to the brain

1:41:28.180 --> 1:41:29.200
 that your head is moving.

1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:32.500
 And what you'll notice is that your eyes have to go boom,

1:41:32.500 --> 1:41:35.300
 boom, boom, jumping over step by step.

1:41:35.300 --> 1:41:37.260
 Whereas if you move your head really quickly,

1:41:37.260 --> 1:41:39.220
 the signal gets off to your brain and your eyes just go,

1:41:39.220 --> 1:41:41.860
 boom, right to the location you want to look at.

1:41:41.860 --> 1:41:46.280
 So moving your body slowly is actually very disruptive

1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:48.940
 to the vestibular system.

1:41:48.940 --> 1:41:52.280
 And it's very disruptive to your visual system.

1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:54.580
 Now, if you've ever had the misfortune of being on a boat

1:41:54.580 --> 1:41:57.040
 and you're going through big oscillations on the boat,

1:41:57.040 --> 1:41:59.660
 for those of you folks that get seasick,

1:41:59.660 --> 1:42:01.460
 this can actually make certain people seasick

1:42:01.460 --> 1:42:02.760
 just to hear about it.

1:42:02.760 --> 1:42:05.680
 That was big oscillations going up and down

1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:07.000
 and up and down.

1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:08.740
 Those are very disruptive.

1:42:08.740 --> 1:42:09.980
 We'll talk about nausea in a minute

1:42:09.980 --> 1:42:12.060
 and how to offset that kind of nausea.

1:42:12.060 --> 1:42:12.980
 I get pretty seasick,

1:42:12.980 --> 1:42:16.140
 but there are ways that you can deal with this.

1:42:16.140 --> 1:42:18.180
 But this is incredible because what it means

1:42:18.180 --> 1:42:20.460
 is it's a purely physical system of these little stones

1:42:20.460 --> 1:42:22.020
 rolling around in there

1:42:22.020 --> 1:42:24.920
 and directing where your eyes should go, okay?

1:42:24.920 --> 1:42:27.140
 So you can do this also just by looking up.

1:42:27.140 --> 1:42:29.200
 So let's just say you're sitting in a chair.

1:42:29.200 --> 1:42:30.980
 You're going to look up towards the ceiling

1:42:30.980 --> 1:42:32.300
 and your eyes will just go there.

1:42:32.300 --> 1:42:34.180
 You're doing this eyes open and you look down.

1:42:34.180 --> 1:42:41.180
 Now try doing it really, really slowly.

1:42:41.980 --> 1:42:44.260
 Some people even get motion sick doing this,

1:42:44.260 --> 1:42:46.900
 which if you do, then just stop, okay?

1:42:46.900 --> 1:42:49.080
 So you can do this also to the side,

1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:50.500
 although it works best if you're moving your head

1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:55.320
 from side to side or nodding up and down.

1:42:55.320 --> 1:42:56.420
 So what we're doing here

1:42:56.420 --> 1:42:58.300
 is we're uncoupling these two mechanisms.

1:42:58.300 --> 1:43:00.020
 We're pulling them apart, the visual part

1:43:00.020 --> 1:43:02.300
 and the vestibular part, just to illustrate to you

1:43:02.300 --> 1:43:06.740
 that normally these mechanisms in your inner ear

1:43:06.740 --> 1:43:09.000
 tell your eyes where to go,

1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:12.540
 but as well, your eyes tell your balance system,

1:43:12.540 --> 1:43:15.420
 your vestibular system, how to function.

1:43:15.420 --> 1:43:18.020
 So I'd like you to do a different experiment.

1:43:18.020 --> 1:43:21.520
 I'm not going to do it right now, but basically stand up.

1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:22.360
 If you get the opportunity,

1:43:22.360 --> 1:43:23.780
 you can do this safely wherever you are.

1:43:23.780 --> 1:43:25.100
 You're going to stand up

1:43:25.100 --> 1:43:27.980
 and you're going to look forward about 10, 12 feet.

1:43:27.980 --> 1:43:31.500
 Pick a point on a wall or you can, anywhere that you like.

1:43:31.500 --> 1:43:33.660
 If you're out in public, just do it anyway.

1:43:33.660 --> 1:43:36.740
 Just tell them you're listening to Huberman Lab Podcast

1:43:36.740 --> 1:43:38.900
 and someone's telling you to do it.

1:43:38.900 --> 1:43:40.260
 Anyway, if you don't want to do it, don't do it,

1:43:40.260 --> 1:43:41.500
 but basically do it.

1:43:41.500 --> 1:43:45.120
 Stand on one leg and lift up the other leg.

1:43:45.120 --> 1:43:46.620
 You can bend your knee if you like,

1:43:46.620 --> 1:43:50.340
 and just look off into the distance about 10, 12 feet.

1:43:51.500 --> 1:43:53.540
 If you can do that, if you can stand on one leg,

1:43:53.540 --> 1:43:54.740
 now close your eyes.

1:43:55.780 --> 1:43:58.180
 Chances are you're going to suddenly feel

1:43:58.180 --> 1:44:00.360
 what scientists call postural sway.

1:44:00.360 --> 1:44:02.480
 You're going to start swaying around a lot.

1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:06.500
 It is very hard to balance with your eyes closed.

1:44:06.500 --> 1:44:07.820
 You might think, well, and if you think about that,

1:44:07.820 --> 1:44:09.100
 it's like, why is that?

1:44:09.100 --> 1:44:10.060
 That's crazy.

1:44:10.060 --> 1:44:11.900
 Why would it be that it's hard to balance

1:44:11.900 --> 1:44:12.740
 with your eyes closed?

1:44:12.740 --> 1:44:15.780
 Well, information about the visual world

1:44:15.780 --> 1:44:18.740
 also feeds back onto this vestibular system.

1:44:18.740 --> 1:44:20.740
 So the vestibular system informs your vision

1:44:20.740 --> 1:44:22.300
 and tells you where to move your eyes,

1:44:22.300 --> 1:44:24.060
 and your eyes and their positioning

1:44:24.060 --> 1:44:26.980
 tell your balance system, your vestibular system,

1:44:26.980 --> 1:44:28.660
 how it should function.

1:44:28.660 --> 1:44:31.020
 So there's a really cool way

1:44:31.020 --> 1:44:33.700
 that you can learn to optimize balance.

1:44:33.700 --> 1:44:34.800
 You're not going to try and do this

1:44:34.800 --> 1:44:37.300
 by learning to balance with your eyes closed.

1:44:37.300 --> 1:44:41.040
 What you can do is you can raise one leg,

1:44:41.040 --> 1:44:43.000
 and you can look at a short distance,

1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:45.240
 maybe off to just the distance that your thumb would be

1:44:45.240 --> 1:44:46.700
 if you were to reach your arm out in front of you,

1:44:46.700 --> 1:44:48.560
 although you don't necessarily have to put your thumb

1:44:48.560 --> 1:44:49.400
 in front of you.

1:44:49.400 --> 1:44:51.540
 So maybe just about two feet in front of you.

1:44:51.540 --> 1:44:52.680
 Then while still balancing,

1:44:52.680 --> 1:44:56.220
 you're going to step your vision out a further distance,

1:44:56.220 --> 1:44:57.420
 and then a further distance,

1:44:57.420 --> 1:44:58.820
 and as far as you can possibly see

1:44:58.820 --> 1:45:00.540
 in the environment that you're in.

1:45:00.540 --> 1:45:03.220
 And then you're going to march it back to you.

1:45:03.220 --> 1:45:05.540
 Now, what the literature shows

1:45:05.540 --> 1:45:07.560
 is that this kind of balance training

1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:10.580
 where you incorporate the visual system

1:45:10.580 --> 1:45:14.140
 and extending out and then marching back in,

1:45:14.140 --> 1:45:16.900
 the point at which you direct your visual focus,

1:45:16.900 --> 1:45:20.460
 sends robust information about the relationship

1:45:20.460 --> 1:45:24.100
 between your visual world and your balance system.

1:45:24.100 --> 1:45:25.460
 And of course, the balance system includes

1:45:25.460 --> 1:45:28.540
 not just these hula hoops, these semicircular canals,

1:45:28.540 --> 1:45:30.420
 but they communicate with the cerebellum,

1:45:30.420 --> 1:45:32.900
 the so-called mini brain actually means mini brain

1:45:32.900 --> 1:45:33.900
 in the back of your brain,

1:45:33.900 --> 1:45:35.420
 combines that with visual information

1:45:35.420 --> 1:45:37.520
 and your map of the body surface.

1:45:39.100 --> 1:45:44.100
 That pattern of training is very beneficial

1:45:44.500 --> 1:45:47.300
 for enhancing your ability to balance

1:45:47.300 --> 1:45:50.100
 because the ability to balance is in part

1:45:50.100 --> 1:45:53.300
 the activation of particular postural muscles,

1:45:53.300 --> 1:45:57.220
 but just as much, perhaps even more so,

1:45:57.220 --> 1:46:02.220
 it's about being able to adjust those postural muscles,

1:46:02.340 --> 1:46:03.700
 excuse me, it's about the ability

1:46:03.700 --> 1:46:05.620
 to adjust those postural muscles

1:46:05.620 --> 1:46:08.900
 as you experience changes in your visual world.

1:46:08.900 --> 1:46:12.180
 And one of the most robust ways that you can engage changes

1:46:12.180 --> 1:46:15.140
 in your visual world is through your own movement.

1:46:15.140 --> 1:46:19.280
 And so most people are not trying to balance in place.

1:46:19.280 --> 1:46:20.540
 They're not just trying to stand there

1:46:20.540 --> 1:46:22.260
 like a statue on one leg.

1:46:22.260 --> 1:46:24.180
 Most of what we think about when we think about balance

1:46:24.180 --> 1:46:26.760
 is for sake of sport or dynamic balance,

1:46:26.760 --> 1:46:28.100
 of being able to break ourselves

1:46:28.100 --> 1:46:30.820
 and when we're lunging in one particular direction

1:46:30.820 --> 1:46:32.180
 to stop ourselves, that is,

1:46:32.180 --> 1:46:33.900
 and then to move in another direction

1:46:33.900 --> 1:46:36.700
 or for skateboarding or surfing or cycling

1:46:36.700 --> 1:46:39.160
 or any number of different things, gymnastics.

1:46:39.160 --> 1:46:41.940
 So the visual system is the primary input

1:46:41.940 --> 1:46:43.340
 by which you develop balance,

1:46:43.340 --> 1:46:46.460
 but you can't do it just with the visual system.

1:46:46.460 --> 1:46:49.300
 So what I'm recommending is if you're interested

1:46:49.300 --> 1:46:50.700
 in cultivating a sense of balance,

1:46:50.700 --> 1:46:52.260
 understand the relationship between

1:46:52.260 --> 1:46:54.440
 these semicircular canals.

1:46:54.440 --> 1:46:58.820
 Understand that they are both driving eye movements

1:46:58.820 --> 1:47:01.100
 and they are driven by eye movements.

1:47:01.100 --> 1:47:03.060
 It's a reciprocal relationship.

1:47:03.060 --> 1:47:06.500
 And then even just two or three minutes a day

1:47:06.500 --> 1:47:10.020
 or every once in a while, even three times a week,

1:47:10.020 --> 1:47:13.500
 maybe five minutes, maybe 10 minutes, you pick.

1:47:13.500 --> 1:47:14.820
 But if you want to enhance balance,

1:47:14.820 --> 1:47:18.860
 you have to combine changes in your visual environment

1:47:18.860 --> 1:47:21.180
 with a static posture, standing on one leg

1:47:21.180 --> 1:47:23.600
 and shifting your visual environment

1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:28.600
 or static visual view, looking at one thing

1:47:29.420 --> 1:47:32.640
 and changing your body posture, okay?

1:47:32.640 --> 1:47:34.160
 So those two things we now know

1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:37.040
 from the scientific literature combine

1:47:37.040 --> 1:47:39.020
 in order to give an enhanced sense of balance.

1:47:39.020 --> 1:47:42.620
 And there's a really nice paper that was published in 2015

1:47:42.620 --> 1:47:45.540
 called Effects of Balance Training on Balance Performance.

1:47:45.540 --> 1:47:47.940
 This was in Healthy Adults.

1:47:47.940 --> 1:47:51.000
 It's a systematic review and a meta-analysis.

1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.480
 A meta-analysis is when you combine a lot of literature

1:47:53.480 --> 1:47:54.660
 from a lot of different papers

1:47:54.660 --> 1:47:56.640
 and extract the really robust

1:47:56.640 --> 1:47:59.300
 and the less robust statistical effects.

1:47:59.300 --> 1:48:02.080
 So it's a really nice paper as well.

1:48:02.080 --> 1:48:04.740
 There are some papers out there, for instance,

1:48:04.740 --> 1:48:06.760
 a comparison of static balance

1:48:06.760 --> 1:48:09.340
 and the role of vision in the elite athletes.

1:48:09.340 --> 1:48:11.540
 This is essentially the paper that I've extracted

1:48:11.540 --> 1:48:14.540
 most of the information that I just gave you from.

1:48:14.540 --> 1:48:18.220
 And that paper, and there are some others as well,

1:48:18.220 --> 1:48:19.820
 but basically I distilled them down

1:48:19.820 --> 1:48:20.820
 into their core components.

1:48:20.820 --> 1:48:23.900
 The core components are move your vision around

1:48:23.900 --> 1:48:26.860
 while staying static still,

1:48:26.860 --> 1:48:29.340
 but in a balanced position like standing on one leg.

1:48:29.340 --> 1:48:30.620
 Could be something more complicated

1:48:30.620 --> 1:48:33.460
 if you're somebody who can do more complicated movements.

1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:37.160
 Unilateral movements seem to be important.

1:48:37.160 --> 1:48:40.400
 So standing on one leg as opposed to both, right?

1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:43.420
 Or trying to generate some tilt

1:48:43.420 --> 1:48:45.420
 is another way to go about it or imbalance,

1:48:45.420 --> 1:48:48.100
 meaning one limb asymmetrically being activated

1:48:48.100 --> 1:48:49.800
 compared to the other limb.

1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:54.420
 And then the other way to encourage or to cultivate

1:48:54.420 --> 1:48:56.700
 and build up this vestibular system

1:48:56.700 --> 1:48:57.960
 and your sense of balance

1:48:57.960 --> 1:49:01.420
 actually involves movement itself, acceleration.

1:49:01.420 --> 1:49:03.440
 So that's what we're going to talk about now.

1:49:03.440 --> 1:49:05.320
 So up until now, I've been talking about balance

1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:06.700
 only in the static sense,

1:49:06.700 --> 1:49:08.440
 like standing on one leg, for instance,

1:49:08.440 --> 1:49:11.060
 but that's a very artificial situation.

1:49:11.060 --> 1:49:13.160
 Even though you can train balance that way,

1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:15.820
 most people who want to enhance their sense of balance

1:49:15.820 --> 1:49:18.780
 for sport or dance or some other endeavor

1:49:18.780 --> 1:49:21.500
 want to engage balance in a dynamic way,

1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:24.180
 meaning moving through lots of different planes of movement,

1:49:24.180 --> 1:49:26.860
 maybe even sometimes while squatting down low

1:49:26.860 --> 1:49:28.160
 or jumping and landing

1:49:28.160 --> 1:49:31.360
 or making trajectories that are different angles.

1:49:32.700 --> 1:49:35.980
 For that, we need to consider that the vestibular system

1:49:36.860 --> 1:49:39.540
 also cares about acceleration.

1:49:39.540 --> 1:49:40.960
 So it cares about head position,

1:49:40.960 --> 1:49:42.620
 it cares about eye position

1:49:42.620 --> 1:49:44.700
 and where the eyes are and where you're looking,

1:49:44.700 --> 1:49:47.860
 but it also cares about what direction you're moving

1:49:47.860 --> 1:49:49.380
 and how fast.

1:49:49.380 --> 1:49:52.420
 And one of the best things that you can do

1:49:52.420 --> 1:49:54.860
 to enhance your sense of balance

1:49:54.860 --> 1:49:59.400
 is to start to bring together your visual system,

1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:02.300
 the semicircular canals of the inner ear,

1:50:02.300 --> 1:50:05.060
 and what we call linear acceleration.

1:50:05.060 --> 1:50:08.880
 So if I move forward in space rigidly upright,

1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:11.000
 it's a vastly different situation

1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:13.220
 than if I'm leaning to the side.

1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:19.160
 One of the best ways to cultivate a better sense of balance,

1:50:19.160 --> 1:50:23.000
 literally, within the sense organs and the neurons

1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:24.920
 and the biology of the brain

1:50:25.900 --> 1:50:30.660
 is to get into modes where we are accelerating forward,

1:50:30.660 --> 1:50:31.940
 typically it's forward,

1:50:31.940 --> 1:50:35.640
 while also tilted with respect to gravity.

1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:38.500
 Now, this would be the carve on a skateboard

1:50:38.500 --> 1:50:40.720
 or on a surfboard or a snowboard.

1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:44.240
 This would be the taking a corner on a bike

1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:46.780
 while being able to lean safely, of course,

1:50:46.780 --> 1:50:50.480
 lean into the turn so that your head is actually tilted

1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:52.840
 with respect to the earth.

1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:55.740
 So anytime that we are rigidly upright,

1:50:55.740 --> 1:51:00.420
 we aren't really exercising the vestibular system and balance.

1:51:00.420 --> 1:51:03.120
 This is why, you know, you see people in the gym on these,

1:51:03.120 --> 1:51:05.260
 what are those Bonshi balls, Bonshi balls?

1:51:05.260 --> 1:51:07.460
 Bonshi ball's the one that the guys roll in the park, right?

1:51:07.460 --> 1:51:09.480
 Bonshi balls where they're balancing back and forth.

1:51:09.480 --> 1:51:11.920
 That will work the small stabilizing muscles.

1:51:11.920 --> 1:51:13.840
 But what I'm talking about is getting into modes

1:51:13.840 --> 1:51:17.240
 where you actually tilt the body and the head

1:51:17.240 --> 1:51:19.420
 with respect to earth.

1:51:20.540 --> 1:51:24.080
 What I mean is with respect to earth's gravitational pull.

1:51:24.080 --> 1:51:27.320
 Now, the cerebellum is a very interesting structure

1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:29.800
 because not only is it involved in balance,

1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:33.040
 but it's also involved in skill learning

1:51:33.040 --> 1:51:35.940
 and in generating timing of movements.

1:51:35.940 --> 1:51:39.020
 It's a fascinating structure deserving of an entire episode

1:51:39.020 --> 1:51:41.760
 or several episodes all on its own.

1:51:41.760 --> 1:51:44.960
 But some of the outputs of the cerebellum,

1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:47.800
 meaning the neurons in the cell cerebellum get inputs,

1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:50.480
 but they also send information out.

1:51:50.480 --> 1:51:53.400
 The outputs of the cerebellum are strongly linked

1:51:53.400 --> 1:51:56.520
 to areas of the brain that release neuromodulators

1:51:56.520 --> 1:51:58.880
 that make us feel really good,

1:51:58.880 --> 1:52:01.320
 in particular, serotonin and dopamine.

1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:05.020
 And this is an early emerging subfield within neuroscience,

1:52:05.020 --> 1:52:07.880
 but a lot of what are called the non-motor outputs

1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:11.200
 of the cerebellum have a profound influence,

1:52:11.200 --> 1:52:15.640
 not just on our ability to learn how to balance better,

1:52:15.640 --> 1:52:18.420
 but also how we feel overall.

1:52:18.420 --> 1:52:20.740
 So for you exercisers out there,

1:52:20.740 --> 1:52:22.200
 I do hope people are getting

1:52:22.200 --> 1:52:23.900
 regular healthy amounts of exercise.

1:52:23.900 --> 1:52:26.560
 We've talked about what that means in previous episodes.

1:52:26.560 --> 1:52:29.080
 So at least 150 minutes a week of endurance work,

1:52:29.080 --> 1:52:31.800
 some strength training, a minimum of five sets per body part

1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:33.320
 to maintain musculature.

1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:34.880
 Even if you don't want to grow muscles,

1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:36.440
 you want to do that in order to maintain

1:52:36.440 --> 1:52:39.440
 healthy strength and bones, et cetera.

1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:40.380
 If you're doing that,

1:52:40.380 --> 1:52:43.860
 but you're only doing things like curls in the gym,

1:52:43.860 --> 1:52:46.000
 squats in the gym, riding the Peloton,

1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:47.440
 or even if you're outside running

1:52:47.440 --> 1:52:49.440
 and you're getting forward acceleration,

1:52:49.440 --> 1:52:51.240
 but you're never actually getting tilted, right?

1:52:51.240 --> 1:52:52.800
 You're never actually getting tilted

1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:56.400
 with respect to Earth's gravitational pull.

1:52:56.400 --> 1:52:58.560
 You're not really exercising

1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:03.200
 and getting the most out of your nervous system.

1:53:03.200 --> 1:53:07.840
 Activation of the cerebellum in this way of being tilted

1:53:07.840 --> 1:53:09.880
 or the head being tilted and the body being tilted

1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:12.960
 while in acceleration, typically forward acceleration,

1:53:12.960 --> 1:53:14.920
 but sometimes side to side,

1:53:14.920 --> 1:53:18.280
 has a profound and positive effect

1:53:18.280 --> 1:53:20.240
 on our sense of mood and wellbeing.

1:53:20.240 --> 1:53:22.840
 And as I talked about in a previous episode,

1:53:22.840 --> 1:53:26.180
 it can also enhance our ability to learn information

1:53:26.180 --> 1:53:29.600
 in the period after generating those tilts

1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:31.360
 and the acceleration.

1:53:31.360 --> 1:53:33.800
 And that's because the cerebellum has these outputs

1:53:33.800 --> 1:53:34.840
 to these areas of the brain

1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:36.460
 that release these neuromodulators

1:53:36.460 --> 1:53:38.760
 like serotonin and dopamine,

1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:41.440
 and they make us feel really good.

1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:44.160
 I think this is one of the reasons why growing up,

1:53:44.160 --> 1:53:46.740
 I had some friends, some of whom might've been

1:53:47.580 --> 1:53:50.240
 the world heavyweight champions of laziness

1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:52.160
 for essentially everything,

1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:55.080
 except they would wake up at 4.30 in the morning

1:53:55.080 --> 1:53:56.320
 to go surf.

1:53:56.320 --> 1:54:00.080
 They would drive, they would get up so early to go surf.

1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:02.400
 It's not just surfers, and some surfers, by the way,

1:54:02.400 --> 1:54:04.680
 I should point out are not lazy humans.

1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:06.040
 They do a lot of other things,

1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:08.940
 but I knew people that couldn't be motivated to do anything,

1:54:08.940 --> 1:54:13.120
 but they were highly driven to get into these experiences

1:54:13.120 --> 1:54:15.200
 of forward acceleration while tilted

1:54:15.200 --> 1:54:16.580
 with respect to gravity.

1:54:16.580 --> 1:54:21.120
 Likewise with snowboarding or skiing or cycling,

1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:25.800
 those modes of exercise seem to have an outsized effect

1:54:25.800 --> 1:54:28.380
 both on our wellbeing and our ability

1:54:28.380 --> 1:54:31.860
 to translate the vestibular balance

1:54:31.860 --> 1:54:33.640
 that we achieve in those endeavors

1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:37.120
 to our ability to balance while doing other things.

1:54:37.120 --> 1:54:39.680
 So, and I don't mean psychological balance necessarily,

1:54:39.680 --> 1:54:41.540
 I mean physical balance.

1:54:41.540 --> 1:54:43.440
 So for those of you that don't think of yourselves

1:54:43.440 --> 1:54:46.960
 as very coordinated or with very good balance,

1:54:46.960 --> 1:54:49.000
 getting into these modes of acceleration,

1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:51.720
 forward movement or lateral movement while getting tilted,

1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:54.220
 even if you have to do it slowly, could be beneficial,

1:54:54.220 --> 1:54:56.560
 I do believe, and the scientific literature points

1:54:56.560 --> 1:54:58.700
 to the fact that it will be beneficial

1:54:58.700 --> 1:55:02.500
 for cultivating better sense of physical balance.

1:55:02.500 --> 1:55:04.440
 It can really build up the circuits

1:55:04.440 --> 1:55:06.280
 of this vestibular system.

1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:08.800
 And then of course the feel-good components

1:55:08.800 --> 1:55:11.320
 of acceleration while tilted

1:55:11.320 --> 1:55:13.620
 or while getting the head into different orientations

1:55:13.620 --> 1:55:16.200
 relative to gravity.

1:55:16.200 --> 1:55:18.740
 Well, that's the explanation for roller coasters.

1:55:18.740 --> 1:55:20.040
 Some people hate roller coasters,

1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:21.960
 they make them feel nauseous.

1:55:21.960 --> 1:55:24.840
 Many people love roller coasters.

1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:26.720
 And one of the reasons they love roller coasters

1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:30.280
 is because of the way that when you get the body,

1:55:30.280 --> 1:55:31.880
 even if you're not generating the movement,

1:55:31.880 --> 1:55:34.000
 you get the body into forward acceleration

1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.480
 and you're going upside down and tilted to the side

1:55:36.480 --> 1:55:39.240
 as the tracks go from side to side and tilt, et cetera,

1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.800
 you're getting activation of these deeper brain nuclei

1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:45.280
 that trigger the release of neuromodulators

1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:47.200
 that just make us feel really, really good.

1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:50.360
 In fact, some people get a long arc, a long duration

1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:53.080
 kind of buzz from having gone through those experiences.

1:55:53.080 --> 1:55:54.760
 Some people who hate roller coasters

1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:57.960
 are probably getting nauseous just hearing about that.

1:55:57.960 --> 1:56:01.740
 So I encourage people to get into modes of acceleration

1:56:01.740 --> 1:56:03.280
 while tilted every once in a while,

1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:04.660
 provided you can do it safely.

1:56:04.660 --> 1:56:08.560
 It's an immensely powerful way to build up your skills

1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:10.120
 in the realm of balance.

1:56:10.120 --> 1:56:14.020
 And it's also, for most people, very, very pleasing.

1:56:14.020 --> 1:56:16.600
 It feels really good because of the chemical relationship

1:56:16.600 --> 1:56:21.200
 between forward acceleration and head tilt and body tilt.

1:56:21.200 --> 1:56:25.640
 Now, speaking of feeling nauseous, some people suffer

1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:28.840
 from vertigo, some people feel dizzy,

1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:30.240
 some people get lightheaded.

1:56:31.360 --> 1:56:33.900
 An important question to ask yourself always

1:56:33.900 --> 1:56:36.940
 if you're feeling quote unquote dizzy or lightheaded is,

1:56:36.940 --> 1:56:39.620
 are you dizzy or are you lightheaded?

1:56:39.620 --> 1:56:41.720
 Now, we're not going to diagnose anything here

1:56:41.720 --> 1:56:43.420
 because there's just no way we can do that.

1:56:43.420 --> 1:56:45.300
 This is essentially me shouting into a tunnel

1:56:45.300 --> 1:56:46.800
 so we don't know what's going on

1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:48.240
 with each and every one of you.

1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:51.940
 But if ever you feel that your world is spinning,

1:56:53.140 --> 1:56:56.520
 but that you can focus on your thumb, for instance,

1:56:56.520 --> 1:56:58.560
 but the rest of the world is spinning

1:56:58.560 --> 1:57:01.920
 and your thumb is stationary, that's called being dizzy.

1:57:02.760 --> 1:57:05.160
 Now, if you feel like you're falling

1:57:05.160 --> 1:57:07.960
 or that you feel like you need to get down onto the ground

1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:12.080
 because you feel lightheaded, that's being lightheaded.

1:57:12.080 --> 1:57:14.320
 And oftentimes with language, we don't distinguish

1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:16.580
 between being dizzy and being lightheaded.

1:57:16.580 --> 1:57:19.160
 Now, there are a lot of ways that dizziness

1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:21.000
 and lightheadedness can occur.

1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:22.440
 And I don't even want to begin to guess

1:57:22.440 --> 1:57:24.820
 at the number of different things and ways

1:57:24.820 --> 1:57:26.740
 that it could happen for those of you that suffer from it

1:57:26.740 --> 1:57:28.920
 because it could be any number of them.

1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:31.920
 But oftentimes if people are lightheaded,

1:57:31.920 --> 1:57:33.200
 yes, it could be low blood sugar.

1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:35.820
 It could also be that you're dehydrated.

1:57:35.820 --> 1:57:38.720
 It could also be that you are low in electrolytes.

1:57:38.720 --> 1:57:40.680
 We talked about this in a previous episode,

1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:43.280
 but we will talk about it more in a future episode.

1:57:43.280 --> 1:57:46.920
 Many people have too little sodium in their system, salt,

1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:49.360
 and that's why they feel lightheaded.

1:57:49.360 --> 1:57:51.240
 I have family members who for years

1:57:51.240 --> 1:57:53.800
 thought they had disrupted blood sugar.

1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:56.960
 They would get shaky, jittery, lightheaded,

1:57:56.960 --> 1:57:59.160
 feel like they were nauseous, et cetera.

1:57:59.160 --> 1:58:02.160
 And simply the addition of a little sea salt

1:58:02.160 --> 1:58:04.320
 to their water remedied the problem entirely.

1:58:04.320 --> 1:58:06.680
 I don't think it's going to remedy every issue

1:58:06.680 --> 1:58:08.940
 of lightheadedness out there by any stretch,

1:58:08.940 --> 1:58:12.040
 but just the addition of salt in this particular case

1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:14.600
 helped the person and they are not alone.

1:58:14.600 --> 1:58:16.440
 Many people would think that they have low blood sugar

1:58:16.440 --> 1:58:19.640
 actually are lightheaded because of low electrolytes

1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:22.920
 and because of the way that salt carries water

1:58:22.920 --> 1:58:26.800
 into the system and creates changes in blood volume, et cetera

1:58:26.800 --> 1:58:30.480
 low sodium can often be a source of lightheadedness

1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:33.440
 as can low blood sugar and of course other things as well.

1:58:33.440 --> 1:58:36.000
 Now for dizziness or seasickness,

1:58:36.000 --> 1:58:38.880
 we were all taught that you need to pick a point

1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:41.700
 on the horizon and focus on it.

1:58:41.700 --> 1:58:44.280
 But actually that's not correct.

1:58:45.760 --> 1:58:49.460
 It is true that if you are down in the cabin of a boat

1:58:49.460 --> 1:58:51.140
 or you're on the lower deck

1:58:51.140 --> 1:58:53.780
 and all you can see are things up close to you

1:58:54.760 --> 1:58:57.360
 that getting sloshed around like so

1:58:57.360 --> 1:58:59.840
 or the boat going up and down like so,

1:58:59.840 --> 1:59:00.860
 I think I'm getting a little seasick

1:59:00.860 --> 1:59:02.660
 even as I do this and I describe it.

1:59:06.200 --> 1:59:09.120
 Focusing on things close to you can be problematic.

1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:12.400
 And in that case, the advice to go up on deck

1:59:12.400 --> 1:59:15.900
 and get fresh air and to look off into the horizon,

1:59:15.900 --> 1:59:17.600
 that part is correct.

1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:20.000
 But focusing your eyes on a particular location

1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:23.080
 on the horizon is effectively like trying

1:59:23.080 --> 1:59:26.260
 to move very slowly as I had you do before

1:59:26.260 --> 1:59:28.240
 where you're trying to move your head very slowly

1:59:28.240 --> 1:59:30.500
 while fixating on one location.

1:59:30.500 --> 1:59:31.920
 Your eyes and your balance system

1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:33.920
 were designed to move together.

1:59:33.920 --> 1:59:36.800
 So really what you want to do is allow your visual system

1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:40.220
 to track with your vestibular system.

1:59:40.220 --> 1:59:43.420
 This is why sitting in the back of an Uber or a taxi

1:59:43.420 --> 1:59:45.300
 and being on your phone

1:59:45.300 --> 1:59:47.700
 can make you suddenly feel very nauseous.

1:59:47.700 --> 1:59:49.700
 Sometimes the cabs, particularly in New York City,

1:59:49.700 --> 1:59:51.000
 they have a lot of occluders.

1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:53.160
 They have a lot of stuff blocking your field of view.

1:59:53.160 --> 1:59:54.860
 There's usually a little portal out

1:59:54.860 --> 1:59:59.240
 that where you can see out to the front windshield,

1:59:59.240 --> 2:00:00.280
 but there's all this stuff now.

2:00:00.280 --> 2:00:01.800
 Television's in the back seat

2:00:01.800 --> 2:00:04.120
 and you're watching that television and the cab is moving.

2:00:04.120 --> 2:00:06.300
 You're in linear acceleration

2:00:06.300 --> 2:00:09.000
 and sometimes you're taking corners, you're braking.

2:00:09.000 --> 2:00:11.680
 So then your vestibular system has to adjust to that.

2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:14.520
 If you're looking at your phone or a book,

2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:16.960
 or even if you're talking to somebody,

2:00:16.960 --> 2:00:19.140
 actually, I'm starting to feel a little nauseous.

2:00:19.140 --> 2:00:20.880
 I promise I'm not going to finish this episode

2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:23.860
 by vomiting at the end, at least not here.

2:00:23.860 --> 2:00:28.120
 But what can happen is that you're uncoupling

2:00:28.120 --> 2:00:31.100
 the visual information from your motion,

2:00:31.100 --> 2:00:32.860
 from your vestibular information.

2:00:32.860 --> 2:00:34.160
 You want those to be coupled.

2:00:34.160 --> 2:00:36.920
 This is why a lot of people have to drive.

2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:38.400
 They can't be in the passenger seat

2:00:38.400 --> 2:00:39.240
 because when you drive,

2:00:39.240 --> 2:00:41.480
 you also get what's called proprioceptive feedback.

2:00:41.480 --> 2:00:44.920
 Your body is sending signals also to the vestibular system

2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:46.880
 about where you are in space.

2:00:46.880 --> 2:00:48.080
 When you're the passenger,

2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:51.120
 you're just getting jolted around as the person is driving.

2:00:51.120 --> 2:00:53.320
 And if you're looking at your phone, it's even worse.

2:00:53.320 --> 2:00:54.660
 And if you're looking at the occluder

2:00:54.660 --> 2:00:58.680
 between you and the two front seats, that's even worse.

2:00:58.680 --> 2:01:01.360
 So this is why staring out the front windshield is great,

2:01:01.360 --> 2:01:03.280
 but you don't want to fixate, okay?

2:01:03.280 --> 2:01:05.880
 So hopefully I spared a few people

2:01:05.880 --> 2:01:07.560
 and hopefully a few cab drivers

2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:10.300
 of having people get sick in their cars or Ubers.

2:01:11.300 --> 2:01:12.360
 Let your visual system

2:01:12.360 --> 2:01:15.320
 and your vestibular system work together.

2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:17.720
 If appropriate, get into linear acceleration

2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:20.800
 and you'll improve your sense of balance.

2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:22.760
 Once again, we've covered a tremendous amount

2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:24.300
 of information.

2:01:24.300 --> 2:01:25.940
 Now you know how you hear,

2:01:25.940 --> 2:01:29.560
 how you make sense of the sounds in your environment,

2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:31.160
 how those come into your ears

2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:33.400
 and how your brain processes them.

2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:35.080
 In addition, we talked about things

2:01:35.080 --> 2:01:38.100
 like low-level white noise and even binaural beats,

2:01:38.100 --> 2:01:40.740
 which can be used to enhance certain brain states,

2:01:40.740 --> 2:01:44.160
 certain rhythms within the brain and even dopamine release

2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:46.800
 in ways that allow you to learn better.

2:01:46.800 --> 2:01:48.480
 And we talked about the balance system

2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:50.280
 and this incredible relationship

2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:52.940
 between your vestibular apparatus,

2:01:52.940 --> 2:01:55.160
 meaning the portions of your inner ear

2:01:55.160 --> 2:01:56.520
 that are responsible for balance

2:01:56.520 --> 2:01:59.560
 and your visual system and gravity.

2:01:59.560 --> 2:02:02.780
 And you can use those to enhance your learning as well,

2:02:02.780 --> 2:02:05.640
 as well as just to enhance your sense of balance.

2:02:05.640 --> 2:02:07.360

 During this episode, I mentioned some supplements.

2:02:32.100 --> 2:02:33.200
 We partnered with Thorne

2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:35.840
 because Thorne has the very highest levels of stringency

2:02:35.840 --> 2:02:38.280
 with respect to the quality of their ingredients

2:02:38.280 --> 2:02:41.280
 and accuracy about the amounts of those ingredients

2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:42.960
 contained within their products.

2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:45.480
 If you'd like to see the products that I take from Thorne,

2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:50.480
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:02:50.860 --> 2:02:54.800
 So that's thorne.com slash U slash Huberman

2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:56.760
 to see all the supplements that I take.

2:02:56.760 --> 2:02:57.600
 And if you do that,

2:02:57.600 --> 2:03:00.220
 you can get 20% off any of those supplements

2:03:00.220 --> 2:03:03.560
 or 20% off any of the supplements that Thorne makes.
