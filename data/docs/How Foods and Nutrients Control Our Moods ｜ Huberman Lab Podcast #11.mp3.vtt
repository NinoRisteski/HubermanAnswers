00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.920
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.920 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.360 --> 00:10.880
 My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:10.880 --> 00:13.920
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.920 --> 00:15.920
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.680
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.680 --> 00:19.480
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.480 --> 00:21.540
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.540 --> 00:23.560
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.560 --> 00:25.640
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.640 --> 00:27.400
 to the general public.

00:27.400 --> 00:28.560
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.560 --> 00:31.480
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.120
 Our first sponsor today is Theragun.

00:34.120 --> 00:36.800
 Theragun is a handheld percussive therapy device

00:36.800 --> 00:39.400
 that releases deep muscle tension.

00:39.400 --> 00:42.040
 I was first introduced to Theragun in 2017

00:42.040 --> 00:44.160
 while on a laboratory expedition.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.800
 We were in the middle of the Pacific Ocean

00:45.800 --> 00:48.000
 filming great white sharks for my laboratory studies

00:48.000 --> 00:50.720
 on fear using virtual reality.

00:50.720 --> 00:52.880
 We were working very hard around the clock,

00:52.880 --> 00:54.360
 and I and other people on the trip

00:54.360 --> 00:55.900
 were picking up a lot of aches and pains,

00:55.900 --> 00:57.440
 and just kind of chronic soreness.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.680
 A couple of people had injuries that were flaring up

00:59.680 --> 01:02.500
 because of all the hard work and lack of sleep.

01:02.500 --> 01:03.960
 Someone had a Theragun,

01:03.960 --> 01:05.720
 and pretty soon it was getting passed around.

01:05.720 --> 01:07.740
 It became the most coveted device on board.

01:07.740 --> 01:08.800
 Everyone was using it to work

01:08.800 --> 01:10.440
 on these different sites of soreness.

01:10.440 --> 01:11.960
 And I really fell in love with the thing,

01:11.960 --> 01:13.560
 so much so that when I got back,

01:13.560 --> 01:15.040
 I immediately purchased one,

01:15.040 --> 01:17.720
 and I've used it almost daily ever since.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.240
 I use it on muscles that are sore.

01:20.240 --> 01:22.440
 I use it on areas that I'm really working on

01:22.440 --> 01:26.120
 to release tension and improve tissue quality, and so forth.

01:26.120 --> 01:28.180
 The great thing about Theragun is it's really quiet,

01:28.180 --> 01:30.360
 so you can use it while you're in a conversation

01:30.360 --> 01:31.600
 or while you're watching a movie,

01:31.600 --> 01:34.460
 and it doesn't disrupt those activities at all.

01:34.460 --> 01:36.400
 If you want to try Theragun,

01:36.400 --> 01:41.300
 you can try Theragun by going to theragun.com slash Huberman

01:41.300 --> 01:42.720
 to get your Gen 4 Theragun.

01:42.720 --> 01:45.440
 They start at $199,

01:45.440 --> 01:46.420
 but if you think about it,

01:46.420 --> 01:49.400
 a massage, which is an hour long or 90 minutes long,

01:49.400 --> 01:51.640
 is typically in that range of cost.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.440
 And this is something you can use every day

01:53.440 --> 01:54.480
 whenever you want,

01:54.480 --> 01:56.160
 and even while enjoying other activities.

01:56.160 --> 01:59.040
 So that's theragun.com slash Huberman.

01:59.040 --> 02:02.400
 The second sponsor of today's podcast is Inside Tracker.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.920
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

02:04.920 --> 02:07.740
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

02:07.740 --> 02:09.360
 to help you better understand your body

02:09.360 --> 02:11.660
 and help you reach your health goals.

02:11.660 --> 02:13.080
 The great thing about Inside Tracker

02:13.080 --> 02:15.940
 is that it gives you data that you can make sense of.

02:15.940 --> 02:19.200
 I've long been a believer in getting blood samples taken,

02:19.200 --> 02:20.040
 and more recently,

02:20.040 --> 02:22.700
 I've become a believer in getting DNA samples taken.

02:22.700 --> 02:24.760
 In order to understand what's going on at the level

02:24.760 --> 02:26.640
 of hormones, metabolic factors,

02:26.640 --> 02:28.980
 and other things that profoundly influence

02:28.980 --> 02:31.060
 our immediate and long-term health.

02:31.060 --> 02:33.440
 The problem always has been getting those samples taken

02:33.440 --> 02:35.640
 and making sense of those samples.

02:35.640 --> 02:38.160
 Inside Tracker makes all of that really easy.

02:38.160 --> 02:40.580
 They'll even come to your home to take the samples.

02:40.580 --> 02:42.200
 Then you get the information back,

02:42.200 --> 02:44.880
 and while typically, after getting information back,

02:44.880 --> 02:46.240
 there's these long list of numbers

02:46.240 --> 02:47.680
 and nobody knows what to do with them,

02:47.680 --> 02:49.200
 Inside Tracker makes it really easy

02:49.200 --> 02:51.400
 to interpret what those numbers mean,

02:51.400 --> 02:55.080
 and it points to things in terms of lifestyle,

02:55.080 --> 02:57.680
 exercise, nutrition, and so forth

02:57.680 --> 02:59.600
 that can help you adjust some of the numbers

02:59.600 --> 03:01.680
 that you might need to bring down or up

03:01.680 --> 03:04.340
 to put into the appropriate normal range.

03:04.340 --> 03:06.760
 So I find this whole process to be immensely valuable

03:06.760 --> 03:08.400
 for guiding my health choices,

03:08.400 --> 03:10.100
 and also just for giving me peace of mind

03:10.100 --> 03:12.880
 about how my body and the rest of my health

03:12.880 --> 03:14.240
 are doing internally,

03:14.240 --> 03:17.280
 something you just can't know without a blood and DNA test.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.240
 If you want to try Inside Tracker,

03:19.240 --> 03:22.400
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman,

03:22.400 --> 03:25.880
 and you'll get 25% off any of their programs.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.540
 You want to put Huberman at checkout,

03:27.540 --> 03:30.780
 so that's insidetracker.com slash Huberman

03:30.780 --> 03:33.640
 to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans

03:33.640 --> 03:35.640
 and put Huberman at checkout.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.720
 The third sponsor of today's podcast is Athletic Greens.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.300
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

03:40.300 --> 03:42.640
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.480
 I started using Athletic Greens in 2012,

03:45.480 --> 03:48.280
 so I'm delighted that they're a sponsor of the podcast.

03:48.280 --> 03:50.120
 The reason I started using Athletic Greens,

03:50.120 --> 03:53.100
 and the reason I still take it once or twice per day,

03:53.100 --> 03:55.720
 is that I find it very hard to know

03:55.720 --> 03:58.200
 what vitamins and minerals I need to take.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.840
 And by drinking Athletic Greens,

03:59.840 --> 04:03.440
 I get it all in one, easy to consume, great tasting formula.

04:03.440 --> 04:04.680
 I really do like the way it tastes.

04:04.680 --> 04:08.200
 I mix mine with water and a little bit of lemon or lime juice

04:08.200 --> 04:10.260
 and to me, it's delicious.

04:10.260 --> 04:11.920
 The other thing about Athletic Greens

04:11.920 --> 04:14.320
 that I really like are the probiotics.

04:14.320 --> 04:17.540
 There's so much data out there now telling us,

04:17.540 --> 04:20.460
 and I certainly believe based on the data that I've seen,

04:20.460 --> 04:22.220
 that probiotics are really important

04:22.220 --> 04:24.960
 for support of the gut microbiome,

04:24.960 --> 04:27.200
 the gut brain axis, the immune system,

04:27.200 --> 04:29.520
 and many other aspects of our biology.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.160
 So with Athletic Greens, I get the vitamins,

04:32.160 --> 04:34.680
 the minerals, and the probiotics that I need.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.280
 If you want to try Athletic Greens,

04:36.280 --> 04:39.720
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.200
 And if you do that,

04:41.200 --> 04:45.140
 they'll also give you a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

04:45.140 --> 04:48.400
 Vitamin D3, we also know is really important

04:48.400 --> 04:51.360
 for things like immune system and metabolic support.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.220
 So that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:54.220 --> 04:58.140
 to get Athletic Greens, the year supply of vitamin D3K2,

04:58.140 --> 05:00.560
 and they'll give you five free travel packs.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.320
 Today, we're talking all about emotions.

05:03.320 --> 05:07.000
 Emotions are central to our entire experience of life.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.040
 Whether or not we're happy or sad or depressed or angry

05:11.040 --> 05:13.240
 is our life experience.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.800
 And yet I think with all the importance

05:15.800 --> 05:17.140
 that we've placed on emotions,

05:17.140 --> 05:19.960
 very few people actually understand how emotions arise

05:19.960 --> 05:21.180
 in our brain and body.

05:21.180 --> 05:24.640
 And I mentioned brain and body because as you'll see today,

05:24.640 --> 05:28.280
 emotions really capture the brain-body relationship.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.300
 We cannot say that emotions arise

05:30.300 --> 05:31.720
 just from what happens in our head.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.840
 It also involves events, biological events,

05:34.840 --> 05:37.100
 chemical events within our body.

05:38.360 --> 05:40.440
 The other thing about emotions is that

05:40.440 --> 05:43.060
 there's no real agreement as to what's a good emotion

05:43.060 --> 05:44.880
 or a bad emotion.

05:44.880 --> 05:46.680
 Today, we're going to talk about the biology

05:46.680 --> 05:49.880
 of the chemicals and pathways that give rise to emotions.

05:49.880 --> 05:54.000
 And I'm going to equip you with several, if not many tools

05:54.000 --> 05:56.120
 that will allow you to regulate and change

05:56.120 --> 05:58.220
 and steer your emotions should you want,

05:58.220 --> 06:00.440
 but not using the typical advice.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.740
 Everyone's probably heard of this thing.

06:01.740 --> 06:04.480
 Oh, if you're feeling depressed, just smile.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.180
 It's impossible to be depressed while smiling.

06:07.180 --> 06:08.280
 Look, if that were true,

06:08.280 --> 06:09.820
 we wouldn't have any depressed people

06:09.820 --> 06:12.440
 because depressed people don't want to be depressed.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.280
 And it is not the case that simply smiling

06:15.280 --> 06:17.520
 will reverse depression or sadness.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.000
 And it's simply not the case

06:19.000 --> 06:22.640
 that smiling can inhibit sadness.

06:22.640 --> 06:24.380
 It just doesn't work that way.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.540
 However, it is the case that certain things

06:26.540 --> 06:27.800
 that are happening in our body

06:27.800 --> 06:30.020
 influence how our brain functions

06:30.020 --> 06:32.360
 and the chemicals that are released.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.440
 And today we're going to talk a lot

06:34.440 --> 06:36.360
 about how the brain and body interact

06:36.360 --> 06:38.480
 to create these things called emotions

06:38.480 --> 06:41.880
 in the context of food and nutrition.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.200
 And the reason we're doing that

06:43.200 --> 06:45.600
 is not because I'm beating the drum

06:45.600 --> 06:47.640
 about particular diet regimens or anything.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.960
 In fact, I'm not going to do any of that.

06:48.960 --> 06:51.080
 What I'm going to do is I'm going to review

06:51.080 --> 06:53.040
 some of the most important scientific data

06:53.040 --> 06:56.280
 that point to how ingesting certain nutrients,

06:56.280 --> 06:59.520
 both macronutrients like proteins, fats, and carbohydrates,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.800
 as well as micronutrients can impact the chemicals

07:02.800 --> 07:05.240
 in our brain that give rise to the feelings

07:05.240 --> 07:08.520
 of being happy or sad or sleepy

07:08.520 --> 07:10.880
 or alert when you want to be sleepy

07:10.880 --> 07:12.720
 or sleepy when you want to be alert.

07:12.720 --> 07:15.480
 So this is sure to be a broad discussion

07:15.480 --> 07:17.120
 and yet we're going to get very specific

07:17.120 --> 07:20.280
 about what emotions are, how they arise in the body,

07:20.280 --> 07:21.600
 tools that one can use

07:21.600 --> 07:24.620
 in order to better control their emotions,

07:24.620 --> 07:27.340
 tools that people can use to, believe it or not,

07:27.340 --> 07:29.980
 feel happier or feel calmer.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.880
 And that's because in the last 20 years or so,

07:32.880 --> 07:35.560
 there's been an explosion of scientific studies

07:35.560 --> 07:38.040
 exploring how the brain and body interact

07:38.040 --> 07:40.520
 to support certain neurochemicals

07:40.520 --> 07:43.880
 that give us these feelings of being alert and happy

07:43.880 --> 07:47.580
 or depressed or certain that our life is going to be terrible

07:47.580 --> 07:49.760
 or certain that our life is going to be great.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.620
 So as mysterious as all that might sound

07:51.620 --> 07:53.040
 and confusing as all that might sound,

07:53.040 --> 07:54.820
 we're going to make it very clear today.

07:54.820 --> 07:56.820
 And you're going to come away from this conversation

07:56.820 --> 08:01.500
 with a lot of tools that you can act on immediately.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.880
 And those tools are grounded in scientific data.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.000
 We are going to provide links to several of the studies.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.400
 And I'm going to mention several of those studies

08:08.400 --> 08:10.020
 as we go along.

08:10.020 --> 08:12.880
 But overall, the goal today is for you to understand

08:12.880 --> 08:14.960
 how moods and emotions arise

08:14.960 --> 08:16.880
 and the different pathways in your brain and body

08:16.880 --> 08:18.160
 that allow them to happen

08:18.160 --> 08:21.520
 and how you can use those pathways to change those emotions

08:21.520 --> 08:26.480
 and the tools that you can rely on in very specific ways

08:26.480 --> 08:28.440
 to shift from being, say,

08:28.440 --> 08:30.240
 slightly depressed to feeling happier.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.320
 There actually are ways to do that,

08:32.320 --> 08:35.480
 or from feeling too alert and anxious to feeling calmer.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.700
 And these are tools that are distinct

08:36.700 --> 08:39.660
 from the tools I've talked about in previous episodes.

08:39.660 --> 08:43.260
 The discussion around emotions has a long and rich history

08:43.260 --> 08:46.580
 going back to Darwin and even long before Darwin.

08:46.580 --> 08:49.240
 This is a conversation that philosophers and scientists

08:49.240 --> 08:52.740
 have been having for hundreds, if not thousands of years.

08:54.220 --> 08:55.960
 The idea that Darwin put forth

08:55.960 --> 08:59.080
 and that was really attractive for about the last 100 years

08:59.080 --> 09:01.640
 was that emotions are universal

09:01.640 --> 09:03.160
 and that some of the facial expressions

09:03.160 --> 09:04.840
 around emotion are universal.

09:04.840 --> 09:08.520
 And other people have capitalized on that idea.

09:08.520 --> 09:10.160
 And to some extent, it's true.

09:10.160 --> 09:14.920
 I mean, I think that the two most robust examples of that

09:14.920 --> 09:19.400
 would be when we see something or we smell something

09:19.400 --> 09:21.240
 or we taste something that we like,

09:21.240 --> 09:24.620
 there does tend to be a postural leaning in.

09:24.620 --> 09:27.080
 We tend to inhale air at that time.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.680
 We tend to bring in more

09:28.680 --> 09:30.420
 of whatever chemical substance is there.

09:30.420 --> 09:33.760
 So we tend to do these mmm and kind of lean in closer

09:33.760 --> 09:35.760
 to things that are attractive to us.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.280
 And when we see and experience things

09:38.280 --> 09:41.860
 that we don't like, sometimes it's a mild aversion.

09:41.860 --> 09:43.600
 We just kind of lean back or look away.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.720
 Other times it's an intensive version of disgust

09:46.720 --> 09:48.340
 and we tend to cringe our face.

09:48.340 --> 09:50.720
 We tend to avoid inhaling any of the chemicals.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.860
 This probably has roots in ancient biological mechanisms

09:54.860 --> 09:57.540
 that are to prevent us from ingesting things

09:57.540 --> 09:59.560
 that are bad for us, chemical compounds

09:59.560 --> 10:01.440
 and tastes that might be poisonous.

10:01.440 --> 10:05.740
 So much of the foundation of any discussion about emotion

10:05.740 --> 10:07.920
 has to center around this kind of push-pull

10:07.920 --> 10:11.680
 of attraction to things or aversion from things.

10:11.680 --> 10:14.560
 Now that's a very basic way of thinking about emotions.

10:14.560 --> 10:15.720
 But if you think about it,

10:15.720 --> 10:17.920
 it works for a lot of different circumstances.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.080
 And in the brain,

10:19.080 --> 10:21.280
 everywhere from the deep circuits of the brain

10:21.280 --> 10:23.440
 to the more kind of what we call higher order

10:23.440 --> 10:25.040
 evolved centers of the brain,

10:25.040 --> 10:27.240
 we have this push-pull thing.

10:27.240 --> 10:29.840
 We're either, in a previous episode I talked about GO,

10:29.840 --> 10:33.440
 the circuits that allow you to emphasize action

10:33.440 --> 10:35.500
 and then no-go circuits,

10:35.500 --> 10:36.880
 the circuits in the basal ganglia

10:36.880 --> 10:40.300
 that allow you to de-emphasize action and prevent action.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.080
 We talked about how that's a push-pull.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.880
 So aversion and attraction is a push-pull too.

10:44.880 --> 10:47.400
 Delight or happiness or excitement

10:47.400 --> 10:50.520
 are attractions to certain things and ideas,

10:50.520 --> 10:53.520
 songs, people, places, foods.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.440
 Aversion is a leaning out.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.180
 It's a disgust, it's an avoidance.

10:58.180 --> 11:01.520
 And so we can break down the discussion about emotions

11:01.520 --> 11:04.520
 into these simpler versions of themselves.

11:04.520 --> 11:08.520
 But at the core of that, of attraction or aversion

11:08.520 --> 11:11.900
 is an important theme that you might realize already

11:11.900 --> 11:13.760
 but most people tend to overlook,

11:13.760 --> 11:16.160
 which is that there's an action there.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.700
 You're either moving forward

11:17.700 --> 11:19.840
 or you're moving away from something.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.640
 And anytime you're talking about action

11:21.640 --> 11:22.880
 in the nervous system,

11:22.880 --> 11:24.820
 you're talking about motor behaviors.

11:24.820 --> 11:27.680
 You're talking about literally the contraction of muscles

11:27.680 --> 11:29.600
 to move you toward or away from things.

11:29.600 --> 11:34.200
 And anytime you're talking about nerve to muscle and action,

11:34.200 --> 11:36.760
 you're talking about the brain and the body

11:36.760 --> 11:39.600
 because the brain can't move itself.

11:39.600 --> 11:43.560
 The brain has a body so that the organism can move.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.280
 And the body has a brain so that the organism, you,

11:47.280 --> 11:49.100
 can move toward or away from things

11:49.100 --> 11:51.380
 that you deem to be good or bad for you.

11:51.380 --> 11:53.320
 Now, some of these things that we're attracted to

11:53.320 --> 11:54.840
 and some of them that we avoid

11:54.840 --> 11:57.560
 are what we call innate or hardwired.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.900
 When we taste bitter compounds,

12:00.900 --> 12:01.760
 I'm not saying about bitter,

12:01.760 --> 12:04.260
 like you like a little bit of bitters in your drink

12:04.260 --> 12:06.380
 or something like that, but really bitter compounds,

12:06.380 --> 12:07.420
 we tend to avoid those

12:07.420 --> 12:09.480
 because they're associated with poisons.

12:09.480 --> 12:12.960
 When we taste things that are sweet or that are savory,

12:12.960 --> 12:15.700
 we tend to pursue more of those.

12:15.700 --> 12:18.120
 We tend to lean toward those, so to speak.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.100
 And we tend to not avoid them.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.720
 So there are circuits in the brain for aversion

12:22.720 --> 12:24.600
 and for attraction toward things.

12:24.600 --> 12:27.200
 And the body is governing a lot of that.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.160
 And so immediately in this conversation,

12:29.160 --> 12:31.320
 I want to raise an important point,

12:31.320 --> 12:33.600
 which is about a nerve pathway

12:33.600 --> 12:35.720
 that many, many people have heard of

12:35.720 --> 12:37.200
 that gets discussed all the time.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.320
 And that is one of the most kind of oversold

12:40.320 --> 12:42.680
 for the wrong reasons and undersold,

12:42.680 --> 12:46.840
 unfortunately for its real power, which is the vagus nerve.

12:46.840 --> 12:50.540
 So the vagus nerve is one, not the only,

12:50.540 --> 12:53.440
 but one way in which our brain and body are connected

12:53.440 --> 12:56.880
 and regulates our emotional states.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.520
 Now, many of you have probably heard about polyvagal theory.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.000
 I'm going to talk about this today.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.280
 Polyvagal theory was popularized by Stephen Porges.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.600
 And it's an interesting theory.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.480
 Certain aspects of it, frankly, hold up to the science.

13:10.480 --> 13:11.800
 Some of it doesn't.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.760
 And I'm going to discuss all of that today.

13:14.760 --> 13:18.040
 A lot of the vagus and the excitement about the vagus,

13:18.040 --> 13:23.040
 V-A-G-U-S, is because it somehow got into the mind

13:23.220 --> 13:27.140
 of the public that the vagus is involved in calming us down.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.560
 So what is the vagus nerve?

13:28.560 --> 13:30.920
 Okay, we're going to make this really simple.

13:30.920 --> 13:33.240
 In particular, for those that are just listening,

13:33.240 --> 13:34.280
 you can just imagine this.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.560
 For those of you that are watching,

13:35.560 --> 13:36.800
 I'll point to the various areas.

13:36.800 --> 13:40.840
 But basically, the vagus is the 10th cranial nerve,

13:40.840 --> 13:43.040
 which basically means that the neurons,

13:43.040 --> 13:46.660
 the control center of each of those neurons in the vagus

13:46.660 --> 13:50.080
 lives just kind of near the neck, right?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.560
 And a branch of the vagus goes into the brain.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.180
 They send a little wire into the brain.

13:54.180 --> 13:56.240
 The other branch goes into the periphery,

13:56.240 --> 13:57.920
 but not just the gut.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.700
 It goes into the stomach, the intestines, the heart,

14:00.700 --> 14:02.640
 the lungs, and the immune system.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.700
 So this vagus nerve is incredible

14:04.700 --> 14:07.080
 because it's taking information from the body

14:07.080 --> 14:08.320
 and it has two directions.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.200
 The first is what we call sensory.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.400
 So it's sensing things that are happening

14:12.400 --> 14:13.880
 in the gut, in the lungs.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.620
 Everything, for example, in the lungs,

14:15.620 --> 14:17.640
 when our lungs are distended,

14:17.640 --> 14:20.160
 the vagus nerve senses that

14:20.160 --> 14:22.600
 and sends that information up into the brain.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.540
 It also can sense things in the gut,

14:24.540 --> 14:27.900
 like how distended or empty your stomach happens to be.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.280
 It can sense heart rate.

14:30.280 --> 14:31.920
 It can sense your immune system,

14:31.920 --> 14:33.340
 whether or not you have bacteria

14:33.340 --> 14:35.580
 or things invading you in your body.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.520
 So it sends that information up to the brain.

14:37.520 --> 14:38.480
 So it's a two-way street

14:38.480 --> 14:40.740
 and sensory information is going up to the brain.

14:40.740 --> 14:42.480
 That's all vagus.

14:42.480 --> 14:43.400
 So it's like a super highway,

14:43.400 --> 14:44.840
 sensory information going one way.

14:44.840 --> 14:48.120
 And then the other direction is motor control.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.160
 So the vagus is not just for sensing things,

14:50.160 --> 14:51.520
 it's actually for controlling things.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.000
 It's got a sensory pathway and a motor pathway.

14:54.860 --> 14:57.120
 So that's the first thing I think everyone should know

14:57.120 --> 14:58.000
 about the vagus.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.560
 In fact, it's so important

15:00.560 --> 15:03.160
 that I feel like this is as important as people knowing

15:03.160 --> 15:05.800
 that walking involves flexors and extensors.

15:05.800 --> 15:07.380
 And if you don't think that's important,

15:07.380 --> 15:09.280
 it's as important as walking frankly,

15:09.280 --> 15:11.840
 because the vagus is the way in which you can govern

15:11.840 --> 15:13.620
 the brain-body connection

15:13.620 --> 15:16.600
 and in which you can steer various aspects

15:16.600 --> 15:17.760
 of your mood and wellbeing.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.200
 But most people just don't understand how to use it.

15:20.200 --> 15:21.920
 So first you got to understand what it is.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.260
 So you've got sensory information

15:23.260 --> 15:25.240
 coming from all these different organs of the body

15:25.240 --> 15:26.080
 up to the brain.

15:26.080 --> 15:28.080
 You got motor information going from the brain

15:28.080 --> 15:29.120
 back to the body.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.520
 And so you've got this super highway within you.

15:31.520 --> 15:34.080
 Now what actually regulates the vagus?

15:34.080 --> 15:36.080
 Oftentimes you'll hear things like,

15:36.080 --> 15:39.200
 oh, this particular behavior,

15:39.200 --> 15:41.880
 rubbing your face at a particular location

15:41.880 --> 15:44.120
 or breathing in a particular way,

15:44.120 --> 15:48.560
 or a warm bath or something stimulates the vagus.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.260
 Well, right now I want everyone to know that quote unquote,

15:51.260 --> 15:53.640
 stimulating the vagus broadly speaking

15:53.640 --> 15:55.920
 is a terrible way to think about the vagus.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.400
 Because did you know what?

15:57.400 --> 16:00.260
 If you have a contaminant inside your body,

16:00.260 --> 16:02.200
 the vagus senses that

16:02.200 --> 16:04.320
 and projects that information to your brain

16:04.320 --> 16:06.600
 and you start to generate a fever.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.980
 You start to try and kill that contaminant in your body.

16:09.980 --> 16:12.120
 So I don't know that you want to stimulate the vagus

16:12.120 --> 16:13.460
 just as like a general theme.

16:13.460 --> 16:14.920
 Today we're going to get specific

16:14.920 --> 16:18.200
 about how you can activate particular circuits,

16:18.200 --> 16:21.180
 certain pathways from certain organs to the brain

16:21.180 --> 16:24.680
 in order to feel better or relieve certain conditions.

16:24.680 --> 16:28.880
 But you certainly don't want to just stimulate the vagus.

16:28.880 --> 16:31.340
 Now, excitement about the vagus in part

16:31.340 --> 16:34.680
 is because of what quite honestly

16:34.680 --> 16:37.760
 was a fairly pioneering theory about the vagus,

16:37.760 --> 16:39.320
 which is this polyvagal theory.

16:39.320 --> 16:42.120
 So polyvagal, the word poly means many,

16:42.120 --> 16:45.280
 is cool because it acknowledges

16:45.280 --> 16:48.160
 that the vagus has a lot of different branches.

16:48.160 --> 16:49.760
 It's not just one thing.

16:49.760 --> 16:51.120
 And so I really like that.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.100
 I like the naming polyvagal.

16:53.100 --> 16:54.980
 The idea that Portis put forward was that

16:54.980 --> 16:56.840
 there's a dorsal vagus,

16:56.840 --> 16:59.200
 which is kind of runs the back of the spinal cord,

16:59.200 --> 17:01.520
 which is involved in alertness and activation

17:01.520 --> 17:03.560
 and kind of fight or flight type stuff.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.600
 And that there's a ventral pathway

17:06.600 --> 17:10.380
 and that that's involved in more kind of empathic behaviors.

17:10.380 --> 17:14.480
 That is not quite in agreement with the modern anatomy,

17:14.480 --> 17:16.720
 but he was doing the best with what he had at the time.

17:16.720 --> 17:18.240
 So, okay.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.840
 The problem I have with the polyvagal theory

17:20.840 --> 17:22.680
 is the way that it's discussed.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.280
 People will often say, oh, you know,

17:24.280 --> 17:27.640
 if your dorsal vagus is too active,

17:27.640 --> 17:29.560
 then you tend to be someone who's a little too keyed up.

17:29.560 --> 17:32.420
 And people who are kind of in a state of freeze

17:32.420 --> 17:35.160
 or kind of flaccid and kind of, you know,

17:35.160 --> 17:39.960
 like just not really active and they're just lethargic.

17:39.960 --> 17:42.000
 Well, then that pathway is hypoactive.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.240
 It should be more active.

17:43.240 --> 17:44.600
 So there are a lot of theories

17:44.600 --> 17:46.680
 about how psychology maps onto the vagus

17:46.680 --> 17:50.340
 that as far as I know, don't map to any real physiology.

17:50.340 --> 17:53.760
 Now, the other problem with this kind of the way

17:53.760 --> 17:55.720
 that the polyvagal theory is discussed,

17:55.720 --> 17:58.160
 probably not by the real experts, but by a lot of people

17:58.160 --> 18:02.240
 is that people start to diagnose different psychological

18:02.240 --> 18:05.760
 and physical manifestations through the vagus.

18:05.760 --> 18:07.080
 They would say things like, oh, you know,

18:07.080 --> 18:10.080
 this person is hyper-flexible at the joints

18:10.080 --> 18:13.020
 and therefore their dorsal vagus isn't active enough

18:13.020 --> 18:14.120
 or something like that.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.080
 And it's really kind of gone way outside the lane lines.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.280
 So today we're going to clean up a lot of that.

18:19.280 --> 18:20.480
 Let's make it really simple

18:20.480 --> 18:22.160
 about how the vagus actually works

18:22.160 --> 18:26.040
 at least as we understand it today in 2021.

18:26.040 --> 18:29.360
 First of all, as I mentioned, you have sensory information.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.440
 The same way that you detect light with your eyes

18:31.440 --> 18:33.460
 or you hear sounds with your ears,

18:33.460 --> 18:36.760
 you have sensors in your gut that sense how full

18:36.760 --> 18:38.600
 or empty your gut is.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.520
 It can also sense how acidic your gut is.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.620
 It can sense various things within your gut.

18:44.620 --> 18:45.740
 Your heart is doing the same.

18:45.740 --> 18:47.800
 It's informing the brain how fast your heart is beating,

18:47.800 --> 18:50.040
 how full your lungs are has been communicated,

18:50.040 --> 18:52.060
 and then the status of your immune system.

18:52.060 --> 18:54.740
 So the way to think about the vagus

18:54.740 --> 18:56.840
 is the same way I would think about the eyes.

18:56.840 --> 18:58.720
 The eyes are looking at colors.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.780
 They're looking at motion.

18:59.780 --> 19:01.240
 They're looking at how bright it is.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.980
 And each one of those things, those features,

19:03.980 --> 19:05.320
 is telling the brain something different

19:05.320 --> 19:07.680
 so the brain can decide when to be awake or asleep,

19:07.680 --> 19:10.320
 whether or not it's looking at somebody attractive

19:10.320 --> 19:11.680
 or unattractive.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.840
 The vagus nerve is also analyzing many features

19:14.840 --> 19:17.320
 within the body and informing the brain

19:17.320 --> 19:20.880
 of how to feel about that and what to do.

19:20.880 --> 19:24.220
 So a really good example that I think is an exciting one

19:24.220 --> 19:26.920
 is as it relates to sugar.

19:26.920 --> 19:30.360
 So we all know that sweet things generally taste good.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.440
 I'm not particularly a fan of very sweet things.

19:33.440 --> 19:38.440
 I'd much rather have cheese or pizza or hamburger or steak.

19:38.440 --> 19:41.320
 I like savory fatty foods, but I do like sweet foods.

19:41.320 --> 19:45.000
 And most people find sweet foods to be attractive.

19:45.000 --> 19:45.840
 They want them.

19:45.840 --> 19:48.480
 They might, or they might not be able

19:48.480 --> 19:51.520
 to regulate their behavior around them, but they want them.

19:51.520 --> 19:54.940
 And what's really interesting is that for hundreds of years,

19:54.940 --> 19:56.640
 people have thought that that's because of the way

19:56.640 --> 19:59.720
 that sweet foods taste.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.800
 So that makes sense, right?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.440
 You eat something, it tastes sweet, you want more of it.

20:03.440 --> 20:06.460
 Well, it turns out that it's much more interesting

20:06.460 --> 20:07.300
 than that.

20:07.300 --> 20:10.960
 When you eat something sweet, within your stomach,

20:10.960 --> 20:14.800
 you have cells, neurons, that sense the presence

20:14.800 --> 20:18.200
 of sugary foods independent of their taste

20:18.200 --> 20:19.720
 and signal to the brain.

20:19.720 --> 20:23.280
 So those sensors, those neurons send information

20:23.280 --> 20:25.120
 up the vagus to your brain,

20:25.120 --> 20:26.720
 goes through a series of stations,

20:26.720 --> 20:28.540
 and then you release dopamine,

20:28.540 --> 20:32.840
 this molecule that makes you want more of whatever it is

20:32.840 --> 20:34.380
 that you just ingested.

20:34.380 --> 20:37.440
 In fact, this pathway is so powerful

20:37.440 --> 20:40.640
 that they've done experiments where they completely numb

20:40.640 --> 20:43.640
 all the taste and feeling in somebody's mouth.

20:43.640 --> 20:45.440
 They're blindfolded so they don't know what they're eating.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.800
 And they're eating a food that's either sugary

20:47.800 --> 20:48.960
 or not sugary.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.600
 And what they find is that even though people can't taste

20:51.600 --> 20:55.200
 the sugary food, they crave more of the food

20:55.200 --> 20:59.000
 that contains sugar because of the sensors in the gut

20:59.000 --> 21:00.440
 that sense sugar.

21:00.440 --> 21:03.640
 So to put this differently, you actually have sensors

21:03.640 --> 21:08.120
 within your body that make you crave sugar independent

21:08.120 --> 21:10.240
 of the sweet taste of those things.

21:10.240 --> 21:11.560
 Now that's incredible.

21:11.560 --> 21:14.280
 And what it does and what it tells us is that we have

21:14.280 --> 21:16.800
 circuits in our body that are driving us

21:16.800 --> 21:20.200
 towards certain behaviors and making us feel good

21:20.200 --> 21:22.200
 even though we can't perceive them.

21:22.200 --> 21:23.920
 Now, for those of you that are really interested

21:23.920 --> 21:26.800
 in gut intuition and kind of gut feelings,

21:26.800 --> 21:28.160
 this is a gut feeling,

21:28.160 --> 21:30.280
 except this is a chemical gut feeling.

21:30.280 --> 21:34.600
 This is a particular set of neurons detecting that something

21:34.600 --> 21:37.640
 in your body has a particular feature, in this case,

21:37.640 --> 21:41.100
 the presence of sugars and sending information to the brain

21:41.100 --> 21:44.000
 to essentially to control your behavior.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.840
 And I find this remarkable because what it means

21:46.840 --> 21:49.360
 is that what we call attractive,

21:49.360 --> 21:52.120
 isn't always coming from our thoughts about that

21:52.120 --> 21:54.600
 or our feelings or even our perception.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.080
 We are drawn to particular foods and we're drawn to perhaps

21:58.080 --> 22:01.580
 also to particular people, places and other things

22:01.580 --> 22:04.880
 because of information that's coming from our body.

22:04.880 --> 22:07.120
 And we're gonna talk about what one can do

22:07.120 --> 22:07.980
 with this information.

22:07.980 --> 22:10.400
 I know many people are thoughtful or concerned

22:10.400 --> 22:12.220
 about sugars these days thinking,

22:12.220 --> 22:13.720
 we all ingest too much sugar,

22:13.720 --> 22:16.960
 there's sugar snuck into all the things we eat.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.160
 And indeed that's true.

22:18.160 --> 22:20.160
 I mean, this should completely reframe the way

22:20.160 --> 22:23.560
 that we think about the sort of so-called hidden sugars

22:23.560 --> 22:24.400
 in foods.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.760
 What this means is that even if a food is very savory

22:26.760 --> 22:29.680
 like a piece of pizza or a piece of bread

22:29.680 --> 22:32.480
 or even like a salad dressing,

22:32.480 --> 22:36.160
 if there's sugar snuck into that and you can't taste it,

22:36.160 --> 22:39.320
 you will still crave more of that thing

22:39.320 --> 22:42.560
 without knowing that you crave it because it has sugar.

22:42.560 --> 22:44.520
 In other words, you might find yourself wanting

22:44.520 --> 22:47.540
 certain foods and not knowing why you want those foods.

22:47.540 --> 22:50.440
 So I find this to be a fascinating aspect of our biology.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.880
 And yes, it relates to mood and emotion.

22:52.880 --> 22:55.200
 And we'll talk about how that is in a moment.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.320
 So let's just back up a bit and ask the question,

22:58.320 --> 23:00.640
 why do we eat certain things?

23:00.640 --> 23:03.440
 And why do certain foods make us feel good

23:03.440 --> 23:06.040
 and other foods actually make us feel anxious?

23:06.040 --> 23:07.680
 I think some people may be familiar with this,

23:07.680 --> 23:09.060
 other people might not.

23:09.060 --> 23:13.700
 But most people don't realize that as you approach eating,

23:13.700 --> 23:16.240
 there's an anxiety associated with that.

23:16.240 --> 23:17.080
 It's an alertness.

23:17.080 --> 23:19.380
 Remember in the previous discussions,

23:19.380 --> 23:22.000
 or even if you don't and you haven't seen those,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.200
 all of your moods and feelings of wellbeing

23:24.200 --> 23:28.160
 are anchored on this continuum of alertness versus calmness.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.120
 And we hear so often about rest and digest,

23:31.120 --> 23:33.880
 that, oh, after we eat, we feel really nice and full,

23:33.880 --> 23:36.500
 hopefully comfortably full and not too full.

23:36.500 --> 23:40.240
 Then we're relaxing and we feel satiated.

23:40.240 --> 23:43.440
 It's associated with serotonin, this molecule of satiation.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.100
 That's all true.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.360
 But what most people don't know is that there's an area

23:47.360 --> 23:49.400
 of the hypothalamus, so deep in the brain,

23:49.400 --> 23:51.480
 kind of in the middle deep portion of the brain,

23:51.480 --> 23:53.640
 called the lateral hypothalamus.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.180
 And the lateral hypothalamus is really interesting

23:56.180 --> 24:00.540
 because it controls feeding, but it inhibits feeding.

24:00.540 --> 24:02.940
 It stops us from feeding.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.120
 And there's another area in the brain,

24:05.120 --> 24:06.480
 if you want names, I'll give them to you.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.120
 If you don't want names, just ignore them,

24:08.120 --> 24:10.740
 delete them from your memory and awareness,

24:10.740 --> 24:12.120
 called the locus coeruleus.

24:12.120 --> 24:15.200
 Now the locus coeruleus sits back further in the brainstem

24:15.200 --> 24:16.640
 and it releases norepinephrine,

24:16.640 --> 24:20.240
 which is essentially adrenaline and makes us feel alert.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.480
 Now locus coeruleus has a lot of different functions

24:22.480 --> 24:24.660
 in the brain, but when we are going to eat,

24:24.660 --> 24:26.000
 let's say we walk into a restaurant,

24:26.000 --> 24:28.960
 we sit down or we're preparing a meal,

24:28.960 --> 24:31.460
 locus coeruleus is known to release

24:31.460 --> 24:33.080
 noradrenaline in the brain.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.160
 It's creating a kind of alertness.

24:35.160 --> 24:39.320
 This has ancient utility, but it's creating this alertness.

24:39.320 --> 24:42.100
 And for many people, they experience that

24:42.100 --> 24:45.060
 as they approach food as stress, as anxiety.

24:45.060 --> 24:48.800
 But what's interesting is that as we approach food,

24:48.800 --> 24:52.040
 locus coeruleus is releasing all these molecules

24:52.040 --> 24:54.460
 that make us feel more anxious and alert.

24:54.460 --> 24:56.120
 Sometimes it's felt as excitement

24:56.120 --> 24:57.280
 and that has probably to do

24:57.280 --> 24:58.820
 with how we feel about food generally.

24:58.820 --> 25:00.800
 Are we happy with our relationship to food?

25:00.800 --> 25:02.840
 Are we trying to restrict our relationship to food?

25:02.840 --> 25:04.240
 Are people coming over for dinner?

25:04.240 --> 25:06.060
 All that will play in of course,

25:06.060 --> 25:08.880
 but there's a certain stress and anxiety

25:08.880 --> 25:10.880
 on approach to food.

25:10.880 --> 25:15.200
 And as we approach food and we feel that anxiety,

25:15.200 --> 25:19.160
 locus coeruleus activates the lateral hypothalamus

25:19.160 --> 25:21.640
 in a way that inhibits feeding,

25:21.640 --> 25:23.180
 that makes us not want to eat.

25:23.180 --> 25:26.040
 So a lot of people who have kind of pre-meal anxiety

25:26.040 --> 25:28.040
 or anxiety around food,

25:28.040 --> 25:30.560
 and they can't seem to just calm down and have a good meal

25:30.560 --> 25:33.200
 to access that later rest and digest.

25:33.200 --> 25:35.800
 A lot of that is because of this heightened stress

25:35.800 --> 25:37.160
 upon approach to food.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.680
 And a lot of the tools that are out there

25:39.680 --> 25:40.880
 both for eating disorders

25:40.880 --> 25:42.760
 and for just kind of the general public

25:42.760 --> 25:44.560
 who isn't suffering from eating disorders,

25:44.560 --> 25:48.160
 things like mindfulness around meals,

25:48.160 --> 25:50.480
 they always tell you, you should never eat when stressed.

25:50.480 --> 25:52.160
 I'm sorry, but my life is not organized

25:52.160 --> 25:53.400
 in a way that I can't do that.

25:53.400 --> 25:54.700
 I would never eat, right?

25:54.700 --> 25:56.160
 Because I eat when I'm awake

25:56.160 --> 25:59.840
 and I don't know if I'm stressed, but I don't think I am,

25:59.840 --> 26:02.260
 but I tend to run around a lot during the day.

26:02.260 --> 26:05.760
 I don't generally take time to do two or three deep breaths

26:05.760 --> 26:08.320
 before I eat, I generally will eat.

26:09.560 --> 26:10.840
 That can be healthy or unhealthy

26:10.840 --> 26:13.140
 depending on the quality of your digestion.

26:13.140 --> 26:15.680
 I think using digestion as a guide is good.

26:15.680 --> 26:19.720
 But a lot of people aren't aware that this interaction

26:19.720 --> 26:21.860
 between locus coeruleus and lateral hypothalamus

26:21.860 --> 26:24.920
 is a basic mechanism where we are supposed to get

26:24.920 --> 26:27.800
 a little bit alert and anxious around mealtime.

26:27.800 --> 26:31.400
 And then as we eat, the mechanisms for calming

26:31.400 --> 26:33.760
 and satiation are supposed to kick in.

26:33.760 --> 26:35.560
 And those mechanisms involve,

26:35.560 --> 26:37.020
 as I mentioned earlier, two things.

26:37.020 --> 26:38.400
 One is how things taste.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.240
 Digestion starts in the mouth, of course.

26:41.240 --> 26:43.120
 We taste our food.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.080
 Everyone tells us we should chew our food more.

26:45.080 --> 26:46.440
 Yes, that can improve digestion.

26:46.440 --> 26:48.600
 We're not supposed to drink too many fluids as we eat.

26:48.600 --> 26:49.920
 That's true too.

26:49.920 --> 26:54.920
 But a lot of how we feel while we eat and after we eat

26:54.920 --> 26:59.920
 is because of this vagus sensing of what's in our gut.

27:00.420 --> 27:02.880
 It's sending information all the time.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.640
 Is there sugar?

27:04.640 --> 27:06.180
 Are there fats?

27:06.180 --> 27:08.220
 Are there contaminants?

27:08.220 --> 27:09.620
 There are a lot of information,

27:09.620 --> 27:10.940
 these so-called parallel pathways

27:10.940 --> 27:12.180
 that are going up into our brain

27:12.180 --> 27:13.300
 that regulate whether or not

27:13.300 --> 27:15.380
 we want to eat more of something or not.

27:15.380 --> 27:16.840
 And there are accelerators,

27:16.840 --> 27:18.740
 things that make us want to eat more,

27:18.740 --> 27:22.380
 like sugar and fats, because those are nutrient dense

27:22.380 --> 27:24.620
 and they help generally, at least in the short term,

27:24.620 --> 27:29.100
 support the survival of animals, but also amino acids.

27:29.100 --> 27:31.520
 And this is very important.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.540
 There are a lot of data,

27:33.540 --> 27:38.500
 but much of what comes from the data on what people eat

27:38.500 --> 27:42.500
 and how much they eat is from a subconscious detection

27:42.500 --> 27:47.140
 of how many amino acids and what the array,

27:47.140 --> 27:50.660
 meaning the constellation of amino acids is in a given food.

27:50.660 --> 27:54.620
 And it's fair to say that the sum total of these studies

27:54.620 --> 27:58.140
 point in a direction where people will basically eat

27:58.140 --> 28:00.780
 not until their stomach is full,

28:00.780 --> 28:04.500
 but until the brain perceives

28:04.500 --> 28:07.860
 that they have adequate intake of amino acids.

28:07.860 --> 28:11.380
 Now, this is a conversation that comes up

28:11.380 --> 28:14.740
 in the context of the meat only, the keto,

28:14.740 --> 28:17.860
 the kind of zone diet, the Mediterranean diet,

28:17.860 --> 28:18.700
 the vegan diet.

28:18.700 --> 28:23.600
 I'm largely going to ignore the kind of strict camps today.

28:23.600 --> 28:25.100
 I will talk a little bit about it

28:25.100 --> 28:27.220
 because I think each one of them actually taps

28:27.220 --> 28:29.700
 into something important about this brain body relationship

28:29.700 --> 28:31.540
 that the other ones don't.

28:31.540 --> 28:33.220
 But I don't want to get into a discussion

28:33.220 --> 28:35.420
 about the ethics of different foods

28:35.420 --> 28:36.860
 of animal-based or non-animal-based,

28:36.860 --> 28:38.260
 because that's not the topic today.

28:38.260 --> 28:41.740
 It's really about nutrient sensing and amino acid sensing.

28:41.740 --> 28:45.820
 So we generally will eat until our gut tells our brain

28:45.820 --> 28:48.460
 that we have adequate amounts of these amino acids,

28:48.460 --> 28:50.300
 amino acids of course are important

28:50.300 --> 28:52.780
 because they are the building blocks of sure,

28:52.780 --> 28:56.500
 muscle and the other things in our body that need repair.

28:56.500 --> 29:00.460
 But what most people don't realize is that amino acids

29:00.460 --> 29:04.800
 are what the neurochemicals in the brain are made from.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.260
 Now this is vitally important, okay?

29:07.260 --> 29:10.060
 So we've heard dopamine is this molecule

29:10.060 --> 29:11.180
 that makes you feel good.

29:11.180 --> 29:13.780
 Actually dopamine is a molecule that makes you feel good.

29:13.780 --> 29:15.740
 It's released within the brain

29:15.740 --> 29:19.460
 and it does feel very good when you have dopamine release.

29:19.460 --> 29:22.720
 Dopamine release is caused by surprise, excitement,

29:22.720 --> 29:25.860
 events that you're looking forward to and that turn out well.

29:25.860 --> 29:28.380
 It is inhibited by events you're looking forward to

29:28.380 --> 29:29.840
 that don't work out.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.020
 When someone says they're going to call

29:31.020 --> 29:32.580
 that you're really, really excited to talk to

29:32.580 --> 29:33.540
 and then they don't.

29:33.540 --> 29:35.740
 Or you thought a movie was going to be really great

29:35.740 --> 29:36.580
 and it's not.

29:36.580 --> 29:38.400
 Or you expect a meal to be really delicious

29:38.400 --> 29:40.060
 and it's kind of eh.

29:40.060 --> 29:42.000
 And we actually, there's a name for that.

29:42.000 --> 29:44.260
 It's called reward prediction error.

29:44.260 --> 29:46.460
 So if, and you can actually use this

29:46.460 --> 29:48.140
 in the context of meals and plans

29:48.140 --> 29:50.180
 in a way that's very useful with yourself

29:50.180 --> 29:51.820
 and people you know.

29:51.820 --> 29:56.340
 Essentially, if you expect something to be really terrific,

29:57.200 --> 29:59.660
 it really does place a higher expectation

29:59.660 --> 30:01.080
 at the chemical level.

30:01.080 --> 30:03.600
 So if you don't get as much dopamine

30:03.600 --> 30:04.980
 as you're expecting from something,

30:04.980 --> 30:07.860
 so you hear about a really great restaurant

30:07.860 --> 30:08.900
 or a place that has a really,

30:08.900 --> 30:11.300
 in my case, I wouldn't call it an addiction.

30:11.300 --> 30:14.020
 I would call it more of an affliction for croissants.

30:14.020 --> 30:16.260
 The best vegetable, of course, is the croissant.

30:16.260 --> 30:18.180
 And I get really excited about the fact

30:18.180 --> 30:20.300
 that someone will tell me, oh, there's this place

30:20.300 --> 30:21.820
 and they have incredible croissants.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.780
 You got to go there.

30:22.780 --> 30:24.340
 So I get really excited and I'll go.

30:24.340 --> 30:25.880
 And just them telling me

30:25.880 --> 30:29.020
 that it's going to be really terrific raises an expectation,

30:29.020 --> 30:30.780
 a dopamine expectation.

30:30.780 --> 30:34.980
 And unless those croissants are amazing,

30:34.980 --> 30:37.420
 chances are I'm going to experience them

30:37.420 --> 30:40.300
 as less good, less satisfying.

30:40.300 --> 30:43.440
 I will truly release less dopamine

30:43.440 --> 30:45.000
 than I would had they just said,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.100
 oh yeah, I think that there are croissants down the street

30:47.100 --> 30:48.720
 or if I just tried one at random.

30:48.720 --> 30:51.260
 And that's because of this reward prediction error.

30:51.260 --> 30:54.660
 Your expectation of something releases dopamine

30:54.660 --> 30:58.060
 and the actual event releases dopamine.

30:58.060 --> 31:01.500
 And if the event related dopamine

31:01.500 --> 31:04.740
 does not exceed the expectation or at least match it,

31:04.740 --> 31:06.260
 there's a much higher tendency

31:06.260 --> 31:08.500
 that you won't pursue that thing again.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.140
 So dopamine is really powerful

31:10.140 --> 31:12.320
 and it's not just the molecule of reward.

31:12.320 --> 31:13.980
 It is the molecule of desire.

31:13.980 --> 31:16.100
 It's the molecule of wanting,

31:16.100 --> 31:18.420
 not just the molecule of having.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.300
 And a book,

31:19.300 --> 31:21.580
 since people often ask for book recommendations,

31:21.580 --> 31:23.740
 I don't know the author personally, but I love the book.

31:23.740 --> 31:25.340
 It's called The Molecule of More.

31:25.340 --> 31:26.700
 It's a terrific book.

31:26.700 --> 31:28.760
 I wish I had written it frankly,

31:28.760 --> 31:30.580
 but if you want to learn more about dopamine,

31:30.580 --> 31:31.640
 reward prediction error,

31:31.640 --> 31:33.940
 and how dopamine regulates various aspects

31:33.940 --> 31:35.820
 of your emotional and motivational life,

31:35.820 --> 31:37.000
 it's a terrific read.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.700
 Dopamine is what's going to lead us

31:41.700 --> 31:43.500
 to want to eat more of something

31:43.500 --> 31:45.140
 or to not want more of something

31:45.140 --> 31:48.140
 because dopamine really is about craving.

31:48.140 --> 31:51.120
 It's about motivation and it's about desire.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.180
 And as I mentioned,

31:52.180 --> 31:54.440
 these amino acid sensors in our gut

31:54.440 --> 31:56.780
 are detecting how many amino acids,

31:56.780 --> 31:59.300
 but they're also detecting which amino acids.

31:59.300 --> 32:02.600
 And there's a particular amino acid called L-tyrosine,

32:02.600 --> 32:03.920
 which comes from food.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.860
 You can look up online which foods contain L-tyrosine.

32:06.860 --> 32:07.700
 It is in meats.

32:07.700 --> 32:08.660
 It is in nuts.

32:08.660 --> 32:11.200
 It is also in some plant-based foods.

32:11.200 --> 32:16.200
 L-tyrosine is the precursor to a couple other molecules

32:16.760 --> 32:19.620
 like L-dopa, et cetera, that make dopamine.

32:19.620 --> 32:22.260
 And so there's a misconception out there

32:22.260 --> 32:25.380
 that most of the serotonin is in our gut

32:25.380 --> 32:27.460
 and most of the dopamine is in our gut

32:27.460 --> 32:29.900
 and therefore our mood is in our gut.

32:29.900 --> 32:32.060
 That's not quite the way it works.

32:32.060 --> 32:33.500
 We'll talk about serotonin in a moment,

32:33.500 --> 32:37.740
 but dopamine is synthesized from the amino acids

32:37.740 --> 32:38.900
 that you eat.

32:38.900 --> 32:42.200
 However, the dopamine neurons that give rise

32:42.200 --> 32:45.380
 to these feelings of good or wanting more

32:45.380 --> 32:48.640
 or desire and motivation, those reside in the brain.

32:48.640 --> 32:49.900
 So we don't want to get too confused.

32:49.900 --> 32:52.700
 We want to respect and honor the power of the gut

32:52.700 --> 32:54.140
 and this vagal pathway,

32:54.140 --> 32:55.740
 but it's really neurons within your brain

32:55.740 --> 32:58.660
 that drive the pursuit and decision-making.

32:58.660 --> 32:59.620
 So what does this mean?

32:59.620 --> 33:03.460
 Well, some people make too little dopamine.

33:03.460 --> 33:04.940
 Some people make so little dopamine

33:04.940 --> 33:07.300
 that they need prescription dopamine.

33:07.300 --> 33:08.260
 They need L-dopa.

33:08.260 --> 33:10.380
 People with Parkinson's take L-dopa

33:10.380 --> 33:12.420
 and other compounds to increase dopamine

33:12.420 --> 33:14.900
 because Parkinson's is associated

33:14.900 --> 33:16.900
 with deficits in movement.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.660
 It starts as a tremor,

33:18.660 --> 33:20.460
 actually starts as some other things that are interesting.

33:20.460 --> 33:21.440
 We'll talk about in a moment,

33:21.440 --> 33:25.540
 but Parkinson's is a depression.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.640
 It's a blunting of motivation and mood and affect,

33:28.640 --> 33:29.540
 and it's a tremor.

33:29.540 --> 33:31.220
 And then eventually in severe conditions,

33:31.220 --> 33:33.340
 it's challenges in speaking and walking.

33:33.340 --> 33:36.420
 So some famous examples would be Muhammad Ali,

33:36.420 --> 33:41.300
 Michael J. Fox, the great boxing trainer, Freddy Roach.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.240
 Like these people have Parkinson's

33:43.240 --> 33:45.160
 and they at least later in their life

33:45.160 --> 33:46.780
 had challenges speaking.

33:46.780 --> 33:49.380
 Now, it's not just fighters that develop Parkinson's.

33:50.380 --> 33:54.660
 As far as I know, Michael J. Fox wasn't a fighter.

33:54.660 --> 33:55.980
 People can develop Parkinson's

33:55.980 --> 33:57.660
 and Parkinson's is a depletion

33:57.660 --> 33:59.180
 of dopamine neurons in the brain.

33:59.180 --> 34:01.100
 And it's not just movement challenges,

34:01.100 --> 34:02.620
 it's challenges with mood.

34:02.620 --> 34:03.860
 Now, hopefully most of you,

34:03.860 --> 34:06.380
 all of you don't have Parkinson's,

34:06.380 --> 34:09.380
 but it's clear that dietary L-tyrosine

34:09.380 --> 34:14.380
 supports the healthy production of things like dopamine

34:14.380 --> 34:17.340
 and as well as other factors within the brain.

34:17.340 --> 34:18.980
 Now, some people immediately ask,

34:18.980 --> 34:20.820
 well, should I supplement L-tyrosine?

34:20.820 --> 34:22.000
 So let's just talk about that

34:22.000 --> 34:24.160
 because that's going to come up.

34:24.160 --> 34:26.620
 Full disclosure, I sometimes take L-tyrosine.

34:26.620 --> 34:27.640
 I'm not taking it right now,

34:27.640 --> 34:29.500
 but I take it only occasionally.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.540
 You can buy this in capsule form.

34:31.540 --> 34:35.560
 It does increase kind of mood and elevation and alertness.

34:35.560 --> 34:36.680
 It is over the counter.

34:36.680 --> 34:37.940
 You have to check with your doctor.

34:37.940 --> 34:39.420
 I'm not responsible for your healthcare

34:39.420 --> 34:40.940
 and I'm not a doctor.

34:40.940 --> 34:41.980
 Whether or not it's safe for you.

34:41.980 --> 34:44.920
 People with preexisting hyper dopaminergic conditions

34:44.920 --> 34:48.840
 like mania should probably not take L-tyrosine.

34:48.840 --> 34:50.340
 The other thing about taking L-tyrosine

34:50.340 --> 34:52.060
 is there is a crash, okay?

34:52.060 --> 34:53.300
 It's not a massive crash

34:53.300 --> 34:56.220
 if you take it at appropriate doses and it's right for you,

34:56.220 --> 34:59.020
 but it can produce a crash and a lethargy

34:59.020 --> 35:02.540
 and a kind of brain fog after the next day or so.

35:02.540 --> 35:06.100
 And so L-tyrosine, however,

35:06.100 --> 35:08.700
 can be ingested through foods or through supplementation

35:08.700 --> 35:09.880
 to increase dopamine levels.

35:09.880 --> 35:11.020
 That's well known.

35:11.020 --> 35:12.660
 Taken chronically, however,

35:12.660 --> 35:14.900
 it can disrupt those dopamine pathways.

35:14.900 --> 35:18.060
 Now there are other drugs that will increase L-tyrosine

35:18.060 --> 35:19.540
 and dopamine as well,

35:19.540 --> 35:20.620
 but those are severe enough

35:20.620 --> 35:22.680
 that they generally tend to have addictive properties.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.140
 So things like methamphetamine,

35:24.140 --> 35:26.340
 things like cocaine are terrible

35:26.340 --> 35:29.460
 because they really ramp up the dopamine system so much

35:29.460 --> 35:32.060
 that people really can't achieve dopamine release

35:32.060 --> 35:33.660
 through any other mechanisms.

35:33.660 --> 35:35.900
 But food and the ingestion of L-tyrosine

35:35.900 --> 35:38.880
 has a profound effect on our levels of dopamine.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.160
 It takes a little while,

35:40.160 --> 35:43.400
 but that really will impact level of mood.

35:43.400 --> 35:46.060
 Certain antidepressants fall into the category

35:46.060 --> 35:48.020
 of dopaminergic antidepressants.

35:48.020 --> 35:51.020
 One of the most famous ones, of course, is Wellbutrin.

35:51.020 --> 35:52.560
 Wellbutrin was developed

35:52.560 --> 35:54.960
 because a lot of the other antidepressants

35:54.960 --> 35:57.060
 tend to make people feel kind of lethargic

35:57.060 --> 35:59.860
 or they had side effect profiles that people didn't like.

35:59.860 --> 36:02.860
 So they developed this thing that,

36:02.860 --> 36:04.060
 the generic name is different,

36:04.060 --> 36:05.740
 but it's generally called Wellbutrin.

36:05.740 --> 36:08.840
 Wellbutrin activates dopamine and epinephrine,

36:08.840 --> 36:10.700
 which is a substrate of dopamine.

36:10.700 --> 36:12.820
 And both of those are involved in motivation

36:12.820 --> 36:14.380
 and alertness and effort.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.240
 So you might say, wow, this sounds like a great drug.

36:16.240 --> 36:19.640
 However, this drug, the side effect profile

36:19.640 --> 36:21.300
 tends to be the things that are associated

36:21.300 --> 36:22.980
 with elevated mood and alertness.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.100
 So this isn't like taking some L-tyrosine.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.180
 This isn't like eating some tyrosine rich foods.

36:27.180 --> 36:30.500
 This is really a much greater release of dopamine

36:30.500 --> 36:34.060
 and epinephrine, and it increases things like anxiety,

36:34.060 --> 36:36.380
 sweating, the pupils dilate.

36:36.380 --> 36:38.340
 It has certain effects on,

36:38.340 --> 36:40.260
 in particular people with epilepsy.

36:40.260 --> 36:43.760
 It's been used somewhat successfully for smoking cessation,

36:43.760 --> 36:45.380
 but again, it's not for everybody.

36:45.380 --> 36:48.100
 And I'm not here to encourage the use of these things.

36:48.100 --> 36:50.260
 I'm just describing the biology and the rationale

36:50.260 --> 36:52.700
 for why these drugs were developed.

36:52.700 --> 36:55.380
 So let's back up a second.

36:55.380 --> 36:57.040
 Let's just kind of take stock of where we're at.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.560
 We have a brain-body connection.

36:58.560 --> 36:59.580
 There are many of them,

36:59.580 --> 37:01.580
 but one of the main ones is the vagus nerve.

37:01.580 --> 37:04.020
 The vagus collects information about a lot of things,

37:04.020 --> 37:07.380
 breathing, heart rate, stuff that's happening in the gut,

37:07.380 --> 37:08.600
 et cetera, and gut by the way,

37:08.600 --> 37:10.420
 includes the stomach and the intestines,

37:10.420 --> 37:12.700
 sends that information up to the brain.

37:12.700 --> 37:14.400
 The brain is using that information

37:14.400 --> 37:16.140
 to decide one of two things,

37:16.140 --> 37:18.620
 move towards something or move away.

37:18.620 --> 37:19.640
 It can also pause,

37:19.640 --> 37:22.460
 but essentially pausing is not moving toward.

37:22.460 --> 37:24.860
 So that's the dopamine pathway

37:24.860 --> 37:27.500
 and foods rich in L-tyrosine generally give us

37:27.500 --> 37:29.900
 an elevated mood and make us want to do more

37:29.900 --> 37:32.100
 of whatever it is that we happen to be doing

37:32.100 --> 37:32.940
 as well as other things.

37:32.940 --> 37:34.880
 Motivation generalizes to other things.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.260
 It's not unique to just ingesting foods,

37:37.260 --> 37:40.040
 but foods that give us a big pulse of dopamine

37:40.040 --> 37:42.940
 will make us crave more of that food.

37:42.940 --> 37:45.220
 It will make us crave more of the activity

37:45.220 --> 37:47.900
 that led to the ingestion of that food.

37:47.900 --> 37:48.960
 And as I mentioned earlier,

37:48.960 --> 37:51.860
 a lot of that is happening at a subconscious level

37:51.860 --> 37:53.100
 that you're not even aware of.

37:53.100 --> 37:56.220
 And this is why I think the concern about hidden sugars

37:56.220 --> 37:58.740
 and over-ingestion of sugars is serious

37:58.740 --> 38:01.320
 because it's not just that the sugars

38:01.320 --> 38:04.180
 are impacting our blood glucose in negative ways,

38:04.180 --> 38:05.380
 although often it is.

38:05.380 --> 38:08.260
 It's not just the obesity crisis that's happening.

38:08.260 --> 38:10.700
 It's also the fact that it's disrupting

38:10.700 --> 38:12.220
 our dopamine systems.

38:12.220 --> 38:14.340
 Now that doesn't mean all sugar is bad.

38:14.340 --> 38:17.420
 Some people have a quite healthy relationship to sugar,

38:17.420 --> 38:19.060
 but I think most people are just not aware

38:19.060 --> 38:21.700
 that sugar isn't just operating at the level of taste.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.580
 It's operating at the level of neurochemicals

38:23.580 --> 38:25.940
 and it's doing it subconsciously.

38:25.940 --> 38:28.120
 So I'd like to talk about some of the other pathways

38:28.120 --> 38:31.700
 between brain and body that regulate our moods and emotions,

38:31.700 --> 38:33.820
 but also are actionable.

38:33.820 --> 38:36.200
 So the other neuromodulator that's really interesting

38:36.200 --> 38:39.300
 in the context of the vagus is serotonin.

38:39.300 --> 38:42.660
 Serotonin, just to remind you, is a neuromodulator.

38:42.660 --> 38:46.160
 Therefore, it creates a bias in which neural circuits,

38:46.160 --> 38:49.140
 which neurons in the brain and body are going to be active,

38:49.140 --> 38:50.440
 and it makes it less likely

38:50.440 --> 38:53.020
 that other ones are going to be active.

38:53.020 --> 38:55.660
 I think it's fair to say, without ever having measured it,

38:55.660 --> 38:58.700
 that my bulldog Costello must just,

38:58.700 --> 39:01.500
 his brain and body must be swimming in serotonin

39:01.500 --> 39:05.620
 because he's very calm and he eats a lot,

39:05.620 --> 39:07.300
 but he generally feels pretty sated.

39:07.300 --> 39:10.700
 He's kind of an animal that's obsessed with comforts.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.180
 He's a bit of a hedonist.

39:12.180 --> 39:13.820
 And serotonin, when it's elevated,

39:13.820 --> 39:16.100
 tends to make us feel really comfortable

39:16.100 --> 39:18.980
 and kind of blissed out wherever we are.

39:18.980 --> 39:22.500
 And that contrasts with dopamine and epinephrine,

39:22.500 --> 39:25.180
 which mainly put us in pursuit of things.

39:25.180 --> 39:27.260
 Motivation is pursuit.

39:27.260 --> 39:30.500
 Serotonin is more about feeling really comfy where we are.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.500
 The conversation around the brain-body relationship

39:34.500 --> 39:36.420
 and mood in serotonin for many years was,

39:36.420 --> 39:39.000
 well, you eat a big meal, the gut is distended,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.300
 you've got all the nutrients you need,

39:40.300 --> 39:43.820
 you rest and digest, and serotonin is released.

39:43.820 --> 39:47.880
 That's sorta true, but there's a lot more going on

39:47.880 --> 39:49.260
 and a lot more that's interesting

39:49.260 --> 39:51.060
 and actionable that's going on.

39:51.060 --> 39:53.740
 First of all, some of you, but perhaps not all,

39:53.740 --> 39:57.360
 have heard that more than 90% of the serotonin

39:57.360 --> 39:59.020
 that we make is in our gut.

39:59.020 --> 40:01.860
 And indeed, we have a lot of serotonin in our gut.

40:01.860 --> 40:04.180
 We have neurons in our gut that make serotonin.

40:04.180 --> 40:06.940
 We have neurons in our brain that make serotonin.

40:06.940 --> 40:07.940
 But here's the deal.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.540
 Most of the serotonin that impacts our mood

40:11.540 --> 40:14.600
 and our mental state is not in our gut.

40:14.600 --> 40:16.720
 Most of it is in the neurons of the brain

40:16.720 --> 40:19.060
 in an area called the raphe nucleus of the brain.

40:19.060 --> 40:20.860
 There are a few other locations too.

40:20.860 --> 40:22.320
 And those are the neurons that control

40:22.320 --> 40:24.700
 whether or not we feel satiated or not,

40:24.700 --> 40:27.000
 whether or not we feel happy and calm.

40:28.100 --> 40:30.280
 You can't have a discussion about serotonin

40:30.280 --> 40:32.400
 without having a discussion about antidepressants

40:32.400 --> 40:35.420
 because during the late 80s and early 90s,

40:35.420 --> 40:37.780
 there was this explosion in the number

40:37.780 --> 40:39.420
 of prescription drugs that were released,

40:39.420 --> 40:42.100
 things like first one and most famous one is Prozac,

40:42.100 --> 40:44.520
 Zoloft, and Paxil, a number of other ones

40:44.520 --> 40:47.560
 that are so-called SSRI, Selective Serotonin

40:47.560 --> 40:49.420
 Reuptake Inhibitors.

40:50.320 --> 40:53.720
 That's a long acronym, but basically those drugs work

40:53.720 --> 40:58.720
 by preventing the gobbling up of serotonin

40:59.580 --> 41:02.400
 or reuptake of serotonin into neurons

41:02.400 --> 41:03.380
 after it's been released,

41:03.380 --> 41:05.560
 which leads to more serotonin overall,

41:05.560 --> 41:07.100
 which means to elevate serotonin.

41:07.100 --> 41:11.200
 And indeed, those drugs were and can be very useful

41:11.200 --> 41:14.680
 for certain people to feel better in cases of depression

41:14.680 --> 41:17.080
 and some other clinical disorders as well.

41:17.080 --> 41:20.140
 So I really don't want to dismiss them

41:20.140 --> 41:22.660
 as useless or dangerous for everybody.

41:22.660 --> 41:25.620
 They can be quite useful for many people.

41:25.620 --> 41:27.480
 Not everyone responds well to them

41:27.480 --> 41:29.140
 as I'm sure you've all heard.

41:29.140 --> 41:31.880
 And their side effect profile

41:31.880 --> 41:34.760
 has effects like blunting affect.

41:34.760 --> 41:37.180
 It can make people feel kind of flat, kind of meh.

41:37.180 --> 41:39.800
 It can reduce appetite for food.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.320
 It can reduce appetite for sex.

41:41.320 --> 41:44.400
 It can do all sorts of things, or it can work really well.

41:44.400 --> 41:47.720
 Sometimes it's a dose-related issue, et cetera.

41:47.720 --> 41:50.000
 Serotonin is fascinating, however,

41:50.000 --> 41:53.480
 because how well those neurons in the RAFAE work

41:53.480 --> 41:55.880
 is impacted by some events within the gut,

41:55.880 --> 41:57.800
 although you might be surprised

41:57.800 --> 42:00.280
 to find out what those events are.

42:00.280 --> 42:03.100
 So let's go a little bit deeper into the gut.

42:03.100 --> 42:05.740
 And again, the gut includes the stomach

42:05.740 --> 42:07.840
 and then the small intestine and the large intestine

42:07.840 --> 42:10.400
 and ask like, what is going on with serotonin in the gut?

42:10.400 --> 42:12.600
 How is it impacting serotonin in the brain?

42:13.440 --> 42:15.960
 And let's think about this in the context

42:15.960 --> 42:18.480
 of how some of us might want to increase

42:18.480 --> 42:20.280
 or decrease our serotonin levels.

42:20.280 --> 42:23.340
 So as far as I know,

42:23.340 --> 42:27.000
 there aren't any really good at-home blood tests

42:27.000 --> 42:29.240
 for things like serotonin and dopamine.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.880
 There are some commercial products out there,

42:30.880 --> 42:35.120
 but to me, just to me, I'm not particularly impressed.

42:35.120 --> 42:37.960
 It's not the same as getting your hormones levels measured

42:37.960 --> 42:39.700
 or your metabolic factors measured.

42:39.700 --> 42:43.320
 That can be done and it can be done rigorously.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.420
 There are tests out there.

42:44.420 --> 42:45.960
 There are even some, believe it or not,

42:45.960 --> 42:47.680
 there's some questionnaires.

42:47.680 --> 42:49.040
 And I think actually last year

42:49.040 --> 42:50.560
 it made some of the bigger newspapers.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.760
 Are you more of a dopamine or a serotonin?

42:52.760 --> 42:54.280
 Are you a this or a that?

42:54.280 --> 42:55.820
 I find that stuff to be a little silly,

42:55.820 --> 42:58.160
 although I do appreciate and like the fact

42:58.160 --> 42:59.220
 that people are thinking about

42:59.220 --> 43:01.440
 and talking about neuromodulators.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.760
 There aren't really great ways to measure these things

43:04.760 --> 43:05.680
 outside the clinic.

43:05.680 --> 43:06.980
 There's some great clinical tools

43:06.980 --> 43:08.480
 that you can get inside of a hospital

43:08.480 --> 43:10.720
 or from a proper endocrinologist or neurologist,

43:10.720 --> 43:12.400
 but no great at-home tool.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.600
 So maybe that's a call to arms

43:13.600 --> 43:16.320
 for some of you entrepreneurial folks out there

43:16.320 --> 43:19.120
 to create these tests, accurate tests, please,

43:19.120 --> 43:20.680
 that could be done at home.

43:20.680 --> 43:23.640
 But some people feel like they're too anxious

43:23.640 --> 43:25.920
 or they're always in a motivated state

43:25.920 --> 43:27.680
 and they're trying to adjust their serotonin.

43:27.680 --> 43:31.320
 Many people adjust their serotonin by just eating more food

43:31.320 --> 43:35.160
 and carbohydrate-rich foods will increase serotonin.

43:35.160 --> 43:36.920
 I've talked about this on a previous podcast,

43:36.920 --> 43:39.700
 but I personally am a big fan, at least for me,

43:39.700 --> 43:42.280
 as I usually fast and exercise

43:42.280 --> 43:43.800
 in the early part of the day.

43:43.800 --> 43:48.420
 I eat a relatively high protein and moderate fat,

43:48.420 --> 43:51.680
 zero carb or low carb meal at lunch

43:51.680 --> 43:53.460
 and in the afternoon to stay alert

43:53.460 --> 43:56.760
 because those foods tend to favor dopamine production,

43:56.760 --> 43:57.920
 acetylcholine production,

43:57.920 --> 43:59.960
 epinephrine production, and alertness.

43:59.960 --> 44:03.480
 My mood is generally pretty good most of the time.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.240
 And then as evening comes around

44:05.240 --> 44:08.720
 and I'm concerned about sleep and a good night's sleep,

44:08.720 --> 44:09.980
 not concerned in an anxious way,

44:09.980 --> 44:11.640
 but I want to get a good night's sleep,

44:11.640 --> 44:14.600
 I will ingest foods that promote serotonin release

44:14.600 --> 44:16.520
 because they contain a lot of tryptophan.

44:16.520 --> 44:17.500
 So if I do eat meat,

44:17.500 --> 44:19.080
 it would be like a white meat, turkey meat.

44:19.080 --> 44:21.480
 I don't tend to, I've never liked turkey.

44:21.480 --> 44:25.160
 I don't mind the animal, but I don't like ingesting the meat.

44:25.160 --> 44:28.840
 But starchy carbohydrates will increase serotonin.

44:28.840 --> 44:32.240
 Some people also will take serotonin.

44:32.240 --> 44:35.280
 You can now buy 5-HTP supplements.

44:35.280 --> 44:36.700
 This is a little bit tricky.

44:36.700 --> 44:40.720
 5-HTP supplements can of course increase 5-HTP.

44:40.720 --> 44:43.480
 It is 5-HTP or serotonin,

44:43.480 --> 44:46.360
 but that sometimes can create problems

44:46.360 --> 44:49.640
 in endogenous or self-made production of serotonin.

44:49.640 --> 44:52.160
 So I'm never a fan of taking things

44:52.160 --> 44:54.440
 very close to the chemical you're trying to increase

44:54.440 --> 44:57.800
 for very long periods of time, maybe for occasional use.

44:57.800 --> 45:00.700
 I have the problem that if I take serotonin supplements,

45:00.700 --> 45:04.120
 5-HTP, I fall asleep, the sleep I have is very intense

45:04.120 --> 45:05.640
 and I wake up three or four hours later.

45:05.640 --> 45:08.160
 And we know based on sleep studies

45:08.160 --> 45:09.660
 with good measurements in the lab

45:09.660 --> 45:12.040
 that serotonin release tends to be

45:12.040 --> 45:13.520
 in the later part of the night.

45:13.520 --> 45:15.200
 And so by taking it early in the night,

45:15.200 --> 45:17.240
 it really can disrupt the pattern of sleep

45:17.240 --> 45:18.440
 and the depth of sleep.

45:18.440 --> 45:21.420
 Nonetheless, some people are interested in taking serotonin

45:21.420 --> 45:23.980
 to get some of the more blissed out effects.

45:23.980 --> 45:25.760
 You can achieve that with foods, as I mentioned,

45:25.760 --> 45:27.420
 that are carbohydrate rich.

45:27.420 --> 45:28.260
 So as you're seeing,

45:28.260 --> 45:30.400
 this isn't really a discussion about nutrition per se.

45:30.400 --> 45:31.880
 This is a discussion about food,

45:31.880 --> 45:33.760
 which contains amino acids.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.440
 Amino acids being the precursors to neuromodulators

45:36.440 --> 45:39.320
 and neuromodulators having a profound effect

45:39.320 --> 45:42.360
 on your overall state of alertness or calmness,

45:42.360 --> 45:44.440
 happiness, sadness, and wellbeing.

45:44.440 --> 45:47.600
 So there are a number of things that one can take.

45:47.600 --> 45:50.160
 As I mentioned, one of them being 5-HTP itself.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.520
 Now I'm not recommending people take anything,

45:52.520 --> 45:55.480
 but if you're interested in what this does

45:55.480 --> 45:56.640
 and you want to explore this,

45:56.640 --> 45:58.760
 of course you'd want permission from your doctor.

45:58.760 --> 46:00.680
 You can go to this free website.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.280
 I love this resource.

46:02.280 --> 46:03.400
 They don't pay me to say that,

46:03.400 --> 46:04.660
 but I just love this resource.

46:04.660 --> 46:07.540
 I followed it for a long time called examine.com.

46:08.760 --> 46:10.640
 Thank you folks at examine.com

46:10.640 --> 46:12.420
 for putting this free resource out on the web

46:12.420 --> 46:14.120
 that has links through what they call

46:14.120 --> 46:16.040
 the human effect matrix.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.040
 So it's links to all the PubMed studies

46:18.040 --> 46:20.280
 for particular effects of particular compounds

46:20.280 --> 46:21.360
 that one can buy and ingest.

46:21.360 --> 46:23.920
 Incredible, as well as important health warnings.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.160
 So I'm not going to read through everything,

46:25.160 --> 46:27.760
 but if you were to go to examine.com, as I have now,

46:27.760 --> 46:30.280
 and you'd put in 5-HTP,

46:30.280 --> 46:32.520
 they're only looking at things that have strong evidence.

46:32.520 --> 46:37.520
 PubMed articles, articles are in the PubMed archives.

46:37.520 --> 46:39.520
 So for instance, I didn't know this,

46:39.520 --> 46:44.000
 but 5-HTP produces a notable decrease in appetite.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.360
 Three studies.

46:45.360 --> 46:48.000
 And this appetite suppression makes sense, of course,

46:48.000 --> 46:51.440
 because we ingest foods to get serotonin.

46:51.440 --> 46:53.400
 And if we have enough serotonin,

46:53.400 --> 46:55.700
 then there's no reason to ingest more foods.

46:55.700 --> 46:57.560
 It tends to have a blunting of appetite.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.640
 It probably does that also through other mechanisms.

46:59.640 --> 47:01.160
 So I'm not saying you should do this,

47:01.160 --> 47:03.360
 but if someone's trying to blunt their appetite,

47:03.360 --> 47:05.740
 it could be a interesting route.

47:05.740 --> 47:07.800
 Although I don't recommend chronic use.

47:08.760 --> 47:11.960
 Not surprisingly, there's a decrease in body weight

47:11.960 --> 47:14.120
 as a consequence, an increase in cortisol.

47:14.120 --> 47:15.960
 So that's kind of important to note

47:15.960 --> 47:18.320
 that when you typically in biology,

47:18.320 --> 47:20.600
 if you pull on one string really hard, another one moves,

47:20.600 --> 47:21.880
 it's a little bit like a puppet

47:21.880 --> 47:24.040
 and there's more than one string on the puppet.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.400
 So it does seem to increase cortisol,

47:26.400 --> 47:27.880
 though they report as a minor effect.

47:27.880 --> 47:30.160
 Again, links to all those studies are there,

47:30.160 --> 47:32.460
 which is why I'm not listing them out in our caption notes.

47:32.460 --> 47:34.280
 You can go and get them at examine.com,

47:34.280 --> 47:36.700
 put in serotonin and you'll find that.

47:36.700 --> 47:40.880
 So I find it fascinating that nowadays

47:40.880 --> 47:44.980
 there are things that are somewhere between doing nothing,

47:44.980 --> 47:47.440
 getting serotonin from tryptophan in foods

47:47.440 --> 47:48.560
 and prescription drugs.

47:48.560 --> 47:51.080
 There's this other category of supplements

47:51.080 --> 47:53.840
 that are really interesting for modulating

47:53.840 --> 47:55.200
 these chemicals in the body.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.180
 And I should mention before I move on,

47:57.180 --> 47:58.480
 because I mentioned L-tyrosine,

47:58.480 --> 48:00.480
 I neglected to mention earlier

48:00.480 --> 48:02.080
 in our discussion about dopamine.

48:02.080 --> 48:04.140
 If you're interested in the dopamine pathway,

48:04.140 --> 48:08.240
 go to examine.com, put in mucuna pruriens,

48:08.240 --> 48:11.320
 it's M-U-C-U-N-A,

48:11.320 --> 48:16.000
 P separate word, P-R-U-R-I-E-N-S.

48:17.000 --> 48:20.080
 It is a velvet bean that grows from vines

48:20.080 --> 48:23.460
 and is very itchy to touch due to serotonin on its surface.

48:23.460 --> 48:25.900
 Amazing, this bean has serotonin on its surface.

48:25.900 --> 48:29.040
 And indeed serotonin, if you were to put it on your skin,

48:29.040 --> 48:31.620
 would cause some irritation of the skin, amazing.

48:31.620 --> 48:35.240
 Inside the bean is L-DOPA.

48:35.240 --> 48:37.800
 Mucuna pruriens is not just something

48:37.800 --> 48:39.640
 that promotes dopamine release

48:39.640 --> 48:42.720
 because of some weird mystical ancient thing

48:42.720 --> 48:44.520
 or whatever, or sorcery.

48:44.520 --> 48:49.320
 It is chemically L-DOPA, the precursor to dopamine.

48:49.320 --> 48:51.480
 It contains some other molecules as well

48:51.480 --> 48:53.840
 and low levels of other psychoactives.

48:53.840 --> 48:56.720
 This stuff is available over the counter, incredible.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.280
 I personally find it incredible.

48:59.140 --> 49:00.580
 Its effects are really interesting.

49:00.580 --> 49:01.940
 I'm not going to read them all off,

49:01.940 --> 49:03.460
 but I mentioned these effects

49:03.460 --> 49:05.240
 not because I'm encouraging you to take it,

49:05.240 --> 49:06.760
 but because you get a window

49:06.760 --> 49:10.320
 into what acute dopamine increase does

49:10.320 --> 49:12.840
 in the non-Parkinsonian context.

49:12.840 --> 49:14.600
 And you can start to think about foods

49:14.600 --> 49:16.560
 that are rich in L-tyrosine

49:16.560 --> 49:20.100
 as biasing certain effects or not others.

49:20.100 --> 49:21.400
 So when you hear food is medicine,

49:21.400 --> 49:23.420
 food isn't really medicine, food is food,

49:23.420 --> 49:25.880
 but food has these chemical effects as well.

49:25.880 --> 49:30.880
 So first one listed is three studies with very high rigor

49:32.600 --> 49:35.760
 that overall have a minor effect on,

49:35.760 --> 49:37.300
 of all things, sperm quality.

49:37.300 --> 49:39.840
 So it appears that sperm motility itself,

49:39.840 --> 49:41.320
 I'm assuming when they say sperm quality,

49:41.320 --> 49:43.260
 I don't know what features of sperm of quality

49:43.260 --> 49:44.100
 they looked at with sperm.

49:44.100 --> 49:45.740
 That's not a discussion I want to have,

49:45.740 --> 49:47.240
 but I'm assuming it's motility

49:47.240 --> 49:49.920
 because I know enough about reproductive biology

49:49.920 --> 49:52.880
 to know that sperm ability to swim

49:52.880 --> 49:54.840
 depends on some proteins that are present

49:54.840 --> 49:56.560
 in the front of the sperm, et cetera,

49:56.560 --> 49:58.000
 things like pentraxins,

49:58.000 --> 50:00.920
 and sperm motility is generally associated

50:00.920 --> 50:02.120
 with sperm quality.

50:02.120 --> 50:05.600
 Sperm that don't move are generally not very useful sperm.

50:05.600 --> 50:07.260
 Symptoms of Parkinson disease

50:07.260 --> 50:10.120
 are notably degraded with macuna purines.

50:10.120 --> 50:12.120
 So fascinating, that's not surprising.

50:12.120 --> 50:13.840
 And there are a lot of other effects here,

50:13.840 --> 50:16.320
 feelings of subjective wellbeing, testosterone,

50:16.320 --> 50:18.840
 reductions in prolactin, not surprising.

50:18.840 --> 50:22.240
 Prolactin is a hormone that's involved in milk letdown,

50:22.240 --> 50:24.480
 it's in lactating mothers,

50:24.480 --> 50:26.960
 it's involved in feelings of peace

50:26.960 --> 50:30.920
 and generally is antagonistic to sexual desire

50:30.920 --> 50:33.280
 in both men and female.

50:33.280 --> 50:37.200
 So it's really interesting that things like macuna purines,

50:37.200 --> 50:40.260
 which are L-DOPA, reduced prolactin, increased motility,

50:40.260 --> 50:42.180
 increased testosterone, subjective wellbeing.

50:42.180 --> 50:44.000
 So you're starting to see a theme, right?

50:44.000 --> 50:47.160
 Dopamine really makes us motivated, feel in pursuit,

50:47.160 --> 50:48.240
 makes us feel good.

50:48.240 --> 50:51.760
 Serotonin makes us feel more relaxed and calm.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.480
 Now, this whole month is about emotion.

50:53.480 --> 50:54.960
 So you might be thinking, well, wait,

50:54.960 --> 50:57.240
 where are we going with all this as it relates to emotions?

50:57.240 --> 50:59.540
 But in the last episode,

50:59.540 --> 51:01.840
 I said something I'm going to repeat it now briefly,

51:01.840 --> 51:04.120
 which is that much of what we talk about

51:04.120 --> 51:06.040
 as good emotions or bad emotions,

51:06.040 --> 51:08.640
 there's a context to that, there's a social context.

51:08.640 --> 51:11.400
 You can't really say an emotion is good or bad,

51:11.400 --> 51:14.480
 grieving at a funeral is healthy, okay?

51:14.480 --> 51:16.480
 Being happy at a funeral,

51:16.480 --> 51:18.560
 assuming you loved the person that died,

51:18.560 --> 51:21.580
 is most people probably wouldn't think that was healthy.

51:21.580 --> 51:25.800
 So we can't really say that certain emotions like sadness

51:25.800 --> 51:28.160
 or happiness are healthy, its context is important.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.920
 Cultural context is important.

51:29.920 --> 51:31.920
 Many of you have asked for book recommendations.

51:31.920 --> 51:35.100
 This is an opportunity to raise a mention of another book.

51:35.100 --> 51:38.260
 Again, I don't have any financial affiliation or anything,

51:38.260 --> 51:40.280
 but if you want to read more about emotions

51:40.280 --> 51:44.360
 and how the context and cultural things impact our emotions,

51:44.360 --> 51:47.000
 I'm a huge fan of Lisa Feldman Barrett.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.440
 I learned about her from the Lex Fridman podcast.

51:50.700 --> 51:52.720
 I've had discussions with her on my Instagram live.

51:52.720 --> 51:56.040
 She's at Northeastern University, a world expert in emotions.

51:56.040 --> 51:58.440
 Her first book is How Emotions Are Made.

51:58.440 --> 51:59.580
 This is not a book she sent me.

51:59.580 --> 52:02.640
 I paid for this with my own money years ago,

52:02.640 --> 52:05.720
 bought it, read it, loved it long before I met Lisa.

52:05.720 --> 52:06.760
 I'm just delighted that we've got

52:06.760 --> 52:08.060
 to known each other a little bit.

52:08.060 --> 52:10.320
 It's a really interesting read into the psychology

52:10.320 --> 52:13.720
 of emotions and some of the subjectivity of emotions.

52:13.720 --> 52:16.800
 So whereas I'm talking about mainly the biology of emotions,

52:16.800 --> 52:18.880
 this gets a little bit more into the psychology

52:18.880 --> 52:21.160
 of the biology as well.

52:21.160 --> 52:23.200
 And Lisa is just terrific.

52:23.200 --> 52:24.560
 She's also putting a lot of information

52:24.560 --> 52:25.920
 out into the world about emotions.

52:25.920 --> 52:29.920
 So if you want to learn more about that, check out her work.

52:29.920 --> 52:32.040
 Again, it's Lisa Feldman Barrett

52:32.040 --> 52:34.120
 and that book is How Emotions Are Made.

52:34.120 --> 52:37.520
 Hopefully she'll continue to write many more books.

52:37.520 --> 52:41.680
 So now you understand the relationship, I hope,

52:41.680 --> 52:46.200
 between foods and dopamine, foods and serotonin

52:46.200 --> 52:47.920
 and that they're both being communicated

52:47.920 --> 52:49.640
 to the brain via the vagus, right?

52:49.640 --> 52:51.120
 We ingest these foods.

52:51.120 --> 52:53.680
 These supplements are things people take.

52:53.680 --> 52:55.520
 They don't put them directly into the brain.

52:55.520 --> 52:56.440
 They put them in our gut.

52:56.440 --> 52:58.640
 So yes, there's a gut brain connection

52:58.640 --> 53:01.760
 but it's not about the serotonin in the gut

53:01.760 --> 53:04.160
 that makes you feel calm and placid.

53:04.160 --> 53:07.560
 It's not about the dopamine in the gut.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.760
 It's just been oversold that way

53:09.760 --> 53:11.720
 because I think there's something really attractive

53:11.720 --> 53:14.160
 and I understand about the idea

53:14.160 --> 53:18.060
 that because certain things about our experience of life

53:18.060 --> 53:19.620
 and our emotions is happening in our body

53:19.620 --> 53:21.720
 that maybe we have a little more control, right?

53:21.720 --> 53:23.400
 Because this thing is a hard container.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.100
 We can't just stuff some dopamine in there.

53:25.100 --> 53:26.320
 I can't just, you know,

53:26.320 --> 53:28.760
 I could probably take a macuna purines bean

53:28.760 --> 53:29.760
 and stuff it in my ear.

53:29.760 --> 53:30.600
 Please don't do that.

53:30.600 --> 53:31.520
 It'd make my ear itchy

53:31.520 --> 53:32.960
 because of the serotonin on the outside.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.480
 But you can't get stuff in there.

53:34.480 --> 53:36.280
 What you have to do is ingest things

53:36.280 --> 53:38.360
 that are metabolized in certain ways

53:38.360 --> 53:40.440
 that communicate to the brain

53:40.440 --> 53:43.300
 or so maybe they pass into the brain themselves

53:43.300 --> 53:45.680
 across what's called the blood brain barrier.

53:45.680 --> 53:48.280
 I'll talk about the blood brain barrier in a minute.

53:48.280 --> 53:49.800
 It's actually called the BBB.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.800
 So it ends up sounding like baby, BBB.

53:53.360 --> 53:54.920
 I guess that's like BB.

53:54.920 --> 53:57.720
 Anyway, BBB.

53:57.720 --> 53:59.960
 But there are also nerves in the gut

53:59.960 --> 54:02.680
 that are sensing the nutrient contents of food

54:02.680 --> 54:05.160
 and then saying, oh, you should feel better and want more.

54:05.160 --> 54:09.880
 Oh, that's got a lot of bitterness and acid taste to it.

54:09.880 --> 54:12.080
 You should want less of that, okay?

54:12.080 --> 54:14.080
 So as I transition out of the discussion

54:14.080 --> 54:16.880
 about dopamine and serotonin and the gut,

54:16.880 --> 54:19.160
 hopefully you've got some actionable items there

54:19.160 --> 54:21.380
 under your belt, pun intended,

54:21.380 --> 54:23.960
 where you can understand how certain foods

54:23.960 --> 54:26.040
 and certain nutrients and you can look these up

54:26.040 --> 54:27.840
 might impact your mood.

54:27.840 --> 54:30.600
 If you're somebody who's really anxious and really wired,

54:30.600 --> 54:32.880
 well, then the dopamine adrenaline pathway,

54:32.880 --> 54:34.440
 epinephrine pathway is probably not one

54:34.440 --> 54:36.880
 that you want to lean on any harder.

54:36.880 --> 54:39.320
 If you tend to be someone who's pretty passive

54:39.320 --> 54:40.760
 and you're having trouble with motivation,

54:40.760 --> 54:44.320
 well, then think about ramping up the dopamine pathway.

54:44.320 --> 54:46.920
 I always think behaviors and proper food choices

54:46.920 --> 54:48.200
 is the best way to start

54:48.200 --> 54:51.340
 and behaviors include things like exercise, et cetera.

54:51.340 --> 54:53.280
 But one of the problems with the discussion

54:53.280 --> 54:57.200
 around mood and exercise or mood and meditation

54:57.200 --> 54:59.480
 is that it's so subjective.

54:59.480 --> 55:01.920
 It's like, I love certain forms of exercise and not others.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.320
 Certain ones are aversive to me.

55:03.320 --> 55:05.000
 Certain ones are attractive to me.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.000
 And it's never really clear.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.200
 No one's ever told me, okay,

55:07.200 --> 55:09.760
 you have to do 10 minutes on the bike

55:09.760 --> 55:12.940
 at X number of RPM at so-and-so or on the skier

55:12.940 --> 55:14.460
 in order to get your dopamine up.

55:14.460 --> 55:18.680
 But we can actually say if you ingest more L-tyrosine,

55:18.680 --> 55:19.920
 there's a high probability

55:19.920 --> 55:22.240
 that you're going to make more dopamine.

55:22.240 --> 55:23.600
 And I'm talking about ingesting it through food

55:23.600 --> 55:25.440
 or through supplementation, if you like.

55:25.440 --> 55:28.520
 Macuna purines I've tried, I should just mention,

55:28.520 --> 55:30.540
 it was too dopaminergic for me.

55:30.540 --> 55:33.280
 I really, really jazzed up

55:33.280 --> 55:36.560
 and then severe crash for me the next day.

55:36.560 --> 55:39.320
 But that's, I think, because I tend to ride pretty high

55:39.320 --> 55:41.320
 on the kind of alertness and motivation scale.

55:41.320 --> 55:43.640
 I'm always being told by Costello

55:43.640 --> 55:44.960
 and other people in the podcast studio

55:44.960 --> 55:46.640
 to slow my speech down.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.440
 This is me uncaffeinated

55:48.440 --> 55:49.860
 and I could probably afford

55:49.860 --> 55:51.760
 a little more serotonin in my life.

55:51.760 --> 55:54.520
 So whereas Costello, he could afford,

55:54.520 --> 55:57.440
 well, he could afford to wake up every couple of days

55:57.440 --> 55:58.680
 and just say hello to us.

55:58.680 --> 56:01.560
 This dog sleeps more than any other creature.

56:01.560 --> 56:02.660
 It's remarkable.

56:03.600 --> 56:06.960
 So there are things that we can do and they're actionable

56:06.960 --> 56:09.520
 and they are, in some ways they're quantitative

56:09.520 --> 56:11.120
 because you can regulate dosages

56:11.120 --> 56:13.500
 and you can regulate amounts and you can regulate timing.

56:13.500 --> 56:14.760
 And everyone has to play with these things

56:14.760 --> 56:17.400
 and figure out what's right for them in terms of feeding.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.680
 And everyone has to explore

56:19.680 --> 56:21.780
 and understand what's safe and right for them.

56:21.780 --> 56:25.000
 But, and of course, exercise is still very important.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.320
 I talked about social connection in the last episode,

56:27.320 --> 56:30.800
 super important for activation of serotonin.

56:30.800 --> 56:33.040
 But when it comes to this gut brain,

56:33.040 --> 56:36.440
 body brain relationship, what we eat really matters

56:36.440 --> 56:38.960
 in terms of the neurochemicals that we make.

56:38.960 --> 56:41.120
 So let's talk a little bit more about things

56:41.120 --> 56:43.680
 that we ingest in our body and then allow our body

56:43.680 --> 56:46.280
 to inform our brain to shift our mood.

56:46.280 --> 56:48.800
 And this is something I've been doing for years

56:48.800 --> 56:50.080
 and I just want to say,

56:50.080 --> 56:52.560
 I've found to be a complete game changer.

56:52.560 --> 56:55.120
 There's excellent science to support it.

56:55.120 --> 56:58.960
 And I think most people are familiar with it

56:58.960 --> 57:00.100
 in a different context,

57:00.100 --> 57:03.440
 but I don't think most people know this simple fact,

57:03.440 --> 57:08.440
 which is that the omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acid ratio

57:09.680 --> 57:12.600
 has a profound effect on depression.

57:12.600 --> 57:15.160
 It has a profound effect on mood.

57:15.160 --> 57:20.040
 So much so that in a double blind placebo controlled study

57:20.040 --> 57:21.220
 that I will provide the link to,

57:21.220 --> 57:23.300
 this was a study first published in 2008,

57:23.300 --> 57:25.240
 but there've been many others as well.

57:27.380 --> 57:29.740
 First of all, in an experiment done in animals,

57:29.740 --> 57:31.920
 they found there's a model of learned helplessness

57:31.920 --> 57:32.760
 in animals.

57:32.760 --> 57:33.840
 It's not very kind to the animals,

57:33.840 --> 57:35.680
 but they put rats or mice in a jar.

57:35.680 --> 57:38.440
 They let them swim and they'll swim, swim, swim

57:38.440 --> 57:39.440
 to try and save their life.

57:39.440 --> 57:40.560
 And eventually they give up.

57:40.560 --> 57:41.460
 It's a learned helplessness.

57:41.460 --> 57:42.320
 They don't let them drown.

57:42.320 --> 57:43.280
 They take them out.

57:44.620 --> 57:47.140
 Adjusting the omega-3 omega-6 ratio

57:47.140 --> 57:49.620
 so that the omega-3s are higher

57:49.620 --> 57:51.900
 led to less learned helplessness,

57:51.900 --> 57:54.080
 meaning these animals would swim longer, okay?

57:54.080 --> 57:55.640
 Now that's an animal that's a rat,

57:55.640 --> 57:57.960
 not a particularly kind study,

57:57.960 --> 58:01.440
 but that same study was essentially done in humans,

58:01.440 --> 58:02.680
 although they didn't have them swim

58:02.680 --> 58:04.480
 to the point of near drowning.

58:04.480 --> 58:07.680
 What they did is they took people

58:07.680 --> 58:10.600
 who were clinically depressed, major depression, okay?

58:10.600 --> 58:14.560
 Major depression is severe maladaptive state,

58:14.560 --> 58:17.900
 meaning it inhibits job, relationships, appetite,

58:17.900 --> 58:19.800
 all sorts of negative health effects.

58:19.800 --> 58:24.800
 And they did a comparison of 1,000 milligrams a day of EPA.

58:26.320 --> 58:29.280
 So EPA is one of the elements

58:29.280 --> 58:31.320
 that contains high levels of omega-3s

58:31.320 --> 58:32.820
 that's in things like fish oil.

58:32.820 --> 58:35.060
 Talk about other sources in a little bit,

58:35.060 --> 58:38.520
 but it wasn't 1,000 milligrams of fish oil.

58:38.520 --> 58:41.760
 It was 1,000 milligrams of EPA.

58:41.760 --> 58:45.240
 Compare that to 20 milligrams of fluoxetine,

58:45.240 --> 58:47.480
 which is Prozac, okay?

58:47.480 --> 58:49.440
 Really increases serotonin.

58:49.440 --> 58:52.280
 And in this study of 60 individuals,

58:52.280 --> 58:54.980
 again, I'll provide the links to the study,

58:56.260 --> 58:59.520
 they found that they were equally effective

58:59.520 --> 59:01.260
 in reducing depressive symptoms.

59:01.260 --> 59:03.080
 So imagine that,

59:03.080 --> 59:07.840
 a food-based compound that you can't make without, right?

59:07.840 --> 59:09.280
 This is not a situation

59:09.280 --> 59:10.960
 where you can make your own omega-3s.

59:10.960 --> 59:12.360
 You have to get them from food sources

59:12.360 --> 59:13.360
 or from supplementation.

59:13.360 --> 59:17.440
 Was as effective as 20 milligrams of fluoxetine

59:17.440 --> 59:19.400
 over the course of eight weeks.

59:19.400 --> 59:22.560
 And what was really interesting in addition to that

59:22.560 --> 59:26.320
 is that the combination of 1,000 milligrams of EPA

59:26.320 --> 59:28.480
 and fluoxetine had a synergistic effect

59:28.480 --> 59:30.320
 in lowering depressive symptoms.

59:30.320 --> 59:31.540
 I find this remarkable.

59:31.540 --> 59:35.360
 I heard about this when it first came out

59:35.360 --> 59:37.040
 and I wasn't sure what to make of it

59:37.040 --> 59:38.360
 because there are a lot of studies that come out.

59:38.360 --> 59:41.720
 And I generally like to focus my changes in behavior

59:41.720 --> 59:43.720
 around things where there's a large center of mass.

59:43.720 --> 59:45.180
 There's a lot of information.

59:46.240 --> 59:47.080
 A couple of years later,

59:47.080 --> 59:52.080
 I did in fact start taking 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA

59:52.120 --> 59:53.300
 in fish oil.

59:53.300 --> 59:57.000
 Now, there are a few side effects of fish oil.

59:57.000 --> 59:59.840
 People who have blood, who are bleeders,

59:59.840 --> 1:00:02.280
 who have factor V Leiden mutations

1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:05.620
 or women who are taking birth control,

1:00:05.620 --> 1:00:06.460
 which can make you,

1:00:06.460 --> 1:00:08.280
 which can affect blood clotting and things of that sort

1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:10.340
 really should talk to your doctor,

1:00:10.340 --> 1:00:12.080
 make sure it's okay for you.

1:00:12.080 --> 1:00:14.880
 Fish oil also can give people fishy breath,

1:00:14.880 --> 1:00:17.040
 which is pretty gross, frankly,

1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:18.800
 but there are now fish oils that

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:20.360
 either because of the encapsulations

1:00:20.360 --> 1:00:24.960
 or because they put some lemon flavoring in there

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:26.620
 doesn't have that effect.

1:00:26.620 --> 1:00:29.040
 In any event, 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA,

1:00:29.040 --> 1:00:30.720
 I started ingesting that regularly.

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:31.620
 I just felt better.

1:00:31.620 --> 1:00:32.840
 I wasn't clinically depressed,

1:00:32.840 --> 1:00:35.680
 but I generally, I did feel, at least for me,

1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:37.780
 an increase in mood and affect

1:00:37.780 --> 1:00:39.040
 and a number of other things.

1:00:39.040 --> 1:00:40.340
 It's supposed to reduce inflammation.

1:00:40.340 --> 1:00:42.360
 The cardiovascular effects are controversial.

1:00:42.360 --> 1:00:44.180
 For a long time, everyone thought

1:00:44.180 --> 1:00:47.080
 the effects on platelets were really terrific.

1:00:47.080 --> 1:00:48.280
 Then there were articles that came out

1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:50.660
 in major newspapers saying maybe not so much,

1:00:50.660 --> 1:00:53.800
 but the effects on mood are really profound.

1:00:53.800 --> 1:00:56.120
 And now there are lots of studies.

1:00:56.120 --> 1:00:59.520
 If you go into PubMed and you were to put EPA

1:00:59.520 --> 1:01:01.280
 or fish oil and depression,

1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:03.040
 you would find that there were a number

1:01:03.040 --> 1:01:04.960
 of really impressive results showing

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:06.720
 that it's at least as effective

1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:11.620
 as certain SSRIs antidepressants at these dosages.

1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:13.440
 And it can amplify or improve

1:01:13.440 --> 1:01:16.320
 the effect of low dosages of some of these SSRIs.

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:18.220
 So I feel like more people should know about this.

1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:21.240
 This is nutrition, but it's profoundly affecting mood.

1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:23.160
 And depression is terrible, right?

1:01:23.160 --> 1:01:27.120
 Depression can have a component of anxiety in some cases

1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:30.680
 where people are, they feel lousy and very uncertain.

1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:32.720
 That's kind of how I talk about depression with anxiety

1:01:32.720 --> 1:01:34.520
 is you talk to someone who's anxious

1:01:34.520 --> 1:01:36.300
 and you can tell them everything's going to be okay, okay.

1:01:36.300 --> 1:01:39.360
 And they're always concerned about what they might not know.

1:01:39.360 --> 1:01:41.280
 You don't really know the plane isn't going to crash.

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:43.880
 You don't really know that life is going to go okay.

1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:44.920
 And in some sense, they're right.

1:01:44.920 --> 1:01:47.680
 No one has a crystal ball or can predict the future,

1:01:47.680 --> 1:01:50.920
 but they tend to perseverate or fixate on the uncertainty.

1:01:50.920 --> 1:01:51.760
 And then of course,

1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:55.080
 there are the versions of depression that involve certainty.

1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:56.540
 People are lethargic and they're certain.

1:01:56.540 --> 1:01:57.860
 They say, yeah, I'm certain

1:01:57.860 --> 1:01:58.960
 I'm never going to get another job.

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:00.580
 I'm certain I'm never going to meet anyone new.

1:02:00.580 --> 1:02:01.740
 I'm certain I'm going to fail.

1:02:01.740 --> 1:02:03.680
 So there's this kind of a divide

1:02:03.680 --> 1:02:05.480
 in the sphere of depression

1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:06.840
 around certainty and uncertainty.

1:02:06.840 --> 1:02:10.680
 But what's interesting is this 1,000 milligrams per day

1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:12.200
 or more of EPA

1:02:12.200 --> 1:02:16.280
 has been shown to relieve both forms of depression.

1:02:16.280 --> 1:02:18.480
 Now, does that mean it's going to work for everybody?

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:20.640
 No, I'm not here to try and play psychiatrist.

1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:23.520
 I want to point you in the direction of these manuscripts

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:26.140
 so that you can make informed choices for yourself.

1:02:26.140 --> 1:02:28.140
 You can discuss it with your doctor and family

1:02:28.140 --> 1:02:30.420
 and make the choices that are right for you.

1:02:30.420 --> 1:02:32.540
 But here's what's especially interesting

1:02:32.540 --> 1:02:33.480
 about the heart effects,

1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:36.880
 because we've heard that these omega-3s,

1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:38.880
 which of course you can get from other sources too.

1:02:38.880 --> 1:02:40.240
 You can get from fatty fish.

1:02:40.240 --> 1:02:42.840
 There are flax seeds, hemp seeds.

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:47.960
 There are a number of chia seeds, these kinds of things.

1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:51.320
 But the levels of EPA that are required are quite high.

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:53.600
 So this 1,000 milligrams per day,

1:02:53.600 --> 1:02:55.140
 that's pretty hard to get from food,

1:02:55.140 --> 1:02:58.480
 although it can be done depending on what you're eating.

1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:02.360
 What's interesting is that the heart effects

1:03:02.360 --> 1:03:05.720
 that are solid, that really stand up in the literature

1:03:05.720 --> 1:03:07.860
 have a lot more to do with something we talked about

1:03:07.860 --> 1:03:09.600
 in a previous episode and I'll mention again,

1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:11.640
 which is heart rate variability.

1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:14.000
 So we know that having a heart rate that's really high

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:15.600
 or a heart rate that's really low,

1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:17.020
 neither of those are good.

1:03:17.020 --> 1:03:17.860
 A lot of people think,

1:03:17.860 --> 1:03:20.640
 oh, you just want a low heart rate, big stroke volume.

1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:22.040
 You know, if you're running a lot,

1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:24.160
 you may have 30 or 40 beats per minute.

1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:25.440
 That's great to be in shape,

1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:27.720
 but you still want heart rate variability.

1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:29.320
 It has a lot to do with the tone

1:03:29.320 --> 1:03:31.240
 of the autonomic nervous system.

1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:33.140
 Talked about last time how when you inhale,

1:03:33.140 --> 1:03:34.280
 it speeds up heart rate.

1:03:34.280 --> 1:03:35.840
 When you exhale, it decreases heart rate.

1:03:35.840 --> 1:03:38.600
 That's called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.

1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:41.000
 That's the basis of heart rate variability.

1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:42.500
 We'll maybe do a short post about this

1:03:42.500 --> 1:03:44.320
 so you can get all the mechanism

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:46.880
 and the behaviors that spill out of that

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:48.200
 that might be useful for you.

1:03:48.200 --> 1:03:51.760
 But the point is heart rate variability, HRV, is good.

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:54.880
 And what's interesting is that there was a study in 2009

1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:58.600
 that showed that people who eat a diet

1:03:58.600 --> 1:04:00.480
 and fail to supplement in a way

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:03.240
 that there's a high omega-6 to 3 ratio,

1:04:03.240 --> 1:04:05.240
 so not enough omega-3s,

1:04:05.240 --> 1:04:08.600
 not only are there markers of inflammatory cytokines

1:04:08.600 --> 1:04:11.500
 elevated things like IL-6 and TNF-alpha,

1:04:11.500 --> 1:04:15.540
 but they tend to be non-responders to antidepressants.

1:04:16.440 --> 1:04:19.880
 Shifting that omega-3 omega-6 ratio did a couple things.

1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:22.680
 First of all, increasing the amount of EPA,

1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:24.960
 shifted the ratio so it was higher omega-3

1:04:24.960 --> 1:04:27.480
 to omega-6 ratio, which was good,

1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:29.360
 lowered the inflammation markers,

1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:32.400
 and then allowed antidepressants to have their effect

1:04:32.400 --> 1:04:34.000
 even at low doses.

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.080
 And here's the really interesting thing.

1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:40.040
 It worked by increasing heart rate variability.

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:42.680
 And you think, well, how in the world would this happen?

1:04:42.680 --> 1:04:45.720
 But that's a ton of effects.

1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:48.600
 But the way it works is because of the way

1:04:48.600 --> 1:04:50.540
 that these things are impacting the gut

1:04:50.540 --> 1:04:51.960
 and the autonomic nervous system.

1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:55.200
 Remember earlier I said the vagus includes connections

1:04:55.200 --> 1:04:57.780
 from the heart signaling about sensory information

1:04:57.780 --> 1:05:00.360
 about how fast the heart is beating to the brain,

1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:01.560
 not just stuff from the lungs,

1:05:01.560 --> 1:05:03.560
 but information from the heart.

1:05:03.560 --> 1:05:05.400
 And the brain then adjusts heart rate

1:05:05.400 --> 1:05:07.120
 by heart rate variability.

1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:09.280
 So it's incredible that there's a way

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:12.080
 that one can use the gut,

1:05:12.080 --> 1:05:14.280
 the ingestion of more of these EPAs,

1:05:14.280 --> 1:05:16.280
 either through food or supplementation,

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:19.000
 to increase heart rate variability

1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:22.800
 and thereby to improve symptoms,

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:25.080
 meaning reduce symptoms of depression,

1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:28.560
 and to even make low levels of antidepressants

1:05:28.560 --> 1:05:30.480
 that wouldn't otherwise work work.

1:05:30.480 --> 1:05:32.640
 And I think I like this study so much

1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:34.400
 because A, it's super cool.

1:05:34.400 --> 1:05:36.140
 It bridges the brain-body axis.

1:05:36.140 --> 1:05:39.400
 It incorporates nutrition and micronutrients in the brain,

1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:42.080
 but also because it really points to something

1:05:42.080 --> 1:05:43.480
 that we hear all the time,

1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:45.140
 which is that our body is a whole system.

1:05:45.140 --> 1:05:45.980
 It's working as a whole system.

1:05:45.980 --> 1:05:47.960
 And the brain isn't working in isolation

1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:49.400
 up there in the skull.

1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:51.800
 It's reacting to things that are happening in the body,

1:05:51.800 --> 1:05:53.180
 in the gut, and in the heart rate,

1:05:53.180 --> 1:05:54.400
 and heart rate variability,

1:05:54.400 --> 1:05:55.680
 and that the things we ingest

1:05:55.680 --> 1:05:57.520
 can have a profound effect on them.

1:05:57.520 --> 1:06:00.260
 Now, of course, I really want to emphasize something,

1:06:00.260 --> 1:06:04.780
 which is that no one compound or nutrient

1:06:04.780 --> 1:06:08.560
 or supplement or drug or behavior for that matter

1:06:08.560 --> 1:06:11.400
 is going to be the be all end all

1:06:11.400 --> 1:06:13.840
 of shifting out of depression

1:06:13.840 --> 1:06:16.760
 or improving one's mood or improving sleep.

1:06:16.760 --> 1:06:18.520
 It's a constellation of things.

1:06:18.520 --> 1:06:20.120
 And this is especially true

1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:22.200
 when people start to get excited about supplements

1:06:22.200 --> 1:06:23.680
 and drugs of all kinds

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:25.280
 and their potential for various things.

1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:27.480
 Right now, there's a lot of excitement about psychedelics

1:06:27.480 --> 1:06:29.400
 and their therapeutic uses, and I think great.

1:06:29.400 --> 1:06:33.040
 But as a good friend of mine who's a physician clinician

1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:36.220
 says better living through chemistry

1:06:36.220 --> 1:06:38.360
 still requires better living.

1:06:38.360 --> 1:06:41.260
 You cannot expect to take a compound

1:06:41.260 --> 1:06:43.640
 regardless of source or potency

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:46.760
 and have it completely shift your experience of life

1:06:46.760 --> 1:06:48.680
 without having to continue to engage

1:06:48.680 --> 1:06:50.880
 in the proper behaviors, all the things we know,

1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:54.440
 proper sleep, exercise, social connection, food, et cetera.

1:06:54.440 --> 1:06:56.400
 There are many others as well.

1:06:56.400 --> 1:07:00.800
 So I still find that this collection of studies

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:04.180
 about omega-3 to omega-6 ratios to be profoundly important,

1:07:04.180 --> 1:07:05.980
 so much so that it's completely changed the way

1:07:05.980 --> 1:07:09.260
 that I think about food, the foods I eat, I do supplement.

1:07:09.260 --> 1:07:11.800
 I don't necessarily think that's for everybody,

1:07:11.800 --> 1:07:14.740
 but I really think it's incredible

1:07:14.740 --> 1:07:15.680
 that there are these compounds

1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:17.120
 that have these robust effects

1:07:17.120 --> 1:07:18.960
 on our feelings of wellbeing.

1:07:18.960 --> 1:07:20.640
 And there are others too.

1:07:20.640 --> 1:07:23.340
 So that 1,000 milligram per day threshold

1:07:23.340 --> 1:07:25.600
 of fish oil that's beneficial

1:07:25.600 --> 1:07:28.760
 requires that one take a reasonable amount of these things

1:07:28.760 --> 1:07:31.840
 either through food or through supplementation.

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:35.100
 I acknowledge that not everyone wants to take fish oil.

1:07:35.100 --> 1:07:35.940
 There are a couple of reasons

1:07:35.940 --> 1:07:37.800
 why one might want to avoid that.

1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:40.060
 One would be for ethical reasons.

1:07:40.060 --> 1:07:42.040
 You have an emotional relationship

1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:44.020
 or a relationship to the environment

1:07:44.020 --> 1:07:47.680
 that makes you not want to ingest fish related products.

1:07:47.680 --> 1:07:48.880
 There's krill oil.

1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:49.960
 Krill is still an organism.

1:07:49.960 --> 1:07:52.400
 It's a little tiny thing that whales eat a lot of

1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:54.080
 and people generally eat very little of.

1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:56.080
 So krill is out there.

1:07:56.080 --> 1:07:58.480
 I personally, just me, I don't know why,

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:00.660
 I didn't react well to krill.

1:08:00.660 --> 1:08:02.040
 It didn't make me feel very good.

1:08:02.040 --> 1:08:05.560
 I had some like kind of skin itches and things like that.

1:08:05.560 --> 1:08:06.920
 And they stopped when I stopped taking it,

1:08:06.920 --> 1:08:08.980
 but I don't want to bias you against it

1:08:08.980 --> 1:08:09.920
 if that's your preference.

1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:13.260
 Some people really like krill oil as a source of omega-3s.

1:08:13.260 --> 1:08:16.200
 I did mention some of the other sources

1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:18.200
 like chia seeds and flax seeds.

1:08:18.200 --> 1:08:19.020
 But as you'll notice,

1:08:19.020 --> 1:08:21.400
 these are not things that we tend to ingest a lot of

1:08:21.400 --> 1:08:22.600
 on a regular basis.

1:08:22.600 --> 1:08:25.640
 It is possible to get omega-3s from meats

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:27.560
 if the animals have grazed on grasses

1:08:27.560 --> 1:08:30.040
 that contain a lot of omega-3s.

1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:33.520
 So for those of you that ingest meat,

1:08:34.560 --> 1:08:37.220
 the source of those meats is going to be very important

1:08:37.220 --> 1:08:39.160
 as it relates to omega-3s.

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:41.500
 Even within the category of fish oil,

1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:45.360
 there's a concern sometimes about mercury

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:47.000
 and other contaminants.

1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.720
 You want to go with a brand that emphasizes

1:08:49.720 --> 1:08:52.840
 that they've gone to really good sources

1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:56.520
 and that they decontaminate regardless.

1:08:56.520 --> 1:08:58.680
 And so you have to search out those brands.

1:08:58.680 --> 1:08:59.840
 There is a test that you can do

1:08:59.840 --> 1:09:03.320
 as to whether or not the fish oil is rancid or not.

1:09:03.320 --> 1:09:05.000
 Some people take it in liquid form.

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:06.360
 Some people take it in capsule form.

1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:08.760
 The liquid form is going to be more affordable.

1:09:08.760 --> 1:09:12.800
 The capsule form is a little easier and a little more

1:09:12.800 --> 1:09:13.640
 portable.

1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:18.680
 You can actually just chew one of the gel tablets.

1:09:18.680 --> 1:09:20.800
 And if it tastes really fishy and kind of rancid,

1:09:20.800 --> 1:09:22.060
 you'll know it's disgusting.

1:09:22.060 --> 1:09:23.400
 You'll want to spit it out.

1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:25.340
 And if it doesn't and it's tolerable,

1:09:25.340 --> 1:09:26.860
 then you'll know that it's okay.

1:09:26.860 --> 1:09:28.240
 Unfortunately, you have to buy it first

1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:29.060
 in order to do that.

1:09:29.060 --> 1:09:30.340
 Although, I don't know,

1:09:30.340 --> 1:09:32.040
 maybe you can get them to open up the bottle for you

1:09:32.040 --> 1:09:34.680
 in the store and tell them that you don't want to try it.

1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:37.400
 Someday, perhaps, fish oil and omega-3s,

1:09:37.400 --> 1:09:39.040
 it'll be like tasting wine at a restaurant

1:09:39.040 --> 1:09:39.960
 where you can send it back.

1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:42.240
 For now, I think you have to purchase it first,

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:44.460
 but find a brand you trust and like

1:09:44.460 --> 1:09:46.240
 and then work with them

1:09:46.240 --> 1:09:48.520
 if you decide to go that route, of course.

1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.220
 There are other compounds that are also interesting

1:09:51.220 --> 1:09:53.400
 for mood elevation

1:09:53.400 --> 1:09:58.160
 that are essentially like foods or are supplement-based

1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:00.480
 that now, fortunately,

1:10:00.480 --> 1:10:03.160
 there are really good data from peer-reviewed studies.

1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:04.720
 And the next one I want to mention,

1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:06.440
 because I think it's really interesting,

1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:08.360
 is L-carnitine.

1:10:08.360 --> 1:10:11.320
 Now, L-carnitine has been around a long time

1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:13.720
 and it's been discussed in the context of heart health

1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:14.560
 and a number of other things.

1:10:14.560 --> 1:10:17.480
 It was actually in tout is a bit of a weight loss agent

1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:19.680
 in the early 90s,

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:23.840
 but L-carnitine actually has some really impressive effects

1:10:23.840 --> 1:10:25.680
 on depression.

1:10:25.680 --> 1:10:29.000
 And again, we will look to PubMed

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.260
 because looking at examine.com is essentially,

1:10:31.260 --> 1:10:33.600
 for me anyway, looking at PubMed.

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:34.760
 What is L-carnitine?

1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:37.040
 L-carnitine is most prevalent in meat

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:38.640
 and in beef in particular.

1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:39.800
 Now, for the vegans,

1:10:39.800 --> 1:10:42.440
 please know that L-carnitine is available

1:10:42.440 --> 1:10:44.120
 through non-meat sources as well,

1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:46.940
 although it's not as enriched in non-meat sources.

1:10:46.940 --> 1:10:48.720
 It's a really interesting molecule

1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:50.900
 because L-cetyl L-carnitine

1:10:50.900 --> 1:10:53.560
 is essentially what's made from L-carnitine,

1:10:53.560 --> 1:10:55.400
 but it's acetylated.

1:10:55.400 --> 1:10:56.920
 If you're interested in the biochemistry,

1:10:56.920 --> 1:10:57.760
 you can look that up.

1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:59.840
 It's acetylated into a form

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:01.380
 that can cross the blood-brain barrier.

1:11:01.380 --> 1:11:04.240
 The blood-brain barrier or BBB is a barrier.

1:11:04.240 --> 1:11:06.820
 It's a wall around the brain.

1:11:06.820 --> 1:11:08.260
 And you have this barrier

1:11:08.260 --> 1:11:11.280
 because the brain is so important

1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:13.300
 and it has this feature that the neurons there

1:11:13.300 --> 1:11:15.520
 don't recreate themselves after injury,

1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:17.000
 like other organs of the body.

1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000
 There's not a lot of turnover of cells,

1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:20.500
 despite what you might've heard.

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:23.160
 And so nature has created this BBB,

1:11:23.160 --> 1:11:24.200
 this blood-brain barrier,

1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:26.400
 to make sure that certain molecules,

1:11:26.400 --> 1:11:27.680
 in particular large molecules,

1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:29.900
 don't get across the blood-brain barrier

1:11:29.900 --> 1:11:32.020
 because it can be damaging to those tissues.

1:11:32.020 --> 1:11:35.960
 Incidentally, you also have a very rigid

1:11:35.960 --> 1:11:38.240
 or stringent barrier around other organs,

1:11:38.240 --> 1:11:39.120
 which are the gonads.

1:11:39.120 --> 1:11:41.920
 So the ovaries and the testes and the brain

1:11:41.920 --> 1:11:45.880
 are the organs of the body that nature has gone

1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:47.780
 out of its way to protect,

1:11:47.780 --> 1:11:50.880
 give this additional layer of the blood-brain barrier,

1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:54.800
 or as you might imagine for the testes and the ovaries,

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:57.520
 it's going to be the blood gonadal barrier.

1:11:57.520 --> 1:12:01.000
 So these barriers exist and make it such that

1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:02.600
 just because you eat something,

1:12:02.600 --> 1:12:03.600
 just because you ingest it,

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:05.900
 doesn't mean it's going to cross the blood-brain barrier.

1:12:05.900 --> 1:12:07.400
 But L-carnitine, when taken,

1:12:07.400 --> 1:12:10.520
 is acetylated and converted into this form

1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:12.700
 that gets across the blood-brain barrier.

1:12:12.700 --> 1:12:14.200
 And it has a lot of effects.

1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:15.920
 It's involved in mitochondrial activation

1:12:15.920 --> 1:12:17.300
 of long-chain fatty acids,

1:12:17.300 --> 1:12:19.000
 which that's a big mouthful

1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:20.060
 that we can get into sometime

1:12:20.060 --> 1:12:21.640
 when we're talking about metabolic.

1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:24.780
 But it has some interesting effects on the neuro side.

1:12:24.780 --> 1:12:28.600
 So if you decide to check it out on examine.com,

1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:29.760
 you'll see some really interesting things.

1:12:29.760 --> 1:12:32.960
 Lots of effects on ammonia, C-reactive proteins,

1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:35.980
 things of that sort, blood glucose is lowered, et cetera.

1:12:35.980 --> 1:12:39.600
 That's all stuff that's the level of blood in periphery,

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:41.720
 slight effects in lowering cholesterol.

1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:44.220
 Here's some interesting ones.

1:12:45.460 --> 1:12:48.200
 Rates of pregnancy go way up

1:12:48.200 --> 1:12:51.140
 when people are taking L-carnitine,

1:12:51.140 --> 1:12:52.840
 both the father and the mother,

1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:55.280
 both the source of sperm and the source of egg

1:12:56.660 --> 1:12:59.640
 are affected in ways that favor pregnancy.

1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:02.280
 It does increase, here we go again with sperm quality,

1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:04.640
 sperm motility in males,

1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:08.320
 and it seems to have positive effects on females

1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:11.080
 that have polycystic ovary syndrome.

1:13:11.080 --> 1:13:13.120
 So check that out.

1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:14.800
 The effects are very strong.

1:13:14.800 --> 1:13:16.320
 There are three studies listed there.

1:13:16.320 --> 1:13:18.060
 Again, I'm not promoting this,

1:13:18.060 --> 1:13:20.320
 but that people take L-carnitine,

1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:22.160
 especially if you're trying to get pregnant,

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:25.040
 but check it out because the effects there

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:26.320
 and the studies that are mentioned

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:30.240
 are published in peer-reviewed rigorous journals.

1:13:30.240 --> 1:13:32.680
 In terms of the neural effects,

1:13:32.680 --> 1:13:34.240
 those are quite interesting.

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:37.160
 The effects on depression are still emerging,

1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:38.780
 but they do seem to exist,

1:13:38.780 --> 1:13:42.940
 that people feel a notable decrease in depressive symptoms.

1:13:42.940 --> 1:13:45.500
 There are seven studies listed on examine.com

1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:48.960
 that has a notable benefit in a variety of circumstances

1:13:48.960 --> 1:13:51.740
 where participants have heightened depression already.

1:13:51.740 --> 1:13:55.420
 They start taking L-carnitine and they start feeling better,

1:13:55.420 --> 1:13:57.800
 and they talk about dosages in those various studies.

1:13:57.800 --> 1:14:00.980
 It also has been shown to have a notable decrease

1:14:00.980 --> 1:14:04.400
 in the symptoms of autism, which I find fascinating also.

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:08.600
 Again, the things we ingest impact the chemicals

1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:11.560
 in our brain and how they impact the rest of our body.

1:14:11.560 --> 1:14:12.920
 There's other things that's been used

1:14:12.920 --> 1:14:15.480
 to treat certain forms of alcohol dependence.

1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:16.760
 I think this is going to be

1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:19.320
 a very exciting emerging area.

1:14:19.320 --> 1:14:20.940
 We're going to do a whole month about addiction.

1:14:20.940 --> 1:14:23.280
 I've got a great guest lined up for that month,

1:14:23.280 --> 1:14:27.080
 but there's now an emerging field

1:14:27.080 --> 1:14:29.400
 about what people can take and supplement

1:14:29.400 --> 1:14:32.880
 to help ease the cravings and the withdrawal

1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:35.280
 when trying to quit drugs of abuse,

1:14:35.280 --> 1:14:37.800
 like cocaine, alcohol, heroin, and smoking,

1:14:37.800 --> 1:14:39.080
 and things of that sort.

1:14:39.080 --> 1:14:41.700
 So really interesting area.

1:14:41.700 --> 1:14:43.740
 This is, I like to think is the early days,

1:14:43.740 --> 1:14:44.880
 and then we're going to discover a lot more.

1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:47.280
 There's a huge list of things here.

1:14:47.280 --> 1:14:49.200
 Since we talked about pain in a previous episode,

1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:52.120
 and I know a lot of people have written to me

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:55.520
 about fibromyalgia, it does, L-carnitine has been shown

1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:57.640
 to reduce symptoms of fibromyalgia.

1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:00.880
 Again, all the links to studies are on examine.com,

1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:04.160
 totally free site, and that was my bulldog

1:15:04.160 --> 1:15:05.640
 being a battering ram.

1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:07.640
 There's nothing graceful about this bulldog.

1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:09.840
 He's the side he wanted to leave to go get a drink of water,

1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:12.320
 and so please forgive the noise.

1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:15.200
 Okay, so now let's turn to another aspect

1:15:15.200 --> 1:15:20.140
 of the gut-brain relationship that will surprise you,

1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:22.080
 in some cases might shock you,

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:25.760
 and that has some really cool and actionable biology,

1:15:25.760 --> 1:15:30.120
 and that's the gut microbiome, probiotics,

1:15:30.120 --> 1:15:31.360
 and prebiotics.

1:15:31.360 --> 1:15:34.220
 I know today we're talking about emotions and not pain,

1:15:34.220 --> 1:15:36.580
 but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention another effect

1:15:36.580 --> 1:15:39.000
 of acetyl-L-carnitine that's been reported,

1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.520
 and that you can find listed with link to study

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:44.700
 on examine.com, which is its effect

1:15:44.700 --> 1:15:47.160
 in reducing the symptoms of migraine.

1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:51.480
 This was a randomized control trial with 133 participants

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:53.280
 who had frequent migraines.

1:15:53.280 --> 1:15:57.580
 They were taking 500 milligrams of L-carnitine,

1:15:57.580 --> 1:16:00.440
 or nothing, for 12 weeks.

1:16:00.440 --> 1:16:02.220
 So the control is a little bit,

1:16:02.220 --> 1:16:04.120
 the control experiment there is a little bit tricky,

1:16:04.120 --> 1:16:06.040
 but it had a significant effect

1:16:06.040 --> 1:16:08.340
 on reducing the number of migraine attacks per month.

1:16:08.340 --> 1:16:10.460
 So I find that really interesting,

1:16:10.460 --> 1:16:13.740
 and there's a lot more listed there about the study,

1:16:13.740 --> 1:16:17.260
 and I think these compounds are powerful.

1:16:17.260 --> 1:16:19.680
 They carry risks for certain people, not for others.

1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:22.960
 So again, you have to find out what's right for you,

1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:25.760
 but I do think they are super interesting

1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:29.620
 as potential therapeutics for various people.

1:16:29.620 --> 1:16:32.240
 So what's the deal with the gut microbiome

1:16:32.240 --> 1:16:34.300
 and the gut-brain axis?

1:16:34.300 --> 1:16:36.700
 Today, we've actually been talking a lot already

1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:38.740
 about the gut-brain axis

1:16:38.740 --> 1:16:40.860
 that has nothing to do with microbiomes.

1:16:40.860 --> 1:16:43.180
 We've been talking about this vagus nerve

1:16:43.180 --> 1:16:47.380
 that connects providing sensory information

1:16:47.380 --> 1:16:48.820
 from the body to the brain,

1:16:48.820 --> 1:16:52.560
 and then the brain also sends, in the same nerve,

1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:55.220
 motor information to control the motility

1:16:55.220 --> 1:16:57.900
 the gut, the heart rate, how fast we breathe,

1:16:57.900 --> 1:17:02.100
 and deployment of immune stuff, killer cells,

1:17:02.100 --> 1:17:03.300
 and things of that sort.

1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:08.500
 But oftentimes, when we hear about the gut-brain axis

1:17:08.500 --> 1:17:13.100
 these days, it's a discussion about the gut microbiome.

1:17:13.100 --> 1:17:15.220
 And once again, we're in a situation

1:17:15.220 --> 1:17:18.140
 where there's incredible biology.

1:17:18.140 --> 1:17:20.100
 I'm very happy there's so much discussion

1:17:20.100 --> 1:17:21.780
 about the gut microbiome.

1:17:21.780 --> 1:17:24.260
 I am somewhat dismayed and concerned

1:17:24.260 --> 1:17:26.140
 that most of what I hear out there

1:17:26.140 --> 1:17:29.440
 is either false or partially false.

1:17:29.440 --> 1:17:32.580
 So we're going to clear up some of the misconceptions,

1:17:32.580 --> 1:17:34.100
 first by understanding the biology,

1:17:34.100 --> 1:17:34.940
 and then we're going to talk about

1:17:34.940 --> 1:17:36.420
 some of the actionable items.

1:17:38.620 --> 1:17:42.500
 It is true that we have a lot of these little

1:17:42.500 --> 1:17:46.200
 microorganisms living in our gut.

1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:49.380
 They're not there because they want to help us.

1:17:49.380 --> 1:17:50.660
 They don't have brains.

1:17:50.660 --> 1:17:52.440
 They are adaptive, however.

1:17:52.440 --> 1:17:56.540
 They try and find and create environments

1:17:56.540 --> 1:17:59.140
 that make it easier for them to proliferate.

1:17:59.140 --> 1:18:01.340
 So they don't care about you and me,

1:18:01.340 --> 1:18:04.620
 but they are perfectly willing to exploit you and me

1:18:04.620 --> 1:18:07.180
 in order to make more of themselves,

1:18:07.180 --> 1:18:08.320
 the same way viruses are.

1:18:08.320 --> 1:18:09.620
 Viruses don't have a mind.

1:18:09.620 --> 1:18:11.660
 They infect cells, they hijack the genome,

1:18:11.660 --> 1:18:14.260
 and they use that genome to make more of themselves.

1:18:16.540 --> 1:18:19.620
 The microbiota that live in us

1:18:19.620 --> 1:18:22.720
 vary along the length of our digestive track.

1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:23.760
 But let's just take a step back

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:26.740
 and think about how our body plan is made.

1:18:26.740 --> 1:18:28.660
 We are actually a series of tubes.

1:18:28.660 --> 1:18:29.860
 Our brain is actually a tube.

1:18:29.860 --> 1:18:31.740
 You see it's all squishy on the outside,

1:18:31.740 --> 1:18:32.980
 and then it's got that long thing,

1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:34.980
 the spinal cord that goes down to the base of the spine.

1:18:34.980 --> 1:18:36.420
 That's the central nervous system.

1:18:36.420 --> 1:18:37.920
 That all started out as a tube.

1:18:37.920 --> 1:18:40.980
 It just looks like a cauliflower on the other end

1:18:40.980 --> 1:18:45.180
 up in the brain because the tube is so big

1:18:45.180 --> 1:18:46.660
 and it has to be crammed into the skull

1:18:46.660 --> 1:18:48.200
 so it gets all wrinkled up.

1:18:48.200 --> 1:18:49.720
 But if we were to splay it out,

1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:52.280
 you'd find that it's just one big tube.

1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:55.200
 Similarly, our digestive tract and our airways

1:18:55.200 --> 1:18:57.660
 are essentially one big tube.

1:18:57.660 --> 1:19:00.220
 It starts with our mouth, also our nose,

1:19:00.220 --> 1:19:01.640
 and then we have all these other tubes

1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:05.040
 that go down through our throat and then into our stomach

1:19:05.040 --> 1:19:07.300
 and then into our various intestines,

1:19:07.300 --> 1:19:10.460
 and then the tube ends out the other end.

1:19:10.460 --> 1:19:12.740
 So we are one long tube for digestion.

1:19:12.740 --> 1:19:16.500
 And inside of that tube is a mucosal lining.

1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:18.780
 It's these little microvilli, tiny, tiny, tiny,

1:19:18.780 --> 1:19:22.780
 little like velvety ends of cells

1:19:22.780 --> 1:19:26.100
 that are able to move and move things along,

1:19:26.100 --> 1:19:29.320
 and mucus, mucosa.

1:19:29.320 --> 1:19:32.640
 And the conditions of that mucosal lining

1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:34.660
 set a number of different things.

1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:36.860
 It sets the rate of our digestion

1:19:36.860 --> 1:19:38.940
 and the quality of our digestion.

1:19:38.940 --> 1:19:41.340
 It sets, for instance, our immune system.

1:19:41.340 --> 1:19:42.820
 Most people probably don't realize this,

1:19:42.820 --> 1:19:45.060
 but most infections in the environment,

1:19:45.060 --> 1:19:47.100
 well, they have to get into our body somehow.

1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:49.380
 Some of them are inhaled.

1:19:49.380 --> 1:19:51.180
 A lot of them go into our mouth

1:19:51.180 --> 1:19:53.740
 and lodge in the mucosal lining of the mouth,

1:19:53.740 --> 1:19:55.980
 and then infections start there.

1:19:55.980 --> 1:19:58.020
 You probably had the experience, unfortunately,

1:19:58.020 --> 1:20:00.060
 of feeling like you have a tick in your throat,

1:20:00.060 --> 1:20:01.340
 like something's irritating your throat,

1:20:01.340 --> 1:20:04.160
 and then it kind of migrates up into a head cold

1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:06.100
 or a runny nose.

1:20:06.100 --> 1:20:07.500
 Sometimes it'll start as a headache.

1:20:07.500 --> 1:20:08.780
 Sometimes it won't.

1:20:08.780 --> 1:20:12.680
 But things that can migrate down into the gut.

1:20:12.680 --> 1:20:14.720
 So we're ingesting things all the time.

1:20:14.720 --> 1:20:17.540
 Think about air, bacteria, viruses,

1:20:17.540 --> 1:20:19.460
 they're making their way into our gut.

1:20:19.460 --> 1:20:21.940
 And some of those bacteria live in the gut,

1:20:21.940 --> 1:20:26.420
 and some of those bacteria bias the mucosal lining

1:20:26.420 --> 1:20:29.800
 in the gut, stomach and intestines,

1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:33.920
 to be more acidic or more basic

1:20:33.920 --> 1:20:36.140
 so that they can make more of themselves,

1:20:36.140 --> 1:20:36.980
 so they can replicate.

1:20:36.980 --> 1:20:38.420
 They like a particular comfort.

1:20:38.420 --> 1:20:41.860
 It's like they like a particular kind of bedding

1:20:41.860 --> 1:20:44.680
 to lie down in and create more of themselves.

1:20:44.680 --> 1:20:48.960
 Now, some of those mucosal linings that they promote

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:50.220
 make us feel better.

1:20:50.220 --> 1:20:51.400
 They make us feel more alert.

1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:52.740
 They bolster our immune system,

1:20:52.740 --> 1:20:54.500
 and others make us feel worse.

1:20:54.500 --> 1:20:57.460
 So first rule,

1:20:57.460 --> 1:21:00.340
 the microbiome isn't good or bad.

1:21:00.340 --> 1:21:02.420
 Some of these little bugs that live in us

1:21:02.420 --> 1:21:03.580
 do bad things to us.

1:21:03.580 --> 1:21:05.140
 They make us feel worse.

1:21:05.140 --> 1:21:06.500
 They lower our immunity.

1:21:06.500 --> 1:21:08.840
 They affect us in negative ways.

1:21:08.840 --> 1:21:10.380
 Some of them make us feel better.

1:21:10.380 --> 1:21:13.960
 And they do that mainly by changing the conditions

1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:16.660
 of our gut environment.

1:21:16.660 --> 1:21:17.860
 In addition to that,

1:21:17.860 --> 1:21:22.720
 they do impact the neurotransmitters

1:21:22.720 --> 1:21:25.340
 and the neurons that live in the gut

1:21:25.340 --> 1:21:26.940
 and that signal up to the brain

1:21:26.940 --> 1:21:28.980
 to impact things like dopamine and serotonin

1:21:28.980 --> 1:21:31.260
 that we've been talking about previously.

1:21:31.260 --> 1:21:35.200
 So there's a vast world now

1:21:35.200 --> 1:21:38.520
 devoted to trying to understand what sources of food,

1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:41.280
 what kinds of foods are good or not good

1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:42.460
 for the gut microbiome.

1:21:42.460 --> 1:21:44.780
 So let's just talk about some general rules of thumb

1:21:44.780 --> 1:21:46.040
 related to the research,

1:21:46.040 --> 1:21:48.020
 quality research that's peer reviewed.

1:21:48.020 --> 1:21:49.540
 And then in a future episode,

1:21:49.540 --> 1:21:52.540
 we will go far deeper into the gut microbiome

1:21:52.540 --> 1:21:54.060
 and gut brain axis.

1:21:54.060 --> 1:21:56.140
 But here's a few things

1:21:56.140 --> 1:21:59.220
 that I think you might find surprising.

1:21:59.220 --> 1:22:00.180
 First of all,

1:22:00.180 --> 1:22:04.280
 supporting a healthy gut microbiome is good for mood,

1:22:04.280 --> 1:22:05.760
 great for digestion,

1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:08.560
 and great for immune system function.

1:22:08.560 --> 1:22:13.260
 However, that does not mean maxing out

1:22:13.260 --> 1:22:16.280
 or taking the most probiotic and prebiotic

1:22:16.280 --> 1:22:18.200
 that you can possibly manage.

1:22:18.200 --> 1:22:19.740
 As I mentioned many times before,

1:22:19.740 --> 1:22:21.400
 I do believe in probiotics,

1:22:21.400 --> 1:22:22.800
 I take probiotics,

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:23.920
 but there are studies that show

1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:27.320
 that if you take lots and lots of certain probiotics

1:22:27.320 --> 1:22:30.740
 like lactobacillus and you really ramp up the levels more,

1:22:30.740 --> 1:22:33.040
 it is not a case of more is better.

1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:37.120
 There are things like brain fog that can come from that.

1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:39.400
 Brain fog is just this inability to focus,

1:22:39.400 --> 1:22:41.920
 people feel really not well generally.

1:22:41.920 --> 1:22:43.560
 Some of those studies are a little bit controversial,

1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:44.620
 but I think it's fair to say

1:22:44.620 --> 1:22:48.880
 that if people really increase the amount of probiotic

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:52.480
 that they're taking beyond a certain amount,

1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:55.420
 then they start feeling foggy in the mind.

1:22:55.420 --> 1:22:57.160
 Now, what's too much?

1:22:57.160 --> 1:23:00.240
 Well, I get probiotics from,

1:23:00.240 --> 1:23:01.760
 I've mentioned before from athletic greens,

1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:03.380
 you can get them from fermented foods

1:23:03.380 --> 1:23:06.940
 like sauerkraut, pickles, kimchi,

1:23:06.940 --> 1:23:09.920
 natto, these are different sources from around the world.

1:23:09.920 --> 1:23:11.860
 Actually, I'd love to hear some of the other sources

1:23:11.860 --> 1:23:13.740
 that people know, other foods from around the world.

1:23:13.740 --> 1:23:17.080
 I'm fascinated by the way in which different cultures

1:23:17.080 --> 1:23:21.180
 have all arrived at these foods

1:23:21.180 --> 1:23:24.400
 that provide and support healthy microbiomes

1:23:24.400 --> 1:23:26.360
 because they're fermented.

1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:28.760
 I have a colleague at Stanford, Justin Sonnenberg,

1:23:28.760 --> 1:23:29.760
 he and I have talked about this,

1:23:29.760 --> 1:23:33.880
 I don't want to quote him inappropriately,

1:23:33.880 --> 1:23:35.440
 but we've had discussions around,

1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:38.840
 they've published that the ingestion of fermented foods

1:23:38.840 --> 1:23:41.280
 is one of the best ways to support healthy levels

1:23:41.280 --> 1:23:45.460
 of gut microbiota without exceeding the threshold

1:23:45.460 --> 1:23:47.940
 that would cause things like brain fog.

1:23:47.940 --> 1:23:51.240
 So foods and fermented foods are going to be the best source

1:23:51.240 --> 1:23:54.060
 and there are a number of different ways

1:23:54.060 --> 1:23:54.900
 that one could do that.

1:23:54.900 --> 1:23:55.920
 Some people don't like fermented foods,

1:23:55.920 --> 1:23:57.920
 however, some people supplement it.

1:23:57.920 --> 1:24:02.220
 So it isn't a case of more is better, so we know that.

1:24:02.220 --> 1:24:06.920
 The other is that it is true that healthy gut microbiota

1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:08.860
 have been shown to improve symptoms

1:24:08.860 --> 1:24:11.160
 of certain psychiatric illnesses,

1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:15.600
 as well as certain conditions like particular features

1:24:15.600 --> 1:24:17.920
 along the autism spectrum, which is interesting.

1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:21.880
 And those effects are probably due to not just improvement

1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:25.480
 of immune system function, but to the conditions

1:24:25.480 --> 1:24:29.140
 in which the neurons that sense nutrients

1:24:29.140 --> 1:24:30.720
 convey information to the brain

1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:34.280
 and increase levels of serotonin and or dopamine.

1:24:34.280 --> 1:24:37.400
 So gut microbiome provides kind of a foundation

1:24:37.400 --> 1:24:41.160
 for healthy gut and healthy gut brain access.

1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:42.860
 So much so that some people report

1:24:42.860 --> 1:24:45.440
 that when they start eating small bits,

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:47.640
 because it doesn't require a lot of fermented foods,

1:24:47.640 --> 1:24:49.080
 that their overall mood is better,

1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:50.560
 not unlike the effects of EPA,

1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:53.220
 although I don't think it's been looked at directly

1:24:53.220 --> 1:24:55.760
 in the context of clinical depression yet.

1:24:55.760 --> 1:24:57.440
 And if someone knows of a study,

1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:00.680
 please mention it in the comments, that would be terrific.

1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:02.200
 There are some things that you can do

1:25:02.200 --> 1:25:04.540
 to really damage your gut microbiome.

1:25:04.540 --> 1:25:06.860
 And this is where there's a huge misconception

1:25:06.860 --> 1:25:08.480
 that I want to clear up.

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:10.600
 There was a study that was published in Nature,

1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:13.960
 which is among the three top journals that we have

1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:15.760
 in Science, you know, Nature, Science, and Cell

1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:19.440
 are considered the top tops, but excellent journal

1:25:19.440 --> 1:25:21.880
 that showed that artificial sweeteners,

1:25:21.880 --> 1:25:25.440
 but a particular artificial sweetener, which was saccharin,

1:25:25.440 --> 1:25:30.060
 can disrupt the gut microbiome in ways that is detrimental

1:25:30.060 --> 1:25:32.120
 to a number of different health markers,

1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:34.520
 increasing inflammatory cytokines,

1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:36.720
 and all the other bad things that happen

1:25:36.720 --> 1:25:41.420
 when the gut microbiome is thrown off kilter.

1:25:41.420 --> 1:25:43.740
 That study was widely discussed,

1:25:43.740 --> 1:25:46.300
 but there were a few things that were not mentioned there

1:25:46.300 --> 1:25:47.680
 that are really important.

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:50.860
 That study was about saccharin in particular.

1:25:52.220 --> 1:25:56.400
 Saccharin is not the most typical artificial sweetener

1:25:56.400 --> 1:25:57.240
 that's used.

1:25:57.240 --> 1:25:59.640
 The most typical artificial sweeteners that are used

1:25:59.640 --> 1:26:03.180
 are things like aspartame, so-called NutraSweet,

1:26:03.180 --> 1:26:05.640
 or sucralose, or these days, stevia.

1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:06.480
 There's monk fruits.

1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:08.780
 To my knowledge, and please correct me

1:26:08.780 --> 1:26:11.600
 if anyone knows of any studies, to my knowledge,

1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:15.900
 the negative effects of these artificial sweeteners

1:26:15.900 --> 1:26:20.080
 on the gut microbiome were restricted to saccharin.

1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:23.360
 Now, there is enough chemical similarity between saccharin

1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:25.160
 and some of the other ones that I mentioned,

1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:25.980
 but not all of them.

1:26:25.980 --> 1:26:29.680
 For instance, stevia, monk fruit are distinct

1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:31.320
 in their chemical makeup,

1:26:31.320 --> 1:26:35.800
 so that they probably don't have, if they have any,

1:26:35.800 --> 1:26:38.760
 have lower effects, negative effects on the gut microbiome,

1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:40.560
 but it should still be tested.

1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:42.640
 So saccharin is really,

1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:45.000
 it was shown in this study and several other studies,

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:48.480
 can really negatively impact, excuse me,

1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:51.520
 the quality of the gut microbiome.

1:26:51.520 --> 1:26:54.380
 Interestingly, the narrative around artificial sweeteners

1:26:54.380 --> 1:26:58.920
 in gut microbiome is incorrect.

1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:01.760
 Most people thought, oh, saccharin is bad

1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:04.840
 for the microbiome, it must kill the microbiome.

1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:06.480
 And so you hear people saying, oh, you know,

1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:08.300
 artificial sweeteners kill the microbiome.

1:27:08.300 --> 1:27:09.140
 That's not true at all.

1:27:09.140 --> 1:27:11.720
 In fact, in that very same study published in Nature,

1:27:11.720 --> 1:27:14.380
 they showed that the negative effects of saccharin

1:27:14.380 --> 1:27:17.500
 on the microbiome could be blocked or eliminated

1:27:17.500 --> 1:27:19.640
 by giving antibiotics.

1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:22.240
 So what happens is certain artificial sweeteners,

1:27:22.240 --> 1:27:26.240
 in particular saccharin, disrupt the microbiome

1:27:26.240 --> 1:27:29.120
 and make the environment within the gut,

1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:33.940
 that mucosal lining, more favorable to bacteria,

1:27:33.940 --> 1:27:38.280
 microbiota that are not good for the organism, okay?

1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:40.280
 This is an important distinction.

1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:42.800
 It's not just that a language thing where people say,

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:44.880
 oh, you know, it kills the microbiome.

1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:48.280
 It doesn't kill the microbiome, it shifts the microbiome.

1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:51.320
 And shifts in the microbiome can be good or they can be bad.

1:27:51.320 --> 1:27:53.480
 And that takes us to another topic.

1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:54.880
 That's a bit of a hot button topic,

1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:55.780
 but I'm willing to go there

1:27:55.780 --> 1:27:58.080
 because I think it deserves conversation,

1:27:58.080 --> 1:28:01.620
 which is nowadays there are many examples out there

1:28:01.620 --> 1:28:04.640
 where people have switched from a kind of standard diet

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:07.720
 or even a vegetarian diet to a,

1:28:07.720 --> 1:28:09.740
 or vegan diet to a keto diet.

1:28:09.740 --> 1:28:11.400
 Now, keto doesn't necessarily have to mean

1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:14.400
 the ingestion of meats, but it can.

1:28:14.400 --> 1:28:17.040
 And they experience positive effects for themselves,

1:28:17.040 --> 1:28:17.880
 not everybody.

1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:20.040
 And I've talked previously about some of the

1:28:20.040 --> 1:28:23.480
 kind of the incorrect,

1:28:23.480 --> 1:28:25.760
 what I believe is incorrect marketing of keto

1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:28.000
 as it relates to the cosmetic effects

1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.040
 and some of the challenges with sleep that some people have,

1:28:30.040 --> 1:28:32.360
 but some people love keto and it works great for them.

1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:35.320
 But the ketogenic diet is interesting

1:28:35.320 --> 1:28:37.880
 because when one shifts to the ketogenic diet,

1:28:37.880 --> 1:28:39.720
 there is a shift in the gut microbiome

1:28:39.720 --> 1:28:41.560
 and some people end up feeling better.

1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:43.800
 Some people end up feeling worse.

1:28:44.860 --> 1:28:49.280
 Likewise, some people go from ingesting animal products,

1:28:49.280 --> 1:28:52.880
 including meat or they're vegetarian and they go to vegan

1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:57.160
 and they experience positive shifts in mood and affect.

1:28:57.160 --> 1:29:01.920
 And we know that the transition to a more plant-based diet

1:29:01.920 --> 1:29:04.400
 and especially the enrichment of fiber

1:29:04.400 --> 1:29:06.680
 that's present in those diets

1:29:06.680 --> 1:29:09.920
 also creates dramatic shifts in the gut microbiome.

1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:11.680
 Some people feel better doing that.

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:12.760
 Some people feel worse.

1:29:12.760 --> 1:29:14.540
 And of course, it's going to depend on whether or not

1:29:14.540 --> 1:29:16.320
 you're ingesting a lot of processed foods or not.

1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:19.720
 There was a paper published in Cell, a Cell Press Journal,

1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:21.120
 obviously, excellent journal,

1:29:21.120 --> 1:29:23.540
 showing that ingestion of processed foods,

1:29:23.540 --> 1:29:26.360
 regardless of whether or not they come from animal sources

1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:28.000
 or non-animal sources,

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:31.440
 the processed foods themselves tend to create activity

1:29:31.440 --> 1:29:33.100
 within the body.

1:29:33.100 --> 1:29:34.960
 And this surely has roots in the nervous system

1:29:34.960 --> 1:29:38.840
 that lead to over-consumption of calories and weight gain,

1:29:38.840 --> 1:29:40.940
 even some weight gain that couldn't be explained

1:29:40.940 --> 1:29:41.840
 by increased calories.

1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:43.380
 In other words, processed foods are bad

1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:44.640
 regardless of whether or not

1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:47.600
 you're talking about animal products or non-animal products.

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:48.700
 Probably not surprising now,

1:29:48.700 --> 1:29:50.700
 given what you know about these sugar sensing

1:29:50.700 --> 1:29:53.300
 and other amino acid sensing cells in the gut

1:29:53.300 --> 1:29:54.820
 that we talked about earlier.

1:29:54.820 --> 1:29:57.160
 So the point of all this is that

1:29:57.160 --> 1:29:59.240
 when I say you have to find what's right for you,

1:29:59.240 --> 1:30:01.180
 that's not a throwaway statement.

1:30:01.180 --> 1:30:06.180
 Some people's microbiome and the lining of their mucosa,

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:10.800
 excuse me, the mucosal lining of their throat,

1:30:10.800 --> 1:30:12.000
 of their gut, of their nose,

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:16.380
 everything is improved by diets that are heavily meat-based

1:30:16.380 --> 1:30:17.480
 and don't have many plants.

1:30:17.480 --> 1:30:20.300
 Other people do much better on a plant-based diet

1:30:20.300 --> 1:30:22.480
 without many meat products or animal products.

1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:23.920
 It's highly individual.

1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:26.680
 And this probably has roots in genetic makeup.

1:30:26.680 --> 1:30:30.460
 This probably has roots in what people were raised on,

1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:32.480
 because remember the nervous system,

1:30:32.480 --> 1:30:35.600
 of course, is set up by your genes, your genetic program,

1:30:35.600 --> 1:30:36.760
 but your nervous system,

1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:40.280
 it adapts early in life to your conditions.

1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:41.160
 That's what it's for.

1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:42.440
 The reason you have a nervous system

1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:44.620
 is to move your body appropriately

1:30:44.620 --> 1:30:45.820
 towards things that are good for you

1:30:45.820 --> 1:30:47.080
 and away from things that are not,

1:30:47.080 --> 1:30:50.160
 but also it was designed to adapt.

1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:52.280
 The early life period has this incredible thing

1:30:52.280 --> 1:30:54.260
 about plasticity that we spent a whole month on

1:30:54.260 --> 1:30:56.520
 so that it can change so that, yes, indeed,

1:30:56.520 --> 1:30:57.920
 some people may like certain foods

1:30:57.920 --> 1:31:00.140
 and react to certain foods better than others

1:31:00.140 --> 1:31:03.280
 because of the way that their nervous system was wired,

1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:05.460
 this enteric, as it's called, nervous system

1:31:05.460 --> 1:31:08.320
 that lines the gut and that communicates with the brain.

1:31:08.320 --> 1:31:10.060
 So most of what I've talked about today

1:31:10.060 --> 1:31:12.560
 is black and white.

1:31:12.560 --> 1:31:14.160
 These are things that are present in all of us,

1:31:14.160 --> 1:31:15.560
 the sugar-sensing neurons of the gut,

1:31:15.560 --> 1:31:17.240
 the way the vagus is wired,

1:31:17.240 --> 1:31:20.040
 the fact that omega-3, omega-6s tend to improve,

1:31:20.040 --> 1:31:22.000
 the ratios tend to impact mood

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:25.240
 with high omega-3, omega-6 ratios improving mood.

1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:28.460
 We talked about all sorts of things in the gut-brain

1:31:28.460 --> 1:31:32.320
 and body-brain axis, but when it comes to the microbiome,

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:34.740
 the key thing is that we all have a microbiome.

1:31:34.740 --> 1:31:36.200
 You want a microbiome,

1:31:36.200 --> 1:31:40.320
 but you want to promote the microbiome that is right for you

1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:43.080
 and that can be shifted and steered

1:31:43.080 --> 1:31:47.320
 by ingesting certain categories of foods and not others.

1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:49.120
 And one thing that really frustrates me

1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:51.360
 is when the people show up with an agenda,

1:31:51.360 --> 1:31:55.680
 like all meat agenda or a vegan agenda or a keto agenda,

1:31:55.680 --> 1:31:57.320
 and they talk about these positive effects

1:31:57.320 --> 1:32:00.240
 on the gut microbiome and it's all true, frankly,

1:32:00.240 --> 1:32:01.440
 and so it's highly individual.

1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:03.600
 Now, this doesn't get to any of the ethical issues

1:32:03.600 --> 1:32:05.000
 around animals or the planet

1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:10.000
 or and you hear rabid debates about that on both sides.

1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:13.980
 And I am not qualified or equipped to talk about

1:32:13.980 --> 1:32:17.200
 whether or not regenerative agriculture, animal products

1:32:17.200 --> 1:32:18.400
 or farming or any of these things,

1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:20.540
 how those actually impact the environment.

1:32:20.540 --> 1:32:22.220
 That is not my expertise.

1:32:22.220 --> 1:32:24.520
 But when it comes to your health and your microbiome,

1:32:24.520 --> 1:32:26.040
 you want to support the microbiome.

1:32:26.040 --> 1:32:28.460
 It's very clear that these fermented foods

1:32:28.460 --> 1:32:30.040
 support the microbiome,

1:32:30.040 --> 1:32:33.640
 that we should be ingesting at least two servings per day,

1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:35.280
 which is quite a lot.

1:32:35.280 --> 1:32:38.760
 That supplementation at low levels can be good.

1:32:38.760 --> 1:32:41.280
 Supplementation at high levels can create this brain fog,

1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:44.240
 even though some people say that result is controversial.

1:32:44.240 --> 1:32:45.520
 I've experienced this myself

1:32:45.520 --> 1:32:49.080
 and the data looked to me pretty darn solid.

1:32:49.080 --> 1:32:52.560
 So that's one thing to think about as well.

1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:55.480
 And the other thing about the gut microbiome

1:32:55.480 --> 1:32:57.180
 is that it's highly contextual

1:32:57.180 --> 1:32:58.700
 based on other things that you're doing.

1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:01.440
 So even things like exercise and social wellbeing

1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:03.480
 and connection, those things are also impacting

1:33:03.480 --> 1:33:04.320
 the gut microbiome.

1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:06.280
 So find the diet that's right for you

1:33:06.280 --> 1:33:10.360
 and that works for you in the context of the other ethical

1:33:10.360 --> 1:33:12.380
 and lifestyle choices that are important to you.

1:33:12.380 --> 1:33:13.440
 That's my advice.

1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:14.980
 A note about fasting.

1:33:14.980 --> 1:33:16.160
 I have a colleague at Yale

1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:18.040
 who's an expert in the gut microbiome.

1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:20.560
 And he told me something really interesting,

1:33:20.560 --> 1:33:23.000
 which is when we fast,

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:27.880
 we actually digest certain components

1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:29.980
 within our dietary tract.

1:33:29.980 --> 1:33:33.320
 It actually depletes a good amount of the gut microbiome.

1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:34.240
 And this is interesting.

1:33:34.240 --> 1:33:36.700
 I've had good results from,

1:33:36.700 --> 1:33:38.120
 I guess you would call it intermittent

1:33:38.120 --> 1:33:40.040
 or kind of circadian type fasting

1:33:40.040 --> 1:33:41.400
 where I've never done long fast,

1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:43.840
 but where I push out my first meal by a few hours.

1:33:43.840 --> 1:33:46.640
 My first meal is generally around lunchtime or so.

1:33:46.640 --> 1:33:49.280
 But the longer periods of fasting

1:33:49.280 --> 1:33:51.240
 that go for a day or two or three days

1:33:51.240 --> 1:33:56.180
 are known to deplete the gut microbiome in major ways.

1:33:56.180 --> 1:33:58.120
 But that's not always necessarily a bad thing

1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:01.100
 because when it's replenished,

1:34:01.100 --> 1:34:03.440
 it often is replenished at levels

1:34:03.440 --> 1:34:05.600
 that exceeded its previous level.

1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:09.200
 But I think that some of the GI tract

1:34:09.200 --> 1:34:10.920
 and even some of the mental effects

1:34:10.920 --> 1:34:12.580
 of returning to eating after feeding,

1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:14.640
 sometimes people don't feel so good when they start eating,

1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:16.360
 they really want food, but then they start eating again,

1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:18.240
 they don't feel as good as they did on the fast.

1:34:18.240 --> 1:34:20.800
 Some of that may be related to the depletion

1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:23.120
 of the microbiome that occurs during long fast.

1:34:23.120 --> 1:34:24.800
 So again, this is something to think about

1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:26.440
 and talk about with your doctor.

1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:31.000
 But the idea that fasting across the board is good,

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:32.320
 there may be some merits to that,

1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:33.700
 and certainly in some cases,

1:34:33.700 --> 1:34:36.640
 but it does deplete the microbiome.

1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:38.960
 And that depletion of the microbiome is significant

1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:41.160
 because it means when you return to eating,

1:34:41.160 --> 1:34:43.160
 you're actually not in the same position

1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:45.200
 to digest and assimilate those foods.

1:34:45.200 --> 1:34:47.060
 And those foods are not in the same position

1:34:47.060 --> 1:34:48.280
 to impact your brain and body

1:34:48.280 --> 1:34:50.920
 the same way they were prior to the fast.

1:34:50.920 --> 1:34:52.480
 And this is, I think, why people suggest

1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:56.760
 a kind of gradual transition back to consuming nutrients

1:34:56.760 --> 1:34:58.280
 after a fast.

1:34:58.280 --> 1:35:01.500
 So as we round up, I want to share some results with you

1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:04.680
 that without question will impact the way

1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:08.780
 that you respond to food mentally and even physically.

1:35:08.780 --> 1:35:11.500
 And I know that because that's the central theme

1:35:11.500 --> 1:35:13.860
 of the studies I'm about to tell you about.

1:35:13.860 --> 1:35:16.680
 I have a colleague at Stanford, Aaliyah Crum,

1:35:16.680 --> 1:35:20.880
 who's done some remarkable experiments on mindset.

1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:24.620
 And some people could think about these as placebo effects

1:35:24.620 --> 1:35:26.120
 or belief effects,

1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.460
 but they actually go way beyond those terms.

1:35:29.460 --> 1:35:32.300
 And there are a number of different examples of this

1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:35.440
 that Aaliyah's lab and her coworkers have demonstrated,

1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:39.660
 but two that are particularly interesting to me,

1:35:39.660 --> 1:35:40.700
 I want to share with you now

1:35:40.700 --> 1:35:44.100
 because they really emphasize how our beliefs

1:35:44.100 --> 1:35:45.340
 can really impact the way

1:35:45.340 --> 1:35:47.560
 that our brain and body work together.

1:35:47.560 --> 1:35:50.080
 I think the most famous of these is an experiment they did

1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:52.100
 where they had two groups of individuals.

1:35:52.100 --> 1:35:55.740
 They were each given a milkshake

1:35:55.740 --> 1:35:59.840
 and they had some factors measured from their blood

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:02.260
 by an IV while they ingested the milkshake

1:36:02.260 --> 1:36:04.340
 and then afterwards as well.

1:36:04.340 --> 1:36:06.760
 And one of the factors that they were looking at

1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:10.740
 was something called ghrelin, G-H-R-E-L-I-N.

1:36:10.740 --> 1:36:13.820
 Ghrelin is a peptide that increases with hunger.

1:36:13.820 --> 1:36:16.280
 So the longer you haven't eaten, the ghrelin goes up.

1:36:16.280 --> 1:36:18.740
 And I know some of you say, well, I fast, I fast, I fast,

1:36:18.740 --> 1:36:19.980
 and I eventually lose my appetite.

1:36:19.980 --> 1:36:22.140
 Well, ghrelin still goes up and then it drops.

1:36:22.140 --> 1:36:24.020
 So if you were one of these people

1:36:24.020 --> 1:36:26.140
 that eats every three hours regularly,

1:36:26.140 --> 1:36:28.000
 ghrelin kind of gets a little pulse

1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.540
 as you get to that two hour and 50 minute mark.

1:36:30.540 --> 1:36:32.340
 So it's a little bit of a timer as well.

1:36:32.340 --> 1:36:34.740
 It's really interesting peptide.

1:36:34.740 --> 1:36:39.020
 In any event, what they did is they gave people milkshakes,

1:36:39.020 --> 1:36:42.580
 two groups, one group got a shake that they were told

1:36:42.580 --> 1:36:44.700
 was a low calorie, healthy shake.

1:36:44.700 --> 1:36:48.300
 The other group got a milkshake that they were told

1:36:48.300 --> 1:36:52.180
 was the very decadent high calorie shake.

1:36:52.180 --> 1:36:53.620
 I think it was something like two

1:36:53.620 --> 1:36:55.140
 or maybe even two and a half times

1:36:55.140 --> 1:36:58.760
 as many calories as the other, perhaps even more.

1:36:58.760 --> 1:36:59.700
 I don't recall the details,

1:36:59.700 --> 1:37:02.220
 but you had a high calorie and a low calorie condition.

1:37:02.220 --> 1:37:04.580
 And then they drank the shake

1:37:04.580 --> 1:37:08.420
 and then they measured ghrelin in these subjects' blood.

1:37:08.420 --> 1:37:12.060
 And what they found was that the high calorie shake

1:37:12.060 --> 1:37:15.980
 had a much more robust effect on blunting ghrelin

1:37:15.980 --> 1:37:18.660
 and reducing ghrelin.

1:37:18.660 --> 1:37:20.900
 But the interesting thing you probably guessed already

1:37:20.900 --> 1:37:24.580
 is that it was the exact same shake given to both groups.

1:37:24.580 --> 1:37:28.760
 So people's belief about the content of something

1:37:28.760 --> 1:37:31.260
 impacted their physiology.

1:37:31.260 --> 1:37:35.260
 And this speaks to the so-called top-down mechanisms

1:37:35.260 --> 1:37:37.500
 or modulation of our physiology.

1:37:37.500 --> 1:37:38.740
 In the previous episode about pain,

1:37:38.740 --> 1:37:42.100
 we talked about the effects of obsessive,

1:37:42.100 --> 1:37:44.700
 believe it or not, it was kind of obsessive infatuation

1:37:44.700 --> 1:37:47.660
 and love on pain responses and pain thresholds.

1:37:47.660 --> 1:37:50.020
 This is yet another example where beliefs

1:37:50.020 --> 1:37:52.940
 or subjective feelings can impact physiology

1:37:52.940 --> 1:37:54.080
 at the level of the periphery,

1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:57.660
 because ghrelin is released in the periphery in the body.

1:37:57.660 --> 1:38:01.680
 Now, these belief effects extend beyond examples like this.

1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:03.440
 Another good example that I'd like to share

1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:08.440
 is Allie, Dr. Crum, and her colleagues did an experiment

1:38:09.780 --> 1:38:12.620
 where they took housekeepers,

1:38:12.620 --> 1:38:14.180
 they were essentially hotel workers,

1:38:14.180 --> 1:38:15.400
 divide them into two groups.

1:38:15.400 --> 1:38:17.140
 They had them watch a short film.

1:38:17.140 --> 1:38:20.620
 In one case, the film was about how their work was important,

1:38:20.620 --> 1:38:22.400
 it helped people feel comfortable in the hotel,

1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:23.740
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:38:23.740 --> 1:38:25.680
 The other group heard that the activity

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:28.500
 that they were doing, cleaning and taking care of the hotel

1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:30.540
 was good for them, it was good for their health,

1:38:30.540 --> 1:38:31.540
 et cetera, et cetera.

1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:34.940
 They controlled very nicely in the study

1:38:34.940 --> 1:38:38.960
 for health parameters, for individual differences,

1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:40.820
 and for the behaviors of these people

1:38:40.820 --> 1:38:43.820
 in the period that followed this short tutorial.

1:38:43.820 --> 1:38:47.700
 And what they found was eight weeks later,

1:38:47.700 --> 1:38:49.620
 the group that had been told

1:38:49.620 --> 1:38:51.860
 that the activity was good for them

1:38:51.860 --> 1:38:53.500
 showed lower blood pressure,

1:38:53.500 --> 1:38:56.060
 they had lost a significant amount of body fat,

1:38:56.060 --> 1:38:58.620
 and they reported enjoying their work

1:38:58.620 --> 1:39:00.040
 far more than the other group.

1:39:00.040 --> 1:39:04.740
 The same work, simply biased mentally

1:39:04.740 --> 1:39:06.500
 by the information that they were given,

1:39:06.500 --> 1:39:10.740
 but their physiology followed that information.

1:39:10.740 --> 1:39:14.140
 And so this is not just the placebo effect,

1:39:14.140 --> 1:39:16.540
 this is an incredible set of findings

1:39:16.540 --> 1:39:18.140
 that illustrate the extent to which

1:39:18.140 --> 1:39:21.000
 whether or not we believe a food is going to be good for us

1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:24.620
 or not good for us, well, we can't escape the reality.

1:39:24.620 --> 1:39:26.180
 You can't tell yourself that a poison

1:39:26.180 --> 1:39:27.980
 is going to be good for you and ingest that poison

1:39:27.980 --> 1:39:29.980
 and expect it to not kill you,

1:39:29.980 --> 1:39:34.980
 nor can you tell yourself that eating 12 croissants,

1:39:35.180 --> 1:39:36.500
 confess I've done it,

1:39:36.500 --> 1:39:39.100
 it was after a very long run, a long time ago,

1:39:39.100 --> 1:39:41.140
 but you can't tell yourself that that's necessarily

1:39:41.140 --> 1:39:42.960
 going to be good for you

1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:44.940
 or that it's going to make you lose weight.

1:39:44.940 --> 1:39:48.040
 These belief effects are not about lying to yourself.

1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:50.780
 In these cases, in these experiments, as you'll notice,

1:39:50.780 --> 1:39:54.620
 the subjects didn't have prior knowledge about ghrelin

1:39:54.620 --> 1:39:56.900
 or about the effects of their daily routine

1:39:56.900 --> 1:39:58.940
 on weight loss and blood pressure.

1:39:58.940 --> 1:40:00.080
 So in order for them to work,

1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:03.700
 you have to be naive to the information, right?

1:40:03.700 --> 1:40:05.300
 You can't simply lie to yourself

1:40:05.300 --> 1:40:07.740
 and tell yourself what you want to believe.

1:40:07.740 --> 1:40:11.060
 And that's important, but also important

1:40:11.060 --> 1:40:12.940
 is that the mind and the body

1:40:12.940 --> 1:40:14.780
 are in this fascinating interplay.

1:40:14.780 --> 1:40:16.780
 And today we've talked mainly about

1:40:16.780 --> 1:40:20.580
 how the body and things that we put inside this tube,

1:40:20.580 --> 1:40:24.220
 this that runs from our mouth to the other end,

1:40:24.220 --> 1:40:28.040
 to our rectum basically is impacting all these cells,

1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:31.180
 these neurons, microbiota in there,

1:40:31.180 --> 1:40:34.060
 mucosal lining, heart, lungs,

1:40:34.060 --> 1:40:36.160
 and how all that information is feeding up to the brain

1:40:36.160 --> 1:40:38.080
 to impact how we feel up here.

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:39.700
 But also how we feel up here

1:40:39.700 --> 1:40:42.380
 is impacting how our body reacts

1:40:42.380 --> 1:40:44.860
 at levels of very core physiology

1:40:44.860 --> 1:40:46.840
 that you couldn't just tell yourself

1:40:46.840 --> 1:40:47.860
 that this was going to work.

1:40:47.860 --> 1:40:51.100
 But what you believe about certain substances,

1:40:51.100 --> 1:40:52.980
 certain foods, certain nutrients

1:40:52.980 --> 1:40:54.500
 does have a profound effect

1:40:54.500 --> 1:40:57.260
 on the magnitude of their impact

1:40:57.260 --> 1:41:01.320
 and sometimes even the quality and direction of that impact.

1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:03.120
 Well, first of all, I want to thank everybody

1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:05.240
 for their support of this podcast,

1:41:05.240 --> 1:41:07.740
 the response that we've received since releasing

1:41:07.740 --> 1:41:10.260
 at the beginning of the new year has been tremendous

1:41:10.260 --> 1:41:12.340
 and we're so grateful for it.

1:41:12.340 --> 1:41:15.060
 I know some of you and people you know have said,

1:41:15.060 --> 1:41:16.420
 well, it's a lot of information,

1:41:16.420 --> 1:41:18.260
 it's like a college lecture.

1:41:18.260 --> 1:41:19.980
 Indeed, there's a lot of information

1:41:19.980 --> 1:41:24.020
 but I believe very strongly that if you learn mechanism

1:41:24.020 --> 1:41:26.620
 and maybe even if you hear it several times over,

1:41:26.620 --> 1:41:28.620
 eventually those mechanisms become embedded

1:41:28.620 --> 1:41:31.460
 into the way that you view an entire topic.

1:41:31.460 --> 1:41:34.560
 As well, I always try and put tools as I go along

1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:36.460
 that you can look to immediately.

1:41:36.460 --> 1:41:39.140
 Some of them might be right for you, others might not.

1:41:39.140 --> 1:41:41.900
 Try them if you like and don't if you don't want to

1:41:41.900 --> 1:41:44.400
 and if they don't work for you, then discard them.

1:41:44.400 --> 1:41:47.520
 If however, you are finding benefits from the information

1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:49.580
 and from the tools and you know others

1:41:49.580 --> 1:41:51.480
 that you think could benefit from it,

1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:55.020
 please pass along information about the podcast.

1:42:04.060 --> 1:42:05.460

1:42:07.560 --> 1:42:09.680
 All those things really help us.

1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:12.640
 In addition, if you'd like to support the podcast further,

1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:14.220
 we've set up a Patreon account.

1:42:14.220 --> 1:42:17.460
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:42:17.460 --> 1:42:19.140
 It allows you to support the podcast

1:42:19.140 --> 1:42:20.940
 at a variety of levels.

1:42:20.940 --> 1:42:24.460
 We have the 5HTP serotonin for $5 a month,

1:42:24.460 --> 1:42:28.580
 the Costello, $10 a month in honor of Costello, et cetera.

1:42:28.580 --> 1:42:30.220
 You don't have to, but if you'd like to,

1:42:30.220 --> 1:42:31.640
 that would be terrific.

1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:33.500
 In addition, please check out our sponsors

1:42:33.500 --> 1:42:35.620
 that we've mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.

1:42:35.620 --> 1:42:37.880
 That's one of the best ways to help support us.

1:42:37.880 --> 1:42:41.480
 And we do believe in all the products that we support

1:42:41.480 --> 1:42:43.060
 and our sponsors very much.

1:42:43.060 --> 1:42:45.740
 Otherwise, we wouldn't be working with them.

1:42:45.740 --> 1:42:48.900
 So much so that when I mentioned supplements

1:42:48.900 --> 1:42:50.380
 and I talk about supplements

1:42:50.380 --> 1:42:52.360
 throughout the course of the episodes,

1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:53.820
 I don't mention specific brands,

1:42:53.820 --> 1:42:56.720
 but I would be remiss if I didn't mention the fact

1:42:56.720 --> 1:43:01.460
 that we have partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

1:43:01.460 --> 1:43:04.180
 And we've done that because we know

1:43:04.180 --> 1:43:06.620
 that Thorne uses the highest levels of stringency

1:43:06.620 --> 1:43:09.360
 in terms of the products they produce,

1:43:09.360 --> 1:43:12.960
 what they say is in each capsule and tablet actually is,

1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:14.320
 they're used by the Mayo Clinic,

1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:15.700
 by all the major sports teams

1:43:15.700 --> 1:43:18.460
 because of their level of stringency and rigor.

1:43:18.460 --> 1:43:20.580
 If you want to know which supplements I take,

1:43:20.580 --> 1:43:25.580
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman

1:43:25.700 --> 1:43:27.260
 and you can see the supplements that I take

1:43:27.260 --> 1:43:30.500
 and you can get those as well as any of the other supplements

1:43:30.500 --> 1:43:33.140
 and products that Thorne makes for 20% off.

1:43:33.140 --> 1:43:37.980
 So it's thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman

1:43:37.980 --> 1:43:41.900
 to get 20% off any supplements that Thorne makes.

1:43:41.900 --> 1:43:44.300
 So today's episode, we took a full journey

1:43:44.300 --> 1:43:45.980
 into the brain-body relationship

1:43:45.980 --> 1:43:47.800
 and discussed a lot of the mechanisms

1:43:47.800 --> 1:43:50.740
 and the actionable items that you can approach

1:43:50.740 --> 1:43:53.160
 if you want to explore this aspect of your biology

1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:54.740
 and psychology further.

1:43:54.740 --> 1:43:56.900
 Last, but certainly not least,

1:43:56.900 --> 1:43:59.580
 I want to thank everybody for your time and attention today

1:43:59.580 --> 1:44:02.660
 and as always, thank you for your interest in science.

1:44:02.660 --> 1:44:30.660
 I'll see you next time.
