00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.180 --> 00:10.140
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.140 --> 00:12.680
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.680 --> 00:14.620
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.620 --> 00:15.680
 This podcast is separate

00:15.680 --> 00:17.940
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

00:17.940 --> 00:19.960
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:19.960 --> 00:21.860
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:21.860 --> 00:24.240
 about science and science-related tools

00:24.240 --> 00:25.580
 to the general public.

00:25.580 --> 00:26.660
 In keeping with that theme,

00:26.660 --> 00:29.540
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:29.540 --> 00:31.520
 Our first sponsor is Roka.

00:31.520 --> 00:34.640
 Roka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that, in my opinion,

00:34.640 --> 00:36.540
 are the absolute best out there.

00:37.380 --> 00:39.620
 The sunglasses and eyeglasses that are made by Roka

00:39.620 --> 00:41.500
 have a number of properties that are really unique.

00:41.500 --> 00:43.740
 First of all, they're extremely lightweight.

00:43.740 --> 00:45.820
 You never even notice that they're on your face.

00:45.820 --> 00:49.000
 Second, the optical clarity is fantastic.

00:49.000 --> 00:50.900
 One of the things that's really hard to accomplish,

00:50.900 --> 00:53.180
 but that Roka succeeded in accomplishing,

00:53.180 --> 00:55.060
 is making sunglasses that you can wear

00:55.060 --> 00:56.900
 in lots of different environments.

00:56.900 --> 01:00.420
 As you move from bright to shadowed regions, for instance,

01:00.420 --> 01:02.760
 or as the amount of sunlight changes,

01:02.760 --> 01:04.380
 many eyeglasses will make it such

01:04.380 --> 01:05.700
 that it's hard to see your environment

01:05.700 --> 01:07.260
 and you need to take the eyeglasses off

01:07.260 --> 01:09.020
 or you can't see or detect borders.

01:09.020 --> 01:11.980
 With Roka sunglasses, all of that is seamless.

01:11.980 --> 01:15.920
 They clearly understand the adaptation mechanisms

01:15.920 --> 01:17.060
 and habituation mechanisms.

01:17.060 --> 01:19.460
 All these fancy details about the human visual system

01:19.460 --> 01:21.620
 have allowed them to design a sunglass

01:21.620 --> 01:23.220
 that allows you to be in any environment

01:23.220 --> 01:25.560
 and to see that environment extremely well.

01:25.560 --> 01:27.880
 The eyeglasses are terrific.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.200
 I wear readers at night.

01:29.200 --> 01:32.400
 And again, they just make the whole experience of reading

01:32.400 --> 01:35.600
 or working on a screen at night very, very easy,

01:35.600 --> 01:36.800
 very easy on the eyes.

01:36.800 --> 01:38.920
 The aesthetic of the eyeglasses and sunglasses

01:38.920 --> 01:40.120
 is also superb.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.680
 You know, I chuckle sometimes when I see sports frames

01:42.680 --> 01:45.160
 or sports glasses, a lot of them just look ridiculous,

01:45.160 --> 01:47.920
 frankly, but the Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses

01:47.920 --> 01:49.100
 have a terrific aesthetic.

01:49.100 --> 01:51.180
 They have a huge variety to select from.

01:51.180 --> 01:52.720
 If you'd like to try Roka glasses,

01:52.720 --> 01:56.000
 you can go to Roka, that's R-O-K-A.com

01:56.000 --> 01:57.280
 and enter the code Huberman

01:57.280 --> 01:59.520
 and you'll get 20% off your first order.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.960
 That's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman

02:02.960 --> 02:05.200
 to get 20% off your first order.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.760
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

02:08.760 --> 02:11.320
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

02:11.320 --> 02:14.140
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

02:14.140 --> 02:15.720
 to help you better understand your body

02:15.720 --> 02:17.880
 and help you reach your health goals.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.520
 I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done

02:20.520 --> 02:23.240
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

02:23.240 --> 02:25.440
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

02:25.440 --> 02:28.920
 can only be detected from a quality blood test.

02:28.920 --> 02:31.320
 One of the major problems with blood tests, however,

02:31.320 --> 02:34.160
 is that oftentimes you'll get information back

02:34.160 --> 02:37.200
 about levels of metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,

02:37.200 --> 02:38.620
 and there won't be any directives

02:38.620 --> 02:40.720
 about what to do with that information.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.720
 With Inside Tracker, it makes all of that very easy.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.440
 First of all, they can come to your home

02:45.440 --> 02:47.200
 to do the blood test and DNA test,

02:47.200 --> 02:49.440
 or you can go to a local clinic.

02:49.440 --> 02:50.760
 They make that very easy.

02:50.760 --> 02:53.240
 Second of all, when you get the information back

02:53.240 --> 02:55.560
 about the levels of hormones and metabolic factors

02:55.560 --> 02:57.000
 and other things in your blood,

02:57.000 --> 02:58.320
 it gives you simple directives.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.040
 They have a dashboard that allows you to assess,

03:01.040 --> 03:03.160
 for instance, whether or not you ought to make changes

03:03.160 --> 03:05.540
 in your nutrition or changes in your exercise

03:05.540 --> 03:07.320
 or changes in your sleep regimen,

03:07.320 --> 03:08.960
 any number of different lifestyle factors

03:08.960 --> 03:12.400
 that can help bring the markers and the various factors

03:12.400 --> 03:15.500
 in your blood and DNA to the appropriate levels.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.960
 So really they're putting you

03:16.960 --> 03:18.840
 in the driver's seat for your health.

03:18.840 --> 03:20.800
 In fact, one of the listeners

03:20.800 --> 03:22.960
 of this podcast contacted me recently

03:22.960 --> 03:25.040
 and said I took an Inside Tracker test.

03:25.040 --> 03:26.620
 I felt like I was in great health,

03:26.620 --> 03:28.320
 but I noticed from the test

03:28.320 --> 03:31.120
 that I had high CRP, C-reactive protein.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.080
 C-reactive protein is a marker that if it's too high

03:34.080 --> 03:37.920
 is a cautionary note about various cardiac

03:37.920 --> 03:39.500
 and even eye diseases.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.360
 So it's something that they are now taking actions on

03:42.360 --> 03:44.520
 as a consequence of getting their blood work done

03:44.520 --> 03:45.880
 and taking the Inside Tracker test.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.320
 So I think that's just one of many examples

03:48.320 --> 03:49.280
 that we hear about.

03:49.280 --> 03:51.040
 I have examples from my own life, for instance,

03:51.040 --> 03:53.440
 of different factors in my blood being off

03:53.440 --> 03:55.520
 and making adjustments to nutrition

03:55.520 --> 03:57.240
 and other aspects of my life that have allowed me

03:57.240 --> 03:59.160
 to bring those into the proper range.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.520
 So if you care about your health,

04:00.520 --> 04:02.920
 Inside Tracker may very well be right for you.

04:02.920 --> 04:04.880
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

04:04.880 --> 04:07.880
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.040
 And if you do that, you'll get 25% off

04:10.040 --> 04:11.840
 any of Inside Tracker's plans.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.280
 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.340
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

04:17.340 --> 04:19.080
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

04:19.080 --> 04:21.600
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.760
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,

04:24.760 --> 04:27.520
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

04:27.520 --> 04:28.880
 Athletic Greens is terrific

04:28.880 --> 04:31.600
 because it covers your nutritional basis.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.080
 If I drink Athletic Greens once

04:33.080 --> 04:35.280
 and I sometimes drink it twice a day,

04:35.280 --> 04:37.920
 then I'm sure that all the vitamins I need,

04:37.920 --> 04:39.520
 I'm getting those, all the minerals I need,

04:39.520 --> 04:41.640
 I'm getting those, and the probiotics.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.320
 There's now a ton of data

04:43.320 --> 04:45.780
 showing that a healthy gut microbiome

04:45.780 --> 04:48.840
 is vital to brain function, vital to immune function,

04:48.840 --> 04:51.240
 and vital to all aspects of our health.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.160
 So with Athletic Greens, you get the vitamins,

04:53.160 --> 04:56.100
 the minerals, and the probiotics to cover all your bases.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.140
 In fact, anytime people ask me what should they take

04:59.140 --> 05:01.140
 or what could they do to support their health,

05:01.140 --> 05:02.840
 provided that they already have their sleep

05:02.840 --> 05:04.760
 and other aspects of their life in order,

05:04.760 --> 05:06.760
 Athletic Greens is the thing that I recommend

05:06.760 --> 05:09.160
 because it covers all the foundations,

05:09.160 --> 05:12.360
 all the bases of what one really wants from a supplement

05:12.360 --> 05:14.480
 without having to take a ton of different things.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.760
 It also tastes great.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.160
 Almost everybody that tries it

05:17.160 --> 05:18.600
 and that's reported back to me

05:18.600 --> 05:20.360
 has told me that they really like the taste.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.880
 I mix mine with water, a little bit of lemon and lime juice,

05:22.880 --> 05:23.980
 and I really like the taste.

05:23.980 --> 05:25.280
 It's delicious to me.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.280
 I drink it once or twice a day.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.620
 It's keto-compatible.

05:28.620 --> 05:30.900
 It's compatible with most fasting regimens.

05:30.900 --> 05:35.360
 It's compatible with, if you're vegan or if you're not vegan,

05:35.360 --> 05:36.480
 it's compatible with essentially

05:36.480 --> 05:37.880
 every nutritional plan out there.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.400
 So it's just a terrific all-around supplement

05:40.400 --> 05:43.240
 and benefit to one's health and diet.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.680
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

05:44.680 --> 05:47.640
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.640
 And if you do that, you'll claim a special offer.

05:49.640 --> 05:51.280
 They'll give you five free travel packs

05:51.280 --> 05:53.080
 that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens

05:53.080 --> 05:54.140
 while you're on the road.

05:54.140 --> 05:58.120
 And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

05:58.120 --> 06:01.180
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

06:01.180 --> 06:02.880
 to claim that special offer.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.160
 This month, we've been talking about the senses,

06:05.160 --> 06:08.280
 how we detect things in our environment.

06:08.280 --> 06:10.680
 The last episode was all about vision,

06:10.680 --> 06:13.800
 how we take light and convert that information

06:13.800 --> 06:15.560
 into things that we can perceive,

06:15.560 --> 06:18.840
 like colors and faces and motion, things of that sort,

06:18.840 --> 06:21.760
 as well as how we use light to change our biology

06:21.760 --> 06:24.200
 in ways that are subconscious, that we don't realize,

06:24.200 --> 06:28.680
 things like mood and metabolism and levels of alertness.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.540
 Today, we're going to talk about chemical sensing.

06:31.540 --> 06:34.340
 We're going to talk about the sense of smell,

06:34.340 --> 06:37.680
 our ability to detect odors in our environment.

06:37.680 --> 06:39.500
 We're also going to talk about taste,

06:39.500 --> 06:44.060
 our ability to detect chemicals and make sense of chemicals

06:44.060 --> 06:47.760
 that are put in our mouth and into our digestive tract.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.720
 And we are going to talk about chemicals

06:49.720 --> 06:52.240
 that are made by other human beings

06:52.240 --> 06:55.000
 that powerfully modulate the way that we feel,

06:55.000 --> 06:57.460
 our hormones, and our health.

06:57.460 --> 07:01.040
 Now, that last category are sometimes called pheromones.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.120
 However, whether or not pheromones exist in humans

07:04.120 --> 07:05.560
 is rather controversial.

07:05.560 --> 07:08.200
 There actually hasn't been a clear example

07:08.200 --> 07:10.960
 of a true human pheromonal effect,

07:10.960 --> 07:14.160
 but what is absolutely clear, what is undeniable

07:14.160 --> 07:18.060
 is that there are chemicals that human beings make

07:18.060 --> 07:23.060
 and release in things like tears onto our skin and sweat

07:23.700 --> 07:27.080
 and even breath that powerfully modulate

07:27.080 --> 07:30.120
 or control the biology of other individuals.

07:30.120 --> 07:33.680
 In fact, right now, even if you're completely alone,

07:33.680 --> 07:36.380
 your chemical environment internally

07:36.380 --> 07:39.120
 is being controlled by external chemicals.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.320
 Your nervous system and your hormones and your metabolism

07:42.320 --> 07:46.160
 are being modified by things in your environment.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.040
 So we're going to talk about those.

07:48.040 --> 07:51.320
 It's an absolutely fascinating aspect to our biology.

07:51.320 --> 07:54.040
 It's one of our most primordial,

07:54.040 --> 07:56.420
 meaning primitive aspects of our biology,

07:56.420 --> 07:59.620
 but it's still very active in all of us today.

08:00.520 --> 08:01.700
 This episode, believe it or not,

08:01.700 --> 08:04.660
 will have a lot of tools, a lot of protocols.

08:04.660 --> 08:07.280
 Even though I'm guessing most of you

08:07.280 --> 08:10.180
 can probably smell your environment just fine,

08:10.180 --> 08:12.380
 that you know what you like to eat and what tastes good

08:12.380 --> 08:14.840
 and what doesn't taste good to you,

08:14.840 --> 08:16.740
 today's episode is going to talk about tools

08:16.740 --> 08:19.500
 that will allow you to actually leverage

08:19.500 --> 08:21.260
 these chemical sensing mechanisms,

08:21.260 --> 08:23.580
 including how you smell,

08:23.580 --> 08:26.180
 not how you smell in the qualitative sense,

08:26.180 --> 08:28.180
 but how you smell in the verb sense,

08:28.180 --> 08:30.900
 the action of sniffing and smelling

08:30.900 --> 08:33.380
 to enhance your sense of smell

08:33.380 --> 08:35.820
 and to enhance your sense of taste,

08:35.820 --> 08:38.980
 as well, believe it or not, to enhance your cognition,

08:38.980 --> 08:41.500
 your ability to learn and remember things.

08:41.500 --> 08:43.240
 Everything we're going to talk about, as always,

08:43.240 --> 08:45.580
 is grounded in quality peer-reviewed studies

08:45.580 --> 08:47.460
 from some excellent laboratories.

08:47.460 --> 08:49.400
 I'll provide some resources along the way.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.100
 So that means tools and protocols

08:51.100 --> 08:52.360
 and also basic information.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.660
 You're going to learn a ton of neuroscience

08:54.660 --> 08:56.800
 and a lot of biology in general.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.140
 And I think what you'll come to realize by the end

08:59.140 --> 09:01.260
 is that while we are clearly different

09:01.260 --> 09:02.740
 from the other animals,

09:02.740 --> 09:06.700
 there are aspects to our biology that are very similar

09:06.700 --> 09:10.380
 to that of other animals in very interesting ways.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.620
 Before we dive into chemical sensing,

09:12.620 --> 09:14.580
 I want to just briefly touch on a few things

09:14.580 --> 09:16.340
 from the vision episode.

09:16.340 --> 09:18.980
 One is a summary of a protocol.

09:18.980 --> 09:21.940
 So I covered 13 protocols last episode.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.020
 If you haven't seen that episode, check it out.

09:24.020 --> 09:26.540
 Those protocols will allow you to be more alert

09:26.540 --> 09:28.940
 and to see better over time if you follow them.

09:28.940 --> 09:30.080
 All of them are zero cost.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.300
 You can find any and all of them at hubermanlab.com.

09:33.300 --> 09:36.560
 There's a link to those videos and tools and protocols.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.860
 Everything is timestamped.

09:39.300 --> 09:42.620
 The two protocols that I just want to remind everybody of

09:43.660 --> 09:46.760
 are the protocol of near-far viewing,

09:46.760 --> 09:50.060
 that all of us, regardless of age,

09:50.060 --> 09:53.060
 should probably spend about five minutes,

09:53.060 --> 09:56.740
 three times a week, doing some near-far viewing exercises.

09:56.740 --> 09:59.260
 So that would be bringing a pen or pencil up close

09:59.260 --> 10:01.380
 to the point where you're about to cross your eyes,

10:01.380 --> 10:03.100
 but you don't cross your eyes,

10:03.100 --> 10:04.800
 and then out at some distance,

10:04.800 --> 10:08.300
 and then look beyond that pen or other object

10:08.300 --> 10:11.100
 that you're using, off as far as you can into the distance.

10:11.100 --> 10:13.220
 It would be great if you could do this on a balcony or deck

10:13.220 --> 10:14.860
 and then look way off in the distance

10:14.860 --> 10:16.100
 and then bring it back in.

10:16.100 --> 10:19.040
 This is going to exercise that accommodation reflex,

10:19.040 --> 10:20.980
 the change in the shape of the lens

10:20.980 --> 10:23.300
 can help offset a number of things,

10:23.300 --> 10:25.720
 including myopia, nearsightedness.

10:25.720 --> 10:28.580
 The other one is this incredible study

10:28.580 --> 10:31.620
 that showed that two hours a day outside,

10:31.620 --> 10:34.140
 even if you're doing other things while you're outside,

10:34.140 --> 10:37.240
 can help offset myopia and nearsightedness.

10:37.240 --> 10:38.660
 So try and get outside.

10:38.660 --> 10:40.880
 It's really the sunlight and the blue light, right?

10:40.880 --> 10:42.620
 Everyone's been demonizing blue light out there,

10:42.620 --> 10:43.900
 but blue light is great,

10:43.900 --> 10:45.740
 provided it's not super, super bright

10:46.700 --> 10:48.140
 and really close to your eyes.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.020
 Blue light is terrific if it comes from sunlight.

10:51.020 --> 10:54.180
 Two hours a day outside is going to help offset myopia,

10:54.180 --> 10:55.020
 nearsightedness.

10:55.020 --> 10:56.360
 Now, that's a lot of time.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.520
 I think most of us are not getting that time,

10:58.520 --> 11:01.260
 but since you can do other things like gardening or reading

11:01.260 --> 11:03.140
 or walking or running,

11:03.140 --> 11:04.740
 if you can get that two hours outside,

11:04.740 --> 11:08.060
 your visual system and your brain will benefit.

11:08.060 --> 11:11.140
 I also would like to make one brief correction

11:11.140 --> 11:13.340
 to something that I said incorrectly

11:13.340 --> 11:15.080
 in the previous episode.

11:15.080 --> 11:18.480
 At the end of the episode, I talked about lutein

11:18.480 --> 11:22.740
 and how lutein may help offset some moderate

11:22.740 --> 11:25.460
 to severe age-related macular degeneration.

11:25.460 --> 11:27.560
 As well, I talked about how some people are supplementing

11:27.560 --> 11:29.660
 with lutein even though they don't have

11:29.660 --> 11:31.700
 age-related macular degeneration,

11:31.700 --> 11:33.580
 with the idea in mind that it might help

11:33.580 --> 11:36.740
 offset some vision loss as they get older.

11:36.740 --> 11:40.280
 I said lutein, and lutein was the correct thing to say,

11:40.280 --> 11:43.940
 but once or twice when I started speaking fast,

11:43.940 --> 11:47.440
 I said leucine and not lutein.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.700
 I want to emphasize that leucine and amino acid,

11:50.700 --> 11:52.780
 very interesting, important for muscle building,

11:52.780 --> 11:54.520
 covered in previous episodes,

11:54.520 --> 11:59.220
 but lutein, L-U-T-E-I-N,

11:59.220 --> 12:01.860
 is the molecule and compound that I was referring to

12:01.860 --> 12:04.500
 in terms of supplementing for sake of vision.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.720
 So I apologize, please forgive me, I misspoke.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.920
 A couple of you caught that right away.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.820
 In listening to the episode after it went up,

12:11.820 --> 12:13.620
 I realized that I had misspoken.

12:13.620 --> 12:17.340
 So lutein for vision, leucine for muscles

12:17.340 --> 12:20.100
 and muscle growth and strength, et cetera.

12:20.100 --> 12:23.020
 Before we dive into the content of today's episode,

12:23.020 --> 12:25.800
 I want to just briefly touch on color vision.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.380
 Many of you asked questions about color vision

12:28.380 --> 12:31.620
 and color perception, and indeed color perception

12:31.620 --> 12:35.060
 is a fascinating aspect of the human visual system.

12:35.060 --> 12:37.140
 It's one of the things that makes us unique.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.340
 There are certainly other animals out there

12:39.340 --> 12:41.520
 that can detect all the colors of the rainbow.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.700
 Some can even detect into the infrared

12:43.700 --> 12:47.420
 and to the far red that we can't see,

12:47.420 --> 12:49.140
 but nonetheless, human color vision,

12:49.140 --> 12:51.160
 provided that somebody isn't colorblind,

12:51.160 --> 12:53.060
 is really remarkable.

12:53.060 --> 12:55.160
 And if you're interested in color vision

12:55.160 --> 12:58.380
 or you want to answer questions about art

12:58.380 --> 13:00.900
 or about, for instance, why that dress

13:00.900 --> 13:02.540
 that showed up online a few years ago

13:02.540 --> 13:05.160
 looks blue to you and yellow to somebody else,

13:05.160 --> 13:07.980
 all the answers to that are in this terrific book,

13:07.980 --> 13:09.660
 which is, What is Color?

13:09.660 --> 13:12.440
 15 questions and answers on the science of color.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.820
 I did not write this book, I wish I had.

13:14.820 --> 13:17.580
 The book is by Ariel and Joan Ekstut,

13:17.580 --> 13:20.380
 that's E-C-K-S-T-U-T.

13:20.380 --> 13:21.780
 So it's, What is Color?

13:21.780 --> 13:25.620
 50 questions and answers on the science of color.

13:25.620 --> 13:27.100
 It's an absolutely fabulous book.

13:27.100 --> 13:29.220
 I have no business relationship to them.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.300
 I did help them get in contact

13:31.300 --> 13:32.860
 with some color vision scientists

13:32.860 --> 13:34.300
 when they reached out to me.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.260
 And you can know that all the information in the book

13:36.260 --> 13:39.160
 was vetted by excellent color vision scientists.

13:39.160 --> 13:41.100
 It's a really wonderful and beautiful book.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.600
 The illustrations are beautiful.

13:42.600 --> 13:46.280
 If you're somebody who's interested in design or art,

13:46.280 --> 13:48.340
 or you're just curious about the science of color,

13:48.340 --> 13:50.400
 it's a terrific book, I highly recommend it.

13:50.400 --> 13:51.840
 If you just look it up online,

13:51.840 --> 13:53.240
 there are a variety of places

13:53.240 --> 13:55.200
 that will allow you to access the book.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.400
 So let's talk about sensing chemicals

13:57.400 --> 13:59.520
 and how chemicals control us.

14:00.400 --> 14:01.400
 In our environment,

14:01.400 --> 14:04.700
 there are a lot of different physical stimuli.

14:04.700 --> 14:09.020
 There is light photons, which are light energy,

14:09.020 --> 14:11.520
 and those land on your retinas

14:11.520 --> 14:13.860
 and your retinas tell your brain about them

14:13.860 --> 14:16.900
 and your brain creates this thing we call vision.

14:16.900 --> 14:19.180
 There are sound waves, literally particles

14:19.180 --> 14:22.200
 moving through the air and reverberations

14:22.200 --> 14:25.540
 that create what we call sound and hearing.

14:25.540 --> 14:29.260
 And of course, there are mechanical stimuli,

14:29.260 --> 14:34.260
 pressure, light touch, scratch, tickle, et cetera,

14:34.480 --> 14:37.020
 that lands on our skin or the blowing of a breeze

14:37.020 --> 14:39.400
 that deflects the hairs on our skin.

14:39.400 --> 14:44.400
 And we can sense mechanical touch, mechanical sensation.

14:44.600 --> 14:46.180
 And there are chemicals.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.420
 There are things floating around in the environment,

14:49.420 --> 14:52.620
 which we call volatile chemicals.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.860
 So volatile sounds oftentimes like emotionally volatile,

14:55.860 --> 14:58.380
 but it just means that they're floating around out there.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.980
 So when you actually smell something,

15:00.980 --> 15:04.960
 like let's say you smell a wonderfully smelling rose

15:04.960 --> 15:09.960
 or cake, yes, you are inhaling the particles into your nose.

15:09.960 --> 15:12.300
 There are literally little particles of those chemicals

15:12.300 --> 15:14.220
 are going up into your nose

15:14.220 --> 15:16.840
 and being detected by your brain.

15:18.100 --> 15:21.740
 Also, if you smell something putrid, disgusting, or awful,

15:21.740 --> 15:23.840
 use your imagination.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.740
 Those particles are going up into your nose

15:26.740 --> 15:30.540
 and being detected by neurons that are part of your brain.

15:31.660 --> 15:34.420
 Other ways of getting chemicals into our system

15:34.420 --> 15:37.420
 is by putting them in our mouth,

15:37.420 --> 15:41.500
 by literally taking foods and chewing them

15:41.500 --> 15:43.780
 or sucking on them and breaking them down

15:43.780 --> 15:45.400
 into their component parts.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.300
 And that's one way that we sense chemicals

15:47.300 --> 15:50.020
 with this thing, our tongue.

15:50.020 --> 15:53.100
 And there are chemicals that can enter

15:53.100 --> 15:57.100
 through other mucosal linings and other kind of,

15:57.100 --> 16:00.340
 just think damp, sticky linings of your body.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.780
 And the main ones would be the eyes.

16:02.780 --> 16:04.860
 So you've got your nose, your eyes, and your mouth,

16:04.860 --> 16:07.620
 but mainly when we have chemicals coming into our system,

16:07.620 --> 16:10.260
 it's through our nose or through our mouth.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.840
 Although sometimes through our skin,

16:12.840 --> 16:15.220
 certain things can go transdermal, not many,

16:15.220 --> 16:17.060
 and through our eyes.

16:17.060 --> 16:21.580
 So these chemicals, we sometimes bring into our body,

16:21.580 --> 16:24.900
 into our biology through deliberate action.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.760
 We select a food, we chew that food,

16:27.760 --> 16:28.940
 and we do it intentionally.

16:28.940 --> 16:31.100
 Sometimes they're coming into our body

16:31.100 --> 16:32.820
 through non-deliberate action.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.340
 We enter an environment and there's smoke

16:35.340 --> 16:37.660
 and we smell the smoke, and as a consequence,

16:37.660 --> 16:39.260
 we take action.

16:39.260 --> 16:41.460
 Sometimes we are forced to eat something

16:41.460 --> 16:43.260
 because somebody tells us we should eat it

16:43.260 --> 16:44.780
 or we do it to be polite.

16:44.780 --> 16:46.140
 So there are all these ways that chemicals

16:46.140 --> 16:48.480
 can make it into our body.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.580
 Sometimes, however, other people are actively

16:51.580 --> 16:53.720
 making chemicals with their body.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.500
 Typically this would be with their breath,

16:56.500 --> 16:59.580
 with their tears, or possibly,

16:59.580 --> 17:01.780
 I want to underscore possibly,

17:01.780 --> 17:03.500
 by making what are called pheromones,

17:03.500 --> 17:05.540
 molecules that they release into the environment,

17:05.540 --> 17:07.700
 typically through the breath,

17:07.700 --> 17:10.340
 that enter our system through our nose,

17:10.340 --> 17:12.020
 or our eyes, or our mouth,

17:12.020 --> 17:15.080
 that fundamentally change our biology.

17:15.980 --> 17:18.380
 I will explain how smell and taste

17:18.380 --> 17:20.800
 and these pheromone effects work,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.280
 but I'll just give an example,

17:22.280 --> 17:25.420
 which is a very salient and interesting one

17:25.420 --> 17:27.420
 that was published about 10 years ago

17:27.420 --> 17:28.960
 in the journal Science.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.780
 Science Magazine is one of the three,

17:30.780 --> 17:33.060
 what we call apex journals.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.360
 There are a lot of journals out there,

17:34.360 --> 17:35.780
 but for those of you that want to know,

17:35.780 --> 17:40.380
 Science Magazine, Nature Magazine, and Cell

17:40.380 --> 17:43.500
 are considered the three top kind of apex journals.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.940
 They are the most stringent

17:44.940 --> 17:47.900
 in terms of getting papers accepted there,

17:47.900 --> 17:48.740
 even reviewed there.

17:48.740 --> 17:53.360
 They have about a 95% rejection rate at the front gate,

17:53.360 --> 17:55.340
 meaning they don't even review 95%

17:55.340 --> 17:56.660
 of what gets sent to them.

17:56.660 --> 17:59.120
 Of the things that they do decide to review,

17:59.120 --> 18:00.260
 then get sent out,

18:00.260 --> 18:02.460
 a very small percentage of those get published.

18:02.460 --> 18:03.760
 It's very stringent.

18:03.760 --> 18:06.460
 This paper came out in Science

18:06.460 --> 18:08.380
 showing that humans,

18:08.380 --> 18:10.300
 men in particular in this study,

18:10.300 --> 18:14.420
 have a strong biological response and hormonal response

18:14.420 --> 18:18.280
 to the tears of women.

18:18.280 --> 18:20.780
 What they did is they had women,

18:20.780 --> 18:24.440
 and in this case, it was only women for whatever reason,

18:24.440 --> 18:28.420
 cry and they collected their tears.

18:28.420 --> 18:32.060
 Then those tears were smelled by male subjects

18:32.060 --> 18:36.540
 or male subjects got what was essentially the control,

18:36.540 --> 18:38.220
 which was the saline.

18:38.220 --> 18:43.020
 Men that smelled these tears that were evoked by sadness

18:44.220 --> 18:46.500
 had a reduction in their testosterone levels

18:46.500 --> 18:48.180
 that was significant.

18:48.180 --> 18:50.740
 They also had a reduction in brain areas

18:50.740 --> 18:53.560
 that were associated with sexual arousal.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.340
 Now, before you run off with your interpretations

18:56.340 --> 18:58.420
 about what this means and criticize the study

18:58.420 --> 19:00.380
 for any variety of reasons,

19:00.380 --> 19:02.180
 let's just take a step back.

19:02.180 --> 19:04.500
 I will criticize the study for a variety of reasons.

19:04.500 --> 19:08.220
 Two, one is that they only used female tears

19:08.220 --> 19:09.500
 and male subjects.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.180
 So it would have been nice for them to also use

19:12.180 --> 19:16.060
 female tears and female subjects smelling those,

19:16.060 --> 19:18.760
 male tears and male subjects smelling those,

19:18.760 --> 19:22.260
 male tears and female subjects smelling those, and so on.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.420
 They didn't do that.

19:23.420 --> 19:25.700
 They did have a large number of subjects, so that's good.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.180
 That adds power to the study.

19:27.180 --> 19:31.240
 And they did have to collect these tears

19:31.240 --> 19:33.700
 by having the women watch what was essentially

19:33.700 --> 19:35.380
 a sad scene from a movie.

19:35.380 --> 19:37.920
 They actually recruited subjects that had a high propensity

19:37.920 --> 19:41.560
 for crying at sad movies, which was not all women.

19:41.560 --> 19:43.080
 It turns out that the people that they recruited

19:43.080 --> 19:45.220
 for the study were people who said, yes,

19:45.220 --> 19:48.380
 I tend to cry when I see sad things in movies.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.820
 What they were really trying to do is just get tears

19:50.820 --> 19:55.220
 that were authentically cried in response to sadness

19:55.220 --> 19:58.320
 as opposed to putting some irritant in the eye

19:58.320 --> 20:02.180
 and collecting tears that were evoked by something else

20:02.180 --> 20:04.740
 like just having the eyes irritated.

20:04.740 --> 20:08.340
 Nonetheless, what this study illustrates

20:08.340 --> 20:12.860
 is that there are chemicals in tears that are evoking

20:12.860 --> 20:16.500
 or changing the biology of other individuals.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.700
 Now, most of us don't think about sniffing

20:18.700 --> 20:20.900
 or smelling other people's tears,

20:20.900 --> 20:24.060
 but you can imagine how in close couples

20:24.060 --> 20:27.700
 or in family members or even close friendships, et cetera,

20:27.700 --> 20:29.740
 that we are often in close proximity

20:29.740 --> 20:31.560
 to other people's tears.

20:31.560 --> 20:34.100
 Now, I didn't select this study as an example

20:34.100 --> 20:36.820
 because I want to focus on the effects of tears

20:36.820 --> 20:38.200
 on hormones per se,

20:38.200 --> 20:40.820
 although I do find the results really interesting.

20:40.820 --> 20:44.340
 I chose it because I wanted to just emphasize

20:44.340 --> 20:47.340
 or underscore the fact that chemicals that are made

20:47.340 --> 20:50.740
 by other individuals are powerfully modulating

20:50.740 --> 20:52.720
 our internal state.

20:52.720 --> 20:56.280
 And that's something that most of us don't appreciate.

20:56.280 --> 20:58.420
 I think most of us can appreciate the fact

20:58.420 --> 21:01.060
 that if we smell something putrid, we tend to retract,

21:01.060 --> 21:04.720
 or if we smell something delicious, we tend to lean into it.

21:04.720 --> 21:06.740
 But there are all these ways in which chemicals

21:06.740 --> 21:08.300
 are affecting our biology,

21:08.300 --> 21:12.620
 and interpersonal communication using chemicals

21:12.620 --> 21:15.520
 is not something that we hear that often about,

21:15.520 --> 21:16.860
 but it's super interesting.

21:16.860 --> 21:19.340
 So let's talk about smell and what smell is

21:19.340 --> 21:20.320
 and how it works.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.900
 I'm going to make this very basic,

21:21.900 --> 21:24.060
 but I am going to touch on some of the core elements

21:24.060 --> 21:25.500
 of the neurobiology.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.660
 So here's how smell works.

21:27.660 --> 21:30.560
 Smell starts with sniffing.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.220
 Now, that may come as no surprise,

21:32.220 --> 21:36.180
 but no volatile chemicals can enter our nose

21:36.180 --> 21:37.620
 unless we inhale them.

21:37.620 --> 21:41.900
 If our nose is occluded or if we're actively exhaling,

21:41.900 --> 21:45.240
 it's much more difficult for smells to enter our nose,

21:45.240 --> 21:46.660
 which is why people cover their nose

21:46.660 --> 21:49.380
 when something smells bad.

21:49.380 --> 21:52.400
 Now, the way that these volatile odors

21:52.400 --> 21:54.140
 come into the nose is interesting.

21:54.140 --> 21:57.480
 The nose has a mucosal lining, mucus,

21:57.480 --> 21:59.160
 that is designed to trap things,

21:59.160 --> 22:02.180
 to actually bring things in and get stuck there.

22:03.100 --> 22:04.500
 At the base of your brain,

22:04.500 --> 22:06.580
 so you could actually imagine this,

22:06.580 --> 22:09.100
 or if you wanted, you could touch the roof of your mouth,

22:09.100 --> 22:11.140
 but right above your mouth,

22:11.140 --> 22:14.500
 about two centimeters is your olfactory bulb.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.620
 The olfactory bulb is a collection of neurons,

22:16.620 --> 22:20.380
 and those neurons actually extend out of the skull,

22:20.380 --> 22:24.720
 out of your skull, into your nose, into the mucosal lining.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.320
 So what this means in kind of a literal sense

22:27.320 --> 22:29.180
 is that you have neurons

22:29.180 --> 22:31.900
 that extend their little dendrites

22:31.900 --> 22:33.340
 and axonoid-like things,

22:33.340 --> 22:35.300
 their little processes, as we call them,

22:35.300 --> 22:37.300
 out into the mucus,

22:37.300 --> 22:41.140
 and they respond to different odorant compounds.

22:41.140 --> 22:43.060
 Now, the olfactory neurons

22:43.060 --> 22:46.020
 also send a branch deeper into the brain,

22:46.020 --> 22:50.900
 and they split off into three different paths.

22:50.900 --> 22:55.900
 So one path is for what we call innate odor responses.

22:56.260 --> 22:59.220
 So you have some hardwired aspects

22:59.220 --> 23:01.100
 to the way that you smell the world

23:01.100 --> 23:03.120
 that were there from the day you were born

23:03.120 --> 23:05.860
 and that will be there until the day you die.

23:05.860 --> 23:09.100
 These are the pathways and the neurons

23:09.100 --> 23:12.180
 that respond to things like smoke,

23:12.180 --> 23:13.440
 which, as you can imagine,

23:13.440 --> 23:15.440
 there's a highly adaptive function

23:15.440 --> 23:17.700
 to being able to detect burning things,

23:17.700 --> 23:20.820
 because burning things generally means lack of safety

23:20.820 --> 23:22.940
 or impending threat of some kind.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.620
 It calls for action,

23:25.620 --> 23:26.980
 and indeed, these neurons

23:26.980 --> 23:30.180
 project to a central area of the brain called the amygdala,

23:30.180 --> 23:32.060
 which is often discussed in terms of fear,

23:32.060 --> 23:34.940
 but it's really a fear and threat detection.

23:34.940 --> 23:37.620
 So some compounds, some chemicals in your environment,

23:37.620 --> 23:38.960
 when you smell them,

23:38.960 --> 23:40.880
 unless you're trained to overcome them

23:40.880 --> 23:42.740
 because you're a firefighter,

23:42.740 --> 23:46.940
 you will naturally have a heightened level of alertness,

23:46.940 --> 23:49.000
 you will sense threat,

23:49.000 --> 23:52.260
 and if you're in sleep even, it will wake you up.

23:52.260 --> 23:53.100
 So that's a good thing.

23:53.100 --> 23:55.140
 It's kind of an emergency system.

23:55.140 --> 23:57.680
 You also have neurons in your nose

23:57.680 --> 24:01.040
 that respond to odorants or combinations of odorants

24:01.040 --> 24:04.100
 that evoke a sense of desire

24:04.100 --> 24:07.500
 and what we call appetitive behaviors, approach behaviors,

24:07.500 --> 24:09.660
 that make you want to move toward something.

24:09.660 --> 24:12.660
 So when you smell a delicious cookie

24:12.660 --> 24:17.380
 or some dish that's really savory that you really like,

24:17.380 --> 24:19.340
 or a wonderful orange,

24:20.180 --> 24:23.420
 and you say, mm, or it feels delicious,

24:23.420 --> 24:25.300
 or it smells delicious,

24:25.300 --> 24:27.180
 that's because of these innate pathway,

24:27.180 --> 24:30.620
 these pathways that require no learning whatsoever.

24:30.620 --> 24:33.220
 Now, some of the pathways from the nose,

24:33.220 --> 24:35.180
 these olfactory neurons into the brain,

24:35.180 --> 24:39.240
 are involved in learned associations with odors.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.920
 Many people have this experience

24:42.920 --> 24:46.700
 that they can remember the smell

24:46.700 --> 24:48.500
 of their grandmother's home

24:48.500 --> 24:51.100
 or their grandmother's hands even,

24:51.100 --> 24:54.520
 or the smell of particular items baking

24:54.520 --> 24:58.820
 or on the stove in a particular environment.

24:58.820 --> 25:00.660
 Typically, these memories tend to be

25:00.660 --> 25:04.460
 of a kind of nurturing sort of feeling safe and protected,

25:04.460 --> 25:08.340
 but one of the reasons why olfaction, smell,

25:08.340 --> 25:10.260
 is so closely tied to memory

25:10.260 --> 25:14.200
 is because olfaction is the most ancient sense that we have,

25:14.200 --> 25:16.060
 or I should say chemical sensing

25:16.060 --> 25:19.340
 is among the most primitive and ancient senses that we have,

25:19.340 --> 25:21.060
 probably almost certainly evolved

25:21.060 --> 25:24.100
 before vision and before hearing.

25:24.100 --> 25:26.980
 But when we come into the world,

25:26.980 --> 25:29.980
 because we're still learning about the statistics of life,

25:29.980 --> 25:32.360
 about who's friendly and who's not friendly

25:32.360 --> 25:33.800
 and where's a fun place to be

25:33.800 --> 25:35.840
 and where's a boring place to be,

25:35.840 --> 25:37.560
 that all takes a long time to learn,

25:37.560 --> 25:40.680
 but the olfactory system seems to imprint,

25:40.680 --> 25:43.860
 seems to lay down memories very early

25:43.860 --> 25:47.340
 and to create these very powerful associations.

25:47.340 --> 25:51.100
 And if you think about it long enough and hard enough,

25:51.100 --> 25:54.140
 many of you can probably realize

25:54.140 --> 25:55.820
 that there are certain smells

25:55.820 --> 25:58.900
 that evoke a memory of a particular place

25:58.900 --> 26:00.760
 or person or context.

26:00.760 --> 26:03.840
 And that's because you also have pathways out of the nose

26:03.840 --> 26:05.700
 that are not for innate behaviors

26:05.700 --> 26:10.700
 like cringing or repulsion or gagging

26:10.800 --> 26:13.380
 or for that appetitive sensation,

26:13.380 --> 26:17.380
 but that just remind you of a place or a thing or a context.

26:17.380 --> 26:19.220
 Could be flowers in spring,

26:19.220 --> 26:22.100
 could be grandmother's home and cookies.

26:22.100 --> 26:24.580
 This is a very common occurrence

26:24.580 --> 26:25.900
 and it's a very common occurrence

26:25.900 --> 26:28.300
 because this generally exists in all of us.

26:28.300 --> 26:31.700
 So we have pathway for innate responses

26:31.700 --> 26:33.580
 and a pathway for learned responses.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.060
 And then we have this other pathway

26:36.060 --> 26:38.100
 and in humans, it's a little bit controversial

26:38.100 --> 26:40.380
 as to whether or not it sits truly separate

26:40.380 --> 26:42.860
 from the standard olfactory system

26:42.860 --> 26:46.420
 or whether or not it's its own system embedded in there,

26:46.420 --> 26:50.420
 but that they call the accessory olfactory pathway.

26:50.420 --> 26:53.660
 Accessory olfactory pathway is what in other animals

26:53.660 --> 26:56.980
 is responsible for true pheromone effects.

26:56.980 --> 26:59.100
 We will talk about true pheromone effects,

26:59.100 --> 27:04.100
 but for example, in rodents and in some primates,

27:04.660 --> 27:06.860
 including mandrills, if you've ever seen mandrills,

27:06.860 --> 27:09.020
 they have these like big beak noses things,

27:09.020 --> 27:09.940
 you may have seen them at the zoo,

27:09.940 --> 27:11.520
 look them up if you haven't seen them already,

27:11.520 --> 27:15.140
 M-A-N-D-R-I-L-S, mandrills,

27:15.140 --> 27:17.300
 there are strong pheromone effects.

27:17.300 --> 27:20.120
 Some of those include things like

27:20.120 --> 27:24.860
 if you take a pregnant female rodent or mandril,

27:24.860 --> 27:29.860
 you take away the father that created those fetuses or fetus

27:31.900 --> 27:36.060
 and you introduce the scent of the urine

27:36.060 --> 27:39.840
 or the fur of a novel male,

27:39.840 --> 27:43.820
 she will spontaneously abort or miscarry those fetuses.

27:43.820 --> 27:45.420
 It's a very powerful effect.

27:46.580 --> 27:48.340
 In humans, it's still controversial

27:48.340 --> 27:50.420
 whether or not anything like that can happen,

27:50.420 --> 27:53.560
 but it's a very powerful pheromonal effect in other animals.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.020
 Another example of a pheromone effect

27:56.020 --> 27:57.500
 is called the Vandenberg effect,

27:57.500 --> 28:00.100
 named after the person who discovered this effect,

28:00.100 --> 28:04.220
 where you take a female of a given species

28:04.220 --> 28:06.160
 that has not entered puberty,

28:06.160 --> 28:10.020
 you expose her to the scent or the urine

28:10.020 --> 28:14.820
 from a sexually competent, meaning post-pubertal male,

28:14.820 --> 28:18.740
 and she spontaneously goes into puberty earlier.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.980
 So something about the scent triggers something

28:20.980 --> 28:23.140
 through this accessory olfactory system,

28:23.140 --> 28:24.820
 this is a true pheromonal effect,

28:24.820 --> 28:28.820
 and creates ovulation and menstruation,

28:28.820 --> 28:32.340
 or in rodents, it's an estrous cycle, not a menstrual cycle.

28:32.340 --> 28:35.340
 So this is not to say

28:35.340 --> 28:37.220
 that the exact same things happen in humans.

28:37.220 --> 28:39.060
 In humans, as I mentioned earlier,

28:39.060 --> 28:41.460
 there are chemical sensing between individuals

28:41.460 --> 28:44.500
 that may be independent of the nose,

28:44.500 --> 28:46.200
 and we will talk about those,

28:46.200 --> 28:48.300
 but those are basically the three paths

28:48.300 --> 28:51.800
 by which smells, odors, impact us.

28:51.800 --> 28:54.940
 So I want to talk about the act of smelling,

28:54.940 --> 28:58.800
 and if you are not somebody who's very interested in smell,

28:58.800 --> 29:00.340
 but you are somebody who's interested

29:00.340 --> 29:02.180
 in making your brain work better,

29:02.180 --> 29:04.780
 learning faster, remembering more things,

29:04.780 --> 29:06.980
 this next little segment is for you,

29:06.980 --> 29:09.740
 because it turns out that how you smell,

29:09.740 --> 29:12.780
 meaning the act of smelling, not how good or bad you smell,

29:12.780 --> 29:17.660
 but the act of smelling, sniffing and inhalation,

29:17.660 --> 29:20.200
 powerfully impacts how your brain functions

29:20.200 --> 29:22.940
 and what you can learn and what you can't learn.

29:22.940 --> 29:25.700
 Breathing generally consists of two actions,

29:25.700 --> 29:28.980
 inhaling and exhaling, and we have the option, of course,

29:28.980 --> 29:32.220
 to do that through our nose or our mouth.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.660
 I've talked on previous episodes

29:33.660 --> 29:36.420
 about the fact that there are great advantages

29:36.420 --> 29:38.260
 to being a nasal breather,

29:38.260 --> 29:42.220
 and there are great disadvantages to being a mouth breather.

29:42.220 --> 29:45.180
 There are excellent books and data on this.

29:45.180 --> 29:47.700
 There's the recent book, Breath by James Nestor,

29:47.700 --> 29:50.360
 which is an excellent book that describes

29:50.360 --> 29:52.540
 some of the positive effects of nasal breathing

29:52.540 --> 29:54.480
 as well as other breathing practices.

29:54.480 --> 29:57.140
 There's also the book Jaws by my colleagues,

29:57.140 --> 29:58.580
 Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn,

29:58.580 --> 30:01.020
 with a forward by Jared Diamond

30:01.020 --> 30:04.980
 and an introduction by Robert Sapolsky from Stanford.

30:04.980 --> 30:08.500
 So that's a book, Chock-a-block with heavy hitter authors,

30:08.500 --> 30:11.720
 that describes how being a nasal breather

30:11.720 --> 30:14.180
 is beneficial for jaw structure,

30:14.180 --> 30:16.500
 for immune system function, et cetera.

30:16.500 --> 30:21.380
 Breathing in through your nose, sniffing,

30:21.380 --> 30:24.060
 actually has positive effects on the way

30:24.060 --> 30:27.040
 that you can acquire and remember information.

30:28.060 --> 30:31.380
 Noam Sobel's group, originally at UC Berkeley

30:31.380 --> 30:33.740
 and then at the Weizmann Institute,

30:33.740 --> 30:36.640
 has published a number of papers

30:36.640 --> 30:38.540
 that I'd like to discuss today.

30:38.540 --> 30:42.300
 One of them, Human Non-Olfactory Cognition,

30:42.300 --> 30:43.700
 Phase-Locked with Inhalation.

30:43.700 --> 30:45.640
 This was published in Nature Human Behavior,

30:45.640 --> 30:50.640
 an excellent journal, showed that the act of inhaling

30:52.020 --> 30:55.340
 has a couple of interesting and powerful consequences.

30:55.340 --> 31:00.340
 First of all, as we inhale, the brain increases in arousal.

31:01.380 --> 31:03.920
 Our level of alertness and attention increases

31:03.920 --> 31:07.100
 when we inhale as compared to when we exhale.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.020
 Now, of course, with every inhale, there's an exhale.

31:10.020 --> 31:11.900
 You could probably double up on your inhales

31:11.900 --> 31:14.220
 if you're doing size or some of the physiological size.

31:14.220 --> 31:15.180
 I've talked about these before.

31:15.180 --> 31:17.940
 It's a double inhales, followed by an exhale,

31:17.940 --> 31:18.820
 something like that.

31:18.820 --> 31:21.260
 Or if you're speaking, you're going to change your cadence

31:21.260 --> 31:22.620
 and ratio of inhales and exhales.

31:22.620 --> 31:26.320
 But typically, we inhale, then we exhale.

31:26.320 --> 31:30.260
 As we inhale, what this paper shows is that

31:30.260 --> 31:33.980
 the level of alertness goes up in the brain.

31:33.980 --> 31:37.260
 And this makes sense because as the most primitive

31:37.260 --> 31:40.460
 and primordial sense by which we interact

31:40.460 --> 31:44.420
 with our environment and bring chemicals into our system

31:44.420 --> 31:49.420
 and detect our environment, inhaling is a cue

31:49.420 --> 31:52.940
 for the rest of the brain to essentially to pay attention

31:52.940 --> 31:55.500
 to what's happening, not just to the odors.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.900
 As the name of this paper suggests,

31:57.900 --> 32:02.860
 human non-olfactory cognition, phase locked with inhalation.

32:02.860 --> 32:07.060
 What that means is that the act of inhaling itself

32:07.060 --> 32:08.180
 wakes up the brain.

32:08.180 --> 32:11.360
 It's not about what you're perceiving or what you're smelling

32:11.360 --> 32:16.360
 and indeed sniffing as an action, inhaling as an action

32:16.680 --> 32:20.680
 has a powerful effect on your ability to be alert,

32:20.680 --> 32:23.280
 your ability to attend, to focus,

32:23.280 --> 32:26.000
 and your ability to remember information.

32:26.000 --> 32:30.220
 When we exhale, the brain goes through a subtle

32:30.220 --> 32:34.080
 but nonetheless significant dip in level of arousal

32:34.080 --> 32:35.840
 and ability to learn.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.280
 So what does this mean?

32:37.280 --> 32:39.400
 How should you use this knowledge?

32:39.400 --> 32:42.480
 Well, you could imagine, and I think this would be

32:42.480 --> 32:46.800
 beneficial for most people to focus on nasal breathing

32:46.800 --> 32:50.160
 while doing any kind of focused work that doesn't require

32:50.160 --> 32:52.520
 that you speak or eat or ingest something.

32:53.480 --> 32:54.920
 There is a separate paper published

32:54.920 --> 32:57.920
 in the Journal of Neuroscience that showed that indeed,

32:57.920 --> 33:00.560
 if subjects, human subjects are restricted

33:00.560 --> 33:04.140
 to breathing through their nose, they learn better

33:04.140 --> 33:06.280
 than if they have the option of breathing

33:06.280 --> 33:08.560
 through their mouth or a combination

33:08.560 --> 33:09.600
 of their nose and mouth.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.400
 These are significant effects in humans

33:11.400 --> 33:14.400
 using modern techniques from excellent groups.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.160
 So sniffing itself is a powerful modulator

33:18.160 --> 33:22.080
 of our cognition and our ability to learn.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.280
 You can imagine all sorts of ways

33:23.280 --> 33:25.200
 that you might apply that as a tool.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.360
 And I suggest that you play with it a bit,

33:27.360 --> 33:30.440
 that if you're having a hard time staying awake and alert,

33:30.440 --> 33:32.420
 you're having a hard time remembering information,

33:32.420 --> 33:34.520
 you feel like you have a kind of attention deficit,

33:34.520 --> 33:38.000
 nonclinical, of course, nasal breathing ought to help,

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
 extending or making your inhales more intense ought to help.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.900
 Now, this isn't really about chemical sensing per se,

33:45.900 --> 33:48.980
 but here's where it gets interesting and exciting.

33:48.980 --> 33:50.600
 If you are somebody who doesn't have

33:50.600 --> 33:53.000
 a very good sense of smell,

33:53.000 --> 33:55.320
 or you're somebody who simply wants to get better

33:55.320 --> 33:58.200
 at smelling and tasting things,

33:58.200 --> 34:00.840
 you can actually practice sniffing.

34:00.840 --> 34:02.080
 I know that sounds ridiculous,

34:02.080 --> 34:05.520
 but it turns out that simply sniffing nothing,

34:05.520 --> 34:08.560
 so doing something like this,

34:08.560 --> 34:10.440
 I guess the microphone sort of has a smell,

34:10.440 --> 34:12.500
 I guess my pen doesn't have a smell,

34:14.040 --> 34:16.660
 turns out that doing a series of inhales,

34:16.660 --> 34:18.800
 and of course each one is followed by an exhale,

34:18.800 --> 34:23.600
 10 or 15 times, and then smelling an object like an orange

34:23.600 --> 34:26.020
 or another item of food,

34:26.020 --> 34:27.960
 or even the skin of somebody else,

34:27.960 --> 34:31.240
 will lead to an increase in your ability

34:31.240 --> 34:33.900
 to perceive those odors.

34:33.900 --> 34:36.440
 Now, there are probably two reasons for that.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.480
 One reason is that the brain systems of detecting things

34:39.480 --> 34:42.400
 are waking up as a mere consequence of inhaling.

34:42.400 --> 34:45.440
 So this is sort of the olfactory equivalent

34:45.440 --> 34:50.120
 of opening your eyes wider in order to see, more or less.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.080
 Last episode, I talked about how opening your eyes wider

34:52.080 --> 34:54.060
 actually increases your level of alertness.

34:54.060 --> 34:55.680
 It's not just that your level of alertness

34:55.680 --> 34:58.000
 causes your eyes to be open wider.

34:58.000 --> 34:58.880
 Opening your eyes wider

34:58.880 --> 35:00.760
 can actually increase your level of alertness.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.340
 Well, it turns out that breathing more deeply

35:02.340 --> 35:04.660
 through the nose wakes up your brain,

35:04.660 --> 35:08.440
 and it creates a heightened sensitivity

35:08.440 --> 35:11.840
 of the neurons that relate to smell.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.980
 And there's a close crossover,

35:13.980 --> 35:16.240
 I'm sure you know this, between smell and taste.

35:16.240 --> 35:18.120
 If any of you have ever had a cold,

35:18.120 --> 35:21.040
 or for whatever reason you've lost your sense of smell,

35:21.040 --> 35:22.600
 you become what they call anosmic,

35:22.600 --> 35:24.520
 your sense of taste suffers also.

35:24.520 --> 35:25.460
 We'll talk a little bit more

35:25.460 --> 35:27.520
 about why that is in a few minutes.

35:27.520 --> 35:28.920
 But as a first protocol,

35:28.920 --> 35:31.620
 I'd really like all of you to consider

35:31.620 --> 35:34.560
 becoming nasal breathers while you're trying to learn,

35:34.560 --> 35:36.080
 while you're trying to listen,

35:36.080 --> 35:39.680
 while you're trying to wake up your brain in any way

35:39.680 --> 35:42.600
 and learn and retain information.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.880
 This is a powerful tool.

35:44.880 --> 35:45.760
 Now, there are other ways

35:45.760 --> 35:47.960
 to wake up your brain more as well.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.440
 For instance, the use of smelling salts.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.420
 I'm not recommending that you do this necessarily,

35:52.420 --> 35:55.220
 but there are excellent peer-reviewed data

35:55.220 --> 35:58.860
 showing that indeed, if you use smelling salts,

35:58.860 --> 36:01.320
 which are mostly of the sort

36:01.320 --> 36:02.720
 that include ammonia,

36:02.720 --> 36:05.840
 ammonia is a very toxic scent,

36:05.840 --> 36:10.140
 but it's toxic in a way that triggers this innate pathway,

36:10.140 --> 36:12.120
 the pathway from the nose to the amygdala

36:12.120 --> 36:14.720
 and wakes up the brain and body in a major way.

36:14.720 --> 36:17.040
 This is why they use smelling salts when people pass out.

36:17.040 --> 36:19.680
 This is why fighters used to use,

36:19.680 --> 36:22.600
 or maybe sometimes still use smelling salts

36:22.600 --> 36:24.200
 in order to heighten their level of alertness.

36:24.200 --> 36:28.160
 This is why power lifters will inhale smelling salts.

36:28.160 --> 36:31.600
 They work because they trigger the fear

36:31.600 --> 36:34.280
 and kind of overall arousal systems of the brain.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.280
 This is why I think most people

36:35.280 --> 36:37.440
 probably shouldn't use ammonia or smelling salts

36:37.440 --> 36:40.120
 to try and wake up, but they really do work.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.600
 If you've ever smelled smelling salts,

36:41.600 --> 36:45.660
 and I have, I tried this, they give you a serious jolt.

36:45.660 --> 36:47.520
 It's like six espresso

36:47.520 --> 36:49.380
 infused into your bloodstream all at once.

36:49.380 --> 36:51.640
 You are wide awake immediately,

36:51.640 --> 36:54.820
 and you feel a heightened sense of kind of desire to move

36:54.820 --> 36:57.240
 because you release adrenaline into your body.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.740
 Now, inhaling through your nose

36:58.740 --> 37:00.760
 and doing nasal breathing is not going to do that.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.760
 It's going to be a more subtle version

37:02.760 --> 37:07.640
 of waking up your system, of alerting your brain overall.

37:07.640 --> 37:11.720
 And for those of you that are interested in having a richer,

37:11.720 --> 37:14.680
 a more deep connection to the things

37:14.680 --> 37:16.280
 that you smell and taste,

37:16.280 --> 37:19.080
 including other individuals perhaps, not just food,

37:21.060 --> 37:23.400
 practicing or enhancing your sense of sniffing,

37:23.400 --> 37:24.480
 your ability to sniff

37:24.480 --> 37:26.480
 might sound like a kind of ridiculous protocol,

37:26.480 --> 37:28.400
 but it's actually a kind of fun

37:28.400 --> 37:29.640
 and cool experiment that you can do.

37:29.640 --> 37:32.060
 You just do the simple experiment of taking,

37:32.060 --> 37:34.120
 for instance, an orange, you smell it,

37:34.120 --> 37:36.920
 try and gauge your level of perception

37:36.920 --> 37:41.320
 of how orangish it smells or lemony, lemony-ish, lemony?

37:41.320 --> 37:43.800
 I don't know, is it lemony-ish or lemony?

37:43.800 --> 37:48.160
 Lemony, it smells, then set it away,

37:48.160 --> 37:52.560
 do 10 or 15 inhales, followed by exhales, of course,

37:52.560 --> 37:55.960
 or just through the nose, not going to do all 10 or 15,

37:55.960 --> 37:57.220
 and then smell it again,

37:57.220 --> 37:59.720
 and you'll notice that your perception of that smell,

37:59.720 --> 38:01.760
 the kind of richness of that smell

38:01.760 --> 38:03.760
 will be significantly increased.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.380
 And that's, again, for two reasons.

38:05.380 --> 38:09.240
 One, the brain is in a position to respond to it better.

38:09.240 --> 38:12.400
 Your brain has been aroused by the mere act of sniffing,

38:12.400 --> 38:16.160
 but also the neurons that respond to that lemon odor,

38:16.160 --> 38:19.840
 that lemony or odor, are going to respond better.

38:19.840 --> 38:22.560
 So you can actually have a heightened experience

38:22.560 --> 38:23.900
 of something, and that, of course,

38:23.900 --> 38:26.000
 will also be true for the taste system.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.640
 You also can really train your sense of smell

38:28.640 --> 38:30.480
 to get much, much better.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.160
 When Noam Sobel's group was at Berkeley,

38:32.160 --> 38:34.760
 I happened to be a graduate student around that time,

38:34.760 --> 38:37.320
 and every once in a while, I'd look outside,

38:37.320 --> 38:40.700
 and there would be people crawling around on the grass

38:40.700 --> 38:43.920
 with goggles on, gloves on, and these hoods on,

38:43.920 --> 38:47.440
 with earmuffs, and they looked ridiculous.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.520
 But what they were doing is they were actually learning

38:49.520 --> 38:51.880
 to follow scent trails.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.320
 So in the world of dogs, you have sight hounds

38:54.320 --> 38:57.720
 that use their eyes in order to navigate and find things,

38:57.720 --> 38:59.440
 and you have scent hounds that use their nose.

38:59.440 --> 39:00.840
 And the scent hounds are remarkable.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.880
 They can be trained to detect a scent.

39:02.880 --> 39:05.240
 These are the sniffing, the bomb sniffing

39:05.240 --> 39:08.240
 and the drug sniffing dogs in airports.

39:08.240 --> 39:09.560
 There are now dogs, actually,

39:09.560 --> 39:12.480
 that can sniff out COVID infections

39:12.480 --> 39:14.160
 with a very high degree of accuracy.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.400
 They can be trained to that.

39:15.400 --> 39:19.480
 There's something about the COVID and similar infections

39:19.480 --> 39:22.080
 that the body produces probably in the immune response,

39:22.080 --> 39:24.000
 some odors, and the dogs are, I think,

39:24.000 --> 39:25.960
 as high as 90%, in some cases,

39:25.960 --> 39:29.100
 maybe even 95% accuracy, just remarkable.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.840
 There are theories that dogs can sniff out cancer.

39:31.840 --> 39:34.800
 This stuff all exceeds statistical significance.

39:34.800 --> 39:36.760
 It's still a little bit mysterious in some ways,

39:36.760 --> 39:39.920
 but you may not ever achieve

39:39.920 --> 39:43.220
 the olfactory capabilities of a scent hound,

39:43.220 --> 39:48.080
 but what Noam Sobel's lab did is they had people

39:48.080 --> 39:50.280
 completely eliminate their visual experience

39:50.280 --> 39:53.160
 by having them wear dark glasses or goggles.

39:53.160 --> 39:54.560
 So they couldn't see and they couldn't hear.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.640
 They couldn't sense anything with their sense of touch.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.800
 They had thick gloves on, but they had these masks on

39:59.800 --> 40:02.120
 where just their nasal passages were open.

40:02.120 --> 40:05.880
 And people could, in a fairly short amount of time,

40:05.880 --> 40:09.840
 learn to follow a chocolate scent trail on the ground,

40:09.840 --> 40:12.480
 which is not something that most people want to do.

40:12.480 --> 40:15.160
 But what they showed using brain imaging, et cetera,

40:15.160 --> 40:19.320
 in subsequent studies is that the human brain,

40:19.320 --> 40:23.060
 you can learn to really enhance your sense of smell

40:23.060 --> 40:25.900
 and become very astute in distinguishing

40:25.900 --> 40:29.160
 whether or not one particular odor or combinations of odors

40:29.160 --> 40:33.200
 is such that it's less than or more than

40:33.200 --> 40:35.140
 a different odor, for instance.

40:35.140 --> 40:36.240
 Now, why would you want to do this?

40:36.240 --> 40:39.400
 Well, if you like to eat as much as I do,

40:39.400 --> 40:41.400
 one of the things that can really enhance

40:41.400 --> 40:44.580
 your sense of pleasure from the experience

40:44.580 --> 40:47.520
 of ingesting food is to enhance your sense of smell.

40:47.520 --> 40:50.240
 And if you don't have a great sense of smell,

40:50.240 --> 40:53.040
 or if you have a sense of smell that's really so good

40:53.040 --> 40:55.160
 that it's always picking up bad odors,

40:55.160 --> 40:57.240
 we'll talk about that in a minute,

40:57.240 --> 41:01.680
 well, then you might want to tune up your sense of smell

41:01.680 --> 41:04.840
 by doing this practice of 10 or 15 breaths,

41:04.840 --> 41:06.620
 excuse me, sniffs, not breaths,

41:06.620 --> 41:10.400
 sniffs and then interacting with some food item

41:10.400 --> 41:12.440
 or thing that you're interested in smelling more of.

41:12.440 --> 41:14.260
 So these could be the ingredients that you're cooking with.

41:14.260 --> 41:16.640
 I really encourage you to try and really smell them.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.920
 You sometimes hear this as kind of a mindfulness practice,

41:18.920 --> 41:22.200
 like, ooh, really smell the food, really taste the food.

41:22.200 --> 41:24.660
 And we always hear about that as kind of a mindfulness

41:24.660 --> 41:25.800
 and presence thing,

41:25.800 --> 41:28.040
 but you actually can increase the sensitivity

41:28.040 --> 41:30.880
 of your olfactory and your taste system by doing this.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.120
 And it has long-term effects.

41:33.120 --> 41:34.280
 That's what's so interesting.

41:34.280 --> 41:35.120
 This isn't the kind of thing

41:35.120 --> 41:36.620
 that you have to do every time you eat.

41:36.620 --> 41:38.160
 You don't have to be the weirdo in the restaurant

41:38.160 --> 41:39.800
 that's like picking up the radish

41:39.800 --> 41:41.480
 and like jamming it up your nostrils.

41:41.480 --> 41:42.680
 Please don't do that.

41:42.680 --> 41:44.740
 You don't have to necessarily smell everything,

41:44.740 --> 41:47.780
 although it's nice sometimes to smell the food

41:47.780 --> 41:49.620
 that you're about to eat and as you eat it,

41:49.620 --> 41:52.520
 but it has long-term effects in terms of your ability

41:52.520 --> 41:56.560
 to distinguish and discriminate different types of odors.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.840
 And these don't even have to be very pungent foods,

41:58.840 --> 41:59.680
 it turns out.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.200
 The studies show that it doesn't have to be

42:01.200 --> 42:02.880
 some really stinky cheese.

42:02.880 --> 42:04.800
 There are cheese shops that I've walked into

42:04.800 --> 42:07.040
 where like, I just basically gag, I can't handle it.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.280
 I just can't be in there.

42:08.280 --> 42:09.880
 It just overwhelms me.

42:09.880 --> 42:11.860
 Other people, they love that smell.

42:11.860 --> 42:14.340
 So you have to tune it to your interest and experience,

42:14.340 --> 42:17.160
 but I think even for you Fasters out there,

42:17.160 --> 42:19.360
 everybody eats at some point.

42:19.360 --> 42:22.000
 Everybody ingests chemicals through their mouth.

42:22.000 --> 42:25.160
 And one of the ways that you can powerfully increase

42:25.160 --> 42:27.200
 your relationship to that experience

42:27.200 --> 42:29.520
 and make it much more positive

42:29.520 --> 42:31.740
 is through just the occasional practice

42:31.740 --> 42:35.180
 of 10 or 15 sniffs of nothing,

42:35.180 --> 42:36.960
 which almost sounds ridiculous.

42:36.960 --> 42:37.900
 Like how could that be?

42:37.900 --> 42:39.160
 But now you understand why.

42:39.160 --> 42:41.060
 It's because of the way that the sniffing action

42:41.060 --> 42:43.040
 increases the alertness of the brain,

42:43.040 --> 42:46.440
 as well as increasing the sensitivity of the system.

42:46.440 --> 42:49.960
 No other system that I'm aware of in our body

42:49.960 --> 42:54.260
 is as amenable to these kinds of behavioral training shifts

42:54.260 --> 42:56.040
 and allow them to happen so quickly.

42:56.040 --> 42:57.660
 I would love to be able to tell you

42:57.660 --> 43:01.080
 that just doing 10 or 15 near far exercises with a pen

43:01.080 --> 43:04.400
 or going outside for 10 or 15 seconds each morning

43:04.400 --> 43:06.840
 is going to completely change the way that you see the world

43:06.840 --> 43:08.240
 but it actually isn't the case.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.020
 You actually, it requires more training,

43:10.020 --> 43:11.960
 a little bit more effort in the visual system.

43:11.960 --> 43:14.320
 In the olfactory system, in your smell system,

43:14.320 --> 43:15.620
 and in your taste system,

43:15.620 --> 43:18.440
 just the tiniest bit of training and attention

43:18.440 --> 43:22.240
 and sniffing, inhaling can radically change

43:22.240 --> 43:23.660
 your relationship to food

43:23.660 --> 43:27.040
 such that you actually start to feel very different

43:27.040 --> 43:28.920
 as a consequence of ingesting those foods,

43:28.920 --> 43:32.500
 as well as becoming more discerning about which foods

43:32.500 --> 43:34.320
 you like and which ones you don't like.

43:34.320 --> 43:35.280
 And we're going to talk about that

43:35.280 --> 43:37.760
 because there's a really wonderful thing that happens

43:37.760 --> 43:40.000
 when you start developing a sensitive palate

43:40.000 --> 43:43.120
 and a sensitive sense of smell

43:43.120 --> 43:46.500
 in a way that allows you to guide your eating

43:46.500 --> 43:47.940
 and smelling decisions

43:47.940 --> 43:49.580
 and maybe even interpersonal decisions

43:49.580 --> 43:52.880
 about who you spend time with or mate with or whatever

43:52.880 --> 43:56.080
 in a way that is really in line with your biology.

43:56.080 --> 43:59.300
 In fact, how well we can smell and taste things

43:59.300 --> 44:03.480
 is actually a very strong indication of our brain health.

44:03.480 --> 44:05.960
 Now that's not to say that if you have a poor sense of smell

44:05.960 --> 44:08.720
 or a poor sense of taste that you're somehow brain damaged

44:08.720 --> 44:11.520
 or you're going, you're going to have dementia.

44:11.520 --> 44:14.640
 Although sometimes early signs of dementia

44:14.640 --> 44:17.160
 or loss of neurons in other regions of the brain

44:17.160 --> 44:20.200
 related to say Parkinson's can show up first

44:20.200 --> 44:21.760
 as a loss of sense of smell.

44:22.640 --> 44:26.700
 Again, it's not causal and it's certainly not the case

44:26.700 --> 44:28.840
 that every time you have a sudden loss of smell

44:28.840 --> 44:30.280
 that there's necessarily brain damage.

44:30.280 --> 44:32.000
 I want to be very clear about that,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.240
 but they are often correlated.

44:35.560 --> 44:37.100
 There's also a lot of interest right now

44:37.100 --> 44:38.480
 in loss of sense of smell

44:38.480 --> 44:41.560
 because one of the early detection signs of COVID-19

44:41.560 --> 44:43.440
 was a loss of sense of smell.

44:43.440 --> 44:46.640
 So I just briefly want to talk about loss of sense of smell

44:46.640 --> 44:49.320
 and regaining sense of smell and taste

44:49.320 --> 44:53.180
 because these have powerful implications for overall health

44:53.180 --> 44:56.800
 and in fact can indicate something about brain damage

44:56.800 --> 44:59.720
 and can even inform how quickly we might be recovering

44:59.720 --> 45:02.080
 from something like a concussion.

45:02.080 --> 45:05.420
 So our olfactory neurons, these neurons in our nose

45:05.420 --> 45:10.420
 that detect odors are really unique among other brain neurons

45:10.820 --> 45:14.720
 because they get replenished throughout life.

45:14.720 --> 45:18.560
 They don't just regenerate, but they get replenished.

45:18.560 --> 45:23.060
 So regeneration is when something is damaged and it regrows.

45:23.060 --> 45:25.400
 These neurons are constantly turning over

45:25.400 --> 45:26.300
 throughout our lifespan.

45:26.300 --> 45:27.840
 They're constantly being replenished.

45:27.840 --> 45:31.340
 They're dying off and they're being replaced by new ones.

45:31.340 --> 45:34.000
 This is an amazing aspect of our brain

45:34.000 --> 45:36.420
 that's basically unique to these neurons.

45:36.420 --> 45:37.660
 There's one other region of the brain

45:37.660 --> 45:39.720
 where there's a little bit of this maybe,

45:39.720 --> 45:42.360
 but these olfactory neurons,

45:42.360 --> 45:45.440
 about every three or four weeks, they die.

45:46.280 --> 45:48.800
 And when they die, they're replaced by new ones

45:48.800 --> 45:51.100
 that come from a different region of the brain,

45:51.960 --> 45:53.800
 a region called the subventricular zone.

45:53.800 --> 45:57.500
 The name isn't as important as the phenomenon,

45:57.500 --> 45:59.880
 but these neurons are born in the ventricle,

45:59.880 --> 46:02.040
 the area of your brain that's a hole that contains,

46:02.040 --> 46:03.080
 it's not an empty hole,

46:03.080 --> 46:06.000
 it's a hole basically that contains cerebral spinal fluid.

46:06.000 --> 46:08.040
 Well, there's a little subventricular zone.

46:08.040 --> 46:11.400
 There's a little zone below sub, the ventricles,

46:11.400 --> 46:15.400
 and that zone, if you are exercising regularly,

46:15.400 --> 46:18.100
 if your dopamine levels are high enough,

46:19.860 --> 46:23.340
 those little cells there are like stem cells.

46:23.340 --> 46:25.360
 They are stem cells and they spit out

46:25.360 --> 46:27.280
 what are called little neuroblasts.

46:27.280 --> 46:29.520
 Those little neuroblasts migrate

46:29.520 --> 46:32.920
 into the front of your brain and then shimmy

46:32.920 --> 46:33.760
 they kind of move through

46:33.760 --> 46:35.820
 what's called the rostral migratory stream.

46:35.820 --> 46:37.360
 They kind of shimmy along

46:37.360 --> 46:39.680
 and land back in your olfactory bulb,

46:39.680 --> 46:41.720
 settle down and extend little wires

46:41.720 --> 46:43.840
 into your olfactory mucosa.

46:43.840 --> 46:47.120
 This is an ongoing process of what we call neurogenesis

46:47.120 --> 46:49.180
 or the birth of new neurons.

46:49.180 --> 46:52.080
 Now, this is really interesting

46:52.080 --> 46:55.060
 because other neurons in your cortex,

46:55.060 --> 46:58.480
 in your retina, in your cerebellum, they do not do this.

46:58.480 --> 47:01.320
 They are not continually replenished throughout life,

47:01.320 --> 47:03.640
 but these neurons, these olfactory neurons are,

47:03.640 --> 47:04.860
 they are special.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.720
 And there are a number of things

47:07.720 --> 47:09.820
 that seem to increase the amount

47:09.820 --> 47:12.200
 of olfactory neuron neurogenesis.

47:12.200 --> 47:15.760
 There is evidence that exercise, blood flow,

47:15.760 --> 47:18.280
 can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis,

47:18.280 --> 47:21.800
 although those data are fewer in comparison

47:21.800 --> 47:24.240
 to things like social interactions

47:24.240 --> 47:28.720
 or actually interacting with odorants of different kinds.

47:28.720 --> 47:31.720
 So if you're somebody who doesn't smell things well,

47:31.720 --> 47:33.080
 you have a poor sense of smell,

47:33.080 --> 47:35.680
 your olfactory system doesn't seem very sensitive,

47:35.680 --> 47:38.440
 more sniffing, more smelling is going to be good.

47:38.440 --> 47:41.120
 And then the molecule dopamine, this neuromodulator

47:42.320 --> 47:45.500
 that is associated with motivation and drive,

47:45.500 --> 47:48.840
 and in some cases, if it's very, very high with mania,

47:48.840 --> 47:52.080
 or if it's very, very low with depression or Parkinson's,

47:52.080 --> 47:53.760
 but for most people where dopamine

47:53.760 --> 47:55.740
 is in essentially normal ranges,

47:55.740 --> 47:59.220
 dopamine is also a powerful trigger

47:59.220 --> 48:02.100
 of the establishment of these new neurons

48:02.100 --> 48:04.300
 and their migration into the olfactory bulb

48:04.300 --> 48:05.860
 and your ability to smell.

48:06.860 --> 48:09.740
 Now, you don't want to confuse correlation with causation.

48:09.740 --> 48:11.340
 So if you're not good at smelling,

48:11.340 --> 48:12.780
 does that mean you have low dopamine?

48:12.780 --> 48:13.940
 No, not necessarily.

48:13.940 --> 48:14.980
 If you have low dopamine,

48:14.980 --> 48:16.820
 does that mean that you have a poor sense of smell?

48:16.820 --> 48:18.360
 No, not necessarily.

48:18.360 --> 48:21.580
 Some people who take antidepressants of the sort

48:21.580 --> 48:24.380
 that impact the dopamine system strongly,

48:24.380 --> 48:27.960
 like, well, butrin, will report a sudden,

48:27.960 --> 48:29.180
 meaning within a couple of days,

48:29.180 --> 48:33.500
 increase in their ability to smell particular odors.

48:33.500 --> 48:35.680
 And it's a very striking effect.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.140
 Some people, when they are in a new relationship,

48:38.140 --> 48:41.780
 because dopamine and the hormones testosterone and estrogen

48:41.780 --> 48:45.340
 are associated with novelty and the sorts of behaviors

48:45.340 --> 48:48.040
 that often are associated with new relationships,

48:48.040 --> 48:51.460
 those three molecules, dopamine, testosterone, and estrogen,

48:51.460 --> 48:56.260
 kind of work together and oftentimes people will say

48:56.260 --> 48:58.060
 or report when they're newly in love

48:58.060 --> 49:00.840
 or in a new relationship that they're just obsessed with

49:00.840 --> 49:03.280
 or they just so enjoy the scent of another person,

49:03.280 --> 49:05.940
 so much so that they like to borrow

49:05.940 --> 49:07.140
 the other person's clothing

49:07.140 --> 49:09.000
 or they'll sniff the other person's clothing,

49:09.000 --> 49:11.880
 or they can even just, in the absence of the person,

49:11.880 --> 49:15.620
 they can imagine their smell and feel a biological response,

49:15.620 --> 49:17.220
 something that we'll talk more about.

49:17.220 --> 49:19.820
 So these neurons turn over throughout the lifespan

49:19.820 --> 49:23.360
 and as we age, we actually can lose our sense of smell.

49:23.360 --> 49:25.540
 And it's likely, I want to underscore likely,

49:25.540 --> 49:27.220
 that that loss of sense of smell as we age

49:27.220 --> 49:29.740
 is correlated with a loss of other neurons

49:29.740 --> 49:31.340
 in the retina, in the ear.

49:31.340 --> 49:33.740
 So loss of vision, loss of hearing, loss of smell,

49:33.740 --> 49:38.260
 loss of the sense apparati, which are neurons,

49:38.260 --> 49:40.420
 is correlated with aging.

49:40.420 --> 49:42.300
 So what we've been talking about today

49:42.300 --> 49:44.420
 is the ability to sense these odors,

49:44.420 --> 49:46.900
 but what I'd like to do is empower you with tools

49:46.900 --> 49:48.980
 that will allow you to keep these systems tuned up.

49:48.980 --> 49:50.660
 Last time, we talked about tuning up

49:50.660 --> 49:53.820
 and keeping your visual system tuned up and healthy,

49:53.820 --> 49:54.900
 regardless of age.

49:54.900 --> 49:57.700
 Here, we're talking about really enhancing

49:57.700 --> 50:00.920
 your olfactory abilities, your taste abilities,

50:00.920 --> 50:04.940
 as well by interacting a lot with odors,

50:04.940 --> 50:09.020
 preferably positive odors, and sniffing more,

50:09.020 --> 50:11.380
 inhaling more, which almost sounds crazy,

50:11.380 --> 50:13.120
 but now you understand why,

50:13.120 --> 50:14.160
 even though it might sound crazy,

50:14.160 --> 50:16.780
 it's grounded in real mechanistic biology

50:16.780 --> 50:20.220
 of how the brain wakes up and responds to these chemicals.

50:20.220 --> 50:23.220
 Now, speaking of brain injury, olfactory dysfunction

50:23.220 --> 50:25.840
 is a common theme in traumatic brain injury

50:25.840 --> 50:27.060
 for the following reason.

50:27.060 --> 50:29.380
 These olfactory neurons, as I mentioned,

50:29.380 --> 50:33.260
 extend wires into the mucosa of the nose,

50:33.260 --> 50:35.940
 but they also extend a wire up into the skull,

50:35.940 --> 50:37.580
 and they extend up into the skull

50:37.580 --> 50:39.240
 through what's called the cribriform plate.

50:39.240 --> 50:41.620
 It's like a Swiss cheese-type plate

50:41.620 --> 50:42.740
 where they're going through,

50:42.740 --> 50:45.920
 and if you get a head hit, that bone,

50:45.920 --> 50:48.780
 the cribriform plate shears those little wires off,

50:48.780 --> 50:50.940
 and those neurons die.

50:50.940 --> 50:53.060
 Now, eventually, they'll be replaced,

50:53.060 --> 50:56.300
 but there's a phenomenon by which concussion

50:56.300 --> 50:57.740
 and the severity of concussion

50:57.740 --> 50:59.660
 and the recovery from a head injury

50:59.660 --> 51:02.700
 can actually be gauged in part, in part, not in whole,

51:02.700 --> 51:06.000
 but in part by how well or fully

51:06.000 --> 51:08.440
 one recovers their sense of smell.

51:08.440 --> 51:09.280
 So if you're somebody

51:09.280 --> 51:11.140
 that unfortunately has suffered a concussion,

51:11.140 --> 51:13.780
 your sense of smell is one readout

51:13.780 --> 51:15.200
 by which you might evaluate

51:15.200 --> 51:16.380
 whether or not you're regaining

51:16.380 --> 51:17.980
 some of your sensory performance.

51:17.980 --> 51:18.900
 Of course, there will be others

51:18.900 --> 51:21.280
 like balance and cognition and sleep, et cetera,

51:21.280 --> 51:23.740
 but I'd like to refer you to a really nice paper

51:24.940 --> 51:25.780
 which is entitled

51:25.780 --> 51:28.220
 Olfactory Dysfunction in Traumatic Brain Injury,

51:28.220 --> 51:29.940
 the Role of Neurogenesis.

51:29.940 --> 51:33.420
 The first author is Marin, M-A-R-I-N.

51:33.420 --> 51:34.500
 The paper was published

51:34.500 --> 51:37.140
 in Current Allergy and Asthma Report.

51:37.140 --> 51:38.040
 This is 2020.

51:38.040 --> 51:39.360
 I spent some time with this paper.

51:39.360 --> 51:40.200
 It's quite good.

51:40.200 --> 51:41.220
 It's a review article.

51:41.220 --> 51:43.860
 I like reviews if they're peer-reviewed reviews

51:43.860 --> 51:46.460
 and in quality journals.

51:46.460 --> 51:48.300
 And what they discuss is,

51:48.300 --> 51:49.500
 and I'll just read here briefly

51:49.500 --> 51:51.180
 because they said it better than I could,

51:51.180 --> 51:53.060
 olfactory functioning disturbances are common

51:53.060 --> 51:54.900
 following traumatic brain injury, TBI,

51:54.900 --> 51:57.580
 and can have a significant impact on the quality of life,

51:57.580 --> 51:59.240
 although there's no standard treatment for patients

51:59.240 --> 52:02.560
 with the loss of smell.

52:02.560 --> 52:05.820
 Now I'm paraphrasing post-injury.

52:05.820 --> 52:09.440
 Olfactory training has shown promise

52:09.440 --> 52:11.340
 for beneficial effects.

52:11.340 --> 52:12.840
 Some of this involves,

52:12.840 --> 52:15.540
 they go on to tell us the role of dopamine,

52:15.540 --> 52:17.920
 dopaminergic signaling, as I mentioned before.

52:17.920 --> 52:18.880
 But what does this mean?

52:18.880 --> 52:21.900
 This means that if you've had a head injury

52:21.900 --> 52:23.820
 or repeated head injuries,

52:23.820 --> 52:26.500
 that enhancing your sense of smell is one way

52:26.500 --> 52:28.760
 by which you can create new neurons.

52:28.760 --> 52:30.700
 And now you know how to enhance your sense of smell

52:30.700 --> 52:34.020
 by interacting with things that have an odor very closely

52:34.020 --> 52:36.760
 and by essentially inhaling more,

52:36.760 --> 52:39.360
 focusing on the inhale to wake up the brain

52:39.360 --> 52:42.340
 and to really focus on some of the nuance of those smells.

52:42.340 --> 52:45.300
 So you might do, for instance, a smell test

52:45.300 --> 52:47.140
 by which you smell something like a lemon,

52:47.140 --> 52:50.860
 put it down, do 10 inhales or so, smell again, et cetera.

52:50.860 --> 52:52.820
 You might also just take a more active role

52:52.820 --> 52:56.420
 in trying to taste and smell your food

52:56.420 --> 52:58.480
 and taste and smell various things.

52:58.480 --> 53:00.340
 I mean, please don't ingest anything that's poisonous

53:00.340 --> 53:01.860
 so that you're not supposed to be ingesting,

53:01.860 --> 53:03.060
 but you know what I mean.

53:03.060 --> 53:04.760
 Really tuning up this system,

53:04.760 --> 53:06.460
 I think is an excellent review.

53:06.460 --> 53:08.100
 We're going to do an entire episode

53:08.100 --> 53:10.540
 all about the use of the visual system in particular,

53:10.540 --> 53:12.420
 but also the olfactory system for treatment

53:12.420 --> 53:14.980
 of traumatic brain injury, as well as other methods.

53:14.980 --> 53:16.980
 But I wanted to just mention it here

53:16.980 --> 53:19.400
 because a number of people asked me about TBI.

53:19.400 --> 53:22.620
 And here again, we're in this place where the senses

53:22.620 --> 53:24.240
 and our ability to sense these chemicals,

53:24.240 --> 53:27.260
 so these two holes in the front of our face, our nostrils,

53:27.260 --> 53:31.560
 is a powerful readout and way to control brain function

53:31.560 --> 53:33.440
 and nervous system function generally.

53:33.440 --> 53:36.100
 Just a quick note about the use of smelling salts.

53:36.100 --> 53:38.660
 I have a feeling that some of you may be interested in that

53:38.660 --> 53:39.580
 and its application.

53:39.580 --> 53:41.320
 If you are interested in that,

53:41.320 --> 53:44.380
 I recommend you go to the scientific literature first,

53:44.380 --> 53:47.140
 rather than, you know, straight to some vendor

53:47.140 --> 53:49.820
 or to the, what do they call it these days?

53:49.820 --> 53:53.260
 Costello, bro science, he says, bro science,

53:53.260 --> 53:54.360
 the bro science.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.420
 You can go to this paper, which is excellent

53:56.420 --> 53:57.420
 and is real science,

53:57.420 --> 53:59.380
 which is acute effects of ammonia inhalants

53:59.380 --> 54:01.920
 on strength and power performance in trained men.

54:01.920 --> 54:03.500
 It's a randomized control trial.

54:03.500 --> 54:04.420
 It was published in the Journal

54:04.420 --> 54:07.500
 of Strength and Conditioning Research in 2018,

54:07.500 --> 54:09.100
 and it should be very easy to find.

54:09.100 --> 54:11.780
 I will provide a link to the so-called PubMed ID,

54:11.780 --> 54:13.900
 which is a string of numbers,

54:13.900 --> 54:14.920
 and we'll put that in the caption

54:14.920 --> 54:16.360
 if you want to go straight to that article.

54:16.360 --> 54:19.180
 It does show a significant, what they call,

54:19.180 --> 54:20.420
 this is what the words they use,

54:20.420 --> 54:22.420
 literally in quotes, psyching up effect

54:23.500 --> 54:26.580
 through the use of these ammonia inhalants

54:26.580 --> 54:30.440
 and a significant increase in maximal force,

54:30.440 --> 54:34.380
 in force development, in a variety of different movements.

54:34.380 --> 54:35.840
 So for those of you that are interested

54:35.840 --> 54:39.260
 in ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,

54:39.260 --> 54:41.200
 that might be a good reference.

54:41.200 --> 54:42.340
 The other thing I wanted to talk about

54:42.340 --> 54:44.980
 with reference to odors is this myth,

54:44.980 --> 54:48.740
 which is that we don't actually smell things in our dreams,

54:48.740 --> 54:51.420
 that we don't have a sense of smell.

54:51.420 --> 54:52.620
 That's pure fiction.

54:52.620 --> 54:54.340
 I don't know who came up with that.

54:54.340 --> 54:56.900
 It's very clear that we are capable

54:56.900 --> 54:59.460
 of smelling things in our sleep.

54:59.460 --> 55:01.940
 However, when we are in REM sleep,

55:01.940 --> 55:03.180
 rapid eye movement sleep,

55:03.180 --> 55:04.800
 which is the sleep that predominates

55:04.800 --> 55:06.680
 toward the second half of the night,

55:07.980 --> 55:12.520
 our ability to wake up in response to odors is diminished.

55:12.520 --> 55:14.440
 It's not absent, but it's diminished.

55:14.440 --> 55:16.560
 If smoke comes into the room,

55:16.560 --> 55:19.160
 we will likely wake up if the concentration of smoke

55:19.160 --> 55:22.020
 is high enough, regardless of the stage of sleep we're in.

55:22.020 --> 55:25.300
 But in REM sleep, we tend to be less likely

55:25.300 --> 55:28.020
 to smell, to sniff.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.620
 And that actually was measured in a number of studies

55:30.620 --> 55:33.540
 that sniffing in sleep is possible.

55:33.540 --> 55:35.340
 So if you put an odor like a lemon

55:35.340 --> 55:36.580
 underneath someone's nostrils

55:36.580 --> 55:40.300
 in the early portion of the night, they will smell.

55:40.300 --> 55:42.980
 And they will later, they will sniff, excuse me,

55:42.980 --> 55:43.860
 whether or not they smell or not,

55:43.860 --> 55:45.860
 I guess depends on them and when they showered last,

55:45.860 --> 55:47.580
 but they will definitely sniff.

55:47.580 --> 55:49.900
 And they will report later,

55:49.900 --> 55:51.820
 especially if you wake them up soon after,

55:51.820 --> 55:54.980
 that they had a dream or a percept

55:54.980 --> 55:57.900
 of the scent of a lemon, for instance.

55:57.900 --> 55:58.720
 Later in the night,

55:58.720 --> 56:01.180
 it's harder for that relationship to be established.

56:01.180 --> 56:03.180
 It's likely that because of some of the paralysis

56:03.180 --> 56:05.440
 associated with rapid eye movement, sleep,

56:05.440 --> 56:08.480
 which is a healthy paralysis, so-called sleepatonia,

56:08.480 --> 56:10.980
 you don't want to act out your dreams in REM sleep,

56:10.980 --> 56:14.860
 that there is a less active tendency to sniff.

56:14.860 --> 56:17.820
 And actually this has real clinical implications.

56:17.820 --> 56:20.980
 The ability to sniff in response

56:20.980 --> 56:25.340
 to the introduction of an odor is actually one way

56:25.340 --> 56:28.900
 in which clinicians assess whether or not somebody's brain

56:28.900 --> 56:31.820
 is so-called brain dead, that's not a nice term,

56:31.820 --> 56:35.000
 but brain dead, or whether or not they have the capacity

56:35.000 --> 56:37.580
 to recover from things like coma

56:37.580 --> 56:40.220
 and other states of deep unconsciousness,

56:40.220 --> 56:42.620
 or I guess you could call it subconsciousness.

56:42.620 --> 56:45.380
 So what will happen is if someone has an injury

56:45.380 --> 56:48.040
 and they're essentially out cold,

56:48.040 --> 56:53.040
 the production of a sniffing reflex or a sniffing response

56:53.580 --> 56:55.660
 to say a lemon or some other odor

56:55.660 --> 56:58.180
 presented below the nostrils is considered a sign

56:58.180 --> 57:00.860
 that the brain is capable of waking up.

57:00.860 --> 57:03.740
 Now that's not always the case, but it's one indication.

57:03.740 --> 57:07.060
 So just like you could use mechanosensation,

57:07.060 --> 57:09.740
 so a toe pinch, for instance,

57:09.740 --> 57:12.200
 or scraping the bottom of somebody's bare foot

57:12.200 --> 57:13.980
 to see if they're conscious,

57:13.980 --> 57:15.820
 or shining light in their eyes,

57:15.820 --> 57:16.780
 these are all things that you've seen

57:16.780 --> 57:17.780
 in movies and television,

57:17.780 --> 57:20.420
 or maybe you've seen in real life as well.

57:20.420 --> 57:23.100
 Well, odors and chemical sensing is another way

57:23.100 --> 57:24.500
 by which you can assess whether or not

57:24.500 --> 57:26.980
 the brain is capable of arousal.

57:26.980 --> 57:29.260
 And actually olfactory stimulation

57:29.260 --> 57:31.060
 is one of the more prominent ones

57:31.060 --> 57:33.420
 that's being used in various clinics.

57:33.420 --> 57:37.080
 As a last point about specific odors and compounds

57:37.080 --> 57:39.420
 that can increase arousal and alertness,

57:39.420 --> 57:41.300
 and this was simply through sniffing them,

57:41.300 --> 57:42.840
 not through ingesting them.

57:42.840 --> 57:44.740
 There are data, believe it or not,

57:44.740 --> 57:47.300
 there are good data on peppermint

57:47.300 --> 57:49.300
 and the smell of peppermint.

57:49.300 --> 57:53.500
 Minty type scents, whether you like them or not,

57:53.500 --> 57:55.700
 will increase attention,

57:55.700 --> 57:59.260
 and they can create the same sort of arousal response,

57:59.260 --> 58:00.860
 although not as intensely

58:00.860 --> 58:04.260
 or as dramatically as ammonia salts can, for instance.

58:04.260 --> 58:06.500
 By the way, please don't go sniff real ammonia.

58:06.500 --> 58:08.660
 You could actually damage your olfactory epithelium

58:08.660 --> 58:10.660
 if you do that too close to the ammonia.

58:10.660 --> 58:11.700
 If you're going to use smelling salts,

58:11.700 --> 58:13.440
 be sure you work with someone

58:13.440 --> 58:15.940
 or you know what you're getting and how you're using this.

58:15.940 --> 58:18.420
 You can damage your olfactory pathway

58:18.420 --> 58:19.500
 in ways that are pretty severe.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.060
 You can also damage your vision.

58:21.060 --> 58:22.120
 If you've ever teared up

58:22.120 --> 58:24.540
 because you inhaled something that was really noxious,

58:24.540 --> 58:27.140
 that is not a good thing,

58:27.140 --> 58:28.820
 doesn't mean you necessarily cause damage,

58:28.820 --> 58:32.780
 but it means that you have irritated the mucosal lining

58:32.780 --> 58:35.500
 and possibly even the surfaces of your eyes.

58:35.500 --> 58:38.140
 So please be very, very careful.

58:38.140 --> 58:42.340
 Scents like peppermint, like these ammonia smelling salts,

58:42.340 --> 58:43.520
 the reason they wake you up

58:43.520 --> 58:46.660
 is because they trigger specific olfactory neurons

58:46.660 --> 58:49.020
 that communicate with the specific centers of the brain,

58:49.020 --> 58:51.380
 namely the amygdala and associated neural circuitry

58:51.380 --> 58:54.680
 and pathways that trigger alertness of the same sort

58:54.680 --> 58:58.700
 that a cold shower or an ice bath or a sudden surprise

58:58.700 --> 59:01.320
 or a stressful text message would evoke.

59:01.320 --> 59:04.240
 Remember, the systems of your body

59:04.240 --> 59:07.260
 that produce arousal and alertness and attention

59:07.260 --> 59:10.520
 and that cue you for optimal learning, AKA focus,

59:10.520 --> 59:12.060
 those are very general mechanisms.

59:12.060 --> 59:13.980
 They involve very basic molecules

59:13.980 --> 59:15.380
 like adrenaline and epinephrine,

59:15.380 --> 59:18.320
 same thing actually, adrenaline and epinephrine.

59:18.320 --> 59:20.180
 The number of stimuli,

59:20.180 --> 59:23.780
 whether it's peppermint or ammonia or a loud blast,

59:24.980 --> 59:26.940
 the number of stimuli that can evoke

59:26.940 --> 59:30.020
 that adrenaline response and that wake up response

59:30.020 --> 59:31.580
 are near infinite.

59:31.580 --> 59:33.580
 And that's the beauty of your nervous system.

59:33.580 --> 59:37.060
 It was designed to take any variety of different stimuli,

59:37.060 --> 59:38.700
 place them into categories

59:38.700 --> 59:40.940
 and then evoke different categories

59:40.940 --> 59:43.080
 of very general responses.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.600
 Now you know a lot about olfaction

59:44.600 --> 59:46.020
 and how the sense of smell works.

59:46.020 --> 59:48.780
 Here's another experiment that you can do.

59:48.780 --> 59:50.680
 I'll ask you right now.

59:50.680 --> 59:54.860
 Do you like, hate, or are you indifferent

59:54.860 --> 59:57.140
 to the smell of microwave popcorn?

59:58.440 --> 1:00:01.760
 Some people, including one member of my podcast staff,

1:00:01.760 --> 1:00:05.060
 says it's absolutely disgusting to them.

1:00:05.060 --> 1:00:07.800
 They feel like it's completely nauseating.

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:08.640
 I don't mind it at all.

1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:09.860
 In fact, I kind of like it.

1:00:09.860 --> 1:00:12.300
 I think the smell of microwave popcorn is kind of pleasant.

1:00:12.300 --> 1:00:13.520
 I don't particularly like it,

1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:15.220
 but it's certainly not unpleasant.

1:00:15.220 --> 1:00:20.220
 Some people have a gene that makes them sensitive

1:00:21.740 --> 1:00:24.340
 to the smell of things like microwave popcorn

1:00:24.340 --> 1:00:26.720
 such that it smells like vomit.

1:00:27.800 --> 1:00:29.920
 I probably don't have that gene

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:32.080
 because I find the smell of microwave popcorn

1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:33.620
 pretty pleasant.

1:00:33.620 --> 1:00:37.540
 Some people hate the smell of cilantro.

1:00:37.540 --> 1:00:40.500
 Some people ingest asparagus,

1:00:40.500 --> 1:00:41.500
 and when they urinate,

1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:44.660
 they can smell the asparagus in a very pungent way.

1:00:44.660 --> 1:00:47.040
 Other people can't smell it at all.

1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:50.140
 These are variants in genes that encode

1:00:50.140 --> 1:00:53.860
 for what are called olfactory receptors.

1:00:53.860 --> 1:00:58.580
 Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene,

1:00:58.580 --> 1:01:01.220
 one gene that codes for a receptor

1:01:01.220 --> 1:01:03.400
 that responds to a particular odor.

1:01:03.400 --> 1:01:04.800
 If you don't have that gene,

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:07.220
 you will not respond to that odor.

1:01:07.220 --> 1:01:09.640
 So the reason why some people find

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:12.780
 the smell of microwave popcorn to be very noxious,

1:01:12.780 --> 1:01:14.880
 putrid in fact, is because they have a gene

1:01:14.880 --> 1:01:18.420
 that allows them to smell the kind of putrid odor

1:01:18.420 --> 1:01:19.260
 within that.

1:01:20.120 --> 1:01:23.500
 Other people who lack that gene just simply can't smell it.

1:01:23.500 --> 1:01:25.380
 So we are not all the same

1:01:25.380 --> 1:01:27.340
 with respect to our sensory experience.

1:01:27.340 --> 1:01:29.420
 What one person finds delicious,

1:01:29.420 --> 1:01:31.100
 another person might find disgusting.

1:01:31.100 --> 1:01:32.940
 I'll give a good example,

1:01:32.940 --> 1:01:37.460
 which is that I absolutely despise gorgonzola and blue cheese

1:01:37.460 --> 1:01:38.540
 I absolutely despise it.

1:01:38.540 --> 1:01:43.540
 It smells and tastes like dirty moldy socks to me.

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:46.560
 Some people love it, they crave it.

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:49.060
 Actually, some people get a visceral response to it.

1:01:49.060 --> 1:01:51.700
 And we will talk about how certain tastes

1:01:51.700 --> 1:01:55.580
 can actually evoke very deep biological responses,

1:01:55.580 --> 1:01:57.180
 even hormonal responses

1:01:57.180 --> 1:01:59.580
 when we talk about taste in a few minutes.

1:01:59.580 --> 1:02:02.780
 But there are these odors, for instance, in popcorn,

1:02:02.780 --> 1:02:07.780
 it's the molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyroline,

1:02:07.780 --> 1:02:09.740
 not proline, but pyroline,

1:02:09.740 --> 1:02:12.640
 that gives off to some people like me a toasted smell

1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:14.840
 as the sugars in the kernels heat.

1:02:14.840 --> 1:02:17.280
 But the compound is also found

1:02:17.280 --> 1:02:19.320
 in things like white bread and jasmine rice,

1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:21.960
 which don't have as pungent an odor.

1:02:21.960 --> 1:02:26.780
 But some people smell that and it smells like cat urine.

1:02:26.780 --> 1:02:31.780
 Now there are scents like musky scents and musty scents

1:02:31.980 --> 1:02:34.420
 that are secreted by animals like skunks

1:02:34.420 --> 1:02:37.800
 and other animals of the so-called mustelid family.

1:02:37.800 --> 1:02:40.520
 So these would be ferrets and other animals

1:02:40.520 --> 1:02:43.660
 that can spray in response to fear,

1:02:43.660 --> 1:02:45.400
 or if they just want to mark a territory

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:47.080
 because they want to say, that's mine.

1:02:47.080 --> 1:02:48.720
 Dogs incidentally have scent glands

1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:51.080
 that they rub on things, cats have them too.

1:02:51.080 --> 1:02:54.940
 This musty odor, some people find actually quite pleasant.

1:02:54.940 --> 1:02:57.360
 Some people find it to be very noxious.

1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:00.720
 And that will depend, of course, on the concentration.

1:03:00.720 --> 1:03:03.400
 I'll never forget the first time Costello

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:06.100
 got sprayed by a skunk and it was awful.

1:03:06.100 --> 1:03:09.460
 I actually don't mind the smell of skunk at a distance.

1:03:09.460 --> 1:03:10.680
 It's actually a little bit pleasant.

1:03:10.680 --> 1:03:12.780
 I admit it's a little bit pleasant to me.

1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:13.980
 I don't think that makes me too weird

1:03:13.980 --> 1:03:15.200
 because have you ever read the book,

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:18.200
 "'All's Quiet on the Western Front' about World War I?"

1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:19.740
 There's a description in there

1:03:19.740 --> 1:03:21.540
 about the smell of skunk at a distance

1:03:21.540 --> 1:03:22.840
 being mildly pleasant.

1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:25.200
 So the author of that book probably shared

1:03:25.200 --> 1:03:29.980
 a similar olfactory profile to me or I to them rather.

1:03:29.980 --> 1:03:32.360
 But some people find even the tiniest bit

1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:36.360
 of the smell of skunk or must to be noxious or awful.

1:03:36.360 --> 1:03:38.520
 Now, of course, in high concentrations, it's really awful.

1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:39.680
 And unfortunately, poor Costello,

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:43.360
 he was like literally red-eyed and just snorting

1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:44.440
 and it was awful.

1:03:44.440 --> 1:03:47.140
 There's a joke about dogs that says that dogs

1:03:47.140 --> 1:03:50.160
 either get skunked one time and never again

1:03:50.160 --> 1:03:51.480
 or 50 or 100 times.

1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:54.680
 Costello has been skunked no fewer, I'm not making this up,

1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:58.160
 has been skunked no fewer than 103 times.

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:00.480
 And that's because if he sees something

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:01.400
 or hears something in the bushes,

1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:03.920
 he just goes straight in, he does not learn.

1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:07.840
 But if you like the musty scent or musky scent,

1:04:08.660 --> 1:04:10.320
 well, that says something about the genes

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:12.460
 that you express in your olfactory neurons.

1:04:12.460 --> 1:04:14.880
 It is completely inherited.

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:17.400
 And if you don't like that scent, if it's really noxious

1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:19.140
 or you have this response to microwave popcorn,

1:04:19.140 --> 1:04:21.200
 well, that means you have a different complement,

1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:23.740
 a different constellation, if you will,

1:04:23.740 --> 1:04:27.720
 of genes that make up for these olfactory sensory neurons

1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:29.640
 and the receptors that they express.

1:04:29.640 --> 1:04:31.260
 Let's talk about taste.

1:04:31.260 --> 1:04:33.860
 Not whether or not you have taste or you don't have taste,

1:04:33.860 --> 1:04:36.040
 there's no way for me to assess that,

1:04:36.040 --> 1:04:39.480
 but rather how we taste things,

1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:44.400
 meaning how we sense chemicals in food and in drink.

1:04:44.400 --> 1:04:46.140
 There are essentially five,

1:04:46.140 --> 1:04:50.000
 but scientists now believe there may be six things

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.840
 that we taste alone or in combination.

1:04:53.840 --> 1:04:58.840
 They are sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes,

1:04:58.840 --> 1:05:03.840
 sour tastes, and umami taste.

1:05:04.780 --> 1:05:06.860
 Most of you have probably heard of umami by now.

1:05:06.860 --> 1:05:09.660
 It's U-M-A-M-I.

1:05:09.660 --> 1:05:14.020
 Umami is actually the name for a particular receptor

1:05:14.020 --> 1:05:15.420
 that you express on your tongue

1:05:15.420 --> 1:05:19.100
 that detects savory tastes.

1:05:19.980 --> 1:05:22.780
 So it's the kind of thing in braised meats.

1:05:22.780 --> 1:05:26.860
 Sometimes people can even get the activation of umami

1:05:26.860 --> 1:05:29.360
 by tomatoes or tomato sauces.

1:05:31.060 --> 1:05:32.740
 What are each of these tastes

1:05:32.740 --> 1:05:34.980
 and taste receptors responsible for?

1:05:34.980 --> 1:05:36.380
 And then we'll talk about the sixth.

1:05:36.380 --> 1:05:37.500
 Maybe you can guess what it is.

1:05:37.500 --> 1:05:38.740
 I don't know if you can guess it now.

1:05:38.740 --> 1:05:42.060
 I couldn't guess it, but of the five tastes,

1:05:42.060 --> 1:05:45.420
 each one has a specific utility or function.

1:05:46.380 --> 1:05:50.960
 Each one has a particular group of neurons in your mouth,

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:53.260
 in your tongue, believe it or not,

1:05:53.260 --> 1:05:55.860
 that responds to particular chemicals

1:05:55.860 --> 1:05:58.340
 and particular chemical structures.

1:05:58.340 --> 1:06:01.420
 It is a total myth, complete fiction,

1:06:01.420 --> 1:06:03.100
 that different parts of your tongue

1:06:03.100 --> 1:06:06.040
 harbor different taste receptors.

1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:07.820
 You know, that high school textbook diagram

1:06:07.820 --> 1:06:09.780
 that sweet is in one part of the tongue

1:06:09.780 --> 1:06:12.300
 and sour is in another and bitter is in another,

1:06:12.300 --> 1:06:14.740
 complete fiction, just total fiction

1:06:14.740 --> 1:06:16.860
 related to very old studies that were performed

1:06:16.860 --> 1:06:18.740
 in a very poorly controlled way.

1:06:18.740 --> 1:06:20.940
 No serious biologist,

1:06:20.940 --> 1:06:22.340
 and certainly no one that works on taste,

1:06:22.340 --> 1:06:25.220
 would contend that that's the way

1:06:25.220 --> 1:06:26.940
 that the taste receptors are organized.

1:06:26.940 --> 1:06:29.420
 They are completely intermixed along your tongue.

1:06:29.420 --> 1:06:32.580
 If you have heightened or decreased sensitivity

1:06:32.580 --> 1:06:34.620
 to one of those five things I mentioned,

1:06:34.620 --> 1:06:36.600
 sweet, salty, bitter, umami, or sour,

1:06:36.600 --> 1:06:37.820
 at one location in your tongue,

1:06:37.820 --> 1:06:42.820
 it likely reflects the density of overall receptors

1:06:43.140 --> 1:06:45.860
 or something going on in your brain,

1:06:45.860 --> 1:06:49.600
 but not the differential distribution of those receptors.

1:06:50.460 --> 1:06:55.180
 So the sweet receptors are neurons that express a receptor.

1:06:55.180 --> 1:06:57.540
 That respond to sugars.

1:06:57.540 --> 1:06:59.220
 In the same way that you have cones,

1:06:59.220 --> 1:07:01.940
 photoreceptors in your eye that respond to short,

1:07:01.940 --> 1:07:03.740
 medium, or long wavelength light,

1:07:03.740 --> 1:07:07.520
 meaning bluish, greenish, or reddish light,

1:07:07.520 --> 1:07:12.280
 you have a neuron in, or neurons, plural, in your tongue

1:07:13.220 --> 1:07:15.900
 that respond to sugars.

1:07:15.900 --> 1:07:18.700
 And then those neurons, they don't say sweet.

1:07:18.700 --> 1:07:21.180
 They don't actually send any sugar into the brain.

1:07:21.180 --> 1:07:23.180
 They send what we call a volley,

1:07:23.180 --> 1:07:25.700
 a barrage of action potentials of electrical signals

1:07:25.700 --> 1:07:26.860
 off into the brain.

1:07:26.860 --> 1:07:28.500
 It's an amazing system.

1:07:28.500 --> 1:07:30.360
 So all these receptors in your tongue

1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:33.300
 make up what are called the neurons

1:07:33.300 --> 1:07:34.740
 that give rise to a nerve,

1:07:34.740 --> 1:07:37.460
 a collection of wires, nerve bundles

1:07:37.460 --> 1:07:39.820
 of what's called the gustatory nerve.

1:07:39.820 --> 1:07:41.620
 It goes from the tongue

1:07:41.620 --> 1:07:44.620
 to the so-called nucleus of the solitary tracts.

1:07:44.620 --> 1:07:46.260
 And some of you requested names.

1:07:46.260 --> 1:07:48.180
 I usually don't like to include too many names

1:07:48.180 --> 1:07:49.100
 for sake of clarity,

1:07:49.100 --> 1:07:51.240
 but the gustatory nerve from the tongue

1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:53.580
 goes to the nucleus of the solitary tract,

1:07:53.580 --> 1:07:56.620
 and then to the thalamus, and to insular cortex.

1:07:56.620 --> 1:07:58.500
 You don't have to remember any of those names

1:07:58.500 --> 1:07:59.380
 if you don't want to,

1:07:59.380 --> 1:08:01.260
 but if you want mechanism, you want neural circuits,

1:08:01.260 --> 1:08:02.080
 that's the circuit.

1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:04.720
 Gustatory nerve from the tongue,

1:08:04.720 --> 1:08:06.560
 nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem,

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:09.100
 then the thalamus, and then insular cortex.

1:08:09.100 --> 1:08:10.580
 And it is an insular cortex,

1:08:10.580 --> 1:08:12.700
 this region of our cortex that we sort out

1:08:12.700 --> 1:08:16.020
 and make sense of and perceive the various tastes.

1:08:16.020 --> 1:08:20.140
 Now, it's amazing because just taking a little bit of sugar

1:08:20.140 --> 1:08:22.520
 or something sour, like a little bit of lemon juice,

1:08:22.520 --> 1:08:27.020
 and touching it to the tongue within 100 milliseconds,

1:08:27.020 --> 1:08:30.780
 right, just 100 milliseconds, far less than one second,

1:08:30.780 --> 1:08:32.680
 you can immediately distinguish,

1:08:32.680 --> 1:08:37.140
 ah, that's sour, that's sweet, that's bitter, that's umami.

1:08:37.140 --> 1:08:41.620
 And that's an assessment that's made by the cortex.

1:08:41.620 --> 1:08:46.140
 Now, what do these different five receptors encode for?

1:08:46.140 --> 1:08:47.900
 Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,

1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:49.840
 but what are they really looking for?

1:08:49.840 --> 1:08:51.480
 What are they sensing?

1:08:51.480 --> 1:08:55.820
 Well, sweet stuff signals the presence of energy, of sugars.

1:08:55.820 --> 1:08:57.040
 And while we're all trying,

1:08:57.040 --> 1:08:59.140
 or we're told that we should eat less sugar

1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:01.580
 for a variety of reasons,

1:09:03.020 --> 1:09:05.060
 the ability to sense whether or not a food

1:09:05.060 --> 1:09:07.860
 has rapid energy source

1:09:07.860 --> 1:09:09.880
 or could give rise to glucose is essential,

1:09:09.880 --> 1:09:11.460
 so we have sweet receptors.

1:09:11.460 --> 1:09:14.540
 The salty receptors, these neurons,

1:09:14.540 --> 1:09:18.080
 are trying to sense whether or not there are electrolytes

1:09:18.080 --> 1:09:20.780
 in a given food or drink.

1:09:20.780 --> 1:09:22.320
 Electrolytes are vitally important

1:09:22.320 --> 1:09:23.620
 for the function of our nervous system

1:09:23.620 --> 1:09:24.740
 and for our entire body.

1:09:24.740 --> 1:09:28.140
 Sodium is what allows neurons to fire,

1:09:28.140 --> 1:09:30.560
 what allows them to be electrically active.

1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:32.260
 We also need potassium and magnesium.

1:09:32.260 --> 1:09:35.440
 Those are the ions that allow the neurons to be active.

1:09:35.440 --> 1:09:38.600
 So the salty receptors, the reason that they are there

1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:40.500
 is to make sure that we are getting enough,

1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:42.180
 but not too much salt.

1:09:42.180 --> 1:09:44.880
 We don't want to ingest things that are far too salty.

1:09:44.880 --> 1:09:49.880
 Bitter receptors are there to make sure

1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:52.320
 we don't ingest things that are poisonous.

1:09:52.320 --> 1:09:53.160
 How do I know this?

1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:54.040
 How can I say that?

1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:56.000
 Even though I was definitely not consulted

1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:57.580
 at the design phase, how can I say that?

1:09:57.580 --> 1:10:00.520
 Well, the bitter receptors create a,

1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:01.760
 what we call labeled line,

1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:05.560
 a unique trajectory to the neurons of the brainstem

1:10:05.560 --> 1:10:08.420
 that control the gag reflex.

1:10:09.320 --> 1:10:11.480
 If we taste something very bitter,

1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.520
 it automatically triggers the gag reflex.

1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:15.800
 Now, some people like bitter taste.

1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:17.760
 I actually like the taste of bitter coffee.

1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:19.440
 Children generally like sweet tastes

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:20.740
 more than bitter tastes,

1:10:20.740 --> 1:10:22.640
 but even babies, if they taste something bitter,

1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:24.160
 they'll just immediately spit it up

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:26.020
 as like the gag reflex.

1:10:26.020 --> 1:10:29.840
 Putrid smells will also evoke these same neurons.

1:10:29.840 --> 1:10:31.640
 So some people are very sensitive.

1:10:31.640 --> 1:10:36.280
 They have a very sensitive or low threshold vomit reflex.

1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:39.720
 There was somebody in my lab early on.

1:10:39.720 --> 1:10:40.680
 We never did this intentionally.

1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:43.240
 We were just laughing because it was so dramatic.

1:10:43.240 --> 1:10:44.280
 We would have a discussion.

1:10:44.280 --> 1:10:48.120
 Someone would say something about something kind of gross,

1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:50.080
 appropriate for the workplace, but nonetheless gross.

1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:51.380
 We are biologists.

1:10:51.380 --> 1:10:52.960
 We'd say something and they would say,

1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:54.960
 stop, stop, stop, I'm going to throw up, you know?

1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:57.600
 And some people have a very low threshold,

1:10:57.600 --> 1:10:59.760
 quick gag reflex.

1:10:59.760 --> 1:11:00.800
 Other people don't.

1:11:00.800 --> 1:11:02.920
 Other people have a very stable stomach.

1:11:02.920 --> 1:11:05.560
 They don't, you know, they rarely, if ever, vomit.

1:11:06.400 --> 1:11:10.020
 The umami receptor isn't sensing savory

1:11:10.020 --> 1:11:12.440
 because the body loves savory.

1:11:12.440 --> 1:11:14.640
 It's because savory is a signal

1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:16.880
 for the presence of amino acids.

1:11:16.880 --> 1:11:18.200
 And we'll talk more about this,

1:11:18.200 --> 1:11:21.800
 but the presence of amino acids in our gut

1:11:21.800 --> 1:11:23.740
 and in our digestive system

1:11:23.740 --> 1:11:27.240
 and the presence of fatty acids is essential.

1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:30.960
 There is in fact, no essential carbohydrate or sugar.

1:11:30.960 --> 1:11:33.560
 Now I'm not a huge proponent of ketogenic diets,

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:34.560
 nor am I against them.

1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:36.720
 I think it's highly individual.

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:38.800
 You have to decide what's right for you,

1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:42.040
 but everybody needs amino acids to survive.

1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:44.640
 The brain needs them and we need fatty acids,

1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:46.880
 especially to build a healthy brain during development.

1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:49.880
 You need amino acids and fatty acids.

1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:53.300
 And the sour receptor, why would we have a sour receptor

1:11:53.300 --> 1:11:56.080
 so that we could have those really like sour candies?

1:11:56.080 --> 1:11:57.920
 I think they've gotten more and more sour over the years.

1:11:57.920 --> 1:11:59.980
 I admit I don't eat candy much,

1:11:59.980 --> 1:12:02.560
 but I do have a particular weakness

1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:07.560
 for like a really good, really sour, like gummy peach.

1:12:07.920 --> 1:12:09.800
 Or if the gummy cherries are dipped

1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:11.200
 in whatever that sour powder.

1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:13.000
 So I was a kid who, I admit it,

1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:14.320
 I liked the liquor made thing.

1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:15.620
 I like drink the powder.

1:12:15.620 --> 1:12:16.460
 Please don't do this.

1:12:16.460 --> 1:12:18.460
 Don't give this garbage to your kids.

1:12:19.780 --> 1:12:20.620
 But I liked it.

1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:21.680
 It was tasty.

1:12:21.680 --> 1:12:25.020
 But sour receptors are not there

1:12:25.020 --> 1:12:27.960
 so that you can ingest gummy, sour gummy peaches

1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:28.800
 or something like that.

1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:31.000
 That's not why the system evolved.

1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.960
 It's there and we know it's there

1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:38.000
 to detect the presence of spoiled or fermented food.

1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:40.800
 Fermented fruit has a sour element to it.

1:12:40.800 --> 1:12:42.080
 And fermented things,

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:44.120
 while certainly some fermented foods

1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:46.160
 like sauerkraut and kimchi and things of that sort

1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:47.320
 can be very healthy for us

1:12:47.320 --> 1:12:49.320
 and are very healthy in reducing inflammation.

1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:50.820
 There are great data on that.

1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:56.220
 Pro quality microbiome, et cetera.

1:12:57.680 --> 1:12:59.700
 Fermented fruit can be poisonous, right?

1:12:59.700 --> 1:13:03.880
 Alcohols are poisonous in many forms to our system.

1:13:03.880 --> 1:13:08.200
 And the sour receptor bearing neurons

1:13:08.200 --> 1:13:10.540
 communicate to an area of the brainstem

1:13:10.540 --> 1:13:13.300
 that evokes the pucker response.

1:13:13.300 --> 1:13:16.560
 Closing of the eyes and essentially shutting of the mouth

1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:18.040
 and cringing away.

1:13:18.040 --> 1:13:20.040
 I think cringe is like a thing now my niece,

1:13:20.040 --> 1:13:22.080
 whenever I seem to say something or do something,

1:13:22.080 --> 1:13:26.440
 it's either an eye roll, a cringe or both in combination.

1:13:26.440 --> 1:13:30.800
 So the sour, the sweet, the salty, the bitter

1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:33.220
 and the umami system were not there

1:13:33.220 --> 1:13:35.820
 so that we could have this wonderful pallet of foods

1:13:35.820 --> 1:13:37.100
 that we enjoy so much.

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:39.500
 They'll allow us to do that,

1:13:39.500 --> 1:13:40.600
 but they're there to make sure

1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:42.400
 that we bring in certain things to our system

1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:44.880
 and that we don't ingest other things.

1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:48.900
 Now what's the sixth sense within the taste system?

1:13:48.900 --> 1:13:50.760
 Not sixth sense generally, but within the taste system.

1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:54.440
 What's this putative possible sixth receptor?

1:13:54.440 --> 1:13:56.200
 I already kind of hinted at it

1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:58.160
 when I talked about fatty acids.

1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:01.840
 There are now data to support the idea,

1:14:01.840 --> 1:14:03.920
 although there's still more work that needs to be done,

1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:07.180
 that we also have receptors on our tongue that sense fat.

1:14:07.180 --> 1:14:10.880
 And that because fat is so vital

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:13.020
 for the function of our nervous system

1:14:13.020 --> 1:14:15.180
 and the other organs of our body,

1:14:15.180 --> 1:14:17.920
 that we are sensing the fat content in food.

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:21.240
 Maybe this is why I can only eat half,

1:14:21.240 --> 1:14:23.600
 but no less than half of a jar of almond butter

1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:25.220
 or peanut butter in one sitting.

1:14:25.220 --> 1:14:26.680
 I just can't, unless it's not salt,

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:28.760
 in which case it makes no sense to me,

1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:33.360
 but it's remarkable how that texture

1:14:33.360 --> 1:14:36.480
 and also the flavor, but that texture of fat,

1:14:36.480 --> 1:14:37.440
 I love butter.

1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:39.800
 I am guilty and Costello is definitely guilty

1:14:39.800 --> 1:14:41.920
 of eating pats of butter from time to time.

1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:42.980
 I have no guilt about this.

1:14:42.980 --> 1:14:44.120
 People eat pats of cheese.

1:14:44.120 --> 1:14:46.200
 Why shouldn't we eat a pat of butter?

1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:47.300
 If you think that's gross,

1:14:47.300 --> 1:14:50.100
 then maybe I have greater abundance

1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:52.320
 of the fat receptors in my tongue.

1:14:52.320 --> 1:14:55.340
 Maybe I have a fat tongue than you do.

1:14:55.340 --> 1:14:59.600
 But nonetheless, the ability to sense fat here in our mouth

1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:01.320
 seems to be critical.

1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:03.020
 You can imagine why that is.

1:15:03.020 --> 1:15:06.920
 I want to talk about the tongue and the mouth

1:15:06.920 --> 1:15:09.880
 as an extension of your digestive tract.

1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:12.040
 I know that might not be pleasant to think about,

1:15:12.040 --> 1:15:13.920
 but when you look at it through the lens

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:15.040
 that I'm about to provide,

1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:16.620
 it will completely change the way you think

1:15:16.620 --> 1:15:18.600
 about the gut brain and about all the stuff

1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:20.500
 that you've heard in these recent years about,

1:15:20.500 --> 1:15:22.480
 oh, you know, we have the second brain.

1:15:22.480 --> 1:15:23.640
 It's all these neurons in our gut.

1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:26.960
 I've been chuckling through these last few years

1:15:26.960 --> 1:15:29.360
 as people have gotten so excited about the gut brain,

1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:30.800
 not because of their excitement.

1:15:30.800 --> 1:15:32.240
 I think their excitement is wonderful,

1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:34.080
 but we always knew that the nervous system

1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:38.400
 extended out of the brain and into the body.

1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:41.200
 And people seem kind of overwhelmed and surprised

1:15:41.200 --> 1:15:43.660
 by the idea that we have neurons in our gut

1:15:43.660 --> 1:15:46.520
 that can sense things like sugars and fatty acids.

1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:48.240
 And I think those are beautiful discoveries.

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:49.080
 Don't get me wrong.

1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:51.400
 Diego Borges' lab out of Duke University

1:15:51.400 --> 1:15:53.600
 has done beautiful studies showing

1:15:53.600 --> 1:15:56.360
 that within the mucosal lining of our gut,

1:15:56.360 --> 1:15:58.480
 we have neurons that sense fatty acids,

1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:00.840
 sugars, and amino acids.

1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:02.880
 And that when we ingest something

1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:05.460
 that contains one or two or three of those things,

1:16:05.460 --> 1:16:07.920
 there's a signal sent via the vagus nerve

1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:12.920
 up into what's called the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,

1:16:13.060 --> 1:16:15.520
 and then into the brain where it secretes dopamine,

1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:17.320
 which makes us want more of that thing.

1:16:17.320 --> 1:16:19.860
 It makes us more motivated to pursue

1:16:19.860 --> 1:16:21.640
 and eat more of that thing

1:16:21.640 --> 1:16:25.240
 that's either fatty or umami, it's savory,

1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:27.920
 or has a sweet taste,

1:16:27.920 --> 1:16:31.660
 any one or two or three of those qualities,

1:16:31.660 --> 1:16:33.520
 independent of the taste.

1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:35.240
 Now, I think those are beautiful data,

1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:38.360
 but we know that this thing, the mouth,

1:16:38.360 --> 1:16:39.200
 for those of you listening,

1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:40.600
 I've got a couple fingers in my mouth.

1:16:40.600 --> 1:16:43.260
 That's why I sound like I'm on something in my mouth.

1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:46.640
 This thing in the front of our face,

1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:47.560
 we use it for speaking,

1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:49.540
 but it is the front of our digestive tract.

1:16:49.540 --> 1:16:51.800
 We are essentially a series of tubes,

1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:53.600
 and that tube starts with your mouth

1:16:54.480 --> 1:16:56.400
 and heads down into your stomach.

1:16:56.400 --> 1:16:59.100
 And so that you would sense

1:16:59.100 --> 1:17:01.460
 so much of the chemical constituents of the stuff

1:17:01.460 --> 1:17:03.700
 that you might bring into your body

1:17:03.700 --> 1:17:05.040
 or that you might want to expel

1:17:05.040 --> 1:17:07.560
 and not swallow or not interact with

1:17:07.560 --> 1:17:09.160
 by being able to smell it.

1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:10.000
 Is it putrid?

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:11.360
 Does it smell good?

1:17:11.360 --> 1:17:12.320
 Does it taste good?

1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:13.140
 Is this safe?

1:17:13.140 --> 1:17:13.980
 Is it salty?

1:17:13.980 --> 1:17:17.200
 Is it so sour that it's fermented and is going to poison me?

1:17:17.200 --> 1:17:19.700
 Is it so bitter that it could poison me?

1:17:19.700 --> 1:17:22.080
 Is it so savory that, mm,

1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:23.880
 yes, I want more and more of this?

1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:25.220
 Well, then you'd want to trigger dopamine.

1:17:25.220 --> 1:17:27.300
 That's all starting in the mouth.

1:17:27.300 --> 1:17:31.080
 So you have to understand that you were equipped

1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:34.640
 with this amazing chemical sensing apparatus

1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:36.680
 we call your mouth and your tongue.

1:17:36.680 --> 1:17:38.400
 And those little bumps on your tongue

1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:39.920
 that they call the papillae,

1:17:39.920 --> 1:17:41.520
 those are not your taste buds.

1:17:41.520 --> 1:17:44.340
 Surrounding those little papillae,

1:17:44.340 --> 1:17:45.800
 like little rivers,

1:17:45.800 --> 1:17:48.280
 are these little dents and indentations.

1:17:48.280 --> 1:17:50.900
 And what dents and indentations do in a tissue

1:17:50.900 --> 1:17:52.480
 is they allow more surface area.

1:17:52.480 --> 1:17:54.680
 They allow you to pack more receptors.

1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:57.600
 So down in those grooves are where all these little neurons

1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:01.680
 and their little processes are with these little receptors

1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:03.640
 for sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,

1:18:03.640 --> 1:18:05.300
 and maybe fat as well.

1:18:05.300 --> 1:18:06.720
 So it's this incredible device

1:18:06.720 --> 1:18:08.000
 that you've been equipped with

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.920
 that you can use to interact with various components

1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:11.960
 of the outside world

1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:15.320
 and decide whether or not you want to bring them in or not.

1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:17.640
 Just as you can lose those olfactory neurons

1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:19.640
 if you happen to get hit on the head

1:18:19.640 --> 1:18:22.040
 or you have some other thing,

1:18:22.040 --> 1:18:23.200
 maybe it was an infection

1:18:23.200 --> 1:18:25.960
 that caused loss of those olfactory sensory neurons,

1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:29.640
 you can also lose taste receptors in your mouth.

1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:33.840
 If you've ever eaten something that's too hot,

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:36.300
 not spicy hot, but too hot,

1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:40.000
 you burn your tongue, you burn receptors.

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:43.520
 It takes about a week to recover those receptors.

1:18:43.520 --> 1:18:45.840
 For some people, it's a little bit more quickly,

1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:47.800
 but if you burn your tongue badly

1:18:47.800 --> 1:18:49.340
 by ingesting a soup that's too hot

1:18:49.340 --> 1:18:50.400
 or a beverage that's too hot,

1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:53.080
 you will greatly reduce your sense of taste

1:18:53.080 --> 1:18:56.680
 for essentially all tastes.

1:18:56.680 --> 1:19:01.280
 And that's because those neurons sit very shallow

1:19:01.280 --> 1:19:02.920
 beneath the tongue's surface

1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:04.240
 and so that if you put something too hot on it,

1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:06.000
 you literally just burn those neurons away.

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:09.380
 Luckily, those neurons also can replenish themselves.

1:19:09.380 --> 1:19:12.760
 Those neurons are of the peripheral nervous system

1:19:12.760 --> 1:19:14.740
 and like all peripheral system neurons,

1:19:14.740 --> 1:19:17.520
 they can replenish or regenerate.

1:19:17.520 --> 1:19:20.080
 So if you burn your mouth in about a week or so,

1:19:20.080 --> 1:19:23.040
 hopefully sooner, you'll be able to taste again.

1:19:23.040 --> 1:19:26.960
 In fact, everybody's ability to taste

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:29.080
 is highly subject to training.

1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:31.400
 You can really enhance your ability to taste

1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:35.160
 and taste the different component parts of different foods

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:38.880
 simply by paying attention to what you're trying to taste.

1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:42.360
 This is an amazing aspect of the taste system.

1:19:42.360 --> 1:19:44.120
 I think more than any other system,

1:19:44.120 --> 1:19:47.160
 the taste system and perhaps the smell system as well

1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:49.840
 can be trained so that you can learn

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:53.300
 to pick out the tones, if you will,

1:19:53.300 --> 1:19:58.300
 of different ice cream or different beverages.

1:19:58.860 --> 1:20:00.780
 Somebody who, I don't drink much alcohol,

1:20:00.780 --> 1:20:02.400
 I occasionally have a drink or something,

1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:05.180
 but a while ago I got to taste

1:20:05.180 --> 1:20:08.360
 a bunch of different white tequilas.

1:20:08.360 --> 1:20:10.320
 These are different kinds of tequilas that are,

1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:11.680
 they're not brown, they're white.

1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:15.920
 And I sort of assumed that all tequila was disgusting.

1:20:15.920 --> 1:20:17.280
 That was my assumption before doing this.

1:20:17.280 --> 1:20:18.720
 And then I tasted a couple of white tequilas

1:20:18.720 --> 1:20:20.500
 and I realized, oh, those aren't too bad.

1:20:20.500 --> 1:20:22.080
 I tasted a few more.

1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:23.600
 And then pretty soon I could really start

1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:25.800
 to detect the nuance and the difference.

1:20:25.800 --> 1:20:28.200
 Now, I haven't had a tequila in a long time now.

1:20:28.200 --> 1:20:30.480
 I sort of tend to not drink it all these days.

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:33.260
 But in a very short period of time, like a couple of days,

1:20:33.260 --> 1:20:35.800
 I got very good at detecting which things I liked

1:20:35.800 --> 1:20:37.660
 and I could start to pick out tones.

1:20:37.660 --> 1:20:40.880
 So I'm not a wine drinker, but for those of you that are,

1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:42.780
 you hear about, oh, it has floral tones

1:20:42.780 --> 1:20:44.960
 or berry tones or chocolate tones.

1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:48.680
 Some of that is just kind of menu based

1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:50.820
 and kind of marketing based silliness

1:20:51.760 --> 1:20:52.940
 designed to get you excited

1:20:52.940 --> 1:20:54.200
 about what you're about to ingest.

1:20:54.200 --> 1:20:55.700
 But some of it is real.

1:20:55.700 --> 1:20:59.280
 And for people that are skilled in assessing wines

1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:03.120
 or assessing foods, much more of an eater than a drinker,

1:21:03.120 --> 1:21:06.000
 you can really start to develop a sensitive palette,

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:09.580
 a nuanced palette through what we call top-down mechanisms.

1:21:09.580 --> 1:21:12.980
 This olfactory cortex that takes these five,

1:21:12.980 --> 1:21:16.160
 maybe the sixth fat receptor two information

1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:18.960
 and tries to make sense of what's out there in the world

1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:21.380
 and what its utility is.

1:21:21.380 --> 1:21:22.360
 Is it good? Is it bad?

1:21:22.360 --> 1:21:24.160
 Do I want more of it or less than it?

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:27.760
 That neural circuitry is unlike other neural circuitry

1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:32.140
 in that it seems very amenable to behavioral plasticity

1:21:32.140 --> 1:21:33.240
 for whatever reason.

1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:35.840
 And we could talk about what those reasons might be.

1:21:35.840 --> 1:21:37.480
 It's interesting sometimes to think about

1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:41.200
 how your taste literally, chemical taste,

1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:43.840
 is probably very different than that of other people.

1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:46.680
 How a food tastes to you is probably very different

1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:47.880
 than how it tastes to somebody else.

1:21:47.880 --> 1:21:49.840
 The same probably cannot be said

1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:51.960
 of something like vision or hearing,

1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:53.920
 unless you're somebody who has perfect pitch

1:21:53.920 --> 1:21:57.940
 or your color vision is disrupted or you're a mantis shrimp.

1:21:57.940 --> 1:22:00.120
 Chances are, when you look at the same object,

1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:03.000
 two people are seeing more or less the same object

1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.360
 or perceiving it in a very similar way.

1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:08.040
 There are experiments that essentially establish that.

1:22:08.040 --> 1:22:10.120
 Now, we have taste receptors

1:22:10.120 --> 1:22:11.400
 and a lot of those taste receptors,

1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:13.120
 their chemical structures are known.

1:22:13.120 --> 1:22:17.920
 They come with fancy names like the T1R1 or the T1R2,

1:22:17.920 --> 1:22:21.920
 which were identified as the sweet and umami receptor.

1:22:21.920 --> 1:22:25.080
 So what's interesting is that this umami flavor

1:22:25.080 --> 1:22:27.560
 is the savory flavor, rather,

1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:30.360
 that's sensed by umami receptors is very close

1:22:30.360 --> 1:22:34.460
 to the receptor that detects sweet things.

1:22:34.460 --> 1:22:37.360
 Similarly, bitter is sensed

1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:39.580
 by a whole other set of receptors.

1:22:39.580 --> 1:22:42.760
 Now, there's a fun naturally occurring experiment

1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:47.000
 that will forever change the way that you look at animals

1:22:47.000 --> 1:22:49.160
 and the way certainly that I think about dogs

1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:50.600
 and Costello in particular.

1:22:51.440 --> 1:22:55.360
 Carnivorous large animals like tigers

1:22:55.360 --> 1:22:58.040
 and some grizzly bears, for instance,

1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:02.040
 we know that they have no ability to detect sweet.

1:23:02.040 --> 1:23:04.320
 They don't actually have the receptors

1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:06.740
 for detecting sweet on their tongue,

1:23:06.740 --> 1:23:09.400
 but their concentration of umami receptors,

1:23:09.400 --> 1:23:12.080
 of their ability to detect savory

1:23:12.080 --> 1:23:16.840
 is at least 5,000 times that which it is in humans.

1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:19.440
 In other words, if I eat a little piece of steak

1:23:20.480 --> 1:23:23.720
 or Costello eats a little piece of steak,

1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:28.720
 that steak probably tastes much, much more savory

1:23:29.040 --> 1:23:31.000
 than it does to me.

1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.040
 So dogs and tigers and bears, et cetera,

1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:38.480
 they're going to taste savory things and smell savory things

1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:41.000
 with a much higher degree of sensitivity,

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:42.600
 but they can't taste sweet things.

1:23:42.600 --> 1:23:45.300
 Other large animals, which are mostly herbivores,

1:23:45.300 --> 1:23:48.240
 like the panda bear, for instance,

1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:50.240
 it's hard to believe that thing is even a bear.

1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:51.480
 I got nothing against pandas.

1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:53.640
 I just think that they get a little bit too much

1:23:53.640 --> 1:23:55.960
 of the limelight, frankly.

1:23:55.960 --> 1:23:58.200
 So no vendetta against panda, save the pandas.

1:23:58.200 --> 1:23:59.440
 I hope they replenish all the pandas,

1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:04.440
 but pandas in all their whatever have no umami receptors.

1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:07.580
 They can't taste savory,

1:24:07.580 --> 1:24:11.720
 but they have greatly heightened density of sweet receptors.

1:24:11.720 --> 1:24:14.720
 So there they are eating these whatever bamboos all day

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:18.520
 or not bamboozle, but bamboos all day.

1:24:18.520 --> 1:24:21.960
 And they can taste things that are very sweet

1:24:21.960 --> 1:24:24.640
 with a much higher degree of intensity.

1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:27.880
 And in general, animals that are more gentle,

1:24:27.880 --> 1:24:32.280
 more that are herbivores, excuse me,

1:24:32.280 --> 1:24:34.980
 or animals that have the propensity for aggression,

1:24:34.980 --> 1:24:36.680
 that's where you really see the divergence

1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:38.020
 of the umami receptor,

1:24:38.020 --> 1:24:40.660
 because it's associated with meat and amino acids,

1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:44.360
 and where you see the enhancement of the sweet receptors

1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:47.080
 for animals that eat a lot of plants and fruits.

1:24:47.080 --> 1:24:49.300
 And they probably taste very different to them

1:24:49.300 --> 1:24:51.000
 than they do to you and me.

1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:54.600
 And so it's interesting to note that animals that eat meat,

1:24:54.600 --> 1:24:57.160
 that eat other organisms,

1:24:57.160 --> 1:25:00.200
 can actually extract more savory experience from that.

1:25:00.200 --> 1:25:01.480
 What does this mean for you?

1:25:01.480 --> 1:25:03.600
 All right, do you associate yourself

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:05.800
 as a tiger or a grizzly bear or a panda

1:25:05.800 --> 1:25:06.840
 or a combination of both?

1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:08.400
 Most people are omnivores.

1:25:08.400 --> 1:25:11.200
 However, you may find it interesting

1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:13.260
 that people that, for instance,

1:25:13.260 --> 1:25:16.960
 eat a pure carnivore type diet or a keto diet

1:25:16.960 --> 1:25:19.280
 where they are ingesting a lot of meats,

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:22.640
 so therefore are sensing a lot of umami flavors.

1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:25.380
 And I realize not everyone who's keto eats meat,

1:25:25.380 --> 1:25:29.240
 but those who do that will develop a more sensitive palette

1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:32.460
 and likely, there are some data, although early data,

1:25:32.460 --> 1:25:35.280
 craving for umami-like foods.

1:25:35.280 --> 1:25:38.920
 Whereas people that eat a more plant-based diet

1:25:38.920 --> 1:25:43.480
 are likely developing a heightened sensitivity

1:25:43.480 --> 1:25:46.460
 and desire for, and maybe even dopamine response

1:25:46.460 --> 1:25:49.080
 to sugars and plant-based foods.

1:25:49.080 --> 1:25:52.160
 Now, this is my partial attempt to reconcile

1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:55.440
 the kind of online battle that seems to exist

1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:58.160
 between plant-based versus animal-based,

1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:02.080
 purely plant-based or purely animal-based diets.

1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:03.840
 I think most people are omnivores,

1:26:03.840 --> 1:26:06.920
 but it's kind of interesting to think that the systems

1:26:06.920 --> 1:26:10.420
 are plastic such that people might want more meat

1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:11.360
 if they eat more meat.

1:26:11.360 --> 1:26:14.120
 People might want more plants if they eat enough plants

1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:15.520
 for a long period of time.

1:26:15.520 --> 1:26:17.780
 And this might explain some of the chasm

1:26:17.780 --> 1:26:19.780
 that exists between these two groups.

1:26:19.780 --> 1:26:23.000
 Now, this is not to say anything about the ethical

1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:24.720
 or the environmental impacts of different things.

1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:25.840
 I don't even want to get into that

1:26:25.840 --> 1:26:28.060
 because the meat people say that the plant-based diets

1:26:28.060 --> 1:26:29.680
 have as much a negative impact

1:26:29.680 --> 1:26:31.600
 as the plant people say that the meat-based diets.

1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:33.100
 That's a totally different discussion.

1:26:33.100 --> 1:26:35.220
 What I'm talking about here is food craving

1:26:35.220 --> 1:26:38.640
 and food seeking, and one's ability to detect

1:26:38.640 --> 1:26:41.400
 these umami savory flavors is going to be enhanced

1:26:41.400 --> 1:26:44.460
 by ingesting more meat and less activation

1:26:44.460 --> 1:26:45.440
 of the sweet receptor.

1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:47.360
 So in other words, the more meat you eat,

1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:50.840
 the more you're going to become like a tiger, so to speak.

1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:54.960
 And the more that you avoid these umami flavors and meats,

1:26:54.960 --> 1:26:57.320
 and the more that you would eat plant-based foods

1:26:57.320 --> 1:26:58.820
 and in particular sweet foods,

1:26:58.820 --> 1:27:02.520
 the more you will likely suppress that umami system

1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:06.480
 and that you will have a heightened desire for,

1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:09.900
 appetite for, and sensing of sweet foods

1:27:09.900 --> 1:27:11.960
 or foods that contain sugars.

1:27:11.960 --> 1:27:15.120
 What I'm about to tell you is going to seem crazy,

1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:17.540
 but is extremely interesting

1:27:17.540 --> 1:27:21.080
 with respect to taste and taste receptors.

1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:24.040
 Remember, even though we can enjoy food

1:27:24.040 --> 1:27:27.460
 and we can evolve our sense of what's tasty or not tasty,

1:27:27.460 --> 1:27:31.000
 depending on life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera,

1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:32.960
 the taste system, just like the olfactory system

1:27:32.960 --> 1:27:36.600
 and the visual system was laid down for the purpose

1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:39.380
 of moving towards things that are good for us

1:27:39.380 --> 1:27:41.380
 and moving away from things that are bad for us.

1:27:41.380 --> 1:27:44.220
 That's the kind of core function of the nervous system.

1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:49.760
 Well, taste receptors are not just expressed on the tongue.

1:27:50.840 --> 1:27:54.160
 They are expressed in other cells and other tissues as well.

1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:57.060
 Some of you may be able to imagine foods

1:27:57.060 --> 1:27:58.440
 that are so delicious to you

1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:01.560
 that they make your entire body feel good.

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:06.400
 Or foods that are so horrifically awful to think about,

1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:10.300
 let alone taste, that they create a whole body shuttering

1:28:10.300 --> 1:28:12.680
 or kind of repellent type response

1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:15.760
 where you just either cringe or turn your face away,

1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:17.640
 even in the absence of that food.

1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:21.720
 That's sort of how I feel about pungent Gorgonzola cheese.

1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:24.600
 If you like Gorgonzola cheese, I don't judge you.

1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:27.560
 I just, that's an individual difference.

1:28:27.560 --> 1:28:29.600
 I happen to love certain foods.

1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:31.600
 I do like savory foods very much.

1:28:33.460 --> 1:28:36.960
 When I think about them, they just, they make me feel good.

1:28:36.960 --> 1:28:39.920
 And I'm oftentimes not even associating

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:41.260
 with the taste of those foods.

1:28:41.260 --> 1:28:43.520
 It feels almost like a visceral thing.

1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:45.720
 Well, it turns out that some of the taste receptors

1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:49.120
 extend beyond the tongue, that they actually can extend

1:28:49.120 --> 1:28:52.040
 into portions of the gut and digestive system.

1:28:52.040 --> 1:28:53.960
 And if that's not strange enough,

1:28:55.460 --> 1:28:57.280
 turns out that some of the taste receptors

1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:01.820
 are actually expressed on the ovaries and the testes.

1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:04.720
 So what that means is that the gonads,

1:29:04.720 --> 1:29:08.120
 the very cells and tissues and organs in our body

1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:10.960
 that make up the reproductive axis

1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:13.040
 are expressing taste receptors.

1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:14.200
 Okay, so how do we interpret this?

1:29:14.200 --> 1:29:15.880
 Does this mean that when you eat something

1:29:15.880 --> 1:29:19.160
 that's very savory or very sweet, for instance,

1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:22.660
 that it's triggering activation of the ovaries

1:29:22.660 --> 1:29:24.420
 or of the testes?

1:29:24.420 --> 1:29:26.980
 Well, it's possible.

1:29:26.980 --> 1:29:30.160
 Now, how those molecules, those chemical molecules

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:31.800
 would actually get there isn't clear.

1:29:31.800 --> 1:29:34.760
 The digestive tract does not run directly

1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:36.820
 to the testes or to the ovaries.

1:29:36.820 --> 1:29:40.040
 But nonetheless, what this means is that chemical sensing

1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:42.160
 of the very things that we detect on our tongue

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:46.680
 and that we call taste in quotes, in food,

1:29:46.680 --> 1:29:50.840
 is also evoking cellular responses

1:29:50.840 --> 1:29:53.560
 within the reproductive gonads.

1:29:53.560 --> 1:29:57.540
 Now, whether or not this underlies the positive association

1:29:57.540 --> 1:30:00.280
 that we have with certain foods isn't clear,

1:30:00.280 --> 1:30:04.600
 but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the obvious,

1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:07.400
 which is that the relationship

1:30:07.400 --> 1:30:11.920
 between the sensual nature of particular foods

1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:16.160
 and sensuality generally and the reproductive axis

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:19.100
 is something that's been covered in many movies.

1:30:19.100 --> 1:30:21.240
 There are entire movies that are focused

1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:23.680
 on the relationship between, for instance,

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:26.940
 chocolate and love and reproductive behaviors,

1:30:26.940 --> 1:30:31.940
 or certain feasts of meat and their wonderful tastes

1:30:33.320 --> 1:30:36.640
 and the kind of sensuality around feasts

1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:38.480
 of different types of foods.

1:30:38.480 --> 1:30:41.760
 But in general, it's the sweet and the savory.

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:46.200
 Rarely is it the sour or the bitter, the salty or the fat.

1:30:46.200 --> 1:30:49.240
 And not surprisingly, perhaps,

1:30:49.240 --> 1:30:51.920
 it is the T2Rs and the T1Rs,

1:30:51.920 --> 1:30:54.720
 the receptors that are associated with the sweet

1:30:54.720 --> 1:30:57.560
 and with the umami, the savory flavors

1:30:57.560 --> 1:30:59.680
 that are expressed not just on the tongue

1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:02.060
 and in portions of the digestive tract,

1:31:02.060 --> 1:31:04.280
 but on the gonads themselves.

1:31:04.280 --> 1:31:05.340
 So what does this mean?

1:31:05.340 --> 1:31:06.960
 Does this mean that eating certain foods

1:31:06.960 --> 1:31:08.720
 can stimulate the gonads?

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:09.560
 Maybe.

1:31:09.560 --> 1:31:12.660
 There's no data that immediately support that right now,

1:31:12.660 --> 1:31:14.640
 but this is an emerging area.

1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:17.080
 If you'd like to read more about this,

1:31:17.080 --> 1:31:20.280
 there's a great review entitled Taste Perception

1:31:20.280 --> 1:31:21.920
 from the Tongue to the Testes,

1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:24.720
 although they do also talk about the ovaries.

1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:26.200
 Why they didn't include that in the title

1:31:26.200 --> 1:31:29.700
 is I think a reflection of the sort of bias of the author.

1:31:29.700 --> 1:31:34.700
 The author, not incidentally, is Fang Li, last name Li.

1:31:36.320 --> 1:31:38.080
 It's a very interesting paper

1:31:38.080 --> 1:31:42.160
 published in Molecular Human Reproduction.

1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:43.560
 You can find it easily online.

1:31:43.560 --> 1:31:44.380
 It's downloadable.

1:31:44.380 --> 1:31:45.960
 I'll also provide a link to it.

1:31:45.960 --> 1:31:47.600
 I just think it's fascinating

1:31:47.600 --> 1:31:50.040
 that these taste receptors are expressed in other tissues.

1:31:50.040 --> 1:31:51.320
 And I should mention that they're expressed

1:31:51.320 --> 1:31:54.480
 in tissues of other areas of the body as well,

1:31:54.480 --> 1:31:56.780
 including the respiratory system,

1:31:56.780 --> 1:32:01.160
 but the richest aggregation or concentration

1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:03.000
 of these receptors for umami and sweet, of course,

1:32:03.000 --> 1:32:05.720
 is on the tongue, but also on the gonads.

1:32:05.720 --> 1:32:09.180
 And I think it does speak to the possible bridge

1:32:09.180 --> 1:32:12.120
 between what we think of as a sensory

1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:14.480
 or a sensual experience of food

1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:18.040
 and the deeper kind of visceral sense within the gut

1:32:18.040 --> 1:32:20.060
 and maybe even within the gonads as well

1:32:20.060 --> 1:32:22.600
 of something that we find extremely pleasurable

1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:26.280
 or even a repetitive that we want to move toward it.

1:32:26.280 --> 1:32:28.840
 We are actually going to return to that general theme

1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:32.200
 in the discussion about touch sensation.

1:32:32.200 --> 1:32:36.420
 Some people, for instance, when they touch certain surfaces

1:32:36.420 --> 1:32:41.420
 like furs or sheepskins or velvet or soft, smooth surfaces,

1:32:41.420 --> 1:32:46.240
 it feels good elsewhere in their body,

1:32:46.240 --> 1:32:49.860
 not just at the point of contact with that surface.

1:32:50.740 --> 1:32:54.800
 And similarly, if there's the, how about this one,

1:32:54.800 --> 1:32:56.800
 the screech of chalk on a chalkboard?

1:32:56.800 --> 1:33:00.720
 It's a sound, but it has a very strong visceral component

1:33:00.720 --> 1:33:04.440
 or sandpaper like fingers, fingernails on a chalkboard,

1:33:04.440 --> 1:33:06.620
 not the sound, but the feeling, right?

1:33:06.620 --> 1:33:07.520
 Exactly.

1:33:07.520 --> 1:33:09.480
 So our whole nervous system is tuned

1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:12.340
 to either be drawn toward, appetitive,

1:33:12.340 --> 1:33:15.800
 or repelled by aversive behaviors, right?

1:33:15.800 --> 1:33:17.760
 So there's this push-pull that exists.

1:33:17.760 --> 1:33:19.920
 And what I'm referring to in terms of these receptors

1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:22.120
 on the tongue that are also expressed on the gonads

1:33:22.120 --> 1:33:24.360
 is yet another example of what, at least in this case,

1:33:24.360 --> 1:33:26.740
 seems to be an appetitive thing,

1:33:26.740 --> 1:33:29.500
 a desire to move toward certain foods

1:33:29.500 --> 1:33:30.820
 and maybe even the experiences

1:33:30.820 --> 1:33:32.400
 that are associated with those foods.

1:33:32.400 --> 1:33:35.040
 I want to talk about a particular aspect of food

1:33:35.040 --> 1:33:37.680
 and a chemical reaction in cooking

1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:39.300
 called the Maillard reaction.

1:33:39.300 --> 1:33:41.560
 Some of you have probably heard of the Maillard reaction.

1:33:41.560 --> 1:33:45.520
 It's spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.

1:33:45.520 --> 1:33:48.720
 The D is silent, so don't call it the Maillard reaction.

1:33:48.720 --> 1:33:51.040
 And it's not the Maillard reaction.

1:33:51.040 --> 1:33:52.680
 It is the Maillard reaction.

1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:54.980
 And the Maillard reaction is a reaction

1:33:54.980 --> 1:33:58.520
 that for the aficionados is a non-enzymatic browning.

1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:01.720
 The other form of non-enzymatic browning is caramelization.

1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:03.840
 Although when you hear caramel, caramel,

1:34:04.760 --> 1:34:06.800
 I think it's caramel, you think sweet.

1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:09.560
 And indeed caramelization

1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:12.280
 is a sugar, sugar chemical interaction

1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:15.620
 that leads to a kind of nicely toasted,

1:34:15.620 --> 1:34:18.640
 not burnt, but nicely toasted sweet taste.

1:34:18.640 --> 1:34:20.120
 Whereas the Maillard reaction

1:34:20.120 --> 1:34:22.480
 is that really savory reaction

1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:25.380
 that occurs when you have a sugar amino acid reaction.

1:34:25.380 --> 1:34:26.980
 Remember we have neurons in our gut,

1:34:26.980 --> 1:34:29.320
 but also neurons in our tongue

1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:31.040
 and neurons deep in the brain

1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:36.040
 that are comparing the amount of sugar to savory, okay?

1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:38.520
 And the Maillard reaction is very interesting.

1:34:38.520 --> 1:34:39.960
 For you chemists out there,

1:34:39.960 --> 1:34:41.420
 this is going to be way too elementary.

1:34:41.420 --> 1:34:42.360
 And for you non-chemists,

1:34:42.360 --> 1:34:43.960
 it's probably going to be a little bit of a reach,

1:34:43.960 --> 1:34:45.520
 but just bear with me.

1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:47.280
 All these chemicals that we sense

1:34:47.280 --> 1:34:48.400
 have a different structure.

1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:50.780
 It's like hydrogens and oxygens and aldehyde groups

1:34:50.780 --> 1:34:51.620
 and all these things.

1:34:51.620 --> 1:34:53.220
 And basically the Maillard reaction

1:34:53.220 --> 1:34:55.040
 involves what's called a free aldehyde.

1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:57.560
 If you didn't like chemistry, don't worry about it.

1:34:57.560 --> 1:35:01.060
 It's basically got a group there that kind of sits open

1:35:01.060 --> 1:35:03.240
 that allows it to interact with other things.

1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:05.720
 And actually through the use of heat

1:35:05.720 --> 1:35:08.640
 and the process that we call brazing,

1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:10.200
 which I'll talk about in a moment,

1:35:10.200 --> 1:35:13.080
 you create what's called a ketone group.

1:35:13.080 --> 1:35:14.700
 Now, most people now have heard of ketones

1:35:14.700 --> 1:35:16.640
 because they think about the ketogenic diet,

1:35:16.640 --> 1:35:20.600
 but a ketone group is actually a chemical compound

1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:21.880
 that can be used for energy.

1:35:21.880 --> 1:35:24.420
 And that's why people say you can use ketones for energy.

1:35:24.420 --> 1:35:28.120
 But if you've ever actually encountered ketones,

1:35:28.120 --> 1:35:31.840
 if you, for instance, get liquid ketones, a ketone ester,

1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:34.080
 and you smell it, what does it smell like?

1:35:34.080 --> 1:35:36.520
 It smells a little bit like an alcohol,

1:35:36.520 --> 1:35:39.920
 but it has a kind of savory taste,

1:35:39.920 --> 1:35:42.080
 even when you smell it, okay?

1:35:42.080 --> 1:35:44.160
 There are other smells that have these tastes too.

1:35:44.160 --> 1:35:46.200
 But for the Maillard reaction,

1:35:46.200 --> 1:35:47.880
 which could be created, for instance,

1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:49.240
 like if you took a piece of meat

1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:50.400
 or if you're not a meat eater,

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:53.040
 if you took tomatoes and you cooked them in a pan

1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:54.920
 and you cooked it nice and slow till it simmered

1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:57.200
 and almost started to brown and burn a little bit.

1:35:57.200 --> 1:35:58.400
 Usually if I do it, it burns.

1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:02.000
 I'm not a good cook, as Costello points out a lot.

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:05.260
 But it gets that like almost tangy,

1:36:05.260 --> 1:36:07.760
 very umami-like flavor.

1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:10.000
 And sometimes it will even stick to the pan

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:11.380
 if you scrape it off.

1:36:11.380 --> 1:36:13.400
 It actually, you can taste it in your mouth

1:36:13.400 --> 1:36:14.600
 as you're cooking it.

1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:15.880
 That's the Maillard reaction.

1:36:15.880 --> 1:36:17.200
 That's that free aldehyde group.

1:36:17.200 --> 1:36:20.100
 And that's the production of a ketone group.

1:36:21.000 --> 1:36:25.560
 When you smell ketones, it smells very much like that, okay?

1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:27.200
 Some people talk about the ketones

1:36:27.200 --> 1:36:28.720
 will produce like fruity breath.

1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:31.080
 And that's true if people are really far into ketosis.

1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:32.560
 Their breath has a kind of fruity odor.

1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:34.300
 That's a little bit of a different thing.

1:36:34.300 --> 1:36:36.900
 So the relationship between smell and taste

1:36:36.900 --> 1:36:39.400
 is a very, very close one.

1:36:39.400 --> 1:36:40.920
 And this is why when people drink wine,

1:36:40.920 --> 1:36:43.440
 they often will inhale and then sip.

1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:44.800
 Some of that is just kind of like

1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:46.640
 pomp and circumstance, frankly.

1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:48.320
 They make a big deal of it.

1:36:48.320 --> 1:36:51.060
 But they can sense things with their mouth.

1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:56.260
 The combination of odor receptors being activated

1:36:56.260 --> 1:36:58.640
 in a particular way and taste receptors in the mouth

1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:00.480
 being activated in a particular way

1:37:00.480 --> 1:37:03.100
 triggers the activation of multiple brain areas

1:37:03.100 --> 1:37:04.560
 that are associated with taste

1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:06.780
 and circuitry within the body

1:37:06.780 --> 1:37:09.120
 that's associated with the behaviors

1:37:09.120 --> 1:37:11.960
 that relate to that taste, like leaning toward it

1:37:11.960 --> 1:37:13.080
 or leaning away from it,

1:37:13.080 --> 1:37:15.920
 depending on whether or not it's a pettative or aversive.

1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:18.840
 So the Maillard reaction is a very interesting reaction

1:37:18.840 --> 1:37:21.860
 involving this sugar amino acid thing.

1:37:21.860 --> 1:37:25.120
 But really what it's doing is heating up food

1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:29.860
 such that the amino acids are more available,

1:37:29.860 --> 1:37:31.320
 literally in their chemical form

1:37:31.320 --> 1:37:33.360
 for detection by the neurons.

1:37:33.360 --> 1:37:35.600
 This is a phenomenon that occurs in other domains

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:37.840
 of the taste system.

1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:40.400
 For instance, a lot of what's happened

1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:42.880
 with highly processed foods

1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:45.680
 is that manufacturers have figured out

1:37:45.680 --> 1:37:48.340
 how to trigger more dopamine response

1:37:48.340 --> 1:37:50.320
 by ingestion of these sugary foods

1:37:50.320 --> 1:37:52.360
 and created textures

1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:55.720
 and created essentially design of foods for two purposes.

1:37:55.720 --> 1:37:58.920
 I'm not out to completely demonize processed foods.

1:37:58.920 --> 1:38:00.720
 I did that in a previous episode,

1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:03.480
 but processed foods are really designed

1:38:03.480 --> 1:38:05.760
 to take foods that ordinarily would spoil,

1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:07.680
 that would have a shelf life and extend their shelf life

1:38:07.680 --> 1:38:10.680
 to turn foods, which are not a commodity into a commodity.

1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:12.600
 Something could be stored and used essentially

1:38:12.600 --> 1:38:17.600
 as a tradable, purchasable, sellable resource.

1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:22.560
 In doing that, they've also decided to change the texture

1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:24.720
 so that you want to chew more of them.

1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:25.680
 Like I have this thing,

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:28.880
 I don't know what it is for those Triscuit crackers.

1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:30.120
 I don't know, why are those things so good?

1:38:30.120 --> 1:38:32.300
 It's probably the texture, those layers,

1:38:32.300 --> 1:38:33.780
 they're just kind of perfectly salty.

1:38:33.780 --> 1:38:34.800
 Haven't had one in a long time,

1:38:34.800 --> 1:38:35.920
 so I bet if I had one now,

1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:38.000
 it wouldn't taste as good as I'm imagining it.

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:42.560
 But those combinations of texture, smell, and taste

1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.800
 are what combine to activate these different brain areas

1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:47.440
 that make you really want to desire something.

1:38:47.440 --> 1:38:50.860
 And the people who make foods, processed foods in particular,

1:38:50.860 --> 1:38:53.600
 are phenomenally good at figuring out

1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:55.160
 what drives the dopamine system

1:38:55.160 --> 1:38:56.560
 and makes you want more of these things,

1:38:56.560 --> 1:38:58.720
 either because of the way they taste

1:38:58.720 --> 1:39:01.060
 and or because of the way they trigger neurons in your gut

1:39:01.060 --> 1:39:02.440
 that have nothing to do with taste

1:39:02.440 --> 1:39:04.600
 that simply make you desire more of the food.

1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:08.400
 In other words, many of the foods that are processed foods

1:39:08.400 --> 1:39:10.340
 make you desire more of them,

1:39:10.340 --> 1:39:13.260
 it's impossible to eat one chip kind of thing,

1:39:13.260 --> 1:39:16.360
 not because they taste good, but because in your gut,

1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:18.660
 they're activating the neurons that activate dopamine,

1:39:18.660 --> 1:39:20.880
 which make you seek more of those foods,

1:39:20.880 --> 1:39:23.820
 independent of blood sugar or anything else.

1:39:23.820 --> 1:39:26.680
 So you may actually be eating more particular foods,

1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:28.600
 not because they taste good,

1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:32.800
 but because they feel good on your tongue and mouth,

1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:34.780
 and because the neurons in your gut,

1:39:34.780 --> 1:39:37.160
 which are totally independent of conscious taste,

1:39:37.160 --> 1:39:38.700
 are triggering the release of dopamine,

1:39:38.700 --> 1:39:41.320
 which is a molecule that makes you seek more of

1:39:41.320 --> 1:39:43.120
 and do more of anything that led

1:39:43.120 --> 1:39:44.960
 to the ingestion of that food.

1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:47.300
 There's a fun experiment that you can do,

1:39:47.300 --> 1:39:52.300
 which is to completely invert your sense of sweet and sour.

1:39:53.140 --> 1:39:54.960
 There's actually a way to do this readily.

1:39:54.960 --> 1:39:56.800
 When I was a postdoc,

1:39:56.800 --> 1:39:58.980
 I used to have a journal club at my house,

1:39:58.980 --> 1:40:01.840
 people would come over in the evening once a month,

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:03.160
 and we would read a paper,

1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:05.120
 typically the weirdest paper we could find,

1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:08.440
 and we would eat food and hang out,

1:40:08.440 --> 1:40:11.680
 as the nerds did and do for fun.

1:40:11.680 --> 1:40:12.880
 So that's what we did.

1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:17.480
 And one time someone brought what's called miracle berry.

1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:20.000
 Okay, so this isn't some psychedelic plant medicine thing.

1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.400
 Miracle berry you can purchase online,

1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:24.460
 it's relatively inexpensive.

1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:28.120
 It actually causes a change in the configuration

1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:32.320
 of taste receptors, such that when you eat something sour,

1:40:32.320 --> 1:40:33.600
 it tastes sweet.

1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:37.240
 And so what's really wild is you ingest miracle berry,

1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:40.760
 and then you bite into a lemon, maybe even the lemon peel,

1:40:40.760 --> 1:40:43.160
 and it tastes as sweet as a peach.

1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:45.500
 And this effect lasts several hours.

1:40:46.720 --> 1:40:48.440
 Definitely check any warnings,

1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:51.120
 I don't know what sort of warnings the miracle berry carries,

1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:54.640
 but I'm sure there's always something you can imagine.

1:40:54.640 --> 1:40:56.640
 There are a number of papers on miracle berry,

1:40:56.640 --> 1:40:59.320
 or miracle fruit it's called,

1:40:59.320 --> 1:41:02.320
 but it changes your perception of sour

1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:04.480
 at a perceptual level,

1:41:04.480 --> 1:41:07.800
 but it does that by changing the activity of the receptors

1:41:07.800 --> 1:41:09.560
 in the mouth and tongue.

1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:11.440
 Now, this is important as a principle,

1:41:11.440 --> 1:41:13.840
 and it's underscored by experiments that have been done

1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:15.480
 by, for instance, Charles Zucker's lab

1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:16.880
 at Columbia University,

1:41:16.880 --> 1:41:20.160
 where they've essentially genetically engineered animals

1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:23.280
 such that the bitter receptor is swapped

1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:24.400
 with the sweet receptor,

1:41:24.400 --> 1:41:26.680
 or the sweet receptor is swapped with the bitter receptor.

1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:30.000
 And what they show is that the actual food,

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.360
 the experience on the tongue,

1:41:32.360 --> 1:41:34.980
 drives different pathways in the brain.

1:41:34.980 --> 1:41:35.820
 Here's what they did.

1:41:35.820 --> 1:41:39.320
 They essentially took mice and swapped out the sweet receptor

1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:40.620
 and put in a bitter receptor.

1:41:40.620 --> 1:41:42.040
 And then what they found is that,

1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:45.580
 whereas normally mice would actively seek out

1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:48.220
 and even work for sugar water, sucrose,

1:41:48.220 --> 1:41:49.500
 they really liked that,

1:41:49.500 --> 1:41:52.280
 if they replace the sweet receptor with the bitter receptor,

1:41:52.280 --> 1:41:53.760
 the mice would avoid sugar water.

1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:55.120
 And the reverse was also true,

1:41:55.120 --> 1:41:58.200
 that mice would drink a bitter solution avidly,

1:41:58.200 --> 1:41:59.560
 they liked a bitter solution,

1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:03.020
 if they swapped out the bitter receptor for sweet receptor.

1:42:03.020 --> 1:42:04.980
 What this means is that our entire experience

1:42:04.980 --> 1:42:08.200
 of what we taste is dependent on how we experience

1:42:08.200 --> 1:42:09.440
 that taste at the level of the tongue.

1:42:09.440 --> 1:42:12.580
 And so you're hopefully not going to do genetic engineering

1:42:12.580 --> 1:42:13.800
 of your taste receptors,

1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:16.140
 but if you'd like to do this sort of experiment,

1:42:16.140 --> 1:42:18.760
 you actually can do it very easily using miracle fruit,

1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:21.680
 the instructions of how much to ingest, et cetera.

1:42:21.680 --> 1:42:23.980
 Any safety concerns are usually on the package

1:42:23.980 --> 1:42:26.120
 and should be easy to find.

1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:28.240
 And there's a lot of science to support how this works.

1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:31.280
 It's kind of a fun experiment that anyone can do

1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:33.240
 and will completely change your perception

1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:35.460
 of any food that you're accustomed to eating.

1:42:35.460 --> 1:42:38.760
 In fact, you can figure out how much sweet

1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:41.720
 or the sense of sweetness is contributing

1:42:41.720 --> 1:42:43.000
 to your experience of a food,

1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:44.960
 even if you don't think of that as a sweet food

1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:47.240
 through this miracle fruit experiment.

1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:48.280
 You could take miracle fruit,

1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:51.200
 you could eat a slice of pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza,

1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:54.760
 which perhaps normally to you would taste just like pizza.

1:42:54.760 --> 1:42:56.960
 And you'll notice it tastes very different.

1:42:56.960 --> 1:43:01.240
 What you are detecting is how much the sense of sweet

1:43:01.240 --> 1:43:04.560
 was contributing to that particular flavor.

1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:07.840
 Now I'd like to return to pheromones.

1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:09.080
 So I mentioned earlier,

1:43:09.080 --> 1:43:12.580
 true pheromonal effects are well-established in animals.

1:43:12.580 --> 1:43:15.080
 And one of the most remarkable pheromone effects

1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:16.400
 that's ever been described is one

1:43:16.400 --> 1:43:18.280
 that actually I've mentioned before on this podcast,

1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:20.040
 but I'll mention again just briefly,

1:43:20.040 --> 1:43:21.600
 which is the Coolidge effect.

1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:23.560
 The Coolidge effect is the effect

1:43:23.560 --> 1:43:26.880
 of a male of a given species.

1:43:26.880 --> 1:43:31.880
 In most cases, it tended to be a rodent or a rooster mating,

1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:35.920
 and at some point reaching exhaustion

1:43:35.920 --> 1:43:37.960
 or the inability to mate again

1:43:37.960 --> 1:43:41.320
 because they just simply couldn't for whatever reason.

1:43:41.320 --> 1:43:45.960
 The Coolidge effect establishes that if you swap out

1:43:45.960 --> 1:43:49.300
 the hen with a new hen or the female rat or mouse

1:43:49.300 --> 1:43:53.800
 with a new one, then the rat or the rooster

1:43:53.800 --> 1:43:56.360
 spontaneously regains their ability to mate.

1:43:56.360 --> 1:43:58.480
 Somehow their vigor is returned,

1:43:58.480 --> 1:44:02.100
 the refractory period after mating that normally occurs

1:44:02.100 --> 1:44:05.560
 is abolished and they can mate again.

1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:06.920
 Turns out that the Coolidge effect

1:44:06.920 --> 1:44:09.000
 runs in the opposite direction too.

1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:11.560
 I did not know this, but I recently learned of a study.

1:44:11.560 --> 1:44:14.280
 It was actually done in hamsters, not in mice,

1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:17.560
 but it turns out that females also will,

1:44:17.560 --> 1:44:19.960
 female rodents will mate to exhaustion.

1:44:19.960 --> 1:44:22.200
 And at some point, excuse me,

1:44:22.200 --> 1:44:24.080
 they will refuse to mate any longer

1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:26.200
 unless you swap in a new male.

1:44:26.200 --> 1:44:28.560
 And then because mating in rodents

1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:30.280
 involves the female being receptive,

1:44:30.280 --> 1:44:31.860
 there are a certain number of behaviors

1:44:31.860 --> 1:44:34.860
 that mean that she, that tell you that she's willing

1:44:34.860 --> 1:44:38.600
 and wanting to mate, so-called lordosis reflex.

1:44:39.940 --> 1:44:42.140
 Then if there's a new male,

1:44:42.140 --> 1:44:46.280
 she will spontaneously regain the lordosis reflex

1:44:46.280 --> 1:44:47.320
 and the desire to mate.

1:44:47.320 --> 1:44:49.520
 And how do you know this?

1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:51.340
 How do we know it's a pheromonal effect?

1:44:51.340 --> 1:44:54.960
 Well, this recovery of the desire and ability to mate,

1:44:54.960 --> 1:44:58.240
 both in males and in females,

1:44:58.240 --> 1:45:01.560
 can be evoked completely by the odor

1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:03.560
 of a new male or female.

1:45:03.560 --> 1:45:05.000
 It doesn't even have to be the presentation

1:45:05.000 --> 1:45:06.160
 of the actual animal.

1:45:06.160 --> 1:45:08.460
 And that's how you know that it's not some visual interaction

1:45:08.460 --> 1:45:12.000
 or some other interaction, it's a pheromonal interaction.

1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:14.720
 Now, as I mentioned earlier, pheromonal effects,

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:17.600
 humans have been debated for a long period of time.

1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:19.720
 We are thought to have a vestigial,

1:45:19.720 --> 1:45:22.920
 meaning a kind of shrunken down

1:45:22.920 --> 1:45:25.800
 miniature accessory olfactory bulb

1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:29.560
 called Jacobson's organ or the vomeronasal organ.

1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:31.760
 Some people don't believe that Jacobson's organ exists.

1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:33.220
 Some people do.

1:45:33.220 --> 1:45:37.000
 There is anatomical evidence for it in some cadavers.

1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:41.040
 It sits not very high up in the brain

1:45:41.040 --> 1:45:42.800
 or where your olfactory bulb is,

1:45:42.800 --> 1:45:45.400
 but it's actually in the nasal passages.

1:45:45.400 --> 1:45:46.680
 So there's like little dents

1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:48.440
 as you go up through your nasal passages.

1:45:48.440 --> 1:45:52.720
 And there is evidence of something that's vomeronasal-like.

1:45:52.720 --> 1:45:54.560
 Vomeronasal is the pheromonal organ.

1:45:54.560 --> 1:45:57.220
 They call it Jacobson's organ if it's present in humans,

1:45:57.220 --> 1:46:01.740
 kind of tucked into some of the divots in the nasal passage.

1:46:01.740 --> 1:46:06.680
 Even if that organ, Jacobson's organ, isn't there

1:46:06.680 --> 1:46:09.420
 or is not responsible for the chemical signaling

1:46:09.420 --> 1:46:12.200
 between individuals, there is chemical signaling

1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:13.360
 between human beings.

1:46:13.360 --> 1:46:16.720
 As I mentioned earlier, the effect of tears

1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:19.120
 in suppressing the areas of the brain

1:46:19.120 --> 1:46:23.720
 that are involved in sexual desire and testosterone of males.

1:46:23.720 --> 1:46:25.620
 That's a concrete result.

1:46:25.620 --> 1:46:28.520
 It's a very good result published by an excellent group

1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:30.240
 with no preexisting bias going in.

1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:32.160
 That's just what they found.

1:46:32.160 --> 1:46:37.160
 There is also evidence both for and against

1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:40.440
 chemical signaling between females

1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:42.960
 in terms of synchronization of menstrual cycles.

1:46:42.960 --> 1:46:46.820
 Now, the original paper on this was published in the 1970s

1:46:46.820 --> 1:46:48.600
 by McClintock.

1:46:48.600 --> 1:46:53.020
 And it essentially said that when women live together

1:46:53.020 --> 1:46:55.220
 in group housing dormitories and similar,

1:46:55.220 --> 1:46:57.040
 that their menstrual cycles were synchronized

1:46:57.040 --> 1:46:58.880
 and that was due to what was hypothesized

1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:00.600
 to be pheromonal effects.

1:47:00.600 --> 1:47:02.860
 Over the years, that study has been challenged

1:47:02.860 --> 1:47:04.840
 many, many times.

1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:07.760
 The more recent data points to the idea

1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:11.000
 that there is chemical signaling between women

1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:14.400
 in ways that impact the timing of the menstrual cycle,

1:47:14.400 --> 1:47:17.960
 but that depending on whether or not some of the women

1:47:17.960 --> 1:47:19.980
 are in the ovulation phase,

1:47:19.980 --> 1:47:21.560
 the ovulatory phase of that cycle,

1:47:21.560 --> 1:47:23.440
 or whether or not they are in the follicular phase,

1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:26.080
 the phase when the follicle is maturing

1:47:26.080 --> 1:47:30.420
 before the egg actually ovulates.

1:47:30.420 --> 1:47:35.420
 So two separate phases of the 28 day menstrual cycle

1:47:35.560 --> 1:47:39.900
 will either lengthen or shorten the menstrual cycle

1:47:39.900 --> 1:47:42.000
 of the person that smells those women.

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.140
 Translated into English, what that means is that

1:47:44.140 --> 1:47:47.000
 it is very likely it seems that something,

1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.320
 maybe pheromones, but maybe some other chemical

1:47:49.320 --> 1:47:51.200
 that is independent of pheromones

1:47:51.200 --> 1:47:55.840
 is being conveyed between women that are housed together

1:47:55.840 --> 1:47:57.480
 or spend a lot of time together

1:47:57.480 --> 1:47:58.960
 to shift their menstrual cycle,

1:47:58.960 --> 1:48:02.120
 but it doesn't necessarily mean that they synchronize.

1:48:02.120 --> 1:48:04.960
 So for instance, if one woman is in the follicular phase

1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:07.880
 of the menstrual cycle,

1:48:07.880 --> 1:48:12.040
 it might shorten or delay ovulation, excuse me,

1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:14.820
 it might accelerate ovulation in another woman.

1:48:14.820 --> 1:48:17.000
 Whereas if somebody is in the ovulatory phase

1:48:17.000 --> 1:48:21.320
 of their cycle, it might lengthen the menstrual cycle out

1:48:21.320 --> 1:48:25.680
 so that the woman who smells that person's scent

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:27.360
 or who smells her sweat,

1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:29.060
 we still don't know the origin of the chemical,

1:48:29.060 --> 1:48:30.560
 would ovulate later.

1:48:30.560 --> 1:48:33.400
 So all of this is to say is that chemical chemical signaling

1:48:33.400 --> 1:48:35.580
 is happening from females to males through tears.

1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:36.560
 We know that.

1:48:36.560 --> 1:48:38.000
 Is that a pheromonal effect?

1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.100
 Well, by the strict definition of a pheromone,

1:48:40.100 --> 1:48:42.140
 a molecule that's released from one individual

1:48:42.140 --> 1:48:44.920
 that impacts the biology of another individual, yes.

1:48:44.920 --> 1:48:48.380
 But in terms of identifying what the pheromone is in tears,

1:48:48.380 --> 1:48:49.680
 that's still unknown.

1:48:49.680 --> 1:48:52.120
 It's not clear what the chemical compound is.

1:48:52.120 --> 1:48:53.960
 So we're reluctant as scientists

1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:55.560
 to call it a true pheromonal effect.

1:48:55.560 --> 1:48:57.920
 The menstrual cycle and the synchronization

1:48:57.920 --> 1:49:00.120
 of the menstrual cycle effect seems to hold up

1:49:00.120 --> 1:49:02.120
 under some conditions, but in some cases,

1:49:02.120 --> 1:49:04.520
 there's a kind of clash of menstrual cycles

1:49:04.520 --> 1:49:09.100
 that's created by chemicals that are emitted

1:49:09.100 --> 1:49:11.640
 from one female to another.

1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:14.440
 So there are many examples of this in humans.

1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:18.120
 For instance, people can recognize

1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:22.040
 the T-shirt of their mate.

1:49:22.040 --> 1:49:24.380
 If you give, this experiment has been done many times,

1:49:24.380 --> 1:49:25.760
 I know it's been challenged a number of times,

1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:29.560
 but the data are pretty good by now that if you offer,

1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:31.300
 you take a collection of women

1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:35.100
 who are in stable relationships with somebody,

1:49:35.100 --> 1:49:37.680
 you offer them the smell of 100 different shirts

1:49:37.680 --> 1:49:39.360
 and they can very readily pick out

1:49:39.360 --> 1:49:41.300
 their significant other's scent.

1:49:41.300 --> 1:49:42.480
 Okay, that's pure olfaction.

1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:43.980
 That's not pheromonal,

1:49:43.980 --> 1:49:47.320
 but nonetheless is a remarkable degree of discrimination,

1:49:47.320 --> 1:49:49.360
 olfactory discrimination.

1:49:49.360 --> 1:49:53.120
 You can dilute their partner's scent

1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:55.240
 down to the point where they themselves

1:49:55.240 --> 1:49:57.160
 can't consciously detect the difference

1:49:57.160 --> 1:49:59.220
 between the sweat or the T-shirt

1:49:59.220 --> 1:50:01.200
 of 100 different T-shirts or so.

1:50:01.200 --> 1:50:02.960
 And they might say, I don't really smell the difference,

1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:04.640
 but I think it's this one.

1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:07.480
 Yeah, this one belongs to the person that I've been with.

1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:09.120
 And they are much greater than chance

1:50:09.120 --> 1:50:12.920
 at detecting the T-shirt or identifying the T-shirt correctly.

1:50:12.920 --> 1:50:14.480
 So there's no question really

1:50:14.480 --> 1:50:17.820
 that there is chemical chemical signaling between humans.

1:50:17.820 --> 1:50:19.000
 The question is whether or not

1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.200
 it's truly pheromonal in basis.

1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:23.480
 Now you'll notice that a lot of the examples I gave,

1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:25.280
 aside from the one of tears,

1:50:25.280 --> 1:50:30.280
 is women detecting the sense of men or of other women.

1:50:31.160 --> 1:50:33.680
 And it turns out that there are a number of papers.

1:50:34.780 --> 1:50:37.100
 The best one I think that I could find

1:50:37.100 --> 1:50:39.800
 is published in Physiology and Behavior in 2009.

1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:41.320
 It's a review entitled,

1:50:41.320 --> 1:50:43.780
 Sex Differences and Reproductive Hormone Influences

1:50:43.780 --> 1:50:48.600
 on Human Odor Perception by Dottie, D-O-T-Y and Cameron.

1:50:48.600 --> 1:50:50.040
 I encourage you to check out this review.

1:50:50.040 --> 1:50:51.600
 It's available free as a download.

1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:53.120
 We'll provide a link to it.

1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:55.080
 You can get the full PDF if you want.

1:50:55.080 --> 1:51:00.080
 But it does seem that women are better at detecting odors

1:51:01.420 --> 1:51:03.820
 in these odor discrimination tasks than are men.

1:51:03.820 --> 1:51:05.340
 And yes, that it does vary

1:51:05.340 --> 1:51:08.720
 according to where they are in their menstrual cycle.

1:51:08.720 --> 1:51:10.840
 And yes, they also looked at people

1:51:10.840 --> 1:51:12.280
 who had received gonadectomy,

1:51:12.280 --> 1:51:13.720
 they had their ovaries removed,

1:51:13.720 --> 1:51:16.180
 a number of different important controls.

1:51:16.180 --> 1:51:17.920
 None of this surprises me.

1:51:17.920 --> 1:51:19.440
 None of this should surprise you.

1:51:19.440 --> 1:51:22.220
 It's very clear that hormones have a profound effect

1:51:22.220 --> 1:51:24.720
 on a large number of systems in our biology

1:51:24.720 --> 1:51:26.680
 and that smell and taste

1:51:26.680 --> 1:51:29.600
 and the ability to sense the chemical states of others,

1:51:29.600 --> 1:51:31.200
 either consciously or subconsciously,

1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:33.280
 have a profound influence on whether or not

1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:34.500
 we might want to spend time with them,

1:51:34.500 --> 1:51:36.860
 whether or not this is somebody that we're pair bonded with,

1:51:36.860 --> 1:51:39.480
 whether or not this is somebody that we just met

1:51:39.480 --> 1:51:42.420
 and don't trust yet, things of this sort.

1:51:42.420 --> 1:51:46.200
 And given what's at stake in terms of reproductive biology,

1:51:46.200 --> 1:51:47.480
 not just offspring,

1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:50.960
 but given the possibility of transmission of diseases,

1:51:50.960 --> 1:51:55.740
 et cetera, the risks of childbirth, et cetera,

1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:00.480
 it makes so much sense that much of our biology

1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:02.860
 is wired toward detecting and sensing

1:52:02.860 --> 1:52:04.920
 whether or not things and people

1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:07.160
 are things that we should approach or avoid.

1:52:07.160 --> 1:52:10.320
 Whether or not reproduction with that person

1:52:10.320 --> 1:52:11.480
 is the appropriate response

1:52:11.480 --> 1:52:13.720
 or suppression of the reproductive response

1:52:13.720 --> 1:52:15.400
 is the appropriate response, right?

1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:17.420
 As in this case with the tears.

1:52:17.420 --> 1:52:19.980
 So I think these are fascinating studies.

1:52:19.980 --> 1:52:22.920
 It's an area that still needs a lot of work,

1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:25.600
 but there are some really wonderful papers on this.

1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:27.200
 And the one that I mentioned a few minutes ago,

1:52:27.200 --> 1:52:29.260
 sex differences and reproductive hormone influences

1:52:29.260 --> 1:52:30.900
 on human odor perception

1:52:30.900 --> 1:52:34.680
 is one of the better reviews that are out there.

1:52:34.680 --> 1:52:37.520
 There are also a number of other reviews, for instance,

1:52:37.520 --> 1:52:39.500
 that talk about pheromone effects

1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:43.040
 and their impact on mood and sexual responses

1:52:43.040 --> 1:52:43.880
 and things of that sort.

1:52:43.880 --> 1:52:45.480
 And we will also provide some links to those.

1:52:45.480 --> 1:52:46.940
 A lot of this is still speculative,

1:52:46.940 --> 1:52:48.720
 but I want to say, I know I said it three times,

1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:50.180
 but I really want to underscore

1:52:50.180 --> 1:52:51.520
 because it is vitally important

1:52:51.520 --> 1:52:52.940
 and people seem to get a little triggered

1:52:52.940 --> 1:52:54.440
 by the notion of pheromones.

1:52:56.140 --> 1:52:58.800
 Just because we haven't identified

1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:00.880
 the actual chemical compound

1:53:00.880 --> 1:53:05.200
 that's acting as a pheromone or putative pheromone

1:53:05.200 --> 1:53:07.520
 does not mean that chemical chemical signaling

1:53:07.520 --> 1:53:09.240
 between individuals doesn't exist.

1:53:09.240 --> 1:53:10.860
 Clearly it does.

1:53:10.860 --> 1:53:13.760
 Actually, you and every other human

1:53:13.760 --> 1:53:15.840
 from the time you're born until the time you die

1:53:15.840 --> 1:53:18.800
 are actively seeking out

1:53:18.800 --> 1:53:22.120
 and sensing and evaluating

1:53:22.120 --> 1:53:25.000
 the chemicals that come from other individuals.

1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.040
 There's a really nice study

1:53:26.040 --> 1:53:29.720
 that was done by the Weizmann Institute, a group there.

1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:31.240
 I think it was also Noam Sobel's group,

1:53:31.240 --> 1:53:33.240
 but another group as well, as I recall,

1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:35.480
 looking at human-human interactions

1:53:35.480 --> 1:53:37.480
 when they meet for the first time.

1:53:37.480 --> 1:53:39.480
 It's a remarkable study

1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:41.840
 because what they found was

1:53:41.840 --> 1:53:44.360
 people would reach out and shake hands.

1:53:44.360 --> 1:53:45.880
 This is a typical response.

1:53:45.880 --> 1:53:48.100
 Pre-pandemic, people would meet,

1:53:48.100 --> 1:53:50.200
 they'd reach out and they would shake hands.

1:53:50.200 --> 1:53:54.280
 And what they observed was almost every time

1:53:54.280 --> 1:53:58.040
 within just a few seconds of having shaken hands

1:53:58.040 --> 1:54:00.840
 with this new individual, people will touch their eyes.

1:54:01.740 --> 1:54:03.040
 Almost without fail.

1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:04.600
 Occasionally they would touch their eyebrow.

1:54:04.600 --> 1:54:06.360
 Occasionally someone would touch their hair.

1:54:06.360 --> 1:54:09.760
 We always associate that with people having some sort of

1:54:09.760 --> 1:54:12.280
 or us having some sort of self-conscious response,

1:54:12.280 --> 1:54:14.240
 like, oh, we want to make sure we're

1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:16.540
 tucked in and all prim and proper, whatever it is,

1:54:16.540 --> 1:54:18.380
 or looking right, is there something in my teeth,

1:54:18.380 --> 1:54:19.400
 this kind of thing.

1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:21.240
 But actually people are doing that

1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:24.600
 even if the person they just met left the room.

1:54:24.600 --> 1:54:26.200
 So someone's sitting there, someone comes in,

1:54:26.200 --> 1:54:28.880
 they shake hands, and the person inevitably,

1:54:28.880 --> 1:54:31.040
 subconsciously touches their eyes.

1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:34.160
 They are taking chemicals from the skin contact

1:54:34.160 --> 1:54:37.260
 and they are placing it on a mucosal membrane of some sort,

1:54:37.260 --> 1:54:39.360
 typically not up their nose or in their mouth,

1:54:39.360 --> 1:54:40.840
 typically on their eyes.

1:54:40.840 --> 1:54:42.240
 Now, animals do this all the time.

1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:44.600
 There's a phenomenon in animals called bunting.

1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:48.280
 If you have a overeager dog that when you meet them

1:54:48.280 --> 1:54:50.400
 or you see them again, after you've been away for the day,

1:54:50.400 --> 1:54:52.560
 they'll rub their head against you, right?

1:54:52.560 --> 1:54:53.520
 Cats will do this too.

1:54:53.520 --> 1:54:54.560
 It's called bunting.

1:54:54.560 --> 1:54:56.280
 They're rubbing their scent glands on you.

1:54:56.280 --> 1:54:57.760
 They're marking you.

1:54:57.760 --> 1:54:59.920
 And believe it or not, you're marking other people

1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:01.360
 when you shake their hand.

1:55:01.360 --> 1:55:03.840
 And they are then taking your mark

1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:07.140
 and rubbing it on themselves subconsciously.

1:55:07.140 --> 1:55:08.920
 So we all do these kinds of behaviors.

1:55:08.920 --> 1:55:10.120
 And now that you're aware of it,

1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:11.800
 you can watch for it in your environment.

1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:13.880
 You can pay attention to people.

1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:15.140
 Some of this has probably changed

1:55:15.140 --> 1:55:17.480
 in light of the events of 2020, et cetera.

1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:21.240
 But nonetheless, we are evaluating the molecules

1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:22.600
 on people's breath.

1:55:22.600 --> 1:55:25.120
 We are evaluating the molecules on people's skin

1:55:25.120 --> 1:55:28.520
 by actively rubbing it on ourselves.

1:55:28.520 --> 1:55:31.360
 And we are actively involved in sensing

1:55:31.360 --> 1:55:32.740
 not just their facial expressions,

1:55:32.740 --> 1:55:34.800
 the size of their pupils and things like that,

1:55:34.800 --> 1:55:36.740
 but the chemicals that they are emitting,

1:55:36.740 --> 1:55:39.040
 their hormone status, how they smell.

1:55:39.040 --> 1:55:43.480
 We're detecting the pheromones possibly,

1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:45.700
 but certainly the odors in their breath.

1:55:45.700 --> 1:55:46.540
 You might say, well,

1:55:46.540 --> 1:55:48.500
 I don't actually go around sniffing people's breath.

1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:50.200
 I don't, you know, unless if it's bad,

1:55:50.200 --> 1:55:51.240
 in which case it's aversive,

1:55:51.240 --> 1:55:53.560
 but breath is communicating a lot of signals.

1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:56.320
 And this handshake eye rub experiment

1:55:56.320 --> 1:55:59.560
 shows that we are actively going through behaviors

1:55:59.560 --> 1:56:03.300
 reflexively to wipe ourselves or smear ourselves

1:56:03.300 --> 1:56:04.720
 with other people's chemicals.

1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:07.540
 Now that might seem odd or even gross to you,

1:56:07.540 --> 1:56:09.440
 but I think it's beautiful.

1:56:09.440 --> 1:56:11.520
 I think that it illustrates the extent

1:56:11.520 --> 1:56:14.320
 to which we as human beings are in some ways

1:56:14.320 --> 1:56:17.320
 among the other animals in our subconscious,

1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:18.160
 sometimes conscious,

1:56:18.160 --> 1:56:20.800
 but certainly subconscious tendency

1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:22.980
 to try and evaluate our chemical environment

1:56:22.980 --> 1:56:25.160
 through what we inhale through our nose,

1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:27.400
 what we ingest through our mouth,

1:56:27.400 --> 1:56:31.460
 and what we actively take off other people's skin

1:56:31.460 --> 1:56:34.480
 and rub on ourselves to evaluate it

1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:35.920
 and what we should do about it

1:56:35.920 --> 1:56:38.120
 and perhaps that person as well.

1:56:38.120 --> 1:56:40.960
 So today we talked a lot about olfaction, taste,

1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:43.320
 and chemical sensing between individuals.

1:56:43.320 --> 1:56:45.400
 I like to think that you now know a lot

1:56:45.400 --> 1:56:47.340
 about how your smell system works

1:56:47.340 --> 1:56:51.440
 and why inhaling is a really good thing to do in general

1:56:51.440 --> 1:56:54.000
 for waking up your brain and for cognitive function

1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.120
 and for enhancing your sense of smell.

1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:58.440
 We talked about how to enhance your sense of taste.

1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:01.380
 And we talked about chemical signaling between individuals

1:57:01.380 --> 1:57:03.680
 as a way of communicating some important aspects

1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:04.780
 about biology.

1:57:04.780 --> 1:57:07.360
 People are shaping each other's biology all the time

1:57:07.360 --> 1:57:09.420
 by way of these chemicals that are being traded

1:57:09.420 --> 1:57:11.960
 from one body to the next through air

1:57:11.960 --> 1:57:15.000
 and skin-to-skin contact and tears.

1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:16.260

 Huberman Lab on Instagram is where I post,

1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:50.420
 yes, clips from the podcast,

1:57:50.420 --> 1:57:53.440
 but also additional new and original content.

1:57:53.440 --> 1:57:55.120

1:57:55.120 --> 1:57:57.360
 in the comment section below those posts as well.

1:57:57.360 --> 1:58:01.320
 I do read all the comments on YouTube, on Apple,

1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:03.540
 and also on Instagram.

1:58:03.540 --> 1:58:05.800
 We have a website, hubermanlab.com,

1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:08.320
 where all the podcasts are housed

1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:10.640
 with links to YouTube, Apple, and Spotify,

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:12.360
 as well as downloadable links.

1:58:12.360 --> 1:58:14.340
 Everything's zero cost, of course.

1:58:14.340 --> 1:58:16.180
 And there, you can also find any links

1:58:16.180 --> 1:58:18.500
 to additional resources that we might post.

1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:21.320
 As well, please check out our sponsors

1:58:21.320 --> 1:58:23.820
 that we mentioned at the beginning of each podcast episode.

1:58:23.820 --> 1:58:25.720
 Those sponsors are the way that we are able

1:58:25.720 --> 1:58:28.220
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

1:58:28.220 --> 1:58:30.680
 about all these topics to you each week.

1:58:30.680 --> 1:58:32.340
 And we also have a Patreon.

1:58:32.340 --> 1:58:35.480
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:58:35.480 --> 1:58:39.000
 And there, you can support us at any level that you like.

1:58:39.000 --> 1:58:40.700
 Today, we didn't really talk about supplements,

1:58:40.700 --> 1:58:43.100
 but in previous episodes and in future episodes,

1:58:43.100 --> 1:58:45.040
 we'll talk about supplements and things that you can take

1:58:45.040 --> 1:58:48.160
 to modify your biology and nervous system if you like.

1:58:48.160 --> 1:58:50.800
 We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:53.040
 because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency

1:58:53.040 --> 1:58:55.460
 with respect to the amounts of given compounds

1:58:55.460 --> 1:58:56.800
 that are in their supplements

1:58:56.800 --> 1:58:59.380
 and the quality and purity of those compounds.

1:58:59.380 --> 1:59:03.660
 If you go to Thorne, thorne.com slash the letter U

1:59:03.660 --> 1:59:07.480
 slash Huberman, you can see all the supplements that I take

1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:09.840
 and get 20% off any of those supplements,

1:59:09.840 --> 1:59:13.000
 as well as any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.

1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:15.960
 You just go to thorne.com slash U slash Huberman.

1:59:15.960 --> 1:59:18.200
 And if you enter their website through that portal,

1:59:18.200 --> 1:59:21.120
 you get 20% off any of their things at checkout.

1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:22.120
 Last but not least,

1:59:22.120 --> 1:59:24.140
 I want to thank you for your time and attention

1:59:24.140 --> 1:59:26.960
 and your willingness to embrace new concepts and terms

1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:29.920
 and to learn about science and biology and protocols

1:59:29.920 --> 1:59:31.280
 that hopefully can benefit you

1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:32.660
 and the people that you know.

1:59:32.660 --> 1:59:35.580
 And of course, thank you for your interest in science.

1:59:35.580 --> 2:00:02.580
 And I'll see you in the next one.
