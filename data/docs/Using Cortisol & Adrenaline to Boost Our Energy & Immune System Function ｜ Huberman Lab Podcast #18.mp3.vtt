00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.560 --> 00:12.420
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.420 --> 00:15.620
 and ophthalmology at Stanford Schooledicine.

00:15.620 --> 00:17.460
 This podcast is separate from my teaching

00:17.460 --> 00:19.260
 and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.260 --> 00:21.340
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.340 --> 00:23.420
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.420 --> 00:25.740
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.740 --> 00:27.420
 to the general public.

00:27.420 --> 00:28.680
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.680 --> 00:31.660
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.660 --> 00:34.320
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.060
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

00:37.060 --> 00:39.860
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

00:39.860 --> 00:41.540
 to help you better understand your body

00:41.540 --> 00:43.540
 and reach your health goals.

00:43.540 --> 00:46.660
 I've long been a fan of doing blood tests,

00:46.660 --> 00:48.460
 and more recently as they've been developed,

00:48.460 --> 00:49.980
 also DNA tests.

00:49.980 --> 00:53.180
 And the reason for that is that so many of the factors

00:53.180 --> 00:55.740
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

00:55.740 --> 00:58.040
 and that inform our health choices

00:58.040 --> 01:01.640
 can only be analyzed by way of blood or DNA tests.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.160
 The great thing about Inside Tracker

01:03.160 --> 01:06.780
 is they make getting the blood and DNA tests extremely easy.

01:06.780 --> 01:08.320
 They'll come to your home if you like,

01:08.320 --> 01:11.340
 or you can go to a place where you can get your blood drawn

01:11.340 --> 01:13.840
 and your DNA swab taken there.

01:13.840 --> 01:16.560
 As well, once you get the information back

01:16.560 --> 01:19.260
 from Inside Tracker, it's very easy to understand

01:19.260 --> 01:21.460
 what to do with that information, how to interpret it.

01:21.460 --> 01:24.180
 And that's really what sets Inside Tracker apart, I believe,

01:24.180 --> 01:29.120
 from other blood and DNA testing tools and companies.

01:29.120 --> 01:31.660
 Most sources and companies will give you information back

01:31.660 --> 01:33.340
 about what your levels of hormones are

01:33.340 --> 01:35.380
 and metabolic factors, et cetera,

01:35.380 --> 01:37.200
 but no clear directives about what to do

01:37.200 --> 01:39.440
 with that information to get those markers

01:39.440 --> 01:41.480
 in the ranges that you want

01:41.480 --> 01:43.100
 in order to optimize your health.

01:43.100 --> 01:45.020
 Inside Tracker makes that all very easy.

01:45.020 --> 01:48.740
 It gives you directives about exercise, about nutrition,

01:48.740 --> 01:51.980
 about various supplements you may or may not want to take.

01:51.980 --> 01:54.320
 And once again, only through blood and DNA tests

01:54.320 --> 01:56.380
 can you access that information.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.920
 If you want to try Inside Tracker,

01:58.920 --> 02:01.940
 you can visit insidetracker.com slash Huberman.

02:11.980 --> 02:15.040
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

02:15.040 --> 02:16.860
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

02:16.860 --> 02:19.340
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

02:19.340 --> 02:22.580
 I've been taking Athletic Greens since 2012,

02:22.580 --> 02:25.060
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.580
 I started taking Athletic Greens

02:26.580 --> 02:29.580
 and I still take Athletic Greens once or twice a day

02:29.580 --> 02:32.720
 because it covers all my nutritional vitamin mineral

02:32.720 --> 02:34.300
 and probiotic bases.

02:34.300 --> 02:35.860
 Of course, you can get vitamins and minerals

02:35.860 --> 02:37.500
 and probiotics from food,

02:37.500 --> 02:38.620
 but many of us, including me,

02:38.620 --> 02:41.220
 find it hard to do that on a consistent basis,

02:41.220 --> 02:43.020
 especially when I'm working a lot,

02:43.020 --> 02:46.640
 when stress and sleep aren't optimized, et cetera.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.600
 With Athletic Greens,

02:47.600 --> 02:49.560
 I make sure to get all the things I need,

02:49.560 --> 02:52.100
 and then all the other supplements I take or what I eat,

02:52.100 --> 02:54.540
 I can consider additional insurance.

02:54.540 --> 02:56.940
 The great thing about Athletic Greens is it tastes great.

02:56.940 --> 02:58.200
 I like to mix mine with water

02:58.200 --> 02:59.460
 and a little bit of lemon juice.

02:59.460 --> 03:01.300
 I take it once early in the day

03:01.300 --> 03:04.080
 and then sometimes again in the afternoon.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.820
 The fact that it includes probiotics

03:05.820 --> 03:07.240
 is really important to me.

03:07.240 --> 03:10.060
 There are so many data now pointing to the fact

03:10.060 --> 03:12.740
 that probiotics and gut brain health

03:12.740 --> 03:16.340
 and gut health generally are very important for metabolism,

03:16.340 --> 03:19.380
 for hormone output, for neurotransmitter production,

03:19.380 --> 03:22.100
 so many vital things related to our health.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.220
 Athletic Greens makes it easy to make sure

03:24.220 --> 03:25.700
 that I'm getting everything that I need

03:25.700 --> 03:28.460
 in the vitamin mineral and probiotic department.

03:28.460 --> 03:29.900
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

03:29.900 --> 03:33.220
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

03:33.220 --> 03:34.580
 and claim a special offer.

03:34.580 --> 03:37.140
 They'll give you five free travel packs

03:37.140 --> 03:40.460
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.680
 There's now a ton of data as well pointing to the fact

03:43.680 --> 03:47.620
 that vitamin D3 and K2 are important for a huge number

03:47.620 --> 03:50.660
 of health related factors, including hormones,

03:50.660 --> 03:53.320
 metabolic factors, neurotransmitters, et cetera.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.380
 So they have the year supply of vitamin D3 completely free

03:56.380 --> 03:58.140
 along with your Athletic Greens offer

03:58.140 --> 03:59.920
 and you get the five free travel packs.

03:59.920 --> 04:01.020
 So if you'd like to try that,

04:01.020 --> 04:03.640
 you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

04:03.640 --> 04:05.540

04:05.540 --> 04:08.420
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

04:08.420 --> 04:11.940
 Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditation easy.

04:11.940 --> 04:14.280
 I started meditating many years ago,

04:14.280 --> 04:16.700
 but I found it was difficult to stay consistent

04:16.700 --> 04:18.400
 with my meditation practice.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.380
 In fact, when I would get stressed or really busy,

04:20.380 --> 04:21.980
 that's when I probably needed

04:21.980 --> 04:23.380
 the meditation practice the most.

04:23.380 --> 04:26.260
 And that's when I tended to drop the meditation practice

04:26.260 --> 04:27.580
 and run around doing other things.

04:27.580 --> 04:29.740
 So it was really a kind of catch 22.

04:29.740 --> 04:31.400
 I learned about Headspace a few years ago

04:31.400 --> 04:33.260
 on JetBlue flights when they had them included

04:33.260 --> 04:35.020
 as an option of whether or not to watch a movie

04:35.020 --> 04:37.040
 or a television show or do meditation.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.120
 I tried the meditation and I really liked it.

04:39.120 --> 04:42.540
 Very easy to follow along with a Headspace meditation.

04:42.540 --> 04:45.100
 The meditations that they include on the Headspace app

04:45.100 --> 04:47.100
 are also backed by dozens of peer reviewed

04:47.100 --> 04:48.820
 quality independent studies.

04:48.820 --> 04:50.540
 And of course there are now thousands

04:50.540 --> 04:53.060
 of peer reviewed quality studies pointing to the fact

04:53.060 --> 04:54.900
 that a meditation practice is beneficial

04:54.900 --> 04:57.540
 for sake of improved sleep, for reducing stress

04:57.540 --> 04:59.140
 and a number of other health metrics,

04:59.140 --> 05:02.260
 cardiovascular disease, risk, et cetera.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.660
 The great thing about Headspace is it's allowed me

05:04.660 --> 05:06.900
 to stay really consistent with my meditation practice.

05:06.900 --> 05:09.220
 They have meditations of different duration

05:09.220 --> 05:10.140
 and different type.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.420
 So you never get bored.

05:11.420 --> 05:13.380
 I actually look forward to my meditation practice

05:13.380 --> 05:15.140
 and it continues to benefit me.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.620
 In fact, since starting Headspace,

05:16.620 --> 05:18.660
 I've been consistent with meditation for much longer

05:18.660 --> 05:20.500
 than I ever had previously.

05:20.500 --> 05:21.780
 If you want to try Headspace,

05:21.780 --> 05:25.140
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer

05:25.140 --> 05:27.460
 and you'll get a free one month trial

05:27.460 --> 05:29.760
 with Headspace's full library of meditations

05:29.760 --> 05:31.120
 for every situation.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.160
 That's headspace.com slash special offer

05:34.160 --> 05:35.800
 to get a one month free trial.

05:35.800 --> 05:37.820
 That's their best offer out there right now.

05:37.820 --> 05:40.060
 And then you can try their full library of meditations

05:40.060 --> 05:41.560
 for every situation.

05:41.560 --> 05:44.500
 Today, we're going to continue our discussion about hormones

05:44.500 --> 05:47.620
 and we're going to focus on how particular hormones

05:47.620 --> 05:51.660
 influence our energy levels and our immune system.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.740
 Now, last episode, I mentioned at the end

05:53.740 --> 05:55.980
 that we were concluding our month on hormones

05:55.980 --> 05:59.060
 but we decided to include this additional episode.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.740
 So this would be the fifth episode

06:00.740 --> 06:04.040
 in the sequence of episodes about hormones

06:04.040 --> 06:05.380
 because there are two hormones

06:05.380 --> 06:08.380
 which are vitally important for a huge number

06:08.380 --> 06:11.220
 of biological functions that we will talk about today

06:11.220 --> 06:14.020
 but that are particularly important for energy levels

06:14.020 --> 06:15.220
 and your immune system.

06:15.220 --> 06:17.740
 This is something that I get asked about a lot.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.900
 So rather than skip to the next general topic,

06:19.900 --> 06:23.220
 today we're going to talk about the hormones cortisol

06:23.220 --> 06:25.720
 and epinephrine, also called adrenaline.

06:26.540 --> 06:29.260
 You do not have to have heard the previous episodes

06:29.260 --> 06:32.380
 on hormones in order to understand and digest the material

06:32.380 --> 06:34.180
 from today's podcast.

06:34.180 --> 06:36.780
 If I mentioned anything related to previous episodes,

06:36.780 --> 06:38.980
 I promise to give a little bit of quick background

06:38.980 --> 06:40.820
 to get everyone up to speed.

06:40.820 --> 06:43.680
 Today, we're going to talk about the biology of cortisol.

06:43.680 --> 06:46.040
 We're going to talk about the biology of epinephrine.

06:46.040 --> 06:47.380
 As always, we'll talk mechanism

06:47.380 --> 06:49.460
 and there are going to be a lot of tools.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.660
 If you're somebody who struggles with stress

06:51.660 --> 06:55.660
 and energy levels and balancing stress and energy levels,

06:55.660 --> 06:58.440
 today's episode is going to be vital for you.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.280
 If you're somebody who has challenges with sleep

07:00.280 --> 07:01.540
 or you're somebody who has challenges

07:01.540 --> 07:04.620
 getting your energy level up throughout the day

07:04.620 --> 07:07.200
 and getting your energy level down when you want to sleep,

07:07.200 --> 07:09.100
 today's episode is also for you.

07:09.100 --> 07:11.380
 And we're going to talk about the immune system

07:11.380 --> 07:14.180
 and how to enhance the function of your immune system.

07:14.180 --> 07:16.140
 We're also going to get into some fun topics

07:16.140 --> 07:17.860
 related to learning and memory

07:17.860 --> 07:20.140
 and how you can leverage cortisol

07:20.140 --> 07:23.680
 and epinephrine in particular in order to learn faster.

07:23.680 --> 07:26.160
 We're going to talk about so-called nootropics, smart drugs

07:26.160 --> 07:28.240
 and how they work because there are several of them

07:28.240 --> 07:30.420
 that tap into the epinephrine system

07:30.420 --> 07:33.700
 that aren't often discussed and that you have access to.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.060
 We're going to talk about how caffeine

07:35.060 --> 07:38.620
 can actually rewire your brain for better or for worse.

07:38.620 --> 07:41.260
 And we're going to talk about the biology of comfort foods

07:41.260 --> 07:44.140
 and why they work so well and what they're doing.

07:44.140 --> 07:45.660
 And in understanding that,

07:45.660 --> 07:48.980
 you'll be able to better understand your food choices

07:48.980 --> 07:51.500
 as they relate to short-term and long-term energy.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.820
 So we have a lot to cover.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.260
 Everything will be timestamped.

07:54.260 --> 07:56.720
 I want to just remind people that we caption every episode

07:56.720 --> 07:58.780
 in English and in Spanish.

07:58.780 --> 08:01.640
 The captions take a day or two to pop up on YouTube.

08:01.640 --> 08:04.340
 So if you're not seeing those within the first couple days,

08:04.340 --> 08:06.460
 please be patient with us in order to get captions

08:06.460 --> 08:10.220
 that actually read similarly to what I'm saying.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.020
 We go through a captioning service

08:12.020 --> 08:13.560
 and so we have them done by experts

08:13.560 --> 08:15.880
 and that takes a little bit of additional time.

08:15.880 --> 08:18.540
 Meanwhile, if you have any questions

08:18.540 --> 08:20.560
 as the episode evolves, please write them down,

08:20.560 --> 08:22.140
 please put them in the comment section,

08:22.140 --> 08:24.700
 please subscribe to the channel if you haven't already

08:24.700 --> 08:26.460
 and let's get started talking about

08:26.460 --> 08:29.020
 how to increase your energy and improve

08:29.020 --> 08:31.980
 and increase your immunity by leveraging the biology

08:31.980 --> 08:34.660
 of cortisol and adrenaline.

08:34.660 --> 08:37.700
 Before we dive into the biology of increasing energy

08:37.700 --> 08:41.040
 and your immune system, I want to cover three topics

08:41.040 --> 08:44.660
 that I promised I would mention from previous episodes.

08:44.660 --> 08:48.000
 The first one relates to intermittent fasting.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.580
 The second one relates to why your stomach grumbles.

08:51.580 --> 08:54.140
 I forgot to mention the biology of that last time.

08:54.140 --> 08:57.480
 And the third is a powerful way to increase growth hormone,

08:57.480 --> 08:59.660
 which is powerful for increasing metabolism,

08:59.660 --> 09:01.700
 fat burning and tissue repair, et cetera,

09:01.700 --> 09:03.600
 that doesn't involve a sauna

09:03.600 --> 09:07.040
 or wrapping yourself in plastic bags and going for a jog.

09:07.040 --> 09:08.900
 So first, intermittent fasting.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.100
 Last episode, I talked a lot about growth hormone

09:11.100 --> 09:13.900
 and thyroid hormone and I mentioned things like sauna

09:13.900 --> 09:16.900
 and exercise and sleep and how they can increase levels

09:16.900 --> 09:19.820
 of growth hormone within the healthy ranges

09:19.820 --> 09:23.380
 and why increasing growth hormone can be very beneficial

09:23.380 --> 09:25.780
 because it can burn off body fat,

09:25.780 --> 09:29.020
 it can improve muscle and general tissue health,

09:29.020 --> 09:31.380
 cartilage, et cetera, and we tend to lose

09:31.380 --> 09:35.220
 or our levels of growth hormone are reduced as we age.

09:35.220 --> 09:37.420
 Many people ask me, well, what about fasting?

09:37.420 --> 09:39.460
 Everyone's been promised on the internet

09:39.460 --> 09:42.460
 that intermittent fasting leads to these big increases

09:42.460 --> 09:44.020
 in growth hormone.

09:44.020 --> 09:46.380
 The reason I didn't mention it is that I couldn't find

09:46.380 --> 09:48.720
 a study that actually pointed to the underlying mechanism.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.480
 I saw lots of claims, lots of podcasts,

09:51.480 --> 09:54.280
 lots of degrees behind people's names,

09:54.280 --> 09:56.820
 sometimes biologists, sometimes entirely different fields

09:56.820 --> 10:00.060
 talking about this, but very few studies.

10:00.060 --> 10:02.660
 And then I found what I would consider the study.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.140
 We will link to this study.

10:04.140 --> 10:08.940
 Turns out that fasting does increase growth hormone levels

10:08.940 --> 10:11.740
 and the way that it does it is fascinating.

10:11.740 --> 10:14.240
 I mentioned in a previous podcast about hunger

10:14.240 --> 10:17.540
 and timing of meals and timing of hunger

10:17.540 --> 10:20.660
 that when you're hungry, you release a hormone

10:20.660 --> 10:22.260
 in your body called ghrelin,

10:22.260 --> 10:24.020
 sometimes actually called ghrelin.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.660
 Thanks for all of you ghrelinistas or ghrelinistas

10:26.660 --> 10:27.940
 that corrected my pronunciation.

10:27.940 --> 10:31.060
 It's both ghrelin or ghrelin, either one works.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.600
 Ghrelin makes you hungry.

10:33.600 --> 10:36.260
 When blood glucose, your blood sugar is low,

10:36.260 --> 10:39.420
 ghrelin is secreted and makes you hungry.

10:39.420 --> 10:42.460
 And it turns out that ghrelin, this hunger hormone,

10:42.460 --> 10:45.720
 actually binds to the receptor in the brain

10:45.720 --> 10:50.080
 that normally binds what's called

10:50.080 --> 10:52.500
 growth hormone releasing hormone.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.160
 So believe it or not, the hunger hormone

10:54.160 --> 10:56.360
 can act like growth hormone releasing hormone

10:56.360 --> 10:59.220
 and thereby stimulate growth hormone.

10:59.220 --> 11:02.660
 Now, the levels of growth hormone that fasting promotes

11:02.660 --> 11:05.020
 through this ghrelin system are pretty substantial.

11:05.020 --> 11:07.180
 It's about a doubling of growth hormone levels

11:07.180 --> 11:08.920
 in the waking state.

11:08.920 --> 11:11.380
 So we know that you can release growth hormone in sleep.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.100
 Intermittent fasting, it turns out,

11:13.100 --> 11:16.860
 can increase growth hormone by binding ghrelin

11:16.860 --> 11:19.500
 to the growth hormone releasing hormone receptor.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.380
 And it does it also during the daytime.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.320
 So yes, indeed, fasting can increase growth hormone,

11:24.320 --> 11:27.540
 not to the supra levels that taking growth hormone

11:27.540 --> 11:30.560
 would increase it or that a sauna could increase it,

11:30.560 --> 11:33.560
 but it does seem to increase growth hormone.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.020
 Later in today's episode,

11:35.020 --> 11:37.880
 we're going to talk a lot about different patterns

11:37.880 --> 11:42.540
 of fasting and eating that can control epinephrine.

11:42.540 --> 11:46.580
 And so we will return to specifics about how long a fast.

11:46.580 --> 11:49.320
 Do you need to fast for two or three days or 23 hours?

11:49.320 --> 11:51.700
 Fortunately, for people like me who love to eat,

11:51.700 --> 11:52.940
 that's not the case.

11:52.940 --> 11:55.060
 So we'll talk specific fasting protocols

11:55.060 --> 11:56.160
 later in the episode.

11:57.100 --> 12:00.500
 We also said we were going to talk about tummy grumble.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.500
 When your stomach growls,

12:02.500 --> 12:04.800
 it is not because of fluid sifting around in there.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.220
 A lot of people think, oh, you know,

12:06.220 --> 12:07.100
 it's fluid sifting around.

12:07.100 --> 12:10.780
 It turns out that your stomach has smooth muscle

12:10.780 --> 12:11.940
 that lines its sides.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.000
 And when you eat something or you don't,

12:14.000 --> 12:14.840
 every once in a while,

12:14.840 --> 12:18.140
 your stomach cinches off at the two ends like a bag

12:18.140 --> 12:19.240
 with a hose on either end,

12:19.240 --> 12:21.820
 because that's essentially what your digestive system is.

12:21.820 --> 12:23.620
 And if there's nothing in there,

12:23.620 --> 12:27.500
 what happens is the muscles that line the sides

12:27.500 --> 12:28.340
 of your stomach,

12:28.340 --> 12:32.300
 they kind of extend around the stomach in these cables.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.380
 Those are always there.

12:33.380 --> 12:35.300
 And if you have food in your stomach,

12:35.300 --> 12:36.940
 what they do is they churn your stomach.

12:36.940 --> 12:38.940
 They literally turn the muscles of your stomach

12:38.940 --> 12:41.240
 like a tumbler to help break up the food

12:41.240 --> 12:43.020
 that presumably you didn't chew well enough

12:43.020 --> 12:44.660
 because you were eating too fast.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.980
 When you don't have any food in your stomach,

12:47.980 --> 12:49.400
 that churning continues.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.500
 And that contraction of the muscle and the turning,

12:51.500 --> 12:53.460
 literally turning over of your muscles,

12:53.460 --> 12:54.860
 they don't flip over completely,

12:54.860 --> 12:56.080
 but the turning over the muscles,

12:56.080 --> 12:58.900
 that's what causes the stomach growling.

12:58.900 --> 13:01.220
 If you don't want to be the person in the meeting

13:01.220 --> 13:03.460
 or sitting there in a quiet theater

13:03.460 --> 13:06.820
 whose stomach is growling, chew your food better.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.340
 That's the simple solution.

13:08.340 --> 13:09.220
 And last episode,

13:09.220 --> 13:13.780
 I talked a lot about how sauna controlled safe hyperthermia

13:13.780 --> 13:16.420
 can cause huge increases in growth hormone release,

13:16.420 --> 13:18.660
 anywhere from 300 to 500,

13:18.660 --> 13:23.420
 even 1,600% increases in growth hormone release,

13:23.420 --> 13:26.780
 really staggeringly high increases.

13:26.780 --> 13:28.980
 I point out that many people don't have saunas

13:28.980 --> 13:30.740
 in their yard or in their homes,

13:30.740 --> 13:32.840
 and they would go through some other measures

13:32.840 --> 13:35.300
 to increase safely their body heat,

13:36.260 --> 13:38.000
 creating a steam room in their bathroom

13:38.000 --> 13:41.100
 or jogging with extra sweats on, this kind of thing.

13:41.100 --> 13:42.860
 Many of you asked about hot baths.

13:42.860 --> 13:46.080
 Hot baths will increase growth hormone, excuse me.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.220
 However, the temperatures that you need

13:48.220 --> 13:50.640
 in order to increase growth hormone

13:50.640 --> 13:52.820
 are high enough that you run the risk of burn.

13:52.820 --> 13:54.820
 And so I really can't make any recommendations

13:54.820 --> 13:57.620
 about hot baths, but if you can tolerate a nice hot bath,

13:57.620 --> 13:59.580
 you are going to get some growth hormone release.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.260
 However, the sauna has this advantage

14:01.260 --> 14:04.140
 of you being able to enter 175 degree

14:04.140 --> 14:05.780
 or 200 degree environment,

14:05.780 --> 14:08.300
 provided you're not pregnant, you're not a young child,

14:08.300 --> 14:10.300
 et cetera, you can do that safely.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.360
 And getting big increases in growth hormone,

14:12.360 --> 14:14.940
 the hot bath will lead to lesser increases

14:14.940 --> 14:16.540
 in growth hormone.

14:16.540 --> 14:18.240
 We're going to talk a lot about temperature regulation

14:18.240 --> 14:20.780
 in a future episode, but as always,

14:20.780 --> 14:23.500
 if you're ever going to start playing with hypothermia

14:23.500 --> 14:27.140
 or hypothermia, cold baths, ice baths, hot showers,

14:27.140 --> 14:29.020
 hot baths that are beyond the kind of norm

14:29.020 --> 14:31.900
 of what's comfortable, you have to be extremely careful

14:31.900 --> 14:33.500
 and please consult a doctor.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.420
 I think it's fair to say that most people

14:35.420 --> 14:38.460
 would like to have a lot of energy during the day,

14:38.460 --> 14:40.540
 if you work during the day,

14:40.540 --> 14:43.860
 and they'd like their energy to taper off at night.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.700
 And I think it's fair to say that most people

14:45.700 --> 14:48.700
 don't enjoy being sick, nobody wants to get sick.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.800
 In other words, you want to have energy

14:51.800 --> 14:54.820
 and you want your immune system to function well,

14:54.820 --> 14:56.900
 to ward off infections of various kinds,

14:56.900 --> 15:00.180
 bacterial infections, viral infections, et cetera.

15:00.180 --> 15:02.300
 And it turns out that the two hormones

15:02.300 --> 15:05.900
 that dominate those processes of having enough energy

15:05.900 --> 15:07.980
 and having a healthy immune system

15:07.980 --> 15:10.820
 are cortisol and epinephrine.

15:10.820 --> 15:14.540
 Epinephrine is the same thing as adrenaline.

15:14.540 --> 15:17.620
 In the body, we tend to call adrenaline adrenaline

15:17.620 --> 15:20.940
 and in the brain, we tend to call adrenaline epinephrine.

15:20.940 --> 15:24.380
 And I'm sorry for that, I didn't create this naming system.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.620
 And the story behind it is uninteresting

15:26.620 --> 15:27.620
 and not worth our time.

15:27.620 --> 15:30.540
 I will use the words adrenaline and epinephrine

15:30.540 --> 15:32.740
 interchangeably today.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.420
 Cortisol is cortisol.

15:34.420 --> 15:36.440
 And I just want to cover a little bit

15:36.440 --> 15:38.820
 about what cortisol and epinephrine are,

15:38.820 --> 15:42.060
 where they are released in the body and brain,

15:42.060 --> 15:44.240
 because if you can understand that,

15:44.240 --> 15:46.840
 you will understand better how to control them.

15:48.620 --> 15:53.300
 First of all, cortisol is a steroid hormone,

15:53.300 --> 15:56.880
 much like estrogen and testosterone,

15:56.880 --> 16:00.660
 in that it is derived from cholesterol.

16:00.660 --> 16:03.060
 Now that could be cholesterol that you eat.

16:03.060 --> 16:06.060
 It could be cholesterol that's produced by the liver.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.300
 As many of you probably know,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.780
 the relationship between dietary cholesterol,

16:10.780 --> 16:14.420
 the fats that you eat and blood cholesterol

16:14.420 --> 16:17.740
 and liver cholesterol is a very controversial one.

16:17.740 --> 16:19.660
 It's a barbed wire topic.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.660
 There are people that claim that dietary cholesterol

16:21.660 --> 16:25.380
 has zero impact on circulating cholesterol

16:25.380 --> 16:26.260
 coming from the liver.

16:26.260 --> 16:29.260
 There are people who argue the exact opposite,

16:29.260 --> 16:32.200
 both with good data in hand, I would say.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.700
 There are some problems for the idea

16:34.700 --> 16:36.380
 that all your cholesterol levels

16:36.380 --> 16:39.660
 are determined by dietary intake,

16:39.660 --> 16:43.020
 namely that anorexics often have very high levels

16:43.020 --> 16:44.660
 of cholesterol that their liver produces,

16:44.660 --> 16:46.100
 even though they are eating very little

16:46.100 --> 16:47.940
 and sometimes not eating at all.

16:47.940 --> 16:52.340
 So understand that cholesterol is a precursor molecule,

16:52.340 --> 16:54.580
 meaning it's the substrate from which a lot of things

16:54.580 --> 16:57.100
 like testosterone and estrogen are made.

16:57.100 --> 17:00.080
 Please also understand that cholesterol can be made

17:00.080 --> 17:03.700
 into estrogen or testosterone or cortisol,

17:03.700 --> 17:07.800
 and that cortisol is sort of the competitive partner

17:07.800 --> 17:09.320
 to estrogen and testosterone.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.380
 What this means is no matter how much cholesterol

17:12.380 --> 17:13.760
 you're eating or you produce,

17:13.760 --> 17:15.700
 whether or not it's low or it's high,

17:15.700 --> 17:19.180
 if you are stressed, more of that cholesterol

17:19.180 --> 17:23.060
 is going to be devoted toward creating cortisol,

17:23.060 --> 17:25.500
 which is indeed a stress hormone.

17:25.500 --> 17:28.820
 However, the word stress shouldn't stress you out

17:28.820 --> 17:30.240
 because you need cortisol.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.420
 Cortisol is vital.

17:31.420 --> 17:34.220
 You don't want your cortisol levels to be too low.

17:34.220 --> 17:36.460
 It's very important for immune system function,

17:36.460 --> 17:39.260
 for memory, for not getting depressed.

17:39.260 --> 17:41.980
 You just don't want your cortisol levels to be too high,

17:41.980 --> 17:44.660
 and you don't want them to be elevated

17:44.660 --> 17:47.900
 even to normal levels at the wrong time of day.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.980
 So we're going to talk about how to control

17:49.980 --> 17:53.300
 the timing and level of your cortisol.

17:53.300 --> 17:58.300
 Epinephrine or adrenaline has also been demonized a bit.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.560
 We think of it as this stress hormone,

18:01.560 --> 18:03.980
 this thing that makes us anxious, fight or flight.

18:03.980 --> 18:05.560
 You know, we used to get chased by lions

18:05.560 --> 18:07.660
 and tigers and bears, and now we don't,

18:07.660 --> 18:09.240
 and it's this ancient hangover.

18:09.240 --> 18:10.260
 That's all wrong.

18:10.260 --> 18:12.220
 The fact of the matter is that epinephrine

18:12.220 --> 18:15.960
 is your best friend when it comes to your immunity,

18:15.960 --> 18:18.860
 when it comes to protecting you from infection,

18:18.860 --> 18:20.620
 and we're going to talk about why,

18:20.620 --> 18:24.020
 and epinephrine, adrenaline, is your best friend

18:24.020 --> 18:25.760
 when it comes to remembering things

18:25.760 --> 18:28.460
 and learning and activating neuroplasticity.

18:28.460 --> 18:29.940
 We're going to talk about that as well.

18:29.940 --> 18:33.220
 Once again, it's a question of how much and how long

18:33.220 --> 18:35.580
 and the specific timing of release of cortisol

18:35.580 --> 18:39.340
 and epinephrine, as opposed to cortisol and adrenaline

18:39.340 --> 18:40.580
 being good or bad.

18:40.580 --> 18:43.260
 They're terrific when they're regulated.

18:43.260 --> 18:45.420
 They are terrible when they're misregulated,

18:45.420 --> 18:48.900
 and we will give you lots of tools to regulate them better.

18:48.900 --> 18:52.660
 Cortisol biology 101 in less than two minutes.

18:54.280 --> 18:57.460
 Your brain makes what we call releasing hormones,

18:57.460 --> 19:00.180
 and in this case, there's corticotropin-releasing hormone,

19:00.180 --> 19:03.180
 CRH, is made by neurons in your brain.

19:03.180 --> 19:06.060
 It causes the pituitary, this gland that sits

19:06.060 --> 19:08.620
 about an inch in front of the roof of your mouth

19:08.620 --> 19:13.580
 and the base of your brain, to release ACTH.

19:13.580 --> 19:17.000
 ACTH then goes and causes your adrenals,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.940
 which sit above your kidneys in your lower back,

19:19.940 --> 19:23.400
 to release cortisol, a so-called stress hormone.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.700
 But I would like you to think about cortisol

19:25.700 --> 19:30.180
 not as a stress hormone, but as a hormone of energy.

19:30.180 --> 19:33.300
 It produces a situation in the brain and body

19:33.300 --> 19:36.060
 whereby you want to move

19:36.060 --> 19:39.080
 and whereby you don't want to rest

19:39.080 --> 19:44.080
 and whereby you don't want to eat, at least at first.

19:45.100 --> 19:49.220
 Epinephrine or adrenaline 101 in less than two minutes.

19:50.200 --> 19:52.500
 When you sense a stressor with your mind

19:52.500 --> 19:55.580
 or your body senses a stressor, excuse me,

19:55.580 --> 19:57.600
 from a wound or something of that sort,

19:58.780 --> 20:00.940
 a signal is sent to neurons that are

20:00.940 --> 20:02.140
 in the middle of your body.

20:02.140 --> 20:03.940
 They're called the sympathetic chain ganglia.

20:03.940 --> 20:05.820
 The name doesn't necessarily matter.

20:05.820 --> 20:07.780
 They release norepinephrine very quickly.

20:07.780 --> 20:10.220
 It's almost like a sprinkler system

20:10.220 --> 20:13.980
 that just hoses your body with epinephrine.

20:15.560 --> 20:18.500
 That will increase heart rate, will increase breathing rate.

20:18.500 --> 20:20.900
 In some cases, it will constrict your blood vessels.

20:20.900 --> 20:25.420
 It will also increase the size of vessels and arteries

20:25.420 --> 20:28.960
 that are giving blood flow to your vital organs.

20:28.960 --> 20:32.260
 This is why your extremities get cold when you're stressed

20:32.260 --> 20:33.580
 and your heart is beating faster.

20:33.580 --> 20:37.880
 More of that energy is being devoted toward your core.

20:37.880 --> 20:42.880
 You also release adrenaline from your adrenals

20:42.960 --> 20:45.860
 in, again, riding atop your kidneys.

20:46.740 --> 20:50.860
 Those are a second system whereby your system gets flooded

20:50.860 --> 20:52.860
 with adrenaline in pulses.

20:52.860 --> 20:54.540
 So you can get one pulse, you can get 10 pulses.

20:54.540 --> 20:57.340
 We'll talk about how to regulate the number of pulses.

20:57.340 --> 20:59.160
 And you release it from an area of your brain

20:59.160 --> 21:00.780
 called locus coeruleus,

21:00.780 --> 21:03.380
 and that creates alertness in your brain.

21:03.380 --> 21:06.880
 If you want to learn more about the stress response

21:06.880 --> 21:08.240
 and all the details of that,

21:08.240 --> 21:10.420
 including some protocols of how to regulate stress,

21:10.420 --> 21:12.340
 please see our episode about stress.

21:12.340 --> 21:15.360
 I go into a lot of detail there.

21:15.360 --> 21:17.540
 I will touch on some of the same themes today,

21:17.540 --> 21:20.640
 but I really want to cover energy and the immune system.

21:21.540 --> 21:24.220
 And if you're very much interested in stress per se

21:24.220 --> 21:27.700
 and stress regulation, please see the episode on stress.

21:28.580 --> 21:32.180
 Okay, so we have cortisol and we have epinephrine,

21:32.180 --> 21:34.380
 and their net effect is to increase energy.

21:34.380 --> 21:37.500
 So first of all, I want to give you a tool

21:37.500 --> 21:42.500
 that will help you regulate cortisol

21:42.740 --> 21:45.580
 and can also help stave off

21:45.580 --> 21:48.100
 certain patterns of mental illness.

21:48.100 --> 21:49.820
 Now, of course, it's not going to cure mental illness

21:49.820 --> 21:53.340
 on its own, but it can support healthy state of mind

21:53.340 --> 21:55.700
 and can help reduce unhealthy states of mind,

21:55.700 --> 21:57.260
 including depression.

21:57.260 --> 21:58.980
 So the first tool is to make sure

21:58.980 --> 22:01.420
 that your highest levels of cortisol

22:01.420 --> 22:03.960
 are first thing in the morning when you wake up.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.420
 One way or another, every 24 hours,

22:06.420 --> 22:08.500
 you will get an increase in cortisol.

22:08.500 --> 22:09.780
 That is non-negotiable.

22:09.780 --> 22:12.220
 That is written into your genome.

22:12.220 --> 22:16.420
 That increase in cortisol is there to wake you up

22:16.420 --> 22:17.980
 and to make you alert.

22:17.980 --> 22:21.020
 It's to stimulate movement from being asleep,

22:21.020 --> 22:22.900
 presumably horizontal,

22:22.900 --> 22:26.000
 to getting up and starting to move about your day.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.460
 And I've said it before, but I will say it again,

22:28.460 --> 22:32.060
 the best way to stimulate that increase in cortisol

22:32.060 --> 22:35.700
 at the appropriate time is that very soon after waking,

22:35.700 --> 22:38.300
 within 30 minutes or so after waking,

22:38.300 --> 22:41.460
 get outside, view some sunlight.

22:41.460 --> 22:44.160
 Even if it's overcast, get outside, view some sunlight,

22:44.160 --> 22:47.620
 no sunglasses, never look at any light so bright

22:47.620 --> 22:48.540
 that it could damage your eyes,

22:48.540 --> 22:51.020
 but do that for two to 10 minutes.

22:51.020 --> 22:52.300
 If it's very bright, two minutes.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.660
 If it's not so bright, 10 minutes.

22:54.660 --> 22:57.740
 Do that because in the early part of the day,

22:57.740 --> 23:01.260
 you have the opportunity to time that cortisol release

23:01.260 --> 23:04.900
 to the early part of the day, which will improve.

23:04.900 --> 23:06.640
 This has been backed by peer reviewed studies.

23:06.640 --> 23:08.300
 It will improve your focus.

23:08.300 --> 23:10.460
 It will improve your energy levels

23:10.460 --> 23:13.460
 and it will improve your learning throughout the day.

23:13.460 --> 23:18.460
 It will also prevent a late shift in cortisol increase

23:18.780 --> 23:21.860
 and late shifted cortisol, meaning cortisol that increases

23:21.860 --> 23:25.900
 around eight or 9 p.m. is a signature feature

23:25.900 --> 23:27.740
 of many depressive disorders,

23:27.740 --> 23:30.540
 including major depression, anxiety.

23:30.540 --> 23:31.740
 And that of course correlates

23:31.740 --> 23:33.740
 with things like insomnia, et cetera.

23:33.740 --> 23:35.780
 So that's a key tool.

23:35.780 --> 23:38.580
 And I don't know how many of you are already doing that,

23:38.580 --> 23:40.420
 but it is vital to do.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.340
 Now I mentioned sunlight even on cloudy days

23:43.340 --> 23:44.900
 and there are specific reasons for that.

23:44.900 --> 23:48.000
 So I want to just briefly cover the data

23:48.000 --> 23:49.680
 because in the episodes on sleep,

23:49.680 --> 23:51.240
 I talked about brightness of light

23:51.240 --> 23:53.620
 in regulating cortisol and sleep.

23:53.620 --> 23:56.900
 And I talked about how to measure lux brightness,

23:56.900 --> 23:59.140
 but I was not specific enough.

23:59.140 --> 24:00.860
 I realized based on the questions

24:00.860 --> 24:02.500
 that I've received since that episode.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.160
 So here's how it works.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.580
 Going outside and getting some sunlight requires

24:07.580 --> 24:11.240
 that I also tell you how long and under what conditions.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.420
 I've said looking through a window is not as good.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.860
 It takes 50 times longer to get as much light,

24:15.860 --> 24:16.920
 et cetera, et cetera.

24:17.860 --> 24:19.180
 Many, many questions have told me

24:19.180 --> 24:20.620
 that I'm not being specific enough.

24:20.620 --> 24:22.100
 So I'm going to give you the data

24:22.100 --> 24:24.220
 and from the data you will understand exactly

24:24.220 --> 24:26.660
 how long you need to do this each day.

24:26.660 --> 24:29.440
 On a sunny day, so no cloud cover,

24:29.440 --> 24:32.940
 provided that the sun is not yet overhead,

24:32.940 --> 24:34.620
 it's somewhere low in the sky,

24:34.620 --> 24:35.900
 could have just crossed the horizon

24:35.900 --> 24:36.980
 or if you wake up a little bit later,

24:36.980 --> 24:38.780
 it could be somewhat low in the sky.

24:39.980 --> 24:42.060
 Basically the intensity of light,

24:42.060 --> 24:44.980
 the brightness is somewhere around 100,000 lux.

24:44.980 --> 24:47.180
 Lux is just a measurement of brightness.

24:47.180 --> 24:50.460
 If you want to download the app Light Meter,

24:50.460 --> 24:52.500
 that is a free app that will allow you to do that.

24:52.500 --> 24:56.320
 You can hold your finger down on the little button there

24:56.320 --> 24:57.480
 and you can move it around

24:57.480 --> 24:59.300
 and it will continuously give you a lux readout.

24:59.300 --> 25:01.500
 It's not perfect, it's not exact,

25:01.500 --> 25:04.260
 but it's pretty good and it is zero cost.

25:04.260 --> 25:08.260
 I have no relationship to Light Meter, the company.

25:08.260 --> 25:12.020
 On a cloudy day, it's about 10,000 lux.

25:12.020 --> 25:15.820
 So 10 fold reduction, but bright artificial light,

25:15.820 --> 25:17.960
 very bright artificial light,

25:17.960 --> 25:20.520
 is somewhere around 1,000 lux.

25:21.540 --> 25:24.140
 And ordinary room light

25:24.140 --> 25:27.780
 is somewhere around 100 to 200 lux.

25:27.780 --> 25:29.920
 And it has to do with how much light scatter there is.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.420
 So even if you have a very bright bulb

25:31.420 --> 25:33.700
 sitting right next to you, that's not going to do the job.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.360
 Your phone will not do the job, not early in the day.

25:36.360 --> 25:39.660
 To get the cortisol released at the appropriate time,

25:39.660 --> 25:41.380
 you need to get outside.

25:41.380 --> 25:44.660
 So let's just set a couple general parameters.

25:44.660 --> 25:48.340
 If it's bright outside and no cloud cover,

25:48.340 --> 25:49.700
 the light can be indirect,

25:49.700 --> 25:51.020
 you don't have to be staring into the sun,

25:51.020 --> 25:52.340
 please don't damage your eyes.

25:52.340 --> 25:54.240
 We can't regenerate those neurons yet

25:54.240 --> 25:56.060
 and restore vision that's lost.

25:56.060 --> 25:58.460
 But if you have to blink, that means it's too bright.

25:58.460 --> 26:01.820
 It's fine to blink, of course, please do if you need to.

26:01.820 --> 26:03.360
 Get outside for 10 minutes

26:04.820 --> 26:07.220
 or five minutes should suffice,

26:07.220 --> 26:09.660
 but 10 minutes is sure to suffice.

26:09.660 --> 26:12.240
 If it's a cloudy day, dense overcast,

26:12.240 --> 26:14.340
 you're probably going to need about 30 minutes.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.140
 If it's light cloud, broken cloud cover,

26:16.140 --> 26:17.260
 it's probably going to be somewhere

26:17.260 --> 26:19.220
 between 10 and 20 minutes.

26:19.220 --> 26:21.580
 And if you can't get outside or you're on an airplane

26:21.580 --> 26:24.980
 and it's bright overhead artificial lights

26:24.980 --> 26:26.540
 or ordinary room lights,

26:26.540 --> 26:29.260
 it's going to take you about six hours of light.

26:29.260 --> 26:32.060
 And by time you reach the middle

26:32.060 --> 26:34.740
 of your sort of wakeful period, it's too late.

26:34.740 --> 26:36.000
 You won't be able to shift your clock

26:36.000 --> 26:38.340
 and your cortisol will start drifting later and later.

26:38.340 --> 26:42.140
 This is why it's vital to get this light on a regular basis,

26:42.140 --> 26:44.700
 to get that cortisol released early in the day.

26:44.700 --> 26:47.580
 That sets you up for optimal levels of energy.

26:47.580 --> 26:49.420
 It sets you up for great sleep,

26:49.420 --> 26:52.820
 but today's not really about sleep, it's more about energy.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.580
 That cortisol pulse and the stress

26:54.580 --> 26:56.020
 that you might feel early in the day

26:56.020 --> 26:58.700
 from having a little bit extra energy,

26:58.700 --> 27:02.140
 that is the energy that you want in order to move about

27:02.140 --> 27:03.900
 and learn and do various things.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.100
 That is a healthy level of energy.

27:06.100 --> 27:10.140
 So please try and get that sunlight

27:10.140 --> 27:12.680
 if it's within your protocols to do that

27:12.680 --> 27:14.140
 and try and get sufficient sunlight

27:14.140 --> 27:16.460
 first thing in the morning, again, within the first hour.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.780
 That's the best way to make sure

27:17.780 --> 27:20.260
 that you time your cortisol appropriately.

27:20.260 --> 27:21.180
 Now, throughout the day,

27:21.180 --> 27:23.860
 you're going to experience different things.

27:23.860 --> 27:25.860
 Most of you are not spending your entire day

27:25.860 --> 27:27.540
 trying to optimize your health.

27:27.540 --> 27:30.320
 Some of you might be, but most of you have jobs

27:30.320 --> 27:32.520
 and you have families and you have commitments.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.980
 Life enters the picture and provides you stressors.

27:35.980 --> 27:38.620
 And those stressors, whatever they may happen to be,

27:38.620 --> 27:42.180
 a difficult coworker, some disappointment about something,

27:42.180 --> 27:43.700
 you didn't get the raise you expected

27:43.700 --> 27:46.260
 or you didn't get the vacation that you expected,

27:46.260 --> 27:50.780
 those will cause increases in cortisol and epinephrine.

27:50.780 --> 27:52.500
 This is important to understand.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.480
 You don't have the luxury

27:54.480 --> 27:56.140
 of just having this morning cortisol

27:56.140 --> 27:57.580
 and then having it taper off.

27:57.580 --> 27:59.860
 You want that major cortisol early in the day,

27:59.860 --> 28:02.820
 but then you can expect, you should expect,

28:02.820 --> 28:05.960
 increases in cortisol and adrenaline throughout the day

28:05.960 --> 28:08.180
 based on events that are unpleasant to you.

28:08.180 --> 28:10.420
 So for me, the events that are most unpleasant to me

28:10.420 --> 28:12.380
 are things like traffic,

28:12.380 --> 28:14.560
 emails that ask me to fill out a form

28:14.560 --> 28:16.100
 for which I can't find the link.

28:16.100 --> 28:17.660
 These kinds of things stress me out.

28:17.660 --> 28:18.840
 I'm a human being.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.380
 I don't lose my cool over them,

28:20.380 --> 28:22.960
 but I can feel my level of alertness

28:22.960 --> 28:24.340
 and kind of frustration increase.

28:24.340 --> 28:26.440
 The normal kind of things that go with stress

28:26.440 --> 28:27.580
 tense up a little bit.

28:28.500 --> 28:32.060
 The key is these blips in cortisol and epinephrine

28:32.060 --> 28:33.860
 need to be brief.

28:33.860 --> 28:37.920
 You can't have them so often or lasting so long

28:37.920 --> 28:41.380
 that you are in a state of chronic cortisol elevation

28:41.380 --> 28:43.960
 or chronic epinephrine elevation.

28:43.960 --> 28:46.520
 This system of stress was designed

28:46.520 --> 28:49.180
 to increase your alertness and mobilize you towards things,

28:49.180 --> 28:52.500
 get you frustrated and provide the opportunity

28:52.500 --> 28:53.420
 to change behavior.

28:53.420 --> 28:54.580
 That's what they were designed to do.

28:54.580 --> 28:57.540
 So if you find yourself getting stressed

28:57.540 --> 28:58.780
 and staying stressed,

28:58.780 --> 29:01.740
 there are great tools that we provide in the stress episode

29:01.740 --> 29:04.400
 that relate to things like the double inhale exhale,

29:04.400 --> 29:05.980
 the so-called physiological psi.

29:05.980 --> 29:08.140
 You can incorporate an NSDR, a non-sleep deep

29:08.140 --> 29:10.100
 breast protocol, et cetera.

29:10.100 --> 29:13.500
 But understand that the energy that you experience

29:13.500 --> 29:16.460
 during stress, that sudden increase in alertness

29:16.460 --> 29:18.920
 and attention that comes from seeing something difficult,

29:18.920 --> 29:22.020
 that is a healthy hormonal system and neural system

29:22.020 --> 29:22.860
 that's working.

29:22.860 --> 29:25.720
 And the reason it works is that cortisol,

29:25.720 --> 29:27.480
 when it's released into the bloodstream,

29:27.480 --> 29:30.920
 it actually can bind to receptors in the brain.

29:30.920 --> 29:33.340
 It can bind receptors in the amygdala, fear centers

29:33.340 --> 29:34.340
 and threat detection centers,

29:34.340 --> 29:37.320
 but also areas of the brain that are involved in learning

29:37.320 --> 29:39.340
 and memory and neuroplasticity.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.540
 And this is why I say that neuroplasticity,

29:41.540 --> 29:42.900
 the brain's ability to change itself

29:42.900 --> 29:47.380
 in response to experience is first stimulated

29:47.380 --> 29:48.980
 by attention and focus

29:48.980 --> 29:52.020
 and often a low level state of agitation.

29:52.020 --> 29:56.300
 So understand that, and you won't be quite so troubled

29:56.300 --> 29:58.060
 about the little stress increases

29:58.060 --> 30:00.100
 that you experience throughout the day.

30:00.100 --> 30:03.640
 Now, there are ways to leverage stress,

30:03.640 --> 30:06.180
 epinephrine and cortisol in ways that serve you

30:06.180 --> 30:08.020
 and to do it in a deliberate way.

30:08.020 --> 30:10.300
 There are also ways to do that

30:10.300 --> 30:13.060
 that increase your level of stress threshold,

30:13.060 --> 30:15.920
 meaning they make it less likely

30:15.920 --> 30:18.940
 that epinephrine and cortisol will be released.

30:18.940 --> 30:21.140
 So I want to talk about the science of those practices

30:21.140 --> 30:23.440
 because I get asked about these practices a lot,

30:23.440 --> 30:25.220
 things like Wim Hof breathing,

30:25.220 --> 30:26.980
 which is also called Tummo breathing,

30:26.980 --> 30:28.300
 things like ice baths,

30:28.300 --> 30:31.120
 things like high intensity interval training.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.860
 All of those things have utility.

30:34.760 --> 30:36.820
 The question is how you use them

30:36.820 --> 30:39.100
 and how often you use them.

30:39.100 --> 30:43.500
 Those tools, just like stress from a life event

30:43.500 --> 30:46.300
 can either enhance your immunity or deplete it.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.980
 That's right, those same practices of ice baths,

30:48.980 --> 30:51.500
 Tummo breathing, high intensity interval training

30:51.500 --> 30:53.960
 or training of any kind can deplete your immune system

30:53.960 --> 30:56.420
 or it can improve them.

30:56.420 --> 30:58.160
 Excuse me, they can improve it,

30:58.160 --> 31:00.980
 meaning they can improve your immune system.

31:00.980 --> 31:04.220
 The key is how often you use them and when.

31:04.220 --> 31:05.860
 And so I want to review that now

31:05.860 --> 31:08.040
 in light of the scientific literature,

31:08.040 --> 31:08.960
 because in doing that,

31:08.960 --> 31:11.340
 you can build practices into your daily

31:11.340 --> 31:13.180
 or maybe every other day routine

31:13.180 --> 31:14.860
 that can really help buffer you

31:14.860 --> 31:18.940
 against unhealthy levels of cortisol and epinephrine,

31:18.940 --> 31:21.580
 meaning cortisol increases that are much too great

31:21.580 --> 31:23.300
 or that last much too long.

31:23.300 --> 31:25.580
 Epinephrine increases that are much too great

31:25.580 --> 31:27.320
 or that last much too long.

31:27.320 --> 31:30.460
 And of course, we'll talk about all the negatives

31:30.460 --> 31:32.340
 that go along with having too much cortisol,

31:32.340 --> 31:34.220
 too much epinephrine for too long,

31:34.220 --> 31:35.660
 but you hear about those a lot.

31:35.660 --> 31:36.760
 You hear about Cushing syndrome,

31:36.760 --> 31:39.260
 you hear about abdominal fat accumulation,

31:39.260 --> 31:40.780
 you hear about sleep disturbances.

31:40.780 --> 31:42.780
 I want to arm you with the tools first

31:42.780 --> 31:45.580
 and then we can talk about the dark side

31:45.580 --> 31:46.480
 and all the things that hopefully

31:46.480 --> 31:48.180
 you'll be able to avoid entirely

31:48.180 --> 31:49.400
 or that you can get yourself out of

31:49.400 --> 31:51.400
 once you have the tools in hand.

31:51.400 --> 31:54.340
 Let's say somebody tells you something very troubling

31:54.340 --> 31:56.540
 or you look at your phone and you see a text message

31:56.540 --> 31:58.200
 that's really upsetting to you.

31:58.200 --> 32:01.300
 That will cause an immediate increase

32:01.300 --> 32:05.280
 in epinephrine, adrenaline in your brain and body.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.260
 And chances are it's going to increase

32:07.260 --> 32:08.860
 your levels of cortisol as well.

32:09.960 --> 32:13.480
 Let's say you get into an ice bath or a cold shower.

32:13.480 --> 32:17.160
 Even if you love the cold or if you hate the cold,

32:17.160 --> 32:19.960
 that will cause an equivalent increase

32:19.960 --> 32:22.280
 in epinephrine and cortisol.

32:22.280 --> 32:23.560
 We don't know the exact levels,

32:23.560 --> 32:25.660
 but it's probably about the same.

32:25.660 --> 32:27.840
 Let's say you go out for high intensity interval training.

32:27.840 --> 32:29.800
 You decide you're going to run some sprints.

32:29.800 --> 32:31.200
 You can do some repeats

32:31.200 --> 32:33.360
 or you're going to do some weightlifting in the gym

32:33.360 --> 32:35.640
 and you love lifting weights in the gym.

32:35.640 --> 32:37.380
 Maybe you're like the powerlifting thing

32:37.380 --> 32:39.880
 or you decide that you want to do some hot yoga

32:39.880 --> 32:43.560
 or something that you really enjoy or you hate.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.400
 You're going to increase your epinephrine

32:46.400 --> 32:47.600
 and cortisol levels.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.460
 There's simply no way around this.

32:50.320 --> 32:51.800
 Let's say you decide to sit down

32:51.800 --> 32:53.880
 and you're going to do some deep breathing.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.720
 We all hear about the benefits of deep breathing.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.940
 So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.

32:57.940 --> 32:59.760
 You're going to get big increases

32:59.760 --> 33:01.880
 in epinephrine and cortisol.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.480
 The data from multiple studies support this.

33:05.480 --> 33:09.840
 All of those are stressors in air quotes.

33:09.840 --> 33:13.340
 Now there is a way that you can cognitively reframe

33:13.340 --> 33:14.180
 what those are.

33:14.180 --> 33:15.000
 You can tell yourself,

33:15.000 --> 33:16.240
 I love high intensity interval training

33:16.240 --> 33:19.760
 or I love weight training or I personally love exercise.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.600
 I'm not crazy about the cold.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.840
 I do some cold exposure stuff now and again

33:23.840 --> 33:25.600
 and we're going to talk a lot about how to do that

33:25.600 --> 33:28.960
 in the optimal way in an upcoming episode.

33:28.960 --> 33:32.160
 But getting into the cold doesn't feel good to me.

33:32.160 --> 33:35.640
 I tell myself it's good for me and I enjoy it

33:35.640 --> 33:38.520
 at some point usually when I'm getting out.

33:38.520 --> 33:41.040
 All of those increase epinephrine and guess what?

33:41.040 --> 33:44.200
 They increase your levels of energy and alertness.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.060
 So if you're somebody who struggles

33:46.060 --> 33:49.700
 with energy and alertness, it can be beneficial

33:49.700 --> 33:51.420
 provided you get clearance from your doctor

33:51.420 --> 33:54.260
 to have some sort of protocol built into your day

33:54.260 --> 33:58.280
 where you deliberately increase your levels of epinephrine

33:58.280 --> 33:59.700
 and your levels of cortisol.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.280
 And I want to put the emphasis on deliberately.

34:03.280 --> 34:04.700
 So how would you do that?

34:04.700 --> 34:08.100
 Well, it's quite easy to turn the shower cold

34:08.100 --> 34:08.940
 and get into that.

34:08.940 --> 34:11.400
 That will wake you up and it literally wakes you up

34:11.400 --> 34:13.160
 because of increases in epinephrine.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.600
 You can do deep breathing of the sort

34:15.600 --> 34:19.880
 where you inhale and exhale repeatedly 25 or 30 times,

34:19.880 --> 34:22.600
 maybe hold your breath for a few seconds on an exhale

34:22.600 --> 34:25.280
 and then repeat so-called Wim Hof or Tummo type breathing.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.520
 Lots of adrenaline is released into your system.

34:27.520 --> 34:30.840
 When you do that, you will have more energy afterwards.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.720
 So it's really important to understand

34:32.720 --> 34:34.660
 that the body doesn't distinguish

34:34.660 --> 34:38.920
 between a troubling text message, ice, Tummo breathing

34:38.920 --> 34:40.200
 or high intensity interval training

34:40.200 --> 34:41.520
 or any other kind of exercise.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.920
 It's all stress.

34:43.800 --> 34:46.360
 Cognitively reframing that and telling yourself,

34:46.360 --> 34:49.480
 I like this, I enjoy it is not going to change

34:49.480 --> 34:53.160
 the way that that molecule impacts your body and brain.

34:53.160 --> 34:56.700
 I sort of chuckle because people would love to tell you

34:56.700 --> 34:58.880
 that all you have to do is say, oh, this is good for me.

34:58.880 --> 35:03.100
 No, what it does to tell yourself that it's good for you

35:03.100 --> 35:06.360
 or that you enjoy it is that it liberates other molecules

35:06.360 --> 35:08.680
 like dopamine and serotonin

35:08.680 --> 35:12.040
 that help buffer the epinephrine response.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.440
 Now, the way that it does that,

35:13.440 --> 35:14.840
 I've talked about previous episode,

35:14.840 --> 35:17.000
 but I'll just mention that dopamine

35:17.000 --> 35:19.080
 is the precursor to epinephrine.

35:19.080 --> 35:22.440
 Epinephrine, adrenaline is made from dopamine.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.500
 Cortisol is made from cholesterol.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.920
 Epinephrine is made from dopamine.

35:28.920 --> 35:30.400
 And that's why if you tell yourself

35:30.400 --> 35:32.180
 you're enjoying something

35:32.180 --> 35:34.080
 and because dopamine is so subjective

35:34.080 --> 35:36.120
 that you can in some ways,

35:36.120 --> 35:37.880
 as long as you're not completely lying to yourself,

35:37.880 --> 35:41.680
 you can get more epinephrine, you get more mileage

35:41.680 --> 35:44.320
 or more ability to push through something

35:44.320 --> 35:46.000
 and you can sort of reframe it,

35:46.000 --> 35:47.800
 but it's not really cognitive reframing.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.480
 The cognitive part is the trigger,

35:49.480 --> 35:51.960
 but it's a chemical substance

35:51.960 --> 35:53.300
 that's actually occurring there.

35:53.300 --> 35:56.800
 It's dopamine giving you more epinephrine,

35:56.800 --> 35:59.400
 a bigger amplitude epinephrine release,

35:59.400 --> 36:02.120
 and it gives you some sense of control.

36:02.120 --> 36:05.520
 So here's a protocol that anyone can use

36:05.520 --> 36:07.280
 if you want to increase levels of energy,

36:07.280 --> 36:10.520
 if you suffer from low energy during the daytime

36:10.520 --> 36:13.360
 or whenever it is that you'd like to be alert.

36:13.360 --> 36:16.360
 Pick a practice that you can do fairly consistently,

36:16.360 --> 36:17.660
 maybe every day,

36:17.660 --> 36:20.280
 but maybe every third day or every fourth day,

36:20.280 --> 36:22.760
 maybe it's an ice bath or a cold bath,

36:22.760 --> 36:24.260
 maybe it's a cold shower,

36:24.260 --> 36:28.800
 maybe it's the cyclic inhale exhale breathing protocol

36:28.800 --> 36:30.360
 I described, if that wasn't clear

36:30.360 --> 36:31.720
 and people always ask for a demo,

36:31.720 --> 36:33.440
 I'm not going to do the whole thing right now,

36:33.440 --> 36:35.400
 but I'm willing to do a few rounds of this

36:35.400 --> 36:36.780
 or a few cycles I should say.

36:36.780 --> 36:37.740
 So it's inhale,

36:39.960 --> 36:40.960
 I would do that more deeply,

36:40.960 --> 36:45.880
 more like you do that 25, 30 times repeatedly,

36:45.880 --> 36:47.480
 you will start to feel warm,

36:47.480 --> 36:48.840
 people in the yoga community,

36:48.840 --> 36:49.960
 they say you're generating heat,

36:49.960 --> 36:52.400
 you're not generating heat, releasing adrenaline.

36:54.160 --> 36:55.840
 Inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,

36:55.840 --> 36:59.600
 25 or 30 times, you will feel agitated and stressed,

36:59.600 --> 37:02.260
 that's because you're releasing adrenaline in your body

37:02.260 --> 37:04.520
 and that's because you're releasing norepinephrine

37:04.520 --> 37:07.800
 in your brain and you'll be more alert.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.240
 Then you can follow that 25 or 30 breath cycles

37:10.240 --> 37:11.520
 with an exhale hold

37:12.560 --> 37:14.840
 and hold your breath for 15 to 30 seconds.

37:14.840 --> 37:17.860
 Always, always, always do this on dry land,

37:17.860 --> 37:19.880
 never while driving, operating heavy machinery,

37:19.880 --> 37:22.800
 all of the standard safety protocols, never near water,

37:22.800 --> 37:26.120
 please, people have passed out and died doing this

37:26.120 --> 37:27.680
 with breath holds in water,

37:27.680 --> 37:29.680
 there are several deaths associated with it,

37:29.680 --> 37:32.040
 on land it's probably safer, clear it with your doctor,

37:32.040 --> 37:34.580
 but 25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold,

37:34.580 --> 37:37.000
 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold,

37:37.000 --> 37:39.980
 25, 30 breaths again, exhale, hold,

37:39.980 --> 37:42.640
 and then if you like, you can do an inhale and hold

37:42.640 --> 37:45.300
 if that's within your margins of safety.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.960
 So if all these protocols,

37:47.960 --> 37:50.720
 all these activities are just equivalent,

37:50.720 --> 37:54.000
 they're just stress, then how do we make them good for us?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.920
 How do we actually benefit from them?

37:55.920 --> 37:57.980
 Now, of course, the cold itself

37:57.980 --> 38:00.000
 can have some health promoting effects,

38:00.000 --> 38:03.280
 it can increase brown fat thermogenesis and metabolism,

38:03.280 --> 38:06.560
 high intensity interval training or other forms of exercise

38:06.560 --> 38:10.640
 of course has cardiovascular effects that can be good for us

38:10.640 --> 38:12.340
 as does weight training, et cetera,

38:12.340 --> 38:14.080
 but what we're talking about here

38:14.080 --> 38:18.580
 are ways to increase energy and to teach our brain and body,

38:18.580 --> 38:22.080
 to teach ourselves how to regulate the stress response.

38:22.080 --> 38:25.480
 So in addition to the benefits of the actual practices,

38:25.480 --> 38:28.940
 what we're talking about is building a system

38:28.940 --> 38:31.920
 so that when you experience increases

38:31.920 --> 38:34.720
 in epinephrine and cortisol from life events,

38:34.720 --> 38:36.500
 you're able to better buffer those,

38:36.500 --> 38:38.320
 and we are also talking about

38:38.320 --> 38:41.140
 ways that you can increase energy overall,

38:41.140 --> 38:43.100
 because that's what today's episode is all about,

38:43.100 --> 38:45.100
 energy and the immune system.

38:45.100 --> 38:46.700
 And indeed, we will talk about

38:46.700 --> 38:49.080
 how you can actually leverage specific protocols

38:49.080 --> 38:51.860
 to increase your immune system on demand.

38:51.860 --> 38:54.340
 There's great scientific data to support

38:54.340 --> 38:56.340
 that one can do that.

38:56.340 --> 39:00.640
 So there's a biological mechanism that's very important

39:00.640 --> 39:02.180
 if you want to do those things,

39:02.180 --> 39:04.960
 increase energy and your immune system on demand,

39:04.960 --> 39:08.640
 learn to buffer stress on demand in real time.

39:08.640 --> 39:13.100
 And it means taking these protocols, these practices,

39:13.100 --> 39:16.740
 whether or not it's cold water or ice bath or exercise

39:16.740 --> 39:20.900
 or any of those, and making one small

39:20.900 --> 39:24.020
 but very powerful adjustment in how you perform them.

39:24.020 --> 39:25.760
 But in order to make that adjustment,

39:25.760 --> 39:27.700
 I can't just tell you the adjustment,

39:27.700 --> 39:29.180
 I have to tell you the mechanism

39:29.180 --> 39:31.720
 so that you know if you're doing it correctly or not.

39:31.720 --> 39:33.020
 This is really a case where

39:33.020 --> 39:35.780
 if you can understand a little bit of mechanism,

39:35.780 --> 39:40.780
 you will be far better off than just adopting protocols.

39:41.820 --> 39:46.140
 So if you take away nothing else from this episode,

39:46.140 --> 39:48.500
 except what I'm about to tell you,

39:48.500 --> 39:51.300
 please take away the information I'm about to tell you.

39:52.660 --> 39:55.860
 Cortisol, as I mentioned, is released from the adrenals

39:55.860 --> 39:57.660
 and it can bind to receptors,

39:57.660 --> 40:01.060
 it can have action both in the body and in the brain.

40:01.060 --> 40:02.620
 In fact, it can bind the so-called

40:02.620 --> 40:05.620
 threat detection center in the brain, or one of them,

40:05.620 --> 40:08.280
 which is the amygdala, also called the fear center.

40:09.460 --> 40:10.900
 It can do that because cortisol

40:10.900 --> 40:12.680
 can cross the blood brain barrier,

40:12.680 --> 40:13.900
 it can be released in the body

40:13.900 --> 40:16.100
 and cross this biological barrier,

40:16.100 --> 40:18.500
 it's like a fence that keeps things out of the brain,

40:18.500 --> 40:21.680
 but cortisol has passing rights, it can go through.

40:22.980 --> 40:26.620
 Epinephrine cannot, epinephrine is polarized,

40:26.620 --> 40:30.380
 the shape of it is such that it can't make it

40:30.380 --> 40:32.500
 through the blood brain barrier.

40:32.500 --> 40:34.700
 That's one of the reasons why it's released

40:34.700 --> 40:36.900
 both from the adrenals in your body

40:36.900 --> 40:39.020
 and released from this brainstem area,

40:39.020 --> 40:40.720
 the locus coeruleus in your brain.

40:42.380 --> 40:45.220
 That's a powerful thing because what it means

40:45.220 --> 40:49.860
 is that the body can enter states of readiness

40:49.860 --> 40:53.920
 and alertness while the mind remains calm,

40:53.920 --> 40:55.820
 that is biologically possible,

40:55.820 --> 40:57.780
 it's not just a psychological trick

40:58.920 --> 41:01.080
 and there are ways that one can do that.

41:01.080 --> 41:03.520
 So I'm presuming at this point

41:03.520 --> 41:05.020
 that you're getting your morning light

41:05.020 --> 41:07.420
 to time your cortisol increase.

41:07.420 --> 41:09.980
 I'm presuming that you want more energy

41:09.980 --> 41:12.500
 or that you want to increase your immune system,

41:12.500 --> 41:14.920
 its function and its ability to combat infections

41:14.920 --> 41:16.820
 of various kinds.

41:16.820 --> 41:20.300
 And what I'm suggesting is that you pick from the palette

41:20.300 --> 41:24.180
 of exercises that are out there

41:24.180 --> 41:26.940
 or tools that are out there to increase epinephrine,

41:26.940 --> 41:28.900
 there are a lot of ways to do that.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.360
 You can do that as I mentioned,

41:30.360 --> 41:32.200
 through cold water, through exercise,

41:32.200 --> 41:34.860
 you can even do that by having confrontations

41:34.860 --> 41:35.800
 with other people.

41:36.740 --> 41:39.360
 At a biological level, it is identical.

41:39.360 --> 41:42.500
 So if you like to go online and place the kind of comments

41:42.500 --> 41:44.180
 that will read the kinds of things

41:44.180 --> 41:46.820
 or look at the kinds of things that agitate you,

41:46.820 --> 41:49.260
 you can, if you like, look at that as an opportunity.

41:49.260 --> 41:50.540
 I'm not suggesting you do that,

41:50.540 --> 41:52.780
 I'd like to see people taking care of themselves

41:52.780 --> 41:56.140
 and each other in much less destructive ways, frankly,

41:56.140 --> 42:01.140
 but the prerequisite here is getting an increase

42:01.140 --> 42:04.300
 in adrenaline released from the body.

42:04.300 --> 42:07.860
 Now, the simplest way to describe how to do that

42:07.860 --> 42:09.640
 would be in the context of cold water

42:09.640 --> 42:10.940
 or a breathing protocol,

42:10.940 --> 42:12.340
 because then I don't have to deal

42:12.340 --> 42:15.900
 with the unknown life circumstances that get you triggered

42:15.900 --> 42:17.820
 or I could tell you what gets me triggered,

42:17.820 --> 42:19.060
 but I'm not going to.

42:19.060 --> 42:21.660
 So let's presume cold water.

42:21.660 --> 42:24.340
 So let's say you decide you're going to take a cold shower.

42:24.340 --> 42:27.180
 You get into the cold shower and if it's cold enough,

42:27.180 --> 42:28.100
 that will be stressful,

42:28.100 --> 42:31.360
 you will experience an increase in epinephrine.

42:31.360 --> 42:33.540
 It will increase your alertness.

42:33.540 --> 42:36.020
 Now you're using this as a practice,

42:36.020 --> 42:38.380
 as a tool to build, you could call it resilience,

42:38.380 --> 42:40.580
 but the ability to stay calm in the mind

42:40.580 --> 42:44.020
 while being stressed in the body, epinephrines in the body.

42:44.020 --> 42:47.620
 And you do that by subjectively trying to calm yourself.

42:47.620 --> 42:50.060
 Now you can do that by telling yourself it's good for you,

42:50.060 --> 42:52.260
 by emphasizing your exhales,

42:52.260 --> 42:54.880
 anything that you can do to try and stay calm

42:54.880 --> 42:56.020
 despite the fact that you are

42:56.020 --> 42:58.500
 in a heightened state of alertness.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.920
 You do this with exercise, you could do this with music,

43:00.920 --> 43:02.540
 pretty much anything that will give you

43:02.540 --> 43:04.500
 a really heightened state of alertness

43:05.460 --> 43:08.040
 offers you the opportunity to try and stay calm in the mind.

43:08.040 --> 43:10.500
 What you're trying to do at a mechanistic level

43:11.420 --> 43:15.220
 is to have adrenaline released from the adrenals,

43:15.220 --> 43:18.100
 but not have adrenaline epinephrin released

43:18.100 --> 43:20.540
 from the brainstem to the same degree.

43:20.540 --> 43:22.120
 So you're not just trying to buffer this.

43:22.120 --> 43:23.400
 You're not trying to say, oh, this is good for me,

43:23.400 --> 43:24.940
 this is good for me, I'm going to grind this out.

43:24.940 --> 43:26.620
 You're not trying to grind it out.

43:26.620 --> 43:29.900
 You're trying to move through this calmly

43:29.900 --> 43:31.460
 while maintaining alertness.

43:31.460 --> 43:33.820
 You're not trying to zone out necessarily,

43:33.820 --> 43:35.340
 although maybe that helps.

43:35.340 --> 43:36.840
 You're not trying to distract yourself.

43:36.840 --> 43:40.820
 What you're trying to do is shift cognitively

43:40.820 --> 43:43.300
 your relationship to the somatic,

43:43.300 --> 43:45.620
 to the body stress response.

43:45.620 --> 43:47.100
 Now I'm sure some of you out there are shouting,

43:47.100 --> 43:49.840
 yeah, that's exactly like whatever, whatever, whatever.

43:49.840 --> 43:50.680
 I agree.

43:50.680 --> 43:53.660
 This is in many ways a self-directed

43:53.660 --> 43:54.900
 kind of stress inoculation,

43:54.900 --> 43:58.080
 but we're not talking about this as stress inoculation.

43:58.080 --> 43:59.820
 We're talking about this as a way

43:59.820 --> 44:03.180
 to increase energy and focus.

44:03.180 --> 44:08.060
 And the reason is that epinephrin when released in the body

44:08.060 --> 44:11.140
 has a profound effect on the immune system.

44:11.140 --> 44:14.180
 And when released in the brain has a profound effect

44:14.180 --> 44:17.180
 on the ability to learn and remember information

44:17.180 --> 44:18.380
 and to be alert.

44:18.380 --> 44:21.020
 And so we're talking about splitting the location,

44:21.020 --> 44:24.060
 separating the location from which you have

44:24.060 --> 44:26.420
 epinephrin adrenaline released, okay?

44:26.420 --> 44:30.260
 So let's say you are doing this practice simply to wake up.

44:30.260 --> 44:31.740
 Okay, cold shower, we'll do that.

44:31.740 --> 44:32.980
 Exercise, we'll do that.

44:34.360 --> 44:36.180
 The ability to stay calm in mind

44:36.180 --> 44:38.740
 while having heightened levels of adrenaline

44:38.740 --> 44:40.840
 and presumably cortisol as well in the body,

44:40.840 --> 44:43.460
 but the cortisol is going to circulate everywhere.

44:43.460 --> 44:46.160
 We'll talk a little bit about cortisol more in a moment.

44:46.160 --> 44:50.780
 You could do that through some self-soothing, calming way.

44:50.780 --> 44:53.060
 That's going to be highly individual.

44:53.060 --> 44:56.020
 You do it by telling yourself you enjoy it, et cetera.

44:56.020 --> 44:57.820
 But what you need to understand is that

44:57.820 --> 45:01.860
 in the immediate period following that practice,

45:01.860 --> 45:05.500
 your system, your entire brain and body are different.

45:05.500 --> 45:10.140
 Your body is actually primed to resist infection

45:10.140 --> 45:12.260
 when you have high levels of epinephrin in it

45:12.260 --> 45:13.820
 for short periods of time.

45:13.820 --> 45:15.740
 So the scientific study that explored

45:15.740 --> 45:18.540
 how increasing adrenaline in the body

45:18.540 --> 45:21.700
 can improve immune resistance is grounded

45:21.700 --> 45:26.380
 in a well-known phenomenon that increases in stress

45:26.380 --> 45:31.060
 actually protect you against infection in the short term.

45:31.060 --> 45:33.740
 So I want to look at the classic data first,

45:33.740 --> 45:34.900
 describe what was done,

45:34.900 --> 45:37.100
 and then I want to talk about the more recent study

45:37.100 --> 45:39.180
 which is immediately actionable.

45:39.180 --> 45:41.220
 There are classic set of studies

45:41.220 --> 45:43.000
 that are really based mainly on the work

45:43.000 --> 45:44.520
 of somebody named Bruce McEwen

45:44.520 --> 45:47.740
 who was at the Rockefeller University in New York.

45:47.740 --> 45:49.620
 Bruce passed away a few years ago,

45:49.620 --> 45:53.820
 but he had many decades of incredibly impactful work

45:53.820 --> 45:55.340
 under his belt when he did.

45:56.780 --> 45:59.180
 The work that I'm going to talk about next

45:59.180 --> 46:02.740
 has been done in humans and has been done in animals

46:02.740 --> 46:06.560
 and has really explored how inducing stress

46:06.560 --> 46:08.700
 can enhance the function of the immune system

46:08.700 --> 46:09.620
 in the short term.

46:09.620 --> 46:14.380
 And when I mean short term, I mean about one to four days.

46:14.380 --> 46:16.420
 I'm not going to go through all the details of the study,

46:16.420 --> 46:20.460
 but essentially what they were doing was exposing subjects

46:20.460 --> 46:22.940
 to some sort of infection,

46:22.940 --> 46:27.140
 either bacterial or viral infection and inducing stress.

46:27.140 --> 46:28.380
 Sounds like a double whammy, right?

46:28.380 --> 46:31.380
 You think that maybe getting a little electric foot shock

46:31.380 --> 46:33.380
 or cold water exposure

46:33.380 --> 46:35.580
 or something to increase your levels of stress

46:35.580 --> 46:38.260
 and adrenaline would just make the effects

46:38.260 --> 46:42.060
 of the infection worse, but no, quite the opposite.

46:42.060 --> 46:44.040
 Brief bouts of stress,

46:44.040 --> 46:45.640
 which now you should be thinking about

46:45.640 --> 46:48.220
 in terms of cortisol and epinephrine release,

46:48.220 --> 46:51.880
 were actually able to increase immune system function.

46:52.940 --> 46:55.140
 Now that shouldn't surprise you

46:55.140 --> 46:56.500
 if you understand a little bit

46:56.500 --> 47:00.740
 about how epinephrine works in the body and in the brain.

47:00.740 --> 47:03.260
 It essentially is the signal

47:03.260 --> 47:06.860
 by which the nervous system can inform immune organs,

47:06.860 --> 47:08.700
 things like the spleen and other organs

47:08.700 --> 47:10.900
 that make killer cells of various kinds,

47:10.900 --> 47:12.640
 B cells and T cells,

47:12.640 --> 47:16.300
 to go and combat infections, bacteria and viruses.

47:16.300 --> 47:18.020
 How else would your immune system know

47:18.020 --> 47:19.380
 that there was an infection?

47:19.380 --> 47:22.060
 Your immune system can recognize foreign invaders,

47:22.060 --> 47:25.300
 but the nervous system provides the signal,

47:25.300 --> 47:28.420
 the sort of alarm signal that liberates the killer cells,

47:28.420 --> 47:30.060
 that tells them there's a problem

47:30.060 --> 47:33.120
 and to go seek out the problem, so to speak.

47:33.120 --> 47:36.780
 So the duration here is really important

47:36.780 --> 47:39.780
 because if stress stayed too high for too long,

47:39.780 --> 47:44.780
 then yes, indeed, stress can hinder the immune response,

47:44.940 --> 47:47.340
 but for a period of about one to four days,

47:47.340 --> 47:49.100
 it actually can protect you

47:49.100 --> 47:52.280
 by way of increasing the immune response.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.980
 Now, I can say with certainty

47:54.980 --> 47:58.420
 that that effect is governed by epinephrine,

47:58.420 --> 48:02.260
 adrenaline released from the adrenals and not from the brain

48:02.260 --> 48:04.380
 because they actually explored

48:04.380 --> 48:06.220
 whether or not the effect exists

48:06.220 --> 48:09.760
 in the presence of what's called an adrenalectomy

48:09.760 --> 48:12.260
 or removing the adrenals.

48:12.260 --> 48:13.860
 So I should just say without the adrenals,

48:13.860 --> 48:14.780
 you don't get the effect.

48:14.780 --> 48:16.660
 So we know that that effect comes from adrenaline

48:16.660 --> 48:17.720
 in the body.

48:17.720 --> 48:18.800
 What does that mean for you?

48:18.800 --> 48:21.840
 That means if you want to increase your immune system

48:21.840 --> 48:22.820
 in the short term,

48:23.800 --> 48:27.080
 you want to increase your epinephrine in the short term.

48:27.080 --> 48:30.300
 That's why short bouts of very intense exercise,

48:30.300 --> 48:32.420
 probably no more than an hour per day,

48:32.420 --> 48:33.880
 provided you're doing everything else right,

48:33.880 --> 48:36.100
 sleeping and nutrition, et cetera,

48:36.100 --> 48:38.800
 maybe even shorter bouts of intense exercise

48:38.800 --> 48:41.160
 or exposure to cold water

48:41.160 --> 48:44.680
 or the cyclic breathing that I talked about before.

48:44.680 --> 48:46.740
 Because they increase epinephrine,

48:46.740 --> 48:49.140
 they will bolster the immune system.

48:49.140 --> 48:51.980
 And we all hear these reports every once in a while.

48:51.980 --> 48:53.980
 It seems to be the thing that every once in a while,

48:53.980 --> 48:55.700
 there'll be an article about how coffee

48:55.700 --> 48:57.580
 can improve your immune system or something like that.

48:57.580 --> 49:00.020
 Indeed, caffeine can increase epinephrine

49:00.020 --> 49:02.060
 and dopamine to some extent,

49:02.060 --> 49:04.820
 but most people are drinking it chronically.

49:04.820 --> 49:09.100
 So its effects are probably due to increases in epinephrine

49:09.100 --> 49:11.500
 and probably whether or not something like coffee

49:11.500 --> 49:13.300
 or other forms of caffeine can improve

49:13.300 --> 49:14.820
 or degrade your immune system

49:14.820 --> 49:16.500
 will probably depend on whether or not

49:16.500 --> 49:19.020
 you're using it in a way that it increases your adrenaline

49:19.020 --> 49:21.500
 as a spike that happens rarely.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.960
 Once every two or three months,

49:23.960 --> 49:25.400
 let's say you have an infection coming on.

49:25.400 --> 49:28.180
 Yes, indeed, what these data probably mean

49:28.180 --> 49:30.920
 is that drinking some hot caffeinated tea

49:30.920 --> 49:34.900
 or some hot coffee even provided you don't get dehydrated

49:34.900 --> 49:37.120
 from it because you're also drinking some water

49:37.120 --> 49:39.340
 can probably improve your immune system function

49:39.340 --> 49:41.940
 by way of increasing adrenaline release.

49:41.940 --> 49:44.780
 But so can the breathing, so can cold exposure,

49:44.780 --> 49:46.940
 so can exercise.

49:46.940 --> 49:48.620
 The mechanism here is what's key.

49:48.620 --> 49:51.500
 And I keep saying that because what it means

49:51.500 --> 49:53.260
 is that you don't actually have to know

49:53.260 --> 49:54.580
 the specific protocol.

49:54.580 --> 49:57.740
 I'm not trying to say, do this particular protocol.

49:57.740 --> 50:00.540
 You have to figure out, and it should be easy to figure out

50:00.540 --> 50:04.180
 what short-term adrenaline increasing behavior

50:04.180 --> 50:06.900
 you're willing to do on a regular basis every day

50:06.900 --> 50:08.340
 or two or three times a week.

50:08.340 --> 50:10.400
 Now you could say, well, I'm not sick.

50:10.400 --> 50:13.420
 Should I be doing these things often?

50:13.420 --> 50:16.580
 I would say two or three times a week at a minimum,

50:16.580 --> 50:19.140
 if your goal is to keep your immune system tuned up

50:19.140 --> 50:22.420
 and you are in the presence of a lot of children,

50:22.420 --> 50:25.100
 for instance, which carry a lot of bugs

50:25.100 --> 50:26.960
 because their immune system isn't developed,

50:26.960 --> 50:30.160
 or you work in a healthcare setting,

50:30.160 --> 50:33.700
 or you're simply somebody who's prone to get sick.

50:33.700 --> 50:35.580
 I can just say anecdotally,

50:35.580 --> 50:37.700
 I guess someone now calls this anecdata,

50:37.700 --> 50:40.500
 which I don't like that phrase because it's sort of,

50:40.500 --> 50:43.820
 I don't want anecdotal data to ever be misunderstood

50:43.820 --> 50:45.600
 as anything but anecdotal data.

50:46.780 --> 50:49.980
 Anecdotally, I can say that I've had instances

50:49.980 --> 50:52.540
 where I've felt a throat tickle coming on

50:52.540 --> 50:54.020
 or some sinus infection.

50:54.020 --> 50:57.100
 I will do the cyclic breathing that I described before,

50:57.100 --> 50:59.420
 25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold, 25, 30 breaths,

50:59.420 --> 51:01.420
 exhale, hold, 25, 30 breaths, exhale, hold,

51:01.420 --> 51:02.860
 and then big inhale, hold.

51:02.860 --> 51:05.660
 And most times I didn't get full-blown sick,

51:05.660 --> 51:07.700
 but I also take other precautionary measures

51:07.700 --> 51:09.960
 to get sleep, et cetera.

51:09.960 --> 51:12.100
 So whether or not it was causal

51:12.100 --> 51:14.580
 or whether or not it's just correlated, I don't know.

51:14.580 --> 51:16.420
 However, there's a human study

51:16.420 --> 51:18.780
 that I definitely want to point out to you

51:18.780 --> 51:21.220
 because it was published more recently

51:21.220 --> 51:22.140
 than the McEwen work.

51:22.140 --> 51:23.540
 It was published in the Proceedings

51:23.540 --> 51:26.380
 of the National Academy of Sciences for the USA

51:26.380 --> 51:28.140
 because they're Proceedings of the National Academy

51:28.140 --> 51:30.420
 of Sciences for many other countries as well.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.740
 The title of the paper is voluntary activation

51:32.740 --> 51:34.240
 of the sympathetic nervous system.

51:34.240 --> 51:36.200
 That's the system that causes fight or flight

51:36.200 --> 51:39.620
 and AK stress and causes release of adrenaline

51:39.620 --> 51:43.660
 and attenuation of the innate immune response in humans.

51:43.660 --> 51:48.180
 This is Cox, K-O-X et al, P-N-A-S,

51:48.180 --> 51:50.860
 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2014.

51:50.860 --> 51:53.900
 And they incorporate the ever famous Wim Hof breathing.

51:53.900 --> 51:57.220
 Wim Hof breathing is much like the breathing protocol

51:57.220 --> 52:00.140
 that I've described several times now in this podcast.

52:00.140 --> 52:02.220
 It's also called Tummo breathing.

52:02.220 --> 52:05.220
 Other people from other cultures and communities

52:05.220 --> 52:06.300
 have called it other things.

52:06.300 --> 52:08.440
 The naming really isn't important.

52:08.440 --> 52:10.060
 Although I do think Wim is a pioneer

52:10.060 --> 52:11.780
 in trying to bring these practices

52:11.780 --> 52:13.540
 to the general public more broadly

52:13.540 --> 52:15.480
 and was involved in this study.

52:16.660 --> 52:18.500
 The study was done in the Netherlands.

52:18.500 --> 52:22.780
 It was communicated by Dr. Thomas Horvath at Yale.

52:22.780 --> 52:24.180
 I mentioned all that.

52:24.180 --> 52:26.740
 Horvath is a terrific scientist.

52:26.740 --> 52:29.380
 I'm familiar with his work over many years.

52:29.380 --> 52:30.480
 Here's what they did.

52:31.500 --> 52:36.500
 They injected people with E. coli

52:36.500 --> 52:40.740
 and they had groups that either did the sorts of breathing

52:40.740 --> 52:44.020
 I've been describing that increase adrenaline release.

52:44.020 --> 52:47.540
 Although I should say, I don't think you need that breathing

52:47.540 --> 52:48.620
 to get adrenaline release.

52:48.620 --> 52:49.940
 You could do it with cold exposure.

52:49.940 --> 52:51.820
 You could do it with other things,

52:51.820 --> 52:53.780
 high intensity interval training as well.

52:53.780 --> 52:58.780
 And what they found was that the response to the E. coli

53:00.240 --> 53:03.700
 was quite different in the people that had a protocol,

53:03.700 --> 53:06.580
 in this case, breathing to increase adrenaline.

53:06.580 --> 53:09.540
 So this is a remarkable study

53:09.540 --> 53:12.060
 because what they found was that the fever, the vomiting,

53:12.060 --> 53:15.940
 all the negative effects of E. coli,

53:15.940 --> 53:18.300
 many of them and in some cases, all of them

53:18.300 --> 53:20.620
 were greatly attenuated

53:20.620 --> 53:24.020
 by way of engaging the adrenaline system,

53:24.020 --> 53:26.040
 in this case, using breathing.

53:26.040 --> 53:29.660
 They looked at inflammatory cytokines, things like IL-6,

53:29.660 --> 53:31.420
 which I've mentioned many times on this podcast,

53:31.420 --> 53:33.820
 the sort of classic inflammatory cytokine were reduced.

53:33.820 --> 53:36.460
 Things like IL-10, which are anti-inflammatory

53:36.460 --> 53:37.340
 were increased.

53:37.340 --> 53:40.240
 There were some inflammatory cytokines that were increased.

53:41.480 --> 53:42.320
 What's the point here?

53:42.320 --> 53:45.140
 The point is you can control your immune system

53:45.140 --> 53:49.060
 by finding a way that you can increase adrenaline.

53:49.060 --> 53:51.580
 And this runs counter to what we always hear,

53:51.580 --> 53:54.740
 which is don't get too stressed or you will get sick.

53:54.740 --> 53:58.520
 Learn to control adrenaline, turn it on and turn it off.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.020
 Learn to control cortisol,

54:00.020 --> 54:02.740
 turn it on with light in the morning, try and turn it off.

54:02.740 --> 54:05.660
 And then when it spikes because of life events,

54:05.660 --> 54:06.860
 learn to turn it off.

54:07.840 --> 54:11.160
 Learning to turn on and off adrenaline,

54:11.160 --> 54:16.160
 AKA epinephrine and learning to turn on and off cortisol

54:16.160 --> 54:20.160
 affords you the ability to turn on energy and focus

54:20.160 --> 54:21.300
 and your immune system.

54:22.280 --> 54:24.580
 That's the most important point from today's podcast

54:24.580 --> 54:27.600
 and understanding that it doesn't matter

54:27.600 --> 54:28.960
 what protocol you use.

54:28.960 --> 54:31.000
 Maybe it's a cup of coffee and running up a hill

54:31.000 --> 54:31.960
 five or six times.

54:31.960 --> 54:33.640
 That will improve your immune system function

54:33.640 --> 54:36.200
 if you get adrenaline in your system.

54:36.200 --> 54:38.300
 You can use an ice bath, you can use a cold bath.

54:38.300 --> 54:40.440
 It really doesn't matter.

54:40.440 --> 54:41.440
 You can get into an argument,

54:41.440 --> 54:42.840
 but I'm not suggesting you do that.

54:42.840 --> 54:44.480
 It really doesn't matter.

54:44.480 --> 54:46.880
 What's important is that you're able to then shut off

54:46.880 --> 54:49.000
 that response and there are ways to do that

54:49.000 --> 54:50.440
 we will talk about, but I want to talk about

54:50.440 --> 54:54.640
 some of the other benefits of epinephrine and cortisol

54:54.640 --> 54:57.520
 that occur because of their actions on the brain,

54:57.520 --> 55:00.100
 because these are many and they are powerful

55:00.100 --> 55:03.560
 and they relate to energy, but also the ability to learn.

55:03.560 --> 55:05.960
 If I haven't already convinced you that seeing light

55:05.960 --> 55:09.240
 early in the day is good for timing your cortisol,

55:09.240 --> 55:11.520
 I should also mention that another hormone

55:11.520 --> 55:15.260
 that I discussed last episode, which is thyroid hormone,

55:15.260 --> 55:18.560
 and it's critical for setting your level of metabolism

55:18.560 --> 55:23.560
 is controlled in part by these circadian mechanisms

55:24.060 --> 55:26.200
 and cortisol itself.

55:27.380 --> 55:31.720
 The short takeaway on this is that if you get your cortisol

55:31.720 --> 55:33.360
 release early in the day,

55:33.360 --> 55:35.480
 it will increase your energy throughout the day.

55:35.480 --> 55:39.580
 It will also time your thyroid release properly.

55:39.580 --> 55:43.180
 So there's yet another reason why you would want to get

55:43.180 --> 55:45.280
 that light exposure early in the day.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.980
 For me, that's a non-negotiable practice.

55:47.980 --> 55:51.040
 If I'm on a plane, I'll try and get it any way I can.

55:51.040 --> 55:53.700
 I'm not shining flashlights in my eyes yet,

55:53.700 --> 55:57.500
 but I really try hard to get that light exposure

55:57.500 --> 56:01.420
 from sunlight early in the day without fail.

56:01.420 --> 56:04.580
 And the thyroid increase has to do with the fact

56:04.580 --> 56:08.280
 that your circadian clock itself is regulated by cortisol

56:08.280 --> 56:10.600
 and the circadian clock times the release

56:10.600 --> 56:11.920
 of thyroid hormone.

56:11.920 --> 56:14.720
 I don't want to go too far off in that direction,

56:14.720 --> 56:16.720
 but there are a number of studies,

56:18.240 --> 56:23.240
 Kalsbeek et al, K-A-L-S-B-E-E-K et al, 2012,

56:25.240 --> 56:28.300
 if you want to look it up on PubMed is a great one

56:28.300 --> 56:31.160
 that describes how cortisol secretion begins to rise

56:31.160 --> 56:34.380
 during sleep and peaks shortly after waking

56:34.380 --> 56:36.560
 or immediately before.

56:36.560 --> 56:41.560
 And that times a set of neurons in the circadian clock

56:43.220 --> 56:45.640
 that then trigger the release of the releasing

56:45.640 --> 56:47.900
 and stimulating hormones for thyroid.

56:47.900 --> 56:52.120
 So a really important mechanism and thyroid will also tend

56:52.120 --> 56:54.440
 to correlate with energy, but mostly metabolism.

56:54.440 --> 56:56.420
 Very important to have thyroid in check.

56:56.420 --> 56:58.400
 Now let's talk about epinephrine and cortisol

56:58.400 --> 56:59.780
 and learning and memory.

57:01.500 --> 57:03.720
 Everyone has a story about being so stressed

57:03.720 --> 57:05.920
 they couldn't remember something,

57:05.920 --> 57:08.220
 sit down to an exam, actually had this happen once,

57:08.220 --> 57:12.340
 sat down to an exam and just blanked, just blanked.

57:12.340 --> 57:14.960
 It only happened once, I don't know what happened.

57:14.960 --> 57:16.320
 I don't think it was sleep deprivation,

57:16.320 --> 57:18.440
 but I just completely blanked.

57:18.440 --> 57:20.920
 And it was very hard for me to pull myself

57:20.920 --> 57:22.040
 out of that ditch.

57:22.040 --> 57:25.200
 I did manage to do it, but it was a scary experience.

57:25.200 --> 57:27.320
 So I think most people think about stress

57:27.320 --> 57:29.320
 and an inability to perform.

57:29.320 --> 57:33.960
 However, most of the time increases in epinephrine

57:33.960 --> 57:36.980
 provided they are not through the roof

57:36.980 --> 57:39.080
 lead to improved performance.

57:39.080 --> 57:42.520
 Now this has been shown over and over again on memory tests,

57:42.520 --> 57:47.520
 on learning new information, on physical performance,

57:47.600 --> 57:50.340
 that when blood levels of epinephrine are low,

57:51.400 --> 57:52.920
 you don't perform very well.

57:53.960 --> 57:56.720
 When blood levels of epinephrine are very high,

57:56.720 --> 58:01.200
 up to about 1500 to 1700 picograms per mil,

58:01.200 --> 58:03.600
 if anyone's out there who's actually measuring this stuff,

58:03.600 --> 58:07.600
 but I doubt you are, performance goes way up.

58:07.600 --> 58:10.200
 Performance gets better when you are alert

58:10.200 --> 58:12.040
 and when you're a little bit stressed.

58:13.160 --> 58:16.300
 Absolutely shown again and again and again.

58:16.300 --> 58:19.720
 If you get too stressed, it's the mental side,

58:19.720 --> 58:22.000
 it's the epinephrine in the brain that causes people

58:22.000 --> 58:24.560
 to either focus on their somatic response too much,

58:24.560 --> 58:25.740
 like they feel like they're sweating

58:25.740 --> 58:27.560
 and they're focused on their bodily response

58:27.560 --> 58:29.320
 and they're not focused on what it is they're trying to do

58:29.320 --> 58:32.480
 or say or perform, et cetera, or learn.

58:32.480 --> 58:36.120
 But epinephrine is a nootropic,

58:36.120 --> 58:39.480
 it is a smart drug that we all make internally.

58:39.480 --> 58:42.040
 And cortisol is as well.

58:42.040 --> 58:43.600
 Now here's the twist.

58:44.760 --> 58:49.180
 That does not mean that you want epinephrine high

58:49.180 --> 58:51.620
 during the exam necessarily.

58:53.800 --> 58:58.560
 Memory and learning and performance are actually favored,

58:58.560 --> 59:02.160
 they are enhanced by epinephrine increases

59:02.160 --> 59:04.800
 immediately after learning.

59:04.800 --> 59:06.960
 And that's something that's rarely discussed,

59:06.960 --> 59:08.760
 the timing is vital.

59:08.760 --> 59:11.760
 So if you learn some information, you have a conversation,

59:11.760 --> 59:15.040
 you're trying to learn a new language, a new motor skill,

59:15.040 --> 59:18.040
 whatever it is that you're trying to learn,

59:18.040 --> 59:22.480
 the increase in epinephrine that occurs just afterward

59:22.480 --> 59:25.520
 is what's going to consolidate the information.

59:25.520 --> 59:28.380
 It's going to ensure that the proper circuits and mechanisms

59:28.380 --> 59:31.160
 in the brain for neuroplasticity are engaged during sleep

59:31.160 --> 59:32.440
 later that night or the next night,

59:32.440 --> 59:34.600
 which is when the real rewiring occurs.

59:34.600 --> 59:37.380
 And you might say, that's crazy, why would that happen?

59:37.380 --> 59:40.940
 Well, we have to remember none of these mechanisms evolved

59:40.940 --> 59:44.260
 for us to do what we want and learn what we want necessarily

59:44.260 --> 59:46.940
 although they will allow us to do that.

59:46.940 --> 59:49.140
 We've experienced this before.

59:49.140 --> 59:53.080
 We might have gotten up, gone outside, get in our car,

59:53.080 --> 59:54.980
 drive to work or to somebody's house,

59:54.980 --> 59:56.500
 you're not thinking about much at all.

59:56.500 --> 59:59.160
 And then all of a sudden you see an accident on the road.

59:59.160 --> 1:00:01.520
 Your alertness is primed

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:04.720
 if it happens to be a particularly gory accident,

1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:08.080
 there's going to be a lot of sensory information there.

1:00:08.080 --> 1:00:09.760
 All of a sudden adrenaline epinephrine

1:00:09.760 --> 1:00:12.180
 is released into your brain and body.

1:00:12.180 --> 1:00:13.120
 Guess what?

1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:15.780
 Not only will you not forget that event,

1:00:15.780 --> 1:00:18.640
 but you will remember everything that led up to that event,

1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:20.980
 which has an adaptive function

1:00:20.980 --> 1:00:25.280
 because your brain and body's primary concern is safety.

1:00:25.280 --> 1:00:27.320
 This is the neurobiological explanation

1:00:27.320 --> 1:00:30.860
 for Maslow's hierarchy of needs is safety first.

1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:32.880
 And so you have heightened awareness and alertness

1:00:32.880 --> 1:00:34.480
 for everything that preceded

1:00:35.380 --> 1:00:39.000
 that spike in adrenaline and cortisol.

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.220
 So the way to think about this is

1:00:41.220 --> 1:00:43.120
 if you need to learn something better,

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:45.520
 if you're taking Adderall

1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:47.520
 or you're taking a lot of coffee beforehand,

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:51.480
 you're actually driving the process in the wrong direction.

1:00:51.480 --> 1:00:54.000
 You're increasing epinephrine for learning, sure,

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:54.980
 but past a certain point,

1:00:54.980 --> 1:00:57.860
 you're actually degrading learning and performance.

1:00:57.860 --> 1:01:00.480
 The time to do that is toward the end

1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:02.400
 or immediately after the learning

1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:05.160
 because this mechanism is not simply devoted

1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:08.940
 to negative events like a car crash or a trauma.

1:01:08.940 --> 1:01:11.480
 It works to make sure that the hippocampus

1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:13.160
 that encodes memories

1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:16.420
 as part of the memory encoding mechanisms

1:01:16.420 --> 1:01:18.880
 is primed that it's told

1:01:18.880 --> 1:01:20.600
 what you just experienced is important.

1:01:20.600 --> 1:01:23.520
 You're going to need that information later.

1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:25.200
 And so I've talked many times before

1:01:25.200 --> 1:01:28.080
 about using non-sleep deep rest,

1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:31.400
 NSDR or ensuring good night's sleep after learning.

1:01:31.400 --> 1:01:33.840
 But what we're also talking about is

1:01:33.840 --> 1:01:36.320
 as the learning event tapers off,

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:37.920
 as you're exiting that

1:01:37.920 --> 1:01:39.780
 to make sure that your epinephrine levels

1:01:39.780 --> 1:01:41.760
 are not tapering off as well.

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:45.200
 And this may be one of the reasons why the 90 minute cycle,

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:47.560
 the so-called ultradian cycle for learning works

1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:48.520
 because it takes a few minutes

1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:50.400
 to get into rhythm of learning.

1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:53.760
 You can maintain that alertness for about 90 minutes.

1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:55.960
 It's no coincidence that these podcasts

1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:58.840
 are typically about 90 minutes long.

1:01:58.840 --> 1:02:02.360
 And as you exit that 90 minutes

1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:05.080
 you're going to start to feel fatigued.

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:06.460
 You're not going to be able to continue

1:02:06.460 --> 1:02:08.920
 to secrete epinephrine at the same level.

1:02:08.920 --> 1:02:11.200
 So I'm not telling you that at the end of this podcast

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:13.080
 you should give yourself a foot shock

1:02:13.080 --> 1:02:14.780
 or that you should jump into an ice bath.

1:02:14.780 --> 1:02:15.620
 Although I will say

1:02:15.620 --> 1:02:17.400
 if you were to increase your epinephrine

1:02:17.400 --> 1:02:18.640
 at the end of this episode

1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:21.040
 by breathing or by way of cold shower,

1:02:21.040 --> 1:02:25.140
 I'm willing to bet based on numerous published studies

1:02:25.140 --> 1:02:29.180
 that the memory for the information would be enhanced

1:02:29.180 --> 1:02:31.860
 because of this retroactive effect

1:02:31.860 --> 1:02:34.340
 of epinephrine and cortisol.

1:02:34.340 --> 1:02:37.040
 Put simply, you can remember things better

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:39.040
 if you increase your alertness,

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:41.920
 AKA your level of epinephrine and cortisol

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:46.040
 after, immediately after something that you want to learn.

1:02:46.040 --> 1:02:48.820
 So I'm reminded by people here at the Huberman Lab Podcast

1:02:48.820 --> 1:02:51.000
 that the optimal strategy therefore

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:55.640
 would be a 90 minute session of focus or learning.

1:02:55.640 --> 1:03:00.640
 Then immediately after cold shower or tumor type breathing

1:03:00.680 --> 1:03:02.920
 or ice bath or something of that sort,

1:03:02.920 --> 1:03:04.960
 maybe a hard run or hit training

1:03:04.960 --> 1:03:07.120
 if you can't get access to the other things.

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:11.240
 And then shower up and do a non-sleep deep rest

1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:12.360
 and then get a good night's sleep.

1:03:12.360 --> 1:03:16.280
 Those would be the optimal tools and the organization of

1:03:16.280 --> 1:03:18.700
 tools for enhanced learning.

1:03:18.700 --> 1:03:20.360
 And of course you could use caffeine

1:03:20.360 --> 1:03:23.640
 to prime the whole process by drinking the caffeine

1:03:23.640 --> 1:03:25.400
 towards the tail of the learning episode,

1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:27.880
 which is counterintuitive at least to me.

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:30.580
 I should mention since many of you use caffeine

1:03:30.580 --> 1:03:32.400
 and I use caffeine, I do drink coffee,

1:03:32.400 --> 1:03:35.560
 I love mushroom coffee, I love mate,

1:03:35.560 --> 1:03:37.740
 I drink caffeine in various forms,

1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:41.300
 that there was a study that came out recently

1:03:41.300 --> 1:03:44.300
 that is relevant to our discussion about energy

1:03:44.300 --> 1:03:47.140
 and alertness and learning.

1:03:47.140 --> 1:03:51.400
 And the study came out just recently in March, 2021.

1:03:51.400 --> 1:03:56.400
 It's Maghalas et al, so M-A-G-A-L-H-A-E-S.

1:03:58.380 --> 1:04:00.420
 And it was published in Molecular Psychiatry,

1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:02.580
 which is a fine journal, a peer review journal.

1:04:02.580 --> 1:04:05.700
 And the title pretty much gives it away.

1:04:05.700 --> 1:04:09.120
 Habitual coffee drinkers display a distinct pattern

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:11.800
 of brain functional connectivity.

1:04:11.800 --> 1:04:15.000
 Chronically drinking coffee changes brain connectivity.

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.820
 And it does it in a number of ways,

1:04:16.820 --> 1:04:19.380
 but the key takeaways from this study,

1:04:19.380 --> 1:04:22.820
 as it relates to sort of what the circuits do,

1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:25.200
 as opposed to me just listing off a bunch of brain circuits,

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:28.240
 which is kind of meaningless in this conversation,

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:33.240
 is that people who drank coffee habitually every day

1:04:33.460 --> 1:04:35.340
 had changes in their brain circuitry

1:04:35.340 --> 1:04:38.760
 such that there was a shift or a bias

1:04:38.760 --> 1:04:43.680
 toward anxiety even when they don't ingest caffeine.

1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:44.700
 So a lot of times we think,

1:04:44.700 --> 1:04:47.340
 oh, caffeine increases your levels of anxiety.

1:04:47.340 --> 1:04:50.560
 And indeed it appears it does if you use it chronically,

1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:53.840
 but not just to caffeine.

1:04:53.840 --> 1:04:56.100
 It doesn't just raise your baseline of anxiety

1:04:56.100 --> 1:04:57.900
 because of what's circulating in your bloodstream.

1:04:57.900 --> 1:04:59.580
 It actually increases connectivity

1:04:59.580 --> 1:05:02.820
 between the brain areas that relate to anxiety.

1:05:02.820 --> 1:05:04.380
 Now that could be a good thing or a bad thing,

1:05:04.380 --> 1:05:05.540
 depending on how you look at it.

1:05:05.540 --> 1:05:10.200
 For people that are prone to chronic panic attacks

1:05:10.200 --> 1:05:12.260
 or anxiety attacks, that's not going to be good.

1:05:12.260 --> 1:05:14.860
 Some people might use caffeine in healthy ways,

1:05:14.860 --> 1:05:15.680
 I believe I do,

1:05:15.680 --> 1:05:18.360
 in order to just increase overall levels of alertness.

1:05:18.360 --> 1:05:20.420
 Although now not only am I going to start

1:05:20.420 --> 1:05:22.140
 delaying my caffeine intake

1:05:22.140 --> 1:05:23.580
 till two hours after I wake up

1:05:23.580 --> 1:05:26.140
 for reasons I've talked about in previous episodes,

1:05:27.100 --> 1:05:29.700
 but I'm also going to start drinking it later

1:05:29.700 --> 1:05:32.600
 in learning and focus sessions

1:05:32.600 --> 1:05:34.460
 as a way to enhance plasticity

1:05:34.460 --> 1:05:37.580
 around those learning and focus sessions not before.

1:05:37.580 --> 1:05:40.500
 So interesting study, feel free to, it's free online.

1:05:40.500 --> 1:05:42.140
 You can access the full paper online.

1:05:42.140 --> 1:05:43.940
 We will put a link as well.

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:46.020
 I want to mention this issue of nootropic,

1:05:46.020 --> 1:05:47.060
 so-called smart drugs,

1:05:47.060 --> 1:05:50.340
 which is not a topic that I particularly enjoy

1:05:50.340 --> 1:05:51.460
 because I don't like the name.

1:05:51.460 --> 1:05:52.900
 I don't like the idea of a nootropic

1:05:52.900 --> 1:05:54.260
 because what is a smart drug?

1:05:54.260 --> 1:05:56.860
 Well, there's different kinds of smart.

1:05:56.860 --> 1:06:00.000
 There's creativity, there's task switching,

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.860
 there's strategy building, there's strategy implementation.

1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:05.580
 And most of the nootropics that are out there

1:06:05.580 --> 1:06:07.420
 are just cocktails of a bunch of different things

1:06:07.420 --> 1:06:09.540
 that aren't tailored to the individual at all.

1:06:09.540 --> 1:06:12.340
 They all seem to have some caffeine

1:06:12.340 --> 1:06:14.620
 or some cholinergic stimulation, et cetera.

1:06:14.620 --> 1:06:16.060
 But there's an important way to frame this

1:06:16.060 --> 1:06:17.940
 in light of today's conversation.

1:06:17.940 --> 1:06:19.860
 Nootropics generally fall into two categories.

1:06:19.860 --> 1:06:24.860
 One category are nootropics that increase blood glucose.

1:06:24.860 --> 1:06:26.820
 So these are compounds that people take

1:06:26.820 --> 1:06:27.920
 that increase blood glucose,

1:06:27.920 --> 1:06:32.060
 and increasing blood glucose will improve performance

1:06:32.060 --> 1:06:34.620
 and can enhance learning in some situations.

1:06:34.620 --> 1:06:36.020
 I'm not suggesting people take these things,

1:06:36.020 --> 1:06:38.000
 but here's just a list of a few of those.

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.220
 Some of them are legal, some of them are gray market,

1:06:40.220 --> 1:06:41.460
 some of them are illegal.

1:06:43.300 --> 1:06:48.300
 Piracetams, oxiracetams, the aniracetams, all the tams, okay?

1:06:49.580 --> 1:06:52.040
 Elevate blood glucose, that's how they work.

1:06:52.040 --> 1:06:55.060
 The neural effects that you hear are secondary or tertiary

1:06:55.060 --> 1:06:57.300
 to the fact that they just increase blood glucose.

1:06:57.300 --> 1:06:59.500
 We know that because if you block the blood glucose effect,

1:06:59.500 --> 1:07:02.660
 you block the nootropic effect, okay?

1:07:02.660 --> 1:07:05.660
 Others include, and definitely don't take these please,

1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:09.820
 amphetamine, cocaine, those will increase learning

1:07:09.820 --> 1:07:12.100
 in the short term in particular dosages,

1:07:12.100 --> 1:07:15.020
 but because they increase blood glucose.

1:07:15.020 --> 1:07:19.060
 And then of course, things like painful stimuli or stress

1:07:19.060 --> 1:07:22.860
 will improve learning by way of increasing blood glucose.

1:07:22.860 --> 1:07:26.420
 Now, stress and epinephrine that's associated with it

1:07:26.420 --> 1:07:31.320
 not only improve performance during the learning bout,

1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:32.440
 but as I mentioned before,

1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:34.680
 having epinephrine come up afterward

1:07:34.680 --> 1:07:36.800
 will increase the retention of that information

1:07:36.800 --> 1:07:38.080
 in the long-term.

1:07:38.080 --> 1:07:39.760
 And then of course, there's a whole category

1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:44.220
 of nootropics that don't impact blood glucose

1:07:44.220 --> 1:07:47.540
 that work by increasing the cholinergic system activity.

1:07:47.540 --> 1:07:51.160
 And these are things like choline, lecithin, phosostigmine,

1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:55.080
 it's a prescription drug, phosphatidylstyrene.

1:07:55.080 --> 1:07:57.480
 So there are ways to increase energy

1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:00.000
 that don't require increasing blood glucose.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.460
 And this is vitally important.

1:08:02.460 --> 1:08:04.800
 The reason we're talking about epinephrine and cortisol

1:08:04.800 --> 1:08:07.160
 for increasing energy and immune system function

1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:11.220
 is because they are largely independent of blood glucose.

1:08:11.220 --> 1:08:13.400
 Of course, they interact with that system,

1:08:13.400 --> 1:08:17.040
 but we heard so much growing up, you need to eat for energy,

1:08:17.040 --> 1:08:19.640
 but the energy that we're talking about today

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:21.160
 is actually a much more powerful one

1:08:21.160 --> 1:08:22.840
 than the one that you derive from food.

1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:25.040
 It's, we could call it neural energy.

1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:28.000
 It's neurotransmitters that create alertness and focus

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.560
 and the willingness and the ability to move

1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:33.160
 and the willingness and ability for immune system

1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:35.560
 to move in response to intruders.

1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:39.680
 So I think we all too often think about food as energy,

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:42.620
 which is great because it is,

1:08:42.620 --> 1:08:45.880
 but there are other sources of energy that are neural

1:08:45.880 --> 1:08:47.860
 and they relate to these hormone systems,

1:08:47.860 --> 1:08:49.040
 cortisol and epinephrine,

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:51.720
 and that's what we're focused on today.

1:08:51.720 --> 1:08:55.020
 So up until now, we've been talking about increasing energy

1:08:55.020 --> 1:08:57.060
 and increasing the immune system

1:08:57.060 --> 1:08:59.620
 by way of cortisol and epinephrine,

1:08:59.620 --> 1:09:02.520
 but I'd be totally remiss if I didn't cover

1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:07.360
 how cortisol and epinephrine, if chronically elevated

1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:09.120
 or if elevated too high,

1:09:09.120 --> 1:09:12.640
 can have a lot of detrimental effects.

1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:14.600
 These are the things we normally hear about.

1:09:14.600 --> 1:09:17.000
 I'm going to describe some of those things,

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:20.760
 but I'm also going to talk about ways to ameliorate them,

1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:23.720
 ways that you can adjust the cortisol levels

1:09:23.720 --> 1:09:24.720
 even if you're stressed,

1:09:24.720 --> 1:09:26.600
 ways that you can adjust epinephrine levels

1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:27.880
 even if you're stressed

1:09:27.880 --> 1:09:30.280
 so that they have less of a negative impact.

1:09:32.120 --> 1:09:33.560
 I don't have to list off all the ways

1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:36.520
 that stress is terrible and chronic stress is terrible.

1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:37.800
 I think you know.

1:09:37.800 --> 1:09:41.580
 Insomnia, your immune system over time will get battered

1:09:41.580 --> 1:09:44.680
 and you won't be able to fight infection off as well, right?

1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:47.580
 You don't want to be stressed for too long.

1:09:47.580 --> 1:09:50.920
 You can start laying down the sort of classic pattern

1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:52.800
 of cortisol-induced body fat.

1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:57.640
 In fact, there's a whole literature related to comfort foods

1:09:57.640 --> 1:10:00.740
 and why we want to consume comfort foods

1:10:00.740 --> 1:10:03.220
 under conditions of chronic stress.

1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:04.840
 And it's quite interesting actually

1:10:04.840 --> 1:10:05.800
 because it reveals something

1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:07.560
 about the biology of chronic stress

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:10.740
 that's informative for how to prevent it

1:10:10.740 --> 1:10:15.060
 or to down-regulate chronic stress once it's occurred.

1:10:15.060 --> 1:10:17.600
 So let's talk for a second about comfort foods.

1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:19.360
 And the work that I'm going to refer to

1:10:19.360 --> 1:10:22.240
 is work that was done by a very impressive scientist

1:10:22.240 --> 1:10:24.440
 by the name of Mary Dalman.

1:10:24.440 --> 1:10:26.800
 Her work goes back decades.

1:10:26.800 --> 1:10:29.480
 She was at University of California, San Francisco.

1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:32.580
 And she asked this question that on the face of it

1:10:32.580 --> 1:10:33.600
 seems kind of obvious,

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:35.920
 but for which there was no mechanism known

1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:39.880
 until Mary and her lab personnel came along.

1:10:39.880 --> 1:10:42.840
 And the question was, why do we seek high fat

1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:46.760
 and or high sugar foods when we are stressed for awhile?

1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:48.440
 Why would that be?

1:10:48.440 --> 1:10:52.400
 And the reason is that the so-called glucocorticoids

1:10:52.400 --> 1:10:54.400
 of which cortisol is a glucocorticoid

1:10:56.700 --> 1:10:58.160
 is caused as we've mentioned before

1:10:58.160 --> 1:10:59.560
 by releasing hormones from the brain

1:10:59.560 --> 1:11:02.200
 and ACTH from the pituitary, et cetera.

1:11:02.200 --> 1:11:05.200
 But normally high levels of glucocorticoid

1:11:05.200 --> 1:11:08.760
 shut off the releasing hormones in the brain

1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:10.520
 and in the pituitary.

1:11:10.520 --> 1:11:13.720
 They shut down in a so-called negative feedback loop.

1:11:13.720 --> 1:11:17.720
 So just like if testosterone or estrogen get too high,

1:11:17.720 --> 1:11:22.040
 that's read out or that is seen so to speak

1:11:22.040 --> 1:11:23.960
 by neurons in the pituitary and brain.

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:26.620
 And then we shut down our production

1:11:26.620 --> 1:11:31.380
 of estrogen and testosterone.

1:11:31.380 --> 1:11:33.000
 If cortisol levels get too high,

1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:33.880
 if there's too much cortisol

1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:35.360
 floating around in our bloodstream,

1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:36.720
 there's a negative feedback loop

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:40.680
 and the brain and pituitary shut down CRH and ACTH

1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:42.700
 which would otherwise stimulate more cortisol.

1:11:42.700 --> 1:11:44.480
 So cortisol levels go down.

1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:47.340
 So it's a beautiful negative feedback loop.

1:11:47.340 --> 1:11:49.040
 Chronic stress, however,

1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:53.120
 stress that lasts more than four to seven days

1:11:53.120 --> 1:11:54.680
 and there's a way to think about

1:11:54.680 --> 1:11:57.680
 what chronic stress really is in an actionable way

1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:01.240
 causes changes in the feedback loop

1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:06.240
 between the adrenals and the brain and the pituitary

1:12:06.700 --> 1:12:08.600
 such that now the brain and the pituitary

1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:11.320
 respond to high levels of glucocorticoids, cortisol

1:12:11.320 --> 1:12:12.760
 by releasing more of them.

1:12:12.760 --> 1:12:15.320
 It becomes a positive feedback loop.

1:12:15.320 --> 1:12:16.180
 And that's bad.

1:12:16.180 --> 1:12:19.780
 It actually gets right down to levels of gene regulation

1:12:19.780 --> 1:12:21.600
 and transcription and translation.

1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:23.780
 And so you really don't want chronic stress

1:12:23.780 --> 1:12:27.640
 because it's a cascade of stress equals more stress

1:12:27.640 --> 1:12:28.460
 equals more stress.

1:12:28.460 --> 1:12:29.680
 So this is why it's very important

1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:32.520
 to learn to turn off the stress response.

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.900
 You don't want it elevated for too long.

1:12:34.900 --> 1:12:37.520
 So there's one study that Dalman and her colleagues did

1:12:37.520 --> 1:12:39.320
 where they stimulate chronic stress

1:12:39.320 --> 1:12:43.000
 by increasing corticosterone cortisol.

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:46.700
 And they found that subjects would increase their consumption

1:12:46.700 --> 1:12:48.800
 of sugar and fat.

1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:50.480
 In fact, they would even eat lard.

1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:52.560
 It would just, it sounds disgusting

1:12:52.560 --> 1:12:55.440
 but they were willing to just eat more fat and more sugar.

1:12:55.440 --> 1:12:58.200
 And that led to all sorts of things like type 2 diabetes

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:03.520
 that led to dysfunction in the adrenal output, et cetera.

1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:05.400
 And so the real key is to learn

1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:07.600
 to shut off the stress response

1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:08.880
 because the interesting thing is,

1:13:08.880 --> 1:13:11.100
 is that Dalman and colleagues and some studies

1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:13.240
 that followed up on their work found

1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:17.680
 that if the system was kicked into motion for too long,

1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:22.200
 then there was a tremendous shift overall towards anxiety

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:24.460
 because it turns out that body fat itself

1:13:24.460 --> 1:13:26.160
 receives neural innervation.

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:28.420
 It received neurons actually talk to body fat.

1:13:28.420 --> 1:13:32.160
 So now you have body fat releasing certain hormones.

1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:35.040
 You've got the adrenals releasing cortisol

1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:37.080
 and all of that is feeding back to the brain

1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:40.180
 to make you want more sugar and fatty foods.

1:13:40.180 --> 1:13:43.200
 So that's how the so-called comfort foods work.

1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:45.220
 And you should watch yourself next time

1:13:45.220 --> 1:13:46.440
 you experience stress.

1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:48.000
 If it's a short-term bout of stress,

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.840
 typically it blocks hunger.

1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:52.760
 If it's a longer bout of stress,

1:13:52.760 --> 1:13:54.920
 typically it triggers hunger in particular

1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:57.680
 for these so-called comfort foods, sugary and fatty foods.

1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:00.880
 And it's kind of interesting how short-term stress

1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:03.440
 can actually block hunger.

1:14:03.440 --> 1:14:07.760
 It does that by activating or interacting

1:14:07.760 --> 1:14:10.960
 with a system called the bombicin system.

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:14.040
 Bombicin is a peptide hormone.

1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:16.140
 It was actually, I think it was named

1:14:16.140 --> 1:14:18.520
 after some sort of reptile or amphibian,

1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:20.120
 excuse me, some sort of toad.

1:14:20.120 --> 1:14:24.040
 I think it was initially sequenced from the toad

1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:25.880
 before it was later discovered in humans.

1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:29.300
 And I think the toad's Latin name is Bombina bombina

1:14:29.300 --> 1:14:30.380
 or something of that sort.

1:14:30.380 --> 1:14:32.840
 And so they decided to call this thing bombicin,

1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:37.400
 but it reduces eating and stress liberates bombicin

1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:38.760
 and makes you want to eat less.

1:14:38.760 --> 1:14:42.000
 But chronic stress causes all these positive feedback

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:43.800
 changes, which are not positive.

1:14:43.800 --> 1:14:45.880
 They're positive, I'm calling them positive

1:14:45.880 --> 1:14:48.480
 because they amplify the stress response over and over,

1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:51.400
 not because they are good for you.

1:14:51.400 --> 1:14:54.340
 So short-term stress, great.

1:14:54.340 --> 1:14:56.660
 Long-term stress, really, really bad.

1:14:56.660 --> 1:14:59.320
 Other bad effects of stress that we can talk about,

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:00.940
 and I won't list off too many more of these

1:15:00.940 --> 1:15:03.040
 because you know so many of them, you hear about them,

1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:05.240
 you really want to know how to control them, I'm guessing,

1:15:05.240 --> 1:15:08.520
 is that yes, indeed, stress can make you go gray.

1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:13.560
 The rates at which people go gray, meaning gray hair,

1:15:13.560 --> 1:15:15.320
 some cases gray body hair as well,

1:15:16.320 --> 1:15:18.500
 depend on some genetic factors.

1:15:18.500 --> 1:15:22.280
 There are a couple of ways that we can go gray.

1:15:22.280 --> 1:15:24.360
 There's actually a stem cell,

1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:26.160
 what they call niche in every follicle.

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:27.500
 So you have stem cells in the follicle

1:15:27.500 --> 1:15:30.000
 that can produce more and more of the given hair cell.

1:15:30.000 --> 1:15:32.120
 And they're actually peroxide groups.

1:15:32.120 --> 1:15:33.880
 You know, we hear about bleaching hair with peroxide,

1:15:33.880 --> 1:15:35.440
 at least in the 80s, that was a thing,

1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:37.800
 but you can use hydrogen peroxide to bleach things,

1:15:37.800 --> 1:15:41.840
 and you can produce your own peroxide in the hair follicle

1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:43.980
 that will cause the hairs to go gray.

1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:46.840
 In addition, pigmentation of hair,

1:15:46.840 --> 1:15:48.320
 just like pigmentation of skin,

1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:51.600
 is controlled by melanocytes.

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:52.960
 Our old friends, the melanocytes.

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:54.880
 And I say old friends because on previous episodes,

1:15:54.880 --> 1:15:58.040
 I talked about why sunlight and getting ample sunlight

1:15:58.040 --> 1:16:01.520
 can increase levels of certain things

1:16:01.520 --> 1:16:03.240
 like melanocyte-stimulating hormone,

1:16:03.240 --> 1:16:04.200
 which reduce hunger,

1:16:04.200 --> 1:16:07.080
 it can improve testosterone and estrogen levels,

1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:08.560
 and all the reasons for that.

1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:11.760
 Well, it turns out that activation

1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:13.960
 of the so-called sympathetic nervous system,

1:16:13.960 --> 1:16:16.500
 which is really just another name for the system

1:16:16.500 --> 1:16:19.880
 that liberates adrenaline from the adrenals

1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:22.080
 and epinephrine in the brain,

1:16:22.080 --> 1:16:26.780
 drives depletion of melanocytes in hair stem cells.

1:16:26.780 --> 1:16:28.600
 So indeed, there's a rate of aging

1:16:28.600 --> 1:16:30.920
 that we will undergo based on our genetics,

1:16:30.920 --> 1:16:33.080
 but stress will make us go gray.

1:16:33.080 --> 1:16:35.000
 And the paper that you should look to

1:16:35.000 --> 1:16:36.080
 if you want to read more about this,

1:16:36.080 --> 1:16:37.200
 came out very recently.

1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:41.040
 This is Zang et al, Z-H-A-N-G et al,

1:16:41.040 --> 1:16:43.000
 Nature, fabulous journal,

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:46.300
 definitely one of the apex journals, 2020.

1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:51.300
 So this paper showed that the activation of stress

1:16:51.560 --> 1:16:54.620
 in various forms will deplete these melanocyte stem cells.

1:16:55.560 --> 1:16:57.440
 You do not have to worry about an ice bath

1:16:57.440 --> 1:16:59.000
 or hard exercise or breathing,

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:00.480
 increasing your levels of stress

1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:01.900
 to the point where it's going to make you go gray.

1:17:01.900 --> 1:17:04.820
 We're talking again about chronic stress.

1:17:04.820 --> 1:17:08.520
 And if you want to offset the stress effects

1:17:08.520 --> 1:17:11.880
 on graying of hair,

1:17:11.880 --> 1:17:15.000
 you can do that by either having a practice

1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.000
 that helps you regulate stress on a consistent basis,

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:21.120
 so something like non-sleep deep rest or meditation.

1:17:21.120 --> 1:17:23.700
 If you can get access to massages or vacations,

1:17:23.700 --> 1:17:24.540
 those are great,

1:17:24.540 --> 1:17:27.280
 but having a practice to keep stress clamped

1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:31.000
 so that it's not chronically elevated, that will be great.

1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:34.000
 As well, this is another case where sunlight,

1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:36.740
 we know, stimulates melanocytes,

1:17:36.740 --> 1:17:39.080
 not just in skin, but in hair.

1:17:39.080 --> 1:17:40.920
 And so getting ample sunlight,

1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:43.260
 having a practice to regulate stress

1:17:43.260 --> 1:17:48.080
 will offset the stress-induced graying of hairs

1:17:48.080 --> 1:17:53.080
 by way of stress-induced depletion of melanocytes.

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:55.720
 And if melanocyte sounds a lot like melanin, you're right.

1:17:55.720 --> 1:17:57.640
 That's because anything involved with pigmentation

1:17:57.640 --> 1:18:01.320
 in the brain and body generally has melano

1:18:01.320 --> 1:18:03.920
 in the front of the word in some way or another.

1:18:03.920 --> 1:18:05.640
 So if chronic stress is so bad

1:18:05.640 --> 1:18:09.280
 because of its effects on epinephrine and cortisol

1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:11.780
 being elevated for too long,

1:18:11.780 --> 1:18:13.800
 then the question becomes, of course,

1:18:13.800 --> 1:18:15.960
 well, what's chronic stress?

1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:16.800
 How do I know the difference

1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:18.880
 between chronic and acute stress?

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:22.440
 And how do I keep chronic stress at bay

1:18:22.440 --> 1:18:23.760
 because of all these negative effects?

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:25.760
 And I didn't even list out the number of other ones,

1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:27.800
 the effects on depression,

1:18:27.800 --> 1:18:31.180
 which certainly has a correlate with elevated cortisol.

1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:36.440
 Thyroid hormone, low thyroid hormone

1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:40.200
 is associated with depression, mistimed thyroid.

1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:45.200
 Once again, getting your light and your feeding

1:18:45.240 --> 1:18:50.220
 and your exercise and your sleep on a consistent schedule

1:18:50.220 --> 1:18:53.520
 or consistent-ish is going to be the most powerful thing

1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:55.860
 you can do in order to buffer yourself

1:18:55.860 --> 1:18:58.760
 against negative effects on mental health

1:18:58.760 --> 1:19:01.200
 and physical health for that matter.

1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:03.000
 There are things that one can take,

1:19:03.920 --> 1:19:06.320
 supplements, prescription drugs, et cetera.

1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:08.080
 Some of you out there may have

1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:09.560
 or may know people that have Cushing's,

1:19:09.560 --> 1:19:11.160
 which is chronically elevated cortisol.

1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:13.280
 There are prescription drugs that we will talk about

1:19:13.280 --> 1:19:14.960
 that can be used.

1:19:14.960 --> 1:19:16.960
 But most people are dealing with a situation

1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:20.040
 where life gets stressful, then less stressful,

1:19:20.040 --> 1:19:21.300
 stressful, then less stressful.

1:19:21.300 --> 1:19:26.300
 I would say based on the data from McEwen and others,

1:19:26.400 --> 1:19:28.800
 Bob Sapolsky's lab over many years,

1:19:28.800 --> 1:19:33.120
 I would say any stress that lasts more than a day

1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:34.400
 or two days or three days

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:37.200
 is starting to become chronic stress.

1:19:37.200 --> 1:19:38.640
 There's really no strict cutoff

1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.740
 because we're not measuring everybody's cortisol

1:19:40.740 --> 1:19:41.580
 from moment to moment.

1:19:41.580 --> 1:19:42.960
 My lab has done experiments

1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:45.040
 where we measure stress in people over time.

1:19:45.040 --> 1:19:47.040
 People vary tremendously in their ability

1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:49.480
 to have a really hard day and then fall deeply asleep.

1:19:49.480 --> 1:19:51.520
 That's going to be the ultimate reset

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:53.540
 is the ability to sleep well,

1:19:53.540 --> 1:19:55.120
 more or less undisturbed each night,

1:19:55.120 --> 1:19:56.960
 although one or two wake-ups during the night,

1:19:56.960 --> 1:19:58.960
 probably not going to be too detrimental

1:19:58.960 --> 1:20:00.640
 provided they're not too long

1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:02.200
 and you're not viewing light

1:20:02.200 --> 1:20:04.280
 during those wake-ups or your phone.

1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:06.020
 But the things that you can take

1:20:06.020 --> 1:20:07.680
 if you feel like you're chronically stressed

1:20:07.680 --> 1:20:08.800
 and you're veering toward

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:12.380
 some of the negative effects of stress are many.

1:20:12.380 --> 1:20:16.520
 There are some simple things that people can do

1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:18.640
 in terms of supplementation.

1:20:18.640 --> 1:20:21.280
 All supplements of course have to be checked out

1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:22.960
 for their safety margins for you

1:20:22.960 --> 1:20:24.640
 because it's going to differ from person to person.

1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:27.320
 You're responsible for making sure they're safe for you

1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:28.680
 if you decide to use them.

1:20:28.680 --> 1:20:32.480
 One of the most common ones is ashwagandha

1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:37.100
 and it has a powerful anxiolytic anxiety effect.

1:20:37.100 --> 1:20:40.760
 You're welcome to go to examine.com and for zero cost,

1:20:40.760 --> 1:20:43.880
 you can see their so-called human effect matrix.

1:20:43.880 --> 1:20:46.080
 Ashwagandha has many uses.

1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:50.860
 It's been used to enhance power output in athletes.

1:20:50.860 --> 1:20:54.700
 It has been shown to modestly increase testosterone.

1:20:54.700 --> 1:20:56.920
 It has been shown to modestly adjust things

1:20:56.920 --> 1:20:59.080
 like low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,

1:20:59.080 --> 1:21:01.820
 the so-called bad cholesterol in quotes.

1:21:01.820 --> 1:21:03.820
 It has a profound effect on anxiety.

1:21:03.820 --> 1:21:05.440
 That's been shown in nine studies,

1:21:05.440 --> 1:21:07.280
 nine peer-reviewed independent studies,

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:10.240
 I mean funded by organizations

1:21:10.240 --> 1:21:12.980
 that have no vested interest in the answer.

1:21:12.980 --> 1:21:17.080
 It has a very strong effect on cortisol itself.

1:21:17.080 --> 1:21:17.940
 How strong?

1:21:17.940 --> 1:21:20.040
 The decrease in cortisol noted in humans

1:21:20.040 --> 1:21:24.400
 is 14.5 to 27.9% reduction

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:27.800
 in otherwise healthy but stressed humans.

1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:29.560
 That's great, six studies.

1:21:29.560 --> 1:21:32.440
 So that's, and it mentions this is significantly larger

1:21:32.440 --> 1:21:33.780
 than many other supplements.

1:21:33.780 --> 1:21:37.080
 Now, some people will say that taking ashwagandha

1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:39.280
 chronically may not be good.

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:40.560
 If you've heard about that

1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:43.480
 or you can point to specific studies

1:21:43.480 --> 1:21:46.200
 that indicate exactly why it's not good,

1:21:46.200 --> 1:21:49.240
 please put it in the comment section or let me know.

1:21:49.240 --> 1:21:52.220
 In the comment section on YouTube would be best.

1:21:52.220 --> 1:21:56.640
 The studies that I'm referring to did explore both genders.

1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:00.440
 The number of subjects was reasonably high, 64 or more.

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:02.400
 One to six months studies,

1:22:02.400 --> 1:22:04.160
 so these were long-term studies, that's great.

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:07.020
 You'd like to see that, not just an acute study.

1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:10.960
 So males and females, lots of different ages,

1:22:10.960 --> 1:22:14.520
 a weight, excuse me, overweight and non-overweight.

1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:16.160
 They did blood draws of cortisol,

1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:18.240
 which is going to end as well as saliva tests.

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:21.360
 Saliva is actually the best way to measure free cortisol.

1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:23.300
 You can also measure it from earwax, it turns out,

1:22:23.300 --> 1:22:26.540
 which sounds pretty gross and kind of is,

1:22:26.540 --> 1:22:29.320
 but nonetheless, that's where cortisol will accumulate

1:22:29.320 --> 1:22:32.960
 in earwax and in saliva, the free cortisol.

1:22:32.960 --> 1:22:36.600
 But that's six very quality studies,

1:22:36.600 --> 1:22:40.240
 independently supported that all point

1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:44.660
 to these very significant 14.5 to 27.9% reductions

1:22:44.660 --> 1:22:45.840
 in otherwise healthy adults.

1:22:45.840 --> 1:22:48.000
 So if you're somebody who is dealing with chronic stress,

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:49.680
 it's a stressful period in your life

1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:53.580
 and you want to stave off the negative effects of stress,

1:22:53.580 --> 1:22:56.080
 well, then ashwagandha may,

1:22:56.080 --> 1:22:57.680
 I want to highlight may be right for you.

1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:00.180
 It also does tend to lower total cortisol,

1:23:00.180 --> 1:23:03.400
 which is interesting, can lower depression

1:23:03.400 --> 1:23:06.500
 to a somewhat minimal degree.

1:23:06.500 --> 1:23:08.200
 And can lower, as I mentioned before,

1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:10.440
 things like low-density lipoprotein.

1:23:10.440 --> 1:23:13.340
 So that, I think ashwagandha comes through

1:23:13.340 --> 1:23:17.380
 as kind of the heavy hitter in this department.

1:23:17.380 --> 1:23:19.840
 Now what's interesting also is the other effects

1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:22.080
 of ashwagandha that are downstream

1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:23.920
 of reducing chronic stress and cortisol,

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:25.360
 because cortisol has so many effects.

1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:26.960
 There are receptors for cortisol

1:23:26.960 --> 1:23:28.480
 all over the body and brain.

1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:30.480
 And so I'll just list these off quickly.

1:23:30.480 --> 1:23:31.980
 I'm not going to list off each study

1:23:31.980 --> 1:23:33.820
 or talk about how many subjects in detail.

1:23:33.820 --> 1:23:36.020
 Again, you can go to examine.com if you want

1:23:36.020 --> 1:23:37.480
 and just put in ashwagandha.

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:40.120
 C-reactive protein, which is a marker

1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:45.040
 of all sorts of negative health effects.

1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:47.900
 Cardiovascular health, even macular degeneration

1:23:47.900 --> 1:23:49.720
 is notably reduced.

1:23:49.720 --> 1:23:52.140
 Heart palpitations, notably reduced.

1:23:52.140 --> 1:23:55.380
 Serum T3 and T4, our old friends for the thyroid hormones

1:23:55.380 --> 1:23:57.360
 from a previous episode are increased.

1:23:58.300 --> 1:24:00.800
 Symptoms of OCD decreased,

1:24:00.800 --> 1:24:03.480
 both the obsessions and the compulsions, right?

1:24:03.480 --> 1:24:06.800
 Obsessions are of the mind, compulsions are of behavior.

1:24:06.800 --> 1:24:09.900
 So there are a lot of things that are downstream

1:24:09.900 --> 1:24:11.540
 of reducing cortisol.

1:24:13.240 --> 1:24:16.180
 Lowered heart rate, lowered rates of insomnia,

1:24:16.180 --> 1:24:18.120
 slightly improved memory.

1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:19.400
 Why that would be, I don't know,

1:24:19.400 --> 1:24:21.680
 because cortisol in the short term can increase memory.

1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:23.920
 I'm guessing it's from increased sleep,

1:24:23.920 --> 1:24:26.120
 decreased pain, increased quality,

1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.040
 decreased reaction times, things of that sort.

1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:30.560
 So the list goes on and on,

1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:34.600
 but all of those things stem downstream of decreased cortisol

1:24:34.600 --> 1:24:37.200
 So if one were to decide to take ashwagandha

1:24:37.200 --> 1:24:39.160
 in order to reduce cortisol,

1:24:39.160 --> 1:24:41.280
 given that you want cortisol early in the day

1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:43.400
 to have energy throughout the day,

1:24:43.400 --> 1:24:45.660
 the time to take it is probably later in the day

1:24:45.660 --> 1:24:46.960
 or in the evening.

1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:48.900
 I've never heard of it preventing sleep

1:24:48.900 --> 1:24:51.200
 or causing insomnia of any kind.

1:24:51.200 --> 1:24:53.920
 That certainly wasn't listed as one of the major effects

1:24:53.920 --> 1:24:55.540
 on examine.com.

1:24:55.540 --> 1:24:57.440
 I will take ashwagandha from time to time

1:24:57.440 --> 1:24:58.560
 if I'm chronically stressed

1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:01.160
 or if I'm not sleeping as well as I ought to.

1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:03.120
 You might think that with all my knowledge about sleep

1:25:03.120 --> 1:25:03.960
 and sleep protocols

1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:05.320
 that I would sleep perfectly every night,

1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:06.840
 but unfortunately I have a dog

1:25:06.840 --> 1:25:11.160
 that has a canine form of sundowners, of dementia.

1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:13.520
 So he's up much of the night these days.

1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:15.120
 And so there's no way I'm getting

1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:17.120
 a solid night of sleep lately.

1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:19.320
 And so I will supplement with ashwagandha

1:25:19.320 --> 1:25:21.000
 and typically I'll take it before sleep

1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:23.640
 and maybe also with my last meal of the day,

1:25:23.640 --> 1:25:26.720
 which is at least two hours before I go to sleep.

1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:29.320
 Again, you have to decide if it's right for you.

1:25:29.320 --> 1:25:31.960
 The dosages can vary tremendously.

1:25:31.960 --> 1:25:34.520
 I would just go by what's on the bottle

1:25:34.520 --> 1:25:35.640
 from a reputable brand.

1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:37.600
 I would also check out examine.com

1:25:37.600 --> 1:25:41.180
 because it mentions a range of dosages that people have used

1:25:41.180 --> 1:25:44.000
 and in various studies to different effects.

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.480
 Now, there is something out there

1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:47.680
 that some of you may actually be taking or ingesting

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:49.800
 that can increase cortisol

1:25:49.800 --> 1:25:53.180
 and not so incidentally can decrease estrogen

1:25:53.180 --> 1:25:54.020
 and testosterone.

1:25:54.020 --> 1:25:57.040
 Because remember cortisol is made from the cholesterol

1:25:57.040 --> 1:26:00.260
 molecule, so is estrogen and testosterone.

1:26:00.260 --> 1:26:02.880
 So our estrogen and testosterone, excuse me.

1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:05.560
 And it's competitive.

1:26:05.560 --> 1:26:07.400
 So you're either making more cortisol

1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:10.160
 or you're making more of the sex steroid hormones,

1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:12.700
 estrogen and testosterone.

1:26:12.700 --> 1:26:14.560
 Believe it or not licorice,

1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:16.200
 which I always thought of as a candy,

1:26:16.200 --> 1:26:21.000
 but licorice contains a substance that I can't pronounce.

1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:26.000
 G-L-Y-C-Y-R-R-H-I-Z-I-N glycyrrhizin,

1:26:27.600 --> 1:26:32.600
 which is of the glabrous species of plant.

1:26:32.760 --> 1:26:35.640
 Actually, because of its chemistry,

1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:39.200
 this 18 beta hydroxyceridic acid,

1:26:39.200 --> 1:26:41.960
 you don't need to know all that licorice, black licorice,

1:26:41.960 --> 1:26:45.960
 contains a substance that increases cortisol.

1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:50.020
 And its increase is not huge, but is significant.

1:26:50.020 --> 1:26:54.720
 This has been looked at in females age 18 to 29,

1:26:54.720 --> 1:26:58.880
 males and females age 18 to 29, people age 30.

1:26:58.880 --> 1:26:59.880
 These are separate studies

1:26:59.880 --> 1:27:03.280
 where I'm listing off the different ages, ages 30 to 64.

1:27:03.280 --> 1:27:06.680
 It turns out that you can see pretty substantial increases

1:27:06.680 --> 1:27:11.680
 in serum cortisol and decreases in testosterone and estrogen.

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:14.460
 So that was complete news to me.

1:27:14.460 --> 1:27:17.400
 Also increases in blood pressure that are pretty substantial

1:27:17.400 --> 1:27:19.780
 that's going to be downstream of cortisol,

1:27:19.780 --> 1:27:21.780
 increasing cortisol is increased blood pressure

1:27:21.780 --> 1:27:24.360
 in order to engage the stress response

1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:25.900
 as part of this stress response.

1:27:25.900 --> 1:27:28.640
 Increased hormones of other kinds

1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:29.740
 that are associated with stress.

1:27:29.740 --> 1:27:30.740
 So who knew?

1:27:30.740 --> 1:27:33.040
 I didn't know, maybe you knew previously.

1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:33.880
 If you did, forgive me,

1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:36.240
 but licorice and some of the compounds in black licorice

1:27:36.240 --> 1:27:37.600
 can actually increase stress,

1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:40.120
 probably not the thing to be ingesting

1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:42.320
 during periods of chronic stress.

1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:44.820
 Whether or not anyone has had positive effects

1:27:44.820 --> 1:27:47.560
 of using it to increase cortisol in other contexts,

1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:48.480
 let me know.

1:27:48.480 --> 1:27:51.600
 But very interesting that the chemistry of licorice

1:27:51.600 --> 1:27:53.760
 increases stress hormones,

1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:56.220
 and therefore you would probably want to,

1:27:56.220 --> 1:27:58.380
 almost certainly would want to avoid it

1:27:58.380 --> 1:28:00.520
 in conditions of chronic stress.

1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:02.840
 Also, if you're trying to optimize testosterone and estrogen,

1:28:02.840 --> 1:28:05.240
 licorice seems like a bad idea.

1:28:05.240 --> 1:28:07.800
 I suppose one instance where you might want to use licorice

1:28:07.800 --> 1:28:08.920
 would be if you're traveling

1:28:08.920 --> 1:28:13.420
 and you're trying to wake up at a particular location

1:28:13.420 --> 1:28:15.720
 because licorice has these effects on cortisol

1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:19.480
 and cortisol is associated with the waking phenomenon

1:28:19.480 --> 1:28:21.080
 and alertness and energy,

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:22.680
 you could use it in that regard.

1:28:23.640 --> 1:28:25.520
 However, I would be careful to time it

1:28:25.520 --> 1:28:27.600
 so that you're not getting two cortisol increases

1:28:27.600 --> 1:28:29.360
 throughout the day, two peaks.

1:28:29.360 --> 1:28:30.840
 So you're going to want to make sure

1:28:30.840 --> 1:28:34.280
 that you're doing all the other things correct for jet lag

1:28:34.280 --> 1:28:35.760
 and adjusting to jet lag.

1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:37.720
 And if you want to know what those things are,

1:28:37.720 --> 1:28:39.200
 including timing your feeding,

1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:41.440
 using temperature, using exercise,

1:28:41.440 --> 1:28:43.920
 using light to adjust to jet lag more quickly,

1:28:43.920 --> 1:28:46.980
 please see the episode that we did on jet lag and shift work

1:28:46.980 --> 1:28:49.340
 where I cover all those protocols in detail.

1:28:49.340 --> 1:28:52.200
 The other compound that I think deserves attention

1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:57.000
 is apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,

1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:01.260
 which is what's found in chamomile.

1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:03.720
 Apigenin, I've talked about previously,

1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:05.140
 it has various effects.

1:29:05.140 --> 1:29:08.560
 One is it is a mild anti-estrogen

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:10.240
 that's been shown in various studies,

1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:12.780
 and it does have a bit of an anxiolytic effect

1:29:12.780 --> 1:29:14.300
 of reducing anxiety.

1:29:14.300 --> 1:29:17.120
 I take it before bedtime, 50 milligrams.

1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:19.200
 Again, you have to decide or figure out

1:29:19.200 --> 1:29:20.340
 if that's safe for you or not.

1:29:20.340 --> 1:29:22.160
 I'm not suggesting you take it.

1:29:22.160 --> 1:29:26.400
 The major source of action is to calm the nervous system,

1:29:26.400 --> 1:29:29.920
 and it does that primarily by adjusting things like GABA

1:29:29.920 --> 1:29:32.000
 and chloride channels, but also has a mild effect

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:33.680
 in reducing cortisol.

1:29:33.680 --> 1:29:37.320
 So ashwagandha and apigenin together sort of,

1:29:37.320 --> 1:29:41.880
 I would consider the most potent commercial compounds

1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:44.280
 that are in supplement non-prescription form

1:29:44.280 --> 1:29:46.960
 that one could use if they were interested

1:29:46.960 --> 1:29:50.080
 in reducing chronic stress, especially late in the day

1:29:50.080 --> 1:29:52.880
 by way of reducing cortisol late in the day.

1:29:52.880 --> 1:29:54.240
 So you're probably getting the impression

1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:55.640
 that cortisol and epinephrine

1:29:55.640 --> 1:29:57.160
 are a bit of a double-edged sword.

1:29:57.160 --> 1:30:00.220
 You want them elevated, but not for too long or too much.

1:30:00.220 --> 1:30:03.840
 You don't want them up for days and days and days,

1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:05.940
 but you do want to have a practice

1:30:05.940 --> 1:30:08.920
 in order to increase them in the short term.

1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:12.580
 So we should talk about protocols

1:30:12.580 --> 1:30:17.580
 that can set a foundation of cortisol and epinephrine

1:30:17.760 --> 1:30:19.680
 that is headed towards optimal.

1:30:19.680 --> 1:30:22.080
 Optimization is always going to be a series

1:30:22.080 --> 1:30:24.080
 of regular practices that you do every day.

1:30:24.080 --> 1:30:26.760
 So sleeping at certain times, light at specific times,

1:30:26.760 --> 1:30:28.780
 food at specific times, certain foods, et cetera.

1:30:28.780 --> 1:30:31.080
 And that's highly individual, but there are some universals,

1:30:31.080 --> 1:30:34.680
 and we've covered a number of those in the discussion today.

1:30:34.680 --> 1:30:39.000
 Meal timing, meal schedules has a profound effect

1:30:39.000 --> 1:30:40.920
 on energy levels.

1:30:40.920 --> 1:30:42.080
 And as I mentioned before,

1:30:42.080 --> 1:30:45.740
 the energy I'm referring to is not glucose energy.

1:30:45.740 --> 1:30:48.600
 It's not burning carbs while running or ketones.

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:50.360
 What I'm talking about is neural energy,

1:30:50.360 --> 1:30:51.940
 epinephrine and cortisol.

1:30:53.080 --> 1:30:55.920
 Fasting and timing one's eating

1:30:55.920 --> 1:30:57.840
 are two sides of the same coin.

1:30:57.840 --> 1:31:00.880
 So even if you're on a kind of standard three meal a day

1:31:00.880 --> 1:31:04.720
 with a couple of snacks in between diet or nutrition regimen,

1:31:04.720 --> 1:31:06.400
 you are fasting whenever you're asleep

1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:08.000
 or you're not ingesting any calories.

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:10.160
 So unless you're hooked up to an IV of glucose,

1:31:10.160 --> 1:31:12.080
 you are fasting while you're sleeping.

1:31:12.080 --> 1:31:14.060
 There are several different kinds of fasting

1:31:14.060 --> 1:31:16.260
 that can relate to epinephrine and cortisol.

1:31:16.260 --> 1:31:20.080
 I will do an entire episode on optimizing food intake

1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:23.580
 for performance in the sports context.

1:31:23.580 --> 1:31:26.600
 That's coming up, but in the meantime,

1:31:26.600 --> 1:31:28.640
 I'd like to just talk about fasting

1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:31.960
 as a source of epinephrine.

1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:33.960
 Anytime when our blood glucose is low,

1:31:33.960 --> 1:31:36.220
 cortisol and epinephrine are going to go up.

1:31:36.220 --> 1:31:39.720
 If we fast for too long, that is stress.

1:31:39.720 --> 1:31:40.640
 There's no way around that.

1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:42.080
 Now that doesn't mean it doesn't have

1:31:42.080 --> 1:31:44.560
 other beneficial effects.

1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:46.320
 Running a marathon is stress,

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:49.800
 but it can also have positive effects if that's your thing.

1:31:49.800 --> 1:31:52.840
 So stress has been demonized as a term,

1:31:52.840 --> 1:31:55.720
 but we want to think about stress mechanistically

1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:57.240
 as epinephrine and cortisol.

1:31:57.240 --> 1:31:58.800
 And then if we do that,

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:01.420
 we can think about how to regulate its timing.

1:32:01.420 --> 1:32:05.040
 So anytime we haven't eaten for four to six hours,

1:32:05.040 --> 1:32:06.420
 levels of epinephrine and cortisol

1:32:06.420 --> 1:32:08.480
 are going to go up pretty substantially.

1:32:08.480 --> 1:32:09.680
 There's an exception to that,

1:32:09.680 --> 1:32:12.560
 which is if you are used to eating on the clock

1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:14.640
 every two hours or every hour,

1:32:14.640 --> 1:32:17.560
 being half hour late or being even 10 minutes late

1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:19.180
 on that schedule will induce stress.

1:32:19.180 --> 1:32:20.720
 Most of that is psychological stress,

1:32:20.720 --> 1:32:22.320
 but also the release of things like ghrelin

1:32:22.320 --> 1:32:23.240
 that are going to make you hungry

1:32:23.240 --> 1:32:25.340
 because they're on that eating clock.

1:32:25.340 --> 1:32:30.100
 So one thing that many people do to great benefit

1:32:30.100 --> 1:32:33.480
 is they follow a so-called circadian eating schedule.

1:32:33.480 --> 1:32:35.640
 They eat only when the sun is up,

1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:39.460
 they stop when the sun is down, more or less.

1:32:39.460 --> 1:32:40.480
 The other way to think about this

1:32:40.480 --> 1:32:42.680
 is they stop eating a couple hours before sleep

1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:44.420
 and they eat more or less upon waking,

1:32:44.420 --> 1:32:46.720
 assuming that they're waking up more or less

1:32:46.720 --> 1:32:48.720
 around the time that the sun rises,

1:32:48.720 --> 1:32:50.440
 maybe plus or minus two hours.

1:32:50.440 --> 1:32:52.800
 Okay, so sort of typical schedule.

1:32:52.800 --> 1:32:55.200
 Now let's say you decide to do

1:32:55.200 --> 1:32:56.920
 what I do, which is I skip breakfast.

1:32:56.920 --> 1:32:58.680
 I drink water, I delay my caffeine

1:32:58.680 --> 1:33:01.440
 for 90 minutes to two hours, and then I drink my caffeine.

1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:04.080
 And then my first meal is typically around lunchtime,

1:33:04.080 --> 1:33:05.200
 11, 30, or 12.

1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:07.840
 And yes, occasionally I throw back some almonds

1:33:07.840 --> 1:33:09.560
 or walnuts or something earlier in the day.

1:33:09.560 --> 1:33:14.520
 I do do that from time to time if I get hungry enough

1:33:14.520 --> 1:33:15.860
 or if I just happen to see them.

1:33:15.860 --> 1:33:17.300
 I'm kind of a drive-by eater.

1:33:17.300 --> 1:33:19.080
 If I see blueberries or nuts or something,

1:33:19.080 --> 1:33:21.040
 I just kind of pick them up and put them in my mouth.

1:33:21.040 --> 1:33:23.360
 I try and not do that off other people's plates,

1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:26.320
 but I just have that habit of doing that from time to time.

1:33:26.320 --> 1:33:29.160
 But typically I don't eat until about noon.

1:33:29.160 --> 1:33:30.880
 So I've got a cortisol increase.

1:33:30.880 --> 1:33:32.160
 I've got my sunlight in the morning.

1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:34.960
 So I'm getting a big pulse in energy early in the day.

1:33:34.960 --> 1:33:36.400
 And yes, there's a little bit of agitation.

1:33:36.400 --> 1:33:39.360
 I am hungry sometimes early in the day, sometimes no,

1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:42.200
 but my ghrelin system is used to kicking in

1:33:42.200 --> 1:33:44.020
 right around noon.

1:33:44.020 --> 1:33:45.440
 At the point where I eat,

1:33:45.440 --> 1:33:49.140
 as long as I don't eat carbohydrate, in my case,

1:33:49.140 --> 1:33:50.600
 I know that my epinephrine levels

1:33:50.600 --> 1:33:51.760
 are going to stay pretty high.

1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:54.240
 So for me, it's usually meat and salad

1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:56.680
 or something of that sort or fish and salad.

1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:00.900
 I don't particularly like eating fish because of the taste,

1:34:00.900 --> 1:34:03.760
 but I'm essentially low carb or keto-ish throughout the day.

1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:07.320
 So I'm probably in a slightly elevated state

1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:09.480
 of epinephrine and cortisol throughout the day.

1:34:09.480 --> 1:34:11.020
 Some of you are fasting even longer.

1:34:11.020 --> 1:34:13.120
 You're pushing out till 4 p.m. or 8 p.m.

1:34:13.120 --> 1:34:15.500
 or maybe you're even fasting around the clock.

1:34:15.500 --> 1:34:16.860
 Anytime you're fasting,

1:34:16.860 --> 1:34:19.880
 you're increasing epinephrine and cortisol release.

1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:21.700
 You can do all the meditation in the world

1:34:21.700 --> 1:34:23.180
 to keep your mind calm,

1:34:23.180 --> 1:34:26.440
 but you are closer to that edge of stress

1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:29.500
 and you're closer to that edge of peak stress.

1:34:29.500 --> 1:34:32.440
 So that's something that's just important to understand.

1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:34.600
 The description about comfort foods and cortisol

1:34:34.600 --> 1:34:37.020
 was one of kind of an extreme case

1:34:37.020 --> 1:34:40.120
 where cortisol systems kick over to a positive feedback loop

1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:44.160
 but we all eat to suppress cortisol and epinephrine.

1:34:44.160 --> 1:34:45.100
 When we're hungry,

1:34:45.100 --> 1:34:46.960
 cortisol and epinephrine create an agitation

1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:48.320
 so we go seek food.

1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:50.900
 When we ingest food that typically,

1:34:50.900 --> 1:34:52.000
 if it includes carbohydrate,

1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:53.320
 there's a blunting of cortisol,

1:34:53.320 --> 1:34:55.220
 there's a blunting of epinephrine in the bloodstream.

1:34:55.220 --> 1:34:57.280
 If you've ever had too much coffee to drink

1:34:57.280 --> 1:34:59.400
 and you go and have a couple of pieces of bread,

1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:02.320
 you will feel that you might describe it

1:35:02.320 --> 1:35:04.480
 as the caffeine getting soaked up out of your system

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:06.680
 but what you're doing is you're elevating blood glucose,

1:35:06.680 --> 1:35:09.280
 which is more or less saturating

1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:10.820
 the effect of caffeine in your system.

1:35:10.820 --> 1:35:14.520
 Not completely, but it's going to have that effect.

1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:16.440
 If you're very stressed and you sit down to eat something,

1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:18.020
 it will calm you down.

1:35:18.020 --> 1:35:20.040
 Yes, because some of the blood that goes to your stomach

1:35:20.040 --> 1:35:21.440
 but more so because of these effects

1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:23.280
 in blunting cortisol and epinephrine.

1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:27.180
 So the important point here is that if you want to be alert,

1:35:27.180 --> 1:35:30.200
 you can do that by way of not eating.

1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:31.880
 Of course, please ingest fluids.

1:35:31.880 --> 1:35:33.760
 I know some people water fast out there.

1:35:33.760 --> 1:35:36.380
 I am yet to see good science on water fasting

1:35:36.380 --> 1:35:38.060
 and why that can stimulate stem cells

1:35:38.060 --> 1:35:40.900
 or people love the idea of after the Nobel Prize

1:35:40.900 --> 1:35:42.880
 was given for autophagy and this idea

1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:45.320
 that our cells clean up debris and senescent cells.

1:35:45.320 --> 1:35:48.720
 Yes, that's true but the idea that water fasting

1:35:48.720 --> 1:35:50.820
 is going to promote that I find rather amusing.

1:35:50.820 --> 1:35:53.080
 Please send me the data if you know some great study

1:35:53.080 --> 1:35:55.480
 in a decent journal but pretty much this is something

1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:56.320
 I hear about.

1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:58.660
 I don't think water fasting is a good idea

1:35:58.660 --> 1:36:00.880
 nor should you be drinking so much water

1:36:00.880 --> 1:36:01.720
 that you kill yourself.

1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:04.900
 You can actually drink enough water that you die.

1:36:04.900 --> 1:36:07.480
 So I think ingesting water in healthy amounts

1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:08.920
 is a good thing, stay hydrated

1:36:08.920 --> 1:36:12.080
 but if you want to be alert, stay hydrated.

1:36:12.080 --> 1:36:14.280
 Caffeine may or may not be in your regimen

1:36:14.280 --> 1:36:18.720
 but fasting will make sure that your levels of energy

1:36:18.720 --> 1:36:21.800
 are up and you will be primed very well

1:36:21.800 --> 1:36:24.440
 for doing a protocol of the sort that we talked about

1:36:24.440 --> 1:36:27.360
 earlier in this episode of breathing or cold exposure

1:36:27.360 --> 1:36:29.460
 or exercise to get that increase

1:36:29.460 --> 1:36:31.040
 in the immune system function.

1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:32.900
 And if you do that after learning,

1:36:32.900 --> 1:36:34.440
 after trying to learn something,

1:36:34.440 --> 1:36:35.680
 it will increase learning

1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:38.480
 for that particular set of information,

1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:39.920
 whether or not it's motor or language

1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:43.440
 or whatever it happens to be, mathematics, programming.

1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:47.720
 So fasting is a tool for many reasons,

1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:49.720
 can increase growth hormone, et cetera.

1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:52.520
 But today I'm talking about fasting as a tool

1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:55.920
 to bias your system toward more epinephrine

1:36:55.920 --> 1:36:58.560
 adrenaline release and toward more cortisol release

1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:01.880
 but still low enough that it's not chronic stress,

1:37:01.880 --> 1:37:04.160
 that it's not causing negative health effects.

1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:08.320
 But please know that if life is very, very stressful,

1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:10.980
 if you're experiencing lots of stressors

1:37:10.980 --> 1:37:13.480
 and you're chronically fasting,

1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:17.240
 you are positioning yourself toward a greater likelihood

1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:20.800
 of being chronically stressed in the ways that are negative,

1:37:20.800 --> 1:37:22.520
 negative effects on the reproductive axis,

1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:23.880
 lower testosterone and estrogen,

1:37:23.880 --> 1:37:27.400
 negative effects on your hair will turn gray.

1:37:27.400 --> 1:37:28.600
 There's reasons for that.

1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:31.840
 Your sleep will suffer, your immune system will suffer.

1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:34.840
 So I think while it's nuanced,

1:37:35.940 --> 1:37:39.820
 our discussion today about epinephrine and cortisol

1:37:39.820 --> 1:37:44.040
 increasing energy and immunity are designed

1:37:44.040 --> 1:37:46.560
 to help you understand

1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:48.220
 when you should be doing certain things,

1:37:48.220 --> 1:37:49.680
 when you should throttle back,

1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:52.160
 when you might want to kick up your adrenaline a bit.

1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:54.320
 If you're suffering from low energy

1:37:54.320 --> 1:37:56.600
 because you're just kind of feeling down

1:37:56.600 --> 1:37:58.900
 and a little bit under-activated,

1:37:58.900 --> 1:38:00.840
 well, then the practices of ice baths

1:38:00.840 --> 1:38:03.740
 and intense breathing, et cetera, could be very beneficial.

1:38:03.740 --> 1:38:05.900
 So might fasting.

1:38:05.900 --> 1:38:10.020
 But if you're feeling exhausted and burnt out,

1:38:10.020 --> 1:38:11.960
 so drained and stressed,

1:38:11.960 --> 1:38:16.140
 well, then fasting or doing a lot of cold exposure

1:38:16.140 --> 1:38:17.880
 or doing a lot of intense exercise

1:38:17.880 --> 1:38:20.940
 is driving you further and further into chronic stress.

1:38:20.940 --> 1:38:24.860
 So because I don't have a saliva test or a blood test

1:38:24.860 --> 1:38:27.520
 or God forbid an earwax test to measure your cortisol

1:38:27.520 --> 1:38:30.860
 as we're engaging in this discussion together,

1:38:30.860 --> 1:38:33.420
 you have to gauge for yourself

1:38:33.420 --> 1:38:36.740
 whether or not you are in a state of under-activated

1:38:36.740 --> 1:38:38.860
 and need more epinephrine and cortisol

1:38:40.140 --> 1:38:43.620
 or whether or not you are over-activated

1:38:43.620 --> 1:38:45.140
 in terms of cortisol and epinephrine

1:38:45.140 --> 1:38:48.300
 and you need ways to buffer those, ashwagandha.

1:38:48.300 --> 1:38:51.100
 Maybe it should be a warm mellow bath, not an ice bath.

1:38:51.100 --> 1:38:53.920
 So one has to learn how to regulate these hormones

1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:56.940
 with behavior, with nutrition, perhaps with supplementation.

1:38:56.940 --> 1:38:58.740
 And then of course there are prescription drugs.

1:38:58.740 --> 1:39:01.100
 And I always leave these to the end

1:39:01.100 --> 1:39:02.820
 because A, I'm not a medical doctor,

1:39:02.820 --> 1:39:04.780
 I'm not prescribing anything, I'm a professor,

1:39:04.780 --> 1:39:05.940
 I'm professing a number of things

1:39:05.940 --> 1:39:09.500
 that you can decide for yourselves what to do with or not.

1:39:09.500 --> 1:39:11.820
 But of course there are prescription drugs

1:39:11.820 --> 1:39:15.120
 that can increase cortisol or decrease cortisol

1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:16.700
 in cases like Cushing syndrome,

1:39:16.700 --> 1:39:18.980
 which if you have that diagnosed,

1:39:18.980 --> 1:39:20.660
 you should talk to a physician.

1:39:20.660 --> 1:39:23.580
 You should talk ideally to a endocrinologist

1:39:23.580 --> 1:39:26.760
 but to a physician of some sort, board certified physician.

1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:31.780
 There are drugs that can be used to treat injury

1:39:31.780 --> 1:39:33.700
 like corticosterones that you can inject

1:39:33.700 --> 1:39:36.660
 to reduce inflammation and injury, but they are cortisol.

1:39:36.660 --> 1:39:37.660
 So they're going to bias you

1:39:37.660 --> 1:39:39.460
 towards more stress in other domains.

1:39:39.460 --> 1:39:41.940
 Remember cortisol can cross the blood-brain barrier

1:39:41.940 --> 1:39:44.420
 so you're going to be more prone to psychological stress.

1:39:44.420 --> 1:39:45.780
 I also want to mention again

1:39:45.780 --> 1:39:48.040
 that I think there's great benefit to having a practice

1:39:48.040 --> 1:39:49.340
 that perhaps you do every other day,

1:39:49.340 --> 1:39:53.000
 but if you can't maybe every third day or every other day

1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:56.280
 of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body

1:39:56.280 --> 1:39:58.500
 while learning to stay calm in the mind

1:39:58.500 --> 1:40:01.460
 so that you learn to separate the brain-body experience.

1:40:01.460 --> 1:40:04.100
 We hear so much about how beneficial it is

1:40:04.100 --> 1:40:05.660
 to unify the brain and body,

1:40:05.660 --> 1:40:07.580
 that we're all out of touch with our brain and bodies.

1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:11.660
 I particularly dislike claims like that

1:40:11.660 --> 1:40:14.980
 or statements like that because there's great power,

1:40:14.980 --> 1:40:18.500
 as we learned today, in having your body activated

1:40:18.500 --> 1:40:21.060
 by some sort of stimulus, cold water

1:40:21.060 --> 1:40:22.780
 or even psychological stress,

1:40:22.780 --> 1:40:24.980
 but learning to stay calm in your mind.

1:40:24.980 --> 1:40:25.900
 I should just remind you

1:40:25.900 --> 1:40:29.220
 that most of the negative effects on your life

1:40:29.220 --> 1:40:30.800
 and on the lives of others

1:40:30.800 --> 1:40:35.000
 are due to people, perhaps you, I hope not,

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:36.860
 being unable to regulate their mind

1:40:36.860 --> 1:40:39.020
 when they have high levels of adrenaline in their body,

1:40:39.020 --> 1:40:40.620
 either because they read something in a text

1:40:40.620 --> 1:40:42.180
 or a comment section.

1:40:42.180 --> 1:40:44.020
 Of course, that never happens to me,

1:40:44.020 --> 1:40:46.260
 but it may happen to you.

1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:47.780
 Of course, it happens to me,

1:40:47.780 --> 1:40:49.940
 but the idea is to stay calm in your mind

1:40:49.940 --> 1:40:52.460
 so that then you can regulate your action, right?

1:40:52.460 --> 1:40:55.100
 And so I think that there are these practices

1:40:55.100 --> 1:40:57.360
 that one can develop over time

1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:01.220
 that are really straightforward and zero cost, right?

1:41:01.220 --> 1:41:03.320
 You could find any number of ways

1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:06.080
 to increase your adrenaline and stay calm.

1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:09.000
 And we tend to focus on things like exercise

1:41:09.000 --> 1:41:10.740
 as the way that we get our energy up.

1:41:10.740 --> 1:41:12.440
 But today, again, I'm talking

1:41:12.440 --> 1:41:15.160
 about deliberately increasing adrenaline

1:41:15.160 --> 1:41:17.380
 while staying calm mentally,

1:41:17.380 --> 1:41:18.920
 because that has great utility

1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:23.900
 when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events,

1:41:23.900 --> 1:41:25.940
 through things that we didn't seek out.

1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:29.980
 So the ability to regulate adrenaline and cortisol

1:41:29.980 --> 1:41:32.580
 is about inducing them deliberately

1:41:32.580 --> 1:41:35.220
 when you want to push back on infection,

1:41:35.220 --> 1:41:37.860
 potential infection from bacteria or viruses.

1:41:37.860 --> 1:41:40.800
 It's about pulling back on adrenaline and cortisol,

1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:42.400
 maybe through the use of supplementation,

1:41:42.400 --> 1:41:45.700
 but certainly through proper use of light and sleep

1:41:45.700 --> 1:41:48.160
 and mental tools that we talked about as well,

1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:50.820
 when they are chronically elevated.

1:41:50.820 --> 1:41:52.720
 It's about training your system,

1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:54.900
 not just to be unified at brain and body,

1:41:54.900 --> 1:41:57.080
 which sounds great until you're stressed,

1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:58.240
 and then that's terrible.

1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:01.360
 It's really about having a deliberate dissociation

1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:03.880
 between the adrenaline response from the adrenals

1:42:03.880 --> 1:42:06.600
 and the adrenaline response from the brainstem.

1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:10.320
 So once again, we've covered a ton of material.

1:42:10.320 --> 1:42:12.660
 I hope right now you're thinking,

1:42:12.660 --> 1:42:15.260
 okay, am I in a state of chronic stress?

1:42:15.260 --> 1:42:17.280
 Am I under-activated or could I afford

1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:20.160
 to increase my levels of adrenaline and cortisol

1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:23.120
 to improve my relationship to my immune system

1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:26.080
 and to energy, neural energy?

1:42:26.080 --> 1:42:29.400
 If you like the information that you heard today

1:42:29.400 --> 1:42:30.760
 and you want to remember it,

1:42:30.760 --> 1:42:33.540
 well then at the end of this episode,

1:42:33.540 --> 1:42:34.600
 perhaps you go do something

1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:36.880
 to increase your level of adrenaline.

1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:38.200
 And now you know what some of those things are

1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:40.020
 because it will help you retain the information,

1:42:40.020 --> 1:42:41.440
 or you could apply that to anything else

1:42:41.440 --> 1:42:44.020
 that you learn or experience, of course.

1:42:44.020 --> 1:42:47.460
 And I hope that you'll think about some of the ways

1:42:47.460 --> 1:42:51.840
 in which cortisol and adrenaline are not good or bad,

1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:53.040
 that stress isn't good or bad,

1:42:53.040 --> 1:42:54.880
 but short-term stress is healthy.

1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:56.320
 Alertness and energy is healthy

1:42:56.320 --> 1:42:58.780
 even if it puts you at the edge of agitation.

1:42:58.780 --> 1:43:00.360
 That's an opportunity to learn

1:43:00.360 --> 1:43:02.300
 how to control these hormones better.

1:43:02.300 --> 1:43:04.480
 And I hope that if you're in a state of chronic stress

1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:07.040
 that you'll do things to start tamping down

1:43:07.040 --> 1:43:09.860
 some of that stress and that you realize

1:43:09.860 --> 1:43:13.040
 that your nervous system and your hormone system are linked,

1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:14.900
 but they're linked in ways that you can control,

1:43:14.900 --> 1:43:17.120
 that we don't have to be slaves to our hormones

1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:19.380
 and certainly not the hormones that cause us stress.

1:43:19.380 --> 1:43:20.780
 We can learn to control those

1:43:20.780 --> 1:43:24.280
 both to the benefit of our body and benefit of mind.

1:43:24.280 --> 1:43:25.900

 but in addition to that,

1:43:40.840 --> 1:43:43.180
 we are starting to release short clips now and again,

1:44:04.440 --> 1:44:06.740
 as well as suggestions for future episodes.

1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:08.480
 We do read all the comments

1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:10.760
 and I know many of you are anxiously awaiting

1:44:10.760 --> 1:44:13.000
 particular topics and episodes

1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:14.800
 and we will eventually get to them all.

1:44:14.800 --> 1:44:16.360
 I'm not going anywhere.

1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:19.140
 And we do want to be thorough about every topic.

1:44:19.140 --> 1:44:22.880
 Today, we rounded out the discussion about hormones.

1:44:22.880 --> 1:44:25.040
 We aren't going to continue with that topic any longer.

1:44:25.040 --> 1:44:27.180
 We are moving to a new topic segment

1:44:27.180 --> 1:44:29.320
 for an entire month or so.

1:44:29.320 --> 1:44:31.520
 If you know of other people that you think could benefit

1:44:31.520 --> 1:44:33.420
 from the information on this podcast

1:44:33.420 --> 1:44:35.660
 or that you think would enjoy listening to it,

1:44:35.660 --> 1:44:37.240
 please forward it along to them.

1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:39.000
 We'd really appreciate that.

1:44:39.000 --> 1:44:40.440
 Another great way to support us

1:44:40.440 --> 1:44:42.040
 is to check out our sponsors

1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:44.760
 that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.

1:44:44.760 --> 1:44:46.360
 We also have a Patreon.

1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:49.340
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman.

1:44:49.340 --> 1:44:50.920
 There you can support the podcast

1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:53.000
 at any level that you like.

1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:56.320
 I should mention that I will be answering some questions

1:44:56.320 --> 1:44:59.740
 that come up frequently in the comment section on YouTube

1:44:59.740 --> 1:45:02.280
 in Instagram lives every once in a while.

1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:04.320
 I am on Twitter at Huberman Lab.

1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:06.840
 I'm on Instagram also at Huberman Lab

1:45:06.840 --> 1:45:09.680
 and on Instagram from time to time coming up,

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:13.600
 I'm going to be discussing answers to your common questions

1:45:13.600 --> 1:45:14.960
 in these Instagram lives

1:45:14.960 --> 1:45:16.960
 and I will make sure that they're recorded.

1:45:16.960 --> 1:45:18.160
 So you can check those out.

1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:19.440
 Please follow our Instagram

1:45:19.440 --> 1:45:21.240
 if you are not already doing that

1:45:21.240 --> 1:45:23.560
 and check out our Twitter if you're on Twitter.

1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:25.520
 I covered a lot of different types of tools today,

1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:28.860
 behavioral tools, et cetera, but I did mention supplements.

1:45:28.860 --> 1:45:30.960
 For those of you that are interested in supplements,

1:45:30.960 --> 1:45:34.440
 we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E

1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:36.740
 because we believe them to have the highest levels

1:45:36.740 --> 1:45:40.360
 of stringency and quality in terms of supplement production,

 Thank you for joining me for what I hope

1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:15.880
 was an informative discussion and an actionable discussion

 about how to increase energy and the immune system

1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:22.600
 by way of cortisol and adrenaline epinephrine.

1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:25.920
 I really appreciate your willingness to learn new topics

1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:28.240
 as well as to embrace and think about new tools

1:46:28.240 --> 1:46:30.120

1:46:30.120 --> 1:46:33.000
