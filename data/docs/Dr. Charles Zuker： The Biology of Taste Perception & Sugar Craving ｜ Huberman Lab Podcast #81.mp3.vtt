00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.260 --> 00:10.320
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.320 --> 00:13.120
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.120 --> 00:15.000
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.560
 Today, my guest is Dr. Charles Zucker.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.720
 Dr. Zucker is a professor of biochemistry

00:19.720 --> 00:22.320
 and molecular biophysics and of neuroscience

00:22.320 --> 00:25.160
 at Columbia University School of Medicine.

00:25.160 --> 00:27.680
 Dr. Zucker is one of the world's leading experts

00:27.680 --> 00:28.900
 in perception.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.940
 That is how the nervous system converts physical stimuli

00:31.940 --> 00:35.220
 in the world into events within the nervous system

00:35.220 --> 00:38.360
 that we come to understand as our sense of smell,

00:38.360 --> 00:40.520
 our sense of taste, our sense of vision,

00:40.520 --> 00:43.080
 our sense of touch, and our sense of hearing.

00:43.080 --> 00:45.760
 Dr. Zucker's lab is responsible for a tremendous amount

00:45.760 --> 00:47.960
 of pioneering and groundbreaking work

00:47.960 --> 00:50.060
 in the area of perception.

00:50.060 --> 00:52.140
 For a long time, his laboratory worked on vision,

00:52.140 --> 00:54.640
 defining the very receptors that allow

00:54.640 --> 00:56.520
 for the conversion of light into signals

00:56.520 --> 00:59.620
 that the rest of the eye and the brain can understand.

00:59.620 --> 01:02.000
 In recent years, his laboratory has focused mainly

01:02.000 --> 01:03.560
 on the perception of taste.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.360
 And indeed, his laboratory is responsible

01:05.360 --> 01:08.020
 for discovering many of the taste receptors,

01:08.020 --> 01:11.040
 leading to our perception of things like sweetness,

01:11.040 --> 01:14.420
 sourness, bitterness, saltiness, and umami,

01:14.420 --> 01:16.680
 that is savoriness in food.

01:16.680 --> 01:18.660
 Dr. Zucker's laboratory is also responsible

01:18.660 --> 01:21.620
 for doing groundbreaking work on the sense of thirst.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.840
 That is how the nervous system determines

01:23.840 --> 01:26.120
 whether or not we should ingest more fluid

01:26.120 --> 01:28.880
 or reject fluids that are offered to us.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.600
 A key feature of the work from Dr. Zucker's laboratory

01:31.600 --> 01:34.120
 is that it bridges the brain and body.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.320
 As you'll soon learn from today's discussion,

01:36.320 --> 01:38.840
 his laboratory has discovered a unique set

01:38.840 --> 01:41.360
 of sugar-sensing neurons that exist

01:41.360 --> 01:43.860
 not just within the brain, but a separate set of neurons

01:43.860 --> 01:46.880
 that sense sweetness and sugar within the body.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.120
 And that much of the communication between the brain

01:49.120 --> 01:51.800
 and body leading to our seeking of sugar

01:51.800 --> 01:53.840
 is below our conscious detection.

01:53.840 --> 01:55.480
 Dr. Zucker has received a large number

01:55.480 --> 01:57.120
 of prestigious awards and appointments

01:57.120 --> 01:59.880
 as a consequence of his discoveries in neuroscience.

01:59.880 --> 02:02.220
 He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences,

02:02.220 --> 02:03.600
 the National Academy of Medicine,

02:03.600 --> 02:06.280
 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

02:06.280 --> 02:07.620
 He is also an investigator

02:07.620 --> 02:09.840
 with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

02:09.840 --> 02:11.320
 For those of you that are not familiar

02:11.320 --> 02:14.360
 with the so-called HHMI, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute,

02:14.360 --> 02:16.440
 Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators

02:16.440 --> 02:19.440
 are selected on an extremely competitive basis,

02:19.440 --> 02:22.080
 and indeed they have to come back every five years

02:22.080 --> 02:25.400
 and prove themselves worthy of being reappointed

02:25.400 --> 02:27.360
 as Howard Hughes investigators.

02:27.360 --> 02:31.960
 Dr. Zucker has been a Howard Hughes investigator since 1989.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.500
 What all that means for you as a viewer

02:33.500 --> 02:35.560
 and or a listener of today's podcast

02:35.560 --> 02:38.320
 is that you are about to learn about the nervous system

02:38.320 --> 02:40.400
 and its ability to create perceptions,

02:40.400 --> 02:43.280
 in particular, the perception of taste and sugar-sensing

02:43.280 --> 02:47.000
 from the world's expert on perception and taste.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.560
 I'm certain that by the end of today's podcast,

02:49.560 --> 02:50.600
 you're not just going to come away

02:50.600 --> 02:52.660
 with a deeper understanding of our perceptions

02:52.660 --> 02:54.880
 and our perception of taste in particular,

02:54.880 --> 02:57.300
 but indeed you will come away with an understanding

02:57.300 --> 03:00.040
 of how we create internal representations

03:00.040 --> 03:02.160
 of the entire world around us,

03:02.160 --> 03:04.760
 and in doing so, how we come to understand

03:04.760 --> 03:06.200
 our life experience.

03:06.200 --> 03:08.040
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:08.040 --> 03:10.380
 is now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

03:10.380 --> 03:12.860
 We often talk about supplements on the Huberman Lab Podcast,

03:12.860 --> 03:15.080
 and while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

03:15.080 --> 03:17.200
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

03:17.200 --> 03:20.000
 for things like enhancing the quality and speed

03:20.000 --> 03:21.560
 with which you get into sleep,

03:21.560 --> 03:24.580
 or for enhancing focus, or for hormone support.

03:24.580 --> 03:26.400
 The reason we partnered with Momentous Supplements

03:26.400 --> 03:27.240
 is several fold.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.200
 First of all, their supplements

03:28.200 --> 03:29.960
 are of the absolute highest quality.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.200
 Second of all, they ship internationally,

03:32.200 --> 03:34.680
 which is important because many of our podcast listeners

03:34.680 --> 03:36.320
 reside outside the US.

03:36.320 --> 03:39.160
 Third, many of the supplements that Momentous makes,

03:39.160 --> 03:40.720
 and most all of the supplements

03:40.720 --> 03:42.560
 that we partnered with them directly on,

03:42.560 --> 03:44.680
 are single ingredient formulations.

03:44.680 --> 03:46.180
 This is important for a number of reasons.

03:46.180 --> 03:48.380
 First of all, if you're going to create a supplement protocol

03:48.380 --> 03:50.280
 that's customized for your needs,

03:50.280 --> 03:51.520
 you want to be able to figure out

03:51.520 --> 03:53.520
 which supplement ingredients are most essential

03:53.520 --> 03:54.640
 and only use those.

03:54.640 --> 03:56.640
 And supplements that combine lots of ingredients

03:56.640 --> 03:58.460
 simply won't allow you to do that.

03:58.460 --> 04:00.720
 So in trying to put together a supplement protocol

04:00.720 --> 04:03.320
 for yourself that's the most biologically effective

04:03.320 --> 04:06.000
 and cost-effective, single ingredient formulations

04:06.000 --> 04:07.360
 are going to be the most useful.

04:07.360 --> 04:08.520
 If you'd like to see the supplements

04:08.520 --> 04:10.280
 that we partnered with Momentous on,

04:10.280 --> 04:13.240
 you can go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

04:13.240 --> 04:15.380
 and there you'll see many of the supplements

04:15.380 --> 04:16.800
 that we've talked repeatedly about

04:16.800 --> 04:19.080
 on the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.

04:19.080 --> 04:21.520
 I should mention that the catalog of supplements

04:21.520 --> 04:24.160
 that are available at livemomentous.com slash Huberman

04:24.160 --> 04:25.940
 is constantly being expanded.

04:25.940 --> 04:29.280
 So you can check back there livemomentous.com slash Huberman

04:29.280 --> 04:31.040
 to see what's currently available.

04:31.040 --> 04:32.240
 And from time to time,

04:32.240 --> 04:34.820
 you'll notice new supplements being added to the inventory.

04:34.820 --> 04:37.340
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

04:37.340 --> 04:40.100
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:40.100 --> 04:42.080
 It is however, part of my desire and effort

04:42.080 --> 04:44.620
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:44.620 --> 04:47.240
 and science related tools to the general public.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.260
 In keeping with that theme,

04:48.260 --> 04:51.000
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.240
 Thesis makes custom nootropics.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.700
 And for frequent listeners of this podcast,

04:57.700 --> 04:59.360
 you may remember that I'm not a big fan

04:59.360 --> 05:02.080
 of the word nootropics because the word nootropics

05:02.080 --> 05:05.060
 means smart drugs or smart compound.

05:05.060 --> 05:06.580
 And the reason I don't like that phrase

05:06.580 --> 05:09.640
 is that the brain has many different circuits that it uses

05:09.640 --> 05:12.320
 in order to perform things like focus

05:12.320 --> 05:14.960
 or task switching or creativity.

05:14.960 --> 05:16.980
 So the idea that there's a single thing

05:16.980 --> 05:18.680
 that we would call a smart drug

05:18.680 --> 05:21.960
 is simply not in concert with the biology.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.720
 Well, Thesis understands this,

05:23.720 --> 05:25.480
 and as a consequence has developed

05:25.480 --> 05:27.240
 custom nootropic formulations

05:27.240 --> 05:29.480
 that are tailored to your unique needs.

05:29.480 --> 05:31.860
 So for instance, Thesis will allow you to try

05:31.860 --> 05:33.720
 different blends over the course of a month

05:33.720 --> 05:36.360
 and determine which blends of specific ingredients

05:36.360 --> 05:38.040
 work best for you to focus

05:38.040 --> 05:41.540
 or for you to gain motivation and energy for workouts

05:41.540 --> 05:43.260
 or for cognitive work of some sort.

05:43.260 --> 05:44.880
 I've been using Thesis custom nootropics

05:44.880 --> 05:46.680
 for well over six months now,

05:46.680 --> 05:48.720
 and they completely transformed the way that I do

05:48.720 --> 05:52.640
 cognitive work and indeed the way that I do physical fitness.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.280
 If you want to try your own personalized

05:54.280 --> 05:55.200
 nootropic starter kit,

05:55.200 --> 05:58.520
 you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman.

05:58.520 --> 06:00.640
 There you'll just do a brief three minute quiz

06:00.640 --> 06:02.640
 and Thesis will send you four different formulas

06:02.640 --> 06:04.200
 to try in your first month.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.360
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

06:06.360 --> 06:08.060
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

06:08.060 --> 06:10.120
 to get 10% off your first box.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.360
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Roca.

06:12.360 --> 06:14.520
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

06:14.520 --> 06:16.400
 that are the absolute highest quality.

06:16.400 --> 06:18.320
 The company was founded by two all American swimmers

06:18.320 --> 06:20.620
 from Stanford and everything about Roca eyeglasses

06:20.620 --> 06:23.540
 and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind

06:23.540 --> 06:26.200
 and with the biology of the visual system in mind.

06:26.200 --> 06:27.960
 I spent my lifetime working on the visual system

06:27.960 --> 06:30.160
 and I can tell you that your visual system has to contend

06:30.160 --> 06:32.280
 with a number of very important challenges

06:32.280 --> 06:34.620
 in order to be able to see the world around you clearly.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.680
 Things like adjusting for background illumination

06:36.680 --> 06:38.840
 so that when you go from a sunny area to a shady area,

06:38.840 --> 06:40.020
 you can see what's in front of you

06:40.020 --> 06:41.700
 still with crystal clarity.

06:41.700 --> 06:43.440
 Roca takes all of that into account

06:43.440 --> 06:45.860
 when designing their eyeglasses and sunglasses.

06:45.860 --> 06:47.040
 Their eyeglasses and sunglasses

06:47.040 --> 06:48.680
 also have some unique qualities.

06:48.680 --> 06:50.960
 For instance, because they were initially designed

06:50.960 --> 06:53.680
 for performance with things like running and cycling,

06:53.680 --> 06:55.740
 if you get sweaty, they won't fall off your face.

06:55.740 --> 06:57.380
 Also, they're extremely lightweight.

06:57.380 --> 06:58.220
 In fact, most of the time,

06:58.220 --> 07:00.040
 I don't even remember that I'm wearing them.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.120
 I wear Roca eyeglasses at night, so I wear readers

07:03.120 --> 07:04.920
 and I wear sunglasses often during the day

07:04.920 --> 07:06.920
 if it's very bright or if I'm driving.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.080
 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses,

07:09.080 --> 07:11.560
 you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com

07:11.560 --> 07:13.020
 and enter the code Huberman

07:13.020 --> 07:15.120
 to save 20% off your first order.

07:15.120 --> 07:17.600
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.360
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

07:19.360 --> 07:22.080
 that are uniquely tailored to your sleep needs.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.880
 I've talked repeatedly about the fact

07:23.880 --> 07:25.740
 that sleep is the foundation of mental health,

07:25.740 --> 07:27.380
 physical health, and performance.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.600
 So getting adequate deep sleep is absolutely essential.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.440
 Now, one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep

07:32.440 --> 07:34.620
 is to make sure that the surface that you're sleeping on

07:34.620 --> 07:36.000
 is the right one for you.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.320
 Helix understands this and they've created a sleep quiz.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.000
 That is, you go to their website

07:41.000 --> 07:43.660
 and you fill out a brief quiz that asks questions like,

07:43.660 --> 07:44.880
 do you sleep on your side, your back,

07:44.880 --> 07:46.700
 your stomach, do you tend to run hot or cold

07:46.700 --> 07:47.540
 during the night?

07:47.540 --> 07:48.360
 Maybe you don't know the answers,

07:48.360 --> 07:50.360
 in which case you simply say you don't know.

07:50.360 --> 07:53.280
 By taking that quiz, they will match you to a mattress

07:53.280 --> 07:55.600
 that is ideal for your sleep needs.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.000
 I took that quiz and I matched

07:57.000 --> 07:59.160
 to the so-called Dusk D-U-S-K mattress,

07:59.160 --> 08:01.240
 and I've been sleeping on that mattress for some time now,

08:01.240 --> 08:02.960
 and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.600
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress

08:04.600 --> 08:07.000
 to one that's uniquely tailored to your sleep needs,

08:07.000 --> 08:09.360
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

08:09.360 --> 08:10.640
 take their two minute sleep quiz,

08:10.640 --> 08:12.400
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress

08:12.400 --> 08:15.240
 and you'll get up to $200 off any mattress order

08:15.240 --> 08:16.640
 and two free pillows.

08:16.640 --> 08:17.820
 They have a 10-year warranty

08:17.820 --> 08:19.080
 and you get to try out that mattress

08:19.080 --> 08:20.720
 for 100 nights risk-free.

08:20.720 --> 08:22.560
 They'll even pick it up for if you don't love it,

08:22.560 --> 08:24.040
 but I do believe that you will love it

08:24.040 --> 08:26.440
 because you'll be sleeping far better than you have before.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.680
 Again, if you're interested,

08:27.680 --> 08:30.220
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman

08:30.220 --> 08:32.960
 to get up to $200 off and two free pillows.

08:32.960 --> 08:36.120
 And now for my discussion with Dr. Charles Zucker.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.880
 Charles, thank you so much for joining me today.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.080
 My pleasure.

08:40.080 --> 08:44.000
 I want to ask you about many things related to taste

08:44.000 --> 08:47.360
 and gustatory perception, but maybe to start off,

08:47.360 --> 08:49.540
 and because you've worked on a number of different topics

08:49.540 --> 08:51.420
 in neuroscience, not just taste,

08:52.540 --> 08:54.780
 how do you think about perception?

08:54.780 --> 08:57.640
 Or rather, I should say, how should the world

08:57.640 --> 09:00.260
 and people think about perception,

09:00.260 --> 09:02.280
 how it's different from sensation,

09:02.280 --> 09:06.240
 and what leads to our experience of life

09:06.240 --> 09:09.440
 in terms of vision, hearing, taste, et cetera?

09:09.440 --> 09:14.440
 So, you know, the brain is an extraordinary organ

09:16.660 --> 09:20.540
 that weights maybe 2% of your body mass,

09:21.840 --> 09:26.280
 yet it consumes anywhere between 25 to 30%

09:26.280 --> 09:29.780
 of all of your energy and oxygen.

09:31.640 --> 09:35.080
 And it gets transformed into a mind.

09:35.080 --> 09:40.080
 And this mind changes the human condition.

09:41.060 --> 09:45.540
 It make, it changes, it transforms, you know,

09:45.540 --> 09:50.540
 fear into courage, conformity into creativity,

09:53.040 --> 09:54.780
 sadness into happiness.

09:54.780 --> 09:57.280
 How the hell does that happen?

09:58.980 --> 10:01.740
 Now, the challenge that the brain faces

10:01.740 --> 10:05.900
 is that the world is made of real things.

10:05.900 --> 10:07.940
 You know, this here is a glass,

10:08.980 --> 10:12.100
 and this is a cord, and this is a microphone.

10:12.100 --> 10:14.820
 But the brain is only made of neurons

10:14.820 --> 10:17.580
 that only understand electrical signals.

10:18.580 --> 10:22.140
 So how do you transform that reality

10:23.300 --> 10:26.260
 into nothing but electrical signals

10:26.260 --> 10:29.800
 that now need to represent the world?

10:29.800 --> 10:34.800
 And that process is what we can operationally

10:35.840 --> 10:38.020
 define as perception.

10:39.380 --> 10:44.380
 In the senses, let's say olfactory, other, taste, vision,

10:46.120 --> 10:49.120
 you know, we can very straightforwardly separate

10:49.120 --> 10:52.360
 detection from perception.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.480
 Detection is what happens when you take a sugar molecule,

10:55.480 --> 11:00.340
 you put it in your tongue, and then a set of specific cells

11:00.340 --> 11:03.140
 now sense that sugar molecule.

11:03.140 --> 11:04.920
 That's detection.

11:04.920 --> 11:06.920
 You haven't perceived anything yet.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.300
 That is just your cells in your tongue

11:09.300 --> 11:11.840
 interacting with this chemical.

11:11.840 --> 11:13.680
 But now that cell gets activated

11:13.680 --> 11:16.200
 and sends a signal to the brain.

11:16.200 --> 11:20.180
 And now detection gets transformed into perception.

11:21.560 --> 11:25.040
 And it's trying to understand how that happens.

11:25.040 --> 11:30.040
 That's been the maniacal drive

11:31.840 --> 11:35.600
 of my entire career in neuroscience.

11:35.600 --> 11:38.660
 How does the brain ultimately transform detection

11:38.660 --> 11:43.280
 into perception so that it can guide actions and behaviors?

11:44.280 --> 11:45.520
 Does that make sense?

11:45.520 --> 11:46.520
 Absolutely.

11:46.520 --> 11:49.340
 And is a very clear and beautiful description.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.460
 A sort of high level question related to that.

11:52.460 --> 11:55.320
 And then I think we can get into some of the

11:55.320 --> 11:57.580
 intermediate steps.

11:57.580 --> 11:59.720
 I think many people would like to know whether or not

11:59.720 --> 12:02.340
 my perception of the color of your shirt

12:02.340 --> 12:04.760
 is the same as your perception of the color of your shirt.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.120
 What an excellent question.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.680
 Am I okay to interrupt you as I'm guessing

12:09.680 --> 12:10.520
 what you're going?

12:10.520 --> 12:11.360
 All right, very good.

12:11.360 --> 12:14.000
 Interruption is welcome on this podcast.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.220
 The audience will always penalize me for interrupting you

12:17.220 --> 12:19.280
 and we'll never penalize you for interrupting me.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.360
 I like the one way penalizing.

12:23.360 --> 12:26.720
 Now, given what I told you before,

12:27.840 --> 12:31.560
 that the brain is trying to represent the world

12:31.560 --> 12:35.880
 based in nothing but the transformation of these signals

12:35.880 --> 12:40.700
 into electrical, you know, languages

12:40.700 --> 12:43.800
 that now neurons have to encode and decode.

12:43.800 --> 12:48.000
 It follows that your brain is different than my brain

12:48.000 --> 12:49.560
 and therefore it follows

12:49.560 --> 12:52.560
 that the way that you're perceiving the world

12:52.560 --> 12:54.240
 must be different than mine,

12:54.240 --> 12:58.160
 even when receiving the same sensory cues, okay?

12:58.160 --> 12:59.660
 And I'll tell you about an experiment.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.740
 It's a simple experiment, yet brilliant,

13:02.740 --> 13:06.180
 that demonstrates why we perceive the world,

13:06.180 --> 13:09.540
 how we perceive the world different.

13:10.900 --> 13:15.480
 So in the world of vision, as you well know,

13:15.480 --> 13:19.360
 we have three classes of photoreceptor neurons

13:19.360 --> 13:24.360
 that sense three basic colors, red, blue, and green.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.720
 Blue, green, and red, if we go, you know,

13:29.720 --> 13:31.520
 from short to long wavelength.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.880
 And these three are sufficient

13:33.880 --> 13:36.340
 to accommodate the full visible spectra.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.680
 I'm gonna take three light projectors

13:40.680 --> 13:43.520
 and then when I project with one into a white screen,

13:43.520 --> 13:47.940
 a red light and the other one, green light,

13:47.940 --> 13:49.980
 I'm gonna overlap the two beams

13:49.980 --> 13:51.860
 and on the screen to be yellow.

13:52.940 --> 13:54.800
 Okay, this is superposition

13:54.800 --> 13:58.940
 when you have two beams of red and green.

13:58.940 --> 14:01.660
 And then I'm gonna take a third projector

14:01.660 --> 14:03.860
 and I'm gonna put a filter that projects

14:03.860 --> 14:08.860
 right next to that mixed beam, a spectrally pure yellow.

14:08.860 --> 14:13.420
 Okay, and I'm gonna ask you

14:13.420 --> 14:16.540
 to come to the red and green projectors

14:16.540 --> 14:20.220
 and play with the intensity knobs

14:20.220 --> 14:24.260
 so that you can match that yellow that you're projecting

14:24.260 --> 14:27.180
 to the spectrally pure next to it.

14:27.180 --> 14:28.320
 Is this making sense?

14:28.320 --> 14:29.160
 Perfect sense.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.260
 And I'm going to write down the numbers

14:31.260 --> 14:34.680
 in those two volume intensity knobs.

14:34.680 --> 14:39.680
 And then I'm gonna ask the next person to do the same.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.800
 And then I'm gonna ask every person

14:41.800 --> 14:46.800
 around this area of Battery Park in New York to do the same.

14:46.840 --> 14:47.980
 And guess what?

14:48.920 --> 14:49.800
 We're gonna end up

14:49.800 --> 14:53.140
 with thousands of different number combinations.

14:53.140 --> 14:54.280
 Amazing.

14:54.280 --> 14:57.720
 So for all of us, it's yellow enough

14:57.720 --> 14:59.740
 that we can use a common language.

15:01.040 --> 15:02.780
 But for every one of us,

15:02.780 --> 15:07.080
 that yellow is gonna be ever so slightly differently.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.400
 And so I think that simple psychological experiment

15:11.400 --> 15:12.640
 beautifully illustrates

15:12.640 --> 15:15.940
 how we truly perceive the world differently.

15:16.880 --> 15:18.020
 I love that example.

15:18.020 --> 15:21.200
 And yet in that example, we know the basic elements

15:21.200 --> 15:23.140
 from which color is created.

15:24.000 --> 15:27.160
 If we migrate into a slightly different sense,

15:27.160 --> 15:30.040
 let me pick a hard one, like-

15:30.040 --> 15:30.960
 Sound.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.900
 Sound or olfaction.

15:32.900 --> 15:35.640
 Very hard then to do an experiment

15:36.760 --> 15:41.480
 that will allow us to get that degree of granularity

15:41.480 --> 15:44.120
 and beautiful causality,

15:44.120 --> 15:49.120
 where we can show that A produces and leads to B.

15:49.580 --> 15:51.240
 If I give you the smell of a rose,

15:51.240 --> 15:52.720
 you can describe it to me.

15:54.280 --> 15:58.040
 If I smell the same rose, I can describe it also.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.880
 But I have no way whether the two of us

16:00.880 --> 16:03.040
 are experiencing the same.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.120
 But it's close enough that we can both

16:07.360 --> 16:10.960
 pretty much say that it has the following,

16:10.960 --> 16:14.760
 you know, features or other determinants.

16:14.760 --> 16:18.800
 But no question that your experience

16:18.800 --> 16:20.980
 is different than mine.

16:20.980 --> 16:25.360
 The fact that it's good enough for us to both survive,

16:25.360 --> 16:28.160
 that your perception of yellow and my perception of yellow,

16:28.160 --> 16:29.000
 at least up until now,

16:29.000 --> 16:32.080
 is good enough for us both to survive,

16:32.080 --> 16:35.260
 raises a thought about a statement made

16:35.260 --> 16:39.480
 by a colleague of ours, Marcus Meister at Caltech.

16:39.480 --> 16:40.760
 He's never been on this podcast,

16:40.760 --> 16:45.460
 but in a review that I read by Marcus at one point,

16:45.460 --> 16:48.320
 he said that the basic function of perception

16:48.320 --> 16:50.960
 is to divide our behavioral responses

16:50.960 --> 16:55.380
 into the outcomes downstream

16:55.380 --> 16:58.940
 of three basic emotional responses.

16:58.940 --> 17:01.400
 Yum, I like it.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.420
 Yuck, I hate it.

17:03.420 --> 17:06.440
 Or meh, whatever.

17:06.440 --> 17:07.340
 What do you think about,

17:07.340 --> 17:09.280
 I'm not looking to establish a debate

17:09.280 --> 17:11.080
 between you and Marcus without Marcus here.

17:11.080 --> 17:11.920
 I understand.

17:11.920 --> 17:16.180
 But what I like about that is that it seems like the,

17:16.180 --> 17:20.220
 we know the brain is a very economical organ in some sense,

17:20.220 --> 17:22.640
 despite its high metabolic demands.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.700
 And this variation in perception

17:25.700 --> 17:27.520
 from one individual to the next,

17:27.520 --> 17:29.920
 at once seems like a problem

17:29.920 --> 17:32.800
 because we're all literally seeing different things.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.840
 And yet we function.

17:34.840 --> 17:36.600
 We function well enough for most of us

17:36.600 --> 17:41.600
 to avoid death and cliffs and eating poisons and so forth,

17:42.560 --> 17:45.600
 and to enjoy some aspects of life, one hopes.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.400
 So is there a general statement

17:48.400 --> 17:49.720
 that we can make about the brain,

17:49.720 --> 17:52.640
 not just as a organ to generate perception,

17:52.640 --> 17:54.920
 not just as an organ to keep us alive,

17:54.920 --> 17:59.360
 but also an organ that is trying to batch our behaviors

17:59.360 --> 18:01.600
 into general categories of outcome?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.720
 I think so, but, and again,

18:03.720 --> 18:06.880
 I think the role of Marcus too.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.020
 And I think he's right that,

18:10.940 --> 18:14.800
 broadly speaking, you could categorize a lot of behaviors

18:14.800 --> 18:17.000
 falling into those two categories.

18:17.000 --> 18:21.160
 And that's 100% likely to be the case

18:21.160 --> 18:23.000
 for animals in the wild,

18:24.600 --> 18:29.600
 where the choices are not necessarily binary,

18:30.240 --> 18:33.820
 but they're very unique and distinct.

18:35.160 --> 18:37.320
 Do I wanna eat this?

18:37.320 --> 18:39.080
 Do I wanna kill that?

18:40.020 --> 18:43.000
 Do I wanna go there or do I wanna go here?

18:43.000 --> 18:48.000
 And we humans deviated from that world long ago

18:51.520 --> 18:56.320
 and learned to experience life

18:57.760 --> 19:00.960
 where we do things that we should not be doing.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.320
 Some of us more than others.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.280
 Exactly.

19:03.280 --> 19:07.480
 You know, in my own world of taste,

19:09.880 --> 19:12.440
 the likelihood that an animal in the wild

19:12.440 --> 19:15.320
 will enjoy eating something bitter,

19:17.800 --> 19:19.380
 it's inconceivable.

19:20.280 --> 19:24.400
 Yet we, you know, love tonic water.

19:25.720 --> 19:29.540
 We enjoy, we like living on the edge.

19:29.540 --> 19:32.960
 We love enjoying experiences

19:34.720 --> 19:38.880
 that makes us human.

19:38.880 --> 19:43.880
 And that goes beyond that simple set of categories,

19:44.680 --> 19:49.680
 which is yummy, yucky, ah, who cares?

19:50.360 --> 19:52.680
 And so I think it's not a bad palette,

19:52.680 --> 19:57.680
 but I think it's overly reductionist

19:58.560 --> 20:02.840
 for certainly what we humans do.

20:02.840 --> 20:03.680
 I agree.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.080
 And since we're here in New York,

20:05.080 --> 20:08.960
 I can say that the many options,

20:08.960 --> 20:13.960
 the extensive variety of food, flora, and fauna in New York

20:15.240 --> 20:18.160
 explains a lot of the more nuanced behaviors

20:18.160 --> 20:19.880
 that we observe.

20:19.880 --> 20:23.880
 Let's talk about taste because while you've done

20:23.880 --> 20:25.800
 extensive work in the field of vision,

20:25.800 --> 20:28.840
 and it's a topic that I love,

20:28.840 --> 20:32.440
 you could spend all day on, taste is fascinating.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.000
 First of all, I'd like to know why you migrated

20:35.000 --> 20:38.140
 from studying vision to studying taste.

20:38.140 --> 20:39.500
 And perhaps in that description,

20:39.500 --> 20:42.260
 you could highlight to us why we should think about

20:42.260 --> 20:44.820
 and how we should think about this sense of taste.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.240
 My goal has always been to understand,

20:48.240 --> 20:51.080
 as I highlighted before, how the brain does its magic.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.640
 You know, what part you might wonder.

20:54.640 --> 20:58.480
 Ideally, I like to help contribute to understand all of it.

21:00.200 --> 21:04.560
 You know, how do you encode and decode emotions?

21:04.560 --> 21:07.920
 How do you encode and decode memories and actions?

21:08.840 --> 21:10.860
 How do you make decisions?

21:10.860 --> 21:14.600
 How do you transform detection into perception?

21:14.600 --> 21:17.100
 And the list goes on and on.

21:19.460 --> 21:23.100
 But one of the key things in science, as you know,

21:23.960 --> 21:27.280
 is ensuring that you always ask the right question

21:27.280 --> 21:31.280
 so that you have a possibility of answering it.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.960
 Because if the question cannot be tractable

21:33.960 --> 21:36.680
 or reduced to an experimental path

21:36.680 --> 21:38.920
 that helps you resolve it,

21:38.920 --> 21:42.120
 then we end up doing some really fun science,

21:42.120 --> 21:45.560
 but not necessarily answering the important problem

21:45.560 --> 21:46.840
 that we want to study.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.160
 Make sense?

21:49.160 --> 21:50.000
 All right.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.840
 From a first person perspective, yes.

21:52.840 --> 21:55.800
 The hardest question, the most important question is,

21:55.800 --> 21:58.080
 what question are you going to try and answer?

21:58.080 --> 22:01.400
 What question are you going to try and answer?

22:01.400 --> 22:02.320
 And so, for example,

22:02.320 --> 22:06.980
 I will have to understand the neural basis of empathy.

22:09.160 --> 22:10.800
 It's a big market for that.

22:10.800 --> 22:13.120
 100%, but I wouldn't even know.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.760
 I mean, at the molecular level, that's what we do.

22:15.760 --> 22:20.540
 How do the circuits in your brain create that sense?

22:20.540 --> 22:23.360
 I have no clue how to do it.

22:23.360 --> 22:25.160
 I can come up with ways to think about it,

22:25.160 --> 22:29.520
 but I like to understand what in your brain

22:29.520 --> 22:31.840
 makes someone a great philanthropist.

22:33.080 --> 22:35.760
 What is the neural basis of love?

22:37.080 --> 22:40.320
 I wouldn't even know where to begin.

22:40.320 --> 22:42.680
 So if I want to begin to study these questions

22:42.680 --> 22:44.920
 about brain function,

22:44.920 --> 22:48.760
 that can cover so many aspects of the brain,

22:48.760 --> 22:52.920
 I need to choose a problem that affords me that window.

22:52.920 --> 22:56.860
 But in a way that I can ask questions that give me answers.

22:57.760 --> 23:02.760
 And among the senses that have the capacity

23:03.080 --> 23:06.200
 of transforming detection into perception

23:06.200 --> 23:11.000
 of being stories, memories, of creating emotions,

23:11.000 --> 23:15.800
 of giving you different actions and perceptions

23:15.800 --> 23:18.520
 as a function of the internal state.

23:18.520 --> 23:21.040
 When you're hungry, things taste very differently

23:21.040 --> 23:22.680
 than when you're sated.

23:22.680 --> 23:24.240
 How, why?

23:24.240 --> 23:27.080
 When you taste something, you now remember

23:27.080 --> 23:30.040
 this amazing meal you had with your first date.

23:30.040 --> 23:31.280
 How does that happen?

23:31.280 --> 23:35.080
 All right, so if I want to begin to explore

23:35.080 --> 23:37.980
 all of these things that the brain does,

23:39.080 --> 23:43.140
 I felt I have to choose a sensory system

23:43.140 --> 23:48.140
 that affords some degree of simplicity

23:48.140 --> 23:53.140
 in the way that the input-output relationships

23:53.380 --> 23:56.700
 are put together, and in a way that still can be used

23:56.700 --> 23:59.140
 to ask every one of these problems

23:59.140 --> 24:03.140
 that the brain has to ultimately compute, encode,

24:03.140 --> 24:04.040
 and decode.

24:05.660 --> 24:08.380
 And what was remarkable about the taste system

24:08.380 --> 24:10.880
 at the time that I began working on this,

24:10.880 --> 24:15.880
 is that nothing was known about the molecular basis of taste.

24:18.680 --> 24:22.600
 We knew that we could taste what has been usually defined

24:22.600 --> 24:25.840
 as the basic taste qualities,

24:25.840 --> 24:30.840
 sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.

24:31.680 --> 24:36.360
 Umami is a Japanese word that means yummy, delicious.

24:36.360 --> 24:39.800
 And that's nearly every animal species

24:39.800 --> 24:42.200
 the taste of amino acids.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.480
 And in humans, it's mostly associated

24:45.480 --> 24:48.620
 with the taste of MSG, monosodium glutamate,

24:48.620 --> 24:50.840
 one amino acid in particular.

24:50.840 --> 24:52.640
 What are, just by way of example,

24:52.640 --> 24:57.600
 some foods that are rich in the umami-evoking stimulation?

24:57.600 --> 25:02.160
 Seaweed, tomatoes, cheese.

25:02.160 --> 25:06.480
 And it's a great, great flavor enhancer.

25:06.480 --> 25:10.040
 It enriches our sensory experience.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.920
 And so the beautiful thing of the system

25:11.920 --> 25:16.100
 is that the lines of input are limited to five.

25:17.960 --> 25:20.200
 You know, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami.

25:20.200 --> 25:24.600
 And each of them has a predetermined meaning.

25:24.600 --> 25:29.480
 You are born liking sugar and disliking bitter.

25:29.480 --> 25:31.560
 You have no choice.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.040
 These are hardwired systems.

25:34.040 --> 25:39.040
 But of course, you can learn to dislike sugar

25:39.160 --> 25:41.720
 and to like bitters.

25:41.720 --> 25:45.620
 But in the wild, let's take humans out of the question.

25:46.660 --> 25:50.520
 These are 100% predetermined.

25:50.520 --> 25:55.520
 You're born with that specific valence value

25:56.360 --> 26:01.360
 for each taste of sweet, umami, and low salt

26:01.360 --> 26:04.200
 are attractive taste qualities.

26:05.300 --> 26:08.960
 They evoke appetitive responses, I want to consume them.

26:10.280 --> 26:14.840
 And bitter and sour are innately

26:14.840 --> 26:18.080
 predetermined to be aversive.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.480
 Could I interrupt you just briefly

26:19.480 --> 26:22.600
 and ask a question about that exact point?

26:22.600 --> 26:24.760
 For something to be appetitive to,

26:24.760 --> 26:28.180
 and some other taste to be aversive,

26:28.180 --> 26:30.540
 and for those to be hardwired,

26:30.540 --> 26:35.280
 can we assume that the sensation of very bitter,

26:35.280 --> 26:37.880
 or of activation of bitter receptors in the mouth

26:38.800 --> 26:43.300
 activates a neural circuit that causes closing of the mouth,

26:43.300 --> 26:46.480
 retraction of the tongue, and retraction of the body,

26:46.480 --> 26:48.200
 and that the taste of something sweet

26:48.200 --> 26:50.920
 might actually induce more licking?

26:50.920 --> 26:53.280
 100%, you got it.

26:53.280 --> 26:56.800
 The activation of the receptors in the tongue

26:56.800 --> 26:59.400
 that recognize sweet versus the ones

26:59.400 --> 27:04.260
 that recognize bitter activate an entire behavioral program.

27:05.280 --> 27:10.320
 And that program that we can refer as appetitiveness

27:10.320 --> 27:15.320
 or aversion, it's composed of many different subroutines.

27:16.480 --> 27:19.280
 In the case of bitter, it's very easy

27:19.280 --> 27:22.960
 to actually look at, see them happening in animals

27:22.960 --> 27:25.680
 because the first thing you do is you stop licking,

27:25.680 --> 27:30.680
 then you put unhappy face, then you squint your eyes,

27:30.800 --> 27:33.800
 and then you start gagging, right?

27:33.800 --> 27:37.160
 And that entire thing happens by the activation

27:37.160 --> 27:41.120
 of a bitter molecule in a bitter sensing cell in your tongue.

27:41.120 --> 27:41.960
 It's incredible.

27:41.960 --> 27:44.720
 It's, again, the magic of the brain,

27:44.720 --> 27:48.980
 you know, how it's able to encode and decode

27:48.980 --> 27:51.320
 these extraordinary actions and behaviors

27:51.320 --> 27:53.480
 in response of nothing but a simple,

27:53.480 --> 27:58.480
 very, you know, unique sensory stimuli.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.560
 Now, let me say that this palette of five basic tastes

28:02.560 --> 28:06.000
 accommodates all the dietary needs of the organism.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.220
 Sweet to ensure that we get the right amount of energy.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.800
 Umami to ensure that we get proteins

28:14.800 --> 28:16.460
 and that essential nutrient.

28:17.360 --> 28:19.440
 Salt, the three appetitive ones,

28:19.440 --> 28:23.840
 ensure that we maintain our electrolyte balance.

28:23.840 --> 28:28.120
 Bitter to prevent the ingestion of toxic, nauseous chemicals.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.520
 Nearly all bitter tasting, you know,

28:30.520 --> 28:33.360
 things out in the wild are bad for you.

28:34.220 --> 28:39.220
 And sour, most likely to prevent the ingestion of spoiled,

28:39.280 --> 28:42.960
 acid, fermented foods.

28:43.880 --> 28:44.720
 And that's it.

28:44.720 --> 28:48.200
 That is the palette that we deal with.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.540
 Now, of course, there's a difference

28:49.540 --> 28:52.640
 between basic taste and flavor.

28:53.680 --> 28:55.800
 Flavor is the whole experience.

28:55.800 --> 29:00.360
 Flavor is the combination of multiple tastes coming together

29:00.360 --> 29:05.360
 together with smell, with texture, with temperature,

29:05.760 --> 29:08.840
 with the look of it that gives you what you and I

29:08.840 --> 29:11.440
 would call the full sensory experience.

29:11.440 --> 29:15.640
 But we scientists need to reduce the problem

29:15.640 --> 29:19.880
 into its basic elements so we can begin to break it apart

29:19.880 --> 29:21.780
 before we put it back together.

29:21.780 --> 29:25.120
 So when we think about the sense of taste

29:25.120 --> 29:29.200
 and we try to figure out how these lines of information

29:29.200 --> 29:30.880
 go from your tongue to your brain

29:30.880 --> 29:33.600
 and how they signal and how they get integrated

29:33.600 --> 29:36.560
 and how they trigger all these different behaviors,

29:36.560 --> 29:39.480
 we look at them as individual qualities.

29:39.480 --> 29:41.960
 So we give the animal sweet or we give them a bitter,

29:41.960 --> 29:46.360
 we give them sour, we avoid mixes

29:46.360 --> 29:51.360
 because the first stage of discovery

29:51.400 --> 29:56.120
 is to have that clarity as to what you're trying to extract

29:56.120 --> 29:59.560
 so that you can hopefully meaningfully make a difference

29:59.560 --> 30:02.880
 by being able to figure out how is it

30:02.880 --> 30:06.080
 that A goes to B to C and to D.

30:06.080 --> 30:06.920
 Does this make sense?

30:06.920 --> 30:08.600
 Yeah, almost like the primary colors

30:08.600 --> 30:11.360
 to create the full array of the color spectrum.

30:11.360 --> 30:12.780
 Exactly.

30:12.780 --> 30:16.280
 Before I ask you about the first and second and third stages

30:16.280 --> 30:18.660
 of taste and flavor perception,

30:18.660 --> 30:22.720
 is there any idea that there may be more than five?

30:22.720 --> 30:25.180
 There is, for example.

30:25.180 --> 30:27.100
 What about fat?

30:27.100 --> 30:28.160
 I love the taste.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.000
 I love fat too.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.520
 And I love the texture of fat,

30:30.520 --> 30:32.720
 especially if it's slightly burnt.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.240
 In South America, when I visited Buenos Aires,

30:36.240 --> 30:38.760
 I found that at the end of a meal, they would take a steak,

30:38.760 --> 30:40.720
 the trimming off the edge of the steak,

30:40.720 --> 30:44.080
 burn it slightly, and then serve it back to me.

30:44.080 --> 30:46.320
 And I thought, that's disgusting.

30:46.320 --> 30:49.080
 And then I tasted it, and it's delightful.

30:49.080 --> 30:49.920
 It is.

30:49.920 --> 30:51.880
 There's nothing quite like it.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.680
 This goes back to this notion before

30:53.680 --> 30:56.400
 that we like to live on the edge, yeah?

30:56.400 --> 30:59.440
 And we like to do things that we should not be doing, Andrew.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.440
 But on the other hand, look at those muscles.

31:03.440 --> 31:08.440
 The, I don't suggest anyone eat pure fat.

31:08.800 --> 31:10.440
 The listeners of this podcast will immediately,

31:10.440 --> 31:12.240
 I'm sure there'll be a YouTube video soon

31:12.240 --> 31:13.600
 that I like eating pure fat.

31:13.600 --> 31:15.920
 I'm not in on a ketogenic diet, et cetera.

31:15.920 --> 31:19.520
 But fat is tasty.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.360
 It is.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.760
 As evidenced by the obesity problem

31:22.760 --> 31:23.600
 that exists in this country.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.400
 We'll talk about that in a little bit

31:25.400 --> 31:27.800
 about the gut brain axis.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.040
 I think it'll be important to cover it

31:30.040 --> 31:32.620
 because it's the other side of the taste system.

31:34.360 --> 31:38.600
 And so missing tastes, one is fat.

31:38.600 --> 31:42.440
 Although, like you clearly highlighted,

31:42.440 --> 31:46.520
 a lot of fat taste, in quotation marks,

31:46.520 --> 31:51.520
 is really the feeling of fat rolling on your tongue.

31:52.960 --> 31:57.760
 And so there is a compelling argument

31:57.760 --> 32:00.640
 that a lot of what we call fat taste

32:01.760 --> 32:04.580
 is really mechanosensory.

32:04.580 --> 32:08.020
 It's somatosensory cells,

32:08.020 --> 32:10.780
 cells that are not responding to taste,

32:10.780 --> 32:14.260
 but they're responding to mechanical stimulation

32:14.260 --> 32:17.020
 of fat molecules rolling on the tongue

32:17.020 --> 32:19.540
 that gives you that perception of fat.

32:20.380 --> 32:23.060
 I love the idea that there is a perception of fat

32:23.060 --> 32:24.140
 regardless of whether or not

32:24.140 --> 32:27.100
 there's a dedicated receptor for fat.

32:27.100 --> 32:31.300
 Mostly because it's evoking sensations and imagery

32:31.300 --> 32:34.420
 of the taste of slightly burnt fat.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.940
 For example, and another one,

32:36.940 --> 32:39.500
 you could argue it's metallic taste.

32:39.500 --> 32:41.380
 I know exactly what it tastes like.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.800
 If you ask me to explain it, I will have a hard time.

32:48.060 --> 32:50.460
 What are the palettes of that color

32:50.460 --> 32:54.700
 that can allow me to define it, I wouldn't be easy,

32:54.700 --> 32:56.860
 but I know precisely what it tastes like.

32:56.860 --> 32:59.700
 Take a penny, put it in your mouth,

32:59.700 --> 33:01.420
 and you know what it tastes like, yeah?

33:01.420 --> 33:04.580
 Or blood, that's another very good example.

33:05.780 --> 33:10.140
 And is there really a receptor for metallic taste,

33:10.140 --> 33:13.260
 or it's nothing but this magical combination

33:13.260 --> 33:16.740
 of the activation of the existing lines.

33:16.740 --> 33:19.340
 Think of it as lines of information, just separate lines,

33:19.340 --> 33:21.640
 by the keys of a piano, yeah?

33:21.640 --> 33:23.460
 Sweet, sour, bitter, salty, umami,

33:23.460 --> 33:26.620
 you play the key and you activate that one chord.

33:26.620 --> 33:28.700
 And that one chord in the case of a piano

33:28.700 --> 33:31.780
 leads to a note, you know, a tune,

33:31.780 --> 33:34.740
 and in the case of taste, leads to an action and a behavior.

33:35.940 --> 33:38.900
 But you play many of them together and something emerges

33:38.900 --> 33:42.900
 that it's different than any one of the pieces.

33:44.700 --> 33:48.300
 And it's possible that metallic, for example,

33:48.300 --> 33:50.980
 represents the combination of the activity

33:50.980 --> 33:55.980
 just in the right ratio of these added lines.

33:55.980 --> 33:59.340
 It makes sense, and it actually provides a perfect,

33:59.340 --> 34:01.580
 your example of the piano provides a perfect segue

34:01.580 --> 34:04.320
 for what I'd like to touch on next,

34:04.320 --> 34:08.580
 which is if you would describe the sequence

34:08.580 --> 34:13.220
 of neural events leading to a perceptual event of taste.

34:13.220 --> 34:15.580
 And I'm certain that somewhere in there

34:16.540 --> 34:19.100
 you will embed an answer to the question

34:19.100 --> 34:22.580
 of whether or not we indeed have different taste receptors

34:22.580 --> 34:26.180
 distributed in different locations on our tongue

34:26.180 --> 34:27.540
 or elsewhere in the mouth.

34:27.540 --> 34:32.540
 Yes, so let's start by debunking that old tale and myth.

34:36.060 --> 34:37.220
 Who came up with that?

34:38.820 --> 34:41.820
 There are many views, but the most prevalent

34:41.820 --> 34:45.940
 is that there was an original drawing

34:45.940 --> 34:50.940
 describing the sensitivity of the tongue to different tastes.

34:50.940 --> 34:54.300
 So imagine I can take a Q-tip.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.580
 This is a thought experiment, yeah?

34:56.580 --> 35:01.580
 And I'm gonna dip that Q-tip in salt and in quinine

35:01.580 --> 35:04.580
 or something bitter and glucose or something sweet.

35:05.460 --> 35:07.620
 And I'm gonna take that Q-tip,

35:07.620 --> 35:10.260
 ask you to stick your tongue out

35:10.260 --> 35:12.140
 and start moving it around your tongue

35:12.140 --> 35:14.340
 and ask you what do you feel.

35:16.540 --> 35:19.260
 And then I'm going to change the concentration

35:19.260 --> 35:23.460
 of the amount of salt or the amount of bitter

35:23.460 --> 35:27.140
 and ask can I get some sort of a map of sensitivity

35:27.140 --> 35:28.740
 to the different tastes, yeah?

35:30.540 --> 35:32.940
 And the argument that has emerged

35:32.940 --> 35:35.060
 is that there is a good likelihood

35:35.060 --> 35:38.820
 that the data was simply mistranslated

35:38.820 --> 35:40.500
 as it was being drawn.

35:42.340 --> 35:45.340
 And of course that led to an entire industry.

35:45.340 --> 35:49.180
 This is the way you maximize your one-to-one.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.580
 Why in experience?

35:51.580 --> 35:55.380
 Because now we're going to form the vessel

35:55.380 --> 35:56.740
 that you're gonna drink from

35:56.740 --> 36:00.420
 so that it acts maximally on the receptors which happen.

36:00.420 --> 36:05.420
 All right, now there is no tongue map, all right?

36:07.900 --> 36:12.340
 We have taste buds distributed in various parts of the tongue

36:12.340 --> 36:17.340
 so there is a map on the distribution of taste buds.

36:17.340 --> 36:22.300
 But each taste bud has around 100 taste receptor cells

36:22.300 --> 36:25.820
 and those taste receptor cells can be of five types,

36:27.820 --> 36:31.020
 sweet, sour, bitter, salty or umami.

36:31.020 --> 36:33.460
 And for the most part,

36:35.100 --> 36:38.180
 all taste buds have the representation

36:38.180 --> 36:41.140
 of all five taste qualities.

36:41.140 --> 36:43.620
 Now there's no question that there is a slight bias

36:43.620 --> 36:44.780
 for some tastes.

36:44.780 --> 36:48.300
 Like bitter is particularly enriched

36:48.300 --> 36:50.100
 at the very back of your tongue.

36:51.020 --> 36:53.300
 And there is a teleological basis for that

36:53.300 --> 36:56.020
 and actually a biological basis for that.

36:56.020 --> 36:57.820
 That's the last line of defense

36:57.820 --> 37:00.020
 before you swallow something bad.

37:01.660 --> 37:05.060
 And so let's make sure that the very back of your tongue

37:05.060 --> 37:08.500
 has plenty of these bad news receptors

37:09.420 --> 37:11.340
 so that if they get activated,

37:11.340 --> 37:16.340
 you can trigger a gagging reflex and get rid of this

37:16.500 --> 37:18.940
 that otherwise may kill you, okay?

37:18.940 --> 37:19.780
 That's good sense.

37:19.780 --> 37:23.700
 But the notion that all sweet is in the front

37:23.700 --> 37:28.700
 and salt is on the side, it's not real.

37:30.740 --> 37:31.860
 And there, go ahead.

37:31.860 --> 37:33.620
 Oh, I was just going to ask, are there,

37:33.620 --> 37:36.340
 first of all, thank you for dispelling that myth

37:36.340 --> 37:38.340
 and we will propagate that information

37:38.340 --> 37:40.260
 as far and wide as we can

37:40.260 --> 37:43.340
 because I think that's the number one myth related to taste.

37:43.340 --> 37:46.780
 The other one is, are there taste receptors anywhere else

37:46.780 --> 37:49.380
 in the mouth, for instance, on the lips?

37:49.380 --> 37:50.620
 The palate, not the lips.

37:50.620 --> 37:54.380
 So it's in the far range at the very back

37:54.380 --> 37:58.580
 of the oral cavity, the tongue and the palate.

37:58.580 --> 38:02.300
 And the palate is very rich in sweet receptors.

38:02.300 --> 38:03.460
 I'll have to pay attention to this

38:03.460 --> 38:05.220
 the next time I eat something sweet.

38:05.220 --> 38:07.500
 Whether you pull it up, yeah?

38:07.500 --> 38:12.500
 Now, the important thing is that, you know,

38:13.220 --> 38:16.700
 after the receptors for these five,

38:16.700 --> 38:19.900
 the detectors, the molecules that sends

38:19.900 --> 38:22.220
 sweet sour beet and salt to mommy,

38:22.220 --> 38:25.300
 these are receptors, proteins found on the surface

38:25.300 --> 38:29.300
 of taste receptor cells that interact with these chemicals.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.100
 And once they interact, then they trigger

38:31.100 --> 38:35.740
 the cascade of events, biochemical events inside the cell

38:35.740 --> 38:39.580
 that now sends an electrical signal that says,

38:39.580 --> 38:43.060
 there is sweet here, or there is salt here.

38:43.060 --> 38:46.500
 Now having these receptors and my laboratory identify

38:46.500 --> 38:49.620
 the receptors for all five basic taste classes,

38:49.620 --> 38:52.860
 sweet, bitter, salt, to mommy, and most recently sour,

38:54.140 --> 38:55.540
 now completing the palate,

38:55.540 --> 38:58.300
 you can now use these receptors to really map

38:58.300 --> 39:02.660
 where are they found in the tongue in a very rigorous way.

39:02.660 --> 39:05.180
 This is no longer about using a Q-tip

39:05.180 --> 39:09.260
 and trying to figure out what you're feeling,

39:09.260 --> 39:12.140
 but rather what you have in your tongue.

39:13.660 --> 39:18.620
 This is not a guess, this is now a physical map

39:18.620 --> 39:22.500
 that says the sweet receptors are found here.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.780
 The bitter are found here, and when you do that,

39:24.780 --> 39:28.140
 you find that in fact, every taste pad

39:28.140 --> 39:32.260
 throughout your oral cavity has receptors

39:32.260 --> 39:35.220
 for all of the basic taste classes.

39:35.220 --> 39:36.460
 Amazing.

39:36.460 --> 39:38.980
 And as it turns out, and I'm sure you'll tell us,

39:38.980 --> 39:41.620
 important in terms of thinking about how the brain

39:42.580 --> 39:46.180
 computes and codes and decodes this thing we call taste.

39:46.180 --> 39:47.980
 I'm going to inject a quick question

39:47.980 --> 39:50.060
 that I'm sure is on many people's minds

39:50.060 --> 39:52.820
 before we get back into the biological circuit,

39:52.820 --> 39:54.940
 which is many people, including myself,

39:54.940 --> 39:57.740
 are familiar with the experience of drinking a sip of tea

39:57.740 --> 40:01.940
 or coffee that is too hot, and burning my tongue

40:01.940 --> 40:03.380
 is the way I would describe it.

40:03.380 --> 40:04.220
 Horrible.

40:04.220 --> 40:06.140
 And then disrupting my sense of taste

40:06.140 --> 40:07.860
 for some period of time afterward.

40:07.860 --> 40:08.780
 Yes.

40:08.780 --> 40:12.020
 When I experienced that phenomenon,

40:12.020 --> 40:13.540
 that unfortunate phenomenon,

40:13.540 --> 40:17.180
 have I destroyed taste receptors that regenerate,

40:18.020 --> 40:20.620
 or have I somehow used temperature

40:20.620 --> 40:22.540
 to distort the function of the circuit

40:22.540 --> 40:26.100
 so that I no longer taste the way I did before?

40:26.100 --> 40:29.100
 Excellent question, and the answer is both.

40:29.100 --> 40:32.620
 It turns out that your taste receptors

40:32.620 --> 40:35.100
 only leave for around two weeks.

40:36.540 --> 40:38.340
 And this, by the way, makes sense

40:38.340 --> 40:41.180
 because here you have an organ, the tongue,

40:43.340 --> 40:46.620
 that is continuously exposed to everything

40:46.620 --> 40:48.140
 you could range from the nicest

40:48.140 --> 40:50.220
 to the most horrible possible things.

40:50.220 --> 40:51.500
 Use your imagination.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.780
 And so,

40:55.540 --> 40:57.460
 you need to make sure that these cells

40:57.460 --> 40:59.580
 are always coming back in a way

40:59.580 --> 41:03.060
 that I can re-experience the world in the right way.

41:03.060 --> 41:04.940
 And there are other organs

41:04.940 --> 41:08.980
 that have the same underlying logic, okay?

41:08.980 --> 41:11.380
 Your gut, your intestines are the same way.

41:11.380 --> 41:12.620
 Yeah, amazing.

41:12.620 --> 41:16.580
 Again, they're receiving everything that you ingest,

41:16.580 --> 41:18.540
 God forbid what's there,

41:19.740 --> 41:22.180
 from the spiciest, you know,

41:22.180 --> 41:25.820
 to the most horrible tasting, so the most delicious.

41:25.820 --> 41:28.180
 And again, those intestinal cells

41:28.180 --> 41:32.860
 whose role is to ultimately take all these nutrients

41:32.860 --> 41:34.940
 and bring them into the body,

41:34.940 --> 41:39.940
 also renewal in a very, very fast cycle.

41:43.540 --> 41:46.220
 Olfactory neurons in your nose is the other example.

41:47.940 --> 41:51.660
 So then, A, yes, you're burning a lot of your cells

41:51.660 --> 41:54.700
 and it's over for those.

41:54.700 --> 41:57.500
 The good news is that they're gonna come back.

41:57.500 --> 41:59.660
 But we know that when you burn your cell with tea,

41:59.660 --> 42:01.420
 they come back, you know,

42:01.420 --> 42:05.020
 within 20 minutes, 30 minutes, an hour.

42:05.020 --> 42:09.580
 And these cells are not renewing in that timeframe.

42:09.580 --> 42:11.540
 They're not listening to your needs.

42:11.540 --> 42:13.660
 They have their own internal clock.

42:16.220 --> 42:21.220
 And so, you are really affecting,

42:21.220 --> 42:25.540
 you're damaging them in a way that they can recover.

42:26.660 --> 42:27.780
 And then they come back

42:27.780 --> 42:30.380
 and you also damage your somatosensory cells.

42:30.380 --> 42:35.300
 These are the cells that feel things, not taste things.

42:36.900 --> 42:39.820
 And then, you know, you wait half an hour or so,

42:39.820 --> 42:44.500
 and then, my goodness, thank God, it's back to normal.

42:44.500 --> 42:47.500
 And most of the time, I don't even notice the transition,

42:47.500 --> 42:49.140
 realizing, as you tell me,

42:49.140 --> 42:51.660
 and later, I'll ask you about the relationship

42:51.660 --> 42:54.740
 between odor and taste.

42:54.740 --> 42:58.900
 But as a next step along the circuit,

42:58.900 --> 43:00.700
 let's assume I ingest some,

43:00.700 --> 43:03.220
 let's keep it simple, a sweet taste.

43:03.220 --> 43:06.580
 Let's make it even simpler,

43:07.700 --> 43:11.460
 but at the same time, perhaps more informative.

43:11.460 --> 43:15.060
 Let's compare and contrast sweet and bitter

43:15.060 --> 43:19.220
 as we follow their lines from the tongue to the brain.

43:20.220 --> 43:22.540
 So, the first thing is that the two evoke

43:22.540 --> 43:25.100
 diametrically opposed behaviors.

43:25.100 --> 43:28.300
 If we have to come up with two sensory experience

43:28.300 --> 43:31.300
 that represent polar opposites, it will be sweet and bitter.

43:31.300 --> 43:33.700
 There are not two colors that represent polar opposites

43:33.700 --> 43:35.700
 because, you know, you could say black and white,

43:35.700 --> 43:37.900
 they are polar opposites, one detects only one thing,

43:37.900 --> 43:39.540
 the other one detects everything.

43:40.580 --> 43:44.900
 But they don't evoke different behaviors,

43:44.900 --> 43:47.380
 even political parties have some over them.

43:48.620 --> 43:51.020
 Sweet and bitter are the two opposite ends

43:51.020 --> 43:52.460
 of the sensory spectra.

43:53.580 --> 43:58.580
 Now, a taste can be defined by two features.

44:00.980 --> 44:03.700
 Again, I'm a reductionist, so I'm reducing it

44:03.700 --> 44:07.700
 in a way that I think is easier to follow the signal.

44:07.700 --> 44:12.700
 And the two features are its quality and its valence.

44:12.700 --> 44:17.420
 And valence with a little V, that's what we say in Spanish,

44:17.420 --> 44:22.420
 with a V, yeah, means the value of that experience.

44:25.620 --> 44:26.700
 All right?

44:26.700 --> 44:29.740
 Or in this case of that stimuli.

44:29.740 --> 44:34.740
 And you take sweet, sweet has a quality, an identity,

44:36.260 --> 44:38.300
 and that's what you and I will refer to

44:38.300 --> 44:40.140
 as the taste of sweet.

44:40.140 --> 44:42.820
 We know exactly what it tastes like.

44:43.820 --> 44:47.220
 But sweet also has a positive valence,

44:49.140 --> 44:52.940
 which makes it incredibly attractive and appetitive.

44:52.940 --> 44:55.020
 But it's attractive and appetitive,

44:55.020 --> 44:56.380
 as I'll tell you in a second,

44:56.380 --> 45:00.420
 independent of its identity and quality.

45:00.420 --> 45:03.940
 In fact, we have been able to engineer animals

45:03.940 --> 45:07.780
 where we completely remove the valence from the stimuli.

45:07.780 --> 45:10.460
 So these animals can taste sweet,

45:10.460 --> 45:15.460
 can recognize it as sweet, but it's no longer attractive.

45:16.340 --> 45:19.140
 It's just one more chemical stimuli.

45:20.100 --> 45:23.980
 And that's because the identity and the valence

45:23.980 --> 45:26.820
 are encoded in two separate parts of the brain.

45:28.260 --> 45:33.100
 In the case of bitter, again, it has, on the one hand,

45:33.100 --> 45:35.140
 its identity, its quality.

45:35.140 --> 45:37.540
 And you know exactly what bitter tastes like.

45:37.540 --> 45:41.420
 I can taste it now, even as you describe it.

45:41.420 --> 45:45.220
 But it also has a valence, and that's a negative valence,

45:45.220 --> 45:48.740
 because it evokes aversive behaviors.

45:50.060 --> 45:50.900
 Are we on?

45:50.900 --> 45:51.740
 Absolutely.

45:51.740 --> 45:52.580
 All right.

45:52.580 --> 45:54.060
 And it comes to mind, I remember telling some kids recently

45:54.060 --> 45:55.260
 that we're going to go get ice cream,

45:55.260 --> 45:56.100
 and it was interesting.

45:56.100 --> 45:57.740
 They looked up and they started smacking their lip,

45:57.740 --> 46:00.500
 like, you know, they'll actually evoke-

46:00.500 --> 46:03.860
 The anticipatory response, absolutely.

46:04.820 --> 46:07.300
 When we talk about the gut brain, maybe we'll get there.

46:07.300 --> 46:10.860
 So then the signals, if we follow now these two lines,

46:10.860 --> 46:13.100
 they're really like two separate keys

46:13.100 --> 46:15.340
 at the two ends of this keyboard.

46:16.660 --> 46:21.180
 And you press one key and you activate this cord.

46:21.180 --> 46:25.100
 So you activate the sweet cells throughout your oral cavity

46:25.100 --> 46:29.260
 and they all converge into a group of sweet neurons

46:29.260 --> 46:34.260
 in the next station, which is still outside the brain,

46:34.260 --> 46:37.060
 the brain is one of the taste ganglia.

46:38.100 --> 46:40.940
 These are the neurons that innervate your tongue

46:40.940 --> 46:42.580
 and the oral cavity.

46:42.580 --> 46:43.820
 Where do they sit approximately?

46:43.820 --> 46:44.660
 Around there.

46:44.660 --> 46:47.220
 Yeah, right here around the lymph nodes, more or less.

46:47.220 --> 46:48.060
 You got it.

46:49.140 --> 46:54.100
 And there are two main ganglia that innervate

46:54.100 --> 46:59.100
 the vast majority of all taste buds in the oral cavity.

46:59.260 --> 47:02.540
 And then from there, that sweet signal

47:02.540 --> 47:04.740
 goes onto the brainstem.

47:04.740 --> 47:08.860
 The brainstem is the entry of the body into the brain.

47:10.060 --> 47:12.940
 And there are different areas of the brainstem

47:12.940 --> 47:15.740
 and there are different groups of neurons in the brainstem.

47:15.740 --> 47:17.620
 And there's this unique area,

47:17.620 --> 47:22.620
 in a unique topographically defined location

47:26.140 --> 47:29.340
 in the rostral side of the brainstem

47:29.340 --> 47:32.660
 that receives all of the taste input.

47:32.660 --> 47:34.500
 A very dense area of the brain.

47:34.500 --> 47:38.980
 A very rich area of the brain, exactly.

47:38.980 --> 47:42.740
 And from there, the sweet signal goes to this other area

47:42.740 --> 47:45.540
 higher up on the brainstem.

47:46.900 --> 47:50.980
 And then it goes through a number of stations

47:50.980 --> 47:54.020
 where that sweet signal goes from sweet neuron

47:54.020 --> 47:56.780
 to sweet neuron to sweet neuron

47:56.780 --> 48:00.220
 to eventually get to your cortex.

48:00.220 --> 48:03.100
 And once it gets to your taste cortex,

48:03.100 --> 48:08.100
 that's where meaning is imposed into that signal.

48:08.540 --> 48:13.540
 It's then, and only then, this is what the data suggests,

48:15.460 --> 48:20.460
 that now you can identify this as a sweet stimuli.

48:20.700 --> 48:22.580
 And how quickly does that all happen?

48:22.580 --> 48:27.580
 You know, the timescale of the nervous system, it's fast.

48:30.260 --> 48:31.100
 And so-

48:31.100 --> 48:32.060
 Within less than a second.

48:32.060 --> 48:33.620
 Yeah, absolutely, yeah.

48:33.620 --> 48:36.460
 I rarely mistake bitter for sweet.

48:36.460 --> 48:39.420
 Maybe with respect to people and my own poor judgment,

48:39.420 --> 48:41.940
 but not with respect to taste.

48:41.940 --> 48:44.700
 Yeah, and in fact, we can demonstrate this

48:44.700 --> 48:46.820
 because we can stick electrodes

48:46.820 --> 48:50.340
 at each of these stations conceptually, yeah?

48:50.340 --> 48:51.940
 And we can stimulate the tongue

48:51.940 --> 48:53.900
 and then we can record the signals

48:53.900 --> 48:57.380
 pretty much time log to stimulus delivery.

48:57.380 --> 48:58.860
 You deliver the stimuli

48:58.860 --> 49:00.500
 and within a fraction of a second,

49:01.460 --> 49:05.660
 you see now the response in these following stations.

49:05.660 --> 49:08.060
 Now it gets to the cortex here.

49:08.060 --> 49:12.580
 And now in there, you impose meaning to that taste.

49:12.580 --> 49:14.900
 There's an area of your brain

49:14.900 --> 49:19.900
 that represents the taste of sweet in taste cortex

49:19.900 --> 49:24.900
 and a different area that represents the taste of bitter.

49:25.500 --> 49:27.580
 In essence, there is a topographic map

49:28.500 --> 49:30.820
 of these taste qualities inside your brain.

49:32.500 --> 49:35.700
 Now we're gonna do a thought experiment, all right?

49:35.700 --> 49:39.100
 Now, if this group of neurons in your cortex

49:39.100 --> 49:41.380
 really represents the sense of sweet

49:42.420 --> 49:45.500
 and this added different group of neurons in your brain

49:45.500 --> 49:50.500
 represents the taste, the perception of bitter,

49:53.180 --> 49:55.820
 then we should be able to do two things.

49:55.820 --> 49:58.780
 First, I should be able to go into your brain,

49:58.780 --> 50:03.020
 somehow silence those neurons,

50:03.020 --> 50:06.500
 find a way to prevent them from being activated

50:07.620 --> 50:09.900
 and I can give you all the sweet you want

50:09.900 --> 50:12.380
 and you'll never know that you're tasting sweet.

50:12.380 --> 50:17.380
 And conversely, I should be able to go into your brain,

50:18.260 --> 50:21.700
 come up with a way to activate those neurons

50:21.700 --> 50:25.100
 when I'm giving you absolutely nothing

50:25.100 --> 50:27.060
 and you're gonna think

50:27.060 --> 50:29.820
 that you're getting that full percept.

50:31.500 --> 50:34.020
 And that's precisely what we have done

50:34.020 --> 50:36.700
 and that's precisely what you get.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.180
 This of course is in the brain of mice.

50:39.180 --> 50:42.500
 But presumably in humans it would work similar.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.140
 Absolutely the same, zeroed out.

50:44.140 --> 50:45.900
 I have no questions.

50:45.900 --> 50:50.060
 So this attests to two important things.

50:50.060 --> 50:53.980
 The first to the predetermined nature of the sense of taste

50:55.540 --> 50:58.940
 because it means I can go to these parts of your brain

50:58.940 --> 51:01.180
 in the absence of any stimuli

51:01.180 --> 51:06.100
 and have you throw the full behavioral experience.

51:06.100 --> 51:08.380
 In fact, when we activate in your cortex

51:08.380 --> 51:11.820
 these bitter neurons, the animal can start gagging.

51:14.180 --> 51:16.660
 But it's drinking only water.

51:18.380 --> 51:23.380
 But the animal thinks that it's getting a bit of stimuli.

51:23.740 --> 51:24.980
 This is amazing.

51:24.980 --> 51:27.580
 And so, and the second, just to finish the line

51:27.580 --> 51:30.220
 so that it doesn't sound like it teaches two things

51:30.220 --> 51:32.020
 and then I only give you one lesson,

51:32.020 --> 51:37.020
 is that it substantiates this capacity of the brain

51:40.500 --> 51:45.500
 to segregate, to separate in these nodes of action

51:45.900 --> 51:49.980
 the representation of these two diametrically opposed

51:49.980 --> 51:53.620
 percepts, which is sweet, for example, versus bitter.

51:54.740 --> 51:58.180
 The reason I say amazing, and that is also amazing

51:58.180 --> 51:59.220
 is the following.

51:59.220 --> 52:01.780
 You told us earlier, and you're absolutely correct,

52:01.780 --> 52:04.940
 of course, that at the end of the day,

52:04.940 --> 52:06.860
 whether or not it's one group of neurons over here

52:06.860 --> 52:09.460
 and another group of neurons over there,

52:09.460 --> 52:11.100
 which is the way it turns out to be,

52:12.140 --> 52:15.620
 electrical activity is the generic common language

52:15.620 --> 52:17.700
 of both sets of neurons.

52:17.700 --> 52:20.260
 So that raises the question for me of whether or not

52:20.260 --> 52:23.460
 those separate sets of neurons are connected to areas

52:23.460 --> 52:27.300
 of the brain that create this sense of valence

52:27.300 --> 52:30.820
 or whether or not they're simply created, connected,

52:30.820 --> 52:34.420
 excuse me, to sets of neurons that evoke distinct behaviors

52:34.420 --> 52:37.740
 of moving towards and inhaling more and licking or aversive.

52:37.740 --> 52:40.380
 Are we essentially interpreting our behavior

52:40.380 --> 52:42.780
 and our micro responses?

52:42.780 --> 52:44.700
 Or are micro responses and our behaviors

52:44.700 --> 52:46.260
 the consequence of the percept?

52:46.260 --> 52:48.500
 Excellent, excellent question.

52:48.500 --> 52:53.500
 So first the answer is they go into an area of the brain

52:53.500 --> 52:58.500
 where valence is imposed.

53:00.220 --> 53:02.260
 And that area is known as the amygdala.

53:03.700 --> 53:06.660
 And the sweet neurons go to a different area

53:06.660 --> 53:08.620
 than the bitter neurons.

53:08.620 --> 53:10.460
 Now, I wanna do a thought experiment

53:10.460 --> 53:12.740
 because I think your audience might appreciate this.

53:12.740 --> 53:16.580
 Let's say I activate this group of neurons

53:16.580 --> 53:18.580
 and the animal increases licking

53:19.900 --> 53:22.020
 and I'm activating the sweet neurons.

53:22.020 --> 53:24.900
 And so that's expected because now it's, you know,

53:24.900 --> 53:28.660
 tasting this water as if it was sugar.

53:28.660 --> 53:32.100
 Now, this is Moses transforming water into wine.

53:32.100 --> 53:34.260
 In this case, we're gonna, and today is Passover.

53:34.260 --> 53:37.460
 So then it's an appropriate, you know, example.

53:38.660 --> 53:42.380
 We're transforming it into sweet, yeah?

53:43.340 --> 53:47.500
 But how do I know, how do I know that activating them

53:47.500 --> 53:52.140
 is evoking a positive feeling inside, a goodness,

53:52.140 --> 53:55.220
 a satisfaction, oh, I love it,

53:55.220 --> 53:57.820
 versus I'm just increasing licking,

53:59.300 --> 54:01.180
 which is the other option because all we're seeing

54:01.180 --> 54:02.780
 is that the animal is licking more

54:02.780 --> 54:05.660
 and we're trying to infer that that means

54:05.660 --> 54:07.740
 that he's feeling something really good versus,

54:07.740 --> 54:08.900
 you know what?

54:08.900 --> 54:11.700
 That piano line is going back straight into the tongue

54:11.700 --> 54:14.860
 and all he's doing is forcing it to move faster.

54:14.860 --> 54:19.580
 Well, we can actually separate this by doing experiments

54:19.580 --> 54:22.060
 that allow us to fundamentally distinguish them.

54:23.980 --> 54:26.020
 And imagine the following experiment.

54:26.020 --> 54:28.220
 I'm gonna take the animal and I'm gonna put them

54:28.220 --> 54:31.580
 inside a box that has two sides.

54:32.660 --> 54:35.500
 And the two sides have features that make them different.

54:35.500 --> 54:40.500
 One has yellow little toys, the other one has green toys.

54:41.300 --> 54:43.700
 One has little, you know, black stripes,

54:43.700 --> 54:45.300
 the other one has blue stripes.

54:45.300 --> 54:48.380
 So the animal can tell the two halves.

54:48.380 --> 54:51.180
 I take the mouse, put them inside this arena,

54:51.180 --> 54:54.860
 this play arena, and it will explore

54:54.860 --> 54:58.860
 and poach around both sides with equal frequency.

54:59.700 --> 55:02.020
 And now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna activate

55:02.020 --> 55:04.980
 these neurons, these sweet neurons,

55:04.980 --> 55:15.140
 every time the animal is on the side with the yellow stripes.

55:15.140 --> 55:20.140
 And if that is creating a positive internal state,

55:21.060 --> 55:24.020
 what would the animal now want to do?

55:24.020 --> 55:29.020
 It will want to stay on the side with the yellow stripes.

55:30.020 --> 55:31.180
 There's no leaking here.

55:31.180 --> 55:33.300
 The animal is not extending its tongue

55:33.300 --> 55:36.380
 every time I'm activating these neurons, okay?

55:36.380 --> 55:39.420
 This is known as a place preference test.

55:40.540 --> 55:42.980
 And it's generally used, it's just one form

55:42.980 --> 55:47.540
 of many different tests to demonstrate

55:48.660 --> 55:53.660
 that the activation of a group of neurons in the brain

55:54.060 --> 55:56.340
 is imposing, for example,

55:56.340 --> 55:59.780
 a positive versus a negative valence.

55:59.780 --> 56:01.580
 Whereas if I do the same thing

56:01.580 --> 56:03.420
 by activating the bitter neurons,

56:03.420 --> 56:07.940
 the animal will actively want now to stay away from the side

56:09.740 --> 56:12.340
 where these neurons are being activated.

56:12.340 --> 56:13.820
 And that's precisely what we see.

56:13.820 --> 56:16.380
 And that's precisely what we see.

56:16.380 --> 56:17.860
 Many people, including myself,

56:17.860 --> 56:20.500
 are familiar with the experience of going to a restaurant,

56:20.500 --> 56:23.020
 eating a variety of foods,

56:23.020 --> 56:25.220
 and then, fortunately it doesn't happen that often,

56:25.220 --> 56:27.580
 but then feeling very sick.

56:27.580 --> 56:29.500
 I learned coming up in neuroscience

56:29.500 --> 56:34.500
 that this is one strong example of one trial learning,

56:34.500 --> 56:37.260
 that from that point on,

56:37.260 --> 56:39.580
 it's not the restaurant or the waitress

56:39.580 --> 56:42.420
 or the waiter or the date,

56:42.420 --> 56:47.180
 but it's my notion of it had to have been the shrimp

56:47.180 --> 56:49.340
 that leads me to then want to avoid shrimp

56:49.340 --> 56:52.020
 in every context, maybe even shrimp powder.

56:52.020 --> 56:52.940
 You got it.

56:52.940 --> 56:54.340
 For a very long time.

56:54.340 --> 56:57.540
 I can imagine all the evolutionarily adaptive reasons

56:57.540 --> 57:00.380
 why this such a phenomenon would exist.

57:00.380 --> 57:03.660
 Do we have any concept of where in this pathway that exists?

57:03.660 --> 57:08.100
 We know actually a significant amount at a general level.

57:11.060 --> 57:12.780
 In fact, more than shrimp,

57:12.780 --> 57:15.780
 oysters are even a more dramatic example.

57:15.780 --> 57:19.340
 One bad oyster is all you need

57:19.340 --> 57:22.140
 to be driven away for the next six months.

57:22.140 --> 57:24.020
 I think because of the texture alone

57:24.020 --> 57:25.660
 is something that one learns to overcome.

57:25.660 --> 57:27.620
 I actually really enjoy oysters.

57:27.620 --> 57:31.460
 I despise mussels, despise shrimp,

57:31.460 --> 57:33.460
 not the animal, but the taste,

57:33.460 --> 57:35.260
 and yet oysters, for some reason,

57:35.260 --> 57:36.900
 I've yet to have a bad experience.

57:36.900 --> 57:38.460
 It's like uni, by the way.

57:38.460 --> 57:40.420
 Texture is hard to get over,

57:40.420 --> 57:43.180
 but once you get over, it's delicious.

57:43.180 --> 57:44.780
 That's what they tell me.

57:44.780 --> 57:46.460
 We were both in San Diego at one point,

57:46.460 --> 57:48.700
 and I'll give a plug to Sushi Ota

57:48.700 --> 57:50.300
 is kind of the famous little city,

57:50.300 --> 57:51.860
 and they have amazing uni,

57:51.860 --> 57:55.140
 and I've tried it twice, and I'm 0 for 2.

57:55.140 --> 57:57.620
 Somehow the texture outweighs

57:57.620 --> 57:59.100
 any kind of the deliciousness

57:59.100 --> 57:59.940
 that people report.

57:59.940 --> 58:02.020
 It's a very acquired taste, yeah?

58:02.020 --> 58:03.180
 It's like beer.

58:03.180 --> 58:05.700
 You know, I grew up in Chile.

58:05.700 --> 58:07.140
 That's where the accent comes from,

58:07.140 --> 58:08.500
 in case anyone wonder.

58:09.860 --> 58:11.540
 And you know, by the time I came here

58:11.540 --> 58:14.540
 to graduate school, I was 19, too old

58:14.540 --> 58:19.220
 to, you know, overcome my heavy Chilean accent.

58:19.220 --> 58:23.980
 So here I am, 40 years, 50 years late, not quite, 40 plus.

58:23.980 --> 58:26.140
 We appreciate it. And I still sound

58:26.140 --> 58:28.980
 like I just came off the boat.

58:28.980 --> 58:30.340
 So in Chile, you don't drink beer

58:30.340 --> 58:32.500
 when you're young, you drink wine.

58:32.500 --> 58:34.500
 You know, Chile is a huge wine producer.

58:35.940 --> 58:37.980
 So when I came to the US,

58:37.980 --> 58:40.500
 all of my, you know, classmates,

58:40.500 --> 58:42.060
 you know, were drinking beer

58:43.100 --> 58:45.020
 because they, you know, they had finished college

58:45.020 --> 58:47.540
 where they were all, you know, beer drinking,

58:47.540 --> 58:49.500
 and, you know, graduate school,

58:49.500 --> 58:52.780
 you're working 18 hours a day, every day.

58:52.780 --> 58:54.180
 The way they, you know, relax,

58:54.180 --> 58:55.900
 let's go and have some beers.

58:55.900 --> 58:56.940
 And beer is cheaper.

58:56.940 --> 58:57.820
 And beer is cheap.

58:57.820 --> 59:00.340
 And we were being clearly underpaid, may I add.

59:04.420 --> 59:05.540
 I couldn't do it.

59:05.540 --> 59:07.420
 It's an acquired taste.

59:07.420 --> 59:09.460
 It was too late by then.

59:09.460 --> 59:12.500
 And here I am, you know, 60 plus.

59:12.500 --> 59:15.980
 And if you take all the beer I've drunk in my entire life,

59:15.980 --> 59:19.900
 I would say they add to less than an eight ounce

59:19.900 --> 59:21.300
 in glass of water.

59:21.300 --> 59:23.860
 Impressive. Well, your health is probably better for it.

59:23.860 --> 59:24.700
 I'm not sure.

59:25.860 --> 59:27.180
 Your physical health, anyway.

59:27.180 --> 59:30.500
 So, you know, it goes back to, you know, acquired taste.

59:30.500 --> 59:33.140
 This is the connection to uni and to oysters.

59:33.140 --> 59:36.220
 Now, going back to the one trial learning,

59:36.220 --> 59:38.740
 you know, this is the great thing about our brains.

59:38.740 --> 59:40.380
 Certain things we need to repeat

59:40.380 --> 59:42.420
 a hundred times to learn them.

59:42.420 --> 59:45.060
 Hello, operator, can I have the phone number

59:45.060 --> 59:47.060
 for sushi ota, please?

59:47.060 --> 59:49.340
 And then she'll give it to you over the phone,

59:49.340 --> 59:51.180
 at least in the old days.

59:51.180 --> 59:54.060
 And then you need to repeat it to yourself

59:54.060 --> 59:55.900
 over and over and over over the next minute

59:55.900 --> 59:58.020
 so you can dial sushi ota.

59:58.980 --> 1:00:03.060
 And five minutes later, it's gone.

1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:05.260
 That's what we call working memory.

1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:08.460
 Then there is the short-term memory.

1:00:08.460 --> 1:00:10.580
 We park our car.

1:00:10.580 --> 1:00:12.140
 And if we're lucky, by the end of the day,

1:00:12.140 --> 1:00:14.060
 we remember where it is.

1:00:14.980 --> 1:00:16.660
 And then there is the long-term memory.

1:00:16.660 --> 1:00:19.860
 We remember the birthdays of every one of our children

1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:21.540
 for the rest of our lives.

1:00:22.620 --> 1:00:26.180
 Well, there are events that a single event is so traumatic

1:00:28.140 --> 1:00:30.540
 that it activates the circuits in a way

1:00:30.540 --> 1:00:32.940
 that it's a one trial learning.

1:00:32.940 --> 1:00:36.460
 And the taste system is literally

1:00:36.460 --> 1:00:38.300
 at the top of that food chain.

1:00:39.260 --> 1:00:40.740
 And there is a phenomenon known

1:00:40.740 --> 1:00:43.380
 as conditioned taste aversion.

1:00:44.420 --> 1:00:48.220
 You can pair an attractive stimuli

1:00:48.220 --> 1:00:50.980
 with a really bad one.

1:00:52.540 --> 1:00:57.180
 And you can make an animal begin to vehemently dislike,

1:00:57.180 --> 1:00:58.420
 for example, sugar.

1:00:59.980 --> 1:01:02.940
 And that's because you've conditioned the animals

1:01:02.940 --> 1:01:07.940
 to now be averse to this otherwise nice taste

1:01:08.460 --> 1:01:11.620
 because it's been associated with malaise.

1:01:11.620 --> 1:01:13.940
 And when you do that, now you could begin to ask,

1:01:13.940 --> 1:01:18.220
 what has changed in the signal as it travels

1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:22.620
 from the tongue to the brain in a normal animal

1:01:22.620 --> 1:01:26.100
 versus an animal where you have now transformed sweet

1:01:26.100 --> 1:01:28.860
 from being attractive to being aversive?

1:01:28.860 --> 1:01:31.540
 And this is the way now you begin to explore

1:01:31.540 --> 1:01:36.420
 how the brain changes the nature, the quality,

1:01:36.420 --> 1:01:41.420
 the meaning of a stimuli as a function of its state.

1:01:41.420 --> 1:01:42.260
 State.

1:01:43.660 --> 1:01:46.260
 I have a number of questions related to that,

1:01:48.020 --> 1:01:51.100
 all of which relate to this idea of context.

1:01:52.660 --> 1:01:54.380
 Because you mentioned before that flavor

1:01:54.380 --> 1:01:56.740
 is distinct from taste because flavor involves smell,

1:01:56.740 --> 1:01:59.860
 texture, temperature, and some other features.

1:01:59.860 --> 1:02:02.380
 Ooni, sea urchin being a good example of,

1:02:03.580 --> 1:02:05.300
 I can sense the texture.

1:02:05.300 --> 1:02:08.700
 It actually, yeah, I won't describe what it reminds me of

1:02:08.700 --> 1:02:11.340
 for various reasons.

1:02:12.700 --> 1:02:15.460
 The ability to place context on into,

1:02:15.460 --> 1:02:17.500
 to insert context into a perception

1:02:17.500 --> 1:02:20.260
 or rather to insert a perception into context

1:02:20.260 --> 1:02:22.860
 is so powerful.

1:02:22.860 --> 1:02:27.260
 And there's an element of kind of mystery about it,

1:02:27.260 --> 1:02:30.780
 but if we start to think about some of the more nuanced

1:02:30.780 --> 1:02:33.100
 that we like to live at the edge, as you say,

1:02:33.100 --> 1:02:38.100
 how many different tastes on the taste dial,

1:02:39.340 --> 1:02:41.620
 to go back to your analogy earlier, the color dial,

1:02:41.620 --> 1:02:42.780
 do you think that there could be

1:02:42.780 --> 1:02:45.940
 for something as fixed as bitter?

1:02:45.940 --> 1:02:49.420
 So for instance, I don't think I like bitter tastes,

1:02:49.420 --> 1:02:51.700
 but I like some fermented foods

1:02:51.700 --> 1:02:53.380
 that seem to have a little bit of sour

1:02:53.380 --> 1:02:56.660
 and have a little bit of that briny flavor.

1:02:56.660 --> 1:02:58.580
 How much plasticity do you think there is there,

1:02:58.580 --> 1:03:01.020
 and in particular across the lifespan?

1:03:01.020 --> 1:03:02.940
 Because I think one of the most salient examples

1:03:02.940 --> 1:03:07.540
 of this is that kids don't seem to like certain vegetables,

1:03:07.540 --> 1:03:11.180
 but they all are hardwired to like sweet tastes.

1:03:11.180 --> 1:03:12.900
 And yet you could also imagine

1:03:12.900 --> 1:03:15.740
 that one of the reasons why they may eventually grow

1:03:15.740 --> 1:03:18.820
 to incorporate vegetables is because of some knowledge

1:03:18.820 --> 1:03:21.580
 that vegetables might be better for them.

1:03:21.580 --> 1:03:25.700
 So is there a change in the receptors,

1:03:25.700 --> 1:03:28.140
 the distribution, the number, the sensitivity, et cetera,

1:03:28.140 --> 1:03:30.180
 that can explain the transition

1:03:30.180 --> 1:03:32.140
 from wanting to avoid vegetables

1:03:32.140 --> 1:03:34.140
 to being willing to eat vegetables,

1:03:34.140 --> 1:03:37.460
 simply in childhood to early development?

1:03:37.460 --> 1:03:39.580
 I'm gonna take the question slightly differently,

1:03:39.580 --> 1:03:41.820
 but I think it will illustrate the point.

1:03:41.820 --> 1:03:46.820
 And I'm gonna just use the difference

1:03:47.100 --> 1:03:48.620
 between the olfactory system

1:03:48.620 --> 1:03:50.740
 and the taste system to make the point.

1:03:52.340 --> 1:03:54.660
 Taste system, five basic palates,

1:03:54.660 --> 1:03:56.340
 sweet, sour, bitter, salt, and umami.

1:03:56.340 --> 1:03:58.660
 Each of them has a predetermined identity.

1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:01.460
 We know exactly what, and valence.

1:04:01.460 --> 1:04:04.460
 These are attractive, these are aversive.

1:04:04.460 --> 1:04:05.820
 In the olfactory system,

1:04:05.820 --> 1:04:09.060
 it's claimed that we can smell millions of different others.

1:04:11.180 --> 1:04:14.020
 Yet, for the most part,

1:04:14.020 --> 1:04:19.020
 none of them have an innate predetermined meaning.

1:04:19.980 --> 1:04:21.940
 In the olfactory system,

1:04:21.940 --> 1:04:26.100
 meaning is imposed by learning and experience,

1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:27.420
 even the smell of smoke.

1:04:27.420 --> 1:04:30.580
 So I'm gonna give you, I'm gonna make it differently.

1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:34.340
 There are a handful of the millions of others

1:04:34.340 --> 1:04:37.460
 that were claimed that you could immediately tell me

1:04:38.660 --> 1:04:41.700
 these are aversive and these are attractive.

1:04:41.700 --> 1:04:42.820
 Vomit.

1:04:42.820 --> 1:04:47.580
 So vomit, it's not correct because I can assure you

1:04:47.580 --> 1:04:50.460
 that there are cultures and societies

1:04:50.460 --> 1:04:54.180
 where things which are far less appealing than vomit

1:04:54.180 --> 1:04:56.060
 do not evoke an aversive reaction.

1:04:56.060 --> 1:04:57.340
 Really? Really.

1:04:57.340 --> 1:05:00.100
 Sulfur would be maybe a universal.

1:05:00.100 --> 1:05:01.660
 I'm not talking pheromones, okay?

1:05:01.660 --> 1:05:03.460
 Pheromones are in a different category

1:05:03.460 --> 1:05:06.660
 that trigger innate responses.

1:05:06.660 --> 1:05:09.140
 But nearly every other

1:05:10.620 --> 1:05:14.260
 is afforded meaning by learning and experience.

1:05:14.260 --> 1:05:18.500
 And that's why you like broccoli and I despise broccoli

1:05:18.500 --> 1:05:22.980
 because I remember my mother forcing me to eat broccoli.

1:05:22.980 --> 1:05:25.740
 Same sensory experience, all right.

1:05:25.740 --> 1:05:30.740
 This accommodates two important things.

1:05:30.900 --> 1:05:34.180
 In the case of taste, you have neurons at every station

1:05:34.180 --> 1:05:36.260
 that are for sweet, for sour, for bitter,

1:05:36.260 --> 1:05:37.660
 for salty and umami.

1:05:37.660 --> 1:05:38.900
 It's only five classes.

1:05:38.900 --> 1:05:41.140
 So it's not gonna take a lot of your brain.

1:05:41.140 --> 1:05:44.140
 If we can in fact smell a million others

1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:45.340
 and every one of us have others

1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:47.540
 had to have predetermined meaning,

1:05:47.540 --> 1:05:49.180
 there's not gonna be enough brain

1:05:49.180 --> 1:05:52.620
 just to accommodate that one sense.

1:05:52.620 --> 1:05:57.220
 And so evolution in its infinite wisdom

1:05:58.420 --> 1:06:03.340
 evolve a system where you put together a pathway

1:06:03.340 --> 1:06:05.780
 and a cortex, olfactory cortex,

1:06:06.780 --> 1:06:11.420
 where you have the capacity to associate every other

1:06:13.740 --> 1:06:17.340
 in a specific context that now gives it the meaning.

1:06:17.340 --> 1:06:22.340
 Now let's go back to the original question then.

1:06:23.820 --> 1:06:28.140
 So other than clearly plastic, mega plastic

1:06:28.140 --> 1:06:33.140
 because it's fundamental basis and neural organization.

1:06:33.700 --> 1:06:34.940
 But taste, we just told you

1:06:34.940 --> 1:06:37.340
 that's predetermined hardwired.

1:06:37.340 --> 1:06:39.180
 But predetermined hardwired doesn't mean

1:06:39.180 --> 1:06:43.340
 that it's not modulated by learning or experience.

1:06:43.340 --> 1:06:47.580
 It only means that you are born liking sweet

1:06:47.580 --> 1:06:49.220
 and disliking bitter.

1:06:50.620 --> 1:06:53.820
 And we have many examples of plasticity,

1:06:53.820 --> 1:06:56.220
 beer being one example.

1:06:56.220 --> 1:06:59.980
 So why do we learn to love beer is in coffee?

1:06:59.980 --> 1:07:04.980
 It's because it has an associated gain to the system

1:07:07.340 --> 1:07:09.620
 and that gain to the system,

1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:12.340
 that positive valence that emerges

1:07:12.340 --> 1:07:15.700
 out of that negative signal is sufficient

1:07:16.740 --> 1:07:19.220
 to create that positive association.

1:07:19.220 --> 1:07:21.820
 And in the case of beer, of course, is alcohol.

1:07:22.700 --> 1:07:25.220
 The feeling good that we get after

1:07:25.220 --> 1:07:27.420
 is more than sufficient to say,

1:07:27.420 --> 1:07:28.900
 I wanna have more of this.

1:07:29.780 --> 1:07:31.300
 And in the case of coffee, of course,

1:07:31.300 --> 1:07:33.180
 is caffeine activating a whole group

1:07:33.180 --> 1:07:35.380
 of neurotransmitter systems

1:07:35.380 --> 1:07:39.340
 that give you that high associated with coffee.

1:07:39.340 --> 1:07:41.940
 So yes, this taste system is changeable.

1:07:41.940 --> 1:07:46.220
 It's malleable and is subjected to learning and experience.

1:07:46.220 --> 1:07:48.940
 But unlike the olfactory system,

1:07:48.940 --> 1:07:53.180
 it's restricted in what you could do with it

1:07:53.180 --> 1:07:57.100
 because its goal is to allow you

1:07:57.100 --> 1:07:59.540
 to get nutrients and survive.

1:07:59.540 --> 1:08:02.580
 The goal of the olfactory system is very different.

1:08:02.580 --> 1:08:04.740
 It's being used, not in our case,

1:08:04.740 --> 1:08:06.780
 but in every animal species,

1:08:06.780 --> 1:08:09.700
 to identify friend versus foe,

1:08:09.700 --> 1:08:12.580
 to identify mate,

1:08:14.260 --> 1:08:18.860
 to identify ecological niches they wanna be in.

1:08:18.860 --> 1:08:22.980
 So it plays a very broad role

1:08:22.980 --> 1:08:25.820
 that then requires that it be set up,

1:08:25.820 --> 1:08:30.580
 organized and function in a very different type of context.

1:08:30.580 --> 1:08:35.180
 Taste is about can we get the nutrients we need to survive?

1:08:35.180 --> 1:08:36.940
 And can we ensure that we are attracted

1:08:36.940 --> 1:08:38.780
 to the ones we need?

1:08:38.780 --> 1:08:42.380
 And we're averse to the ones that are going to kill us.

1:08:42.380 --> 1:08:44.420
 I'm being overly simplistic and reductionist,

1:08:44.420 --> 1:08:47.260
 but I think it illustrates a huge difference

1:08:47.260 --> 1:08:50.620
 between these two chemosensory systems.

1:08:50.620 --> 1:08:52.980
 I don't think you're being overly simplistic.

1:08:52.980 --> 1:08:56.780
 I think it illustrates the key intractable nature

1:08:56.780 --> 1:08:59.620
 of this system and the way you've approached it.

1:08:59.620 --> 1:09:01.860
 And I think it's important for people to hear that

1:09:01.860 --> 1:09:04.020
 because everybody, as we are,

1:09:04.020 --> 1:09:07.420
 it's mystified with empathy and love, et cetera.

1:09:07.420 --> 1:09:09.260
 So in fairness to that,

1:09:09.260 --> 1:09:12.900
 I'm going to ask a sort of a high level question

1:09:12.900 --> 1:09:14.140
 or abstract question.

1:09:15.260 --> 1:09:16.860
 This was based on a conversation I had

1:09:16.860 --> 1:09:18.500
 with a former girlfriend

1:09:18.500 --> 1:09:22.220
 where we were talking about chemistry between individuals.

1:09:22.220 --> 1:09:26.180
 Very complicated topic on the one hand,

1:09:26.180 --> 1:09:27.460
 but on the other hand,

1:09:28.500 --> 1:09:32.180
 quite simple in that certain people, for whatever reason,

1:09:32.180 --> 1:09:34.980
 evoke a tremendous sense of arousal,

1:09:34.980 --> 1:09:37.820
 for lack of a better word, between two people,

1:09:37.820 --> 1:09:38.660
 one would hope.

1:09:40.780 --> 1:09:42.660
 At least for some period of time.

1:09:42.660 --> 1:09:44.940
 I didn't know this was that kind of a podcast.

1:09:44.940 --> 1:09:47.260
 No, well, the reason I,

1:09:47.260 --> 1:09:49.900
 but this has to do with taste because she said something,

1:09:49.900 --> 1:09:53.580
 I think in part to maybe irritate me a bit,

1:09:53.580 --> 1:09:56.220
 but we were commenting

1:09:56.220 --> 1:09:58.620
 not about our own experience of each other,

1:09:58.620 --> 1:10:03.180
 but of someone that she was now very excited about.

1:10:03.180 --> 1:10:05.780
 We're on good terms.

1:10:05.780 --> 1:10:07.580
 And she said,

1:10:07.580 --> 1:10:10.140
 what do you think it is, this thing of chemistry?

1:10:10.140 --> 1:10:12.140
 So maybe she was trying to, you know.

1:10:12.140 --> 1:10:13.780
 Warn you of what's coming.

1:10:13.780 --> 1:10:15.100
 Warn me of what's coming.

1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:15.940
 And she said,

1:10:15.940 --> 1:10:18.900
 I have a feeling something about it is in smell

1:10:20.300 --> 1:10:23.340
 and something about it is actually in taste,

1:10:23.340 --> 1:10:25.540
 literally the taste of somebody's breath.

1:10:25.540 --> 1:10:27.340
 That's the way she described it.

1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:30.980
 And I thought that it was a very interesting example

1:10:30.980 --> 1:10:32.660
 for a number of reasons,

1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:33.580
 but in particular,

1:10:33.580 --> 1:10:37.340
 because it gets to the merging of odor and taste,

1:10:37.340 --> 1:10:39.820
 but also to the idea that,

1:10:39.820 --> 1:10:42.340
 of course, the context of a new relationship,

1:10:42.340 --> 1:10:43.180
 I'm assuming,

1:10:43.180 --> 1:10:45.500
 and in fact, they're both attractive people, et cetera.

1:10:45.500 --> 1:10:46.660
 There's a whole context there,

1:10:46.660 --> 1:10:50.300
 but I've had the experience of

1:10:51.780 --> 1:10:53.660
 the odor of somebody's breath being aversive,

1:10:53.660 --> 1:10:57.260
 not because I could identify it as aversive.

1:10:57.260 --> 1:10:58.100
 Because you just didn't like it.

1:10:58.100 --> 1:11:00.460
 But because it just didn't like it.

1:11:00.460 --> 1:11:03.140
 But that's because you associate it

1:11:04.540 --> 1:11:06.860
 with other others

1:11:08.460 --> 1:11:11.260
 that trigger that

1:11:13.140 --> 1:11:16.100
 negative, you know, aversive reaction, by the way.

1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:16.940
 Absolutely.

1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:18.980
 There are certain perfumes to me that are aversive.

1:11:18.980 --> 1:11:19.820
 You got it.

1:11:19.820 --> 1:11:21.700
 And there are other scents,

1:11:22.780 --> 1:11:24.980
 can recall scents of skin,

1:11:24.980 --> 1:11:26.060
 of foods, et cetera,

1:11:26.060 --> 1:11:28.220
 that are immensely repetitive.

1:11:28.220 --> 1:11:31.420
 So I've experienced both sides of this equation myself.

1:11:31.420 --> 1:11:32.860
 And she was describing this.

1:11:32.860 --> 1:11:35.660
 And to me, more than tasting wine,

1:11:35.660 --> 1:11:37.180
 which is the typical example,

1:11:37.180 --> 1:11:39.300
 where people inhale it and then they drink it.

1:11:39.300 --> 1:11:41.340
 To me, this seems like something that

1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:43.140
 more people might be able to relate to.

1:11:43.140 --> 1:11:47.500
 That certain things and people smell delicious.

1:11:47.500 --> 1:11:49.580
 Even mothers describing the smell of their baby's head.

1:11:49.580 --> 1:11:50.420
 Of course.

1:11:50.420 --> 1:11:51.940
 A mother's ass.

1:11:51.940 --> 1:11:53.980
 I mean, you know, our own babies,

1:11:53.980 --> 1:11:55.300
 when they're in their necks.

1:11:55.300 --> 1:11:56.780
 That's the magical place.

1:11:56.780 --> 1:11:57.620
 Their neck.

1:11:57.620 --> 1:11:58.620
 The back of their neck.

1:11:58.620 --> 1:11:59.460
 There you go.

1:11:59.460 --> 1:12:00.540
 Oh my goodness.

1:12:00.540 --> 1:12:01.540
 I have a grandchild now.

1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:05.460
 So I know exactly what Rio, that's his name, smells like.

1:12:05.460 --> 1:12:06.300
 Okay.

1:12:06.300 --> 1:12:07.380
 So more beautiful examples.

1:12:07.380 --> 1:12:09.180
 It's always more fun to think about the beautiful,

1:12:09.180 --> 1:12:11.540
 positive, the repetitive examples.

1:12:11.540 --> 1:12:15.140
 The smell of the back of your grandson's neck.

1:12:15.140 --> 1:12:15.980
 Yes.

1:12:15.980 --> 1:12:16.820
 I mean, you couldn't,

1:12:16.820 --> 1:12:17.780
 you could get more specific than that,

1:12:17.780 --> 1:12:19.100
 but not a lot more specific.

1:12:19.100 --> 1:12:19.940
 Exactly.

1:12:19.940 --> 1:12:22.020
 So what is going on in terms of

1:12:22.020 --> 1:12:24.620
 the combination of odor and taste,

1:12:24.620 --> 1:12:27.620
 given that these two systems are so different?

1:12:27.620 --> 1:12:28.860
 Yes.

1:12:28.860 --> 1:12:31.660
 And they come together.

1:12:32.620 --> 1:12:35.740
 Ultimately, there is a place in the brain

1:12:35.740 --> 1:12:39.980
 where they come together to integrate the two

1:12:39.980 --> 1:12:44.980
 into what we would call, you know, that sensory experience.

1:12:45.260 --> 1:12:48.220
 And I'll tell you an experiment that you could do

1:12:48.220 --> 1:12:49.780
 that demonstrates this.

1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:53.980
 I think it's good for your audience here

1:12:53.980 --> 1:12:56.340
 to get a sense of how we approach these problems

1:12:56.340 --> 1:12:59.140
 so that we can get in a meaningful scientific answers.

1:13:00.700 --> 1:13:05.140
 So we know where the olfactory cortex is in the brain.

1:13:05.140 --> 1:13:07.100
 We know where the taste cortex is in the brain.

1:13:07.100 --> 1:13:09.220
 They're in two different places.

1:13:09.220 --> 1:13:12.700
 We can go to each of these two cortices,

1:13:13.780 --> 1:13:17.540
 put color traces, we put green in one,

1:13:17.540 --> 1:13:19.020
 we put red in the other,

1:13:19.020 --> 1:13:21.980
 and we see where the colors go to.

1:13:21.980 --> 1:13:24.140
 That's a reflection of where those neurons

1:13:24.140 --> 1:13:29.140
 are projecting to into their next targets.

1:13:29.220 --> 1:13:30.300
 Once they get the signal,

1:13:30.300 --> 1:13:32.300
 where do they send the signal to?

1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:36.820
 And then we reason that if odor and taste

1:13:36.820 --> 1:13:39.020
 come together somewhere in the brain,

1:13:39.020 --> 1:13:40.660
 we should find an area that now

1:13:40.660 --> 1:13:42.780
 it's getting red and green color.

1:13:44.220 --> 1:13:46.020
 And we found such an area.

1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:51.180
 And next, we anticipated, we hypothesized

1:13:51.180 --> 1:13:55.260
 that maybe this is the area in the brain of the mouse,

1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:57.500
 corresponding area in the brain of humans,

1:13:57.500 --> 1:14:02.500
 that integrates odor and taste.

1:14:03.100 --> 1:14:05.660
 It's known, the term normally used

1:14:05.660 --> 1:14:08.060
 is multisensory integration.

1:14:08.940 --> 1:14:11.980
 And if this is true, we could do the following experiment.

1:14:11.980 --> 1:14:23.980
 We can train a mouse to lick sweet and if they guess correctly

1:14:23.980 --> 1:14:25.860
 that that is supposed to be sweet,

1:14:25.860 --> 1:14:29.820
 they should go now to the right port,

1:14:29.820 --> 1:14:32.740
 to the right side to get a water reward.

1:14:34.540 --> 1:14:38.140
 If they go to the left when it was sweet,

1:14:38.140 --> 1:14:42.100
 then they're incorrect and they get no reward.

1:14:42.100 --> 1:14:44.820
 And they actually get a timeout.

1:14:44.820 --> 1:14:46.580
 Now the mice are thirsty,

1:14:46.580 --> 1:14:48.980
 so they're very motivated to perform.

1:14:48.980 --> 1:14:52.380
 And if you repeat this task a hundred times,

1:14:52.380 --> 1:14:55.060
 a hundred trials, incredibly enough,

1:14:55.060 --> 1:14:58.020
 this animal learned to recognize the sweet

1:14:58.020 --> 1:15:00.060
 and execute the right action.

1:15:00.060 --> 1:15:05.020
 And by their action, we now are being told

1:15:05.020 --> 1:15:07.020
 what that animal is tasting.

1:15:07.020 --> 1:15:09.300
 We can make it more interesting

1:15:09.300 --> 1:15:10.780
 and we can give him sweet and bitter

1:15:10.780 --> 1:15:12.620
 and say if it's sweet, go to the right

1:15:12.620 --> 1:15:14.260
 and if it's bitter, go to the left.

1:15:15.340 --> 1:15:18.460
 And after you train him, this mice with 90% accuracy

1:15:18.460 --> 1:15:22.180
 will tell you when you randomize now the stimuli,

1:15:22.180 --> 1:15:24.180
 what was sweet and what was bitter.

1:15:24.180 --> 1:15:25.540
 All right.

1:15:25.540 --> 1:15:28.260
 We can now do the same experiment,

1:15:28.260 --> 1:15:30.940
 but now mix taste with odor.

1:15:30.940 --> 1:15:35.940
 And say, if you got odor alone,

1:15:38.340 --> 1:15:43.340
 go to the right or push this lever in mice.

1:15:43.380 --> 1:15:45.820
 If you get taste alone,

1:15:45.820 --> 1:15:48.460
 go to this other part or push this other lever.

1:15:49.620 --> 1:15:53.500
 And if you get the two together, do this something else.

1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:54.980
 And if you train the mice,

1:15:54.980 --> 1:15:57.660
 the mice are able now to report back to you

1:15:57.660 --> 1:16:02.660
 when it's sensing taste alone, odor alone or the mix.

1:16:04.980 --> 1:16:05.820
 Make sense?

1:16:05.820 --> 1:16:06.660
 Makes sense.

1:16:06.660 --> 1:16:09.300
 Now we can go to the brain of this mice

1:16:09.300 --> 1:16:13.020
 and go to this area that we now uncover,

1:16:13.020 --> 1:16:17.100
 discover as being the site of multi-sensor integration

1:16:17.100 --> 1:16:21.140
 between taste and odor and silence it.

1:16:21.980 --> 1:16:25.700
 Prevent it from being activated experimentally.

1:16:25.700 --> 1:16:28.460
 And if that area really represented

1:16:28.460 --> 1:16:30.500
 the integration of these two,

1:16:30.500 --> 1:16:34.060
 the animal should still be able to recognize the taste alone.

1:16:34.060 --> 1:16:37.100
 They still should be able to recognize the odor alone,

1:16:37.100 --> 1:16:41.780
 but should be incapable now to recognize the mix.

1:16:43.460 --> 1:16:47.900
 And exactly as predicted, that's exactly what you get.

1:16:47.900 --> 1:16:49.100
 All right?

1:16:49.100 --> 1:16:53.380
 The brain is basically a series of engineered circuits.

1:16:53.380 --> 1:16:55.940
 Complex.

1:16:55.940 --> 1:17:00.940
 And our task is to figure out how can we extract

1:17:03.100 --> 1:17:07.340
 this amazing architecture of these circuits

1:17:07.340 --> 1:17:09.980
 in a way that we can begin to uncover

1:17:09.980 --> 1:17:12.940
 the mysteries of the brain.

1:17:12.940 --> 1:17:15.900
 And why certain people's breath tastes so good

1:17:15.900 --> 1:17:18.740
 and other people's not so good.

1:17:18.740 --> 1:17:19.980
 So I never answered that,

1:17:19.980 --> 1:17:22.060
 but I told you how we can figure out

1:17:22.060 --> 1:17:24.620
 where in the brain is happening.

1:17:25.820 --> 1:17:27.380
 As we've been having this discussion,

1:17:27.380 --> 1:17:31.060
 I thought a few times about similarities

1:17:31.060 --> 1:17:34.060
 to the visual system or differences to the visual system.

1:17:34.060 --> 1:17:36.220
 The visual system, there are a couple of phenomenon

1:17:36.220 --> 1:17:41.100
 that I wonder if they also exist in the taste system.

1:17:41.100 --> 1:17:42.620
 In the visual system, we know for instance,

1:17:42.620 --> 1:17:44.540
 that if you look at something long enough

1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:46.980
 and activate the given receptors long enough,

1:17:46.980 --> 1:17:49.300
 that object will actually disappear.

1:17:49.300 --> 1:17:51.700
 We offset this with little micro eye movements, et cetera,

1:17:51.700 --> 1:17:53.700
 but the principle is a fundamental one,

1:17:53.700 --> 1:17:55.740
 this habituation or desensitization.

1:17:55.740 --> 1:17:57.620
 Everyone seems to call it something different,

1:17:57.620 --> 1:17:59.620
 but you get the idea, of course.

1:18:00.820 --> 1:18:04.140
 In the taste system, I'm certainly familiar

1:18:04.140 --> 1:18:05.860
 with eating something very, very sweet

1:18:05.860 --> 1:18:07.900
 for the first time in a long time,

1:18:07.900 --> 1:18:09.860
 and it tastes very sweet,

1:18:09.860 --> 1:18:11.620
 but a few more licks, a few more bites,

1:18:11.620 --> 1:18:13.340
 and now it tastes not as sweet.

1:18:14.180 --> 1:18:16.900
 With olfaction, I'm familiar with the odor in a room

1:18:16.900 --> 1:18:18.900
 I don't like or I like, and then it disappearing.

1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:23.060
 So similar phenomenon, where does that occur?

1:18:23.980 --> 1:18:28.980
 And can you imagine a sort of a system

1:18:28.980 --> 1:18:31.580
 by which people could leverage that?

1:18:31.580 --> 1:18:34.580
 Because I do think that most people are interested

1:18:34.580 --> 1:18:37.740
 in eating not more sugar, but less sugar.

1:18:37.740 --> 1:18:39.660
 I think we have better ways to approach that,

1:18:39.660 --> 1:18:44.500
 and we can transition from taste into these other circuits

1:18:44.500 --> 1:18:49.500
 that makes sugar so extraordinarily impossible

1:18:51.500 --> 1:18:53.500
 not to consume.

1:18:53.500 --> 1:18:54.780
 Impossible.

1:18:54.780 --> 1:18:55.620
 Exactly.

1:18:56.820 --> 1:19:01.820
 So where does this desensitizing happens?

1:19:01.940 --> 1:19:03.340
 That's the term that we use.

1:19:04.380 --> 1:19:09.380
 And it's, I think, happening at multiple stations.

1:19:09.380 --> 1:19:12.860
 It's happening at the receptor level,

1:19:12.860 --> 1:19:17.860
 i.e. the cells in your tongue that are sensing that sugar.

1:19:18.860 --> 1:19:20.740
 As you activate this receptor,

1:19:20.740 --> 1:19:24.420
 and it's triggering activity after activity after activity,

1:19:24.420 --> 1:19:27.060
 eventually you exhaust the receptor.

1:19:27.060 --> 1:19:31.060
 Again, I'm using terms which are extraordinarily loose.

1:19:32.060 --> 1:19:33.540
 But for sake of this discussion, it's fine.

1:19:33.540 --> 1:19:34.940
 For the sake of this discussion,

1:19:34.940 --> 1:19:39.940
 the receptor gets to a point where it undergoes

1:19:40.060 --> 1:19:42.620
 a set of changes, chemical changes,

1:19:43.620 --> 1:19:47.940
 where it now signals far less efficiently,

1:19:47.940 --> 1:19:52.260
 or it even gets removed from the surface of the cell.

1:19:53.260 --> 1:19:56.820
 And now what will happen is that the same amount of sugar

1:19:56.820 --> 1:20:00.220
 will trigger far less of a response.

1:20:01.780 --> 1:20:04.100
 And that is a significant change.

1:20:04.100 --> 1:20:07.860
 And that is a huge side of this modulation.

1:20:09.020 --> 1:20:10.660
 And then the next, I believe,

1:20:10.660 --> 1:20:14.420
 is the integrated, again, loss of signaling

1:20:14.420 --> 1:20:18.180
 that happens by continuous activation of the circuit

1:20:18.180 --> 1:20:20.700
 at each of these different neural stations.

1:20:20.700 --> 1:20:23.540
 You know, there is from the tongue to the ganglia,

1:20:23.540 --> 1:20:26.580
 from the ganglia to the first station in the brainstem,

1:20:26.580 --> 1:20:28.940
 a second station in the brainstem,

1:20:28.940 --> 1:20:32.020
 to the thalamus, then to the cortex.

1:20:32.020 --> 1:20:34.940
 So there are multiple steps that this signal is traveling.

1:20:34.940 --> 1:20:37.660
 Now, you might say, why, if this is a labeled line,

1:20:37.660 --> 1:20:40.820
 why do you need to have so many stations?

1:20:40.820 --> 1:20:43.580
 And that's because the taste system is so important

1:20:43.580 --> 1:20:47.820
 to ensure that you get what you need to survive,

1:20:47.820 --> 1:20:50.740
 that it has to be subjected to modulation

1:20:50.740 --> 1:20:52.980
 by the internal state.

1:20:52.980 --> 1:20:57.100
 And each of these nodes provides a new side

1:20:57.100 --> 1:21:00.700
 to give it plasticity and modulation,

1:21:00.700 --> 1:21:03.900
 not necessarily to change the way that something tastes,

1:21:04.820 --> 1:21:09.340
 but to ensure that you consume more or less

1:21:09.340 --> 1:21:12.660
 or differently of what you need.

1:21:12.660 --> 1:21:14.060
 I'm gonna give you one example

1:21:14.060 --> 1:21:16.220
 of how the internal state changes

1:21:16.220 --> 1:21:17.940
 the way the taste system works.

1:21:19.140 --> 1:21:24.140
 Salt is very appetitive at low concentrations,

1:21:25.180 --> 1:21:26.700
 and that's because we need it.

1:21:26.700 --> 1:21:29.540
 Our electrolyte balance requires salt.

1:21:29.540 --> 1:21:31.580
 Every one of their neurons uses salt

1:21:31.580 --> 1:21:33.940
 as the most important of the ions,

1:21:33.940 --> 1:21:36.020
 you know, with potassium to ensure that

1:21:36.020 --> 1:21:38.740
 you can transfer these electrical signals

1:21:38.740 --> 1:21:40.180
 within and between neurons.

1:21:42.980 --> 1:21:46.980
 But at high concentrations, let's say ocean water,

1:21:46.980 --> 1:21:49.380
 it's incredibly aversive.

1:21:49.380 --> 1:21:51.300
 And we all know this because we've gone to the ocean,

1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:52.900
 and then when you get it in your mouth,

1:21:52.900 --> 1:21:55.020
 it's not that great.

1:21:55.020 --> 1:22:00.020
 However, if I salt deprive you,

1:22:00.020 --> 1:22:04.020
 and we can do this in experimental models quite readily,

1:22:06.020 --> 1:22:09.300
 now this incredibly high concentration of salt,

1:22:09.300 --> 1:22:11.940
 one molar sodium chloride,

1:22:11.940 --> 1:22:14.860
 becomes amazingly appetitive and attractive.

1:22:15.860 --> 1:22:18.100
 What's going on in here?

1:22:18.100 --> 1:22:21.380
 Your tongue is telling you this is horrible,

1:22:21.380 --> 1:22:22.980
 but your brain is telling you,

1:22:22.980 --> 1:22:26.260
 I don't care, you need it.

1:22:28.620 --> 1:22:32.220
 And this is what we call the modulation

1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:36.580
 of the taste system by the internal state.

1:22:36.580 --> 1:22:38.300
 And presumably if one is hungry enough,

1:22:38.300 --> 1:22:40.300
 even uni will taste good.

1:22:40.300 --> 1:22:41.140
 Just kidding, to me.

1:22:41.140 --> 1:22:41.980
 You hit it right on the money.

1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:44.860
 No, no, this is exactly correct.

1:22:44.860 --> 1:22:47.180
 Or if you're thirsty and hungry,

1:22:48.580 --> 1:22:50.020
 you suppress hunger,

1:22:50.020 --> 1:22:54.460
 so that you don't waste water molecules in digesting food.

1:22:55.460 --> 1:22:56.300
 Why?

1:22:56.300 --> 1:22:59.460
 Because if you're thirsty and you have no water,

1:22:59.460 --> 1:23:01.420
 you will die within a week or so.

1:23:02.420 --> 1:23:04.300
 But you can go on a hunger strike

1:23:04.300 --> 1:23:08.700
 as long as you have water for months,

1:23:08.700 --> 1:23:12.380
 because you're gonna eat up all your energy reserves.

1:23:12.380 --> 1:23:14.020
 Water is a different story.

1:23:14.020 --> 1:23:18.460
 So you could see that there are multiple layers

1:23:18.460 --> 1:23:23.460
 at which the taste system that guides our drive

1:23:23.860 --> 1:23:27.740
 and our motivation to consume the nutrients we need

1:23:28.940 --> 1:23:33.940
 has to be modulated in response to the internal state.

1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:35.300
 And of course, internal state itself

1:23:35.300 --> 1:23:39.300
 has to be modulated by the external world.

1:23:40.300 --> 1:23:42.820
 And so that, I think, is a reason why

1:23:42.820 --> 1:23:44.060
 what could otherwise would have been

1:23:44.060 --> 1:23:46.700
 an incredibly simple system from the tongue

1:23:46.700 --> 1:23:51.700
 to the cortex in one, yes, wire, it's not.

1:23:51.700 --> 1:23:55.460
 Because you have to ensure that at each step,

1:23:55.460 --> 1:23:59.300
 you give the system that level of flexibility,

1:23:59.300 --> 1:24:01.940
 or what we call in neuroscience, plasticity.

1:24:02.940 --> 1:24:04.740
 I think we're headed into the gut.

1:24:04.740 --> 1:24:05.580
 All right.

1:24:05.580 --> 1:24:08.740
 But I have a question that has just been on my mind

1:24:08.740 --> 1:24:12.780
 for a bit now, because I was drinking this water,

1:24:12.780 --> 1:24:14.940
 and it has essentially no taste.

1:24:14.940 --> 1:24:16.980
 And it has essentially no taste.

1:24:16.980 --> 1:24:18.300
 Yes.

1:24:18.300 --> 1:24:21.900
 Is there any kind of signal for the absence of taste

1:24:21.900 --> 1:24:23.500
 despite having something in the mouth?

1:24:23.500 --> 1:24:25.100
 And here is why I ask.

1:24:25.100 --> 1:24:28.020
 What I'm thinking about is saliva.

1:24:28.020 --> 1:24:30.300
 And while it's true that if I eat

1:24:30.300 --> 1:24:33.060
 a lot of very highly palatable foods,

1:24:33.060 --> 1:24:37.580
 that does change how I experience more bland foods.

1:24:37.580 --> 1:24:38.780
 I must confess when I eat

1:24:38.780 --> 1:24:40.540
 a lot of these highly processed foods,

1:24:40.540 --> 1:24:41.740
 I don't particularly like them.

1:24:41.740 --> 1:24:43.120
 I tend to crave healthier foods,

1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:44.900
 but that's probably for contextual reasons

1:24:44.900 --> 1:24:46.960
 about nutrients, et cetera.

1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:50.580
 But I could imagine an experiment where-

1:24:50.580 --> 1:24:52.200
 Is there a taste of no taste?

1:24:52.200 --> 1:24:53.040
 Right.

1:24:53.040 --> 1:24:53.860
 Is there a taste of no taste?

1:24:53.860 --> 1:24:56.220
 Because in the visual system there is, right?

1:24:56.220 --> 1:24:58.540
 You close the eyes and you start getting increases

1:24:58.540 --> 1:24:59.940
 in activity in the visual system,

1:24:59.940 --> 1:25:02.580
 as opposed to decreases, which often surprises people.

1:25:02.580 --> 1:25:04.160
 But there are reasons for that,

1:25:04.160 --> 1:25:06.060
 because everything is about signal to noise,

1:25:06.060 --> 1:25:07.180
 signal to background.

1:25:07.180 --> 1:25:08.020
 And-

1:25:08.020 --> 1:25:09.140
 It's a good question.

1:25:09.140 --> 1:25:11.020
 I can tell you that most of our work

1:25:11.020 --> 1:25:14.220
 is trying to focus on how the taste system works,

1:25:14.220 --> 1:25:16.920
 not how it doesn't work.

1:25:16.920 --> 1:25:17.760
 Well, but-

1:25:17.760 --> 1:25:18.600
 I know.

1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:19.420
 Yes.

1:25:19.420 --> 1:25:20.260
 I know you're being playful.

1:25:20.260 --> 1:25:21.700
 And I knew when inviting you here today,

1:25:21.700 --> 1:25:23.380
 I was setting myself up for it.

1:25:23.380 --> 1:25:25.060
 I actually, on a different-

1:25:25.060 --> 1:25:26.220
 We're trying to learn things.

1:25:26.220 --> 1:25:27.040
 I know.

1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:27.880
 However-

1:25:27.880 --> 1:25:30.660
 All right, listen, I was weaned in this system of,

1:25:30.660 --> 1:25:32.580
 and I'll say it here for the second.

1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:34.800
 Actually, I recorded a podcast recently

1:25:34.800 --> 1:25:37.540
 with a very prominent podcast, Lex Friedman Podcast.

1:25:37.540 --> 1:25:39.140
 And I made reference to the so-called

1:25:39.140 --> 1:25:41.540
 New York Neuroscience Mafia.

1:25:41.540 --> 1:25:43.980
 I won't say whether or not we are sitting in the presence

1:25:43.980 --> 1:25:46.260
 of the New York Neuroscience Mafia member,

1:25:46.260 --> 1:25:48.280
 but in any event,

1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:51.180
 I know the sorts of ribbing that they provide.

1:25:51.180 --> 1:25:52.300
 For those listening,

1:25:52.300 --> 1:25:54.180
 this is the kind of hazing that happens,

1:25:54.180 --> 1:25:57.020
 benevolent hazing in academia.

1:25:57.020 --> 1:25:57.860
 I'm the target.

1:25:57.860 --> 1:25:58.700
 Of course.

1:25:58.700 --> 1:26:00.540
 It's a sign of love.

1:26:00.540 --> 1:26:01.380
 Exactly.

1:26:01.380 --> 1:26:02.200
 He's going to tell me that.

1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:04.540
 And it's always about the science in the end.

1:26:04.540 --> 1:26:05.580
 Right.

1:26:05.580 --> 1:26:06.420
 But-

1:26:06.420 --> 1:26:07.380
 It's an interesting question.

1:26:07.380 --> 1:26:10.940
 Look, I don't know the answer,

1:26:10.940 --> 1:26:15.940
 and I don't even know how I would explore it

1:26:16.900 --> 1:26:20.960
 in a way that it will rigorously teach me.

1:26:23.900 --> 1:26:24.740
 But-

1:26:26.460 --> 1:26:27.820
 Let me tell you why I'm asking,

1:26:27.820 --> 1:26:29.420
 and then I'll offer an experiment

1:26:29.420 --> 1:26:32.180
 that I'd love to see someone in your class do.

1:26:32.180 --> 1:26:33.580
 I'm thinking about saliva.

1:26:33.580 --> 1:26:34.400
 Yes.

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:35.240
 Which itself-

1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:36.080
 No, no, no, but that we know,

1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:37.020
 that we can figure it out, actually.

1:26:37.020 --> 1:26:38.820
 But the question is whether or not

1:26:38.820 --> 1:26:42.940
 the saliva in a fed state

1:26:42.940 --> 1:26:46.460
 is distinct from the saliva in an unfed state,

1:26:46.460 --> 1:26:47.880
 such that it modulates-

1:26:47.880 --> 1:26:48.720
 It's not.

1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:49.540
 The sensitivity of the receptors.

1:26:49.540 --> 1:26:50.580
 That experiment has been done, no.

1:26:50.580 --> 1:26:51.420
 It has been done.

1:26:51.420 --> 1:26:52.460
 And so the answer is no.

1:26:52.460 --> 1:26:53.300
 It's not.

1:26:53.300 --> 1:26:54.780
 Yeah, and the way you could do the experiment

1:26:54.780 --> 1:26:58.260
 is because we use artificial saliva.

1:26:58.260 --> 1:26:59.100
 There's such a thing.

1:26:59.100 --> 1:27:01.660
 I know there's artificial tears, but-

1:27:01.660 --> 1:27:04.840
 No, no, we, I don't mean that you go to Walgreens

1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:07.860
 and you get, I mean, we in my laboratory,

1:27:07.860 --> 1:27:09.740
 we know the composition of saliva,

1:27:09.740 --> 1:27:12.000
 and so you can make such a thing.

1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:17.000
 And you can take, you know, taste cells in culture

1:27:17.340 --> 1:27:20.380
 or in a tongue where you wash it out of,

1:27:20.380 --> 1:27:23.300
 and then you can apply artificial saliva.

1:27:23.300 --> 1:27:25.260
 And what happens is that the system

1:27:25.260 --> 1:27:29.040
 is being engineered to desensitize,

1:27:29.040 --> 1:27:34.040
 to become agnostic for saliva to become invisible.

1:27:34.040 --> 1:27:39.040
 And there is no difference on the state of the animal.

1:27:40.380 --> 1:27:41.220
 Great.

1:27:41.220 --> 1:27:42.040
 Well, this is the reason to do experiments.

1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:42.880
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:27:42.880 --> 1:27:44.820
 So it doesn't defeat any grand hypothesis.

1:27:44.820 --> 1:27:47.340
 It's just a pure curiosity.

1:27:47.340 --> 1:27:48.180
 So-

1:27:48.180 --> 1:27:49.940
 You know that curiosity kills the cut, yeah?

1:27:49.940 --> 1:27:50.780
 I do.

1:27:53.980 --> 1:27:56.500
 But saves the career of a scientist.

1:27:56.500 --> 1:27:57.320
 Every single time.

1:27:57.320 --> 1:27:58.160
 That's what drives us.

1:27:58.160 --> 1:27:59.000
 Absolutely.

1:27:59.000 --> 1:27:59.820
 Every single time.

1:27:59.820 --> 1:28:00.660
 It's the story of our lives.

1:28:00.660 --> 1:28:01.780
 Exactly.

1:28:01.780 --> 1:28:05.340
 Okay, so if it's not saliva, and apparently it is not,

1:28:07.340 --> 1:28:09.700
 what about internal state?

1:28:09.700 --> 1:28:14.000
 And what aspects of the internal milieu are relevant?

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.180
 Because there's autonomic, there's asleep and awake,

1:28:16.180 --> 1:28:17.140
 there's stress.

1:28:17.140 --> 1:28:20.260
 One of the questions that I got from hundreds of people

1:28:20.260 --> 1:28:22.980
 when I solicited questions in advance of this episode was,

1:28:22.980 --> 1:28:26.160
 why do I crave sugar when I'm stressed, for instance?

1:28:26.160 --> 1:28:27.220
 And that could be contextual,

1:28:27.220 --> 1:28:29.060
 but what are the basic elements?

1:28:29.060 --> 1:28:30.700
 Because it makes us feel good, by the way.

1:28:30.700 --> 1:28:31.540
 We'll get to that.

1:28:31.540 --> 1:28:32.380
 Sude.

1:28:32.380 --> 1:28:33.200
 That's the answer.

1:28:33.200 --> 1:28:34.040
 Sude.

1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:39.040
 It activates what I'm going to generically refer to

1:28:40.180 --> 1:28:43.620
 as reward pleasure centers in a way

1:28:43.620 --> 1:28:48.460
 that dramatically changes our internal state.

1:28:48.460 --> 1:28:50.680
 This is, you know, why do we eat a gallon of ice cream

1:28:50.680 --> 1:28:52.760
 when we're very depressed?

1:28:52.760 --> 1:28:53.600
 Yeah?

1:28:53.600 --> 1:28:55.100
 In fact, this is a good segue

1:28:55.100 --> 1:28:59.760
 to go into this entirely different world, yeah?

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:04.760
 Of the body telling your brain what you need

1:29:07.220 --> 1:29:11.020
 in important things like sugar and fat, yeah?

1:29:11.020 --> 1:29:12.440
 Okay, but anyways, go ahead.

1:29:12.440 --> 1:29:13.580
 You were going to ask something.

1:29:13.580 --> 1:29:17.600
 Well, no, I would like to discuss the most basic elements

1:29:17.600 --> 1:29:20.580
 of internal state, in particular,

1:29:20.580 --> 1:29:23.140
 the ones that are below our conscious detection.

1:29:23.140 --> 1:29:26.820
 And this is a, of course, is a segue

1:29:26.820 --> 1:29:29.180
 into this incredible landscape,

1:29:29.180 --> 1:29:31.060
 which is the gut-brain axis,

1:29:31.060 --> 1:29:35.540
 which I think 15 years ago was almost a,

1:29:35.540 --> 1:29:38.360
 maybe it was a couple posters at a meeting.

1:29:38.360 --> 1:29:41.740
 And then now I believe you and others,

1:29:41.740 --> 1:29:44.140
 there are companies, there have companies,

1:29:44.140 --> 1:29:47.540
 there are active research programs, there's,

1:29:47.540 --> 1:29:49.420
 and beautiful work.

1:29:49.420 --> 1:29:50.800
 Maybe you could describe some of that work

1:29:50.800 --> 1:29:52.740
 that you and others have been involved in.

1:29:52.740 --> 1:29:56.440
 And a lot of the listeners of this podcast

1:29:56.440 --> 1:29:58.300
 will have heard of the gut-brain axis,

1:29:58.300 --> 1:30:00.580
 and there are a lot of misconceptions

1:30:00.580 --> 1:30:01.580
 about the gut-brain axis.

1:30:01.580 --> 1:30:03.140
 Many people think that this means

1:30:03.140 --> 1:30:04.740
 that we think with our stomach

1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:08.740
 because of the quote-unquote gut feeling aspect,

1:30:08.740 --> 1:30:11.220
 but I'd love for you to talk about the aspects

1:30:11.220 --> 1:30:13.940
 of gut-brain signaling that drive our,

1:30:13.940 --> 1:30:15.820
 or change our perceptions and behaviors

1:30:15.820 --> 1:30:18.300
 that are completely beneath our awareness.

1:30:18.300 --> 1:30:19.780
 Yes, excellent.

1:30:19.780 --> 1:30:24.620
 So let me begin maybe by stating

1:30:24.620 --> 1:30:29.260
 that the brain needs to monitor

1:30:30.620 --> 1:30:34.580
 the state of every one of our organs.

1:30:34.580 --> 1:30:35.940
 It has to do it.

1:30:35.940 --> 1:30:39.300
 This is the only way that the brain can ensure

1:30:40.300 --> 1:30:44.440
 that every one of those organs are working together

1:30:44.440 --> 1:30:47.320
 in a way that we have healthy physiology.

1:30:49.320 --> 1:30:52.660
 Now, this monitoring of the brain

1:30:52.660 --> 1:30:55.340
 has been known for a long time,

1:30:55.340 --> 1:30:57.700
 but I think what hadn't been fully appreciated,

1:30:57.700 --> 1:31:00.220
 that this is a two-way highway

1:31:00.220 --> 1:31:03.100
 where the brain is not only monitoring,

1:31:04.100 --> 1:31:09.100
 but is now modulating back what the body needs to do.

1:31:10.900 --> 1:31:13.880
 And that includes all the way from monitoring

1:31:13.880 --> 1:31:16.140
 the frequency of heartbeats

1:31:16.140 --> 1:31:19.540
 and the way that inspiration and aspirations

1:31:19.540 --> 1:31:21.380
 in the breathing cycle operate

1:31:21.380 --> 1:31:25.700
 to what happens when you ingest sugar and fat.

1:31:28.300 --> 1:31:32.780
 Now, let me give you an example again

1:31:32.780 --> 1:31:37.780
 of how the brain can take

1:31:41.020 --> 1:31:45.680
 what we would refer to contextual associations

1:31:45.680 --> 1:31:49.200
 and transform it into incredible changes

1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:51.480
 in physiology and metabolism.

1:31:52.980 --> 1:31:54.180
 Remember Pavlov?

1:31:54.180 --> 1:31:56.760
 So Pavlov in his classical experiments

1:31:56.760 --> 1:32:00.180
 in conditioning, you know, associative conditioning,

1:32:00.180 --> 1:32:03.940
 he would take a bell, it would ring the bell

1:32:03.940 --> 1:32:06.180
 every time he was going to feed the dog.

1:32:07.540 --> 1:32:10.760
 And eventually the dog learned to associate

1:32:10.760 --> 1:32:13.620
 the ringing of the bell with food coming.

1:32:15.860 --> 1:32:18.820
 Now, the first incredible finding he made

1:32:18.820 --> 1:32:21.900
 is the fact that the dog now,

1:32:21.900 --> 1:32:24.420
 in the presence of the bell alone,

1:32:24.420 --> 1:32:25.940
 will start to salivate.

1:32:27.140 --> 1:32:30.660
 And we will call that, you know, neurologically speaking,

1:32:30.660 --> 1:32:32.900
 an anticipatory response.

1:32:34.100 --> 1:32:36.900
 Okay, I could understand it, I get it.

1:32:36.900 --> 1:32:40.380
 You know, neurons in the brain that form that association

1:32:40.380 --> 1:32:42.860
 now represent food is coming

1:32:42.860 --> 1:32:46.740
 and they're sending a signal to motor neurons

1:32:46.740 --> 1:32:50.040
 to go into your salivary glands to squeeze them

1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:53.460
 so you release, you know, saliva

1:32:53.460 --> 1:32:55.920
 because you know food is coming.

1:32:55.920 --> 1:32:58.020
 But what's even more remarkable

1:32:58.020 --> 1:33:01.300
 is that those animals are also releasing insulin

1:33:02.820 --> 1:33:05.260
 in response to a bell.

1:33:06.220 --> 1:33:07.060
 Okay.

1:33:08.540 --> 1:33:13.060
 This illustrates one part of this two-way highway,

1:33:13.060 --> 1:33:14.760
 the highway going down.

1:33:14.760 --> 1:33:17.320
 Somehow the brain created these associations

1:33:17.320 --> 1:33:19.560
 and there are neurons in your brain now

1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:21.720
 that know food is coming

1:33:21.720 --> 1:33:24.480
 and send a signal somehow all the way down to your pancreas

1:33:25.720 --> 1:33:27.480
 that now it says release insulin

1:33:27.480 --> 1:33:30.560
 because sugar is coming down.

1:33:31.800 --> 1:33:34.520
 All right, this goes back to the magic of the brain.

1:33:34.520 --> 1:33:39.320
 It's a never-ending source of both joy and intrigue.

1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:40.920
 How the hell do they do this?

1:33:40.920 --> 1:33:43.240
 Okay, I mean the neurons, eh?

1:33:43.240 --> 1:33:45.420
 I mean the neurons, eh?

1:33:45.420 --> 1:33:47.760
 I share your delight and fascination.

1:33:47.760 --> 1:33:50.640
 There's not a day or a lecture

1:33:50.640 --> 1:33:54.040
 or some talks are better than others

1:33:54.040 --> 1:33:56.400
 or a talk where I don't sit back and just think

1:33:56.400 --> 1:33:57.960
 it's absolutely amazing.

1:33:57.960 --> 1:33:58.800
 How?

1:33:58.800 --> 1:33:59.640
 It's amazing.

1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:01.120
 It's amazing.

1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:03.720
 Now over the past, I don't know, dozen years

1:34:04.960 --> 1:34:08.040
 and with great force over the last five years.

1:34:09.740 --> 1:34:12.840
 Now the main highway that is communicating

1:34:12.840 --> 1:34:16.160
 the state of the body with the brain

1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:19.040
 has been uncovered,

1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:23.680
 has been what we now refer to as the gut-brain axis

1:34:23.680 --> 1:34:27.680
 and the highway is a specific bundle of nerves

1:34:29.320 --> 1:34:32.960
 which emerge from the vagal ganglia, the nodos ganglia

1:34:32.960 --> 1:34:35.000
 and so it's the vagus nerve

1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:39.200
 that it's innervating the majority

1:34:39.200 --> 1:34:40.960
 of the organs in your body.

1:34:40.960 --> 1:34:44.480
 It's monitoring their function,

1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:46.880
 sending a signal to the brain

1:34:46.880 --> 1:34:50.360
 and now the brain going back down and saying

1:34:50.360 --> 1:34:52.200
 this is going all right, do this

1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:54.900
 or this is not going so well, do that.

1:34:54.900 --> 1:34:57.840
 And I should point out, as you well know,

1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:01.640
 every organ, spleen, pancreas, lungs.

1:35:01.640 --> 1:35:04.240
 They all must be monitored.

1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:07.560
 Otherwise, in fact, you know, I now,

1:35:07.560 --> 1:35:11.080
 I have no doubt that diseases that we have

1:35:11.080 --> 1:35:15.120
 normally associated with metabolism, physiology

1:35:15.120 --> 1:35:20.120
 and even immunity are likely to emerge

1:35:21.460 --> 1:35:25.920
 as diseases, conditions, states of the brain.

1:35:27.420 --> 1:35:30.460
 I don't think obesity is a disease of metabolism.

1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:35.780
 I believe obesity is a disease of brain circuits.

1:35:35.780 --> 1:35:40.780
 I do as well and so this view that we have,

1:35:40.880 --> 1:35:44.280
 you know, been working on for the longest time

1:35:44.280 --> 1:35:47.520
 because, you know, the molecules that we're dealing with

1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:50.400
 are in the body, not in the head.

1:35:50.400 --> 1:35:53.320
 You know, led us to view, of course,

1:35:53.320 --> 1:35:56.360
 these issues and problems as being one

1:35:56.360 --> 1:35:58.520
 of metabolism, physiology and so forth.

1:35:58.520 --> 1:36:03.200
 They remain to be the carriers of the ultimate signal

1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:07.260
 but the brain ultimately appears to be the conductor

1:36:07.260 --> 1:36:11.440
 of this orchestra of physiology and metabolism.

1:36:11.440 --> 1:36:15.120
 All right, now let's go to the gut, brain and sugar.

1:36:16.680 --> 1:36:17.680
 May we?

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:19.800
 Please, please.

1:36:19.800 --> 1:36:24.800
 No, I mean, the vagus nerve has, in popular culture,

1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:31.480
 has been kind of converted into this single meaning

1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:35.120
 of calming pathways, mostly because,

1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:38.560
 I actually have to tip my hat to the yogic community

1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:43.000
 was among the first to talk about vagus on and on and on.

1:36:44.320 --> 1:36:47.240
 There are calming pathways that are, you know,

1:36:47.240 --> 1:36:49.880
 so-called parasympathetic pathways within the vagus

1:36:49.880 --> 1:36:52.760
 but I think that the more we learn about the vagus,

1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:57.000
 the more it seems like an entire set of neural connections

1:36:57.000 --> 1:36:58.480
 as opposed to one nerve.

1:36:58.480 --> 1:36:59.680
 I just wanted to just mention that

1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:01.240
 because I think a lot of people have heard

1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:04.520
 about the vagus, turns out experimentally in the laboratory,

1:37:04.520 --> 1:37:07.000
 many neuroscientists will stimulate the vagus

1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:10.000
 to create states of alertness and arousal

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.720
 when animals or even people, believe it or not,

1:37:12.720 --> 1:37:14.920
 are close to dying or going into coma.

1:37:14.920 --> 1:37:16.740
 Stimulation of the vagus is one of the ways

1:37:16.740 --> 1:37:19.580
 to wake up the brain, counter to the idea

1:37:19.580 --> 1:37:22.320
 that it's just this way of calming oneself down.

1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:24.020
 And also, of course, I mean,

1:37:24.020 --> 1:37:26.680
 one has to be cautious there in that.

1:37:26.680 --> 1:37:31.680
 So the vagus nerve is made out of many thousands of fibers.

1:37:34.440 --> 1:37:38.160
 You know, individual fibers that make this gigantic bundle

1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:40.440
 and it's likely, as we're speaking,

1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:42.820
 that each of these fibers carries

1:37:42.820 --> 1:37:45.480
 a slightly different meaning, okay?

1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:47.120
 Not necessarily one by one,

1:37:47.120 --> 1:37:50.560
 maybe five fibers, 10 fibers, 22, all right.

1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:54.960
 But they carry meaning that's associated

1:37:54.960 --> 1:37:58.120
 with their specific task.

1:37:58.120 --> 1:38:00.800
 This group of fibers is telling the brain

1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:02.940
 about the state of your heart.

1:38:03.780 --> 1:38:06.240
 This group of fiber is telling the brain

1:38:06.240 --> 1:38:08.880
 about the state of your gut.

1:38:08.880 --> 1:38:13.040
 This is telling your brain about its nutritional state.

1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:17.440
 This, your pancreas, this, your lungs.

1:38:17.440 --> 1:38:22.440
 And they are, again, to make the same simple example,

1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:25.640
 simple example, the keys of this piano.

1:38:27.400 --> 1:38:30.280
 Yes, you're right, there is a lot of data

1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:36.920
 showing that activating the entire vagal bundle

1:38:36.920 --> 1:38:41.920
 has very meaningful effect in a wide range of conditions.

1:38:42.880 --> 1:38:47.880
 In fact, it's being used to treat untractable depression.

1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:52.880
 A little stimulator, epileptic seizures.

1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:57.760
 But again, there are thousands of fibers

1:38:57.760 --> 1:38:59.600
 carrying different functions.

1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:04.600
 So to some degree, this is like turning the lights

1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:15.140
 on the stadium because you need to illuminate

1:39:15.140 --> 1:39:18.720
 where you lost your keys under your seat.

1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:23.720
 Yet 10,000 volts of 1,000 watts each have just come on.

1:39:26.440 --> 1:39:28.860
 Only one of these is pointing to where.

1:39:29.840 --> 1:39:32.320
 And so I'm lucky enough that one of them

1:39:32.320 --> 1:39:35.200
 happened to point to my site.

1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:39.960
 So here you activate the bundle, thousands of fibers.

1:39:39.960 --> 1:39:43.840
 I'm lucky enough that some of those happen to do something

1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:48.000
 to make a meaningful difference in depression

1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:51.540
 or to make a meaningful difference in epileptic.

1:39:51.540 --> 1:39:56.540
 But it should not be misconstrued as arguing

1:39:56.880 --> 1:40:01.840
 that this broad activation has any type

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:05.000
 of selectivity or specificity.

1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:07.320
 We're just lucky enough that among all the things

1:40:07.320 --> 1:40:12.160
 that are being done, some of those happen to change

1:40:12.160 --> 1:40:14.600
 the biology of these processes.

1:40:14.600 --> 1:40:18.480
 Now, the reason this is relevant because the magic

1:40:18.480 --> 1:40:22.440
 of this gut-brain axis is the fact that you have

1:40:22.440 --> 1:40:27.220
 these thousands of fibers really doing different functions.

1:40:27.220 --> 1:40:32.220
 And our goal, and along with many other great scientists,

1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:40.100
 including Steve Liverless that started a lot

1:40:40.100 --> 1:40:45.100
 of this molecular dissection on this vagal gut-brain

1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:48.180
 communication line at Harvard,

1:40:49.680 --> 1:40:54.480
 is trying to uncover what are each of those lines doing?

1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:57.860
 What are each of those keys of this piano playing?

1:40:59.120 --> 1:41:00.120
 What's the latest there?

1:41:00.120 --> 1:41:03.000
 Just as a brief update, I know Steven Liverless,

1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:05.940
 I think I was there when he got his Howard Hughes

1:41:05.940 --> 1:41:07.740
 and I did not, so that was fun.

1:41:07.740 --> 1:41:10.120
 Always great to get beat by excellent people.

1:41:10.120 --> 1:41:11.380
 First of all, I'm happy you did them

1:41:11.380 --> 1:41:15.960
 because that way you can focus on this amazing podcast.

1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:18.040
 Thank you, that's very gracious of you.

1:41:18.040 --> 1:41:21.840
 It always feels better, it's not good,

1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:23.220
 to get beat out by excellent people.

1:41:23.220 --> 1:41:28.220
 Steven is second to none and he is defining,

1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:31.240
 as you said, the molecular constituents

1:41:31.240 --> 1:41:33.620
 of different elements of these many, many fibers.

1:41:33.620 --> 1:41:34.560
 Is there an update there?

1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:37.000
 Are they finding multiple parallel pathways?

1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:38.000
 They are, they are.

1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.200
 Some that control heartbeat,

1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:43.000
 some that control the respiratory cycle,

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:48.000
 some that might be involved in a gastric movement,

1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:52.360
 you know, this notion that you're full

1:41:52.360 --> 1:41:57.280
 and you feel full in part because your gut gets distended,

1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:58.640
 your stomach, for example,

1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:02.840
 and then there are little sensors that are reading that

1:42:02.840 --> 1:42:05.400
 and telling the brain you're full.

1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:08.520
 Yeah, so the text books will soon change

1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:10.440
 on the basis of the liberalese and other work.

1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:13.800
 In essence, I think we are learning enough

1:42:13.800 --> 1:42:18.800
 about these lines that could really help put together

1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:26.520
 this holistic view of, you know, how the brain,

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:32.280
 it's truly changing body physiology, metabolism, and immunity.

1:42:32.280 --> 1:42:35.920
 The part that hasn't been yet developed

1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:38.080
 and that it needs a fair amount of work,

1:42:38.080 --> 1:42:41.680
 but it's an exciting, thrilling, you know,

1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:46.160
 journey of discovery is how the signal comes back

1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:49.080
 to now change that biology.

1:42:49.080 --> 1:42:51.960
 You know, the example I gave you before with Pavlov's dog.

1:42:51.960 --> 1:42:55.920
 Yeah, all right, I figure out, you know,

1:42:55.920 --> 1:42:59.640
 how the association created this link between the belt,

1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:01.640
 but then how does the brain tell the path?

1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:04.120
 How does the brain tell the pancreas

1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:07.880
 to release in the right amount of insulin?

1:43:07.880 --> 1:43:09.600
 Okay, so tell me, tell me,

1:43:10.760 --> 1:43:15.760
 let me tell you about the gut-brain axis

1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:21.600
 and our insatiable appetite for sugar and fat.

1:43:23.360 --> 1:43:27.000
 Insatiable for sugar and quenchable for fat.

1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:32.000
 And this is a story about the fundamental difference

1:43:34.920 --> 1:43:38.880
 between liking and wanting.

1:43:41.040 --> 1:43:46.040
 Liking sugar is the function of the taste system.

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:53.440
 And it's not really liking sugar, it's liking sweet.

1:43:53.440 --> 1:43:58.440
 Wanting sugar, our never-ending appetite for sugar,

1:44:03.880 --> 1:44:08.880
 is the story of the gut-brain axis, liking versus wanting.

1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:14.360
 And this is work of my own laboratory,

1:44:14.360 --> 1:44:16.520
 you know, that began long ago

1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:19.000
 when we discovered the sweet receptors.

1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:24.000
 And you can now engineer mice that lack these receptors.

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:31.440
 So in essence, these animals will be unable to taste sweet.

1:44:32.400 --> 1:44:35.840
 A life without sweetness, how horrible.

1:44:37.160 --> 1:44:42.160
 And if you give a normal mouse a bottle containing sweet,

1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:44.160
 and we're gonna put either sugar

1:44:44.160 --> 1:44:46.800
 or an artificial sweetener, all right?

1:44:46.800 --> 1:44:48.280
 They both are sweet.

1:44:48.280 --> 1:44:50.840
 They have slightly different tastes,

1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:55.280
 but that's simply because artificial sweeteners

1:44:55.280 --> 1:44:57.600
 have some off tastes.

1:44:57.600 --> 1:45:00.600
 But as far as the sweet receptor is concerned,

1:45:00.600 --> 1:45:03.000
 they both activate the same receptor,

1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:04.720
 trigger the same signal.

1:45:05.680 --> 1:45:07.280
 And if you give an animal an option

1:45:07.280 --> 1:45:11.920
 of a bottle containing sugar or a sweetener versus water,

1:45:11.920 --> 1:45:14.600
 this animal will drink 10 to one

1:45:14.600 --> 1:45:17.000
 from the bottle containing sweet.

1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.120
 That's the taste system.

1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:21.800
 Animal Go samples each one, leaks a couple of leaks,

1:45:21.800 --> 1:45:24.120
 and then says, uh-uh, that's the one I want

1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:27.320
 because it's a pettative and because I love it.

1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:29.600
 So it prefers sugar to artificial sweetener?

1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:30.920
 No, no, no, no, no.

1:45:30.920 --> 1:45:31.760
 Equally artificial sweetener.

1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:33.920
 In this experiment, this experiment,

1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:36.760
 I'm gonna put only sweet in one bottle,

1:45:36.760 --> 1:45:39.320
 and it could be either sugar or artificial sweetener.

1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:41.000
 It doesn't matter which one.

1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.040
 Okay, we're gonna do the next experiment

1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:44.360
 where we separate those two.

1:45:44.360 --> 1:45:46.600
 For now, it's sweet versus water.

1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:47.440
 Okay.

1:45:48.320 --> 1:45:51.200
 And sweet means sweet, not sugar.

1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:54.800
 Sweet means anything that tastes sweet, all right?

1:45:54.800 --> 1:45:59.280
 And sugar is one example, and splenda is another example.

1:45:59.280 --> 1:46:03.440
 Aspartame, monk fruit, stevia, doesn't matter.

1:46:03.440 --> 1:46:06.520
 Yeah, I mean, there's some that only humans can taste,

1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:09.960
 mice cannot taste because their receptors

1:46:09.960 --> 1:46:12.600
 between humans and mice are different.

1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:17.000
 But we have put the human receptor into mice.

1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:21.080
 We engineer mice, and we completely humanize

1:46:21.080 --> 1:46:25.920
 this mouse's taste world, all right?

1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:29.560
 But for the purpose of this conversation,

1:46:29.560 --> 1:46:32.360
 we're only comparing sweet versus water.

1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:35.800
 An option, my goodness, they will leak to know

1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:40.720
 from the sweet side, 10 to one at least versus the water.

1:46:40.720 --> 1:46:42.520
 Make sense?

1:46:42.520 --> 1:46:44.760
 All right, now we're gonna take the mice

1:46:44.760 --> 1:46:47.600
 and we're gonna genetically engineer it

1:46:47.600 --> 1:46:49.640
 to remove the sweet receptors.

1:46:50.720 --> 1:46:53.720
 So these mice no longer have in their oral cavity

1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:56.760
 any sensors that can detect sweetness,

1:46:56.760 --> 1:47:00.240
 be that sugar molecule, be it an artificial sweetener,

1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:02.080
 be it anything else that tastes sweet.

1:47:03.720 --> 1:47:06.800
 And if you give these mice an option between

1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:09.400
 sweet versus water, sugar versus water,

1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:11.840
 artificial sweetener versus water,

1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:13.520
 it will drink equally well from both

1:47:13.520 --> 1:47:15.520
 because it cannot tell them apart

1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:17.280
 because it doesn't have the receptors for sweet,

1:47:17.280 --> 1:47:20.480
 so that sweet bottle tastes just like water.

1:47:21.680 --> 1:47:22.520
 Make sense?

1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:23.560
 Makes sense. Very good.

1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:27.200
 Now we're gonna do the experiment with sugar.

1:47:27.200 --> 1:47:29.120
 From now on, let's focus on sugar.

1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:34.120
 So I'm gonna give a mouse now, sugar versus water.

1:47:34.120 --> 1:47:38.680
 Normal mouse will drink from the sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar,

1:47:38.680 --> 1:47:40.080
 very little from the water.

1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:44.240
 Knock out the sweet receptors, eliminate them.

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:46.120
 Mouse can no longer tell them apart

1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:47.640
 and they will drink from both.

1:47:49.200 --> 1:47:54.200
 But if I keep the mouse in that cage for the next 48 hours,

1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:59.960
 something extraordinary happens when I come 48 hours later

1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:03.760
 and I see what the mouse is leaking or drinking from.

1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:06.880
 That mouse is drinking almost exclusively

1:48:06.880 --> 1:48:11.080
 from the sugar bottle. How could this be?

1:48:11.080 --> 1:48:15.360
 It cannot taste it, doesn't have sweet receptors.

1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:21.080
 During those 48 hours, the mouse learn

1:48:21.080 --> 1:48:23.760
 that there is something in that bottle

1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:26.200
 that makes me feel good.

1:48:27.160 --> 1:48:31.120
 And that is the bottle I want to consume.

1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:34.200
 Now, how does the mouse identify that bottle?

1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:38.040
 It does so by using other sensory features.

1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:43.040
 The smell of the bottle, the texture of the solution inside,

1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:46.120
 sugar at high concentrations is kind of goopy.

1:48:47.480 --> 1:48:51.840
 The sadness in which the bottle is in the cage.

1:48:51.840 --> 1:48:55.000
 It doesn't matter what, but the mouse realize

1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:58.880
 there is something there that makes me feel good

1:48:58.880 --> 1:49:00.720
 and that's what I want.

1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:05.680
 And that is the fundamental basis

1:49:05.680 --> 1:49:10.680
 of our unquenchable desire and our craving for sugar

1:49:11.120 --> 1:49:14.400
 and is mediated by the gut brain axis.

1:49:15.360 --> 1:49:18.360
 The first clue is that it takes a long time to develop.

1:49:19.960 --> 1:49:23.880
 Immediately suggesting a post-ingestive effect.

1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:29.960
 So we reason if this is true and it's the gut brain axis

1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:33.240
 that's driving sugar preference,

1:49:34.960 --> 1:49:37.440
 then there should be a group of neurons in the brain

1:49:37.440 --> 1:49:41.920
 that are responding to post-ingestive sugar.

1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:45.280
 And lo and behold, we identify a group of neurons

1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:48.160
 in the brain that does this and these neurons

1:49:48.160 --> 1:49:53.160
 receive their input directly from the gut brain axis.

1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:55.880
 From other neurons.

1:49:55.880 --> 1:49:56.720
 You got it.

1:49:56.720 --> 1:50:01.720
 And so what's happening is that sugar is recognized normally

1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:08.240
 by the tongue, activates an repetitive response.

1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:12.280
 Now you ingest it and now it activates a selective group

1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:17.280
 of cells in your intestines that now send a signal

1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:22.600
 to the brain via the vagal ganglia that says,

1:50:23.360 --> 1:50:25.400
 I got what I need.

1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:28.200
 The tongue doesn't know that you got what you need.

1:50:28.200 --> 1:50:29.880
 It only knows that you tasted it.

1:50:31.320 --> 1:50:33.880
 This knows that it got to the point

1:50:33.880 --> 1:50:37.640
 that it's going to be used, which is the gut.

1:50:37.640 --> 1:50:41.760
 And now it sends the signal to now reinforce

1:50:41.760 --> 1:50:44.240
 the consumption of this thing

1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:46.800
 because this is the one that I needed.

1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:48.960
 Sugar, source of energy.

1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:51.080
 And are these neurons in the gut?

1:50:51.960 --> 1:50:53.560
 So these are not neurons in the gut.

1:50:53.560 --> 1:50:57.560
 So these are gut cells that recognize the sugar molecule,

1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:00.280
 send a signal and that signal is received

1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:02.040
 by the vagal neuron directly.

1:51:02.040 --> 1:51:02.880
 Got it.

1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:07.200
 And this sends a signal through the gut brain axis

1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:11.520
 to the cell bodies of these neurons in the vagal ganglia

1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:14.800
 and from there to the brain stem

1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:18.640
 to now trigger the preference for sugar.

1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:19.560
 Two questions.

1:51:19.560 --> 1:51:23.280
 One, you mentioned that these cells that detect sugar

1:51:23.280 --> 1:51:25.640
 within the gut are actually within the intestine.

1:51:25.640 --> 1:51:28.200
 You didn't say stomach, which surprised me.

1:51:28.200 --> 1:51:31.160
 I always think gut as stomach, but of course intestines.

1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:32.200
 They're intestine because that's where

1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:33.640
 all the absorption happens.

1:51:33.640 --> 1:51:35.360
 So you want the signal.

1:51:35.360 --> 1:51:36.600
 You see, you want the brain to know

1:51:36.600 --> 1:51:41.240
 that you had successful ingestion and breakdown

1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:45.360
 of whatever you consume into the building blocks of life.

1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:50.040
 And you know, glucose, amino acids, fat.

1:51:50.040 --> 1:51:53.880
 And so you wanna make sure that once they are in the form

1:51:53.880 --> 1:51:56.280
 that intestines can now absorb them

1:51:57.240 --> 1:51:59.560
 is where you get the signal back saying,

1:51:59.560 --> 1:52:01.600
 this is what I want, okay?

1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:04.120
 Now, let me just take it one step further.

1:52:05.960 --> 1:52:09.960
 And this now sugar molecules activates

1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:12.520
 this unique gut brain circuit

1:52:12.520 --> 1:52:17.520
 that now drives the development of our preference for sugar.

1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:22.520
 Now, a key element of this circuit is that the sensors

1:52:22.640 --> 1:52:26.640
 in the gut that recognize the sugar

1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:31.240
 do not recognize artificial sweeteners at all.

1:52:31.240 --> 1:52:33.160
 Right, because their nutrient value

1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:35.200
 is uncoupled from the taste.

1:52:37.120 --> 1:52:40.000
 Generically speaking, one can make that,

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.320
 but it's because it's a very different type of receptor.

1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:43.160
 I see.

1:52:43.160 --> 1:52:44.760
 Turns out that it's not the tongue receptors

1:52:44.760 --> 1:52:46.280
 being used in the gut.

1:52:46.280 --> 1:52:47.840
 It's a completely different molecule

1:52:47.840 --> 1:52:51.560
 that only recognizes the glucose molecule,

1:52:51.560 --> 1:52:53.720
 not artificial sweeteners.

1:52:53.720 --> 1:52:58.720
 This has a profound impact on the effect

1:52:59.440 --> 1:53:02.480
 of ultimately artificial sweeteners

1:53:02.480 --> 1:53:05.600
 in curbing our appetite,

1:53:05.600 --> 1:53:09.480
 our craving, our insatiable desire for sugar.

1:53:10.840 --> 1:53:14.080
 Since they don't activate the gut brain axis,

1:53:14.080 --> 1:53:19.080
 they'll never satisfy the craving for sugar like sugar does.

1:53:21.160 --> 1:53:24.320
 And the reason I believe that artificial sweeteners

1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:29.320
 have failed in the market to curve our appetite,

1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:33.120
 our need, our desire for sugar

1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.720
 is because they beautifully work on the tongue,

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:42.760
 the liking, the desire for sugar.

1:53:42.760 --> 1:53:47.760
 The liking to recognize sweet versus non-sweet,

1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:54.560
 but they fail to activate the key sensors in the gut

1:53:54.560 --> 1:53:57.080
 that now inform the brain,

1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:02.720
 you got sugar, no need to crave anymore.

1:54:02.720 --> 1:54:07.200
 So the issue of wanting,

1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:10.480
 can we relate that to a particular set of neurochemicals

1:54:10.480 --> 1:54:12.840
 upstream of, so the pathway is,

1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:15.720
 so glucose is activating these cells in the gut

1:54:15.720 --> 1:54:17.760
 through the vagus that's communicated

1:54:17.760 --> 1:54:19.840
 through presumably the nodose ganglion

1:54:19.840 --> 1:54:21.080
 and up into the brainstem.

1:54:21.080 --> 1:54:21.920
 Very good.

1:54:21.920 --> 1:54:23.120
 And from there, where does it go?

1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:23.960
 Yeah, where does it go

1:54:23.960 --> 1:54:25.840
 and what is the substrate of wanting?

1:54:25.840 --> 1:54:29.400
 I, you know, of course I think molecules like dopamine,

1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:31.560
 craving, there's a book even called

1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:34.400
 The Molecule of More, et cetera, et cetera.

1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:37.720
 Dopamine is a very diabolical molecule, as you know,

1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:41.520
 because it evokes both a sense of pleasure-ish,

1:54:41.520 --> 1:54:44.920
 but also a sense of desiring more, of craving.

1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:47.440
 So if I understand you correctly,

1:54:47.440 --> 1:54:49.800
 artificial sweeteners, and I agree,

1:54:49.800 --> 1:54:53.140
 are failing as a means to satisfy sugar craving

1:54:53.140 --> 1:54:55.900
 at the level of nutrient sensing.

1:54:57.640 --> 1:55:02.640
 And yet if we trigger this true sugar evoked

1:55:02.720 --> 1:55:07.320
 wanting pathway too much, and we've all experienced this,

1:55:07.320 --> 1:55:09.580
 then we eat sugar and we find ourselves

1:55:09.580 --> 1:55:10.900
 wanting more and more sugar.

1:55:10.900 --> 1:55:13.800
 Now that could also be insulin dysregulation,

1:55:13.800 --> 1:55:15.660
 but can we uncouple those?

1:55:15.660 --> 1:55:16.820
 Yeah, I mean, look,

1:55:19.880 --> 1:55:23.440
 if we have a mega problem

1:55:24.340 --> 1:55:26.820
 with overconsumption of sugar and fat,

1:55:29.400 --> 1:55:32.440
 we're facing a unique time in our evolution

1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:37.440
 where diseases of malnutrition are due to overnutrition.

1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:42.600
 I mean, how nuts is that, eh?

1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:46.080
 I mean, historically, diseases of malnutrition

1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:49.200
 have always been linked to undernutrition.

1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:54.660
 And so we need to come up with strategies

1:55:54.660 --> 1:55:57.720
 that can meaningfully change

1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:02.720
 the activation of these circuits

1:56:03.420 --> 1:56:08.080
 that control our wanting,

1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:10.880
 certainly in the populations at risk.

1:56:13.620 --> 1:56:18.420
 And this gut-brain circuit

1:56:18.420 --> 1:56:22.740
 that ultimately, you know, it's the lines of communication

1:56:22.740 --> 1:56:25.420
 that are informing the brain,

1:56:25.420 --> 1:56:28.620
 the presence of intestinal sugar in this example.

1:56:29.580 --> 1:56:34.380
 It's a very important target in the way we think about

1:56:34.380 --> 1:56:36.060
 is there a way that we can meaningfully

1:56:36.060 --> 1:56:37.980
 modulate these circuits?

1:56:37.980 --> 1:56:42.980
 So I make your brain think that you got satisfied

1:56:44.640 --> 1:56:47.520
 with sugar, even though I'm not giving you sugar.

1:56:47.520 --> 1:56:49.760
 So that immediately raises the question,

1:56:49.760 --> 1:56:53.620
 are the receptors for glucose in these gut cells

1:56:53.620 --> 1:56:57.780
 susceptible to other things that are healthier for us?

1:56:57.780 --> 1:57:01.260
 That's very good, excellent idea.

1:57:01.260 --> 1:57:04.060
 And I think an important goal

1:57:04.060 --> 1:57:07.420
 will be to come up with a strategy

1:57:07.420 --> 1:57:11.380
 and identify those very means

1:57:11.380 --> 1:57:14.240
 that allow us to modulate the circuits

1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:18.940
 in a way that, certainly for all of those

1:57:18.940 --> 1:57:20.560
 where this is a big issue,

1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:25.560
 it can really have a, you know, dramatic impact

1:57:25.920 --> 1:57:28.440
 in improving human health.

1:57:28.440 --> 1:57:30.880
 I could be wrong about this and I'm happy to be wrong.

1:57:30.880 --> 1:57:34.660
 I'm often wrong and told I'm wrong.

1:57:35.800 --> 1:57:38.000
 That we have cells within our gut

1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:42.420
 that don't just sense sugar, glucose, to be specific,

1:57:42.420 --> 1:57:44.520
 but also cells within our gut

1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:47.260
 that sense amino acids and fatty acids.

1:57:47.260 --> 1:57:52.020
 I could imagine a scenario where one could train themselves

1:57:52.020 --> 1:57:55.760
 to feel immense amounts of satiety

1:57:55.760 --> 1:57:57.660
 from the consumption of foods

1:57:57.660 --> 1:58:01.460
 that are rich in essential fatty acids, amino acids,

1:58:01.460 --> 1:58:03.460
 perhaps less caloric

1:58:03.460 --> 1:58:07.300
 or less insulin-disregulating than sugar.

1:58:08.260 --> 1:58:09.540
 I'll use myself as an example.

1:58:09.540 --> 1:58:12.440
 I've always enjoyed sweets, but in the last few years,

1:58:12.440 --> 1:58:15.480
 for some reason, I've started to lose my appetite for them,

1:58:15.480 --> 1:58:18.140
 probably because I just don't eat them anymore.

1:58:18.140 --> 1:58:20.100
 At first, that took some restriction.

1:58:20.100 --> 1:58:21.900
 Now I just don't even think about it.

1:58:21.900 --> 1:58:24.900
 Yeah, and you're not reinforcing the circuits.

1:58:24.900 --> 1:58:28.820
 And so you're, in essence, are removing yourself,

1:58:28.820 --> 1:58:32.340
 but you tend to be the exception.

1:58:32.340 --> 1:58:35.880
 You know, we have a huge,

1:58:35.880 --> 1:58:38.940
 a huge, incredible large number of people

1:58:38.940 --> 1:58:41.260
 that are being continuously exposed

1:58:41.260 --> 1:58:43.740
 to highly processed foods, yeah?

1:58:43.740 --> 1:58:46.580
 And hidden, so-called hidden sugars.

1:58:46.580 --> 1:58:48.340
 They don't even have to be hidden.

1:58:48.340 --> 1:58:49.620
 You know, it's right there.

1:58:49.620 --> 1:58:51.140
 Hiding in plain sight.

1:58:51.140 --> 1:58:52.020
 Yeah, I agree.

1:58:52.020 --> 1:58:54.220
 So much is made of hidden sugars

1:58:54.220 --> 1:58:57.060
 that we often overlook that they are,

1:58:57.060 --> 1:58:58.820
 there are also the overt sugars.

1:58:58.820 --> 1:59:02.060
 Yeah, I mean, we can have a long discussion

1:59:02.060 --> 1:59:06.380
 on the importance of coming up with strategies,

1:59:06.380 --> 1:59:10.080
 you know, that could meaningfully change public health

1:59:10.080 --> 1:59:11.760
 when it comes to nutrition.

1:59:11.760 --> 1:59:16.760
 But I want to just go back to the notion of, you know,

1:59:16.840 --> 1:59:20.600
 these brain centers that are ultimately

1:59:20.600 --> 1:59:23.520
 the ones that are being activated

1:59:23.520 --> 1:59:25.520
 by these essential nutrients.

1:59:25.520 --> 1:59:28.120
 So sugar, fat, and amino acids

1:59:28.120 --> 1:59:33.120
 are building blocks of our diets.

1:59:33.320 --> 1:59:36.560
 And this is across all animal species.

1:59:36.560 --> 1:59:39.780
 So it's not unreasonable then to assume

1:59:39.780 --> 1:59:43.520
 that dedicated brain circuits would have evolved

1:59:43.520 --> 1:59:46.760
 to ensure their recognition,

1:59:49.120 --> 1:59:54.120
 their ingestion, and the reinforcement

1:59:54.120 --> 1:59:56.800
 that that is what they need.

1:59:58.720 --> 2:00:03.720
 And indeed, you know, animals evolved these two systems.

2:00:03.720 --> 2:00:08.720
 One is the taste system that allows you to recognize them

2:00:12.240 --> 2:00:15.160
 and trigger these predetermined hardwired

2:00:15.160 --> 2:00:17.840
 immediate responses, yes?

2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:20.760
 Oh my goodness, this tastes so good, it's so sweet.

2:00:20.760 --> 2:00:23.580
 I personally have a sweet tooth, may I add.

2:00:23.580 --> 2:00:25.940
 And you know, oh my God, this is so delicious,

2:00:25.940 --> 2:00:29.840
 it's fatty or umami recognizing amino acids.

2:00:29.840 --> 2:00:34.540
 So that's the liking pathway, yeah?

2:00:34.540 --> 2:00:38.340
 But in the wisdom of evolution,

2:00:39.440 --> 2:00:41.960
 that's good but doesn't quite do it.

2:00:41.960 --> 2:00:43.360
 You want to make sure that these things

2:00:43.360 --> 2:00:45.980
 get to the place where they are needed.

2:00:45.980 --> 2:00:48.160
 And they are not needed in your tongue.

2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:51.520
 They are needed in your intestines

2:00:51.520 --> 2:00:53.740
 where they are going to be absorbed

2:00:53.740 --> 2:00:56.520
 as the nutrients that will support life.

2:00:56.520 --> 2:01:01.520
 And the brain wants to know this.

2:01:03.140 --> 2:01:05.080
 And it wants to know it in a way

2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:07.920
 that it can now form the association

2:01:07.920 --> 2:01:11.620
 between that that I just tasted

2:01:13.460 --> 2:01:15.940
 is what got where it needs to be

2:01:16.940 --> 2:01:18.880
 and it makes me feel good.

2:01:20.140 --> 2:01:23.780
 And so now, next time that I have to choose,

2:01:23.780 --> 2:01:28.780
 what should I eat, that association now guides me to,

2:01:30.420 --> 2:01:32.260
 that's the one I want.

2:01:32.260 --> 2:01:34.960
 I want that fruit, not that fruit.

2:01:36.080 --> 2:01:39.500
 I want those leaves, not those leaves

2:01:39.500 --> 2:01:42.780
 because these are the ones that activate the right circuits

2:01:42.780 --> 2:01:44.380
 that ensure that the right nutrients

2:01:44.380 --> 2:01:46.680
 got to the right place and told the brain,

2:01:47.920 --> 2:01:50.860
 this is what I want and need.

2:01:52.540 --> 2:01:53.380
 Are we on?

2:01:53.380 --> 2:01:54.740
 We're on.

2:01:54.740 --> 2:01:57.620
 One thing that intrigues me and puzzles me

2:01:57.620 --> 2:02:02.560
 is that this effect took a couple of days, at least in mice.

2:02:02.560 --> 2:02:06.020
 And the sensation, sorry, the perception of taste

2:02:06.020 --> 2:02:09.140
 is immediate and yet this is a slow system.

2:02:09.140 --> 2:02:13.800
 And so in a beautiful way, but in a kind of mysterious way,

2:02:13.800 --> 2:02:17.460
 the brain is able to couple the taste of a sweet drink

2:02:17.460 --> 2:02:20.340
 with the experience of nutrient extraction in the gut

2:02:20.340 --> 2:02:24.800
 under a context where the mouse and the human

2:02:24.800 --> 2:02:26.620
 is presumably ingesting other things,

2:02:26.620 --> 2:02:29.040
 smelling other mice, smelling other people.

2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:30.280
 That's incredible.

2:02:30.280 --> 2:02:33.300
 Yeah, but you have to think of it not as humans.

2:02:33.300 --> 2:02:38.300
 Remember, we inherited the circuits of our ancestors

2:02:40.060 --> 2:02:44.880
 and they, through evolutionary, from their ancestors.

2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:48.460
 And we haven't had that many years

2:02:48.460 --> 2:02:50.800
 to have fundamentally changed

2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:53.160
 in many of these hardwired circuits.

2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:57.960
 So forget, as humans, let's look at animals in the wild,

2:02:57.960 --> 2:03:01.380
 okay, which is easier now to comprehend the logic.

2:03:03.620 --> 2:03:08.620
 Why should this take a long time of continued reinforcement

2:03:09.180 --> 2:03:12.040
 given that I can taste it in a second?

2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:16.840
 You wanna make sure that this source of sugar,

2:03:16.840 --> 2:03:21.640
 for example, in the wild is the best, is the richest,

2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:24.280
 is the one where I get the most energy

2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:29.100
 for the least amount of extraction,

2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:32.040
 the least amount of work.

2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:37.000
 I wanna identify rich sources of sugar.

2:03:37.000 --> 2:03:40.880
 And if the system simply responds immediately

2:03:40.880 --> 2:03:43.440
 to the first sugar that gets to your gut,

2:03:43.440 --> 2:03:46.640
 you're gonna form the association

2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:49.120
 with those sources of food,

2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:52.620
 which are not the ones that you should be eating from.

2:03:52.620 --> 2:03:55.200
 Don't fall in love with the first person you encounter.

2:03:55.200 --> 2:03:58.360
 Oh my goodness, exactly.

2:03:58.360 --> 2:04:02.780
 And so evolutionarily, by having the taste system

2:04:02.780 --> 2:04:05.120
 giving you the immediate recognition,

2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:08.820
 but then by forcing this gut brain access

2:04:08.820 --> 2:04:13.360
 to reinforce it only when sustained,

2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:17.520
 you know, repeated exposure has informed the brain,

2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:20.280
 this is the one,

2:04:20.280 --> 2:04:22.520
 you don't wanna form the association before.

2:04:23.860 --> 2:04:27.120
 And so, you know, when we remove it from the context of,

2:04:27.120 --> 2:04:30.960
 you know, we just go to, you know, the supermarket.

2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:36.080
 We're not hunting there in the wild where I need to form.

2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:41.080
 And so what's happening is that highly processed foods

2:04:41.080 --> 2:04:46.080
 are hijacking, you know,

2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:48.680
 co-opting the circuits in a way

2:04:49.760 --> 2:04:52.040
 that it would have never happened in nature.

2:04:52.040 --> 2:04:54.840
 And then we not only find these things

2:04:54.840 --> 2:04:56.680
 appetitive and palatable,

2:04:56.680 --> 2:05:00.460
 but in addition, we are continuously reinforcing,

2:05:00.460 --> 2:05:02.920
 you know, the wanting in a way that,

2:05:02.920 --> 2:05:04.240
 oh my God, this is so great.

2:05:04.240 --> 2:05:05.280
 What do I feel like eating?

2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:07.240
 Let me have more of this.

2:05:07.240 --> 2:05:09.160
 You've just forever changed the way

2:05:09.160 --> 2:05:12.460
 that I think about supermarkets and restaurants.

2:05:12.460 --> 2:05:16.460
 There are, understanding this fast signaling

2:05:16.460 --> 2:05:19.160
 and this slower signaling and the utility of having both

2:05:20.200 --> 2:05:23.720
 makes me realize that supermarkets and restaurants

2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:28.120
 are about the most unnatural thing for our system ever.

2:05:28.120 --> 2:05:31.980
 Almost the equivalent of living in small villages

2:05:31.980 --> 2:05:34.020
 with very few suitable mates

2:05:34.020 --> 2:05:35.720
 versus online dating, for instance.

2:05:35.720 --> 2:05:38.120
 Look, I'm not gonna make a judgment call there

2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:40.040
 because they do serve an important purpose.

2:05:40.040 --> 2:05:41.320
 I like restaurants too.

2:05:41.320 --> 2:05:44.200
 Yeah, and so do supermarkets, thank God.

2:05:45.360 --> 2:05:47.680
 I think they're not the culprits.

2:05:47.680 --> 2:05:50.080
 Yeah, I think the culprits of course, you know,

2:05:53.420 --> 2:05:58.420
 are reliance on foods that are not necessarily healthy.

2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:03.060
 Now, going back to the supermarket,

2:06:03.060 --> 2:06:06.880
 they don't fall in love with the first, they need to work.

2:06:06.880 --> 2:06:10.760
 You know, you take a tangerine

2:06:16.800 --> 2:06:20.800
 and you take an extract of tangerine

2:06:22.760 --> 2:06:27.200
 that you used to cook that spike, let's say with sugar

2:06:29.640 --> 2:06:32.440
 and you equalize in both where they both provide

2:06:32.440 --> 2:06:33.900
 the same amount of calories.

2:06:33.900 --> 2:06:36.820
 If you eat them both,

2:06:38.260 --> 2:06:40.420
 they're gonna have a very different effect

2:06:41.820 --> 2:06:45.540
 in your gut brain axis and your system.

2:06:45.540 --> 2:06:48.060
 Once you make the extract and you process it

2:06:48.060 --> 2:06:51.780
 and you add it, process sugar, you know, to use it now

2:06:51.780 --> 2:06:55.660
 to cook, to add, to make it really sweet tangerine thing.

2:06:55.660 --> 2:07:00.220
 Now you're providing now a fully ready to use

2:07:00.220 --> 2:07:05.220
 broken down source of sugar in the tangerine

2:07:07.020 --> 2:07:10.700
 that sugar it's mixed in the complexity

2:07:11.820 --> 2:07:15.420
 of a whole set of other chemical components,

2:07:16.380 --> 2:07:20.180
 fiber, long chains of sugar molecules

2:07:20.180 --> 2:07:24.900
 that need a huge amount of work by your stomach,

2:07:24.900 --> 2:07:29.020
 your gut system to break it down.

2:07:29.020 --> 2:07:34.020
 So you're using a huge amount of energy to extract energy.

2:07:36.500 --> 2:07:40.620
 And the balance, it's very different

2:07:40.620 --> 2:07:45.620
 than when I take this process, highly extracted tangerine.

2:07:46.660 --> 2:07:48.900
 By the way, I use tangerines because I had a tangerine

2:07:48.900 --> 2:07:50.100
 just before I came here.

2:07:50.100 --> 2:07:52.900
 Delicious, they are delicious.

2:07:52.900 --> 2:07:57.900
 And so this goes back to the issue of supermarkets.

2:07:57.900 --> 2:08:02.900
 And so to some degree, you know, A, given a choice,

2:08:03.500 --> 2:08:05.540
 you don't wanna eat processed, highly processed foods

2:08:05.540 --> 2:08:08.900
 because everything's already been broken down for you.

2:08:08.900 --> 2:08:11.060
 And so your system has no work.

2:08:12.740 --> 2:08:15.620
 And so you're co-opting, hijacking the circuits

2:08:15.620 --> 2:08:19.180
 in a way that they're being activated at a timescale

2:08:19.180 --> 2:08:20.740
 that normally wouldn't happen.

2:08:22.220 --> 2:08:25.340
 This is why I often feel that,

2:08:25.340 --> 2:08:27.100
 and I think a lot of data are now starting

2:08:27.100 --> 2:08:29.460
 to support the idea that while indeed

2:08:29.460 --> 2:08:31.380
 the laws of thermodynamics apply,

2:08:31.380 --> 2:08:33.580
 calories ingested versus calories burned

2:08:33.580 --> 2:08:35.740
 is a very real thing, right?

2:08:37.020 --> 2:08:42.020
 That the appetite for certain foods

2:08:43.260 --> 2:08:47.420
 and the wanting and the liking are phenomena

2:08:47.420 --> 2:08:49.860
 of the nervous system, brain and gut,

2:08:49.860 --> 2:08:51.780
 as you've beautifully described,

2:08:51.780 --> 2:08:54.700
 and that that changes over time

2:08:54.700 --> 2:08:57.460
 depending on how we are receiving these nutrients.

2:08:57.460 --> 2:08:58.380
 Absolutely.

2:08:58.380 --> 2:09:03.380
 Look, we have a lot of work to do.

2:09:05.660 --> 2:09:07.580
 I'm talking as a society.

2:09:07.580 --> 2:09:09.940
 I'm not talking about you and I.

2:09:09.940 --> 2:09:12.140
 We also have a lot of work to do.

2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:16.540
 Now, I think understanding the circuits

2:09:17.700 --> 2:09:20.660
 is giving us important insights

2:09:20.660 --> 2:09:22.460
 and how ultimately and hopefully

2:09:22.460 --> 2:09:25.260
 we can improve human health

2:09:26.220 --> 2:09:28.620
 and make a meaningful difference.

2:09:30.740 --> 2:09:35.740
 Now, it's very easy to try to connect the dots,

2:09:35.740 --> 2:09:38.660
 A to B, B to C, C to D.

2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:41.820
 And I think there's a lot more complexity to it,

2:09:43.060 --> 2:09:46.340
 but I do think that the lessons that are emerging

2:09:46.340 --> 2:09:50.700
 out of understanding how the circuits operate

2:09:50.700 --> 2:09:55.700
 can ultimately inform how we deal with our diets

2:09:58.740 --> 2:10:03.740
 in a way that we avoid what we're facing now as a society.

2:10:03.820 --> 2:10:07.100
 I mean, it's nuts that the overnutrition

2:10:08.740 --> 2:10:11.900
 happens to be such a prevalent problem.

2:10:11.900 --> 2:10:13.660
 And I also think the training of people

2:10:13.660 --> 2:10:15.980
 who are thinking about metabolic science

2:10:15.980 --> 2:10:18.540
 and metabolic disease is largely divorced

2:10:18.540 --> 2:10:20.100
 from the training of the neuroscientist

2:10:20.100 --> 2:10:21.340
 and vice versa.

2:10:21.340 --> 2:10:22.660
 No one field is to blame,

2:10:22.660 --> 2:10:26.740
 but I fully agree that the brain is the key

2:10:26.740 --> 2:10:29.540
 or the nervous system to be more accurate

2:10:29.540 --> 2:10:32.380
 is one of the key overlooked features.

2:10:32.380 --> 2:10:35.900
 Is the arbitrary, ultimately is the arbiter

2:10:35.900 --> 2:10:38.300
 of many of these pathways.

2:10:38.300 --> 2:10:40.780
 As a final question and one which is simply

2:10:40.780 --> 2:10:42.900
 to entertain my curiosity

2:10:42.900 --> 2:10:44.820
 and the curiosity of the listeners,

2:10:46.020 --> 2:10:49.220
 what is your absolute favorite food?

2:10:49.220 --> 2:10:50.260
 Oh my goodness.

2:10:52.580 --> 2:10:53.860
 Taste, I should say.

2:10:53.860 --> 2:10:55.100
 Yes.

2:10:55.100 --> 2:10:57.420
 Taste, to distinguish between taste

2:10:57.420 --> 2:10:59.660
 and the nutritive value or lack thereof.

2:10:59.660 --> 2:11:04.660
 Yes, look, we, unlike every animal species,

2:11:06.220 --> 2:11:08.220
 eat for the enjoyment of it.

2:11:10.460 --> 2:11:12.060
 It doesn't happen in the wild.

2:11:13.020 --> 2:11:15.180
 Most animals eat when they need to eat.

2:11:16.700 --> 2:11:19.020
 Doesn't mean they don't enjoy it,

2:11:19.020 --> 2:11:21.180
 but it's a completely different story.

2:11:25.140 --> 2:11:27.780
 I have too many favorite foods

2:11:27.780 --> 2:11:30.780
 because I enjoy the sensory experience.

2:11:31.700 --> 2:11:33.660
 Rather than the food itself,

2:11:33.660 --> 2:11:34.940
 to me is the whole thing.

2:11:34.940 --> 2:11:36.020
 It's from the present.

2:11:36.020 --> 2:11:37.780
 Look, there've been these experiments done

2:11:37.780 --> 2:11:39.260
 in psychophysics.

2:11:39.260 --> 2:11:42.380
 I'm gonna take a salad made out of 11 components

2:11:44.580 --> 2:11:47.860
 and I'm gonna mix them all up in potpourri

2:11:47.860 --> 2:11:50.500
 of greens and other things here.

2:11:50.500 --> 2:11:51.340
 And in the other one,

2:11:51.340 --> 2:11:53.420
 I'm gonna present it in a beautiful arrangement

2:11:53.420 --> 2:11:55.620
 and I'm gonna put it behind a glass cabinet

2:11:55.620 --> 2:11:57.020
 and I'm gonna sell them.

2:11:57.020 --> 2:11:59.460
 And I'm gonna sell one for $2 and one for $8.

2:12:01.460 --> 2:12:03.260
 Precisely the same ingredients,

2:12:03.260 --> 2:12:05.180
 exactly the same amount of each.

2:12:06.380 --> 2:12:07.460
 Ultimately, you're gonna mix them.

2:12:07.460 --> 2:12:08.940
 They're all gonna be the same.

2:12:10.580 --> 2:12:15.580
 And people will pay the $8 because you know what?

2:12:15.580 --> 2:12:18.140
 It evokes a different person.

2:12:19.260 --> 2:12:21.380
 It gives you the feel that,

2:12:21.380 --> 2:12:24.460
 oh my goodness, I'm gonna enjoy that salad.

2:12:25.860 --> 2:12:29.220
 So going back to what is my favorite food.

2:12:29.220 --> 2:12:32.220
 To me, eating is really a sensory journey.

2:12:38.060 --> 2:12:39.300
 I don't mean the everyday,

2:12:39.300 --> 2:12:43.460
 let me have some chicken wings because I'm hungry.

2:12:43.460 --> 2:12:48.460
 But every piece I think has an important evoking sensory role.

2:12:59.540 --> 2:13:03.940
 And so in terms of categories of food,

2:13:05.020 --> 2:13:09.660
 I grew up in Chile, so meat is always been,

2:13:09.660 --> 2:13:13.900
 but I eat it so seldom now.

2:13:13.900 --> 2:13:14.740
 Is that right?

2:13:14.740 --> 2:13:17.100
 Yeah, because I know that's not necessarily

2:13:17.100 --> 2:13:18.100
 the healthiest thing.

2:13:18.100 --> 2:13:19.700
 Red meat I'm talking about, yeah?

2:13:21.420 --> 2:13:23.940
 And so I grew up eating it every day.

2:13:24.900 --> 2:13:26.980
 I'm talking seven days a week.

2:13:26.980 --> 2:13:31.980
 Chile and Argentina, that's the mainstay of our diet, yeah?

2:13:33.180 --> 2:13:37.540
 Now maybe I have red meat, I know,

2:13:37.540 --> 2:13:40.740
 once every four weeks.

2:13:40.740 --> 2:13:41.620
 And you enjoy it.

2:13:41.620 --> 2:13:42.700
 Oh, I love it.

2:13:42.700 --> 2:13:46.140
 Part of it is because I haven't had it in four weeks.

2:13:46.140 --> 2:13:51.140
 But I love sushi, but I love the art of sushi.

2:13:54.100 --> 2:13:56.500
 The whole thing, the way it's presented,

2:13:56.500 --> 2:13:58.540
 it changes the way you taste it.

2:14:01.620 --> 2:14:06.180
 I love ethnic food in particular.

2:14:06.180 --> 2:14:07.300
 You're in the right place.

2:14:07.300 --> 2:14:08.140
 You got it.

2:14:08.140 --> 2:14:10.460
 That was the main reason I wanted to come to New York.

2:14:10.460 --> 2:14:11.980
 No, I'm just kidding.

2:14:11.980 --> 2:14:14.700
 There's also that Columbia University that's-

2:14:14.700 --> 2:14:18.100
 I came here because I wanted to be with people

2:14:18.100 --> 2:14:20.140
 that are thinking about the brain

2:14:20.140 --> 2:14:22.100
 the same way that I like to think,

2:14:22.100 --> 2:14:24.580
 can we solve this big problem?

2:14:24.580 --> 2:14:26.180
 This big question.

2:14:26.180 --> 2:14:28.820
 And certainly you're making amazing strides

2:14:28.820 --> 2:14:29.740
 in that direction.

2:14:29.740 --> 2:14:33.420
 And I love your answer because it really brings together

2:14:33.420 --> 2:14:35.220
 the many features of the circuitries

2:14:35.220 --> 2:14:36.940
 and the phenomenon we've been talking about today,

2:14:36.940 --> 2:14:40.300
 which is that while it begins with sensation and perception,

2:14:40.300 --> 2:14:41.860
 ultimately it's the context,

2:14:41.860 --> 2:14:44.020
 and that context is highly individual

2:14:44.020 --> 2:14:45.500
 to person, place, and time,

2:14:45.500 --> 2:14:47.380
 and many, many other things.

2:14:48.700 --> 2:14:51.580
 On behalf of myself and certainly

2:14:51.580 --> 2:14:52.740
 on behalf of all the listeners,

2:14:52.740 --> 2:14:54.540
 I want to thank you, first of all,

2:14:54.540 --> 2:14:56.180
 for the incredible work that you've been doing now

2:14:56.180 --> 2:14:58.740
 for decades in vision, in taste,

2:14:58.740 --> 2:15:01.220
 and in this bigger issue of how we perceive

2:15:01.220 --> 2:15:03.020
 and experience life.

2:15:03.020 --> 2:15:05.540
 It's a truly pioneering and incredible work.

2:15:05.540 --> 2:15:09.420
 And I feel quite lucky to have been on the sidelines

2:15:09.420 --> 2:15:11.220
 seeing this over the years and hearing the talks

2:15:11.220 --> 2:15:14.260
 and reading the countless beautiful papers,

2:15:14.260 --> 2:15:17.220
 but also for your time today to come down here

2:15:17.220 --> 2:15:19.300
 and talk to us about what drives you

2:15:19.300 --> 2:15:21.100
 and the discoveries you've made.

2:15:21.100 --> 2:15:22.740
 Thank you ever so much.

2:15:22.740 --> 2:15:24.420
 It was great fun.

2:15:24.420 --> 2:15:25.940
 Thank you for having me.

2:15:25.940 --> 2:15:26.780
 We'll do it again.

2:15:26.780 --> 2:15:27.820
 I wish all.

2:15:27.820 --> 2:15:29.860
 Thank you for joining me today

2:15:29.860 --> 2:15:31.780
 for my discussion about perception

2:15:31.780 --> 2:15:33.940
 and in particular, the perception of taste

2:15:33.940 --> 2:15:35.820
 with Dr. Charles Zucker.

 We do read all the comments.

2:16:04.120 --> 2:16:06.440
 On today's episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:16:06.440 --> 2:16:07.700
 we didn't talk about supplements,

2:16:07.700 --> 2:16:10.660
 but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:16:10.660 --> 2:16:12.740
 we talk about supplements that are useful for sleep,

2:16:12.740 --> 2:16:14.220
 for focus, for hormone support,

2:16:14.220 --> 2:16:15.820
 and other aspects of mental health,

2:16:15.820 --> 2:16:17.580
 physical health, and performance.

2:16:17.580 --> 2:16:19.140
 If you're interested in some of those supplements,

2:16:19.140 --> 2:16:21.820
 you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman

2:16:21.820 --> 2:16:23.460
 to see the catalog of supplements

2:16:23.460 --> 2:16:24.820
 that we've helped them formulate

2:16:24.820 --> 2:16:27.520
 and that map directly onto specific protocols

2:16:27.520 --> 2:16:29.180
 described on the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:16:29.180 --> 2:16:31.900
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

2:16:31.900 --> 2:16:34.420
 If you're not already following us on social media,

2:16:34.420 --> 2:16:36.360
 we are Huberman Lab on Twitter

2:16:36.360 --> 2:16:38.320
 and Huberman Lab on Instagram.

2:16:38.320 --> 2:16:40.900
 And at both Twitter and Instagram,

2:16:40.900 --> 2:16:43.140
 I cover science and science-related tools,

2:16:43.140 --> 2:16:44.680
 some of which overlap with the content

2:16:44.680 --> 2:16:45.960
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:47.940
 but much of which is distinct from the information

2:16:47.940 --> 2:16:49.800
 contained in the Huberman Lab Podcast.

2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:52.760
 We also have a newsletter in which we spell out protocols

2:16:52.760 --> 2:16:55.540
 and some summaries from previous podcast episodes.

2:16:55.540 --> 2:16:56.620
 If you'd like to check those out,

2:16:56.620 --> 2:16:59.300
 you can go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,

2:16:59.300 --> 2:17:01.500
 and you'll find the Neural Network Newsletter.

2:17:01.500 --> 2:17:02.700

 We do not share your email with anybody.

2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:11.000
 Again, that's HubermanLab.com.

2:17:11.000 --> 2:17:13.540
 Go to the menu and look for the Neural Network Newsletter.

2:17:13.540 --> 2:17:15.700
 And if you'd like examples of previous newsletters,

2:17:15.700 --> 2:17:18.060
 you'll also find those at HubermanLab.com.

2:17:18.060 --> 2:17:19.580
 Once again, thank you for joining me today

2:17:19.580 --> 2:17:21.700
 in my discussion with Dr. Charles Zucker

2:17:21.700 --> 2:17:23.180
 about the biology of perception

2:17:23.180 --> 2:17:25.900
 and the biology of the perception of taste in particular.

2:17:25.900 --> 2:17:27.380
 I hope you found that discussion
