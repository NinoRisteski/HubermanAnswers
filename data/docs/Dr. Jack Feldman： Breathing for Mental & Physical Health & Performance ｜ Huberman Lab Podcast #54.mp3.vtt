00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.240
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.240 --> 00:12.640
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:12.640 --> 00:14.620
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.220
 Today, my guest is Dr. Jack Feldman.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.680
 Dr. Jack Feldman is a distinguished professor

00:19.680 --> 00:23.280
 of neurobiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

00:23.280 --> 00:25.360
 He is known for his pioneering work

00:25.360 --> 00:27.800
 on the neuroscience of breathing.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.400
 We are all familiar with breathing

00:29.400 --> 00:31.920
 and how essential breathing is to life.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.240
 We require oxygen,

00:33.240 --> 00:35.640
 and it is only by breathing that we can bring oxygen

00:35.640 --> 00:38.400
 to all the cells of our brain and body.

00:38.400 --> 00:41.220
 However, as the work from Dr. Feldman and colleagues

00:41.220 --> 00:43.920
 tells us, breathing is also fundamental

00:43.920 --> 00:45.760
 to organ health and function

00:45.760 --> 00:48.160
 at an enormous number of other levels.

00:48.160 --> 00:51.680
 In fact, how we breathe, including how often we breathe,

00:51.680 --> 00:52.700
 the depth of our breathing,

00:52.700 --> 00:56.260
 and the ratio of inhales to exhales

00:56.260 --> 00:58.560
 actually predicts how focused we are,

00:58.560 --> 01:00.640
 how easily we get into sleep,

01:00.640 --> 01:02.920
 how easily we can exit from sleep.

01:02.920 --> 01:05.160
 Dr. Feldman gets credit for the discovery

01:05.160 --> 01:06.780
 of the two major brain centers

01:06.780 --> 01:09.320
 that control the different patterns of breathing.

01:09.320 --> 01:11.080
 Today, you'll learn about those brain centers

01:11.080 --> 01:12.840
 and the patterns of breathing they control

01:12.840 --> 01:14.760
 and how those different patterns of breathing

01:14.760 --> 01:18.720
 influence all aspects of your mental and physical life.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.900
 What's especially wonderful about Dr. Feldman and his work

01:21.900 --> 01:24.320
 is that it not only points to the critical role

01:24.320 --> 01:28.660
 of respiration in disease, in health, and in daily life,

01:28.660 --> 01:29.960
 but he's also a practitioner.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.640
 He understands how to leverage particular aspects

01:32.640 --> 01:36.120
 of the breathing process in order to bias the brain

01:36.120 --> 01:39.320
 to be in particular states that can benefit us all.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.480
 Whether or not you are a person

01:40.480 --> 01:42.120
 who already practices breath work

01:42.120 --> 01:43.160
 or whether or not you're somebody

01:43.160 --> 01:45.160
 who simply breathes to stay alive,

01:45.160 --> 01:47.040
 by the end of today's discussion,

01:47.040 --> 01:49.400
 you're going to understand a tremendous amount

01:49.400 --> 01:51.360
 about how the breathing system works

01:51.360 --> 01:53.600
 and how you can leverage that breathing system

01:53.600 --> 01:55.640
 toward particular goals in your life.

01:55.640 --> 01:57.000
 Dr. Feldman shares with us

01:57.000 --> 02:00.180
 his own particular breathing protocols that he uses,

02:00.180 --> 02:03.800
 and he suggests different avenues for exploring respiration

02:03.800 --> 02:05.720
 in ways that can allow you, for instance,

02:05.720 --> 02:07.360
 to be more focused for work,

02:07.360 --> 02:10.040
 to disengage from work in high stress endeavors,

02:10.040 --> 02:11.400
 to calm down quickly.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.780
 And indeed, he explains not only how to do that,

02:13.780 --> 02:16.360
 but all the underlying science in ways that will allow you

02:16.360 --> 02:19.600
 to customize your own protocols for your needs.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.040
 All the guests that we bring on the Huberman Lab Podcast

02:22.040 --> 02:24.800
 are considered at the very top of their fields.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.760
 Today's guest, Dr. Feldman,

02:26.760 --> 02:30.360
 is not only at the top of his field, he founded the field.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.080
 Prior to his coming into neuroscience

02:32.080 --> 02:33.400
 from the field of physics,

02:33.400 --> 02:34.880
 there really wasn't much information

02:34.880 --> 02:36.480
 about how the brain controls breathing.

02:36.480 --> 02:38.120
 There was a little bit of information,

02:38.120 --> 02:40.800
 but we can really credit Dr. Feldman and his laboratory

02:40.800 --> 02:43.080
 for identifying the particular brain areas

02:43.080 --> 02:44.920
 that control different patterns of breathing

02:44.920 --> 02:47.400
 and how that information can be leveraged

02:47.400 --> 02:51.060
 towards health, high performance, and for combating disease.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.360
 So today's conversation,

02:52.360 --> 02:54.400
 you're going to learn a tremendous amount

02:54.400 --> 02:56.600
 from the top researcher in this field.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.400
 It's a really wonderful and special opportunity

02:58.400 --> 03:00.600
 to be able to share his knowledge with you.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.800
 And I know that you're not only going to enjoy it,

03:02.800 --> 03:05.200
 but you are going to learn a tremendous amount.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.800
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

03:06.800 --> 03:08.160
 that this podcast is separate

03:08.160 --> 03:10.320
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.200
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

03:12.200 --> 03:14.680
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

03:14.680 --> 03:17.200
 and science-related tools to the general public.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.160
 In keeping with that theme,

03:18.160 --> 03:21.000
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.280
 Our first sponsor is Thesis.

03:23.280 --> 03:25.880
 Thesis is a company that makes nootropics.

03:25.880 --> 03:28.240
 Now I've talked before on the podcast and elsewhere

03:28.240 --> 03:30.520
 about the fact that I don't really like the term nootropics,

03:30.520 --> 03:32.240
 which means smart drugs,

03:32.240 --> 03:34.380
 because smart means many different things

03:34.380 --> 03:35.700
 in many different contexts.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.520
 You've got creativity, you've got focus,

03:37.520 --> 03:39.100
 you've got task switching.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.740
 So the idea that there will be one pill or one formula

03:41.740 --> 03:43.080
 that could make us smarter

03:43.080 --> 03:44.740
 and better at all those things at once

03:44.740 --> 03:46.600
 just doesn't stand up to logic.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.360
 In fact, different chemicals and different brain systems

03:49.360 --> 03:51.700
 underlie our ability to be creative

03:51.700 --> 03:54.600
 or our ability to task switch or to be focused.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.480
 And that's the basis of Thesis.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.880
 Thesis is a company that makes targeted nootropics

03:58.880 --> 03:59.920
 for specific outcomes.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.840
 In other words, specific nootropics to get your brain

04:02.840 --> 04:04.520
 into states that are ideal

04:04.520 --> 04:06.760
 for what you're trying to accomplish.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.840
 Thesis uses very high quality ingredients,

04:08.840 --> 04:10.940
 many of which I've talked about before on the podcast,

04:10.940 --> 04:14.400
 such as DHA, ginkgo biloba, and phosphatidyl steering.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.000
 I talked about those in the ADHD podcast.

04:17.000 --> 04:17.960
 Those are some of the ingredients

04:17.960 --> 04:19.800
 in their so-called logic formula.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.640
 There's a lot of research showing that ginkgo biloba

04:21.640 --> 04:24.400
 can be very helpful for increasing levels of focus

04:24.400 --> 04:26.520
 and even for people with ADHD.

04:26.520 --> 04:27.920
 However, I can't take it.

04:27.920 --> 04:29.840
 When I take it, I get really bad headaches.

04:29.840 --> 04:31.240
 And I know some people who do

04:31.240 --> 04:33.040
 and some people who don't get headaches

04:33.040 --> 04:34.320
 when they take ginkgo biloba.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.080
 This is a great example of why nootropics

04:36.080 --> 04:38.440
 need to be personalized to the individual.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.640
 Thesis gives you the ability to try different blends

04:40.640 --> 04:41.680
 over the course of a month

04:41.680 --> 04:44.080
 and discover which nootropic formulas work best

04:44.080 --> 04:46.680
 for your unique brain chemistry and genetics

04:46.680 --> 04:49.700
 and which ones are best for particular circumstances.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.660
 So they have a formulation, for instance,

04:51.660 --> 04:53.200
 which is motivation.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.320
 They have another formulation, which is clarity.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.120
 They've got another formulation, which is logic.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.800
 And each of these is formulated specifically to you

05:00.800 --> 05:03.120
 and formulated to a specific endpoint

05:03.120 --> 05:06.320
 or goal state of mind for your particular work.

05:06.320 --> 05:08.880
 So as a consequence, the formulations that you arrive at

05:08.880 --> 05:10.800
 will have a very high probability

05:10.800 --> 05:12.980
 of giving you the results that you want.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.000
 In addition to that detailed level of personalization,

05:16.000 --> 05:17.360
 thesis takes it a step further

05:17.360 --> 05:20.060
 by offering free consultations with a brain coach

05:20.060 --> 05:21.760
 to help you optimize your experience

05:21.760 --> 05:25.160
 and dial in your favorite and best formulas.

05:25.160 --> 05:27.280
 I've been using thesis for close to six months now,

05:27.280 --> 05:29.120
 and I can confidently say that their nootropics

05:29.120 --> 05:31.060
 have been a total game changer for me.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.800
 My favorite of the formulations

05:32.800 --> 05:36.160
 is their motivation formula that they've tailored to me.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.760
 When I use that formula, I have very clear state of mind.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.440
 I have even energy and I use that early in the day

05:41.440 --> 05:42.700
 until the early afternoon

05:42.700 --> 05:45.440
 to get the bulk of my most important work done.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.840
 To get your own personalized nootropic starter kit,

05:47.840 --> 05:52.000
 you can go online to takethesis.com slash Huberman,

05:52.000 --> 05:53.080
 take a three minute quiz

05:53.080 --> 05:55.080
 and thesis will send you four different formulas

05:55.080 --> 05:56.640
 to try in your first month.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.440
 That's takethesis.com slash Huberman

05:59.440 --> 06:01.220
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

06:01.220 --> 06:03.600
 to get 10% off your first order.

06:03.600 --> 06:06.440
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

06:06.440 --> 06:07.880
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

06:07.880 --> 06:10.120
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.540
 I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012

06:12.540 --> 06:15.080
 and so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

06:15.080 --> 06:16.760
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

06:16.760 --> 06:18.620
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

06:18.620 --> 06:20.680
 is that it covers all of my vitamin mineral

06:20.680 --> 06:22.920
 and probiotic foundational needs.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.040
 There's now a wealth of data showing that

06:25.040 --> 06:26.760
 not only do we need vitamins and minerals,

06:26.760 --> 06:29.460
 but we also need to have a healthy gut microbiome.

06:29.460 --> 06:32.160
 The gut microbiome is a set of nerve connections

06:32.160 --> 06:34.120
 that link the microbiota, literally,

06:34.120 --> 06:35.760
 micro bacteria that live in our guts

06:35.760 --> 06:38.400
 and that are healthy for us with our brain function.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.040
 And our brain is also talking to our gut

06:41.040 --> 06:42.200
 in a bidirectional way.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.660
 And that conversation is vital for metabolism,

06:45.660 --> 06:48.160
 for the endocrine system, meaning the hormonal system,

06:48.160 --> 06:50.660
 and for overall mood and cognition.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.560
 There's just so much data now pointing to the fact

06:52.560 --> 06:54.660
 that we need a healthy gut microbiome

06:54.660 --> 06:58.400
 and a healthy brain gut axis, as it's called.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.500
 By taking Athletic Greens once or twice a day,

07:00.500 --> 07:01.840
 I can get the vitamins, the minerals,

07:01.840 --> 07:03.960
 and the probiotics needed for all those systems

07:03.960 --> 07:05.200
 to function optimally.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.600
 And again, it tastes great, it's great for me.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.880
 In fact, if people ask me,

07:08.880 --> 07:10.680
 what's the one supplement that I should take

07:10.680 --> 07:12.160
 and they can only take one supplement,

07:12.160 --> 07:13.580
 I recommend Athletic Greens

07:13.580 --> 07:15.200
 for all the reasons I mentioned.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.500
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

07:16.500 --> 07:19.120
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

07:19.120 --> 07:20.200
 to claim a special offer.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.240
 They're giving you five free travel packs,

07:22.240 --> 07:23.280
 which are these little travel packs

07:23.280 --> 07:24.880
 that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens

07:24.880 --> 07:26.500
 while you're on the road or in the car

07:26.500 --> 07:27.520
 or on the plane, et cetera,

07:27.520 --> 07:30.480
 and a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

07:30.480 --> 07:31.960
 There is also a wealth of evidence showing

07:31.960 --> 07:34.760
 that vitamin D3 is vital to our overall health

07:34.760 --> 07:37.280
 and K2 is important for cardiovascular health

07:37.280 --> 07:38.740
 and other systems as well.

07:38.740 --> 07:41.360
 Most of us are not getting enough vitamin D3 or K2,

07:41.360 --> 07:43.360
 even if we're getting some sunshine.

07:43.360 --> 07:45.800
 So again, if you go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

07:45.800 --> 07:47.160
 you get the five free travel packs,

07:47.160 --> 07:50.000
 a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.580
 Athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

07:51.580 --> 07:53.880
 is where you go to claim that special offer.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.680
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.240
 Headspace is a meditation app

07:58.240 --> 08:00.560
 that's supported by 25 published studies

08:00.560 --> 08:04.280
 and benefits from over 600,000 five-star reviews.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.800
 I've long been a believer in meditating.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.880
 There's so much data now pointing to the fact

08:08.880 --> 08:12.120
 that regular meditation leads to reduced stress levels,

08:12.120 --> 08:13.700
 heightened levels of focus,

08:13.700 --> 08:16.580
 better task switching and cognitive ability.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.660
 It just goes on and on.

08:17.660 --> 08:18.840
 I mean, there are literally thousands

08:18.840 --> 08:21.400
 of peer-reviewed studies now in quality journals

08:21.400 --> 08:22.740
 pointing to the benefits

08:22.740 --> 08:25.160
 of having a regular meditation practice.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.020
 The problem with meditation is many people,

08:27.020 --> 08:28.680
 including myself, have struggled

08:28.680 --> 08:30.580
 with sticking to that practice.

08:30.580 --> 08:32.360
 With Headspace, it makes it very easy

08:32.360 --> 08:35.400
 to start and continue a meditation protocol.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.160
 The reason for that is they have meditations

08:37.160 --> 08:38.920
 that are of different lengths and different styles,

08:38.920 --> 08:40.760
 so you don't get bored of meditation.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.480
 And even if you just have five minutes,

08:42.480 --> 08:43.860
 there are five-minute meditations.

08:43.860 --> 08:46.040
 If you've got 20 minutes, which would be even better,

08:46.040 --> 08:47.960
 there are 20-minute meditations.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.560
 Ever since I started using Headspace,

08:49.560 --> 08:51.340
 I've been consistent about my meditation.

08:51.340 --> 08:55.260
 I do meditation anywhere from five to seven times a week

08:55.260 --> 08:57.640
 in my best weeks, and sometimes that's drops to three.

08:57.640 --> 08:58.880
 And then I find with Headspace,

08:58.880 --> 09:01.000
 I can quickly get back to doing meditation every day

09:01.000 --> 09:02.640
 because of the huge variety

09:02.640 --> 09:04.520
 of great meditations that they have.

09:04.520 --> 09:05.660
 If you want to try Headspace,

09:05.660 --> 09:08.240
 you can go to headspace.com slash special offer.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.680
 And if you do that, you can get a free one-month trial

09:10.680 --> 09:12.120
 with Headspace's full library

09:12.120 --> 09:14.080
 of meditations for every situation.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.960
 That's the best deal offered by Headspace right now.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.480
 So again, if you're interested,

09:17.480 --> 09:20.280
 go to headspace.com slash special offer.

09:20.280 --> 09:21.520
 One quick mention before we dive

09:21.520 --> 09:23.680
 into the conversation with Dr. Feldman.

09:23.680 --> 09:24.840
 During today's episode,

09:24.840 --> 09:26.840
 we discuss a lot of breath work practices.

09:26.840 --> 09:28.040
 And by the end of the episode,

09:28.040 --> 09:30.000
 all of those will be accessible to you.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.520
 However, I'm aware that there are a number

09:31.520 --> 09:33.800
 of people out there that want to go even further

09:33.800 --> 09:36.400
 into the science and practical tools of breath work.

09:36.400 --> 09:39.200
 And for that reason, I want to mention a resource to you.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.040
 There is a cost associated with this resource,

09:41.040 --> 09:42.300
 but it's a terrific platform

09:42.300 --> 09:43.960
 for learning about breath work practices

09:43.960 --> 09:46.240
 and for building a number of different routines

09:46.240 --> 09:48.160
 that you can do or that you could teach.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.760
 It's called Our Breath Work Collective.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.000
 I'm not associated with the Breath Work Collective,

09:53.000 --> 09:55.360
 but Dr. Feldman is an advisor to the group

09:55.360 --> 09:58.140
 and they offer daily live guided breathing sessions

09:58.140 --> 10:01.120
 and an on-demand library that you can practice anytime,

10:01.120 --> 10:02.720
 free workshops on breath work.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.880
 And these are really developed by experts in the field,

10:04.880 --> 10:06.540
 including Dr. Feldman.

10:06.540 --> 10:08.720
 So as I mentioned, I'm not on their advisory board,

10:08.720 --> 10:10.220
 but I do know them in their work

10:10.220 --> 10:11.960
 and it is of the utmost quality.

10:11.960 --> 10:14.040
 So anyone wanting to learn or teach breath work

10:14.040 --> 10:16.120
 could really benefit from this course, I believe.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.000
 If you'd like to learn more,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.800
 you can click on the link in the show notes

10:18.800 --> 10:21.800
 or visit ourbreathcollective.com slash Huberman

10:21.800 --> 10:23.760
 and use the code Huberman at checkout.

10:23.760 --> 10:24.780
 And if you do that,

10:24.780 --> 10:26.840
 they'll offer you $10 off the first month.

10:26.840 --> 10:29.680
 Again, it's ourbreathcollective.com slash Huberman

10:29.680 --> 10:31.920
 to access the Our Breath Collective.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.840
 And now for my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman.

10:35.840 --> 10:37.080
 Thanks for joining me today.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.840
 It's a pleasure to be here, Andrew.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.380
 Yeah, it's been a long time coming.

10:40.380 --> 10:43.840
 You're my go-to source for all things respiration.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.040
 I mean, I breathe on my own,

10:45.040 --> 10:47.580
 but when I want to understand how I breathe

10:47.580 --> 10:51.160
 and how the brain and breathing interact,

10:51.160 --> 10:52.640
 you're the person I call.

10:52.640 --> 10:53.580
 Well, I'll do my best.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.720
 As you know, there's a lot that we don't understand,

10:55.720 --> 10:58.080
 which still keeps me employed and engaged,

10:58.080 --> 10:59.600
 but we do know a lot.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.220
 Why don't we start off by just talking about

11:02.220 --> 11:05.420
 what's involved in generating breath?

11:05.420 --> 11:07.420
 And if you would,

11:07.420 --> 11:10.100
 could you comment on some of the mechanisms

11:10.100 --> 11:14.520
 for rhythmic breathing versus non-rhythmic breathing?

11:16.060 --> 11:18.020
 Okay, so on the mechanical side,

11:18.020 --> 11:19.620
 which is obvious to everyone,

11:19.620 --> 11:23.980
 we want to have air flow in, inhale,

11:23.980 --> 11:25.780
 and we need to have air flow out.

11:25.780 --> 11:28.060
 And the reason we'd need to do this

11:28.060 --> 11:32.460
 is because for body metabolism, we need oxygen.

11:32.460 --> 11:35.220
 And when oxygen is utilized

11:35.220 --> 11:38.780
 through the aerobic metabolic process,

11:38.780 --> 11:40.220
 we produce carbon dioxide.

11:40.220 --> 11:42.420
 And so we have to get rid of the carbon dioxide

11:42.420 --> 11:44.500
 that we produce, in particular,

11:44.500 --> 11:47.820
 because the carbon dioxide affects the acid-base balance

11:47.820 --> 11:49.540
 of the blood, the pH.

11:49.540 --> 11:53.380
 And all living cells are very sensitive

11:53.380 --> 11:54.700
 to what the pH value is.

11:54.700 --> 11:57.420
 So your body is very interested in regulating that.

11:57.420 --> 11:59.180
 Regulating that pH.

11:59.180 --> 12:03.580
 So we have to have enough oxygen for our normal metabolism,

12:03.580 --> 12:06.460
 and we have to get rid of the CO2 that we produce.

12:06.460 --> 12:09.220
 So how do we generate this air flow?

12:09.220 --> 12:11.300
 Well, the air comes into the lungs.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.940
 We have to expand the lungs.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.900
 And as the lungs expand,

12:14.900 --> 12:18.000
 basically it's like a balloon that you would pull apart,

12:18.000 --> 12:20.740
 the pressure inside that balloon drops,

12:20.740 --> 12:22.260
 and air will flow into the balloon.

12:22.260 --> 12:27.260
 So we put pressure on the lung to pull it apart

12:27.740 --> 12:31.860
 that lowers the pressure in the air sacs called alveoli,

12:31.860 --> 12:35.220
 and air will flow in because pressure outside the body

12:35.220 --> 12:37.180
 is higher than pressure inside the body

12:37.180 --> 12:40.460
 when you're doing this expansion, when you're inhaling.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.740
 What produces that?

12:42.740 --> 12:45.860
 Well, the principal muscle is the diaphragm,

12:45.860 --> 12:49.340
 which is sitting inside the body just below the lung.

12:49.340 --> 12:51.580
 And when you want to inhale,

12:51.580 --> 12:55.100
 you basically contract the diaphragm, and it pulls it down.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.700
 And as it pulls it down,

12:56.700 --> 12:59.620
 it's inserting pressure forces on the lung.

12:59.620 --> 13:01.340
 The lung wants to expand.

13:01.340 --> 13:06.160
 At the same time, the rib cage is gonna rotate up and out,

13:06.160 --> 13:10.000
 and therefore expanding the cavity, the thoracic cavity.

13:11.140 --> 13:13.620
 At the end of inspiration,

13:13.620 --> 13:16.100
 under normal conditions when you're at rest,

13:16.100 --> 13:19.220
 you just relax, and it's like pulling on a spring.

13:19.220 --> 13:20.220
 You pull down a spring,

13:20.220 --> 13:21.700
 and you let go, and it relaxes.

13:21.700 --> 13:25.860
 So you inhale, and you exhale.

13:25.860 --> 13:27.820
 Inhale, relax, and exhale.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.620
 So the exhale is passive?

13:29.620 --> 13:31.220
 At rest, it's passive.

13:31.220 --> 13:35.580
 We'll get into what happens when you need to increase

13:35.580 --> 13:37.720
 the amount of air you're bringing in

13:37.720 --> 13:39.780
 because your ventilation,

13:39.780 --> 13:42.420
 your metabolism goes up like during exercise.

13:43.660 --> 13:45.340
 Now, the muscles themselves,

13:45.340 --> 13:48.700
 skeletal muscles, don't do anything

13:48.700 --> 13:52.500
 unless the nervous system tells them to do something.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.540
 And when the nervous system tells them to do something,

13:55.540 --> 13:56.940
 they contract.

13:56.940 --> 14:00.700
 So there are specialized neurons in the spinal cord,

14:00.700 --> 14:02.180
 and then above the spinal cord,

14:02.180 --> 14:04.000
 the region called the brain stem,

14:04.000 --> 14:07.160
 which go to respiratory muscles,

14:07.160 --> 14:09.660
 in particular for inspiration, the diaphragm,

14:09.660 --> 14:13.980
 and the external intercostal muscles in the rib cage,

14:13.980 --> 14:15.460
 and they contract.

14:15.460 --> 14:19.300
 So these respiratory muscles, these inspiratory muscles

14:21.420 --> 14:25.700
 become active, and they become active for a period of time.

14:25.700 --> 14:29.380
 Then they become silent, and when they become silent,

14:29.380 --> 14:33.040
 the muscles then relax back to their original resting level.

14:34.740 --> 14:37.560
 Where does that activity in these neurons

14:37.560 --> 14:39.860
 that innervate the muscle, which are called motor neurons,

14:39.860 --> 14:41.840
 where does that originate?

14:41.840 --> 14:45.380
 Well, this was a question that's been bandied

14:45.380 --> 14:47.820
 around for thousands of years,

14:47.820 --> 14:52.740
 and when I was a beginning assistant professor,

14:52.740 --> 14:55.540
 it was fairly high priority for me

14:55.540 --> 14:56.740
 to try and figure that out,

14:56.740 --> 15:00.540
 because I wanted to understand where this rhythm

15:00.540 --> 15:01.900
 of breathing was coming from,

15:01.900 --> 15:04.300
 and you couldn't know where it was coming from

15:04.300 --> 15:07.100
 until you knew where it was coming from.

15:07.100 --> 15:08.660
 I didn't phrase that properly.

15:08.660 --> 15:10.900
 You couldn't understand how it was being done

15:10.900 --> 15:12.780
 until you know where to look.

15:12.780 --> 15:14.500
 So we did a lot of experiments,

15:14.500 --> 15:16.020
 which I can go into detail,

15:16.020 --> 15:20.020
 and finally found there was a region in the brain stem,

15:20.020 --> 15:24.020
 that's once again this region sort of above the spinal cord,

15:24.020 --> 15:27.300
 which was critical for generating this rhythm.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.340
 It's called the pre-Butzinger complex,

15:29.340 --> 15:31.340
 and we can talk about how that was named.

15:32.340 --> 15:35.940
 This small site, which contains in humans

15:35.940 --> 15:40.260
 a few thousand neurons, it's located on either side,

15:40.260 --> 15:45.260
 and it works in tandem, and every breath begins

15:45.660 --> 15:50.580
 with neurons in this region beginning to be active,

15:50.580 --> 15:53.580
 and those neurons then connect ultimately

15:53.580 --> 15:56.580
 to these motor neurons going to the diaphragm

15:56.580 --> 15:58.820
 and to the external intercostals,

15:58.820 --> 16:00.580
 causing them to be active and causing

16:00.580 --> 16:02.620
 this inspiratory effort.

16:03.900 --> 16:07.020
 When the neurons in the pre-Butzinger complex

16:07.020 --> 16:09.700
 finish their burst of activity,

16:09.700 --> 16:14.700
 then inspiration stops, and then you begin to exhale

16:14.980 --> 16:19.980
 because of this passive recall of the lung and rib cage.

16:20.340 --> 16:22.420
 Could I just briefly interrupt you

16:22.420 --> 16:26.180
 to ask a few quick questions before we move forward

16:26.180 --> 16:29.740
 in this very informative answer.

16:29.740 --> 16:34.740
 The two questions are, is there anything known

16:34.740 --> 16:38.340
 about the activation of the diaphragm

16:38.340 --> 16:40.820
 and the intercostal muscles between the ribs

16:40.820 --> 16:44.220
 as it relates to nose versus mouth breathing,

16:44.220 --> 16:48.700
 or are they activated in the equivalent way

16:48.700 --> 16:50.420
 regardless of whether or not someone is breathing

16:50.420 --> 16:51.780
 through their nose or mouth?

16:53.460 --> 16:55.860
 I don't think we fully have the answer to that.

16:55.860 --> 16:57.140
 Clearly, there are differences

16:57.140 --> 16:59.700
 between nasal and mouth breathing.

17:00.660 --> 17:04.780
 At rest, the tendency is to do nasal breathing

17:04.780 --> 17:08.460
 because the air flows that are necessary

17:08.460 --> 17:12.140
 for normal breathing are easily managed

17:12.140 --> 17:14.660
 by passing through the nasal cavities.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.420
 However, when your ventilation needs to increase,

17:17.420 --> 17:20.340
 like during exercise, you need to move more air,

17:20.340 --> 17:22.020
 you do that through your mouth

17:22.020 --> 17:24.740
 because the airways are much larger then,

17:24.740 --> 17:26.900
 and therefore you can move much more air.

17:26.900 --> 17:30.620
 But at the level of the intercostals and the diaphragm,

17:30.620 --> 17:35.620
 their contraction is almost agnostic

17:36.740 --> 17:39.380
 to whether or not the nose and mouth are open.

17:39.380 --> 17:42.140
 Okay, so if I understand correctly,

17:42.140 --> 17:45.420
 there's no reason to suspect that there are particular,

17:45.420 --> 17:47.660
 perhaps even non-overlapping sets of neurons

17:47.660 --> 17:50.580
 in pre-Butzinger area of the brainstem

17:50.580 --> 17:53.980
 that trigger nasal versus mouth inhales?

17:55.340 --> 17:59.500
 No, I would say that it's not

17:59.500 --> 18:01.940
 that the pre-Butzinger complex is not concerned

18:01.940 --> 18:03.780
 and cannot influence that,

18:03.780 --> 18:07.380
 but it does not appear as if there's any modulation

18:09.420 --> 18:11.780
 of whether or not it's where the air is coming from,

18:11.780 --> 18:13.860
 whether it's coming through your nasal passages

18:13.860 --> 18:15.500
 or through your mouth.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.920
 Thank you, and then the other question I have

18:16.920 --> 18:19.380
 is that these intercostal muscles between the ribs

18:19.380 --> 18:21.860
 that move the ribs up and out, if I understand correctly,

18:21.860 --> 18:25.540
 and the diaphragm, are those skeletal,

18:25.540 --> 18:28.740
 or as the Brits would say, skeletal muscles,

18:28.740 --> 18:30.220
 or smooth muscles?

18:30.220 --> 18:33.320
 What type of muscle are we talking about here?

18:33.320 --> 18:35.740
 As I said earlier, these are skeletal,

18:35.740 --> 18:37.160
 I didn't say they were skeletal muscles,

18:37.160 --> 18:40.100
 but they're muscles that need neural input

18:40.100 --> 18:41.340
 in order to move.

18:41.340 --> 18:43.700
 You talked about smooth muscles.

18:43.700 --> 18:46.380
 They're specialized muscles like we have in the gut

18:46.380 --> 18:49.740
 and in the heart, and these are muscles that are capable

18:49.740 --> 18:54.420
 of actually contracting and relaxing on their own.

18:54.420 --> 18:55.980
 So the heart beats.

18:55.980 --> 18:58.700
 It doesn't need neural input in order to beat.

18:58.700 --> 19:02.140
 The neural inputs modulate the strength of it

19:02.140 --> 19:05.060
 and the frequency, but they beat on their own.

19:05.060 --> 19:09.060
 The skeletal muscles involved in breathing

19:10.060 --> 19:11.460
 need neural input.

19:11.460 --> 19:13.900
 Now, there are smooth muscles that have an influence

19:13.900 --> 19:15.860
 on breathing, and these are muscles

19:15.860 --> 19:18.540
 that are lining the airways,

19:18.540 --> 19:22.260
 and so the airways have smooth muscle,

19:22.260 --> 19:24.660
 and when they become activated,

19:24.660 --> 19:28.380
 the smooth muscle can contract or relax,

19:28.380 --> 19:30.980
 and when they contract inappropriately

19:30.980 --> 19:34.780
 is when you have problems breathing like in asthma.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.380
 Asthma is a condition where you get

19:36.380 --> 19:39.540
 inappropriate constriction of the smooth muscles

19:39.540 --> 19:40.860
 of the airways.

19:40.860 --> 19:42.660
 So there's no reason to think that in asthma

19:42.660 --> 19:45.500
 that the pre-butsinger or these other neuronal centers

19:45.500 --> 19:47.820
 in the brain that activate breathing,

19:47.820 --> 19:52.500
 that they are involved or causal for things like asthma?

19:52.500 --> 19:55.540
 As of now, I would say the preponderance of evidence

19:55.540 --> 19:58.540
 is that it's not involved, but we've not really fully

19:58.540 --> 19:59.700
 investigated that.

19:59.700 --> 20:00.540
 Thank you.

20:00.540 --> 20:04.180
 Sorry to break your flow, but I was terribly interested

20:04.180 --> 20:06.300
 in knowing answers to those questions,

20:06.300 --> 20:08.100
 and you provided them, so thank you.

20:08.980 --> 20:11.780
 Now, remind me again where I was in my...

20:11.780 --> 20:14.260
 We were just landing in pre-butsinger,

20:14.260 --> 20:17.500
 and we will return to the naming of pre-butsinger

20:17.500 --> 20:20.380
 because it's a wonderful and important story, really,

20:20.380 --> 20:22.540
 that I think people should be aware of,

20:22.540 --> 20:27.140
 but maybe you could march us through the brain centers

20:27.140 --> 20:31.700
 that you've discovered and others have worked on as well

20:31.700 --> 20:33.500
 that control breathing, pre-butsinger

20:33.500 --> 20:35.660
 as well as related structures.

20:35.660 --> 20:39.460
 So when we discovered the pre-butsinger,

20:39.460 --> 20:42.780
 we thought that it was the primary source

20:42.780 --> 20:45.740
 of all rhythmic respiratory movements,

20:45.740 --> 20:48.100
 both inspiration and expiration.

20:48.100 --> 20:53.100
 The notion of a single source is like day or night.

20:53.860 --> 20:55.500
 It's like they're all coming,

20:55.500 --> 20:58.220
 they all have the same origin that the earth rotates

20:58.220 --> 20:59.580
 and day follows night.

20:59.580 --> 21:01.860
 And we thought that the pre-butsinger complex

21:01.860 --> 21:04.860
 would be inhalation, exhalation.

21:06.060 --> 21:10.020
 And then in a series of experiments we did

21:10.020 --> 21:14.300
 in the early part of 2000, we discovered

21:14.300 --> 21:17.180
 that there seemed to be another region

21:17.180 --> 21:21.420
 which was dominant in producing expiratory movements,

21:21.420 --> 21:22.980
 that is the exhalation.

21:24.220 --> 21:28.580
 We had made a fundamental mistake

21:30.100 --> 21:32.620
 with the discovery of the pre-butsinger

21:32.620 --> 21:35.180
 not taking into account that at rest

21:36.140 --> 21:39.460
 expiratory muscle activity or exhalation is passive.

21:40.820 --> 21:44.580
 So if that's the case, a group of neurons

21:44.580 --> 21:47.700
 that might generate active expiration,

21:47.700 --> 21:50.020
 that is to contract the expiratory muscles

21:50.020 --> 21:53.260
 like the abdominal muscles of the internal intercostals

21:53.260 --> 21:54.820
 are just silent.

21:54.820 --> 21:58.500
 We just thought it wasn't there was coming from one place.

21:58.500 --> 22:00.820
 But we got evidence that in fact

22:00.820 --> 22:03.180
 it may have been coming from another place.

22:03.180 --> 22:04.860
 And following up on these experiments,

22:04.860 --> 22:08.380
 we discovered that there was a second oscillator

22:08.380 --> 22:11.740
 and that oscillator is involved

22:11.740 --> 22:14.860
 in generating what we call active expiration.

22:14.860 --> 22:16.580
 That is this active.

22:16.580 --> 22:17.780
 Like if I go shh.

22:17.780 --> 22:21.140
 Yeah, or when you begin to exercise,

22:21.140 --> 22:25.220
 you have to go, and actually move that air out.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.860
 This group of cells, which is silent at rest,

22:28.860 --> 22:32.140
 suddenly becomes active to drive those muscles.

22:32.140 --> 22:35.780
 And it appears that it's an independent oscillator.

22:35.780 --> 22:37.540
 When maybe you could just clarify for people

22:37.540 --> 22:39.100
 what an oscillator is.

22:39.100 --> 22:43.540
 Okay, an oscillator is something that goes in a cycle.

22:43.540 --> 22:45.780
 So you can have a pendulum as an oscillator

22:45.780 --> 22:47.180
 going back and forth.

22:47.180 --> 22:49.660
 The earth is an oscillator because it goes around

22:49.660 --> 22:50.740
 and it's day and night.

22:50.740 --> 22:52.620
 Some people's moods are oscillating.

22:52.620 --> 22:53.460
 Oscillating.

22:53.460 --> 22:56.220
 And it depends how regular they are.

22:56.220 --> 22:58.220
 You can have oscillators that are highly regular

22:58.220 --> 23:00.180
 that are in a watch,

23:00.180 --> 23:04.220
 or you can have those that are sporadic or episodic.

23:04.220 --> 23:07.140
 Breathing is one of those oscillators

23:07.140 --> 23:11.740
 that for life has to be working continuously, 24-7.

23:11.740 --> 23:14.340
 It starts late in the third trimester

23:14.340 --> 23:16.860
 because it has to be working when you're born

23:16.860 --> 23:19.260
 and basically works throughout life.

23:19.260 --> 23:22.300
 And if it stops, if there's no intervention

23:22.300 --> 23:25.820
 beyond a few minutes, it will likely be fatal.

23:25.820 --> 23:28.460
 What is this second oscillator called?

23:28.460 --> 23:33.460
 Well, we found it in a region around the facial nucleus.

23:33.460 --> 23:38.460
 So we initially, when this region was initially identified,

23:39.580 --> 23:43.500
 we thought it was involved in sensing carbon dioxide.

23:43.500 --> 23:46.020
 It was what we call a central chemoreceptor.

23:46.020 --> 23:48.620
 That is, we want to keep carbon dioxide levels,

23:48.620 --> 23:51.940
 particularly in the brain, at a relatively stable level

23:51.940 --> 23:54.380
 because the brain is extraordinarily sensitive

23:54.380 --> 23:56.260
 to changes in pH.

23:56.260 --> 23:59.500
 If there's a big shift in carbon dioxide

23:59.500 --> 24:01.500
 to be a big shift in brain pH,

24:01.500 --> 24:03.460
 to be a big shift in brain pH,

24:03.460 --> 24:05.460
 and that'll throw your brain,

24:05.460 --> 24:08.820
 if I can use the technical term, out of whack.

24:08.820 --> 24:10.980
 And so you want to regulate that.

24:10.980 --> 24:13.740
 And the way to regulate something in the brain

24:13.740 --> 24:15.780
 is you have a sensor in the brain.

24:15.780 --> 24:19.220
 And others basically identified

24:19.220 --> 24:21.180
 that the ventral surface of the brainstem,

24:21.180 --> 24:24.140
 that is the part of the brainstem that's on this side,

24:26.060 --> 24:27.540
 was critical for that.

24:27.540 --> 24:30.540
 And then we identified a structure

24:30.540 --> 24:35.220
 that was near the trapezoid nucleus.

24:35.220 --> 24:39.260
 It was not named in any of these neuroanatomical atlases.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.500
 So we just picked the name out of the hat

24:41.500 --> 24:44.540
 and we called it the retrotrapezoid nucleus.

24:44.540 --> 24:45.620
 I should clarify for people,

24:45.620 --> 24:48.340
 when Jack is saying trapezoid,

24:48.340 --> 24:49.660
 it doesn't mean the trapezoid muscles.

24:49.660 --> 24:52.940
 Trapezoid refers to the shape of this nucleus,

24:52.940 --> 24:54.260
 this cluster of neurons.

24:55.860 --> 24:58.820
 Para-facial makes me think that this general area

24:58.820 --> 25:02.620
 is involved in something related to mouth or face.

25:02.620 --> 25:06.300
 Is it an area rich with neurons

25:06.300 --> 25:08.100
 controlling other parts of the face?

25:08.100 --> 25:12.940
 Eye blinks, nose twitches, lip curls, lip smacks?

25:12.940 --> 25:15.340
 If you go back in an evolutionary sense,

25:15.340 --> 25:18.780
 and a lot of things that are hard to figure out

25:18.780 --> 25:20.620
 begin to make sense when you look

25:20.620 --> 25:23.260
 at the evolution of the nervous system,

25:23.260 --> 25:27.500
 when control of facial muscles,

25:27.500 --> 25:29.300
 going back to more primitive creatures,

25:29.300 --> 25:33.300
 because they had to take things in their mouth for eating.

25:33.300 --> 25:36.700
 So we call that the face sort of developed.

25:36.700 --> 25:38.900
 The eyes were there, the mouth is there.

25:38.900 --> 25:43.900
 These nuclei that contained the motor neurons,

25:43.900 --> 25:46.300
 a lot of the control systems for them

25:46.300 --> 25:49.060
 developed in the immediate vicinity.

25:49.060 --> 25:50.860
 So if you think about the face,

25:50.860 --> 25:54.060
 there's a lot of subnuclei around there

25:54.060 --> 25:55.460
 that had various roles

25:55.460 --> 25:57.820
 at various different times in evolution.

25:57.820 --> 26:00.460
 And at one point in evolution,

26:00.460 --> 26:03.300
 the facial muscles were probably very important

26:03.300 --> 26:06.420
 in moving fluid in and out of the mouth

26:06.420 --> 26:08.940
 and moving air in and out of the mouth.

26:08.940 --> 26:13.580
 And so part of these many different subnuclei

26:13.580 --> 26:15.900
 now seems to be in mammals

26:15.900 --> 26:19.220
 to be involved in the control of expiratory muscles.

26:19.220 --> 26:24.020
 But we have to remember that mammals are very special

26:24.020 --> 26:25.220
 when it comes to breathing,

26:25.220 --> 26:28.500
 because we're the only class of vertebrates

26:28.500 --> 26:30.460
 that have a diaphragm.

26:30.460 --> 26:33.500
 If you look at amphibians and reptiles,

26:33.500 --> 26:35.300
 they don't have a diaphragm.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.020
 And the way they breathe

26:37.020 --> 26:41.500
 is not by actively inspiring and passively expiring.

26:41.500 --> 26:46.180
 They breathe by actively expiring and passively inspiring

26:46.180 --> 26:50.580
 because they don't have a powerful inspiratory muscle.

26:50.580 --> 26:55.580
 And somewhere along the line, the diaphragm developed.

26:55.900 --> 26:58.340
 And there are lots of theories about how it developed.

26:58.340 --> 26:59.780
 I don't think it's particularly clear.

26:59.780 --> 27:04.540
 There was something that you can find in alligators

27:04.540 --> 27:06.820
 and lizards that could have turned into a muscle

27:06.820 --> 27:08.940
 that was the diaphragm.

27:08.940 --> 27:12.300
 The amazing thing about the diaphragm

27:12.300 --> 27:15.980
 is that it's mechanically extremely efficient.

27:15.980 --> 27:17.660
 And what do I mean by that?

27:17.660 --> 27:22.180
 Well, if you look at how oxygen gets from outside the body

27:22.180 --> 27:23.540
 into the bloodstream,

27:24.740 --> 27:29.740
 the critical passage is across the membrane in the lung.

27:29.900 --> 27:33.060
 It's called the alveolar capillary membrane.

27:33.060 --> 27:36.420
 The alveolus is part of the lung

27:36.420 --> 27:38.940
 and the blood runs through capillaries,

27:38.940 --> 27:42.460
 which are the smallest tubes in the circulatory system.

27:42.460 --> 27:47.460
 And at that point, oxygen can go from the air-filled alveolus

27:47.980 --> 27:50.300
 into the blood.

27:50.300 --> 27:51.860
 Which is amazing.

27:51.860 --> 27:52.900
 I find that amazing.

27:52.900 --> 27:54.620
 Even though it's just purely mechanical,

27:54.620 --> 27:56.340
 the idea that we have these little sacs in our lungs,

27:56.340 --> 27:57.740
 we inhale and the air goes in

27:57.740 --> 28:01.020
 and literally the oxygen can pass into the bloodstream.

28:01.020 --> 28:02.460
 Passes into the bloodstream.

28:02.460 --> 28:05.180
 But the rate at which it passes

28:05.180 --> 28:08.620
 will depend on the characteristics of the membrane,

28:08.620 --> 28:12.540
 what the distance is between the alveolus

28:12.540 --> 28:14.700
 and the blood vessel, the capillary.

28:14.700 --> 28:18.980
 But the key element is the surface area.

28:18.980 --> 28:20.780
 The bigger the surface area,

28:20.780 --> 28:23.300
 the more oxygen that can pass through.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.260
 It's entirely a passive process.

28:25.260 --> 28:28.700
 There's no magic about making oxygen go in.

28:28.700 --> 28:33.700
 Now, how do you pack a large surface area in a small chest?

28:34.940 --> 28:37.900
 Well, you start out with one tube, which is the trachea.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.860
 The trachea expands.

28:39.860 --> 28:41.860
 Now you have two tubes.

28:41.860 --> 28:45.340
 Then you have four tubes and it keeps branching.

28:45.340 --> 28:48.580
 At some point, at the end of those branches,

28:48.580 --> 28:52.060
 you put a little sphere, which is an alveolus.

28:52.060 --> 28:56.380
 And that determines what the surface area is going to be.

28:56.380 --> 28:59.620
 Now, you then have a mechanical problem.

28:59.620 --> 29:01.340
 You have the surface area.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.540
 You have to be able to pull it apart.

29:03.540 --> 29:08.140
 So imagine you have a little square of elastic membrane.

29:08.140 --> 29:11.020
 It doesn't take a lot of force to pull it apart.

29:11.020 --> 29:14.620
 But now if you increase it by 50 times,

29:14.620 --> 29:17.020
 you need a lot more force to pull it apart.

29:17.020 --> 29:19.860
 So amphibians who were breathing,

29:19.860 --> 29:21.780
 not by compressing the lungs

29:21.780 --> 29:24.980
 and then just passively expanding it,

29:24.980 --> 29:27.260
 weren't able to generate a lot of force.

29:27.260 --> 29:29.620
 So they have relatively few branches.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.580
 So if you look at the surface area

29:31.580 --> 29:34.260
 that they pack in their lungs,

29:34.260 --> 29:36.660
 relative to their body size,

29:36.660 --> 29:38.580
 it's not very impressive.

29:38.580 --> 29:41.300
 Whereas when you get to mammals,

29:41.300 --> 29:44.500
 the amount of branching that you have

29:44.500 --> 29:48.860
 is you have four to 500 million alveoli.

29:48.860 --> 29:51.820
 If we were to take those four to five million alveoli-

29:51.820 --> 29:52.660
 A hundred million.

29:52.660 --> 29:54.260
 Four to five million.

29:54.260 --> 29:55.100
 A hundred million.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.700
 A hundred million, excuse me.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.180
 And lay those out flat,

29:58.180 --> 29:59.980
 what sort of surface area are we talking about?

29:59.980 --> 30:02.020
 About 70 square meters,

30:02.020 --> 30:04.980
 which is about a third the size of a tennis court.

30:04.980 --> 30:05.820
 Wow.

30:05.820 --> 30:07.260
 So you have a membrane inside of you,

30:07.260 --> 30:09.420
 a third the size of a tennis court,

30:09.420 --> 30:12.660
 that you actually have to expand every breath.

30:12.660 --> 30:15.460
 And you do that without exerting much of a,

30:15.460 --> 30:16.780
 you don't feel it.

30:16.780 --> 30:19.020
 And that's because you have this amazing muscle,

30:19.020 --> 30:20.340
 the diaphragm,

30:20.340 --> 30:22.340
 which because of its positioning,

30:22.340 --> 30:26.340
 just by moving two thirds of an inch down,

30:26.340 --> 30:29.460
 is able to expand that membrane enough

30:29.460 --> 30:31.740
 to move air into the lungs.

30:31.740 --> 30:35.540
 Now, at rest,

30:35.540 --> 30:37.380
 the volume of air in your lungs

30:37.380 --> 30:40.300
 is about two and a half liters.

30:40.300 --> 30:42.380
 Do we need to convert that to courts?

30:42.380 --> 30:43.220
 No.

30:43.220 --> 30:45.300
 It's about two and a half liters.

30:45.300 --> 30:47.100
 When you take a breath,

30:47.100 --> 30:50.700
 you're taking another 500 milliliters or half a liter.

30:50.700 --> 30:53.820
 That's the size maybe a little of my fist.

30:53.820 --> 30:58.100
 So you're increasing the volume by 20%,

30:58.100 --> 30:59.500
 but you're doing that

30:59.500 --> 31:02.860
 by pulling on this 70 square meter membrane.

31:02.860 --> 31:06.980
 But that's enough to bring enough fresh air into the lung

31:06.980 --> 31:09.540
 to mix in with the air that's already there,

31:09.540 --> 31:13.660
 that the oxygen levels in your bloodstream

31:13.660 --> 31:17.940
 goes from a partial pressure of oxygen,

31:17.940 --> 31:21.060
 which is 40 millimeters of mercury,

31:21.060 --> 31:23.060
 to 100 millimeters of mercury.

31:23.060 --> 31:25.540
 So that's a huge increase in oxygen.

31:25.540 --> 31:28.900
 And that's enough to sustain normal metabolism.

31:28.900 --> 31:33.140
 So we have this amazing

31:34.420 --> 31:37.580
 mechanical advantage by having a diaphragm.

31:37.580 --> 31:40.540
 Do you think that our brains are larger

31:40.540 --> 31:42.900
 than that of other mammals in part

31:42.900 --> 31:44.180
 because of the amount of oxygen

31:44.180 --> 31:46.820
 that we have been able to bring into our system?

31:46.820 --> 31:50.500
 I would say a key step in the ability

31:50.500 --> 31:52.780
 to develop a large brain

31:52.780 --> 31:57.540
 that has a continuous demand for oxygen is the diaphragm.

31:57.540 --> 32:01.020
 Without a diaphragm, you're an amphibian.

32:01.020 --> 32:06.020
 And there's another solution to increasing oxygen uptake,

32:07.180 --> 32:09.780
 which is the way birds breathe,

32:09.780 --> 32:12.020
 but birds have other limitations

32:12.020 --> 32:16.500
 and they still can't get brains as big as mammals have.

32:16.500 --> 32:24.140
 So the brain utilizes maybe 20% of all the oxygen

32:24.140 --> 32:27.700
 that we intake, and it needs it continuously.

32:27.700 --> 32:29.940
 The brain doesn't want to be neglected.

32:29.940 --> 32:32.780
 So this puts certain demands on breathing system.

32:32.780 --> 32:35.420
 In other words, you can't shut it down for a while,

32:35.420 --> 32:38.020
 which poses other issues.

32:38.020 --> 32:40.500
 You're born and you have to mature.

32:40.500 --> 32:43.180
 You have the small body, you have a small lung,

32:43.180 --> 32:46.100
 you have a third plant rib cage,

32:46.100 --> 32:48.180
 and now you have to develop into an adult,

32:48.180 --> 32:50.140
 which has a stiffer rib cage.

32:50.140 --> 32:52.740
 And so there are changes happening in your brain,

32:52.740 --> 32:54.860
 in your body, where breathing,

32:54.860 --> 32:58.660
 the neural control of breathing has to change on the fly.

32:58.660 --> 33:01.580
 It's not like for things like vision,

33:02.460 --> 33:04.780
 where you have the opportunity to sleep,

33:04.780 --> 33:05.860
 and while you're sleeping,

33:05.860 --> 33:07.500
 the brain is capable of doing things

33:07.500 --> 33:09.620
 that are not easy to do during wakefulness,

33:09.620 --> 33:12.700
 like the construction crew comes in during sleep.

33:12.700 --> 33:14.860
 Breathing has been, the change of breathing

33:14.860 --> 33:18.900
 has been described as trying to build an airplane

33:18.900 --> 33:20.580
 while it's flying.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.980
 Basically what Jack is saying is that

33:22.980 --> 33:25.660
 respiration science is more complex

33:25.660 --> 33:27.220
 and hardworking than vision science,

33:27.220 --> 33:29.500
 which is a direct jab at me

33:29.500 --> 33:30.500
 that some of you might've missed,

33:30.500 --> 33:32.060
 but I definitely did not miss.

33:32.060 --> 33:34.980
 And I appreciate that you always take the opportunity,

33:34.980 --> 33:36.140
 like a good New Yorker,

33:36.140 --> 33:40.620
 to give me a good, healthy intellectual jab.

33:40.620 --> 33:45.100
 A question related to diaphragmatic breathing

33:45.100 --> 33:46.620
 versus non-diaphragmatic breathing,

33:46.620 --> 33:47.980
 because the way you describe it,

33:47.980 --> 33:49.740
 the diaphragm is always involved,

33:49.740 --> 33:51.820
 but over the years,

33:52.900 --> 33:56.580
 whether it be for yoga class or a breath work thing,

33:56.580 --> 33:59.340
 or you hear online that we should be breathing

33:59.340 --> 34:00.300
 with our diaphragm,

34:00.300 --> 34:03.740
 that rather than lifting our rib cage when we breathe

34:03.740 --> 34:06.580
 and our chest, that it is healthier, in air quotes,

34:06.580 --> 34:11.140
 or better somehow to have the belly expand when we inhale.

34:11.140 --> 34:13.180
 I'm not aware of any particular studies

34:13.180 --> 34:16.180
 that have really examined the direct health benefits

34:16.180 --> 34:19.140
 of diaphragmatic versus non-diaphragmatic breathing.

34:19.140 --> 34:24.140
 But if you don't mind commenting on anything you're aware of

34:24.140 --> 34:25.380
 as it relates to diaphragmatic

34:25.380 --> 34:27.380
 versus non-diaphragmatic breathing,

34:27.380 --> 34:29.900
 whether or not people tend to be diaphragmatic breathers

34:29.900 --> 34:31.220
 by default, et cetera,

34:31.220 --> 34:34.060
 that would be, I think, interesting to a number of people.

34:34.060 --> 34:37.500
 Well, I think by default, we are obligate diaphragm breathers.

34:38.980 --> 34:42.820
 There may be pathologies where the diaphragm is compromised

34:42.820 --> 34:45.340
 and you have to use other muscles,

34:45.340 --> 34:47.500
 and that's a challenge.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.780
 It certainly,

34:52.220 --> 34:56.220
 at rest, other muscles can take over,

34:57.620 --> 35:00.140
 but if you need to increase your ventilation,

35:00.140 --> 35:02.780
 the diaphragm is very important.

35:02.780 --> 35:05.340
 It would be hard to increase your ventilation otherwise.

35:05.340 --> 35:06.900
 Do you pay attention to whether or not

35:06.900 --> 35:08.460
 you are breathing in a manner

35:08.460 --> 35:12.860
 where your belly goes out a little bit as you inhale?

35:12.860 --> 35:14.100
 Because I can do it both ways, right?

35:14.100 --> 35:16.420
 I can inhale, bring my belly in,

35:16.420 --> 35:21.260
 or I can inhale, push my diaphragm and belly out,

35:21.260 --> 35:24.060
 not the diaphragm out, and that's interesting, right?

35:24.060 --> 35:25.860
 Because it's a completely different muscle set

35:25.860 --> 35:28.260
 for each version.

35:28.260 --> 35:33.260
 Well, in the context of things like breath practice,

35:33.980 --> 35:37.540
 I'm a bit agnostic about the effects

35:37.540 --> 35:40.580
 of some of the different patterns of breathing.

35:41.460 --> 35:44.780
 Clearly some are gonna work through different mechanisms

35:44.780 --> 35:46.660
 and we can talk about that,

35:46.660 --> 35:48.500
 but at certain level, for example,

35:48.500 --> 35:50.740
 whether it's primarily diaphragm

35:50.740 --> 35:52.940
 where you move your abdomen or not,

35:52.940 --> 35:55.620
 I am agnostic about it.

35:55.620 --> 36:00.260
 I think that the changes that breathing induces

36:00.260 --> 36:02.540
 in emotion and cognition,

36:02.540 --> 36:06.900
 I have different ideas about what the influence is,

36:06.900 --> 36:09.780
 and I don't see that primarily

36:09.780 --> 36:14.140
 as how which particular muscles you're choosing,

36:14.140 --> 36:17.100
 but that just could be my own prejudice.

36:17.100 --> 36:20.060
 Okay, and we will return to that

36:20.940 --> 36:22.700
 as a general theme in a little bit.

36:22.700 --> 36:25.780
 I wanna ask you about sighing.

36:25.780 --> 36:29.260
 One of the many great gifts

36:29.260 --> 36:32.380
 that you've given us over the years

36:32.380 --> 36:35.460
 is an understanding of these things

36:35.460 --> 36:38.260
 that we call physiological sighs.

36:38.260 --> 36:40.380
 Could you tell us about physiological sighs,

36:40.380 --> 36:42.380
 what's known about them,

36:42.380 --> 36:45.820
 what your particular interest in them is,

36:45.820 --> 36:47.540
 and what they're good for?

36:49.740 --> 36:52.260
 Very interesting and important question.

36:52.260 --> 36:57.260
 So everyone has a sense of what a sigh is.

36:58.220 --> 37:02.140
 We certainly, when we're emotional in some ways,

37:02.140 --> 37:04.860
 we're stressed, we're particularly happy,

37:04.860 --> 37:07.180
 we'll take a, we'll sigh.

37:08.340 --> 37:12.580
 It turns out that we're sighing all the time,

37:12.580 --> 37:16.140
 and when I would ask people

37:16.140 --> 37:17.980
 who are not particularly knowledgeable

37:17.980 --> 37:20.780
 that haven't read my papers or James Nestor's book

37:20.780 --> 37:22.940
 or listened to your podcast,

37:23.980 --> 37:27.020
 they're usually off by two orders of magnitude

37:27.020 --> 37:30.220
 about how frequently we sigh on the low side.

37:30.220 --> 37:33.020
 In other words, they say once an hour,

37:33.900 --> 37:38.660
 10 times a day, we sigh about every five minutes.

37:38.660 --> 37:42.620
 And I would encourage anyone who finds that

37:42.620 --> 37:46.460
 to be a unbelievable fact

37:46.460 --> 37:50.380
 is to lie down in a quiet room and just breathe normally,

37:50.380 --> 37:53.060
 just relax, just let go,

37:53.060 --> 37:55.820
 and just pay attention to your breathing,

37:55.820 --> 37:58.020
 and you'll find that every couple of minutes

37:58.020 --> 38:03.020
 you're taking a deep breath and you can't stop it.

38:03.100 --> 38:05.660
 You know, it just happens.

38:05.660 --> 38:06.980
 Now why?

38:06.980 --> 38:09.460
 Well, we have to go back to the lung again.

38:09.460 --> 38:12.660
 The lung has these 500 million alveoli,

38:12.660 --> 38:14.340
 and they're very tiny.

38:14.340 --> 38:18.940
 They're 200 microns across.

38:18.940 --> 38:21.140
 So they're really, really tiny.

38:21.140 --> 38:24.060
 And you can think of them as fluid-filled.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.180
 They're fluid-lined.

38:25.180 --> 38:26.540
 And the reason they're fluid-lined

38:26.540 --> 38:31.540
 has to do with the esoterica of the mechanics of that.

38:32.260 --> 38:34.300
 It makes it a little easier to stretch them

38:34.300 --> 38:37.620
 with this fluid line, which is called surfactant.

38:37.620 --> 38:39.820
 And surfactant is important during development.

38:39.820 --> 38:44.820
 It is a determining factor when premature infants are born.

38:45.860 --> 38:48.700
 If they do not have lung surfactant,

38:48.700 --> 38:52.020
 it makes it much more challenging to take care of them

38:52.020 --> 38:53.620
 than after they have lung surfactant,

38:53.620 --> 38:55.860
 which is sometime, if I remember correctly,

38:55.860 --> 38:59.820
 in the late second, early third trimester, which it appears.

38:59.820 --> 39:01.780
 In any case, it's fluid-lined.

39:01.780 --> 39:06.100
 Now think of a balloon that you would blow up,

39:06.100 --> 39:09.180
 but now before you blow it up, fill the balloon with water.

39:10.020 --> 39:11.660
 Squeeze all the water out,

39:11.660 --> 39:15.260
 and now when you squeeze all the water out,

39:15.260 --> 39:18.300
 you notice the size of the balloons stick to each other.

39:18.300 --> 39:19.380
 Why is that?

39:19.380 --> 39:23.260
 Well, that's because water has what's called surface tension

39:23.260 --> 39:26.940
 and when you have two surfaces of water together,

39:26.940 --> 39:29.420
 they actually tend to stick to each other.

39:29.420 --> 39:31.900
 Now, when you try and blow that balloon up,

39:31.900 --> 39:34.060
 you know that it, or you'll notice

39:34.060 --> 39:35.620
 if you've ever done it before,

39:35.620 --> 39:38.980
 that the balloon is a little harder to inflate

39:38.980 --> 39:40.900
 than if we're dry on the inside.

39:40.900 --> 39:41.740
 Why is that?

39:41.740 --> 39:44.820
 Because you have to overcome that surface tension.

39:44.820 --> 39:49.820
 Well, your alveoli have a tendency to collapse.

39:50.220 --> 39:52.180
 There's 500 million of them.

39:52.180 --> 39:54.580
 They're not collapsing at a very high rate,

39:54.580 --> 39:57.940
 but it's a slow rate that's not trivial.

39:57.940 --> 40:00.420
 And when an alveolus collapses,

40:00.420 --> 40:05.420
 it no longer can receive oxygen or take carbon dioxide out.

40:05.500 --> 40:07.780
 It's sort of taken out of the equation.

40:07.780 --> 40:10.900
 Now, if you have 500 million of them and you lose 10,

40:10.900 --> 40:14.180
 no big deal, but if they keep collapsing,

40:14.180 --> 40:15.940
 you can lose a significant part

40:15.940 --> 40:17.540
 of the surface area of your lung.

40:18.980 --> 40:23.060
 Now, a normal breath is not enough to pop them open,

40:23.060 --> 40:27.380
 but if you take a deep breath, it pops them open.

40:27.380 --> 40:28.220
 Through nose or mouth.

40:28.220 --> 40:29.060
 It doesn't matter.

40:29.060 --> 40:29.900
 It doesn't matter.

40:29.900 --> 40:32.140
 Or it's just increased that lung volume

40:32.140 --> 40:34.100
 because you're just pulling on the lungs.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.140
 They'll pop open about every five minutes.

40:39.700 --> 40:42.380
 And so we're doing it every five minutes

40:42.380 --> 40:44.580
 in order to maintain the health of our lung.

40:45.540 --> 40:48.420
 In the early days of mechanical ventilation,

40:48.420 --> 40:51.620
 which was used to treat polio victims,

40:51.620 --> 40:54.820
 who had weakness of their respiratory muscles,

40:54.820 --> 40:58.900
 they'd be put in these big steel tubes.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.620
 And the way they would work is that the pressure

41:01.620 --> 41:03.940
 outside the body would drop.

41:03.940 --> 41:07.940
 That would put a expansion pressure on the lungs,

41:07.940 --> 41:09.140
 excuse me, on the rib cage.

41:09.140 --> 41:10.620
 The rib cage would expand.

41:10.620 --> 41:12.860
 And then the lung would expand.

41:12.860 --> 41:14.900
 And then the pressure would go back to normal.

41:14.900 --> 41:18.740
 And the lung and rib cage would go back to normal.

41:18.740 --> 41:23.140
 There was a, this was great for getting ventilation,

41:23.140 --> 41:25.460
 but there was a relatively high mortality rate.

41:26.900 --> 41:28.660
 It was a bit of a mystery.

41:28.660 --> 41:32.580
 And one solution was to just give bigger breaths.

41:32.580 --> 41:34.820
 They gave bigger breaths and the mortality rate dropped.

41:34.820 --> 41:38.580
 And it wasn't until, I think it was the 50s,

41:38.580 --> 41:41.780
 where they realized that they didn't have to increase

41:41.780 --> 41:44.820
 every breath to be big.

41:44.820 --> 41:46.860
 What they needed to do is every so often

41:46.860 --> 41:49.100
 they'd have one big breath.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.060
 So you have a couple of minutes of normal breaths

41:51.060 --> 41:52.300
 and then one big breath,

41:52.300 --> 41:55.380
 just mimicking the physiological size.

41:55.380 --> 41:58.020
 And then the mortality rate dropped significantly.

41:58.020 --> 42:03.020
 And if you see someone on a ventilator in the hospital,

42:03.740 --> 42:05.580
 if you watch, every couple of minutes

42:05.580 --> 42:07.820
 that you see the membrane move up and down,

42:07.820 --> 42:10.180
 every couple of minutes there'll be a super breath

42:10.180 --> 42:12.540
 and that pops it open.

42:12.540 --> 42:17.540
 So there are these mechanisms for these physiological size.

42:17.740 --> 42:20.540
 So just like with the collapse of the lungs

42:20.540 --> 42:25.260
 where you need a big pressure to pop it open,

42:25.260 --> 42:26.860
 it's the same thing with the alveoli.

42:26.860 --> 42:28.660
 You need a bigger pressure

42:28.660 --> 42:30.860
 and a normal breath is not enough.

42:30.860 --> 42:32.700
 So you have to take a big inhale.

42:34.380 --> 42:37.380
 And what nature has done is instead of requiring us

42:37.380 --> 42:40.940
 to remember to do it, it does it automatically.

42:40.940 --> 42:43.380
 And it does it about every five minutes.

42:43.380 --> 42:47.660
 And one of the questions we asked is,

42:47.660 --> 42:48.900
 how is this happening?

42:48.900 --> 42:50.260
 Why every five minutes?

42:50.260 --> 42:52.380
 What's doing it?

42:52.380 --> 42:57.380
 And we got into it through a back door.

42:58.460 --> 43:00.580
 Typical of the way a lot of science gets done,

43:00.580 --> 43:04.460
 there's a serendipitous event

43:04.460 --> 43:07.460
 where you run across a paper and something clicks

43:07.460 --> 43:10.580
 and you just, you know, you follow it up.

43:10.580 --> 43:12.380
 Sometimes you go down blind ends

43:12.380 --> 43:15.220
 but this turned out to be incredibly productive.

43:16.900 --> 43:20.660
 One of the guys in my lab was reading a paper about stress

43:20.660 --> 43:24.260
 and during stress, lots of things happen in the body.

43:24.260 --> 43:26.460
 One of which is that the hypothalamus,

43:26.460 --> 43:29.420
 which is very reactive to body state,

43:29.420 --> 43:33.140
 releases peptides, which are specialized molecules

43:33.140 --> 43:36.020
 which then circulate throughout the brain and body

43:36.020 --> 43:37.900
 to have particular effects,

43:37.900 --> 43:40.860
 usually to help deal better with the stress.

43:40.860 --> 43:43.420
 And one class of the peptides that are released

43:43.420 --> 43:45.500
 are called bombastin-related peptides.

43:47.580 --> 43:51.740
 And he also realized because he was a breathing guy

43:51.740 --> 43:54.580
 that when you're stressed, you sigh more.

43:54.580 --> 43:57.980
 So we said, all right, maybe they're related.

43:58.980 --> 44:02.460
 Bombastin is relatively cheap to buy.

44:02.460 --> 44:04.100
 We said, let's buy some bombastin,

44:04.100 --> 44:07.620
 throw it in the brainstem, let's see what happens.

44:07.620 --> 44:12.620
 And, you know, one of the nice things about some experiments

44:13.220 --> 44:16.500
 that we try to design is to fail quickly.

44:16.500 --> 44:19.580
 So here we had the idea, we throw bombastin in

44:19.580 --> 44:21.620
 and if bombastin did nothing,

44:21.620 --> 44:25.140
 nothing lost, maybe $50 to buy the bombastin.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.420
 But if it did something, it might be of some interest.

44:27.420 --> 44:30.580
 So one afternoon he did the experiment

44:30.580 --> 44:33.020
 and he comes to me, he says,

44:33.020 --> 44:34.860
 I won't quote exactly what he said

44:34.860 --> 44:37.220
 because it might need to be censored,

44:37.220 --> 44:39.740
 but he said, look at this.

44:39.740 --> 44:42.420
 And it was in a rat.

44:42.420 --> 44:45.140
 Rats sigh about every two minutes.

44:45.140 --> 44:46.340
 They're smaller than we are

44:46.340 --> 44:48.580
 and they need to sigh more often.

44:48.580 --> 44:53.580
 Their sigh rate went from 20 to 30 per hour

44:54.260 --> 44:57.020
 to 500 per hour when he put bombastin

44:57.020 --> 44:58.740
 into the pre-butts in the complex.

44:58.740 --> 44:59.860
 Amazing.

44:59.860 --> 45:02.580
 And the way he did that is he took a very,

45:02.580 --> 45:07.580
 very fine glass needle and anesthetized a rat

45:08.420 --> 45:10.500
 and inserted that needle directly

45:10.500 --> 45:12.420
 into the pre-butts in the complex.

45:12.420 --> 45:14.980
 So it wasn't a generalized delivery of the peptide,

45:14.980 --> 45:17.100
 it was localized to the pre-butts in there

45:17.100 --> 45:19.980
 and the sigh rate went through the roof.

45:19.980 --> 45:23.100
 And I would add that that was an important experiment

45:23.100 --> 45:26.020
 to deliver the bombastin directly to that site

45:26.020 --> 45:28.180
 because one could have concluded

45:28.180 --> 45:30.420
 that the injection of the bombastin increased sighing

45:30.420 --> 45:32.660
 because it increased stress

45:32.660 --> 45:34.940
 rather than directly increase sighing.

45:34.940 --> 45:37.780
 Amongst hundreds of other possible interpretations.

45:37.780 --> 45:40.260
 So the precision here is very important

45:40.260 --> 45:43.140
 and that goes back to what I said at the very beginning,

45:43.140 --> 45:44.980
 knowing where this is happening

45:44.980 --> 45:47.220
 allows you to do the proper investigations.

45:47.220 --> 45:49.460
 If we didn't know where the inspiratory rhythm

45:49.460 --> 45:53.140
 was originating, we never could have done this experiment.

45:53.140 --> 45:55.820
 And so then we did another experiment.

45:55.820 --> 46:00.820
 We said, okay, what happens if we take the cells

46:01.180 --> 46:02.780
 in the pre-butts in there

46:02.780 --> 46:04.940
 that are responding to the peptide?

46:04.940 --> 46:08.060
 So neurons will respond to a peptide

46:08.060 --> 46:11.740
 because they have specialized receptors for that peptide.

46:11.740 --> 46:15.260
 And not every neuron expresses those receptors.

46:15.260 --> 46:17.300
 In the pre-butts in a complex,

46:17.300 --> 46:20.540
 it's probably a few hundred out of thousands.

46:20.540 --> 46:25.420
 So we use the technique we had used before.

46:25.420 --> 46:28.700
 And this is a technique developed by Doug Lappe

46:28.700 --> 46:33.700
 down in San Diego, where you could take a peptide

46:35.140 --> 46:39.420
 and conjugate it with a molecule called saprin.

46:39.420 --> 46:41.660
 Saprin is a plant-derived molecule

46:41.660 --> 46:44.220
 which is a cousin to ricin.

46:44.220 --> 46:47.900
 And many of your listeners may have heard of ricin.

46:47.900 --> 46:49.740
 It's a ribosomal toxin.

46:49.740 --> 46:51.380
 It's very nasty.

46:51.380 --> 46:56.380
 A single stab with an umbrella will kill you,

46:56.500 --> 46:59.300
 which is something that supposedly happened

46:59.300 --> 47:02.340
 to a Bulgarian diplomat by a Russian operative

47:02.340 --> 47:03.980
 on a bridge in London.

47:03.980 --> 47:04.900
 He got stabbed.

47:04.900 --> 47:08.420
 And the way ricin works is it goes inside a cell,

47:08.420 --> 47:11.300
 crosses the cell membrane, goes inside the cell,

47:11.300 --> 47:14.180
 kills the cell, then it goes to the next cell,

47:14.180 --> 47:16.620
 and then the next cell, and then the next cell.

47:16.620 --> 47:21.580
 It's extremely dangerous.

47:21.580 --> 47:24.100
 In fact, it's firstly impossible to work on in a lab

47:24.100 --> 47:25.180
 in the United States.

47:25.180 --> 47:27.060
 They won't let you touch a ricin.

47:27.060 --> 47:30.420
 Because we've worked with saprin many times.

47:30.420 --> 47:35.060
 Saprin is safe because it doesn't cross cell membranes.

47:35.060 --> 47:38.140
 So you get an injection of saprin and won't do anything

47:38.140 --> 47:39.820
 because it stays outside of cells.

47:39.820 --> 47:41.220
 Please, nobody do that,

47:41.220 --> 47:44.060
 even though it doesn't cross cell membranes.

47:44.060 --> 47:45.860
 Please, nobody inject saprin,

47:45.860 --> 47:49.020
 whether or not you are a operative or otherwise.

47:49.020 --> 47:51.340
 Thank you, Andrew, for protecting me there.

47:53.500 --> 47:56.860
 But what Doug Lappe figured out is that

47:56.860 --> 48:01.260
 when a ligand binds to a receptor,

48:01.260 --> 48:04.220
 that's when a molecule binds to its receptor,

48:04.220 --> 48:09.020
 in many cases, that receptor ligand complex

48:09.020 --> 48:10.820
 gets pulled inside the cell.

48:10.820 --> 48:13.420
 So it goes from the membrane of the cell inside the cell.

48:13.420 --> 48:15.060
 It's more like you can't go to the dance alone,

48:15.060 --> 48:17.260
 but if you're coupled up, you get in the door.

48:17.260 --> 48:18.140
 That's right.

48:18.140 --> 48:23.060
 So what he figured out is he put saprin to the peptide.

48:23.060 --> 48:24.900
 The peptide binds to its receptor.

48:24.900 --> 48:26.580
 It gets internalized.

48:26.580 --> 48:28.740
 And then when it's inside the cell,

48:28.740 --> 48:31.740
 saprin does the same thing the ricin does.

48:31.740 --> 48:33.020
 It kills the cell.

48:33.020 --> 48:34.900
 But then it can't go into the next cell.

48:34.900 --> 48:37.780
 So the only cells that get killed,

48:37.780 --> 48:40.300
 or the more polite term, ablated,

48:40.300 --> 48:43.940
 are cells that express that receptor.

48:43.940 --> 48:46.780
 So if you have a big conglomeration of cells,

48:46.780 --> 48:47.900
 and you have a few thousand,

48:47.900 --> 48:51.940
 and only 50 of them express that receptor,

48:51.940 --> 48:55.420
 then you inject the saprin conjugated to the ligand,

48:55.420 --> 48:58.100
 to the peptide, and only those 50 cells die.

48:59.020 --> 49:03.700
 So we took bombicin conjugated to saprin,

49:03.700 --> 49:07.740
 injected in the pre-butzinger complex of rats,

49:07.740 --> 49:11.900
 and it took about a couple of days for the saprin

49:11.900 --> 49:14.860
 to actually ablate cells.

49:14.860 --> 49:18.420
 And what happened is that the mice started sighing

49:18.420 --> 49:22.860
 less and less, excuse me, the rats started sighing less

49:22.860 --> 49:26.660
 and less and less and less, and essentially stopped sighing.

49:26.660 --> 49:31.580
 So your student, or postdoc was it,

49:31.580 --> 49:34.660
 murdered these cells, and as a consequence,

49:34.660 --> 49:36.540
 the sighing goes away.

49:36.540 --> 49:39.620
 What was the consequence of eliminating sighing

49:39.620 --> 49:44.620
 on the internal state or the behavior of the rats?

49:45.580 --> 49:50.100
 In other words, if one can't sigh,

49:50.100 --> 49:51.460
 generate physiological sighs,

49:51.460 --> 49:55.140
 what is the consequence on state of mind?

49:55.140 --> 49:57.020
 You would imagine that carbon dioxide

49:57.020 --> 49:58.220
 would build up more readily,

49:58.220 --> 50:01.620
 or to higher levels in the bloodstream,

50:01.620 --> 50:04.260
 and that the animals would be more stressed.

50:04.260 --> 50:06.240
 That's the kind of logical extension

50:06.240 --> 50:07.620
 of the way we set it up.

50:07.620 --> 50:10.180
 It was less benign than that.

50:11.060 --> 50:14.420
 When the animals got to the point where they weren't sighing,

50:14.420 --> 50:19.220
 then, and we did not determine this,

50:19.220 --> 50:21.740
 but the presumption was that their lung function

50:21.740 --> 50:26.740
 significantly deteriorated, and their whole health

50:27.300 --> 50:31.460
 deteriorated significantly, and we had to sacrifice them.

50:31.460 --> 50:35.420
 So I can't tell you whether they were stressed or not,

50:35.420 --> 50:38.060
 but their breathing got to be significantly

50:41.100 --> 50:44.380
 deteriorated that we sacrificed them at that point.

50:44.380 --> 50:48.100
 Now, we don't know whether that is specifically related

50:48.100 --> 50:50.180
 to the fact they didn't sigh,

50:50.180 --> 50:52.700
 or that there was secondary damage

50:52.700 --> 50:54.300
 due to the fact that some cells die,

50:54.300 --> 50:56.020
 so we never determined that.

50:56.020 --> 51:01.020
 Now, after we did this study, to be candid,

51:02.260 --> 51:04.140
 it wasn't a high priority for us

51:04.140 --> 51:06.720
 to get this out the door and publish it,

51:06.720 --> 51:08.220
 so it stayed on the shelf.

51:09.260 --> 51:13.260
 Then I got a phone call from a graduate student

51:13.260 --> 51:17.580
 at Stanford, Kevin Yackel, who starts asking me

51:17.580 --> 51:22.340
 all these interesting questions about breathing,

51:22.340 --> 51:24.600
 and I'm happy to answer them, but at some point,

51:24.600 --> 51:27.720
 it concerned me because he was working

51:27.720 --> 51:32.720
 for a renowned biochemist who worked on lung and Drosophila,

51:32.720 --> 51:35.360
 fruit flies, Mark Krasnow.

51:35.360 --> 51:37.040
 Yeah, got my next door colleague.

51:37.040 --> 51:40.920
 Right, and I said, why are you asking me this?

51:40.920 --> 51:43.720
 And he said, I was an undergraduate at UCLA,

51:43.720 --> 51:46.360
 and you gave a lecture in my undergraduate class,

51:46.360 --> 51:48.680
 and I was curious about breathing ever since.

51:48.680 --> 51:51.160
 So that's one of those things which, as a professor,

51:51.160 --> 51:53.800
 you love to hear, that actually is something

51:53.800 --> 51:55.760
 you really affected the life of a student.

51:55.760 --> 51:57.160
 Well, and you birthed a competitor,

51:57.160 --> 51:58.720
 but you had only yourself to blame.

51:58.720 --> 52:01.360
 No, I don't look at that as a competitor.

52:01.360 --> 52:05.480
 I think that there's enough interesting things to go on.

52:05.480 --> 52:07.600
 I know some of our neuroscience colleagues say,

52:07.600 --> 52:10.320
 you can work on my lab, but then when you leave my lab,

52:10.320 --> 52:11.680
 you got to work on something different.

52:11.680 --> 52:13.360
 No one I ever trained with said that.

52:13.360 --> 52:14.200
 It's open field.

52:14.200 --> 52:17.160
 You want to work on something, you hop in the mix.

52:17.160 --> 52:20.520
 But there are people like that, neuroscientists like that.

52:20.520 --> 52:21.360
 I never felt like that.

52:21.360 --> 52:23.560
 I hear that their breathing apparatus are disrupted,

52:23.560 --> 52:25.160
 and it causes a brain dysfunction

52:25.160 --> 52:27.480
 that leads to the behavior you just described.

52:27.480 --> 52:28.680
 That's actually not true.

52:28.680 --> 52:31.840
 Not true, but in terms of the,

52:31.840 --> 52:36.840
 so before we talk about the beautiful story

52:37.920 --> 52:41.880
 with Yackel and Krasnow and Feld lab,

52:43.120 --> 52:46.200
 I want to just make sure that I understand.

52:46.200 --> 52:49.160
 So if physiological sighs don't happen,

52:50.400 --> 52:54.280
 basically breathing overall suffers.

52:54.280 --> 52:56.680
 Well, that would go back to the observations

52:56.680 --> 52:59.280
 and polio victims in these iron lungs

52:59.280 --> 53:02.080
 where the principle deficit was

53:02.080 --> 53:05.440
 there was no hyperinflation of the lungs

53:05.440 --> 53:07.960
 and many of them deteriorated and died.

53:09.120 --> 53:10.640
 And just to stay on this one more moment

53:10.640 --> 53:14.040
 before we move to what you were about to describe,

53:15.520 --> 53:18.280
 we hear often that people will overdose

53:18.280 --> 53:22.200
 on drugs of various kinds because they stop breathing.

53:22.200 --> 53:25.080
 So barbiturates, alcohol combined with barbiturates

53:25.080 --> 53:28.760
 is a common cause of death for drug users

53:28.760 --> 53:32.280
 and contraindications of drugs and these kinds of things.

53:32.280 --> 53:34.200
 You hear all the time about celebrities dying

53:34.200 --> 53:37.480
 because they combined alcohol with barbiturates.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.160
 Is there any evidence that the sighs

53:39.160 --> 53:41.280
 that occur during sleep or during states

53:41.280 --> 53:46.280
 of deep, deep relaxation and sedation

53:48.160 --> 53:52.320
 that sighs recover the brain?

53:52.320 --> 53:55.480
 Because you could imagine that if these sighs don't happen

53:55.480 --> 53:58.880
 as a consequence of some drug impacting these brain centers,

53:58.880 --> 54:00.280
 that that could be one cause

54:00.280 --> 54:03.320
 of basically asphyxiation and death.

54:03.320 --> 54:08.320
 If you look at the progression of any mammal to death,

54:12.280 --> 54:15.440
 you find that their breathing slows down,

54:15.440 --> 54:18.160
 a death due to quote natural causes.

54:18.160 --> 54:22.400
 Their breathing slows down, it will stop

54:22.400 --> 54:23.960
 and then they'll gasp.

54:23.960 --> 54:28.960
 So we have the phrase dying gas, super large breaths.

54:30.960 --> 54:34.560
 They're often described as an attempt to auto resuscitate.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.600
 That is you take that super deep breath

54:37.600 --> 54:40.880
 and that maybe it can kickstart the engine again.

54:40.880 --> 54:45.040
 We do not know the degree to such things as gas

54:45.040 --> 54:48.680
 are really sighs that are particularly large.

54:48.680 --> 54:52.920
 And so if you suppress the ability to gasp

54:52.920 --> 54:57.200
 in an individual who is subject to an overdose,

54:57.200 --> 54:59.960
 then whereas they might been able

54:59.960 --> 55:03.080
 to re-arouse their breathing,

55:03.080 --> 55:05.800
 if that's prevented, they don't get re-aroused.

55:05.800 --> 55:08.960
 So that is certainly a possibility.

55:10.600 --> 55:13.520
 But this has not been investigated.

55:13.520 --> 55:17.400
 I mean one of the things that I'm interested in

55:17.400 --> 55:20.640
 is in individuals who have

55:22.840 --> 55:26.640
 diseases which will affect pre-Butzinger complex.

55:27.680 --> 55:32.400
 And there's data in Parkinson's disease

55:32.400 --> 55:34.080
 and multiple system atrophy,

55:34.080 --> 55:37.640
 which is another form of neurodegeneration

55:37.640 --> 55:40.400
 where there's loss of neurons in pre-Butzinger.

55:40.400 --> 55:45.400
 And the question is, and it also may happen in ALS,

55:47.560 --> 55:50.120
 sometimes referred to as Lou Gehrig's disease,

55:50.120 --> 55:52.040
 and mitral foot glottal sclerosis.

55:53.480 --> 55:57.840
 These individuals often die during sleep.

55:59.760 --> 56:03.560
 We have an idea that we have not been able

56:03.560 --> 56:07.000
 to get anyone to test is that

56:07.000 --> 56:12.000
 patients with Parkinson's, patients with MLS,

56:13.120 --> 56:16.480
 typically breathe normally during wakefulness.

56:16.480 --> 56:19.240
 The disturbances that they have in breathing

56:19.240 --> 56:20.080
 is during sleep.

56:20.080 --> 56:24.400
 So Parkinson's patients at the end stages of the disease

56:24.400 --> 56:28.000
 often have significant disturbances in their sleep pattern,

56:28.000 --> 56:30.040
 but not during wakefulness.

56:30.040 --> 56:32.880
 And we think that what could be happening

56:32.880 --> 56:35.240
 is that the proximate cause of death

56:35.240 --> 56:39.040
 is not heart failure, is that they become apneic,

56:39.040 --> 56:41.360
 they stop breathing and don't resuscitate.

56:42.400 --> 56:46.840
 And that resuscitation may or may not be due

56:46.840 --> 56:49.760
 to an explicit suppression of size,

56:49.760 --> 56:52.720
 but to an overall suppression of the whole apparatus

56:52.720 --> 56:54.800
 of the pre-Butzinger complex.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.200
 Got it, thank you.

56:57.800 --> 56:59.400
 So Yackel calls you up.

56:59.400 --> 57:04.400
 So he calls me up and he's great kids, super smart,

57:04.400 --> 57:09.360
 and he tells me about these experiments that he's doing

57:09.360 --> 57:13.560
 where he's looking at a database

57:13.560 --> 57:16.360
 to try and find out what molecules are enriched

57:16.360 --> 57:19.800
 in regions of the brain that are critical for breathing.

57:19.800 --> 57:22.760
 So we and others have mapped out these regions

57:22.760 --> 57:25.560
 in the brain stem, and he was looking

57:25.560 --> 57:28.800
 at one of these databases to see what's enriched.

57:28.800 --> 57:31.480
 And I said, that's great.

57:31.480 --> 57:34.560
 Would you be willing to sort of share our work together?

57:34.560 --> 57:38.440
 He says, no, my advisor doesn't want me to do that.

57:38.440 --> 57:39.520
 So I said, okay.

57:40.880 --> 57:45.880
 But Kevin's a great kid and I enjoyed talking to him

57:46.400 --> 57:48.160
 and he's a smart guy.

57:48.160 --> 57:53.160
 And you know, what I found in academia

57:53.360 --> 57:58.040
 and is that the smartest people

57:58.040 --> 58:00.120
 only wanna hire people smarter than them

58:00.120 --> 58:02.040
 and only wanna have the preference

58:02.040 --> 58:04.440
 to interact with people smarter than them.

58:04.440 --> 58:08.720
 The faculty who are not at the highest level

58:08.720 --> 58:12.440
 and at every institution there's a distribution,

58:12.440 --> 58:14.640
 the ones above the mean and those below the mean,

58:14.640 --> 58:17.800
 those who are below the mean are very threatened by that.

58:18.680 --> 58:23.680
 And I saw Kevin as like a shining light

58:24.000 --> 58:26.760
 and I didn't care whether he was gonna out-compete me

58:26.760 --> 58:29.840
 because whatever he did was gonna help me in the field.

58:29.840 --> 58:34.080
 So I did whatever I can to help, to work with Kevin.

58:34.080 --> 58:36.880
 So at one point I got invited

58:36.880 --> 58:40.240
 to give grand rounds of neurology at Stanford.

58:40.240 --> 58:43.280
 Turns out an undergraduate student who had worked with me

58:43.280 --> 58:45.200
 was now head of the training program

58:45.200 --> 58:49.120
 for neurologists at Stanford and he invited me.

58:49.120 --> 58:52.080
 And at the end of my visit,

58:52.080 --> 58:56.480
 I go to Mark Krausner's office and Kevin is there

58:56.480 --> 59:00.600
 and a postdoc Pungley who was also working on a project

59:00.600 --> 59:04.840
 was there and towards the end of the conversation,

59:08.920 --> 59:10.240
 Mark says to me,

59:11.240 --> 59:14.840
 you know, we found this one molecule

59:14.840 --> 59:16.960
 which is highly concentrated

59:16.960 --> 59:19.160
 in an important region for breathing.

59:20.280 --> 59:22.840
 I said, oh that's great, what is it?

59:22.840 --> 59:24.360
 And he says, I can't tell you

59:24.360 --> 59:26.600
 because we wanna work on it.

59:27.480 --> 59:30.240
 So of course I'm disappointed

59:30.240 --> 59:35.240
 but I realized that the ethic in some areas of science

59:35.840 --> 59:38.120
 or the custom in some areas of science

59:38.120 --> 59:40.160
 is that until you get a publication,

59:40.160 --> 59:42.840
 you'll be relatively restricted in sharing information.

59:42.840 --> 59:45.560
 Mark and I are gonna have a chat when I get back.

59:45.560 --> 59:47.320
 Well he may remember the story differently

59:47.320 --> 59:49.800
 but I said okay.

59:49.800 --> 59:51.720
 And as I'm walking out the door,

59:51.720 --> 59:53.880
 I remember these experiments I described to you

59:53.880 --> 59:57.120
 about Bombesan and that was the only unusual molecule

59:57.120 --> 59:58.360
 we're working in.

59:58.360 --> 1:00:00.640
 So the reason I'm rushing out the door

1:00:00.640 --> 1:00:02.440
 is I have a flight to catch.

1:00:02.440 --> 1:00:04.720
 So I stick my head in, I said,

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.720
 is this molecule related to Bombesan?

1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:11.280
 And then I run off, I don't even wait for them to reply.

1:00:11.280 --> 1:00:15.760
 I get to the airport, Mark calls me and he says,

1:00:15.760 --> 1:00:19.360
 Bombesan, the peptide we found is related to Bombesan,

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:20.440
 what does it do?

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:22.400
 And I said, I'm not telling.

1:00:22.400 --> 1:00:23.240
 And-

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:27.640
 Oh my, I'm so glad I wasn't involved in this collaboration.

1:00:27.640 --> 1:00:30.920
 No, no, but that was sort of a tease

1:00:30.920 --> 1:00:33.880
 because I said, well, let's work together on this.

1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:34.720
 And then we worked together on this.

1:00:34.720 --> 1:00:38.080
 It was a prisoner's dilemma at that point, yeah.

1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:43.240
 So Kevin Yackel is spectacular,

1:00:43.240 --> 1:00:44.880
 has his own lab at UCSF.

1:00:44.880 --> 1:00:48.240
 And the work that I'm familiar with from Kevin

1:00:48.240 --> 1:00:53.240
 is worth mentioning now, or I'll ask you to mention it,

1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:58.560
 which is this reciprocal relationship between brain state,

1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:01.040
 or we could even say emotional state and breathing.

1:01:01.040 --> 1:01:04.960
 And I'd love to get your thoughts on how breathing interacts

1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:07.840
 with other things in the brain.

1:01:07.840 --> 1:01:09.800
 You've beautifully described how breathing controls

1:01:09.800 --> 1:01:11.640
 the lungs, the diaphragm and the interactions

1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:14.660
 between oxygen and carbon dioxide and so forth.

1:01:14.660 --> 1:01:18.520
 But as we know, when we get stressed,

1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:19.600
 our breathing changes.

1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:22.800
 When we're happy and relaxed, our breathing changes.

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:25.760
 But also if we change our breathing,

1:01:25.760 --> 1:01:29.000
 we in some sense can adjust our internal state.

1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:33.240
 What is the relationship between brain state and breathing?

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:37.760
 And if you would, because I know you have a particular love

1:01:37.760 --> 1:01:41.440
 of one particular aspect of this,

1:01:41.440 --> 1:01:44.680
 what is the relationship between brain rhythms,

1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:47.480
 oscillations, if you will, and breathing?

1:01:47.480 --> 1:01:50.840
 This is a topic which has really intrigued me

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.600
 over the past decade.

1:01:52.600 --> 1:01:55.720
 I would say before that, I was in my silo,

1:01:55.720 --> 1:01:57.840
 just interested about how the rhythm of breathing

1:01:57.840 --> 1:02:00.640
 is generated and didn't really pay much attention

1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:02.180
 to this other stuff.

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:06.040
 For some reason, I got interested in it.

1:02:06.040 --> 1:02:08.120
 And I think it was triggered by an article

1:02:08.120 --> 1:02:11.120
 in the New York Times about mindfulness.

1:02:11.120 --> 1:02:14.080
 Now, believe it or not, although I'd lived in California

1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:17.480
 for 20 years at that time, I never heard of mindfulness.

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:21.000
 It's staggering how isolated you can be from the real world.

1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:24.080
 And I Googled it, and there was a mindfulness institute

1:02:24.080 --> 1:02:28.280
 at UCLA, and they were giving courses in meditation.

1:02:29.360 --> 1:02:33.580
 So I said, oh, this is great because I can now see

1:02:33.580 --> 1:02:36.880
 whether or not the breathing part of meditation

1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:40.280
 has anything to do with the purported effects of meditation.

1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:42.080
 So I signed up for the course.

1:02:42.080 --> 1:02:45.880
 And as I joked to you before, I had two goals.

1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:49.600
 One was to see whether or not breathing had an effect,

1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:51.680
 and the other was to levitate.

1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:54.480
 Because I grew up with all these kung fu things,

1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:56.800
 and all the monks could levitate when they meditated.

1:02:56.800 --> 1:02:57.680
 So why not?

1:03:00.160 --> 1:03:01.320
 We have a model in the lab.

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:02.640
 You can't do anything interesting

1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:04.380
 if you're afraid of failing.

1:03:04.380 --> 1:03:07.980
 And if I fail to levitate, well, at least I tried.

1:03:07.980 --> 1:03:10.060
 And I should tell you now, I still haven't done it yet,

1:03:10.060 --> 1:03:11.880
 but I haven't given up yet.

1:03:11.880 --> 1:03:12.840
 I haven't given up.

1:03:14.100 --> 1:03:17.160
 So I took this course in mindfulness,

1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:22.160
 and it became apparent to me that the breathing part

1:03:22.960 --> 1:03:24.120
 was actually critical.

1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:27.720
 It wasn't simply a distraction or a focus.

1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:32.020
 They could have had you move your index finger

1:03:32.020 --> 1:03:32.860
 to the same effect.

1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:36.560
 But I really believed that the breathing part was involved.

1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:39.680
 Now, I'm not an unbiased observer,

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:43.220
 so the question is, how can I demonstrate that?

1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:48.620
 I didn't feel competent to do experiments in humans,

1:03:48.620 --> 1:03:50.000
 and I didn't feel like I designed

1:03:50.000 --> 1:03:51.240
 the right experiments in humans,

1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:55.320
 but I felt maybe I can study this in rodents.

1:03:55.320 --> 1:03:58.660
 So we got this idea that we're gonna teach rodents

1:03:58.660 --> 1:03:59.580
 to meditate.

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:06.240
 And that's laughable, but we said,

1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:11.160
 but if we can, then we can actually study how this happens.

1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:14.840
 So believe it or not,

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:18.240
 I was able to get a sort of a starter grant,

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:21.240
 an R21 from NCCIH.

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:25.960
 That's the National Complementary Medicine Institute.

1:04:25.960 --> 1:04:27.760
 A wonderful institute I should mention.

1:04:27.760 --> 1:04:31.040
 Our government puts major tax dollars

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.340
 toward studies of things like meditation, breath work,

1:04:35.340 --> 1:04:38.240
 supplements, herbs, acupuncture.

1:04:38.240 --> 1:04:41.160
 This is, I think, not well known,

1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:42.880
 and it's an incredible thing

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:46.000
 that our government does that,

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.480
 and I think it deserves a nod and more funding.

1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:50.960
 I totally agree with you.

1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:54.220
 I think that it's the kind of thing that many of us,

1:04:54.220 --> 1:04:56.260
 including many scientists,

1:04:56.260 --> 1:04:59.760
 thinks is too woo-woo and unsubstantiated.

1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:02.060
 But for learning more and more,

1:05:02.060 --> 1:05:03.920
 we used to laugh at neuroimmunology,

1:05:03.920 --> 1:05:05.440
 that the nervous system didn't have anything

1:05:05.440 --> 1:05:07.040
 to do with the immune system,

1:05:07.040 --> 1:05:11.400
 and pain itself can influence your immune system.

1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:13.560
 I mean, there are all these things that we're learning

1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:15.320
 that we used to dismiss,

1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:19.880
 and I think there's real nuggets to be learned here.

1:05:19.880 --> 1:05:23.040
 So they went out on a limb

1:05:23.040 --> 1:05:25.720
 and they funded this particular project.

1:05:25.720 --> 1:05:29.160
 And now I'm gonna leap ahead because for three years,

1:05:29.160 --> 1:05:32.500
 we threw stuff up against the wall that didn't work.

1:05:32.500 --> 1:05:37.500
 And recently, we had a major breakthrough.

1:05:37.920 --> 1:05:42.720
 We found a protocol by which we can get mice

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:46.660
 to breathe slowly, awake mice to breathe slowly.

1:05:47.580 --> 1:05:48.480
 I won't tell you.

1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:49.840
 Normally, they don't breathe slowly.

1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:50.680
 No, no.

1:05:50.680 --> 1:05:52.140
 In other words, whatever their normal breath is,

1:05:52.140 --> 1:05:55.200
 we could slow it down by a factor of 10,

1:05:55.200 --> 1:05:56.640
 and they're fine doing that.

1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:59.240
 So we could do that for,

1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:04.240
 we did that 30 minutes a day for four weeks, okay?

1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:05.720
 Like a breath practice.

1:06:05.720 --> 1:06:06.700
 Do they levitate?

1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:09.380
 We haven't measured that yet.

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:12.440
 I would say a priori,

1:06:12.440 --> 1:06:14.800
 we haven't seen them floating to the top of their cage,

1:06:14.800 --> 1:06:15.800
 but we haven't weighed them.

1:06:15.800 --> 1:06:17.440
 Maybe they weigh less.

1:06:17.440 --> 1:06:21.680
 You know, maybe levitation is graded,

1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:23.280
 and so maybe if you weigh less,

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:25.360
 it's sort of a partial levitation.

1:06:25.360 --> 1:06:30.360
 In any case, we then tested them,

1:06:30.840 --> 1:06:34.600
 and we had control animals, mice,

1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:37.160
 where we did everything the same,

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:39.640
 except the manipulation we made

1:06:39.640 --> 1:06:42.000
 did not slow down their breathing.

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:44.100
 So, but they went through everything else.

1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:47.440
 We then put them through a standard fear conditioning,

1:06:47.440 --> 1:06:49.960
 which we did with my colleague, Michael Fanzolo,

1:06:49.960 --> 1:06:53.720
 who's one of the real gurus of fear.

1:06:53.720 --> 1:06:58.240
 And we measured a standard test

1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:01.780
 is to put mice in a condition

1:07:01.780 --> 1:07:05.280
 where they're concerned that we receive a shock,

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:07.880
 and their response is that they freeze.

1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:10.600
 And the measure of how fearful they are

1:07:10.600 --> 1:07:12.000
 is how long they freeze.

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:14.920
 This is well validated,

1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:17.920
 and it's way above my pay grade to describe

1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:21.640
 the validity of the test, but it's very valid.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:26.640
 The control mice had a freezing time,

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:30.640
 which was just the same as ordinary mice would have.

1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:32.440
 The ones that went through our protocol

1:07:32.440 --> 1:07:35.120
 froze much, much less.

1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:38.200
 According to Michael,

1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:42.960
 the degree to which they showed less freezing

1:07:42.960 --> 1:07:46.180
 was as much as if there was a major manipulation

1:07:46.180 --> 1:07:48.600
 in the amygdala, which is a part of the brain

1:07:48.600 --> 1:07:51.040
 that's important in fear processing.

1:07:51.040 --> 1:07:52.480
 It's a staggering change.

1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:56.960
 The problem we have now is the grant ran out of money,

1:07:56.960 --> 1:07:59.160
 the postdoc working on it left,

1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:02.160
 and now we have to try and piece together everything,

1:08:03.320 --> 1:08:06.040
 but the data is spectacular.

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:07.200
 Well, I think it's,

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:08.520
 I'll just pause you for a moment there,

1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:09.760
 because I think that the,

1:08:09.760 --> 1:08:11.180
 you know, you're talking about a rodent study,

1:08:11.180 --> 1:08:14.120
 but I think the benefits of doing rodent studies

1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:15.920
 that you can get deep into mechanism,

1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:20.440
 and for people that might think,

1:08:20.440 --> 1:08:22.760
 well, we've known that meditation has these benefits,

1:08:22.760 --> 1:08:24.660
 why do you need to get mechanistic science?

1:08:24.660 --> 1:08:27.160
 I think that one thing that's important

1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:28.560
 for people to remember is that,

1:08:28.560 --> 1:08:32.600
 first of all, as many people as one might think

1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:35.440
 are meditating out there or doing breath work,

1:08:35.440 --> 1:08:38.920
 a far, far, far greater number of people are not, right?

1:08:38.920 --> 1:08:42.320
 I mean, the majority of people don't take any time

1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:46.320
 to do dedicated breath work nor meditate.

1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:50.620
 So whatever can incentivize people would be wonderful.

1:08:50.620 --> 1:08:52.040
 But the other thing is that

1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:54.460
 it's never really been clear to me

1:08:54.460 --> 1:08:57.840
 just how much meditation is required for a real effect,

1:08:57.840 --> 1:08:59.700
 meaning a practical effect.

1:08:59.700 --> 1:09:01.840
 People say 30 minutes a day, 20 minutes a day,

1:09:01.840 --> 1:09:04.800
 once a week, twice a week, same thing with breath work.

1:09:04.800 --> 1:09:07.600
 Finding minimum or effective thresholds

1:09:07.600 --> 1:09:09.840
 for changing neural circuitry

1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:13.740
 is what I think is the holy grail of all these practices,

1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:15.160
 and that's only going to be determined

1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:17.380
 by the sorts of mechanistic studies that you describe.

1:09:17.380 --> 1:09:18.480
 So this is wonderful.

1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:20.320
 I do hope the work gets completed

1:09:20.320 --> 1:09:22.840
 and we can talk about ways that,

1:09:22.840 --> 1:09:25.280
 we can ensure that that happens, but-

1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:28.320
 But let me add one thing to what you're saying, Andrew.

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:31.720
 One of the issues I think for a lot of people

1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:34.400
 is that there's a placebo effect.

1:09:34.400 --> 1:09:38.140
 That is, in humans, they can respond to something

1:09:38.140 --> 1:09:40.440
 even though the mechanism has nothing to do

1:09:40.440 --> 1:09:43.440
 with what the intervention is.

1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:47.520
 And so it's easy to say that the meditative response

1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.620
 has a big component which is a placebo effect.

1:09:51.620 --> 1:09:54.400
 My mice don't believe in the placebo effect.

1:09:54.400 --> 1:09:58.220
 And so if we could show there's a bona fide effect in mice,

1:09:58.220 --> 1:10:01.160
 it is convincing in ways that no matter

1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:03.200
 how many human experiments you did,

1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:04.720
 the control for the placebo effect

1:10:04.720 --> 1:10:06.880
 is extremely difficult in humans.

1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:09.560
 In mice, it's a non-issue.

1:10:09.560 --> 1:10:12.040
 So I think that that in of itself

1:10:12.040 --> 1:10:14.480
 would be an enormous message to send.

1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:17.480
 Excellent and indeed a better point.

1:10:18.620 --> 1:10:23.620
 I think a 30-minute-a-day meditation in these mice,

1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:27.060
 if I understand correctly, the meditation,

1:10:27.060 --> 1:10:27.900
 we don't know what they're thinking about-

1:10:27.900 --> 1:10:28.880
 Well, it's breath practice.

1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:30.720
 Right, so it's breath practice.

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:32.800
 Because presumably they're not thinking

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:35.320
 about their third eye center, lotus position, levitation,

1:10:35.320 --> 1:10:38.160
 whatever it is, they're not instructed as to what to do

1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:40.440
 and if they were, they probably wouldn't do it anyway.

1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:43.080
 So 30 minutes a day in which breathing

1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:45.840
 is deliberately slowed or is slowed

1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:48.120
 relative to their normal patterns of breathing.

1:10:48.120 --> 1:10:48.940
 Got it.

1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:54.320
 What was the frequency of sighing during that 30 minutes?

1:10:54.320 --> 1:10:55.320
 Unclear. We don't know yet.

1:10:55.320 --> 1:10:56.560
 Well, no, we have the data.

1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:58.440
 We just, we're analyzing the data.

1:10:58.440 --> 1:11:01.240
 To be determined or to be announced at some point.

1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:06.240
 So the fear centers are altered in some way

1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:10.900
 that creates a shorter fear response to a foot shock.

1:11:10.900 --> 1:11:12.480
 Right.

1:11:12.480 --> 1:11:14.700
 What are some other examples that you are aware of

1:11:14.700 --> 1:11:16.060
 from working in your laboratory

1:11:16.060 --> 1:11:18.100
 or work in other laboratories for that matter

1:11:18.100 --> 1:11:20.140
 about interactions between breathing

1:11:20.140 --> 1:11:22.420
 and brain state or emotional state?

1:11:22.420 --> 1:11:25.380
 So this gets back to a prior conversation

1:11:25.380 --> 1:11:27.180
 I sort of went off on a tangent.

1:11:30.400 --> 1:11:33.540
 We need, I think we need to think separately

1:11:33.540 --> 1:11:37.860
 of the effect of volitional changes of breathing

1:11:37.860 --> 1:11:42.140
 on emotion versus the effect,

1:11:44.620 --> 1:11:48.120
 the effect of brain state on breathing.

1:11:48.120 --> 1:11:49.700
 So the effect of brain state on breathing

1:11:49.700 --> 1:11:54.260
 like when you're stressed is a effect

1:11:54.260 --> 1:11:57.460
 or presumably originating in higher centers

1:11:57.460 --> 1:12:00.160
 if I can use that term, affecting breathing.

1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:05.160
 The reciprocal is that when you change breathing,

1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:07.720
 it affects your emotional state.

1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:11.160
 I think of those two things as different

1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:13.080
 that may ultimately be tied together.

1:12:13.080 --> 1:12:16.520
 So there's a landmark paper published in the 50s

1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:20.480
 where they stimulated in the amygdala of cats

1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:22.440
 and depending on where they stimulated,

1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:25.320
 they got profound changes in breathing.

1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:26.840
 There's like every pattern of breathing

1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:29.480
 could possibly imagine they found a site in the amygdala

1:12:29.480 --> 1:12:31.320
 which could produce that.

1:12:31.320 --> 1:12:34.440
 So there's clearly a powerful descending effect

1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:38.120
 coming from the amygdala, which is a major site

1:12:38.120 --> 1:12:41.160
 for processing emotion, fear, stress and whatnot

1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:43.160
 that can affect breathing.

1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:45.800
 And clearly we have volitional control over breathing.

1:12:45.800 --> 1:12:48.720
 So we have profound effects there.

1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:51.100
 Now I should say about emotional control of breathing,

1:12:51.100 --> 1:12:55.280
 I need to segue into talking about locked-in syndrome.

1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:00.200
 Locked-in syndrome is a devastating lesion

1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:02.920
 that happens in a part of the brainstem

1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:07.920
 where signals that controlled muscles are transmitted.

1:13:09.120 --> 1:13:12.560
 So the fibers coming from your motor cortex

1:13:13.480 --> 1:13:16.520
 go down to this part of the brainstem

1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:19.200
 which is called the ventral pons.

1:13:19.200 --> 1:13:24.200
 And if there's a stroke there, it can damage these pathways.

1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:27.060
 What happens in individuals who have locked-in syndrome

1:13:27.060 --> 1:13:29.900
 is they lose all volitional movement

1:13:29.900 --> 1:13:32.380
 except lateral movement of the eyes

1:13:32.380 --> 1:13:34.420
 and maybe the ability to blink.

1:13:34.420 --> 1:13:38.700
 The reason they're able to still blink and move their eyes

1:13:38.700 --> 1:13:43.700
 is that those control centers are rostral,

1:13:43.700 --> 1:13:46.540
 closer to, are not interrupted.

1:13:46.540 --> 1:13:49.500
 In other words, the interruption is below that.

1:13:50.620 --> 1:13:52.500
 They continue to breathe

1:13:52.500 --> 1:13:55.780
 because the centers for breathing

1:13:55.780 --> 1:13:58.380
 don't require that volitional command.

1:13:58.380 --> 1:14:00.060
 In any case, they're below that.

1:14:00.060 --> 1:14:01.380
 So they're fine.

1:14:01.380 --> 1:14:03.500
 So these people continue to breathe.

1:14:03.500 --> 1:14:08.500
 Normal intelligence, but they can't move.

1:14:08.780 --> 1:14:10.060
 There's a great book called

1:14:10.060 --> 1:14:11.540
 The Diving Bell and the Butterfly

1:14:11.540 --> 1:14:16.540
 about a young man who this happens to

1:14:17.060 --> 1:14:19.960
 and he describes his life.

1:14:19.960 --> 1:14:23.860
 And it's a real testament to the human condition

1:14:23.860 --> 1:14:25.220
 that he does this.

1:14:25.220 --> 1:14:26.340
 It's a remarkable book.

1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:27.440
 It's a short book.

1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:30.340
 Did he write the book by blinking to the translator?

1:14:30.340 --> 1:14:32.580
 He did it by blinking to his caretaker.

1:14:33.620 --> 1:14:34.460
 It's pretty amazing.

1:14:34.460 --> 1:14:37.180
 And there was a movie which I've never seen

1:14:37.180 --> 1:14:40.760
 with Javier Bardin as the protagonist,

1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:44.460
 but the book I highly recommend to anyone to read.

1:14:45.800 --> 1:14:47.420
 So I had colleagues studying an individual

1:14:47.420 --> 1:14:49.580
 who had locked-in syndrome.

1:14:49.580 --> 1:14:53.660
 And this patient breathed very robotically.

1:14:54.740 --> 1:14:57.620
 Totally consistent, very regular.

1:14:57.620 --> 1:15:01.340
 They gave the patient a low oxygen mixture to breathe.

1:15:01.340 --> 1:15:03.060
 Ventilation went up.

1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:05.640
 A CO2 mixture to breathe, ventilation went up.

1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:08.380
 So all the regulatory apparatus for breathing was there.

1:15:09.560 --> 1:15:11.540
 They asked the patient to hold his breath

1:15:11.540 --> 1:15:13.340
 or to breathe faster.

1:15:13.340 --> 1:15:15.000
 Nothing happened.

1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.060
 Just the patient recognized the command,

1:15:18.060 --> 1:15:19.060
 but couldn't change it.

1:15:19.060 --> 1:15:20.820
 And all of a sudden the patient's breathing

1:15:20.820 --> 1:15:22.740
 changed considerably.

1:15:22.740 --> 1:15:24.220
 And they said to the patient, what happened?

1:15:24.220 --> 1:15:27.080
 They said, you told a joke and I laughed.

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:29.980
 And they went back.

1:15:29.980 --> 1:15:33.260
 Whenever they told a joke that the patient found funny,

1:15:33.260 --> 1:15:35.580
 the patient's breathing pattern changed.

1:15:35.580 --> 1:15:39.020
 And you know your breathing pattern when you laugh

1:15:39.020 --> 1:15:42.320
 is you inhale, you go ha ha ha ha.

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:43.980
 But it's also very distinctive.

1:15:43.980 --> 1:15:47.260
 We have some neuroscience colleagues who will go unnamed

1:15:47.260 --> 1:15:50.360
 who if you heard them laugh 50 yards away,

1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:51.740
 you know exactly who they are.

1:15:51.740 --> 1:15:53.660
 Yeah, well, I'll name them.

1:15:53.660 --> 1:15:56.820
 Eric Kandel for one has an inspiratory laugh.

1:15:56.820 --> 1:16:00.020
 He's famous for a, as opposed to a ha ha.

1:16:00.020 --> 1:16:01.580
 Exactly, exactly.

1:16:01.580 --> 1:16:04.860
 So it's very stereotyped,

1:16:04.860 --> 1:16:07.780
 but it's maintained in these people

1:16:07.780 --> 1:16:10.180
 who lose volitional control of breathing.

1:16:10.180 --> 1:16:13.700
 So there's an emotive component controlling your breathing,

1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:17.220
 which has nothing to do with your volitional control

1:16:17.220 --> 1:16:19.740
 and it goes down to a different pathway

1:16:19.740 --> 1:16:22.500
 because it's not disrupted by this locked-in syndrome.

1:16:23.780 --> 1:16:26.320
 If you look at motor control of the face,

1:16:27.360 --> 1:16:29.140
 we have the volitional control of the face,

1:16:29.140 --> 1:16:30.700
 but we also have motor control,

1:16:30.700 --> 1:16:32.740
 emotional control of the face,

1:16:32.740 --> 1:16:36.160
 which most of us can't control.

1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:38.280
 So when we look at another person,

1:16:38.280 --> 1:16:41.520
 we tend, we're able to read a lot about

1:16:41.520 --> 1:16:43.900
 what their emotional state is.

1:16:43.900 --> 1:16:46.460
 And that's a lot about how primates communicate.

1:16:46.460 --> 1:16:48.000
 Humans communicate.

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:51.260
 And you have people who are good deceivers,

1:16:51.260 --> 1:16:55.700
 probably used car salesman, poker players,

1:16:55.700 --> 1:16:58.440
 or now poker players have tells,

1:16:58.440 --> 1:17:01.320
 but many of them now wear dark glasses

1:17:01.320 --> 1:17:03.620
 because a lot of the tells you blink or whatnot.

1:17:03.620 --> 1:17:04.460
 Pupil size is a tell.

1:17:04.460 --> 1:17:07.540
 Pupil size, pupil size is a tell,

1:17:07.540 --> 1:17:09.700
 which is an autonomic function,

1:17:09.700 --> 1:17:13.500
 not a skeletal muscle function.

1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:15.580
 But we have all these skeletal muscles

1:17:15.580 --> 1:17:18.460
 which we're controlling, which give us away.

1:17:19.340 --> 1:17:23.260
 I have, I've tried to get my imaging friends

1:17:23.260 --> 1:17:25.100
 to image some of the great actors

1:17:25.100 --> 1:17:27.540
 that we have in Los Angeles.

1:17:27.540 --> 1:17:28.620
 You mean brain imagers.

1:17:28.620 --> 1:17:29.820
 Brain imagers, I'm sorry.

1:17:29.820 --> 1:17:30.640
 No, that's all right.

1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:32.340
 I mean, yeah, brain imagers.

1:17:32.340 --> 1:17:33.420
 Because I think

1:17:35.900 --> 1:17:39.820
 when I tell, ask you to smile,

1:17:39.820 --> 1:17:41.700
 I could tell that you're not happy,

1:17:41.700 --> 1:17:43.700
 that you're smiling because I asked you to smile.

1:17:43.700 --> 1:17:44.540
 I think anybody's that's right.

1:17:44.540 --> 1:17:48.020
 That's a crack at joke, but we're old friends, so.

1:17:48.020 --> 1:17:53.020
 No, I'm not, that when you see a picture

1:17:53.380 --> 1:17:56.620
 like at a birthday or whatnot and say, say cheese,

1:17:56.620 --> 1:17:58.660
 you could tell that at least half of the people

1:17:58.660 --> 1:18:01.140
 are not happy they're saying cheese.

1:18:01.140 --> 1:18:02.860
 Whereas a great actor,

1:18:03.880 --> 1:18:06.300
 when they're able to dissemble

1:18:06.300 --> 1:18:08.920
 in the fact that they're sad or they're happy,

1:18:08.920 --> 1:18:10.620
 you believe it, they're not faking it.

1:18:10.620 --> 1:18:12.980
 It's like, that's great acting.

1:18:12.980 --> 1:18:15.000
 And I don't think everyone could do that.

1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:18.080
 I think that the individuals who are able to do that

1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:21.780
 have some connection to the parts

1:18:21.780 --> 1:18:23.340
 of their emotive control system

1:18:23.340 --> 1:18:24.980
 that the rest of us don't have.

1:18:24.980 --> 1:18:27.880
 Maybe they develop it through training and maybe not,

1:18:27.880 --> 1:18:29.460
 but I think that this can be imaged.

1:18:29.460 --> 1:18:32.980
 So I would like to get one of these great actors

1:18:32.980 --> 1:18:35.940
 in an imager and have them go through that

1:18:35.940 --> 1:18:38.260
 and then get a normal person

1:18:38.260 --> 1:18:40.380
 and see whether or not they can emulate that.

1:18:40.380 --> 1:18:42.700
 And I think you're gonna find big differences

1:18:42.700 --> 1:18:44.860
 in the way they control this emotive thing.

1:18:44.860 --> 1:18:48.340
 So this emotive control of the facial muscles,

1:18:48.340 --> 1:18:50.020
 I think is in large part

1:18:50.020 --> 1:18:52.420
 similar to the emotive control of breathing.

1:18:52.420 --> 1:18:54.800
 So there's that emotive control

1:18:54.800 --> 1:18:56.340
 and there's that volitional control

1:18:56.340 --> 1:18:59.340
 and they're different, they're different.

1:19:00.200 --> 1:19:03.740
 Now, you asked me about the Yakl stuff.

1:19:03.740 --> 1:19:07.640
 The Yakl paper had to do with ascending,

1:19:07.640 --> 1:19:10.420
 that the effect of breathing on emotion.

1:19:10.420 --> 1:19:15.420
 What Kevin found was that there was a population of neurons

1:19:15.740 --> 1:19:18.380
 in the pre-Butzinger complex

1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:21.260
 that we're always looking to things

1:19:21.260 --> 1:19:23.340
 that are projecting ultimately emotive neurons.

1:19:23.340 --> 1:19:25.020
 He found the population of cells

1:19:25.020 --> 1:19:27.940
 that projected to locus coeruleus.

1:19:27.940 --> 1:19:29.820
 Locus coeruleus, excuse me,

1:19:29.820 --> 1:19:32.260
 is one of those places in the brain

1:19:32.260 --> 1:19:34.320
 that seem to go everywhere.

1:19:34.320 --> 1:19:35.620
 Take a sprinkler system.

1:19:35.620 --> 1:19:37.540
 Exactly, exactly.

1:19:37.540 --> 1:19:39.220
 And influence mood.

1:19:39.220 --> 1:19:41.780
 And, you know, you've had podcasts about this.

1:19:41.780 --> 1:19:44.180
 I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on with the amygdala.

1:19:44.180 --> 1:19:46.560
 So, excuse me, the locus coeruleus.

1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:48.900
 So you get into the locus coeruleus,

1:19:48.900 --> 1:19:50.660
 you can now spray information out

1:19:50.660 --> 1:19:52.140
 throughout the entire brain.

1:19:52.140 --> 1:19:56.420
 He found specific cells that projected

1:19:56.420 --> 1:19:59.440
 from pre-Butzinger to locus coeruleus.

1:20:00.620 --> 1:20:03.480
 And that these cells are inspiratory modulator.

1:20:03.480 --> 1:20:08.480
 Now, it's been known for a long time, since the 60s,

1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:13.600
 that if you look in the locus coeruleus of cats

1:20:13.600 --> 1:20:16.040
 when they're awake, you find many neurons

1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:17.760
 that have respiratory modulation.

1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:20.560
 No one paid much attention to them.

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:22.500
 Why bother?

1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:23.920
 Not why bother paying attention,

1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:26.840
 but why would the brain bother to have these inputs?

1:20:26.840 --> 1:20:30.880
 So what Kevin did with Lindsey Schwartz

1:20:30.880 --> 1:20:35.880
 and Lee Shun Low's lab is they killed a blade

1:20:36.560 --> 1:20:41.280
 at those cells going to locus coeruleus from pre-Butzinger.

1:20:41.280 --> 1:20:43.720
 And the animals became calmer.

1:20:44.900 --> 1:20:47.640
 And their EEG levels changed in ways

1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:49.860
 that are indicative that they became calmer.

1:20:49.860 --> 1:20:51.780
 And as I recall, they didn't just become calmer,

1:20:51.780 --> 1:20:55.480
 but they weren't really capable of high arousal states.

1:20:55.480 --> 1:20:56.920
 They were kind of flat.

1:20:56.920 --> 1:21:01.760
 I don't think we really pursued that in the paper.

1:21:03.080 --> 1:21:07.740
 And so we'd have to ask Johnny Huguenard about that.

1:21:07.740 --> 1:21:08.580
 But I-

1:21:08.580 --> 1:21:11.240
 He's on the other side of my lap, so we'll ask him.

1:21:11.240 --> 1:21:12.960
 But nonetheless,

1:21:15.900 --> 1:21:17.820
 that beautifully illustrates

1:21:17.820 --> 1:21:21.320
 how there is a bi-directional control, right,

1:21:21.320 --> 1:21:23.560
 of emotion. Well, that's ascending.

1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:28.560
 Well, no, the two stories of the locked-in syndrome

1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:32.760
 plus the Yakl paper shows that emotional states

1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:33.600
 influence breathing,

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:35.600
 and breathing influences emotional states.

1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:38.900
 But you mentioned inspiration,

1:21:38.900 --> 1:21:41.480
 which I always call inhalation, but people will follow.

1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:44.060
 No, no, it's fine. Those are interchangeable.

1:21:44.060 --> 1:21:45.200
 People can follow that.

1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:48.680
 There's some interesting papers from Noam Sobel's group

1:21:48.680 --> 1:21:51.360
 and from a number of other groups that as we inhale,

1:21:51.360 --> 1:21:53.400
 or right after we inhale,

1:21:53.400 --> 1:21:55.560
 the brain is actually more alert and capable

1:21:55.560 --> 1:21:58.480
 of storing information than during exhales,

1:21:58.480 --> 1:22:01.640
 which I find incredible, but it also makes sense.

1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:04.360
 I'm able to see things far better when my eyes are open

1:22:04.360 --> 1:22:06.800
 than when my eyelids are closed for that matter.

1:22:08.480 --> 1:22:13.360
 Maybe, I don't doubt, I mean, Noam's work is great.

1:22:15.720 --> 1:22:19.800
 Let me backtrack a bit because I want people to understand

1:22:19.800 --> 1:22:22.040
 that when we're talking about breathing affecting

1:22:22.040 --> 1:22:24.400
 emotional cognitive state,

1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:27.700
 it's not simply coming from pre-Butzinger.

1:22:28.840 --> 1:22:33.040
 There are at least, well, there are several other sites,

1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:35.920
 and let me sort of, I need to sort of go through that.

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:37.980
 One is olfaction.

1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:41.480
 So when you're breathing, normal breathing,

1:22:41.480 --> 1:22:44.000
 you're inhaling and exhaling.

1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:48.160
 This is creating signals coming from the nasal mucosa

1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:51.720
 that is going back into the olfactory bulb.

1:22:51.720 --> 1:22:54.000
 That's respiratory modulated.

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.600
 And the olfactory bulb has a profound influence

1:22:57.600 --> 1:23:00.880
 and projections through many parts of the brain.

1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:05.080
 So there's a signal arising from this rhythmic moving

1:23:05.080 --> 1:23:08.720
 of air in and out of the nose that's going into the brain

1:23:08.720 --> 1:23:12.360
 that has contained in it a respiratory modulation.

1:23:12.360 --> 1:23:14.000
 So that signal is there.

1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:15.680
 The brain doesn't have to be using it,

1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:18.720
 but when it's discriminating over and whatnot,

1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:22.820
 that's riding on a oscillation which is respiratory related.

1:23:24.040 --> 1:23:27.200
 Another potential source is the vagus nerve.

1:23:27.200 --> 1:23:29.600
 The vagus nerve is a major nerve

1:23:29.600 --> 1:23:34.440
 which is containing afferents from all of the viscera.

1:23:34.440 --> 1:23:37.480
 Afferents just being signals too.

1:23:37.480 --> 1:23:39.080
 Signals from the viscera.

1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:42.320
 It also has signals coming from the brain stem down

1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:43.880
 which are called efferents,

1:23:43.880 --> 1:23:46.880
 but it's getting major signals from the lung,

1:23:46.880 --> 1:23:51.720
 from the gut, and this is going up into the brain stem.

1:23:51.720 --> 1:23:52.960
 So it's there.

1:23:54.640 --> 1:23:58.020
 There are very powerful receptors in the lung

1:23:58.020 --> 1:24:02.200
 that are responding to the lung volume, the lung stretch.

1:24:02.200 --> 1:24:04.000
 So, baro receptors.

1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:07.120
 Sorry, well, we have a number like that,

1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:10.520
 like the piezo receptors of this year's Nobel Prize, yeah.

1:24:10.520 --> 1:24:14.960
 Yeah, so they're responding to the expansion

1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:16.960
 and relaxation in the lung.

1:24:16.960 --> 1:24:19.080
 And so if you record from the vagus nerve,

1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:22.840
 you'll see that there's a huge respiratory modulation

1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:25.080
 due to the mechanical changes in the lung.

1:24:25.080 --> 1:24:28.600
 Now, why that is of interest is that

1:24:28.600 --> 1:24:32.880
 for some forms of refractory depression,

1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:36.680
 electrostimulation of the vagus nerve

1:24:36.680 --> 1:24:38.760
 can provide tremendous relief.

1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:42.640
 Why this is the case still remains to be determined,

1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:46.160
 but it's clear that signals in the vagus nerve,

1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:48.840
 at least artificial signals in the vagus nerve,

1:24:48.840 --> 1:24:52.740
 can have a positive effect on reducing depression.

1:24:52.740 --> 1:24:55.160
 So it's not a leap to think that

1:24:55.160 --> 1:24:57.240
 under normal circumstances,

1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:00.480
 that that rhythm coming in from the vagus nerve

1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:03.280
 is playing a role in normal processing.

1:25:04.820 --> 1:25:07.080
 Okay, let me continue.

1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:09.340
 Carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.

1:25:09.340 --> 1:25:11.620
 Now, under normal circumstances,

1:25:11.620 --> 1:25:14.640
 your oxygen levels are fine.

1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:16.840
 And unless you go to altitude,

1:25:16.840 --> 1:25:19.160
 they don't really change very much.

1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:22.320
 But your CO2 levels can change quite a bit

1:25:22.320 --> 1:25:24.260
 with even a relatively small change

1:25:24.260 --> 1:25:25.960
 in your overall breathing.

1:25:25.960 --> 1:25:27.860
 That's gonna change your pH level.

1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:32.440
 I have a colleague, Alicia Morette,

1:25:32.440 --> 1:25:37.400
 who is working with patients who are anxious,

1:25:37.400 --> 1:25:40.820
 and many of them hyperventilate.

1:25:40.820 --> 1:25:43.600
 And as a result of that hyperventilation,

1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:45.500
 their carbon dioxide levels are low.

1:25:46.660 --> 1:25:51.660
 And she has developed a therapeutic treatment

1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:56.040
 where she trains these people to breathe slower

1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:01.200
 and to restore their CO2 levels back to normal,

1:26:01.200 --> 1:26:04.180
 and she gets relief from their anxiety.

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:09.840
 So CO2 levels, which are not gonna affect brain function

1:26:09.840 --> 1:26:11.660
 on a breath-by-breath level,

1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:14.840
 although it does fluctuate breath-by-breath,

1:26:14.840 --> 1:26:19.080
 but sort of as a continuous background, can change.

1:26:19.080 --> 1:26:21.160
 And if it's changed chronically,

1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:24.800
 we know that highly elevated levels of CO2

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:26.980
 can produce panic attacks.

1:26:28.240 --> 1:26:32.980
 And we don't know the degree to that gets exacerbated

1:26:32.980 --> 1:26:36.400
 by people who get, who have a panic attack,

1:26:36.400 --> 1:26:39.080
 the degree to which their ambient CO2 levels

1:26:39.080 --> 1:26:42.880
 are affecting their degree of discomfort.

1:26:42.880 --> 1:26:46.440
 What about people who are, tend to be too calm,

1:26:46.440 --> 1:26:48.440
 meaning they're feeling sleepy,

1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:53.040
 they're underbreathing as opposed to overbreathing.

1:26:53.040 --> 1:26:56.320
 Is there any knowledge of what the status of CO2

1:26:56.320 --> 1:26:57.480
 is in their system?

1:26:57.480 --> 1:27:00.040
 I don't know, which doesn't mean there's no knowledge,

1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:04.680
 but I'm unaware, unaware, but that's blissfully unaware.

1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:07.440
 I have not looked at that literature, so I don't know.

1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:09.760
 And I have a feeling, I mean, most people,

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:11.640
 or excuse me, most of the scientific literature

1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:14.000
 around breathing in humans that I'm aware of

1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:15.380
 relates to these stress states

1:27:15.380 --> 1:27:17.300
 because they're a little bit easier to study in the lab,

1:27:17.300 --> 1:27:19.840
 whereas people feeling understimulated

1:27:19.840 --> 1:27:21.120
 or exhausted all the time,

1:27:21.120 --> 1:27:23.420
 it's a complicated thing to measure.

1:27:23.420 --> 1:27:25.120
 I mean, you can do it, but it's not as straightforward.

1:27:25.120 --> 1:27:27.000
 Well, CO2 is easier to measure.

1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:28.400
 But in terms of the sort of,

1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:32.000
 the measures for feeling fatigue,

1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:33.440
 they're somewhat indirect,

1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:36.500
 whereas stress, we can get at pulse rates in HRV

1:27:36.500 --> 1:27:37.340
 and things of that sort.

1:27:37.340 --> 1:27:41.200
 So imagine that these devices that we're all wearing

1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:42.640
 will soon be able to measure,

1:27:42.640 --> 1:27:45.820
 well, now they can measure oxygen levels, oxygen saturation.

1:27:45.820 --> 1:27:46.840
 Which is amazing.

1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:47.680
 Yeah.

1:27:48.580 --> 1:27:52.960
 But oxins will pretty much stay above 90%

1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:57.520
 unless there's some pathology or you go to altitude.

1:27:57.520 --> 1:28:00.560
 But CO2 levels vary quite a bit.

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:05.440
 And in fact, because they vary, your body is so sensitive,

1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:06.880
 the control of breathing,

1:28:06.880 --> 1:28:09.160
 like how much you breathe per minute,

1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:14.120
 is determined in a very sensitive way by the CO2 level.

1:28:14.120 --> 1:28:17.240
 So even a small change in your CO2

1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:20.400
 will have a significant effect on your ventilation.

1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:23.320
 So this is another thing that not only changes

1:28:23.320 --> 1:28:26.560
 your ventilation, but affects your brain state.

1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:30.120
 Now, another thing that could affect breathing,

1:28:30.120 --> 1:28:32.820
 how breathing practice can affect your emotional state

1:28:32.820 --> 1:28:36.400
 is simply the descending command.

1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:39.400
 Because breathing practice involves volitional control

1:28:39.400 --> 1:28:41.480
 of your breathing.

1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:44.280
 And therefore, there's a signal that's originating

1:28:44.280 --> 1:28:46.200
 somewhere in your motor cortex.

1:28:46.200 --> 1:28:48.620
 That is not, of course, that's gonna go down

1:28:48.620 --> 1:28:50.120
 to pre-Butzinger.

1:28:50.120 --> 1:28:53.680
 But it's also gonna send off collaterals to other places.

1:28:53.680 --> 1:28:55.680
 Those collaterals could obviously influence

1:28:55.680 --> 1:28:56.780
 your emotional state.

1:28:57.920 --> 1:29:01.720
 So we have quite a few different potential sources.

1:29:01.720 --> 1:29:03.400
 None of them are exclusive.

1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:07.040
 And there's an interesting paper which shows

1:29:07.040 --> 1:29:11.920
 that if you block nasal breathing,

1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:16.080
 you still see breathing-related oscillations in the brain.

1:29:16.080 --> 1:29:21.080
 And this is where I think the mechanism is occurring,

1:29:21.400 --> 1:29:25.380
 is that these breathing-related oscillations in the brain,

1:29:26.240 --> 1:29:28.800
 they are playing a role in signal processing.

1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:31.520
 And maybe, should I talk a little bit about the role

1:29:31.520 --> 1:29:34.160
 that oscillations may be playing in signal processing?

1:29:34.160 --> 1:29:35.820
 Definitely, but before you do,

1:29:35.820 --> 1:29:39.920
 I just want to ask you a intermediate question.

1:29:39.920 --> 1:29:41.560
 We've talked a lot about inhalation,

1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:43.560
 inspiration, and exhalation.

1:29:44.540 --> 1:29:46.440
 What about breath holds?

1:29:46.440 --> 1:29:48.760
 You know, in apnea, for instance,

1:29:48.760 --> 1:29:50.120
 people are holding their breath,

1:29:50.120 --> 1:29:53.780
 whether or not it's conscious or unconscious,

1:29:53.780 --> 1:29:55.320
 they're holding their breath.

1:29:55.320 --> 1:29:57.680
 What's known about breath holds

1:29:57.680 --> 1:29:59.960
 in terms of how it might interact with brain state

1:29:59.960 --> 1:30:01.880
 or oxygen CO2?

1:30:01.880 --> 1:30:04.560
 And I'm particularly interested in how breath holds

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:07.840
 with lungs empty versus breath holds with lungs full

1:30:07.840 --> 1:30:10.240
 might differ in terms of their impact on the brain.

1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:12.160
 I'm not aware of any studies on this,

1:30:13.360 --> 1:30:14.960
 looking at a mechanistic level,

1:30:14.960 --> 1:30:16.480
 but I find it really interesting.

1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:18.840
 And even if there are no studies,

1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:20.680
 I'd love it if you'd care to speculate.

1:30:20.680 --> 1:30:23.440
 Well, one of the breath practices that intrigued me

1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:27.440
 is where you basically hyperventilate for a minute

1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:29.480
 and then hold your breath for as long as you can.

1:30:29.480 --> 1:30:31.360
 Tummo style, Wim Hof style,

1:30:31.360 --> 1:30:33.760
 or we call it in the laboratory

1:30:33.760 --> 1:30:36.980
 because frankly, before Tummo and before Wim,

1:30:39.720 --> 1:30:43.020
 it was referred to as cyclic hyperventilation.

1:30:43.020 --> 1:30:46.440
 So it was basically, right, followed by a breath hold.

1:30:46.440 --> 1:30:47.920
 And that breath hold could be done with lungs full

1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:49.200
 or lungs empty.

1:30:49.200 --> 1:30:52.980
 So I had a long talk with some colleagues

1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:57.520
 about what they might think the underlying mechanisms are,

1:30:57.520 --> 1:30:59.760
 particularly for the breath hold.

1:30:59.760 --> 1:31:04.760
 And I certainly envision that there's a component

1:31:05.960 --> 1:31:10.120
 with respect to the presence or absence of that rhythmicity

1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:12.600
 in your cortex which is having effect.

1:31:12.600 --> 1:31:15.400
 But the other thing with the hyperventilation,

1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:17.520
 hypoventilation, or the apnea,

1:31:18.720 --> 1:31:23.400
 is your CO2 levels are going from low to high.

1:31:23.400 --> 1:31:24.760
 Anytime you're holding your breath.

1:31:24.760 --> 1:31:26.920
 Anytime you're holding your breath, okay.

1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:29.600
 And those are gonna have a profound influence.

1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:34.600
 Now, I have to talk about episodic hypoxia.

1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:38.060
 Of course, there's a lot of work going on,

1:31:38.060 --> 1:31:39.400
 particularly with Gordon Mitchell

1:31:39.400 --> 1:31:40.360
 at the University of Florida

1:31:40.360 --> 1:31:44.800
 is doing some extraordinary work on episodic hypoxia.

1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:47.480
 So in the 80s, David Millhorn

1:31:48.600 --> 1:31:50.800
 did some really intriguing work.

1:31:51.680 --> 1:31:55.680
 If I ask you to hold your breath, excuse me,

1:31:55.680 --> 1:32:00.680
 if I gave you a low oxygen mixture for a couple of minutes,

1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:03.320
 your breathing level would go up

1:32:03.320 --> 1:32:05.160
 because you wanna have more oxygen.

1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:06.840
 You're starving for air, yeah.

1:32:06.840 --> 1:32:08.840
 No, you're starving for oxygen, okay.

1:32:10.960 --> 1:32:13.600
 And for a couple of minutes, you'd go up,

1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:16.280
 you'd reach some steady state level.

1:32:16.280 --> 1:32:19.680
 Not so hypoxic that you can't reach an equilibrium.

1:32:19.680 --> 1:32:21.920
 And then I give you room there again,

1:32:21.920 --> 1:32:26.520
 your ventilation quickly relaxes back down to normal.

1:32:26.520 --> 1:32:30.960
 If on the other hand, I gave you three minutes of hypoxia,

1:32:30.960 --> 1:32:33.160
 five minutes of normoxia,

1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:36.080
 three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia,

1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:38.120
 three minutes of hypoxia, five minutes of normoxia.

1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:39.160
 Normoxia being normal.

1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:40.480
 Normal, normal air.

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:45.120
 Your ventilation goes up, down, up, down, up, down.

1:32:45.120 --> 1:32:49.400
 After the last episode, your breathing comes down

1:32:49.400 --> 1:32:52.400
 and doesn't continue to come down but rises again

1:32:52.400 --> 1:32:55.400
 and stays up for hours, okay.

1:32:56.360 --> 1:32:58.720
 This is well validated now.

1:32:58.720 --> 1:33:00.200
 This was originally done in animals

1:33:00.200 --> 1:33:01.640
 but in humans all the time.

1:33:01.640 --> 1:33:04.560
 It seems to have profound benefit

1:33:04.560 --> 1:33:08.200
 on motor function and cognitive function.

1:33:08.200 --> 1:33:09.320
 In what direction?

1:33:09.320 --> 1:33:11.640
 Positive, positive.

1:33:11.640 --> 1:33:14.240
 I've often toyed with the idea of getting a 5%,

1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:17.360
 an 8% oxygen, don't do this listeners,

1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:22.360
 getting an 8% oxygen tank by my desk when I'm writing a grant

1:33:22.680 --> 1:33:24.400
 and doing like in Blue Velvet

1:33:24.400 --> 1:33:28.160
 and going through the episodic hypoxia

1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:30.320
 to improve my cognitive function

1:33:30.320 --> 1:33:31.720
 because certainly I could use improvement

1:33:31.720 --> 1:33:32.760
 when I'm writing grants.

1:33:32.760 --> 1:33:35.880
 But you could do this without the low oxygen.

1:33:35.880 --> 1:33:38.040
 I mean, you could do this through breath work presumably.

1:33:38.040 --> 1:33:42.360
 It's hard to lower your oxygen enough, okay.

1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:44.560
 We're going in the experimental studies,

1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:47.080
 they typically use 8% oxygen.

1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:49.200
 It's hard to hold your breath long enough.

1:33:50.200 --> 1:33:53.200
 And there is another difference here

1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:56.360
 that is what's happening to your CO2 levels.

1:33:56.360 --> 1:33:58.200
 When you hold your breath,

1:33:58.200 --> 1:33:59.360
 your oxygen levels are dropping,

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:01.640
 your CO2 levels are going up.

1:34:01.640 --> 1:34:06.320
 When you're doing episodic hypoxia,

1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:10.080
 your CO2 levels are gonna stay pretty normal

1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:12.280
 because you're still breathing,

1:34:12.280 --> 1:34:13.800
 it's just the oxygen levels are gone.

1:34:13.800 --> 1:34:16.560
 So unlike normal conditions which you described before

1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:19.560
 where oxygen is relatively constant

1:34:19.560 --> 1:34:22.520
 and CO2 is fluctuating depending on emotional state

1:34:22.520 --> 1:34:24.400
 and activity and things of that sort,

1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:29.000
 in episodic hypoxia, CO2 is relatively constant

1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:30.680
 but you're varying the oxygen level

1:34:30.680 --> 1:34:32.320
 coming into the system quite a bit.

1:34:32.320 --> 1:34:33.560
 I would say it's relatively,

1:34:33.560 --> 1:34:36.920
 I would say CO2 is relatively constant

1:34:36.920 --> 1:34:40.320
 but it's not going to go in a direction

1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:43.720
 which is gonna be significantly far from normal.

1:34:43.720 --> 1:34:45.760
 Whereas when you're holding your breath,

1:34:45.760 --> 1:34:47.400
 you're gonna become both hypoxic

1:34:47.400 --> 1:34:49.520
 and hypo-capnic at the same time.

1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:50.440
 We should explain to people

1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:52.120
 what hypoxic and hypo-capnic are

1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:52.960
 because we haven't done that.

1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:56.520
 Hypoxic is just a technical term for low levels of oxygen.

1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:00.080
 Or you could say hypoxic, low, hyper is high.

1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:03.880
 So hyperoxia or hypo-capnia, low CO2

1:35:03.880 --> 1:35:06.680
 or hyper-capnia, highest levels of CO2.

1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:13.880
 So when you're in episodic hypoxia,

1:35:13.880 --> 1:35:16.560
 if anything you're gonna become hypo-capnic

1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:18.360
 not hyper-capnic.

1:35:18.360 --> 1:35:20.840
 And that could play an influence on this.

1:35:20.840 --> 1:35:23.840
 One example that I remember

1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:25.160
 and Gordon will have to forgive me

1:35:25.160 --> 1:35:27.120
 if I'm misquoting this,

1:35:27.120 --> 1:35:32.120
 is they had a patient who had a stroke

1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:36.160
 and had weakness in ankle flexion.

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:41.160
 That is, excuse me, ankle extension to extend the ankle.

1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:43.920
 And so they had the patient in a seat

1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:46.520
 where they can measure ankle extension.

1:35:46.520 --> 1:35:48.880
 And then they measured it.

1:35:48.880 --> 1:35:53.000
 And then they exposed the patient to episodic hypoxia.

1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:53.920
 And they measured again,

1:35:53.920 --> 1:35:58.680
 the strength of the ankle extension went way up.

1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:00.680
 And so Gordon is looking at this.

1:36:00.680 --> 1:36:03.880
 They're looking at this now for spinal cord rehab.

1:36:03.880 --> 1:36:07.920
 And I imagine for all sorts of neuromuscular performance,

1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:09.440
 it could be beneficial.

1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:12.440
 Gordon is looking into athletic performance.

1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:14.520
 We have a project which we haven't been able

1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:18.360
 to push to the next level to do golf.

1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:19.320
 So I think-

1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:20.160
 Why golf?

1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:21.440
 Because you love golf.

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:25.720
 Well, it's because it's motor performance, coordination.

1:36:25.720 --> 1:36:28.680
 So it's not simply running as fast as you can.

1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:30.680
 It's coordination, it's concentration.

1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:32.640
 It's a whole variety of things.

1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:36.080
 And so the idea would be to get a group of golfers

1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:39.520
 and give them their placebo controls.

1:36:39.520 --> 1:36:41.840
 They don't know whether they're breathing a gas mixture,

1:36:41.840 --> 1:36:45.560
 which is just normal air or hypoxic gas mixture,

1:36:45.560 --> 1:36:47.120
 although they may be able to figure it out

1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:48.400
 based on their response.

1:36:49.760 --> 1:36:51.560
 Do it under controlled circumstances,

1:36:51.560 --> 1:36:53.320
 then do it into a net.

1:36:53.320 --> 1:36:55.520
 Measure their length of their drives,

1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:58.560
 their dispersion and whatnot, and see what happens.

1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:03.120
 Look, if we could find that this works for golfers,

1:37:03.120 --> 1:37:05.440
 forget about cognitive function.

1:37:05.440 --> 1:37:09.440
 We could sell this for unbelievable amounts of money.

1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:11.280
 That sounds like a terrible idea.

1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:16.080
 By the way, I'm not serious about selling it.

1:37:16.080 --> 1:37:17.200
 I know you're joking.

1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:19.280
 Maybe people should know that you are joking by that.

1:37:19.280 --> 1:37:22.360
 No, I think that anything that can improve cognitive

1:37:22.360 --> 1:37:24.320
 and neuromuscular performance is going to be of interest

1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:28.000
 for a wide range of both pathologic states

1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.200
 like injury, TBI, et cetera.

1:37:30.200 --> 1:37:33.200
 I mean, one of the most frequent questions I get

1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:37.160
 is about recovery from concussion or traumatic brain injury.

1:37:37.160 --> 1:37:39.200
 A lot of people think sports, they think football,

1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:41.040
 they think rugby, they think hockey,

1:37:41.040 --> 1:37:44.520
 but if you look at the statistics on traumatic brain injury,

1:37:44.520 --> 1:37:46.800
 most of it is construction workers,

1:37:46.800 --> 1:37:48.800
 car crashes, bicycle accidents.

1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:52.720
 I mean, the sports part of it is a tiny, tiny,

1:37:52.720 --> 1:37:54.600
 minuscule fraction of the total amount

1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:56.360
 of traumatic brain injury out there.

1:37:57.520 --> 1:37:59.880
 I think these protocols tested in the context of golf

1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:01.120
 would be very interesting

1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:02.960
 because of the constraints of the measures

1:38:02.960 --> 1:38:04.920
 as you mentioned, and it could be exported

1:38:04.920 --> 1:38:05.840
 to a number of things.

1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:08.940
 I want to just try and imagine whether or not

1:38:08.940 --> 1:38:13.940
 there is any kind of breathing patterned or breath work,

1:38:14.320 --> 1:38:15.760
 just to be direct about it,

1:38:15.760 --> 1:38:19.480
 that even partially mimics what you described

1:38:19.480 --> 1:38:21.500
 in terms of episodic hypoxia.

1:38:21.500 --> 1:38:23.120
 I've done a lot of Tummo, Wim Hof,

1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:25.080
 cyclic hyperventilation type breathing before.

1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:26.600
 My lab studies this in humans,

1:38:26.600 --> 1:38:29.000
 and what we find is that

1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.820
 if people do cyclic hyperventilation,

1:38:30.820 --> 1:38:33.420
 so for about a minute, then exhale, hold their breath

1:38:33.420 --> 1:38:36.240
 for 15 to 60 seconds, depending on what they can do,

1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:38.960
 and just keep repeating that for about five minutes,

1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:42.360
 it seems to me that it at least partially mimics

1:38:42.360 --> 1:38:43.600
 the state that you're talking about.

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:46.640
 Because afterwards, people report heightened levels

1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:51.640
 of alertness, lower levels of kind of triggering

1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:54.520
 due to stressful events.

1:38:54.520 --> 1:38:56.020
 They feel comfortable at a higher level

1:38:56.020 --> 1:38:58.440
 of autonomic arousal, cognitive focus,

1:38:58.440 --> 1:39:00.720
 a number of improvements that are pretty impressive.

1:39:00.720 --> 1:39:02.600
 That any practitioner of Wim Hof or Tummo

1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:03.760
 will be familiar with.

1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:09.160
 Is that pattern of breathing even,

1:39:09.160 --> 1:39:11.520
 can we say that it maps to what you're describing

1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:12.920
 in some general sense?

1:39:14.400 --> 1:39:17.440
 Well, the expert in this would be Gordon Mitchell.

1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:20.640
 I would say it moves in that direction,

1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:22.200
 but it's not as extreme,

1:39:22.200 --> 1:39:23.720
 because I don't think you can get down

1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:28.360
 to the levels of hypoxia that they do clinically.

1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:32.040
 I know that our pals at our breath collective

1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:34.040
 actually just bought a machine,

1:39:34.040 --> 1:39:36.280
 because you buy a machine that does this,

1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:37.480
 and they bought it and they're going to do

1:39:37.480 --> 1:39:39.620
 their own self-testing to see whether or not

1:39:39.620 --> 1:39:42.960
 this has any effect on anything that they can measure.

1:39:42.960 --> 1:39:44.760
 Of course, you have to be concerned

1:39:44.760 --> 1:39:46.300
 about self-experimentation,

1:39:46.300 --> 1:39:50.960
 but I applaud their curiosity in going after it.

1:39:50.960 --> 1:39:52.640
 Hyperbaric chambers.

1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:55.040
 I hear a lot nowadays about hyperbaric chambers.

1:39:55.040 --> 1:39:56.520
 People are buying them and using them,

1:39:56.520 --> 1:39:59.360
 and what are your thoughts on hyperbaric chambers

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:00.440
 as it relates to any of the-

1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:01.640
 Hyper or hypo?

1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:03.080
 Hyperbaric chambers.

1:40:03.080 --> 1:40:04.360
 Okay, so you're not talking about altitude.

1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:05.840
 No.

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:08.320
 I don't really have much to say.

1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:12.340
 I mean, your oxygen levels will probably go up a little bit,

1:40:12.340 --> 1:40:14.320
 and that could have a beneficial effect,

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:17.400
 but that's way outside my area of confidence.

1:40:17.400 --> 1:40:20.720
 I think 2022, I think is going to be the year

1:40:20.720 --> 1:40:22.400
 of two things I keep hearing a lot about,

1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:25.880
 which is the deliberate use of high salt intake

1:40:25.880 --> 1:40:29.080
 for performance, increasing blood volume, et cetera,

1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:31.360
 and hyperbaric chambers seem to be catching on

1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:33.760
 much in the same way that ice baths were

1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:35.680
 and saunas seem to be right now.

1:40:35.680 --> 1:40:39.480
 But anyway, a prediction we can return to at some point.

1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:43.980
 I want to ask you about some of the studies

1:40:43.980 --> 1:40:46.540
 that I've seen out there exploring

1:40:46.540 --> 1:40:50.200
 how deliberately restricting one's breathing

1:40:50.200 --> 1:40:53.280
 to nasal breathing can do things like improve memory.

1:40:53.280 --> 1:40:55.240
 There's a couple of papers in Journal of Neuroscience,

1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:57.880
 which is a respectable journal in our field,

1:40:57.880 --> 1:40:59.500
 one looking at olfactory memory.

1:40:59.500 --> 1:41:02.640
 So that kind of made sense because you can smell things

1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:04.060
 better through your nose than your mouth,

1:41:04.060 --> 1:41:07.680
 unless you're some sort of elk or something

1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:10.240
 where they can, presumably they have some sense of smell

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:11.580
 in their mouth as well,

1:41:11.580 --> 1:41:13.840
 but humans generally smell with their nose.

1:41:13.840 --> 1:41:15.280
 That wasn't terribly surprising,

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:17.480
 but there was a companion study that showed

1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:21.120
 that the hippocampus, an area involved in encoding memories

1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:25.440
 in one form or another, was more active, if you will,

1:41:25.440 --> 1:41:28.600
 and memory and recall was better

1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:31.040
 when people learned information while nasal breathing

1:41:31.040 --> 1:41:32.280
 as opposed to mouth breathing.

1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:36.480
 Does that make sense from any mechanistic perspective?

1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:40.000
 Well, given that there's a major pathway

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.960
 going from the olfactory system into the brain

1:41:44.440 --> 1:41:47.120
 and you cut that,

1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:50.800
 and not one from any receptors in the mouth,

1:41:50.800 --> 1:41:53.040
 the degree of respiratory modulation

1:41:53.040 --> 1:41:56.480
 you're gonna see throughout the forebrain

1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:01.320
 is gonna be less with mouth breathing than nose breathing.

1:42:01.320 --> 1:42:05.220
 So it's certainly plausible.

1:42:13.080 --> 1:42:17.040
 I think there are a lot of experiments

1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:19.120
 that need to be done to distinguish

1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:23.440
 between the two, that is the nasal component

1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:25.140
 and the non-nasal component

1:42:25.140 --> 1:42:27.680
 of these breathing-related signals.

1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:31.760
 There's a tendency sometimes when you have a strong effect

1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:35.800
 to be exclusive, and I think what's going on here

1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:39.400
 is that there are many inputs that can have an effect.

1:42:39.400 --> 1:42:40.880
 Now, whether they're parceled,

1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:43.200
 that some affect this part of behavior

1:42:43.200 --> 1:42:44.760
 and some affect that part of behavior

1:42:44.760 --> 1:42:47.740
 remains to be investigated.

1:42:47.740 --> 1:42:50.720
 There's certainly a strong olfactory component.

1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:55.200
 My interest is trying to follow the central component

1:42:55.200 --> 1:42:58.360
 because we know that there's a strong central component.

1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:00.600
 In fact, there's a strong central projection

1:43:00.600 --> 1:43:02.740
 to the olfactory bulb.

1:43:02.740 --> 1:43:04.440
 So regardless of whether or not

1:43:04.440 --> 1:43:06.720
 there's any effluent in and out of the nose,

1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:09.720
 there's a respiratory input into the olfactory bulb,

1:43:09.720 --> 1:43:13.040
 which combines with the respiratory modulated signals

1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:15.280
 coming from the sensory receptors.

1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:16.280
 Interesting.

1:43:16.280 --> 1:43:20.880
 And as long as we are poking around, forgive the pun,

1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:25.880
 the nose, what about one nostril versus the other nostril?

1:43:26.560 --> 1:43:28.700
 I know it sounds a little crazy to imagine,

1:43:28.700 --> 1:43:31.680
 but there have been theories in yogic traditions

1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:34.320
 and others that breathing through one nostril

1:43:35.720 --> 1:43:37.500
 somehow activates certain brain centers,

1:43:37.500 --> 1:43:40.040
 maybe hemispherically one side of the brain versus the other,

1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:42.480
 or that right nostril and left nostril breathing

1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:46.440
 might differ in terms of the levels of alertness

1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:48.080
 or calmness they produce.

1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:50.240
 I'm not aware of any mechanistic data on that,

1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:52.920
 but if there's anything worthwhile

1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:56.080
 about right nostril versus left nostril breathing

1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:57.520
 that you're aware of, I'd love to know.

1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:00.520
 Well, it's certainly plausible.

1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:02.800
 I don't know of any data demonstrating it

1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:04.780
 except the anecdotal reports.

1:44:06.760 --> 1:44:09.840
 As you know, the brain is highly lateralized

1:44:09.840 --> 1:44:12.760
 and we have speech on one side

1:44:12.760 --> 1:44:16.480
 and a dominant hand is on one side.

1:44:16.480 --> 1:44:20.320
 And so the notion that if you have this huge signal

1:44:20.320 --> 1:44:22.840
 coming from the olfactory system

1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:25.120
 and to some degree it's lateralized,

1:44:25.120 --> 1:44:26.600
 it's not perfectly symmetrical,

1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:31.000
 that is one side is not going evenly to both sides,

1:44:31.000 --> 1:44:35.520
 then you can imagine that once the signal gets distributed

1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:39.340
 in a way that's not uniform,

1:44:39.340 --> 1:44:41.860
 that the effectiveness or the response

1:44:41.860 --> 1:44:44.620
 is gonna be particular to the cortex

1:44:44.620 --> 1:44:48.700
 in which either the signal still remains

1:44:48.700 --> 1:44:50.600
 or the signal is removed from.

1:44:50.600 --> 1:44:51.440
 I see.

1:44:52.380 --> 1:44:56.840
 What are some of the other features of our brain and body,

1:44:56.840 --> 1:44:59.740
 be it blinking or eye movements

1:44:59.740 --> 1:45:03.800
 or ability to encode sounds

1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:08.380
 or any features of the way that we function

1:45:08.380 --> 1:45:10.200
 and move and perceive things

1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:15.080
 that are coordinated with breathing in some interesting way?

1:45:15.080 --> 1:45:16.480
 Thank you for that question.

1:45:18.720 --> 1:45:19.780
 Almost everything.

1:45:20.760 --> 1:45:24.360
 So we have, for example, on the autonomic side,

1:45:24.360 --> 1:45:26.880
 we have respiratory sinus arrhythmia,

1:45:26.880 --> 1:45:30.220
 that is during expiration, the heart slows down.

1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:34.180
 Your pupils oscillate with the respiratory cycle.

1:45:35.140 --> 1:45:37.640
 I don't know what the functional basis for that is,

1:45:37.640 --> 1:45:40.040
 but they do oscillate with the respiratory cycle.

1:45:40.040 --> 1:45:42.400
 When we inhale, our pupils constrict, presumably,

1:45:42.400 --> 1:45:44.520
 because there's an increase in heart rate

1:45:44.520 --> 1:45:46.800
 and sympathetic tone, I would think of constriction.

1:45:46.800 --> 1:45:48.540
 And I'm guessing as you relax,

1:45:48.540 --> 1:45:50.040
 the people will get, and you exhale,

1:45:50.040 --> 1:45:51.200
 the people wouldn't go. I think you're right,

1:45:51.200 --> 1:45:54.560
 but I always get the valence of that.

1:45:54.560 --> 1:45:55.880
 Well, it's counterintuitive

1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:58.480
 because people wouldn't think that when the pupils get,

1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:00.760
 I mean, it depends.

1:46:00.760 --> 1:46:03.480
 I mean, you can get very alert and aroused

1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:06.520
 and that for stress or for good reasons,

1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:09.640
 and the pupils get wider, but your visual field narrows,

1:46:09.640 --> 1:46:10.760
 and then the opposite is true.

1:46:10.760 --> 1:46:12.920
 Anyway, I guess the idea is that the pupils

1:46:12.920 --> 1:46:15.480
 are changing size and therefore the aperture

1:46:15.480 --> 1:46:17.960
 of your visual window is changing

1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:19.800
 in coordination with breathing.

1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:24.800
 Your fear response changes with the respiratory cycle.

1:46:25.240 --> 1:46:26.560
 Tell us more about that.

1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:29.320
 Well, there's a paper by Zolano,

1:46:29.320 --> 1:46:31.240
 which I think showed rather clearly

1:46:31.240 --> 1:46:36.800
 that if you show individuals fearful faces,

1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:43.920
 that their measured response of fearfulness

1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:46.760
 changes between inspiration and expiration.

1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:50.560
 You know, I don't know why, but it does.

1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:55.560
 Your reaction time changes.

1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:58.120
 So you talk about blinking,

1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:02.040
 the reaction time changes between inspiration and expiration.

1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:04.920
 If I asked you to punch something,

1:47:04.920 --> 1:47:08.560
 that time will change between inspiration and expiration.

1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:10.480
 In fact, I don't know the degree

1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:12.400
 to which martial artists exploit that.

1:47:12.400 --> 1:47:14.040
 You know, you watch the breathing pattern

1:47:14.040 --> 1:47:18.200
 and your opponent will actually move slower

1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:20.960
 during one cycle compared to the other.

1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:23.920
 Meaning as they're, in which direction?

1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:26.160
 If they're exhaling, they can punch faster?

1:47:26.160 --> 1:47:29.240
 I have to say, I don't keep a table

1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:31.440
 of which direction things move in

1:47:31.440 --> 1:47:34.640
 because I'm out of the martial arts field now.

1:47:34.640 --> 1:47:39.640
 My vague understanding is that exhales on strikes

1:47:39.880 --> 1:47:43.800
 is the more typical way to do that.

1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:48.120
 And so as people strike, they exhale.

1:47:48.120 --> 1:47:50.880
 No, as you exhale.

1:47:50.880 --> 1:47:53.760
 But there are other components to striking

1:47:53.760 --> 1:47:57.320
 because you want to stiffen your rib cage,

1:47:57.320 --> 1:47:58.760
 you want to make a valsalva maneuver.

1:47:58.760 --> 1:48:01.520
 So that's, you know, both an inspiration

1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:03.600
 and an expiration, it's at the same time.

1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:08.600
 So I don't know enough about when you say during expiration,

1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:11.960
 I would assume that when you make your strike,

1:48:11.960 --> 1:48:14.280
 you actually sort of want to stiffen here,

1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:16.360
 which is a valsalva-like maneuver.

1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:19.360
 And oftentimes they'll clench their fist at the last moment.

1:48:19.360 --> 1:48:22.120
 Anyway, there's a whole set of motor things there

1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:24.320
 that we can talk to some fighters.

1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:27.640
 We know people who know fighters, so we can ask them.

1:48:27.640 --> 1:48:30.000
 Interesting, what are some other things

1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:31.760
 that are modulated by breathing?

1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:37.240
 You know, I think anything anyone looks at

1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:39.720
 seems to have a breathing component

1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:43.960
 because it's all over your brain.

1:48:43.960 --> 1:48:47.080
 And it's hard to imagine it not being effective.

1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:49.760
 Now, whether it's incidental

1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:53.640
 or just background and doesn't really have

1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:58.640
 any behavioral advantage is possible.

1:48:58.960 --> 1:49:01.000
 In other cases, it might have a behavioral advantage.

1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:06.000
 I mean, the big, this eye-opening thing for me

1:49:06.360 --> 1:49:10.640
 probably a decade ago was digging into literature

1:49:10.640 --> 1:49:15.640
 and seeing how much of cortical activity

1:49:15.920 --> 1:49:17.440
 and subcortical activity

1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:20.480
 had a respiratory modulated component to it.

1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:24.720
 And I think a lot of my colleagues who are studying cortex

1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:26.960
 are oblivious to this.

1:49:27.800 --> 1:49:32.000
 And they find, I heard a talk the other day

1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:33.720
 of a person who'll go unnamed,

1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:36.680
 who find a lot of things correlated

1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:39.640
 with a particular movement.

1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:43.000
 And I think it all, when I looked, I said,

1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.200
 gee, that's a list of things that are respiratory modulated.

1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:48.360
 And rather than it being correlated

1:49:48.360 --> 1:49:50.520
 to the movement they were looking at,

1:49:50.520 --> 1:49:52.920
 I think the movement they were looking at

1:49:52.920 --> 1:49:56.040
 was modulated by breathing, as was everything else.

1:49:56.040 --> 1:49:58.280
 So there wasn't that the movement itself

1:49:58.280 --> 1:49:59.880
 was driving that correlation,

1:49:59.880 --> 1:50:02.440
 it was that they were all correlated to something else,

1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:04.080
 which is the breathing movement.

1:50:04.080 --> 1:50:07.680
 And whether or not that is a behaviorally relevant

1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:11.600
 or behaviorally something you can exploit, I don't know.

1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:16.480
 I suspect you're right, that breathing is, if not the,

1:50:16.480 --> 1:50:20.120
 foundational driver of many, if not all of these things,

1:50:20.120 --> 1:50:22.320
 that it's at least one of the foundational drivers.

1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:24.520
 It's in the background, it's in the brain,

1:50:24.520 --> 1:50:29.520
 and oscillations play an important part in brain function.

1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:35.000
 And they vary in frequency from maybe a hundred hertz

1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:40.000
 down to, well, we can get to circadian

1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.720
 and sort of monthly cycles.

1:50:42.720 --> 1:50:47.720
 But breathing occupies a rather unusual place in all that

1:50:47.920 --> 1:50:51.480
 because, so let me talk about what people think

1:50:51.480 --> 1:50:54.440
 the oscillations are doing, particularly the faster ones.

1:50:54.440 --> 1:50:59.160
 They're important in coordinating signals across neurons.

1:51:00.320 --> 1:51:03.480
 Just like in a computer, a computer steps.

1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:06.240
 So a computer knows when information is coming

1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:08.160
 from another part of a computer

1:51:08.160 --> 1:51:11.880
 that it was originated at a particular time.

1:51:11.880 --> 1:51:14.480
 And so that discrete step-by-step thing

1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:16.000
 is important in computer control.

1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.280
 Now the brain is not a digital device,

1:51:18.280 --> 1:51:19.960
 it's an analog device.

1:51:19.960 --> 1:51:24.840
 But when I have a signal that coming in my ear and my eye,

1:51:24.840 --> 1:51:26.840
 which is Andrew Huberman speaking,

1:51:26.840 --> 1:51:30.360
 and I'm looking at his face, I see that as a whole,

1:51:30.360 --> 1:51:33.000
 but the signal is coming into different parts of my brain.

1:51:33.000 --> 1:51:34.760
 How do I unify that?

1:51:34.760 --> 1:51:38.480
 Well, my neurons are very sensitive to changes

1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:41.960
 in signals arriving by fractions of a millisecond.

1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:44.960
 So how do I assure that those signals coming in

1:51:44.960 --> 1:51:47.240
 represent the same signal?

1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:50.680
 Well, if I have throughout my brain an oscillation

1:51:50.680 --> 1:51:53.920
 and the signals ride on that oscillation,

1:51:53.920 --> 1:51:55.880
 let's say the peak of the oscillation,

1:51:55.880 --> 1:51:59.560
 I can then have a much better handle on the road of timing

1:51:59.560 --> 1:52:03.040
 and say those two signals came in at the same time,

1:52:03.040 --> 1:52:04.920
 they may relate to the same object,

1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:08.720
 and aha, I see you as one unified thing spouting,

1:52:08.720 --> 1:52:10.520
 you know, talking.

1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:15.320
 And so these oscillations come in many different frequency

1:52:15.320 --> 1:52:18.800
 ranges and are important in memory formation

1:52:18.800 --> 1:52:21.040
 and all sorts of things.

1:52:21.040 --> 1:52:23.160
 I don't think people pay much attention to breathing

1:52:23.160 --> 1:52:27.840
 because it's relatively slow to this, the range when you

1:52:27.840 --> 1:52:30.440
 think about milliseconds.

1:52:30.440 --> 1:52:33.880
 But we have important things that

1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:36.720
 are thought to be important in cognitive function, which

1:52:36.720 --> 1:52:42.440
 are a few cycles per second to 20, 30, 40, 50 cycles per second.

1:52:42.440 --> 1:52:46.600
 Breathing in humans is maybe 0.2 cycles per second,

1:52:46.600 --> 1:52:49.760
 every five seconds, although in rodents,

1:52:49.760 --> 1:52:54.360
 they're up to four per second, which is pretty fast.

1:52:54.360 --> 1:52:57.840
 But breathing has one thing which is special.

1:52:57.840 --> 1:53:00.440
 That is, you can readily change it.

1:53:00.440 --> 1:53:02.600
 So the degree to which the brain is

1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:06.320
 using that slow signal for anything,

1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:11.200
 if that becomes part of its normal signal processing,

1:53:11.200 --> 1:53:17.000
 you now change it, that signal processing has to change.

1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:20.360
 And as that signal processing changes,

1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:23.320
 acutely there's a change.

1:53:23.320 --> 1:53:26.360
 So, you know, you asked about breath practice,

1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:28.080
 how long do you have to do it?

1:53:28.080 --> 1:53:31.720
 Well, a single breath will change your state.

1:53:31.720 --> 1:53:36.080
 You know, you're nervous, you take a deep breath,

1:53:36.080 --> 1:53:38.440
 and it seems to help relax.

1:53:38.440 --> 1:53:41.160
 Or sigh.

1:53:41.160 --> 1:53:42.400
 Call it what you will.

1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:43.320
 Call it what you will.

1:53:45.920 --> 1:53:47.280
 It seems to work.

1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:50.160
 Now, it doesn't have a permanent change,

1:53:50.160 --> 1:53:51.920
 but, you know, when I'm getting up to bat

1:53:51.920 --> 1:53:54.520
 or getting up to the first tea or getting to give a big talk

1:53:54.520 --> 1:53:58.840
 or coming to do a podcast, get a little bit anxious,

1:53:58.840 --> 1:54:00.840
 a deep breath or a few deep breaths

1:54:00.840 --> 1:54:05.080
 are tremendously effective in calming one down.

1:54:05.080 --> 1:54:10.560
 And so you can get a transient disruption.

1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:15.520
 But on the other hand, let's take something

1:54:15.520 --> 1:54:18.640
 like depression.

1:54:18.640 --> 1:54:21.720
 I think you can envision depression

1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:25.560
 as activity sort of going around in a circuit.

1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:29.240
 And because it's continuous in the nervous system

1:54:29.240 --> 1:54:34.400
 as signals keep repeating, they tend to get stronger.

1:54:34.400 --> 1:54:37.440
 And they can get so strong, you can't break them.

1:54:37.440 --> 1:54:40.600
 So you can imagine depression being something

1:54:40.600 --> 1:54:44.000
 going on and on and on, and you can't break it.

1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.360
 And so we have trouble when we get

1:54:46.360 --> 1:54:47.800
 to certain levels of depression.

1:54:47.800 --> 1:54:50.240
 I mean, all of us get depressed at some point.

1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:53.600
 But if it's not continuous, it's not long-lasting,

1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:55.280
 we're able to break it.

1:54:55.280 --> 1:54:58.400
 But if it's long-lasting and very deep, we can't break it.

1:54:58.400 --> 1:55:00.760
 So the question is, how do we break it?

1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:03.240
 Well, there are extreme measures to break it.

1:55:03.240 --> 1:55:06.360
 We could do electroconvulsive shock.

1:55:06.360 --> 1:55:08.040
 We shock the whole brain.

1:55:08.040 --> 1:55:10.480
 That's disrupting activity in the whole brain.

1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:14.560
 And when the circuit starts to get back together again,

1:55:14.560 --> 1:55:15.680
 it's been disruptive.

1:55:15.680 --> 1:55:18.560
 And we know that the brain, when signals

1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:22.680
 get disrupted a little bit, we can weaken the connections.

1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:24.280
 And weakening the connections, if it's

1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:26.680
 then in the circuit involved in depression,

1:55:26.680 --> 1:55:27.840
 we may get some relief.

1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:30.800
 And electroconvulsive shock does work

1:55:30.800 --> 1:55:33.400
 for relieving many kinds of depression.

1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:35.600
 That's pretty heroic.

1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:39.880
 Focal deep brain stimulation does the same thing,

1:55:39.880 --> 1:55:43.640
 but more localized, or transcranial stimulation.

1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:45.480
 You're disrupting a network.

1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:47.600
 And while it's getting back together,

1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:51.000
 it may weaken some of the connections.

1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:56.360
 If breathing is playing some role in this circuit,

1:55:56.360 --> 1:56:00.800
 and now instead of doing like a one-second shock,

1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:04.560
 I do 30 minutes of disruption by doing slow breathing

1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:09.400
 or other breathing practice, those circuits

1:56:09.400 --> 1:56:12.160
 begin to break down a little bit.

1:56:12.160 --> 1:56:13.240
 And I get some relief.

1:56:13.240 --> 1:56:17.120
 And if I continue to do it before the circuit can then

1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:20.720
 build back up again, I gradually can wear that circuit down.

1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:22.720
 I sort of liken this.

1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:25.720
 I tell people it's like walking around on a dirt path.

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:29.440
 You build a rut, the rut gets so deep you can't get out of it.

1:56:29.440 --> 1:56:31.760
 And what breathing is doing is sort of filling in the rut

1:56:31.760 --> 1:56:35.720
 bit by bit to the point that you can climb out of that rut.

1:56:35.720 --> 1:56:40.360
 And that is because breathing, the breathing signal

1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:45.160
 is playing some role in the way the circuit works.

1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:47.560
 And then when you disrupt it, the circuit

1:56:47.560 --> 1:56:49.720
 gets a little thrown off kilter.

1:56:49.720 --> 1:56:54.280
 And as you know, when circuits get thrown off,

1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:57.640
 the nervous system tries to adjust in some way or another.

1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:01.080
 And it turns out, at least for breathing,

1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:04.480
 for some evolutionary reason or just by happenstance,

1:57:04.480 --> 1:57:06.800
 it seems to improve our emotional function

1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:08.520
 or our cognitive function.

1:57:08.520 --> 1:57:13.080
 And we're very fortunate that that's the case.

1:57:13.080 --> 1:57:17.000
 It's a terrific segue into what I want to ask you next.

1:57:17.000 --> 1:57:20.400
 And this is part of a set of questions

1:57:20.400 --> 1:57:23.920
 I want to make sure we touch on before we wrap up,

1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:27.800
 which is what do you do with all this knowledge

1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:30.680
 in terms of a breathing practice?

1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:33.080
 You mentioned that one breath can shift your brain state

1:57:33.080 --> 1:57:35.000
 and that itself can be powerful.

1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:37.200
 I think that's absolutely true.

1:57:37.200 --> 1:57:40.080
 You've also talked about 30 minute breath work practices,

1:57:40.080 --> 1:57:41.520
 which is 30 minutes of breath work

1:57:41.520 --> 1:57:46.520
 is a pretty serious commitment, I think, but it's doable.

1:57:47.320 --> 1:57:52.320
 Certainly a zero cost except for the time in most cases.

1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:55.480
 What do you see out there in the landscape of breath work

1:57:55.480 --> 1:57:59.840
 that's being done that you like and why do you like it?

1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:05.400
 What do you think or what would you like to see more of

1:58:05.400 --> 1:58:09.040
 in terms of exploration of breath work and what do you do?

1:58:09.040 --> 1:58:14.040
 Well, I'm a relatively new convert to breath work.

1:58:14.520 --> 1:58:17.680
 Through my own investigation of it,

1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:20.440
 I became convinced that it's real.

1:58:20.440 --> 1:58:25.440
 And I'm basically a beginner in terms of my own practice.

1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:30.080
 And I like to keep things simple.

1:58:30.080 --> 1:58:33.120
 And I think I've discussed this before.

1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:35.640
 I liken it to someone who's a couch potato

1:58:35.640 --> 1:58:38.880
 who's told they got to begin to have a

1:58:38.880 --> 1:58:42.080
 to exercise, you don't go out and run a marathon.

1:58:42.080 --> 1:58:44.240
 So, couch potato, you say,

1:58:44.240 --> 1:58:47.000
 okay, get up and walk for five minutes and 10 minutes.

1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:49.880
 And then, okay, now you're walking for a longer period,

1:58:49.880 --> 1:58:50.880
 you begin to run.

1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:54.040
 And then you reach a point and say,

1:58:54.040 --> 1:58:57.000
 well, gee, I'm interested in this sport.

1:58:57.000 --> 1:58:59.320
 And there may be particular kinds of practices

1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:01.720
 that you can use that could be helpful

1:59:01.720 --> 1:59:04.840
 in optimizing performance at that sport.

1:59:04.840 --> 1:59:06.400
 I'm not there yet.

1:59:06.400 --> 1:59:11.400
 I find I get tremendous benefit by relatively short periods

1:59:11.680 --> 1:59:16.680
 between five and maybe 20 minutes of doing box breathing.

1:59:18.200 --> 1:59:20.280
 It's very simple to do.

1:59:20.280 --> 1:59:24.840
 I have a simple app which helps me keep the timing.

1:59:24.840 --> 1:59:25.960
 Do you recall which app it is?

1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:27.520
 Is it the Apnea Trainer?

1:59:27.520 --> 1:59:28.360
 Is that the one?

1:59:28.360 --> 1:59:30.440
 Well, I was using Calm for a long time,

1:59:30.440 --> 1:59:32.920
 but I let my subscription relapse

1:59:32.920 --> 1:59:35.280
 and I have another one whose name I don't remember.

1:59:35.280 --> 1:59:40.280
 But so it's very simple and it works for me.

1:59:41.400 --> 1:59:45.240
 Now trying this Tummo because I'm just curious

1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:47.880
 and exploring it because it may be acting

1:59:47.880 --> 1:59:48.720
 through a different way.

1:59:48.720 --> 1:59:52.120
 And I wanna see if I respond differently.

1:59:54.320 --> 1:59:57.880
 So I don't have a particular point of view now.

1:59:57.880 --> 2:00:02.120
 I have friends and colleagues who are into particular styles

2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:06.080
 like Wim Hof and I think what he's doing is great

2:00:06.080 --> 2:00:08.720
 in getting people who are interested.

2:00:08.720 --> 2:00:12.200
 I think the notion is that I would like to see

2:00:12.200 --> 2:00:16.480
 more people exploring this and to some degree,

2:00:16.480 --> 2:00:19.000
 as you point out, 30 minutes a day,

2:00:19.000 --> 2:00:24.000
 some of the breath patterns that some of these styles

2:00:24.440 --> 2:00:29.080
 like Wim Hof are a little intimidating to newbies.

2:00:29.080 --> 2:00:31.560
 And so I would like to see something very simple

2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:33.240
 that what I tell my friends is look,

2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:36.120
 just try it five or 10 minutes, see if you feel better,

2:00:36.120 --> 2:00:37.120
 do it for a few days.

2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:40.080
 If you don't like it, stop it, it doesn't cost anything.

2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:43.840
 And invariably they find that it's helpful.

2:00:43.840 --> 2:00:48.840
 I will often interrupt my day to take five or 10 minutes.

2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:54.600
 Like if I find that I'm lagging,

2:00:56.880 --> 2:00:59.000
 I think there's some pretty good data

2:00:59.000 --> 2:01:03.560
 that your performance after lunch declines.

2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:06.240
 And so very often what I'll do after lunch,

2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:08.640
 which I didn't do today, is take five or 10 minutes

2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:10.960
 and just sort of breath practice.

2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:13.400
 Lately, what does that breath practice look like?

2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:15.440
 It's just box breathing for five or 10 minutes.

2:01:15.440 --> 2:01:18.320
 And the duration of your inhales and holds and exhales

2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:20.240
 and holds is set by the app, is that right?

2:01:20.240 --> 2:01:22.920
 Well, I do five seconds.

2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:25.680
 So five seconds, inhale, five second hold,

2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:27.960
 five second exhale, five second hold.

2:01:27.960 --> 2:01:30.000
 And sometimes I'll do doubles.

2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:35.000
 I'll do 10 seconds just because I get bored.

2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:37.680
 I feel like doing it.

2:01:37.680 --> 2:01:42.280
 And it's very helpful.

2:01:44.400 --> 2:01:47.000
 Now that's not the only thing I do with respect

2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:49.440
 to trying to maintain my sanity and my health.

2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:51.560
 No, I can imagine there'll be a number of things.

2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:54.080
 Although you seem, because you seem very sane

2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:57.120
 and very healthy, I in fact know that you are.

2:01:57.120 --> 2:01:58.120
 Both of those things.

2:01:58.120 --> 2:01:59.360
 Well, you suspect that.

2:01:59.360 --> 2:02:01.780
 I suspect, but there's data.

2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:07.080
 A while back, we had a conversation, a casual conversation,

2:02:07.080 --> 2:02:08.960
 but you said something that really stuck in my mind,

2:02:08.960 --> 2:02:13.960
 which is that it might be that the specific pattern

2:02:14.400 --> 2:02:18.360
 of breath work that one does is not as important

2:02:18.360 --> 2:02:22.000
 as experiencing transitions between states

2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:25.640
 based on deliberate breath work or something to that extent,

2:02:25.640 --> 2:02:29.040
 which I interpreted to mean that if I were to do

2:02:29.040 --> 2:02:31.840
 box breathing with five second in, five second hold,

2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:35.160
 five second exhale, five second hold for a couple of days,

2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:36.400
 or maybe even a couple of minutes,

2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:39.600
 and then switch to 10 seconds, or then switch to Tummo,

2:02:39.600 --> 2:02:44.380
 that there's something powerful perhaps in the transitions

2:02:44.380 --> 2:02:47.040
 and realizing the relationship between different patterns

2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:48.280
 of breathing and those transitions.

2:02:48.280 --> 2:02:52.840
 Much in the same way that you can get into one of these cars

2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:55.000
 at an amusement park that just goes at a constant rate

2:02:55.000 --> 2:02:56.080
 and then stops.

2:02:56.080 --> 2:02:58.640
 Very different than learning how to shift gears.

2:02:59.560 --> 2:03:01.120
 I used to drive a manual, I still can,

2:03:01.120 --> 2:03:02.560
 so I'm thinking about a manual transmission,

2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:04.240
 but even with an automatic transmission,

2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:07.200
 you start to get a sense of how the vehicle behaves

2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:08.800
 under different conditions.

2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:11.280
 And I thought that was a beautiful seed

2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:13.360
 for a potential breath work practice that,

2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:16.020
 at least to my awareness, nobody has really formalized,

2:03:16.020 --> 2:03:18.300
 which is that you introduce some variability

2:03:18.300 --> 2:03:20.800
 within the practice that's somewhat random

2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:23.120
 in order to be able to sense the relationship

2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:25.320
 between different speeds and depths of inhales,

2:03:25.320 --> 2:03:27.040
 exhales, and holds, and so forth.

2:03:27.040 --> 2:03:29.020
 And essentially, it's like driving around the track,

2:03:29.020 --> 2:03:31.880
 but with obstacles at different rates,

2:03:31.880 --> 2:03:33.960
 and braking, and restarting, and things of that sort.

2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:35.780
 That's how you learn how to drive.

2:03:35.780 --> 2:03:37.200
 What do you think about that?

2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:39.760
 And if you like it enough,

2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:41.520
 can we call it the Feldman protocol?

2:03:41.520 --> 2:03:42.360
 Oh, please.

2:03:45.040 --> 2:03:48.200
 You know, I was asked in this BBC interview once,

2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:50.800
 why didn't I name it the Feldman complex

2:03:50.800 --> 2:03:52.240
 instead of the pre-busting complex?

2:03:52.240 --> 2:03:54.080
 I said I already have a Feldman complex.

2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:56.480
 Well, it sounds like a psychiatric disorder,

2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:01.480
 but I think the primary effect

2:04:02.660 --> 2:04:06.280
 is this disruptive effect, which I described.

2:04:06.280 --> 2:04:11.280
 And, but the particular responses may clearly vary

2:04:12.040 --> 2:04:14.620
 depending on what that disruption is.

2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:18.560
 I don't know of any particular data

2:04:18.560 --> 2:04:21.000
 which are some well-controlled experiments,

2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:23.240
 which can actually work through

2:04:23.240 --> 2:04:25.580
 the different types of breathing patterns,

2:04:25.580 --> 2:04:29.840
 or simply with a box pattern, just varying the durations.

2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:32.120
 I mean, Prayama is sort of similar,

2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:34.160
 but the amount of time you spend

2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:35.860
 going around the box is different.

2:04:36.800 --> 2:04:38.820
 So I don't really have much to say about this.

2:04:38.820 --> 2:04:41.280
 I mean, this is why we need

2:04:42.120 --> 2:04:44.960
 better controlled experiments in humans.

2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:49.000
 And I think this is where being able to study it in rodents,

2:04:49.000 --> 2:04:53.160
 where you can have a wide range of

2:04:54.800 --> 2:04:58.360
 perturbations while you're doing more invasive studies

2:04:58.360 --> 2:05:01.620
 to really get down as to which regions are affected,

2:05:01.620 --> 2:05:04.640
 how is the signal processing disrupted,

2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:07.520
 which is still a hypothesis, but how it's disrupted.

2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:09.640
 It could tell us a lot about, you know,

2:05:09.640 --> 2:05:12.280
 maybe there's a resonant point

2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:14.240
 at which there's an optimal effect

2:05:14.240 --> 2:05:17.160
 when you take a particular breathing practice.

2:05:17.160 --> 2:05:20.320
 And then when we talked about, you know,

2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:23.020
 the fact that different breathing practices

2:05:23.020 --> 2:05:27.440
 could be affecting the outcome through different pathways.

2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:30.000
 You know, you have the olfactory pathway,

2:05:30.000 --> 2:05:33.520
 you have a central pathway, you have a vagal pathway,

2:05:33.520 --> 2:05:35.400
 you have a descending pathway,

2:05:35.400 --> 2:05:38.040
 how different practices may

2:05:39.920 --> 2:05:43.000
 change the summation of those things,

2:05:43.000 --> 2:05:46.400
 because I think all those things are probably involved.

2:05:46.400 --> 2:05:49.380
 And we're just beginning to scratch the surface.

2:05:49.380 --> 2:05:54.380
 And I just hope that we can get serious neuroscientists

2:05:55.280 --> 2:05:59.040
 and psychologists to do the right experiments

2:05:59.040 --> 2:06:02.520
 to get at this, because I think there's a lot of value

2:06:02.520 --> 2:06:05.120
 to human health here.

2:06:05.120 --> 2:06:07.100
 I do too, and it's one of the reasons my lab

2:06:07.100 --> 2:06:09.480
 has shifted to these sorts of things in humans.

2:06:09.480 --> 2:06:11.500
 I'm delighted that you're continuing to do

2:06:11.500 --> 2:06:14.080
 the hardcore mechanistic work in mice

2:06:14.080 --> 2:06:17.840
 and probably do work in humans as well,

2:06:17.840 --> 2:06:18.840
 if you're not already.

2:06:18.840 --> 2:06:21.320
 And there are other groups, Epple Lab at UCSF

2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:23.560
 and a number of, I'm starting to see some papers out there

2:06:23.560 --> 2:06:25.520
 about respiration in humans a little bit,

2:06:25.520 --> 2:06:26.840
 some more brain imaging.

2:06:28.640 --> 2:06:32.920
 I can't help but ask about a somewhat unrelated topic,

2:06:32.920 --> 2:06:36.480
 but it is important in light of this conversation

2:06:36.480 --> 2:06:37.740
 because you're here.

2:06:37.740 --> 2:06:40.520
 And one of the things that I really enjoy

2:06:40.520 --> 2:06:44.280
 about conversations with you as it relates to health

2:06:44.280 --> 2:06:47.120
 and neuroscience and so forth is that

2:06:48.600 --> 2:06:51.120
 you're one of the few colleagues I have

2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:56.120
 who openly admits to exploring supplementation.

2:06:56.560 --> 2:07:00.040
 I'm a long time supplement fan.

2:07:02.400 --> 2:07:04.760
 I think there's power in compounds,

2:07:04.760 --> 2:07:09.320
 both prescription, non-prescription, natural, synthesized.

2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:11.480
 I don't use these haphazardly,

2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:13.680
 but I think there's certainly power in them.

2:07:13.680 --> 2:07:16.560
 And one of the places where you and I converge

2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:18.240
 in terms of our interest in the nervous system

2:07:18.240 --> 2:07:22.860
 and supplementation is vis-a-vis magnesium.

2:07:22.860 --> 2:07:27.600
 Now I've talked endlessly on the podcast and elsewhere

2:07:27.600 --> 2:07:29.900
 about magnesium for sake of sleep

2:07:29.900 --> 2:07:33.140
 and improving transitions to sleep and so forth.

2:07:33.140 --> 2:07:37.640
 But you have a somewhat different interest in magnesium

2:07:37.640 --> 2:07:39.480
 as it relates to cognitive function

2:07:39.480 --> 2:07:41.880
 and durability of cognitive function.

2:07:41.880 --> 2:07:43.440
 Would you mind just sharing with us a little bit

2:07:43.440 --> 2:07:46.280
 about what that interest is, where it stems from,

2:07:46.280 --> 2:07:49.720
 and because it's the Human Men Lab podcast

2:07:49.720 --> 2:07:51.360
 and we often talk about supplementation,

2:07:51.360 --> 2:07:54.720
 what you do with that information?

2:07:54.720 --> 2:07:58.520
 So I need to disclose that I am a scientific advisor

2:07:58.520 --> 2:08:00.320
 to a company called Neurocentria,

2:08:00.320 --> 2:08:04.360
 which my graduate student called Song Liu was CEO.

2:08:04.360 --> 2:08:07.360
 So that said, I can give you some background.

2:08:07.360 --> 2:08:10.080
 Guo Song, although when he was in my lab,

2:08:10.080 --> 2:08:10.920
 worked on breathing,

2:08:10.920 --> 2:08:14.160
 had a deep interest in learning and memory.

2:08:14.160 --> 2:08:16.520
 And when he left my lab, he went to work for it

2:08:16.520 --> 2:08:19.400
 with a renowned learning and memory guy

2:08:19.400 --> 2:08:21.560
 at Stanford, Dick Chen.

2:08:21.560 --> 2:08:24.760
 And when he finished there,

2:08:24.760 --> 2:08:27.960
 he was hired by Susumu Tonogawa at MIT.

2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:29.760
 Who also knows a thing or two about memory.

2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:33.340
 I'm teasing, Susumu has a Nobel for his work on

2:08:33.340 --> 2:08:38.340
 immunoglobulins, but then is a world-class memory researcher.

2:08:38.520 --> 2:08:39.360
 Yeah.

2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:41.240
 And more.

2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:43.480
 He's many things.

2:08:43.480 --> 2:08:48.480
 And Guo Song had very curious, very bright guy,

2:08:48.560 --> 2:08:53.560
 and he was interested in how signals between neurons

2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:55.160
 get strengthened, which is called

2:08:55.160 --> 2:08:58.080
 long-term potentiation or LTP.

2:08:58.080 --> 2:09:02.300
 And one of the questions that arose was,

2:09:02.300 --> 2:09:07.300
 if I have inputs to a neuron and I get LTP,

2:09:08.680 --> 2:09:13.680
 is the LTP bigger if the signal is bigger

2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:16.040
 or the noise is less?

2:09:16.040 --> 2:09:19.220
 So we can imagine that when we're listening to something,

2:09:19.220 --> 2:09:21.160
 if it's louder, we can hear it better.

2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:23.440
 Or if there's less noise, we can hear it better.

2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:26.280
 And he wanted to investigate this.

2:09:26.280 --> 2:09:31.280
 So he did this in tissue culture of hippocampal neurons.

2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:35.920
 And what he found was that if he lowered

2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:38.840
 the background activity in all of the neurons,

2:09:40.180 --> 2:09:44.560
 that the LTP he elicited got stronger.

2:09:44.560 --> 2:09:47.520
 And the way he did that was increasing

2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:50.600
 the level of magnesium in the bathing solution.

2:09:50.600 --> 2:09:54.920
 This gets into some esoteric electrophysiology,

2:09:54.920 --> 2:09:57.800
 but basically there's a background level

2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:02.800
 of noise in all neurons and that part of it is regulated

2:10:03.760 --> 2:10:07.720
 by the degree of magnesium in the extracellular bath.

2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:10.520
 And you mean electrical noise?

2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:12.880
 Electrical noise, I'm sorry, electrical noise.

2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:17.880
 And if you, in what's called the physiological range,

2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:22.680
 which is between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar,

2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:23.880
 which, don't worry about the number.

2:10:23.880 --> 2:10:25.520
 I can't believe I remember the millimolar

2:10:25.520 --> 2:10:26.360
 of the magnesium in that.

2:10:26.360 --> 2:10:28.600
 Well, I'm always frightened that I get,

2:10:28.600 --> 2:10:31.480
 you know, I say micro or femto or something,

2:10:31.480 --> 2:10:33.640
 I go off by several loads of magnitude.

2:10:34.980 --> 2:10:37.840
 So in that physiological range,

2:10:37.840 --> 2:10:40.800
 there's a big difference in the amount of noise

2:10:40.800 --> 2:10:44.520
 in a neuron between 0.8 and 1.2 millimolar.

2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:47.480
 So he played around with the magnesium

2:10:47.480 --> 2:10:50.680
 and he found out that when the magnesium was elevated,

2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:52.680
 there was more LTP.

2:10:52.680 --> 2:10:55.080
 All right, that's an observation in a tissue culture.

2:10:55.080 --> 2:10:57.240
 Right, and I should just mention that more LTP

2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:00.200
 essentially translates to more neuroplasticity,

2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:03.560
 more rewiring of connections in essence.

2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:08.560
 So he tested this in mice

2:11:09.400 --> 2:11:11.440
 and basically he offered them a,

2:11:14.040 --> 2:11:16.200
 he had control mice, which got a normal diet

2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:18.760
 and one that had more than the rich magnesium

2:11:18.760 --> 2:11:22.240
 and the ones that lived enriched with magnesium

2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:25.840
 had higher cognitive function, lived longer,

2:11:25.840 --> 2:11:29.080
 everything you'd want in some magic pill.

2:11:29.080 --> 2:11:32.480
 Those mice did that, excuse me, rats.

2:11:34.960 --> 2:11:38.360
 The problem was that you couldn't imagine

2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:43.360
 taking this into humans because most magnesium salts

2:11:43.680 --> 2:11:46.680
 don't passively get from the gut

2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:49.000
 into the bloodstream, into the brain.

2:11:49.000 --> 2:11:52.640
 They pass via what's called a transporter.

2:11:52.640 --> 2:11:54.800
 Transporter is something in a membrane

2:11:54.800 --> 2:11:59.800
 that grabs a magnesium molecule or atom

2:12:00.440 --> 2:12:02.960
 and pulls it into the other side.

2:12:02.960 --> 2:12:06.120
 So if you imagine you have magnesium in your gut,

2:12:06.120 --> 2:12:08.000
 you have transporters that pull the magnesium

2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.240
 into the gut into the bloodstream.

2:12:10.240 --> 2:12:14.280
 Well, if you had taken normal magnesium supplement

2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:16.600
 that you can buy at the pharmacy,

2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:19.360
 it doesn't cross the gut very easily

2:12:19.360 --> 2:12:21.440
 and if you would take enough of it

2:12:21.440 --> 2:12:26.040
 to get it in your bloodstream, you start getting diarrhea.

2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:29.280
 So it's not a good way to go.

2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:30.400
 Oh, it is a good way to go.

2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:32.400
 Oh, I couldn't help myself.

2:12:34.320 --> 2:12:35.160
 Well said.

2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:41.280
 So he worked with this brilliant chemist, Fei Mao,

2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:46.280
 and Fei looked at a whole range of magnesium compounds

2:12:48.160 --> 2:12:51.200
 and he found the magnesium threonate

2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:56.200
 was much more effective in crossing the gut blood barrier.

2:12:57.800 --> 2:12:59.680
 Now, they didn't realize at the time,

2:12:59.680 --> 2:13:02.640
 but threonate is a metabolite of vitamin C

2:13:03.520 --> 2:13:05.760
 and there's lots of threonate in your body.

2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:09.320
 So magnesium threonate would appear to be safe

2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:12.640
 and maybe a part of the role

2:13:12.640 --> 2:13:17.120
 or now they believe it's part of the role of the threonate

2:13:17.120 --> 2:13:19.880
 is that it supercharges the transporter

2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:21.000
 to get the magnesium in.

2:13:21.000 --> 2:13:25.240
 And remember, you need a transporter at the gut,

2:13:25.240 --> 2:13:27.120
 into the brain and into cells.

2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:33.480
 So they gave magnesium threonate to mice who had...

2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:37.160
 No, let me backtrack a bit.

2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:39.360
 They did a study in humans.

2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:43.080
 They hired a company to do a test.

2:13:43.080 --> 2:13:45.280
 It was a hands-off test.

2:13:45.280 --> 2:13:46.880
 It's one of these companies that gets hired

2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:49.840
 by the big pharma to do their test for them.

2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:54.840
 And they got patients who were diagnosed

2:13:54.880 --> 2:13:56.760
 as mild cognitive decline.

2:13:56.760 --> 2:13:59.360
 These are people who had cognitive disorder,

2:13:59.360 --> 2:14:01.680
 which was age inappropriate.

2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:06.200
 And the metric that they use for determining

2:14:06.200 --> 2:14:10.960
 how far off they were is Spearman's G-factor,

2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:15.800
 which is a generalized measure of intelligence

2:14:15.800 --> 2:14:18.360
 that most psychologists accept.

2:14:20.040 --> 2:14:25.040
 And the biological age of the subjects was,

2:14:25.800 --> 2:14:30.800
 I think 51 and the cognitive age was 61

2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:32.120
 based on the Spearman G-factor.

2:14:32.120 --> 2:14:35.120
 I should say the Spearman G-factor

2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:39.320
 starts at a particular level in the population

2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:43.680
 at age 20 and declines about 1% a year.

2:14:43.680 --> 2:14:47.960
 So sorry to say, we're not 20 year olds anymore.

2:14:49.600 --> 2:14:51.720
 But when you get a number from that,

2:14:51.720 --> 2:14:53.920
 you can put on the curve and see whether

2:14:53.920 --> 2:14:55.360
 it's about your age or not.

2:14:55.360 --> 2:14:57.600
 These people were about 10 years older

2:14:57.600 --> 2:14:59.160
 according to that metric.

2:14:59.160 --> 2:15:04.160
 And long story short, after three months,

2:15:04.160 --> 2:15:07.600
 this is a placebo-controlled double-blind study.

2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:11.440
 The people who were in the placebo arm

2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:16.280
 improved two years, which is common for human studies

2:15:16.280 --> 2:15:18.120
 because of the placebo effect.

2:15:18.120 --> 2:15:21.600
 The people who got the compound

2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:25.040
 improved eight years on average.

2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:27.040
 And some improved more than eight years.

2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:29.320
 They didn't do any further diagnosis

2:15:29.320 --> 2:15:31.080
 as to what caused the monoclonal decline.

2:15:31.080 --> 2:15:34.400
 But it was pretty, it was extraordinarily impressive.

2:15:34.400 --> 2:15:37.400
 So it moved their cognition closer to their biological age.

2:15:37.400 --> 2:15:38.800
 Biological age.

2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:42.120
 Do you recall what the dose is of magnesium 3-N-H?

2:15:42.120 --> 2:15:44.720
 It's in the paper and it's basically

2:15:44.720 --> 2:15:46.480
 what they have in the compound,

2:15:46.480 --> 2:15:48.280
 which is sold commercially.

2:15:48.280 --> 2:15:51.360
 So the compound, which is sold commercially,

2:15:51.360 --> 2:15:56.200
 is handled by a nutraceutical compound

2:15:56.200 --> 2:16:00.320
 or nutraceutical wholesaler who sells it to the retailers

2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:02.880
 and they make whatever formulation they want.

2:16:04.640 --> 2:16:09.640
 But it's a dosage which is,

2:16:09.680 --> 2:16:12.520
 my understanding is, readily tolerable.

2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:14.440
 I take half a dose.

2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:16.800
 The reason I take half a dose

2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:19.920
 is that I had my magnesium, blood magnesium measured

2:16:20.840 --> 2:16:25.800
 and it was low normal for my age.

2:16:25.800 --> 2:16:28.600
 I took half a dose, it became high normal.

2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:31.320
 And I felt comfortable staying in the normal range.

2:16:33.360 --> 2:16:36.680
 But, you know, a lot of people are taking the full dose

2:16:36.680 --> 2:16:41.680
 and at my age,

2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:43.880
 I'm not looking to get smarter.

2:16:43.880 --> 2:16:46.320
 I'm looking to decline more slowly.

2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:48.960
 And it's hard for me to tell you

2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:50.640
 whether or not it's effective or not.

2:16:50.640 --> 2:16:53.720
 Well, you remembered the millimolar of the magnesium

2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:55.880
 and the solution and on the high and low end.

2:16:55.880 --> 2:16:59.840
 So I would say it's not a well-controlled study

2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:04.240
 when it's an N of one, but it seems to be working.

2:17:04.240 --> 2:17:06.760
 When I've recommended it to my friends,

2:17:06.760 --> 2:17:11.760
 academics who are not by nature skeptical, if not cynical,

2:17:12.200 --> 2:17:14.400
 and I insist that they try it,

2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:17.800
 they usually don't report a major change

2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:19.160
 in their cognitive function,

2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:20.840
 although sometimes they do report,

2:17:20.840 --> 2:17:25.160
 well, I feel a little bit more alert and my physical movements

2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:28.760
 are better, but many of them report their sleep better.

2:17:28.760 --> 2:17:30.760
 And that makes sense.

2:17:30.760 --> 2:17:33.400
 I think there's good evidence that three and eight

2:17:33.400 --> 2:17:36.320
 can accelerate the transition into sleep

2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:41.240
 and maybe even access to deeper modes of sleep

2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:42.080
 for some people.

2:17:42.080 --> 2:17:44.320
 There are, for many people actually,

2:17:44.320 --> 2:17:46.320
 a small percentage of people who take three and eight,

2:17:46.320 --> 2:17:51.240
 including one of our podcast staff here,

2:17:51.240 --> 2:17:52.560
 have stomach issues with it.

2:17:52.560 --> 2:17:53.400
 They can't tolerate it.

2:17:53.400 --> 2:17:54.960
 I would say just anecdotally,

2:17:54.960 --> 2:17:57.640
 about 5% of people don't tolerate three and eight well.

2:17:57.640 --> 2:17:59.320
 You stop taking it and then they're fine.

2:17:59.320 --> 2:18:02.080
 It caused them diarrhea or something of that sort,

2:18:02.080 --> 2:18:03.280
 but most people tolerate it well.

2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:06.520
 And most people report that it vastly improves their sleep.

2:18:06.520 --> 2:18:07.640
 And again, that's anecdotally.

2:18:07.640 --> 2:18:10.680
 There are a few studies and they're more on the way,

2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:13.000
 but that's very interesting because I,

2:18:13.000 --> 2:18:15.400
 until you and I had the discussion about three and eight,

2:18:15.400 --> 2:18:20.200
 I wasn't aware of the cognitive enhancing effects,

2:18:20.200 --> 2:18:22.800
 but the story makes sense from a mechanistic perspective.

2:18:22.800 --> 2:18:25.760
 And it brings you around to a bigger

2:18:25.760 --> 2:18:27.080
 and more important statement,

2:18:27.080 --> 2:18:32.080
 which is that I so appreciate your attention to mechanism.

2:18:32.840 --> 2:18:35.960
 I guess this stems from your early training as a physicist

2:18:35.960 --> 2:18:37.440
 and the desire to get numbers

2:18:37.440 --> 2:18:40.880
 and to really parse things at a fine level.

2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:43.520
 So we've covered a lot today.

2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:45.280
 I know there's much more that we could cover.

2:18:45.280 --> 2:18:48.560
 I'm going to insist on a part two at some point,

2:18:48.560 --> 2:18:51.280
 but I really want to speak on behalf

2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:53.480
 of a huge number of people and just thank you,

2:18:53.480 --> 2:18:56.840
 not just for your time and energy and attention to detail

2:18:56.840 --> 2:18:59.440
 and accuracy and clarity around this topic today,

2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:02.480
 but also what I should have said at the beginning,

2:19:02.480 --> 2:19:03.480
 which is that, you know,

2:19:03.480 --> 2:19:06.120
 you really are a pioneer in this field

2:19:06.120 --> 2:19:09.160
 of studying respiration and the mechanisms

2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:11.400
 underlying respiration with modern tools

2:19:11.400 --> 2:19:14.120
 for now for many decades, you know,

2:19:14.120 --> 2:19:17.280
 and the field of neuroscience was one

2:19:17.280 --> 2:19:20.360
 that was perfectly content to address issues

2:19:20.360 --> 2:19:23.480
 like memory and vision and, you know,

2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:24.800
 sensation, perception, et cetera,

2:19:24.800 --> 2:19:27.960
 but the respiratory system was largely overlooked

2:19:27.960 --> 2:19:29.160
 for a long time.

2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:31.640
 And you've just been steadily clipping away

2:19:31.640 --> 2:19:34.120
 and clipping away and much because of the events

2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:38.800
 related to COVID and a number of other things

2:19:39.640 --> 2:19:41.240
 and this huge interest in breath work

2:19:41.240 --> 2:19:43.440
 and brain states and wellness,

2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:46.040
 the field of respiration and interest in respiration

2:19:46.040 --> 2:19:47.600
 has just exploded.

2:19:49.400 --> 2:19:52.080
 So I really want to extend a sincere thanks.

2:19:52.080 --> 2:19:53.960
 It means a lot to me.

2:19:53.960 --> 2:19:56.120
 And I know to the audience of this podcast

2:19:56.120 --> 2:19:59.080
 that someone with your depth and rigor in this area

2:19:59.080 --> 2:20:01.480
 is both a scientist and a practitioner

2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:02.880
 and that you would share this with us.

2:20:02.880 --> 2:20:03.800
 So thank you.

2:20:03.800 --> 2:20:05.400
 Well, I want to thank you.

2:20:05.400 --> 2:20:07.640
 This is actually a great opportunity for me.

2:20:07.640 --> 2:20:11.560
 I've been isolated in my silo for a long time

2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:14.040
 and it's been a wonderful experience

2:20:14.040 --> 2:20:17.160
 to communicate to people outside the silo

2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:18.320
 who have an interest in this.

2:20:18.320 --> 2:20:21.560
 And I think that there's a lot that remains to be done.

2:20:21.560 --> 2:20:24.880
 And I enjoy speaking to people who have interest in this.

2:20:24.880 --> 2:20:28.600
 I find the interest to be quite mind-boggling

2:20:28.600 --> 2:20:31.840
 and it's quite wonderful that people are willing

2:20:31.840 --> 2:20:36.840
 to listen to things that can be quite esoteric at times,

2:20:38.320 --> 2:20:41.520
 but it gets down to deep things about who we are

2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:43.200
 and how we are going to live our lives.

2:20:43.200 --> 2:20:44.880
 So I appreciate the opportunity

2:20:44.880 --> 2:20:48.920
 and I would be delighted to come back at any time.

2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:49.760
 Wonderful.

2:20:49.760 --> 2:20:50.720
 We will absolutely do it.

2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:51.800
 Thanks again, Jack.

2:20:51.800 --> 2:20:53.320
 Bye now.

2:20:53.320 --> 2:20:55.200
 Thank you for joining me for my conversation

2:20:55.200 --> 2:20:56.720
 with Dr. Jack Feldman.

 I teach neuroscience on Instagram and Twitter.

2:21:36.760 --> 2:21:38.980
 Some of that information covers information

2:21:38.980 --> 2:21:40.160
 covered on the podcast.

2:21:40.160 --> 2:21:42.480
 Some of that information is unique information,

2:21:42.480 --> 2:21:45.280
 and that includes science and science-based tools

2:21:45.280 --> 2:21:47.040
 that you can apply in everyday life.

2:21:47.040 --> 2:21:50.640
 During today's podcast and on many previous podcast episodes

2:21:50.640 --> 2:21:51.960
 we talk about supplements.

2:21:51.960 --> 2:21:54.280
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

2:21:54.280 --> 2:21:56.920
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them.

2:21:56.920 --> 2:21:58.440
 One of the key issues with supplements,

2:21:58.440 --> 2:21:59.800
 if you're going to take them,

2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:01.800
 is that they be of the utmost quality.

2:22:01.800 --> 2:22:03.520
 For that reason, the Huberman Lab Podcast

2:22:03.520 --> 2:22:06.600
 has partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.

2:22:06.600 --> 2:22:09.040
 Thorne supplements are of the very highest quality,

2:22:09.040 --> 2:22:10.980
 both with respect to the quality

2:22:10.980 --> 2:22:12.320
 of the ingredients themselves

2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:14.660
 and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients.

2:22:14.660 --> 2:22:15.500
 Why do I say that?

2:22:15.500 --> 2:22:17.320
 Well, many supplement companies out there

2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:20.520
 list amounts of particular substances on the bottle.

2:22:20.520 --> 2:22:21.600
 And when they've been tested,

2:22:21.600 --> 2:22:25.000
 they do not match up to what's actually in those products.

2:22:25.000 --> 2:22:27.860
 Thorne has the highest levels of stringency for quality

2:22:27.860 --> 2:22:31.920
 and the particular amounts that are in each product.

2:22:31.920 --> 2:22:33.460
 They partnered with the Mayo Clinic

2:22:33.460 --> 2:22:34.560
 and all the major sports teams.

2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:36.760
 So there's tremendous trust in Thorne products.

2:22:36.760 --> 2:22:38.160
 That's why we partnered with them.

2:22:38.160 --> 2:22:40.120
 If you're interested in seeing the supplements that I take,

2:22:40.120 --> 2:22:44.000
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

2:22:44.000 --> 2:22:46.200
 You can see the supplements that I take from Thorne.

2:22:46.200 --> 2:22:48.140
 If you purchase any of those supplements there,

2:22:48.140 --> 2:22:49.680
 you can get 20% off.

2:22:49.680 --> 2:22:51.960
 And if you navigate further into the Thorne site

2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:54.360
 to see the huge array of other products that they make,

2:22:54.360 --> 2:22:57.280
 if you go in through thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

2:22:57.280 --> 2:22:59.480
 you'll also get 20% off any of the products

2:22:59.480 --> 2:23:00.680
 that Thorne makes.

2:23:00.680 --> 2:23:03.080
 I also want to just mention one more time,

2:23:03.080 --> 2:23:04.640
 the program that I mentioned at the beginning

2:23:04.640 --> 2:23:06.840
 of the episode, which is Our Breath Collective.

2:23:06.840 --> 2:23:09.440
 The Our Breath Collective has an advisory board

2:23:09.440 --> 2:23:11.480
 that includes people like Dr. Jack Feldman,

2:23:11.480 --> 2:23:14.200
 where you can learn detailed breath work protocols.

2:23:14.200 --> 2:23:16.440
 If you're interested in doing or teaching breath work,

2:23:16.440 --> 2:23:18.200
 I highly recommend checking it out.

2:23:18.200 --> 2:23:21.560
 You can find it at ourbreathcollective.com slash Huberman,

2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:24.400
 and that will give you $10 off your first month.

2:23:24.400 --> 2:23:26.040
 So I want to thank you once again for joining me

2:23:26.040 --> 2:23:28.080
 for my conversation with Dr. Jack Feldman.

2:23:28.080 --> 2:23:30.240
 And last, but certainly not least,

2:23:30.240 --> 2:23:32.040
 thank you for your interest in science.

2:23:32.040 --> 2:23:33.240
 I'll see you next time.

2:23:33.240 --> 2:23:34.080
 Bye.

2:23:34.080 --> 2:23:34.920
 Bye.

2:23:34.920 --> 2:24:03.920
 Bye.
