00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.160 --> 00:13.360
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.360 --> 00:15.300
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.300 --> 00:16.500
 This podcast is separate

00:16.500 --> 00:18.880
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

00:18.880 --> 00:21.040
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.040 --> 00:23.160
 to bring zero cost to consumer information

00:23.160 --> 00:25.560
 about science and science-related tools

00:25.560 --> 00:27.440
 to the general public.

00:27.440 --> 00:28.640
 In keeping with that theme,

00:28.640 --> 00:31.840
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.520
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.920
 Inside Tracker analyzes your blood and DNA

00:37.920 --> 00:39.880
 to give you an accurate assessment

00:39.880 --> 00:42.920
 of your health and your biological age.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.520
 There are many things about our health

00:44.520 --> 00:47.720
 that can only be analyzed from blood and DNA tests.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.360
 I've been getting my blood assessed for many years now,

00:50.360 --> 00:53.460
 and about a year ago, I switched to Inside Tracker.

00:53.460 --> 00:55.080
 What I like about Inside Tracker

00:55.080 --> 00:57.360
 is that you get all this information back

00:57.360 --> 01:00.920
 about metabolic factors, endocrine factors, et cetera,

01:00.920 --> 01:02.720
 that are really important to your health.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.380
 But unlike a lot of blood tests

01:04.380 --> 01:05.660
 where you just get all the numbers back

01:05.660 --> 01:07.560
 and it tells you whether or not things are high,

01:07.560 --> 01:11.120
 normal, or low, Inside Tracker also has this really useful

01:11.120 --> 01:13.500
 and really easy-to-use dashboard

01:13.500 --> 01:16.560
 that takes the information for your blood and DNA tests

01:16.560 --> 01:20.440
 and points you toward particular behavioral, nutritional,

01:20.440 --> 01:22.140
 and other sorts of protocols that you can use

01:22.140 --> 01:25.680
 to get the numbers where you want them for your health.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.760
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

01:27.760 --> 01:31.000
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.320
 and they will give you 25% off any of their programs.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.560
 Again, their programs allow you to assess your health

01:36.560 --> 01:39.560
 from the inside, things that you could just never assess

01:39.560 --> 01:43.040
 from any kind of test that didn't involve blood and DNA.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.520
 And it also has this really interesting feature

01:45.520 --> 01:47.080
 that it can measure your inner age,

01:47.080 --> 01:48.700
 which is based on biology.

01:48.700 --> 01:50.280
 Your chronological age, of course,

01:50.280 --> 01:52.140
 is very informative about your health

01:52.140 --> 01:54.740
 and where you ought to be in terms of health metrics,

01:54.740 --> 01:55.840
 but people vary.

01:55.840 --> 01:56.840
 We know people, of course,

01:56.840 --> 01:59.560
 that are in their late 90s who are doing well.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.960
 We know people that are in their 50s who are struggling

02:01.960 --> 02:03.160
 or even in their 20s.

02:03.160 --> 02:05.800
 So blood and DNA are the way to analyze your health.

02:05.800 --> 02:06.640
 That's my belief.

02:06.640 --> 02:08.400
 That's why I use Inside Tracker.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.200
 So go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

02:11.200 --> 02:14.040
 to get 25% off any of their products

02:14.040 --> 02:16.700
 and use Huberman at checkout.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.960
 Our second sponsor of today's episode is Helix Sleep.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.460
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

02:22.460 --> 02:24.920
 that are ideally suited to your needs

02:24.920 --> 02:27.520
 for the best night's sleep possible.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.400
 I switched to using a Helix mattress

02:29.400 --> 02:31.880
 and Helix pillow this last year,

02:31.880 --> 02:34.580
 and I'm sleeping better than I ever have before.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.640
 The way that Helix mattresses work,

02:36.640 --> 02:37.720
 and the reason they're different,

02:37.720 --> 02:41.320
 is that they are tailored to your individual sleep style.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.200
 Your sleep style can be assessed by going to their website.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.160
 You take a brief two-minute questionnaire quiz,

02:47.160 --> 02:49.240
 ask you questions like, do you sleep on your back

02:49.240 --> 02:50.480
 or your side or your stomach?

02:50.480 --> 02:51.320
 Maybe you don't know,

02:51.320 --> 02:53.560
 maybe you move around a lot during the night.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.360
 It also asks you questions such as,

02:55.360 --> 02:58.160
 do you tend to run hot or wake up cold?

02:58.160 --> 02:59.320
 Things of that sort.

02:59.320 --> 03:02.000
 And then they tailor a particular mattress

03:02.000 --> 03:03.360
 to your sleep needs.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.540
 For me, I matched to the so-called DUSK mattress,

03:06.540 --> 03:07.480
 and I love it.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.000
 I sleep better than ever.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.080
 And right now, if you want to try Helix Sleep,

03:12.080 --> 03:15.120
 you can go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.400
 And if you do that,

03:16.400 --> 03:20.160
 you'll get $200 off your order plus two free pillows.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.260
 They also have a great warranty.

03:21.260 --> 03:23.660
 They have a 10-year warranty on their mattresses.

03:23.660 --> 03:25.840
 If you don't like the mattress for any reason,

03:25.840 --> 03:28.000
 they'll pick it up for free from your home.

03:28.000 --> 03:31.580
 And they just make the whole thing really easy to try

03:31.580 --> 03:33.200
 and determine whether or not it's right for you.

03:33.200 --> 03:36.440
 So again, it's helixsleep.com slash Huberman

03:36.440 --> 03:41.060
 to get $200 off and two free pillows on your first order.

03:41.060 --> 03:43.920
 Some of you have asked how you can help support the podcast

03:43.920 --> 03:47.520
 in yet other ways besides just checking out our sponsors.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.080
 We really appreciate the question,

03:49.080 --> 03:51.360
 and we've set up a Patreon account at

03:51.360 --> 03:54.720
 patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

03:54.720 --> 03:57.060
 which allows you to donate to the podcast

03:57.060 --> 03:58.880
 at a variety of different levels.

03:58.880 --> 04:01.880
 We have, for instance, the 5HTP,

04:01.880 --> 04:04.280
 which is in honor of serotonin,

04:04.280 --> 04:06.720
 5HTP is the name for serotonin,

04:06.720 --> 04:09.600
 that allows you to donate $5 per month.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.580
 We have the Circadian,

04:11.580 --> 04:15.320
 which as many of you, of course, will know is 24-hour day.

04:15.320 --> 04:17.900
 So you can donate $24 a month if you like.

04:17.900 --> 04:19.800
 You can also pick any value that you want.

04:19.800 --> 04:22.780
 We even have the Costello, which is $10 a month,

04:22.780 --> 04:25.520
 which allows you to support the podcast

04:25.520 --> 04:28.640
 in honor of Costello, the fact that he's 10 years old,

04:28.640 --> 04:30.380
 that he eats 10 pounds of food a day,

04:30.380 --> 04:33.900
 and the fact that he takes 10 one-hour naps per day

04:33.900 --> 04:34.920
 on average.

04:34.920 --> 04:38.120
 So again, that's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman

04:38.120 --> 04:41.260
 if you'd like to support the podcast that way.

04:41.260 --> 04:43.640
 Today's episode is going to be all about

04:43.640 --> 04:46.580
 the science of emotions.

04:46.580 --> 04:47.960
 The first month of the podcast,

04:47.960 --> 04:51.440
 we talked about sleep and wakefulness.

04:51.440 --> 04:54.600
 Last month, we were talking about neuroplasticity,

04:54.600 --> 04:57.840
 the brain's ability to change in response to experience.

04:57.840 --> 05:00.420
 And this month, we're going to talk about

05:00.420 --> 05:02.960
 these things that we call emotions.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.920
 We're going to decipher what they are, how they work,

05:06.920 --> 05:08.520
 how we can control them,

05:08.520 --> 05:10.740
 when we might not want to control them.

05:11.760 --> 05:15.320
 There are going to be four episodes on emotions.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.400
 And today, we're going to talk in particular

05:18.400 --> 05:22.940
 about something that most often is called stress.

05:22.940 --> 05:26.120
 You might be thinking, wait, stress isn't an emotion,

05:26.120 --> 05:28.860
 but stress really lies at the heart

05:28.860 --> 05:32.060
 of whether or not our internal experience

05:32.060 --> 05:36.040
 is matched well or not to our external experience

05:36.040 --> 05:39.200
 or the events that are happening to us and around us.

05:39.200 --> 05:43.200
 And as you'll soon see, those converge or combine

05:43.200 --> 05:46.340
 to create what we call emotions.

05:46.340 --> 05:47.740
 Now, I want to be very clear

05:47.740 --> 05:50.960
 that we're going to talk about the biology of emotions.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.220
 We're going to talk a little bit about

05:52.220 --> 05:55.120
 some psychological concepts related to emotion.

05:55.120 --> 05:58.160
 And we are definitely going to talk about tools

05:58.160 --> 06:00.280
 to control what we call stress

06:00.280 --> 06:01.800
 or commonly think of as stress.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.580
 We're also going to clean up some common myths about stress.

06:04.580 --> 06:08.500
 For instance, that stress impairs your immune system.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.480
 That's true in certain contexts.

06:10.480 --> 06:11.560
 And in other contexts,

06:11.560 --> 06:13.500
 stress actually enhances your immune system

06:13.500 --> 06:15.480
 and makes it function better.

06:15.480 --> 06:18.440
 There is going to be a lot of discussion

06:18.440 --> 06:21.040
 about whether or not our internal state,

06:21.040 --> 06:24.520
 whether or not we are alert or calm is good or bad

06:24.520 --> 06:26.360
 depending on the circumstances.

06:26.360 --> 06:30.240
 So where we're headed here is I'd like you to come away

06:30.240 --> 06:33.000
 from today's episode with what I call

06:33.000 --> 06:36.880
 an organizational logic, a framework for thinking about

06:36.880 --> 06:39.700
 these things that typically we just call happy or sad

06:39.700 --> 06:41.720
 or depressed or anxious.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.460
 And I'm going to make sure that you have tools

06:44.460 --> 06:47.240
 that are grounded in physiology and neuroscience

06:47.240 --> 06:49.120
 that will allow you to navigate

06:49.120 --> 06:52.720
 this otherwise complex space that we call emotions

06:52.720 --> 06:55.780
 that will allow you to ground yourself better

06:55.780 --> 06:59.520
 when you're feeling like life is weighing on you

06:59.520 --> 07:02.560
 or you're kind of being pulled by the currents of life

07:02.560 --> 07:04.760
 as well as to support other people,

07:04.760 --> 07:06.960
 whether or not that's in a psychological practice

07:06.960 --> 07:11.440
 if you're a practitioner or you have clients or children

07:11.440 --> 07:14.360
 or spouses really to be able to support other people

07:14.360 --> 07:16.440
 in your environment better.

07:16.440 --> 07:19.160
 And the tools that I'm going to focus on today

07:19.160 --> 07:21.220
 range from behavioral tools.

07:21.220 --> 07:24.000
 We will talk about some of the more valuable

07:24.000 --> 07:26.520
 supplementation tools that are out there.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.480
 And we're going to talk a little bit

07:28.480 --> 07:31.900
 about things like depression, PTSD,

07:31.900 --> 07:34.760
 but we will be devoting entire episodes

07:34.760 --> 07:37.060
 to things like depression, PTSD,

07:37.060 --> 07:40.080
 and even attention deficit and obsessive compulsive disorder

07:40.080 --> 07:41.880
 which believe it or not,

07:41.880 --> 07:44.080
 although this might not surprise many of you,

07:44.080 --> 07:46.360
 have a very strong emotional component.

07:46.360 --> 07:49.620
 It's just not just about compulsive behaviors

07:49.620 --> 07:50.520
 and intrusive thoughts.

07:50.520 --> 07:54.220
 It's also about the emotional load of being in that state.

07:54.220 --> 07:57.560
 So I promise that today we're going to clean up

07:57.560 --> 07:59.780
 a lot of misunderstanding.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.120
 We're going to give you a lot of tools

08:02.120 --> 08:05.760
 and you're going to learn a lot about the biology

08:05.760 --> 08:08.500
 of how your body and brain work together.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.880
 Because if ever there was a topic

08:10.880 --> 08:13.400
 that brought together the brain and body

08:13.400 --> 08:18.040
 or mind-body relationship, it's stress and emotions.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.440
 It's also the positive emotions.

08:19.440 --> 08:23.140
 When we feel something, whether or not we're super happy

08:23.140 --> 08:24.960
 or just feeling kind of pleasant,

08:24.960 --> 08:28.920
 or we are feeling stressed, anxious, and overwhelmed,

08:28.920 --> 08:32.360
 it isn't just in our head, it's also in our body.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.500
 And as you may recall, the nervous system,

08:35.500 --> 08:38.400
 which includes the brain and the eyes and the spinal cord,

08:38.400 --> 08:41.700
 but also all the connections with the organs of the body

08:41.700 --> 08:43.520
 includes the brain and body.

08:43.520 --> 08:45.960
 And those organs of the body,

08:45.960 --> 08:48.880
 your gut and your liver and your spleen,

08:48.880 --> 08:52.160
 they're also communicating with the brain.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.000
 So I look forward to a day in fact,

08:54.000 --> 08:56.680
 when we no longer think about neuroscience

08:56.680 --> 08:57.760
 as just the brain.

08:57.760 --> 08:59.080
 And many neuroscientists now

08:59.080 --> 09:01.080
 also think about the body of course,

09:01.080 --> 09:02.240
 the brain controls the body,

09:02.240 --> 09:05.200
 but the body is also having a very profound

09:05.200 --> 09:08.120
 and concrete influence on the brain.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.240
 I think up until recently,

09:11.240 --> 09:13.840
 people would hear about kind of brain-body

09:13.840 --> 09:15.200
 and always think about mindfulness.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.320
 We're actually not going to talk that much

09:16.320 --> 09:18.320
 about mindfulness at all today.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.400
 Mindfulness is kind of a vague concept in fact.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.840
 When you think about mindfulness,

09:22.840 --> 09:24.140
 it's good to take the opposite.

09:24.140 --> 09:26.560
 What's the opposite of mindfulness would be mindlessness.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.520
 Well, all of a sudden we're into territory

09:28.520 --> 09:31.480
 that isn't really easy for one person

09:31.480 --> 09:33.000
 to describe their experience

09:33.000 --> 09:35.120
 or to help others with their experience.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.240
 Today, we're going to talk about objective tools

09:37.240 --> 09:40.000
 that match the brain-body experience

09:40.000 --> 09:42.740
 or separate the brain-body experience

09:42.740 --> 09:47.360
 in ways that leverage your ability to lean into life better,

09:47.360 --> 09:49.960
 to feel better, literally to just feel better

09:49.960 --> 09:51.600
 about what you're experiencing

09:51.600 --> 09:53.400
 and believe it or not,

09:53.400 --> 09:56.340
 to be able to control your emotions when that's appropriate.

09:56.340 --> 09:58.200
 This isn't about becoming robotic.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.660
 This isn't about trying not to feel human.

10:00.660 --> 10:03.960
 This is actually about being able to lean into life better

10:03.960 --> 10:06.060
 as a consequence of being able to control

10:06.060 --> 10:08.120
 some of your inner real estate,

10:08.120 --> 10:10.400
 this nervous system that includes the brain and body

10:10.400 --> 10:12.840
 and how that nervous system is interacting

10:12.840 --> 10:13.880
 with the outside world.

10:13.880 --> 10:16.640
 So it's to place you in a greater position of power.

10:16.640 --> 10:20.180
 And so let's get started in deciphering what is stress,

10:20.180 --> 10:24.180
 what are emotions and why did I batch stress and emotions

10:24.180 --> 10:26.680
 into one discussion today?

10:26.680 --> 10:27.840
 Okay, so what is stress?

10:27.840 --> 10:30.700
 We hear all the time that stress is bad.

10:30.700 --> 10:34.040
 We hear people saying they're really stressed out.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.680
 What is stress?

10:35.680 --> 10:40.360
 You've all presumably heard the arguments or the framework

10:40.360 --> 10:44.540
 that stress is this horrible ancient carryover

10:44.540 --> 10:47.360
 from times in which humans were pursued by animals

10:47.360 --> 10:49.480
 or other human predators.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.800
 And that whenever we feel what we call stress

10:52.800 --> 10:56.440
 or feel stressed out that it's just this unfortunate

10:56.440 --> 11:00.000
 invasion of something that we no longer need in modern life

11:00.000 --> 11:02.800
 that this was designed for when we were being attacked

11:02.800 --> 11:05.920
 by bears or tigers or lions or whatever it is.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.440
 And gosh, what an unfortunate thing.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.140
 And we have so many creature comforts nowadays

11:11.140 --> 11:13.800
 but we have not eliminated this stress.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.360
 Almost as if it was like an organ or a system in our body

11:16.360 --> 11:19.000
 that was bad for us that we're stuck with

11:19.000 --> 11:21.480
 just because of the species that we are.

11:21.480 --> 11:25.040
 But first of all, all species experience stress.

11:25.040 --> 11:28.720
 And I think that it's fair to say,

11:28.720 --> 11:30.360
 even though I wasn't there,

11:30.360 --> 11:34.800
 that yes, in fact, throughout our evolutionary history

11:34.800 --> 11:37.640
 we were vulnerable to animal attack

11:37.640 --> 11:40.960
 and other human attacks on a regular basis

11:40.960 --> 11:43.640
 up until a point where we started developing

11:43.640 --> 11:45.800
 weapons and structures and fire and other things

11:45.800 --> 11:47.620
 that allow us to protect ourselves better

11:47.620 --> 11:50.880
 from those animals and invaders of various kinds.

11:50.880 --> 11:55.080
 But it is entirely naive for us to think that

11:55.080 --> 11:59.040
 in ancient times, ancient times being a kind of loose term

11:59.040 --> 12:02.160
 for previous time, medieval times,

12:02.160 --> 12:03.640
 a hundred years ago, a thousand years ago,

12:03.640 --> 12:07.960
 10,000 years ago, of course there were infidelities.

12:07.960 --> 12:10.540
 Partners cheated, people died.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.840
 In fact, before the advent of phones

12:12.840 --> 12:15.400
 which we're gonna talk about today,

12:15.400 --> 12:18.560
 you can imagine that someone might head off on a hunt

12:18.560 --> 12:20.740
 or to go visit a relative and never come back.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.000
 And you would never know why.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.420
 That would be very stressful.

12:23.420 --> 12:25.360
 So there was psychosocial stress.

12:25.360 --> 12:27.380
 There was a stress of losing loved ones.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.120
 There was the stress of cold, of famine.

12:30.120 --> 12:33.120
 There was the stress probably also of just worry.

12:33.120 --> 12:37.560
 This idea that ancient versions of humans

12:37.560 --> 12:39.880
 a thousand years ago, a hundred years ago didn't worry.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.520
 I think that is entirely inconsistent

12:42.520 --> 12:44.040
 with everything we know about the structure

12:44.040 --> 12:47.200
 of the human brain a hundred years, a thousand years ago.

12:47.200 --> 12:51.540
 So all the problems that we're struggling with existed

12:51.540 --> 12:53.260
 for ever.

12:53.260 --> 12:58.040
 It's just that stress at its core is a generalized system.

12:58.040 --> 13:01.140
 It wasn't designed for tigers attacking us

13:01.140 --> 13:02.520
 or people attacking us.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.320
 It's a system to mobilize other systems

13:05.320 --> 13:06.840
 in the brain and body.

13:06.840 --> 13:08.000
 That's what stress really is.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.800
 It's designed to be generic.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.360
 And that's the most important thing

13:11.360 --> 13:13.760
 that I'd like you to understand today is that the system

13:13.760 --> 13:16.900
 that governs what we call stress is generic.

13:16.900 --> 13:19.300
 It wasn't designed for one thing.

13:20.580 --> 13:22.760
 And that gives it a certain advantage

13:22.760 --> 13:25.240
 in taking over the state of our brain and body

13:25.240 --> 13:28.800
 but it also gives you all of us an advantage

13:28.800 --> 13:31.400
 in controlling it because it's based

13:31.400 --> 13:34.560
 on hardwired biological mechanisms.

13:34.560 --> 13:38.020
 And there are hardwired biological mechanisms

13:38.020 --> 13:40.240
 meaning cells and chemicals and pathways

13:40.240 --> 13:43.280
 and tissues that exist in you right now

13:43.280 --> 13:47.100
 that require no neuroplasticity that allow you

13:47.100 --> 13:48.960
 to put a brake on stress.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.040
 And so we're gonna talk about those.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.440
 So you have a system for stress and you have a system

13:53.440 --> 13:56.740
 for de-stress that are baked into you.

13:56.740 --> 13:59.800
 They were genetically encoded and you were born with them

13:59.800 --> 14:01.840
 and you still have them now.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.920
 So if you're alive and listening

14:03.920 --> 14:06.480
 you have the capacity to control your stress.

14:06.480 --> 14:08.380
 And today I'm gonna talk about ways

14:08.380 --> 14:09.880
 that you can control your stress

14:09.880 --> 14:13.320
 not just by doing some offline practice of meditation

14:13.320 --> 14:16.600
 or breath work or something like that, but real time tools.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.140
 Tools that allow you to push back on stress

14:19.140 --> 14:21.440
 when stress hits in real time.

14:21.440 --> 14:23.920
 This is something that my lab works actively on

14:23.920 --> 14:25.580
 in developing and testing these tools

14:25.580 --> 14:27.500
 and evolving these tools.

14:27.500 --> 14:30.960
 And there are other laboratories that do this as well.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.100
 So let's talk about the stress response.

14:33.100 --> 14:36.080
 And by doing that, you will understand exactly

14:36.080 --> 14:38.400
 why the tools I'm gonna give you work.

14:38.400 --> 14:41.100
 For those of you that are saying, wait

14:41.100 --> 14:43.860
 I just want the tools, just give me a summary.

14:43.860 --> 14:45.920
 Trust me, if you understand mechanism

14:45.920 --> 14:48.000
 you are going to be in a far better position

14:48.000 --> 14:50.920
 to incorporate these tools, to teach these tools to others

14:50.920 --> 14:54.440
 and to modify them as your life circumstances change.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.960
 If you'd like the cheat sheet

14:55.960 --> 14:57.820
 or you just want the one page PDF

14:57.820 --> 14:59.400
 eventually we'll get that stuff out to people

14:59.400 --> 15:00.840
 but it's really important

15:00.840 --> 15:03.360
 to understand the underlying mechanism.

15:03.360 --> 15:05.280
 Okay, so what is stress?

15:05.280 --> 15:08.000
 Well, let's just distinguish between stressors

15:08.000 --> 15:10.640
 which are the things that stress us out

15:10.640 --> 15:14.080
 and stress which is the psychological

15:14.080 --> 15:17.200
 and physiological response to stressors.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.640
 I'm mainly gonna talk about stress

15:18.640 --> 15:21.240
 which is your response to things.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.480
 Let's be clear about what we already know

15:23.480 --> 15:27.520
 which is that stressors can be psychological

15:28.400 --> 15:29.600
 or they can be physical.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.160
 If I put you outside on a cold day without a jacket

15:34.160 --> 15:37.040
 for a very long time, that is stressful.

15:37.040 --> 15:40.680
 If I have you prepare for too many exams at once

15:40.680 --> 15:42.960
 and you can't balance it all with your sleep schedule

15:42.960 --> 15:45.400
 and your other needs for comfort and wellbeing

15:45.400 --> 15:47.660
 like food, rest, sleep, and social connection

15:47.660 --> 15:48.680
 that is stressful.

15:49.640 --> 15:52.600
 So stress, and as I mentioned before is generic

15:52.600 --> 15:54.160
 it doesn't distinguish

15:54.160 --> 15:58.200
 between physical and emotional stress.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.360
 So what happens when the stress response hits?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.060
 Let's talk about the immediate

16:02.060 --> 16:04.720
 or what we call the acute stress response.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.840
 We could also think of this as a short-term stress.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.960
 So you have a collection of neurons, they have a name

16:11.960 --> 16:14.000
 it's called the sympathetic chain ganglia

16:14.000 --> 16:15.880
 and it has nothing to do with sympathy.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.040
 Simpa means together.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.240
 And there's a group of neurons

16:20.240 --> 16:22.240
 that start right about at your neck

16:22.240 --> 16:25.360
 and run down to about your navel a little bit lower.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.780
 And those are called the sympathetic chain ganglia.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.440
 You don't need to memorize that name.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.920
 There will not be a quiz

16:31.920 --> 16:34.600
 but it's important to know that in the middle of your body

16:34.600 --> 16:36.080
 you have a chain of neurons

16:36.080 --> 16:39.480
 that when something stresses us out either in our mind

16:39.480 --> 16:41.640
 or because something enters our environment

16:41.640 --> 16:43.240
 and we see something that stresses us out

16:43.240 --> 16:45.440
 that we don't like heights if you're afraid of heights

16:45.440 --> 16:48.480
 somebody you dislike walks into the room, et cetera

16:50.680 --> 16:52.840
 that chain of neurons becomes activated

16:52.840 --> 16:56.080
 like a bunch of dominoes falling all at once.

16:56.080 --> 16:57.780
 It's very fast.

16:59.280 --> 17:03.520
 When that happens, those neurons release a neuromodulator

17:03.520 --> 17:05.160
 neurochemical that I've talked about before

17:05.160 --> 17:07.480
 on this podcast called acetylcholine.

17:07.480 --> 17:11.360
 They release that at various sites within the body.

17:11.360 --> 17:12.640
 Now this is important

17:12.640 --> 17:14.600
 because normally acetylcholine would be used

17:14.600 --> 17:15.960
 to move muscles.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.640
 Actually, every time we move a muscle

17:17.640 --> 17:19.800
 pick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen

17:19.800 --> 17:22.520
 walk down the street, it's spinal neurons

17:22.520 --> 17:25.400
 connecting to muscle and releasing acetylcholine.

17:25.400 --> 17:27.280
 So in the brain, it's involved in focus

17:27.280 --> 17:30.240
 and it muscles is involved in making muscles twitch.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.420
 But if we were stressed

17:31.420 --> 17:33.500
 we wouldn't want all our muscles to contract at once

17:33.500 --> 17:35.960
 because we would just be kind of like paralyzed like this

17:35.960 --> 17:38.280
 in what tonic activation as it's called.

17:38.280 --> 17:39.360
 We wouldn't want that.

17:39.360 --> 17:41.040
 Something called tetanus believe it or not

17:41.040 --> 17:43.520
 because the tetanus toxin will cause that kind of rigor

17:43.520 --> 17:45.000
 of the entire body.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.040
 You do not want that.

17:47.500 --> 17:50.520
 When those neurons are activated acetylcholine is released

17:50.520 --> 17:52.040
 but there are some other neurons

17:52.040 --> 17:54.060
 for the aficionados out there.

17:54.060 --> 17:56.080
 They're called the postganglionic neurons.

17:56.080 --> 17:58.400
 Those ones respond to that acetylcholine

17:58.400 --> 18:00.860
 and then they release epinephrine

18:00.860 --> 18:03.560
 which is the equivalent to adrenaline.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.360
 So we have this system where very fast

18:06.360 --> 18:08.780
 whenever we're stressed, the core of our body

18:08.780 --> 18:10.240
 these neurons down the middle of our body

18:10.240 --> 18:12.040
 release these chemicals.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.260
 And then there's adrenaline or epinephrine

18:15.260 --> 18:18.920
 released at particular organs and acts in particular ways.

18:18.920 --> 18:20.200
 We're going down into the weeds here.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.440
 So just stay with me

18:21.440 --> 18:22.680
 because it's going to make a lot of sense

18:22.680 --> 18:25.360
 and you will appreciate having this knowledge in hand.

18:25.360 --> 18:29.260
 That epinephrine acts in two different ways.

18:29.260 --> 18:34.220
 Some things like the muscles of your legs and your heart

18:34.220 --> 18:36.220
 and other things that need to be active

18:36.220 --> 18:40.400
 when you're stressed, they have a certain kind of receptor

18:40.400 --> 18:43.540
 which is called the beta receptor.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.740
 And that beta receptor responds to epinephrine

18:45.740 --> 18:48.580
 and blood vessels dilate, they get bigger

18:48.580 --> 18:50.980
 and blood rushes in to our legs.

18:50.980 --> 18:53.000
 The heart rate speeds up.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.300
 Lots of things happen that get activated.

18:55.300 --> 18:59.180
 And at the same time that epinephrine activates

18:59.180 --> 19:02.740
 other receptors on certain tissues that we don't need

19:02.740 --> 19:06.220
 the ones involved in digestion, reproduction

19:06.220 --> 19:09.100
 and things of that sort that are luxuries

19:09.100 --> 19:10.680
 for when things are going well

19:10.680 --> 19:13.340
 not things to pay attention to when we're stressed.

19:13.340 --> 19:15.600
 And that binds to other receptors

19:15.600 --> 19:17.780
 that contract the blood vessels.

19:17.780 --> 19:19.900
 So basically the stress response

19:19.900 --> 19:21.020
 this is the key phrase here.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.060
 The stress response A is generic.

19:23.060 --> 19:24.360
 I said that before.

19:24.360 --> 19:29.360
 And B it basically pushes certain systems to be activated

19:30.340 --> 19:33.180
 and other systems to not be activated.

19:33.180 --> 19:35.340
 So the stress response is two-pronged.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.240
 It's a yes for certain things.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.140
 And it's a no you may not right now for other things.

19:40.140 --> 19:41.620
 So that's the key thing to understand

19:41.620 --> 19:42.620
 about the stress response.

19:42.620 --> 19:43.980
 That's why your heart speeds up.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.860
 That's why you feel blood in certain organs

19:46.860 --> 19:49.100
 and tissues of your body, but not in others.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.060
 That's why your throat goes dry

19:51.060 --> 19:54.800
 because it turns out that when you get stressed

19:54.800 --> 19:56.620
 the salivary glands are shut down.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.300
 There's a lot less blood flow to the neurons

19:59.300 --> 20:01.220
 that control salivation.

20:01.220 --> 20:02.740
 And so you're gonna start swallowing.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.580
 You feel like your throat is getting dry.

20:04.580 --> 20:05.740
 There are a lot of different effects.

20:05.740 --> 20:07.000
 I'm not gonna list them all off

20:07.000 --> 20:09.780
 but basically you are activated

20:09.780 --> 20:12.220
 in ways that support you moving.

20:12.220 --> 20:13.160
 So that's the third thing.

20:13.160 --> 20:14.600
 It's first of all, it's generic.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.660
 Second of all, the stress response activates certain things

20:17.660 --> 20:19.740
 and shuts down other features of our body.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.300
 And then it's a sense of agitation

20:22.300 --> 20:23.940
 that makes you wanna move.

20:23.940 --> 20:27.060
 And that's because fundamentally the stress response

20:27.060 --> 20:30.620
 is just this generic thing that says, do something.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.020
 And movement in this case can either be the bias

20:33.020 --> 20:35.380
 to move in terms of action

20:35.380 --> 20:38.540
 or it can be the bias to say something.

20:38.540 --> 20:41.880
 When we are stressed, we are more likely to say something

20:41.880 --> 20:43.620
 that probably we shouldn't say.

20:43.620 --> 20:46.100
 We are more likely to move.

20:46.100 --> 20:47.560
 And if you're trying to suppress movement

20:47.560 --> 20:49.580
 you'll feel that as a tremor.

20:49.580 --> 20:50.840
 You're gonna feel agitated

20:50.840 --> 20:53.300
 and that's because it was designed to move you.

20:53.300 --> 20:57.680
 So this is important because if you wanna control stress

20:57.680 --> 21:01.180
 you need to learn how to work with that agitation.

21:02.580 --> 21:05.340
 I'd like to give you a tool at this point

21:05.340 --> 21:08.040
 because I think if we go any further

21:08.040 --> 21:11.060
 with a lot more science, people are gonna begin to wonder

21:11.060 --> 21:12.700
 if this is just gonna be a kind of standard

21:12.700 --> 21:14.780
 university lecture about the stress response.

21:14.780 --> 21:17.400
 I'm gonna give you more science about the stress response

21:17.400 --> 21:19.780
 but I want to take what we now already know

21:19.780 --> 21:23.700
 about the stress response and use that

21:23.700 --> 21:28.540
 as a framework for thinking about how one might reduce

21:28.540 --> 21:32.380
 or even eliminate the stress response quickly in real time

21:32.380 --> 21:34.100
 should it arise when we don't want it.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.380
 So we're taking the podium

21:35.380 --> 21:37.860
 or we're sitting down at a Zoom call

21:37.860 --> 21:39.960
 and all of a sudden we're feeling flushed.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.640
 We're feeling like our heart is racing.

21:41.640 --> 21:43.180
 We're feeling a little too alert.

21:43.180 --> 21:47.620
 We're feeling a little worked up and we wanna calm down.

21:47.620 --> 21:52.380
 As far as I am aware of the best tools

21:52.380 --> 21:56.900
 to reduce stress quickly, so-called real-time tools

21:56.900 --> 22:00.580
 are going to be tools that have a direct line

22:00.580 --> 22:02.760
 to the so-called autonomic nervous system.

22:02.760 --> 22:05.020
 The autonomic nervous system is a name given

22:05.020 --> 22:07.660
 to the kind of general features of alertness

22:07.660 --> 22:09.220
 or calmness in the body.

22:09.220 --> 22:11.220
 It's typically, it means automatic

22:11.220 --> 22:12.780
 although we do have some control over it.

22:12.780 --> 22:16.020
 Certain what so-called levers or entry points.

22:16.020 --> 22:18.660
 Here's what doesn't work to control stress,

22:18.660 --> 22:20.420
 telling yourself to calm down.

22:20.420 --> 22:23.140
 In fact, that tends to just exacerbate stress.

22:23.140 --> 22:24.460
 Telling someone else to calm down

22:24.460 --> 22:26.480
 also tends to exacerbate their stress.

22:27.380 --> 22:31.320
 If you want to reduce the magnitude of the stress response,

22:31.320 --> 22:33.100
 the best thing you can do

22:33.100 --> 22:36.020
 is activate the other system in the body

22:36.020 --> 22:39.700
 which is designed for calming and relaxation.

22:39.700 --> 22:43.740
 And that system is called the parasympathetic nervous system

22:43.740 --> 22:45.080
 because as I mentioned before,

22:45.080 --> 22:46.400
 the neurons that control stress

22:46.400 --> 22:48.680
 run from about your neck to your navel.

22:48.680 --> 22:51.540
 The parasympathetic neurons, para just means near,

22:51.540 --> 22:54.660
 exist in, they are some of the cranial nerves.

22:54.660 --> 22:57.420
 So it's kind of neck and lower brainstem,

22:57.420 --> 22:59.460
 kind of back of the brain and in the neck

22:59.460 --> 23:01.540
 and in the pelvic area.

23:01.540 --> 23:03.820
 And the parasympathetic nervous system

23:03.820 --> 23:07.780
 is really interesting because especially the cranial nerves,

23:07.780 --> 23:11.860
 the ones that are up in the brainstem and in the neck area,

23:11.860 --> 23:16.180
 those have a direct line to various features of your face.

23:16.180 --> 23:17.980
 In particular, the eyes,

23:17.980 --> 23:21.460
 they control things like eye movements, pupil dilation,

23:21.460 --> 23:22.660
 things of that sort,

23:22.660 --> 23:25.800
 as well as the tongue, the facial muscles, et cetera.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.360
 The parasympathetic nervous system,

23:27.360 --> 23:28.840
 many people don't realize this,

23:28.840 --> 23:32.420
 is the system by which we control the face and the eyes

23:32.420 --> 23:34.740
 and to some extent our airway, the trachea.

23:34.740 --> 23:39.740
 And it's these neurons that reside within the pelvic area.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.140
 Now, the neurons within the pelvic area

23:42.140 --> 23:45.380
 are involved in control of the genitals,

23:45.380 --> 23:47.600
 the bladder and the rectum.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.420
 And those don't have a direct line.

23:50.420 --> 23:52.740
 You don't have a direct way to control those.

23:52.740 --> 23:54.660
 It actually has to go from brain to spinal cord

23:54.660 --> 23:56.120
 and then out to those organs.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.660
 Whereas the parasympathetic nervous system

23:58.660 --> 24:02.700
 has certain entry points or what I'll call levers, right,

24:02.700 --> 24:05.380
 that will allow you to push back on the stress response

24:05.380 --> 24:07.460
 in real time and diminish it

24:07.460 --> 24:09.280
 and feel more relaxed really quickly.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.500
 So I'm going to teach you the first tool now

24:11.500 --> 24:13.840
 so I don't overwhelm you with all this academic knowledge

24:13.840 --> 24:15.940
 without giving you something useful.

24:15.940 --> 24:19.180
 And the tool that, at least to my knowledge,

24:19.180 --> 24:23.900
 is the fastest and most thoroughly grounded

24:23.900 --> 24:25.460
 in physiology and neuroscience

24:25.460 --> 24:28.380
 for calming down in a self-directed way

24:28.380 --> 24:32.220
 is what's called the physiological PSI, S-I-G-H.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.180
 Now, some of you might have heard me talk about this

24:34.180 --> 24:36.940
 on previous podcasts, but I'm going to explain this

24:36.940 --> 24:40.380
 in the context of how respiration in general

24:40.380 --> 24:42.860
 is used to calm us down.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.620
 And it turns out you're all doing this all the time,

24:44.620 --> 24:47.020
 but you are doing it involuntarily.

24:47.020 --> 24:49.180
 And when you stress, you tend to forget

24:49.180 --> 24:52.420
 that you can also activate these systems voluntarily.

24:52.420 --> 24:54.980
 This is an extremely powerful set of techniques

24:54.980 --> 24:57.500
 that we know from scientific studies

24:57.500 --> 24:58.560
 that are being done in my lab,

24:58.560 --> 25:03.560
 Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA, and others now that are very,

25:03.660 --> 25:07.260
 very useful for reducing your stress response in real time.

25:07.260 --> 25:08.480
 And here's how they work.

25:08.480 --> 25:10.980
 These days, there seems to be a lot of interest

25:10.980 --> 25:12.180
 in breath work.

25:12.180 --> 25:15.140
 Breath work typically is when you go and you sit down

25:15.140 --> 25:17.420
 or you lie down and you deliberately breathe

25:17.420 --> 25:19.940
 in a particular way for a series of minutes

25:19.940 --> 25:22.620
 in order to shift your physiology, access some states.

25:22.620 --> 25:25.340
 And it does have some utility that we're going to talk about.

25:25.340 --> 25:27.900
 That is not what I'm talking about now.

25:27.900 --> 25:30.920
 What I'm talking about when I refer to physiological size

25:30.920 --> 25:35.860
 is the very real medical school textbook relationship

25:35.860 --> 25:39.560
 between the brain, the body,

25:39.560 --> 25:43.020
 and the body as it relates to the breathing apparatus,

25:43.020 --> 25:46.300
 meaning the diaphragm and lungs, and the heart.

25:46.300 --> 25:48.580
 Let's take the hallmark of the stress response.

25:48.580 --> 25:50.180
 The heart starts beating faster.

25:50.180 --> 25:52.020
 Blood is shuttled to the big muscles of the body

25:52.020 --> 25:55.460
 to move you away from whatever it is the stressor is

25:55.460 --> 25:57.260
 or just make you feel like you need to move

25:57.260 --> 26:00.020
 or talk, your face goes flushed, et cetera.

26:00.020 --> 26:03.260
 Heart rate, many of us feel is involuntary,

26:03.260 --> 26:05.580
 just kind of functions whether or not we're moving fast

26:05.580 --> 26:06.420
 or moving slow.

26:06.420 --> 26:09.540
 If you think about it, it's not really purely autonomic

26:09.540 --> 26:11.940
 because you can speed up your heart rate by running

26:11.940 --> 26:15.780
 or you can slow it down by slowing down by your run.

26:15.780 --> 26:17.740
 You can move to a walk or lie down,

26:17.740 --> 26:19.800
 but that's indirect control.

26:19.800 --> 26:22.180
 There is, however, a way in which you can breathe

26:22.180 --> 26:24.020
 that directly controls your heart rate

26:24.020 --> 26:27.140
 through the interactions between the sympathetic

26:27.140 --> 26:29.600
 and the parasympathetic nervous system.

26:29.600 --> 26:31.340
 Here's how it works.

26:31.340 --> 26:34.980
 When you inhale, so whether or not it's through the nose

26:34.980 --> 26:38.340
 or through the mouth, this skeletal muscle

26:38.340 --> 26:43.280
 that's inside your body called the diaphragm, it moves down.

26:43.280 --> 26:44.900
 And that's because the lungs expand,

26:44.900 --> 26:46.300
 the diaphragm moves down.

26:47.160 --> 26:49.020
 Your heart actually gets a little bit bigger

26:49.020 --> 26:50.420
 in that expanded space.

26:50.420 --> 26:51.820
 There's more space for the heart.

26:51.820 --> 26:53.340
 So I'm not talking about your emotional heart

26:53.340 --> 26:55.060
 getting bigger, I'm talking about your actual

26:55.060 --> 26:56.860
 physical heart getting a little bit bigger.

26:56.860 --> 26:57.860
 The volume grows.

26:57.860 --> 27:00.900
 And as a consequence, whatever blood is in there

27:00.900 --> 27:05.420
 is now at a lower volume or moving a little bit more slowly

27:05.420 --> 27:10.220
 in that larger volume than it was before you inhaled.

27:10.220 --> 27:12.060
 Okay, so more space, heart gets bigger,

27:12.060 --> 27:14.560
 blood moves more slowly, and there's a little group

27:14.560 --> 27:18.340
 of neurons called the sinoatrial node in the heart

27:18.340 --> 27:21.100
 that registers, believe it or not, those neurons

27:21.100 --> 27:24.500
 pay attention to the rate of blood flow through the heart

27:24.500 --> 27:27.260
 and send a signal up to the brain

27:27.260 --> 27:29.700
 that blood is moving more slowly through the heart.

27:30.620 --> 27:33.340
 The brain then sends a signal back to the heart

27:33.340 --> 27:35.180
 to speed the heart up.

27:35.180 --> 27:38.820
 So what this means is if you want your heart to beat faster,

27:38.820 --> 27:43.820
 inhale longer, inhale more vigorously than your exhales.

27:45.940 --> 27:48.560
 Now, there are a variety of ways that one could do that,

27:48.560 --> 27:50.140
 but it doesn't matter if it's through the nose

27:50.140 --> 27:50.960
 or through the mouth.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.780
 If your inhales are longer than your exhales,

27:52.780 --> 27:54.820
 you're speeding up your heart.

27:54.820 --> 27:56.220
 If your inhales are more vigorous,

27:56.220 --> 27:58.580
 so even if your inhales are shorter than your exhales,

27:58.580 --> 28:00.940
 you are speeding up your heart rate.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.420
 Now, the opposite is also true.

28:02.420 --> 28:04.360
 If you want to slow your heart rate down,

28:04.360 --> 28:05.980
 so stress response hits,

28:05.980 --> 28:08.240
 you want to slow your heart rate down,

28:09.140 --> 28:12.080
 what you want to do is again capitalize on this relationship

28:12.080 --> 28:14.380
 between the body, meaning the diaphragm

28:14.380 --> 28:15.740
 in the heart and the brain.

28:15.740 --> 28:16.580
 Here's how it works.

28:16.580 --> 28:20.440
 When you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,

28:20.440 --> 28:22.740
 which makes the heart a little bit smaller.

28:22.740 --> 28:24.220
 It actually gets a little more compact.

28:24.220 --> 28:27.580
 Blood flows more quickly through that compact space,

28:27.580 --> 28:30.500
 sort of like it's just a pipe getting smaller.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.240
 The sinoatrial node registers

28:32.240 --> 28:33.620
 that blood is going more quickly,

28:33.620 --> 28:36.080
 sends a signal up to the brain,

28:36.080 --> 28:38.280
 and the parasympathetic nervous system,

28:38.280 --> 28:40.160
 some neurons in your brainstem,

28:40.160 --> 28:44.180
 send a signal back to the heart to slow the heart down.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.700
 So if you want to calm down quickly,

28:46.700 --> 28:49.820
 you need to make your exhales longer

28:49.820 --> 28:53.200
 and or more vigorous than your inhales.

28:53.200 --> 28:55.260
 Now, the reason this is so attractive

28:55.260 --> 28:57.620
 as a tool for controlling stress

28:57.620 --> 29:00.400
 is that it works in real time.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.680
 This doesn't involve a practice that you have to go

29:02.680 --> 29:05.320
 and sit there and do anything separate from life.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.180
 And we are going to get to emotion.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.980
 Emotions and stress happen in real time.

29:09.980 --> 29:12.720
 And so while it's wonderful to have a breathwork practice

29:12.720 --> 29:14.980
 or to have the opportunity to get a massage

29:14.980 --> 29:17.300
 or sit in a sauna or do whatever it is that you do

29:17.300 --> 29:19.420
 in order to set your stress controls

29:19.420 --> 29:20.600
 in the right direction,

29:20.600 --> 29:22.940
 having tools that you can reach to in real time

29:22.940 --> 29:24.360
 that require no learning,

29:24.360 --> 29:26.800
 I mean, I had to teach it to you, you had to learn that,

29:26.800 --> 29:28.280
 but it doesn't require any plasticity

29:28.280 --> 29:29.660
 to activate these pathways.

29:29.660 --> 29:31.200
 So if you're feeling stressed,

29:31.200 --> 29:32.860
 you still need to inhale, of course,

29:32.860 --> 29:35.600
 but you need to lengthen your exhales.

29:37.020 --> 29:40.160
 Now, there's a tool that capitalizes on this

29:40.160 --> 29:42.960
 in a kind of unique way, a kind of a twist,

29:42.960 --> 29:44.660
 which is the physiological psi.

29:44.660 --> 29:47.200
 The physiological psi was discovered in the 30s.

29:47.200 --> 29:50.500
 It's now been explored at the neurobiological level

29:50.500 --> 29:52.700
 and mechanistically in far more detail

29:52.700 --> 29:55.100
 by Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA,

29:55.100 --> 29:57.820
 also Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford.

29:57.820 --> 30:00.580
 And the physiological psi is something

30:00.580 --> 30:02.180
 that humans and animals do

30:02.180 --> 30:04.640
 anytime they are about to fall asleep.

30:05.620 --> 30:08.100
 You also do it throughout sleep from time to time

30:08.100 --> 30:10.260
 when carbon dioxide, which we'll talk about in a moment,

30:10.260 --> 30:12.260
 builds up too much in your system.

30:12.260 --> 30:14.300
 And the physiological psi is something

30:14.300 --> 30:15.980
 that people naturally start doing

30:15.980 --> 30:17.140
 when they've been crying

30:17.140 --> 30:20.180
 and they're trying to recover some air or calm down,

30:20.180 --> 30:22.060
 when they've been sobbing very hard,

30:22.060 --> 30:24.440
 or when they are in claustrophobic environments.

30:24.440 --> 30:27.500
 However, the amazing thing about this thing

30:27.500 --> 30:29.380
 that we call the diaphragm, the skeletal muscle,

30:29.380 --> 30:30.780
 is that it's an internal organ

30:30.780 --> 30:32.320
 that you can control voluntarily,

30:32.320 --> 30:36.180
 unlike your spleen or your heart or your pancreas,

30:36.180 --> 30:37.020
 where you can't just say,

30:37.020 --> 30:38.260
 oh, I want to make my pancreas

30:38.260 --> 30:39.660
 turn out a little more insulin right now.

30:39.660 --> 30:41.680
 I'm just going to do that with my mind directly.

30:41.680 --> 30:42.520
 You can't do that.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.420
 You could do that by smelling

30:43.420 --> 30:44.860
 a really good donut or something,

30:44.860 --> 30:46.700
 but you can't just do it directly.

30:46.700 --> 30:50.620
 You can move your diaphragm intentionally, right?

30:50.620 --> 30:51.860
 You can do it anytime you want,

30:51.860 --> 30:54.020
 and it'll run in the background

30:54.020 --> 30:54.920
 if you're not thinking about it.

30:54.920 --> 30:59.140
 So this incredible pathway that goes from brain to diaphragm

30:59.140 --> 31:00.600
 through what's called the phrenic nerve,

31:00.600 --> 31:03.220
 P-H-R-E-N-I-C, phrenic.

31:03.220 --> 31:05.900
 The phrenic nerve innervates the diaphragm.

31:05.900 --> 31:07.340
 You can control anytime you want.

31:07.340 --> 31:09.800
 You can double up your inhales or triple up your inhales.

31:09.800 --> 31:11.960
 You can exhale more than your inhales,

31:11.960 --> 31:13.580
 whatever you want to do.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.820
 It's such an incredible organ.

31:14.820 --> 31:16.940
 And the physiological side

31:16.940 --> 31:18.720
 is something that we do spontaneously,

31:18.720 --> 31:20.660
 but when you're feeling stressed,

31:20.660 --> 31:22.860
 you can do a double inhale,

31:22.860 --> 31:27.520
 nnnn, nnnn, nnnn, nnnn, nnnn, nnnn, nnnn, nnnn, nnnn,

31:27.520 --> 31:28.420
 long exhale.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.900
 Now, I just told you a minute ago

31:29.900 --> 31:31.900
 that if you inhale more than you exhale,

31:31.900 --> 31:33.580
 you're going to speed the heart rate up,

31:33.580 --> 31:36.100
 which would promote more stress and activation.

31:36.100 --> 31:38.380
 Now I'm telling you to do a double inhale exhale

31:38.380 --> 31:40.040
 in order to calm down.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.980
 And the reason is the double inhale exhale,

31:42.980 --> 31:44.860
 which is the physiological side,

31:46.320 --> 31:48.980
 takes advantage of the fact that when we do a double inhale,

31:48.980 --> 31:50.780
 even if the second inhale is sneaking in

31:50.780 --> 31:52.220
 just a tiny bit more air,

31:52.220 --> 31:54.720
 cause it's kind of hard to get too deep inhales back to back

31:54.720 --> 31:56.740
 you do big, deep inhale and then another little one

31:56.740 --> 31:57.820
 sneaking it in.

31:57.820 --> 32:00.660
 The little sacs in your lungs, the avioli of the lungs,

32:00.660 --> 32:02.060
 your lungs aren't just two big bags,

32:02.060 --> 32:03.780
 but you've got millions of little sacs

32:03.780 --> 32:06.500
 throughout the lungs that actually make the surface area

32:06.500 --> 32:08.640
 of your lungs as big as a tennis court.

32:08.640 --> 32:11.080
 It's amazing if we were to just spread that out.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.160
 Those tend to collapse as we get stressed

32:14.160 --> 32:17.320
 and carbon dioxide builds up in our bloodstream.

32:17.320 --> 32:20.340
 And that's one of the reasons we feel agitated as well.

32:20.340 --> 32:22.780
 So, and it makes us very jittery.

32:22.780 --> 32:24.600
 I mean, there's some other effects of carbon dioxide

32:24.600 --> 32:25.700
 I don't want to get into,

32:25.700 --> 32:27.980
 but when you do the double inhale exhale,

32:27.980 --> 32:31.100
 the double inhale reinflates those little sacs of the lungs.

32:31.100 --> 32:33.780
 And then when you do the long exhale,

32:33.780 --> 32:36.920
 that long exhale is now much more effective

32:36.920 --> 32:40.280
 at ridding your body and bloodstream of carbon dioxide,

32:40.280 --> 32:42.540
 which relaxes you very quickly.

32:42.540 --> 32:46.120
 My lab in collaboration with David Spiegel's lab,

32:46.120 --> 32:49.100
 David's the associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford

32:49.100 --> 32:50.540
 are doing a study right now,

32:50.540 --> 32:53.000
 exploring how physiological size

32:53.000 --> 32:55.640
 and other patterns of breathing done deliberately

32:55.640 --> 32:57.340
 can modulate the stress response

32:57.340 --> 32:59.220
 and other things related to emotionality.

32:59.220 --> 33:00.620
 Those work are ongoing.

33:00.620 --> 33:02.700
 I want to be clear, those studies aren't done,

33:02.700 --> 33:06.180
 but it's very clear from work in our labs,

33:06.180 --> 33:09.000
 from working with Jack Feldman's lab and others,

33:09.000 --> 33:14.000
 that the physiological sigh is the fastest hardwired way

33:14.480 --> 33:17.900
 for us to eliminate this stressful response in our body

33:17.900 --> 33:19.660
 quickly in real time.

33:19.660 --> 33:22.300
 And so I'm excited to give you this tool

33:22.300 --> 33:24.700
 because I think most people have heard

33:24.700 --> 33:26.240
 that mindfulness and meditation is good,

33:26.240 --> 33:27.380
 exercise is good for us,

33:27.380 --> 33:29.560
 we all need to be getting enough sleep, et cetera,

33:29.560 --> 33:30.940
 but life happens.

33:30.940 --> 33:33.220
 And when you find yourself in a position

33:33.220 --> 33:35.180
 where you are more alert and activated

33:35.180 --> 33:36.240
 than you would like to be,

33:36.240 --> 33:37.980
 regardless of whether or not the stressor

33:37.980 --> 33:41.300
 is relationship-based or it's financial

33:41.300 --> 33:44.980
 or it's physical or anything like that,

33:44.980 --> 33:46.900
 you can look to the physiological side

33:46.900 --> 33:50.260
 because it bypasses a very important feature

33:50.260 --> 33:51.100
 of how we function,

33:51.100 --> 33:53.900
 which is that it's very hard to control the mind

33:53.900 --> 33:54.800
 with the mind,

33:54.800 --> 33:59.420
 especially when we are in heightened states of activation.

33:59.420 --> 34:01.740
 When we are very alert or very sleepy,

34:01.740 --> 34:05.060
 it is very hard to use these so-called top-down mechanisms

34:05.060 --> 34:08.820
 of intention and gratitude and all these things

34:08.820 --> 34:10.700
 that are really powerful tools

34:10.700 --> 34:13.580
 when we are not super activated and stressed

34:13.580 --> 34:15.300
 or not super tired.

34:15.300 --> 34:17.800
 But when we are anywhere in the range

34:17.800 --> 34:20.580
 of very alert and stressed to very sleepy,

34:20.580 --> 34:22.820
 physiological sides are a powerful way

34:22.820 --> 34:25.860
 of bringing our level of so-called autonomic activation,

34:25.860 --> 34:28.180
 which just means our level of alertness down.

34:28.180 --> 34:29.980
 And so whether or not it's in line at the bank

34:29.980 --> 34:32.460
 or whether or not you're wearing a mask nowadays

34:32.460 --> 34:35.600
 or you're not, whatever the conditions may be

34:35.600 --> 34:37.300
 where you're at and your needs,

34:37.300 --> 34:39.300
 when you're feeling stressed,

34:39.300 --> 34:42.340
 the physiological side done just one to three times,

34:42.340 --> 34:43.700
 so it'd be double inhale, exhale,

34:43.700 --> 34:46.040
 double inhale, exhale, maybe just two times,

34:46.040 --> 34:50.820
 will bring down your level of stress very, very fast.

34:50.820 --> 34:51.660
 And as far as I know,

34:51.660 --> 34:54.160
 it's the fastest way to accomplish that.

34:54.160 --> 34:57.300
 An important note about the physiological side

34:57.300 --> 34:59.420
 or exhale emphasized breathing

34:59.420 --> 35:04.420
 for lowering the stress response, many people worry

35:05.100 --> 35:08.620
 that their heart rate does not come down fast enough.

35:09.500 --> 35:10.340
 I want to tell you,

35:10.340 --> 35:13.560
 you do not want your heart rate to reduce very fast.

35:13.560 --> 35:16.220
 There's actually something called the vasovagal response

35:16.220 --> 35:17.320
 where people will stand up

35:17.320 --> 35:18.340
 or they'll get up in the middle of the night

35:18.340 --> 35:20.560
 to use the bathroom and then all of a sudden they'll collapse,

35:20.560 --> 35:21.400
 they'll faint.

35:22.260 --> 35:24.820
 That's because the heart rate was reduced too much.

35:24.820 --> 35:26.100
 Some people will see blood

35:26.100 --> 35:29.640
 or they'll see something really troubling and stressful

35:29.640 --> 35:30.800
 and they'll pass out.

35:30.800 --> 35:33.380
 That's an over-activation

35:33.380 --> 35:35.520
 or an acceleration of the calming response.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.460
 They're not so stressed

35:36.460 --> 35:39.140
 that they kind of fall off the cliff of stress.

35:39.140 --> 35:41.900
 They get so stressed that the rebound mechanism

35:41.900 --> 35:45.580
 for calming themselves down goes too high, too fast.

35:45.580 --> 35:48.420
 They calm down too fast and they collapse and faint.

35:48.420 --> 35:49.660
 And so be aware

35:49.660 --> 35:51.660
 that if you're going to use the physiological side

35:51.660 --> 35:54.480
 or exhale emphasize breathing to calm down,

35:54.480 --> 35:57.420
 that your heart rate will take about 20 to 30 seconds

35:57.420 --> 35:59.300
 to come down to baseline.

35:59.300 --> 36:00.380
 And you may need to repeat

36:00.380 --> 36:02.260
 the physiological side a few times.

36:02.260 --> 36:04.420
 So that's an important note

36:04.420 --> 36:08.140
 about the use of breathing to control levels of stress.

36:08.140 --> 36:10.620
 The other thing is that

36:10.620 --> 36:15.520
 when you decide to look to the body to control the mind,

36:15.520 --> 36:17.580
 it does something else that's very powerful.

36:17.580 --> 36:19.840
 When you are stressed in your mind and body,

36:19.840 --> 36:23.060
 so you're feeling really agitated, activated and worried

36:23.060 --> 36:26.040
 and you use a tool like the physiological sigh

36:26.040 --> 36:28.060
 or exhale emphasize breathing,

36:28.060 --> 36:30.820
 you will notice that then your brain and your mind

36:30.820 --> 36:32.140
 becomes more available

36:32.140 --> 36:34.840
 for controlling the stress response and reacting to it,

36:34.840 --> 36:38.620
 which is great because the sweet spot in life is to be,

36:38.620 --> 36:39.900
 provided you're not trying to sleep,

36:39.900 --> 36:41.620
 is to be alert and calm.

36:41.620 --> 36:43.560
 And so that's the idea is to be alert and calm

36:43.560 --> 36:47.460
 and to bring you back into that sort of plane of alertness.

36:48.500 --> 36:50.420
 For those of you that have trouble sleeping

36:50.420 --> 36:52.460
 or just relaxing through the day,

36:52.460 --> 36:54.700
 the physiological side can be repeated

36:54.700 --> 36:57.360
 for 10, 15 cycles if you like.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.940
 Some people find that it actually puts them to sleep.

36:59.940 --> 37:01.860
 So if they lie down and they're reading

37:01.860 --> 37:03.000
 and they do too many of these,

37:03.000 --> 37:04.260
 that actually can put them to sleep.

37:04.260 --> 37:07.220
 And what you'll find is that most breath work protocols,

37:07.220 --> 37:09.620
 the kind of stuff that's done away from real life

37:09.620 --> 37:10.980
 that you set aside time

37:10.980 --> 37:13.480
 and decide to do quote unquote breath work,

37:13.480 --> 37:17.520
 most of that works such that if you're doing inhales

37:17.520 --> 37:19.260
 that are longer and more vigorous than exhales,

37:19.260 --> 37:20.860
 it tends to be activating and alert you.

37:20.860 --> 37:23.220
 And if you're doing exhales that are longer

37:23.220 --> 37:24.380
 or more vigorous than the inhales,

37:24.380 --> 37:25.360
 it tends to put you to sleep.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.540
 And many of the protocols that are out there

37:27.540 --> 37:30.900
 from laboratories and that populate the internet

37:30.900 --> 37:32.560
 and wellness sites and whatnot,

37:32.560 --> 37:34.100
 if it's exhale-emphasized breathing,

37:34.100 --> 37:35.900
 oftentimes has been used as a tool

37:35.900 --> 37:37.980
 for trying to teach people to fall asleep.

37:37.980 --> 37:39.460
 Physiological side is a little different.

37:39.460 --> 37:40.740
 It's designed to be used in real time.

37:40.740 --> 37:42.740
 Just think of it as just kind of in your kit

37:42.740 --> 37:46.140
 of things that you can do as life happens

37:46.140 --> 37:48.340
 and as you need to react to life.

37:48.340 --> 37:49.960
 A note about nasal versus mouth breathing.

37:49.960 --> 37:53.260
 There's a plethora of information out there now

37:53.260 --> 37:54.600
 because of James Nestor's book,

37:54.600 --> 37:57.380
 Breath, the New Science of a Lost Art,

37:57.380 --> 37:59.460
 which came out this last year, excellent book,

37:59.460 --> 38:02.460
 as well as Jaws, which is from Sandra Kahn,

38:02.460 --> 38:05.300
 Paul Ehrlich with a forward by Jared Diamond

38:05.300 --> 38:07.580
 and Robert Sapolsky.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.620
 So a collection of people from Stanford,

38:09.620 --> 38:11.980
 Jared Diamond's not at Stanford, but the rest are.

38:11.980 --> 38:13.920
 And some heavy hitters on that book,

38:13.920 --> 38:16.540
 which is about the benefits of nasal breathing.

38:16.540 --> 38:19.060
 And in many cases, nasal breathing is more advantageous

38:19.060 --> 38:20.780
 than mouth breathing for all sorts of things,

38:20.780 --> 38:24.060
 cosmetic features of the face, especially in kids,

38:24.060 --> 38:26.400
 warding off infection, et cetera.

38:26.400 --> 38:29.220
 With the physiological side, the best way to do it

38:29.220 --> 38:30.700
 would be double inhale through the nose,

38:30.700 --> 38:31.640
 exhale through the mouth.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.260
 But if you can't and you can only do that

38:33.260 --> 38:34.880
 through your mouth, just do it through your mouth.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.340
 If you want to do all through your nose,

38:36.340 --> 38:38.300
 do it through your nose.

38:38.300 --> 38:41.060
 This anchors back to some underlying neurology

38:41.060 --> 38:43.300
 or neuroscience.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.720
 So for those of you that want to know,

38:44.720 --> 38:46.060
 you have two breathing centers,

38:46.060 --> 38:47.940
 one that's involved in rhythmic breathing

38:47.940 --> 38:49.380
 for inhales followed by exhales,

38:49.380 --> 38:50.860
 followed by inhales, followed by exhales.

38:50.860 --> 38:53.420
 The so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus

38:53.420 --> 38:55.020
 named after a bottle of wine

38:55.020 --> 38:57.020
 and discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.

38:57.020 --> 38:59.540
 And a nearby nucleus called the parafacial nucleus

38:59.540 --> 39:02.620
 also discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.

39:02.620 --> 39:04.900
 And the parafacial nucleus is involved

39:04.900 --> 39:06.620
 in anytime you double up the inhales

39:06.620 --> 39:07.840
 or double up the exhales.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.740
 It was designed so that you could breathe

39:09.740 --> 39:11.780
 while you're speaking, because you can't always go

39:11.780 --> 39:14.140
 inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale when you're speaking.

39:14.140 --> 39:17.000
 So I tell you this not to overwhelm you with knowledge,

39:17.000 --> 39:19.460
 but just know that when you double up your inhales

39:19.460 --> 39:20.500
 or you double up your exhales,

39:20.500 --> 39:22.700
 you are activating this parafacial nucleus

39:22.700 --> 39:25.020
 and it has other cool effects

39:25.020 --> 39:27.020
 because it's located near the neurons

39:27.020 --> 39:28.500
 that control the face.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.740
 It also has a tendency to relax the jaw.

39:30.740 --> 39:32.180
 There's some interplay between the neurons

39:32.180 --> 39:34.660
 that control the speaking stuff

39:34.660 --> 39:35.840
 and the stuff for your tongue.

39:35.840 --> 39:38.220
 So all of a sudden, when we do this physiological side,

39:38.220 --> 39:40.040
 we tap into neural circuitry

39:40.040 --> 39:42.600
 that allows us to speak more clearly,

39:42.600 --> 39:44.740
 to control the muscles of the face and jaw.

39:44.740 --> 39:46.400
 Maybe that means not saying certain things

39:46.400 --> 39:50.100
 when we're stressed and just generally to relax.

39:50.100 --> 39:53.520
 And so this brings us back to the neuroscience

39:53.520 --> 39:55.580
 of this parasympathetic nervous system,

39:55.580 --> 39:59.960
 this calming system that's been genetically encoded into us

39:59.960 --> 40:02.540
 that we all have regardless of who our parents are,

40:02.540 --> 40:05.060
 which is that the neurons that control all this stuff,

40:05.060 --> 40:09.460
 the face, the eyes, et cetera, are all working together.

40:09.460 --> 40:11.040
 And that's why when we get stressed,

40:11.040 --> 40:13.180
 it's hard for us to speak or we tend to jitter

40:13.180 --> 40:14.060
 and these kinds of things,

40:14.060 --> 40:15.980
 just like all the neurons that cause stress

40:15.980 --> 40:17.720
 in the center of the spinal cord are working together

40:17.720 --> 40:19.740
 to get our body activated.

40:19.740 --> 40:20.980
 Okay, a lot of science today.

40:20.980 --> 40:23.240
 You've now got the physiological sigh as a tool.

40:23.240 --> 40:24.780
 You know that exhale-emphasized breathing

40:24.780 --> 40:26.780
 will slow your heart down

40:26.780 --> 40:31.260
 and inhale-emphasized breathing will speed your heart up.

40:31.260 --> 40:33.660
 So let's think about something now.

40:33.660 --> 40:35.620
 Let's think about stress

40:35.620 --> 40:38.700
 from not whether or not it's acute or chronic,

40:38.700 --> 40:40.220
 whether or not it's good for us or bad for us,

40:40.220 --> 40:42.380
 but on three different timescales,

40:42.380 --> 40:46.280
 because then we can arrive at what this is all about

40:46.280 --> 40:47.620
 as it relates to emotions,

40:47.620 --> 40:51.260
 because trust me, this has everything to do with emotions

40:51.260 --> 40:53.740
 and whether or not you're functioning well emotionally

40:53.740 --> 40:55.380
 or you're not functioning well emotionally,

40:55.380 --> 40:57.420
 whether or not you're coping or not coping.

40:57.420 --> 40:59.580
 So those are typically psychological terms

40:59.580 --> 41:00.940
 and psychological discussions.

41:00.940 --> 41:03.620
 We are entering this through the portal of physiology,

41:03.620 --> 41:05.180
 the stuff of medical textbooks,

41:05.180 --> 41:08.360
 and we will arrive at the psychology soon,

41:08.360 --> 41:10.100
 but I really want you to understand the difference

41:10.100 --> 41:12.980
 between the three kinds of stress

41:12.980 --> 41:14.420
 on three different timescales,

41:14.420 --> 41:16.980
 short-term, medium-term, and long-term,

41:16.980 --> 41:19.920
 and what it's good for and what it's bad for.

41:19.920 --> 41:23.180
 I think we've all heard that stress is bad for us.

41:23.180 --> 41:26.460
 We've seen these pictures intended to frighten us,

41:26.460 --> 41:27.620
 and indeed they are frightening.

41:27.620 --> 41:30.700
 You see the nice really plump brain on the left.

41:30.700 --> 41:32.140
 It says healthy or control,

41:32.140 --> 41:35.260
 and then you see the brain that says stressed above it

41:35.260 --> 41:37.480
 on the right, and it's like withered,

41:37.480 --> 41:39.080
 or we see that the hippocampus,

41:39.080 --> 41:41.480
 an area involved in memory is smaller,

41:41.480 --> 41:42.820
 people that are stressed.

41:42.820 --> 41:46.320
 We see that the Alzheimer's brain is made worse by stress,

41:46.320 --> 41:48.420
 that people who have a predisposition of schizophrenia

41:48.420 --> 41:49.240
 when they get stressed,

41:49.240 --> 41:52.380
 higher incidence of schizophrenic episodes.

41:52.380 --> 41:55.540
 You hear that addicts will relapse when they're stressed.

41:55.540 --> 41:58.460
 I mean, okay, we get it, and it's very important,

41:58.460 --> 42:00.540
 but I think we've all heard now so many times

42:00.540 --> 42:04.660
 that stress is bad, but in that conversation,

42:04.660 --> 42:08.560
 unfortunately it's eclipsed some of the really positive

42:08.560 --> 42:11.940
 things that stress does for us in the short term.

42:11.940 --> 42:14.700
 So stress can be short-term, medium-term, or long-term.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.700
 Long-term stress is indeed bad

42:16.700 --> 42:19.460
 for all the reasons I just mentioned and many others,

42:19.460 --> 42:20.980
 but what's never actually been discussed

42:20.980 --> 42:23.860
 is what stress is so terrific for,

42:23.860 --> 42:26.200
 positive for in the short term,

42:26.200 --> 42:29.980
 and I think we tend to overlook the important question,

42:29.980 --> 42:32.700
 which is what is short-term and what is long-term?

42:32.700 --> 42:34.820
 No one ever bothers to tell us what is chronic,

42:34.820 --> 42:36.060
 what is acute, right?

42:36.060 --> 42:37.000
 Is it five minutes?

42:37.000 --> 42:37.920
 Is it five days?

42:37.920 --> 42:40.140
 Is it for the duration of final exams

42:40.140 --> 42:44.220
 or is it for the duration of a senior thesis in college?

42:44.220 --> 42:46.300
 No one actually draws boundaries around this stuff

42:46.300 --> 42:48.040
 or even general guidelines,

42:48.040 --> 42:51.980
 and so it's become a bit of a mess, frankly,

42:51.980 --> 42:54.500
 to try and decipher this whole space around stress,

42:54.500 --> 42:57.180
 so I'm going to try and clean some of this up for you

42:57.180 --> 42:59.500
 based on what we know from the scientific data.

43:00.620 --> 43:03.260
 First of all, acute stress.

43:03.260 --> 43:04.740
 When the stress response hits,

43:04.740 --> 43:07.020
 that is good for your immune system.

43:07.020 --> 43:08.740
 I know that might be a tough pill to swallow,

43:08.740 --> 43:10.860
 but it's absolutely true.

43:10.860 --> 43:14.600
 In fact, stress often comes in the form

43:14.600 --> 43:17.280
 of bacterial or viral infection,

43:17.280 --> 43:21.700
 and the stress response is in part organized

43:21.700 --> 43:24.660
 to combat bacterial and viral infection.

43:24.660 --> 43:27.700
 There are pathways from the same brain centers

43:27.700 --> 43:30.940
 that activate these neurons in your spinal cord

43:30.940 --> 43:32.940
 to make you feel like you want to move.

43:32.940 --> 43:35.320
 There are other neurons in your brain

43:35.320 --> 43:37.540
 to activate things like your spleen,

43:37.540 --> 43:40.820
 which will deploy killer cells to go out and scavenge

43:40.820 --> 43:42.820
 for incoming bacteria and viruses

43:42.820 --> 43:45.500
 and try and eat them up and kill them,

43:45.500 --> 43:49.700
 so short-term stress and the release of adrenaline

43:49.700 --> 43:51.420
 in particular or epinephrine,

43:51.420 --> 43:53.280
 same thing, adrenaline epinephrine,

43:53.280 --> 43:56.940
 is good for combating infection,

43:56.940 --> 43:59.260
 and this to me is just not discussed enough,

43:59.260 --> 44:00.960
 so that's why I'm discussing it here,

44:00.960 --> 44:02.820
 and it relates to a particular tool

44:02.820 --> 44:04.940
 that many of you ask about,

44:04.940 --> 44:07.820
 but I don't often get the opportunity to talk about

44:07.820 --> 44:09.900
 in such an appropriate context.

44:09.900 --> 44:12.940
 It's not that it's ever inappropriate to talk about,

44:12.940 --> 44:14.280
 but what I'm about to talk about now

44:14.280 --> 44:18.620
 is the use of, again, respiration, breathing,

44:18.620 --> 44:23.620
 to somewhat artificially activate the stress response,

44:23.940 --> 44:26.400
 and that will accomplish two things, okay?

44:26.400 --> 44:28.020
 I'll return to medium and long-term stress,

44:28.020 --> 44:30.540
 but I want to say short-term stress is good

44:30.540 --> 44:32.980
 because the dilation of the pupils,

44:32.980 --> 44:34.620
 the changes in the optics of the eyes,

44:34.620 --> 44:36.160
 the quickening of the heart rate,

44:36.160 --> 44:37.860
 the sharpening of your cognition,

44:37.860 --> 44:39.700
 and in fact, that short-term stress

44:39.700 --> 44:42.540
 brings certain elements of the brain online

44:42.540 --> 44:44.120
 that allow you to focus.

44:44.120 --> 44:45.300
 Now, it narrows your focus.

44:45.300 --> 44:47.640
 You're not good at seeing the so-called big picture,

44:47.640 --> 44:48.980
 but it narrows your focus.

44:48.980 --> 44:50.700
 It allows you to do these,

44:50.700 --> 44:53.180
 what I call duration path outcome types of analysis.

44:53.180 --> 44:54.740
 It allows you to evaluate your environment,

44:54.740 --> 44:56.420
 evaluate what you need to do.

44:56.420 --> 44:59.460
 It primes your whole system for better cognition.

44:59.460 --> 45:02.180
 It primes your immune system to combat infection,

45:02.180 --> 45:04.460
 and that all makes sense when you think about the fact

45:04.460 --> 45:09.460
 that famine, thirst, bacterial infections,

45:09.900 --> 45:11.660
 viral infections, invaders,

45:11.660 --> 45:14.340
 all of this stuff liberates a response in the body

45:14.340 --> 45:17.220
 that's designed to get you to fight back

45:17.220 --> 45:19.500
 against whatever stressor that happens to be,

45:19.500 --> 45:22.580
 psychological, physical, bacterial, viral.

45:22.580 --> 45:25.340
 Again, the stress response is generic.

45:25.340 --> 45:28.340
 The tool takes advantage of the fact

45:28.340 --> 45:31.860
 that when adrenaline is released in the body

45:31.860 --> 45:34.380
 from the adrenals,

45:34.380 --> 45:36.580
 it has the effect of also liberating

45:36.580 --> 45:40.140
 a lot of these killer cells from the immune organs,

45:40.140 --> 45:43.100
 in particular from the spleen, but from elsewhere as well,

45:43.100 --> 45:45.580
 and interactions with the lymphatic system

45:45.580 --> 45:47.260
 that combat infection.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.700
 The way this works in the real world

45:51.700 --> 45:56.460
 is best captured by a study that can be mapped back

45:56.460 --> 45:58.940
 to so-called Wim Hof breathing.

45:58.940 --> 46:01.880
 Now, Wim Hof breathing is so named after

46:01.880 --> 46:04.160
 the so-called Iceman Wim Hof.

46:04.160 --> 46:07.020
 Wim, of course, being this Dutch,

46:07.020 --> 46:09.260
 I think he is self-titled Daredevil,

46:09.260 --> 46:12.740
 and indeed he has many, many Guinness Book of World Records

46:12.740 --> 46:14.940
 for things like swimming under icebergs,

46:14.940 --> 46:17.400
 and going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts,

46:17.400 --> 46:22.400
 and crossing the desert without water, et cetera,

46:22.660 --> 46:24.680
 things that are quite dangerous

46:24.680 --> 46:26.700
 if you don't know what you're doing.

46:26.700 --> 46:30.780
 And Wim obviously survived, or I'm telling you he survived.

46:30.780 --> 46:34.500
 But there are two components to a sort of breathing protocol

46:34.500 --> 46:37.600
 that he developed that was based also

46:37.600 --> 46:40.180
 on what's called TUMO breathing, T-U-M-M-O.

46:40.180 --> 46:42.500
 So before Wim, there was TUMO breathing.

46:42.500 --> 46:46.180
 And many people call this now super oxygenation breathing,

46:46.180 --> 46:49.300
 although the breath work aficionados will probably say,

46:49.300 --> 46:50.940
 well, it's not super oxygenation

46:50.940 --> 46:53.820
 because you're also blowing off a lot of carbon dioxide.

46:53.820 --> 46:55.600
 What I'm talking about here,

46:55.600 --> 46:58.280
 regardless of whether or not it's called Wim Hof, TUMO,

46:58.280 --> 47:02.740
 or super oxygenation is rapid deliberate breathing.

47:02.740 --> 47:04.760
 So it's deliberate hyperventilation.

47:05.660 --> 47:06.900
 Why would somebody want to do this?

47:06.900 --> 47:11.300
 Well, deliberate hyperventilation done for maybe 25 cycles.

47:11.300 --> 47:14.140
 So inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale.

47:14.140 --> 47:15.560
 Typically it's done in through the nose,

47:15.560 --> 47:16.400
 out through the mouth,

47:16.400 --> 47:18.680
 although sometimes it's just through the mouth.

47:18.680 --> 47:23.580
 If you do that for 15 breaths, 20 breaths, 25 breaths,

47:23.580 --> 47:24.920
 you will feel very alert.

47:24.920 --> 47:27.760
 People who have anxiety will feel anxious.

47:27.760 --> 47:30.320
 They might even have an anxiety attack.

47:30.320 --> 47:34.260
 However, we need to ask why that kind of breathing

47:34.260 --> 47:35.240
 feels that way.

47:35.240 --> 47:37.020
 And it's because that pattern of breathing,

47:37.020 --> 47:39.700
 rapid movements of the diaphragm

47:39.700 --> 47:42.260
 will liberate adrenaline from the adrenals.

47:42.260 --> 47:44.420
 So it's the release of adrenaline.

47:44.420 --> 47:46.740
 I mentioned that Wim is also called the Iceman.

47:46.740 --> 47:49.300
 Well, that's because he actually discovered

47:49.300 --> 47:51.380
 this pattern of breathing somewhat.

47:51.380 --> 47:55.780
 And again, it maps back to Tummo breathing

47:55.780 --> 47:57.260
 by going into cold water.

47:57.260 --> 47:59.680
 When you go into cold water, that too is a stressor

47:59.680 --> 48:02.820
 and you liberate adrenaline in response to cold water.

48:02.820 --> 48:05.020
 So if you get into an ice bath or a cold shower,

48:05.020 --> 48:09.020
 you will immediately release adrenaline from your adrenals.

48:09.960 --> 48:11.640
 Now, there are all sorts of things related to this

48:11.640 --> 48:13.820
 about psychological control and stress thresholds

48:13.820 --> 48:15.140
 that we'll talk about.

48:15.140 --> 48:16.680
 But I really want people to understand

48:16.680 --> 48:18.620
 that when adrenaline is released in the body,

48:18.620 --> 48:22.980
 you are in a better position to combat infections.

48:22.980 --> 48:25.280
 And so whether or not you breathe very quickly

48:25.280 --> 48:27.700
 in these cycles of 25 breaths,

48:27.700 --> 48:30.100
 and regardless of what you call it, doesn't matter,

48:30.100 --> 48:31.260
 adrenaline is released.

48:31.260 --> 48:33.840
 If you take a cold shower, adrenaline is released.

48:33.840 --> 48:36.620
 If you go into an ice bath deliberately,

48:36.620 --> 48:39.660
 and even if you do it non-deliberately,

48:39.660 --> 48:40.820
 adrenaline is released.

48:40.820 --> 48:43.020
 You are mimicking the stress response.

48:43.020 --> 48:48.620
 And that adrenaline serves to suppress or combat

48:48.620 --> 48:49.780
 incoming infections.

48:49.780 --> 48:51.620
 And this was beautifully shown in a study

48:51.620 --> 48:53.660
 that was published in a very fine journal,

48:53.660 --> 48:55.660
 The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

48:55.660 --> 48:57.100
 for the US.

48:57.100 --> 48:58.420
 It's literally called

48:58.420 --> 49:00.620
 Proceedings of the National Academy of USA

49:00.620 --> 49:02.540
 to distinguish it from other proceedings

49:02.540 --> 49:04.840
 of other national academies in other countries.

49:07.020 --> 49:11.140
 The way the experiment went is that people were injected

49:11.140 --> 49:14.820
 with endotoxin, or in some cases,

49:14.820 --> 49:17.500
 they were injected with a bacterial wall

49:17.500 --> 49:19.220
 that mimics infection.

49:19.220 --> 49:20.260
 It gives you a fever.

49:20.260 --> 49:21.300
 It makes you feel nauseous.

49:21.300 --> 49:22.140
 It makes you feel sick.

49:22.140 --> 49:24.020
 It is not pleasant.

49:24.020 --> 49:27.180
 Half of the people did a particular pattern of breathing

49:27.180 --> 49:29.140
 that looked very much like the pattern of breathing

49:29.140 --> 49:33.140
 I described a moment ago of doing 25 deep inhales

49:33.140 --> 49:36.240
 and exhales, followed by an exhale holding their breath,

49:36.240 --> 49:39.380
 then repeating, 25 inhales, exhales holding their breath.

49:39.380 --> 49:40.620
 So this would look something like this,

49:40.620 --> 49:42.020
 or if you're listening, it sounds like,

49:42.020 --> 49:44.300
 ah, ah, ah.

49:44.300 --> 49:46.920
 25, 30 times, you'll start feeling heated up.

49:46.920 --> 49:48.500
 You'll start feeling the adrenaline response.

49:48.500 --> 49:50.000
 You're liberating adrenaline in your body.

49:50.000 --> 49:53.640
 Then exhale, hold your breath for 15 seconds,

49:53.640 --> 49:54.740
 and then repeat.

49:54.740 --> 49:57.380
 And then typically after doing three or four rounds of that,

49:57.380 --> 49:59.620
 they would inhale very deeply and hold their breath.

49:59.620 --> 50:00.940
 Now I want to emphasize,

50:00.940 --> 50:03.740
 never, ever, ever do this anywhere near water.

50:03.740 --> 50:07.060
 People have passed out so-called shallow water breath out.

50:07.060 --> 50:07.900
 People have died.

50:07.900 --> 50:09.440
 Don't do it in the bathtub, do it in the hot tub.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.620
 Don't do it before swimming.

50:10.620 --> 50:12.000
 Please don't do it anywhere near water.

50:12.000 --> 50:13.100
 Please don't do it at all

50:13.100 --> 50:15.380
 unless you get clearance to do it from your doctor,

50:15.380 --> 50:17.420
 because there are some pulmonary effects and whatnot.

50:17.420 --> 50:19.300
 And the breath holds should definitely not be done

50:19.300 --> 50:22.460
 by anyone that has glaucoma or pressure concerns

50:22.460 --> 50:23.540
 for the eyes.

50:23.540 --> 50:26.480
 But these repeated cycles of breathing

50:26.480 --> 50:29.260
 that liberate adrenaline allowed the group

50:29.260 --> 50:32.700
 that did that protocol to essentially experience

50:32.700 --> 50:36.340
 zero symptoms from the injection of this E. coli,

50:36.340 --> 50:37.680
 which is remarkable.

50:37.680 --> 50:39.720
 They had much reduced or no symptoms.

50:39.720 --> 50:41.020
 They didn't feel feverish.

50:41.020 --> 50:41.900
 They didn't feel sick.

50:41.900 --> 50:44.540
 They weren't vomiting, no diarrhea, which is remarkable,

50:44.540 --> 50:47.260
 but makes total sense when you think about the fact

50:47.260 --> 50:48.760
 that the short-term stress response

50:48.760 --> 50:51.060
 that what's typically called the acute stress response

50:51.060 --> 50:54.380
 is designed to combat all stressors.

50:54.380 --> 50:58.380
 In fact, were you to cut yourself very deeply

50:58.380 --> 51:00.340
 while out on a hike in the woods.

51:00.340 --> 51:01.880
 The other thing that would happen

51:01.880 --> 51:06.340
 is that there would be a rapid inflammation response.

51:06.340 --> 51:08.340
 And we always hear inflammation is bad.

51:08.340 --> 51:10.020
 Inflammation gives us Alzheimer's.

51:10.020 --> 51:11.540
 Inflammation is the worst thing.

51:11.540 --> 51:13.900
 But the swelling is associated,

51:13.900 --> 51:16.660
 the inflammation is associated with the recruitment

51:16.660 --> 51:20.540
 of things like macrophages or microglia,

51:20.540 --> 51:23.740
 if it's a neural tissue, cells in our brain and body

51:23.740 --> 51:26.260
 whose job is to act like little ambulances

51:26.260 --> 51:28.060
 and rush to that site and clean it up.

51:28.060 --> 51:30.540
 And indeed the inflammation response looks horrible.

51:30.540 --> 51:33.760
 It sounds horrible, but it's a great thing in the short term

51:33.760 --> 51:38.760
 you want to have that tissue marked as in trouble

51:39.060 --> 51:41.740
 and you want the body and brain to react to it.

51:41.740 --> 51:44.520
 So if you're getting peaks in stress from time to time

51:44.520 --> 51:46.100
 throughout your day or throughout your week,

51:46.100 --> 51:49.640
 you are in a better position to combat infection.

51:49.640 --> 51:52.660
 You are in a better position to heal your wounds,

51:52.660 --> 51:54.180
 physical wounds.

51:54.180 --> 51:57.100
 Many great things happen in the stress response.

51:57.100 --> 51:58.560
 Now, of course the stress response

51:58.560 --> 52:00.160
 isn't always super intense.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.720
 Sometimes it's milder.

52:01.720 --> 52:03.620
 Sometimes it allows us to just focus on something

52:03.620 --> 52:05.420
 as we have a deadline that can feel stressful.

52:05.420 --> 52:06.640
 But that's one of the reasons

52:06.640 --> 52:07.980
 you procrastinators out there,

52:07.980 --> 52:12.060
 people always ask me what can be done for procrastination?

52:12.060 --> 52:13.500
 What can be done for procrastination

52:13.500 --> 52:15.660
 is you can understand what's happening,

52:15.660 --> 52:18.740
 which is that you are self-imposing stress

52:18.740 --> 52:20.980
 because stress acts like a drug.

52:20.980 --> 52:22.620
 It is a powerful nootropic.

52:22.620 --> 52:24.100
 I get asked about nootropics.

52:24.100 --> 52:27.440
 The most powerful nootropic or smart drug is stress.

52:27.440 --> 52:29.260
 It's the concern of failure.

52:29.260 --> 52:31.060
 It's the desire to do well.

52:31.060 --> 52:32.560
 It's the impending deadline.

52:32.560 --> 52:34.740
 It's the, oh my gosh, I have to do this thing now

52:34.740 --> 52:35.580
 or I'm going to fail.

52:35.580 --> 52:38.140
 That is the best nootropic you will ever find.

52:38.140 --> 52:39.880
 That combined with a good night's sleep,

52:39.880 --> 52:40.940
 which we'll talk about,

52:40.940 --> 52:42.180
 but we spend a whole month on sleep

52:42.180 --> 52:44.700
 so I don't want to backtrack too much, okay?

52:44.700 --> 52:47.500
 So short-term stress, great.

52:47.500 --> 52:51.580
 The key is to be able to turn the stress response off

52:51.580 --> 52:54.000
 when you're done, when you don't want that.

52:54.000 --> 52:57.920
 In fact, let's just really tamp down the relationship

52:57.920 --> 53:00.100
 between the short-term or acute stress response

53:00.100 --> 53:01.140
 and infection.

53:01.140 --> 53:02.840
 Many of us are familiar with the experience

53:02.840 --> 53:04.060
 of work, work, work, work, work,

53:04.060 --> 53:05.660
 or taking care of a loved one,

53:05.660 --> 53:06.900
 or stress, stress, stress, stress,

53:06.900 --> 53:08.020
 then we finally relax.

53:08.020 --> 53:09.600
 Maybe we even go on vacation.

53:09.600 --> 53:11.300
 Like, oh, now I'm finally going to get the break

53:11.300 --> 53:12.740
 and then we get sick.

53:12.740 --> 53:15.420
 And that's because the adrenaline response crashed

53:15.420 --> 53:18.340
 and your immune system crashed with it.

53:18.340 --> 53:20.740
 So please understand this.

53:20.740 --> 53:22.820
 Now, many of you might say, well, how long?

53:22.820 --> 53:23.780
 Is it two hours?

53:23.780 --> 53:24.600
 Is it three hours?

53:24.600 --> 53:26.340
 A lot of you out there that really like specificity,

53:26.340 --> 53:28.100
 it will vary for everybody.

53:28.100 --> 53:31.780
 I would just kind of use a rule of thumb.

53:31.780 --> 53:34.740
 When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep,

53:34.740 --> 53:36.360
 what good sleep means to you,

53:36.360 --> 53:38.000
 and please see the episodes on sleep

53:38.000 --> 53:40.380
 if you want more about tools to sleep.

53:40.380 --> 53:43.660
 When you are no longer able to achieve good sleep,

53:43.660 --> 53:46.300
 you are now moving from acute stress to chronic stress.

53:46.300 --> 53:49.460
 You need to be able to turn the stress response off.

53:49.460 --> 53:50.920
 If I have one wish,

53:50.920 --> 53:52.440
 well, I have many wishes for this lifetime,

53:52.440 --> 53:56.540
 but if I have one wish today that I hope will permeate

53:56.540 --> 53:59.700
 and spread out there is this idea that we need

53:59.700 --> 54:03.100
 from a young age, but even as adults and forever,

54:03.100 --> 54:05.580
 we need to learn how to turn off our stress response.

54:05.580 --> 54:08.140
 Physiological sigh is one.

54:08.140 --> 54:10.560
 If we're going to activate our stress response intentionally

54:10.560 --> 54:12.860
 by ice baths, cold showers,

54:12.860 --> 54:14.940
 cyclic hyperoxygenated breathing,

54:14.940 --> 54:17.340
 AKA Tummo breathing or Wim Hof breathing,

54:17.340 --> 54:21.020
 we also need to learn how to press the brake, okay?

54:21.020 --> 54:23.060
 So let's think about the stress system.

54:23.060 --> 54:25.140
 It knows how to activate itself.

54:25.140 --> 54:28.100
 Now we're talking about a way of deliberately activating

54:28.100 --> 54:30.780
 your stress system in order to combat infection.

54:30.780 --> 54:31.940
 I do this from time to time.

54:31.940 --> 54:33.420
 I might feel a tickle in my throat

54:33.420 --> 54:35.580
 or like I'm getting kind of run down.

54:35.580 --> 54:38.260
 I will do this kind of breathing, I do.

54:38.260 --> 54:42.460
 I will take 25 or 30 breaths, exhale, hold my breath.

54:42.460 --> 54:44.500
 25, 30 breaths again, exhale,

54:44.500 --> 54:46.780
 hold my breath for about 15 seconds.

54:46.780 --> 54:48.540
 25, 30 breaths again, exhale,

54:48.540 --> 54:50.260
 hold my breath for 25 or 30 seconds,

54:50.260 --> 54:52.060
 then a big inhale and I hold my breath

54:52.060 --> 54:54.320
 until I feel the impulse to breathe.

54:54.320 --> 54:56.360
 Again, I feel it safe for me.

54:56.360 --> 54:58.240
 I've run it by my doctor, so it's fine.

54:58.240 --> 55:00.780
 You should not do this unless it's right for you,

55:00.780 --> 55:01.620
 but I do this.

55:01.620 --> 55:03.540
 Some people like the ice bath.

55:03.540 --> 55:05.340
 I rarely do the ice bath.

55:05.340 --> 55:06.580
 Some people like cold showers.

55:06.580 --> 55:08.060
 I like hot showers.

55:08.060 --> 55:10.180
 So I take hot showers, but I do this kind of breathing.

55:10.180 --> 55:14.220
 Again, they are all having more or less the same effect

55:14.220 --> 55:16.060
 of increasing adrenaline

55:16.060 --> 55:19.380
 which allows you to combat the infection

55:19.380 --> 55:21.420
 because you're activating the immune response.

55:21.420 --> 55:24.460
 Okay, so now let's talk about medium-term stress.

55:24.460 --> 55:26.540
 Medium-term stress is going to be stress

55:26.540 --> 55:31.540
 that lasts anywhere from several days to several weeks.

55:31.540 --> 55:33.380
 We might think of that as long-term stress.

55:33.380 --> 55:34.540
 There are times in life

55:34.540 --> 55:37.220
 where we are just dealing with a lot.

55:37.220 --> 55:39.940
 This particular quarter, I happen to be directing a course.

55:39.940 --> 55:42.080
 I'm doing the lab, I'm doing this.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.020
 I enjoy all these things immensely,

55:44.020 --> 55:46.620
 but I'm kind of near my threshold.

55:46.620 --> 55:49.460
 I'm near the point where any additional thing,

55:49.460 --> 55:51.140
 like I couldn't log onto a website the other day

55:51.140 --> 55:54.080
 and it felt like the most intense thing in the world

55:54.080 --> 55:55.900
 at that moment and I kind of laughed at myself.

55:55.900 --> 55:57.240
 Fortunately, I caught it,

55:57.240 --> 56:00.060
 but that typically wouldn't be my response

56:00.060 --> 56:02.180
 under conditions where I wasn't pushed to threshold.

56:02.180 --> 56:03.860
 What is this medium-term stress?

56:03.860 --> 56:05.220
 What is stress threshold?

56:05.220 --> 56:09.740
 Well, stress threshold is actually our ability

56:09.740 --> 56:14.020
 to cognitively regulate what's going on in our body.

56:14.020 --> 56:16.180
 So we've all hear so much about

56:16.180 --> 56:18.420
 we need to unify our mind and body.

56:18.420 --> 56:21.100
 We need to be at one with our mind and body

56:21.100 --> 56:23.420
 or now I realize I'm kind of poking fun

56:23.420 --> 56:24.620
 at some of the new agey language.

56:24.620 --> 56:26.580
 But the reason I poke fun is not because

56:26.580 --> 56:29.180
 I don't think it has value, but it has no specificity.

56:29.180 --> 56:30.000
 What does that mean?

56:30.000 --> 56:31.940
 I mean, I think I'm always in my body.

56:31.940 --> 56:33.880
 I've never fortunately looked across the room

56:33.880 --> 56:36.320
 and seen my arm over there or my leg over there.

56:36.320 --> 56:38.020
 I'm connected to my body.

56:38.020 --> 56:39.060
 There actually is a syndrome

56:39.060 --> 56:41.700
 where people feel disconnected from their limbs.

56:41.700 --> 56:43.500
 This is a real clinical condition.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.740
 These people actually will seek out amputation.

56:45.740 --> 56:47.060
 They will try and convince doctors

56:47.060 --> 56:49.220
 to amputate certain portions of their body.

56:49.220 --> 56:50.800
 It's a really terrible thing for people

56:50.800 --> 56:55.800
 that have and it relates to a change in central maps

56:55.900 --> 56:57.200
 in the brain, believe it or not.

56:57.200 --> 57:00.540
 Most of us want to keep our limbs,

57:00.540 --> 57:02.020
 whichever ones we happen to have.

57:02.020 --> 57:04.700
 And most of us feel one in mind and body

57:04.700 --> 57:06.220
 so much so that when stress hits,

57:06.220 --> 57:07.940
 we feel it in our mind and body.

57:07.940 --> 57:10.860
 A lot of stress inoculation,

57:10.860 --> 57:13.740
 a lot of managing medium-term stress

57:13.740 --> 57:17.640
 on the timescale of weeks or maybe even a couple months.

57:17.640 --> 57:20.940
 So we're not talking about years of stress.

57:20.940 --> 57:24.420
 A lot of that has to do with raising our stress threshold.

57:24.420 --> 57:26.580
 It's about capacity.

57:26.580 --> 57:29.060
 And there are very simple tools,

57:29.060 --> 57:31.060
 excellent tools that will allow us

57:31.060 --> 57:34.180
 to modulate our capacity for stress.

57:34.180 --> 57:37.640
 And they look a lot like the tools I just described.

57:37.640 --> 57:40.740
 They involve placing oneself deliberately

57:40.740 --> 57:44.520
 into a situation where our adrenaline is increased somewhat,

57:44.520 --> 57:46.340
 not to the extreme.

57:46.340 --> 57:49.300
 And then when we feel flooded with adrenaline

57:50.460 --> 57:52.420
 and normally we would panic,

57:52.420 --> 57:56.220
 it's about cognitively, mentally, emotionally,

57:56.220 --> 57:58.620
 calming ourselves and being comfortable

57:58.620 --> 58:00.480
 with that response in our body.

58:00.480 --> 58:03.140
 So unlike trying to unify the mind and body

58:03.140 --> 58:05.420
 and make it all calm or make it all alert,

58:05.420 --> 58:09.300
 this is about dissociating mind and body in a healthy way.

58:09.300 --> 58:10.940
 And what would this look like?

58:10.940 --> 58:13.060
 Well, this is something I actually do as a practice

58:13.060 --> 58:14.940
 because I mentioned before,

58:14.940 --> 58:16.320
 you can use physiological size.

58:16.320 --> 58:18.940
 In real time, you can use

58:18.940 --> 58:22.140
 the cyclic hyperoxygenation breathing to combat infection

58:22.140 --> 58:24.340
 if you're feeling kind of run down.

58:24.340 --> 58:27.340
 And there's also a way in which you can use things

58:27.340 --> 58:30.800
 like cold showers or if you exercise

58:30.800 --> 58:32.540
 and you bring your heart rate up very high,

58:32.540 --> 58:34.700
 you kind of go into that high intensity realm

58:34.700 --> 58:36.980
 where your heart is beating a little bit harder

58:36.980 --> 58:38.780
 than you're comfortable with.

58:38.780 --> 58:40.940
 And that you're just, you feel,

58:40.940 --> 58:42.380
 some people think it's lactic acid.

58:42.380 --> 58:45.020
 No one can agree on this, what the burn is,

58:45.020 --> 58:47.420
 whether it's lactic acid or it's buildup of hydrogen

58:47.420 --> 58:48.260
 or whatever.

58:48.260 --> 58:49.080
 I don't want to get into that,

58:49.080 --> 58:51.180
 but we're all familiar with the intense feeling

58:51.180 --> 58:52.700
 of your muscles kind of burning

58:52.700 --> 58:56.160
 because you're working very hard physically.

58:56.160 --> 59:00.140
 The key in those moments is to learn to relax the mind

59:00.140 --> 59:02.340
 while the body is very activated.

59:02.340 --> 59:04.260
 And what that tends to do,

59:04.260 --> 59:05.740
 there's a limited amount of research on this,

59:05.740 --> 59:08.820
 but what that tends to do is it tends to create a situation

59:08.820 --> 59:12.900
 where what once felt like a lot feels manageable.

59:13.780 --> 59:17.200
 You've raised your stress threshold or your stress capacity.

59:17.200 --> 59:19.560
 One way that you can do this, and this is kind of fun,

59:19.560 --> 59:21.940
 if it's approved by your physician

59:21.940 --> 59:23.200
 and you're able to do this,

59:23.200 --> 59:24.620
 you can bring your heart rate up.

59:24.620 --> 59:26.180
 You could do this through an ice bath

59:26.180 --> 59:27.740
 if that's your thing or a cold shower

59:27.740 --> 59:29.540
 or cyclic oxygenation breathing,

59:29.540 --> 59:32.380
 or you could sprint or you could go hard on the bike,

59:32.380 --> 59:34.580
 whatever it is that brings your heart rate up.

59:34.580 --> 59:36.300
 And then what you want to do

59:36.300 --> 59:38.660
 is you want to actually try and calm the mind

59:38.660 --> 59:41.500
 while your body is in this heightened state of activation.

59:41.500 --> 59:44.420
 And the best way that I'm aware to do that,

59:44.420 --> 59:47.540
 again, goes back to physiology, not psychology.

59:48.380 --> 59:51.100
 When we are stressed, our pupils dilate.

59:51.100 --> 59:53.340
 The effect of that pupil dilation

59:53.340 --> 59:54.740
 is to create tunnel vision.

59:54.740 --> 59:56.940
 It literally narrows our view of the visual world.

59:56.940 --> 59:59.140
 We no longer see in panorama.

59:59.140 --> 1:00:01.620
 And there's some other effects as well,

1:00:01.620 --> 1:00:03.060
 but that's because the visual system

1:00:03.060 --> 1:00:05.700
 through this cranial nerve system that I described before

1:00:05.700 --> 1:00:10.080
 is tethered and is part of this autonomic nervous system.

1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:12.900
 By deliberately dilating your gaze,

1:00:12.900 --> 1:00:14.740
 meaning not moving your head and eyes around,

1:00:14.740 --> 1:00:18.060
 but by deliberately going from tunnel vision

1:00:18.060 --> 1:00:20.280
 to broader panoramic vision,

1:00:20.280 --> 1:00:22.880
 literally seeing more of your environment all at once,

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:23.980
 you don't have to do what I'm doing,

1:00:23.980 --> 1:00:26.180
 which is not blinking, you're welcome to blink,

1:00:26.180 --> 1:00:28.520
 but it means deliberately dilating your gaze

1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:31.760
 so that you can see yourself in the environment you're in.

1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:33.680
 It creates a calming effect on the mind

1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:36.280
 because it releases a particular circuit in the brainstem

1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:40.100
 that's associated with alertness, AKA stress.

1:00:40.100 --> 1:00:41.900
 Now, this is very powerful.

1:00:41.900 --> 1:00:43.340
 If you're running, for instance,

1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:45.840
 and you're at max capacity or close to it,

1:00:45.840 --> 1:00:48.460
 or you're kind of hitting like 80, 90% of maximum

1:00:48.460 --> 1:00:51.580
 on the bike and you dilate your gaze,

1:00:51.580 --> 1:00:53.260
 what you'll find is the mind can relax

1:00:53.260 --> 1:00:55.420
 while the body is in full output.

1:00:55.420 --> 1:00:58.780
 And this relates to work that in various communities,

1:00:58.780 --> 1:01:00.820
 people are working with this in the sports community,

1:01:00.820 --> 1:01:02.380
 military communities, et cetera,

1:01:02.380 --> 1:01:05.780
 but it's a form, not really of stress inoculation,

1:01:05.780 --> 1:01:08.300
 it's more about raising stress threshold

1:01:08.300 --> 1:01:11.140
 so that the body is going to continue to be

1:01:11.140 --> 1:01:15.240
 in a high alertness, high reactivity mode, high output,

1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:16.980
 but the mind is calm.

1:01:16.980 --> 1:01:19.520
 And so this isn't about unifying mind and body,

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:22.180
 this is actually about using body

1:01:22.180 --> 1:01:24.020
 to bring up your level of activation,

1:01:24.020 --> 1:01:25.580
 then dissociating,

1:01:25.580 --> 1:01:28.900
 not the clinical dissociation kind of disorders,

1:01:28.900 --> 1:01:31.980
 but dissociating the mental or emotional response

1:01:31.980 --> 1:01:33.140
 from what's going on in your body.

1:01:33.140 --> 1:01:36.380
 And over time, so if you do this a couple of times,

1:01:36.380 --> 1:01:37.960
 you don't have to do this every workout,

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:40.460
 but if you do this maybe once a week or so,

1:01:40.460 --> 1:01:42.060
 you start being comfortable

1:01:42.060 --> 1:01:43.940
 at these higher activation states.

1:01:43.940 --> 1:01:46.900
 What once felt overwhelming and like a lot of work

1:01:46.900 --> 1:01:50.500
 now is manageable, it feels tolerable.

1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:53.540
 So that's for navigating medium term stress.

1:01:53.540 --> 1:01:54.940
 Now there are other tools as well,

1:01:54.940 --> 1:01:56.900
 but we don't want to go over 90 minutes

1:01:56.900 --> 1:01:58.720
 because 90 minutes is one ultradian cycle.

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:00.000
 I always try and keep these podcasts

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.060
 to one ultradian cycle in case you haven't noticed

1:02:02.060 --> 1:02:05.020
 so you can derive maximum benefit from them

1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:07.780
 based on ultradian cycle principles of learning.

1:02:07.780 --> 1:02:10.580
 So I don't want to go into every little bit of this

1:02:10.580 --> 1:02:11.980
 and I want to make sure we get to emotions,

1:02:11.980 --> 1:02:16.340
 but I want to emphasize that these medium term stressors

1:02:16.340 --> 1:02:18.680
 of, oh, it has been a hard month or hard week

1:02:18.680 --> 1:02:20.940
 or Stanford's on the quarter system,

1:02:20.940 --> 1:02:23.240
 so 10 weeks or semester,

1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:27.400
 that becomes more manageable when we train ourselves

1:02:27.400 --> 1:02:31.820
 to be calm of mind when our body is activated.

1:02:31.820 --> 1:02:33.860
 And if you haven't noticed,

1:02:33.860 --> 1:02:35.500
 most of the tools I'm describing today

1:02:35.500 --> 1:02:38.260
 are nothing like the sort of, okay, sit and do meditation.

1:02:38.260 --> 1:02:41.460
 I'm not, I'm actively avoiding saying the words NSDR,

1:02:41.460 --> 1:02:42.460
 non-sleep deep rest.

1:02:42.460 --> 1:02:44.120
 I talked a lot about those tools

1:02:44.120 --> 1:02:47.100
 during the months on sleep and neuroplasticity.

1:02:47.100 --> 1:02:49.820
 And of course they're wonderful for replenishing

1:02:49.820 --> 1:02:53.180
 your ability to lean into effort, to learn, to focus.

1:02:53.180 --> 1:02:56.100
 Please do try and check out NSDR protocol,

1:02:56.100 --> 1:02:57.100
 see if they're right for you.

1:02:57.100 --> 1:02:58.980
 The margins for safety I think are enormous.

1:02:58.980 --> 1:03:01.140
 You're basically just listening to a script.

1:03:01.140 --> 1:03:03.220
 We have links to them in previous captions.

1:03:03.220 --> 1:03:04.780
 I've talked to them on various podcasts before.

1:03:04.780 --> 1:03:06.280
 We can provide them again.

1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:08.300
 But today I'm really talking about tools

1:03:08.300 --> 1:03:10.800
 so that you can learn to dance with stress,

1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:14.420
 to in the short term, reduce that stress response

1:03:14.420 --> 1:03:16.240
 a little bit if you feel it's too uncomfortable.

1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:18.140
 In the medium term, to be comfortable

1:03:18.140 --> 1:03:19.420
 at these heightened levels of activation

1:03:19.420 --> 1:03:21.940
 because life is going to continue to come at you.

1:03:21.940 --> 1:03:24.260
 We can't pick the stressors,

1:03:24.260 --> 1:03:27.440
 but we need to be able to function at a higher capacity

1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:28.700
 often.

1:03:28.700 --> 1:03:30.640
 And then there's long-term stress.

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:32.700
 Now long-term stress is bad.

1:03:32.700 --> 1:03:35.360
 You do not want adrenaline up in your system

1:03:35.360 --> 1:03:36.700
 for a very long time.

1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:41.240
 In fact, ideally you would have your stress go up

1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:42.900
 various times throughout the day,

1:03:42.900 --> 1:03:44.700
 but it would never stay elevated

1:03:44.700 --> 1:03:45.640
 and it would never prevent you

1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:46.880
 from getting a good night's sleep.

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:48.780
 Now that isn't realistic, okay?

1:03:48.780 --> 1:03:53.260
 I would say for me, three, four nights out of the month,

1:03:53.260 --> 1:03:55.560
 no matter what I do, I take on too much

1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:57.780
 or something happens and life is life

1:03:57.780 --> 1:03:59.820
 and I don't get the best night's sleep

1:03:59.820 --> 1:04:01.220
 that I would like to get.

1:04:01.220 --> 1:04:03.860
 For many of you, it's 30 nights per month.

1:04:03.860 --> 1:04:05.900
 For some of you, it's zero nights per month

1:04:05.900 --> 1:04:09.180
 and congratulations to you zero nights per month people.

1:04:09.180 --> 1:04:11.380
 If you are managing your sleep really well every night,

1:04:11.380 --> 1:04:13.100
 that is fantastic.

1:04:13.100 --> 1:04:15.940
 You really want to be able to fall asleep at night,

1:04:15.940 --> 1:04:17.180
 stay asleep for most of the night

1:04:17.180 --> 1:04:18.540
 and if you get up, go back to sleep

1:04:18.540 --> 1:04:20.420
 for as long as you need to in order to feel rested.

1:04:20.420 --> 1:04:23.620
 That's what I define as a healthy relationship to sleep.

1:04:23.620 --> 1:04:25.020
 Check out the episodes on sleep

1:04:25.020 --> 1:04:27.220
 if you want tools to be able to accomplish that.

1:04:27.220 --> 1:04:29.580
 We can all accomplish that, it can be done

1:04:29.580 --> 1:04:32.220
 and there are tools to do it, zero cost tools.

1:04:32.220 --> 1:04:35.460
 Okay, so let's talk about long-term stress.

1:04:35.460 --> 1:04:38.100
 Earlier I talked about how breathing

1:04:38.100 --> 1:04:41.660
 can modulate heart rate through this loop

1:04:41.660 --> 1:04:42.740
 that includes the brain

1:04:42.740 --> 1:04:44.940
 and the parasympathetic nervous system.

1:04:44.940 --> 1:04:46.000
 I don't think I mentioned this

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:47.660
 and I want to make sure that I mentioned

1:04:47.660 --> 1:04:50.220
 that breathing controlling heart rate

1:04:50.220 --> 1:04:52.860
 through the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system

1:04:52.860 --> 1:04:57.860
 is the basis of what's called HRV, heart rate variability.

1:04:57.900 --> 1:05:01.140
 And we know that heart rate variability is good.

1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:04.180
 You don't want your heart rate chronically elevated

1:05:04.180 --> 1:05:05.840
 or chronically low.

1:05:05.840 --> 1:05:06.680
 A lot of people think,

1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:08.980
 oh, I want a really nice low heart rate

1:05:08.980 --> 1:05:10.620
 and indeed if you're in shape,

1:05:10.620 --> 1:05:13.200
 the stroke volume of your heart will be greater

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:16.780
 and you can have a nice slow heart rate.

1:05:16.780 --> 1:05:19.620
 Years ago when I was running regularly,

1:05:19.620 --> 1:05:21.860
 I think my heart rate was down to like 50 or 60

1:05:21.860 --> 1:05:22.700
 or something like that.

1:05:22.700 --> 1:05:26.000
 That's great but, and now it's higher than that

1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:27.300
 because I'm running a little bit less

1:05:27.300 --> 1:05:30.700
 but everyone needs to determine what's right for them

1:05:30.700 --> 1:05:32.420
 but you don't really want your heart rate

1:05:32.420 --> 1:05:35.680
 to be chronically low or chronically high, both are bad.

1:05:35.680 --> 1:05:38.860
 We know that chronic stress, elevated stress

1:05:38.860 --> 1:05:42.520
 and especially in the so-called type A personalities

1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:45.700
 creates heart disease, leading killer

1:05:45.700 --> 1:05:49.900
 for in most every country, but in particular in the US

1:05:49.900 --> 1:05:52.240
 because of the way that adrenaline

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:54.540
 impacts those blood vessels are constricting

1:05:54.540 --> 1:05:57.180
 and some and dilating others.

1:05:57.180 --> 1:05:59.220
 It's just that kind of hypertension,

1:05:59.220 --> 1:06:01.380
 chronic hypertension is just bad.

1:06:01.380 --> 1:06:03.740
 And so chronic stress truly is bad.

1:06:03.740 --> 1:06:05.580
 I want to really make that clear

1:06:05.580 --> 1:06:07.860
 because I emphasized a lot of what some

1:06:07.860 --> 1:06:09.460
 of the positive effects of stress

1:06:09.460 --> 1:06:12.780
 but you want to be able to tamp down your stress

1:06:12.780 --> 1:06:14.020
 in real time.

1:06:14.020 --> 1:06:16.200
 You also want to be able to modulate your stress

1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:18.340
 and your emotional relationship to stress

1:06:18.340 --> 1:06:20.180
 in the body in the medium term

1:06:20.180 --> 1:06:22.380
 but by no means do you want to be stressed out

1:06:22.380 --> 1:06:24.700
 all the time chronically for months and months

1:06:24.700 --> 1:06:26.200
 and months and years on end.

1:06:27.880 --> 1:06:32.080
 The best tools, the best mechanisms that we know

1:06:32.080 --> 1:06:34.040
 to modulate long-term stress

1:06:34.040 --> 1:06:35.640
 might surprise you a little bit.

1:06:36.900 --> 1:06:39.360
 First of all, there are going to be the things

1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:41.280
 that don't surprise you, which is everyone knows

1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:44.540
 getting regular exercise, getting good sleep,

1:06:44.540 --> 1:06:46.740
 using real-time tools to try and tamp down

1:06:46.740 --> 1:06:48.260
 the stress response, et cetera.

1:06:48.260 --> 1:06:50.100
 That's all going to be really useful.

1:06:51.580 --> 1:06:56.060
 The data really point to the fact that social connection

1:06:56.060 --> 1:06:59.300
 and certain types of social connection in particular

1:06:59.300 --> 1:07:04.140
 are what are going to mitigate or reduce long-term stress.

1:07:04.140 --> 1:07:06.940
 And this is a particularly important issue nowadays

1:07:06.940 --> 1:07:10.300
 where we have all these proxies or surrogates

1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:11.860
 for social connection.

1:07:11.860 --> 1:07:14.060
 We're online and texting with people a lot

1:07:14.060 --> 1:07:15.500
 so we can feel connected.

1:07:15.500 --> 1:07:17.180
 People are like the plane's about to take off

1:07:17.180 --> 1:07:19.160
 and everyone's texting each other.

1:07:19.160 --> 1:07:20.740
 Whether or not they have fear of flying or not,

1:07:20.740 --> 1:07:23.240
 they're like, okay, see you, love you, hate you,

1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:25.940
 whatever it is that they're trying to communicate to people.

1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:29.600
 Then plane lands, everyone phones out,

1:07:29.600 --> 1:07:30.780
 see you, love you, hate you.

1:07:30.780 --> 1:07:32.460
 Let's hope it's fewer hate yous.

1:07:32.460 --> 1:07:35.160
 But everyone has this kind of need to stay connected

1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:36.000
 to one another.

1:07:36.000 --> 1:07:38.340
 Humans are incredibly social creatures.

1:07:38.340 --> 1:07:40.620
 Now, there is a way to look at this whole business

1:07:40.620 --> 1:07:41.940
 of social connection,

1:07:41.940 --> 1:07:45.860
 not from just the kind of wishy-washy, new agey perspective.

1:07:45.860 --> 1:07:47.500
 And I want to point out that sometimes I'll say

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:49.100
 wishy-washy, new agey.

1:07:49.100 --> 1:07:50.680
 I have nothing against that.

1:07:52.340 --> 1:07:55.580
 My goal here is always to put scientific data

1:07:55.580 --> 1:07:58.140
 and some neurochemistry on things

1:07:58.140 --> 1:08:00.540
 so that for those of you that are into

1:08:00.540 --> 1:08:01.920
 wishy-washy, new agey stuff,

1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:04.440
 you also can arm yourself with some arguments

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:07.940
 for the members of your family and your life

1:08:07.940 --> 1:08:10.820
 that maybe aren't so tuned into the typical language

1:08:10.820 --> 1:08:11.980
 around those practices.

1:08:11.980 --> 1:08:13.860
 Like, oh, connection is really key.

1:08:13.860 --> 1:08:15.020
 We all get oxytocin.

1:08:15.020 --> 1:08:18.020
 Actually, did you know that connection between individuals

1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:20.320
 rarely causes the release of oxytocin?

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.380
 Oxytocin is released in very particular circumstances

1:08:23.380 --> 1:08:28.380
 like post-orgasm, baby and mother, milk let down.

1:08:29.400 --> 1:08:31.660
 It's associated with kind of really intense

1:08:31.660 --> 1:08:34.180
 kinds of pair bonding things of mother and child,

1:08:34.180 --> 1:08:36.280
 also father and child, but especially mother and child

1:08:36.280 --> 1:08:39.620
 because it's relationship to the lactation system.

1:08:39.620 --> 1:08:42.780
 Couples post sex, these kinds of things

1:08:42.780 --> 1:08:46.940
 that were reflect deep kind of layers of our biology.

1:08:46.940 --> 1:08:50.880
 And oxytocin is not just released when we walk in

1:08:50.880 --> 1:08:52.280
 and pat the dog on the head,

1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:53.840
 or we see somebody and we give them a hug

1:08:53.840 --> 1:08:56.260
 and hey, great to see you, fist bump.

1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:58.900
 That's not a situation for oxytocin.

1:08:58.900 --> 1:09:00.540
 The way to think about social connection

1:09:00.540 --> 1:09:02.540
 and how it can mitigate

1:09:02.540 --> 1:09:04.740
 some of the long-term effects of stress

1:09:04.740 --> 1:09:07.900
 is really through the systems of neuromodulation

1:09:07.900 --> 1:09:12.900
 like serotonin and through blocking certain things

1:09:13.740 --> 1:09:16.600
 that are really bad for us when we feel socially isolated,

1:09:16.600 --> 1:09:17.780
 things like tachykinins.

1:09:17.780 --> 1:09:18.780
 So let me explain what these are.

1:09:18.780 --> 1:09:21.020
 Serotonin again is a neuromodulator.

1:09:21.020 --> 1:09:23.340
 Neuromodulators are a little bit like playlists

1:09:23.340 --> 1:09:24.180
 in the brain.

1:09:24.180 --> 1:09:26.460
 They tend to amplify or bias the likelihood

1:09:26.460 --> 1:09:28.320
 that certain brain circuits and body circuits

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:31.700
 are going to be activated and that others will not.

1:09:31.700 --> 1:09:35.100
 Serotonin generally, and I realize I'm speaking

1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:37.420
 very generally here, but it generally gives us feelings

1:09:37.420 --> 1:09:39.020
 of wellbeing at very high levels.

1:09:39.020 --> 1:09:42.020
 It makes us feel blissed and it tends to make us feel

1:09:42.020 --> 1:09:44.640
 like we have enough in our immediate environment.

1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:47.420
 This is why some of the side effects of antidepressants

1:09:47.420 --> 1:09:49.820
 that elevate serotonin and actually can help a lot of people

1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:51.260
 with depressive symptoms.

1:09:51.260 --> 1:09:54.220
 But the side effects associated with drugs

1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:57.700
 that increase serotonin tend to be reduced affect.

1:09:57.700 --> 1:10:00.300
 They tend to kind of blunt affect or make people feel

1:10:00.300 --> 1:10:04.180
 like their libido is lower, desire goes down

1:10:04.180 --> 1:10:07.020
 because the body has so much serotonin

1:10:07.020 --> 1:10:08.140
 and the brain has so much serotonin

1:10:08.140 --> 1:10:10.300
 that one feels like they have enough.

1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:13.300
 But serotonin, pharmacology aside

1:10:13.300 --> 1:10:18.120
 or taking antidepressants aside, topic for another time,

1:10:18.120 --> 1:10:20.040
 serotonin tends to make us feel good.

1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:22.380
 When we see somebody that we recognize and trust,

1:10:22.380 --> 1:10:25.240
 serotonin is released in the brain.

1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:29.140
 And that has certain positive effects on the immune system

1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:32.860
 and on other systems of neural repair and synapses

1:10:32.860 --> 1:10:35.460
 and things that really reinforce connections in the brain

1:10:35.460 --> 1:10:38.380
 and prevent that long-term withering of connections.

1:10:38.380 --> 1:10:41.600
 So serotonin is tied to social connection.

1:10:41.600 --> 1:10:43.620
 Now, social connection can take many forms.

1:10:43.620 --> 1:10:46.580
 As many of you know, I am very attached to my dog.

1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:48.300
 I hope he's attached to me.

1:10:48.300 --> 1:10:50.180
 He's asleep most of the time, so I don't know.

1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:51.300
 And even if he was awake,

1:10:51.300 --> 1:10:52.560
 I don't really know what I would ask him,

1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:56.940
 but he seems more or less to be attached to me as well.

1:10:56.940 --> 1:11:00.180
 And there's no scientific evidence

1:11:00.180 --> 1:11:02.700
 that it has to be human-human attachment.

1:11:02.700 --> 1:11:04.980
 I do have attachments to humans as well,

1:11:04.980 --> 1:11:08.220
 but you can have attachments to other people.

1:11:08.220 --> 1:11:10.140
 Some of those can be romantic attachments.

1:11:10.140 --> 1:11:12.040
 Those could be familial attachments

1:11:12.040 --> 1:11:15.540
 that are non-romantic, friendship, pets,

1:11:15.540 --> 1:11:18.780
 even attachments to things that just delight us.

1:11:18.780 --> 1:11:21.180
 One of the things that really can mitigate

1:11:21.180 --> 1:11:23.820
 against the long-term negative effects

1:11:23.820 --> 1:11:26.300
 of chronic long-term stress

1:11:26.300 --> 1:11:27.620
 isn't just having fun.

1:11:27.620 --> 1:11:28.460
 We hear all this stuff.

1:11:28.460 --> 1:11:30.180
 You need to play and have fun.

1:11:30.180 --> 1:11:31.800
 That can be a little bit of a tough concept,

1:11:31.800 --> 1:11:33.260
 especially for the hard-driving people

1:11:33.260 --> 1:11:34.560
 or people that are stressed,

1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:36.780
 but having a sense of delight,

1:11:36.780 --> 1:11:39.720
 a sense of really enjoying something that you see

1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:42.820
 and engage in, witness or participate in,

1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:46.100
 that is associated with the serotonin system.

1:11:46.100 --> 1:11:47.960
 And certainly play is one of those things,

1:11:47.960 --> 1:11:49.480
 social connection of various forms.

1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:51.180
 Those are things to invest in.

1:11:51.180 --> 1:11:52.020
 Some people might say,

1:11:52.020 --> 1:11:54.320
 well, nobody wants to be my friend

1:11:54.320 --> 1:11:57.460
 or nobody wants to engage socially anymore.

1:11:57.460 --> 1:11:59.220
 I'll be the first to admit social connection

1:11:59.220 --> 1:12:01.460
 and friendship and relationships of all kinds

1:12:01.460 --> 1:12:05.780
 to animals or humans or inanimate objects takes work.

1:12:05.780 --> 1:12:06.780
 It takes investment.

1:12:06.780 --> 1:12:10.100
 It takes time in not needing everything

1:12:10.100 --> 1:12:12.020
 to be exactly the way you want it to be.

1:12:12.020 --> 1:12:13.620
 I have a friend who struggles with this

1:12:13.620 --> 1:12:16.640
 and oftentimes the conversations just circle back

1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:19.300
 to the fact that when you want social connection,

1:12:19.300 --> 1:12:21.380
 you often have to be more flexible.

1:12:21.380 --> 1:12:22.940
 You have to eat on other people's schedules.

1:12:22.940 --> 1:12:23.880
 Sometimes you have to eat things

1:12:23.880 --> 1:12:26.120
 you don't necessarily want to eat the most in that moment

1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:28.460
 or stay up a little later or wake up a little earlier.

1:12:28.460 --> 1:12:30.580
 Social connection is something that we work for,

1:12:30.580 --> 1:12:33.060
 but it is incredibly powerful.

1:12:33.060 --> 1:12:35.780
 I want to, of course, tip my hat to,

1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:39.540
 it's only appropriate to call him the great Robert Sapolsky,

1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:43.040
 my colleague who I'm fortunate to know at Stanford,

1:12:43.040 --> 1:12:44.640
 of course, has talked about this quite a lot.

1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:47.700
 So I want to acknowledge Robert's incredible work

1:12:47.700 --> 1:12:48.940
 and discussions around this.

1:12:48.940 --> 1:12:50.640
 You can look up those materials online

1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:52.120
 and his wonderful books.

1:12:52.120 --> 1:12:56.340
 But primates, and we are primates, we are social species.

1:12:56.340 --> 1:12:58.780
 And as Robert has said many times before,

1:12:58.780 --> 1:13:02.800
 never before in any primate history,

1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.220
 but in particular in human history,

1:13:04.220 --> 1:13:07.300
 have we interacted with so many strangers at a distance

1:13:07.300 --> 1:13:09.660
 when we are not really connected to them.

1:13:09.660 --> 1:13:12.860
 So finding just a few people, even one,

1:13:12.860 --> 1:13:16.280
 or an animal or something that you delight in,

1:13:16.280 --> 1:13:19.500
 believe it or not, has very positive effects

1:13:19.500 --> 1:13:22.340
 on mitigating this long-term stress,

1:13:22.340 --> 1:13:24.660
 on improving various aspects of our life

1:13:24.660 --> 1:13:26.900
 as it relates to stress and emotionality.

1:13:28.020 --> 1:13:29.460
 So that's the social connection part.

1:13:29.460 --> 1:13:32.840
 The other thing is that social isolation that goes too long

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:36.220
 is associated in everything from flies, believe it or not,

1:13:36.220 --> 1:13:39.540
 to mice and humans with this molecule, tachykinin.

1:13:39.540 --> 1:13:44.380
 Tachykinin is a molecule that makes us more fearful,

1:13:44.380 --> 1:13:48.180
 paranoid, and impairs our immune system.

1:13:48.180 --> 1:13:51.860
 And so tachykinin is like this internal punishment signal.

1:13:51.860 --> 1:13:53.940
 It's like our body and our brain telling us

1:13:53.940 --> 1:13:55.260
 you're not spending enough time

1:13:55.260 --> 1:13:56.580
 with people that you really trust.

1:13:56.580 --> 1:13:59.500
 You're not spending time doing things that you really enjoy.

1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:01.780
 And I often think about tachykinin for myself

1:14:01.780 --> 1:14:03.000
 because I'm pretty hard driving.

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:03.900
 I have a lot of pursuits.

1:14:03.900 --> 1:14:05.700
 I also have a lot of wonderful people

1:14:05.700 --> 1:14:08.900
 and an incredibly wonderful bulldog in my life.

1:14:08.900 --> 1:14:11.620
 But there are times when I can be so goal-directed

1:14:11.620 --> 1:14:14.420
 and so in motion and trying to accomplish everything

1:14:14.420 --> 1:14:18.220
 that I sometimes forget about tachykinin.

1:14:18.220 --> 1:14:19.580
 And I like to remind myself so much

1:14:19.580 --> 1:14:21.820
 so that I actually have a little post-it above my desk

1:14:21.820 --> 1:14:23.780
 that says tachykinin to remind me

1:14:23.780 --> 1:14:26.180
 that tachykinin is this very sinister molecule

1:14:26.180 --> 1:14:27.900
 that starts being secreted

1:14:27.900 --> 1:14:31.100
 when we are not socially connected enough.

1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:34.520
 And this is why long meals with friends or family

1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:36.500
 where there are, we'll talk about phones in a moment,

1:14:36.500 --> 1:14:39.060
 but where there's no intrusions, or even if there are,

1:14:39.060 --> 1:14:43.020
 just feeling like we are connected suppresses tachykinin.

1:14:43.020 --> 1:14:45.900
 And tachykinin is something you really want to avoid

1:14:45.900 --> 1:14:50.540
 because chronic isolation, chronically high tachykinin

1:14:50.540 --> 1:14:52.380
 that's associated with long-term stress

1:14:52.380 --> 1:14:56.140
 really depletes so many good functions of our brain and body

1:14:56.140 --> 1:14:59.300
 and promote so many bad ones, including irritability,

1:14:59.300 --> 1:15:01.660
 paranoia, fear, et cetera,

1:15:01.660 --> 1:15:03.420
 that is really something to avoid.

1:15:03.420 --> 1:15:06.300
 And so I want to highlight tachykinin as something to avoid.

1:15:06.300 --> 1:15:09.420
 I don't want to completely disregard oxytocin.

1:15:09.420 --> 1:15:12.140
 It's just that oxytocin has been built up a lot in the media

1:15:12.140 --> 1:15:15.560
 and really serotonin works on much faster timescales.

1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:17.380
 Now, how do you know if you're making serotonin?

1:15:17.380 --> 1:15:18.900
 You don't know in the moment,

1:15:18.900 --> 1:15:21.020
 but you can learn if you pay attention

1:15:21.020 --> 1:15:23.820
 to kind of recognize these feelings of comfort,

1:15:23.820 --> 1:15:28.460
 trust, bliss, delight, and those are not weak terms.

1:15:28.460 --> 1:15:31.220
 Those are not associated just with psychological terms.

1:15:31.220 --> 1:15:34.740
 They are every bit as physiological

1:15:34.740 --> 1:15:36.300
 as the movement of your muscles

1:15:36.300 --> 1:15:38.060
 or the secretion of adrenaline.

1:15:38.060 --> 1:15:41.420
 And many people focus now on gratitude.

1:15:41.420 --> 1:15:43.300
 Gratitude is a little bit subjective

1:15:43.300 --> 1:15:45.360
 and here we're moving from some objective

1:15:45.360 --> 1:15:46.500
 to kind of subjective things,

1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:49.740
 but recognizing and in particular writing down

1:15:49.740 --> 1:15:51.500
 things that you're thankful for,

1:15:51.500 --> 1:15:53.900
 however small they may seem,

1:15:53.900 --> 1:15:57.760
 does seem to have a positive effect on the serotonin system.

1:15:57.760 --> 1:15:59.300
 Now, there are a plethora of things

1:15:59.300 --> 1:16:00.880
 that will also impact wellbeing

1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:04.900
 and allow you to modulate your long-term stress,

1:16:04.900 --> 1:16:07.860
 reduce the likelihood that you'll engage in long-term stress

1:16:07.860 --> 1:16:09.200
 and we don't have time to go into all of these,

1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:11.540
 but of course, finding the diet and nutrition

1:16:11.540 --> 1:16:12.700
 that's right for you, the exercise schedule,

1:16:12.700 --> 1:16:15.220
 that's right for you, the sleep schedule, all that,

1:16:15.220 --> 1:16:20.140
 but do not underemphasize the social connection part, please.

1:16:20.140 --> 1:16:23.200
 As well, there are some compounds

1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:25.320
 that are not antidepressants,

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:26.940
 although if you need antidepressants

1:16:26.940 --> 1:16:28.540
 and a clinician prescribes them to you,

1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:32.260
 please follow their advice if that's what's right for you.

1:16:32.260 --> 1:16:35.420
 There are compounds that are not prescription compounds

1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:38.300
 that can modulate the stress system

1:16:38.300 --> 1:16:40.620
 and sometimes because of the way that life is,

1:16:40.620 --> 1:16:43.760
 we just don't have the opportunity to control life

1:16:43.760 --> 1:16:45.800
 and to control our response to stress

1:16:45.800 --> 1:16:47.220
 and at least for myself,

1:16:47.220 --> 1:16:48.920
 I can only talk about my own experience,

1:16:48.920 --> 1:16:51.700
 I've found it useful in times of chronic stress

1:16:51.700 --> 1:16:53.920
 to start modulating some of the neurochemistry

1:16:53.920 --> 1:16:57.040
 related to the stress response in order to help.

1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:59.700
 Now, if a doctor prescribes you Pregnisone

1:16:59.700 --> 1:17:03.340
 or prescribes you some other hormone or something,

1:17:03.340 --> 1:17:05.580
 that's important, but what I'm talking about now

1:17:05.580 --> 1:17:07.480
 are non-prescription things,

1:17:07.480 --> 1:17:11.300
 you should check out examine.com, this free website,

1:17:11.300 --> 1:17:13.400
 which will allow you to put in any supplement

1:17:13.400 --> 1:17:15.040
 and evaluate that supplement with,

1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:17.820
 they provide links in the so-called human effect matrix

1:17:17.820 --> 1:17:21.180
 to PubMed, it tells you the exact subjects they were done in

1:17:21.180 --> 1:17:23.460
 it was a post-menopausal women, was it kids,

1:17:23.460 --> 1:17:27.280
 was it normal adults, was it people with autism, et cetera.

1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:29.500
 Check out that site for any and all supplements

1:17:29.500 --> 1:17:32.000
 you're considering or taking, I highly recommend it,

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.680
 I have no relationship to them,

1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:35.000
 I just think it's a wonderful site

1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:37.460
 that's curated all this important information,

1:17:37.460 --> 1:17:41.320
 but some of these compounds are effective enough,

1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:43.260
 they can kind of take the edge off

1:17:43.260 --> 1:17:46.040
 and I'll use them periodically myself

1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:47.300
 and so I just thought I'd mention them

1:17:47.300 --> 1:17:48.740
 since there are a number of you that are interested in them,

1:17:48.740 --> 1:17:49.980
 the three I wanna focus on

1:17:49.980 --> 1:17:52.540
 and one that I think you need to be cautious about

1:17:52.540 --> 1:17:57.220
 that I've mentioned before include Ashwagandha,

1:17:57.220 --> 1:17:59.920
 funny name, but that's what it's called,

1:17:59.920 --> 1:18:03.300
 L-theanine or theanine it's often called and melatonin.

1:18:03.300 --> 1:18:04.700
 Let's talk about melatonin first,

1:18:04.700 --> 1:18:06.880
 melatonin I talked about during the month on sleep,

1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:10.060
 melatonin is a hormone secreted from the pineal

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:12.740
 in direct relationship to how much darkness you are in,

1:18:12.740 --> 1:18:16.420
 not emotional darkness, but light suppresses melatonin,

1:18:16.420 --> 1:18:17.820
 melatonin helps you fall asleep,

1:18:17.820 --> 1:18:19.180
 it doesn't help you stay asleep,

1:18:19.180 --> 1:18:23.740
 I personally do not recommend supplementing melatonin

1:18:23.740 --> 1:18:27.320
 because it's supplemented typically at very high levels,

1:18:28.380 --> 1:18:30.440
 one to three milligrams or even more,

1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:32.660
 that is an outrageously high dose,

1:18:32.660 --> 1:18:34.760
 it's super, super physiological compared

1:18:34.760 --> 1:18:36.020
 to what you normally would make,

1:18:36.020 --> 1:18:39.220
 it also has a number of potentially negative effects

1:18:39.220 --> 1:18:42.860
 on the reproductive axis and hormones there,

1:18:42.860 --> 1:18:45.100
 some people can take it without problems if you like it

1:18:45.100 --> 1:18:46.500
 and that's your thing, fine,

1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:48.480
 I just wanna cue to the fact that there can be issues,

1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:50.900
 you should check on examine.com, talk to your doctor,

1:18:50.900 --> 1:18:53.340
 especially in kids because melatonin suppresses

1:18:53.340 --> 1:18:55.900
 the puberty response in a number of species,

1:18:55.900 --> 1:18:57.620
 enough about the negative things of melatonin

1:18:57.620 --> 1:19:02.620
 except that people who take too much melatonin chronically,

1:19:02.700 --> 1:19:04.740
 oftentimes when they're taking it to sleep

1:19:04.740 --> 1:19:05.900
 or for whatever reason,

1:19:05.900 --> 1:19:08.460
 yes, it can reduce anxiety and stress,

1:19:08.460 --> 1:19:11.240
 but it also can reduce the output of the adrenals

1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:13.440
 to the point where it can become problematic,

1:19:13.440 --> 1:19:16.560
 now, a note about adrenal burnout,

1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:20.340
 there is actually no such thing as adrenal burnout

1:19:20.340 --> 1:19:21.660
 under normal conditions,

1:19:21.660 --> 1:19:23.740
 the adrenals have enough adrenaline

1:19:23.740 --> 1:19:28.060
 to support 200 years of stress for better or for worse,

1:19:28.060 --> 1:19:31.380
 the concept of adrenal burnout has origins

1:19:31.380 --> 1:19:34.660
 in the work of Nobel Prize winner, Hans Selye

1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:36.240
 who actually discovered

1:19:36.240 --> 1:19:38.100
 what he called the general adaptation syndrome,

1:19:38.100 --> 1:19:39.900
 he discovered a lot of things about stress,

1:19:39.900 --> 1:19:42.980
 he did some phenomenal work that turned out to be true,

1:19:42.980 --> 1:19:46.060
 that we have stressors, there's something called distress,

1:19:46.060 --> 1:19:48.060
 he talked about eustress, which is positive stress,

1:19:48.060 --> 1:19:49.700
 eustress has never really caught on

1:19:49.700 --> 1:19:52.620
 in the kind of more general discussion,

1:19:52.620 --> 1:19:56.300
 but he had this theory that if stress went on long enough

1:19:56.300 --> 1:19:59.520
 that you would eventually reach a phase called exhaustion

1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:02.440
 and that turned out to be wrong,

1:20:03.280 --> 1:20:05.820
 although many of you may feel exhausted after chronic stress

1:20:05.820 --> 1:20:08.680
 there isn't really a physiological exhaustion that happens

1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:10.700
 and that eventually got picked up

1:20:10.700 --> 1:20:12.600
 and ran with the general public

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:14.100
 and they talk about adrenal burnout,

1:20:14.100 --> 1:20:16.700
 too much coffee, adrenal burnout, you hear all this stuff,

1:20:16.700 --> 1:20:18.220
 there is no such thing as adrenal burnout,

1:20:18.220 --> 1:20:20.080
 the adrenals don't burn out,

1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:22.620
 there is something however called adrenal insufficiency

1:20:22.620 --> 1:20:25.560
 syndrome, which is a real physiological problem

1:20:25.560 --> 1:20:28.100
 where some people have very impaired adrenals

1:20:28.100 --> 1:20:29.460
 and they can't produce adrenaline

1:20:29.460 --> 1:20:32.180
 and melatonin taken at very high levels

1:20:32.180 --> 1:20:34.000
 for periods of time that are too long

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.020
 can cause suppression of the cortisol

1:20:36.020 --> 1:20:37.620
 and epinephrine release from the adrenals

1:20:37.620 --> 1:20:40.880
 and can create a kind of pseudo

1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:43.460
 adrenal insufficiency syndrome,

1:20:43.460 --> 1:20:47.660
 so beware melatonin for that reason,

1:20:47.660 --> 1:20:50.900
 please, I alone can't get rid

1:20:50.900 --> 1:20:52.880
 of the phrase adrenal burnout,

1:20:52.880 --> 1:20:55.260
 I'm not trying to give a hard time

1:20:55.260 --> 1:20:57.600
 to anyone who feels burnt out or exhausted

1:20:57.600 --> 1:20:59.140
 but it is for other reasons,

1:20:59.140 --> 1:21:01.220
 it is not because the adrenals are burnt out

1:21:01.220 --> 1:21:03.680
 unless you happen to have adrenal insufficiency syndrome,

1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:06.620
 so I'm not a fan of melatonin for a lot of reasons,

1:21:06.620 --> 1:21:07.460
 now I've mentioned several,

1:21:07.460 --> 1:21:10.200
 the other is L-theanine, I've talked about L-theanine

1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:12.600
 which provided it's safe for you

1:21:12.600 --> 1:21:15.200
 can be taken 100 milligrams or 200 milligrams

1:21:15.200 --> 1:21:17.220
 about a 30 minutes or 60 minutes before sleep,

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:19.140
 it can enhance the transition to sleep

1:21:19.140 --> 1:21:20.900
 and depth of sleep for many people,

1:21:21.740 --> 1:21:24.340
 it increases GABA, this inhibitory neurotransmitter

1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:26.020
 in the brain, it tends to turn off

1:21:26.020 --> 1:21:27.380
 our forebrain a little bit

1:21:27.380 --> 1:21:29.820
 or reduce the activity of our kind of thinking systems

1:21:29.820 --> 1:21:32.620
 and ruminating systems help people fall asleep,

1:21:32.620 --> 1:21:35.800
 that's for sleep but theanine has also been shown

1:21:35.800 --> 1:21:37.240
 for people that are chronically anxious

1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:40.300
 or chronically stressed to, if you look at the studies,

1:21:40.300 --> 1:21:42.540
 I have a large collection of studies in front of me right now

1:21:42.540 --> 1:21:43.880
 if you want to see those links,

1:21:43.880 --> 1:21:45.820
 I know if you want those, go to examine.com,

1:21:45.820 --> 1:21:47.940
 put in theanine, they link to, for instance,

1:21:47.940 --> 1:21:50.360
 it is known to significantly increase relaxation,

1:21:50.360 --> 1:21:52.820
 there are four studies listed there with PubMed links,

1:21:52.820 --> 1:21:55.140
 it is known to have a minor effect on anxiety

1:21:55.140 --> 1:21:56.880
 but eight studies have shown that

1:21:57.780 --> 1:22:00.460
 which I think is a fairly large set of studies,

1:22:00.460 --> 1:22:02.580
 some of them in great journals,

1:22:02.580 --> 1:22:05.900
 it also can reduce task completion anxiety,

1:22:05.900 --> 1:22:07.980
 so anxiety related to task completion,

1:22:07.980 --> 1:22:09.700
 not good for the procrastinators perhaps

1:22:09.700 --> 1:22:11.460
 but for those of you that are chronically stressed,

1:22:11.460 --> 1:22:12.700
 it can increase attention a little bit,

1:22:12.700 --> 1:22:14.460
 it can reduce blood pressure a little bit,

1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:17.020
 improve sleep quality, et cetera,

1:22:17.020 --> 1:22:19.000
 it definitely has a notable effect on stress,

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.360
 two studies in particular

1:22:21.220 --> 1:22:24.120
 that it can notably reduce the effects of stress,

1:22:24.120 --> 1:22:27.980
 so there's a lot there, it also has effects on insomnia,

1:22:27.980 --> 1:22:29.540
 on some blood lipid profiles

1:22:29.540 --> 1:22:32.220
 and so go to examine.com and check it out

1:22:32.220 --> 1:22:35.260
 but this is one reason why I supplement theanine for sleep

1:22:35.260 --> 1:22:37.780
 but if I'm feeling like I've been under a lot of stress

1:22:37.780 --> 1:22:39.740
 and I'm not managing my stress very well

1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:42.140
 with the short-term and medium-term tools

1:22:42.140 --> 1:22:43.120
 that I talked about earlier,

1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:44.860
 I might start taking a little bit of theanine

1:22:44.860 --> 1:22:46.140
 especially in the late afternoon

1:22:46.140 --> 1:22:48.460
 which is when I tend to start to feel

1:22:48.460 --> 1:22:50.140
 like I haven't gotten enough done

1:22:50.140 --> 1:22:52.020
 and the day is kind of carrying on

1:22:52.020 --> 1:22:54.760
 and so you can blunt the response to stress a little bit

1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:56.780
 which is why a lot of companies

1:22:56.780 --> 1:22:59.220
 are now putting theanine into energy drinks,

1:22:59.220 --> 1:23:02.620
 I am not a big fan of most energy drinks,

1:23:02.620 --> 1:23:04.260
 most of them have taurine

1:23:04.260 --> 1:23:05.700
 which I know some of you wrote to me and said,

1:23:05.700 --> 1:23:07.660
 oh, taurine is great for all these reasons,

1:23:07.660 --> 1:23:09.740
 taurine also has effects on the microvasculature

1:23:09.740 --> 1:23:11.100
 that at least for me were not good,

1:23:11.100 --> 1:23:13.720
 it caused bursting of microvasculature in my sclera,

1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:15.860
 in my eyes, which is why I'm not a fan

1:23:15.860 --> 1:23:20.300
 of any energy drink that has taurine or taurine generally

1:23:20.300 --> 1:23:22.160
 but that's just me, you have to decide for you,

1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:23.260
 I'm sure the comment section,

1:23:23.260 --> 1:23:25.760
 there'll be a couple taurinistas out there that will say,

1:23:25.760 --> 1:23:27.680
 but I love taurine, great,

1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:29.060
 keep the taurine companies in business

1:23:29.060 --> 1:23:31.380
 but it's not for me and I'd like people to know

1:23:31.380 --> 1:23:33.940
 that it may or may not be for them.

1:23:33.940 --> 1:23:37.340
 The other supplement that can be very useful is ashwagandha,

1:23:37.340 --> 1:23:41.300
 ashwagandha is known to lower anxiety and cortisol,

1:23:41.300 --> 1:23:45.060
 there is six, there are, excuse me, six studies

1:23:45.060 --> 1:23:47.600
 that collectively show reductions in cortisol

1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:49.560
 which is cortisol is typically associated

1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:51.380
 with waking up in the morning, which is good,

1:23:51.380 --> 1:23:54.160
 that's a healthy brief cortisol bump that goes away

1:23:54.160 --> 1:23:56.780
 provided you're getting your light at the right time of days

1:23:56.780 --> 1:24:00.160
 at right correct times of day, like morning and evening

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:02.220
 but you don't want cortisol chronically elevated,

1:24:02.220 --> 1:24:05.420
 that's associated with all the bad stuff about stress,

1:24:05.420 --> 1:24:09.300
 there's a very strong effect of ashwagandha,

1:24:09.300 --> 1:24:12.060
 you can find dosages at examine.com,

1:24:12.060 --> 1:24:14.300
 they report in across six studies,

1:24:14.300 --> 1:24:18.660
 14.5 to 27.9 reduction in cortisol

1:24:18.660 --> 1:24:22.460
 in otherwise healthy but stressed individuals.

1:24:22.460 --> 1:24:23.760
 Now, I don't know about kids,

1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:26.780
 you have to look at what it says on various supplements,

1:24:26.780 --> 1:24:28.760
 most things here are being done in adults

1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:31.420
 so please check carefully but this is great,

1:24:31.420 --> 1:24:33.460
 I mean, the opportunity for me anyway

1:24:33.460 --> 1:24:35.980
 to be able to take something that can help me

1:24:35.980 --> 1:24:38.340
 reduce my cortisol so that I don't get

1:24:38.340 --> 1:24:39.900
 some of the long-term effects of stress

1:24:39.900 --> 1:24:41.880
 and I'm not gonna take ashwagandha year round,

1:24:41.880 --> 1:24:43.300
 I would only do this if I was feeling like

1:24:43.300 --> 1:24:46.300
 I wasn't managing my short and medium term stress well

1:24:46.300 --> 1:24:47.740
 so I don't take it on a regular basis,

1:24:47.740 --> 1:24:50.260
 I do take it when I'm in these times

1:24:50.260 --> 1:24:52.660
 when things are particularly stressful.

1:24:52.660 --> 1:24:54.660
 It has, there are five other studies

1:24:54.660 --> 1:24:59.140
 that show reduced stress so that's not cortisol measurements

1:24:59.140 --> 1:25:03.680
 but things like fatigue, cognitive impairment, et cetera.

1:25:03.680 --> 1:25:05.620
 It does lower total cholesterol

1:25:05.620 --> 1:25:09.720
 which may or may not be good or bad for you up to 10%

1:25:09.720 --> 1:25:11.700
 so some people don't want their cholesterol lowered,

1:25:11.700 --> 1:25:13.100
 some people might.

1:25:13.100 --> 1:25:16.060
 Cholesterol, we'll talk about this in a month on hormones

1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:17.740
 but cholesterol is the molecule

1:25:17.740 --> 1:25:19.540
 from which testosterone and estrogen

1:25:19.540 --> 1:25:21.740
 and cortisol for that matter are synthesized

1:25:21.740 --> 1:25:23.740
 so you don't wanna get your cholesterol so low

1:25:23.740 --> 1:25:25.620
 then there are all sorts of negative effects

1:25:25.620 --> 1:25:27.820
 but you don't want it too high either.

1:25:27.820 --> 1:25:30.020
 Mild effects in good clinical studies

1:25:30.020 --> 1:25:32.740
 on reducing depression probably associated

1:25:32.740 --> 1:25:35.880
 with the effects on stress and some other things as well.

1:25:35.880 --> 1:25:39.060
 So ashwagandha is something I use from time to time,

1:25:39.060 --> 1:25:40.400
 it's kind of interesting.

1:25:40.400 --> 1:25:44.820
 L-theanine, I rarely will use those during the daytime

1:25:44.820 --> 1:25:45.940
 except under conditions

1:25:45.940 --> 1:25:47.440
 where I'm feeling chronically stressed.

1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:50.280
 So check out the human effect matrix on examine.com.

1:25:50.280 --> 1:25:52.280
 Again, a phenomenal website.

1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:54.820
 I think I've sent them a few emails before

1:25:54.820 --> 1:25:56.900
 that's the only exchanges I've ever had with them

1:25:56.900 --> 1:25:57.940
 but I just think it's wonderful

1:25:57.940 --> 1:25:59.300
 that they put together this resource.

1:25:59.300 --> 1:26:01.440
 Otherwise, we'd be stuck mining PubMed.

1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:04.800
 They've collated the papers from PubMed

1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:07.620
 with links to PubMed, so terrific resource.

1:26:07.620 --> 1:26:10.500
 So social connection and some supplementation,

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:14.060
 of course, diet, exercise, sleep for long-term stress.

1:26:14.060 --> 1:26:17.740
 And now we are finally in a position to talk

1:26:17.740 --> 1:26:21.220
 about what we have set out to do from the beginning

1:26:21.220 --> 1:26:24.180
 which is spend the month on emotions.

1:26:24.180 --> 1:26:27.060
 It was very important that we discuss stress

1:26:27.060 --> 1:26:29.020
 and we discuss in the context of short,

1:26:29.020 --> 1:26:30.600
 medium and long-term stress,

1:26:30.600 --> 1:26:33.100
 that we discuss tools for short-term,

1:26:33.100 --> 1:26:35.980
 medium-term and long-term control.

1:26:35.980 --> 1:26:38.060
 I don't really want to say mitigation of stress.

1:26:38.060 --> 1:26:39.060
 Stress is going to happen

1:26:39.060 --> 1:26:42.140
 but our ability to modulate and control stress

1:26:42.140 --> 1:26:46.500
 in real time, offline, using tools such as respiration,

1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:48.340
 using tools such as dilation of gaze,

1:26:48.340 --> 1:26:50.880
 using tools like social connection, maybe some supplements.

1:26:50.880 --> 1:26:54.140
 Certainly take care of your sleep and nutrition

1:26:54.140 --> 1:26:55.160
 and exercise.

1:26:56.340 --> 1:26:58.860
 Again, tons of resources and information

1:26:58.860 --> 1:27:00.260
 in the sleep episodes.

1:27:00.260 --> 1:27:01.100
 So you can look there.

1:27:01.100 --> 1:27:05.140
 We will do a month on hormones, on exercise, et cetera.

1:27:05.140 --> 1:27:06.720
 But let's talk about emotions

1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:09.840
 because in subsequent episodes,

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:11.620
 we're going to talk about OCD.

1:27:11.620 --> 1:27:13.000
 We're going to talk about depression.

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:14.920
 We're going to talk about mania.

1:27:14.920 --> 1:27:16.620
 We're going to be talking about dopamine

1:27:16.620 --> 1:27:17.540
 and all sorts of things.

1:27:17.540 --> 1:27:22.340
 But at the core of emotions is this question,

1:27:22.340 --> 1:27:23.780
 what is an emotion?

1:27:23.780 --> 1:27:24.900
 Well, it's complex.

1:27:24.900 --> 1:27:26.280
 There isn't a single brain area

1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:28.980
 for any one of these things that we call emotions.

1:27:28.980 --> 1:27:31.740
 My framework, and I think the modern science,

1:27:31.740 --> 1:27:36.740
 both psychology and neuroscience is pretty well aligned

1:27:37.180 --> 1:27:41.560
 with what Lisa Feldman Barrett has talked about.

1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:43.220
 Now, Lisa's at Northeastern University.

1:27:43.220 --> 1:27:44.380
 She runs a big lab there.

1:27:44.380 --> 1:27:46.540
 She's a world expert in emotion.

1:27:46.540 --> 1:27:48.500
 She's written two books that are really wonderful.

1:27:48.500 --> 1:27:51.340
 One is How Emotions Are Made, which was her first book.

1:27:51.340 --> 1:27:55.540
 The second one is Seven and a Half Facts About the Brain.

1:27:55.540 --> 1:27:56.780
 It's a wonderful book as well.

1:27:56.780 --> 1:27:58.140
 It came out more recently.

1:27:58.140 --> 1:28:00.180
 I hosted Lisa on an Instagram Live once.

1:28:00.180 --> 1:28:03.420
 Maybe we'll get her here on the podcast if we're lucky.

1:28:03.420 --> 1:28:05.020
 We don't agree on everything

1:28:05.020 --> 1:28:06.340
 about the neuroscience of emotions,

1:28:06.340 --> 1:28:11.020
 but I subscribe to most everything that I've heard Lisa say,

1:28:11.020 --> 1:28:15.100
 in particular, the fact that emotions are context dependent,

1:28:15.100 --> 1:28:17.500
 there's a cultural dependence, et cetera.

1:28:17.500 --> 1:28:19.860
 I look at things mainly through the lens of physiology

1:28:19.860 --> 1:28:23.080
 and neuroscience at kind of low level circuitry.

1:28:23.080 --> 1:28:25.740
 And one way to think about emotions

1:28:25.740 --> 1:28:27.140
 that I think is consistent,

1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:28.860
 and I think Lisa would generally approve,

1:28:28.860 --> 1:28:29.700
 I can't speak for her,

1:28:29.700 --> 1:28:31.020
 but I would hope she would generally approve

1:28:31.020 --> 1:28:34.440
 of this description is that when our internal state

1:28:34.440 --> 1:28:38.980
 of stress or calm matches the demands on us

1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:41.260
 or is mismatched from the demands on us,

1:28:41.260 --> 1:28:44.500
 we tend to interpret those as good or bad.

1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:46.300
 Let me give you an example.

1:28:46.300 --> 1:28:51.300
 If I am feeling very anxious, very stressed inside,

1:28:51.700 --> 1:28:55.740
 and I have a lot to do, that doesn't feel good,

1:28:55.740 --> 1:28:59.280
 but it's really no different than if I'm very tired

1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:01.460
 and I have a lot to do because there's this mismatch.

1:29:01.460 --> 1:29:04.360
 I'm not in the right internal state.

1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:06.300
 My internal state isn't correct rather

1:29:06.300 --> 1:29:08.820
 to meet the demands that are being placed upon me.

1:29:08.820 --> 1:29:10.900
 So in both cases, whether I'm too tired

1:29:10.900 --> 1:29:13.460
 or I'm too stressed to do what I need to do,

1:29:13.460 --> 1:29:16.900
 the valence, meaning the value that I assigned to that is,

1:29:16.900 --> 1:29:18.300
 I don't feel good.

1:29:18.300 --> 1:29:20.880
 It's not a good situation and I don't feel good.

1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:23.020
 Now I might call it stressed, I might call it anxious,

1:29:23.020 --> 1:29:25.920
 I might call it worried, might call it a number of things,

1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:26.760
 but it's not good.

1:29:26.760 --> 1:29:31.140
 However, when I'm tired and I want to fall asleep,

1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:33.500
 well then I feel good because that's what the demand is.

1:29:33.500 --> 1:29:35.060
 I need to go to sleep and I'm tired.

1:29:35.060 --> 1:29:37.600
 If I'm wide awake and I need to fall asleep,

1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:38.620
 then that's not good.

1:29:38.620 --> 1:29:42.180
 And then the brain tends to go down the direction

1:29:42.180 --> 1:29:44.500
 of interpreting the situation as a bad one.

1:29:44.500 --> 1:29:48.260
 So while the discussion around emotions is far more nuanced

1:29:48.260 --> 1:29:50.420
 and more elaborate than this,

1:29:50.420 --> 1:29:52.780
 one way to think about your relationship to emotions

1:29:52.780 --> 1:29:54.620
 is whether or not your internal state

1:29:54.620 --> 1:29:57.520
 is matching the demands that are upon you.

1:29:57.520 --> 1:30:01.380
 So in that way, we don't really place so much value

1:30:01.380 --> 1:30:03.800
 on whether or not we're feeling alert or sleepy.

1:30:03.800 --> 1:30:06.760
 We only place value on whether or not that alertness,

1:30:06.760 --> 1:30:09.020
 whether or not it's full-blown stress or not,

1:30:09.020 --> 1:30:11.500
 or our sleepiness, whether or not we're falling asleep

1:30:11.500 --> 1:30:12.980
 or just a little bit drowsy,

1:30:12.980 --> 1:30:16.540
 whether or not that matches the conditions that we face.

1:30:16.540 --> 1:30:18.380
 And it's a useful framework to have.

1:30:18.380 --> 1:30:20.000
 And it's the reason in part

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:22.940
 why I spent this last hour and a half or so

1:30:22.940 --> 1:30:25.780
 talking about stress and how to control stress.

1:30:25.780 --> 1:30:26.700
 One reason we did that

1:30:26.700 --> 1:30:28.500
 is because I think it's a valuable opportunity

1:30:28.500 --> 1:30:30.660
 to learn some tools and understand stress

1:30:30.660 --> 1:30:32.540
 and really learn how to take control of stress,

1:30:32.540 --> 1:30:34.500
 which I think we could all benefit from doing,

1:30:34.500 --> 1:30:35.980
 regardless of age.

1:30:35.980 --> 1:30:38.180
 The other reason is that when you start to understand

1:30:38.180 --> 1:30:40.660
 that you have this kind of seesaw system in your body,

1:30:40.660 --> 1:30:42.200
 this autonomic nervous system

1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:45.780
 that takes you from alert and calm to stressed,

1:30:45.780 --> 1:30:48.220
 to full-blown panic, it has that capacity,

1:30:48.220 --> 1:30:53.220
 or from sleepy and drowsy to passing out tired

1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:57.300
 to God forbid, let's hope never, but a coma, right?

1:30:57.300 --> 1:31:00.580
 That you're basically on this seesaw all the time.

1:31:00.580 --> 1:31:03.840
 And where you are on that seesaw of alertness or calmness

1:31:03.840 --> 1:31:08.340
 positions you to be in better reaction

1:31:08.340 --> 1:31:10.740
 to the demands that you face,

1:31:10.740 --> 1:31:12.180
 whether or not the thing that you face

1:31:12.180 --> 1:31:15.200
 is a need to fall asleep or to listen quietly and not react.

1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:16.900
 You now know, for instance,

1:31:16.900 --> 1:31:19.860
 that if your job is to take feedback,

1:31:19.860 --> 1:31:21.640
 maybe you're going in for a job evaluation,

1:31:21.640 --> 1:31:23.380
 or you're in a relationship

1:31:23.380 --> 1:31:26.300
 where there was a call for a discussion

1:31:26.300 --> 1:31:28.220
 and somebody needs to talk to you about something

1:31:28.220 --> 1:31:29.500
 and we need to talk about something,

1:31:29.500 --> 1:31:30.340
 you're going to them like,

1:31:30.340 --> 1:31:33.020
 oh goodness, this is going to be rough.

1:31:33.020 --> 1:31:35.260
 Learning to reduce that stress response a little bit

1:31:35.260 --> 1:31:39.060
 so that you are in a position to hear the information better

1:31:39.940 --> 1:31:41.380
 and remember from a previous episode,

1:31:41.380 --> 1:31:42.220
 if you close your eyes,

1:31:42.220 --> 1:31:44.800
 you'll be able to actually focus on the information better.

1:31:44.800 --> 1:31:46.700
 There's your permission to not look someone directly

1:31:46.700 --> 1:31:47.620
 in the eye while they talk to you

1:31:47.620 --> 1:31:49.900
 if you really want to hear what they have to say.

1:31:49.900 --> 1:31:53.340
 You will be able to modulate that stress response

1:31:53.340 --> 1:31:55.060
 and lean into life better.

1:31:55.060 --> 1:31:59.020
 You will be able to react to things in a more effective way

1:31:59.020 --> 1:32:00.980
 and to not be reactive.

1:32:00.980 --> 1:32:04.800
 And this is really one of the important things to me anyway,

1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:07.700
 is that so much of the language around psychology,

1:32:07.700 --> 1:32:09.360
 which I think is a wonderful field,

1:32:09.360 --> 1:32:11.340
 but pop psychology in particular is,

1:32:11.340 --> 1:32:13.180
 be responsive, not reactive.

1:32:13.180 --> 1:32:15.100
 Well, great, but then how does one do that?

1:32:15.100 --> 1:32:16.540
 Well, one does that by modulating

1:32:16.540 --> 1:32:19.120
 their short-term stress response in real time,

1:32:19.120 --> 1:32:21.300
 not by saying, hold on, I need to meditate,

1:32:21.300 --> 1:32:22.540
 hold on, I need a massage,

1:32:22.540 --> 1:32:23.700
 and then I can have this conversation

1:32:23.700 --> 1:32:27.020
 by modulating the reactivity in real time.

1:32:27.020 --> 1:32:30.380
 How does one, for instance, be mindful,

1:32:30.380 --> 1:32:32.980
 which is a beautiful concept, but how are you mindful?

1:32:32.980 --> 1:32:34.900
 Well, I don't know, when I'm moving through my day,

1:32:34.900 --> 1:32:37.360
 a lot of times I'm just trying to get things done.

1:32:37.360 --> 1:32:40.900
 And as soon as I start monitoring and seeing what I'm doing

1:32:40.900 --> 1:32:43.040
 and kind of third-personing what I'm doing,

1:32:43.040 --> 1:32:44.740
 it actually takes me out of the effectiveness

1:32:44.740 --> 1:32:45.820
 and experience of what I'm doing.

1:32:45.820 --> 1:32:47.860
 So for me, sometimes that mindfulness,

1:32:47.860 --> 1:32:49.460
 that observer as they call it,

1:32:49.460 --> 1:32:52.200
 is something that doesn't help me, it actually hinders me.

1:32:52.200 --> 1:32:54.540
 What's important to me is to be able to work and focus

1:32:54.540 --> 1:32:56.540
 and then to be able to disengage,

1:32:56.540 --> 1:32:58.580
 to be able to do a non-sleep deep rest

1:32:58.580 --> 1:32:59.940
 or to be able to still fall asleep,

1:32:59.940 --> 1:33:02.400
 even though I've been working hard until 9.30

1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:03.740
 to put my head down at 10 o'clock

1:33:03.740 --> 1:33:08.040
 and be out cold sleeping by 10.02.

1:33:08.040 --> 1:33:09.580
 That's possible if you can learn

1:33:09.580 --> 1:33:12.020
 to control this stress response.

1:33:12.020 --> 1:33:15.020
 And to do that, we can't use the mind to control the mind,

1:33:15.020 --> 1:33:16.060
 we need tools.

1:33:16.060 --> 1:33:19.600
 And so a lot of the people being grumpy

1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:23.140
 or anxious or depressed, a lot of that,

1:33:23.140 --> 1:33:25.780
 provided it's not for some underlying neurochemical reason

1:33:25.780 --> 1:33:28.420
 that's chronic, a lot of that comes from being

1:33:28.420 --> 1:33:30.860
 poorly rested, from overworked,

1:33:30.860 --> 1:33:33.140
 from feeling like the world is bearing down on us.

1:33:33.140 --> 1:33:36.600
 And so rather than take a subjective view of this,

1:33:36.600 --> 1:33:39.080
 I take the view of objective physiology.

1:33:39.080 --> 1:33:42.520
 What can we do that's anchored to these neuronal systems

1:33:42.520 --> 1:33:44.420
 in our body, in our brain, in our eyes,

1:33:44.420 --> 1:33:47.380
 in our diaphragm, et cetera, and look to those as tools,

1:33:47.380 --> 1:33:49.420
 levers that we can pull on and push

1:33:49.420 --> 1:33:51.200
 and maneuver through life in a way

1:33:51.200 --> 1:33:53.060
 where we start to feel like we have some agency,

1:33:53.060 --> 1:33:54.400
 we actually have some real control

1:33:54.400 --> 1:33:56.980
 because we're controlling the internal landscape.

1:33:56.980 --> 1:33:59.600
 So I think that ought to set the stage

1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:01.800
 for where we're headed next, which is to talk about

1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:03.500
 all the things that you normally think of

1:34:03.500 --> 1:34:05.980
 when you think of emotions, like happiness,

1:34:05.980 --> 1:34:09.020
 like awe, like joy, and we will get into some of that.

1:34:09.020 --> 1:34:13.100
 But all of that rests firmly on the foundation

1:34:13.100 --> 1:34:15.260
 of this thing we call the autonomic nervous system,

1:34:15.260 --> 1:34:19.540
 this stress modulation, this calming modulation system.

1:34:19.540 --> 1:34:22.460
 And again, whether or not you're activated or you're calm

1:34:22.460 --> 1:34:25.820
 is not good or bad, it depends on the situation.

1:34:25.820 --> 1:34:27.100
 Certainly when you want to fall asleep,

1:34:27.100 --> 1:34:28.220
 being activated isn't good.

1:34:28.220 --> 1:34:30.820
 When you have work to do, being activated is great.

1:34:30.820 --> 1:34:34.260
 So I hope today you were able to take

1:34:34.260 --> 1:34:37.780
 a slightly different view of this thing that we call stress,

1:34:37.780 --> 1:34:40.700
 not just see it as evil, but see it as powerful and useful

1:34:40.700 --> 1:34:43.740
 in certain contexts, great for us in certain contexts,

1:34:43.740 --> 1:34:45.860
 and problematic in other contexts,

1:34:45.860 --> 1:34:47.900
 and as well to think about the various tools

1:34:47.900 --> 1:34:51.300
 that I've presented that can allow you to adjust

1:34:51.300 --> 1:34:55.020
 and modulate your internal levels of alertness or calmness

1:34:55.020 --> 1:34:57.420
 so that you can lean more effectively into life,

1:34:57.420 --> 1:35:00.060
 which includes sleep and social connection

1:35:00.060 --> 1:35:01.800
 and the work you have to do.

1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.380
 And of course acknowledges that the events in the world

1:35:05.380 --> 1:35:06.820
 are beyond our control.

1:35:06.820 --> 1:35:08.900
 What's in our control is how we react to them.

1:35:08.900 --> 1:35:11.180
 Something that's commonly said in the wellness

1:35:11.180 --> 1:35:13.760
 and self-help and psychology world,

1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:17.040
 but for which there often aren't as many concrete tools

1:35:17.040 --> 1:35:20.100
 that we can really look to and trust in real time.

1:35:20.100 --> 1:35:23.160
 And of course there are other tools out there as always.

1:35:23.160 --> 1:35:25.780
 I'll say it, I strive to be accurate,

1:35:25.780 --> 1:35:27.420
 but I'll never be exhaustive.

1:35:27.420 --> 1:35:28.820
 I might have exhausted you.

1:35:28.820 --> 1:35:32.300
 I might've cured your insomnia with this discussion today,

1:35:32.300 --> 1:35:33.540
 but in all seriousness,

1:35:33.540 --> 1:35:35.940
 my goal is to bring you tools and information

1:35:35.940 --> 1:35:38.580
 so that you can manage better through life.

1:35:38.580 --> 1:35:40.260
 So thanks so much.

1:35:40.260 --> 1:35:41.820
 I very much want to thank all of you

1:35:41.820 --> 1:35:43.820
 for your support for the podcast.

1:35:43.820 --> 1:35:45.740
 It's really been wonderful.

1:35:45.740 --> 1:35:48.480
 If you've subscribed to the podcast on YouTube,

1:35:48.480 --> 1:35:51.280
 Apple or Spotify, or maybe even all three, terrific.

1:35:51.280 --> 1:35:54.140
 If you haven't, please do subscribe on YouTube,

1:35:54.140 --> 1:35:56.460
 Apple or Spotify, or maybe even all three,

1:35:56.460 --> 1:35:58.020
 which would be wonderful.

1:35:58.020 --> 1:36:00.540
 On Apple, you can leave a five-star review

1:36:00.540 --> 1:36:01.820
 if you think we deserve that,

1:36:01.820 --> 1:36:04.980
 as well as a comment reviewing us.

1:36:04.980 --> 1:36:06.580
 If you have suggestions,

1:36:06.580 --> 1:36:10.140
 if you have questions regarding the content of the podcast

1:36:10.140 --> 1:36:11.820
 or things that you'd like us to cover in the future,

1:36:11.820 --> 1:36:15.540
 please put those in the comment section on YouTube.

1:36:15.540 --> 1:36:19.020
 As well, if you could recommend the podcast to friends,

1:36:19.020 --> 1:36:21.320
 family members, coworkers that you think would benefit

1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:23.640
 from the information, maybe even send them the links

1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:26.700
 if you like, that's tremendously helpful.

1:36:26.700 --> 1:36:28.820
 Today, as in previous episodes,

1:36:28.820 --> 1:36:30.340
 I've touched on some things

1:36:30.340 --> 1:36:32.180
 as they relate to supplementation.

1:36:32.180 --> 1:36:34.040
 As always, I always cover a lot of tools

1:36:34.040 --> 1:36:35.780
 that are zero cost tools

1:36:35.780 --> 1:36:38.180
 that don't involve ingesting anything at all,

1:36:38.180 --> 1:36:39.700
 behavioral tools.

1:36:39.700 --> 1:36:41.340
 But I mentioned some supplements

1:36:41.340 --> 1:36:43.100
 that I particularly find useful.

1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:46.880
 With supplements, it's a complicated landscape often

1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:50.300
 because many supplement companies don't put in the bottle

1:36:50.300 --> 1:36:54.620
 what they say is in the particular product.

1:36:54.620 --> 1:36:58.320
 We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:00.660
 because Thorne is a supplement company

1:37:00.660 --> 1:37:03.140
 that we know to have the highest levels of stringency.

1:37:03.140 --> 1:37:05.020
 It's used by the Mayo Clinic,

1:37:05.020 --> 1:37:07.340
 it's used by all the major sports organizations

1:37:07.340 --> 1:37:08.460
 for that particular reason

1:37:08.460 --> 1:37:11.360
 and because their quality standards are exceptionally high.

1:37:11.360 --> 1:37:13.420
 If you'd like to try any supplements

1:37:13.420 --> 1:37:14.620
 and see the ones that I take,

1:37:14.620 --> 1:37:19.100
 you can go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com

1:37:19.100 --> 1:37:22.700

 as well as any of the supplements that Thorne sells.

1:37:30.220 --> 1:37:34.500
 So that's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com

1:37:34.500 --> 1:37:37.620

 I also do some content on Huberman Lab,

1:37:48.340 --> 1:37:49.580
 a little neuroscience post.

1:37:49.580 --> 1:37:51.520
 Some are reposted clips from the podcast.

1:37:51.520 --> 1:37:53.640
 Others are unique content

1:37:53.640 --> 1:37:55.420
 that you won't find on the podcast.

1:37:55.420 --> 1:37:57.540

1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:10.040
 if they're right for you.

1:38:10.040 --> 1:38:12.100
 I hope you think hard about stress

1:38:12.100 --> 1:38:14.940
 and how you can control your stress.

1:38:14.940 --> 1:38:17.700
 And above all, as always,

1:38:17.700 --> 1:38:19.700
 thank you for your interest in science.
