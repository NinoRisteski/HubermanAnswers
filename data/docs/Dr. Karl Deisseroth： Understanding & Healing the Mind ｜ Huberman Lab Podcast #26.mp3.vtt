00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.220 --> 00:11.740
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:11.740 --> 00:14.920
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.920 --> 00:17.540
 Today, I have the pleasure of introducing the first guest

00:17.540 --> 00:19.380
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

00:19.380 --> 00:22.020
 My guest is Dr. Karl Deisseroth.

00:22.020 --> 00:24.300
 Dr. Karl Deisseroth is a medical doctor.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.880
 He's a psychiatrist and a research scientist

00:26.880 --> 00:28.900
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.700
 In his clinical practice, he sees patients dealing

00:31.700 --> 00:33.540
 with a range of nervous system disorders,

00:33.540 --> 00:37.300
 including obsessive compulsive disorder, autism,

00:37.300 --> 00:41.440
 attention deficit disorders, schizophrenia, mania,

00:41.440 --> 00:44.340
 anxiety disorders, and eating disorders.

00:44.340 --> 00:47.680
 His laboratory develops and explores tools

00:47.680 --> 00:50.280
 with which to understand how the nervous system works

00:50.280 --> 00:51.900
 in the healthy situation,

00:51.900 --> 00:54.120
 as well as in disorders of the mind.

00:54.120 --> 00:57.320
 Dr. Deisseroth's laboratory has pioneered the development

00:57.320 --> 00:59.440
 and use of what are called channelopsins,

00:59.440 --> 01:01.620
 proteins that come from algae,

01:01.620 --> 01:04.300
 which can now be introduced to the nervous systems

01:04.300 --> 01:07.480
 of animals and humans in order to precisely control

01:07.480 --> 01:09.780
 the activity of neurons in the brain and body

01:09.780 --> 01:11.540
 with the use of light.

01:11.540 --> 01:15.000
 This is a absolutely transformative technology,

01:15.000 --> 01:17.060
 because whereas certain drug treatments

01:17.060 --> 01:19.520
 can often relieve certain symptoms of disorders,

01:19.520 --> 01:21.980
 they often carry various side effects.

01:21.980 --> 01:24.580
 And in some individuals, often many individuals,

01:24.580 --> 01:26.900
 these drug treatments simply do not work.

01:26.900 --> 01:29.280
 The channelopsins and their related technologies

01:29.280 --> 01:31.340
 stand to transform the way that we treat

01:31.340 --> 01:34.140
 psychiatric illness and various disorders

01:34.140 --> 01:36.340
 of movement and perception.

01:36.340 --> 01:39.440
 In fact, just recently, the channelopsins were applied

01:39.440 --> 01:42.060
 in a human patient to allow an adult,

01:42.060 --> 01:44.580
 fully blind human being to see light

01:44.580 --> 01:46.060
 for the very first time.

01:46.060 --> 01:49.180
 We also discuss Dr. Deisseroth's newly released book,

01:49.180 --> 01:52.960
 which is entitled, Projections, a Story of Human Emotions.

01:52.960 --> 01:55.600
 This is an absolutely remarkable book

01:55.600 --> 01:59.420
 that uses stories about his interactions with his patients

01:59.420 --> 02:01.420
 to teach you how the brain works

02:01.420 --> 02:03.260
 in the healthy and diseased state,

02:03.260 --> 02:07.020
 and also reveals the motivation for and discovery of

02:07.020 --> 02:09.220
 these channelopsins and other technologies

02:09.220 --> 02:12.260
 by Carl's Laboratory that are being used now

02:12.260 --> 02:14.500
 to treat various disorders of the nervous system,

02:14.500 --> 02:17.300
 and that in the future are certain to transform

02:17.300 --> 02:19.500
 the fields of psychiatry, mental health,

02:19.500 --> 02:20.980
 and health in general.

02:20.980 --> 02:24.000
 I found our conversation to be an absolutely fascinating one

02:24.000 --> 02:27.200
 about how the brain functions in the healthy state

02:27.200 --> 02:30.900
 and why and how it breaks down in disorders of the mind.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.700
 We also discuss the current status and future

02:33.700 --> 02:36.680
 of psychedelic treatments for psychiatric illness,

02:36.680 --> 02:37.760
 as well as for understanding

02:37.760 --> 02:39.780
 how the brain works more generally.

02:39.780 --> 02:42.040
 We also discuss issues of consciousness,

02:42.040 --> 02:45.060
 and we even delve into how somebody like Carl

02:45.060 --> 02:47.820
 who's managing a full-time clinical practice

02:47.820 --> 02:50.300
 and a 40-plus person laboratory

02:50.300 --> 02:53.340
 and a family of five children and is happily married,

02:53.340 --> 02:55.580
 how he organizes his internal landscape,

02:55.580 --> 02:59.540
 his own thinking in order to manage that immense workload

02:59.540 --> 03:02.380
 and to progress forward for the sake of medicine

03:02.380 --> 03:04.360
 and his pursuits in science.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.340
 I found this to be an incredible conversation.

03:06.340 --> 03:07.740
 I learned so much.

03:07.740 --> 03:09.340
 I also learned through the course

03:09.340 --> 03:11.600
 of reading Carl's book, Projections,

03:11.600 --> 03:14.180
 that not only is he an accomplished psychiatrist

03:14.180 --> 03:16.940
 and obviously an accomplished research scientist

03:16.940 --> 03:19.780
 and a family man, but he's also a phenomenal writer.

03:19.780 --> 03:22.300
 Projections is absolutely masterfully written.

03:22.300 --> 03:25.060
 It's just beautiful, and it's accessible to anybody,

03:25.060 --> 03:27.380
 even if you don't have a science background.

03:27.380 --> 03:29.860
 So I hope that you'll enjoy my conversation

03:29.860 --> 03:32.020
 with Carl Deisseroth as much as I did,

03:32.020 --> 03:33.380
 and thank you for tuning in.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.340
 Before we begin, I want to point out

03:35.340 --> 03:36.540
 that this podcast is separate

03:36.540 --> 03:39.100
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.100
 In my desire and effort to bring zero cost

03:41.100 --> 03:42.740
 to consumer information about science

03:42.740 --> 03:45.020
 and science-related tools to the general public,

03:45.020 --> 03:47.960
 I'd like to acknowledge the sponsors of today's podcast.

03:47.960 --> 03:49.940
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

03:49.940 --> 03:52.060
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

03:52.060 --> 03:55.340
 that in my opinion are the very highest quality out there.

03:55.340 --> 03:56.260
 The company was founded

03:56.260 --> 03:58.460
 by two all-American swimmers from Stanford,

03:58.460 --> 04:00.940
 and everything about the eyeglasses and sunglasses

04:00.940 --> 04:03.780
 was developed with performance in mind.

04:03.780 --> 04:06.660
 One of the things I really love about Roca sunglasses

04:06.660 --> 04:09.860
 is that unlike other sunglasses that make it hard to see

04:09.860 --> 04:12.980
 when there's a lot of cloud cover or when the shadows change

04:12.980 --> 04:14.740
 or environmental conditions change,

04:14.740 --> 04:17.820
 with Roca sunglasses, they clearly understand the science

04:17.820 --> 04:18.960
 of the visual system,

04:18.960 --> 04:20.820
 because when I put them on for the first time,

04:20.820 --> 04:23.200
 I noticed that as I moved into shadows

04:23.200 --> 04:24.420
 or the cloud cover changed

04:24.420 --> 04:26.900
 or the day got brighter or dimmer,

04:26.900 --> 04:28.500
 everything was still crystal clear.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.980
 And that's also because the lenses

04:29.980 --> 04:32.540
 are tremendously high optical clarity

04:32.540 --> 04:34.580
 and the glasses are really lightweight.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.580
 You don't even notice that they're on.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.140
 The other thing is that the eyeglasses,

04:38.140 --> 04:40.780
 I wear readers at night, they're incredibly lightweight,

04:40.780 --> 04:42.620
 and for both the sunglasses and eyeglasses,

04:42.620 --> 04:44.420
 the aesthetic is terrific.

04:44.420 --> 04:46.620
 Unlike a lot of performance eyewear,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.780
 which frankly can look kind of cyborg-like

04:48.780 --> 04:49.620
 and kind of ridiculous,

04:49.620 --> 04:51.260
 the aesthetic of the glasses is such

04:51.260 --> 04:53.180
 that you could really wear them anywheres,

04:53.180 --> 04:54.960
 indoors or outdoors.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.660
 If you'd like to try Roca eyeglasses,

04:56.660 --> 04:59.780

05:03.620 --> 05:05.980
 That's Roca, R-O-K-A.com,

05:05.980 --> 05:08.140
 and enter the code Huberman at checkout.

05:08.140 --> 05:11.760
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

05:11.760 --> 05:14.140
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

05:14.140 --> 05:16.860
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

05:16.860 --> 05:18.480
 to help you better understand your body

05:18.480 --> 05:20.300
 and reach your health goals.

05:20.300 --> 05:23.220
 I am a big believer in getting regular blood work done,

05:23.220 --> 05:26.260
 and now with the advent of good genetic DNA tests,

05:26.260 --> 05:29.140
 I'm also a believer in analyzing your DNA.

05:29.140 --> 05:31.620
 The simple reason for this is that many of the factors

05:31.620 --> 05:33.880
 that impact our immediate and long-term health

05:33.880 --> 05:35.980
 can only be measured and evaluated

05:35.980 --> 05:37.540
 with a quality blood test,

05:37.540 --> 05:40.340
 and now the DNA tests further inform our immediate

05:40.340 --> 05:41.780
 and long-term health.

05:41.780 --> 05:43.960
 One of the problems with a lot of DNA tests

05:43.960 --> 05:45.660
 and blood tests out there, however,

05:45.660 --> 05:47.140
 is that you get the information back

05:47.140 --> 05:49.140
 and you don't know what to do with that information.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.340
 With Inside Tracker, you get the numbers back

05:51.340 --> 05:53.980
 of different metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,

05:53.980 --> 05:56.140
 but it also provides simple directives

05:56.140 --> 05:58.080
 as to how perhaps you might want to change

05:58.080 --> 06:00.980
 your nutritional intake or your exercise regimen

06:00.980 --> 06:03.860
 or other lifestyle factors to bring those numbers

06:03.860 --> 06:06.500
 into alignment with where you'd like them to be.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.620
 Inside Tracker also makes this really easy.

06:08.620 --> 06:10.320
 They have a dashboard that makes organizing

06:10.320 --> 06:11.680
 that all very simple,

06:11.680 --> 06:13.940
 and they can even have someone come to your house

06:13.940 --> 06:15.860
 to take the blood and DNA test.

06:15.860 --> 06:17.340
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

 Just use the code Huberman at checkout.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.620
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.

06:28.620 --> 06:30.140
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

06:30.140 --> 06:32.500
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

06:32.500 --> 06:35.500
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,

06:35.500 --> 06:36.480
 and I've taken it ever since,

06:36.480 --> 06:39.020
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.800
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens

06:40.800 --> 06:42.860
 and that I continue to take Athletic Greens

06:42.860 --> 06:45.740
 is that it covers all my vitamin and mineral bases

06:45.740 --> 06:48.260
 and it covers my probiotic needs.

06:48.260 --> 06:50.080
 There's now a wealth of data showing

06:50.080 --> 06:53.000
 that probiotics support a healthy gut microbiome

06:53.000 --> 06:54.700
 and that a healthy gut microbiome

06:54.700 --> 06:57.020
 supports the gut brain access for healthy mood.

06:57.020 --> 06:59.880
 It also supports metabolism, immune function,

06:59.880 --> 07:01.620
 endocrine, that means hormone function,

07:01.620 --> 07:04.860
 and a host of other important biological functions.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.700
 I drink it once or twice a day.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.580
 I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon juice

07:08.580 --> 07:11.060
 or some lime juice, and it's absolutely delicious.

07:11.060 --> 07:12.660
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

07:12.660 --> 07:15.740
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman,

07:15.740 --> 07:18.420
 and if you do that, you can claim a special offer

07:18.420 --> 07:21.680
 where they will give you a year's supply of vitamin D3.

07:21.680 --> 07:24.220
 In addition, they'll give you five free travel packs.

07:24.220 --> 07:26.740
 Vitamin D3, as we all know, is very important

07:26.740 --> 07:29.980
 for a huge range of biological functions and health.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.760
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

07:32.760 --> 07:35.020
 for your Athletic Greens, the five free travel packs,

07:35.020 --> 07:37.380
 and the year's supply of vitamin D3.

07:37.380 --> 07:41.720
 And now my conversation with Dr. Carl Deisseroth.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.060
 Well, thanks for being here.

07:43.060 --> 07:44.440
 Thanks for having me.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.940
 It's been a long time coming for me

07:46.940 --> 07:49.220
 because you may not know this,

07:49.220 --> 07:51.840
 but one of the reasons I started this podcast

07:51.840 --> 07:54.420
 was actually so I could have this conversation.

07:54.420 --> 07:57.420
 It's but one, there are other reasons,

07:57.420 --> 08:02.340
 but one of the goals is to be able to hold conversations

08:02.340 --> 08:05.560
 with colleagues of mine that are doing incredible work

08:05.560 --> 08:06.660
 in the realm of science,

08:06.660 --> 08:09.540
 and then here we also have this really special opportunity

08:09.540 --> 08:12.060
 because you're also a clinician, you see patients

08:12.060 --> 08:13.620
 in and out for a long time.

08:13.620 --> 08:16.040
 So for people that might not be so familiar

08:16.040 --> 08:18.600
 with the fields of neuroscience, et cetera,

08:18.600 --> 08:22.880
 what is the difference between neurology and psychiatry?

08:22.880 --> 08:26.660
 Well, I'm married to a neurologist and I am a psychiatrist

08:26.660 --> 08:28.300
 and we make fun of each other all the time.

08:28.300 --> 08:32.020
 So this is a lot of neuroscientists

08:32.020 --> 08:34.340
 and a lot of brain clinicians actually think

08:34.340 --> 08:36.900
 these two should be the same field

08:36.900 --> 08:38.220
 at some point in the future.

08:38.220 --> 08:40.860
 They were in the past, they started together.

08:40.860 --> 08:44.320
 Psychiatry though focuses on disorders

08:44.320 --> 08:47.660
 where we can't see something that's physically wrong,

08:47.660 --> 08:49.020
 where we don't have a measurable,

08:49.020 --> 08:52.460
 where there's no blood test that makes the diagnosis,

08:52.460 --> 08:55.220
 there's no brain scan that tells us this is schizophrenia,

08:55.220 --> 08:57.480
 this is depression for an individual patient.

08:58.540 --> 09:02.120
 And so psychiatry is much more mysterious

09:02.120 --> 09:05.580
 and the only tools we have are words.

09:05.580 --> 09:08.780
 Neurologists are fantastic physicians,

09:08.780 --> 09:12.140
 they see the stroke on brain scans,

09:12.140 --> 09:15.580
 they see the seizure and the pre-seizure activity

09:15.580 --> 09:20.580
 with an EEG and they can measure and treat

09:20.780 --> 09:22.540
 based on those measurables.

09:22.540 --> 09:24.900
 In psychiatry, we have a harder job, I think.

09:24.900 --> 09:29.100
 We use words, we have rating scales for symptoms,

09:29.100 --> 09:31.900
 we can measure depression and autism with rating scales,

09:31.900 --> 09:34.320
 but those are words still.

09:34.320 --> 09:37.180
 And ultimately that's what psychiatry is built around.

09:37.180 --> 09:42.180
 It's an odd situation because we've got the most complex,

09:42.700 --> 09:47.660
 beautiful, mysterious, incredibly engineered object

09:47.660 --> 09:49.300
 in the universe and yet all we have

09:49.300 --> 09:52.180
 are words to find our way in.

09:52.180 --> 09:56.360
 So do you find that if a patient is very verbal

09:56.360 --> 10:00.080
 or hyperverbal that you have an easier time diagnosing them

10:00.080 --> 10:03.640
 as opposed to somebody who's more quiet and reserved

10:03.640 --> 10:06.900
 or I could imagine the opposite might be true as well?

10:06.900 --> 10:08.580
 Well, because we only have words,

10:08.580 --> 10:10.760
 you've put your finger on a key point.

10:10.760 --> 10:14.040
 If they don't speak that much in principle, it's harder.

10:14.040 --> 10:15.820
 The lack of speech can be a symptom.

10:15.820 --> 10:17.140
 We can see that in depression,

10:17.140 --> 10:19.780
 we can see that in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia,

10:19.780 --> 10:21.280
 we can see that in autism.

10:21.280 --> 10:25.180
 Sometimes by itself, that is a symptom of reduced speech.

10:25.180 --> 10:26.540
 But ultimately you do need something.

10:26.540 --> 10:29.300
 You need some words to help guide you.

10:29.300 --> 10:31.780
 And that, in fact, there's challenges

10:31.780 --> 10:35.480
 that I can tell you about where patients with depression

10:35.480 --> 10:38.100
 who are so depressed they can't speak,

10:38.100 --> 10:41.380
 that makes it a bit of a challenge to distinguish depression

10:41.380 --> 10:43.640
 from some of the other reasons they might not be speaking.

10:43.640 --> 10:46.920
 And this is sort of the art and the science of psychiatry.

10:47.920 --> 10:52.160
 Do you find that there are patients that have,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.460
 well, let's call them comorbidities or conditions

10:54.460 --> 10:58.020
 where they would land in both psychiatry and neurology,

10:58.020 --> 11:01.100
 meaning there's damage to a particular area of the brain

11:01.100 --> 11:02.460
 and therefore they're depressed?

11:02.460 --> 11:06.020
 And how do you tease that out as a psychiatrist?

11:06.020 --> 11:08.140
 Yeah, this happens all the time.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.280
 Parkinson's disease is a great example.

11:12.260 --> 11:15.500
 It can be debilitating in so many ways.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.980
 People have trouble moving, they have trouble walking,

11:17.980 --> 11:19.620
 they have trouble swallowing,

11:19.620 --> 11:24.620
 and they can have truly severe depression.

11:25.140 --> 11:26.540
 And this is, you might say,

11:26.540 --> 11:30.420
 oh, well, they've got a life-threatening illness,

11:30.420 --> 11:32.360
 but there are plenty of neurological disorders

11:32.360 --> 11:37.360
 where depression is not a strongly comorbid symptom,

11:37.620 --> 11:40.020
 like ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, for example.

11:40.020 --> 11:43.980
 Depression is not as strongly comorbid in that disease,

11:43.980 --> 11:46.820
 but in Parkinson's, it is extremely common.

11:46.820 --> 11:49.340
 And as you know, in Parkinson's disease,

11:49.340 --> 11:53.380
 we have loss of the dopamine neurons in the midbrain.

11:53.380 --> 11:58.020
 And this is a very specific population of cells

11:58.020 --> 12:00.400
 that's dying and probably that leads

12:00.400 --> 12:04.020
 to both the movement disorder and the depression.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.160
 There are many examples of that

12:05.160 --> 12:06.820
 where these two fields come together

12:06.820 --> 12:09.220
 and you really need to work as a team.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.320
 I've had patients in my clinic

12:11.320 --> 12:13.660
 that I treat the depression associated

12:13.660 --> 12:16.580
 with their Parkinson's and a neurologist treats the movement

12:16.580 --> 12:19.740
 associated with the Parkinson's and we work together.

12:19.740 --> 12:22.180
 Do you think we will ever have a blood test

12:22.180 --> 12:24.700
 for depression or schizophrenia or autism?

12:24.700 --> 12:27.960
 And would that be a good or a bad thing?

12:29.540 --> 12:33.060
 I think ultimately there will be quantitative tests.

12:33.060 --> 12:36.200
 Already efforts are being made to look at certain rhythms

12:36.200 --> 12:38.780
 in the brain using external EEGs

12:38.780 --> 12:40.880
 to look at brainwaves effectively,

12:40.880 --> 12:43.420
 look at the ratios of certain frequencies

12:43.420 --> 12:45.060
 to other frequencies.

12:45.060 --> 12:47.460
 And there's some progress being made on that front.

12:47.460 --> 12:49.260
 It's not as good as it could be.

12:49.260 --> 12:51.100
 It doesn't really give you the confidence

12:51.100 --> 12:54.200
 for the individual patient that you would like.

12:54.200 --> 12:56.380
 But ultimately what's going on in the brain

12:56.380 --> 12:59.740
 in psychiatric disease is physical

12:59.740 --> 13:02.660
 and it's due to the circuits and the connections

13:02.660 --> 13:05.440
 and the projections in the brain that are not working

13:05.440 --> 13:07.940
 as they would in a typical situation.

13:07.940 --> 13:12.280
 And I do think we'll have those measurables at some point.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.460
 Now, is that good or bad?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.980
 I think that will be good.

13:15.980 --> 13:19.340
 One of the challenges we have with psychiatry

13:19.340 --> 13:21.940
 is it is an art as well as a science

13:21.940 --> 13:26.340
 to elicit these symptoms in a precise way.

13:26.340 --> 13:29.340
 It does take some time and it would be great

13:29.340 --> 13:31.860
 if we could just do a quick measurement.

13:31.860 --> 13:35.220
 Could it be abused or misused?

13:35.220 --> 13:38.380
 Certainly, but that's, I think, true for all of medicine.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.320
 I want to know, and I'm sure there are several,

13:40.320 --> 13:42.660
 but what do you see as the biggest challenge

13:42.660 --> 13:47.420
 facing psychiatry and the treatment of mental illness today?

13:47.420 --> 13:52.300
 I think we have, we're making progress

13:52.300 --> 13:53.940
 on what the biggest challenge is,

13:53.940 --> 13:56.260
 which I think there's still such a strong stigma

13:56.260 --> 14:01.260
 for psychiatric disease that patients often don't come to us

14:01.380 --> 14:05.660
 and they feel that they should be able

14:05.660 --> 14:07.480
 to handle this on their own.

14:08.540 --> 14:10.700
 And that can slow treatment.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.660
 It can lead to worsening symptoms.

14:13.660 --> 14:17.460
 We know, for example, patients who have untreated anxiety

14:17.460 --> 14:20.400
 issues, if you go for a year or more

14:20.400 --> 14:22.660
 with a serious untreated anxiety issue,

14:22.660 --> 14:24.380
 that can convert to depression.

14:24.380 --> 14:28.740
 You can add another problem on top of the anxiety.

14:28.740 --> 14:32.700
 And so it would be, why do people not come for treatment?

14:32.700 --> 14:35.180
 They feel like this is something they should be able

14:35.180 --> 14:38.260
 to master on their own, which can be true,

14:38.260 --> 14:43.180
 but usually some help is a good thing.

14:43.180 --> 14:45.660
 That raises a question related to something

14:45.660 --> 14:48.360
 I heard you say many years ago at a lecture,

14:48.360 --> 14:51.320
 which was that, this was a scientific lecture,

14:51.320 --> 14:54.780
 and you said, we don't know how other people feel.

14:54.780 --> 14:57.940
 Most of the time, we don't even really know how we feel.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.680
 Maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit

14:59.680 --> 15:04.680
 and the dearth of ways that we have to talk about feelings.

15:07.460 --> 15:10.060
 I mean, there are so many words, I don't know how many,

15:10.060 --> 15:11.820
 but I'm guessing there are more than a dozen words

15:11.820 --> 15:14.980
 to describe the state that I call sadness.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.960
 But as far as I understand, we don't have any way

15:16.960 --> 15:20.160
 of comparing that in a real objective sense.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.480
 So how, as a psychiatrist, when your job is to use words

15:23.480 --> 15:26.820
 to diagnose, words of the patient to diagnose,

15:26.820 --> 15:28.620
 do you maneuver around that?

15:28.620 --> 15:33.060
 And what is this landscape that we call feelings or emotions?

15:33.060 --> 15:35.820
 This is really interesting.

15:35.820 --> 15:38.260
 People, here we have, there's a tension

15:38.260 --> 15:41.220
 between the words that we've built up in the clinic

15:41.220 --> 15:43.980
 that mean something to the physicians.

15:43.980 --> 15:46.140
 And then there's the colloquial use of words

15:46.140 --> 15:47.240
 that may not be the same.

15:47.240 --> 15:49.560
 And so that's the first level we have to sort out.

15:49.560 --> 15:53.620
 When someone says, I'm depressed,

15:53.620 --> 15:56.300
 what exactly do they mean by that?

15:56.300 --> 15:58.460
 That may be different from what we're talking about

15:58.460 --> 15:59.460
 in terms of depression.

15:59.460 --> 16:02.860
 So part of psychiatry is to get beyond that word

16:02.860 --> 16:05.340
 and to get into how they're actually feeling,

16:05.340 --> 16:09.580
 get rid of the jargon and get to real world examples

16:09.580 --> 16:10.700
 of how they're feeling.

16:10.700 --> 16:15.700
 So, how much do you look forward into the future?

16:16.620 --> 16:18.960
 How much hope do you have?

16:18.960 --> 16:21.020
 How much planning are you doing for the future?

16:21.020 --> 16:24.220
 So these, here now you're getting into actual things

16:24.220 --> 16:26.420
 you can talk about that are unambiguous.

16:26.420 --> 16:30.140
 Someone says, yeah, I can't even think about tomorrow.

16:30.140 --> 16:33.860
 I'm not, I don't see how I'm gonna get to tomorrow.

16:33.860 --> 16:38.260
 That's a nice, precise thing that, it's sad, it's tragic,

16:38.260 --> 16:41.220
 but it's also, that means something,

16:41.220 --> 16:42.200
 and we know what that means.

16:42.200 --> 16:45.020
 That's the hopelessness symptom of depression.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.860
 And that is what I try to do

16:46.860 --> 16:48.080
 when I do a psychiatric interview.

16:48.080 --> 16:49.780
 I try to get past the jargon

16:49.780 --> 16:51.980
 and get to what's actually happening in a patient's life

16:51.980 --> 16:53.380
 and in their mind.

16:53.380 --> 16:57.780
 But as you say, ultimately, and this shows up across,

16:57.780 --> 17:00.940
 I address this issue every day in my life,

17:00.940 --> 17:04.940
 whether it's in the lab where we're looking at animals,

17:04.940 --> 17:06.780
 whether fish or mice or rats

17:06.780 --> 17:08.660
 and studying their behavior,

17:08.660 --> 17:11.120
 or when I'm in a conversation

17:11.120 --> 17:13.800
 with just a friend or a colleague,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.780
 or when I'm talking to a patient,

17:15.780 --> 17:17.580
 I never really know what's going on

17:17.580 --> 17:19.540
 inside the mind of the other person.

17:20.700 --> 17:24.860
 I get some feedback, I get words, I get behaviors,

17:24.860 --> 17:27.220
 I get actions, but I never really know.

17:27.220 --> 17:29.700
 And as you said at the very beginning of the question,

17:29.700 --> 17:32.460
 often we don't even have the words and the insight

17:32.460 --> 17:34.940
 to even understand what's going on in our own mind.

17:34.940 --> 17:37.860
 I think a lot of psychiatrists are pretty introspective.

17:37.860 --> 17:40.060
 That's part of the reason they end up in that specialty.

17:40.060 --> 17:44.160
 And so maybe we spend a little more time

17:44.160 --> 17:45.500
 than the average person thinking about

17:45.500 --> 17:46.620
 what's going on within,

17:46.620 --> 17:49.440
 but it doesn't mean we have answers.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.600
 So in this area of trying to figure out

17:53.600 --> 17:55.940
 what's going on under the hood through words,

17:55.940 --> 17:58.880
 it sounds like certain words would relate

17:58.880 --> 18:03.020
 to this idea of anticipation and hope.

18:03.020 --> 18:05.140
 Is it fair to say that that somehow relates

18:05.140 --> 18:07.780
 to the dopamine system in the sense that

18:07.780 --> 18:10.460
 dopamine is involved in motivated behaviors?

18:10.460 --> 18:13.140
 I mean, if I say, for instance,

18:13.140 --> 18:17.940
 and I won't ask you to run a session with me here for free.

18:17.940 --> 18:18.820
 We'll do that off camera.

18:18.820 --> 18:19.660
 Okay, right.

18:20.720 --> 18:25.720
 If I were to say, I just can't imagine tomorrow.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.880
 I just can't do it.

18:28.880 --> 18:31.100
 So that's not action-based,

18:31.100 --> 18:34.680
 that's purely based on my internal narrative.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.580
 But I could imagine things like,

18:37.940 --> 18:39.700
 I have a terrible time sleeping,

18:39.700 --> 18:41.180
 I'm not hungry, I'm not eating.

18:41.180 --> 18:43.980
 So statements about physical actions, I'm guessing,

18:43.980 --> 18:46.380
 also have validity.

18:46.380 --> 18:47.220
 Absolutely.

18:47.220 --> 18:50.260
 And there are now ways to measure

18:50.260 --> 18:51.780
 the accuracy of those statements.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.700
 Like for instance, if I gave you permission,

18:53.700 --> 18:55.860
 you could know if I slept last night

18:55.860 --> 18:57.060
 or whether or not I was just saying

18:57.060 --> 18:58.340
 I had a poor night's sleep.

18:58.340 --> 18:59.420
 Yes, that's right.

18:59.420 --> 19:02.700
 So in moving forward through 2021

19:02.700 --> 19:05.700
 and into the next 10 and 100 years of psychiatry,

19:05.700 --> 19:08.820
 do you think that the body reporting

19:08.820 --> 19:12.420
 some of the actions of a human

19:12.420 --> 19:16.580
 are going to become useful and mesh with the words

19:16.580 --> 19:18.980
 in a way that's going to make your job easier?

19:18.980 --> 19:19.940
 I do think that's true.

19:19.940 --> 19:22.560
 And the two things you've mentioned, eating and sleeping,

19:22.560 --> 19:25.300
 those are additional criteria

19:25.300 --> 19:26.860
 that we use to diagnose depression.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.220
 These are the vegetative signs,

19:28.220 --> 19:30.820
 we call them of depression, poor sleep and poor eating.

19:30.820 --> 19:32.420
 And if you have a baseline for somebody,

19:32.420 --> 19:34.020
 that's the real challenge though.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.700
 What's different in that person?

19:35.700 --> 19:37.740
 Some people with depressed, they sleep more.

19:37.740 --> 19:40.500
 Some people who are depressed, they sleep less.

19:40.500 --> 19:41.620
 Some people who are depressed,

19:41.620 --> 19:44.940
 they're more physically agitated and they move around more.

19:44.940 --> 19:46.020
 Some people who are depressed,

19:46.020 --> 19:48.340
 they move less even while they're awake.

19:48.340 --> 19:50.100
 And so you need, here's the challenge

19:50.100 --> 19:53.180
 is you can't just look at how they are now,

19:53.180 --> 19:57.300
 you have to get a baseline and then see how it's changed.

19:57.300 --> 20:02.180
 And that can be a challenge that raises ethical issues.

20:02.180 --> 20:04.700
 How do you collect that baseline information

20:04.700 --> 20:05.540
 from someone healthy?

20:05.540 --> 20:08.560
 I don't think that's something we have solved.

20:08.560 --> 20:11.860
 Of course, with phones and accelerometers and phones,

20:11.860 --> 20:14.780
 you could in principle collect a lot of baseline information

20:14.780 --> 20:18.100
 from people, but that would have to be treated

20:18.100 --> 20:21.540
 very carefully for privacy reasons.

20:21.540 --> 20:24.200
 And in terms of measuring one's own behavior,

20:24.200 --> 20:27.880
 I've heard of work that's going on,

20:27.880 --> 20:30.440
 Sam Golden up at the University of Washington

20:30.440 --> 20:32.080
 who works on aggression and animal models

20:32.080 --> 20:34.600
 was telling me that there's some efforts that he's making

20:34.600 --> 20:36.560
 and perhaps you're involved in this work as well.

20:36.560 --> 20:41.160
 I don't know of devices that would allow people

20:41.160 --> 20:42.580
 to detect for instance,

20:42.580 --> 20:44.760
 when they're veering towards a depressive episode

20:44.760 --> 20:46.640
 for themselves, that they may choose

20:46.640 --> 20:48.800
 or not choose to report that to their clinician.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.200
 Maybe they don't even have a clinician.

20:50.200 --> 20:53.360
 Maybe this person that you referred to at the beginning,

20:53.360 --> 20:54.800
 this person who doesn't feel comfortable

20:54.800 --> 20:55.900
 coming to talk to you,

20:57.740 --> 20:59.480
 maybe something is measuring changes

20:59.480 --> 21:01.080
 in the inflection of their voice

21:01.080 --> 21:03.560
 or the speed at which they get up from a chair.

21:03.560 --> 21:04.920
 Do you think that those kinds of metrics

21:04.920 --> 21:08.000
 will eventually inform somebody, hey, you're in trouble?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.080
 This is getting to this question of,

21:10.080 --> 21:11.840
 back to the statement that I heard you make

21:11.840 --> 21:14.360
 and rung in my mind now, I think for more than a decade,

21:14.360 --> 21:16.960
 which is oftentimes we don't even know how we feel.

21:16.960 --> 21:20.480
 Yeah, that I do like because that gives the patient,

21:20.480 --> 21:23.040
 the agency to detect what's going on.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.160
 And even separate from modern technology,

21:25.160 --> 21:27.360
 this has been part of the art of psychiatry

21:27.360 --> 21:29.000
 is to help patients realize

21:29.000 --> 21:32.020
 that sometimes other people observing them

21:32.020 --> 21:34.960
 can give them the earliest warning signs of depression.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.920
 We see this very often in family.

21:37.920 --> 21:40.480
 They'll notice when the patient is changing

21:40.480 --> 21:42.040
 before the patient does.

21:42.040 --> 21:43.880
 And then there are things the patient may notice,

21:43.880 --> 21:47.480
 but not correctly ascribe to the onset of depression.

21:47.480 --> 21:48.800
 And a classic example of that

21:48.800 --> 21:51.200
 is what we call early morning awakening.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.480
 And this is something that can happen very early

21:53.480 --> 21:55.240
 as people start to slide into depression.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.760
 They start to wake up earlier and earlier,

21:57.760 --> 21:59.760
 just inexplicably, they're awake.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.120
 So this is like 2 a.m., 3 a.m. time waking?

22:02.120 --> 22:04.240
 It could start, yeah, it could start at 5 a.m.,

22:04.240 --> 22:05.440
 could go to four, to three.

22:05.440 --> 22:06.920
 And unable to fall back asleep.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.840
 Unable to fall back asleep, exactly.

22:08.840 --> 22:12.360
 So that's, and that, they may not know what to do with that.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.120
 It could just be, from their perspective,

22:14.120 --> 22:15.840
 it's just something that's happening.

22:15.840 --> 22:18.080
 But if you put enough of that information together,

22:18.080 --> 22:20.760
 that could be a useful warning sign for the patient

22:20.760 --> 22:21.960
 and it could help them seek treatment.

22:21.960 --> 22:24.840
 And I think that is something that could be really valuable.

22:24.840 --> 22:25.900
 Interesting.

22:25.900 --> 22:30.900
 So in this framework of needing words to self-report

22:31.920 --> 22:34.080
 or machines to detect how we feel

22:34.080 --> 22:38.320
 or maybe inform a psychiatrist how a patient feels,

22:38.320 --> 22:42.120
 I want to touch on some of the technologies

22:42.120 --> 22:44.080
 that you've been involved in building.

22:44.080 --> 22:46.960
 But as a way to march into that,

22:46.960 --> 22:51.960
 are there any very good treatments for psychiatric disease?

22:52.160 --> 22:55.640
 Meaning, are there currently any pills, potions,

22:55.640 --> 23:00.080
 forms of communication that reliably work every time

23:00.080 --> 23:01.520
 or work in most patients?

23:01.520 --> 23:02.760
 And could you give a couple of examples

23:02.760 --> 23:05.360
 of great successes of psychiatry if they exist?

23:05.360 --> 23:06.200
 Yes.

23:06.200 --> 23:09.040
 Yeah, we are fortunate, and this, coming back to my,

23:09.040 --> 23:12.800
 you know, the joking between my wife and myself

23:12.800 --> 23:15.280
 in terms of neurology and psychiatry,

23:15.280 --> 23:19.680
 we actually, in psychiatry, despite the depths of our,

23:19.680 --> 23:21.660
 the mystery we struggle with,

23:21.660 --> 23:24.040
 many of our treatments are actually, you know,

23:24.040 --> 23:26.160
 we may be doing better than some other specialties

23:26.160 --> 23:28.040
 in terms of actually causing, you know,

23:28.040 --> 23:30.000
 the therapeutic benefit for patients.

23:30.000 --> 23:34.720
 We do help patients, you know, the patients who suffer from,

23:34.720 --> 23:36.660
 by the way, both medications and talk therapy

23:36.660 --> 23:39.400
 have been shown to be extremely effective in many cases.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.620
 For example, people with panic disorder,

23:42.620 --> 23:45.160
 cognitive behavioral therapy, just working with words,

23:45.160 --> 23:47.280
 helping people identify the early signs

23:47.280 --> 23:49.560
 of when they're starting to move toward a panic attack,

23:49.560 --> 23:52.060
 what are the cognitions that are happening?

23:52.060 --> 23:54.160
 You can train people to derail that,

23:54.160 --> 23:57.480
 and you can very potently treat panic disorder that way.

23:57.480 --> 24:00.400
 How long does something like that take on average?

24:00.400 --> 24:02.360
 For a motivated, insightful patient,

24:02.360 --> 24:06.920
 you can have a very cookbook-y series of sessions,

24:06.920 --> 24:08.740
 you know, six to 12 sessions,

24:08.740 --> 24:12.040
 or even less for someone who's very insightful and motivated

24:12.040 --> 24:15.440
 and can have a very powerful effect that quickly.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.480
 And that's just with words.

24:17.480 --> 24:19.540
 There are many psychiatric medications

24:19.540 --> 24:22.400
 that are very effective for the conditions

24:22.400 --> 24:25.500
 that they're treating, anti-psychotic medications.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.920
 They have side effects, but boy, do they work.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.800
 They really can clear up,

24:29.800 --> 24:33.120
 particularly the positive symptoms of schizophrenia,

24:33.120 --> 24:36.720
 for example, the auditory hallucinations, the paranoia.

24:36.720 --> 24:39.120
 People's lives can be turned around by these.

24:39.120 --> 24:40.780
 We should clarify positive symptoms.

24:40.780 --> 24:43.780
 You mean not positive in the qualitative sense.

24:43.780 --> 24:45.400
 You mean positive meaning that the appearance

24:45.400 --> 24:46.600
 of something abnormal.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.760
 Exactly, yeah, and thank you for that clarification.

24:48.760 --> 24:50.420
 When we say positive symptoms,

24:50.420 --> 24:53.100
 we do mean the addition of something that wasn't there before

24:53.100 --> 24:55.040
 like a hallucination or a paranoia.

24:55.040 --> 24:57.720
 And that stands in contrast to the negative symptoms

24:57.720 --> 24:59.400
 where something is taken away.

24:59.400 --> 25:02.600
 And these are patients who are withdrawn.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.200
 They have what we call thought blocking.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.420
 They can't even progress forward in a sequence of thoughts.

25:08.420 --> 25:11.060
 Both of those can be part of schizophrenia.

25:11.060 --> 25:14.460
 The hallucinations and the paranoia

25:14.460 --> 25:15.900
 are more effectively treated right now,

25:15.900 --> 25:18.180
 but they are effectively treated.

25:18.180 --> 25:21.380
 And then, you know, this is a frustrating

25:21.380 --> 25:23.940
 and yet heartening aspect of psychiatry.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.260
 There are treatments like electroconvulsive therapy,

25:27.260 --> 25:29.220
 which is where, you know,

25:29.220 --> 25:31.100
 it's extremely effective for depression.

25:31.100 --> 25:35.460
 We have patients who nothing else works for them

25:35.460 --> 25:37.360
 or they can't tolerate medications.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.980
 And you can administer

25:39.980 --> 25:42.500
 under a very safe controlled condition

25:42.500 --> 25:44.580
 where the patient's body is not moving.

25:44.580 --> 25:46.940
 They're put into a very safe situation

25:46.940 --> 25:48.580
 where the body doesn't move or seize.

25:48.580 --> 25:52.780
 It's just an internal process that's triggered in the brain.

25:52.780 --> 25:54.820
 This is an extraordinarily effective treatment

25:54.820 --> 25:56.900
 for treatment-resistant depression.

25:56.900 --> 26:00.060
 At the same time, I find it as heartening as it is

26:00.060 --> 26:02.220
 to see patients respond to this

26:03.540 --> 26:04.980
 who have severe depression.

26:04.980 --> 26:06.180
 I'm also frustrated by it.

26:06.180 --> 26:09.700
 Why can't we do something more precise than this

26:09.700 --> 26:11.600
 for these very severe cases?

26:11.600 --> 26:14.940
 And people have sought for decades to understand

26:14.940 --> 26:17.360
 how is it that a seizure is leading

26:17.360 --> 26:19.020
 to the relief of depression

26:19.020 --> 26:20.420
 and we don't know the answer yet.

26:20.420 --> 26:21.540
 We would love to do that.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.420
 People are working hard on that,

26:23.420 --> 26:26.060
 but that is a treatment that does work too.

26:26.060 --> 26:28.020
 In all of these cases, though, in psychiatry,

26:28.020 --> 26:30.660
 the frustrating thing is that we don't have

26:31.740 --> 26:34.780
 the level of understanding that a cardiologist has

26:34.780 --> 26:35.900
 in thinking about the heart.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.180
 You know, the heart is, we now know, it's a pump.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.180
 It's pumping blood.

26:39.180 --> 26:42.660
 And so you can look at everything about how it's working

26:42.660 --> 26:45.460
 or not working in terms of that frame.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.140
 It's clearly a pump.

26:47.140 --> 26:50.180
 We don't really have that level of

26:50.180 --> 26:54.100
 what is the circuit really there for in psychiatry?

26:54.100 --> 26:56.900
 And that's what is missing.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.620
 That's what we need to find

26:58.620 --> 27:02.140
 so we can design truly effective and specific treatments.

27:02.140 --> 27:05.940
 So what are the pieces that are going to be required

27:05.940 --> 27:10.940
 to cure autism, cure Parkinson's, cure schizophrenia?

27:11.920 --> 27:16.240
 I would imagine there are several elements and bins here,

27:16.240 --> 27:18.820
 understanding that the natural biology,

27:18.820 --> 27:21.420
 understanding what the activity patterns are,

27:21.420 --> 27:22.240
 how to modify those.

27:22.240 --> 27:25.220
 Maybe you could just tell us what you think.

27:25.220 --> 27:29.060
 What is the bento box of the perfect cure?

27:29.060 --> 27:31.860
 Yeah, I think the first thing we need is understanding.

27:31.860 --> 27:35.520
 We need, almost every psychiatric treatment

27:35.520 --> 27:37.620
 has been serendipitously identified.

27:37.620 --> 27:41.460
 Just noting by chance that something that was done

27:41.460 --> 27:44.140
 for some person also had a side effect.

27:44.140 --> 27:44.980
 Like lithium or something.

27:44.980 --> 27:46.780
 Like lithium is a good example.

27:46.780 --> 27:49.280
 Is it true that it was the urine of guinea pigs

27:49.280 --> 27:51.700
 given lithium that was given to manic patients

27:51.700 --> 27:52.840
 that made them not manic?

27:52.840 --> 27:53.700
 Is that true?

27:53.700 --> 27:55.420
 I don't have firsthand knowledge of that,

27:55.420 --> 27:57.240
 but I would defer that.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.460
 But it's true for essentially every treatment.

27:59.460 --> 28:02.660
 You know, the antidepressants originally, you know,

28:02.660 --> 28:05.420
 arose as anti-tuberculosis drugs, for example.

28:05.420 --> 28:06.260
 I did not know that.

28:06.260 --> 28:08.680
 And so this is a classic example for,

28:09.940 --> 28:12.760
 and this is across all of psychiatry.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.340
 And of course there's the seizures as well.

28:14.340 --> 28:16.380
 That was noticed that patients who had epilepsy,

28:16.380 --> 28:19.260
 they had a seizure and also had depression

28:19.260 --> 28:21.380
 that they became much, at least for a while,

28:21.380 --> 28:23.580
 they were improved after the seizure.

28:23.580 --> 28:24.420
 That's amazing.

28:24.420 --> 28:26.220
 I don't want to take you off course of the question,

28:26.220 --> 28:27.200
 answering the question I asked,

28:27.200 --> 28:31.260
 but I've heard before that if autistic children get a fever,

28:31.260 --> 28:32.860
 that their symptoms improve.

28:32.860 --> 28:33.860
 Is that true?

28:33.860 --> 28:37.820
 I've done a fair bit of work with autism.

28:37.820 --> 28:40.180
 In my clinical practice, I work with adult autism,

28:40.180 --> 28:42.420
 and I have heard statements like that

28:42.420 --> 28:43.580
 and descriptions like that

28:43.580 --> 28:45.740
 from patients and their families.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.240
 That is very hard to study quantitatively

28:50.240 --> 28:51.380
 because often with the children,

28:51.380 --> 28:55.780
 you have this not as quantitative as you'd like

28:55.780 --> 28:59.720
 a collection of symptom information from home.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.260
 But I have heard that enough

29:01.260 --> 29:04.140
 that I think there may well be something to that.

29:04.140 --> 29:08.940
 And what is, anytime you have a fever, what's going on?

29:08.940 --> 29:11.620
 Well, we know all the cells in the brain,

29:11.620 --> 29:13.540
 and I know this as an electrophysiologist,

29:13.540 --> 29:15.580
 if you just change the temperature by a few degrees,

29:15.580 --> 29:17.540
 everything changes about how neurons work.

29:17.540 --> 29:19.460
 And that's even just a single neuron.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.980
 It's even more likely to be complex

29:21.980 --> 29:23.500
 and different with a circuit of neurons

29:23.500 --> 29:25.080
 that are all affecting each other.

29:25.080 --> 29:26.740
 Just elevate the temperature a little bit,

29:26.740 --> 29:27.620
 everything's different.

29:27.620 --> 29:31.380
 And so it's plausible for sure that things like that

29:31.380 --> 29:32.760
 could happen and do happen.

29:34.580 --> 29:37.660
 And yet, when you think about autism, to take your example,

29:39.120 --> 29:40.740
 yes, we see changes,

29:40.740 --> 29:44.500
 but what is the element in the brain

29:44.500 --> 29:46.580
 that's analogous to the pumping heart?

29:46.580 --> 29:49.620
 When we think about the symptoms of depression,

29:49.620 --> 29:52.500
 that's maybe, we think about motivation

29:52.500 --> 29:53.940
 and dopamine neurons.

29:53.940 --> 29:57.220
 When we think about autism, it's a little more challenging.

29:58.220 --> 30:03.220
 There's a deficit in social interaction

30:03.460 --> 30:04.940
 and in communication.

30:06.180 --> 30:07.260
 And so where is that?

30:07.260 --> 30:09.840
 Where is that situated?

30:09.840 --> 30:14.840
 What is the key principle governing the social interaction?

30:15.580 --> 30:17.740
 This is where we need the basic science

30:17.740 --> 30:19.340
 to bring us a step forward.

30:19.340 --> 30:21.820
 So we can say, okay, this is the process that's going on.

30:21.820 --> 30:25.140
 This is what's needed for the incredibly complex task

30:25.140 --> 30:26.980
 of social interaction,

30:26.980 --> 30:29.540
 where you've got incredibly rich data streams

30:29.540 --> 30:33.100
 of sound and meaning, eye contact, body movement.

30:33.100 --> 30:34.220
 And that's just for one person.

30:34.220 --> 30:36.100
 What if there's a group of people?

30:36.100 --> 30:39.500
 This is overwhelming for people with autism.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.900
 What's the unifying theme there?

30:41.900 --> 30:43.420
 It's a lot of information.

30:43.420 --> 30:48.420
 And that maybe is unmatched in any realm of biology,

30:48.480 --> 30:49.860
 the amount of information coming in

30:49.860 --> 30:52.100
 through a social interaction, particularly with words

30:52.100 --> 30:52.940
 and language.

30:53.800 --> 30:56.980
 And so then that turns our attention as neuroscientists.

30:56.980 --> 31:00.080
 We think, okay, let's think about the parts of the brain

31:00.080 --> 31:05.080
 that are involved in dealing with merging complex data

31:05.860 --> 31:08.300
 streams that are very high in bit rate

31:08.300 --> 31:11.820
 that need to be fused together into a unitary concept.

31:12.700 --> 31:15.140
 And that starts to guide us and maybe we can,

31:15.140 --> 31:17.780
 and we know other animals are social in their own way

31:17.780 --> 31:19.060
 and we can study those animals.

31:19.060 --> 31:21.100
 And so that's how I think about it.

31:21.100 --> 31:22.360
 There's hope for the future,

31:22.360 --> 31:25.620
 thinking about the symptoms as an engineer might,

31:25.620 --> 31:30.140
 and trying to identify the circuits that are likely working

31:30.140 --> 31:32.380
 to make this typical behavior happen.

31:32.380 --> 31:35.100
 And that will help us understand how it becomes atypical.

31:35.100 --> 31:37.500
 So that seems like the first, to me,

31:37.500 --> 31:40.980
 the first bin of this, what I call the bento box,

31:40.980 --> 31:42.980
 for lack of a better analogy,

31:42.980 --> 31:44.660
 that we need to know the circuits.

31:44.660 --> 31:47.940
 We need to know the cells in the various brain regions

31:47.940 --> 31:49.340
 and portions of the body

31:49.340 --> 31:52.260
 and how they connect to one another

31:52.260 --> 31:54.460
 and what the patterns of activity are

31:54.460 --> 31:57.800
 under a normal quote unquote healthy interaction.

31:59.060 --> 32:01.540
 If we understand that,

32:01.540 --> 32:04.220
 then it seems that the next step,

32:04.220 --> 32:06.260
 which of course could be carried out in parallel, right?

32:06.260 --> 32:09.100
 That work can be done alongside work

32:09.100 --> 32:12.420
 where various elements within those circuits

32:12.420 --> 32:14.060
 are tweaked just right.

32:14.060 --> 32:16.140
 Like the tuning of a piano in the subtle way,

32:16.140 --> 32:18.260
 or maybe even like the replacement of a whole set of keys

32:18.260 --> 32:20.620
 if the piano is lacking keys, so to speak.

32:21.460 --> 32:25.120
 You've been very involved in trying to generate those tools.

32:25.120 --> 32:29.620
 So tell us about channelopsins,

32:29.620 --> 32:31.940
 why you created them,

32:31.940 --> 32:35.980
 and where they're at now in the laboratory

32:35.980 --> 32:38.540
 and perhaps also in the clinic.

32:38.540 --> 32:39.900
 Well, this is a, first of all,

32:39.900 --> 32:43.940
 I give nature the credit for creating channelopsins.

32:43.940 --> 32:48.100
 These are beautiful little proteins that are made by algae,

32:48.100 --> 32:50.260
 single-celled green algae.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.140
 And it's a great story in basic science

32:53.140 --> 32:57.460
 that our understanding of animal behavior,

32:57.460 --> 33:00.660
 sensation, cognition, and action in our brains,

33:00.660 --> 33:05.660
 all the way back to a botanist in the 1850s and 1860s

33:06.060 --> 33:08.500
 in Russia is where the story begins.

33:08.500 --> 33:12.300
 So this was a botanist named Andrei Fominzin

33:12.300 --> 33:14.860
 who worked at St. Petersburg.

33:14.860 --> 33:19.860
 And he had noticed in the river near his laboratory

33:19.940 --> 33:23.660
 that there were algae that he could look at

33:23.660 --> 33:25.100
 in a dish, in a saucer.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.520
 He could put them there.

33:26.520 --> 33:29.320
 And when he had light shining from the side,

33:29.320 --> 33:34.320
 the green tinge in the saucer of water would move

33:36.780 --> 33:38.780
 to a particular distance from the light

33:38.780 --> 33:40.380
 that he was shining from the side,

33:40.380 --> 33:42.420
 which was an amazing thing.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.840
 If he made the light brighter,

33:44.840 --> 33:47.060
 the green tinge would back off a little bit

33:47.060 --> 33:48.580
 to a more optimal location.

33:48.580 --> 33:50.380
 So just the right light level.

33:50.380 --> 33:52.980
 So this was plant behavior.

33:52.980 --> 33:54.640
 It was light-driven plant behavior.

33:54.640 --> 33:56.180
 And he delved into this a little bit.

33:56.180 --> 33:58.700
 He identified that with microscopy,

33:58.700 --> 34:01.020
 he could see that there were little single-celled algae

34:01.020 --> 34:05.340
 with flagella that were swimming to the right light level.

34:05.340 --> 34:07.860
 So behaving plants, and this has been the secret

34:07.860 --> 34:10.860
 that's helped us unlock so many principles

34:10.860 --> 34:12.780
 of animal behavior.

34:12.780 --> 34:17.780
 So it turns out these algae achieve this amazing result

34:20.380 --> 34:25.380
 with a single gene that encodes a single protein.

34:25.920 --> 34:26.760
 What's a protein?

34:26.760 --> 34:30.300
 It's just a little biomolecule that does a job in a cell.

34:30.300 --> 34:34.260
 And these are proteins that sit in the surface of cells

34:34.260 --> 34:36.240
 in their surface membrane.

34:36.240 --> 34:39.460
 And when a photon, a light particle, hits them,

34:39.460 --> 34:42.220
 they open a little pore, a little hole in the membrane,

34:42.220 --> 34:45.500
 and charged particles, ions, like sodium,

34:45.500 --> 34:47.320
 rush across the pore.

34:48.200 --> 34:49.620
 Now, why do they do that?

34:49.620 --> 34:51.920
 They do that to guide their flagella.

34:51.920 --> 34:54.380
 That signal coming in, those ions coming in

34:54.380 --> 34:56.640
 through the pore in response to light,

34:56.640 --> 34:59.780
 guide their flagellar motor that guides them

34:59.780 --> 35:02.760
 to a particular spot in the saucer, okay?

35:03.660 --> 35:05.020
 Now that's plant behavior,

35:05.020 --> 35:07.800
 but it turns out, as you know,

35:07.800 --> 35:09.860
 this movement of ions across the membrane,

35:09.860 --> 35:13.180
 this happens to also be neural code in our brains

35:13.180 --> 35:15.100
 for on or off.

35:15.100 --> 35:18.400
 Sodium ions rushing into cells turns them on,

35:18.400 --> 35:20.880
 makes them fire away, fire action potentials,

35:20.880 --> 35:24.460
 communicate to the next cell down the chain.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.980
 And this is an amazing opportunity

35:26.980 --> 35:31.300
 because we can borrow these proteins.

35:31.300 --> 35:32.800
 In fact, we can take the gene

35:32.800 --> 35:35.300
 that directs the creation of the protein,

35:35.300 --> 35:37.540
 and we can use genetic tricks, modern genetic tricks,

35:37.540 --> 35:42.260
 to put that gene into neurons in the brains of mammals,

35:43.100 --> 35:46.540
 and then use light to turn those cells,

35:46.540 --> 35:49.260
 the specific cells that we've put this gene into,

35:49.260 --> 35:50.200
 turn them on.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.940
 There are other opsins, we call them,

35:52.940 --> 35:55.260
 that you can use to turn cells off.

35:55.260 --> 35:57.860
 It's all fast, real time.

35:57.860 --> 36:00.660
 You can play in patterns of activity in real time

36:00.660 --> 36:03.940
 into cells or kinds of cells, just as a conductor.

36:03.940 --> 36:05.740
 It elicits the music from the orchestra,

36:05.740 --> 36:07.660
 the strings and the woodwinds.

36:07.660 --> 36:09.760
 And you can see what matters,

36:09.760 --> 36:12.220
 what matters for sensation, what matters for cognition,

36:12.220 --> 36:15.200
 what matters for action, and we call this optogenetics.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.040
 Beautiful.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.100
 And I must say it was quite an honor and a privilege

36:19.100 --> 36:24.100
 to watch optogenetics move from idea to discovery

36:25.060 --> 36:26.780
 to the laboratory.

36:26.780 --> 36:29.140
 I think we were postdocs at the same time,

36:29.140 --> 36:32.440
 which is living proof that people move at different rates.

36:32.440 --> 36:36.340
 Because that's a joke at my expense, by the way.

36:37.700 --> 36:38.540
 But it's really-

36:38.540 --> 36:39.380
 We end up in the same spot.

36:39.380 --> 36:44.180
 And we're less physically, if not professionally,

36:44.180 --> 36:48.420
 but nonetheless, it's been a marvelous story thus far.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.720
 And I'd like to, maybe you could give us,

36:50.720 --> 36:53.220
 I'd like to just touch on a couple examples

36:53.220 --> 36:56.820
 of where the technology resides in laboratories now.

36:56.820 --> 36:59.220
 So maybe the range of animals that it's being used in

36:59.220 --> 37:03.380
 and some of the phenomenon that channel rhodopsins

37:03.380 --> 37:06.180
 and their related genes and proteins

37:06.180 --> 37:09.800
 are starting to elicit what you've seen.

37:10.820 --> 37:13.420
 And then I'd like to talk about their applicability

37:13.420 --> 37:15.860
 to the clinic, which is, I think,

37:15.860 --> 37:18.020
 the bigger mission, if you will.

37:18.020 --> 37:22.660
 Yeah, so this whole thing,

37:22.660 --> 37:25.780
 it's been about now going on 17 years

37:25.780 --> 37:28.420
 that we've been putting channel rhodopsins into neurons.

37:28.420 --> 37:32.540
 It started, just like Andrei Fominsson's work in a dish,

37:32.540 --> 37:35.820
 by 2000, that was in 2004, in 2007,

37:35.820 --> 37:38.180
 we were putting these into behaving mice

37:38.180 --> 37:41.940
 and we were able to, with a switch,

37:41.940 --> 37:44.660
 cause them to move one direction or another.

37:44.660 --> 37:45.900
 By 2009-

37:45.900 --> 37:48.340
 So basically, you're controlling the mouse's behavior.

37:48.340 --> 37:49.620
 Yeah, exactly, in real time.

37:49.620 --> 37:51.260
 So we could make a mouse that was just sitting there

37:51.260 --> 37:54.620
 doing nothing to then turn left very consistently,

37:54.620 --> 37:55.940
 in fact, go around in a circle

37:55.940 --> 37:58.060
 and as soon as we turn off the light, it would stop.

37:58.060 --> 37:59.740
 That was an eye-opening moment.

38:01.540 --> 38:04.980
 It took really a few years to make optogenetics work.

38:04.980 --> 38:08.060
 There was a lot of putting all the,

38:08.060 --> 38:10.180
 there were a lot of problems that had to be solved.

38:10.180 --> 38:14.140
 These channel rhodopsins actually don't move many ions.

38:14.140 --> 38:17.060
 They have a small current, small conductance, as we say.

38:17.060 --> 38:20.100
 And so we had to figure out ways to pack a lot of them

38:20.100 --> 38:23.420
 into cells without damaging cells

38:23.420 --> 38:25.140
 and still make them targetable.

38:25.140 --> 38:27.100
 So we don't want them to just be in all the cells

38:27.100 --> 38:29.500
 cause then it becomes just like an electrode.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.220
 You're just stimulating all the cells that are nearby.

38:31.220 --> 38:33.620
 We had to keep that specificity,

38:33.620 --> 38:37.500
 make them targetable to just one kind of cell or another

38:37.500 --> 38:39.420
 while still packing in large numbers of them

38:39.420 --> 38:40.940
 into those cells.

38:40.940 --> 38:43.460
 And we had to get in the light in safe and specific ways.

38:43.460 --> 38:46.380
 And so it took probably about four or five years

38:46.380 --> 38:50.580
 to really create optogenetics between 2004 and 2009.

38:50.580 --> 38:51.780
 By the end of that time though,

38:51.780 --> 38:55.900
 we had all the basic light delivery,

38:55.900 --> 38:58.500
 gene delivery principles worked out

38:58.500 --> 39:01.820
 and people started to apply the technology

39:01.820 --> 39:05.540
 to fish, to rats, to mice,

39:05.540 --> 39:09.860
 to non-human primates like monkeys.

39:09.860 --> 39:14.260
 And just a couple months ago,

39:14.260 --> 39:17.020
 my colleague Botond Roska in Switzerland

39:17.020 --> 39:19.860
 succeeded in putting channel rhodopsins

39:19.860 --> 39:21.660
 into the eyes of human beings.

39:21.660 --> 39:23.820
 And making a blind person see.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.780
 And so that's pretty cool.

39:26.900 --> 39:30.660
 This was a patient with retinal degeneration

39:30.660 --> 39:32.900
 and he provided a channel rhodopsin

39:32.900 --> 39:34.860
 into the eye of this patient

39:34.860 --> 39:36.860
 and was able to confer some light sensitivity

39:36.860 --> 39:38.780
 onto this patient that wasn't there before.

39:38.780 --> 39:40.620
 An amazing paper and discovery.

39:40.620 --> 39:42.100
 I realized it was one patient,

39:42.100 --> 39:44.060
 but it's such an important milestone.

39:44.060 --> 39:46.820
 Well, as you say, it's a very important milestone.

39:46.820 --> 39:50.660
 And the history of that is very deep.

39:50.660 --> 39:53.460
 Almost 10 years earlier, Botond, Roska, and I

39:53.460 --> 39:57.060
 had published a paper in science in human retina,

39:57.060 --> 39:59.460
 but explanted, taken from cadavers

39:59.460 --> 40:01.940
 from someone who had died living retina,

40:01.940 --> 40:06.940
 taken out, opsins put into this retinal tissue

40:07.100 --> 40:08.500
 and showing that it worked,

40:08.500 --> 40:09.580
 recording from the cells,

40:09.580 --> 40:11.340
 showing that in these human neurons,

40:11.340 --> 40:14.620
 retinal neurons, that you could get light responses.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.740
 But then from that moment,

40:16.740 --> 40:20.020
 almost 10 years of how clinical development goes,

40:20.020 --> 40:21.580
 and this is a gene therapy,

40:21.580 --> 40:24.020
 so you've got all the regulations

40:24.020 --> 40:25.220
 and concerns and all that.

40:25.220 --> 40:27.780
 It took almost 10 years to get to this point now

40:27.780 --> 40:30.860
 where a living human being has a new functionality

40:30.860 --> 40:32.800
 that wasn't there before.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.700
 Now that's incredibly inspiring,

40:35.540 --> 40:38.300
 and it's a beautiful thing.

40:38.300 --> 40:42.900
 I would say though, that the broader significance

40:42.900 --> 40:45.140
 of optogenetics is really still understanding

40:45.140 --> 40:48.660
 because once you understand how the circuitry works

40:48.660 --> 40:50.460
 and which cells actually matter,

40:50.460 --> 40:53.680
 then any kind of treatment becomes more grounded

40:53.680 --> 40:57.180
 and logical and specific and principled.

40:57.180 --> 40:59.360
 And whether it's a medication or a talk therapy

40:59.360 --> 41:00.780
 or brain stimulation treatment

41:00.780 --> 41:03.460
 with electrical or magnetic means,

41:03.460 --> 41:05.560
 if you actually know what matters,

41:05.560 --> 41:06.760
 that is incredibly powerful.

41:06.760 --> 41:08.680
 And I think, no,

41:10.700 --> 41:14.580
 not intended to disparage the beautiful retinal work

41:14.580 --> 41:17.700
 and conferring vision on someone who couldn't see,

41:17.700 --> 41:19.440
 of course, that's wonderful.

41:19.440 --> 41:22.540
 But, and that's direct, what you might call

41:22.540 --> 41:24.140
 direct optogenetics in patients.

41:24.140 --> 41:27.420
 Indirect is everything that comes from understanding.

41:27.420 --> 41:30.340
 Okay, we know these cells matter now for this symptom.

41:30.340 --> 41:33.020
 Well, how can we target those cells

41:33.020 --> 41:35.580
 and help them work better in patients by any means?

41:35.580 --> 41:37.640
 And I think that's the broader significance

41:37.640 --> 41:39.220
 of optogenetics clinically.

41:39.220 --> 41:40.720
 You and I know Boton well,

41:40.720 --> 41:45.720
 and you and Boton share this incredible big vision

41:45.720 --> 41:50.360
 that I think only a clinician can really understand,

41:50.360 --> 41:54.580
 being in close contact with and the suffering of patients

41:54.580 --> 41:57.640
 as a ultimate motivator of developing technologies,

41:57.640 --> 42:00.340
 which makes me have to ask,

42:00.340 --> 42:02.880
 did you decide to become a scientist

42:02.880 --> 42:06.300
 to find cures for mental disease?

42:08.500 --> 42:09.680
 No, I didn't.

42:09.680 --> 42:11.200
 It's a really important question

42:11.200 --> 42:13.620
 to actually look back and see the steps

42:13.620 --> 42:16.480
 that brought you to a particular place.

42:16.480 --> 42:20.640
 And that was not what brought me initially to science.

42:20.640 --> 42:24.360
 And it's okay to, I think, to embrace the twists and turns

42:24.360 --> 42:27.360
 that life brings to you.

42:27.360 --> 42:29.040
 But I was always interested in the brain.

42:29.040 --> 42:32.600
 And so that was something that for me started

42:32.600 --> 42:34.440
 from a very early age.

42:34.440 --> 42:36.840
 I was, you know, we talked about being introspective.

42:36.840 --> 42:38.800
 I noticed very early on,

42:38.800 --> 42:43.420
 I had a deep love of poetry and stories.

42:43.420 --> 42:48.420
 And I was a voracious reader and I was amazed

42:49.280 --> 42:53.880
 by how words could make me feel in particular ways,

42:53.880 --> 42:57.040
 just even separate from their, you know,

42:57.040 --> 42:58.360
 of course, dictionary meanings,

42:58.360 --> 43:01.160
 the rhythm and how they work together,

43:01.160 --> 43:03.240
 even separate from meaning.

43:03.240 --> 43:06.580
 And I was stunned by poets that could use words

43:06.580 --> 43:09.400
 in new ways that were even divorced

43:09.400 --> 43:10.440
 from their meaning at all,

43:10.440 --> 43:12.440
 and yet could still trigger specific emotions.

43:12.440 --> 43:14.820
 And I was, this was always fascinating to me.

43:15.780 --> 43:19.780
 So, you know, I wanted to understand that.

43:19.780 --> 43:21.120
 And so I was interested,

43:21.120 --> 43:23.280
 and I became interested in the brain.

43:23.280 --> 43:26.720
 And I thought, well, I'm gonna have to study the human brain

43:26.720 --> 43:31.180
 because only human beings can describe

43:31.180 --> 43:33.200
 what's going on inside enough.

43:34.080 --> 43:38.480
 So in college, I began to steer myself toward medicine

43:38.480 --> 43:40.920
 and with the idea of becoming a neurosurgeon.

43:40.920 --> 43:45.920
 And so I came here to medical school

43:47.060 --> 43:48.880
 and did an MD PhD program,

43:50.200 --> 43:52.060
 planning neurosurgery all the way through.

43:52.060 --> 43:55.780
 The first rotation I did at the end of medical school,

43:55.780 --> 43:57.500
 as you know, you do rotations,

43:57.500 --> 43:59.060
 you go through different specialties,

43:59.060 --> 44:01.060
 and some of these are required rotations

44:01.060 --> 44:01.900
 that everybody has to do.

44:01.900 --> 44:04.820
 Some are elective where you can pick what you wanna do.

44:06.180 --> 44:08.180
 I elected to do neurosurgery first,

44:08.180 --> 44:09.780
 even before regular surgery,

44:09.780 --> 44:11.140
 I was not sure I wanted to do it.

44:11.140 --> 44:11.980
 And I loved it.

44:11.980 --> 44:13.380
 I had a fantastic time.

44:13.380 --> 44:17.580
 There was an amazing patient who had a thalamic damage,

44:17.580 --> 44:19.020
 and there was a neglect syndrome

44:19.020 --> 44:22.600
 where the patient was not able to be aware of something

44:22.600 --> 44:24.820
 that was right in front of him.

44:24.820 --> 44:25.980
 Even though their vision was perfectly fine.

44:25.980 --> 44:28.860
 Even though their vision was perfectly fine, exactly.

44:28.860 --> 44:31.460
 And so I was, and I loved the operating room.

44:31.460 --> 44:36.260
 I loved the rhythm of suturing and the precision of it.

44:36.260 --> 44:40.060
 And I loved being able to help patients immediately.

44:40.060 --> 44:44.220
 But then a required rotation was in psychiatry,

44:45.340 --> 44:48.420
 which I was not looking forward to at all.

44:48.420 --> 44:51.560
 And that completely reset my whole life,

44:51.560 --> 44:53.960
 that experience in psychiatry.

44:53.960 --> 44:58.020
 And it was at that moment that I saw this is,

44:58.020 --> 45:00.100
 first of all, the greatest need,

45:00.100 --> 45:04.680
 the depth of suffering and the depth of the mystery together.

45:04.680 --> 45:09.220
 And also it was, I almost feel a little guilty about this.

45:09.220 --> 45:10.880
 It's so interesting too.

45:10.880 --> 45:13.860
 Yes, yes, we can help.

45:13.860 --> 45:14.820
 Yes, there's need.

45:14.820 --> 45:18.300
 But as a scientist, this is amazing

45:18.300 --> 45:22.140
 that someone's reality can be different from my own.

45:22.140 --> 45:25.380
 With everything physically, as far as we can tell,

45:25.380 --> 45:29.060
 the same with the measures we have,

45:29.060 --> 45:30.500
 and yet we've got a different reality.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.140
 That is an amazing thing.

45:32.140 --> 45:35.300
 And if we can understand that and help these people,

45:35.300 --> 45:39.340
 that would be just more than anybody could ask for it.

45:39.340 --> 45:42.460
 And so that's how I ended up taking this path,

45:42.460 --> 45:46.260
 just a required rotation in psychiatry.

45:46.260 --> 45:47.940
 It all started with poetry.

45:47.940 --> 45:49.540
 And it started with poetry.

45:49.540 --> 45:52.020
 Out of respect for poetry,

45:52.020 --> 45:54.900
 are there any favorites that you spend time with

45:55.860 --> 45:57.500
 on a regular basis?

45:57.500 --> 46:01.860
 I mean, the ones who got me down this path

46:01.860 --> 46:04.900
 early on, I remember in childhood in high school,

46:05.940 --> 46:08.400
 Borges had an immense influence on me.

46:09.260 --> 46:14.060
 I studied Spanish all the way through and reading his work.

46:14.060 --> 46:15.580
 He was a great writer.

46:15.580 --> 46:17.780
 He wrote both in English and in Spanish,

46:17.780 --> 46:20.060
 and being able to appreciate his poetry

46:20.060 --> 46:23.140
 both in English and in Spanish was a pretty amazing thing.

46:23.140 --> 46:25.660
 Not many poets can do that.

46:25.660 --> 46:26.500
 You're bilingual.

46:26.500 --> 46:28.580
 I wouldn't say now.

46:28.580 --> 46:32.300
 At one point, I was effectively fluent in Spanish,

46:32.300 --> 46:34.520
 and I'm pretty good with medical Spanish still,

46:34.520 --> 46:38.940
 because we use Spanish all the time in the clinic here.

46:39.820 --> 46:41.460
 I wouldn't claim full fluency,

46:41.460 --> 46:44.260
 but it's something I definitely use all the time.

46:44.260 --> 46:45.900
 That's been very helpful in the clinic.

46:45.900 --> 46:46.980
 Yeah, Borges is wonderful.

46:46.980 --> 46:49.820
 As the son of an Argentine, I grew up hearing about it,

46:49.820 --> 46:53.580
 and I learned that Borges' favorite city was Geneva.

46:53.580 --> 46:56.380
 So I spent time in Geneva only for that reason.

46:56.380 --> 46:58.380
 It also turns out to be an interesting city.

46:58.380 --> 46:59.220
 Yes.

47:00.200 --> 47:04.720
 So you developed methods to control neurons

47:04.720 --> 47:08.740
 with these algae proteins using light.

47:10.260 --> 47:14.340
 In 2015, there was what I thought was a very nice article

47:14.340 --> 47:17.180
 published in the New Yorker describing your work

47:17.180 --> 47:19.900
 and the current state of your work

47:19.900 --> 47:21.900
 in the laboratory in the clinic,

47:21.900 --> 47:24.420
 and an interaction with a patient.

47:24.420 --> 47:28.300
 So this is, as I recall, a woman who was severely depressed.

47:28.300 --> 47:30.340
 And you reported in that article

47:30.340 --> 47:32.460
 some of the discussion with this patient,

47:32.460 --> 47:34.820
 and then in real time,

47:34.820 --> 47:38.220
 increased the activation of the so-called vagus nerve,

47:38.220 --> 47:40.360
 this 10th cranial nerve that extends out of the skull

47:40.360 --> 47:43.280
 and innervates many of the viscera and body.

47:45.520 --> 47:48.840
 What is the potential for channelrhodopsins,

47:48.840 --> 47:52.300
 or related types of algae engineering,

47:52.300 --> 47:56.140
 to be used to manipulate the vagus?

47:56.140 --> 47:57.340
 Because I believe in that instance,

47:57.340 --> 47:58.980
 it wasn't channelopsin stimulation,

47:58.980 --> 48:00.700
 it was electrical stimulation, right?

48:00.700 --> 48:02.240
 Or to manipulate, for instance,

48:02.240 --> 48:04.820
 a very small localized region of the brain.

48:04.820 --> 48:07.380
 Let me frame it a little bit differently

48:07.380 --> 48:08.380
 in light of what we were talking about

48:08.380 --> 48:09.580
 a couple of minutes ago.

48:11.020 --> 48:14.000
 My understanding is that if somebody has severe depression

48:14.000 --> 48:17.300
 and they take any number of the available

48:17.300 --> 48:19.660
 pharmaceutical agents that are out there,

48:19.660 --> 48:22.040
 SSRI, serotoninergic agents,

48:22.040 --> 48:23.980
 increased dopamine, increased whatever,

48:23.980 --> 48:26.360
 that sometimes they experience relief,

48:26.360 --> 48:28.200
 but there are often serious side effects.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.940
 Sometimes they don't experience relief,

48:29.940 --> 48:32.060
 but as I understand it,

48:32.060 --> 48:35.660
 channelopsins and their related technology, in principle,

48:35.660 --> 48:39.620
 would allow you to turn on or off

48:39.620 --> 48:41.580
 the specific regions of the brain

48:41.580 --> 48:43.380
 that lead to the depressive symptoms,

48:43.380 --> 48:45.500
 or maybe you turn up a happiness circuit

48:45.500 --> 48:49.780
 or a positive anticipation circuit.

48:49.780 --> 48:53.400
 Where are we at now in terms of bringing this technology

48:53.400 --> 48:54.980
 to the nervous system?

48:54.980 --> 48:58.920
 And let's start with the body and then move into the skull.

48:58.920 --> 49:01.420
 Yeah, so starting with the body is a good example

49:01.420 --> 49:04.660
 because it highlights the opportunity

49:04.660 --> 49:06.700
 and how far we have to go.

49:06.700 --> 49:09.740
 So let's take this example of vagus nerve stimulation.

49:09.740 --> 49:12.100
 So the vagus nerve, it's the 10th cranial nerve.

49:12.100 --> 49:14.060
 It comes from the brain, it goes down,

49:14.060 --> 49:16.420
 it innervates the heart, innervates the gut.

49:16.420 --> 49:18.860
 And by innervate, I mean it sends little connections down

49:18.860 --> 49:22.100
 to help guide what happens in these organs

49:22.100 --> 49:25.480
 in the abdomen and chest.

49:25.480 --> 49:27.820
 It also collects information back,

49:27.820 --> 49:30.700
 and there's information coming back from all those organs

49:30.700 --> 49:32.660
 that also go through this vagus nerve,

49:32.660 --> 49:35.220
 the 10th cranial nerve, back to the brain.

49:35.220 --> 49:39.500
 And so this is somewhat of a super highway to the brain then

49:39.500 --> 49:40.340
 was the idea.

49:40.340 --> 49:43.180
 And maybe the idea is maybe we could put a little cuff,

49:43.180 --> 49:48.180
 a little electrical device around the vagus nerve itself

49:48.580 --> 49:50.660
 and maybe have just like a pacemaker battery,

49:50.660 --> 49:53.380
 have a little power source here under the clavicle,

49:53.380 --> 49:55.020
 everything under the skin,

49:55.020 --> 49:57.940
 and have a little cuff and drive signals

49:57.940 --> 49:59.380
 and maybe they'll get back to the brain.

49:59.380 --> 50:00.940
 So a way of getting into the brain

50:00.940 --> 50:03.700
 without putting something physical into the brain.

50:03.700 --> 50:04.760
 And why the vagus?

50:04.760 --> 50:06.860
 I mean, it's there and it's accessible.

50:06.860 --> 50:07.780
 That's the reason.

50:07.780 --> 50:08.620
 That's the reason?

50:08.620 --> 50:09.440
 That's the reason, yes.

50:09.440 --> 50:10.280
 Really? Yeah.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.120
 You're not kidding.

50:11.120 --> 50:11.940
 I'm not kidding.

50:11.940 --> 50:13.680
 So stimulating the vagus to treat depression

50:13.680 --> 50:15.420
 simply because it's accessible.

50:15.420 --> 50:19.420
 It started as actually as an epilepsy treatment

50:19.420 --> 50:20.820
 and it can help with epilepsy.

50:20.820 --> 50:22.660
 But yes, it's simply because it's accessible.

50:22.660 --> 50:23.660
 You got to love the medicine.

50:23.660 --> 50:26.900
 As a scientist, this is where I get to chuckle and just say,

50:26.900 --> 50:30.220
 I'm in the field of medicine from that perspective,

50:30.220 --> 50:33.140
 from the perspective of a scientist and outsider,

50:33.140 --> 50:35.360
 the field of medicine as a field that goes in

50:35.360 --> 50:39.820
 and tickles pathways because they're there.

50:39.820 --> 50:42.420
 It's, I don't know what to say.

50:42.420 --> 50:44.620
 It's a little shocking.

50:44.620 --> 50:45.460
 Yeah.

50:45.460 --> 50:50.020
 And we all, at least in my laboratory,

50:50.020 --> 50:53.000
 I always say you never do an experiment because you can.

50:53.000 --> 50:56.020
 You do an experiment to test a specific hypothesis.

50:56.020 --> 50:57.300
 Yeah, yeah.

50:57.300 --> 50:59.600
 I mean, there are stories people tell.

50:59.600 --> 51:04.320
 So the vagus nerve lands on a particular spot on the brain

51:04.320 --> 51:05.920
 called the solitary tract nucleus,

51:05.920 --> 51:09.300
 which is just one synapse away from the serotonin

51:09.300 --> 51:10.700
 and dopamine and the norepinephrine.

51:10.700 --> 51:13.260
 So there's a link to chemical systems in the brain

51:13.260 --> 51:14.740
 that make it a rational choice.

51:14.740 --> 51:16.180
 Yes, it's not irrational,

51:16.180 --> 51:19.340
 but I can tell you that even if that were not true,

51:19.340 --> 51:21.800
 the same thing would have been tried.

51:21.800 --> 51:22.640
 You actually would have done it anyway.

51:22.640 --> 51:23.940
 Because it's accessible, yeah.

51:23.940 --> 51:24.980
 I see, okay.

51:24.980 --> 51:26.940
 And why?

51:26.940 --> 51:31.940
 Well, again, not to disparage what's been happening

51:31.940 --> 51:33.940
 in this branch of medicine.

51:33.940 --> 51:36.180
 There's immense suffering, treatments.

51:36.180 --> 51:39.780
 Many treatments don't work and we try things.

51:39.780 --> 51:42.980
 And this is how so many advances in medicine happen.

51:42.980 --> 51:44.620
 You think about kidney dialysis,

51:44.620 --> 51:46.680
 which has kept many people alive.

51:46.680 --> 51:48.360
 That was just started by someone saying,

51:48.360 --> 51:49.720
 hey, let's try this.

51:49.720 --> 51:51.500
 Maybe there's something building up in the blood.

51:51.500 --> 51:53.420
 Maybe we can dialyze something and help them.

51:53.420 --> 51:54.240
 Yeah, it worked.

51:54.240 --> 51:56.660
 And it was just sort of a test pilot mentality.

51:57.500 --> 51:59.680
 We can access the blood.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.700
 Let's run it across a dialysis membrane,

52:01.700 --> 52:02.660
 put it back in the body.

52:02.660 --> 52:03.940
 Oh my God, that actually works.

52:03.940 --> 52:06.940
 And sometimes you do need that test pilot mentality,

52:06.940 --> 52:10.120
 of course, to do it in a rigorous, safe, controlled way,

52:10.120 --> 52:10.960
 which is what we do.

52:10.960 --> 52:14.500
 And so anyway, that's how we ended up

52:14.500 --> 52:16.620
 but still with the vagus nerve stimulation.

52:16.620 --> 52:18.720
 Okay, so what does it, does it work?

52:19.780 --> 52:22.780
 It has, it's FDA approved for depression,

52:22.780 --> 52:24.080
 this vagus nerve stimulation.

52:24.080 --> 52:25.520
 But on a population level,

52:25.520 --> 52:28.120
 if you average across all people,

52:28.120 --> 52:30.740
 the effect sizes are pretty small.

52:30.740 --> 52:33.660
 Some patients it has an amazing effect in,

52:33.660 --> 52:35.540
 but some patients it doesn't work at all.

52:35.540 --> 52:37.180
 And average across everybody,

52:37.180 --> 52:38.500
 the effect size is pretty small.

52:38.500 --> 52:39.980
 How do you think it's working when it does work?

52:39.980 --> 52:42.420
 Is it triggering the activation of neurons

52:42.420 --> 52:44.440
 that release more serotonin or dopamine?

52:44.440 --> 52:46.100
 It could be, but I would say

52:46.100 --> 52:47.900
 we don't have evidence for that.

52:47.900 --> 52:50.500
 And so I just don't know.

52:50.500 --> 52:53.340
 But what is clear is that it's dose limited

52:54.260 --> 52:56.660
 in how high and strongly we can stimulate.

52:56.660 --> 52:57.500
 And why?

52:57.500 --> 52:58.940
 It's because it's an electrode

52:58.940 --> 53:01.460
 and it's stimulating everything nearby.

53:01.460 --> 53:03.660
 And when you turn on the vagus nerve stimulator,

53:03.660 --> 53:07.220
 the voice, patient's voice becomes strangulated and hoarse.

53:07.220 --> 53:09.060
 They can have trouble swallowing.

53:09.060 --> 53:11.340
 They can have trouble speaking for sure.

53:11.340 --> 53:12.980
 Even some trouble breathing

53:12.980 --> 53:14.300
 because everything in the neck,

53:14.300 --> 53:17.580
 every electrically responsive cell and projection

53:17.580 --> 53:20.060
 in the neck is being affected by this electrode.

53:20.060 --> 53:24.020
 And so you can go up just so far with the intensity

53:24.020 --> 53:25.700
 and then you have to stop.

53:25.700 --> 53:27.980
 So to your initial question,

53:27.980 --> 53:31.040
 could a more precise stimulation method

53:31.040 --> 53:33.420
 like optogenetics help in this setting?

53:33.420 --> 53:34.380
 In principle, it could,

53:34.380 --> 53:38.140
 because if you would target the light sensitivity

53:38.140 --> 53:39.780
 to just the right kind of cell,

53:41.180 --> 53:44.060
 let's say cell X that goes from point A to point B

53:44.060 --> 53:47.400
 that you know causes symptom relief of a particular kind,

53:47.400 --> 53:48.240
 then you're in business.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.500
 You can have that be the only cell that's light sensitive.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.460
 You're not going to affect any of the other cells,

53:53.460 --> 53:54.900
 the larynx and the pharynx

53:54.900 --> 53:57.460
 and the projections passing through.

53:57.460 --> 53:58.300
 So that's the hope.

53:58.300 --> 53:59.120
 That's the opportunity.

53:59.120 --> 54:01.480
 The problem is that we don't yet have

54:01.480 --> 54:02.900
 that level of specific knowledge.

54:02.900 --> 54:04.620
 We don't know, okay,

54:04.620 --> 54:07.420
 it's the cell starting in point A going to point B

54:07.420 --> 54:09.180
 that relieves this particular symptom.

54:09.180 --> 54:11.500
 We want to fix this key on the piano.

54:11.500 --> 54:14.960
 And then I see two other steps that are required.

54:14.960 --> 54:17.540
 One is to get the channelopsin gene into the cell.

54:17.540 --> 54:20.020
 In the case of Boton, Rosco and colleagues

54:20.020 --> 54:21.740
 rescuing vision in this patient,

54:23.380 --> 54:25.540
 they did that by an injection of a virus

54:25.540 --> 54:27.620
 that doesn't damage the neurons.

54:27.620 --> 54:30.300
 The virus itself is fairly innocuous,

54:30.300 --> 54:31.780
 but carries a cargo,

54:31.780 --> 54:33.080
 and it's a one-time injection.

54:33.080 --> 54:34.060
 The cells express,

54:34.060 --> 54:36.300
 and then they used light to stimulate.

54:36.300 --> 54:40.260
 So let's say I'm depressed,

54:40.260 --> 54:41.140
 which I don't think I am,

54:41.140 --> 54:42.940
 although now sitting in front of a psychiatrist,

54:42.940 --> 54:44.900
 you probably can see signs that maybe I am,

54:44.900 --> 54:46.020
 or maybe I'm not.

54:46.020 --> 54:48.580
 But let's say we put channelopsin

54:48.580 --> 54:51.860
 into a specific branch of the vagus

54:51.860 --> 54:56.580
 that we understand is responsible for mood.

54:56.580 --> 54:58.360
 How are we going to get it in there?

54:58.360 --> 55:00.320
 And then how are we going to deliver the light?

55:00.320 --> 55:01.780
 Because we're not talking about sunlight

55:01.780 --> 55:04.260
 or standing in front of a light bulb necessarily,

55:04.260 --> 55:07.020
 but what are the mechanisms for the body?

55:07.020 --> 55:09.580
 Yeah, so we had to solve exactly these questions.

55:09.580 --> 55:10.900
 You're saying, how do you get the light in?

55:10.900 --> 55:14.100
 How do you get the gene in in a potent

55:14.100 --> 55:16.640
 and robust and safe way?

55:16.640 --> 55:19.000
 And that's now solved,

55:19.000 --> 55:20.740
 and that's not a challenge.

55:20.740 --> 55:22.460
 So there are very safe,

55:22.460 --> 55:27.400
 well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms

55:27.400 --> 55:31.140
 that are called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs.

55:31.140 --> 55:34.220
 And these are things that are associated

55:34.220 --> 55:35.740
 with the common cold.

55:35.740 --> 55:39.340
 They themselves don't cause any symptoms.

55:39.340 --> 55:40.380
 They've been engineered,

55:40.380 --> 55:43.420
 and there's been a broad community of viral engineering

55:43.420 --> 55:44.660
 that's been going on for decades,

55:44.660 --> 55:48.300
 making these safer, well-tolerated, and so on.

55:48.300 --> 55:49.920
 We can put the channelrhodopsin gene

55:49.920 --> 55:54.920
 into these viral vectors that deliver the gene,

55:55.060 --> 55:57.560
 and we can have little bits of additional DNA

55:57.560 --> 56:00.000
 that govern expression only in one kind of cell,

56:00.000 --> 56:00.840
 but not another.

56:00.840 --> 56:03.180
 These are called promoters and enhancers,

56:03.180 --> 56:06.060
 all genetic tricks built up by a very broad community

56:06.060 --> 56:08.820
 of great scientists over the decades.

56:08.820 --> 56:10.740
 We can put these different bits of DNA,

56:10.740 --> 56:13.820
 package them into this AAV, this little virus,

56:13.820 --> 56:16.580
 and that can be then injected

56:16.580 --> 56:20.380
 into a particular part of the body.

56:20.380 --> 56:23.220
 And sticking with this vagus nerve example,

56:23.220 --> 56:25.620
 we know that there are particular clumps of neurons.

56:25.620 --> 56:27.880
 There's one called the nodos ganglion

56:27.880 --> 56:32.060
 that has a clump of cells related to the vagus nerve,

56:32.060 --> 56:33.260
 and you could, for example,

56:33.260 --> 56:35.980
 target a little injection into that ganglion.

56:35.980 --> 56:37.620
 Would that be an outpatient procedure?

56:37.620 --> 56:39.380
 Yeah, yeah, so you come in in the morning,

56:39.380 --> 56:41.700
 get your injection, maybe walk out a few hours later.

56:41.700 --> 56:44.200
 Yeah, that's right, and so that's the gene.

56:45.260 --> 56:46.380
 Then the light delivery,

56:46.380 --> 56:48.660
 this is also something that we've worked out.

56:48.660 --> 56:52.540
 We've worked on making very, very light-sensitive opsins.

56:52.540 --> 56:57.500
 One challenge, and Botand would be the first to state this,

56:57.500 --> 57:00.100
 in fact, in solving this problem for the patient,

57:00.100 --> 57:05.100
 he had to build goggles that created much brighter light

57:05.100 --> 57:08.740
 than the normal ambient light delivery,

57:08.740 --> 57:10.620
 because as I mentioned earlier,

57:10.620 --> 57:13.920
 you have to pack a lot of these channelrhodopsins in.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.620
 They don't have much current.

57:15.620 --> 57:17.220
 You have to really make sure

57:17.220 --> 57:19.520
 that you've got a tense enough light

57:19.520 --> 57:21.740
 to activate enough of them to cause a stimulation.

57:21.740 --> 57:23.100
 And it has to be the right wavelength, correct?

57:23.100 --> 57:23.940
 It has to be the right wavelength.

57:23.940 --> 57:24.820
 And going back to your example

57:24.820 --> 57:28.460
 of the algae moving toward or away the light,

57:28.460 --> 57:30.180
 it has to be tuned just right.

57:30.180 --> 57:34.420
 So could you, I'm imagining in my mind as a non-engineer,

57:34.420 --> 57:36.820
 I know you're also a bioengineer,

57:38.060 --> 57:42.660
 I'm imagining a little tiny blue light-emitting thing,

57:43.780 --> 57:47.220
 object that's a little bigger than a clump of cells,

57:47.220 --> 57:49.340
 or maybe about the size of a clump of cells.

57:49.340 --> 57:50.840
 And for those who don't know,

57:51.780 --> 57:56.580
 your credit card is about 200 microns thick on the side,

57:56.580 --> 57:58.740
 and a micron is a thousandths of a millimeter.

57:58.740 --> 58:02.140
 And so we're talking about a little tiny stamp

58:02.140 --> 58:07.140
 that's basically half a millimeter in size all around.

58:10.260 --> 58:12.400
 Each edge, half a millimeter in size.

58:12.400 --> 58:14.740
 I can imagine that being put under my skin.

58:14.740 --> 58:17.540
 And then I would, what, I'd hit an app on my phone,

58:17.540 --> 58:22.220
 and I'd say, Dr. Deisseroth, I'm not feeling great today.

58:22.220 --> 58:23.660
 Can I increase the stimulation?

58:23.660 --> 58:24.760
 And you say, go for it.

58:24.760 --> 58:25.680
 And then I ramp it up.

58:25.680 --> 58:26.520
 Is that how it would go?

58:26.520 --> 58:28.220
 I mean, that's effectively what we already do

58:28.220 --> 58:31.040
 with the vagus nerve stimulation, the doctor in this case.

58:31.040 --> 58:33.260
 And I have this in some of my patients in the clinic.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.500
 I do vagus nerve stimulation.

58:34.500 --> 58:35.320
 I talk to them.

58:35.320 --> 58:37.380
 I say, hi, I go through the symptoms.

58:37.380 --> 58:39.100
 I use the psychiatric interview

58:39.100 --> 58:41.180
 to elicit their internal states.

58:41.180 --> 58:44.060
 And then I have a radio frequency controller

58:44.060 --> 58:45.620
 that I can dial in.

58:45.620 --> 58:46.460
 Right there in real time.

58:46.460 --> 58:47.280
 Right there in real time.

58:47.280 --> 58:48.460
 You're holding the remote control

58:48.460 --> 58:49.740
 essentially to their brain,

58:49.740 --> 58:51.420
 although it's remote, remote control.

58:51.420 --> 58:53.460
 Through a couple of steps, but yeah.

58:53.460 --> 58:56.420
 And I can turn up the frequency.

58:56.420 --> 59:00.220
 I can turn up the intensity, all with the radio frequency.

59:00.220 --> 59:05.220
 And control, and then it's reprogrammed or re-dosed.

59:05.680 --> 59:09.000
 And then the patient can then leave at this altered dose.

59:09.000 --> 59:10.100
 So this is happening now?

59:10.100 --> 59:11.260
 This is happening right now, electrically.

59:11.260 --> 59:12.220
 You do this routinely?

59:12.220 --> 59:14.060
 I do it routinely in my clinic, electrically.

59:14.060 --> 59:17.140
 And you're getting the verbal content,

59:17.140 --> 59:19.520
 which as you described earlier,

59:19.520 --> 59:21.500
 is the indication of how well

59:21.500 --> 59:23.380
 something is working in real time.

59:23.380 --> 59:25.300
 So maybe you could just describe a little bit

59:25.300 --> 59:27.220
 of the interaction with that particular patient

59:27.220 --> 59:28.300
 or another patient.

59:28.300 --> 59:32.460
 What's a typical arc of narrative

59:32.460 --> 59:36.180
 as you go from no stimulation to increased stimulation?

59:36.180 --> 59:39.540
 In most patients, the actual therapeutic effects,

59:39.540 --> 59:42.980
 the benefits actually take many days to weeks.

59:42.980 --> 59:46.620
 And so what I'm mostly focusing on in the office

59:46.620 --> 59:48.420
 in real time is making sure

59:48.420 --> 59:51.460
 I'm in a safe, low side effect regime.

59:51.460 --> 59:53.420
 And so first I talked to the patient, you know,

59:53.420 --> 59:56.220
 who has been on a particular dose of the stimulation

59:56.220 --> 59:58.700
 for weeks or longer.

59:58.700 --> 1:00:00.500
 And I talked about symptoms.

1:00:00.500 --> 1:00:02.720
 How were things over the past month?

1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:03.560
 How was your hope?

1:00:03.560 --> 1:00:05.000
 How was your energy level?

1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:05.840
 Sleep?

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:07.860
 You know, what is your mood?

1:00:07.860 --> 1:00:10.060
 And then we talk with the patient and we decide,

1:00:10.060 --> 1:00:12.260
 oh, this is not yet where we'd like to be.

1:00:12.260 --> 1:00:15.740
 And so then I can turn up the intensity of the stimulation

1:00:15.740 --> 1:00:16.740
 in real time in the office.

1:00:16.740 --> 1:00:18.080
 I don't, in most patients,

1:00:18.080 --> 1:00:21.100
 I don't expect an immediate mood change.

1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:23.180
 What I do is I increase the dose

1:00:23.180 --> 1:00:27.340
 until a next level up while asking the patient

1:00:27.340 --> 1:00:28.180
 for side effects.

1:00:28.180 --> 1:00:29.460
 Can you still breathe okay?

1:00:29.460 --> 1:00:30.820
 Can you still swallow okay?

1:00:30.820 --> 1:00:32.220
 And I can hear their voice as well.

1:00:32.220 --> 1:00:33.060
 And I can get a sense.

1:00:33.060 --> 1:00:33.900
 And you're looking at their face.

1:00:33.900 --> 1:00:34.980
 And I'm looking at their face.

1:00:34.980 --> 1:00:37.500
 And so I can get a sense, is there a,

1:00:37.500 --> 1:00:40.420
 am I still in a safe side effect regime?

1:00:40.420 --> 1:00:44.860
 And then, you know, I stop at a particular point

1:00:44.860 --> 1:00:48.100
 that looks safe and then patient goes home,

1:00:48.100 --> 1:00:49.500
 comes back a month later,

1:00:49.500 --> 1:00:53.200
 and I get the report on how things were over that month.

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:54.940
 I asked if you're looking at their face,

1:00:54.940 --> 1:00:56.040
 because in your book,

1:00:57.060 --> 1:01:00.040
 you described the incredible complexity

1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:01.860
 of social interactions.

1:01:01.860 --> 1:01:04.340
 And at one point,

1:01:04.340 --> 1:01:09.100
 you described the incredible amount of information

1:01:09.100 --> 1:01:12.500
 that the eyes inform about the brain

1:01:12.500 --> 1:01:14.900
 and the context of somebody's inner experience,

1:01:14.900 --> 1:01:17.200
 whether depressed or happy or otherwise.

1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:21.880
 I want to make sure that we get back to how to maneuver them

1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:24.420
 and manipulate the nervous system for sake of mental health.

1:01:24.420 --> 1:01:28.820
 But what are you looking for?

1:01:28.820 --> 1:01:31.080
 So as a vision scientist, I think, you know,

1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:33.140
 pupils dilating is a sign of arousal,

1:01:33.140 --> 1:01:34.800
 but that could be a positive arousal,

1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:38.300
 positive valence, like excitement, or it could be terror.

1:01:38.300 --> 1:01:40.940
 You're going to get the same dilation of the pupils.

1:01:42.540 --> 1:01:43.940
 And I'm always reminding people

1:01:43.940 --> 1:01:45.900
 that these two little goodies are two pieces of brain,

1:01:45.900 --> 1:01:47.940
 basically, they're just outside the cranial vault.

1:01:47.940 --> 1:01:49.780
 So they're not unlike the vagus in that sense,

1:01:49.780 --> 1:01:52.300
 but they're more of a report than a control knob,

1:01:52.300 --> 1:01:54.420
 although I like to think they could be

1:01:54.420 --> 1:01:55.820
 used as control knobs too.

1:01:57.060 --> 1:02:01.380
 So without putting you on the spot, again, to diagnose me,

1:02:01.380 --> 1:02:03.300
 something I would never ask you to do

1:02:03.300 --> 1:02:04.540
 with the cameras rolling,

1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:06.940
 but what are you looking for

1:02:06.940 --> 1:02:09.160
 that the patient might not be aware of?

1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:12.560
 In other words, can you see depression in somebody's eyes?

1:02:12.560 --> 1:02:15.220
 And if you know a patient or if you don't,

1:02:15.220 --> 1:02:19.140
 can you see it in their body posture when they walk in?

1:02:19.980 --> 1:02:22.380
 Realizing, of course, that a trained psychiatrist

1:02:22.380 --> 1:02:25.260
 like yourself develops an intuitive sense

1:02:25.260 --> 1:02:29.020
 that's aggregating lots of different features of a patient.

1:02:29.020 --> 1:02:30.220
 But what about the eyes?

1:02:30.220 --> 1:02:32.060
 What's going on there?

1:02:32.060 --> 1:02:34.580
 The eyes are incredibly rich in information.

1:02:34.580 --> 1:02:37.540
 And as you allude to though,

1:02:37.540 --> 1:02:40.900
 it's not as if any one measurable

1:02:40.900 --> 1:02:42.420
 conveys all the information you need.

1:02:42.420 --> 1:02:45.140
 It's what we, you know, what an engineer would say,

1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:49.020
 joint statistics, it's many things all at once,

1:02:49.020 --> 1:02:52.060
 whether they're in synchrony or out of synchrony

1:02:52.060 --> 1:02:54.700
 that actually turns out to matter.

1:02:54.700 --> 1:02:57.980
 And, you know, the eye contact question,

1:02:57.980 --> 1:03:00.140
 we all know eye contact is incredibly important.

1:03:00.140 --> 1:03:02.620
 You don't feel you've connected with somebody

1:03:02.620 --> 1:03:04.420
 unless there's eye contact,

1:03:04.420 --> 1:03:06.260
 but eye contact can go awry too.

1:03:06.260 --> 1:03:11.260
 It can be too intense or it can be mistimed

1:03:11.260 --> 1:03:15.560
 or if there's someone with autism,

1:03:15.560 --> 1:03:17.280
 it can be barely there at all.

1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:21.240
 And this is one of the most striking symptoms of autism

1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:23.960
 is the avoidance of eye contact

1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:31.640
 almost as if it's a harmful quantity.

1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:35.160
 And so there's an immense amount of information

1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:36.440
 you get from the eyes,

1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:40.360
 but it's the pairing of what's going on in the eyes

1:03:40.360 --> 1:03:43.160
 with everything else going on, the body language,

1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:46.900
 the verbal content of what's coming out.

1:03:46.900 --> 1:03:51.040
 All that together is the art of psychiatry

1:03:51.040 --> 1:03:53.160
 and social interaction.

1:03:53.160 --> 1:03:55.160
 But, you know, sometimes you don't have the eye contact

1:03:55.160 --> 1:03:56.280
 and this is an amazing thing.

1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:58.140
 And I do talk about this in the book as well.

1:03:58.140 --> 1:04:00.520
 In many cases, you know, in psychiatry,

1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:01.640
 sometimes it's over the phone

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:04.120
 that you have to make key decisions.

1:04:04.120 --> 1:04:09.120
 And as I recall, you know, vividly being as a resident,

1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:12.720
 very often you have to take these phone calls

1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.080
 from people who are not in the hospital,

1:04:17.080 --> 1:04:19.600
 people you can't see, can't see their eye,

1:04:19.600 --> 1:04:21.640
 can't see their body, anything about them,

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:23.180
 just the sound of their voice.

1:04:23.180 --> 1:04:24.720
 And you can ask them questions

1:04:24.720 --> 1:04:28.320
 and you have to make, in some cases, life or death decisions.

1:04:28.320 --> 1:04:31.720
 You know, is this person truly suicidal,

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:35.120
 something like that, as it comes up all the time.

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:39.280
 And so I developed over the course of training,

1:04:39.280 --> 1:04:41.840
 and I think all psychiatrists do this,

1:04:41.840 --> 1:04:44.980
 is you develop a way to, whatever data stream you have,

1:04:44.980 --> 1:04:47.480
 whether it's the eyes or whether it's just the sound

1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:49.520
 of a voice coming over the phone,

1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:51.720
 you learn to hone in on that data stream you have

1:04:51.720 --> 1:04:55.320
 and focus on it and identify changes.

1:04:55.320 --> 1:04:58.560
 And it's quite amazing.

1:04:58.560 --> 1:05:03.360
 I found that you can actually, if you know a patient,

1:05:03.360 --> 1:05:05.720
 you can detect very precise changes in mood

1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:07.180
 just from the sound of the voice.

1:05:07.180 --> 1:05:11.160
 And you can have a realization that,

1:05:11.160 --> 1:05:15.840
 oh, this patient's depression has improved by about half,

1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:18.600
 just by the tone of their voice.

1:05:18.600 --> 1:05:21.400
 And same with eyes, with enough practice,

1:05:21.400 --> 1:05:24.760
 you can get enough information from a single data stream

1:05:24.760 --> 1:05:26.360
 to give you some information.

1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:27.940
 But when you do have the whole picture,

1:05:27.940 --> 1:05:29.840
 that of course is best.

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:34.840
 So many theories out there about excessive blinking

1:05:34.980 --> 1:05:38.100
 and lying, lack of blinking in sociopathy.

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:42.400
 I like to remind people that people have varying degrees

1:05:42.400 --> 1:05:43.620
 of lubrication of the eyes,

1:05:43.620 --> 1:05:45.740
 which also influence the frequency of blinking

1:05:45.740 --> 1:05:48.880
 and presumably have nothing to do with whether or not

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:50.600
 what they're saying is true or not.

1:05:50.600 --> 1:05:52.320
 But incredible nonetheless,

1:05:52.320 --> 1:05:56.520
 that the eyes are a portal to overall arousal state.

1:05:56.520 --> 1:05:59.040
 I'm fascinated by the effects of light on circadian biology

1:05:59.040 --> 1:06:02.600
 just overall desire to be awake or asleep, et cetera.

1:06:04.160 --> 1:06:06.440
 So the eyes are on the outside of the cranial vault.

1:06:06.440 --> 1:06:10.820
 The vagus is outside the cranial vault, obviously.

1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:14.520
 What about the goodies in here?

1:06:15.620 --> 1:06:19.040
 Parkinson's, we know at least one of the major sites

1:06:19.040 --> 1:06:22.320
 of degeneration and failure that lead to those symptoms.

1:06:24.140 --> 1:06:25.860
 I can name off any number of other things.

1:06:25.860 --> 1:06:27.560
 In your book, you talk about the beautiful work

1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:30.520
 done with optogenetics of active versus passive coping,

1:06:30.520 --> 1:06:32.360
 that there are areas of the brain like the habenula

1:06:32.360 --> 1:06:36.400
 that make, when active, make animals and presumably people

1:06:36.400 --> 1:06:39.680
 passive and unwilling or uninterested

1:06:39.680 --> 1:06:42.160
 in fighting back against pressures of life.

1:06:42.160 --> 1:06:46.120
 Whereas another region, the raphe, you stimulate that

1:06:46.120 --> 1:06:47.640
 and they actively cope.

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:49.520
 They get their grit going

1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:51.860
 and they are able to lean into life.

1:06:51.860 --> 1:06:56.860
 So how does one get to those structures in a focused way?

1:06:57.520 --> 1:07:02.520
 And what does the next two to five to 10 years look like?

1:07:03.480 --> 1:07:05.400
 Well, this is the promise on that,

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:07.360
 and it is on that timescale

1:07:08.220 --> 1:07:10.800
 that I think things may start to play out.

1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:14.880
 You know, the specificity of optogenetics

1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:18.240
 is really only useful if you have some idea

1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:20.480
 of how to use that specificity.

1:07:20.480 --> 1:07:23.860
 And it's an actually, it's a frustrating aspect

1:07:23.860 --> 1:07:26.320
 of psychiatry that in many cases,

1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:28.920
 the most effective treatments we have

1:07:28.920 --> 1:07:30.920
 have the least specificity.

1:07:30.920 --> 1:07:33.280
 Electroconvulsive therapy being a great example

1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:34.880
 where you're causing a brain-wide-

1:07:34.880 --> 1:07:37.680
 Which looks barbaric, but as you mentioned, is effective.

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:39.000
 I mean, it is.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.680
 These days, it's much more clinically, you know-

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:42.840
 It doesn't look like one flu,

1:07:42.840 --> 1:07:45.260
 the last seen in one flu over the cuckoo's nest.

1:07:45.260 --> 1:07:47.980
 Now it's a very clinically safe and stable procedure.

1:07:47.980 --> 1:07:51.400
 But where I would say, yeah,

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:56.240
 it's got this almost medieval lack of specificity,

1:07:56.240 --> 1:07:58.120
 even if the procedure is well-controlled

1:07:58.120 --> 1:07:59.720
 and clinically safe and stable,

1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:02.720
 and it's not very specific.

1:08:02.720 --> 1:08:04.240
 You're causing a brain-wide seizure.

1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:06.200
 How could you be less specific than that?

1:08:06.200 --> 1:08:09.000
 And we don't know the source of the relief.

1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:09.840
 We don't know-

1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:11.320
 Presumably it's a dump of neuromodulators

1:08:11.320 --> 1:08:13.080
 like dopamine and serotonin, but we don't-

1:08:13.080 --> 1:08:14.880
 There certainly is a dump of neuromodulators.

1:08:14.880 --> 1:08:18.180
 We don't know that that's the cause for the relief.

1:08:18.180 --> 1:08:20.180
 And likewise with medications,

1:08:20.180 --> 1:08:22.060
 this is also an interesting thing.

1:08:23.480 --> 1:08:26.120
 Some of the most effective antidepressants,

1:08:26.120 --> 1:08:28.200
 some of the most effective antipsychotics

1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:30.700
 are the ones that have the most side effects.

1:08:30.700 --> 1:08:33.000
 And many examples of this, for example,

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.160
 the most effective antipsychotic

1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:37.000
 is something called clozapine,

1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.680
 which has, it's unquestionably has the most side effects.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:40.960
 It had terrible, terrible side effects.

1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:42.320
 It's a D4 antagonist?

1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:44.840
 It has basically every receptor.

1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:45.680
 Does it really?

1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:46.520
 Yeah, it acts- Interesting.

1:08:46.520 --> 1:08:51.000
 Yeah, it has prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic,

1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:52.840
 certainly acts on dopamine receptors,

1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:57.840
 but it causes blood cell counts to change.

1:08:58.160 --> 1:08:59.360
 How do people feel?

1:08:59.360 --> 1:09:02.040
 So if I were schizophrenic

1:09:02.040 --> 1:09:05.200
 and I was getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera,

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:10.200
 and I took clozapine, what could I expect to feel?

1:09:10.840 --> 1:09:13.520
 Well, so you would notice side effects

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:16.200
 and you would notice resolution of symptoms both.

1:09:16.200 --> 1:09:17.040
 And-

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:20.160
 So the voices would go away in a good situation,

1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:21.360
 the voices would go away,

1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:23.680
 but I would feel not good in my body?

1:09:23.680 --> 1:09:26.240
 You would have, you might have dizziness,

1:09:26.240 --> 1:09:28.840
 you might have drooling,

1:09:28.840 --> 1:09:33.200
 you might have any number of physical sensations

1:09:35.720 --> 1:09:38.160
 that would be due to these off-target effects,

1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:40.480
 the medication acting on these other receptors.

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:41.760
 And I'm certainly not suggesting this,

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:45.280
 but what if somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:47.320
 They had the same side effects, presumably, yeah.

1:09:47.320 --> 1:09:50.920
 And so it would not be something that I would recommend.

1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:53.560
 Do psychiatrists take the drugs that they prescribe?

1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:55.720
 I just finished for the third time

1:09:55.720 --> 1:09:59.280
 Oliver Sacks' autobiography, which is marvelous

1:09:59.280 --> 1:10:02.080
 and I highly recommend to people.

1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:03.820
 He certainly took a lot of drugs,

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.120
 not as part of his professional role,

1:10:08.020 --> 1:10:10.040
 but just out of curiosity,

1:10:10.040 --> 1:10:13.720
 what is the interest or kind of role of drugs

1:10:13.720 --> 1:10:14.960
 in the field of psychiatry?

1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:16.560
 Because I would imagine for a group

1:10:16.560 --> 1:10:19.160
 of very curious, introspective people

1:10:19.160 --> 1:10:21.600
 who are making recommendations about what to take,

1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:23.440
 there could actually be some benefit

1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:25.960
 for understanding what the experience of those drugs

1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:27.320
 was like for their patients.

1:10:27.320 --> 1:10:28.800
 I think that's true.

1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:32.200
 And I will say that probably many or most psychiatrists

1:10:32.200 --> 1:10:35.360
 have sampled a number of these

1:10:35.360 --> 1:10:37.040
 for exactly the reason that you're saying

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:38.520
 is to understand better

1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:40.080
 and to help treat their patients better.

1:10:40.080 --> 1:10:44.660
 And I've spoken to people who have really been,

1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:47.040
 have found this very helpful to know,

1:10:47.040 --> 1:10:50.300
 okay, this sleep disruption caused by this medication

1:10:50.300 --> 1:10:53.240
 or the libido disruption caused by this other medication,

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:55.160
 wow, that is a big effect.

1:10:55.160 --> 1:10:57.640
 And it really helps with empathy

1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:00.040
 for the patients to understand.

1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:02.520
 I'm not suggesting that physicians

1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:05.640
 or anybody experiment with drugs,

1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:07.440
 but I am relieved to hear that

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:09.640
 because I think that when you're talking about

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:12.540
 accessing somebody's mind and their basic physiology,

1:11:12.540 --> 1:11:13.380
 as you've mentioned,

1:11:13.380 --> 1:11:15.480
 related to appetite, libido, and sleep,

1:11:15.480 --> 1:11:18.720
 you really, one is acting as a mechanic

1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:20.800
 of the person's whole experience.

1:11:20.800 --> 1:11:24.320
 They walk out of the office and they have a life experience

1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:27.000
 that extends beyond the script, yeah.

1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:30.380
 And so, yeah, and so at the same time though,

1:11:30.380 --> 1:11:32.760
 you can't let that completely guide your clinical decisions

1:11:32.760 --> 1:11:33.900
 because as I mentioned,

1:11:33.900 --> 1:11:36.440
 some of these medications that have the most side effects,

1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:38.160
 they are also the most effective.

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:39.580
 And clozapine is a great example.

1:11:39.580 --> 1:11:42.460
 That will work in patients where nothing else works.

1:11:42.460 --> 1:11:43.300
 And believe me,

1:11:43.300 --> 1:11:46.680
 we don't take the step of clozapine prescription lightly

1:11:46.680 --> 1:11:48.260
 because of all these side effects.

1:11:48.260 --> 1:11:50.640
 You have to come in for a weekly blood cell

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:52.440
 or every few weeks of blood cell check

1:11:52.440 --> 1:11:55.780
 to make sure that the blood counts are not off, for example.

1:11:55.780 --> 1:11:58.580
 But there are patients where no other medication works

1:11:58.580 --> 1:12:01.320
 for the schizophrenia and clozapine works amazingly well.

1:12:01.320 --> 1:12:05.280
 And so we do it even though there are the side effects.

1:12:05.280 --> 1:12:07.300
 And so then this comes back to your question,

1:12:07.300 --> 1:12:09.820
 what if we had better and better specificity?

1:12:09.820 --> 1:12:12.940
 Well, only if we know exactly what we're doing is the point.

1:12:12.940 --> 1:12:15.880
 And so, because as we become more refined,

1:12:15.880 --> 1:12:19.240
 we better be right about where we're refining to.

1:12:19.240 --> 1:12:22.560
 And you imagine a day where it will be a single,

1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:24.280
 maybe even outpatient neurosurgery

1:12:24.280 --> 1:12:26.360
 would go in through the skull or the back of the ear,

1:12:26.360 --> 1:12:27.960
 deliver a small viral injection

1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:29.560
 of one of these adenoviruses,

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:32.520
 a little sticker of light emitting diode.

1:12:32.520 --> 1:12:34.320
 Is that it deep in the brain?

1:12:34.320 --> 1:12:36.600
 Is that how you envision this someday?

1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:37.680
 That certainly could happen.

1:12:37.680 --> 1:12:42.680
 What I actually prefer as a vision is still medications

1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:48.720
 because those are minimally invasive.

1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:49.840
 If we knew what we were doing,

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:53.940
 we could make them more specific, have fewer side effects.

1:12:53.940 --> 1:12:56.080
 But optogenetics that'll arm us

1:12:56.080 --> 1:12:58.000
 with true causal understanding.

1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:00.000
 And so we'll know,

1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.440
 and we're already moving rapidly toward this point,

1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:04.520
 we'll know, okay, this symptom,

1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:08.320
 the loss of pleasure in life that we call anhedonia

1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:12.200
 or the loss of motivation or energy

1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:14.400
 to overcome challenges, active coping,

1:13:15.360 --> 1:13:18.600
 these are largely subserved,

1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:21.720
 largely controlled by this circuit or that circuit

1:13:21.720 --> 1:13:24.200
 or the cell that inhabits this other circuit.

1:13:24.200 --> 1:13:25.080
 And we will know that

1:13:25.080 --> 1:13:27.440
 because of the work done with channel ops.

1:13:27.440 --> 1:13:28.760
 Exactly. Yeah, I agree.

1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:32.300
 In ways that we never could have the confidence otherwise.

1:13:32.300 --> 1:13:34.280
 And so we'll know that this is the circuit

1:13:34.280 --> 1:13:38.560
 that underlies the symptom or its resolution.

1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:42.880
 And then we'll get to understand these cells very deeply.

1:13:42.880 --> 1:13:46.520
 Okay, these cells that are causal, that do matter,

1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:47.800
 who are they?

1:13:47.800 --> 1:13:48.820
 What's their wiring?

1:13:48.820 --> 1:13:51.120
 What are the proteins that they make?

1:13:51.120 --> 1:13:54.040
 What are the little things that are on the surface

1:13:54.040 --> 1:13:57.560
 of the cell that could be receptors for specific medications

1:13:57.560 --> 1:14:00.280
 or combinations of receptors

1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:02.820
 that would give us the specificity we need?

1:14:02.820 --> 1:14:05.680
 And then armed with that causal

1:14:05.680 --> 1:14:07.360
 and precise and rigorous knowledge,

1:14:07.360 --> 1:14:10.000
 then you can imagine medication development

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.200
 becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous,

1:14:13.200 --> 1:14:15.360
 but truly grounded in causality.

1:14:15.360 --> 1:14:16.200
 I see.

1:14:16.200 --> 1:14:19.160
 So using channel ops as a way to probe the circuitry

1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:22.940
 and figure out the sites that are disrupted,

1:14:22.940 --> 1:14:24.880
 what patterns of activity are required,

1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:28.360
 and then by understanding the constituents of those cells,

1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:30.000
 like what they express and what they make,

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:32.840
 then developing drugs that could target those cells,

1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:35.260
 not necessarily putting light-inducing diodes

1:14:35.260 --> 1:14:38.160
 into the brain or walking around with wire packs

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.840
 attached to our skull or something like that.

1:14:40.840 --> 1:14:42.000
 That's fantastic.

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:46.400
 And I realize no one has a crystal ball,

1:14:46.400 --> 1:14:50.360
 but what do you think the arc of that is?

1:14:50.360 --> 1:14:53.000
 Meaning, are we going to see that in a year,

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.360
 in two years, three years?

1:14:55.360 --> 1:14:56.380
 Let me reframe that.

1:14:56.380 --> 1:15:00.820
 If, how soon will a pill-based treatment

1:15:00.820 --> 1:15:03.060
 for a psychiatric disease be available

1:15:03.060 --> 1:15:06.320
 that targets a specific set of cells

1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:07.900
 that we know are important

1:15:08.820 --> 1:15:11.900
 because of the work done with channel ops?

1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:14.460
 I think that is, in some ways,

1:15:14.460 --> 1:15:19.460
 it's already happening at the level of individual patients.

1:15:19.540 --> 1:15:20.960
 And- Here at Stanford.

1:15:20.960 --> 1:15:22.300
 Yeah, yep.

1:15:22.300 --> 1:15:26.460
 And more broadly, in terms of new drugs,

1:15:26.460 --> 1:15:29.900
 new multicenter clinical trials

1:15:29.900 --> 1:15:32.180
 that'll play out over the next few years.

1:15:33.100 --> 1:15:36.900
 And these could be drugs that are already safe and approved

1:15:36.900 --> 1:15:40.100
 for other purposes, but we might say,

1:15:40.100 --> 1:15:43.300
 okay, now we know that this medication,

1:15:44.380 --> 1:15:47.420
 based on what we know from causal optogenetics,

1:15:47.420 --> 1:15:50.500
 this could be useful for this other purpose,

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:52.700
 this psychiatric symptom.

1:15:52.700 --> 1:15:56.500
 And so the path to helping patients

1:15:56.500 --> 1:15:58.980
 could be relatively swift.

1:15:58.980 --> 1:16:00.700
 That's very exciting.

1:16:00.700 --> 1:16:03.900
 What are your thoughts about brain-machine interface?

1:16:03.900 --> 1:16:06.700
 And Neuralink always comes up,

1:16:06.700 --> 1:16:08.620
 although I do want to point out,

1:16:08.620 --> 1:16:10.780
 I have tremendous respect for the folks at Neuralink,

1:16:10.780 --> 1:16:12.480
 including someone who came up through my lab,

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:13.700
 is now there as a neurosurgeon,

1:16:13.700 --> 1:16:16.940
 but the brain-machine interface is something

1:16:16.940 --> 1:16:19.180
 that's been happening for a long time now.

1:16:19.180 --> 1:16:21.140
 Some of the best work,

1:16:21.140 --> 1:16:23.100
 among the best work being done here at Stanford

1:16:23.100 --> 1:16:25.340
 and elsewhere too, of course.

1:16:25.340 --> 1:16:27.980
 How is what you just described compatible with

1:16:27.980 --> 1:16:29.740
 or different than brain-machine interface,

1:16:29.740 --> 1:16:31.780
 meaning devices, little probes,

1:16:31.780 --> 1:16:33.580
 they're going to stimulate different patterns of activity

1:16:33.580 --> 1:16:35.420
 and ensembles of neurons.

1:16:35.420 --> 1:16:36.700
 And what are your general thoughts

1:16:36.700 --> 1:16:40.240
 about brain-machine interface as going forward?

1:16:40.240 --> 1:16:43.300
 Yeah, I mean, this is, first of all,

1:16:43.300 --> 1:16:47.260
 it's an amazing scientific discovery approach.

1:16:47.260 --> 1:16:49.380
 As you mentioned, we and others here at Stanford

1:16:49.380 --> 1:16:52.140
 are using electrodes, collecting information

1:16:52.140 --> 1:16:54.500
 from tens of thousands of neurons.

1:16:54.500 --> 1:16:56.340
 In humans, I should add.

1:16:56.340 --> 1:16:59.740
 And even, yes, there's quite,

1:16:59.740 --> 1:17:01.260
 even separate from the Neuralink work,

1:17:01.260 --> 1:17:02.140
 as you point out,

1:17:02.140 --> 1:17:05.100
 many people have been doing this in humans

1:17:05.100 --> 1:17:06.800
 as well as in non-human primates.

1:17:07.760 --> 1:17:10.820
 And this is pretty powerful, it's important.

1:17:10.820 --> 1:17:13.700
 This will let us understand what's going on in the brain

1:17:13.700 --> 1:17:18.100
 in psychiatric disease and neurological disease

1:17:18.100 --> 1:17:20.100
 and will give us ideas for treatment.

1:17:21.860 --> 1:17:24.740
 It is, of course, it's still invasive.

1:17:24.740 --> 1:17:29.740
 You still are talking about putting a device into the brain

1:17:30.100 --> 1:17:35.100
 and that has to be treated as a situation

1:17:35.900 --> 1:17:38.020
 that has some risks and a step

1:17:38.020 --> 1:17:39.580
 that has to be taken carefully.

1:17:39.580 --> 1:17:44.580
 I see that as something that will be part of psychiatry

1:17:45.580 --> 1:17:47.940
 in the long run.

1:17:47.940 --> 1:17:51.020
 Already with deep brain stimulation approaches,

1:17:51.020 --> 1:17:54.620
 we can help people with psychiatric disorders,

1:17:54.620 --> 1:17:56.500
 and that's putting just a single electrode,

1:17:56.500 --> 1:18:00.260
 not even a complex closed loop system

1:18:00.260 --> 1:18:02.780
 where you're both playing in and getting information back.

1:18:02.780 --> 1:18:05.940
 Even just a single stimulation electrode in the brain

1:18:05.940 --> 1:18:09.140
 can help people with OCD, for example,

1:18:09.140 --> 1:18:10.060
 quite powerfully.

1:18:11.180 --> 1:18:12.700
 And that will become much more powerful

1:18:12.700 --> 1:18:14.980
 when we get to a true brain-machine interface,

1:18:14.980 --> 1:18:17.340
 collecting information back,

1:18:17.340 --> 1:18:18.900
 stimulating only when you need to.

1:18:18.900 --> 1:18:23.260
 If we could identify a pathological activity pattern,

1:18:23.260 --> 1:18:25.620
 a particular, almost like the prodrome

1:18:25.620 --> 1:18:27.100
 or the early stage of a seizure,

1:18:27.100 --> 1:18:30.300
 maybe there are events that happen leading up to,

1:18:30.300 --> 1:18:34.580
 on some timescale, a psychiatric symptom.

1:18:34.580 --> 1:18:37.260
 We could intervene in a closed loop way,

1:18:37.260 --> 1:18:40.220
 detect what's happening, what's starting to go wrong,

1:18:40.220 --> 1:18:43.260
 feed that back to the brain stimulation electrode,

1:18:43.260 --> 1:18:47.300
 have it be in that way more efficient and more principled.

1:18:47.300 --> 1:18:50.340
 This is, I think, it's great.

1:18:50.340 --> 1:18:53.380
 It's something that, of course, will be grounded again

1:18:53.380 --> 1:18:54.380
 in causal understanding.

1:18:54.380 --> 1:18:56.700
 We'll need to know what is that pathological pattern

1:18:56.700 --> 1:18:59.060
 that we're detecting, and we need to know that it matters.

1:18:59.060 --> 1:19:01.300
 And so again, that's where optogenetics is helping us,

1:19:01.300 --> 1:19:04.180
 helping us know, okay, this pattern of activity

1:19:04.180 --> 1:19:05.620
 in these cells, in these circuits,

1:19:05.620 --> 1:19:10.260
 this does mean that there's a particular kind of symptom

1:19:10.260 --> 1:19:11.100
 that's happening.

1:19:12.180 --> 1:19:14.260
 But armed with that knowledge, absolutely.

1:19:14.260 --> 1:19:17.580
 Even the simple closed loop device detect and stimulate

1:19:17.580 --> 1:19:19.260
 is going to be part of psychiatry in the future.

1:19:19.260 --> 1:19:22.620
 And then, of course, as you get to more cells,

1:19:22.620 --> 1:19:25.740
 more connections, the ability that we have to help people

1:19:25.740 --> 1:19:27.020
 will become more powerful.

1:19:28.020 --> 1:19:32.140
 One of the questions I get asked a lot is about ADHD

1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:34.980
 and attention deficit of various kinds.

1:19:34.980 --> 1:19:39.180
 I have the hunch that one reason I get asked so often

1:19:39.180 --> 1:19:42.260
 is that people are feeling really distracted

1:19:42.260 --> 1:19:46.020
 and challenged in funneling their attention

1:19:46.020 --> 1:19:47.100
 and their behavior.

1:19:47.100 --> 1:19:51.220
 But, and there are a number of reasons for that, of course.

1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:56.220
 But what is true ADHD, and what does it look like?

1:19:56.460 --> 1:19:57.980
 What can be done for it?

1:19:57.980 --> 1:20:01.340
 And what, if any, role for channel opsins

1:20:01.340 --> 1:20:04.700
 or these downstream technologies that you're developing?

1:20:04.700 --> 1:20:08.460
 What do they offer for people that suffer from ADHD

1:20:08.460 --> 1:20:11.420
 or have a family member that suffers from ADHD?

1:20:11.420 --> 1:20:12.580
 Yeah.

1:20:12.580 --> 1:20:16.780
 This is a pretty interesting branch of psychiatry.

1:20:16.780 --> 1:20:18.620
 There's no question that people have been helped

1:20:18.620 --> 1:20:20.620
 by the treatments.

1:20:20.620 --> 1:20:25.460
 There's active debate over what fraction of people

1:20:25.460 --> 1:20:29.820
 who have these symptoms can or should be treated.

1:20:29.820 --> 1:20:32.820
 This is typically Adderall or stimulants of some kind.

1:20:32.820 --> 1:20:34.660
 For example, the stimulants, that's right.

1:20:34.660 --> 1:20:39.340
 So ADHD, as its name suggests, it has symptoms of,

1:20:39.340 --> 1:20:41.860
 it can have either a hyperactive state

1:20:41.860 --> 1:20:44.360
 or an inattentive state.

1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:48.020
 And those can be completely separate from each other.

1:20:48.020 --> 1:20:51.460
 You could have a patient who effectively

1:20:51.460 --> 1:20:53.080
 is not hyperactive at all,

1:20:53.080 --> 1:20:57.020
 but can't remain focused on what's going on around them.

1:20:57.020 --> 1:20:58.420
 So their body can be still,

1:20:58.420 --> 1:21:00.580
 but their mind is darting around.

1:21:00.580 --> 1:21:01.420
 That's right.

1:21:01.420 --> 1:21:03.600
 They can be very hyperactive with their body.

1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:04.440
 It happens both ways.

1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:06.080
 Probably rarely is somebody hyperactive with their body,

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:07.260
 but their mind is still.

1:21:07.260 --> 1:21:08.100
 Although I have to say,

1:21:08.100 --> 1:21:11.020
 and this is a benevolent shout out to Botan Roska,

1:21:11.020 --> 1:21:15.380
 Botan has an incredibly sharp and focused mind.

1:21:15.380 --> 1:21:17.940
 And his hand movements are extremely exact also.

1:21:17.940 --> 1:21:21.460
 So I do sometimes wonder whether or not our body movements

1:21:21.460 --> 1:21:22.940
 and our head movements are,

1:21:22.940 --> 1:21:25.540
 whether or not they're coordinated or not is a readout

1:21:25.540 --> 1:21:28.480
 of how directed our attention is.

1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:31.360
 I notice I have to think complex abstract thoughts.

1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:32.940
 I notice I have to be very still.

1:21:32.940 --> 1:21:35.980
 So my body has to be almost completely unmoving

1:21:35.980 --> 1:21:39.580
 for me to think very abstractly and deeply.

1:21:39.580 --> 1:21:40.580
 Other people are different.

1:21:40.580 --> 1:21:41.780
 Some people, when they're running,

1:21:41.780 --> 1:21:42.760
 they get their best thoughts.

1:21:42.760 --> 1:21:44.060
 I can't even imagine that.

1:21:44.060 --> 1:21:45.820
 My brain does not work that way at all.

1:21:45.820 --> 1:21:47.820
 I have to be totally motionless,

1:21:47.820 --> 1:21:48.860
 which is kind of interesting.

1:21:48.860 --> 1:21:50.020
 How do you go about that?

1:21:50.020 --> 1:21:53.020
 I sit much like this.

1:21:53.020 --> 1:21:56.100
 I try to have time in each day

1:21:56.100 --> 1:22:01.100
 where I am literally sitting almost in this position,

1:22:01.940 --> 1:22:04.180
 but without distraction and thinking.

1:22:04.180 --> 1:22:05.760
 And so it's kind of a,

1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:07.400
 it's almost meditative in some ways,

1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:10.400
 except it's not true meditation,

1:22:10.400 --> 1:22:12.940
 but I am thinking while not moving.

1:22:12.940 --> 1:22:15.580
 You're trying to structure your thoughts in that time.

1:22:15.580 --> 1:22:17.500
 Yeah, that's right. Interesting.

1:22:17.500 --> 1:22:20.740
 So, but everybody, as you say, is very different.

1:22:20.740 --> 1:22:23.180
 And so with ADHD, you have,

1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:24.580
 the key thing is we want to make sure

1:22:24.580 --> 1:22:28.960
 that this is present across different domains of life,

1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:30.460
 school and home,

1:22:30.460 --> 1:22:32.820
 to show that it really is a pervasive pattern

1:22:32.820 --> 1:22:35.460
 and not something specific to the teacher

1:22:35.460 --> 1:22:37.980
 or the home situation or something.

1:22:37.980 --> 1:22:39.140
 And then you can help patients.

1:22:39.140 --> 1:22:42.540
 It's interesting that ADHD is one of those disorders

1:22:42.540 --> 1:22:43.860
 where people are trying to work

1:22:43.860 --> 1:22:46.580
 on quantitative EEG-based diagnoses.

1:22:46.580 --> 1:22:50.780
 And so there's some progress toward making up a diagnosis

1:22:50.780 --> 1:22:54.020
 with looking at particular externally detectable

1:22:54.020 --> 1:22:55.340
 brainwave rhythms.

1:22:55.340 --> 1:22:57.020
 So skull cap with some electrodes

1:22:57.020 --> 1:22:58.300
 that don't penetrate the skull.

1:22:58.300 --> 1:22:59.140
 That's right.

1:22:59.140 --> 1:23:01.700
 And this can be done in an hour or two hour session.

1:23:01.700 --> 1:23:02.540
 That's right.

1:23:02.540 --> 1:23:03.940
 Has to be done in a clinic, right?

1:23:03.940 --> 1:23:04.940
 Yeah, in the clinic, right,

1:23:04.940 --> 1:23:07.620
 you have to have the right recording apparatus and so on.

1:23:07.620 --> 1:23:11.440
 But that's in principle,

1:23:11.440 --> 1:23:13.380
 as increasing confidence comes

1:23:13.380 --> 1:23:18.340
 in exactly which measurements one could even imagine

1:23:18.340 --> 1:23:21.480
 moving toward home tests, but we're not there yet.

1:23:22.420 --> 1:23:23.260
 Amazing.

1:23:23.260 --> 1:23:25.260
 One of the reasons I get asked about it so much

1:23:25.260 --> 1:23:27.980
 is a lot of people wonder if they have ADHD.

1:23:27.980 --> 1:23:30.820
 Do you think that some of the lifestyle factors

1:23:30.820 --> 1:23:34.480
 that inhabit us all these days

1:23:34.480 --> 1:23:39.260
 could induce a subclinical or a clinical-like ADHD?

1:23:39.260 --> 1:23:42.700
 Meaning if I look at people's phone use, including my own,

1:23:42.700 --> 1:23:44.460
 and I don't think of it like addiction,

1:23:44.460 --> 1:23:47.060
 it looks to me and feels to me more like OCD.

1:23:47.060 --> 1:23:48.940
 And I'll come clean here by saying when I was younger,

1:23:48.940 --> 1:23:51.340
 when I was a kid, I had a grunting tic.

1:23:51.340 --> 1:23:52.180
 I used to hide it.

1:23:52.180 --> 1:23:53.500
 I actually used to hide in the closet

1:23:53.500 --> 1:23:55.700
 because my dad would make me stop.

1:23:55.700 --> 1:23:59.180
 And I used to, I couldn't feel any relief of my mind

1:23:59.180 --> 1:24:00.540
 until I would do this.

1:24:00.540 --> 1:24:02.860
 And actually now, if I get very tired,

1:24:02.860 --> 1:24:05.540
 if I've been pushing long hours, it'll come back.

1:24:05.540 --> 1:24:06.960
 I was not treated for it,

1:24:08.040 --> 1:24:11.740
 but I will confess that I've had the experience of,

1:24:11.740 --> 1:24:14.460
 I always liked sports where I involved a lot of impact,

1:24:14.460 --> 1:24:16.940
 fortunately not football, because I went to high school

1:24:16.940 --> 1:24:18.420
 where the football team was terrible.

1:24:18.420 --> 1:24:20.280
 Maybe that would have avoided more impact,

1:24:20.280 --> 1:24:24.600
 but things like skateboarding, boxing, they bring relief.

1:24:24.600 --> 1:24:27.980
 I feel clarity after a head hit, which I avoid,

1:24:27.980 --> 1:24:30.080
 but I used to say that's the only time

1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:31.700
 I feel truly clear for a long,

1:24:31.700 --> 1:24:33.180
 and then eventually it dissipated.

1:24:33.180 --> 1:24:35.720
 By about age 16, 17, it just disappeared.

1:24:36.860 --> 1:24:40.000
 So I have great empathy for those that feel

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.600
 like there's something contained in them

1:24:41.600 --> 1:24:42.940
 that won't allow them to focus on

1:24:42.940 --> 1:24:44.580
 what they want to focus on.

1:24:44.580 --> 1:24:49.080
 And these days with the phone and all these email, et cetera,

1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:52.340
 I wonder, and I empathize a bit

1:24:52.340 --> 1:24:54.580
 when I hear people saying like,

1:24:54.580 --> 1:24:57.520
 I think I might have ADHD or ADD.

1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:00.220
 Do you think it's possible that our behaviors

1:25:00.220 --> 1:25:02.580
 and our interaction with the sensory world,

1:25:02.580 --> 1:25:04.900
 which is really what phones and email really are,

1:25:04.900 --> 1:25:07.720
 could induce ADD or reactivate it?

1:25:09.460 --> 1:25:10.420
 This is a great question.

1:25:10.420 --> 1:25:11.780
 I think about it a lot.

1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:16.580
 And you mentioned this tic-like behavior in yourself.

1:25:16.580 --> 1:25:19.280
 It's very common that people who have tics

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:20.820
 have this building up of something

1:25:20.820 --> 1:25:23.340
 that can only be relieved by executing the tic,

1:25:23.340 --> 1:25:25.340
 which can be a motor movement

1:25:25.340 --> 1:25:28.460
 or a vocalization or even a thought.

1:25:28.460 --> 1:25:32.580
 And people do, I think these days do have this,

1:25:32.580 --> 1:25:34.260
 if they haven't checked their phone in a while,

1:25:34.260 --> 1:25:36.140
 they do have a buildup, a buildup, a buildup

1:25:36.140 --> 1:25:38.580
 until they can check it and relieve it.

1:25:38.580 --> 1:25:41.060
 And there's some similarities.

1:25:41.060 --> 1:25:44.820
 There is a little reward that comes with the checking,

1:25:44.820 --> 1:25:48.820
 but the key question in all of psychiatry,

1:25:48.820 --> 1:25:50.980
 what we do is we don't diagnose something

1:25:50.980 --> 1:25:54.540
 unless it's disrupting what we call

1:25:54.540 --> 1:25:56.300
 social or occupational functioning.

1:25:56.300 --> 1:25:59.180
 Like you could have any number of symptoms,

1:25:59.180 --> 1:26:03.620
 but literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires

1:26:03.620 --> 1:26:06.660
 that it has to be disrupting someone's social

1:26:06.660 --> 1:26:08.380
 or occupational functioning.

1:26:08.380 --> 1:26:11.020
 And these days, checking your phone is pretty adaptive.

1:26:11.020 --> 1:26:12.860
 That pretty much helps your social

1:26:12.860 --> 1:26:13.980
 and occupational functioning.

1:26:13.980 --> 1:26:18.980
 And so we can't make it a psychiatric diagnosis,

1:26:19.580 --> 1:26:22.000
 at least in the world of today.

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.380
 Yeah, opting out of communication now

1:26:24.380 --> 1:26:27.340
 makes you in some ways less adaptive,

1:26:27.340 --> 1:26:29.820
 though I would point to you as an example

1:26:29.820 --> 1:26:34.480
 of somebody who is quite good at managing his interactions,

1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:36.760
 at least from the outsider perspective.

1:26:36.760 --> 1:26:39.500
 I do want to ask you a little bit about you.

1:26:39.500 --> 1:26:43.080
 And first of all,

1:26:43.080 --> 1:26:44.940
 and I realize this is only a partial list,

1:26:44.940 --> 1:26:48.100
 but you're a clinician, you see patients,

1:26:48.100 --> 1:26:49.220
 you run a big laboratory.

1:26:49.220 --> 1:26:51.460
 How many people are in your laboratory now?

1:26:51.460 --> 1:26:53.840
 That's a huge laboratory.

1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:56.800
 From experience, I can say that's an enormous laboratory.

1:26:58.580 --> 1:27:00.940
 You have a family of five children

1:27:00.940 --> 1:27:02.400
 and you're happily married

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:04.620
 to a wonderful colleague of ours as well,

1:27:04.620 --> 1:27:06.380
 who does incredible work.

1:27:06.380 --> 1:27:11.380
 How do you organize at a kind of conceptual level

1:27:13.940 --> 1:27:15.700
 the day and the week?

1:27:16.600 --> 1:27:20.740
 And I should say what stress mitigation practices, if any,

1:27:20.740 --> 1:27:21.700
 do you incorporate?

1:27:21.700 --> 1:27:24.540
 I've received emails from you at three in the morning.

1:27:24.540 --> 1:27:26.060
 I sometimes send emails at three in the morning,

1:27:26.060 --> 1:27:28.420
 but that's when I wake up, maybe I'm depressed,

1:27:28.420 --> 1:27:30.060
 but I go back to sleep.

1:27:30.060 --> 1:27:34.660
 So maybe you just describe the arc of the blocks of the day,

1:27:34.660 --> 1:27:37.020
 not hour by hour, necessarily the details

1:27:37.020 --> 1:27:38.240
 of what are in those blocks,

1:27:38.240 --> 1:27:41.120
 but how do you conceptualize the day?

1:27:41.120 --> 1:27:43.540
 How do you conceptualize the week?

1:27:43.540 --> 1:27:47.920
 And how do you feel about how that's lined up

1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:50.620
 with your larger goals of making sure

1:27:50.620 --> 1:27:55.100
 these five young people flourish, which I hear they are.

1:27:56.120 --> 1:27:58.300
 But how do you go about this?

1:27:58.300 --> 1:27:59.700
 What for most people would just be

1:27:59.700 --> 1:28:02.340
 an overwhelming set of items?

1:28:02.340 --> 1:28:07.340
 Well, of course, sometimes it's just take it day by day,

1:28:08.420 --> 1:28:10.940
 and so I don't claim-

1:28:10.940 --> 1:28:13.140
 So you bring the horizon into the unit of the day.

1:28:13.140 --> 1:28:16.780
 I do, I do, the unit is the day, that's right.

1:28:16.780 --> 1:28:21.500
 And what I try to have in each day,

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:24.960
 as I mentioned earlier, some, at least an hour of time

1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:27.820
 where I can think, and that can be,

1:28:27.820 --> 1:28:30.380
 it can be when kids are napping, it can be,

1:28:30.380 --> 1:28:33.820
 you know, actually, because I, while driving,

1:28:33.820 --> 1:28:36.380
 I can do that too, because I'm sitting still.

1:28:37.980 --> 1:28:42.220
 But that's the one thing I try to preserve.

1:28:42.220 --> 1:28:43.420
 When I was writing the book,

1:28:43.420 --> 1:28:46.960
 I adapted that time to be my writing time,

1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:48.380
 but it wasn't enough.

1:28:48.380 --> 1:28:52.140
 It's, you know, so I had to add in a new block of time,

1:28:52.140 --> 1:28:56.340
 which was sort of midnight to 2 a.m. writing time.

1:28:56.340 --> 1:29:01.340
 And so that, carving out these even small protected times

1:29:02.700 --> 1:29:04.140
 are very important.

1:29:04.140 --> 1:29:05.860
 There's, of course, you know,

1:29:05.860 --> 1:29:09.580
 obligations will expand to fill the time available,

1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:11.460
 and you have to be disciplined in my,

1:29:11.460 --> 1:29:13.420
 at least I found I had to be disciplined

1:29:13.420 --> 1:29:18.220
 in truly protecting those times where one can think.

1:29:18.220 --> 1:29:19.620
 So that means no phone?

1:29:19.620 --> 1:29:22.080
 That means no phone, no checking of the phone.

1:29:23.620 --> 1:29:25.460
 I would, you know, when I was writing the book,

1:29:25.460 --> 1:29:30.460
 I would have, there's a focus mode on the MacBook,

1:29:32.300 --> 1:29:35.940
 which kind of removes the border,

1:29:35.940 --> 1:29:38.380
 and you just have your documents,

1:29:38.380 --> 1:29:39.500
 and it's very pure,

1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:43.740
 and you don't have the temptation of distraction.

1:29:43.740 --> 1:29:45.460
 I'm a big believer in,

1:29:45.460 --> 1:29:48.560
 because the vision and the eyes play such a prominent role

1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:49.720
 in directing our cognition,

1:29:49.720 --> 1:29:53.020
 something you talk about in the book really beautifully,

1:29:53.020 --> 1:29:58.020
 and with a lot of depth and rigor, using visual tools

1:29:58.700 --> 1:30:01.820
 to harness one's complete mental attention.

1:30:01.820 --> 1:30:04.480
 When you do this practice of sitting and just thinking,

1:30:04.480 --> 1:30:07.640
 sitting still and thinking, you said your eyes are open.

1:30:08.560 --> 1:30:11.700
 Are you hearing your own verbal voice,

1:30:11.700 --> 1:30:12.540
 although in your head?

1:30:12.540 --> 1:30:15.340
 So you're actually in conversation with yourself.

1:30:15.340 --> 1:30:18.300
 Yes, and hearing, literally, I mean, not quite literally.

1:30:18.300 --> 1:30:21.620
 I don't actually hear a phonation, but I'm hearing words.

1:30:21.620 --> 1:30:25.540
 And so I discovered this about myself.

1:30:25.540 --> 1:30:29.620
 Other people, I think, may operate differently,

1:30:29.620 --> 1:30:32.300
 but I'm extremely verbal in how I think.

1:30:32.300 --> 1:30:33.860
 That's how all my reasoning is done.

1:30:33.860 --> 1:30:38.860
 It's with sentences and construction of, you know,

1:30:39.300 --> 1:30:41.060
 almost equations with words.

1:30:41.060 --> 1:30:42.280
 Complete sentences?

1:30:42.280 --> 1:30:45.860
 Complete sentences, or completish, anyway, mostly complete.

1:30:45.860 --> 1:30:47.780
 And then, when writing the book,

1:30:47.780 --> 1:30:50.540
 everything about the writing, I would always,

1:30:50.540 --> 1:30:54.180
 every sentence was always played out in my mind,

1:30:54.180 --> 1:30:56.860
 listening for rhythm and timing,

1:30:56.860 --> 1:31:01.260
 and I would obsess over exact placement of words

1:31:01.260 --> 1:31:04.980
 to get the right rhythm of the spoken sentence in my mind.

1:31:04.980 --> 1:31:08.060
 I don't mean to interrupt your flow, but when you do that,

1:31:08.060 --> 1:31:10.260
 and having experienced this process a bit,

1:31:10.260 --> 1:31:12.300
 although differently,

1:31:12.300 --> 1:31:15.200
 do you experience any kind of welling up of anxiety

1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:18.000
 when you're hitting the friction points?

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:21.540
 And if so, do you have tools or ways

1:31:21.540 --> 1:31:24.060
 that you quell that anxiety in real time?

1:31:24.060 --> 1:31:26.980
 Because what we're really talking about here is your mind,

1:31:26.980 --> 1:31:29.140
 but what we're really talking about is this process

1:31:29.140 --> 1:31:32.920
 of converting the activity of neurons

1:31:32.920 --> 1:31:36.100
 into something physically concrete in the world,

1:31:36.100 --> 1:31:39.500
 and these intermediate steps are so mysterious to everybody.

1:31:39.500 --> 1:31:41.860
 We hear, you know, just write the book, just do it,

1:31:41.860 --> 1:31:43.180
 whatever that means.

1:31:43.180 --> 1:31:44.480
 In fact, statements like that, to me,

1:31:44.480 --> 1:31:47.020
 are kind of empty and meaningless.

1:31:47.020 --> 1:31:49.400
 But when you hear your voice

1:31:49.400 --> 1:31:51.580
 and you're trying to find the correct word

1:31:51.580 --> 1:31:55.680
 and you keep hitting, it doesn't sound quite right,

1:31:55.680 --> 1:31:58.140
 what is the experience in your body?

1:31:58.140 --> 1:32:03.060
 Yeah, when it's not right, it's definitely, it's aversive.

1:32:03.060 --> 1:32:07.060
 It doesn't feel good, but it's not,

1:32:07.060 --> 1:32:10.220
 but there's also a hope because I know I can solve it too,

1:32:10.220 --> 1:32:12.380
 and so there's this,

1:32:14.020 --> 1:32:16.600
 it's almost like you're almost there, you know?

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:19.220
 There's a path that you know is there.

1:32:19.220 --> 1:32:22.500
 You don't quite see it, but it's there,

1:32:22.500 --> 1:32:24.140
 and I keep that in mind,

1:32:24.140 --> 1:32:29.140
 and so there's this propulsive force forward

1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:31.520
 because I know that the solution is there,

1:32:31.520 --> 1:32:36.520
 and that said, you know, there were single words

1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:39.620
 that I would spend days on

1:32:39.620 --> 1:32:42.380
 because I was just not happy until I got it right,

1:32:42.380 --> 1:32:45.380
 and there were some things that I never quite got perfect,

1:32:45.380 --> 1:32:47.060
 and so I left out of the book entirely

1:32:47.060 --> 1:32:50.420
 because it was so close, but not quite there,

1:32:50.420 --> 1:32:53.640
 and so at the end, I was like, no, I can't put that in.

1:32:53.640 --> 1:32:55.440
 Everything you just said is entirely consistent

1:32:55.440 --> 1:32:56.940
 with my experience of you

1:32:58.260 --> 1:33:00.940
 and the way you go about everything.

1:33:00.940 --> 1:33:02.980
 I have to ask, are your kids writers,

1:33:02.980 --> 1:33:05.240
 do they like books and words and poetry?

1:33:05.240 --> 1:33:07.160
 I know one of your children is going on

1:33:07.160 --> 1:33:09.240
 to a career in medicine and science.

1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:11.660
 Yeah, they're each different, which is amazing,

1:33:11.660 --> 1:33:14.400
 yet they all, I think, do have some appreciation

1:33:14.400 --> 1:33:17.120
 or a lot of appreciation for reading,

1:33:17.120 --> 1:33:19.020
 but some are very musical.

1:33:19.020 --> 1:33:21.460
 Two of the five are extremely musical,

1:33:21.460 --> 1:33:23.840
 very, very talented with guitar and singing

1:33:23.840 --> 1:33:27.280
 and vocal impressions.

1:33:27.280 --> 1:33:28.640
 It's just astonishing,

1:33:28.640 --> 1:33:32.920
 and some of them are great with drawing and artistry,

1:33:32.920 --> 1:33:35.660
 and some are very physical and vigorous

1:33:35.660 --> 1:33:39.340
 and are never happy except when leaping about,

1:33:39.340 --> 1:33:42.420
 and so it's just amazing how different they are, honestly,

1:33:42.420 --> 1:33:46.040
 but I think there is a shared appreciation for language.

1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:49.900
 Do you think that one can train their mind

1:33:49.900 --> 1:33:52.040
 in using these practices?

1:33:52.040 --> 1:33:55.920
 I really like your description of the sitting,

1:33:55.920 --> 1:33:57.140
 staying physically still

1:33:57.140 --> 1:34:00.620
 and learning to grapple with those challenges.

1:34:00.620 --> 1:34:03.140
 It's something that, especially in laboratory science,

1:34:03.140 --> 1:34:05.520
 we aren't really trained to do.

1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:06.460
 Like many professions,

1:34:06.460 --> 1:34:09.100
 we're taught to come in and just get into motion,

1:34:09.100 --> 1:34:10.700
 and I found that very relaxing

1:34:10.700 --> 1:34:13.140
 as someone who probably has an underlying tick

1:34:13.140 --> 1:34:15.340
 or something like that, it felt great to be in motion.

1:34:15.340 --> 1:34:16.180
 One of the hardest things

1:34:16.180 --> 1:34:18.880
 about becoming a university professor and running a lab

1:34:18.880 --> 1:34:21.680
 was that I was no longer working with my hands,

1:34:21.680 --> 1:34:26.620
 and it felt like some big important part of my life

1:34:26.620 --> 1:34:28.140
 had been amputated,

1:34:28.140 --> 1:34:31.100
 but what sorts of practices do you incorporate there,

1:34:31.100 --> 1:34:35.500
 and do you think people can learn to get better at focusing

1:34:35.500 --> 1:34:38.800
 through a dedicated practice of the sort that you describe?

1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:42.280
 I think, you know, that I also,

1:34:42.280 --> 1:34:46.140
 I remember the rhythms of physical work

1:34:46.140 --> 1:34:47.440
 in the laboratory very well.

1:34:47.440 --> 1:34:52.440
 I, my work, you know, these days as the laboratory leader,

1:34:54.200 --> 1:34:57.040
 my job is returned mostly to words now again,

1:34:57.040 --> 1:34:59.280
 and so it's kind of coming full circle.

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:04.280
 It was, so it's a different mode.

1:35:04.360 --> 1:35:06.040
 I think you just have to embrace

1:35:06.040 --> 1:35:07.880
 that different stages of life

1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:09.220
 come with different modes,

1:35:09.220 --> 1:35:11.240
 but you can definitely train yourself for each mode.

1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:16.240
 I was not, you know, I loved, you know,

1:35:16.800 --> 1:35:20.020
 as I mentioned, the rhythm of sewing

1:35:20.020 --> 1:35:22.480
 and suturing and surgery,

1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:27.960
 and I worked really hard on that and became good at it,

1:35:27.960 --> 1:35:31.460
 and now I never do it, but it's what's the next challenge.

1:35:31.460 --> 1:35:33.720
 You know, there's all the various experimental techniques,

1:35:33.720 --> 1:35:36.080
 the dissections of the brain, you know,

1:35:36.080 --> 1:35:39.200
 I can't tell you how many thousands of brain dissections

1:35:39.200 --> 1:35:41.280
 I've done in my life, and now I don't do them at all.

1:35:41.280 --> 1:35:42.480
 And then you developed a method

1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:44.200
 so that we don't have to dissect brains.

1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:46.800
 As you mentioned, maybe tell us for a moment about clarity

1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:50.600
 and for people who will probably never set foot

1:35:50.600 --> 1:35:53.840
 into a laboratory, what an incredible,

1:35:53.840 --> 1:35:58.840
 yet another incredible discovery and development clarity is

1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:02.380
 and why it helps us understand how the brain is structured.

1:36:02.380 --> 1:36:04.840
 Yeah, so this is a different technology

1:36:04.840 --> 1:36:06.840
 also developed in my lab here,

1:36:06.840 --> 1:36:10.000
 and it's a part of a broader approach

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.240
 that we call hydrogel tissue chemistry.

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:15.240
 And what this is is it's building a gel,

1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:18.380
 like a clear, jello-like substance

1:36:18.380 --> 1:36:22.000
 from within all the cells of a tissue

1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:23.920
 or even an animal all at once.

1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:26.440
 So you're building, effectively building a gel

1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:28.800
 inside all the cells at once.

1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:30.920
 Now that's an odd thing to do.

1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:31.760
 Why do we do it?

1:36:31.760 --> 1:36:36.000
 Well, we do it to transform the tissue

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.840
 into a more tractable, accessible object.

1:36:39.840 --> 1:36:43.200
 And the reason that works is having built this gel,

1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:47.120
 this new infrastructure inside the tissue,

1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:48.720
 we can then use chemical tricks

1:36:48.720 --> 1:36:51.420
 and we can link the molecules we care about,

1:36:51.420 --> 1:36:55.520
 like proteins or RNAs, which are the things,

1:36:55.520 --> 1:36:57.960
 as you know, right before they become proteins,

1:36:57.960 --> 1:37:01.480
 we can link them, physically anchor them

1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:04.480
 to this gel, which is a scaffold, basically.

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:07.960
 It's an interlocking network of polymers.

1:37:07.960 --> 1:37:10.640
 We can link all these interesting molecules in place,

1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:13.280
 lock them in where they were initially,

1:37:13.280 --> 1:37:16.400
 in the tissue, in the cell, in all the cells.

1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:18.520
 And then we can remove very vigorously

1:37:18.520 --> 1:37:19.880
 everything we don't care about

1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:21.840
 that's blocking our light,

1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:23.940
 that's blocking our molecules coming in

1:37:23.940 --> 1:37:26.520
 to exchange information with the tissue.

1:37:26.520 --> 1:37:28.080
 We can get rid of everything else,

1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:29.420
 like the lipids, the fats.

1:37:29.420 --> 1:37:33.560
 We can effectively use detergents to get them all out.

1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:35.600
 And then we can see in all the things

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:38.080
 that we're absorbing, our scattering light are gone.

1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:40.760
 You can have a brain that's completely transparent,

1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:42.320
 and yet all the interesting molecules

1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:43.560
 are still locked into place there

1:37:43.560 --> 1:37:45.760
 at the cellular and subcellular level.

1:37:45.760 --> 1:37:47.620
 And so this is hydrogel tissue chemistry.

1:37:47.620 --> 1:37:50.860
 The first form we described was called Clarity.

1:37:50.860 --> 1:37:52.440
 We use that quite a bit still,

1:37:52.440 --> 1:37:54.240
 but there are many variants now

1:37:54.240 --> 1:37:55.480
 that we and others have developed

1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:58.360
 on this basic concept of building this gel

1:37:58.360 --> 1:38:00.560
 within the tissue and anchoring molecules into place.

1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:02.120
 Literally glass clear brains.

1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:05.320
 I've done this, I've taken a brain clear with this method

1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:06.880
 and looked at somebody through it.

1:38:06.880 --> 1:38:08.760
 And although you don't want to get it too close to your eye,

1:38:08.760 --> 1:38:10.240
 you don't want to touch it to your own eye.

1:38:10.240 --> 1:38:13.440
 But, and you can see direct all the way through it.

1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:18.180
 That's incredible for the,

1:38:18.180 --> 1:38:19.700
 it raises an important question,

1:38:19.700 --> 1:38:22.160
 which is again about the human brain.

1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:23.880
 I mean, as somebody who essentially started out

1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:26.440
 in neuroanatomy and then got into other things,

1:38:26.440 --> 1:38:31.320
 I always am bothered by the fact

1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:32.880
 that we actually know very little

1:38:32.880 --> 1:38:35.760
 about the microstructure of the human brain

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:38.580
 compared to the brains of other organisms.

1:38:38.580 --> 1:38:41.400
 And in thinking about understanding the circuitry

1:38:41.400 --> 1:38:43.600
 and the piano, so to speak,

1:38:43.600 --> 1:38:47.660
 and how to manipulate it in order to relieve suffering,

1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:53.480
 one wonders are the structures in these animal brains

1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:56.720
 and how they behave in active coping,

1:38:56.720 --> 1:39:00.000
 passive coping, ADD, et cetera, those models,

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:03.900
 how well they translate to the human condition.

1:39:03.900 --> 1:39:06.600
 Do you think it's fair to say that there are entire regions

1:39:06.600 --> 1:39:09.440
 of the human brain that aren't just bigger,

1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:12.500
 but that exist only in the brains of humans,

1:39:12.500 --> 1:39:14.840
 especially given that we have this speech,

1:39:14.840 --> 1:39:17.000
 although I do wonder sometimes if, you know,

1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.940
 animals are reporting to each other there,

1:39:18.940 --> 1:39:20.780
 maybe they have little psychiatric sessions

1:39:20.780 --> 1:39:22.280
 with one another.

1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:23.900
 You know, I'm always careful

1:39:23.900 --> 1:39:26.980
 to not assume we do things better.

1:39:26.980 --> 1:39:29.460
 We certainly understand what we're doing better

1:39:29.460 --> 1:39:31.000
 than we understand what animals are doing,

1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:33.980
 and they certainly do things better than we do.

1:39:33.980 --> 1:39:36.800
 That said, we do have amazing, wonderful brains

1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:39.420
 and many structures that are very highly developed

1:39:39.420 --> 1:39:42.300
 in our brains that are not nearly so developed

1:39:42.300 --> 1:39:45.440
 in mice and fish, for example.

1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:49.220
 Now, that said, when I look at the big picture,

1:39:49.220 --> 1:39:52.880
 you know, what is the mammalian brain really doing?

1:39:54.540 --> 1:39:57.020
 There are things that you would never have thought

1:39:57.020 --> 1:40:00.540
 we could study in animals, in laboratory,

1:40:00.540 --> 1:40:05.540
 in mammals like mice that it turns out you can, actually.

1:40:05.780 --> 1:40:08.140
 And so I would never draw the line and say,

1:40:08.140 --> 1:40:10.100
 here's something you can't study in mice,

1:40:10.100 --> 1:40:12.740
 or here's something that has no parallel in mice.

1:40:12.740 --> 1:40:14.540
 I would be very careful before making

1:40:14.540 --> 1:40:17.140
 any statement like that.

1:40:17.140 --> 1:40:19.040
 A good example of that is we've been able to study

1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:20.900
 just in the past year come to an understanding

1:40:20.900 --> 1:40:25.060
 of dissociation, and we had a paper that came out

1:40:25.060 --> 1:40:28.660
 in late 2020, both mouse and human work,

1:40:28.660 --> 1:40:32.400
 in which we got to sort of the circuit basis

1:40:32.400 --> 1:40:34.100
 for dissociation.

1:40:34.100 --> 1:40:35.540
 Now, what is dissociation?

1:40:35.540 --> 1:40:38.760
 A lot of people might not have experienced it,

1:40:38.760 --> 1:40:40.500
 but it's actually very common.

1:40:40.500 --> 1:40:44.260
 More than 70% of people who've been through trauma

1:40:44.260 --> 1:40:45.820
 experience dissociation.

1:40:45.820 --> 1:40:47.840
 It shows up in borderline personality.

1:40:47.840 --> 1:40:49.700
 It shows up in PTSD.

1:40:49.700 --> 1:40:53.580
 What it is is it's a separation of the sense of self

1:40:53.580 --> 1:40:55.980
 from the body, and so you can have someone who,

1:40:55.980 --> 1:40:58.500
 it's not as if you're numb, you're not anesthetized.

1:40:58.500 --> 1:41:00.820
 You can still, you know that something's happening

1:41:00.820 --> 1:41:03.260
 to the body, but you just don't care

1:41:03.260 --> 1:41:05.980
 because you don't ascribe it to yourself,

1:41:05.980 --> 1:41:07.740
 which is very interesting, right?

1:41:07.740 --> 1:41:09.100
 That is, how interesting is that?

1:41:09.100 --> 1:41:10.420
 The self-report narrative.

1:41:10.420 --> 1:41:11.260
 Yeah, yeah.

1:41:11.260 --> 1:41:13.560
 Almost in your book, you touch on this,

1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:18.560
 and I will say is the most precise and meaningful

1:41:18.740 --> 1:41:21.740
 and eloquent description of what might be consciousness,

1:41:21.740 --> 1:41:25.300
 this narrative toward the self or of the self

1:41:25.300 --> 1:41:26.380
 and where it might reside.

1:41:26.380 --> 1:41:29.480
 So in dissociative conditions,

1:41:29.480 --> 1:41:32.760
 people are feeling as kind of an absence of a merge

1:41:32.760 --> 1:41:34.020
 between mind and body.

1:41:34.020 --> 1:41:35.420
 Is that one way to describe it?

1:41:35.420 --> 1:41:37.520
 And as I recall, this paper involved

1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:39.300
 an exploration of ketamine.

1:41:39.300 --> 1:41:40.940
 Ketamine was a big part of it, yeah, that's right.

1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:43.000
 And so ketamine is another one of those cases

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:45.500
 where people can experience dissociation.

1:41:45.500 --> 1:41:48.880
 Ketamine or PCP, we call these the dissociative drugs.

1:41:48.880 --> 1:41:51.240
 They cause it just like these other

1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:53.540
 psychiatric conditions can cause it.

1:41:55.300 --> 1:41:59.300
 But we were able to manifest this in mice,

1:41:59.300 --> 1:42:02.100
 administering these dissociative agents in mice.

1:42:02.100 --> 1:42:04.580
 We could make them still able to detect stimulus

1:42:04.580 --> 1:42:07.140
 but not care that it was happening.

1:42:07.140 --> 1:42:11.380
 All the while, we were recording the activity

1:42:11.380 --> 1:42:14.380
 of individual cells in the brain to see what was going on,

1:42:14.380 --> 1:42:18.060
 what was happening along with this dissociation

1:42:18.060 --> 1:42:20.540
 and then use optogenetics to see that it mattered

1:42:20.540 --> 1:42:23.380
 to actually provide that pattern of activity

1:42:23.380 --> 1:42:26.580
 and see, oh, that actually causes the dissociation.

1:42:26.580 --> 1:42:28.900
 So we could do all that in mice,

1:42:28.900 --> 1:42:32.860
 which was just a, who would have thought

1:42:32.860 --> 1:42:34.660
 that you could study something like this in mice?

1:42:34.660 --> 1:42:38.340
 And we were able to go back and forth with human work

1:42:38.340 --> 1:42:41.940
 because here in our Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center,

1:42:41.940 --> 1:42:45.300
 there are a lot of what we call stereo EEG recording.

1:42:45.300 --> 1:42:46.180
 Patients who come in

1:42:46.180 --> 1:42:48.580
 and in the course of normal clinical care,

1:42:48.580 --> 1:42:51.540
 they have electrodes recording in their brain

1:42:51.540 --> 1:42:53.420
 to identify where the seizure is

1:42:53.420 --> 1:42:56.700
 so they can be candidates for removing

1:42:56.700 --> 1:42:58.700
 a little patch of the brain that's causing the seizure.

1:42:58.700 --> 1:43:00.780
 This is done for patients who medications

1:43:00.780 --> 1:43:03.560
 are not helping their seizure disorder.

1:43:03.560 --> 1:43:08.160
 And there was a patient who had a dissociative state

1:43:08.160 --> 1:43:09.340
 before every seizure.

1:43:09.340 --> 1:43:11.460
 So this was a human being who was really dissociating,

1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:13.620
 who could tell us literally as it was happening.

1:43:13.620 --> 1:43:15.980
 And we could see this pattern,

1:43:15.980 --> 1:43:18.300
 the same pattern that was happening in the mice

1:43:18.300 --> 1:43:20.780
 in the same patch of the brain,

1:43:20.780 --> 1:43:22.700
 we could see that happening in the human being

1:43:22.700 --> 1:43:25.260
 at exactly the right time in the same patch of the brain

1:43:25.260 --> 1:43:27.060
 that's homologous across these

1:43:27.060 --> 1:43:29.580
 immense evolutionary distances.

1:43:29.580 --> 1:43:31.960
 And we knew that it mattered too, both in mouse and human,

1:43:31.960 --> 1:43:34.540
 because in the human, we could cause it to happen.

1:43:34.540 --> 1:43:35.380
 So that-

1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:38.420
 I want to underscore the power of not just that,

1:43:38.420 --> 1:43:41.140
 I want to underscore the power of optogenetics

1:43:41.140 --> 1:43:45.500
 and the ability to not just remove a particular experience

1:43:45.500 --> 1:43:47.380
 or behavior by lesioning or destroying,

1:43:47.380 --> 1:43:51.020
 but then to go back and actually activate

1:43:51.020 --> 1:43:52.740
 the same structure or group of structures

1:43:52.740 --> 1:43:54.100
 and see the emergence.

1:43:54.100 --> 1:43:56.620
 So it's essentially, these days you hear a lot

1:43:56.620 --> 1:43:57.940
 about gain-of-function research

1:43:57.940 --> 1:43:59.540
 in the context of viral manipulation,

1:43:59.540 --> 1:44:00.660
 but gain-of-function is something

1:44:00.660 --> 1:44:04.580
 that we do in the laboratory and you do in patients

1:44:04.580 --> 1:44:07.740
 to both take away something and put it back,

1:44:07.740 --> 1:44:09.140
 which gives you causality.

1:44:09.140 --> 1:44:09.980
 That's right.

1:44:09.980 --> 1:44:11.060
 Yeah, and so, exactly.

1:44:11.060 --> 1:44:14.140
 And so with optogenetics, we were able to provide

1:44:14.140 --> 1:44:18.100
 in animals without being on any ketamine or any drug,

1:44:18.100 --> 1:44:19.620
 and we could cause the dissociative state

1:44:19.620 --> 1:44:22.220
 by playing in a precise pattern of activity.

1:44:22.220 --> 1:44:23.660
 And that, who would have thought you could do that?

1:44:23.660 --> 1:44:26.300
 But there was a combined mouse and human paper.

1:44:26.300 --> 1:44:31.300
 Likewise, we've been able to play in visual sensations

1:44:31.300 --> 1:44:36.300
 into the brains of mice, and by observing

1:44:37.300 --> 1:44:39.740
 which cells in the visual part of the brain,

1:44:39.740 --> 1:44:43.020
 visual cortex, are naturally responsive to,

1:44:43.020 --> 1:44:46.020
 for example, vertical bars instead of horizontal bars

1:44:46.020 --> 1:44:48.620
 in the visual world, we could see which cells

1:44:48.620 --> 1:44:51.200
 were normally reporting on vertical bars,

1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:52.580
 and then we could use optogenetics

1:44:52.580 --> 1:44:56.420
 to come and play in activity just to those cells.

1:44:56.420 --> 1:44:58.140
 So these animals are not viewing anything.

1:44:58.140 --> 1:44:59.340
 Not viewing anything at all,

1:44:59.340 --> 1:45:02.500
 and we could activate just the vertical bar cells,

1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:04.120
 and not only did the animal act

1:45:04.120 --> 1:45:06.420
 as if it was seeing a vertical bar behaviorally,

1:45:06.420 --> 1:45:07.780
 it was trained to do a particular thing

1:45:07.780 --> 1:45:09.700
 if it saw a vertical bar, and it did that

1:45:09.700 --> 1:45:12.660
 just as if it was seeing something visually.

1:45:12.660 --> 1:45:14.740
 But everything in the brain that we were recording too,

1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:18.560
 the internal representation of this external world

1:45:18.560 --> 1:45:19.860
 was naturalistic too.

1:45:19.860 --> 1:45:23.100
 It looked like the brain was seeing something visual.

1:45:23.100 --> 1:45:26.220
 So that's gain of function too,

1:45:26.220 --> 1:45:29.560
 playing in, providing a complex sensation,

1:45:29.560 --> 1:45:31.460
 our percept that wasn't there before,

1:45:31.460 --> 1:45:34.480
 and we can do that across species.

1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:37.180
 So we haven't, you know, and of course,

1:45:37.180 --> 1:45:40.460
 mice are social, and they do amazing acts

1:45:40.460 --> 1:45:43.900
 of information processing, and so I don't,

1:45:43.900 --> 1:45:46.780
 I try not to disparage our cousins too much.

1:45:46.780 --> 1:45:48.600
 They certainly have helped the field of neuroscience

1:45:48.600 --> 1:45:50.040
 and medicine, I should mention,

1:45:50.040 --> 1:45:51.860
 and I know that people have various sensitivities

1:45:51.860 --> 1:45:55.140
 about animal research, but the work that's been carried out

1:45:55.140 --> 1:45:58.980
 in mice has been absolutely vital

1:45:58.980 --> 1:46:02.700
 and instructional for treatment of human disease.

1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:07.000
 Since we talked about dissociation

1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:10.480
 and dissociative states, rather, and ketamine,

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:14.900
 I'd love your thoughts on psychedelic medicine.

1:46:14.900 --> 1:46:17.600
 You know, I sort of half joke,

1:46:17.600 --> 1:46:19.760
 having grown up in this area in Northern California

1:46:19.760 --> 1:46:22.300
 when it was much more counterculture than it is now,

1:46:22.300 --> 1:46:26.100
 that many of the things that we're hearing about now,

1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:30.520
 at least from my read of the history books,

1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:31.680
 happened before.

1:46:31.680 --> 1:46:34.440
 There was a movement aimed at taking

1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:36.780
 the very same compounds, essentially,

1:46:36.780 --> 1:46:37.860
 putting them into patients,

1:46:37.860 --> 1:46:41.100
 or people were obviously using them recreationally,

1:46:41.100 --> 1:46:42.700
 but putting them into patients

1:46:42.700 --> 1:46:44.900
 and seeing tremendous positive effects,

1:46:44.900 --> 1:46:49.900
 but also tremendous examples of induced psychiatric illness.

1:46:49.900 --> 1:46:52.420
 In other words, many people lost their minds

1:46:52.420 --> 1:46:54.740
 as a consequence of overuse of psychedelics.

1:46:54.740 --> 1:46:57.740
 I'll probably lose a few people out there,

1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:02.140
 but I do want to talk about

1:47:02.140 --> 1:47:04.300
 what is the state of these compounds?

1:47:04.300 --> 1:47:06.420
 And I realize it's a huge category of compounds,

1:47:06.420 --> 1:47:08.500
 but LSD and psilocybin, as I understand,

1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:11.420
 trigger activation of particular serotonin receptor

1:47:11.420 --> 1:47:15.260
 mechanisms may or may not lead to more widespread activation

1:47:15.260 --> 1:47:18.300
 of the brain that one wouldn't see otherwise.

1:47:18.300 --> 1:47:20.340
 But when you look at the clinical and experimental

1:47:20.340 --> 1:47:23.860
 literature, what is your sort of top contour sense

1:47:23.860 --> 1:47:26.140
 of how effective these tools are going to be

1:47:26.140 --> 1:47:27.700
 for treating depression?

1:47:27.700 --> 1:47:29.100
 And then if we have the time,

1:47:29.100 --> 1:47:32.620
 we could talk about trauma and MDMA and some of that work.

1:47:32.620 --> 1:47:36.180
 Well, you're right to highlight both the opportunity

1:47:36.180 --> 1:47:38.740
 and the peril that is there.

1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:41.780
 And of course, we want to help patients,

1:47:41.780 --> 1:47:45.260
 and of course, we want to explore anything

1:47:45.260 --> 1:47:48.500
 that might be helpful, but we want to do it in a safe

1:47:48.500 --> 1:47:50.420
 and rigorous way.

1:47:50.420 --> 1:47:53.540
 But I do think we should explore these avenues.

1:47:53.540 --> 1:47:57.120
 These are agents that alter reality

1:47:57.120 --> 1:48:00.180
 and alter the experience of reality, I should say,

1:48:00.180 --> 1:48:02.420
 in relatively precise ways.

1:48:02.420 --> 1:48:05.140
 They do have problems, they can be addictive,

1:48:05.140 --> 1:48:08.600
 they can cause lasting change that is not desirable.

1:48:10.260 --> 1:48:12.340
 But we have to see these as opportunities.

1:48:12.340 --> 1:48:15.500
 We have to, first of all, study in the laboratory,

1:48:15.500 --> 1:48:17.940
 and I'm doing this here.

1:48:17.940 --> 1:48:22.940
 We have big, we have safes with many interesting psychedelics

1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:24.780
 that are all very carefully regulated.

1:48:24.780 --> 1:48:27.220
 We get inspections from the DEA and so on.

1:48:27.220 --> 1:48:28.540
 If anyone's hoping to find these labs,

1:48:28.540 --> 1:48:31.660
 they exist in outer space, so you need to be on board

1:48:31.660 --> 1:48:35.060
 one of the SpaceX missions in order to access them,

1:48:35.060 --> 1:48:36.140
 so don't try and come find them.

1:48:36.140 --> 1:48:37.940
 Yeah, no, that's exactly true, yes.

1:48:40.740 --> 1:48:42.300
 And we're doing exactly this.

1:48:42.300 --> 1:48:43.780
 We're saying this is an incredible opportunity.

1:48:43.780 --> 1:48:48.300
 If we could understand how the perception of reality

1:48:48.300 --> 1:48:52.040
 is altered, we could create new kinds of intervention

1:48:52.040 --> 1:48:56.820
 that don't have the risks and the problems

1:48:56.820 --> 1:49:00.180
 of causing lasting change or addiction.

1:49:00.180 --> 1:49:05.180
 Now, that said, even as these medications exist now,

1:49:06.180 --> 1:49:09.220
 as you know, there's an impulse to use them

1:49:09.220 --> 1:49:10.940
 in very small doses and to use them

1:49:10.940 --> 1:49:15.100
 as adjunctive treatments for the therapy of various kinds,

1:49:15.100 --> 1:49:16.780
 and I'm also supportive of that

1:49:16.780 --> 1:49:19.940
 if done carefully and rigorously.

1:49:19.940 --> 1:49:21.580
 Of course, there's risk, but there is risk

1:49:21.580 --> 1:49:23.900
 with many other kinds of treatment,

1:49:23.900 --> 1:49:28.900
 and I'm not sure that the risks for these medications

1:49:29.140 --> 1:49:31.380
 vastly outweigh the risks that we normally tolerate

1:49:31.380 --> 1:49:32.820
 in other branches of medicine.

1:49:32.820 --> 1:49:34.380
 Why would they work?

1:49:34.380 --> 1:49:39.380
 I mean, let's say that indeed their main effect is to create

1:49:41.940 --> 1:49:46.940
 more connectivity, at least in the moment,

1:49:47.400 --> 1:49:48.240
 between brain areas.

1:49:48.240 --> 1:49:50.820
 So the way I think about a very,

1:49:50.820 --> 1:49:53.660
 I think about the two extremes of my experience anyway

1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:57.320
 is a high degree of stress and focus, for whatever reason,

1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:59.780
 is going to create changes in my visual field

1:49:59.780 --> 1:50:02.160
 and changes in the way that I perceive time

1:50:02.160 --> 1:50:03.900
 so that I'm going to micro-slice time.

1:50:03.900 --> 1:50:07.300
 I'm in a very contracted view of whatever my experience is,

1:50:07.300 --> 1:50:09.440
 whereas on the opposite extreme,

1:50:09.440 --> 1:50:13.420
 in a dream or in sleep, space and time are very fluid,

1:50:13.420 --> 1:50:15.180
 and I'm essentially relaxed,

1:50:15.180 --> 1:50:16.980
 although it might be a very interesting dream,

1:50:16.980 --> 1:50:18.580
 it might not be.

1:50:18.580 --> 1:50:21.680
 Psychedelics seem to be a trajectory,

1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:25.360
 I'm not too far off from the dream state

1:50:25.360 --> 1:50:29.900
 where space and time are essentially not as rigid,

1:50:29.900 --> 1:50:32.140
 and there is this element of synesthesia,

1:50:32.140 --> 1:50:34.620
 of blending of the senses, you know,

1:50:34.620 --> 1:50:39.620
 feeling colors and hearing light and things of that sort.

1:50:40.620 --> 1:50:42.380
 You hear these reports anyway.

1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:46.540
 Why would having that dreamlike experience

1:50:47.940 --> 1:50:51.580
 somehow relieve depression long-term?

1:50:51.580 --> 1:50:53.960
 Do we have any idea why that might be?

1:50:55.980 --> 1:50:59.580
 We have some ideas and no deep understanding.

1:50:59.580 --> 1:51:02.100
 One way I think about the psychedelics

1:51:02.100 --> 1:51:07.100
 is they increase the willingness of our brain

1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:13.340
 to accept unlikely ways of constructing the world,

1:51:13.340 --> 1:51:16.420
 unlikely hypotheses, as it were, as to what's going on.

1:51:16.420 --> 1:51:18.640
 The brain, in particular our cortex, I think,

1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:21.820
 is a hypothesis generation and testing machine.

1:51:21.820 --> 1:51:23.820
 It's coming up with models about everything.

1:51:23.820 --> 1:51:26.900
 It's got a lot of bits of data coming in,

1:51:26.900 --> 1:51:29.420
 and it's making models and updating the models

1:51:29.420 --> 1:51:32.620
 and changing them theories, hypotheses for what's going on.

1:51:33.540 --> 1:51:36.020
 And some of those never reach our conscious mind,

1:51:36.020 --> 1:51:38.340
 and this is something I talk about in projections

1:51:38.340 --> 1:51:42.300
 in the book quite a bit, is many of these are filtered out

1:51:42.300 --> 1:51:45.140
 before they get to our conscious mind, and that's good.

1:51:45.140 --> 1:51:47.420
 We think how distracted we'd be

1:51:47.420 --> 1:51:49.340
 if we were constantly having to evaluate

1:51:49.340 --> 1:51:52.420
 all these hypotheses about what kinds of shapes

1:51:52.420 --> 1:51:54.820
 or objects or processes were out there.

1:51:54.820 --> 1:51:56.420
 And so a lot of this is handled

1:51:57.380 --> 1:51:59.020
 before it gets to consciousness.

1:51:59.020 --> 1:52:00.780
 What the psychedelics seem to do

1:52:00.780 --> 1:52:05.260
 is they change the threshold for us

1:52:05.260 --> 1:52:08.340
 to become aware of these incomplete hypotheses

1:52:08.340 --> 1:52:13.160
 or wrong hypotheses or concepts that might be noise

1:52:13.160 --> 1:52:15.260
 but are just wrong and so are never allowed

1:52:15.260 --> 1:52:17.060
 to get into our conscious mind.

1:52:17.900 --> 1:52:20.900
 Now, that's pretty interesting,

1:52:20.900 --> 1:52:23.260
 and it goes wrong in psychiatric disorders.

1:52:23.260 --> 1:52:28.260
 I think in schizophrenia, sometimes the paranoid delusions

1:52:28.260 --> 1:52:33.260
 that people have are examples of these poor models

1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:35.100
 that escape into the conscious mind

1:52:35.100 --> 1:52:37.380
 and become accepted as reality,

1:52:37.380 --> 1:52:40.340
 and they never should have gotten out there.

1:52:40.340 --> 1:52:43.180
 Now, how could something like this in the right way

1:52:43.180 --> 1:52:45.340
 help with something like depression?

1:52:45.340 --> 1:52:49.940
 Patients with depression often are stuck.

1:52:49.940 --> 1:52:54.940
 They can't look into the future world of possibilities

1:52:54.940 --> 1:52:56.820
 as effectively.

1:52:56.820 --> 1:53:01.820
 Everything seems hopeless, and what does that really mean?

1:53:02.580 --> 1:53:05.820
 They discount the value of their own action.

1:53:05.820 --> 1:53:08.340
 They discount the value of the world

1:53:08.340 --> 1:53:10.860
 at giving rise to a future that matters.

1:53:10.860 --> 1:53:13.020
 Everything seems to run out like a river

1:53:13.020 --> 1:53:15.700
 just running out into a desert and drying up.

1:53:15.700 --> 1:53:19.980
 And what these agents may do

1:53:19.980 --> 1:53:22.940
 that increase the flow through circuitry

1:53:22.940 --> 1:53:27.420
 if you will, the percolation of activity through circuitry

1:53:27.420 --> 1:53:29.300
 may end up doing for depression

1:53:29.300 --> 1:53:34.300
 is increasing the escape of some tendrils of process,

1:53:35.020 --> 1:53:37.900
 of forward progression through the world.

1:53:38.900 --> 1:53:39.960
 That's a concept.

1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:41.640
 It's how I think about it.

1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:43.440
 There are ways we can make that rigorous.

1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:47.060
 We can indeed identify in the brain by recording.

1:53:47.060 --> 1:53:50.780
 We can see cells that represent steps along a path

1:53:50.780 --> 1:53:54.160
 and look into the future,

1:53:54.160 --> 1:53:56.540
 and we can rigorously define these cells,

1:53:56.540 --> 1:53:59.260
 and we can see if these are altered on psychedelics.

1:53:59.260 --> 1:54:00.500
 And so that's one of the reasons

1:54:00.500 --> 1:54:04.020
 that we're working with these agents in the laboratory

1:54:04.020 --> 1:54:05.860
 to say, is this really the case?

1:54:05.860 --> 1:54:08.820
 Are these opening up new paths

1:54:08.820 --> 1:54:11.920
 or representations of paths into the future?

1:54:13.780 --> 1:54:17.420
 MDMA, ecstasy, is a unique compound

1:54:17.420 --> 1:54:21.940
 in that it leads to big increases in brain levels

1:54:21.940 --> 1:54:24.660
 of dopamine and serotonin simultaneously.

1:54:24.660 --> 1:54:26.740
 And I realized that the neuromodulators

1:54:26.740 --> 1:54:29.340
 like dopamine and serotonin often work in concert,

1:54:29.340 --> 1:54:31.580
 not alone, the way they're commonly described

1:54:31.580 --> 1:54:35.420
 in the more general popular discussions.

1:54:35.420 --> 1:54:38.880
 However, it is a unique compound,

1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:41.060
 and it's different than the serotonergic compounds

1:54:41.060 --> 1:54:43.420
 like LSD and psilocybin.

1:54:43.420 --> 1:54:48.120
 And there are now data still emerging

1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:52.600
 that it might be, and in some cases can be useful

1:54:52.600 --> 1:54:56.460
 for the treatment of trauma, PTSD and similar things.

1:54:56.460 --> 1:54:59.260
 Why would that work?

1:54:59.260 --> 1:55:01.920
 And a larger question,

1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:04.060
 perhaps the more important question is,

1:55:04.060 --> 1:55:08.460
 psychedelics, MDMA, LSD, all those compounds,

1:55:08.460 --> 1:55:10.100
 in my mind, there are two components.

1:55:10.100 --> 1:55:12.780
 There's the experience you have while you're on them,

1:55:12.780 --> 1:55:15.220
 and then there's the effect they have after.

1:55:16.340 --> 1:55:18.900
 People are generating variations of these compounds

1:55:18.900 --> 1:55:21.980
 that are non-hallucinatory variations,

1:55:21.980 --> 1:55:25.940
 but how crucial do you think it is to have,

1:55:25.940 --> 1:55:30.820
 let's stay with MDMA, the experience of huge levels

1:55:30.820 --> 1:55:33.460
 of dopamine, huge levels of serotonin,

1:55:33.460 --> 1:55:35.780
 atypical levels of dopamine and serotonin released,

1:55:35.780 --> 1:55:38.020
 having this highly abnormal experience

1:55:38.020 --> 1:55:39.620
 in order to be normal again?

1:55:39.620 --> 1:55:43.020
 Yeah, I think the brain learns from those experiences.

1:55:43.020 --> 1:55:44.460
 That's the way I see it.

1:55:44.460 --> 1:55:48.440
 And so, for example, people who've taken MDMA,

1:55:48.440 --> 1:55:51.660
 they will, as you say, they'll be the acute phase

1:55:51.660 --> 1:55:55.820
 of being on the drug and experiencing

1:55:55.820 --> 1:55:59.420
 this extreme connectedness with other people, for example.

1:55:59.420 --> 1:56:02.980
 And then the drug wears off,

1:56:04.020 --> 1:56:06.140
 but the brain learned from that experience.

1:56:06.140 --> 1:56:09.220
 And so what people will report is,

1:56:09.220 --> 1:56:12.640
 yeah, I'm not in that state, but I saw what was possible.

1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:17.460
 I saw, yeah, you can, there don't need to be barriers,

1:56:17.460 --> 1:56:19.760
 or at least not as many barriers as I thought.

1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:23.980
 I can connect with more people in a way that is helpful.

1:56:23.980 --> 1:56:26.980
 And so I think it's the learning that happens

1:56:26.980 --> 1:56:29.500
 in that state that actually matters.

1:56:29.500 --> 1:56:31.740
 And as you described that, that sounds a lot like

1:56:31.740 --> 1:56:33.580
 what I understand to be the hallmark feature

1:56:33.580 --> 1:56:35.260
 of really good psychoanalysis,

1:56:35.260 --> 1:56:38.620
 that the relationship between patient and therapist

1:56:38.620 --> 1:56:43.140
 hopefully evolves to the point where these kinds of tests

1:56:43.140 --> 1:56:45.820
 can be run within the context of that relationship

1:56:45.820 --> 1:56:47.860
 and then exported to other relationships.

1:56:47.860 --> 1:56:48.700
 Is that-

1:56:48.700 --> 1:56:49.520
 Exactly right, yeah.

1:56:49.520 --> 1:56:51.260
 And that probably, I'm assuming,

1:56:51.260 --> 1:56:53.840
 is still the goal of really good psychiatry also.

1:56:53.840 --> 1:56:55.180
 It's a part of-

1:56:55.180 --> 1:56:56.700
 Intimacy, really.

1:56:56.700 --> 1:56:59.820
 It should be, when we have time,

1:56:59.820 --> 1:57:02.320
 I think all good psychiatrists try to achieve

1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:05.600
 that level of connection and learning,

1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:10.600
 try to help patients create a new model that is stable,

1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:12.120
 that is learned,

1:57:12.120 --> 1:57:16.140
 and that can help instruct future behavior.

1:57:16.140 --> 1:57:19.600
 One of the things that I took from reading your book,

1:57:19.600 --> 1:57:22.140
 in addition to learning so much science

1:57:22.140 --> 1:57:24.520
 and the future of psychiatry and brain science,

1:57:24.520 --> 1:57:28.980
 was amidst these, in many cases,

1:57:28.980 --> 1:57:31.500
 very tragic cases and sadness,

1:57:31.500 --> 1:57:35.180
 and a lot of the weight that that puts on the clinician,

1:57:35.180 --> 1:57:36.800
 on you also,

1:57:36.800 --> 1:57:41.580
 that there's a central cord of optimism,

1:57:41.580 --> 1:57:45.860
 that where we're headed is not just possible,

1:57:45.860 --> 1:57:48.880
 but very likely and better.

1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:53.260
 And, you know, are you an optimist?

1:57:53.260 --> 1:57:54.100
 I am.

1:57:54.100 --> 1:57:54.940
 And this is, by the way,

1:57:54.940 --> 1:57:56.560
 this was a really interesting experience

1:57:56.560 --> 1:58:00.820
 in writing projections because I had a dual goal.

1:58:00.820 --> 1:58:02.740
 I wanted it to be for everybody,

1:58:02.740 --> 1:58:07.740
 literally everybody in the world who wants to read it.

1:58:08.380 --> 1:58:09.900
 And yet at the same time,

1:58:09.900 --> 1:58:14.900
 I wanted to stay absolutely rigorously close to the science,

1:58:16.600 --> 1:58:17.860
 what was actually known.

1:58:18.860 --> 1:58:20.720
 When I was speaking about science,

1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:24.260
 when I was speaking about the neurobiology of the brain

1:58:24.260 --> 1:58:25.300
 or psychiatry,

1:58:25.300 --> 1:58:30.300
 I wanted to not have any of my scientific colleagues think,

1:58:30.400 --> 1:58:32.300
 oh, he's going too far.

1:58:32.300 --> 1:58:33.140
 He's saying too much.

1:58:33.140 --> 1:58:34.940
 And so I had these two goals,

1:58:34.940 --> 1:58:37.060
 which I kept in my mind the entire time.

1:58:37.060 --> 1:58:38.020
 And a lot of this,

1:58:38.020 --> 1:58:40.340
 trying to find exactly the right word we talked about

1:58:40.340 --> 1:58:44.500
 was on this path of staying excruciatingly rigorous

1:58:44.500 --> 1:58:45.340
 in the science,

1:58:45.340 --> 1:58:49.700
 and yet letting people see the hope where things were,

1:58:49.700 --> 1:58:52.100
 have everybody see that we've come a long way.

1:58:52.100 --> 1:58:54.180
 We have a long way to go,

1:58:54.180 --> 1:58:58.380
 but the trajectory and the path is beautiful.

1:58:58.380 --> 1:59:01.140
 And so that was the goal.

1:59:01.140 --> 1:59:06.140
 I think, of course, that sounds almost impossible

1:59:06.480 --> 1:59:10.620
 to jointly satisfy those two goals,

1:59:10.620 --> 1:59:12.920
 but I kept that in my mind the whole way through.

1:59:12.920 --> 1:59:14.500
 And yes, I am optimistic.

1:59:14.500 --> 1:59:16.300
 And I hope that came through in the book.

1:59:16.300 --> 1:59:17.300
 But it certainly did.

1:59:17.300 --> 1:59:18.900
 And at least from this colleague,

1:59:20.260 --> 1:59:22.660
 you did achieve both.

1:59:22.660 --> 1:59:24.580
 And it's a wonderful,

1:59:24.580 --> 1:59:26.480
 it's a masterful book really.

1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:28.340
 And one that as a scientist

1:59:28.340 --> 1:59:32.580
 and somebody who is a fellow brain explorer

1:59:32.580 --> 1:59:36.460
 hits all the marks of rigor and is incredibly interesting.

1:59:36.460 --> 1:59:37.820
 And there's a ton of storytelling.

1:59:37.820 --> 1:59:39.280
 I don't want to give away too much about it,

1:59:39.280 --> 1:59:41.620
 but people should definitely check out the book.

1:59:42.620 --> 1:59:44.220
 Are you active on social media

1:59:44.220 --> 1:59:45.780
 if people want to follow you

1:59:45.780 --> 1:59:48.620
 and connect with what you're doing now and going forward?

1:59:48.620 --> 1:59:50.140
 Yeah, I have a Twitter.

1:59:50.140 --> 1:59:54.180
 That's where I mainly do exchange,

1:59:54.180 --> 1:59:56.300
 tell people about things that are happening.

1:59:56.300 --> 1:59:57.220
 We'll provide a link to it,

1:59:57.220 --> 1:59:59.300
 but that's Karl Deisseroth as I recall with a K.

1:59:59.300 --> 2:00:00.260
 That's right. Yeah.

2:00:00.260 --> 2:00:01.100
 That's right.

2:00:01.100 --> 2:00:04.460
 And so you're on Twitter and people will hear this.

2:00:04.460 --> 2:00:06.580
 Definitely check out the book.

2:00:07.580 --> 2:00:09.060
 There are other people in our community

2:00:09.060 --> 2:00:13.220
 that of course are going to be reaching out on your behalf,

2:00:13.220 --> 2:00:15.880
 but it's incredible that you juggle

2:00:15.880 --> 2:00:17.780
 this enormous number of things.

2:00:19.100 --> 2:00:22.060
 Perhaps even more important, however,

2:00:22.060 --> 2:00:23.420
 is that it's all in service

2:00:23.420 --> 2:00:25.860
 to this larger thing of relieving suffering.

2:00:25.860 --> 2:00:28.320
 So thank you so much for your time today,

2:00:28.320 --> 2:00:30.560
 for the book and the work that went into the book,

2:00:30.560 --> 2:00:31.780
 I can't even imagine,

2:00:31.780 --> 2:00:33.880
 for the laboratory work and the development channel ops

2:00:33.880 --> 2:00:35.740
 and clarity and all the related technologies

2:00:35.740 --> 2:00:37.700
 and for the clinical work you're doing

2:00:37.700 --> 2:00:39.060
 and for sharing with us.

2:00:39.060 --> 2:00:41.620
 Well, thank you for all you're doing and reaching out.

2:00:41.620 --> 2:00:43.740
 I'm very impressed by it.

2:00:43.740 --> 2:00:46.260
 It's important and it's so valuable.
