00:00.000 --> 00:02.240
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.240 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.460 --> 00:12.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:12.160 --> 00:15.280
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.280 --> 00:17.740
 My guest today is Dr. David Buss.

00:17.740 --> 00:19.800
 Dr. Buss is a professor of psychology

00:19.800 --> 00:21.760
 at the University of Texas, Austin,

00:21.760 --> 00:24.080
 and he is one of the founding members and luminaries

00:24.080 --> 00:26.800
 in the field of evolutionary psychology.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.160
 Dr. Buss's laboratory is responsible

00:29.160 --> 00:32.400
 for understanding the strategies that humans use

00:32.400 --> 00:35.480
 to select mates in the short and long term.

00:35.480 --> 00:39.520
 And he is an expert in sex differences in mating strategy.

00:39.520 --> 00:41.600
 His laboratory has explored, for instance,

00:41.600 --> 00:45.780
 why women cheat on their spouses or their long-term partners

00:45.780 --> 00:48.360
 as well as why men tend to cheat on their spouses

00:48.360 --> 00:50.160
 and long-term partners.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.720
 He's also explored a number of things related

00:52.720 --> 00:55.440
 to the courtship dance that we call dating

00:55.440 --> 00:57.260
 and securing a mate,

00:57.260 --> 00:59.600
 including the use of deception related

00:59.600 --> 01:03.080
 to proclamations of love or promises of finances

01:03.080 --> 01:04.360
 or sexual activity.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.720
 Dr. Buss's laboratory has also evaluated

01:06.720 --> 01:08.560
 how status is assessed,

01:08.560 --> 01:11.540
 meaning how we evaluate our own worth

01:11.540 --> 01:13.480
 and our potential as a mate,

01:13.480 --> 01:16.800
 and who is, let's just say, within range

01:16.800 --> 01:20.000
 of a potential mate, both in the short and long term.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.880
 For instance, today we talk about

01:21.880 --> 01:24.840
 how people don't just make direct assessments

01:24.840 --> 01:26.840
 of their own and other people's value

01:26.840 --> 01:27.960
 as a potential mate,

01:27.960 --> 01:30.260
 but also using the assessments of others

01:30.260 --> 01:32.000
 to indirectly determine whether

01:32.000 --> 01:34.120
 or not they stand a chance or not

01:34.120 --> 01:37.160
 in securing somebody as a short or long-term mate.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.400
 His laboratory has also focused on some

01:39.400 --> 01:41.760
 of the complicated and varied emotions

01:41.760 --> 01:44.120
 related to mating love in relationships,

01:44.120 --> 01:46.540
 such as lust and jealousy.

01:46.540 --> 01:48.680
 And he's extensively explored something

01:48.680 --> 01:50.240
 called mate poaching,

01:50.240 --> 01:52.520
 or the various strategies that men and women use

01:52.520 --> 01:54.880
 to make sure that the person that they want to be with

01:54.880 --> 01:57.800
 or the person they are with is not with anyone else

01:57.800 --> 01:59.520
 or seeking anyone else,

01:59.520 --> 02:03.360
 and indeed that other people don't seek their mate.

02:03.360 --> 02:07.140
 Dr. Buss's work also relates to how biological influences,

02:07.140 --> 02:10.420
 such as ovulation or time within the menstrual cycle,

02:10.420 --> 02:14.920
 influences mate selection or tendency to have sex or not

02:14.920 --> 02:17.700
 with a potential short or long-term mate.

02:17.700 --> 02:21.240
 And more recent work from Dr. Buss's laboratory focuses

02:21.240 --> 02:23.180
 on the darker aspects of mating

02:23.180 --> 02:24.600
 and sexual behavior in humans,

02:24.600 --> 02:27.460
 including stalking and sexual violence.

02:27.460 --> 02:30.040
 Today, we discuss all those topics.

02:30.040 --> 02:33.340
 We also discuss some of the strategies that humans can use

02:33.340 --> 02:35.840
 to make healthy mate selection choices,

02:35.840 --> 02:38.520
 and for those that are already in committed relationships

02:38.520 --> 02:40.200
 to ensure healthy progression

02:40.200 --> 02:41.880
 of those committed relationships.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.440
 In addition to publishing dozens

02:43.440 --> 02:45.800
 of landmark scientific studies,

02:45.800 --> 02:48.760
 Dr. Buss has authored many important books.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.360
 A few of those include The Evolution of Desire

02:51.360 --> 02:53.500
 and Why Women Have Sex.

02:53.500 --> 02:56.520
 And his most recent book is the one that I'm reading now,

02:56.520 --> 02:59.260
 which is called When Men Behave Badly,

02:59.260 --> 03:01.120
 The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,

03:01.120 --> 03:02.560
 Harassment, and Assault.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.940
 And it's an absolutely fascinating read.

03:04.940 --> 03:08.080
 It has endorsements from Dr. Robert Sapolsky,

03:08.080 --> 03:08.960
 professor at Stanford,

03:08.960 --> 03:11.520
 who's been on this podcast as a guest before,

03:11.520 --> 03:15.740
 as well as Steven Pinker and Jonathan Haidt,

03:15.740 --> 03:18.200
 who wrote The Coddling of the American Mind.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.400
 It's a really important book, I believe,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.820
 and one that doesn't just get into the darker aspects

03:22.820 --> 03:24.840
 of human mating behavior and violence,

03:24.840 --> 03:26.800
 but also strategies that people can take

03:26.800 --> 03:30.680
 to ensure healthy mating behavior and relationships.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.660
 There's so much rumor, speculation,

03:32.660 --> 03:36.160
 and outright fabrication of ideas

03:36.160 --> 03:38.640
 about why humans select particular mates

03:38.640 --> 03:40.240
 in the short and long term,

03:40.240 --> 03:42.800
 what men and women do differently, and so on.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.480
 What I love about Dr. Buss's work

03:44.480 --> 03:47.360
 is that it's grounded in laboratory studies

03:47.360 --> 03:50.680
 that are highly quantitative using rigorous statistics.

03:50.680 --> 03:52.220
 And so throughout today's discussion,

03:52.220 --> 03:54.240
 you'll notice that I'm wrapped with attention,

03:54.240 --> 03:56.440
 trying to extract as much information as I can

03:56.440 --> 03:59.260
 from Dr. Buss about the real science

03:59.260 --> 04:02.040
 of human mate selection and mating strategy.

04:02.040 --> 04:03.680
 I'm certain that everyone will take away

04:03.680 --> 04:05.200
 extremely valuable knowledge

04:05.200 --> 04:08.000
 that they can use in existing or future relationships

04:08.000 --> 04:10.260
 from this discussion with Dr. Buss.

04:10.260 --> 04:13.080
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

04:13.080 --> 04:16.080
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:16.080 --> 04:18.240
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:18.240 --> 04:20.880
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:20.880 --> 04:23.700
 and science related tools to the general public.

04:23.700 --> 04:24.760
 In keeping with that theme,

04:24.760 --> 04:27.440
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:27.440 --> 04:29.240
 Our first sponsor is Roca.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.320
 Roca makes eyeglasses and sunglasses

04:31.320 --> 04:33.760
 that are the absolute highest quality.

04:33.760 --> 04:36.000
 I've spent a lifetime working on the visual system,

04:36.000 --> 04:38.640
 and I can tell you that the cells and connections

04:38.640 --> 04:40.720
 of our brain and visual system have to contend

04:40.720 --> 04:42.280
 with an enormous number of challenges

04:42.280 --> 04:44.600
 in order to see clearly.

04:44.600 --> 04:46.940
 For instance, when you go from a brightly lit environment

04:46.940 --> 04:49.440
 to a dimmer environment or into a shadow,

04:49.440 --> 04:51.460
 your visual system has to adjust.

04:51.460 --> 04:53.940
 The problem with a lot of sunglasses and eyeglasses out there

04:53.940 --> 04:56.960
 is that they don't work well with those adjustments.

04:56.960 --> 04:58.880
 Roca has overcome those challenges,

04:58.880 --> 05:01.680
 and as a consequence, no matter what environment you're in,

05:01.680 --> 05:03.540
 you see with crystal clarity.

05:03.540 --> 05:05.880
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses are also terrific

05:05.880 --> 05:07.480
 because they are extremely lightweight,

05:07.480 --> 05:09.520
 so you don't even notice that they're on your face.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.520
 And they can be worn when working or for school

05:12.520 --> 05:15.800
 or just walking about, but also when running or cycling.

05:15.800 --> 05:17.640
 And indeed, if you get sweaty,

05:17.640 --> 05:19.240
 they won't slip off your face.

05:19.240 --> 05:20.520
 That's a terrific feature,

05:20.520 --> 05:22.440
 but they can be worn to do anything.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.600
 I wear readers at night,

05:23.600 --> 05:25.720
 and sometimes when I drive at night.

05:25.720 --> 05:28.440
 And a wonderful thing about Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses

05:28.440 --> 05:31.880
 is that unlike a lot of other performance glasses out there

05:31.880 --> 05:33.840
 that make people look like cyborgs

05:33.840 --> 05:36.360
 or make it look like you're definitely off to exercise,

05:36.360 --> 05:38.820
 Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses have a range

05:38.820 --> 05:42.440
 of terrific aesthetics that you could wear anywhere.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.040

05:56.000 --> 05:58.980
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

05:58.980 --> 06:01.960
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

06:01.960 --> 06:04.640
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

06:04.640 --> 06:06.260
 to help you better understand your body

06:06.260 --> 06:08.440
 and help you reach your health goals.

06:08.440 --> 06:11.080
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

06:11.080 --> 06:13.080
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

06:13.080 --> 06:16.120
 that strongly impact your immediate and long-term health

06:16.120 --> 06:18.880
 can only be assessed from a quality blood test.

06:18.880 --> 06:21.620
 And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,

06:21.620 --> 06:24.240
 you can get additional information about how your body

06:24.240 --> 06:26.920
 and your nervous system work, your immune system,

06:26.920 --> 06:29.880
 in ways that can inform better health choices.

06:29.880 --> 06:33.000
 The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there

06:33.000 --> 06:35.680
 is that you don't get any information about what to do

06:35.680 --> 06:37.700
 with the data that you get.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.320
 Inside Tracker solves that problem.

06:39.320 --> 06:41.420
 They have a very easy to use dashboard,

06:41.420 --> 06:43.320
 so when you get your numbers back,

06:43.320 --> 06:45.560
 it can direct you towards specific nutrition,

06:45.560 --> 06:48.820
 supplementation, or lifestyle changes that you can make

06:48.820 --> 06:51.680
 in order to bring the numbers for a given hormones,

06:51.680 --> 06:54.480
 metabolic factors, immune factors into the range

06:54.480 --> 06:55.760
 that's ideal for you.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.600
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

07:07.240 --> 07:10.280
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

07:10.280 --> 07:12.080
 Headspace is a meditation app

07:12.080 --> 07:15.000
 that's supported by 25 peer-reviewed published studies

07:15.000 --> 07:18.640
 and benefits from over 600,000 five-star reviews.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.900
 There is now a plethora of scientific data

07:20.900 --> 07:24.160
 pointing to the fact that a regular meditation practice

07:24.160 --> 07:26.760
 is immensely beneficial for reducing anxiety,

07:26.760 --> 07:29.240
 improving sleep, improving focus,

07:29.240 --> 07:32.520
 many, many other aspects of mental and physical health.

07:32.520 --> 07:34.280
 The challenge many people have, however,

07:34.280 --> 07:36.640
 is maintaining a regular meditation practice.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.680
 And indeed, I am one of those people.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.560
 I've been meditating on and off for about 30 years,

07:41.560 --> 07:44.560
 and I confess a lot of times it's more off than on

07:44.560 --> 07:47.280
 until a few years ago when I started using the Headspace app

07:47.280 --> 07:48.800
 and then I found it very easy,

07:48.800 --> 07:50.040
 and I continue to find it easy

07:50.040 --> 07:52.240
 to maintain a daily meditation practice.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.520
 And that's because Headspace

07:53.520 --> 07:55.640
 has many meditations to select from.

07:55.640 --> 07:58.420
 So even if I only have five minutes or 15 minutes,

07:58.420 --> 07:59.660
 I'm able to do a meditation,

07:59.660 --> 08:01.240
 I really enjoy those meditations,

08:01.240 --> 08:03.880
 and I always see the benefits of those meditations.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.720
 In fact, if I just miss a couple of days,

08:05.720 --> 08:07.900
 I start to notice that I'm not doing as well

08:07.900 --> 08:09.360
 as when I'm meditating regularly.

08:09.360 --> 08:11.880
 The Headspace app makes it exceedingly easy

08:11.880 --> 08:13.440
 to meditate regularly.

08:13.440 --> 08:14.560

08:29.880 --> 08:33.960
 And now my conversation with Dr. David Buss.

08:33.960 --> 08:35.920
 Well, David, delighted to be here.

08:35.920 --> 08:38.260
 I've followed your work for a number of years,

08:38.260 --> 08:40.320
 and I'm excited to ask you a number of questions

08:40.320 --> 08:42.600
 about these super interesting topics

08:42.600 --> 08:45.520
 about how people select mates,

08:45.520 --> 08:49.200
 how they lie, cheat,

08:49.200 --> 08:51.800
 but also behave well in this dance

08:51.800 --> 08:53.320
 that we call mate choice.

08:53.320 --> 08:54.160
 Yes, yeah.

08:54.160 --> 08:58.840
 Fortunately, there are well-behaving humans in the mix here.

08:58.840 --> 08:59.680
 Good to know.

09:00.620 --> 09:02.460
 Just to start off,

09:02.460 --> 09:05.480
 perhaps you could just orient us a little bit

09:05.480 --> 09:07.080
 about mate choice.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.500
 You know, some of the primary criteria

09:10.500 --> 09:14.400
 that studies show men and women use

09:14.400 --> 09:16.120
 in order to select mates,

09:16.120 --> 09:20.200
 both shall we call them transient mates

09:20.200 --> 09:22.280
 as well as lifetime mates.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.960
 Right, well, that's a critical distinction

09:23.960 --> 09:25.680
 because what people look for

09:25.680 --> 09:27.980
 in a long-term committed mateship,

09:27.980 --> 09:31.200
 like a marriage partner or a long-term romantic relationship

09:31.200 --> 09:33.360
 is different from what people look for

09:33.360 --> 09:36.520
 in a hookup or casual sex or one night stand

09:36.520 --> 09:37.940
 or even a brief affair.

09:37.940 --> 09:41.460
 So that's actually critical.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.900
 Wonder if we could maybe just back up a second

09:43.900 --> 09:47.100
 and just talk a little bit about the theoretical framework

09:47.100 --> 09:49.060
 for understanding mate choice.

09:49.060 --> 09:51.820
 So it basically stems from Darwin's theory

09:51.820 --> 09:53.460
 of sexual selection.

09:53.460 --> 09:55.540
 And most people, when they think about evolution,

09:55.540 --> 09:59.380
 they think about cliches like survival of the fittest

09:59.380 --> 10:02.140
 or nature, red in tooth and claw.

10:02.140 --> 10:05.100
 And Darwin noticed that there were phenomena

10:05.100 --> 10:07.980
 that couldn't be explained by this so-called survival

10:07.980 --> 10:11.900
 selection, things like the brilliant plumage of peacocks,

10:11.900 --> 10:15.460
 sex differences like in stags, for example,

10:15.460 --> 10:17.260
 have these massive antlers

10:17.260 --> 10:20.260
 and the females of the species do not.

10:20.260 --> 10:23.100
 And so he came up with the theory of sexual selection,

10:23.100 --> 10:25.820
 which deals not with the evolution of characteristics

10:25.820 --> 10:27.940
 due to their survival advantage,

10:27.940 --> 10:30.380
 but rather due to their mating advantage.

10:30.380 --> 10:33.320
 And he identified two causal processes

10:33.320 --> 10:35.940
 by which mating advantage could occur.

10:35.940 --> 10:38.900
 One is intra-sexual competition

10:38.900 --> 10:43.300
 with the stereotyping two stags locking horns in combat

10:43.300 --> 10:45.460
 with the victor gaining sexual access

10:45.460 --> 10:49.100
 to the female loser ambling off with a broken antler

10:49.100 --> 10:51.180
 and dejected and low self-esteem

10:51.180 --> 10:53.080
 and needing psychotherapy perhaps

10:53.080 --> 10:57.760
 or mate value improvement therapy.

10:59.020 --> 11:01.660
 And the logic was whatever qualities led to success

11:01.660 --> 11:03.100
 in these same sex battles,

11:03.100 --> 11:05.820
 those qualities get passed on in greater numbers.

11:05.820 --> 11:08.900
 And so you see evolution, which has changed over time

11:08.900 --> 11:11.980
 and increase in frequency of the characteristics

11:11.980 --> 11:13.940
 associated with winning these,

11:13.940 --> 11:16.420
 what Darwin called contest competition.

11:16.420 --> 11:18.980
 And we know that the logic of that is more general now

11:18.980 --> 11:21.540
 and involves things like in our species competing

11:21.540 --> 11:24.260
 for position and status hierarchies.

11:24.260 --> 11:27.400
 So anyway, so intra-sexual competition is one,

11:27.400 --> 11:30.960
 but the second most relevant to your question

11:30.960 --> 11:33.980
 about mate choice is preferential mate choice.

11:33.980 --> 11:36.380
 That was the second causal pathway.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.780
 And the logic there is that

11:38.780 --> 11:41.280
 if members of one sex agree with one another,

11:41.280 --> 11:44.060
 if there's some consensus about the qualities

11:44.060 --> 11:47.060
 that are desired, then those of the opposite sex

11:47.060 --> 11:48.840
 who possess the desired qualities

11:48.840 --> 11:51.020
 or embody those desired qualities,

11:51.020 --> 11:52.780
 they have a mating advantage.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.340
 They get chosen, they get preferred.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.340
 Those lacking desired qualities get banished, shunned,

11:58.340 --> 12:02.420
 ignored, or in the modern environment become incels.

12:02.420 --> 12:05.200
 And so the logic there is very simple,

12:05.200 --> 12:06.900
 but also very powerful.

12:06.900 --> 12:10.900
 And that is that whatever qualities are desired,

12:10.900 --> 12:12.060
 consensually desired,

12:12.060 --> 12:14.180
 if there's some heritable basis to those,

12:14.180 --> 12:17.220
 then those increase in frequency over time.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.740
 And so, and in the human case,

12:19.740 --> 12:24.460
 these two causal processes of sexual selection

12:24.460 --> 12:26.380
 are related to each other

12:26.380 --> 12:29.620
 in that the make preferences of one sex

12:29.620 --> 12:31.660
 basically set the ground rules

12:31.660 --> 12:34.260
 for competition in the opposite sex.

12:34.260 --> 12:36.820
 So if, for example, hypothetically,

12:36.820 --> 12:39.460
 women preferred to mate with men

12:39.460 --> 12:43.140
 who were able and willing to devote resources to them,

12:43.140 --> 12:46.100
 then that would create competition among men

12:46.100 --> 12:50.420
 to claw their way and beat out other men

12:50.420 --> 12:52.060
 in resource acquisition,

12:52.060 --> 12:54.300
 and then displaying their willingness

12:54.300 --> 12:56.140
 to commit that to a particular woman.

12:56.140 --> 12:57.300
 And same with women, though.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.740
 And this is one of the interesting things about humans

13:00.740 --> 13:03.140
 is that we have mutual mate choice,

13:03.140 --> 13:05.260
 which is not true in all species.

13:05.260 --> 13:08.540
 So, and that is that it's not just a matter of,

13:08.540 --> 13:11.680
 you know, you selecting someone to be your mate.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.940
 They have to reciprocally select you.

13:13.940 --> 13:16.600
 And so with mutual mate choice,

13:17.520 --> 13:19.220
 we have both preferences,

13:19.220 --> 13:22.020
 mate preferences that women have,

13:22.020 --> 13:24.180
 and mate preferences that men have,

13:24.180 --> 13:27.060
 and consequently competition among men

13:27.060 --> 13:29.660
 for access to the most desirable women,

13:29.660 --> 13:31.180
 and competition among women

13:31.180 --> 13:33.860
 for access to the most desirable men.

13:33.860 --> 13:37.420
 So that's sort of a little bit of the theoretical backdrop.

13:37.420 --> 13:40.460
 So you asked, well, what are the qualities

13:40.460 --> 13:42.340
 that men and women desire?

13:42.340 --> 13:45.340
 And maybe we'll start with long-term mating,

13:45.340 --> 13:48.180
 and then shift to short-term mating.

13:48.180 --> 13:52.300
 And long-term mating is interesting in and of itself

13:52.300 --> 13:56.260
 in that it's very rare in the mammalian world.

13:56.260 --> 13:59.380
 So there are more than 5,000 species of primates,

13:59.380 --> 14:02.620
 of which, I'm sorry, more than 5,000 species of mammals,

14:02.620 --> 14:03.980
 of which we are one.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.180
 But the percentage of mammals

14:07.180 --> 14:09.100
 that have anything resembling

14:09.100 --> 14:11.660
 like a pair-bonded long-term mating strategy,

14:11.660 --> 14:13.580
 it's about three to 5%.

14:13.580 --> 14:14.580
 It's extremely rare.

14:14.580 --> 14:19.060
 And even our closest primate relatives, the chimpanzees,

14:19.060 --> 14:22.460
 they don't have a long-term mating strategy.

14:22.460 --> 14:25.260
 They don't have anything resembling pair-bonded mating.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.980
 In the chimps, the females come into estrus.

14:27.980 --> 14:29.940
 Almost all the sexual activity occurs

14:29.940 --> 14:31.820
 during the estrus phase.

14:31.820 --> 14:35.380
 After that, males and females basically ignore each other

14:35.380 --> 14:37.700
 for the most part, with some exceptions.

14:38.940 --> 14:40.420
 But with humans, you have the evolution

14:40.420 --> 14:44.340
 of long-term pair-bonding, attachment,

14:44.340 --> 14:47.860
 heavy male investment in offspring,

14:47.860 --> 14:50.740
 relatively concealed ovulation.

14:50.740 --> 14:53.020
 And so these are kind of unique aspects

14:53.020 --> 14:55.060
 of the human mating system.

14:55.060 --> 14:59.420
 So to get to your question, so well, what are the qualities?

14:59.420 --> 15:03.620
 So the best, the most large-scale study

15:03.620 --> 15:05.740
 that's been done on this is a study that I did

15:05.740 --> 15:08.580
 a while back of 37 different cultures.

15:08.580 --> 15:11.020
 And it's now been replicated by other researchers.

15:11.020 --> 15:14.820
 But basically what we found is three clusters of things.

15:14.820 --> 15:19.140
 We found qualities that both men and women wanted

15:19.140 --> 15:20.980
 in a long-term mate.

15:20.980 --> 15:24.500
 We found some qualities that were sex-differentiated,

15:24.500 --> 15:26.540
 where women preferred them more than men

15:26.540 --> 15:28.500
 or men preferred them more than women.

15:28.500 --> 15:30.420
 And then we found some attributes

15:30.420 --> 15:33.300
 that were highly variable across cultures

15:33.300 --> 15:36.460
 in whether people found these as desirable

15:36.460 --> 15:39.140
 or indispensable or irrelevant in a mate.

15:39.140 --> 15:43.100
 And so I could give examples of each of these, if that.

15:43.100 --> 15:44.980
 Yeah, that would be great.

15:44.980 --> 15:48.100
 I'd love to know what some of the common themes were

15:48.100 --> 15:50.540
 across these cultures in terms of what's being

15:51.860 --> 15:53.980
 made and sexually selected for.

15:53.980 --> 15:57.700
 Yeah, so some of the things that were,

15:57.700 --> 15:59.700
 so you've talked about universal desire,

15:59.700 --> 16:01.580
 so things that men and women share.

16:02.420 --> 16:06.740
 There are things like intelligence, kindness,

16:06.740 --> 16:09.220
 mutual attraction, and love,

16:09.220 --> 16:11.140
 which is really kind of heartwarming

16:11.140 --> 16:13.660
 because some people think that love

16:13.660 --> 16:18.380
 is a recent Western invention by some European poets,

16:18.380 --> 16:19.620
 but it turns out it's not true.

16:19.620 --> 16:22.460
 You go to the Klungsan in Botswana,

16:22.460 --> 16:26.460
 and they describe pretty much the same experience

16:26.460 --> 16:29.220
 as a falling in love as we do,

16:29.220 --> 16:31.220
 and even describe the distinction

16:31.220 --> 16:33.780
 between this kind of infatuation stage of love

16:33.780 --> 16:38.460
 and the attachment phase where you can't maintain

16:38.460 --> 16:43.380
 this frenzy of infatuation and obsession for very long,

16:43.380 --> 16:47.540
 six weeks, maybe six months at most,

16:47.540 --> 16:50.220
 otherwise you can get nothing else done in your life.

16:50.220 --> 16:53.420
 Those are those dopamine circuits firing at high frequency.

16:53.420 --> 16:58.420
 Yeah, so mutual attraction, love, good health,

17:02.460 --> 17:05.980
 dependability, emotional stability,

17:05.980 --> 17:07.740
 although there's a bit of a sex difference there

17:07.740 --> 17:09.940
 with women preferring it a bit more than men,

17:10.940 --> 17:14.300
 and so basically, and these may seem obvious,

17:14.300 --> 17:19.300
 so no one wants a stupid, mean, ugly, disease-ridden mate,

17:20.220 --> 17:24.100
 and so perhaps obvious, but no one knew this

17:24.100 --> 17:26.700
 in advance of the 37 culture study.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.540
 So these were some universal preferences.

17:29.540 --> 17:32.660
 So you go to the Zulu tribe in South Africa

17:32.660 --> 17:37.620
 or Rio de Janeiro in Brazil,

17:37.620 --> 17:42.620
 or Portugal, or Oslo, or anywhere in the world,

17:43.820 --> 17:47.260
 and these are qualities that people universally desire

17:47.260 --> 17:49.380
 in long-term mates.

17:49.380 --> 17:50.340
 Sex differences.

17:50.340 --> 17:53.540
 So sex differences basically fell into two clusters.

17:53.540 --> 17:58.540
 So women more than men prioritized good earning capacity,

18:01.580 --> 18:06.500
 slightly older age, and the qualities associated

18:06.500 --> 18:08.300
 with resource acquisition.

18:08.300 --> 18:11.820
 So these are things like a man's social status.

18:11.820 --> 18:13.020
 Does he have drive?

18:13.020 --> 18:14.380
 Is he ambitious?

18:15.780 --> 18:18.260
 Does he have a good long-term resource trajectory

18:18.260 --> 18:19.780
 is one way that I like to phrase it,

18:19.780 --> 18:23.460
 because women often, they don't look at necessarily

18:25.300 --> 18:28.740
 the resources that a guy possesses at this moment,

18:28.740 --> 18:30.460
 but what is his trajectory?

18:30.460 --> 18:31.300
 And so-

18:31.300 --> 18:33.300
 Just sorry to interrupt, but may I ask,

18:33.300 --> 18:36.100
 is there anything known about the commonalities

18:36.100 --> 18:38.140
 of how that is assessed?

18:38.140 --> 18:42.060
 You know, is it, you know, he's rolling out of bed early

18:42.060 --> 18:45.140
 and running eight miles.

18:45.140 --> 18:48.100
 He's showing proficiency in school.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.540
 He handles himself well socially at parties,

18:50.540 --> 18:53.580
 isn't drinking too much, but knows when, you know,

18:53.580 --> 18:56.060
 I mean, obviously they're integrating multiple cues.

18:56.060 --> 18:57.340
 The brain is a complex place,

18:57.340 --> 19:00.420
 but is there any information about

19:00.420 --> 19:03.940
 what those variables are across cultures?

19:03.940 --> 19:08.580
 Yeah, well, I think that there's been less attention

19:08.580 --> 19:10.980
 to that, so that's a great question.

19:10.980 --> 19:13.780
 One of the things that we do know across cultures

19:13.780 --> 19:18.020
 is that women attend to the attention structure.

19:18.020 --> 19:22.140
 So the attention structure is a key determinant of status.

19:22.140 --> 19:23.660
 So there's people who are high in status

19:23.660 --> 19:26.820
 are those to whom the most people pay the most attention.

19:26.820 --> 19:28.420
 Ah, so the attention of others to them,

19:28.420 --> 19:31.860
 not how well a given potential mate can focus

19:31.860 --> 19:33.260
 and pay attention necessarily.

19:33.260 --> 19:35.220
 Yes, yeah, exactly.

19:35.220 --> 19:38.860
 But women, look, I mean, you know,

19:38.860 --> 19:41.100
 is the guy, even in the modern environment,

19:41.100 --> 19:45.300
 is the guy spending eight hours a day playing video games,

19:45.300 --> 19:47.020
 eating Cheetos and drinking beer,

19:47.020 --> 19:51.180
 or is he devoting effort to his professional development?

19:52.060 --> 19:56.260
 So hard work, ambition, does he have clear goals,

19:56.260 --> 19:59.020
 or is he in an existential crisis

19:59.020 --> 20:01.260
 not knowing what he's gonna do with his life?

20:01.260 --> 20:04.620
 So those are some of the qualities that people look for.

20:04.620 --> 20:09.620
 And also, women use what's called in the literature

20:10.100 --> 20:13.180
 mate choice copying, and this is related in part

20:13.180 --> 20:15.540
 to the attention structure, that is,

20:15.540 --> 20:20.540
 guys who have passed the filters of multiple women,

20:23.060 --> 20:28.060
 those are like pre-approved men.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.380
 So we've done studies where you just take a guy

20:30.380 --> 20:35.380
 and photograph him alone, versus take the same guy,

20:35.580 --> 20:37.140
 put an attractive woman next to him,

20:37.140 --> 20:38.940
 or put two women next to him,

20:38.940 --> 20:41.100
 and women judge exactly the same guy

20:41.100 --> 20:45.860
 to be much more attractive if he's paired with women

20:45.860 --> 20:47.820
 than if he's not.

20:47.820 --> 20:50.780
 And some guys exploit this in the modern world

20:50.780 --> 20:54.300
 by hiring wing women to go with him on dates and so forth.

20:54.300 --> 20:58.460
 This is my sister, a former girlfriend, or whatever.

20:58.460 --> 21:03.460
 So, but you're correct in that women use multiple cues

21:08.460 --> 21:12.500
 to assess these things, and they change over time.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.620
 So in the modern environment,

21:15.620 --> 21:17.780
 even things like the attention structure,

21:17.780 --> 21:20.460
 does this guy have a million Twitter followers

21:20.460 --> 21:23.180
 or three Twitter followers?

21:23.180 --> 21:26.740
 So that is an index of the attention structure,

21:26.740 --> 21:30.700
 and hence the status of the guy within the broader community.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.380
 So, and from an evolutionary perspective,

21:34.380 --> 21:38.620
 it's reasonable that women would prioritize these qualities

21:38.620 --> 21:41.540
 because of the tremendous asymmetry

21:41.540 --> 21:43.540
 in our reproductive biology,

21:43.540 --> 21:47.020
 namely that fertilization occurs internally within women,

21:47.020 --> 21:47.980
 not within men.

21:47.980 --> 21:51.500
 Women bear the burdens of the nine-month pregnancy,

21:51.500 --> 21:53.620
 which is metabolically expensive,

21:53.620 --> 21:56.420
 as well as creating opportunity costs

21:56.420 --> 22:00.300
 in terms of mobility and solving other tasks

22:00.300 --> 22:02.660
 that people need to solve in the course of their lives.

22:02.660 --> 22:07.260
 And so one way to phrase that is that the costs

22:07.260 --> 22:11.100
 of making a bad mate choice are much heavier for women

22:11.100 --> 22:14.380
 when it comes to sexual behavior, certainly,

22:14.380 --> 22:18.340
 because, and the benefits correspondingly

22:18.340 --> 22:22.020
 of making a wise mate choice are higher for women

22:22.020 --> 22:24.380
 in the sexual context.

22:24.380 --> 22:28.300
 But as I said, we have mutual mate choice in our species,

22:28.300 --> 22:32.340
 and so what do men value more than women?

22:32.340 --> 22:33.820
 Physical attractiveness.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.380
 They rank that as a more important criteria

22:38.380 --> 22:39.740
 than do women about men?

22:39.740 --> 22:41.100
 Yes, yeah, exactly.

22:41.100 --> 22:42.140
 Consistently across cultures.

22:42.140 --> 22:43.660
 Consistently, and it's not that women

22:43.660 --> 22:46.460
 are indifferent to it.

22:46.460 --> 22:49.740
 So women do pay attention to a guy's physical appearance,

22:49.740 --> 22:52.340
 his fitness and so forth,

22:52.340 --> 22:56.780
 and guys are actually off base in thinking

22:56.780 --> 23:00.820
 that women prefer more muscular men than they actually do.

23:00.820 --> 23:02.340
 So like in muscle magazines,

23:02.340 --> 23:05.380
 these men with bulging biceps and so forth,

23:05.380 --> 23:07.700
 women don't find that a specialty,

23:07.700 --> 23:10.060
 but they do prioritize fit men,

23:10.060 --> 23:11.820
 a good shoulder to hip ratio

23:11.820 --> 23:14.180
 and other qualities of physical appearance,

23:14.180 --> 23:17.620
 as well as things like cues to health.

23:17.620 --> 23:22.420
 So physical appearance provides a wealth of information

23:22.420 --> 23:24.700
 about a person's health status,

23:24.700 --> 23:28.340
 but also provides for men a wealth of information

23:28.340 --> 23:32.060
 about a woman's fertility, her reproductive value.

23:32.060 --> 23:34.020
 Now, not that men think about that consciously.

23:34.020 --> 23:36.980
 I mean, men don't walk down the street and see a woman

23:36.980 --> 23:38.780
 and say, oh, I find her attractive

23:38.780 --> 23:41.700
 because I think she must be very fertile.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.260
 Maybe a few weird people do that,

23:43.260 --> 23:47.900
 but most men, it's like they just find those cues attractive

23:47.900 --> 23:51.540
 and the cues are cues associated with youth and health,

23:51.540 --> 23:54.580
 because we know that youth is a very powerful cue

23:54.580 --> 23:57.260
 to fertility and reproductive value.

23:57.260 --> 23:59.060
 So men prioritize physical appearance

23:59.060 --> 24:01.820
 and in the field of psychology,

24:01.820 --> 24:04.820
 it used to, what I was taught when I was an undergraduate,

24:04.820 --> 24:07.100
 that you can't judge a book by its cover,

24:07.100 --> 24:10.900
 that physical attractiveness was infinitely arbitrary,

24:10.900 --> 24:12.940
 infinitely culturally variable,

24:12.940 --> 24:14.660
 and it's simply not true.

24:14.660 --> 24:19.660
 We know now based on the last 20 years of scientific studies

24:20.820 --> 24:24.580
 that the cues that men find attractive women

24:24.580 --> 24:26.540
 are not at all arbitrary.

24:26.540 --> 24:29.020
 There is some variation across cultures,

24:29.020 --> 24:31.780
 like in relative plumpness versus thinness,

24:32.900 --> 24:36.860
 but things like clear skin, clear eyes,

24:36.860 --> 24:43.860
 symmetrical features, a low waist to hip ratio, full lips,

24:45.100 --> 24:47.620
 lustrous hair, all these are qualities

24:47.620 --> 24:50.900
 that are associated with youth and health

24:50.900 --> 24:53.060
 and hence have evolved to be part

24:53.060 --> 24:54.900
 of our standards of attractiveness.

24:54.900 --> 24:59.260
 And so it's not just that men are these superficial creatures

24:59.260 --> 25:02.860
 who evaluate women on the basis of appearance,

25:02.860 --> 25:05.540
 there's an underlying logic to why they do so.

25:05.540 --> 25:08.220
 And as I said, relative youth,

25:08.220 --> 25:11.580
 this age thing is one of the largest sex differences

25:11.580 --> 25:13.820
 that you find in long-term age selection

25:13.820 --> 25:16.620
 with women preferring somewhat older men

25:16.620 --> 25:19.220
 and men preferring somewhat younger women.

25:19.220 --> 25:24.220
 Is there a consistent age gap to relate to that statement?

25:24.420 --> 25:25.620
 Yes, there is.

25:25.620 --> 25:30.620
 So the age gap though depends on the age of the man.

25:31.260 --> 25:34.740
 So we can document this.

25:34.740 --> 25:38.340
 So in my studies, what we found is that men preferred women

25:38.340 --> 25:42.300
 who were about three to four years younger than they were

25:42.300 --> 25:44.900
 on average, and I'll qualify this in a second,

25:44.900 --> 25:47.100
 women preferred guys who were about three and a half

25:47.100 --> 25:49.980
 to four and a half years older than they were.

25:49.980 --> 25:51.100
 So there was a sex difference

25:51.100 --> 25:52.820
 going in the opposite direction.

25:53.900 --> 25:56.580
 But as men get older, they prefer women

25:56.580 --> 25:59.380
 who are increasingly younger than they are.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.740
 So one way to gauge this,

26:01.740 --> 26:05.780
 so there are actual marriage statistics

26:05.780 --> 26:08.860
 and then there are expressed preferences

26:08.860 --> 26:10.980
 and both sexes kind of converge.

26:10.980 --> 26:15.980
 So if you look at first marriage, second marriage,

26:16.180 --> 26:19.180
 third marriage, as if people get divorced and remarried,

26:19.180 --> 26:21.940
 average age gap is, in America anyway,

26:21.940 --> 26:25.060
 is three years at first marriage with the guys being older,

26:26.500 --> 26:28.100
 five years at second marriage

26:28.100 --> 26:30.060
 and eight years at third marriage.

26:30.060 --> 26:32.940
 So that is as men are getting older

26:32.940 --> 26:34.580
 and getting divorced and remarrying,

26:34.580 --> 26:35.580
 they are marrying women

26:35.580 --> 26:38.100
 who are increasingly younger than they are.

26:38.100 --> 26:41.980
 In terms of preferences, it's also expressed in preferences.

26:41.980 --> 26:46.980
 So it doesn't go down, so like say a 25-year-old man

26:47.820 --> 26:52.140
 would say prefer a woman who's 20 or in her early 20s.

26:52.140 --> 26:54.420
 A 35-year-old man might prefer a woman

26:54.420 --> 26:57.820
 who's in her late 20s or early 30s.

26:57.820 --> 27:02.420
 A 50-year-old man might prefer a woman who's, say, 35 to 38.

27:02.420 --> 27:06.580
 So the preferences do go up,

27:06.580 --> 27:09.460
 but the gap gets increasingly larger.

27:09.460 --> 27:12.860
 And the reason that you don't see things like

27:12.860 --> 27:14.620
 why aren't men preferring women,

27:14.620 --> 27:18.340
 so peak fertility in humans is around age 24, 25.

27:19.700 --> 27:23.700
 And so you say, well, why aren't the 60-year-old men

27:23.700 --> 27:26.060
 prioritizing 25-year-old men?

27:26.060 --> 27:28.460
 Prioritizing 25-year-old women.

27:28.460 --> 27:32.940
 Well, as I mentioned, it's a reciprocal,

27:32.940 --> 27:34.940
 mutual mate choice phenomenon.

27:34.940 --> 27:35.780
 So-

27:35.780 --> 27:36.700
 She constrains the equation, too.

27:36.700 --> 27:37.900
 Well, she constrains it,

27:37.900 --> 27:40.980
 but also marriage and long-term mating

27:40.980 --> 27:44.740
 are things other than reproductive unions

27:44.740 --> 27:45.900
 in the modern environment.

27:45.900 --> 27:50.900
 That is, you're supposed to do things as a couple,

27:50.940 --> 27:53.060
 and if you get too large an age gap,

27:53.060 --> 27:55.460
 then essentially you're in different cultures.

27:55.460 --> 27:58.860
 You grow up with different songs,

27:58.860 --> 28:02.780
 and if the cultural gap gets too large,

28:02.780 --> 28:05.060
 you don't understand each other.

28:05.060 --> 28:07.700
 So there are constraints on that.

28:07.700 --> 28:10.100
 But if you look at contexts

28:10.100 --> 28:12.540
 where there are no constraints of that sort,

28:12.540 --> 28:17.540
 so historically kings, emperors, despots, et cetera,

28:18.540 --> 28:21.300
 and I'll give one more modern example,

28:21.300 --> 28:26.300
 they basically prefer young, fertile, attractive females,

28:28.140 --> 28:31.380
 and if they have harems, they stock the harems with those

28:31.380 --> 28:33.820
 and then circulate them out when they're 30 and so forth.

28:33.820 --> 28:36.540
 And so if you look at marriage systems

28:36.540 --> 28:38.100
 that are unconstrained,

28:38.100 --> 28:42.220
 then the preferences are more likely to be revealed,

28:42.220 --> 28:44.180
 or within cultures.

28:44.180 --> 28:46.580
 That is, if you look at men who are in a position

28:46.580 --> 28:48.020
 to get what they want.

28:48.020 --> 28:49.500
 So as Mick Jagger noted,

28:49.500 --> 28:50.980
 you can't always get what you want,

28:50.980 --> 28:54.100
 but if you try sometimes, you get what you need.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.500
 I hear that most of the time he got what he needed.

28:56.500 --> 28:59.140
 Right, right, he got what he wanted.

28:59.140 --> 29:01.220
 Yeah, and maybe what he needed,

29:01.220 --> 29:03.300
 but he was in a position,

29:03.300 --> 29:05.980
 I don't know if he still is, he's in his 70s now,

29:06.860 --> 29:09.180
 but he was in a position as was,

29:09.180 --> 29:11.300
 let's say Rod Stewart, to take another example,

29:11.300 --> 29:13.980
 or Leonardo DiCaprio.

29:13.980 --> 29:16.580
 If you were a male who's in a position

29:16.580 --> 29:18.700
 where there are thousands of women

29:18.700 --> 29:20.500
 potentially available to you,

29:20.500 --> 29:21.980
 and you can have your pick,

29:21.980 --> 29:26.060
 then you see that clearer expression for younger females.

29:26.060 --> 29:29.900
 There was a chart that was floating around the internet

29:29.900 --> 29:33.580
 of the girlfriends of Leonardo DiCaprio.

29:33.580 --> 29:36.700
 As he got older, so he's getting older and older,

29:36.700 --> 29:39.140
 and the graph of the age of his girlfriends,

29:39.140 --> 29:40.460
 it basically stayed the same.

29:40.460 --> 29:42.820
 It was in the early 20s or so.

29:42.820 --> 29:44.420
 He values consistency.

29:44.420 --> 29:46.020
 He values consistency.

29:46.020 --> 29:51.020
 So anyway, the data converge on that.

29:51.340 --> 29:54.220
 So these are universal sex differences

29:54.220 --> 29:57.380
 in long-term mate selection.

29:57.380 --> 29:59.380
 So now when we shift to,

29:59.380 --> 30:02.500
 oh, and I should mention cultural variability,

30:02.500 --> 30:03.540
 because that's a critical thing,

30:03.540 --> 30:06.620
 because there is, in my 37 culture study,

30:06.620 --> 30:10.060
 what I found was the preference for virginity,

30:10.060 --> 30:13.340
 that is no prior sexual experience,

30:13.340 --> 30:18.300
 that was the most variable desire across cultures.

30:18.300 --> 30:23.300
 So you had cultures like, at the time of the study, China,

30:24.300 --> 30:28.940
 it was basically indispensable that a partner be a virgin.

30:28.940 --> 30:31.540
 And then at the other end, you have Sweden,

30:31.540 --> 30:34.180
 where Sweden, Swedes typically place

30:34.180 --> 30:35.540
 close to zero value on it,

30:35.540 --> 30:37.660
 and some even find it undesirable,

30:37.660 --> 30:40.260
 like you're weird if you're a virgin.

30:40.260 --> 30:42.420
 And so you have this whole spectrum.

30:42.420 --> 30:44.660
 This is a virginity in the female,

30:44.660 --> 30:46.780
 or is this also, this is not,

30:46.780 --> 30:48.300
 and when China was it preference

30:48.300 --> 30:50.020
 that the male and the female be a virgin?

30:50.020 --> 30:51.580
 So mutual mate selection.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.740
 Yeah, it was a preference for both sexes.

30:54.900 --> 30:56.540
 But it's a good question,

30:56.540 --> 30:58.740
 because where there was a sex difference,

30:58.740 --> 31:00.340
 it was always in the direction

31:00.340 --> 31:03.740
 of males preferring virginity more than females.

31:03.740 --> 31:05.620
 And we've gone back to China.

31:05.620 --> 31:09.140
 So I still do research in China, among other places,

31:09.140 --> 31:13.460
 and we've gone back and retested modern urban populations,

31:13.460 --> 31:17.780
 and the importance of virginity has gone down in China,

31:17.780 --> 31:19.620
 especially in the urban areas.

31:19.620 --> 31:22.620
 And the sex difference that didn't exist before

31:22.620 --> 31:25.940
 has now emerged, where males value it more than females.

31:25.940 --> 31:27.740
 And I think part of it was,

31:27.740 --> 31:32.260
 in previous times, you hit ceiling effects,

31:32.260 --> 31:33.420
 where both sexes say,

31:33.420 --> 31:36.700
 yeah, it's absolutely important to be a virgin.

31:36.700 --> 31:41.700
 So there's cultural variation and cultural change over time

31:42.260 --> 31:43.980
 in some of these qualities.

31:45.780 --> 31:48.140
 But the sex differences that I described

31:48.140 --> 31:50.500
 have remained invariant over the years.

31:50.500 --> 31:53.460
 So since my 37 culture study,

31:53.460 --> 31:55.500
 this has been replicated in at least

31:55.500 --> 31:58.020
 a couple dozen different cultures,

31:58.020 --> 32:00.980
 and we've gone back to some of the cultures.

32:00.980 --> 32:03.380
 So I mentioned we've gone back to China,

32:03.380 --> 32:08.380
 Brazil, and India to look at cultural changes over time.

32:08.500 --> 32:11.660
 And there have been, in some cases,

32:11.660 --> 32:14.020
 dramatic cultural changes over time,

32:14.020 --> 32:17.100
 but the sex differences that I described are invariant.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.140
 They haven't changed a bit.

32:19.140 --> 32:20.900
 I'd be remiss if I didn't ask

32:20.900 --> 32:23.580
 about truth-telling and deception,

32:23.580 --> 32:26.300
 because some of the measures that you're describing,

32:26.300 --> 32:31.300
 age, for instance, one can potentially lie about, right?

32:31.420 --> 32:32.500
 I'm guessing that there are people

32:32.500 --> 32:35.220
 who do that on online profiles and whatnot.

32:36.340 --> 32:40.020
 From what I understand, people also lie about height

32:40.020 --> 32:43.080
 and other features on online profiles,

32:43.080 --> 32:45.700
 but some of them are much harder to hide, right?

32:45.700 --> 32:49.180
 Eventually, the truth comes out about some,

32:49.180 --> 32:50.620
 if not all of these things.

32:50.620 --> 32:54.620
 So if you would, could you tell us about

32:54.620 --> 32:58.980
 how men and women leverage deception

32:58.980 --> 33:00.600
 versus truth-telling and communicating

33:00.600 --> 33:03.940
 some of the things around mate choice selection?

33:03.940 --> 33:08.940
 Yeah, well, so basically, both men and women do deceive.

33:09.020 --> 33:13.780
 So we have the modern cultural invention of online dating,

33:13.780 --> 33:17.980
 which was little used 10 years ago

33:17.980 --> 33:22.980
 and virtually absent 20 years ago, and people do lie,

33:23.100 --> 33:25.180
 but they lie in predictable ways.

33:25.180 --> 33:28.660
 They lie in ways that attempt to embody

33:28.660 --> 33:30.660
 the mate preferences of the person

33:30.660 --> 33:32.060
 they're trying to attract.

33:32.060 --> 33:36.700
 And so men do lie, they deceive about their income,

33:36.700 --> 33:40.700
 their status, so they exaggerate their income by about 20%.

33:43.380 --> 33:45.560
 They tack on about two inches to their height,

33:45.560 --> 33:48.120
 so if they're 5'10", they round up to six feet.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.100
 So they don't, like if they're 5'10",

33:51.100 --> 33:53.120
 they don't say that they're gigantic,

33:53.120 --> 33:55.100
 but they kind of round it up

33:55.100 --> 33:57.340
 in the more desirable direction.

33:57.340 --> 34:00.940
 Women tend to deceive about weight,

34:00.940 --> 34:03.300
 so they tend to shave about 15 pounds

34:03.300 --> 34:05.300
 off of their reported weight.

34:05.300 --> 34:10.300
 And both sexes post photos that are not truly representative

34:10.500 --> 34:11.940
 of what they actually look like.

34:11.940 --> 34:14.960
 So they might post photos of themselves

34:14.960 --> 34:18.960
 when they were younger, or they're even advice tips

34:21.280 --> 34:25.660
 on how to create the best selfie of the best angle

34:25.660 --> 34:29.740
 that will maximally enhance what you look like.

34:29.740 --> 34:31.980
 Or just doctoring of photos, I'm guessing.

34:31.980 --> 34:34.420
 Or yeah, yeah, photoshopping, absolutely.

34:34.420 --> 34:38.100
 And one of the things about it,

34:38.100 --> 34:40.260
 now you say like, well, do people find out?

34:40.260 --> 34:42.160
 Of course, people do find out.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.960
 I mean, I'll just give you one story

34:43.960 --> 34:46.180
 about a colleague of mine who was doing,

34:46.180 --> 34:48.100
 is a male who's doing internet dating,

34:48.100 --> 34:52.980
 and he picked only women who self-describe as sevens

34:52.980 --> 34:54.820
 on the one to seven on attractiveness.

34:54.820 --> 34:58.140
 So the most attractive, as self-reported.

34:58.140 --> 35:00.580
 And so he went out with this one woman,

35:00.580 --> 35:03.500
 and she was missing her front teeth.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.460
 And he said, well, call me picky,

35:06.460 --> 35:08.500
 but I'm missing her front teeth,

35:08.500 --> 35:11.020
 and she thinks she's like the top of her drag.

35:11.020 --> 35:13.780
 He was a little disappointed about that.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.460
 And women, of course, are disappointed.

35:15.460 --> 35:19.300
 They meet a guy who they think is this physically fit,

35:19.300 --> 35:21.680
 you know, athletic guy, and he comes up,

35:21.680 --> 35:25.300
 he's 300 pounds and overweight.

35:25.300 --> 35:27.540
 So people do find out.

35:27.540 --> 35:30.820
 And so, and there are some internet dating sites

35:30.820 --> 35:35.820
 have kind of a vetting of the accuracy of something.

35:36.620 --> 35:39.040
 So somethings you can look up through public records,

35:39.040 --> 35:42.540
 and does this guy have a criminal record, for example?

35:42.540 --> 35:47.540
 Is he on a sexual offender's website?

35:47.540 --> 35:51.660
 So there's some things you can verify,

35:51.660 --> 35:56.020
 but what I tell people is you really have to meet the person

35:56.020 --> 35:59.980
 and interact, you know, in part because of the deception,

35:59.980 --> 36:04.020
 but also because what happens with internet dating

36:04.020 --> 36:09.020
 is that the photograph tends to overwhelm all the other cues

36:09.580 --> 36:12.620
 and all the other cues are written statements.

36:12.620 --> 36:17.220
 And we weren't really evolved to process written statements,

36:17.220 --> 36:21.000
 but we were evolved to respond to physical cues.

36:21.000 --> 36:26.000
 But, and men tend to attend to the visual cues

36:27.420 --> 36:28.580
 much more than women.

36:28.580 --> 36:32.560
 So women in their mate selection, they have olfactory cues.

36:32.560 --> 36:35.300
 So what does the guy sound like, his vocal qualities?

36:37.140 --> 36:41.020
 That's auditory cues, but olfactory cues,

36:41.020 --> 36:42.320
 what does he smell like?

36:42.320 --> 36:47.080
 And so women have a more acute sense of smell than men do.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.700
 And so if the guy doesn't smell right,

36:49.700 --> 36:52.980
 even if he embodies all the other qualities women want,

36:52.980 --> 36:54.100
 that's a deal breaker.

36:54.980 --> 36:58.740
 And so I encourage people just, you know,

36:58.740 --> 37:02.340
 stop with the hundred texts back and forth or messaging

37:02.340 --> 37:05.380
 and meet a person for a cup of coffee and interact.

37:05.380 --> 37:06.680
 And then you'll, you know,

37:06.680 --> 37:09.780
 you'll get a more accurate beat on the person.

37:09.780 --> 37:11.900
 And then of course, some qualities you can't assess

37:11.900 --> 37:16.160
 even with a half hour interaction, you can tell a lot,

37:16.160 --> 37:19.100
 but things like emotional stability

37:19.100 --> 37:22.900
 are things that have to be assessed over time.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.580
 And so one of the things that I advise people to do,

37:26.580 --> 37:28.220
 and I'm not in the advice giving business,

37:28.220 --> 37:29.580
 but people ask me all the time,

37:29.580 --> 37:30.980
 once they find out what I study,

37:30.980 --> 37:33.900
 they say, well, Tom, I got this problem.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.220
 Can you give me advice?

37:35.220 --> 37:36.780
 But one of the things to assess things

37:36.780 --> 37:38.500
 like emotional stability,

37:38.500 --> 37:41.020
 which is absolutely critical in long-term mating,

37:41.940 --> 37:44.900
 is to do something like go on a trip together,

37:44.900 --> 37:47.780
 take a vacation where you're even

37:47.780 --> 37:52.180
 in an unfamiliar environment where you have to cope

37:52.180 --> 37:55.100
 with things that you're not familiar with,

37:55.100 --> 37:58.820
 as opposed to an environment where it's very predictable.

37:58.820 --> 38:01.300
 And so you get a greater exposure

38:01.300 --> 38:06.300
 because one of the hallmarks of emotional instability

38:07.100 --> 38:10.540
 is how they respond to stress.

38:10.540 --> 38:14.860
 So emotionally unstable people tend to have a long latency

38:14.860 --> 38:18.500
 to return to baseline after a stressful event.

38:18.500 --> 38:20.460
 And so this is the sort of information

38:20.460 --> 38:23.420
 you can't get on a coffee date.

38:23.420 --> 38:26.340
 You know, you can only get by assessing it over time.

38:26.340 --> 38:28.520
 Well, as somebody who's laboratory studies stress

38:28.520 --> 38:31.500
 and tools to combat stress, that's great.

38:31.500 --> 38:33.020
 It's yet more incentive for people

38:33.020 --> 38:36.920
 to develop self-regulatory mechanisms for themselves.

38:37.860 --> 38:42.260
 I'm guessing many of the features of deception

38:42.260 --> 38:45.600
 in this context were present long before internet dating.

38:46.460 --> 38:49.740
 And so is it, it's somewhat dark to think about,

38:49.740 --> 38:54.620
 but is deception built into this dance

38:54.620 --> 38:55.780
 that we call mate selection,

38:55.780 --> 38:58.060
 and has it been built in for a long time?

38:58.060 --> 39:01.700
 Or is this something that you think has emerged

39:01.700 --> 39:04.840
 more as people are approaching each other

39:04.840 --> 39:07.860
 through these electronic web-based mediums?

39:07.860 --> 39:11.540
 Yeah, I mean, some forms of deception have been there

39:11.540 --> 39:13.900
 for a long time over human evolutionary history.

39:13.900 --> 39:16.260
 So one form of deception which we haven't mentioned

39:16.260 --> 39:19.100
 is deception about whether you're interested

39:19.100 --> 39:24.100
 in a long-term committed relationship or a short-term hookup.

39:24.140 --> 39:26.620
 And so there's deception about that,

39:26.620 --> 39:29.060
 especially on the part of men.

39:29.060 --> 39:32.240
 So men who are interested, like on Tinder,

39:32.240 --> 39:35.220
 it has been reported, although Tinder denies this,

39:35.220 --> 39:37.880
 there's been reported that something like 30% of the men

39:37.880 --> 39:39.740
 on Tinder are either married

39:39.740 --> 39:41.580
 or in long-term committed relationships,

39:41.580 --> 39:44.080
 and they're looking for something on the side.

39:44.080 --> 39:49.080
 But in terms of successfully attracting a mate,

39:49.780 --> 39:52.100
 the overt display that,

39:52.100 --> 39:54.500
 hey, I'm interested in just a short-term hookup,

39:54.500 --> 39:57.540
 I'm interested in sex, so I wanna have sex right now,

39:57.540 --> 39:59.700
 let's just go back to my apartment,

39:59.700 --> 40:02.080
 these are very ineffective tactics.

40:02.080 --> 40:04.860
 And so effective tactics for men

40:04.860 --> 40:08.220
 are often displaying cues to long-term interest.

40:08.220 --> 40:10.540
 And so, and of course that's effective

40:10.540 --> 40:14.500
 for a woman who's seeking a long-term interest.

40:14.500 --> 40:16.180
 And so that's a deception.

40:16.180 --> 40:18.380
 So we find in our studies of deception

40:18.380 --> 40:21.740
 that men tend to exaggerate the depths

40:21.740 --> 40:24.060
 of their feelings for a woman,

40:24.060 --> 40:27.140
 exaggerate how similar they are

40:27.140 --> 40:29.260
 and how aligned they are in their values

40:29.260 --> 40:32.360
 and religious orientations and political values

40:32.360 --> 40:33.200
 and so forth.

40:34.100 --> 40:37.260
 And so I think there's deception around that,

40:37.260 --> 40:38.500
 and I think that's probably

40:38.500 --> 40:42.140
 an evolutionarily recurrent form of deception

40:42.140 --> 40:45.300
 that women have defenses against, by the way.

40:45.300 --> 40:48.840
 But I think that modern internet dating

40:48.840 --> 40:51.580
 opens the door for certain types of deception

40:51.580 --> 40:53.900
 that were, at a minimum,

40:53.900 --> 40:56.620
 were difficult to accomplish ancestrally.

40:56.620 --> 41:01.620
 So things like Photoshopping wasn't available back then.

41:04.020 --> 41:07.220
 Plus, we evolved in the context of small group living

41:07.220 --> 41:11.660
 where you not only had your own personal observations

41:11.660 --> 41:15.620
 of someone's qualities, you had also your relatives,

41:15.620 --> 41:17.660
 your friends, allies,

41:17.660 --> 41:21.180
 the social reputation that someone had.

41:21.180 --> 41:24.380
 And these are all critical sources of information

41:24.380 --> 41:28.140
 that are less available in modern environments

41:28.140 --> 41:32.320
 because people migrate, they move from place to place,

41:32.320 --> 41:37.320
 they can close down one internet profile

41:37.400 --> 41:38.440
 and put up another,

41:38.440 --> 41:41.400
 or they could have six going simultaneously.

41:41.400 --> 41:45.320
 So the modern environment opens up the door

41:45.320 --> 41:48.480
 for forms of deception that weren't available

41:48.480 --> 41:52.480
 or weren't available to the same degree ancestrally.

41:52.480 --> 41:54.080
 I see.

41:54.080 --> 41:55.120
 Very interesting.

41:57.440 --> 42:00.320
 Would you mind touching on some of the features

42:00.320 --> 42:05.320
 that are selected for in terms of sexual partner choice?

42:06.400 --> 42:09.480
 We've talked a little bit about mate choice,

42:09.480 --> 42:12.120
 but in terms of sexual partner choice,

42:12.120 --> 42:14.560
 are there any good studies exploring

42:14.560 --> 42:16.280
 what people are selecting for,

42:16.280 --> 42:19.120
 or is it that they are both just in a state

42:19.120 --> 42:22.080
 of pure hypothalamic drive?

42:22.080 --> 42:24.240
 You know, I'm a neuroscientist after all.

42:24.240 --> 42:27.360
 And therefore it's hard to recreate in the laboratory.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.040
 Well, no, no, we do know something about that.

42:30.040 --> 42:33.760
 And we know something about how the preferences

42:33.760 --> 42:36.360
 for a sex partner differ from preference

42:36.360 --> 42:37.800
 for a long-term mate.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.020
 There is overlap, of course,

42:40.020 --> 42:43.680
 but one thing is physical appearance.

42:43.680 --> 42:46.140
 So physical appearance for women

42:46.140 --> 42:48.200
 is important in long-term mating,

42:48.200 --> 42:50.260
 not as important as it is for men,

42:50.260 --> 42:54.280
 but it becomes more important in short-term mating.

42:54.280 --> 42:57.800
 And so is the guy good looking?

42:57.800 --> 43:01.400
 So those physical attributes are more important for women.

43:02.880 --> 43:06.080
 They remain important for men,

43:06.080 --> 43:08.160
 physical appearance in short-term mating,

43:08.160 --> 43:11.960
 but with the footnote that men are willing

43:11.960 --> 43:15.280
 to drop their standards in short-term mating

43:15.280 --> 43:20.280
 if it's low commitment, low risk, just sex,

43:21.000 --> 43:24.140
 you know, without entangling commitments.

43:24.140 --> 43:29.140
 So women are more likely to prioritize

43:30.200 --> 43:33.080
 what I call bad boy qualities.

43:33.080 --> 43:37.060
 So guys who are very self-confident,

43:37.060 --> 43:42.000
 guys who are strut, guys who are a little arrogant,

43:42.000 --> 43:46.800
 guys who are risk-taking, guys who defy conventions,

43:46.800 --> 43:49.000
 women are more attracted to those guys

43:49.000 --> 43:52.020
 in short-term mating than long-term mating.

43:52.020 --> 43:54.800
 And whereas in long-term mating,

43:54.800 --> 43:57.100
 they go more for the good dad qualities.

43:57.100 --> 43:58.520
 Is this guy dependable?

43:58.520 --> 44:00.760
 Is he gonna be a good father to my children?

44:02.180 --> 44:05.520
 And then also, in short-term mating,

44:05.520 --> 44:10.520
 women use that mate copying heuristic.

44:10.540 --> 44:13.980
 That is, if there are thousands of other women

44:13.980 --> 44:17.000
 who find them attractive, women find them attractive.

44:17.000 --> 44:19.400
 And so that's why you have the groupie phenomenon.

44:19.400 --> 44:21.420
 So with the rock stars, for example,

44:21.420 --> 44:23.460
 there are thousands of screaming women,

44:23.460 --> 44:27.560
 all of whom wanna sleep with this famous rock star,

44:27.560 --> 44:29.100
 and they use that as information.

44:29.100 --> 44:32.080
 They find, if you took like a still photo

44:32.080 --> 44:33.520
 of some of these rock stars

44:33.520 --> 44:35.960
 and asked women how attractive the guy is

44:35.960 --> 44:38.520
 versus tell him he's a famous rock star

44:38.520 --> 44:42.080
 and showed the thousands of women screaming at him,

44:42.080 --> 44:44.840
 they judge him entirely differently

44:44.840 --> 44:47.720
 in terms of his attractiveness.

44:47.720 --> 44:52.720
 And so even, and this is an important point,

44:54.000 --> 44:57.960
 that women's attraction to men is more context-specific

44:57.960 --> 45:00.720
 and varies more across contexts

45:00.720 --> 45:03.400
 than men's attraction to women.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.320
 And so I'll give you just an example of that.

45:05.320 --> 45:09.020
 This is a female colleague of mine went to a conference,

45:09.020 --> 45:12.240
 an academic conference, and she found the organizer

45:12.240 --> 45:14.320
 of this conference to be really attractive.

45:14.320 --> 45:17.600
 And then saw him six months later,

45:17.600 --> 45:19.640
 and wondered, well, what was I thinking?

45:19.640 --> 45:21.480
 He doesn't seem very attractive at all.

45:21.480 --> 45:23.540
 And what it was is when he was the organizer,

45:23.540 --> 45:26.520
 he was at the center of the attention structure.

45:26.520 --> 45:30.040
 You know, he was the guy up on stage directing everybody

45:30.040 --> 45:31.760
 and everyone was attending to him.

45:31.760 --> 45:35.200
 And then when he was just a normal presenter at a conference,

45:35.200 --> 45:38.600
 he didn't command the attention structure

45:38.600 --> 45:40.800
 like he did in that when he was the organizer.

45:40.800 --> 45:43.080
 And so this is just an illustration

45:43.080 --> 45:47.920
 of how circumstance-dependent women's attraction,

45:47.920 --> 45:49.800
 mate attraction is for guys.

45:49.800 --> 45:54.000
 It depends on, you know, his status,

45:54.000 --> 45:57.280
 the number of women that are attracted to him.

45:57.280 --> 46:00.440
 The attention structure is how he interacts

46:00.440 --> 46:02.720
 with a puppy or a baby.

46:02.720 --> 46:04.800
 If he's ignoring a baby in distress

46:04.800 --> 46:07.860
 or positively interacting with a young child.

46:07.860 --> 46:11.700
 So all these things, whereas for men,

46:11.700 --> 46:13.380
 it almost doesn't matter.

46:13.380 --> 46:15.300
 You know, context is more irrelevant.

46:15.300 --> 46:19.220
 They're honing in on the specific psychophysical cues

46:19.220 --> 46:23.180
 that the woman is displaying in context be damned.

46:23.180 --> 46:24.280
 Very interesting.

46:26.780 --> 46:31.780
 Let's talk about infidelity in committed relationships.

46:31.900 --> 46:35.620
 What are some of the consistent findings

46:35.620 --> 46:40.620
 around reasons for, and maybe even long-term consequences

46:41.140 --> 46:43.740
 of infidelity for men and women?

46:43.740 --> 46:46.860
 And this could be marriage or long-term partnership

46:46.860 --> 46:49.380
 or infidelity of any kind, I suppose.

46:49.380 --> 46:50.220
 Yeah, so well-

46:50.220 --> 46:51.420
 I'm guessing it does happen.

46:51.420 --> 46:53.140
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:53.140 --> 46:54.120
 How frequent is it?

46:54.120 --> 46:55.800
 Yeah, that's the interesting thing.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.840
 Well, how frequent it is is difficult to gauge

46:58.840 --> 47:03.840
 because it's one of the forms of human conduct

47:03.840 --> 47:07.120
 that people like to keep secret.

47:07.120 --> 47:11.280
 So if you go back now, let's say 70 years

47:11.280 --> 47:13.680
 to the classic Kinsey studies,

47:13.680 --> 47:17.080
 the questions about infidelity were the questions

47:17.080 --> 47:19.780
 that most people refused to answer.

47:19.780 --> 47:21.800
 And when the question was brought up,

47:21.800 --> 47:24.040
 caused more people to drop out of the study.

47:24.040 --> 47:26.120
 And so that kind of tells you something that,

47:26.120 --> 47:28.440
 I mean, what do people conceal?

47:28.440 --> 47:31.420
 You know, infidelity, incest, murder.

47:31.420 --> 47:33.720
 You know, there is a small handful of things

47:33.720 --> 47:35.760
 that people universally want to conceal

47:35.760 --> 47:39.680
 and infidelity is one of them, but people do it.

47:39.680 --> 47:43.640
 And so Kinsey estimated 26% of married women

47:43.640 --> 47:46.280
 committed an infidelity at some point during their marriage

47:46.280 --> 47:48.380
 and about 50% of men.

47:48.380 --> 47:51.160
 Other studies have given lower figures.

47:51.160 --> 47:54.000
 And so the exact figures bounce around

47:54.000 --> 47:57.280
 depending on anonymity provided

47:57.280 --> 48:00.020
 and how comfortable they are with the interviewer

48:00.020 --> 48:01.120
 and so forth.

48:01.120 --> 48:03.380
 And by infidelity, does that mean intercourse

48:03.380 --> 48:04.600
 with somebody else?

48:04.600 --> 48:07.700
 So we're not talking about quote unquote emotional affairs.

48:07.700 --> 48:10.920
 We're talking about sex with somebody

48:10.920 --> 48:12.200
 other than their committed partner

48:12.200 --> 48:13.640
 with unbeknownst to their partner.

48:13.640 --> 48:14.460
 Right, right.

48:14.460 --> 48:15.800
 And there are other forms of infidelity

48:15.800 --> 48:18.620
 which we could get into, including emotional infidelity

48:18.620 --> 48:20.320
 and financial infidelity.

48:20.320 --> 48:22.040
 But here we're just talking about,

48:22.040 --> 48:24.340
 for the moment, sexual infidelity.

48:24.340 --> 48:28.240
 And the interesting thing about sexual infidelity

48:28.240 --> 48:32.880
 is that the sexes really differ fundamentally

48:32.880 --> 48:36.480
 in the motives for committing infidelity.

48:36.480 --> 48:40.320
 So for men, the primary motive,

48:40.320 --> 48:43.160
 and these are on average sex differences.

48:43.160 --> 48:44.840
 So whenever I talk about sex differences,

48:44.840 --> 48:47.360
 I'm talking about on average sex differences

48:47.360 --> 48:50.040
 because there's overlap in the distributions.

48:51.280 --> 48:53.120
 But so these are generalizations

48:53.120 --> 48:54.600
 of which there are exceptions.

48:54.600 --> 48:59.600
 So for men, it's mainly a matter of sexual variety.

48:59.600 --> 49:04.600
 So about 70% of the men, the opportunity presented itself.

49:04.740 --> 49:07.340
 I was out of town and I had this opportunity.

49:07.340 --> 49:12.340
 So low risk, low cost, pursuit of sexual variety,

49:12.340 --> 49:15.340
 sexual novelty is a key motivation for men.

49:15.340 --> 49:16.180
 Sorry to interrupt.

49:16.180 --> 49:19.060
 I just want to, so 70% of men that cheat,

49:19.060 --> 49:22.020
 that's the primary cause,

49:22.020 --> 49:25.020
 or is it that 70% of men do cheat?

49:25.020 --> 49:25.860
 No, no, no.

49:25.860 --> 49:30.860
 Of the men who cheat 70%, thank you for that clarification.

49:31.340 --> 49:35.560
 Of the men who do cheat 70%, cite that as the key motive,

49:36.400 --> 49:39.100
 the key reason why they committed an infidelity.

49:39.100 --> 49:40.980
 Sort of like why mountain climbers climb mountains

49:40.980 --> 49:42.020
 because they're there.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.340
 Right, right, because they're there.

49:43.340 --> 49:46.760
 If they, well, the comedian, I think it was Chris Rock,

49:46.760 --> 49:50.120
 said men are only as faithful as their opportunity.

49:50.120 --> 49:53.980
 Or how available their password on their phone is

49:53.980 --> 49:55.020
 to their partner.

49:55.020 --> 49:56.860
 Right, right, yeah.

49:56.860 --> 49:58.260
 And that's an exaggeration.

49:58.260 --> 50:02.160
 But if you look at women,

50:03.000 --> 50:06.620
 this just desire for pure novelty, sexual variety,

50:06.620 --> 50:08.660
 is much less of a motive.

50:10.660 --> 50:15.300
 But women who have affairs cite that they're unhappy

50:15.300 --> 50:19.740
 with their primary relationship, emotionally unhappy,

50:19.740 --> 50:22.620
 or sexually unhappy, and typically both.

50:22.620 --> 50:25.440
 And this may seem like totally obvious that,

50:25.440 --> 50:27.260
 well, of course, people if they're unhappy

50:27.260 --> 50:29.780
 in the relationship are more likely to stray.

50:29.780 --> 50:32.300
 But in fact, it's not true for men.

50:32.300 --> 50:35.660
 So if you compare men who are happy with their marriage

50:35.660 --> 50:37.500
 and men who are not happy with their marriage,

50:37.500 --> 50:39.980
 there's no difference in their infidelity rates.

50:39.980 --> 50:42.760
 And I think it goes down to that issue of,

50:44.380 --> 50:46.620
 motive for seeking variety.

50:46.620 --> 50:49.460
 So now, why do women do it?

50:49.460 --> 50:52.740
 Because it's a risky endeavor.

50:52.740 --> 50:56.900
 She risks her long-term mate, or losing long-term mate.

50:56.900 --> 51:00.400
 It's risky in terms of reputational damage for both sexes.

51:01.300 --> 51:02.220
 So it's a risky thing.

51:02.220 --> 51:03.580
 Why do women do it?

51:05.060 --> 51:09.620
 And there are two competing hypotheses, at least two,

51:09.620 --> 51:12.020
 but there are two primary competing hypotheses

51:12.020 --> 51:13.820
 in the evolutionary literature.

51:13.820 --> 51:16.700
 One is called the dual mating strategy hypothesis

51:16.700 --> 51:20.620
 where women are seeking to get resources and investment

51:20.620 --> 51:24.620
 from one guy and good genes from another guy.

51:24.620 --> 51:28.580
 So, and in principle, that can work.

51:28.580 --> 51:32.460
 And I initially, this wasn't a hypothesis original with me.

51:32.460 --> 51:35.260
 This is Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,

51:35.260 --> 51:38.440
 and some others of Marty Hazleton, a former student of mine,

51:38.440 --> 51:41.860
 have advocated this dual mating strategy hypothesis.

51:41.860 --> 51:45.700
 And originally, I was endorsed it

51:45.700 --> 51:48.140
 because the data seemed to support it.

51:48.140 --> 51:50.740
 We can get into which data seemed to support it.

51:50.740 --> 51:53.820
 But over time, I became more and more dubious

51:53.820 --> 51:57.860
 about this hypothesis and instead have advocated

51:57.860 --> 52:00.700
 what I call the mate switching hypothesis.

52:00.700 --> 52:05.700
 And so if you look at a whole host of information

52:06.060 --> 52:08.380
 around why women have affairs,

52:08.380 --> 52:12.500
 it's not compatible with the dual mating strategy hypothesis

52:12.500 --> 52:14.320
 and is compatible with the mate switching.

52:14.320 --> 52:19.320
 That is, women who are looking to either divest themselves

52:20.580 --> 52:25.580
 from an existing mateship or trade up in the mating market

52:26.340 --> 52:28.820
 to a mate who's more compatible with them

52:28.820 --> 52:30.620
 or higher in mate value,

52:30.620 --> 52:34.540
 or simply see whether they're sufficiently desirable

52:34.540 --> 52:38.460
 so that it eases the transition into the mating pool,

52:38.460 --> 52:41.900
 or keeping a mate as a potential backup mate,

52:41.900 --> 52:44.220
 what I call mate insurance.

52:44.220 --> 52:46.300
 So you have car insurance if something bad happens

52:46.300 --> 52:49.180
 to your car, house insurance.

52:49.180 --> 52:50.900
 We also have mate insurance, you know,

52:50.900 --> 52:54.860
 keeping someone, one woman said, men are like soup.

52:54.860 --> 52:57.700
 You always want to have one on the back burner.

52:57.700 --> 53:02.700
 So, whether that's the best analogy or not,

53:03.220 --> 53:08.060
 I'm not sure, but it kind of captures something about why.

53:08.060 --> 53:11.520
 So, well, what evidence am I talking about?

53:11.520 --> 53:13.440
 Well, for one thing, women who have affairs,

53:13.440 --> 53:16.780
 and this is about 70% of them, they-

53:16.780 --> 53:18.860
 70, again, sorry, just I want to make sure people,

53:18.860 --> 53:20.700
 of women who have affairs, yeah.

53:20.700 --> 53:21.540
 Of the women who have affairs.

53:21.540 --> 53:26.100
 So let's say Ballpark Kinsey was, let's say, roughly right.

53:26.100 --> 53:28.680
 25, 26% of women will have affairs.

53:28.680 --> 53:30.300
 Let's just assume that he's right.

53:30.300 --> 53:32.180
 And we don't know exactly,

53:33.300 --> 53:35.620
 but of the women who do have affairs,

53:35.620 --> 53:39.500
 about 70% say they have fallen in love

53:39.500 --> 53:41.020
 with their affair partner.

53:41.020 --> 53:43.940
 They become deeply emotionally involved with their affair

53:43.940 --> 53:46.860
 partner, and to me,

53:46.860 --> 53:50.620
 if you're just trying to get good genes from a guy,

53:50.620 --> 53:52.260
 that is the last thing you want to do,

53:52.260 --> 53:55.740
 is fall in love with them or get emotionally involved,

53:55.740 --> 53:58.780
 but it's very compatible if you want to switch mates.

53:59.760 --> 54:04.760
 And so, that's one piece of evidence that suggests

54:04.900 --> 54:09.860
 that women, the mate switching function of infidelity,

54:09.860 --> 54:12.200
 is a more likely explanation.

54:12.200 --> 54:15.140
 Now, these two are not inherently incompatible hypotheses.

54:15.140 --> 54:18.500
 In other words, it's possible that some women

54:18.500 --> 54:22.100
 do pursue a dual mating strategy hypothesis,

54:22.100 --> 54:24.640
 but there's other evidence that suggests,

54:24.640 --> 54:27.520
 so for example, what are the actual rates

54:27.520 --> 54:29.180
 of genetic cuckoldry?

54:29.180 --> 54:32.580
 Well, in the modern environment anyway, they're pretty low.

54:32.580 --> 54:34.740
 It turns out they're like 2 to 3%.

54:34.740 --> 54:36.060
 Could you just explain for the audience

54:36.060 --> 54:37.340
 what genetic cuckoldry is?

54:37.340 --> 54:42.020
 So, this is where the woman, where the man believes

54:42.020 --> 54:43.980
 he is the genetic father of a child,

54:43.980 --> 54:45.540
 but it turns out he's not.

54:45.540 --> 54:47.460
 Might be the mailman or the next door neighbor

54:47.460 --> 54:49.900
 or the guy she's having an affair with.

54:49.900 --> 54:53.640
 So, mistaken paternity.

54:54.540 --> 54:59.420
 And genetic cuckoldry is just one way to capture-

54:59.420 --> 55:01.220
 Named after the cuckoo bird, right?

55:01.220 --> 55:02.820
 Named after the cuckoo bird, yes.

55:02.820 --> 55:05.140
 Who sneaks its eggs into the nest of the other,

55:05.140 --> 55:09.100
 rolls, destroys the future offspring of the bird

55:09.100 --> 55:11.820
 and then basically offloads all the work

55:11.820 --> 55:13.700
 onto another father.

55:13.700 --> 55:16.900
 Parasitizes, yeah, the parental investment

55:16.900 --> 55:19.980
 of different bird species.

55:19.980 --> 55:23.780
 So, anyway, so I think that,

55:23.780 --> 55:27.180
 and there's other sources of evidence that I think point,

55:27.180 --> 55:30.620
 so one of the sources of evidence that initially seemed

55:30.620 --> 55:34.060
 to support the dual mating strategy hypothesis

55:34.060 --> 55:36.300
 was ovulation shifts.

55:36.300 --> 55:40.700
 So, in other words, it looked like from the early studies

55:40.700 --> 55:42.180
 that when women are ovulating,

55:42.180 --> 55:45.060
 these are among non pill-taking women,

55:45.060 --> 55:47.500
 women not on hormonal contraceptives,

55:47.500 --> 55:50.420
 that they experienced a preference shift toward more men

55:50.420 --> 55:53.740
 who were masculine and symmetrical,

55:53.740 --> 55:57.420
 which were hypothesized markers for good genes.

55:57.420 --> 55:59.700
 And there's an explanation for that.

56:00.540 --> 56:03.260
 But it turns out the effects of ovulation

56:03.260 --> 56:05.700
 on women's mate preferences are far weaker

56:05.700 --> 56:08.860
 than the initial studies looked like.

56:08.860 --> 56:11.220
 And in fact, some larger scale studies have failed

56:11.220 --> 56:13.220
 to replicate them entirely.

56:13.220 --> 56:18.100
 And so, that was one of the key sources of evidence,

56:18.100 --> 56:21.140
 these ovulation shifts that women were going after good genes

56:21.140 --> 56:24.260
 because it's only when she's ovulating

56:24.260 --> 56:28.900
 and she can get pregnant by having sex with another man,

56:28.900 --> 56:30.740
 that it would make sense for her to have sex

56:30.740 --> 56:31.980
 with another man.

56:31.980 --> 56:33.980
 And there was even some early evidence

56:33.980 --> 56:37.260
 that women were timing their affairs,

56:37.260 --> 56:39.180
 timing sex with their affair partners

56:39.180 --> 56:42.180
 to coincide with when they were ovulating.

56:42.180 --> 56:44.580
 But as I said, some of these subsequent studies

56:44.580 --> 56:47.340
 have failed to replicate these early findings

56:47.340 --> 56:51.180
 calling into question the dual mating strategy notion.

56:51.180 --> 56:54.500
 And so, I think I've shifted my views on this

56:55.500 --> 56:59.500
 and now endorse the mate switching hypothesis

56:59.500 --> 57:03.940
 as a more likely explanation for why most women have affairs.

57:03.940 --> 57:06.980
 Well, the way you described this makes me wonder if

57:07.980 --> 57:10.500
 when of the women that have affairs,

57:10.500 --> 57:13.020
 do those affairs tend to be more long lasting

57:13.020 --> 57:14.420
 than the affairs that men have?

57:14.420 --> 57:15.780
 Because the way you described it is

57:15.780 --> 57:17.860
 men are seizing an opportunity

57:17.860 --> 57:21.020
 to sort of a carpe diem type approach to infidelity

57:21.020 --> 57:25.500
 and women potentially on average are capitalizing

57:25.500 --> 57:27.860
 on something that is longer term.

57:27.860 --> 57:30.860
 Now, of course, if they're doing this around ovulation,

57:30.860 --> 57:32.580
 then it would constrain the amount of times

57:32.580 --> 57:34.380
 they would need to see or have sex

57:34.380 --> 57:38.100
 with this other person that they're not married to.

57:38.100 --> 57:39.700
 But is there any evidence

57:39.700 --> 57:41.380
 that women have more ongoing affairs

57:41.380 --> 57:43.780
 and men have more transient affairs?

57:43.780 --> 57:45.020
 Yes, yeah, there is.

57:45.020 --> 57:49.100
 And so, if you look at people who have affairs,

57:49.100 --> 57:50.780
 there's a sex difference there

57:50.780 --> 57:54.860
 so that women tend to have affairs with one person

57:54.860 --> 57:57.140
 and become emotionally involved with that one person

57:57.140 --> 57:58.380
 over time.

57:58.380 --> 58:01.340
 Men who have affairs tend to have affairs

58:01.340 --> 58:04.100
 with a larger number of affair partners.

58:04.100 --> 58:07.660
 And so, which then by definition can't be long lasting.

58:07.660 --> 58:09.340
 You can't have long-term affairs

58:09.340 --> 58:10.660
 with six different partners.

58:10.660 --> 58:14.740
 Yeah, unless he's juggling multiple phone accounts

58:14.740 --> 58:15.580
 or something of that sort.

58:15.580 --> 58:16.420
 Right, right, right.

58:16.420 --> 58:17.260
 And some men try to do that,

58:17.260 --> 58:21.260
 but I think it could be very taxing.

58:21.260 --> 58:22.940
 Yeah, well, and in this day and age,

58:22.940 --> 58:27.140
 it's easier to meet more people by virtue

58:27.140 --> 58:28.540
 of online communications,

58:28.540 --> 58:30.500
 but it's also easier to get caught,

58:30.500 --> 58:33.700
 meaning it's harder to conceal interactions.

58:33.700 --> 58:35.060
 Everything's in the cloud anyway.

58:35.060 --> 58:35.900
 A good friend of mine,

58:35.900 --> 58:39.980
 who's a former very high level in special operations said,

58:39.980 --> 58:43.100
 anything that's not in your head and only in your head

58:43.100 --> 58:46.580
 is available for others to find should they want it.

58:46.580 --> 58:47.420
 Yeah.

58:47.420 --> 58:48.900
 And I think that's largely true.

58:48.900 --> 58:53.900
 Yeah, and yeah, so fun information, text messages,

58:54.700 --> 58:57.900
 and people are very good at hacking into their partners,

58:57.900 --> 58:59.220
 phones, computers,

58:59.220 --> 59:01.100
 and then also there are video cameras everywhere.

59:01.100 --> 59:05.420
 So, sneaking off to this, a quiet restaurant,

59:05.420 --> 59:07.620
 I mean, there are probably eight video cameras

59:07.620 --> 59:11.540
 that can record you walking in and out of that restaurant.

59:11.540 --> 59:13.060
 Everything can be found.

59:13.060 --> 59:13.900
 Yes.

59:13.900 --> 59:15.020
 I'm certain of that.

59:15.020 --> 59:17.100
 You mentioned emotional affairs

59:17.100 --> 59:19.300
 and financial infidelity as well.

59:19.300 --> 59:20.300
 Yes.

59:20.300 --> 59:25.140
 I had a girlfriend once who, as a early date discussion,

59:25.140 --> 59:29.220
 said, not that I get the impression that you are,

59:29.220 --> 59:30.540
 but I want to be very clear.

59:30.540 --> 59:34.060
 She said that you are not emotionally, physically,

59:34.060 --> 59:36.420
 or financially tied to any other women.

59:36.420 --> 59:37.580
 And I thought it was very interesting

59:37.580 --> 59:39.700
 that now you bring up financial infidelity.

59:39.700 --> 59:43.700
 She's quite happily partnered now and not with me,

59:43.700 --> 59:45.820
 but it's interesting.

59:45.820 --> 59:47.860
 It was the first time I heard anyone spell it out that way

59:47.860 --> 59:50.220
 as a list, almost like specific aims in a grant.

59:52.140 --> 59:53.660
 What is emotional infidelity?

59:53.660 --> 59:55.540
 What is financial infidelity?

59:55.540 --> 59:56.380
 Yeah, yeah.

59:56.380 --> 59:59.460
 Well, this is a very smart woman to tap into all three.

59:59.460 --> 1:00:00.300
 Indeed she is.

1:00:00.300 --> 1:00:03.940
 So, and I assumed you gave honest responses

1:00:03.940 --> 1:00:05.660
 to all of those three questions.

1:00:05.660 --> 1:00:09.260
 As I recall, I did, but as we now know that there,

1:00:09.260 --> 1:00:10.700
 well, you can ask her at some point.

1:00:10.700 --> 1:00:11.540
 Right, right.

1:00:11.540 --> 1:00:12.380
 I'm happy to provide you her information.

1:00:12.380 --> 1:00:15.940
 Yeah, and there is self-deception in the service of deception

1:00:15.940 --> 1:00:16.980
 that is another issue.

1:00:16.980 --> 1:00:20.380
 So emotional infidelity is basically

1:00:20.380 --> 1:00:21.700
 exactly what it sounds like.

1:00:21.700 --> 1:00:23.780
 It's falling in love with someone else,

1:00:23.780 --> 1:00:27.200
 becoming psychologically close to someone else,

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:32.200
 sharing intimate or private information with someone else.

1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:34.780
 That's what I mean by emotional infidelity.

1:00:34.780 --> 1:00:36.860
 And one of the hallmarks of this,

1:00:36.860 --> 1:00:41.420
 a study done by a former student of mine, Barry Cooley,

1:00:41.420 --> 1:00:42.740
 was very clever, I thought.

1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:45.860
 He analyzed, there used to be this reality TV show

1:00:45.860 --> 1:00:49.780
 called Cheaters, where they would hire detectives

1:00:49.780 --> 1:00:52.400
 and they would, when the detective would like say,

1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:54.200
 follow someone to a hotel room,

1:00:54.200 --> 1:00:57.200
 they'd call up the partner and say,

1:00:57.200 --> 1:01:00.180
 your husband just walked into the hotel room

1:01:00.180 --> 1:01:02.660
 with someone else, would you like to come down

1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:04.320
 to the hotel and confront him?

1:01:04.320 --> 1:01:07.380
 And a certain percentage of people would confront.

1:01:07.380 --> 1:01:10.480
 And what he analyzed, so he analyzed all these episodes

1:01:10.480 --> 1:01:12.740
 of this show called Cheaters,

1:01:12.740 --> 1:01:16.200
 and what he examined was the verbal interrogations

1:01:16.200 --> 1:01:18.340
 when people confronted their partners.

1:01:18.340 --> 1:01:20.860
 And when men confronted their partners,

1:01:20.860 --> 1:01:23.320
 the first question they wanted to know is,

1:01:23.320 --> 1:01:24.320
 did you fuck him?

1:01:25.340 --> 1:01:29.500
 Women, their first question was, do you love her?

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:32.420
 And so this kind of captures that difference

1:01:32.420 --> 1:01:35.020
 between a sexual infidelity and emotional infidelity,

1:01:35.020 --> 1:01:38.340
 and also kind of captures another sex difference

1:01:38.340 --> 1:01:40.540
 when it comes to sexual jealousy,

1:01:40.540 --> 1:01:42.580
 where men tend to be more focused

1:01:42.580 --> 1:01:46.580
 on the sexual components of the infidelity,

1:01:46.580 --> 1:01:51.580
 because those are what compromise his paternity certainty,

1:01:51.900 --> 1:01:55.180
 his certainty that he's actually the genetic father

1:01:55.180 --> 1:01:58.820
 of whatever offspring ensue.

1:01:58.820 --> 1:02:03.140
 Whereas love is a cue to, do you love her?

1:02:03.140 --> 1:02:06.180
 That's a cue that he's gonna leave you, the woman,

1:02:06.180 --> 1:02:11.180
 for another woman as a cue to the long-term loss

1:02:11.380 --> 1:02:15.500
 of that investment and commitment from that partner.

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:18.140
 And so the sexes seem to differ

1:02:19.180 --> 1:02:22.180
 in which aspects of the infidelity

1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:25.060
 with women were attuned to or more upset

1:02:25.060 --> 1:02:26.660
 by the emotional infidelity,

1:02:26.660 --> 1:02:29.400
 men more by the sexual infidelity.

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:31.880
 Now, financial infidelity has been explored much less,

1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:35.900
 but in my new book, When Men Behave Badly,

1:02:35.900 --> 1:02:38.780
 I have a section on financial infidelity

1:02:38.780 --> 1:02:41.340
 where I summarize all the research that has been done.

1:02:41.340 --> 1:02:45.060
 And I was kind of flabbergasted by the percentage of people

1:02:45.060 --> 1:02:47.620
 who do things like have credit cards

1:02:47.620 --> 1:02:49.500
 that their spouse doesn't know about,

1:02:49.500 --> 1:02:51.540
 keep secret bank accounts,

1:02:51.540 --> 1:02:53.840
 have the credit card bills mailed to their office

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:55.920
 rather than their home,

1:02:55.920 --> 1:03:00.920
 have basically resources and expenditures of pooled resources

1:03:02.740 --> 1:03:04.540
 that they keep from their partner.

1:03:04.540 --> 1:03:06.660
 And both sexes do it.

1:03:06.660 --> 1:03:10.060
 And the percentages vary from study to study,

1:03:10.060 --> 1:03:13.520
 but they range from like 30 to 60% of all people

1:03:13.520 --> 1:03:18.300
 who are keeping financial information from their spouse

1:03:18.300 --> 1:03:19.140
 in one way or another.

1:03:19.140 --> 1:03:22.260
 It could be the woman's out buying designer purses

1:03:22.260 --> 1:03:23.780
 or designer handbags.

1:03:24.940 --> 1:03:28.260
 It could be the guy's out going to strip clubs

1:03:28.260 --> 1:03:31.960
 or taking his affair partner to restaurants

1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:34.620
 and doesn't want those charges to show up on,

1:03:34.620 --> 1:03:37.540
 you know, a jointly held credit card.

1:03:37.540 --> 1:03:40.580
 So financial infidelity is critical.

1:03:40.580 --> 1:03:44.340
 And then even things like diverting pooled resources

1:03:44.340 --> 1:03:48.260
 to one set of genetic relatives versus another set

1:03:48.260 --> 1:03:52.000
 is another thing that people tend to keep secret.

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:56.360
 So there are forms of financial infidelity as well.

1:03:56.360 --> 1:03:58.460
 So yeah, infidelity, you're absolutely,

1:03:58.460 --> 1:04:01.540
 it's a great question because it shouldn't be confined

1:04:01.540 --> 1:04:05.020
 to sexual infidelity, which is what most people think about,

1:04:05.020 --> 1:04:07.620
 but also emotional and financial.

1:04:07.620 --> 1:04:11.780
 Interestingly, if you ask people, what do you mean,

1:04:11.780 --> 1:04:15.020
 what is infidelity in a marriage?

1:04:15.020 --> 1:04:17.660
 Men tend to say, well, it's obvious

1:04:17.660 --> 1:04:20.020
 she has sex with someone else.

1:04:20.920 --> 1:04:22.740
 That's infidelity.

1:04:22.740 --> 1:04:26.260
 Whereas women are more likely to have a broader definition

1:04:26.260 --> 1:04:28.580
 of infidelity, they will cite things like

1:04:28.580 --> 1:04:31.140
 emotional infidelity, financial infidelity

1:04:31.140 --> 1:04:32.540
 as part of the definition.

1:04:32.540 --> 1:04:35.380
 Whereas men have that more narrow definition.

1:04:35.380 --> 1:04:36.220
 Interesting.

1:04:36.220 --> 1:04:39.740
 I have a good friend who's a couples counselor,

1:04:39.740 --> 1:04:41.420
 a clinical psychologist.

1:04:41.420 --> 1:04:44.260
 And she told me something interesting that relates to this,

1:04:44.260 --> 1:04:46.800
 which is that in cases of infidelity,

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:51.080
 oftentimes some of the arguments between couples

1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:53.940
 boil down to whether or not contraception was used or not.

1:04:53.940 --> 1:04:56.180
 That becomes a key feature.

1:04:56.180 --> 1:04:59.540
 And she always thought that that was, you know,

1:04:59.540 --> 1:05:01.180
 homing in on a detail,

1:05:01.180 --> 1:05:02.540
 which of course is an important detail

1:05:02.540 --> 1:05:05.720
 as it relates to both paternity issues and pregnancy,

1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:07.940
 but also disease, right?

1:05:07.940 --> 1:05:10.220
 But as we're talking about all this,

1:05:10.220 --> 1:05:15.220
 it makes me think that this may have deeper evolutionary

1:05:15.580 --> 1:05:18.660
 roots in our, further down in the brain,

1:05:18.660 --> 1:05:21.020
 as we say in neuroscience literature.

1:05:21.020 --> 1:05:26.020
 And yeah, and using a condom versus not using a condom,

1:05:26.020 --> 1:05:29.560
 not using as a more intimate act in a way,

1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:32.820
 you were literally physically more intimate

1:05:32.820 --> 1:05:35.740
 with someone else than if you do use a condom.

1:05:35.740 --> 1:05:38.780
 So, you know, but whether it's,

1:05:38.780 --> 1:05:41.820
 whether evolutionary roots to this, I don't know.

1:05:41.820 --> 1:05:45.060
 I mean, condoms are probably relatively recent

1:05:45.060 --> 1:05:47.340
 in, or at least a widespread use of them,

1:05:47.340 --> 1:05:50.580
 relatively recent in evolutionary time.

1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:53.440
 So I doubt we have adaptation specifically for them.

1:05:53.440 --> 1:05:57.120
 No, and presumably before condoms, one can only speculate,

1:05:57.120 --> 1:06:00.360
 because as we say, when it comes to behavior,

1:06:00.360 --> 1:06:04.120
 there's rarely a fossil record, but sometimes there is,

1:06:04.120 --> 1:06:07.140
 it would be the withdrawal method of contraception,

1:06:07.140 --> 1:06:09.220
 which a good friend of mine who studies,

1:06:09.220 --> 1:06:11.520
 whose laboratory works on reproductive biology says,

1:06:11.520 --> 1:06:14.240
 the reason that's a poor choice of contraception

1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:16.140
 is because it was designed not to work.

1:06:16.140 --> 1:06:17.500
 Yes.

1:06:17.500 --> 1:06:21.520
 So note to those of trying to avoid unwanted pregnancy.

1:06:21.520 --> 1:06:24.140
 So we talked a little bit about status

1:06:24.140 --> 1:06:26.340
 in terms of what men and women are selecting

1:06:26.340 --> 1:06:29.660
 for different types of relationships.

1:06:30.500 --> 1:06:32.260
 Is there anything else about status

1:06:32.260 --> 1:06:34.440
 that you find particularly interesting

1:06:34.440 --> 1:06:37.780
 and, you know, what men are finding attractive

1:06:37.780 --> 1:06:39.900
 besides these, you know, waist to hip ratios

1:06:39.900 --> 1:06:44.900
 and quality of potential mothers and so forth.

1:06:46.100 --> 1:06:49.300
 Are there any kind of hidden gems in the literature

1:06:49.300 --> 1:06:52.300
 around this that I might not have heard of?

1:06:52.300 --> 1:06:53.140
 Well, yeah.

1:06:53.140 --> 1:06:57.640
 So you mean among, you know, things like sex differences

1:06:57.640 --> 1:07:00.540
 in what leads to high status or-

1:07:00.540 --> 1:07:05.540
 For instance, or what, or perhaps things that are surprising

1:07:06.180 --> 1:07:09.180
 in terms of what people are selecting for.

1:07:09.180 --> 1:07:11.040
 Do people even know what they're selecting for?

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:12.780
 This is, or is this all subconscious?

1:07:12.780 --> 1:07:15.380
 Any and all of those topics are of interest to me.

1:07:15.380 --> 1:07:18.380
 Yeah, so we'll have to take them in reverse order.

1:07:18.380 --> 1:07:21.180
 You know, I think a lot of it is conscious,

1:07:21.180 --> 1:07:23.660
 but some of it is certainly unconscious.

1:07:23.660 --> 1:07:27.260
 Or there are elements which are totally unconscious.

1:07:27.260 --> 1:07:31.100
 So I mentioned one earlier where a man looks at a woman,

1:07:31.100 --> 1:07:34.480
 he's not, he's aware that he's attracted to her

1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:36.160
 and attracted to her physical appearance,

1:07:36.160 --> 1:07:38.380
 but he might not be aware of why.

1:07:38.380 --> 1:07:40.580
 You know, we didn't evolve to be aware of why.

1:07:40.580 --> 1:07:42.420
 Just like with food preferences,

1:07:42.420 --> 1:07:44.780
 we find certain things delectable

1:07:44.780 --> 1:07:47.860
 and other things nauseating.

1:07:47.860 --> 1:07:51.740
 We don't understand the adaptive logic

1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:55.620
 of why our food preferences exist and why we have them.

1:07:55.620 --> 1:07:57.220
 And the same is true of mating, you know?

1:07:57.220 --> 1:08:02.220
 And so men find women with a low waist tip ratio attractive,

1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:07.860
 but they might not, they almost rarely,

1:08:07.860 --> 1:08:11.060
 rarely will they know, oh, low waist waist tip ratio

1:08:11.060 --> 1:08:13.860
 is actually associated with higher fertility,

1:08:13.860 --> 1:08:18.860
 lower endocrinological problems, lower age, et cetera.

1:08:20.700 --> 1:08:23.940
 So we're sometimes aware of what we want,

1:08:23.940 --> 1:08:26.660
 but we are unaware of why we want it.

1:08:27.700 --> 1:08:30.200
 So I think there are unconscious elements

1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:32.840
 that the whole topic of status

1:08:32.840 --> 1:08:35.420
 and what leads to high status and low status,

1:08:35.420 --> 1:08:37.580
 it's a topic I'm currently investigating.

1:08:37.580 --> 1:08:41.800
 Published a couple scientific articles on it and so,

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:45.460
 but maybe we'll hold off on that for a future discussion.

1:08:45.460 --> 1:08:48.420
 But it intersects, I'll mention one,

1:08:48.420 --> 1:08:51.660
 it intersects with mating in interesting ways

1:08:51.660 --> 1:08:56.660
 in that higher status gives people the ability

1:08:57.300 --> 1:09:02.300
 to choose from a wider pool of potential mates

1:09:02.300 --> 1:09:04.320
 than they would if they have low status.

1:09:05.220 --> 1:09:08.700
 And so one of the reasons that people strive for status

1:09:08.700 --> 1:09:12.180
 is because they have access to more desirable mates.

1:09:12.180 --> 1:09:17.180
 Conversely, having desirable mates

1:09:17.260 --> 1:09:19.460
 endows you with higher status.

1:09:19.460 --> 1:09:21.340
 And so if you have, if you're a male,

1:09:21.340 --> 1:09:25.160
 you have a very attractive woman on your arm

1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:26.980
 that leads to high status.

1:09:26.980 --> 1:09:28.380
 And so there's a reciprocal link

1:09:28.380 --> 1:09:30.540
 between status and mating in that way.

1:09:30.540 --> 1:09:33.540
 There've been studies where you say they pose

1:09:33.540 --> 1:09:38.000
 a kind of an unattractive guy,

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:41.540
 older unattractive guy and a stunningly beautiful woman

1:09:41.540 --> 1:09:43.460
 as a girlfriend and they say,

1:09:43.460 --> 1:09:46.500
 well, what's this guy all about?

1:09:46.500 --> 1:09:49.260
 And they say, oh, he must be very high in status,

1:09:49.260 --> 1:09:52.880
 he must be very wealthy, he must have a lot going for him.

1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:55.760
 You know, whereas the reverse,

1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:58.900
 people don't make the same attributions.

1:09:58.900 --> 1:10:02.300
 And so there is an interesting reciprocal link

1:10:02.300 --> 1:10:04.620
 between status and mating success

1:10:04.620 --> 1:10:07.540
 where mating success leads to high status

1:10:07.540 --> 1:10:10.580
 and high status leads to more mating success.

1:10:10.580 --> 1:10:11.800
 So over and over again,

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:13.540
 there are these instances that you described

1:10:13.540 --> 1:10:16.900
 where the assessment of potential mate sexual

1:10:16.900 --> 1:10:20.480
 or long-term partnership are being made

1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:23.000
 in the contents of good statistical practices,

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:24.700
 looking at the choices of others

1:10:24.700 --> 1:10:27.260
 as a readout of your own choices.

1:10:27.260 --> 1:10:28.840
 I keep, this seems to be a theme

1:10:28.840 --> 1:10:31.620
 that this is not being made in a very narrow context,

1:10:31.620 --> 1:10:32.940
 but paying attention to what other people

1:10:32.940 --> 1:10:37.660
 are paying attention to seems to come up again and again.

1:10:37.660 --> 1:10:39.160
 Slightly off center from that,

1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:40.100
 but still paying attention

1:10:40.100 --> 1:10:43.180
 to what other people are paying attention to.

1:10:43.180 --> 1:10:46.080
 What's known about jealousy in men versus women

1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:50.380
 and how frequent it is, how intense it is,

1:10:50.380 --> 1:10:52.460
 and what people do with that jealousy.

1:10:52.460 --> 1:10:55.220
 I mean, we hear, or I've heard at some point

1:10:55.220 --> 1:10:57.420
 that a large fraction of homicides

1:10:57.420 --> 1:11:00.040
 are the consequence of jealous lovers.

1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:03.600
 And that's the darkest angle of all this,

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:08.600
 but in evolutionary psychology context, what is jealousy?

1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:13.160
 Does it relate to paternity issues only?

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:14.080
 What can you tell us about jealousy?

1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:17.960
 Yeah, so, well, it's a great set of questions.

1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:20.880
 And when I first started studying jealousy,

1:11:20.880 --> 1:11:24.120
 I reviewed all the prior publications on jealousy.

1:11:24.120 --> 1:11:27.560
 And at that time, jealousy was regarded

1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:32.560
 as a sign of immaturity, a sign of insecurity,

1:11:35.400 --> 1:11:38.320
 a sign of neurosis or pathology,

1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:40.740
 or in some cases, delusion.

1:11:41.620 --> 1:11:46.160
 And what I argued is, and do argue,

1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:49.160
 is that jealousy is an evolved emotion

1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:52.720
 that serves several adaptive functions, okay?

1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:53.740
 One of which you mentioned

1:11:53.740 --> 1:11:56.240
 is a paternity certainty function.

1:11:56.240 --> 1:12:00.440
 But to back up a second,

1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:03.540
 basically, once you have the evolution of long-term mating,

1:12:03.540 --> 1:12:04.420
 long-term pair bonds,

1:12:04.420 --> 1:12:07.220
 you're talking about, from a male perspective,

1:12:07.220 --> 1:12:09.620
 investing a tremendous amount of resources

1:12:09.620 --> 1:12:13.800
 in a woman and her children over years or decades,

1:12:13.800 --> 1:12:17.820
 even with boomerang kids now may go more than two decades.

1:12:17.820 --> 1:12:18.740
 Boomerang kids?

1:12:18.740 --> 1:12:20.840
 Yeah, kids who leave home

1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:23.100
 and then come back and live at home.

1:12:23.100 --> 1:12:24.020
 That happens?

1:12:24.020 --> 1:12:25.500
 Because they, oh yeah, that happens.

1:12:25.500 --> 1:12:26.660
 I don't have children, so I-

1:12:26.660 --> 1:12:29.180
 Okay, yeah, no, that's a big thing.

1:12:29.180 --> 1:12:30.420
 But if I do, I'll just expect

1:12:30.420 --> 1:12:31.980
 that they'll come back at some point.

1:12:31.980 --> 1:12:34.120
 They'll come back because they can't find a job

1:12:34.120 --> 1:12:36.080
 or they find it cheaper to live

1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:37.540
 at the parents' house or whatever.

1:12:37.540 --> 1:12:39.100
 Oh, goodness, I can't think of anything worse.

1:12:39.100 --> 1:12:41.340
 I mean, I love my parents, but-

1:12:41.340 --> 1:12:45.200
 I know, I know, again, I can't imagine, but it happens.

1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:47.060
 And it's happening more and more

1:12:47.060 --> 1:12:49.380
 given the current economic situation.

1:12:49.380 --> 1:12:52.780
 Okay, but, so once you have long-term mating,

1:12:52.780 --> 1:12:57.620
 you need a defense to prevent

1:12:57.620 --> 1:13:00.420
 or preserve the investment that you've made

1:13:00.420 --> 1:13:02.460
 and are making in long-term mateship.

1:13:02.460 --> 1:13:06.620
 And so jealousy serves this mate-guarding function,

1:13:06.620 --> 1:13:08.940
 if you will, or mate-retention function.

1:13:08.940 --> 1:13:11.940
 So in other words, one way of phrasing this

1:13:11.940 --> 1:13:14.900
 is that we know that there are affairs,

1:13:14.900 --> 1:13:17.300
 we know that people break up, they get divorced,

1:13:18.220 --> 1:13:20.700
 but people have adaptations

1:13:20.700 --> 1:13:23.860
 to want to hold on to their mates, okay?

1:13:23.860 --> 1:13:25.780
 And that's what jealousy is in part about.

1:13:25.780 --> 1:13:29.180
 And so jealousy gets activated when there are threats

1:13:29.180 --> 1:13:32.260
 to that romantic relationship.

1:13:32.260 --> 1:13:33.420
 And there are other forms of jealousy,

1:13:33.420 --> 1:13:35.060
 like sibling jealousy and so forth,

1:13:35.060 --> 1:13:38.420
 but we're focusing on mating jealousy in this context.

1:13:38.420 --> 1:13:42.820
 So now what's interesting is that the threats

1:13:42.820 --> 1:13:46.420
 to an ongoing valued romantic relationship

1:13:46.420 --> 1:13:48.120
 come from many sources.

1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:51.220
 So they could be, you detect cues to your partner's

1:13:51.220 --> 1:13:56.220
 infidelity or cues of a lack of an emotional distance

1:13:58.920 --> 1:14:00.460
 between you and your partner.

1:14:00.460 --> 1:14:03.020
 You say, I love you to your partner,

1:14:03.020 --> 1:14:06.260
 and your partner says, oh, I wonder how the Knicks

1:14:06.260 --> 1:14:08.420
 are doing this scoring season or whatever.

1:14:08.420 --> 1:14:11.540
 If you get an unreciprocated I love you is a bad cue.

1:14:11.540 --> 1:14:13.820
 Or some people are so tuned to this,

1:14:13.820 --> 1:14:16.220
 if there's a half millisecond delay,

1:14:16.220 --> 1:14:18.260
 they can detect delays in responses.

1:14:18.260 --> 1:14:20.820
 Yes, yeah, delays in responses.

1:14:20.820 --> 1:14:25.180
 But even things like, so that's one set of cues.

1:14:25.180 --> 1:14:28.420
 But then there's another set of interested mate poachers.

1:14:28.420 --> 1:14:32.300
 So if you're mated to someone who's desirable,

1:14:32.300 --> 1:14:35.300
 which many people are, other people still desire them.

1:14:35.300 --> 1:14:38.980
 And so sometimes try to poach them or lure them away

1:14:38.980 --> 1:14:42.100
 from you for a short term sexual encounter

1:14:42.100 --> 1:14:44.700
 or for a longer term relationship.

1:14:44.700 --> 1:14:47.540
 And so we have to be, so jealousy motivates people

1:14:47.540 --> 1:14:49.940
 to be attentive to potential mate poachers

1:14:49.940 --> 1:14:51.740
 in their environment.

1:14:51.740 --> 1:14:56.660
 But even more subtle things like mate value discrepancies

1:14:56.660 --> 1:14:58.300
 can trigger jealousy.

1:14:58.300 --> 1:15:00.220
 So even if there are no mate poachers

1:15:00.220 --> 1:15:05.000
 and no cues to infidelity, if a mate value discrepancy

1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:08.420
 opens up in a relationship, so in the American system

1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:11.640
 like you're a six or an eight or a 10,

1:15:11.640 --> 1:15:14.940
 and people generally pair off based on similarity

1:15:14.940 --> 1:15:15.780
 and mate value.

1:15:15.780 --> 1:15:16.740
 So that tends to happen.

1:15:16.740 --> 1:15:19.300
 Sixes end up with sixes, sevens end up with sixes,

1:15:19.300 --> 1:15:20.300
 plus or minus one.

1:15:20.300 --> 1:15:21.140
 Yeah, yeah.

1:15:21.140 --> 1:15:21.960
 Right.

1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:22.800
 So yeah.

1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:23.640
 And these are somewhat subjective scare.

1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:24.580
 Okay, it's somewhat subjective,

1:15:24.580 --> 1:15:27.400
 but there's still some consensus about these things.

1:15:27.400 --> 1:15:32.180
 So even colloquially people say things like,

1:15:33.120 --> 1:15:35.260
 he's not good enough for you,

1:15:35.260 --> 1:15:38.340
 or I think you could do better to people

1:15:38.340 --> 1:15:41.500
 and implicitly have a notion of relative mate value

1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:43.180
 and discrepancies therein.

1:15:43.180 --> 1:15:45.700
 Okay, but discrepancies can open up

1:15:45.700 --> 1:15:47.780
 where none previously existed.

1:15:47.780 --> 1:15:51.540
 So you get fired from a job all of a sudden,

1:15:51.540 --> 1:15:54.820
 and most people are very understanding and forgiving

1:15:54.820 --> 1:15:57.460
 about that if it's not too long.

1:15:57.460 --> 1:15:59.220
 But you go six months, eight months,

1:15:59.220 --> 1:16:01.940
 people start having problems.

1:16:01.940 --> 1:16:03.880
 Or someone's career takes off.

1:16:03.880 --> 1:16:06.820
 Let's say a woman becomes a famous singer

1:16:06.820 --> 1:16:10.060
 or actress or a man does.

1:16:10.060 --> 1:16:10.900
 Career takes off.

1:16:10.900 --> 1:16:13.260
 All of a sudden there's a mate value discrepancy

1:16:13.260 --> 1:16:16.380
 where you have access to a larger pool of potential mates

1:16:16.380 --> 1:16:18.580
 and higher mate value potential mates.

1:16:18.580 --> 1:16:22.220
 So people are attentive to mate value discrepancies,

1:16:22.220 --> 1:16:24.700
 and so jealousy can get activated

1:16:24.700 --> 1:16:28.740
 even if there are no immediate threats to a relationship,

1:16:28.740 --> 1:16:31.020
 but that the mate value discrepancy

1:16:31.020 --> 1:16:34.860
 is a threat that looms on the horizon of the relationship

1:16:34.860 --> 1:16:38.820
 because we know statistically the higher mate value person

1:16:38.820 --> 1:16:41.340
 is more likely to have an affair

1:16:41.340 --> 1:16:44.220
 and is more likely to dump the other person

1:16:44.220 --> 1:16:46.140
 and trade up in the mating market.

1:16:46.140 --> 1:16:49.420
 And when people find new partners

1:16:49.420 --> 1:16:52.920
 for long-term relationships, do they tend to trade up?

1:16:52.920 --> 1:16:56.220
 On average, yes, if the discrepancy

1:16:56.220 --> 1:16:57.380
 is sufficiently large.

1:16:57.380 --> 1:17:01.620
 So there are costs associated with breaking up.

1:17:01.620 --> 1:17:03.660
 You know, divorcing, for example.

1:17:03.660 --> 1:17:08.260
 I mean, it's emotionally, financially, it's a costly thing.

1:17:08.260 --> 1:17:12.660
 And so if you have like a half a point mate value discrepancy

1:17:12.660 --> 1:17:14.140
 you're not gonna see a lot of breakups,

1:17:14.140 --> 1:17:17.300
 but you know, if you have larger mate value discrepancies

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:21.320
 that's gonna augur more for trading up in the mating market.

1:17:22.420 --> 1:17:26.660
 So, but, so then you get into,

1:17:26.660 --> 1:17:28.660
 so what jealousy is it's an emotion

1:17:28.660 --> 1:17:31.700
 that gets activated by these circumstances.

1:17:31.700 --> 1:17:33.300
 And then what people do about it

1:17:33.300 --> 1:17:36.000
 depends on what their options are.

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:40.380
 And people do things that I, in my published scientific work

1:17:40.380 --> 1:17:43.540
 I say range from vigilance to violence.

1:17:43.540 --> 1:17:45.400
 So there's a whole spectrum of things.

1:17:45.400 --> 1:17:48.060
 And in fact, I've identified 19 different tactics

1:17:48.060 --> 1:17:53.060
 that people use to deal with problems once they get jealous.

1:17:53.540 --> 1:17:56.300
 And one is increased vigilance and the other is-

1:17:56.300 --> 1:17:59.120
 Vigilance for the behavior of the mate.

1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:00.860
 Yeah, vigilance for the behavior of the mate.

1:18:00.860 --> 1:18:05.200
 And that can include stalking, following,

1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:08.100
 hacking into iPhones or computers,

1:18:09.140 --> 1:18:13.700
 monitoring the behavior of mate poachers,

1:18:13.700 --> 1:18:18.180
 looking at eye contact between other men and your partner.

1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:20.780
 There's a whole suite of things that, you know,

1:18:20.780 --> 1:18:22.720
 is involved in vigilance.

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.620
 And then at the other extreme,

1:18:25.620 --> 1:18:27.180
 and we can talk about things in between,

1:18:27.180 --> 1:18:29.300
 but the other extreme is violence.

1:18:29.300 --> 1:18:32.700
 And so in my new book, When Men Behave Badly,

1:18:32.700 --> 1:18:35.580
 I have a whole chapter on intimate partner violence.

1:18:35.580 --> 1:18:39.700
 And this is what I argue, and this is really unfortunate,

1:18:39.700 --> 1:18:44.700
 and I'm not endorsing, it's illegal, it's bad, don't do it,

1:18:44.700 --> 1:18:47.980
 but people engage in intimate partner violence.

1:18:47.980 --> 1:18:51.680
 In America, something like 28 to 30% of all people

1:18:51.680 --> 1:18:55.340
 who are married will experience intimate partner violence

1:18:55.340 --> 1:18:57.300
 in their relationship.

1:18:57.300 --> 1:18:59.260
 So it's not a trivial percentage.

1:18:59.260 --> 1:19:01.220
 And that violence is between the two partners.

1:19:01.220 --> 1:19:03.580
 Between the two partners, yes.

1:19:03.580 --> 1:19:05.220
 There's also violence that gets directed

1:19:05.220 --> 1:19:06.680
 to our potential mate poachers,

1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:10.120
 but that's a somewhat separate issue.

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:15.120
 But one of the things that is functional about the violence

1:19:15.780 --> 1:19:17.980
 is that it tends to reduce

1:19:17.980 --> 1:19:20.820
 perceived mate value discrepancies.

1:19:20.820 --> 1:19:25.120
 So in other words, guys tend to engage in the violence

1:19:25.120 --> 1:19:27.100
 more than women do, although some argue

1:19:27.100 --> 1:19:30.280
 that there's more equality in the violence.

1:19:30.280 --> 1:19:33.660
 But at a minimum, men tend to do more damage

1:19:33.660 --> 1:19:35.100
 when they do the violence.

1:19:35.100 --> 1:19:36.460
 And when you're talking about violence,

1:19:36.460 --> 1:19:37.980
 is this ever emotional violence?

1:19:37.980 --> 1:19:38.820
 I mean-

1:19:38.820 --> 1:19:39.820
 Yeah, there's that as well.

1:19:39.820 --> 1:19:41.980
 And in fact, the two tend to be correlated.

1:19:41.980 --> 1:19:44.280
 So in my studies of married couples,

1:19:45.500 --> 1:19:48.280
 verbal violence is a good predictor

1:19:48.280 --> 1:19:50.260
 of physical violence happening as well.

1:19:50.260 --> 1:19:54.340
 So one thing that'll happen, just to give a concrete example,

1:19:54.340 --> 1:19:57.460
 guys will start insulting their partner's appearance.

1:19:57.460 --> 1:19:59.260
 You're really looking ugly today.

1:19:59.260 --> 1:20:04.260
 Your thighs are heavy, you're not looking very good.

1:20:04.340 --> 1:20:06.540
 So they try to denigrate the woman's appearance,

1:20:06.540 --> 1:20:08.940
 which is a key component of woman's mate value.

1:20:08.940 --> 1:20:11.020
 So they're trying to adjust more closely

1:20:11.020 --> 1:20:12.020
 the mate value discrepancy.

1:20:12.020 --> 1:20:13.500
 Yeah, they're trying to reduce

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:17.460
 her perceived, self-perceived mate value.

1:20:17.460 --> 1:20:20.660
 So if let's say he's a six, she's an eight,

1:20:20.660 --> 1:20:24.520
 and he can convince her that she's actually only a six,

1:20:25.580 --> 1:20:28.380
 then she's gonna be more likely to stay with him.

1:20:28.380 --> 1:20:29.420
 Very diabolical.

1:20:29.420 --> 1:20:31.180
 It's terribly diabolical,

1:20:31.180 --> 1:20:36.180
 but the fact is women don't feel good about themselves

1:20:36.380 --> 1:20:39.700
 when they get beaten up by their partner.

1:20:39.700 --> 1:20:43.980
 In fact, in the cases where it leaves physical evidence,

1:20:43.980 --> 1:20:46.580
 women wear sunglasses or hot turtlenecks

1:20:46.580 --> 1:20:49.060
 or cover up the bruises,

1:20:49.060 --> 1:20:52.700
 it literally does lower the mate value of the woman

1:20:52.700 --> 1:20:55.580
 by injuring her physical appearance.

1:20:55.580 --> 1:20:58.020
 And getting her to conceal herself, stay home.

1:20:58.020 --> 1:20:58.860
 Yeah, exactly.

1:20:58.860 --> 1:21:01.700
 Yeah, she's taking her out of the,

1:21:01.700 --> 1:21:03.740
 literally reducing her visibility.

1:21:03.740 --> 1:21:07.260
 Right, and that's actually one of the predictors of violence

1:21:07.260 --> 1:21:10.300
 is if he starts doing things other than violence,

1:21:10.300 --> 1:21:12.820
 like cutting off her relationships

1:21:12.820 --> 1:21:14.660
 with her friends and her family,

1:21:14.660 --> 1:21:17.660
 trying to sequester her and prevent her

1:21:17.660 --> 1:21:21.980
 from getting exposed to potential other partners.

1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:24.820
 And so it is very diabolical,

1:21:24.820 --> 1:21:28.740
 but I think important to understand the potential

1:21:28.740 --> 1:21:33.060
 functionality of intimate partner violence.

1:21:33.060 --> 1:21:34.740
 What about, sorry to interrupt again,

1:21:34.740 --> 1:21:35.900
 but I'm just so curious.

1:21:35.900 --> 1:21:39.280
 So oftentimes my audience will say interrupt too often,

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:41.500
 but I want to make sure that I don't miss an opportunity

1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:43.440
 to ask you about the intimate partner violence

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:45.460
 in the other direction, female to male,

1:21:45.460 --> 1:21:48.780
 where stereotypically speaking,

1:21:48.780 --> 1:21:51.300
 the opportunity for physical violence is still there.

1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:54.580
 But the idea in mind is that it would be more

1:21:54.580 --> 1:21:55.780
 of a psychological nature.

1:21:55.780 --> 1:21:57.020
 Although I think there is evidence

1:21:57.020 --> 1:21:59.900
 that some women beat their husbands,

1:21:59.900 --> 1:22:03.380
 but I'm guessing it's not as frequent or am I off?

1:22:03.380 --> 1:22:04.800
 Well, different studies.

1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:08.840
 So it depends on whether you just simply count up acts

1:22:08.840 --> 1:22:11.860
 or whether you look at the damage that's done, okay?

1:22:11.860 --> 1:22:15.200
 And as I mentioned, men tend to do more physical damage.

1:22:15.200 --> 1:22:17.900
 So there are shelters for battered women

1:22:17.900 --> 1:22:19.380
 all over the country.

1:22:19.380 --> 1:22:22.260
 As far as I know, there's one for battered men.

1:22:22.260 --> 1:22:24.460
 Now it may be, and this is partly true,

1:22:24.460 --> 1:22:28.180
 that men are more ashamed if they get beaten up

1:22:28.180 --> 1:22:31.220
 by their partner or clocked with a frying pan.

1:22:31.220 --> 1:22:33.960
 And it's possible, and there's evidence

1:22:33.960 --> 1:22:36.340
 that police don't take it as seriously.

1:22:36.340 --> 1:22:38.420
 So there's one case that I report in my book

1:22:38.420 --> 1:22:41.300
 where a guy called the police

1:22:41.300 --> 1:22:44.600
 and his wife had clocked him with something

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:47.660
 and the police shows up and he says,

1:22:47.660 --> 1:22:51.820
 if she so much as broke a fingernail in this altercation,

1:22:51.820 --> 1:22:53.620
 they'll charge you and not her.

1:22:53.620 --> 1:22:58.540
 And so there is a police bias,

1:22:59.940 --> 1:23:01.700
 a potential police bias in this.

1:23:01.700 --> 1:23:04.680
 And so there may be under-reporting of women

1:23:04.680 --> 1:23:08.540
 beating up men as a consequence, okay?

1:23:08.540 --> 1:23:11.480
 But the motivations are often different.

1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:15.880
 So one is that male sexual jealousy

1:23:15.880 --> 1:23:19.960
 will trigger him to attack his partner

1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:23.200
 and then she will use physical violence to defend herself.

1:23:23.200 --> 1:23:26.580
 So she might pick up a frying pan

1:23:26.580 --> 1:23:30.380
 or a weapon of some sort to defend herself.

1:23:30.380 --> 1:23:35.380
 And so the motivation is his sexual jealousy on his part,

1:23:35.600 --> 1:23:37.900
 but self-defense on her part.

1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:39.860
 And so that accounts for some unknown

1:23:39.860 --> 1:23:41.460
 percentage of the cases.

1:23:41.460 --> 1:23:44.780
 And in some cases, it is women who were outraged

1:23:44.780 --> 1:23:46.900
 when they discover their partner's been having sex

1:23:46.900 --> 1:23:50.660
 with someone else, an infidelity of a sexual,

1:23:50.660 --> 1:23:53.260
 financial or emotional nature.

1:23:53.260 --> 1:23:55.740
 And so there is some female to male violence

1:23:55.740 --> 1:23:57.380
 that absolutely occurs,

1:23:58.240 --> 1:24:03.240
 but the reduction of a perceived mate value discrepancy

1:24:04.020 --> 1:24:06.660
 is a key function from male perspective.

1:24:06.660 --> 1:24:08.740
 Now, again, not that he thinks about this,

1:24:08.740 --> 1:24:12.540
 he's just angry and wants to hurt her, okay?

1:24:12.540 --> 1:24:15.340
 Okay, but here's one other thing

1:24:15.340 --> 1:24:17.060
 that is really interesting

1:24:17.060 --> 1:24:19.100
 about the intimate partner violence.

1:24:19.100 --> 1:24:23.060
 And that's the specificity of it depending on circumstances.

1:24:23.060 --> 1:24:26.660
 And namely, when the woman gets pregnant,

1:24:26.660 --> 1:24:30.080
 she's more vulnerable to physical violence.

1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:33.260
 And when the man suspects that he's not the father

1:24:33.260 --> 1:24:36.780
 of that pregnancy, he's more likely to direct the violence

1:24:36.780 --> 1:24:39.780
 toward blows to her abdomen, okay?

1:24:39.780 --> 1:24:41.340
 That's specific.

1:24:42.180 --> 1:24:44.800
 And so in that case, the function is,

1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:49.320
 the hypothesized function is to terminate the pregnancy

1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:54.320
 by a rival male as opposed to deterring the woman

1:24:54.320 --> 1:24:55.880
 from committing an infidelity

1:24:55.880 --> 1:24:58.420
 or from leaving the relationship entirely.

1:24:58.420 --> 1:25:01.240
 So that's why one function of intimate partner violence

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.360
 is just sequestering the woman

1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:05.260
 and keeping her all to himself.

1:25:06.320 --> 1:25:08.340
 So it's both to prevent infidelity

1:25:08.340 --> 1:25:10.600
 and to prevent defection.

1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:15.600
 I have a friend whose wife told me

1:25:17.820 --> 1:25:21.900
 that if he cheats, I'll kill him, that's what she said.

1:25:22.900 --> 1:25:24.500
 But it's actually just much easier

1:25:24.500 --> 1:25:27.040
 to keep him very, very busy.

1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:29.760
 And that statement now leaps to mind

1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:31.500
 because of what you're describing,

1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:32.840
 that there are many tactics

1:25:32.840 --> 1:25:36.480
 by which people can engage this effort

1:25:36.480 --> 1:25:38.460
 to reduce the mate value discrepancy,

1:25:38.460 --> 1:25:40.800
 not all of which are overtly violent,

1:25:41.680 --> 1:25:45.680
 but all of which are designed to constrain their behavior.

1:25:45.680 --> 1:25:47.480
 Right, right, yeah, so these would fall

1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:50.160
 under what I would call mate retention tactics,

1:25:52.140 --> 1:25:56.440
 only one or two of which fall under the violence category.

1:25:56.440 --> 1:25:58.400
 Yeah, there are even, yeah,

1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:03.280
 within partner psychological manipulations

1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:04.120
 about these things.

1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:05.740
 So there are psychological manipulations

1:26:05.740 --> 1:26:10.740
 about perceived mate value, no one else would want you,

1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:15.420
 you're a loser, there's denigration of partner

1:26:15.420 --> 1:26:20.420
 within the relationship, even feigning anger

1:26:20.520 --> 1:26:22.480
 to make the partner feel guilty

1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:25.620
 about, say, looking at someone else.

1:26:25.620 --> 1:26:29.900
 So there's all kinds of internecine warfare

1:26:29.900 --> 1:26:31.760
 that goes on within relationships

1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:34.400
 to manipulate perceptions of these things.

1:26:34.400 --> 1:26:36.440
 This is, I'm creating a much too jaded view

1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:38.320
 of romance and love, I think.

1:26:38.320 --> 1:26:42.680
 Oh, no, we will get to the happy endings and long,

1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:44.840
 I mean, there are certainly many happy relationships

1:26:44.840 --> 1:26:45.800
 out there.

1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:48.280
 Oh, you know, as a neuroscientist, I hear about this

1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:53.280
 and the immediacy of how people, you know,

1:26:53.520 --> 1:26:57.640
 fall into a pattern of jealousy or a pattern of cheating

1:26:57.640 --> 1:27:01.700
 and not always, and it just speaks to brain circuitry

1:27:01.700 --> 1:27:03.540
 that's evolved to protect something.

1:27:03.540 --> 1:27:06.900
 And I'm sure this statement is not exhaustive,

1:27:06.900 --> 1:27:09.040
 but I think it's accurate to say that every species,

1:27:09.040 --> 1:27:13.240
 but especially humans, wants to make more of itself

1:27:13.240 --> 1:27:14.880
 and protect its young.

1:27:14.880 --> 1:27:18.140
 But these issues of paternity and resource allocation,

1:27:18.140 --> 1:27:19.080
 I mean, I think they're vital.

1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:20.320
 And, you know, I look forward to a day

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:23.020
 where evolutionary psychology and neuroscience

1:27:23.020 --> 1:27:25.520
 can merge at the level of underlying mechanism,

1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:27.760
 but I don't think it's dark,

1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:31.100
 I think it's just the way we're wired at some level.

1:27:31.100 --> 1:27:36.100
 So speaking of dark, could you tell us about the dark triad?

1:27:36.180 --> 1:27:37.540
 Yeah, so the dark triad,

1:27:37.540 --> 1:27:40.580
 so we've been talking about sex differences on average,

1:27:40.580 --> 1:27:44.340
 but there are critical within sex, individual differences.

1:27:44.340 --> 1:27:47.700
 And the dark triad is one of the most important ones.

1:27:47.700 --> 1:27:51.860
 The dark triad consists of three personality characteristics.

1:27:51.860 --> 1:27:56.660
 So narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.

1:27:56.660 --> 1:28:00.980
 Homeworks of narcissism are things like grandiosity,

1:28:00.980 --> 1:28:04.340
 person thinks that they're more intelligent,

1:28:04.340 --> 1:28:06.340
 more attractive, more dazzling,

1:28:06.340 --> 1:28:08.340
 more charming than they actually are.

1:28:08.340 --> 1:28:11.940
 I think they're the greatest person since sliced bread.

1:28:11.940 --> 1:28:13.380
 Importantly with narcissism,

1:28:13.380 --> 1:28:16.620
 you also get a sense of entitlement.

1:28:16.620 --> 1:28:20.160
 So they feel entitled to a larger share of the pie,

1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:23.060
 whether that be the financial pie, the status pie,

1:28:23.060 --> 1:28:24.560
 or the sexual pie.

1:28:26.180 --> 1:28:30.340
 Machiavellianism is high scores tend to pursue

1:28:30.340 --> 1:28:33.140
 an exploitative social strategy.

1:28:33.140 --> 1:28:35.260
 So they might feign cooperation,

1:28:35.260 --> 1:28:38.600
 but then cheat on subsequent moves.

1:28:39.620 --> 1:28:43.020
 They view other people as pawns to be manipulated

1:28:43.020 --> 1:28:45.100
 for their own instrumental gains.

1:28:45.940 --> 1:28:47.020
 And then psychopathy,

1:28:47.020 --> 1:28:50.280
 one of the hallmarks of psychopathy is a lack of empathy.

1:28:50.280 --> 1:28:53.180
 So most people have a normal empathy circuit

1:28:53.180 --> 1:28:56.140
 where if a child falls down and gets hurt,

1:28:56.140 --> 1:29:00.260
 we feel compassion for the harm that that person

1:29:00.260 --> 1:29:01.420
 is undergoing.

1:29:01.420 --> 1:29:04.900
 Or if a puppy gets hit by a car or whatever,

1:29:04.900 --> 1:29:07.020
 we feel compassion.

1:29:07.020 --> 1:29:09.580
 Psychopaths don't, that is those high on this,

1:29:09.580 --> 1:29:13.180
 it's a dimensional thing, it's not a categorical thing.

1:29:13.180 --> 1:29:17.500
 So those high on psychopathy basically lack empathy.

1:29:17.500 --> 1:29:20.540
 And so if you combine these qualities,

1:29:20.540 --> 1:29:25.140
 narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism,

1:29:25.140 --> 1:29:29.140
 you have some very bad dudes.

1:29:29.140 --> 1:29:31.900
 And I say bad dudes because men tend to score higher

1:29:31.900 --> 1:29:33.340
 in these things than women,

1:29:33.340 --> 1:29:36.820
 especially on the psychopathy dimension.

1:29:36.820 --> 1:29:39.500
 So when you talk about clinical levels of psychopathy,

1:29:39.500 --> 1:29:43.380
 it's estimated to be something like 1% of women

1:29:43.380 --> 1:29:45.140
 and about 4% of men.

1:29:45.140 --> 1:29:48.380
 So men are much higher on that.

1:29:48.380 --> 1:29:50.340
 So why is this important?

1:29:50.340 --> 1:29:52.700
 Well, it's important in the mating context

1:29:52.700 --> 1:29:57.340
 because those who are high on dark triad traits

1:29:57.340 --> 1:30:02.100
 tend to be sexual deceivers, for one.

1:30:02.100 --> 1:30:04.780
 So they're very often very charming,

1:30:04.780 --> 1:30:08.220
 very good at seducing women and then abandoning them

1:30:08.220 --> 1:30:11.620
 sometimes after fleecing them

1:30:11.620 --> 1:30:13.540
 or draining their bank account.

1:30:14.860 --> 1:30:19.060
 They're very good at the art of seduction.

1:30:19.060 --> 1:30:24.060
 They also tend to be sexual harassers,

1:30:24.380 --> 1:30:27.780
 serial sexual harassers, and sexual coercers.

1:30:29.100 --> 1:30:33.980
 So when it comes to forms of sexual violence,

1:30:33.980 --> 1:30:38.100
 high dark triad guys tend to be perpetrators of this.

1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:39.660
 And so like most men,

1:30:39.660 --> 1:30:43.660
 I think would find it ethically abhorrent

1:30:43.660 --> 1:30:46.620
 to sexually harass, say, a woman in the workplace.

1:30:46.620 --> 1:30:50.700
 Dark triad guys, in part, maybe they feel entitled to it.

1:30:50.700 --> 1:30:52.660
 And in part, they do.

1:30:52.660 --> 1:30:55.180
 I mean, in some cases that I report in the book,

1:30:55.180 --> 1:30:56.900
 there are like literal descriptions

1:30:56.900 --> 1:30:58.580
 where the guys are writing in these journals,

1:30:58.580 --> 1:31:01.460
 oh, I knew she was attracted to me.

1:31:01.460 --> 1:31:05.660
 That's why she met me in the Xerox room

1:31:05.660 --> 1:31:06.740
 just when I was there

1:31:06.740 --> 1:31:10.140
 because she wanted to admire my bulging biceps or whatever.

1:31:10.140 --> 1:31:11.180
 It's all about them.

1:31:11.180 --> 1:31:15.900
 Yeah, and this gets into a bias that I talk about,

1:31:15.900 --> 1:31:19.460
 which is the male sexual misperception bias,

1:31:19.460 --> 1:31:21.020
 where a woman smiles at a man.

1:31:21.020 --> 1:31:23.740
 Man thinks, oh, she wants my body.

1:31:23.740 --> 1:31:24.780
 She's attracted to me.

1:31:24.780 --> 1:31:27.500
 And women are thinking, oh, I'm just being friendly.

1:31:27.500 --> 1:31:29.900
 I'm being polite or professional.

1:31:30.900 --> 1:31:33.540
 But these guys, high dark triad guys,

1:31:33.540 --> 1:31:37.820
 are more susceptible to the sexual overperception bias.

1:31:37.820 --> 1:31:39.780
 And they literally believe

1:31:39.780 --> 1:31:41.620
 that the woman is attracted to them

1:31:41.620 --> 1:31:45.300
 and sending them signals, green lights,

1:31:45.300 --> 1:31:46.860
 to sexually approach.

1:31:47.820 --> 1:31:50.420
 And so if you combine dark triad traits

1:31:50.420 --> 1:31:52.980
 with the dispositional pursuit

1:31:52.980 --> 1:31:54.900
 of a short-term mating strategy,

1:31:54.900 --> 1:31:57.420
 that's an especially deadly combination.

1:31:57.420 --> 1:32:01.340
 That's when you get sexual harassment, sexual coercion.

1:32:01.340 --> 1:32:04.300
 So these are very bad dudes,

1:32:04.300 --> 1:32:07.860
 also predictors of intimate partner violence.

1:32:07.860 --> 1:32:11.540
 What approximate frequency in the male population

1:32:11.540 --> 1:32:14.100
 or these have all three of the dark triad traits?

1:32:14.100 --> 1:32:15.700
 And I realize that they're on a continuum,

1:32:15.700 --> 1:32:17.060
 sociopath, narcissist.

1:32:17.060 --> 1:32:18.100
 That's why you can't say,

1:32:18.100 --> 1:32:19.300
 because they are on a continuum

1:32:19.300 --> 1:32:23.220
 and it's sort of arbitrary where you draw the line.

1:32:23.220 --> 1:32:26.380
 But I think it's a minority of men.

1:32:26.380 --> 1:32:30.300
 It's a subset of men who commit the vast majority

1:32:30.300 --> 1:32:32.260
 of these acts of sexual violence.

1:32:32.260 --> 1:32:33.900
 And that's why it's not like,

1:32:33.900 --> 1:32:38.020
 if you look at victims of sexual violence,

1:32:38.020 --> 1:32:39.300
 they're more numerous

1:32:39.300 --> 1:32:41.500
 than the perpetrators of sexual violence

1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:44.660
 because the perpetrators tend to be serial offenders,

1:32:44.660 --> 1:32:45.660
 so to speak.

1:32:45.660 --> 1:32:49.500
 One guy in the workplace harassing 15 different women,

1:32:49.500 --> 1:32:53.140
 one guy sexually coercing multiple women.

1:32:53.140 --> 1:32:56.580
 So that's why you have like in well-known cases in the news,

1:32:56.580 --> 1:32:58.700
 like Harvey Weinstein,

1:32:58.700 --> 1:33:01.660
 probably over a hundred different women.

1:33:01.660 --> 1:33:03.860
 Bill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein,

1:33:03.860 --> 1:33:06.100
 some of these more famous cases.

1:33:06.100 --> 1:33:08.860
 These are a large number of victims,

1:33:08.860 --> 1:33:13.860
 but pretty much sole perpetrators.

1:33:13.980 --> 1:33:16.220
 And there's no question that these guys,

1:33:17.420 --> 1:33:19.660
 like Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein

1:33:19.660 --> 1:33:22.420
 were definitely high on dark triad traits.

1:33:24.780 --> 1:33:26.460
 You mentioned stalking briefly.

1:33:28.380 --> 1:33:29.940
 Maybe we could just talk about

1:33:30.820 --> 1:33:34.420
 some of the less known features about stalking.

1:33:34.420 --> 1:33:36.500
 I think I once heard you give a lecture

1:33:36.500 --> 1:33:39.620
 where you said that one of the scariest things

1:33:39.620 --> 1:33:42.700
 about stalking is that sometimes it works.

1:33:42.700 --> 1:33:43.780
 Yes, yeah.

1:33:43.780 --> 1:33:48.340
 So, well, stalking has multiple motivations,

1:33:48.340 --> 1:33:51.220
 but one of the most frequent motivations

1:33:51.220 --> 1:33:54.820
 is a mating motivation

1:33:54.820 --> 1:33:58.340
 where either there's a breakup

1:33:58.340 --> 1:34:00.220
 and the woman dumps the guy

1:34:00.220 --> 1:34:02.620
 and the guy doesn't want to get dumped.

1:34:02.620 --> 1:34:04.980
 He wants to maintain a relationship with her.

1:34:04.980 --> 1:34:08.100
 And I should say that when it comes to criminal stalking,

1:34:08.100 --> 1:34:09.420
 there's a huge sex difference.

1:34:09.420 --> 1:34:11.980
 About 80% of the stalkers tend to be men,

1:34:11.980 --> 1:34:13.340
 about 20% women.

1:34:13.340 --> 1:34:15.460
 So there are women stalkers,

1:34:15.460 --> 1:34:20.460
 but they're about a fourth the number compared to men.

1:34:22.220 --> 1:34:25.260
 So the motivation of the guys

1:34:25.260 --> 1:34:27.380
 tends to be either an attempt

1:34:27.380 --> 1:34:30.260
 to get back together with the woman,

1:34:30.260 --> 1:34:34.020
 either sexually or in a relationship,

1:34:34.020 --> 1:34:39.020
 or and or to interfere with her future mating prospects.

1:34:40.020 --> 1:34:43.940
 And it works in some of the time in two senses.

1:34:43.940 --> 1:34:48.460
 One is it does interfere with her attempts to remade.

1:34:48.460 --> 1:34:51.140
 So in fact, it scares off some guys.

1:34:51.140 --> 1:34:55.660
 So like you show up and pick up a woman at her apartment

1:34:55.660 --> 1:35:00.140
 for a date and her ex is sitting out there glaring at you.

1:35:00.140 --> 1:35:03.780
 Or, and I'm actually familiar with the circumstance

1:35:03.780 --> 1:35:05.420
 where early in a relationship,

1:35:05.420 --> 1:35:09.900
 somebody mentions that an ex has made veiled threats

1:35:09.900 --> 1:35:12.380
 about surveillance, for instance.

1:35:12.380 --> 1:35:14.340
 I've actually had that happen several times

1:35:14.340 --> 1:35:16.780
 in my dating history where someone would say,

1:35:16.780 --> 1:35:19.020
 you started opening up about previous relationships

1:35:19.020 --> 1:35:20.580
 a little bit as it's appropriate.

1:35:20.580 --> 1:35:21.980
 And someone says, yeah,

1:35:21.980 --> 1:35:25.540
 he mentioned that he was going to send someone around

1:35:25.540 --> 1:35:29.580
 to surveil me, that kind of thing,

1:35:29.580 --> 1:35:33.660
 which is a very interesting factoid to pick up.

1:35:33.660 --> 1:35:36.140
 But I heard it enough times

1:35:37.300 --> 1:35:39.900
 and people I know have reported hearing this enough times

1:35:39.900 --> 1:35:43.340
 that I'm guessing that that's probably more frequent

1:35:43.340 --> 1:35:46.220
 than people actually trailing people in cars

1:35:46.220 --> 1:35:47.220
 and things of that sort.

1:35:47.220 --> 1:35:49.300
 But planting that it's like the psychological

1:35:49.300 --> 1:35:52.620
 sea of surveillance is a form of harassment in some sense.

1:35:52.620 --> 1:35:53.620
 Yes, absolutely.

1:35:53.620 --> 1:35:54.460
 I think you're right.

1:35:54.460 --> 1:35:57.580
 I mean, there's that planting the psychological seeds,

1:35:57.580 --> 1:35:59.940
 but then also with surveillance,

1:35:59.940 --> 1:36:03.860
 some surveillance remain hidden so you don't know

1:36:03.860 --> 1:36:04.700
 necessarily.

1:36:04.700 --> 1:36:06.340
 Yeah, I confess in this case,

1:36:06.340 --> 1:36:08.380
 it did not act as a deterrent for continuing

1:36:08.380 --> 1:36:11.580
 the relationship, but that's another story.

1:36:13.380 --> 1:36:17.620
 So how often do women respond,

1:36:17.620 --> 1:36:19.260
 I have to put this in quotes,

1:36:19.260 --> 1:36:20.100
 for those that are listening,

1:36:20.100 --> 1:36:21.300
 air quotes, end quotes,

1:36:21.300 --> 1:36:23.660
 positively to stalking mean how often does it work

1:36:23.660 --> 1:36:27.340
 to re-secure the partner after they've been broken up?

1:36:27.340 --> 1:36:31.140
 So in our studies, it's a minority of cases

1:36:31.140 --> 1:36:34.260
 that it works to re-establish.

1:36:34.260 --> 1:36:37.460
 I think something like 15% of the time

1:36:37.460 --> 1:36:41.540
 that it works either to temporarily re-establish

1:36:41.540 --> 1:36:44.860
 a sexual relationship or lure the woman back in

1:36:44.860 --> 1:36:46.820
 for a more permanent relationship.

1:36:46.820 --> 1:36:49.100
 So most of the time it doesn't work.

1:36:49.100 --> 1:36:53.260
 But one woman in our study said,

1:36:54.420 --> 1:36:57.060
 the guy, every time she went out with another guy,

1:36:57.060 --> 1:36:59.100
 he would threaten the other guy.

1:36:59.100 --> 1:37:01.300
 And she said, after about six months,

1:37:01.300 --> 1:37:02.340
 there were no other guys.

1:37:02.340 --> 1:37:04.580
 He basically scared off all the other guys.

1:37:04.580 --> 1:37:06.020
 And so she went back to him

1:37:06.020 --> 1:37:07.540
 because there were no other guys around.

1:37:07.540 --> 1:37:10.260
 Yeah, I experienced this when I was in college.

1:37:10.260 --> 1:37:13.180
 I lived in a small town, very population dense,

1:37:14.420 --> 1:37:16.220
 Isla Vista, UC Santa Barbara.

1:37:16.220 --> 1:37:19.540
 And there was a couple where every time

1:37:19.540 --> 1:37:20.540
 this woman would date someone,

1:37:20.540 --> 1:37:23.660
 he'd basically beat up whoever the new suitor was.

1:37:23.660 --> 1:37:25.100
 And pretty soon no one would go near them.

1:37:25.100 --> 1:37:28.460
 They got a reputation as the kind of Sid and Nancy couple.

1:37:28.460 --> 1:37:30.220
 And indeed it worked.

1:37:30.220 --> 1:37:33.860
 It worked in the sense that no one dare go near her

1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:35.340
 and they ended up together.

1:37:35.340 --> 1:37:38.340
 So I've seen real life examples of this.

1:37:38.340 --> 1:37:39.660
 Yeah, so it happens.

1:37:39.660 --> 1:37:44.460
 But it is in general, not a successful strategy.

1:37:44.460 --> 1:37:45.860
 Oh no, and it's not what I'm suggesting.

1:37:45.860 --> 1:37:47.380
 I was just shocked to learn that,

1:37:47.380 --> 1:37:50.260
 because we hear stalking and we have this,

1:37:50.260 --> 1:37:52.020
 there's one very extreme image of it,

1:37:52.020 --> 1:37:53.660
 but the underlying motivations I think

1:37:53.660 --> 1:37:57.660
 are reveal something about mating dynamics.

1:37:57.660 --> 1:38:00.180
 Yeah, and I think that the circumstances

1:38:00.180 --> 1:38:02.500
 are often a mate value discrepancy

1:38:02.500 --> 1:38:06.420
 where the guy realizes correctly

1:38:06.420 --> 1:38:09.220
 that he will be unable to replace her

1:38:09.220 --> 1:38:13.020
 with a mate of equivalent mate value,

1:38:13.020 --> 1:38:15.900
 or in some cases, any mate.

1:38:15.900 --> 1:38:18.140
 It's like, well, she was with me once,

1:38:18.140 --> 1:38:21.260
 maybe I can get her back with me again.

1:38:21.260 --> 1:38:26.100
 So the psychology is very understandable,

1:38:26.100 --> 1:38:28.500
 but it tends not to work,

1:38:28.500 --> 1:38:30.020
 because the other thing we found,

1:38:30.020 --> 1:38:33.500
 we did a study of 2,500 victims of stalking.

1:38:33.500 --> 1:38:36.060
 This is with Josh Duntley, a former student of mine,

1:38:36.060 --> 1:38:38.540
 who's now a professor in a criminology department.

1:38:38.540 --> 1:38:43.540
 And what we found is there were large differences

1:38:44.060 --> 1:38:46.940
 between the stalker and the victim of the stalker

1:38:46.940 --> 1:38:50.780
 where the stalker tends to be much lower in mate value

1:38:50.780 --> 1:38:52.940
 than the victim.

1:38:52.940 --> 1:38:55.660
 And so basically it's typically the woman

1:38:55.660 --> 1:39:00.100
 who realizes she can do a lot better on the mating market,

1:39:00.100 --> 1:39:03.420
 and the guy realizes I am never going to be able

1:39:03.420 --> 1:39:07.300
 to replace her with a woman of equivalent mate value,

1:39:07.300 --> 1:39:11.260
 and so I'm going to use this last-ditch desperate measure

1:39:11.260 --> 1:39:14.340
 to try to get her back, and occasionally it works.

1:39:14.340 --> 1:39:19.340
 I'm thinking more about this mate value thing,

1:39:21.500 --> 1:39:25.540
 this number, this metric, the eight, 10, six,

1:39:25.540 --> 1:39:28.420
 whatever it is, and mate value discrepancy

1:39:28.420 --> 1:39:31.300
 playing such a strong role in all these dynamics.

1:39:32.460 --> 1:39:33.780
 I should have asked this earlier,

1:39:33.780 --> 1:39:38.300
 but what is the impact on mate value,

1:39:38.300 --> 1:39:43.300
 perceived or real, of a woman having already had children?

1:39:43.300 --> 1:39:47.220
 You know, for instance, there are friends of mine

1:39:47.220 --> 1:39:49.140
 who are married and divorced who have children

1:39:49.140 --> 1:39:50.780
 who will often post pictures of themselves

1:39:50.780 --> 1:39:53.100
 with their children in their online profiles

1:39:53.100 --> 1:39:56.820
 because it shows a strong sense of paternal instinct.

1:39:56.820 --> 1:39:58.780
 You know, there's the puppy thing,

1:39:59.860 --> 1:40:04.260
 people with dogs or puppies demonstrating a capacity

1:40:04.260 --> 1:40:07.180
 to care and for caretaking.

1:40:07.180 --> 1:40:09.100
 In women, the opposite is also true.

1:40:09.100 --> 1:40:10.740
 Women with children show capacity,

1:40:10.740 --> 1:40:14.620
 the capacity demonstrates fertility, at least at one point,

1:40:14.620 --> 1:40:17.340
 perhaps still fertility that's still present.

1:40:18.300 --> 1:40:22.180
 Does it positively, negatively, or neutrally impact

1:40:22.180 --> 1:40:25.700
 a woman to already have children when seeking another mate,

1:40:25.700 --> 1:40:27.260
 regardless of whether or not she was married

1:40:27.260 --> 1:40:28.740
 or had the children out of wedlock?

1:40:28.740 --> 1:40:32.220
 Yeah, as a general rule, it decreases her mate value

1:40:32.220 --> 1:40:35.740
 because kids with another mate are viewed as a cost,

1:40:35.740 --> 1:40:38.060
 not a benefit, and they're a cost

1:40:38.060 --> 1:40:41.860
 on multiple dimensions, one of which,

1:40:41.860 --> 1:40:44.620
 they're gonna be a cost to the guy

1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:46.940
 because he's gonna have to invest resources,

1:40:48.180 --> 1:40:49.420
 time, attention, and so forth,

1:40:49.420 --> 1:40:53.500
 but also a portion of her effort and resources

1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:54.900
 are gonna be devoted toward kids

1:40:54.900 --> 1:40:56.820
 who are not genetically related to him,

1:40:56.820 --> 1:40:59.300
 and which is one reason why stepfamilies,

1:40:59.300 --> 1:41:01.980
 there's often a lot of conflict within stepfamilies,

1:41:01.980 --> 1:41:05.140
 very explicable from an evolutionary perspective.

1:41:05.140 --> 1:41:08.020
 So in general, it's a cost, not a benefit.

1:41:08.020 --> 1:41:09.580
 Sometimes it can be a benefit, though.

1:41:09.580 --> 1:41:12.820
 So I know of one case where a woman got divorced,

1:41:12.820 --> 1:41:15.900
 she had two kids, and she ended up successfully mating

1:41:15.900 --> 1:41:17.980
 with a guy who was also divorced

1:41:17.980 --> 1:41:20.260
 and had primary custody of his two kids,

1:41:20.260 --> 1:41:23.380
 and so there was a compatibility there.

1:41:23.380 --> 1:41:26.420
 But as a general rule, it will decrease a woman's

1:41:26.420 --> 1:41:28.980
 and a man's mate value to have kids,

1:41:28.980 --> 1:41:32.860
 especially kids who are young and financially dependent,

1:41:33.980 --> 1:41:36.340
 but what happens is, let's say the woman

1:41:36.340 --> 1:41:38.980
 would be an eight without kids.

1:41:38.980 --> 1:41:43.100
 A guy who's a six might be able to attract her

1:41:44.580 --> 1:41:48.660
 and might feel lucky to attract her

1:41:48.660 --> 1:41:50.300
 because there's no way he would have been able

1:41:50.300 --> 1:41:52.100
 to attract her under other conditions,

1:41:52.100 --> 1:41:57.100
 but that's why the display of effort investing in her kids

1:41:57.260 --> 1:41:59.140
 is often a mating tactic.

1:41:59.140 --> 1:42:02.100
 He's showing, okay, I'm willing to invest in kids,

1:42:02.100 --> 1:42:05.180
 I'm willing to sacrifice, and so they, in essence,

1:42:05.180 --> 1:42:09.420
 become equivalent in mate value as a result of that.

1:42:09.420 --> 1:42:14.420
 But will she be able to attract, on average, other eights?

1:42:15.780 --> 1:42:18.300
 Less likely, but the same is true of guys,

1:42:18.300 --> 1:42:22.180
 and this is why the reason that it affects women

1:42:22.180 --> 1:42:26.980
 more than men is because more custody tends to go with women.

1:42:26.980 --> 1:42:30.540
 That is, the kids, women tend to have greater custody,

1:42:30.540 --> 1:42:34.020
 and women tend to invest more in the kids

1:42:34.020 --> 1:42:35.860
 throughout their lives.

1:42:35.860 --> 1:42:38.060
 Now, there are other things like alimony

1:42:38.060 --> 1:42:39.860
 and child support payments and so forth,

1:42:39.860 --> 1:42:42.660
 but all the women I've talked to,

1:42:42.660 --> 1:42:45.780
 I've talked to one-on-one with many women about this,

1:42:45.780 --> 1:42:50.060
 they view a guy with kids as a cost, not a benefit,

1:42:50.060 --> 1:42:52.780
 unless the kids are old enough and they've left home

1:42:52.780 --> 1:42:55.620
 and are no longer financially dependent.

1:42:55.620 --> 1:42:58.100
 And everything you just described is consistent

1:42:58.100 --> 1:42:59.580
 with what you said earlier,

1:42:59.580 --> 1:43:01.940
 which is that with subsequent marriages,

1:43:01.940 --> 1:43:05.940
 or as men get older, the tendency is to seek mates

1:43:05.940 --> 1:43:08.900
 that are progressively younger, right?

1:43:08.900 --> 1:43:11.420
 Because there's a higher, lower probability

1:43:11.420 --> 1:43:14.220
 they'll already have children if they're much younger.

1:43:14.220 --> 1:43:17.420
 Right, right, and if the guy's successful,

1:43:17.420 --> 1:43:21.100
 if he has status and resources and has other qualities

1:43:21.100 --> 1:43:22.660
 associated with higher mate value,

1:43:22.660 --> 1:43:26.220
 then he will remain attractive to younger women.

1:43:26.220 --> 1:43:28.740
 I realize it's not your specific area of expertise,

1:43:28.740 --> 1:43:30.980
 but these days, there's a lot of discussion

1:43:30.980 --> 1:43:35.460
 about how early childhood attachment to parents

1:43:35.460 --> 1:43:37.420
 influences mate choice later on,

1:43:37.420 --> 1:43:40.340
 this kind of general categorization of avoidant

1:43:40.340 --> 1:43:43.660
 and anxious and anxious avoidant and all this kind of thing.

1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:47.140
 And again, putting my hat on as a neuroscientist,

1:43:47.140 --> 1:43:51.460
 I think it makes sense that the neural circuits

1:43:51.460 --> 1:43:56.060
 for attachment in childhood would be somehow,

1:43:56.060 --> 1:43:57.660
 partially or in whole,

1:43:57.660 --> 1:43:59.540
 repurposed for other forms of attachment.

1:43:59.540 --> 1:44:01.860
 We don't just tend to say, okay, that brain circuitry

1:44:01.860 --> 1:44:03.780
 was from when I was a kid and now I'm an adult,

1:44:03.780 --> 1:44:05.780
 and so I'll develop this new attachment circuitry.

1:44:05.780 --> 1:44:07.900
 I'm guessing it evolves and whatnot.

1:44:07.900 --> 1:44:10.780
 But is there anything interesting

1:44:10.780 --> 1:44:15.780
 about childhood attachment strategies

1:44:15.860 --> 1:44:19.140
 vis-a-vis stability of long-term partner choice,

1:44:19.140 --> 1:44:21.060
 or is that too big of a leap for us to make here?

1:44:21.060 --> 1:44:22.980
 Yeah, well, I mean, I can offer

1:44:22.980 --> 1:44:27.580
 some sort of informed speculation about it.

1:44:27.580 --> 1:44:30.460
 And as you pointed out, it's not my area of expertise,

1:44:30.460 --> 1:44:32.020
 but I know a little bit about it.

1:44:32.020 --> 1:44:37.020
 And I mean, I think that a secure attachment style,

1:44:37.020 --> 1:44:39.060
 if both partners have a secure attachment style,

1:44:39.060 --> 1:44:41.140
 that's conducive to a long-term mateship.

1:44:42.180 --> 1:44:45.100
 Avoidant attachment styles,

1:44:45.100 --> 1:44:49.180
 avoidant people tend to have more difficulty with intimacy

1:44:49.180 --> 1:44:51.700
 and also higher probability of infidelity.

1:44:52.940 --> 1:44:57.340
 And anxious attachment style, I don't know,

1:44:57.340 --> 1:45:01.420
 can create problems of its own in the overly clingy,

1:45:01.420 --> 1:45:06.100
 dependent, absorbing, what I call high relationship load.

1:45:06.100 --> 1:45:08.500
 So there's like mutation load,

1:45:08.500 --> 1:45:10.420
 which we all have a certain number of mutations.

1:45:10.420 --> 1:45:14.540
 There's parasite load.

1:45:14.540 --> 1:45:16.540
 There's also what I call relationship load.

1:45:16.540 --> 1:45:18.700
 So what is the baggage that someone brings

1:45:18.700 --> 1:45:19.980
 to the relationship?

1:45:19.980 --> 1:45:22.260
 Probably correlated with the frequency of demand

1:45:22.260 --> 1:45:24.380
 of immediate text message responses.

1:45:24.380 --> 1:45:25.220
 Right.

1:45:25.220 --> 1:45:26.460
 Well, I think the frequency of demand,

1:45:26.460 --> 1:45:27.860
 like the the latent,

1:45:27.860 --> 1:45:31.940
 the expected low latency of text message responses

1:45:31.940 --> 1:45:34.860
 plays out consistently in relationships.

1:45:34.860 --> 1:45:37.060
 Early on, there's a very low expectation of response.

1:45:37.060 --> 1:45:39.340
 And then as people get attached,

1:45:39.340 --> 1:45:40.900
 depending on their level of anxiety,

1:45:40.900 --> 1:45:42.900
 if they don't hear back from somebody really quickly,

1:45:42.900 --> 1:45:46.940
 where the mind goes is a very interesting aspect.

1:45:46.940 --> 1:45:48.660
 Do you become suspicious? Do you become anxious?

1:45:48.660 --> 1:45:51.180
 Can you stabilize your own internal milieu?

1:45:51.180 --> 1:45:54.900
 Or do you need to see the dot dot dot that's coming back?

1:45:54.900 --> 1:45:57.140
 I'd love to see a study on that at some point.

1:45:57.140 --> 1:45:57.980
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:45:57.980 --> 1:45:58.820
 No, that's a good one.

1:45:58.820 --> 1:46:01.980
 And my intuition suggests that your prediction

1:46:01.980 --> 1:46:03.940
 about that would pan out.

1:46:03.940 --> 1:46:06.940
 It would be the insecure that would really be,

1:46:06.940 --> 1:46:09.420
 you know, getting upset if there were not

1:46:09.420 --> 1:46:11.500
 that immediate response to the text.

1:46:11.500 --> 1:46:13.580
 Yeah, I have a friend, a female friend

1:46:13.580 --> 1:46:17.220
 who deliberately quote unquote using her language

1:46:17.220 --> 1:46:21.860
 trains her potential partners to be comfortable

1:46:21.860 --> 1:46:24.060
 with a variable response latency.

1:46:24.060 --> 1:46:26.100
 But then I asked her if she's comfortable

1:46:26.100 --> 1:46:27.420
 with a variable response latency,

1:46:27.420 --> 1:46:29.340
 and she said, absolutely not.

1:46:29.340 --> 1:46:32.940
 So there's an asymmetry, at least in that case.

1:46:34.100 --> 1:46:37.060
 This is almost certainly a more rare circumstance,

1:46:37.060 --> 1:46:39.980
 but I'd be remiss if I didn't ask

1:46:39.980 --> 1:46:42.380
 about unconventional relationships.

1:46:43.420 --> 1:46:46.100
 These days, I don't think it's just by virtue

1:46:46.100 --> 1:46:47.660
 of living in California.

1:46:47.660 --> 1:46:51.260
 You hear more and more about monogamish

1:46:51.260 --> 1:46:53.740
 as opposed to monogamous.

1:46:53.740 --> 1:46:56.300
 And various forms of polyamory

1:46:56.300 --> 1:46:58.980
 that may or may not include the amory part.

1:47:00.620 --> 1:47:02.500
 You know, passes and permission

1:47:03.580 --> 1:47:08.100
 based on seasons, circumstance, and prior infidelities.

1:47:08.100 --> 1:47:11.580
 Like, okay, somebody had a mishap early on,

1:47:11.580 --> 1:47:15.180
 you know, you have one pass, so to speak.

1:47:15.180 --> 1:47:17.380
 And you hear this kind of language getting thrown around.

1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:21.180
 And it's intriguing to me because it seems like

1:47:21.180 --> 1:47:25.060
 an effort to bypass some of the more,

1:47:26.460 --> 1:47:27.820
 if you will, hardwired,

1:47:27.820 --> 1:47:29.980
 or at least culturally hardwired aspects

1:47:29.980 --> 1:47:32.220
 of mate choice and sexual partner choice.

1:47:32.220 --> 1:47:34.780
 You know, acknowledging jealousy,

1:47:34.780 --> 1:47:36.900
 but confronting it by allowing your partner

1:47:36.900 --> 1:47:38.980
 to be with somebody else, for instance.

1:47:38.980 --> 1:47:40.660
 I confess I have friends

1:47:40.660 --> 1:47:43.060
 who have unconventional relationships.

1:47:43.060 --> 1:47:45.580
 I have friends with conventional relationships.

1:47:45.580 --> 1:47:48.020
 Any thoughts on polyamory?

1:47:48.020 --> 1:47:50.460
 Yeah, I do have a couple of thoughts on it.

1:47:50.460 --> 1:47:52.060
 I haven't studied it extensively,

1:47:52.060 --> 1:47:55.860
 but I think that the way I would phrase it

1:47:55.860 --> 1:47:59.100
 is that there's an attempt to

1:48:00.060 --> 1:48:03.580
 overcome certain evolved

1:48:04.780 --> 1:48:07.460
 features of our mating psychology,

1:48:07.460 --> 1:48:10.460
 but often in the service of other aspects

1:48:10.460 --> 1:48:11.700
 of our mating psychology.

1:48:11.700 --> 1:48:13.020
 So what I mean by that is this.

1:48:13.020 --> 1:48:15.180
 So talk about polyamory.

1:48:15.180 --> 1:48:18.740
 First of all, there's a sex difference on average.

1:48:18.740 --> 1:48:21.700
 That is, men are more likely to want to initiate

1:48:21.700 --> 1:48:24.060
 a polyamorous relationship than women.

1:48:24.060 --> 1:48:25.260
 There are lots of exceptions,

1:48:25.260 --> 1:48:29.500
 and I actually know of at least one exception personally,

1:48:29.500 --> 1:48:33.260
 friends of mine who are in a polyamorous relationship.

1:48:33.260 --> 1:48:35.580
 But the motivation for men

1:48:35.580 --> 1:48:38.820
 is that evolved desire for sexual variety.

1:48:38.820 --> 1:48:43.820
 So it gives him access to a wider variety of sex partners,

1:48:44.260 --> 1:48:46.900
 which is part of our evolved sexual psychology,

1:48:46.900 --> 1:48:48.820
 especially for men.

1:48:48.820 --> 1:48:50.940
 Women, one motivation,

1:48:50.940 --> 1:48:53.540
 now women also have a desire for sexual variety,

1:48:53.540 --> 1:48:56.860
 on average tends not to be as great as that of men,

1:48:56.860 --> 1:48:58.380
 but also have it.

1:48:58.380 --> 1:49:02.580
 But some women agree to a polyamorous relationship

1:49:02.580 --> 1:49:04.580
 as a mate retention tactic.

1:49:04.580 --> 1:49:08.260
 That is, this guy, in order to keep him,

1:49:08.260 --> 1:49:10.140
 she has to agree to the relationship.

1:49:10.140 --> 1:49:14.020
 And so the motivations for engaging in polyamory

1:49:14.020 --> 1:49:16.380
 are somewhat sex differentiated.

1:49:16.380 --> 1:49:17.220
 On average.

1:49:17.220 --> 1:49:19.540
 On average, on average, there's lots of exceptions.

1:49:19.540 --> 1:49:22.420
 So now when it comes to sexual jealousy,

1:49:22.420 --> 1:49:24.340
 there is this recognition that there,

1:49:24.340 --> 1:49:26.260
 and the way that I would frame it,

1:49:26.260 --> 1:49:27.980
 there's this evolved emotion,

1:49:27.980 --> 1:49:30.740
 where it triggers sexual jealousy,

1:49:30.740 --> 1:49:32.460
 seeing your partner having sex

1:49:32.460 --> 1:49:34.300
 or imagining your partner having sex

1:49:34.300 --> 1:49:37.020
 or falling in love with someone else.

1:49:37.020 --> 1:49:39.860
 But interestingly, and there haven't been studies on this,

1:49:39.860 --> 1:49:42.260
 but I know of this one polyamorous couple

1:49:42.260 --> 1:49:43.860
 where they reported to me,

1:49:43.860 --> 1:49:46.540
 both of them reported to me,

1:49:46.540 --> 1:49:50.100
 she said it doesn't bother her at all

1:49:50.100 --> 1:49:52.180
 if her husband, they're married,

1:49:52.180 --> 1:49:53.660
 has sex with other women.

1:49:53.660 --> 1:49:54.500
 They allow it.

1:49:54.500 --> 1:49:56.300
 I think it's like every Thursday night or whatever,

1:49:56.300 --> 1:49:58.940
 they have the different couples have different rules.

1:49:59.820 --> 1:50:02.820
 But one time she saw him walking down the street

1:50:02.820 --> 1:50:06.460
 hand in hand affectionately with a former girlfriend,

1:50:06.460 --> 1:50:08.620
 and she got extremely jealous.

1:50:08.620 --> 1:50:11.300
 So because it signaled an emotional connection.

1:50:11.300 --> 1:50:12.660
 So the sexual didn't bother her,

1:50:12.660 --> 1:50:14.260
 the emotional did.

1:50:14.260 --> 1:50:16.540
 She happens to be bisexual.

1:50:16.540 --> 1:50:21.540
 And she and her partner said that it really upset him

1:50:22.060 --> 1:50:23.900
 when she slept with other men,

1:50:23.900 --> 1:50:26.540
 but it was fine if she slept with other women.

1:50:26.540 --> 1:50:28.060
 I think that's a fairly common thing

1:50:28.060 --> 1:50:29.900
 that among the men that I know

1:50:29.900 --> 1:50:31.540
 that are in polyamorous relationships,

1:50:31.540 --> 1:50:33.100
 that that's a fairly common statement.

1:50:33.100 --> 1:50:34.860
 Yeah, so he kept trying to,

1:50:34.860 --> 1:50:38.260
 in these internecine manipulations,

1:50:38.260 --> 1:50:41.580
 trying to encourage her to sleep with other women,

1:50:41.580 --> 1:50:43.060
 but not with men.

1:50:43.980 --> 1:50:45.460
 And in her case,

1:50:45.460 --> 1:50:47.740
 encouraging him not to get emotionally involved

1:50:47.740 --> 1:50:50.340
 with other women, but the sex was okay.

1:50:50.340 --> 1:50:51.940
 So I think that, you know,

1:50:51.940 --> 1:50:53.940
 I think that in the modern environment,

1:50:53.940 --> 1:50:55.580
 you know, we have a very rich

1:50:55.580 --> 1:50:58.580
 and complicated evolved mating psychology.

1:50:58.580 --> 1:51:03.060
 And what we're doing in these novel forms are semi-novel,

1:51:03.060 --> 1:51:06.620
 because these things have a pretty deep history themselves,

1:51:06.620 --> 1:51:11.620
 that we're attempting to maximize

1:51:11.940 --> 1:51:13.860
 some of our evolved desires

1:51:13.860 --> 1:51:18.540
 while keeping quiescent other evolved aspects

1:51:18.540 --> 1:51:20.940
 of our sexual psychology, like jealousy.

1:51:20.940 --> 1:51:24.020
 So satisfying our desire for sexual variety,

1:51:24.020 --> 1:51:25.980
 but keeping jealousy at bay.

1:51:25.980 --> 1:51:27.580
 And different couples do it in different ways.

1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:29.700
 So as you alluded to,

1:51:29.700 --> 1:51:32.900
 so I know one couple where live in Los Angeles

1:51:32.900 --> 1:51:35.740
 and the woman from the woman said,

1:51:35.740 --> 1:51:38.100
 she gives her husband permission to have an affair,

1:51:38.100 --> 1:51:38.940
 sleep with other women,

1:51:38.940 --> 1:51:41.900
 as long as it's outside of the city limits of LA.

1:51:41.900 --> 1:51:43.140
 You know, and this other couple,

1:51:43.140 --> 1:51:45.980
 it has to be Thursday night, you know?

1:51:45.980 --> 1:51:47.420
 And so different, people have different arrangements.

1:51:47.420 --> 1:51:48.860
 So there are constraints on,

1:51:48.860 --> 1:51:52.140
 but the constraints are specific

1:51:52.140 --> 1:51:54.460
 and somewhat arbitrary to the relationship.

1:51:54.460 --> 1:51:55.300
 Yeah, yeah.

1:51:55.300 --> 1:51:59.140
 They're specific and often in polyamorous relationships,

1:51:59.140 --> 1:52:02.700
 people talk it out and come to an agreement

1:52:02.700 --> 1:52:05.540
 on what is acceptable and what's out of bounds.

1:52:05.540 --> 1:52:10.300
 So, but in a way, I mean, in a way it's just,

1:52:10.300 --> 1:52:13.540
 you know, we can't change our evolved sexual psychology,

1:52:13.540 --> 1:52:14.540
 I don't think.

1:52:14.540 --> 1:52:17.820
 What we can do is we can activate certain elements of it

1:52:17.820 --> 1:52:20.060
 and keep others quiescent.

1:52:20.060 --> 1:52:22.780
 And that's all good.

1:52:22.780 --> 1:52:25.660
 In a way we do in the modern environment.

1:52:25.660 --> 1:52:29.900
 So even to take it outside of polyamory, pornography.

1:52:29.900 --> 1:52:33.060
 Okay, widely consumed internet pornography.

1:52:33.940 --> 1:52:34.780
 What does that do?

1:52:34.780 --> 1:52:36.220
 Well, there's a big sex difference there.

1:52:36.220 --> 1:52:38.980
 Men tend to consume it a lot more than women.

1:52:38.980 --> 1:52:42.020
 The forms of the pornography are different,

1:52:42.020 --> 1:52:44.820
 but in a way, the pornography, what it does is it

1:52:44.820 --> 1:52:48.020
 parasitize men's evolved desire for sexual variety

1:52:48.020 --> 1:52:52.180
 so they can, in some sense,

1:52:52.180 --> 1:52:56.380
 psychologically experience sexual variety

1:52:56.380 --> 1:52:59.140
 of different women sexually without actually doing it

1:52:59.140 --> 1:53:01.260
 by just looking at their computer screen.

1:53:01.260 --> 1:53:04.700
 And so in a way, another way of phrasing that

1:53:04.700 --> 1:53:09.700
 is that we create modern novel cultural inventions

1:53:09.900 --> 1:53:14.260
 in ways that satisfy our evolved desires

1:53:14.260 --> 1:53:16.460
 and our evolved sexual desires.

1:53:16.460 --> 1:53:19.540
 Yeah, it's interesting with the kind of explosion

1:53:19.540 --> 1:53:20.660
 of online pornography.

1:53:20.660 --> 1:53:23.380
 I have a colleague at Stanford in psychiatry,

1:53:23.380 --> 1:53:25.300
 Anna Lemke, who studies the dopamine system.

1:53:25.300 --> 1:53:27.700
 And she mentioned two things of interest.

1:53:27.700 --> 1:53:31.140
 One is that not only is there a tremendous variety

1:53:31.140 --> 1:53:34.340
 of experiences that are available to people to view

1:53:34.340 --> 1:53:37.700
 in pornography, but the intensity is also quite high.

1:53:38.700 --> 1:53:41.420
 So much so that at least for young people

1:53:41.420 --> 1:53:44.820
 who are observing a lot of pornography, it's possible,

1:53:44.820 --> 1:53:46.420
 and there are studies looking at this now,

1:53:46.420 --> 1:53:48.060
 that their brain circuits become wired

1:53:48.060 --> 1:53:50.740
 to observing sexual acts as opposed to being engaged

1:53:50.740 --> 1:53:53.540
 in them, which can be extremely problematic.

1:53:53.540 --> 1:53:56.580
 So it's a sharp blade, so to speak.

1:53:57.380 --> 1:53:59.860
 This pornography thing isn't what it once was

1:53:59.860 --> 1:54:01.520
 and it's evolving quickly.

1:54:01.520 --> 1:54:06.520
 Very interesting, so how should one frame all this?

1:54:08.720 --> 1:54:10.760
 So I imagine a number of people listening

1:54:10.760 --> 1:54:15.040
 are in relationships or would hope to be in a relationship.

1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:18.040
 You know, in terms of understanding what we are selecting

1:54:18.040 --> 1:54:21.160
 for consciously or subconsciously,

1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:22.560
 it seems like there are common themes.

1:54:22.560 --> 1:54:27.080
 It's people want to feel attractive and attracted.

1:54:27.080 --> 1:54:30.560
 People want to make sure that there's stability

1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:31.400
 of the relationship.

1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:33.520
 So when we hear about security, oftentimes I think

1:54:33.520 --> 1:54:37.400
 of this kind of warm oxytocin, serotonin-like thing,

1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:42.400
 but this mate value seems so powerful in all this,

1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:43.720
 assessing mate value.

1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:48.720
 So how objective are people about assessing their own value

1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:53.160
 in terms of finding, securing,

1:54:53.160 --> 1:54:55.000
 and over time maintaining a relationship?

1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.360
 Securing is dynamic because people age at different rates.

1:55:00.360 --> 1:55:04.800
 Is there an objective metric of this stuff?

1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:08.000
 I guess you get a lot of statistics about somebody's image

1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.520
 and you find, come up with an average value

1:55:10.520 --> 1:55:12.040
 based on the population,

1:55:12.040 --> 1:55:13.960
 but how should people assess themselves?

1:55:13.960 --> 1:55:15.960
 Because it seems like one of the features

1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:20.320
 that would be very powerful for leading to happiness,

1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:23.960
 of good partner selection, that's stable,

1:55:23.960 --> 1:55:27.840
 where one doesn't have to resort to these Machiavellian

1:55:27.840 --> 1:55:30.760
 or diabolical or any of these other strategies

1:55:30.760 --> 1:55:34.040
 would be to be very honest with oneself.

1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:36.080
 And how does one do that?

1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:38.320
 Yeah, great questions.

1:55:38.320 --> 1:55:42.640
 And I don't think that the science has all the answers.

1:55:42.640 --> 1:55:44.840
 So a couple of things.

1:55:44.840 --> 1:55:48.960
 So one is that I think people are generally pretty good

1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:51.080
 at self-assessing mate value

1:55:51.080 --> 1:55:56.080
 and even self-esteem has been hypothesized

1:55:56.480 --> 1:55:59.760
 to be one internal monitoring device

1:55:59.760 --> 1:56:01.520
 that tracks mate value.

1:56:01.520 --> 1:56:03.200
 So when we get a promotion at work

1:56:03.200 --> 1:56:04.360
 or we get a rise in status,

1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:06.880
 we feel an elevated sense of self-esteem.

1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:09.080
 We get fired, we get rejected,

1:56:09.080 --> 1:56:12.200
 we get ostracized, our self-esteem plummets.

1:56:12.200 --> 1:56:15.480
 So our self-evaluation, I think,

1:56:15.480 --> 1:56:19.120
 does track mate value to some extent.

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:22.240
 There are people who overestimate their mate value,

1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:25.720
 people high on narcissism in particular,

1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:28.960
 and some people underestimate their mate value.

1:56:28.960 --> 1:56:31.200
 Another important element

1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:34.840
 is that there's consensual mate value.

1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:38.800
 So that is, if you asked a group of 100 people,

1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:40.240
 there's a fair amount of consensus

1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:42.840
 that this person's an eight, that person's a six.

1:56:42.840 --> 1:56:46.160
 But there are also individual differences in mate value.

1:56:46.160 --> 1:56:49.880
 So one example is I know a woman who's a professor

1:56:49.880 --> 1:56:54.120
 and she places a high premium on guys

1:56:54.120 --> 1:56:57.440
 who are deeply steeped in Russian literature,

1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:00.520
 which she is, so that she can have in-depth conversations

1:57:00.520 --> 1:57:01.760
 about Russian literature.

1:57:01.760 --> 1:57:03.960
 Note to young men, learn Russian literature.

1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:06.160
 Well, but this is high

1:57:06.160 --> 1:57:09.200
 and it's a dimension of mate value that's important for her,

1:57:09.200 --> 1:57:12.160
 but probably not important for a lot of other people.

1:57:12.160 --> 1:57:15.000
 And so, whereas other people, let's say, might be,

1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:20.000
 let's say you're into football or some sport,

1:57:20.240 --> 1:57:24.240
 then, and the other partner thinks sports are stupid,

1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:27.960
 then that's, someone who's also into sports

1:57:27.960 --> 1:57:29.840
 is gonna be higher in mate value for you.

1:57:29.840 --> 1:57:31.760
 So there are these individual differences

1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:34.080
 in components of mate value, which is good,

1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:35.280
 because that means if everyone

1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:37.760
 were going after the same people

1:57:37.760 --> 1:57:40.400
 and there was total consensus on mate value,

1:57:40.400 --> 1:57:43.240
 then there would be a lot of mate-less people

1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:45.280
 and a lot of problems in the world

1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:47.040
 and a lot of dissatisfied people.

1:57:47.040 --> 1:57:51.320
 So both are important, the consensual aspects

1:57:51.320 --> 1:57:56.320
 and the individually differentiated components of mate value.

1:57:58.560 --> 1:58:02.440
 But in terms of accuracy of assessment,

1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:06.520
 it's, there are no good measures scientifically to do this

1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:09.600
 because it's sufficiently complicated.

1:58:09.600 --> 1:58:13.720
 So I mentioned, we've mentioned maybe

1:58:13.720 --> 1:58:16.680
 a dozen different components of mate value,

1:58:16.680 --> 1:58:19.800
 physical attractiveness, kindness, emotional stability,

1:58:19.800 --> 1:58:24.800
 health status, et cetera, and these aren't the only ones.

1:58:24.840 --> 1:58:28.600
 So I teach a course on psychology of human mating

1:58:28.600 --> 1:58:30.760
 and I ask the people, it's a large course,

1:58:30.760 --> 1:58:32.720
 couple hundred people, tell me,

1:58:32.720 --> 1:58:34.760
 what do women want in a mate?

1:58:34.760 --> 1:58:36.600
 And so I started with the blackboard.

1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:37.920
 This is back in the old days

1:58:37.920 --> 1:58:40.080
 when there was a blackboard, a piece of chalk.

1:58:40.080 --> 1:58:42.120
 They say, oh, I want a mate who has a good sense of humor,

1:58:42.120 --> 1:58:45.280
 sorry, sense of humor, intelligent, right, kind.

1:58:45.280 --> 1:58:49.040
 And so I go through this and I go through five blackboards

1:58:49.040 --> 1:58:51.760
 and then I run out of space over what women want.

1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:52.920
 Now I do the same for men

1:58:52.920 --> 1:58:54.320
 and men kind of run out of space

1:58:54.320 --> 1:58:56.600
 after about a blackboard and a half.

1:58:56.600 --> 1:59:00.280
 But what that tells me is that these qualities

1:59:00.280 --> 1:59:02.960
 are large in number and complicated in nature.

1:59:02.960 --> 1:59:06.760
 So you say you want a guy who's nice and generous.

1:59:06.760 --> 1:59:08.400
 And they say, yeah, so like a guy

1:59:08.400 --> 1:59:10.640
 who at the end of every month takes his whole paycheck

1:59:10.640 --> 1:59:14.120
 and gives it to the wino, a homeless person.

1:59:14.120 --> 1:59:17.480
 Well, no, not that generous, generous toward me,

1:59:17.480 --> 1:59:19.600
 but not toward everyone else.

1:59:19.600 --> 1:59:23.320
 Nice in general, but not so nice

1:59:23.320 --> 1:59:24.960
 that they're getting exploited.

1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:29.320
 So, or even, there's something, you can't be too healthy.

1:59:29.320 --> 1:59:32.640
 So people, that's unidimensional, but you want a guy,

1:59:32.640 --> 1:59:36.800
 women want a guy who's confident, but not too confident.

1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:39.240
 Because too confident will mean he's either arrogant,

1:59:39.240 --> 1:59:43.360
 narcissistic, or not sufficiently manipulable.

1:59:44.520 --> 1:59:47.760
 So anyway, so my point is that

1:59:47.760 --> 1:59:50.920
 because there's so many different components of mate value

1:59:50.920 --> 1:59:54.400
 and that they vary in amount,

1:59:54.400 --> 1:59:57.200
 so it's not just listing the qualities and summing them up,

1:59:57.200 --> 1:59:58.640
 they vary in amount,

1:59:58.640 --> 2:00:02.400
 it's a very complicated endeavor to assess accurately.

2:00:02.400 --> 2:00:05.960
 But I think people have a good intuitive sense

2:00:05.960 --> 2:00:08.160
 of people's relative mate value,

2:00:08.160 --> 2:00:10.240
 especially if you're in a group

2:00:10.240 --> 2:00:13.000
 and you've been able to interact with them for a long time.

2:00:13.000 --> 2:00:17.480
 And one indication is, again, that attention structure,

2:00:17.480 --> 2:00:20.880
 how many other people really want to mate with this person,

2:00:20.880 --> 2:00:23.520
 that's a good cue that they're high in mate value.

2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:25.120
 Nobody wants to mate with you,

2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:27.520
 then cue that you're low in mate value.

2:00:28.440 --> 2:00:30.840
 Reminds me of the time when one is trying to decide

2:00:30.840 --> 2:00:32.880
 who to ask to the prom.

2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:35.600
 You know, there's a complicated assessment

2:00:35.600 --> 2:00:38.160
 based on who one would like to go with,

2:00:38.160 --> 2:00:40.080
 whether or not you're already partnered,

2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:41.520
 who would say yes, who would say no,

2:00:41.520 --> 2:00:43.720
 because there's a risk in rejection too,

2:00:43.720 --> 2:00:47.360
 because that, if I'm guessing correctly,

2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:50.280
 could lower one's own perceived mate value.

2:00:50.280 --> 2:00:51.680
 Yeah, it's getting rejected.

2:00:51.680 --> 2:00:53.480
 Right, frequency of rejections

2:00:53.480 --> 2:00:55.000
 probably doesn't lend itself well

2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:59.520
 to increasing one's own view of their mate value.

2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:01.800
 Right, which is why many guys have

2:01:01.800 --> 2:01:04.640
 what I call mating anxiety.

2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:08.000
 That is, they don't approach them

2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.400
 because they risk getting shot down.

2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:12.880
 They're trying to maintain that number

2:01:14.240 --> 2:01:16.360
 by reducing the amount of data.

2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:17.760
 Right. Yeah.

2:01:17.760 --> 2:01:18.880
 Very interesting.

2:01:18.880 --> 2:01:22.760
 But it backfires in the modern environment.

2:01:22.760 --> 2:01:25.560
 So there's a famous psychologist, Albert Ellis,

2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:28.400
 who had mating anxiety and he assigned himself

2:01:28.400 --> 2:01:30.880
 the task of approaching, asking,

2:01:30.880 --> 2:01:32.360
 like I can't remember what the number was,

2:01:32.360 --> 2:01:34.800
 but let's say 50 women out on dates.

2:01:34.800 --> 2:01:35.800
 He lived in New York City,

2:01:35.800 --> 2:01:37.160
 so it was either a lot of women.

2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:39.160
 He could just stand still and they would stream past.

2:01:39.160 --> 2:01:40.600
 Yeah, and he assigned himself,

2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:45.000
 like ask 50 women on a date, you know, every week.

2:01:45.000 --> 2:01:46.280
 And he said, after two weeks,

2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:47.720
 his mating anxiety disappeared,

2:01:47.720 --> 2:01:50.840
 because most of them said, buzz off, creep.

2:01:50.840 --> 2:01:53.520
 But he decided, well, he's actually getting rejected,

2:01:53.520 --> 2:01:55.200
 didn't cause my world to collapse,

2:01:55.200 --> 2:01:56.480
 and it actually was okay.

2:01:56.480 --> 2:02:00.120
 And so he kind of inured himself to this rejection.

2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:02.720
 And so it ended up,

2:02:02.720 --> 2:02:05.040
 he ended up doing quite well on his mating life.

2:02:05.040 --> 2:02:07.720
 Another point for cognitive behavioral desensitization.

2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:08.640
 Yes, exactly.

2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:10.440
 He ran the experiment.

2:02:10.440 --> 2:02:11.880
 Just a couple more questions.

2:02:11.880 --> 2:02:15.800
 Earlier, you mentioned self-deception based deception,

2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:19.920
 or something of that sort, self-deception,

2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:22.680
 that people aren't always trying to convince somebody else

2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:24.760
 of something that secretly they know isn't true,

2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:27.400
 but that they deceive themselves.

2:02:27.400 --> 2:02:28.720
 Could you embellish on that a little bit?

2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:30.120
 So, well, this is actually,

2:02:30.120 --> 2:02:33.640
 this hypothesis is the famous evolutionary biologist,

2:02:33.640 --> 2:02:36.320
 Robert Trivers, first advanced this hypothesis

2:02:36.320 --> 2:02:41.320
 in the preface in 1976 to Dawkins' book, The Selfish Gene.

2:02:42.320 --> 2:02:46.040
 And he subsequently written more about it,

2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:49.880
 both in scientific article and in a more popular book.

2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:51.760
 But the idea is that if,

2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:54.960
 the core idea is that successful deception

2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:57.760
 is facilitated by self-deception.

2:02:57.760 --> 2:03:02.560
 So if you really believe that in X,

2:03:02.560 --> 2:03:04.760
 then you're gonna be a more successful salesman

2:03:04.760 --> 2:03:06.680
 to convince other people of X.

2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:10.320
 So if you believe you're, let's say, a 10 and mate value,

2:03:10.320 --> 2:03:13.560
 you truly believe it, even if you're not,

2:03:13.560 --> 2:03:16.360
 I'm gonna have a more successful time convincing you

2:03:16.360 --> 2:03:17.800
 that I am as well.

2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:20.160
 And so the hypothesis is basically

2:03:20.160 --> 2:03:22.440
 that people self-deceive in order

2:03:22.440 --> 2:03:26.800
 to increase the effectiveness of actual deception.

2:03:29.400 --> 2:03:34.400
 But I think that there are people who are,

2:03:34.920 --> 2:03:36.880
 so in one other dimension I'll mention too

2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:39.560
 is that animals often take each other

2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:41.760
 at our own word for things.

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:43.560
 So if we're self-confident,

2:03:43.560 --> 2:03:46.040
 people assume that we must have the goods

2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:48.000
 to back up that self-confidence.

2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.200
 If we're a quivering mass of insecurity,

2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:51.320
 people believe, well,

2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:54.000
 we don't have the goods to back up anything.

2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:58.040
 And so people use other people's displays

2:03:58.040 --> 2:04:01.680
 of their self-confidence as a cue to their goods.

2:04:01.680 --> 2:04:04.760
 And it's in general, a pretty reliable cue,

2:04:04.760 --> 2:04:07.480
 but then there are overestimates and underestimates

2:04:07.480 --> 2:04:10.120
 as we've talked about, like with narcissism.

2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:13.000
 Yeah, we see this with the job candidates.

2:04:13.000 --> 2:04:16.400
 You are taught to look very carefully at the application

2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:18.360
 and consider all aspects,

2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:21.840
 but ultimately you consider that also in light of

2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:24.160
 how firmly someone believes in the vision

2:04:24.160 --> 2:04:27.440
 of what they're trying to bring to the profession.

2:04:27.440 --> 2:04:31.040
 And that's, I think, largely a subconscious process

2:04:31.040 --> 2:04:33.360
 and that being aware of it can be helpful.

2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:34.560
 But yeah, when somebody is confident,

2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:35.880
 you tend to think that they're going to get

2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:37.400
 where they say they're going to go.

2:04:37.400 --> 2:04:41.960
 And it acts as a bit of a heuristic for not needing,

2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:43.880
 the impulse is that one then doesn't need

2:04:43.880 --> 2:04:46.080
 to go vet all the information quite as carefully,

2:04:46.080 --> 2:04:47.680
 but I guess if one is aware of it,

2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:51.040
 then to dig deeper in,

2:04:51.040 --> 2:04:53.320
 because it seems like there's a lot of deception going on.

2:04:53.320 --> 2:04:55.200
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:04:55.200 --> 2:05:00.200
 Well, and something we talked about earlier,

2:05:00.600 --> 2:05:05.440
 people high on psychopathy are very good at deception.

2:05:05.440 --> 2:05:09.760
 I don't know whether they are good at self-deception

2:05:09.760 --> 2:05:12.280
 or whether they're just really good deceivers,

2:05:12.280 --> 2:05:15.840
 but they can be very effective.

2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:20.160
 And out in California, you live out in California,

2:05:20.160 --> 2:05:23.520
 I'm sure you've seen your fair share of cases like that.

2:05:23.520 --> 2:05:27.280
 Oh yeah, I think across today's discussion

2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:29.000
 and various examples popped to mind

2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:34.000
 of seeing these features in humans, it's so interesting.

2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:36.600
 I find the work that you do incredibly interesting.

2:05:36.600 --> 2:05:38.600
 I think this field of evolutionary psychology

2:05:38.600 --> 2:05:43.160
 is fascinating and I hope, I said it before,

2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:44.000
 but I'll say it again,

2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:46.000
 I feel like neuroscience and evolutionary psychology

2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.120
 are nudging towards one another.

2:05:48.120 --> 2:05:49.560
 And it's only a matter of time

2:05:49.560 --> 2:05:53.200
 before they merge in some formal way.

2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:54.360
 I mean, there is the work, for instance,

2:05:54.360 --> 2:05:56.680
 on polygamous versus monogamous prairie voles

2:05:56.680 --> 2:05:57.960
 and levels of vasopressin,

2:05:57.960 --> 2:06:01.360
 but it's a big leap to go from vasopressin in a prairie vole,

2:06:01.360 --> 2:06:03.040
 no disrespect to that beautiful work,

2:06:03.040 --> 2:06:06.040
 but to humans and say, oh, vasopressin inhalers

2:06:06.040 --> 2:06:08.280
 are going to make you monogamous or something.

2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:10.480
 I think that's, I probably got the direction

2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:12.120
 of the effect wrong, but you get the point.

2:06:12.120 --> 2:06:13.560
 Yeah, no, I think you're absolutely right.

2:06:13.560 --> 2:06:15.640
 And I think it will happen.

2:06:15.640 --> 2:06:18.160
 I think it's starting to happen and it will happen

2:06:18.160 --> 2:06:20.240
 because getting at the neuroscience

2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:22.080
 is getting at the underlying mechanisms

2:06:22.080 --> 2:06:23.800
 that are driving the process.

2:06:23.800 --> 2:06:27.480
 So what an evolutionary perspective brings to bear

2:06:27.480 --> 2:06:32.040
 is evolved function and ultimate explanation,

2:06:32.040 --> 2:06:35.080
 the selective forces that created adaptations,

2:06:35.080 --> 2:06:37.120
 the functions of those adaptations

2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:38.640
 and the neuroscience brings,

2:06:38.640 --> 2:06:40.760
 well, what is the underlying machinery

2:06:40.760 --> 2:06:43.960
 that these mechanisms are instantiated in?

2:06:43.960 --> 2:06:46.200
 Yeah, it would be wonderful to collaborate someday.

2:06:46.200 --> 2:06:48.040
 Maybe we'll do a brain imaging study

2:06:48.040 --> 2:06:50.720
 on jealousy or something in, I don't know,

2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:52.920
 and throw it, you're the psychologist.

2:06:52.920 --> 2:06:56.400
 You would come up with a beautiful experimental design.

2:06:56.400 --> 2:06:58.240
 I'm certain that people are going to want

2:06:58.240 --> 2:06:59.600
 to learn more about your work.

2:06:59.600 --> 2:07:00.880
 Certainly we will give them links

2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:03.480
 to your social media and other sites.

2:07:03.480 --> 2:07:04.840
 You've written a tremendous number

2:07:04.840 --> 2:07:06.920
 of really interesting books.

2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:09.400
 Tell us about your most recent book

2:07:09.400 --> 2:07:10.800
 and maybe some of the others that,

2:07:10.800 --> 2:07:12.440
 if people are interested in these topics

2:07:12.440 --> 2:07:15.120
 and they want to learn more, that they could explore.

2:07:15.120 --> 2:07:16.760
 Sure.

2:07:16.760 --> 2:07:18.800
 Okay, so, well, my most recent book

2:07:18.800 --> 2:07:21.280
 is called When Men Behave Badly,

2:07:21.280 --> 2:07:23.960
 The Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,

2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:25.800
 Harassment, and Assault.

2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:29.120
 And that book deals with conflict between the sexes,

2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:30.280
 sexual conflict.

2:07:30.280 --> 2:07:35.280
 And so it deals with them both in what I call

2:07:35.280 --> 2:07:36.920
 mating market conflicts,

2:07:36.920 --> 2:07:38.600
 some of the topics we've been talking about,

2:07:38.600 --> 2:07:41.960
 deception in internet dating and things like that.

2:07:41.960 --> 2:07:46.040
 Second is conflict that occurs within mating relationships

2:07:46.040 --> 2:07:48.200
 of the sort that we've been talking about as well.

2:07:48.200 --> 2:07:50.560
 Financial infidelity, emotional infidelity,

2:07:50.560 --> 2:07:54.080
 sexual infidelity, coping with conflict

2:07:54.080 --> 2:07:55.240
 within a relationship.

2:07:55.240 --> 2:07:58.040
 And I actually have some suggestions for strategies

2:07:58.040 --> 2:08:01.360
 for coping with conflict within a relationship.

2:08:01.360 --> 2:08:05.120
 Coping in the after, dealing with the aftermath of breakups.

2:08:05.120 --> 2:08:06.560
 So often there's an asymmetry.

2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:08.960
 One person wants to break up, the other doesn't.

2:08:08.960 --> 2:08:11.800
 So I talk about coping in the aftermath.

2:08:11.800 --> 2:08:13.960
 And then I also talk in this book,

2:08:13.960 --> 2:08:15.160
 When Men Behave Badly,

2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:18.320
 about some of the darker sides of human mating,

2:08:18.320 --> 2:08:20.640
 like intimate partner violence,

2:08:21.600 --> 2:08:25.520
 stalking, sexual harassment, sexual coercion.

2:08:25.520 --> 2:08:26.880
 So that's what that book's about.

2:08:26.880 --> 2:08:30.440
 And I think it's gotten well-reviewed

2:08:30.440 --> 2:08:33.640
 and people find it very useful in understanding

2:08:33.640 --> 2:08:37.160
 what is otherwise a lot of baffling phenomena.

2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:39.880
 Why do men and women seem at odds with each other

2:08:39.880 --> 2:08:41.160
 in so many domains?

2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:43.600
 Why do some of these recurrent forms

2:08:43.600 --> 2:08:45.680
 of sexual conflict occur?

2:08:45.680 --> 2:08:47.760
 So that's what that book's about.

2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:50.120
 My previous book, so my first book,

2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:51.520
 which I've had the good fortune

2:08:51.520 --> 2:08:54.080
 to be able to revise a couple of times,

2:08:54.080 --> 2:08:57.440
 deals more broadly with human mating strategies.

2:08:57.440 --> 2:08:59.360
 It's called The Evolution of Desire,

2:08:59.360 --> 2:09:01.320
 Strategies of Human Mating,

2:09:01.320 --> 2:09:03.240
 and gives people a broad overview

2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:05.840
 of what people want in a mate,

2:09:05.840 --> 2:09:09.760
 tactics of attraction, tactics of mate retention,

2:09:09.760 --> 2:09:11.920
 and so forth throughout the whole mating process,

2:09:11.920 --> 2:09:15.920
 serial mating, causes of divorce, and so forth.

2:09:15.920 --> 2:09:18.160
 And then even more broadly,

2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:21.480
 I have a textbook called Evolutionary Psychology,

2:09:21.480 --> 2:09:23.480
 The New Science of the Mind,

2:09:23.480 --> 2:09:26.760
 which is in its sixth edition right now.

2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:29.120
 And it's the most widely used textbook

2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:32.400
 in evolutionary psychology around North America

2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:35.400
 and Europe, and actually it's been translated

2:09:35.400 --> 2:09:38.200
 even into Arabic and other countries.

2:09:38.200 --> 2:09:41.080
 So that deals somewhat with mating,

2:09:41.080 --> 2:09:43.840
 but also deals with survival problems

2:09:43.840 --> 2:09:46.480
 or evolved fears and phobias,

2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:51.760
 issues about kin and family, extended family,

2:09:51.760 --> 2:09:56.120
 friendships, social hierarchies, status hierarchies,

2:09:57.480 --> 2:09:59.120
 warfare, and other topics.

2:09:59.120 --> 2:10:01.560
 So The Evolutionary Psychology textbook

2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:03.320
 is the broadest book,

2:10:03.320 --> 2:10:05.600
 and then maybe the second broadest is

2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:09.320
 The Evolution of Desire, Strategies of Human Mating.

2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:12.680
 And then for those interested in conflict between the sexes,

2:10:12.680 --> 2:10:15.600
 the latest book, When Men Behave Badly.

2:10:15.600 --> 2:10:16.560
 Fantastic.

2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:19.520
 I love your work.

2:10:19.520 --> 2:10:23.120
 I'm so grateful for the clarity and depth and rigor

2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:26.000
 with which you do it and you convey it to us.

2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.200
 I know I speak for many people

2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:29.680
 when I just want to say thank you.

2:10:29.680 --> 2:10:32.600
 This is a tremendously informative conversation.

2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:33.440
 Thank you.

2:10:33.440 --> 2:10:35.000
 Well, it's been a delight to talk with you

2:10:35.000 --> 2:10:38.860
 and I hope we do engage in that research collaboration

2:10:38.860 --> 2:10:41.440
 of merging neuroscience and evolutionary psychology.

2:10:41.440 --> 2:10:42.280
 Let's do it.

2:10:42.280 --> 2:10:43.120
 All right.

2:10:43.120 --> 2:10:43.940
 Great. Thank you, David.

2:10:43.940 --> 2:10:44.780
 Thank you.

2:10:44.780 --> 2:10:46.560

 and there you can support this podcast

2:11:40.960 --> 2:11:42.560
 at any level that you like.

2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:44.660
 In many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

2:11:44.660 --> 2:11:46.400
 we discuss supplements.

2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:48.660
 While supplements might not be for everybody,

2:11:48.660 --> 2:11:51.080
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

2:11:51.080 --> 2:11:52.920
 for things like sleep and focus

2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:55.840
 and other aspects of human performance and daily life.

2:11:55.840 --> 2:11:57.880
 One issue with supplements is that many

2:11:57.880 --> 2:11:59.640
 of the supplement companies out there

2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:02.200
 are subpar with respect to quality,

2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:05.700
 and they are not precise about the specific amounts

2:12:05.700 --> 2:12:08.920
 of the various supplement contents that they include.

2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:11.680
 For that reason, we've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,

2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:14.240
 because Thorne supplements are known to have

2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:15.720
 the highest levels of stringency

2:12:15.720 --> 2:12:17.680
 in terms of the quality of the ingredients

2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:20.040
 and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients.

2:12:20.040 --> 2:12:21.820
 In other words, what's listed on the label

2:12:21.820 --> 2:12:24.120
 is what's actually in the bottle.

2:12:24.120 --> 2:12:25.600
 If you want to see what supplements I take,

2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:30.300

2:12:30.300 --> 2:12:32.240
 There, you can see the supplements I take.

2:12:32.240 --> 2:12:34.460
 You can get 20% off any of those supplements.

2:12:34.460 --> 2:12:37.120
 And if you navigate further into the Thorne site

2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:40.260
 through that portal, thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

2:12:40.260 --> 2:12:43.240
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:44.440
 that Thorne makes.

2:12:44.440 --> 2:12:46.960
 Thank you once again for joining me for my discussion

2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:50.280
 with Dr. David Buss about human mate selection and strategy

2:12:50.280 --> 2:12:53.560
 and many other extremely interesting topics today.

2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:56.280
 And last but not least, thank you for your interest

2:12:56.280 --> 2:12:57.120
 in science.

2:12:57.120 --> 2:13:23.720
 I'm Dr. David Buss and I'll see you next time.
