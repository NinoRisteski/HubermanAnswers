00:00.000 --> 00:02.260
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.260 --> 00:04.900
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.900 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.500 --> 00:10.740
 My name is Andrew Huberman,

00:10.740 --> 00:13.900
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.900 --> 00:15.860
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.860 --> 00:17.140
 This podcast is separate

00:17.140 --> 00:19.460
 from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

00:19.460 --> 00:21.840
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

00:21.840 --> 00:24.660
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

00:24.660 --> 00:27.780
 and science-related tools to the general public.

00:27.780 --> 00:29.380
 In keeping with that theme,

00:29.380 --> 00:32.420
 I want to thank the first sponsor of today's podcast.

00:32.420 --> 00:34.920
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.840
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

00:37.840 --> 00:41.780
 that analyzes blood factors and DNA-related factors

00:41.780 --> 00:45.200
 that helps you develop a personalized health plan.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.300
 Many important factors related to our health and wellbeing

00:48.300 --> 00:52.740
 can only be measured by a blood sample and by a DNA sample.

00:52.740 --> 00:55.580
 I've been getting my blood work done for many years now,

00:55.580 --> 00:57.060
 and I use Inside Tracker

00:57.060 --> 00:59.760
 because Inside Tracker makes it very easy

00:59.760 --> 01:01.860
 to not only get the blood work done,

01:01.860 --> 01:03.140
 someone can come to your house,

01:03.140 --> 01:05.420
 or you can go to a clinic, for instance,

01:05.420 --> 01:08.100
 but also to interpret the data that you get.

01:08.100 --> 01:10.260
 Oftentimes, when we get blood work done,

01:10.260 --> 01:11.980
 there are all these numbers and all these levels

01:11.980 --> 01:14.540
 of different hormones and metabolic factors and so forth,

01:14.540 --> 01:17.420
 but one doesn't know what to do with that information.

01:17.420 --> 01:20.260
 Inside Tracker has a terrific dashboard platform

01:20.260 --> 01:23.740
 where you go online and it makes analyzing all that easy,

01:23.740 --> 01:25.860
 and it also provides some very simple

01:25.860 --> 01:27.460
 and straightforward directives

01:27.460 --> 01:30.260
 in terms of exercise, nutrition,

01:30.260 --> 01:31.640
 and other lifestyle factors

01:31.640 --> 01:34.660
 that can help guide your health and improve your health.

01:34.660 --> 01:36.480
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

01:36.480 --> 01:39.900
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

01:39.900 --> 01:41.820
 and use the code Huberman at checkout

01:41.820 --> 01:44.700
 to get 25% off your order.

01:44.700 --> 01:47.660
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Headspace.

01:47.660 --> 01:51.180
 Headspace is a meditation app that makes meditating easy.

01:51.180 --> 01:54.480
 I've been meditating on and off for about three decades now,

01:54.480 --> 01:57.100
 and typically it's been more off than on.

01:57.100 --> 01:58.220
 I think like a lot of people,

01:58.220 --> 02:01.260
 I find it hard to stick with a meditation practice.

02:01.260 --> 02:04.020
 A few years ago, I started using the Headspace app,

02:04.020 --> 02:05.000
 and when I did that,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.520
 I found that I was meditating really consistently.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.640
 First of all, the meditations in Headspace

02:09.640 --> 02:12.820
 are backed by quality scientific peer-reviewed studies.

02:12.820 --> 02:16.100
 Second of all, the meditations allow the meditation

02:16.100 --> 02:19.080
 to be kind of easy and fun to access.

02:19.080 --> 02:21.340
 I started first using them when I would travel

02:21.340 --> 02:22.720
 because on JetBlue flights,

02:22.720 --> 02:24.520
 which was the airline I was using,

02:24.520 --> 02:27.640
 the meditations are offered as an alternative

02:27.640 --> 02:29.700
 to watching a TV or a movie.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.880
 And I found that I would arrive feeling much more refreshed

02:31.880 --> 02:34.380
 than had I just sort of zoned out on the TV the whole time

02:34.380 --> 02:36.380
 or even if I had slept.

02:36.380 --> 02:38.920
 I now continue to use Headspace regularly

02:38.920 --> 02:41.220
 pretty much every day for a short meditation,

02:41.220 --> 02:44.300
 and I personally derive tremendous benefits from it.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.120
 If you'd like to try Headspace,

02:46.120 --> 02:49.420
 you can go to headspace.com slash specialoffer,

02:49.420 --> 02:52.520
 and they'll give you one month of all the meditations

02:52.520 --> 02:54.380
 that they have available completely free.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.120
 That's the best offer available right now from Headspace.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.000
 So you can go to headspace.com slash specialoffer,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.100
 and you'll get one month completely free

03:02.100 --> 03:04.240
 all the meditations they have.

03:04.240 --> 03:07.020
 The third sponsor of today's podcast is Made For.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.260
 Made For is a behavioral science company

03:09.260 --> 03:11.060
 that is a subscription model

03:11.060 --> 03:13.200
 in which you engage in specific activities

03:13.200 --> 03:14.780
 each month for 10 months

03:14.780 --> 03:17.240
 in order to bring about positive behavioral change

03:17.240 --> 03:18.840
 and growth mindset.

03:18.840 --> 03:22.040
 The company was founded by former Navy Seal, Patrick Dossett

03:22.040 --> 03:25.600
 as well as Tom's founder, Blake Mycoskie.

03:25.600 --> 03:26.560
 I'm the lead advisor

03:26.560 --> 03:28.660
 of the Scientific Advisory Board at Made For,

03:28.660 --> 03:30.440
 and some of the other members of the advisory board

03:30.440 --> 03:32.400
 include the head of the Chronobiology Unit

03:32.400 --> 03:34.220
 at the National Institutes of Health,

03:34.220 --> 03:37.720
 as well as psychiatrists from Harvard, UC Irvine,

03:37.720 --> 03:40.660
 and many other individuals who are serious about science

03:40.660 --> 03:43.360
 and helped develop the Made For program.

03:43.360 --> 03:47.160
 If you want to try Made For, you can go to getmadefor.com,

03:47.160 --> 03:49.240
 and if you enter Huberman at checkout,

03:49.240 --> 03:52.300
 you'll get 15% off the program.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.800
 Today, we're talking about neural plasticity,

03:54.800 --> 03:58.180
 which is this incredible feature of our nervous systems

03:58.180 --> 04:01.880
 that allows it to change in response to experience.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.800
 Neural plasticity is arguably

04:03.800 --> 04:07.120
 one of the most important aspects of our biology.

04:07.120 --> 04:09.680
 It holds the promise for each and all of us

04:09.680 --> 04:13.280
 to think differently, to learn new things,

04:13.280 --> 04:15.800
 to forget painful experiences,

04:15.800 --> 04:19.480
 and to essentially adapt to anything that life brings us

04:19.480 --> 04:20.700
 by becoming better.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.560
 Neural plasticity has a long and important history,

04:24.560 --> 04:27.100
 and we're not going to review all of it in detail,

04:27.100 --> 04:29.040
 but today, what we are going to do

04:29.040 --> 04:32.360
 is discuss what is neural plasticity,

04:32.360 --> 04:35.480
 as well as the different forms of neural plasticity.

04:35.480 --> 04:39.080
 We're going to talk about how to access neural plasticity

04:39.080 --> 04:40.580
 depending on how old you are

04:40.580 --> 04:42.500
 and depending on the specific types of changes

04:42.500 --> 04:44.560
 that you're trying to create.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.860
 This is a topic for which there are lots of tools,

04:47.860 --> 04:50.280
 as well as lots of biological principles

04:50.280 --> 04:51.800
 that we can discuss.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.640
 So let's get started.

04:53.640 --> 04:56.840
 Most people are familiar with the word neural plasticity.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.980
 It's sometimes also called neuroplasticity.

04:59.980 --> 05:01.560
 Those are the same thing.

05:01.560 --> 05:05.320
 So if I say neuroplasticity or neuroplasticity,

05:05.320 --> 05:07.400
 I'm referring to the same process,

05:07.400 --> 05:09.920
 which is the brain and nervous system's ability

05:09.920 --> 05:12.440
 to change itself.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.080
 There are a lot of reasons why the nervous system

05:15.080 --> 05:16.720
 would do this.

05:16.720 --> 05:20.860
 It could do it in response to some traumatic event.

05:20.860 --> 05:23.680
 It could, for instance, create a sense of fear

05:23.680 --> 05:25.040
 around a particular place

05:25.040 --> 05:27.600
 or a fear of automobiles or planes.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.640
 It could also occur when something positive happens,

05:30.640 --> 05:32.800
 like the birth of our first child,

05:32.800 --> 05:35.640
 or when our puppy does something amusing,

05:35.640 --> 05:40.540
 or we see an incredible feat of performance in athleticism.

05:40.540 --> 05:44.480
 The word neuroplasticity means so many things

05:44.480 --> 05:45.700
 to so many different people

05:45.700 --> 05:46.700
 that I thought it would be important

05:46.700 --> 05:49.820
 to just first put a little bit of organizational logic

05:49.820 --> 05:52.300
 around what it is and how it happens.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.420
 Because nowadays, if you were to go online

05:54.420 --> 05:56.820
 and Google the word neuroplasticity,

05:56.820 --> 06:00.420
 you would find hundreds of thousands of references,

06:00.420 --> 06:01.900
 scientific references,

06:01.900 --> 06:03.260
 as well as a lot of falsehoods

06:03.260 --> 06:06.420
 about what neuroplasticity is and how to access it.

06:06.420 --> 06:07.280
 As I mentioned before,

06:07.280 --> 06:08.820
 we're going to talk about the science of it,

06:08.820 --> 06:10.060
 and we're going to talk about the tools

06:10.060 --> 06:12.700
 that allow you to engage this incredible feature

06:12.700 --> 06:13.900
 of your nervous system.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.040
 And that's the first point,

06:15.040 --> 06:18.220
 which is that all of us were born with a nervous system

06:18.220 --> 06:20.420
 that isn't just capable of change,

06:20.420 --> 06:23.460
 but was designed to change.

06:23.460 --> 06:24.980
 When we enter the world,

06:26.420 --> 06:30.620
 our nervous system is primed for learning.

06:30.620 --> 06:33.740
 The brain and nervous system of a baby

06:33.740 --> 06:36.100
 is wired very crudely.

06:36.100 --> 06:38.380
 The connections are not precise,

06:38.380 --> 06:40.180
 and we can see evidence of that

06:40.180 --> 06:42.980
 in the fact that babies are kind of flopping there

06:42.980 --> 06:45.180
 like a kind of a little potato bug with limbs.

06:45.180 --> 06:48.180
 They can't really do much in terms of coordinated movement.

06:48.180 --> 06:50.240
 They certainly can't speak,

06:50.240 --> 06:53.500
 and they can't really do anything with precision.

06:53.500 --> 06:57.940
 And that's because we come into this world over-connected.

06:57.940 --> 06:59.380
 We have essentially wires.

06:59.380 --> 07:01.740
 Those wires have names like axons and dendrites.

07:01.740 --> 07:03.300
 Those are the different parts of the neurons

07:03.300 --> 07:04.800
 discussed in episode one.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.520
 But those little parts and those wires and connections

07:07.520 --> 07:09.060
 are everywhere.

07:09.060 --> 07:11.020
 Imagine a bunch of roads

07:11.020 --> 07:14.100
 that are all connected to one another in kind of a mess,

07:14.100 --> 07:15.860
 but there are no highways.

07:15.860 --> 07:17.060
 They're all just small roads.

07:17.060 --> 07:19.740
 That's essentially what the young nervous system is like.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.660
 And then as we mature,

07:21.660 --> 07:24.540
 as we go from day one of life

07:24.540 --> 07:28.880
 to 10 years old, 20 years old, 30 years old,

07:28.880 --> 07:32.300
 what happens is particular connections get reinforced

07:32.300 --> 07:35.500
 and stronger and other connections are lost.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.000
 So that's the first important principle that I want everyone

07:38.000 --> 07:41.960
 to understand, which is that developmental plasticity,

07:41.960 --> 07:44.780
 the neuroplasticity that occurs from the time we're born

07:44.780 --> 07:49.000
 until about age 25 is mainly a process

07:49.000 --> 07:53.320
 of removing connections that don't serve our goals well.

07:53.320 --> 07:55.140
 Now, of course, certain events happen

07:55.140 --> 07:58.380
 during that birth to 25 period

07:58.380 --> 08:01.420
 in which positive events and negative events

08:01.420 --> 08:03.820
 are really stamped down into our nervous system

08:03.820 --> 08:05.480
 in a very dramatic fashion

08:05.480 --> 08:07.420
 by what we call one trial learning.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.840
 We experienced something once

08:08.840 --> 08:11.380
 and then our nervous system is forever changed

08:12.260 --> 08:13.460
 by that experience.

08:13.460 --> 08:15.500
 Unless of course we go through some work

08:15.500 --> 08:17.280
 to undo that experience.

08:17.280 --> 08:20.500
 So I want you to imagine in your mind

08:20.500 --> 08:22.500
 that when you were brought into this world,

08:22.500 --> 08:27.500
 you were essentially a widely connected web of connections

08:27.500 --> 08:31.460
 that was really poor at doing any one thing.

08:31.460 --> 08:33.020
 And that through your experience,

08:33.020 --> 08:36.220
 what you were exposed to by your parents or other caretakers

08:36.220 --> 08:39.220
 through your social interactions, through your thoughts,

08:39.220 --> 08:40.940
 through the languages that you learn,

08:40.940 --> 08:43.160
 through the places you traveled or didn't travel,

08:43.160 --> 08:45.460
 your nervous system became customized

08:45.460 --> 08:47.900
 to your unique experience.

08:47.900 --> 08:51.500
 Now, that's true for certain parts of your brain

08:51.500 --> 08:53.880
 that are involved in what we call representations

08:53.880 --> 08:55.280
 of the outside world.

08:55.280 --> 08:58.140
 A lot of your brain is designed to represent the visual world

08:58.140 --> 09:00.560
 or represent the auditory world

09:00.560 --> 09:03.300
 or represent the gallery of smells

09:03.300 --> 09:05.980
 that are possible in the world.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.460
 However, there are aspects of your nervous system

09:08.460 --> 09:11.580
 that were designed not to be plastic.

09:11.580 --> 09:13.540
 They were wired so that plasticity

09:13.540 --> 09:17.160
 or changes in those circuits is very unlikely.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.220
 Those circuits include things like

09:19.220 --> 09:21.140
 the ones that control your heartbeat,

09:21.140 --> 09:22.980
 the ones that control your breathing,

09:22.980 --> 09:24.740
 the ones that control your digestion.

09:24.740 --> 09:27.640
 And thank goodness that those circuits were set up that way

09:27.640 --> 09:30.460
 because you want those circuits to be extremely reliable.

09:30.460 --> 09:31.940
 You never want to have to think about

09:31.940 --> 09:33.300
 whether or not your heart will beat

09:33.300 --> 09:34.940
 or whether or not you will continue breathing

09:34.940 --> 09:37.700
 or whether or not you'll be able to digest your food.

09:37.700 --> 09:41.740
 So many nervous system features like digestion

09:41.740 --> 09:44.620
 and breathing and heart rate are hard to change.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.040
 Other aspects of our nervous system

09:47.040 --> 09:48.740
 are actually quite easy to change.

09:48.740 --> 09:50.700
 And one of the great gifts of childhood,

09:50.700 --> 09:52.560
 adolescence and young adulthood,

09:52.560 --> 09:54.980
 is that we can learn through almost passive experience.

09:54.980 --> 09:56.740
 We don't have to focus that hard

09:56.740 --> 09:58.380
 in order to learn new things.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.840
 In fact, children go from being able

10:00.840 --> 10:03.220
 to speak no language whatsoever,

10:03.220 --> 10:05.380
 to being able to speak many, many words

10:05.380 --> 10:06.660
 and comprise sentences,

10:06.660 --> 10:08.700
 including words they've never heard before,

10:08.700 --> 10:09.700
 which is remarkable.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.580
 It means that the portions of the brain

10:11.580 --> 10:13.180
 involved in speech and language

10:13.180 --> 10:16.580
 are actually primed to learn and create new combinations.

10:17.920 --> 10:20.840
 What this tells us is that the young brain

10:20.840 --> 10:23.160
 is a plasticity machine.

10:24.020 --> 10:26.100
 But then right about age 25,

10:26.100 --> 10:29.240
 plus or minus a year or two, everything changes.

10:29.240 --> 10:32.320
 After age 25 or so,

10:32.320 --> 10:34.780
 in order to get changes in our nervous system,

10:34.780 --> 10:38.520
 we have to engage in a completely different set of processes

10:38.520 --> 10:40.420
 in order to get those changes to occur

10:40.420 --> 10:43.700
 and for them, more importantly, to stick around.

10:43.700 --> 10:46.140
 And this is something that I think is vastly overlooked

10:46.140 --> 10:49.540
 in the popular culture discussion about neuroplasticity.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.680
 People always talk about fire together, wire together.

10:52.680 --> 10:55.340
 Fire together, wire together is true.

10:55.340 --> 10:57.300
 It is the statement of my colleague at Stanford,

10:57.300 --> 11:00.780
 Carla Schatz, and it's an absolute truth

11:00.780 --> 11:02.860
 about the way that the nervous system wires up

11:02.860 --> 11:04.520
 early in development.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.340
 But fire together, wire together

11:07.340 --> 11:11.340
 doesn't apply in the same way after age 25.

11:11.340 --> 11:13.500
 And so we have these little memes

11:13.500 --> 11:17.140
 and these little quotes that circulate on the internet

11:17.140 --> 11:18.780
 like fire together, wire together,

11:18.780 --> 11:19.980
 or there's a famous quote

11:19.980 --> 11:24.020
 from the greatest neurobiologist of all time, Ramon y Cajal.

11:24.020 --> 11:25.380
 I think it goes something like, you know,

11:25.380 --> 11:27.680
 should somebody wish to change their nervous system,

11:27.680 --> 11:31.100
 they could be the sculptor of their nervous system

11:31.100 --> 11:33.280
 in any way they want, something like that.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.260
 And that sounds great.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.220
 I mean, who wouldn't want to change their nervous system

11:36.220 --> 11:37.320
 any way they want?

11:37.320 --> 11:39.780
 But what's lost in those statements

11:39.780 --> 11:41.940
 is how to actually accomplish that.

11:41.940 --> 11:43.660
 And we're going to cover that today.

11:43.660 --> 11:46.260
 But please understand that early in development,

11:46.260 --> 11:49.340
 your nervous system is connected very broadly

11:49.340 --> 11:52.080
 in ways that make it very hard to do anything well.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.920
 From birth until about age 25,

11:53.920 --> 11:57.340
 those connections get refined mainly through the removal

11:57.340 --> 11:59.260
 of connections that don't serve us

11:59.260 --> 12:02.020
 and the incredible strengthening of connections

12:02.020 --> 12:04.020
 that relate to either powerful experiences

12:04.020 --> 12:06.220
 or that allow us to do things like walk and talk

12:06.220 --> 12:08.480
 and do math, et cetera.

12:08.480 --> 12:11.700
 And then after age 25, if we want to change

12:11.700 --> 12:14.620
 those connections, those super highways of connectivity,

12:14.620 --> 12:17.660
 we have to engage in some very specific processes

12:17.660 --> 12:21.140
 and those processes as we'll soon learn are gated,

12:21.140 --> 12:23.280
 meaning you can't just decide to change your brain.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.300
 You actually have to go through a series of steps

12:25.300 --> 12:27.940
 to change your internal state in ways

12:27.940 --> 12:30.260
 that will allow you to change your brain.

12:30.260 --> 12:33.020
 I just want to acknowledge that Costello is snoring

12:33.020 --> 12:34.460
 particularly loud today.

12:34.460 --> 12:38.740
 Some of you seem very keen at picking up on his snoring.

12:38.740 --> 12:40.980
 Others of you can't hear his snoring.

12:40.980 --> 12:43.980
 It's very low rumbling sound.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.660
 And whether or not you can or you can't

12:45.660 --> 12:47.740
 probably relates to the sensitivity of your hearing.

12:47.740 --> 12:49.940
 We're actually going to talk about perfect pitch today

12:49.940 --> 12:52.220
 and range of auditory detection.

12:52.220 --> 12:54.740
 And so if you can hear Costello's snoring,

12:54.740 --> 12:57.180
 enjoy, if you can't, enjoy.

12:58.780 --> 13:01.820
 I want to talk about how the nervous system changes.

13:01.820 --> 13:04.100
 What are these changes?

13:04.100 --> 13:07.780
 Many of us have been captivated by the stories

13:07.780 --> 13:10.620
 in the popular press about the addition of new neurons.

13:10.620 --> 13:13.020
 This idea, oh, if you go running or you exercise,

13:13.020 --> 13:15.420
 your brain actually makes new neurons.

13:15.420 --> 13:17.280
 Well, I'm going to give you the bad news first,

13:17.280 --> 13:22.040
 which is that after puberty, so after about age 14 or 15,

13:22.040 --> 13:25.460
 the human brain and nervous system adds very few,

13:25.460 --> 13:27.980
 if any, new neurons.

13:27.980 --> 13:31.220
 The idea that new neurons could be added to the brain

13:31.220 --> 13:34.480
 is one that has a rich history in experimental science.

13:34.480 --> 13:39.380
 It's clear that in rodents and in some non-human primates,

13:39.380 --> 13:43.820
 new neurons, a process called neurogenesis,

13:43.820 --> 13:46.100
 can occur in areas of the brain,

13:46.100 --> 13:47.960
 such as the olfactory bulb,

13:47.960 --> 13:49.960
 which is of course involved in smell,

13:49.960 --> 13:51.860
 as well as a region of our hippocampus,

13:51.860 --> 13:53.220
 the center of the brain involved in memory

13:53.220 --> 13:56.020
 called the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.

13:56.020 --> 13:58.620
 And there is strong evidence that new neurons

13:58.620 --> 14:01.960
 can be added to those structures throughout the lifespan.

14:01.960 --> 14:05.380
 In humans, the evidence is a little bit more controversial.

14:05.380 --> 14:07.460
 It's clear that we can add new neurons

14:07.460 --> 14:09.300
 to our olfactory bulb.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.660
 In fact, if any of you have ever had the unfortunate

14:12.660 --> 14:15.420
 experience of being hit on the head too hard,

14:15.420 --> 14:19.120
 the wires called axons from those olfactory neurons

14:19.120 --> 14:21.540
 that live in your nose can get sheared off

14:21.540 --> 14:23.180
 because they have to pass through a bony plate

14:23.180 --> 14:24.200
 called the cribriform plate.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.580
 And the cribriform plate can shear those axons

14:26.580 --> 14:29.100
 and people can become what's called anosmic.

14:29.100 --> 14:30.920
 They won't be able to smell.

14:30.920 --> 14:33.460
 But over time, those neurons,

14:33.460 --> 14:35.980
 unlike most all central nervous system neurons,

14:35.980 --> 14:38.400
 can grow those connections back

14:38.400 --> 14:41.820
 and even reestablish new neurons

14:41.820 --> 14:43.260
 added to the olfactory bulb.

14:43.260 --> 14:44.960
 They come from elsewhere deep in the brain

14:44.960 --> 14:46.300
 and they migrate through a pathway

14:46.300 --> 14:47.880
 called the rostral migratory stream.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.040
 You can Google these words

14:49.040 --> 14:51.040
 and look up some of the descriptions of this

14:51.040 --> 14:52.480
 if you'd like to learn more.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.640
 So indeed, there's some evidence

14:54.640 --> 14:56.760
 that the neurons responsible for smell

14:56.760 --> 14:58.660
 can be replaced throughout the lifespan,

14:58.660 --> 15:00.820
 certainly in very young individuals

15:00.820 --> 15:03.220
 from birth till about age 15 or so.

15:04.420 --> 15:05.920
 Whether or not there are new neurons

15:05.920 --> 15:07.140
 added to the hippocampus,

15:07.140 --> 15:09.700
 the memory center of the human brain, isn't clear.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.980
 Many years ago, Rusty Gage's lab at the Salk Institute

15:12.980 --> 15:14.500
 did a really important study

15:14.500 --> 15:17.340
 looking at terminally ill cancer patients

15:17.340 --> 15:20.900
 and injecting them with a label, a dye,

15:20.900 --> 15:23.980
 that is incorporated only into new neurons.

15:23.980 --> 15:25.900
 And after these patients died,

15:25.900 --> 15:27.460
 their brains were harvested,

15:27.460 --> 15:28.580
 the brains were looked at,

15:28.580 --> 15:31.220
 and there were new neurons there.

15:31.220 --> 15:33.500
 There was evidence for new neurons.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.520
 Those results, I think, stand over time.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.480
 But what was not really discussed

15:39.480 --> 15:42.220
 in the popular press discussion around those papers

15:42.220 --> 15:45.700
 was that it was very few cells that were being added.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.740
 And a number of papers have come along over the years,

15:48.740 --> 15:50.500
 mainly from labs at UCSF,

15:50.500 --> 15:52.460
 although from others as well,

15:52.460 --> 15:54.540
 showing that if there are new neurons

15:54.540 --> 15:56.380
 added to the adult brain,

15:56.380 --> 16:00.700
 it's an infinitesimally small number of new neurons.

16:00.700 --> 16:01.700
 So that's the depressing part.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.860
 We don't get new neurons.

16:02.860 --> 16:05.140
 After we're born, we pretty much have the neurons

16:05.140 --> 16:06.400
 that we're going to use our entire life.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.860
 And yes, as we get older

16:07.860 --> 16:10.440
 and we start to lose certain functions in our brain,

16:10.440 --> 16:11.980
 we lose neurons.

16:11.980 --> 16:15.360
 But all is not lost, so to speak,

16:15.360 --> 16:18.860
 because there are other ways in which neural circuits

16:18.860 --> 16:21.880
 can create new connections and add new functions,

16:21.880 --> 16:24.180
 including new memory, new abilities,

16:24.180 --> 16:26.320
 and new cognitive functions.

16:27.180 --> 16:29.580
 And those are mainly through the process

16:29.580 --> 16:31.700
 of making certain connections,

16:31.700 --> 16:34.500
 which of course are those things we call synapses

16:34.500 --> 16:37.300
 between neurons, making those connections stronger

16:37.300 --> 16:40.580
 so they're more reliable, they're more likely to engage,

16:40.580 --> 16:42.880
 as well as removing connections.

16:42.880 --> 16:44.980
 And the removal of connections is vital

16:44.980 --> 16:47.620
 to say, moving through a grieving process

16:47.620 --> 16:52.180
 or removing the emotional load of a traumatic experience.

16:52.180 --> 16:54.340
 So even though we can't add new neurons

16:54.340 --> 16:56.040
 throughout our lifespan,

16:56.040 --> 16:59.160
 at least not in very great numbers,

16:59.160 --> 17:01.580
 it's clear that we can change our nervous system,

17:01.580 --> 17:04.580
 that the nervous system is available for change,

17:04.580 --> 17:07.280
 that if we create the right set of circumstances

17:07.280 --> 17:09.800
 in our brain, chemical circumstances,

17:09.800 --> 17:12.860
 and if we create the right environmental circumstances

17:12.860 --> 17:15.940
 around us, our nervous system will shift into a mode

17:15.940 --> 17:20.100
 in which change isn't just possible, but it's probable.

17:20.100 --> 17:21.740
 As I mentioned before,

17:21.740 --> 17:25.080
 the hallmark of the child nervous system is change.

17:25.080 --> 17:26.860
 It wants to change.

17:26.860 --> 17:29.160
 The whole thing, everything from the chemicals

17:29.160 --> 17:31.620
 that are sloshing around in there

17:31.620 --> 17:34.500
 to the fact that there's a lot of space between the neurons,

17:34.500 --> 17:35.320
 a lot of people don't know this,

17:35.320 --> 17:36.160
 but early in development,

17:36.160 --> 17:37.500
 there's a lot of space between the neurons,

17:37.500 --> 17:39.260
 and so the neurons can literally move around

17:39.260 --> 17:41.300
 and sample different connections very easily,

17:41.300 --> 17:43.140
 removing some and keeping others.

17:43.140 --> 17:46.520
 As we get older, the so-called extracellular space

17:46.520 --> 17:50.700
 is actually filled up by things called extracellular matrix

17:50.700 --> 17:52.740
 and glial cells, glia means glue.

17:52.740 --> 17:55.000
 Those cells are involved in a bunch of different processes,

17:55.000 --> 17:57.140
 but they start to fill in all the space,

17:57.140 --> 17:59.620
 kind of like pouring concrete between rocks,

17:59.620 --> 18:00.980
 and when that happens,

18:00.980 --> 18:03.700
 it becomes much harder to change the connections

18:03.700 --> 18:05.080
 that are there.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.540
 One of the ways in which we can all get plasticity

18:08.540 --> 18:10.820
 at any stage throughout the lifespan

18:10.820 --> 18:12.780
 is through deficits and impairments

18:12.780 --> 18:14.980
 in what we call our sensory apparatus,

18:14.980 --> 18:17.500
 our eyes, our ears, our nose, our mouth,

18:17.500 --> 18:19.120
 and there are some very dramatic

18:19.120 --> 18:22.300
 and somewhat tragic examples of people, for instance,

18:22.300 --> 18:24.380
 who have genetic mutations where they are born

18:24.380 --> 18:27.740
 without a nose and without any olfactory structures

18:27.740 --> 18:30.300
 in the brain, so they cannot smell.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.900
 In that case, areas of the brain

18:31.900 --> 18:33.960
 that normally would represent smell

18:33.960 --> 18:37.260
 become overtaken by areas of the brain

18:37.260 --> 18:41.200
 involved in other things like touch and hearing and sight.

18:41.200 --> 18:43.600
 In individuals that are blind from birth,

18:43.600 --> 18:45.360
 the so-called occipital cortex,

18:45.360 --> 18:47.140
 the visual cortex in the back,

18:47.140 --> 18:50.960
 becomes overtaken by hearing.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.640
 The neurons there will start to respond to sounds

18:53.640 --> 18:54.980
 as well as braille touch,

18:54.980 --> 18:57.880
 and actually there's one particularly tragic incident

18:57.880 --> 19:01.120
 where a woman who was blind since birth,

19:01.120 --> 19:03.660
 and because of neuroimaging studies,

19:03.660 --> 19:06.500
 we knew her visual cortex was no longer visual.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.840
 It was responsible for braille reading and for hearing.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.860
 She had a stroke that actually took out

19:11.860 --> 19:14.140
 most of the function of her visual cortex,

19:14.140 --> 19:17.180
 so then she was blind, she couldn't braille read or hear.

19:17.180 --> 19:19.620
 She did recover some aspect of function.

19:19.620 --> 19:20.860
 Now, most people, they don't end up

19:20.860 --> 19:22.940
 in that highly unfortunate situation,

19:22.940 --> 19:25.260
 and what we know is that, for instance,

19:25.260 --> 19:28.760
 blind people who use their visual cortex

19:28.760 --> 19:30.840
 for braille reading and for hearing

19:30.840 --> 19:35.340
 have much better auditory acuity and touch acuity,

19:35.340 --> 19:37.340
 meaning they can sense things with their fingers

19:37.340 --> 19:39.140
 and they can sense things with their hearing

19:39.140 --> 19:42.380
 that typical sighted folks wouldn't be able to.

19:42.380 --> 19:46.180
 In fact, you will find a much greater incidence

19:46.180 --> 19:50.300
 of perfect pitch in people that are blind,

19:50.300 --> 19:52.380
 and that tells us that the brain,

19:52.380 --> 19:54.560
 and in particular this area we call the neocortex,

19:54.560 --> 19:55.900
 which is the outer part,

19:55.900 --> 19:57.780
 is really designed to be a map

19:57.780 --> 20:00.020
 of our own individual experience.

20:00.020 --> 20:04.100
 So these, what I call experiments of impairment or loss

20:04.100 --> 20:06.920
 where somebody is blind from birth or deaf from birth,

20:06.920 --> 20:11.920
 or maybe has a limb development impairment

20:12.200 --> 20:14.480
 where they have a stump instead of an entire limb

20:14.480 --> 20:16.360
 with a functioning hand,

20:16.360 --> 20:21.060
 their brain will represent the body plan that they have,

20:21.060 --> 20:23.060
 not some other body plan.

20:23.060 --> 20:26.020
 But the beauty of the situation is that the real estate

20:26.020 --> 20:28.980
 up in the skull, that neocortex,

20:28.980 --> 20:33.300
 the essence of it is to be a customized map of experience.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.340
 Now, it is true, however,

20:35.340 --> 20:40.220
 that if let's say I were to be blind when I'm 50,

20:40.220 --> 20:42.420
 I'm 45 right now, I've always been sighted.

20:43.380 --> 20:45.500
 If I was blind at 50,

20:45.500 --> 20:48.420
 I'll probably have less opportunity

20:48.420 --> 20:51.580
 to use my formerly visual cortex

20:51.580 --> 20:53.700
 for things like braille reading and hearing,

20:53.700 --> 20:55.120
 because my brain has changed.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.800
 It's just not the same brain I had when I was a baby.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.020
 So there's actually a principle of biology.

21:00.020 --> 21:01.140
 Not many people know this.

21:01.140 --> 21:03.140
 It's actually a principle of neurology,

21:03.140 --> 21:05.140
 which is called the Kennard principle,

21:05.140 --> 21:07.980
 which says if you're going to have a brain injury,

21:07.980 --> 21:10.000
 you wanna have it early in life.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.240
 And of course, better to not have a brain injury at all,

21:12.240 --> 21:13.320
 but if you're going to have it,

21:13.320 --> 21:14.860
 you wanna have it early in life.

21:14.860 --> 21:17.620
 And this is based on a tremendous number of experiments

21:17.620 --> 21:20.380
 examining the amount of recovery

21:20.380 --> 21:22.800
 and the rate of recovery in humans

21:22.800 --> 21:24.500
 that had lesions to their brain

21:24.500 --> 21:26.300
 either early in life or later in life.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.540
 So the Kennard principle says

21:27.540 --> 21:29.800
 better to have injuries early in life.

21:29.800 --> 21:32.060
 Now, that's reassuring for the young folks.

21:32.060 --> 21:34.400
 It's not so reassuring for the older folks.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.060
 But there are aspects of neuroplasticity

21:37.060 --> 21:38.860
 that have nothing to do with impairments.

21:38.860 --> 21:40.260
 I mean, earlier I said,

21:40.260 --> 21:42.580
 we're all walking around with this map,

21:42.580 --> 21:44.760
 this representation of the world around us

21:44.760 --> 21:47.600
 so we can see edges, we can see colors,

21:47.600 --> 21:50.680
 except for folks that are colorblind, of course.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.580
 And we also have a map of emotional experience.

21:53.580 --> 21:54.880
 We have a map of whether or not

21:54.880 --> 21:56.560
 certain people are trustworthy,

21:56.560 --> 21:57.620
 certain people aren't trustworthy.

21:57.620 --> 22:01.860
 A few years ago, I was at a course

22:01.860 --> 22:03.320
 and a woman came up to me and she said,

22:03.320 --> 22:07.120
 I wasn't teaching the course, I was in the course.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.460
 And she said, I just have to tell you

22:08.460 --> 22:11.780
 that every time you speak, it really stresses me out.

22:11.780 --> 22:13.980
 And I said, well, I've heard that before,

22:13.980 --> 22:16.140
 but do you want to be more specific?

22:16.140 --> 22:18.320
 And she said, yeah, your tone of voice reminds me

22:18.320 --> 22:21.780
 of somebody that I had a really terrible experience with.

22:21.780 --> 22:23.460
 I said, well, okay, well, I can't change my voice

22:23.460 --> 22:25.800
 but I really appreciate that you acknowledge that

22:25.800 --> 22:27.860
 and it also will help explain

22:27.860 --> 22:30.380
 why you seem to cringe every time I speak,

22:30.380 --> 22:31.600
 which I hadn't noticed until then.

22:31.600 --> 22:34.540
 But after that, I did notice she had a very immediate

22:34.540 --> 22:36.200
 and kind of visceral response to my speech.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.380
 Perhaps some of you are having that right now.

22:38.380 --> 22:42.480
 But in any event, over the period of this two-week course,

22:42.480 --> 22:44.560
 she would come back every once in a while and say,

22:44.560 --> 22:46.660
 you know what, I think just by telling you

22:46.660 --> 22:49.700
 that your voice was really difficult for me to listen to,

22:49.700 --> 22:51.660
 it's actually becoming more tolerable to me.

22:51.660 --> 22:53.560
 And by the end, we actually became pretty good friends

22:53.560 --> 22:54.700
 and we're still in touch.

22:54.700 --> 22:59.120
 And so what this says is that the recognition of something,

22:59.120 --> 23:00.720
 whether or not that's an emotional thing

23:00.720 --> 23:02.840
 or a desire to learn something else

23:02.840 --> 23:05.600
 is actually the first step in neuroplasticity.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.660
 And that's because our nervous system

23:07.660 --> 23:10.000
 has two broad sets of functions.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.400
 Some of those functions are reflexive.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.840
 Things like our breathing, our heart rate are obvious ones.

23:15.840 --> 23:19.400
 But other aspects are reflexive like our ability to walk.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.560
 If I get up out of this chair and walk out of the door,

23:21.560 --> 23:23.360
 I don't think about each step that I'm taking

23:23.360 --> 23:25.960
 and that's because I learned how to walk during development.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.120
 But when we decide that we're going to shift

23:28.120 --> 23:31.220
 some sort of behavior or some reaction

23:31.220 --> 23:34.620
 or some new piece of information that we want to learn

23:34.620 --> 23:37.140
 is something that we want to bring into our consciousness,

23:37.140 --> 23:40.120
 that awareness is a remarkable thing

23:40.120 --> 23:44.480
 because it cues the brain and the rest of the nervous system

23:44.480 --> 23:46.960
 that when we engage in those reflexive actions

23:46.960 --> 23:49.600
 going forward, that those reflexive actions

23:49.600 --> 23:53.000
 are no longer fated to be reflexive.

23:53.000 --> 23:54.360
 Now, if this sounds a little bit abstract,

23:54.360 --> 23:56.600
 we're going to talk about protocols for how to do this.

23:56.600 --> 23:59.000
 But the first step in neuroplasticity

23:59.000 --> 24:01.580
 is recognizing that you want to change something.

24:01.580 --> 24:03.040
 And you should immediately say,

24:03.040 --> 24:05.160
 well, kids don't go into school and say,

24:05.160 --> 24:06.620
 oh, I want to learn language

24:06.620 --> 24:08.320
 or I want to learn social interactions.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.840
 And that's the beauty of childhood.

24:09.840 --> 24:12.280
 The whole brain has this switch flipped

24:12.280 --> 24:14.040
 that is making change possible.

24:14.040 --> 24:16.620
 But after that, we have to be deliberate.

24:16.620 --> 24:20.720
 We have to know what it is exactly that we want to change.

24:20.720 --> 24:23.260
 Or if we don't know exactly what it is

24:23.260 --> 24:24.440
 that we want to change,

24:24.440 --> 24:26.760
 we at least have to know that we want to change something

24:26.760 --> 24:28.520
 about some specific experience.

24:28.520 --> 24:31.080
 In this case, I believe that she came and told me

24:31.080 --> 24:33.640
 that my voice was really awful for her to listen to,

24:33.640 --> 24:36.720
 not to make me feel bad or for any other reason,

24:36.720 --> 24:40.040
 except that she wanted it to not be the case.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.960
 And she knew I wasn't going to stop talking.

24:41.960 --> 24:43.720
 So she decided to call it

24:43.720 --> 24:45.940
 to her consciousness and mine as well.

24:45.940 --> 24:47.400
 So that's important.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.640
 If you want to learn something

24:48.640 --> 24:51.360
 or you want to change your nervous system in any way,

24:51.360 --> 24:53.460
 whether or not it's because of some impairment

24:53.460 --> 24:56.480
 or because of something that you want to acquire,

24:56.480 --> 25:00.480
 a cognitive skill, a motor skill, an emotional skill,

25:00.480 --> 25:03.760
 the first thing is recognizing what that thing is.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.480
 And that often can be the hardest thing to identify.

25:06.480 --> 25:09.420
 But the brain has these self-recognition mechanisms.

25:09.420 --> 25:11.640
 And those self-recognition mechanisms

25:11.640 --> 25:16.320
 are not vague, spiritual, or mystical,

25:16.320 --> 25:18.540
 or even psychological concepts.

25:18.540 --> 25:20.800
 They are neurochemicals.

25:20.800 --> 25:23.320
 We're going to talk next about the neurochemicals

25:23.320 --> 25:26.380
 that stamp down particular behaviors

25:26.380 --> 25:28.400
 and thoughts and emotional patterns

25:28.400 --> 25:30.500
 and tell the rest of the nervous system,

25:30.500 --> 25:32.760
 this is something to pay attention to

25:32.760 --> 25:35.080
 because this is in the direction

25:35.080 --> 25:36.860
 of the change that I want to make.

25:36.860 --> 25:37.700
 So I'll repeat that.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.560
 There are specific chemicals

25:39.560 --> 25:41.520
 that when we are consciously aware

25:41.520 --> 25:43.000
 of a change we want to make,

25:43.000 --> 25:45.880
 or even just that we want to make some change,

25:45.880 --> 25:48.080
 chemicals are released in the brain

25:48.080 --> 25:51.480
 that allow us the opportunity to make those changes.

25:51.480 --> 25:53.740
 Now there are specific protocols that science tells us

25:53.740 --> 25:56.800
 we have to follow if we want those changes to occur.

25:56.800 --> 26:01.800
 But that self-recognition is not a kind of murky concept.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.420
 What it is is it's our forebrain,

26:04.420 --> 26:06.320
 in particular our prefrontal cortex,

26:06.320 --> 26:09.480
 signaling the rest of our nervous system

26:09.480 --> 26:11.800
 that something that we're about to do here,

26:11.800 --> 26:15.320
 feel, or experience is worth paying attention to.

26:15.320 --> 26:17.540
 So we'll pause there and then I'm going to move forward.

26:17.540 --> 26:20.060
 One of the biggest lies in the universe

26:20.060 --> 26:22.240
 that seems quite prominent right now

26:22.240 --> 26:26.120
 is that every experience you have changes your brain.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.300
 People love to say this.

26:27.300 --> 26:28.280
 They love to say,

26:28.280 --> 26:30.400
 your brain is going to be different after this lecture

26:30.400 --> 26:31.620
 or that your brain is going to be different

26:31.620 --> 26:33.840
 after today's class than it was two days ago.

26:33.840 --> 26:36.200
 And that's absolutely not true.

26:36.200 --> 26:38.440
 The nervous system doesn't just change

26:38.440 --> 26:39.640
 because you experienced something

26:39.640 --> 26:42.140
 unless you're a very young child.

26:43.260 --> 26:44.880
 The nervous system changes

26:44.880 --> 26:47.880
 when certain neurochemicals are released

26:47.880 --> 26:50.600
 and allow whatever neurons are active

26:50.600 --> 26:54.000
 in the period in which those chemicals are swimming around

26:54.880 --> 26:59.160
 to strengthen or weaken the connections of those neurons.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.940
 Now, this is best illustrated

27:00.940 --> 27:03.720
 through a little bit of scientific history.

27:03.720 --> 27:06.240
 The whole basis of neuroplasticity

27:06.240 --> 27:08.720
 is essentially ascribed to two individuals,

27:08.720 --> 27:09.920
 although there were a lot more people

27:09.920 --> 27:11.000
 that were involved in this work.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.880
 Those two individuals go by the name

27:12.880 --> 27:15.940
 David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel.

27:15.940 --> 27:18.800
 David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel started off at Johns Hopkins,

27:18.800 --> 27:20.800
 moved to Harvard Medical School.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.320
 And in the 70s and 80s,

27:22.320 --> 27:24.160
 they did a series of experiments

27:24.160 --> 27:27.800
 recording electrical activity in the brain.

27:28.960 --> 27:30.840
 They were in the visual cortex,

27:30.840 --> 27:33.880
 meaning they put the electrodes in the visual cortex,

27:33.880 --> 27:35.880
 and they were exploring how vision works

27:35.880 --> 27:37.960
 and how the visual brain organizes

27:37.960 --> 27:39.160
 all the features of the visual world

27:39.160 --> 27:40.720
 to give us these incredible things

27:40.720 --> 27:42.520
 we call visual perceptions.

27:42.520 --> 27:46.600
 But Hubel was a physician,

27:46.600 --> 27:50.040
 and he was very interested in what happens

27:50.040 --> 27:52.120
 when, for instance, a child comes into the world

27:52.120 --> 27:53.640
 and they have a cataract.

27:53.640 --> 27:56.980
 The lens of their eye isn't clear, but it's opaque.

27:56.980 --> 27:59.400
 Or when a kid has a lazy eye

27:59.400 --> 28:01.240
 or the eyes have what's called strabismus,

28:01.240 --> 28:04.240
 which is when the eyes either deviate outward or inward.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.200
 These are very common things of childhood,

28:07.200 --> 28:09.640
 especially in particular areas of the world.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.740
 And what David and Torsten did

28:11.740 --> 28:16.040
 is they figured out that there was a critical period

28:16.040 --> 28:20.080
 in which if clear vision did not occur,

28:20.080 --> 28:24.520
 the visual brain would completely rewire itself

28:24.520 --> 28:25.800
 basically to represent

28:25.800 --> 28:28.840
 whatever bit of visual information was coming in.

28:28.840 --> 28:30.560
 So they did these experiments

28:30.560 --> 28:34.360
 that kind of simulate a droopy eye or a deviating eye

28:34.360 --> 28:35.680
 where they would close one eyelid.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.700
 And then what they found is that the visual brain

28:37.700 --> 28:39.760
 would respond entirely to the open eye.

28:39.760 --> 28:42.100
 It was sort of a takeover of the visual brain

28:42.100 --> 28:44.180
 representing the open eye.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.240
 Many experiments in many different sensory systems

28:48.240 --> 28:49.560
 followed up on this.

28:49.560 --> 28:51.600
 There are beautiful experiments, for instance,

28:51.600 --> 28:54.520
 from Greg Reckenzone's lab up at UC Davis

28:54.520 --> 28:57.040
 and Mike Merzenich's labs at UCSF

28:57.040 --> 28:58.440
 showing that, for instance,

28:58.440 --> 29:01.840
 if two fingers were taped together early in development,

29:01.840 --> 29:03.560
 so they weren't moving independently,

29:03.560 --> 29:05.180
 the representation of those two fingers

29:05.180 --> 29:06.680
 would become fused in the brain

29:06.680 --> 29:09.660
 so that the person couldn't actually distinguish

29:09.660 --> 29:11.000
 the movements and the sensations

29:11.000 --> 29:12.280
 of the two fingers separately.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.200
 Pretty remarkable.

29:14.200 --> 29:18.540
 All of this is to say that David and Torsten's work,

29:18.540 --> 29:20.440
 for which they won a Nobel Prize,

29:20.440 --> 29:22.080
 they shared it with Roger Sperry,

29:23.160 --> 29:26.560
 their work showed that the brain is in fact

29:26.560 --> 29:28.440
 a customized map of the outside world.

29:28.440 --> 29:29.780
 We said that already.

29:29.780 --> 29:32.240
 But that what it's doing is it's measuring

29:32.240 --> 29:35.800
 the amount of activity for a given part of our body,

29:35.800 --> 29:37.200
 one eye or the other,

29:37.200 --> 29:39.240
 or our fingers, this finger or that finger,

29:39.240 --> 29:41.800
 and all of those inputs are competing

29:41.800 --> 29:43.880
 for space in the brain.

29:43.880 --> 29:45.800
 Now, this is fundamentally important

29:45.800 --> 29:47.660
 because what it means is that

29:47.660 --> 29:51.040
 if we are to change our nervous system in adulthood,

29:51.040 --> 29:54.780
 we need to think about not just what we're trying to get,

29:54.780 --> 29:56.080
 but what we're trying to give up.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.280
 We can't actually add new connections

29:58.280 --> 30:00.600
 without removing something else.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.100
 And that might seem like kind of a stinger,

30:02.100 --> 30:04.600
 but it actually turns out to be a great advantage.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.980
 One of the key experiments that David and Torsten did

30:08.980 --> 30:11.720
 was an experiment where they closed both eyes,

30:11.720 --> 30:14.840
 where they essentially removed all visual input

30:14.840 --> 30:16.080
 early in development.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.640
 Now, this is slightly different than blindness

30:17.640 --> 30:18.780
 because it was transient,

30:18.780 --> 30:20.560
 it was only for a short period of time.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.480
 But what they found is when they did that,

30:22.480 --> 30:23.760
 there was no change.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.240
 However, if they closed just one eye,

30:26.240 --> 30:28.020
 there was a huge change.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.440
 So when people tell you,

30:29.440 --> 30:31.240
 oh, at the end of today's lecture,

30:31.240 --> 30:32.580
 or at the end of something,

30:32.580 --> 30:34.720
 your brain is going to be completely different,

30:34.720 --> 30:35.760
 that's simply not true.

30:35.760 --> 30:37.120
 If you're older than 25,

30:37.120 --> 30:39.000
 your brain will not change

30:39.000 --> 30:42.580
 unless there's a selective shift in your attention

30:42.580 --> 30:45.320
 or a selective shift in your experience

30:45.320 --> 30:49.080
 that tells the brain it's time to change.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.840
 And those changes occur through the ways I talked about

30:51.840 --> 30:54.420
 before strengthening and weakening of particular connections.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.180
 They have names like long-term potentiation,

30:56.180 --> 30:57.040
 long-term depression,

30:57.040 --> 30:58.720
 which has nothing to do with emotional depression,

30:58.720 --> 31:00.960
 by the way, spike timing dependent plasticity.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.380
 I threw out those names not to confuse you,

31:03.380 --> 31:05.040
 but for those of you that would like

31:05.040 --> 31:07.320
 more in-depth exploration of those,

31:07.320 --> 31:09.640
 please, you can go Google those and look them up.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.160
 There are great Wikipedia pages for them

31:11.160 --> 31:12.520
 and you can go down the paper trail.

31:12.520 --> 31:15.200
 I might even touch on them in some subsequent episodes.

31:15.200 --> 31:17.280
 But the important thing to understand

31:17.280 --> 31:19.600
 is that if we want something to change,

31:19.600 --> 31:22.920
 we really need to bring an immense amount of attention

31:22.920 --> 31:25.080
 to whatever it is that we want to change.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.560
 This is very much linked to the statement I made earlier

31:27.560 --> 31:30.600
 about it all starts with an awareness.

31:30.600 --> 31:33.120
 Now, why is that attention important?

31:33.120 --> 31:36.320
 Well, David and Torrenston won their Nobel Prize

31:36.320 --> 31:37.200
 and they certainly deserved it.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.080
 They probably deserve two

31:38.080 --> 31:39.700
 because they also figured out how vision works.

31:39.700 --> 31:40.880
 And I might be biased

31:40.880 --> 31:42.400
 because they're my scientific great-grandparents,

31:42.400 --> 31:45.360
 but I think everybody in the field of neuroscience agrees

31:45.360 --> 31:49.240
 that Hubel and Wiesel, as they're called,

31:49.240 --> 31:51.640
 H and W for those in the game,

31:51.640 --> 31:54.160
 absolutely deserved a Nobel Prize for their work

31:54.160 --> 31:56.680
 because they really unveiled the mechanisms

31:56.680 --> 31:59.060
 of brain change, of plasticity.

31:59.060 --> 32:00.440
 David passed away a few years ago.

32:00.440 --> 32:01.360
 Torrenston's still alive.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.560
 He's in his late 90s.

32:02.560 --> 32:04.160
 He's still at the Rockefeller University.

32:04.160 --> 32:05.320
 He's sharp as a tack.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.440
 He still jogs several miles a day.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.840
 He's really into art and a number of other things.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.080
 He's also a super nice guy.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.520
 Hubel was a really nice guy as well.

32:12.520 --> 32:14.720
 It's also, he was a great Frisbee player, I discovered,

32:14.720 --> 32:16.100
 because he beat me in a game of ultimate

32:16.100 --> 32:17.740
 when he was like 80,

32:17.740 --> 32:20.080
 which still has me a little bit irked.

32:20.080 --> 32:24.160
 But anyway, Hubel and Wiesel did an amazing thing

32:24.160 --> 32:26.620
 for science that will forever change the way

32:26.620 --> 32:28.300
 that we think about the brain.

32:28.300 --> 32:30.680
 However, they were quite wrong

32:30.680 --> 32:32.720
 about this critical period thing.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.960
 The critical period was this idea

32:34.960 --> 32:38.400
 that if you were to deprive the nervous system of an input,

32:38.400 --> 32:41.320
 say closing one eye early in development

32:41.320 --> 32:43.720
 and the rest of the visual cortex is taken over

32:43.720 --> 32:45.760
 by the representation of the open eye,

32:45.760 --> 32:47.920
 that you could never change that

32:47.920 --> 32:49.960
 unless you intervened early.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.280
 And this actually formed the basis

32:51.280 --> 32:55.160
 for why a kid that has a lazy eye or a cataract,

32:55.160 --> 32:56.860
 why even though there are some issues

32:56.860 --> 32:59.080
 with anesthesia in young children,

32:59.080 --> 33:01.720
 why now we know that you want to get in there early

33:01.720 --> 33:05.400
 and fix the cataract or fix the strabismus,

33:05.400 --> 33:07.640
 that's what ophthalmologists do.

33:07.640 --> 33:10.980
 However, their idea that you had to do it early

33:10.980 --> 33:12.720
 or else there was no opportunity

33:12.720 --> 33:16.600
 to rescue the nervous system deficit later on,

33:16.600 --> 33:19.120
 turned out, wasn't entirely true.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.700
 In the early 90s, a graduate student

33:22.700 --> 33:25.080
 by the name of Greg Reconzone was in the laboratory

33:25.080 --> 33:27.920
 of a guy named Mike Merzenich at UCSF.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.560
 And they set out to test this idea

33:30.560 --> 33:33.140
 that if one wants to change their brain,

33:33.140 --> 33:34.680
 they need to do it early in life

33:34.680 --> 33:37.100
 because the adult brain simply isn't plastic,

33:37.100 --> 33:39.720
 it's not available for these changes.

33:39.720 --> 33:43.280
 And they did a series of absolutely beautiful experiments.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.780
 By now, I think we can say proving

33:46.780 --> 33:49.280
 that the adult brain can change

33:49.280 --> 33:51.840
 provided certain conditions are met.

33:51.840 --> 33:55.200
 Now, the experiments they did are tough.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.480
 They were tough on the experimenter

33:56.480 --> 33:57.920
 and they were tough on the subject.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.200
 I'll just describe one.

34:00.060 --> 34:01.940
 Let's say you were a subject in one of their experiments.

34:01.940 --> 34:05.060
 You would come into the lab and you'd sit down at a table

34:05.060 --> 34:09.440
 and they would record from or image your brain

34:09.440 --> 34:11.600
 and look at the representation of your fingers,

34:11.600 --> 34:13.720
 the digits as we call them.

34:13.720 --> 34:15.400
 And there would be a spinning drum,

34:15.400 --> 34:19.360
 literally like a stone drum in front of you

34:19.360 --> 34:21.480
 or metal drum that had little bumps.

34:21.480 --> 34:23.480
 Some of the bumps were spaced close together,

34:23.480 --> 34:25.440
 some of them were spaced far apart.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.100
 And they would do these experiments

34:27.100 --> 34:29.280
 where they would expect their subjects

34:29.280 --> 34:32.560
 to press a lever whenever, for instance,

34:32.560 --> 34:35.080
 the bumps got closer together or further apart.

34:35.080 --> 34:36.880
 And these were very subtle differences.

34:36.880 --> 34:39.740
 So in order to do this, you really have to pay attention

34:39.740 --> 34:41.680
 to the distance between the bumps.

34:41.680 --> 34:44.700
 And these were not braille readers or anyone skilled

34:44.700 --> 34:47.180
 in doing these kinds of experiments.

34:47.180 --> 34:49.180
 What they found was that as people paid

34:49.180 --> 34:52.840
 more and more attention to the distance between these bumps

34:52.840 --> 34:54.320
 and they would signal when there was a change

34:54.320 --> 34:56.240
 by pressing a lever.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.920
 As they did that, there was very rapid changes,

34:58.920 --> 35:02.200
 plasticity in the representation of the fingers.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.780
 And it could go in either direction.

35:03.780 --> 35:06.380
 You could get people very good at detecting the distance

35:06.380 --> 35:09.360
 between bumps that the distance was getting smaller

35:09.360 --> 35:11.720
 or the distance was getting greater.

35:11.720 --> 35:13.560
 So people could get very good at these tasks

35:13.560 --> 35:15.120
 that they're kind of hard to imagine

35:15.120 --> 35:16.600
 how they would translate to the real world

35:16.600 --> 35:17.840
 for a non braille reader.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.220
 But what it told us is that these maps of touch

35:21.220 --> 35:23.660
 were very much available for plasticity.

35:23.660 --> 35:26.120
 And these were fully adult subjects.

35:26.120 --> 35:28.120
 They're not taking any specific drugs.

35:28.120 --> 35:30.680
 They don't have any impairments that we're aware of.

35:30.680 --> 35:32.720
 And what it showed, what it proved

35:32.720 --> 35:34.840
 is that the adult brain is very plastic.

35:34.840 --> 35:36.980
 And they did some beautiful control experiments

35:36.980 --> 35:39.040
 that are important for everyone to understand,

35:39.040 --> 35:40.680
 which is that sometimes they would bring people in

35:40.680 --> 35:43.480
 and they would have them touch these bumps

35:43.480 --> 35:45.120
 on this spinning drum.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.760
 But they would have the person pay attention

35:46.760 --> 35:48.000
 to an auditory cue.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.440
 Every time a tone would go off

35:49.440 --> 35:51.960
 or there was a shift in the pitch of that tone,

35:51.960 --> 35:53.240
 they would have to signal that.

35:53.240 --> 35:54.620
 So the subject thought they were doing something

35:54.620 --> 35:55.800
 related to touch and hearing.

35:55.800 --> 35:59.680
 And all that showed was that it wasn't just the mere action

35:59.680 --> 36:01.400
 of touching these bumps.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.680
 They had to pay attention to the bumps themselves.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.820
 If they were placing their attention

36:05.820 --> 36:08.880
 on the auditory cue, on the tone,

36:08.880 --> 36:10.400
 well, then there was plasticity

36:10.400 --> 36:12.320
 in the auditory portion of the brain,

36:12.320 --> 36:14.200
 but not on the touch portion of the brain.

36:14.200 --> 36:17.880
 And this really spits in the face of this thing

36:17.880 --> 36:20.640
 that you hear so often, which is every experience

36:20.640 --> 36:22.940
 that you have is going to change the way your brain works.

36:22.940 --> 36:24.220
 Absolutely not.

36:25.060 --> 36:29.660
 The experiences that you pay super careful attention to

36:29.660 --> 36:31.700
 are what open up plasticity.

36:31.700 --> 36:36.060
 And it opens up plasticity to that specific experience.

36:36.060 --> 36:38.800
 So the question then is why?

36:38.800 --> 36:41.200
 And Merzenich and his graduate students and postdocs

36:41.200 --> 36:43.560
 went on to address this question of why.

36:43.560 --> 36:45.440
 And it turns out the answer

36:45.440 --> 36:48.520
 is a very straightforward neurochemical answer.

36:48.520 --> 36:51.120
 And inside of that answer is the opportunity

36:51.120 --> 36:53.980
 for any of us to change our brain at any point

36:53.980 --> 36:55.180
 throughout our lifespan,

36:55.180 --> 36:57.520
 essentially for anything that we want to learn.

36:57.520 --> 37:00.380
 That could be subtracting an emotion

37:00.380 --> 37:02.080
 from an experience we've had.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.120
 It could be building a greater range of emotion.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.400
 It could be learning new information

37:07.400 --> 37:09.000
 like learning a new language.

37:09.000 --> 37:14.000
 It could be learning new motor skill like dance or sport,

37:14.020 --> 37:17.780
 or it could be some combination of cognitive motor.

37:17.780 --> 37:19.900
 So for instance, an air traffic controller

37:19.900 --> 37:21.120
 has to do a lot with their mind

37:21.120 --> 37:22.820
 in addition to a lot with their hands.

37:22.820 --> 37:24.380
 So it's not just cognitive,

37:24.380 --> 37:26.380
 it's not just motor, but combined.

37:26.380 --> 37:28.700
 So we're going to talk about what that chemical is,

37:28.700 --> 37:31.960
 but to just give you an important hint,

37:31.960 --> 37:35.700
 that chemical is the same chemical of stress.

37:35.700 --> 37:38.940
 This is not a discussion about stress per se.

37:38.940 --> 37:40.420
 In a future podcast episode,

37:40.420 --> 37:42.940
 we'll talk all about stress and tools to deal with stress.

37:42.940 --> 37:45.740
 It's something my lab works on quite extensively.

37:45.740 --> 37:48.300
 And it's a topic that I enjoy discussing.

37:48.300 --> 37:50.740
 But this is a topic about brain change.

37:50.740 --> 37:52.060
 And what I just told you is that

37:52.060 --> 37:53.260
 in order to change the brain,

37:53.260 --> 37:55.140
 you have to pay careful attention.

37:55.140 --> 37:59.080
 And the immediate question should be, well, why?

37:59.080 --> 38:02.640
 Well, the answer is that when we pay careful attention,

38:02.640 --> 38:04.380
 there are two neurochemicals,

38:04.380 --> 38:06.700
 neuromodulators as they're called,

38:06.700 --> 38:10.000
 that are released from multiple sites in our brain

38:10.000 --> 38:13.260
 that highlight the neural circuits

38:13.260 --> 38:16.420
 that stand a chance of changing.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.680
 Now, it's not necessarily the case

38:18.680 --> 38:19.740
 that they're going to change,

38:19.740 --> 38:21.820
 but it's the first gate that has to open

38:21.820 --> 38:23.340
 in order for change to occur.

38:23.340 --> 38:26.720
 And the first neurochemical is epinephrine, also adrenaline.

38:27.580 --> 38:29.240
 We call it adrenaline when it's released

38:29.240 --> 38:31.700
 from the adrenal glands above our kidneys,

38:31.700 --> 38:32.540
 that's in the body.

38:32.540 --> 38:33.980
 We call it epinephrine in the brain,

38:33.980 --> 38:36.760
 but they are chemically identical substances.

38:37.820 --> 38:41.060
 Epinephrine is released from a region in the brainstem

38:41.060 --> 38:42.960
 called locus coeruleus.

38:42.960 --> 38:46.460
 Fancy name, you don't need to know it unless you want to.

38:46.460 --> 38:51.460
 Locus coeruleus sends out these little wires we call axons

38:51.860 --> 38:55.980
 such that it hoses the entire brain, essentially,

38:55.980 --> 38:58.340
 in this neurochemical epinephrine.

38:58.340 --> 39:00.700
 Now, it's not always hosing the brain with epinephrine.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.460
 It's only when we are in high states of alertness

39:03.460 --> 39:05.420
 that this epinephrine is released.

39:05.420 --> 39:06.980
 But the way this circuit is designed,

39:06.980 --> 39:09.220
 it's very nonspecific.

39:09.220 --> 39:11.340
 It's essentially waking up the entire brain.

39:11.340 --> 39:13.400
 That's because the way that epinephrine works

39:13.400 --> 39:14.980
 by binding particular receptors

39:14.980 --> 39:19.220
 is to increase the likelihood that neurons will be active.

39:19.220 --> 39:23.160
 So no alertness, no neuroplasticity.

39:23.160 --> 39:26.580
 However, alertness alone is not sufficient.

39:26.580 --> 39:28.020
 As we would say, it's necessary,

39:28.020 --> 39:30.500
 but not sufficient for neuroplasticity.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.180
 We know this is true also from the work of Hubel and Wiesel,

39:34.180 --> 39:36.880
 where they looked at brain plasticity

39:36.880 --> 39:39.100
 in response to certain experiences

39:39.100 --> 39:42.900
 in subjects that were either awake or asleep.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.620
 And I hate to break it to you,

39:44.620 --> 39:47.900
 but you cannot just simply listen to things in your sleep

39:47.900 --> 39:50.220
 and learn those materials.

39:50.220 --> 39:52.040
 Later, I'll talk about how you can do certain things

39:52.040 --> 39:53.260
 in your sleep that you're unaware of

39:53.260 --> 39:54.980
 that can enhance learning of things

39:54.980 --> 39:57.800
 that you were aware of while you were awake,

39:57.800 --> 40:01.460
 but that is not the same as just listening to some music

40:01.460 --> 40:02.980
 or listening to a tape while you sleep

40:02.980 --> 40:06.560
 and expecting it to sink in, so to speak.

40:06.560 --> 40:10.160
 Epinephrine is released when we pay attention

40:10.160 --> 40:12.040
 and when we are alert.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.520
 But the most important thing for getting plasticity

40:14.520 --> 40:15.920
 is that there'll be epinephrine,

40:15.920 --> 40:17.900
 which equates to alertness,

40:17.900 --> 40:21.740
 plus the release of this neuromodulator acetylcholine.

40:21.740 --> 40:25.840
 Now, acetylcholine is released from two sites in the brain.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.320
 One is also in the brainstem,

40:28.320 --> 40:30.260
 and it's named different things in different animals,

40:30.260 --> 40:34.480
 but in humans, the most rich site of acetylcholine neurons

40:34.480 --> 40:36.280
 or neurons that make acetylcholine

40:36.280 --> 40:41.280
 is the parabigeminal nucleus or the parabrachial region.

40:41.280 --> 40:42.320
 There are a number of different names

40:42.320 --> 40:43.680
 of these aggregates of neurons.

40:43.680 --> 40:44.880
 You don't need to know the names.

40:44.880 --> 40:45.720
 All you need to know is that

40:45.720 --> 40:47.400
 you have an area in your brainstem,

40:47.400 --> 40:51.000
 and that area sends wires, these axons,

40:51.000 --> 40:55.160
 up into the area of the brain that filters sensory input.

40:55.160 --> 40:57.240
 So we have this area of the brain called the thalamus,

40:57.240 --> 40:58.640
 and it is getting bombarded

40:58.640 --> 41:01.060
 with all sorts of sensory input all the time.

41:01.060 --> 41:03.360
 Costello's snoring off to my right,

41:03.360 --> 41:05.440
 the lights that are in the room,

41:05.440 --> 41:07.780
 the presence of my computer to my left.

41:07.780 --> 41:09.340
 All of that is coming in,

41:09.340 --> 41:11.240
 but when I pay attention to something,

41:11.240 --> 41:14.120
 like if I really hone in on Costello's snoring,

41:14.120 --> 41:15.720
 I create a cone of attention,

41:15.720 --> 41:18.640
 and what that cone of attention reflects

41:18.640 --> 41:22.960
 is that acetylcholine is now amplifying the signal

41:23.940 --> 41:27.600
 of sounds that Costello is making with his snoring

41:27.600 --> 41:30.120
 and essentially making that signal greater

41:30.120 --> 41:31.600
 than all the signal around it.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.800
 What we call signal-to-noise goes up.

41:33.800 --> 41:35.440
 So those of you with an engineering background

41:35.440 --> 41:37.060
 will be familiar with signal-to-noise.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.800
 Those of you who do not have an engineering background,

41:38.800 --> 41:39.640
 don't worry about it.

41:39.640 --> 41:43.000
 All it means is that one particular shout in the crowd

41:43.000 --> 41:46.100
 comes through, Costello's snoring becomes more salient,

41:46.100 --> 41:49.320
 more apparent relative to everything else going on.

41:49.320 --> 41:52.720
 Acetylcholine acts as a spotlight,

41:52.720 --> 41:54.920
 but epinephrine for alertness,

41:54.920 --> 41:57.400
 acetylcholine spotlighting these inputs,

41:57.400 --> 42:00.640
 those two things alone are not enough to get plasticity.

42:00.640 --> 42:02.240
 There needs to be this third component,

42:02.240 --> 42:04.720
 and the third component is acetylcholine released

42:04.720 --> 42:08.160
 from an area of the forebrain called nucleus basalis.

42:08.160 --> 42:10.320
 If you really want to get technical,

42:10.320 --> 42:13.240
 it's called nucleus basalis of minort.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.740
 For any of you that are budding physicians

42:15.740 --> 42:19.000
 or going to medical school, you should know that.

42:19.000 --> 42:22.000
 If you have acetylcholine released from the brainstem,

42:22.000 --> 42:24.840
 acetylcholine released from nucleus basalis,

42:24.840 --> 42:27.540
 and epinephrine, you can change your brain.

42:27.540 --> 42:29.540
 And I can say that with confidence

42:29.540 --> 42:32.960
 because Merzenich and Recanzone, as well as other members

42:32.960 --> 42:35.920
 of the Merzenich lab, Michael Kilgard and others,

42:35.920 --> 42:38.240
 did these incredible experiments

42:38.240 --> 42:40.880
 where they stimulated the release of acetylcholine

42:40.880 --> 42:43.620
 from nucleus basalis, either with an electrode

42:43.620 --> 42:46.000
 or with some other methods that we'll talk about.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.120
 And what they found was when you stimulate

42:49.120 --> 42:52.200
 these three brain regions, locus coeruleus,

42:52.200 --> 42:54.680
 the brainstem source of acetylcholine,

42:54.680 --> 42:57.360
 and then the basal forebrain source of acetylcholine,

42:57.360 --> 43:00.120
 when you have those three things,

43:00.120 --> 43:02.960
 whatever you happen to be listening to,

43:02.960 --> 43:07.960
 doing or paying attention to, immediately in one trial

43:08.180 --> 43:10.200
 takes over the representation

43:10.200 --> 43:12.080
 of a particular area of the brain,

43:12.080 --> 43:16.160
 you essentially get rapid, massive learning in one shot.

43:16.160 --> 43:19.520
 And this has been shown again and again and again

43:19.520 --> 43:20.800
 in a variety of papers,

43:20.800 --> 43:23.600
 also by a guy named Norm Weinberger from UC Irvine.

43:23.600 --> 43:26.520
 And it is now considered a fundamental principle

43:26.520 --> 43:27.760
 of how the nervous system works.

43:27.760 --> 43:30.040
 So while Hubel and Wiesel talked about critical periods

43:30.040 --> 43:31.920
 in developmental plasticity,

43:31.920 --> 43:34.240
 it's very clear from the work of Merzenich and Weinberg

43:34.240 --> 43:37.260
 and others that if you get these three things,

43:37.260 --> 43:39.160
 if you can access these three things

43:39.160 --> 43:43.040
 of epinephrine acetylcholine from these two sources,

43:43.040 --> 43:46.700
 not only will the nervous system change, it has to change.

43:46.700 --> 43:49.140
 It absolutely will change.

43:49.140 --> 43:52.720
 And that is the most important thing for people to understand

43:52.720 --> 43:53.760
 if they want to change their brain.

43:53.760 --> 43:56.520
 You cannot just passively experience things.

43:56.520 --> 43:59.400
 And repetition can be important,

43:59.400 --> 44:01.920
 but the way to use repetition to change your brain

44:01.920 --> 44:03.520
 is fundamentally different.

44:03.520 --> 44:05.940
 So now let's talk about how we would translate

44:05.940 --> 44:08.440
 all the scientific information and history

44:08.440 --> 44:10.840
 into some protocols that you can actually apply,

44:10.840 --> 44:12.680
 because I think that's what many of you are interested in.

44:12.680 --> 44:15.360
 And I'm willing to bet that most of you are not interested

44:15.360 --> 44:17.720
 in lowering electrodes into your nucleus basalis,

44:17.720 --> 44:19.280
 and frankly, neither am I.

44:19.280 --> 44:22.040
 In episode one of the Huberman Lab Podcast,

44:22.040 --> 44:25.480
 I described the various ways that people can monitor

44:25.480 --> 44:27.280
 and change their nervous system.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.600
 Those ways include brain-machine interface,

44:29.600 --> 44:32.460
 pharmacology, behavioral practices,

44:32.460 --> 44:34.440
 and those behavioral practices, of course,

44:34.440 --> 44:36.960
 can include some dos, do this, and some don'ts,

44:36.960 --> 44:39.440
 don't do that, et cetera.

44:39.440 --> 44:41.640
 In thinking about neuroplasticity,

44:41.640 --> 44:43.240
 I want to have a very frank conversation

44:43.240 --> 44:44.760
 about what one can do,

44:44.760 --> 44:47.880
 but also acknowledge this untapped capacity

44:47.880 --> 44:49.880
 that I'm just not hearing about out there,

44:49.880 --> 44:53.340
 which is one can also combine behavioral practices

44:53.340 --> 44:54.560
 with pharmacology.

44:54.560 --> 44:57.460
 One can combine behavioral practices

44:57.460 --> 44:59.160
 with brain-machine interface.

44:59.160 --> 45:00.140
 And you don't have to do that.

45:00.140 --> 45:03.800
 In fact, I'm not recommending you do anything in particular.

45:03.800 --> 45:06.860
 As always, I'll say it again,

45:06.860 --> 45:09.280
 I'm not a physician, so I don't prescribe anything.

45:09.280 --> 45:11.240
 I'm a professor, so I profess a lot of things.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.960
 What you do with your health and your medical care

45:12.960 --> 45:13.800
 is up to you.

45:13.800 --> 45:15.680
 You're responsible for your health and wellbeing.

45:15.680 --> 45:18.480
 So I'm not going to tell you what to do or what to take.

45:18.480 --> 45:21.320
 I'm going to describe what the literature tells us

45:21.320 --> 45:24.020
 and suggests about ways to access plasticity.

45:24.020 --> 45:25.360
 We know we need epinephrine.

45:25.360 --> 45:26.640
 That means alertness.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.000
 Most people accomplish this through a cup of coffee

45:29.000 --> 45:30.140
 and a good night's sleep.

45:30.140 --> 45:33.860
 So I will say you should master your sleep schedule,

45:33.860 --> 45:36.220
 and you should figure out how much sleep you need

45:36.220 --> 45:39.100
 in order to achieve alertness when you sit down to learn.

45:40.100 --> 45:42.180
 All the tools and more science

45:42.180 --> 45:44.540
 than probably you ever wanted to hear about sleep

45:44.540 --> 45:46.800
 and how to get better at sleeping and timing your sleep,

45:46.800 --> 45:48.760
 et cetera, and naps, and all of that

45:48.760 --> 45:50.800
 is in episodes two, three, four, and five

45:50.800 --> 45:52.000
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast.

45:52.000 --> 45:53.720
 So I encourage you to refer to those

45:53.720 --> 45:56.320
 if your sleep is not where you would like it to be.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.440
 Your ability to engage in deliberate focused alertness

46:00.440 --> 46:02.160
 is in direct proportion

46:02.160 --> 46:04.360
 to how well you are sleeping on a regular basis.

46:04.360 --> 46:06.240
 I think that's kind of an obvious one.

46:06.240 --> 46:09.160
 So get your sleep handled.

46:09.160 --> 46:12.920
 But once that's in place, the question then is

46:12.920 --> 46:14.960
 how do I access this alertness?

46:14.960 --> 46:16.400
 Well, there are a number of ways.

46:16.400 --> 46:18.920
 Some people use some pretty elaborate

46:18.920 --> 46:20.440
 psychological gymnastics.

46:20.440 --> 46:23.440
 They will tell people that they're going to do something

46:23.440 --> 46:25.120
 and create some accountability.

46:25.120 --> 46:26.320
 That could be really good.

46:26.320 --> 46:28.460
 Or they'll post a picture of themselves online,

46:28.460 --> 46:30.520
 and they'll commit to learning a certain amount,

46:30.520 --> 46:32.100
 losing, excuse me, a certain amount of weight

46:32.100 --> 46:33.260
 or something like this.

46:33.260 --> 46:37.720
 So they can use either shame-based practices

46:37.720 --> 46:39.280
 to potentially embarrass themselves

46:39.280 --> 46:40.300
 if they don't follow through.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.400
 They'll write checks to organizations that they hate

46:42.400 --> 46:43.760
 and insist that they'll cash them

46:43.760 --> 46:46.480
 if they don't actually follow through.

46:46.480 --> 46:48.280
 Or they'll do it out of love.

46:48.280 --> 46:51.920
 They'll decide that they're going to run a marathon

46:51.920 --> 46:54.080
 or learn a language or something

46:54.080 --> 46:55.360
 because of somebody they love

46:55.360 --> 46:57.520
 or they want to devote it to somebody.

46:57.520 --> 47:01.040
 The truth is that from the standpoint of epinephrine

47:01.040 --> 47:03.860
 and getting alert and activated, it doesn't really matter.

47:03.860 --> 47:05.340
 Epinephrine is a chemical,

47:05.340 --> 47:06.560
 and your brain does not distinguish

47:06.560 --> 47:10.680
 between doing things out of love or hate, anger or fear.

47:10.680 --> 47:11.500
 It really doesn't.

47:11.500 --> 47:14.480
 All of those promote autonomic arousal

47:14.480 --> 47:15.720
 and the release of epinephrine.

47:15.720 --> 47:18.320
 So I think for most people,

47:18.320 --> 47:20.720
 if you're feeling not motivated to make these changes,

47:20.720 --> 47:23.080
 the key thing is to identify not just one,

47:23.080 --> 47:25.200
 but probably a kit of reasons,

47:25.200 --> 47:27.120
 several reasons as to why you would want

47:27.120 --> 47:28.800
 to make this particular change.

47:28.800 --> 47:31.640
 And being drawn toward a particular goal

47:31.640 --> 47:33.200
 that you're excited about can be one.

47:33.200 --> 47:37.640
 Also being motivated to not be completely afraid,

47:37.640 --> 47:39.440
 ashamed or humiliated for not following through

47:39.440 --> 47:40.800
 on a goal is another.

47:40.800 --> 47:42.920
 Just want to briefly mention one little aside there

47:42.920 --> 47:44.800
 because I've got a friend who's a physician.

47:44.800 --> 47:47.400
 He's a cardiologist who has a really interesting theory.

47:47.400 --> 47:48.240
 This is just theory,

47:48.240 --> 47:50.280
 but I think it will resonate with a lot of people,

47:50.280 --> 47:53.120
 which is that you've all heard of this molecule dopamine

47:53.120 --> 47:55.720
 that gives us this sense of reward

47:55.720 --> 47:57.100
 when we accomplish something.

47:57.100 --> 47:59.800
 Well, we also want to be able to access dopamine

47:59.800 --> 48:01.000
 while we're working towards things.

48:01.000 --> 48:02.720
 Enjoy the process, as they say,

48:02.720 --> 48:04.760
 because it has all sorts of positive effects.

48:04.760 --> 48:06.320
 It gives us energy, et cetera.

48:06.320 --> 48:08.440
 With my friend, what he says is,

48:08.440 --> 48:10.720
 there's many, many instances

48:10.720 --> 48:11.960
 where someone will come to him and say,

48:11.960 --> 48:13.800
 you know what, I'm going to write a book.

48:13.800 --> 48:15.320
 And he says, oh, that's great.

48:15.320 --> 48:16.600
 I'm sure the book's going to be terrific

48:16.600 --> 48:17.880
 and you really should write a book.

48:17.880 --> 48:18.900
 And then they never go do it.

48:18.900 --> 48:21.200
 And his theory is if you get so much dopamine

48:21.200 --> 48:22.960
 from the reward of people saying,

48:22.960 --> 48:24.880
 oh yeah, you're absolutely going to be able to do that,

48:24.880 --> 48:26.260
 you might not actually go after

48:26.260 --> 48:29.000
 the reward of the accomplishment itself.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.440
 So beware these positive reinforcements also.

48:32.440 --> 48:34.220
 Not saying people should flagellate themselves

48:34.220 --> 48:36.840
 to the point of victory in whatever they're pursuing,

48:36.840 --> 48:39.340
 but motivation is a tricky one.

48:39.340 --> 48:42.480
 So I suggest that everyone ask themselves,

48:42.480 --> 48:44.480
 what is it that I want to accomplish?

48:44.480 --> 48:47.620
 And what is it that's driving me to accomplish this?

48:47.620 --> 48:49.600
 And come up with two or three things,

48:49.600 --> 48:52.400
 fear-based perhaps, love-based perhaps,

48:52.400 --> 48:54.200
 or perhaps several of those,

48:54.200 --> 48:57.640
 in order to ensure alertness,

48:57.640 --> 48:59.880
 energy and attention for the task.

48:59.880 --> 49:02.040
 And that brings us to the attention part.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.380
 Now it's one thing to have an electrode

49:03.380 --> 49:04.340
 embedded into your brain

49:04.340 --> 49:06.760
 and increase the amount of acetylcholine.

49:06.760 --> 49:08.580
 It's another to exist in the real world

49:08.580 --> 49:11.800
 outside the laboratory and have trouble focusing,

49:11.800 --> 49:13.960
 having trouble bringing your attention

49:13.960 --> 49:17.560
 to a particular location and space for a particular event.

49:17.560 --> 49:19.600
 And there's a lot of discussion nowadays

49:19.600 --> 49:22.160
 about smartphones and devices

49:22.160 --> 49:24.220
 creating a sort of attention deficit,

49:25.320 --> 49:27.160
 almost at a clinical level for many people,

49:27.160 --> 49:28.740
 including adults.

49:28.740 --> 49:30.520
 I think that's largely true.

49:30.520 --> 49:32.240
 And what it means however,

49:32.240 --> 49:34.000
 is that we all are responsible for learning

49:34.000 --> 49:36.860
 how to create depth of focus.

49:36.860 --> 49:39.840
 There are some important neuroscience principles

49:39.840 --> 49:41.760
 to get depth of focus.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.980
 I want to briefly talk about the pharmacology first,

49:43.980 --> 49:45.360
 because I always get asked about this.

49:45.360 --> 49:46.740
 People say, what can I take

49:46.740 --> 49:48.780
 to increase my levels of acetylcholine?

49:48.780 --> 49:50.520
 Well, there are things you can take.

49:50.520 --> 49:53.180
 Nicotine is called nicotine

49:53.180 --> 49:56.660
 because acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptor.

49:56.660 --> 49:58.420
 There are two kinds of acetylcholine receptors,

49:58.420 --> 49:59.460
 muscarinic and nicotinic,

49:59.460 --> 50:00.940
 but the nicotinic ones are involved

50:00.940 --> 50:02.660
 in attention and alertness.

50:03.820 --> 50:05.060
 I have colleagues,

50:05.060 --> 50:08.640
 these are not my kind of like bro science buddies.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.140
 I have those friends too.

50:10.140 --> 50:13.020
 This is a Nobel prize winning colleague

50:13.020 --> 50:15.380
 who choose Nicorette while he works.

50:15.380 --> 50:17.340
 He used to be a smoker.

50:17.340 --> 50:19.780
 He quit smoking because of fear of lung cancer.

50:19.780 --> 50:21.220
 It's like a smart choice,

50:21.220 --> 50:23.860
 but he missed the level of focus

50:23.860 --> 50:26.100
 that he could bring to his work.

50:26.100 --> 50:28.060
 This is somebody who's had a very long career.

50:28.060 --> 50:29.860
 And if you ever meet with him,

50:29.860 --> 50:32.040
 unfortunately I can't name him.

50:32.040 --> 50:32.880
 If you ever meet with him,

50:32.880 --> 50:33.700
 what you realize is he choose

50:33.700 --> 50:35.500
 about five pieces of Nicorette an hour,

50:35.500 --> 50:37.780
 which I am not suggesting people do.

50:37.780 --> 50:39.100
 But when I asked him, why are you doing this?

50:39.100 --> 50:42.220
 He said, well, increases my alertness and focus.

50:42.220 --> 50:43.620
 And also his theory,

50:43.620 --> 50:45.980
 and I want to really underscore that it's theory

50:45.980 --> 50:47.580
 not scientifically supported yet

50:47.580 --> 50:50.900
 is that it offsets Parkinson's and Alzheimer's.

50:50.900 --> 50:54.660
 It is true that nucleus basalis is the primary site

50:54.660 --> 50:56.860
 of degeneration in the brain

50:56.860 --> 50:59.340
 in people that have dementia and Parkinson's.

50:59.340 --> 51:01.700
 And it's what leads to a lot of their inability

51:01.700 --> 51:03.340
 to focus their attention,

51:03.340 --> 51:05.600
 not just deficits in plasticity.

51:05.600 --> 51:07.420
 So he might be onto something.

51:07.420 --> 51:08.620
 Now I've tried chewing Nicorette.

51:08.620 --> 51:10.240
 It makes me super jittery.

51:10.240 --> 51:12.580
 I don't like it because I can't focus very well.

51:12.580 --> 51:13.940
 It kind of takes me too far up

51:13.940 --> 51:15.740
 the level of autonomic arousal.

51:15.740 --> 51:18.020
 I've got friends that dip Nicorette all day,

51:18.020 --> 51:20.300
 some of whom are scientists.

51:20.300 --> 51:22.220
 Writers and artists and musicians

51:22.220 --> 51:24.340
 are familiar with the effects of nicotine

51:24.340 --> 51:26.140
 from the era where a lot of people smoked

51:26.140 --> 51:28.640
 and fortunately fewer people smoke now.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.660
 So if you're interested in the pharmacology,

51:30.660 --> 51:31.960
 there are supplements and things

51:31.960 --> 51:35.620
 that can increase cholinergic transmission in the brain.

51:35.620 --> 51:36.940
 I'm not suggesting you do this,

51:36.940 --> 51:39.500
 but if you're gonna go down that route,

51:39.500 --> 51:40.940
 you want to be very careful

51:40.940 --> 51:43.460
 how much you rely on those all the time

51:43.460 --> 51:46.040
 because the essence of plasticity

51:46.040 --> 51:48.360
 is to create a window of attention and focus

51:48.360 --> 51:50.540
 that's distinct from the rest of your day.

51:50.540 --> 51:53.700
 That's what's going to create a mark in your brain

51:53.700 --> 51:55.940
 and the potential for plasticity.

51:55.940 --> 51:57.660
 Things that increase acetylcholine

51:57.660 --> 52:01.100
 besides nicotine or Nicorette,

52:01.100 --> 52:03.880
 so the nicotine could come from a variety of sources,

52:03.880 --> 52:07.380
 or things like alpha-GPC or choline.

52:07.380 --> 52:08.420
 There are a number of these things.

52:08.420 --> 52:11.700
 I would encourage you to go to examine.com, the website,

52:11.700 --> 52:13.060
 and just put in acetylcholine

52:13.060 --> 52:15.000
 and it will give you a list of supplements

52:15.000 --> 52:17.060
 as well as some of the dangers of these supplements

52:17.060 --> 52:19.260
 that are associated with cholinergic transmission.

52:19.260 --> 52:22.000
 But I would be remiss and I would be lying

52:22.000 --> 52:24.560
 if I didn't say that there are a lot of people out there

52:24.560 --> 52:28.140
 who are using cholinergic drugs

52:28.140 --> 52:31.160
 in order to increase their level of focus.

52:31.160 --> 52:33.180
 And since we're coming up on the Olympics,

52:33.180 --> 52:34.280
 I don't want to get anyone in trouble,

52:34.280 --> 52:37.900
 but I'm well aware that the fact that the sprinters

52:37.900 --> 52:39.940
 are really into cholinergic drugs

52:39.940 --> 52:42.900
 because not only is acetylcholine important for the focus

52:42.900 --> 52:44.200
 that allows them to hear the gun

52:44.200 --> 52:46.340
 and be first out the blocks on the sprints,

52:46.340 --> 52:48.180
 that's a lot of where the race is won,

52:49.060 --> 52:51.660
 hearing that gun and being quickest on reaction time,

52:51.660 --> 52:53.780
 so they take cholinergic agents for that,

52:53.780 --> 52:56.980
 as well as acetylcholine is the molecule

52:56.980 --> 52:59.500
 that controls nerve to muscle contraction.

52:59.500 --> 53:01.740
 So your speed of reflexes is actually controlled

53:01.740 --> 53:04.260
 by this nicotinic transmission as well.

53:04.260 --> 53:07.900
 So lots to think about in terms of acetylcholine in sport

53:07.900 --> 53:10.980
 and mental acuity, not just plasticity.

53:10.980 --> 53:12.460
 Now, for most of you,

53:12.460 --> 53:14.200
 you probably don't want to chew Nicorette,

53:14.200 --> 53:15.440
 definitely don't want to smoke cigarettes

53:15.440 --> 53:18.360
 or take supplements for increasing acetylcholine.

53:18.360 --> 53:21.900
 So what are some ways that you can increase acetylcholine?

53:21.900 --> 53:23.780
 And there, it's going to sound like a bit

53:23.780 --> 53:26.820
 of a circular argument, but you want to increase focus.

53:26.820 --> 53:28.700
 How do you increase focus?

53:28.700 --> 53:30.780
 You know, people are so familiar with sitting down,

53:30.780 --> 53:32.100
 reading a couple pages of a book

53:32.100 --> 53:33.900
 and realizing that none of it sunk in

53:33.900 --> 53:36.580
 or talking to someone and seeing their mouth move,

53:36.580 --> 53:38.580
 maybe even nodding your head subconsciously

53:38.580 --> 53:41.340
 and you come, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, and none of it sinks in.

53:41.340 --> 53:44.020
 This can be very damaging for school, work performance

53:44.020 --> 53:46.260
 and relationships, as many of you know.

53:48.720 --> 53:50.980
 Costello, incidentally, never seems to pay attention

53:50.980 --> 53:53.420
 to anything I say while looking directly at me,

53:53.420 --> 53:55.100
 which contradicts what I'm about to say,

53:55.100 --> 53:59.960
 which is that the best way to get better at focusing

53:59.960 --> 54:04.420
 is to use the mechanisms of focus that you were born with.

54:04.420 --> 54:08.340
 And the key principle here is that mental focus

54:08.340 --> 54:10.260
 follows visual focus.

54:11.300 --> 54:13.720
 We are all familiar with the fact that our visual system

54:13.720 --> 54:17.420
 can be unfocused, blurry, or jumping around,

54:17.420 --> 54:21.400
 or we can be very laser focused on one location in space.

54:21.400 --> 54:24.620
 What's interesting and vitally important to understanding

54:24.620 --> 54:26.580
 how to access neuroplasticity

54:26.580 --> 54:29.400
 is that you can use your visual focus

54:29.400 --> 54:31.820
 and you can increase your visual focus

54:31.820 --> 54:35.540
 as a way of increasing your mental focus abilities

54:35.540 --> 54:37.000
 more broadly.

54:37.000 --> 54:38.780
 So I'm gonna explain how to do that.

54:38.780 --> 54:41.780
 Plasticity starts with alertness.

54:41.780 --> 54:43.060
 And as I mentioned before,

54:43.060 --> 54:46.220
 that alertness can come from a sense of love,

54:46.220 --> 54:49.380
 a sense of joy, a sense of fear, doesn't matter.

54:50.300 --> 54:53.680
 There are pharmacologic ways to access alertness too.

54:53.680 --> 54:56.500
 The most common one is of course caffeine,

54:56.500 --> 54:58.340
 which if you watch the sleep episodes,

54:58.340 --> 55:00.100
 you know reduces this molecule

55:00.100 --> 55:02.740
 that makes us sleepy called adenosine.

55:02.740 --> 55:04.620
 I drink plenty of caffeine.

55:04.620 --> 55:07.160
 I'm a heavy user of caffeine.

55:07.160 --> 55:09.020
 I don't think abuser of caffeine.

55:09.020 --> 55:10.100
 I think in reasonable amounts,

55:10.100 --> 55:12.140
 provided we can still fall asleep at night.

55:12.140 --> 55:15.220
 Caffeine can be a relatively safe way

55:15.220 --> 55:16.640
 to increase epinephrine.

55:17.860 --> 55:21.960
 Now, many people are now also using Adderall.

55:21.960 --> 55:25.420
 Adderall chemically looks a lot like amphetamine.

55:25.420 --> 55:27.900
 And basically it is amphetamine.

55:27.900 --> 55:30.300
 It will increase epinephrine release from locus coeruleus.

55:30.300 --> 55:31.840
 It will wake up the brain.

55:31.840 --> 55:33.620
 And that's why a lot of people rely on it.

55:33.620 --> 55:38.420
 It does have a heavy basis for use

55:38.420 --> 55:40.760
 in certain clinical syndromes prescribed

55:40.760 --> 55:43.060
 such as attention deficit.

55:43.060 --> 55:47.500
 However, it also has a high probability of abuse,

55:47.500 --> 55:50.020
 especially in those who are not prescribed it.

55:50.020 --> 55:52.060
 Adderall will not increase focus.

55:52.060 --> 55:53.620
 It increases alertness.

55:53.620 --> 55:56.460
 It does not touch the acetylcholine system.

55:56.460 --> 55:58.840
 And if those of you that are taking Adderall say,

55:58.840 --> 56:01.500
 well, it really increases my focus overall,

56:01.500 --> 56:03.900
 that's probably because your autonomic nervous system

56:03.900 --> 56:06.800
 is just veering towards what we call parasympathetic.

56:06.800 --> 56:08.340
 You're really just very sleepy.

56:08.340 --> 56:11.100
 And so it's bringing your levels of alertness up.

56:11.100 --> 56:13.580
 As I mentioned, Adderall is very problematic

56:13.580 --> 56:14.420
 for a number of people.

56:14.420 --> 56:16.660
 It can be habit forming.

56:16.660 --> 56:19.540
 Learning on Adderall does not always translate

56:19.540 --> 56:23.520
 to high performance off or on Adderall at later times.

56:23.520 --> 56:26.160
 And the Adderall discussion is a broader one

56:26.160 --> 56:28.420
 that perhaps we should have with a psychiatrist

56:28.420 --> 56:29.320
 in the room at some point,

56:29.320 --> 56:32.220
 because it is a very widely abused drug

56:32.220 --> 56:33.460
 at this point in time.

56:34.380 --> 56:38.180
 The acetylcholine system and the focus that it brings

56:38.180 --> 56:41.380
 is available, as I mentioned, through pharmacology,

56:41.380 --> 56:43.660
 but also through these behavioral practices.

56:43.660 --> 56:46.560
 And the behavioral practices that are anchored

56:46.560 --> 56:48.660
 in visual focus are going to be the ones

56:48.660 --> 56:51.820
 that are going to allow you to develop great depth

56:51.820 --> 56:53.760
 and duration of focus.

56:53.760 --> 56:56.540
 So let's think about visual focus for a second.

56:56.540 --> 57:01.200
 When we focus on something visually, we have two options.

57:01.200 --> 57:04.780
 We can either look at a very small region of space

57:04.780 --> 57:07.620
 with a lot of detail and a lot of precision,

57:07.620 --> 57:10.320
 or we can dilate our gaze and we can see big pieces

57:10.320 --> 57:12.260
 of visual space with very little detail.

57:12.260 --> 57:13.100
 It's a trade-off.

57:13.100 --> 57:15.220
 We can't look at everything at high resolution.

57:15.220 --> 57:16.460
 This is why we have these,

57:16.460 --> 57:19.900
 the pupil more or less relates to the fovea of the eye,

57:19.900 --> 57:22.060
 which is the area in which we have the most receptors,

57:22.060 --> 57:25.060
 the highest density of receptors that perceive light.

57:25.060 --> 57:27.260
 And so our acuity is much better in the center

57:27.260 --> 57:29.820
 of our visual field than in our periphery.

57:29.820 --> 57:31.300
 It's a simple experiment you can do right now.

57:31.300 --> 57:33.000
 If you're listening to this, you can still do it.

57:33.000 --> 57:34.860
 You can hold your hands out in front of you,

57:34.860 --> 57:35.860
 provided that you're sighted.

57:35.860 --> 57:37.180
 You should be able to see how many fingers

57:37.180 --> 57:38.580
 you have in front of you.

57:38.580 --> 57:39.540
 For me, it's five.

57:39.540 --> 57:42.000
 Still got all five fingers, amazingly enough.

57:43.100 --> 57:45.860
 If I move my hand off to the side,

57:45.860 --> 57:47.660
 I can't see them with precision,

57:47.660 --> 57:50.020
 but as I move them back into the center of my visual field,

57:50.020 --> 57:51.460
 I can see them with precision.

57:51.460 --> 57:53.100
 And that's because the density,

57:53.100 --> 57:55.040
 the number of pixels in the center of my visual field

57:55.040 --> 57:57.340
 is much higher than it is in the periphery.

57:57.340 --> 58:00.240
 When we focus our eyes, we do a couple things.

58:00.240 --> 58:02.260
 First of all, we tend to do that

58:02.260 --> 58:03.500
 in the center of our visual field,

58:03.500 --> 58:04.960
 and our two eyes tend to align

58:04.960 --> 58:06.360
 in what's called a vergence eye movement

58:06.360 --> 58:08.480
 towards a common point.

58:08.480 --> 58:10.800
 The other thing that happens is the lens of our eye moves

58:10.800 --> 58:14.620
 so that our brain now no longer sees the entire visual world

58:14.620 --> 58:18.100
 but is seeing a small cone of visual imagery.

58:19.620 --> 58:22.580
 That was the dog bumping into the wall, forgive me.

58:22.580 --> 58:24.780
 That small cone of visual imagery

58:24.780 --> 58:28.700
 or soda straw view of the world has much higher acuity,

58:28.700 --> 58:31.620
 higher resolution than if I were to look at everything.

58:32.760 --> 58:34.860
 Now you say, of course, this makes perfect sense,

58:34.860 --> 58:37.380
 but that's about visual attention, not mental attention.

58:37.380 --> 58:41.340
 Well, it turns out that focus in the brain

58:41.340 --> 58:43.860
 is anchored to our visual system.

58:43.860 --> 58:45.380
 I'll talk about blind people in a moment,

58:45.380 --> 58:48.040
 but assuming that somebody is sighted,

58:48.040 --> 58:51.300
 the key is to learn how to focus better visually

58:51.300 --> 58:54.140
 if you want to bring about higher levels

58:54.140 --> 58:55.940
 of cognitive or mental focus,

58:55.940 --> 58:58.500
 even if you're engaged in a physical task.

58:58.500 --> 59:02.460
 Now, there's a remarkable phenomenon in animals

59:02.460 --> 59:05.740
 where animals that have their eyes on the side of their head

59:05.740 --> 59:08.200
 are scanning the entire visual environment all the time.

59:08.200 --> 59:09.300
 They're not focused on anything.

59:09.300 --> 59:11.600
 Think you're grazing animals, your cows, your sheep,

59:11.600 --> 59:13.080
 your birds, et cetera.

59:13.080 --> 59:15.760
 But think about a bird picking up seeds

59:15.760 --> 59:18.100
 on the beach or on concrete.

59:18.100 --> 59:20.380
 That bird's head is up here.

59:20.380 --> 59:21.960
 It's up about a foot off the ground,

59:21.960 --> 59:24.660
 or if it's a small bird, about six inches off the ground,

59:24.660 --> 59:26.380
 and its eyes are on the side of its head,

59:26.380 --> 59:28.940
 and yet it has this tiny beak that can quickly pick up

59:28.940 --> 59:32.420
 these little seeds off the ground with immense precision.

59:32.420 --> 59:35.260
 Now, if you try to do that by staring off

59:35.260 --> 59:37.340
 to the sides of the room and picking up items

59:37.340 --> 59:40.220
 in front of you with high precision at that tiny scale,

59:40.220 --> 59:43.260
 little tiny objects, you will miss almost every time.

59:43.260 --> 59:45.540
 They do it perfectly, and they don't smash their beak

59:45.540 --> 59:46.540
 into the ground and damage it.

59:46.540 --> 59:50.460
 They do it with beautiful movement acuity also.

59:50.460 --> 59:51.880
 So how do they do it?

59:51.880 --> 59:55.300
 How do they create this focus or this awareness

59:55.300 --> 59:56.140
 of what's in front of them?

59:56.140 --> 59:58.780
 It turns out as they lower their head,

59:58.780 --> 1:00:02.180
 their eyes very briefly move inward

1:00:02.180 --> 1:00:04.260
 in what's called a virgin's eye movement.

1:00:04.260 --> 1:00:07.900
 Now, their eyes can't actually translocate in their head.

1:00:07.900 --> 1:00:10.500
 They're fixed in the skull, just like yours and mine are.

1:00:10.500 --> 1:00:13.940
 But when we move our eyes slightly inward,

1:00:13.940 --> 1:00:17.140
 maybe you can tell that I'm doing it like so,

1:00:17.140 --> 1:00:21.100
 basically shortening or making the interpupillary distance,

1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:24.020
 as it's called, smaller, two things happen.

1:00:24.020 --> 1:00:27.260
 Not only do we develop a smaller visual window

1:00:27.260 --> 1:00:31.100
 into the world, but we activate a set of neurons

1:00:31.100 --> 1:00:33.980
 in our brainstem that trigger the release

1:00:33.980 --> 1:00:38.100
 of both norepinephrine, epinephrine, and acetylcholine.

1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:40.260
 Norepinephrine is kind of similar to epinephrine.

1:00:40.260 --> 1:00:43.560
 So in other words, when our eyes are relaxed in our head,

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:44.400
 when we're just kind of looking

1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:45.620
 at our entire visual environment,

1:00:45.620 --> 1:00:47.500
 moving our head around, moving through space,

1:00:47.500 --> 1:00:49.760
 we're in optic flow, things moving past us,

1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:53.100
 or we're sitting still, we're looking broadly at our space,

1:00:53.100 --> 1:00:54.780
 we're relaxed.

1:00:54.780 --> 1:00:57.220
 When our eyes move slightly inward

1:00:57.220 --> 1:00:59.100
 toward a particular visual target,

1:00:59.100 --> 1:01:00.940
 our visual world shrinks,

1:01:00.940 --> 1:01:03.100
 our level of visual focus goes up,

1:01:03.100 --> 1:01:05.840
 and we know that this relates to the release

1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:07.760
 of acetylcholine and epinephrine

1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:10.860
 at the relevant sites in the brain for plasticity.

1:01:10.860 --> 1:01:13.660
 Now, what this means is that if you have a hard time

1:01:13.660 --> 1:01:18.220
 focusing your mind for sake of reading or for listening,

1:01:18.220 --> 1:01:20.740
 you need to practice, and you can practice,

1:01:20.740 --> 1:01:22.820
 focusing your visual system.

1:01:22.820 --> 1:01:25.380
 Now, this works best if you practice

1:01:25.380 --> 1:01:28.460
 focusing your visual system at the precise distance

1:01:28.460 --> 1:01:31.660
 from the work that you intend to do for sake of plasticity.

1:01:31.660 --> 1:01:33.860
 So how would this look in the real world?

1:01:33.860 --> 1:01:36.180
 Let's say I am trying to concentrate

1:01:36.180 --> 1:01:39.220
 on something related to, I don't know, science.

1:01:39.220 --> 1:01:40.160
 I'm reading a science paper,

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:42.840
 and I'm having a hard time, it's not absorbing.

1:01:42.840 --> 1:01:45.140
 I might think that I'm only looking at the paper

1:01:45.140 --> 1:01:46.980
 that I'm reading, I'm only looking at my screen,

1:01:46.980 --> 1:01:49.420
 but actually my eyes are probably darting around a bit.

1:01:49.420 --> 1:01:51.020
 Experiments have been done on this.

1:01:51.020 --> 1:01:54.460
 Or I'm gathering information from too many sources

1:01:54.460 --> 1:01:55.860
 in the visual environment.

1:01:55.860 --> 1:01:57.780
 Now, presumably, because it's me,

1:01:57.780 --> 1:01:59.860
 I've already had my coffee, I'm hydrated,

1:01:59.860 --> 1:02:01.940
 I'm well rested, I slept well,

1:02:01.940 --> 1:02:05.120
 and I still experience these challenges in focusing.

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:08.540
 Spending just 60 to 120 seconds

1:02:08.540 --> 1:02:12.920
 focusing my visual attention on a small window of my screen,

1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:15.720
 meaning just on my screen with nothing on it,

1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:19.080
 but bringing my eyes to that particular location

1:02:19.080 --> 1:02:22.320
 increases not just my visual acuity for that location,

1:02:22.320 --> 1:02:25.500
 but it brings about an increase in activity

1:02:25.500 --> 1:02:28.840
 in a bunch of other brain areas that are associated

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:33.340
 with gathering information from this location.

1:02:33.340 --> 1:02:38.060
 So put simply, if you want to improve your ability to focus,

1:02:38.060 --> 1:02:40.080
 practice visual focus.

1:02:40.080 --> 1:02:44.400
 Now, if you wear contacts or you wear corrective lenses,

1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:46.500
 that's fine, you of course would want to use those.

1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:50.020
 You don't want to take those off and use a blurry image.

1:02:50.020 --> 1:02:51.940
 The finer the visual image,

1:02:51.940 --> 1:02:53.720
 and the more that you can hold your gaze

1:02:53.720 --> 1:02:55.020
 to that visual image,

1:02:55.020 --> 1:02:58.320
 the higher your levels of attention will be.

1:02:58.320 --> 1:03:00.660
 Many times on Instagram and here I've been teased

1:03:00.660 --> 1:03:02.080
 for not blinking very often.

1:03:02.080 --> 1:03:03.980
 That's actually a practiced thing.

1:03:03.980 --> 1:03:06.220
 We blink more as we get tired,

1:03:06.220 --> 1:03:08.600
 which as you hear it, you'll probably just say duh.

1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:11.180
 As we get tired, the neurons in the brainstem

1:03:11.180 --> 1:03:12.760
 that are responsible for alertness

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:15.520
 and that hold the eyelids open start to falter

1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:16.840
 and our eyelids start to close.

1:03:16.840 --> 1:03:18.000
 This is why it's hard,

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.280
 the words I could barely keep my eyes open,

1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:22.000
 which may be how you feel right now.

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:24.840
 But assuming that you're paying attention and you're alert,

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:27.980
 when you're very alert, your eyes are wide.

1:03:27.980 --> 1:03:29.480
 Your eyes are open.

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:32.220
 And as you get tired, your eyelids start to close.

1:03:32.220 --> 1:03:36.520
 Blinks actually reset our perception of time and space.

1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:38.680
 This was shown in a beautiful paper in Current Biology.

1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:41.600
 I'll be sure to post the reference in the notes.

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:45.200
 And blinking of course is necessary to lubricate the eyes.

1:03:45.200 --> 1:03:47.440
 People blink because their eyes might get dry.

1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:51.240
 But if you can keep focus by blinking less

1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:53.420
 and by focusing your eyes to a particular location,

1:03:53.420 --> 1:03:55.260
 that's probably pretty creepy for you to experience

1:03:55.260 --> 1:03:56.400
 as I'm doing this.

1:03:56.400 --> 1:03:57.920
 But the more that you can do this,

1:03:57.920 --> 1:04:00.720
 the more that you can maintain a kind of a cone

1:04:00.720 --> 1:04:02.940
 or a tunnel of mental focus.

1:04:02.940 --> 1:04:04.880
 And so I'm sort of revealing my practice,

1:04:04.880 --> 1:04:09.280
 which is that I've worked very hard through blinking contests

1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:11.960
 with my 14 year old niece who still beats me every time

1:04:11.960 --> 1:04:12.920
 and it really bothers me,

1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:15.740
 but also just through my own self-practice

1:04:15.740 --> 1:04:19.560
 of learning to blink less and focus my visual attention

1:04:19.560 --> 1:04:21.040
 on a smaller region of space.

1:04:21.040 --> 1:04:22.760
 Now for me, that's important

1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:26.100
 because I'm mainly learning things on a computer screen.

1:04:26.100 --> 1:04:28.560
 If you're going to be doing sport,

1:04:28.560 --> 1:04:29.480
 it's quite a bit different

1:04:29.480 --> 1:04:31.620
 and we can discuss how you might translate that to sport.

1:04:31.620 --> 1:04:33.300
 In fact, in the next episode,

1:04:33.300 --> 1:04:35.960
 I'm gonna talk all about how plasticity

1:04:35.960 --> 1:04:37.560
 and the focus mechanisms relate

1:04:37.560 --> 1:04:40.880
 to learning of movement practices and coordinated movements.

1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:42.880
 It's an entire discussion unto itself,

1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:44.020
 but the same principle holds.

1:04:44.020 --> 1:04:45.940
 So we need alertness.

1:04:45.940 --> 1:04:50.240
 You can get that through mental tricks of motivation,

1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:52.520
 fear or love, whatever it is.

1:04:52.520 --> 1:04:55.680
 Pharmacology, please do it healthfully.

1:04:55.680 --> 1:04:57.720
 Caffeine, if that's in your practice.

1:04:57.720 --> 1:04:59.400
 Certainly want to be well hydrated.

1:04:59.400 --> 1:05:02.320
 That increases, actually will increase alertness.

1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:04.140
 Having a very full bladder will increase alertness,

1:05:04.140 --> 1:05:07.000
 although you don't want your alertness to be so high,

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:08.280
 do that, all you can think about it

1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:10.160
 is the fact that you have to go urinate

1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:11.560
 because that's very distracting.

1:05:11.560 --> 1:05:14.040
 You don't want your alertness to go through the roof.

1:05:14.980 --> 1:05:18.160
 You need focus and visual focus is the primary way

1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:21.280
 in which we start to deploy these neurochemicals.

1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:24.840
 Now you may ask, well, what about the experiment

1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:27.140
 where people were feeling this rotating drum

1:05:27.140 --> 1:05:28.440
 or listening to the auditory cue,

1:05:28.440 --> 1:05:29.800
 that doesn't involve vision at all.

1:05:29.800 --> 1:05:32.760
 Ah, if you look at people who are learning things

1:05:34.120 --> 1:05:35.240
 with their auditory system,

1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:36.840
 they will often close their eyes

1:05:36.840 --> 1:05:38.360
 and that's not a coincidence.

1:05:38.360 --> 1:05:40.260
 If somebody is listening very hard,

1:05:41.100 --> 1:05:43.000
 please don't ask them to look you directly in the eye

1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000
 while also asking that they listen to you.

1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:46.400
 That's actually one of the worst ways

1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:47.320
 to get somebody to listen to you.

1:05:47.320 --> 1:05:49.560
 If you say, now listen to me and look me in the eye,

1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:50.760
 the visual system will take over

1:05:50.760 --> 1:05:51.920
 and they'll see your mouth move,

1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:53.060
 but they're going to hear their thoughts

1:05:53.060 --> 1:05:55.700
 more they're going to hear what you're saying.

1:05:55.700 --> 1:05:58.000
 Closing the eyes is one of the best ways

1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:00.620
 to create a cone of auditory attention.

1:06:00.620 --> 1:06:03.200
 And this is what low vision or no vision folks do.

1:06:03.200 --> 1:06:06.080
 They have tremendous capacity to focus their attention

1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:08.120
 in particular locations.

1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:10.360
 Incidentally, does anyone know the two animals

1:06:10.360 --> 1:06:13.080
 that have the best hearing in the world?

1:06:13.080 --> 1:06:14.560
 The absolute best hearing,

1:06:14.560 --> 1:06:17.120
 many orders of magnitude better than humans.

1:06:17.120 --> 1:06:19.320
 Turns out it's the elephant that might not surprise you.

1:06:19.320 --> 1:06:22.000
 They have huge ears and the moth,

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.000
 which probably will surprise you.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.280
 I didn't even know that moths could hear,

1:06:25.280 --> 1:06:27.760
 but now it explains why they're so hard to catch.

1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:32.560
 If you are not sighted,

1:06:32.560 --> 1:06:34.960
 you learn how to do this with your hearing.

1:06:34.960 --> 1:06:36.200
 If you're somebody who braille reads,

1:06:36.200 --> 1:06:37.840
 you learn how to do this with your fingers.

1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:42.840
 If you look at great piano players like Glenn Gould,

1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:46.700
 they oftentimes will turn their head to the side.

1:06:46.700 --> 1:06:49.600
 You think about some of the great musicians

1:06:49.600 --> 1:06:53.520
 that like Stevie Wonder that were blind, right?

1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:54.360
 He would look away

1:06:54.360 --> 1:06:56.480
 because he had no reason to look at the keys,

1:06:56.480 --> 1:06:58.760
 but oftentimes they'll orient an ear

1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:01.240
 or one side of their head to the keys on the piano.

1:07:01.240 --> 1:07:02.160
 As I mentioned before,

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:03.640
 people who are non-sighted have better pitch.

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:06.680
 So we have these cones of attention that we can devote.

1:07:06.680 --> 1:07:07.860
 And for most people,

1:07:07.860 --> 1:07:11.040
 vision is the primary way to train up this focus ability

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:12.000
 and these cones of attention.

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.600
 So you absolutely have to focus

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:15.200
 on the thing that you're trying to learn.

1:07:15.200 --> 1:07:17.480
 And you will feel some agitation

1:07:17.480 --> 1:07:19.120
 because of the epinephrine in your system.

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:23.200
 If you're feeling agitation and it's challenging to focus

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:24.720
 and you're feeling like you're not doing it right,

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:26.840
 chances are you're doing it right.

1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:29.700
 And you can practice this ability to stare

1:07:29.700 --> 1:07:31.840
 for long periods of time without blinking.

1:07:31.840 --> 1:07:34.040
 I know it's a little eerie for people to watch,

1:07:34.040 --> 1:07:36.080
 but if your goal is to learn how to control

1:07:36.080 --> 1:07:39.120
 that visual window for sake of controlling your focus,

1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:41.360
 it can be an immensely powerful portal

1:07:41.360 --> 1:07:43.440
 into these mechanisms of plasticity

1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:46.800
 because we know it engages things like nucleus basalis

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:49.080
 and these other brainstem mechanisms.

1:07:49.080 --> 1:07:50.480
 I get a lot of questions about

1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:53.720
 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD,

1:07:53.720 --> 1:07:56.040
 and attention deficit disorder.

1:07:56.040 --> 1:07:59.540
 Some people actually have clinically diagnosed ADD and ADHD.

1:07:59.540 --> 1:08:01.900
 And if you do, you should certainly work

1:08:01.900 --> 1:08:04.120
 with a good psychiatrist to try and figure out

1:08:04.120 --> 1:08:08.160
 the right pharmacology and or behavioral practices for you.

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:10.260
 Many people, however, have given themselves

1:08:10.260 --> 1:08:13.800
 a low grade ADHD or ADD

1:08:13.800 --> 1:08:16.840
 because of the way that they move through their world.

1:08:16.840 --> 1:08:19.400
 They are looking at their phone a lot of the time.

1:08:19.400 --> 1:08:21.220
 It's actually very easy to anchor your attention

1:08:21.220 --> 1:08:22.780
 to your phone for the following reason.

1:08:22.780 --> 1:08:25.520
 First of all, it's very restricted in size.

1:08:25.520 --> 1:08:29.000
 So it's very easy to limit your visual attention

1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:30.280
 to something about this big.

1:08:30.280 --> 1:08:33.840
 It's one of the design features of the phone.

1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:36.800
 The other is that just as you've probably heard,

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:39.000
 a picture is worth a thousand words.

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.760
 Well, a movie is worth 10,000 pictures.

1:08:42.760 --> 1:08:45.440
 Anytime we're looking at things that have motion,

1:08:45.440 --> 1:08:47.960
 visual motion, our attentional system

1:08:47.960 --> 1:08:51.980
 will naturally gravitate towards those movies.

1:08:51.980 --> 1:08:55.080
 It's actually much harder to read words on a page

1:08:55.080 --> 1:08:57.400
 than it used to be for many people

1:08:57.400 --> 1:09:00.480
 because we're used to seeing things spelled out for us

1:09:00.480 --> 1:09:04.200
 in YouTube videos or videos where things move

1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:05.920
 and are very dramatic.

1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:07.660
 It is true that the more that we look

1:09:07.660 --> 1:09:10.000
 at those motion stimuli,

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.500
 the more that we're seeing movies of things

1:09:11.500 --> 1:09:14.680
 and things that are very dramatic and very intense,

1:09:14.680 --> 1:09:17.080
 the worse we're getting at attending to things

1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:21.280
 like text on a page or to listening to something

1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:23.640
 like a podcast and extracting the information.

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:27.160
 So much so that I think many people have asked me,

1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:29.440
 why aren't you providing intense visuals

1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:30.260
 for us to look at?

1:09:30.260 --> 1:09:31.540
 Well, frankly, it's because a lot of people

1:09:31.540 --> 1:09:34.160
 are consuming this content through pure auditory,

1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:35.480
 through just by listening,

1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:38.400
 and I want them to be able to digest all the material.

1:09:38.400 --> 1:09:39.920
 But in addition to that,

1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:42.580
 if you think about the areas of life

1:09:42.580 --> 1:09:44.980
 that dictate whether or not we become successful,

1:09:44.980 --> 1:09:47.400
 independent, healthy individuals,

1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:52.680
 most of those involve the kind of boring practices

1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:55.300
 of digesting information on a page.

1:09:55.300 --> 1:09:58.480
 Boring because it's not as exciting in the moment perhaps

1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:02.680
 as watching a movie or something being spoonfed to us.

1:10:02.680 --> 1:10:04.760
 But the more attention that we can put to something,

1:10:04.760 --> 1:10:06.500
 even if it's fleeting and we feel like

1:10:06.500 --> 1:10:08.320
 we're only getting little bits and pieces,

1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:11.640
 shards of the information as opposed to the entire thing,

1:10:11.640 --> 1:10:13.360
 that has a much more powerful effect

1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:16.420
 in engaging this cholinergic system for plasticity

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:19.320
 than does, for instance, watching a movie.

1:10:19.320 --> 1:10:22.460
 And that's because when we watch a movie,

1:10:22.460 --> 1:10:24.520
 the entire thing can be great, it can be awesome,

1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:26.240
 it can be this overriding experience.

1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:28.200
 But I think for all those experiences,

1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:30.720
 if you're somebody who's interested in building your brain

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:33.340
 and expanding your brain and getting better

1:10:33.340 --> 1:10:37.320
 at various things, feeling better, doing better, et cetera,

1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:40.860
 one has to ask how much of my neurochemical resources

1:10:40.860 --> 1:10:43.120
 am I devoting to the passive experience

1:10:43.120 --> 1:10:46.660
 of letting something just kind of overwhelm me and excite me

1:10:46.660 --> 1:10:48.000
 versus something that I'm really trying

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:49.520
 to learn and take away.

1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:51.680
 And now there's another, I enjoy movie content

1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:53.480
 and TV content all the time.

1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:58.200
 I scroll Instagram often, but we are limited

1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:00.360
 in the extent to which we can grab a hold

1:11:00.360 --> 1:11:03.800
 of these acetylcholine release mechanisms or epinephrine.

1:11:03.800 --> 1:11:06.300
 And I think that we need to be careful

1:11:06.300 --> 1:11:10.400
 that we don't devote all our acetylcholine and epinephrine,

1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:12.200
 all our dopamine for that matter,

1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:14.220
 to these passive experiences of things

1:11:14.220 --> 1:11:17.080
 that are not going to enrich us and better us.

1:11:17.080 --> 1:11:20.080
 So that's a little bit of an editorial on my part,

1:11:20.080 --> 1:11:23.800
 but the phone is rich with movies,

1:11:23.800 --> 1:11:25.120
 it's rich with information.

1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:30.120
 The real question is, is the information rich for us

1:11:30.240 --> 1:11:33.640
 in ways that grow us and cultivate smarter,

1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:38.640
 more emotionally evolved people,

1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:42.040
 or is it creating, what's it doing

1:11:42.040 --> 1:11:44.440
 for our physical wellbeing for that matter?

1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:47.920
 So I don't want to tell people what to do or not to do,

1:11:47.920 --> 1:11:50.960
 but think carefully about how often you're focusing

1:11:50.960 --> 1:11:53.680
 on something and how good you are or poor you are

1:11:53.680 --> 1:11:56.760
 at focusing on something that's challenging.

1:11:56.760 --> 1:11:58.800
 So once you get this epinephrine, this alertness,

1:11:58.800 --> 1:12:00.880
 you get the acetylcholine released

1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:03.060
 and you can focus your attention,

1:12:03.060 --> 1:12:04.640
 then the question is for how long?

1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:06.120
 And in an earlier podcast,

1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:07.880
 I talked about these ultradian cycles

1:12:07.880 --> 1:12:09.640
 that last about 90 minutes.

1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:12.680
 The typical learning bout should be about 90 minutes.

1:12:12.680 --> 1:12:16.560
 I think that learning bout will no doubt include

1:12:16.560 --> 1:12:18.560
 five to 10 minutes of warmup period.

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:20.820
 I think everyone should give themselves permission

1:12:20.820 --> 1:12:24.360
 to not be fully focused in the early part of that bout,

1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:26.240
 but that in the middle of that bout,

1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:27.220
 for the middle hour or so,

1:12:27.220 --> 1:12:28.840
 you should be able to maintain focus

1:12:28.840 --> 1:12:30.240
 for about an hour or so.

1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:32.880
 So that for me means eliminating distractions.

1:12:32.880 --> 1:12:34.720
 That means turning off the wifi.

1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:36.340
 I put my phone in the other room.

1:12:36.340 --> 1:12:39.540
 If I find myself reflexively getting up to get the phone,

1:12:39.540 --> 1:12:41.680
 I will take the phone and lock it in the car outside.

1:12:41.680 --> 1:12:43.860
 If I find myself going to get it anyway,

1:12:43.860 --> 1:12:48.520
 I am guilty of giving away the phone for a period of time

1:12:48.520 --> 1:12:50.840
 or even things more dramatic.

1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:52.700
 I've thrown it up on my roof before,

1:12:52.700 --> 1:12:54.720
 so I can't get to it till the end of the day.

1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:56.200
 That thing is pretty compelling.

1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:57.600
 And we come up with all sorts of reasons

1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:59.520
 why we need it to be in contact with it.

1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:03.240
 But I encourage you to try experiencing what it is

1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:05.380
 to be completely immersed in an activity

1:13:05.380 --> 1:13:06.840
 where you feel the agitation

1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:07.920
 that your attention is drifting,

1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:09.520
 but you continually bring it back.

1:13:09.520 --> 1:13:10.680
 And that's an important point,

1:13:10.680 --> 1:13:12.520
 which is that attention drifts,

1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:13.800
 but we have to re-anchor it.

1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:15.280
 We have to keep grabbing it back.

1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:17.000
 And the way to do that, if you're sighted,

1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:18.160
 is with your eyes.

1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:19.960
 That as your attention drifts and you look away,

1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:23.220
 you want to try and literally maintain visual focus

1:13:23.220 --> 1:13:24.600
 on the thing that you're trying to learn.

1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:26.180
 Feel free to blink, of course,

1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:28.720
 but you can greatly increase your powers of focus

1:13:28.720 --> 1:13:30.640
 and the rates of learning,

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:32.320
 which is anchored in all the work of Merzinek,

1:13:32.320 --> 1:13:34.540
 Hubel and Wiesel, and others.

1:13:34.540 --> 1:13:37.080
 Now that's the trigger for plasticity.

1:13:37.080 --> 1:13:41.720
 But the real secret is that neuroplasticity

1:13:41.720 --> 1:13:44.420
 doesn't occur during wakefulness.

1:13:44.420 --> 1:13:46.520
 It occurs during sleep.

1:13:46.520 --> 1:13:51.520
 We now know that if you focus very hard on something

1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.000
 for about 90 minutes or so,

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.120
 maybe you even do several bouts of that per day,

1:13:56.120 --> 1:13:58.600
 if you can do that, some people can,

1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:01.920
 some people can only do one focus bout of learning.

1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:04.760
 That night and the following nights while you sleep,

1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:07.720
 the neural circuits that were highlighted, if you will,

1:14:07.720 --> 1:14:10.600
 with acetylcholine transmission will strengthen

1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:12.720
 and other ones will be lost,

1:14:12.720 --> 1:14:15.760
 which is wonderful because that's the essence of plasticity.

1:14:15.760 --> 1:14:18.520
 And what it means is that when you eventually wake up

1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:19.680
 a couple of days or a week later,

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:22.520
 you will have acquired the knowledge forever,

1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:25.120
 unless you go through some process to actively unlearn it.

1:14:25.120 --> 1:14:27.720
 And we will talk about unlearning in a later episode.

1:14:29.400 --> 1:14:30.840
 So mastering sleep is key

1:14:30.840 --> 1:14:32.880
 in order to reinforce the learning that occurs.

1:14:32.880 --> 1:14:35.200
 But let's say you get a really poor night of sleep

1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:36.960
 after a bout of learning.

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:39.400
 Chances are if you sleep the next night

1:14:39.400 --> 1:14:42.480
 or the following night, that learning will occur.

1:14:42.480 --> 1:14:43.960
 There's a stamp in the brain

1:14:43.960 --> 1:14:45.560
 where this acetylcholine was released.

1:14:45.560 --> 1:14:48.540
 It actually marks those synapses neurochemically

1:14:48.540 --> 1:14:51.240
 and metabolically so that those synapses

1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:52.900
 are more biased to change.

1:14:52.900 --> 1:14:55.120
 Now, if you don't ever get that deep sleep,

1:14:55.120 --> 1:14:57.420
 then you probably won't get those changes.

1:14:57.420 --> 1:15:01.580
 But there's also a way in which you can bypass the need

1:15:01.580 --> 1:15:03.340
 for deep sleep, at least partially,

1:15:03.340 --> 1:15:06.580
 by engaging in what I call non-sleep deep rest,

1:15:06.580 --> 1:15:08.420
 these NSDR protocols.

1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:09.860
 But I just want to discuss the science of this.

1:15:09.860 --> 1:15:11.900
 There was a paper that was published

1:15:11.900 --> 1:15:14.260
 in Cell Reports last year

1:15:14.260 --> 1:15:16.100
 that shows that if people did,

1:15:16.100 --> 1:15:17.420
 it was a spatial memory task,

1:15:17.420 --> 1:15:18.660
 actually a quite difficult one

1:15:18.660 --> 1:15:20.340
 where they had to remember the sequence of lights

1:15:20.340 --> 1:15:21.380
 lighting up.

1:15:21.380 --> 1:15:22.900
 And if they're just two or three lights

1:15:22.900 --> 1:15:24.140
 in a particular sequence, it's easy.

1:15:24.140 --> 1:15:26.920
 But as you get up to 15 or 16 lights

1:15:26.920 --> 1:15:29.060
 and think numbers in the sequence,

1:15:29.060 --> 1:15:30.900
 it actually gets quite challenging.

1:15:30.900 --> 1:15:33.100
 If immediately after,

1:15:33.100 --> 1:15:35.020
 and it was immediately after the learning,

1:15:35.020 --> 1:15:37.040
 the actual performance of this task,

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:41.040
 people took a 20-minute non-sleep deep rest protocol,

1:15:42.540 --> 1:15:45.020
 or took a shallow nap,

1:15:45.020 --> 1:15:47.580
 so lying down, feet slightly elevated perhaps,

1:15:47.580 --> 1:15:50.380
 just closing their eyes, no sensory input,

1:15:50.380 --> 1:15:52.840
 the rates of learning were significantly higher

1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:54.120
 for that information

1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:57.180
 than were to just had a good night's sleep

1:15:57.180 --> 1:15:58.220
 the following night.

1:15:58.220 --> 1:15:59.860
 So you can actually accelerate learning

1:15:59.860 --> 1:16:01.420
 with these NSDR protocols

1:16:01.420 --> 1:16:04.220
 or with brief naps, 90 minutes or less.

1:16:04.220 --> 1:16:09.020
 So the key to plasticity in childhood is to be a child.

1:16:09.020 --> 1:16:11.340
 The key to plasticity in adulthood

1:16:11.340 --> 1:16:14.700
 is to engage alertness, engage focus,

1:16:14.700 --> 1:16:18.140
 and then to engage non-sleep deep rest

1:16:18.140 --> 1:16:22.760
 and deep sleep while you're in your typical bout of sleep.

1:16:22.760 --> 1:16:25.760
 I always get asked, how many bouts of learning

1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:26.600
 can I perform?

1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:28.940
 Well, I know people that train up

1:16:28.940 --> 1:16:31.080
 these visual focus mechanisms

1:16:31.080 --> 1:16:34.380
 to the point where they can do several 90-minute bouts

1:16:34.380 --> 1:16:36.780
 throughout the day, as many as three or four.

1:16:36.780 --> 1:16:38.100
 And some of them are also inserting

1:16:38.100 --> 1:16:40.160
 non-sleep deep rest as well.

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:41.540
 Now that can get pretty tricky.

1:16:41.540 --> 1:16:45.040
 A lot of people find that they can recover best

1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:48.860
 from these intense bouts of focused learning

1:16:48.860 --> 1:16:51.540
 by doing some motor activity,

1:16:51.540 --> 1:16:53.940
 where you get into self-generated optic flow.

1:16:53.940 --> 1:16:55.140
 And that should make sense

1:16:55.140 --> 1:16:56.820
 if you've ever heard me lecture about stress,

1:16:56.820 --> 1:16:59.060
 which I've done a little bit in various podcasts.

1:16:59.060 --> 1:17:01.380
 When we are in a mode of self-generated optic flow

1:17:01.380 --> 1:17:03.900
 like walking or running or cycling

1:17:03.900 --> 1:17:06.660
 and things are just floating past us on our retina,

1:17:06.660 --> 1:17:08.260
 we're not really looking anywhere in particular.

1:17:08.260 --> 1:17:10.980
 So this is the opposite of a tight window of focus.

1:17:10.980 --> 1:17:13.660
 When we do that, there are areas of the brain

1:17:13.660 --> 1:17:15.640
 like the amygdala, which are involved

1:17:15.640 --> 1:17:18.820
 in releasing epinephrine and create alertness.

1:17:18.820 --> 1:17:21.600
 At the extremes, it creates fear, but certainly alertness.

1:17:21.600 --> 1:17:22.840
 Those all shut down.

1:17:22.840 --> 1:17:25.920
 So it's its own form of non-sleep deep rest.

1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:29.580
 So some people find it much more pleasurable and practical

1:17:29.580 --> 1:17:33.300
 to engage in a focused bout of learning

1:17:33.300 --> 1:17:36.860
 and then go do some activity that involves

1:17:36.860 --> 1:17:38.500
 what we would essentially call wordlessness,

1:17:38.500 --> 1:17:40.180
 where you're not really thinking about much of anything.

1:17:40.180 --> 1:17:41.900
 And so for those of you that listen to audio books

1:17:41.900 --> 1:17:43.460
 or podcasts while you run,

1:17:43.460 --> 1:17:44.720
 you may want to consider whether or not

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:47.220
 that's how you want to spend your time.

1:17:47.220 --> 1:17:49.240
 Now, I'd love it if you were listening to this podcast

1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:52.340
 while you run or cycle, but I'm much more interested

1:17:52.340 --> 1:17:55.260
 in you actually getting the benefits of neuroplasticity

1:17:55.260 --> 1:17:58.100
 than just listening to me for sake of listening to me.

1:17:58.100 --> 1:18:02.540
 So for many people, letting the mind drift

1:18:02.540 --> 1:18:04.720
 where it's not organized in thought

1:18:04.720 --> 1:18:07.380
 after a period of very deliberate focused effort

1:18:07.380 --> 1:18:09.220
 is the best way to accelerate learning

1:18:09.220 --> 1:18:10.060
 and depth of learning.

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:11.280
 And there are good scientific data

1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:12.500
 to support these sorts of things,

1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:14.140
 including the cell reports paper

1:18:14.140 --> 1:18:16.300
 that I mentioned a few moments ago.

1:18:16.300 --> 1:18:18.180
 I want to synthesize some of the information

1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:20.460
 that we've covered up until now.

1:18:20.460 --> 1:18:23.220
 This entire month is about neuroplasticity.

1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:25.560
 Today's episode has covered a lot,

1:18:25.560 --> 1:18:29.240
 but by no means has it covered all of the potential

1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:32.460
 for neuroplasticity and protocols for plasticity.

1:18:32.460 --> 1:18:34.220
 We will get into all of it.

1:18:34.220 --> 1:18:37.520
 But today I want to make sure that these key elements

1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:40.020
 that form the backbone of neuroplasticity

1:18:40.020 --> 1:18:42.540
 are really embedded in people's minds.

1:18:42.540 --> 1:18:46.420
 First of all, plasticity occurs throughout the lifespan.

1:18:46.420 --> 1:18:49.580
 Early from birth until 25,

1:18:49.580 --> 1:18:54.300
 mere exposure to a sensory event can create plasticity.

1:18:54.300 --> 1:18:56.540
 That could be a good thing or a bad thing.

1:18:56.540 --> 1:18:58.700
 We're going to talk about unlearning the bad stuff,

1:18:58.700 --> 1:19:02.300
 traumas, et cetera, in a subsequent episode this month.

1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:08.880
 If you want to learn as an adult, you have to be alert.

1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:10.120
 It might seem so obvious,

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:12.640
 but I think a lot of people don't think about

1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:15.860
 when in their 24 hour cycle they're most alert.

1:19:17.320 --> 1:19:21.300
 There are four episodes devoted to that 24 hour cycle

1:19:21.300 --> 1:19:22.980
 and the cycles of alertness and sleep.

1:19:22.980 --> 1:19:24.100
 I encourage you to listen to those

1:19:24.100 --> 1:19:27.020
 if you haven't had the opportunity to yet,

1:19:27.020 --> 1:19:29.080
 or just ask yourself when during the day

1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:31.180
 do you typically tend to be most alert.

1:19:31.180 --> 1:19:33.940
 That will afford you an advantage

1:19:33.940 --> 1:19:36.900
 in learning specific things during that period of time.

1:19:36.900 --> 1:19:38.680
 So don't give up that period of time

1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:41.240
 for things that are meaningless, useless,

1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:43.020
 or not aligned with your goals.

1:19:43.020 --> 1:19:47.220
 That'd be a terrible time to get into passive observance

1:19:47.220 --> 1:19:51.220
 or just letting your time get soaked away by something.

1:19:51.220 --> 1:19:53.120
 That is a valuable asset.

1:19:53.120 --> 1:19:56.100
 That epinephrine released from your brainstem

1:19:57.300 --> 1:19:59.860
 is going to occur more readily at particular phases

1:19:59.860 --> 1:20:02.540
 of your 24 hour cycle than others,

1:20:02.540 --> 1:20:05.340
 during the waking phase, of course.

1:20:05.340 --> 1:20:07.620
 You should know when those are.

1:20:07.620 --> 1:20:10.180
 And then you could start to think about

1:20:10.180 --> 1:20:11.380
 the behavioral practices,

1:20:11.380 --> 1:20:13.940
 maybe the pharmacologic practices like caffeine,

1:20:13.940 --> 1:20:14.980
 hydration, et cetera,

1:20:14.980 --> 1:20:19.140
 that will support heightened levels of alertness.

1:20:19.140 --> 1:20:20.900
 Attention is something that can be learned

1:20:20.900 --> 1:20:25.260
 and attention is critical for creating that condition

1:20:25.260 --> 1:20:28.220
 where whatever it is that you are engaging in

1:20:28.220 --> 1:20:31.400
 will modify your brain in a way

1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:34.300
 that you won't have to spend so much attention on it

1:20:34.300 --> 1:20:35.140
 going forward.

1:20:35.140 --> 1:20:36.240
 That's the essence of plasticity,

1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:38.060
 that things will eventually become reflexive,

1:20:38.060 --> 1:20:39.600
 the language that you're learning,

1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:41.460
 the motor movement, the cognitive skill,

1:20:41.460 --> 1:20:44.500
 the ability to suppress an emotional response

1:20:44.500 --> 1:20:46.180
 or to engage in emotional response,

1:20:46.180 --> 1:20:47.620
 depending on what your goals are

1:20:47.620 --> 1:20:49.120
 and what's appropriate for you.

1:20:50.180 --> 1:20:52.660
 Increasing acetylcholine can be accomplished

1:20:52.660 --> 1:20:54.740
 pharmacologically through nicotine.

1:20:54.740 --> 1:20:57.020
 However, there are certain dangers

1:20:57.020 --> 1:20:58.920
 for many people to do that,

1:20:58.920 --> 1:21:01.860
 as well as a cost, a financial cost.

1:21:03.220 --> 1:21:05.580
 Learning how to engage the cholinergic system

1:21:05.580 --> 1:21:07.060
 through the use of the visual system.

1:21:07.060 --> 1:21:10.000
 Practicing how long can you maintain focus

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.080
 with blanks as you need them,

1:21:12.960 --> 1:21:16.940
 but how long can you maintain visual focus on a target,

1:21:16.940 --> 1:21:20.260
 just on a piece of paper set a few feet away in the room

1:21:20.260 --> 1:21:21.980
 or at the level of your computer screen.

1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:24.440
 These are actually things that people do in communities

1:21:24.440 --> 1:21:27.560
 where high levels of visual focus are necessary.

1:21:27.560 --> 1:21:29.460
 Now, the other way to get high levels of visual focus

1:21:29.460 --> 1:21:31.220
 and alertness is to have a panic

1:21:31.220 --> 1:21:33.900
 or to have a situation that's very, very bad.

1:21:33.900 --> 1:21:35.980
 You will be immediately focused on everything

1:21:35.980 --> 1:21:39.620
 related to that situation, but that's unfortunate.

1:21:39.620 --> 1:21:40.860
 What we're really talking about here

1:21:40.860 --> 1:21:43.500
 is trying to harness the mechanisms of attention

1:21:43.500 --> 1:21:45.540
 and get better at paying attention.

1:21:45.540 --> 1:21:47.220
 You may want to do that with your auditory system,

1:21:47.220 --> 1:21:48.900
 not with your visual system,

1:21:48.900 --> 1:21:51.300
 either because you're low vision or no vision,

1:21:51.300 --> 1:21:52.640
 or because you're trying to learn something

1:21:52.640 --> 1:21:54.620
 that relates more to sounds than to what you see.

1:21:54.620 --> 1:21:55.920
 But for most people,

1:21:55.920 --> 1:21:58.140
 they're trying to learn information, cognitive information,

1:21:58.140 --> 1:22:00.780
 or they're trying to learn how to hear the nuance

1:22:00.780 --> 1:22:02.940
 in their partner's explanations

1:22:02.940 --> 1:22:05.820
 of their emotionally challenging events, et cetera.

1:22:05.820 --> 1:22:08.040
 And just remember, by the way, what I said earlier,

1:22:08.040 --> 1:22:11.180
 which is that if you really want somebody to listen to you

1:22:11.180 --> 1:22:14.500
 and really hear what you're saying and what's underlying it,

1:22:14.500 --> 1:22:16.740
 you should not and cannot expect them

1:22:16.740 --> 1:22:18.300
 to look directly at you while you do that.

1:22:18.300 --> 1:22:20.620
 That's actually going to limit their ability to focus.

1:22:20.620 --> 1:22:22.180
 I'm trying to rescue a few folks out there

1:22:22.180 --> 1:22:24.340
 who might be in this struggle.

1:22:24.340 --> 1:22:26.540
 I, of course, have never been in this struggle.

1:22:28.180 --> 1:22:30.420
 And that was supposed to be a joke.

1:22:30.420 --> 1:22:32.940
 I'm very familiar with that struggle.

1:22:32.940 --> 1:22:35.420
 But I know that one can get better at listening.

1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:37.180
 One can get better at learning.

1:22:37.180 --> 1:22:39.700
 One can get better at all sorts of things

1:22:39.700 --> 1:22:42.080
 by anchoring in these mechanisms.

1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:44.600
 Now, of course, you can also combine protocols.

1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:48.380
 You can decide to combine pharmacology

1:22:48.380 --> 1:22:50.680
 with these learning practices.

1:22:50.680 --> 1:22:53.320
 Many people in communities do that.

1:22:53.320 --> 1:22:55.040
 Many people are doing that naturally

1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:58.260
 by drinking their coffee right before they do their learning.

1:22:58.260 --> 1:23:00.620
 But I would also encourage you to think about

1:23:00.620 --> 1:23:02.180
 how long those learning bouts are.

1:23:02.180 --> 1:23:06.780
 If you think you have an ADD or ADHD,

1:23:06.780 --> 1:23:09.240
 see a clinician, but you should also ask yourself,

1:23:09.240 --> 1:23:11.200
 are you giving up the best period of focus

1:23:11.200 --> 1:23:13.060
 that you have each day naturally

1:23:13.060 --> 1:23:16.400
 to some other thing like social media

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:19.060
 or some other activity that doesn't serve you well?

1:23:19.060 --> 1:23:22.860
 Or are you devoting that period to the opportunity to learn?

1:23:23.740 --> 1:23:25.180
 You should also ask yourself

1:23:25.180 --> 1:23:27.640
 whether or not you're trying to focus too much

1:23:27.640 --> 1:23:29.360
 for too long during the day.

1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:33.300
 I know some very high-performing individuals,

1:23:33.300 --> 1:23:36.060
 very high-performing in a variety of contexts,

1:23:36.060 --> 1:23:37.940
 and none of them are focused all day long.

1:23:37.940 --> 1:23:40.140
 Many of them take walks down the hallway,

1:23:40.140 --> 1:23:41.420
 sometimes mumbling to themselves

1:23:41.420 --> 1:23:42.920
 or not paying attention to anything else.

1:23:42.920 --> 1:23:45.080
 They go for bike rides, they take walks.

1:23:45.080 --> 1:23:47.380
 They are not trying to engage their mind

1:23:47.380 --> 1:23:49.840
 at maximum focus all the time.

1:23:49.840 --> 1:23:53.300
 Very few people do that because we learn best

1:23:53.300 --> 1:23:54.580
 in these 90-minute bouts

1:23:54.580 --> 1:23:56.660
 inside of one of these ultradian cycles.

1:23:56.660 --> 1:23:58.260
 And I should repeat again

1:23:58.260 --> 1:23:59.760
 that within that 90-minute cycle,

1:23:59.760 --> 1:24:01.320
 you should not expect yourself to focus

1:24:01.320 --> 1:24:03.340
 for the entire period of one 90-minute cycle.

1:24:03.340 --> 1:24:04.380
 At the beginning and end

1:24:04.380 --> 1:24:06.820
 are going to be a little bit flickering in and out of focus.

1:24:06.820 --> 1:24:09.020
 How do you know when one of these 90-minute cycles

1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:10.460
 is starting?

1:24:10.460 --> 1:24:11.500
 Well, typically when you wake up

1:24:11.500 --> 1:24:13.100
 is the beginning of the first 90-minute cycle,

1:24:13.100 --> 1:24:14.780
 but it's not down to the minute.

1:24:14.780 --> 1:24:17.100
 You'll be able to tap into your sense

1:24:17.100 --> 1:24:18.180
 of these 90-minute cycles

1:24:18.180 --> 1:24:20.860
 as you start to engage in these learning practices

1:24:20.860 --> 1:24:22.420
 should you choose.

1:24:22.420 --> 1:24:24.820
 And then of course, getting some non-sleep deep rest

1:24:24.820 --> 1:24:27.020
 or just deliberate disengagement

1:24:27.020 --> 1:24:30.040
 such as walking or running

1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:34.380
 or just sitting eyes closed or eyes open kind of mindlessly,

1:24:34.380 --> 1:24:35.520
 it might seem in a chair,

1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:36.860
 just letting your thoughts move around

1:24:36.860 --> 1:24:39.540
 after a learning bout will accelerate

1:24:39.540 --> 1:24:40.740
 the rate of plasticity

1:24:40.740 --> 1:24:43.460
 that's been shown in quality peer-reviewed studies.

1:24:44.980 --> 1:24:46.820
 And then of course, deep sleep.

1:24:46.820 --> 1:24:49.860
 And so what we can start to see is that

1:24:49.860 --> 1:24:54.860
 plasticity is your natural right early in life,

1:24:55.260 --> 1:24:57.820
 but after about age 25,

1:24:57.820 --> 1:25:00.420
 you have to do some work in order to access it.

1:25:00.420 --> 1:25:03.260
 But fortunately, these beautiful experiments

1:25:03.260 --> 1:25:06.340
 of Hubel and Wiesel and Merzenich and Weinberger and others

1:25:06.340 --> 1:25:08.980
 point in the direction of what allows us

1:25:08.980 --> 1:25:10.180
 to achieve plasticity.

1:25:10.180 --> 1:25:12.620
 It points to the neurochemicals and the circuits.

1:25:12.620 --> 1:25:14.800
 And we now have behavioral protocols

1:25:14.800 --> 1:25:16.060
 that allow us to do that.

1:25:16.060 --> 1:25:19.700
 I also really want to emphasize

1:25:19.700 --> 1:25:23.740
 that there's an entire other aspect of behavioral practices

1:25:23.740 --> 1:25:26.220
 that will allow us to engage in plasticity

1:25:26.220 --> 1:25:29.880
 that don't involve intense focus and emotionality,

1:25:29.880 --> 1:25:32.620
 but involve a lot of repetition.

1:25:32.620 --> 1:25:35.900
 So there's another entire category of plasticity

1:25:35.900 --> 1:25:40.100
 that involves doing what seemed like almost mundane things,

1:25:40.100 --> 1:25:44.140
 but doing them over and over again repeatedly

1:25:44.140 --> 1:25:47.140
 and incorporating the reward system that involves dopamine.

1:25:47.140 --> 1:25:49.140
 So today I talked about the kind of plasticity

1:25:49.140 --> 1:25:50.740
 that comes from extreme focus.

1:25:50.740 --> 1:25:53.460
 You would get that extreme focus and alertness naturally

1:25:53.460 --> 1:25:56.260
 through a hard or difficult event that you didn't want.

1:25:56.260 --> 1:25:57.500
 That's the kind of stinger,

1:25:57.500 --> 1:25:59.100
 but your brain is designed to keep you safe.

1:25:59.100 --> 1:26:01.180
 So it wants to get one trial learning

1:26:01.180 --> 1:26:02.980
 from things like touching a hot stove

1:26:02.980 --> 1:26:05.360
 or engaging with a really horrible person.

1:26:07.980 --> 1:26:12.380
 You can get incredible plasticity of positive experiences

1:26:12.380 --> 1:26:15.980
 of things that you want by engaging this high focus regime

1:26:15.980 --> 1:26:18.420
 and then rest, non-sleep deep rest and sleep.

1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:21.540
 And there's another aspect of plasticity

1:26:21.540 --> 1:26:24.380
 which we will explore next episode

1:26:24.380 --> 1:26:27.980
 as well as when we explore movement-based practices

1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:32.540
 for enhancing plasticity and plasticity of movement itself.

1:26:32.540 --> 1:26:35.860
 And those are not of the high attention,

1:26:35.860 --> 1:26:37.540
 kind of high emotionality

1:26:37.540 --> 1:26:42.340
 or the intensity of the experiences that I described today,

1:26:42.340 --> 1:26:45.940
 those are more about repetition and reward and repeat,

1:26:45.940 --> 1:26:47.780
 repetition, reward, repeat.

1:26:47.780 --> 1:26:51.380
 And they are used for a distinctly different category

1:26:51.380 --> 1:26:54.640
 of behavioral change, more of which relate to habits

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:58.720
 as opposed to learning of particular types of information

1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:03.720
 that allow us to perform physically, cognitively

1:27:04.180 --> 1:27:06.580
 or adjust our emotional system.

1:27:06.580 --> 1:27:07.420
 So I'm going to stop there.

1:27:07.420 --> 1:27:09.700
 I'm sure there are a lot of questions.

1:27:09.700 --> 1:27:11.940
 Please put your questions in the comment section below

1:27:11.940 --> 1:27:13.920
 and please remember that this entire month

1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:16.100
 we're going to be exploring neuroplasticity.

1:27:16.100 --> 1:27:20.420
 So this discussion slash lecture,

1:27:20.420 --> 1:27:21.900
 I wish it was more of a back and forth

1:27:21.900 --> 1:27:24.640
 but this is what the format offers us.

1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:27.340
 So please do put your questions in the comment section

1:27:27.340 --> 1:27:30.460
 and I will address them in the other episodes coming soon

1:27:30.460 --> 1:27:32.440
 on neuroplasticity.

1:27:32.440 --> 1:27:35.620
 As I say that, I'm reminded that many of you

1:27:35.620 --> 1:27:38.660
 are listening to this on Apple or Spotify

1:27:38.660 --> 1:27:42.020
 and therefore there isn't an opportunity to leave comments

1:27:42.020 --> 1:27:44.780
 aside from the rating section on Apple.

1:27:44.780 --> 1:27:48.320
 So if you have specific topics related to neuroplasticity

1:27:48.320 --> 1:27:49.660
 that you would like me to cover

1:27:49.660 --> 1:27:51.800
 in the subsequent episodes this month,

1:27:51.800 --> 1:27:54.660
 please go to the YouTube, subscribe,

1:27:54.660 --> 1:27:57.080
 but as well, please put your question

1:27:57.080 --> 1:27:58.820
 in the comment section for this episode

1:27:58.820 --> 1:28:01.680
 and I'll be sure to read them and respond.

1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:03.540
 Many of you have very graciously asked

1:28:03.540 --> 1:28:06.700
 how you can help support the Huberman Lab Podcast.

1:28:06.700 --> 1:28:10.300
 Best way to do that is to subscribe on YouTube.

1:28:10.300 --> 1:28:12.380
 You might want to also hit the notification button

1:28:12.380 --> 1:28:15.420

1:28:15.420 --> 1:28:16.660
 Leave a comment.

1:28:16.660 --> 1:28:18.200
 As well, if you go to Apple,

1:28:18.200 --> 1:28:20.140
 you can give us a five-star rating

1:28:20.140 --> 1:28:23.180
 and there's a place there where also you can leave a comment

1:28:23.180 --> 1:28:24.940
 and if you prefer to listen on Spotify,

1:28:24.940 --> 1:28:27.420
 subscribe and download on Spotify.

1:28:27.420 --> 1:28:30.500
 In addition, it's always helpful if you recommend the podcast

1:28:30.500 --> 1:28:32.260
 to your friends and family and others

1:28:32.260 --> 1:28:34.980
 who you think might benefit from the information

1:28:34.980 --> 1:28:38.000
 and as well, please check out our sponsors.

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.020
 That's a great way to help us.

1:28:40.020 --> 1:28:42.140
 Today and in previous episodes,

1:28:42.140 --> 1:28:44.700
 I've talked a number of times about supplements.

1:28:44.700 --> 1:28:46.260
 I'm very pleased that we're partnering

1:28:46.260 --> 1:28:49.820
 with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E supplements

1:28:49.820 --> 1:28:53.140
 because Thorne has the very high levels of stringency

1:28:53.140 --> 1:28:56.180
 in terms of product quality and precision

1:28:56.180 --> 1:28:59.900
 about how much of given supplements are in the bottle,

1:28:59.900 --> 1:29:02.620
 which is vital and not all supplement companies

1:29:02.620 --> 1:29:05.320
 have stood up to the test on that one.

1:29:05.320 --> 1:29:08.560
 If you wanna check out Thorne and go to Thorne,

1:29:08.560 --> 1:29:13.560
 that's thorne.com slash U slash Huberman

1:29:13.820 --> 1:29:14.960
 and if you do that,

1:29:14.960 --> 1:29:18.460
 you'll get 20% off any supplements that you purchase.

1:29:18.460 --> 1:29:21.640
 I've also listed there a gallery of supplements that I take

1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:23.320
 including magnesium glycinate.

1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:24.820
 I know in previous episodes,

1:29:24.820 --> 1:29:27.840
 I talked about magnesium threonate as a sleep aid

1:29:27.840 --> 1:29:28.800
 that I take.

1:29:28.800 --> 1:29:31.540
 Magnesium glycinate and magnesium threonate

1:29:31.540 --> 1:29:33.820
 are essentially interchangeable.

1:29:33.820 --> 1:29:35.300
 Thanks so much for your time and attention

1:29:35.300 --> 1:29:36.520
 and as always,

1:29:36.520 --> 1:29:38.260
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:29:38.260 --> 1:30:03.260
 I'll see you in the next one.
