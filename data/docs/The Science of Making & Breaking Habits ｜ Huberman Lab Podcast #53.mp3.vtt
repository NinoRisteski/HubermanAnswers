00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.920
 for everyday life.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.640
 I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology

00:11.640 --> 00:14.580
 and ophthalmology at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.940
 Today, we're talking all about habits.

00:16.940 --> 00:20.200
 In particular, we're going to discuss the biology

00:20.200 --> 00:24.760
 of habit formation and the biology of how we break habits.

00:24.760 --> 00:28.420
 I think we can all appreciate the value of having habits.

00:28.420 --> 00:30.720
 Habits organize our behavior into more or less

00:30.720 --> 00:33.500
 reflexive actions, so we don't have to think too much

00:33.500 --> 00:37.120
 about performing the various behaviors that, for instance,

00:37.120 --> 00:40.360
 allow us to brush our teeth or which side of bed

00:40.360 --> 00:41.880
 we roll out of in the morning.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.440
 And then of course, habits can be more elaborate too.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.060
 We can be in the habit of exercising

00:46.060 --> 00:47.520
 at a particular time of day.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.200
 We can be in the habit of eating certain foods.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.560
 We can be in the habit of saying

00:50.560 --> 00:52.720
 or not saying certain things.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.460
 But of course, there are many habits

00:54.460 --> 00:57.760
 that don't serve us well, or that perhaps even undermine

00:57.760 --> 01:00.080
 our immediate and long-term health goals

01:00.080 --> 01:02.660
 and psychological goals, and even some habits

01:02.660 --> 01:05.440
 that can really undermine our overall life goals.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.640
 So today, we're going to talk about making,

01:07.640 --> 01:09.560
 meaning forming, and breaking,

01:09.560 --> 01:11.960
 meaning stopping various habits.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.720
 There's a lot of information out there about habits.

01:14.720 --> 01:16.220
 You'll find this in the popular sphere.

01:16.220 --> 01:17.740
 There are books, there are articles,

01:17.740 --> 01:19.780
 there are workshops, and so forth.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.800
 However, lesser known is that there's a whole neuroscience

01:22.800 --> 01:24.800
 of habit formation and habit breaking,

01:24.800 --> 01:26.280
 and there's a whole field of psychology

01:26.280 --> 01:28.840
 devoted to understanding habit formation

01:28.840 --> 01:30.120
 and habit breaking.

01:30.120 --> 01:32.360
 And within those scientific literatures,

01:32.360 --> 01:34.180
 I think there are some real gems

01:34.180 --> 01:35.400
 that at least to my knowledge,

01:35.400 --> 01:37.000
 we haven't paid too much attention to

01:37.000 --> 01:38.500
 in the popular sphere.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.320
 So today, we're going to talk about the biology

01:40.320 --> 01:42.360
 of habit formation and habit breaking.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.040
 I'm also going to spell out two specific types

01:45.040 --> 01:47.880
 of habit formation and habit breaking programs.

01:47.880 --> 01:51.240
 I'm going to boil these down to some very explicit steps

01:51.240 --> 01:53.280
 that anyone can use.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.560
 My reasoning for doing that is, first of all,

01:55.560 --> 01:57.640
 it's the end of 2021.

01:57.640 --> 01:59.680
 Many people are thinking about New Year's resolutions.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.120
 They're thinking about leaving some things behind

02:02.120 --> 02:05.160
 from 2021 and previous,

02:05.160 --> 02:07.580
 and acquiring some new behaviors,

02:07.580 --> 02:08.920
 taking on some new challenges

02:08.920 --> 02:10.700
 and trying to bring new things to their lives.

02:10.700 --> 02:13.100
 But regardless of when you're listening to this,

02:13.100 --> 02:14.760
 the programs that I'll outline

02:14.760 --> 02:16.200
 are grounded in the neuroscience

02:16.200 --> 02:18.040
 and biology of habit formation,

02:18.040 --> 02:20.280
 and they map very well to what the psychologists

02:20.280 --> 02:23.080
 have described in terms of habit formation and breaking.

02:23.080 --> 02:24.560
 So today, you're going to learn a lot of science.

02:24.560 --> 02:26.720
 You're also going to come away with some practical tools,

02:26.720 --> 02:28.800
 and I'm certain that regardless of your present state

02:28.800 --> 02:31.480
 or goals, there'll be something of value to you.

02:31.480 --> 02:33.080
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize

02:33.080 --> 02:34.840
 that this podcast is separate from my teaching

02:34.840 --> 02:36.560
 and research roles at Stanford.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.360
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

02:38.360 --> 02:40.840
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

02:40.840 --> 02:43.380
 and science-related tools to the general public.

02:43.380 --> 02:44.280
 In keeping with that theme,

02:44.280 --> 02:46.880
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.080
 Our first sponsor is Athletic Greens.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.480
 Athletic Greens is an all-in-one

02:50.480 --> 02:52.640
 vitamin mineral probiotic drink.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.160
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,

02:55.160 --> 02:57.660
 so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.

02:57.660 --> 02:59.220
 The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,

02:59.220 --> 03:01.320
 and the reason I still take Athletic Greens

03:01.320 --> 03:03.560
 is that because of the ingredients it contains,

03:03.560 --> 03:05.840
 I know that I'm covering all of my foundational needs

03:05.840 --> 03:08.220
 for vitamins, minerals, and probiotics.

03:08.220 --> 03:10.900
 There is a wealth of knowledge now pointing to the fact

03:10.900 --> 03:13.540
 that the so-called gut-brain axis is important

03:13.540 --> 03:16.240
 for our brain health, for our metabolic health,

03:16.240 --> 03:18.520
 for our hormone health, for our immune system,

03:18.520 --> 03:20.240
 so the probiotics, vitamins, and minerals

03:20.240 --> 03:21.720
 really support that system,

03:21.720 --> 03:24.000
 and many of the other things it contains

03:24.000 --> 03:27.120
 generally support our health in terms of neural system,

03:27.120 --> 03:29.520
 meaning the brain, the spinal cord, et cetera.

03:29.520 --> 03:32.120
 Basically, Athletic Greens has all the things I need,

03:32.120 --> 03:35.260
 nothing I don't, and by taking it once or twice a day,

03:35.260 --> 03:36.220
 I always feel better,

03:36.220 --> 03:38.920
 and I know that I'm covering all my bases.

03:38.920 --> 03:40.320
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

03:40.320 --> 03:43.200

 while you're on the road, in the car,

03:49.120 --> 03:50.440
 on the plane, et cetera,

03:50.440 --> 03:53.080
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.880
 Again, go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

03:55.880 --> 03:58.340
 to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs

03:58.340 --> 04:01.360
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3 and K2.

04:01.360 --> 04:04.620
 Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.

04:04.620 --> 04:07.080
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:07.080 --> 04:09.640
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

04:09.640 --> 04:11.240
 to help you better understand your body

04:11.240 --> 04:13.160
 and help you reach your health goals.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.040
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

04:16.040 --> 04:18.680
 for the simple reason that most of the factors

04:18.680 --> 04:20.720
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

04:20.720 --> 04:23.160
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.520
 And nowadays with the advent of modern DNA tests,

04:25.520 --> 04:28.660
 you can also get insights into your particular needs

04:28.660 --> 04:31.080
 for your genetic type.

04:31.080 --> 04:33.280
 Now, a major issue with a lot of blood tests

04:33.280 --> 04:35.360
 and DNA tests out there is you get the numbers back,

04:35.360 --> 04:36.540
 you get a lot of information back,

04:36.540 --> 04:38.560
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.360
 Inside Tracker makes that very easy.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.600
 They have a personalized platform

04:42.600 --> 04:43.860
 where you get your numbers

04:43.860 --> 04:45.760
 and it points to specific things that you can do

04:45.760 --> 04:47.340
 in terms of behavioral protocols,

04:47.340 --> 04:50.560
 meaning things you perhaps should do more of or less of,

04:50.560 --> 04:51.660
 nutritional protocols,

04:51.660 --> 04:54.600
 things that you perhaps should ingest more of or less of,

04:54.600 --> 04:56.400
 and various things that you might consider

04:56.400 --> 04:58.640
 for more elaborate directed approaches

04:58.640 --> 05:02.040
 to adjusting the numbers in your blood and DNA profiles.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.320
 Another feature of Inside Tracker

05:03.320 --> 05:05.520
 is that it has what's called the inner age test.

05:05.520 --> 05:07.720
 This test allows you to see what your biological age

05:07.720 --> 05:09.720
 and compare that to your chronological age.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.240
 And of course, your biological age

05:11.240 --> 05:12.800
 is the one that you can control,

05:12.800 --> 05:14.240
 and that's the one that's really important

05:14.240 --> 05:16.160
 to your immediate and long-term health.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.540
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

05:17.540 --> 05:20.440
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:20.440 --> 05:23.520

05:23.520 --> 05:27.600
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 25% off.

05:27.600 --> 05:30.600
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Helix Sleep.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.720
 Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows

05:32.720 --> 05:36.200
 that I truly believe are the best out there.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.040
 I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress for about a year now,

05:39.040 --> 05:41.160
 and it's the best sleep I've ever had.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.740
 One thing that makes Helix mattresses really unique

05:43.740 --> 05:46.480
 is that they are tailored to your unique sleep needs.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.220
 You can go to their website, you take a quiz,

05:48.220 --> 05:49.720
 it only takes about two minutes,

05:49.720 --> 05:52.660
 and it will match your body type and sleep preferences

05:52.660 --> 05:54.060
 to a particular mattress.

05:54.060 --> 05:55.460
 So it will ask you questions such as,

05:55.460 --> 05:58.040
 do you sleep on your side, your back, or your stomach?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.680
 Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?

05:59.680 --> 06:01.240
 Maybe you don't know.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.920
 You answer those questions and it matches you

06:02.920 --> 06:04.640
 to the mattress that's right for you.

06:04.640 --> 06:07.600
 For me, that turned out to be the Dusk mattress, D-U-S-K.

06:07.600 --> 06:09.960
 I wanted a mattress that wasn't too firm, not too soft.

06:09.960 --> 06:11.520
 Anyway, I matched to the Dusk.

06:11.520 --> 06:12.800
 I've been sleeping on a Dusk mattress,

06:12.800 --> 06:14.440
 and as I mentioned before,

06:14.440 --> 06:16.040
 it's been the best experience for me.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.020
 My sleep is so improved.

06:18.020 --> 06:19.580
 So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,

06:19.580 --> 06:21.880
 go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

06:21.880 --> 06:23.160
 take their two-minute sleep quiz,

06:23.160 --> 06:25.440
 and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you,

06:25.440 --> 06:28.320
 and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders

06:28.320 --> 06:29.720
 and two free pillows.

06:29.720 --> 06:32.280
 Again, go to helixsleep.com slash Huberman,

06:32.280 --> 06:34.280
 take their quiz, match to the mattress

06:34.280 --> 06:36.140
 that's right for you, and if you decide to purchase it,

06:36.140 --> 06:38.960
 you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders

06:38.960 --> 06:40.160
 and two free pillows.

06:40.160 --> 06:41.680
 They have a 10-year warranty,

06:41.680 --> 06:43.000
 and if you want to try it out,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.060
 you can do that for 100 nights risk-free.

06:45.060 --> 06:46.320
 They'll even pick the mattress up for you

06:46.320 --> 06:47.160
 if you don't love it,

06:47.160 --> 06:49.240
 but I'm pretty confident that you will.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.040
 Again, helixsleep.com slash Huberman

06:52.040 --> 06:54.120
 is where you'll find a Helix mattress for you.

06:54.120 --> 06:55.800
 Let's talk about habits,

06:55.800 --> 06:57.640
 and anytime we're talking about habits,

06:57.640 --> 07:01.120
 that means our nervous system learns something.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.840
 Now, many people think that habits are just like reflexes,

07:04.840 --> 07:08.280
 but pure reflexes are things like the eye blink reflex.

07:08.280 --> 07:09.640
 You know, something comes toward your eye

07:09.640 --> 07:11.540
 and you don't want it to get in your eye.

07:11.540 --> 07:14.880
 You'll blink, or if you happen to step on a sharp object

07:14.880 --> 07:17.200
 or get too close to something that's too hot,

07:17.200 --> 07:18.920
 you'll reflexively move away.

07:18.920 --> 07:19.840
 Those aren't habits.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.200
 Those are what we call hardwired reflexes.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.560
 Habits are things that our nervous system learned,

07:26.560 --> 07:27.900
 but not always consciously.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.160
 Sometimes we develop habits that we're not even aware of

07:31.160 --> 07:32.360
 until they become a problem,

07:32.360 --> 07:34.980
 or maybe they serve us well, who knows?

07:34.980 --> 07:36.340
 But the fact of the matter is

07:36.340 --> 07:39.280
 that habits are a big part of who we are.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.420
 What we do habitually makes up much of what we do entirely.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.820
 In fact, it's estimated that up to 70%

07:45.820 --> 07:50.480
 of our waking behavior is made up of habitual behavior.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.580
 So you can imagine that there's a lot of biology,

07:53.580 --> 07:56.860
 meaning cells and hormones and neural pathways, et cetera,

07:56.860 --> 07:59.720
 that are going to support the development of those habits.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.440
 So if habits are largely learned,

08:01.440 --> 08:04.120
 consciously or unconsciously,

08:04.120 --> 08:06.240
 we have to ask ourselves, what is learning?

08:06.240 --> 08:08.900
 Well, learning is neuroplasticity.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.400
 Neuroplasticity is simply the process

08:11.400 --> 08:13.260
 by which our nervous system changes

08:13.260 --> 08:15.240
 in response to experience.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.960
 We have to ask, what changes?

08:16.960 --> 08:19.840
 Well, what changes are the connections between neurons.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.240
 Neurons are just nerve cells.

08:21.240 --> 08:23.680
 They communicate with one another by electricity

08:23.680 --> 08:26.080
 and by sending chemical signals to one another

08:26.080 --> 08:28.640
 that inspire the next neuron and the next neuron

08:28.640 --> 08:31.280
 to either be electrically active or not.

08:31.280 --> 08:32.240
 But at the end of the day,

08:32.240 --> 08:35.440
 neuroplasticity is about forming new neural circuits,

08:35.440 --> 08:38.660
 new pathways by which certain habits are likely to occur

08:38.660 --> 08:41.300
 and other ones are less likely to occur.

08:41.300 --> 08:43.040
 So we've got habits.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.600
 We have that habits are learned.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.640
 We have that learning involves neuroplasticity

08:46.640 --> 08:48.640
 and that neuroplasticity involves changes

08:48.640 --> 08:51.140
 in the connections between neurons, nerve cells.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.920
 Okay, so that describes habits

08:52.920 --> 08:55.920
 through the lens of neuroscience and biology.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.160
 But as many of you are well aware,

08:58.160 --> 08:59.880
 there are popular books about habits

08:59.880 --> 09:03.080
 and there's a whole psychological literature about habits.

09:03.080 --> 09:07.060
 And those two areas point to some very interesting aspects

09:07.060 --> 09:09.120
 of habits that I think are worth mentioning.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.600
 First of all, is this notion of immediate goal-based habits

09:13.600 --> 09:16.440
 versus identity-based habits.

09:16.440 --> 09:18.720
 Immediate goal-based habits are going to be habits

09:18.720 --> 09:22.040
 that are designed to bring you a specific outcome

09:22.040 --> 09:22.880
 as you do them.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.600
 So each and every time you do them.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.240
 So for instance, it might be that you want to develop

09:27.240 --> 09:32.240
 a habit of getting 60 minutes of zone two cardio each day

09:33.400 --> 09:35.660
 or perhaps three, four times a week

09:35.660 --> 09:36.880
 as we head into the new year.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.600
 I've talked before on the podcast

09:38.600 --> 09:40.480
 about the fact that the scientific literature

09:40.480 --> 09:41.880
 and the health literature really points

09:41.880 --> 09:44.200
 to the incredibly positive effects

09:44.200 --> 09:48.440
 of getting 150 minutes to 180 minutes per week minimum

09:48.440 --> 09:50.280
 of what's called zone two cardio.

09:50.280 --> 09:54.140
 Zone two cardio is basically any cardiovascular exercise

09:54.140 --> 09:56.760
 that gets you moving and your heart pumping and breathing

09:56.760 --> 09:59.200
 but not so hard that you can't hold a conversation.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.800
 As it kind of puts you at the threshold

10:00.800 --> 10:02.860
 of being just able to have a conversation

10:02.860 --> 10:03.980
 that's a little bit strained.

10:03.980 --> 10:05.980
 But if you were to exercise a little bit harder,

10:05.980 --> 10:08.120
 you know, run a little bit faster, et cetera,

10:08.120 --> 10:10.600
 you wouldn't be able to talk while you did it.

10:10.600 --> 10:11.880
 There's a lot of literature that points

10:11.880 --> 10:13.680
 to that as a healthy practice.

10:13.680 --> 10:16.120
 So maybe you're somebody that wants to get more

10:16.120 --> 10:18.840
 of zone two cardio, for instance.

10:18.840 --> 10:21.880
 That would be an immediate goal-based habit.

10:21.880 --> 10:26.880
 If your goal is to get that cardio maybe four times a week,

10:27.280 --> 10:29.240
 every time you do it, you could check off a little box

10:29.240 --> 10:32.520
 and you'd say, okay, I did it, you met the goal.

10:32.520 --> 10:36.080
 That is different than so-called identity-based habits

10:36.080 --> 10:39.560
 where there's a larger overarching theme to the habit

10:39.560 --> 10:42.780
 where you're trying to become quote unquote, a fit person,

10:42.780 --> 10:46.200
 or you're somebody who wants to be an athlete

10:46.200 --> 10:47.160
 or something of that sort.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.760
 It's where you start to attach some sort of larger picture

10:49.760 --> 10:53.320
 about yourself or what it means for you to do that habit

10:53.320 --> 10:56.320
 where there's both the immediate goal, right?

10:56.320 --> 10:58.960
 Complete the exercise, complete the session

10:58.960 --> 11:01.540
 or whatever it is, check off that box,

11:01.540 --> 11:03.880
 but that you're linking it to some sort of larger goal.

11:03.880 --> 11:05.360
 Now, why am I making this distinction?

11:05.360 --> 11:06.300
 I mean, first of all,

11:06.300 --> 11:08.200
 I'm not the one to first make this distinction.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.360
 Others have made the distinction between identity

11:10.360 --> 11:12.900
 versus immediate goal-based habit formation.

11:12.900 --> 11:14.680
 But the reason I'm making the distinction is that pretty

11:14.680 --> 11:16.360
 soon in our discussion today,

11:16.360 --> 11:18.460
 we are going to talk about dopamine,

11:18.460 --> 11:22.240
 a molecule that's associated with motivation and reward

11:22.240 --> 11:26.680
 that we make in our brain and how different schedules

11:26.680 --> 11:29.960
 of dopamine release predict whether or not we will stick

11:29.960 --> 11:31.800
 to a habit or not.

11:31.800 --> 11:33.520
 And in particular, whether or not we will be able

11:33.520 --> 11:36.420
 to form that habit quickly or not.

11:36.420 --> 11:39.320
 Now, this is absolutely critical to understand

11:39.320 --> 11:40.800
 for the following reason.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.940
 Another thing that you'll hear out there in the literature

11:42.940 --> 11:45.280
 is that it takes 21 days to form a habit.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.640
 Some people say 18, some people say 21,

11:47.640 --> 11:50.440
 some people say 30 days, some people say 60 days.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.300
 So which one is it?

11:51.300 --> 11:53.500
 Does it depend on the habit that one is trying to form

11:53.500 --> 11:54.660
 or does it depend on the person

11:54.660 --> 11:56.400
 that's trying to form the habit?

11:56.400 --> 11:58.120
 Well, it turns out that there's excellent

11:58.120 --> 11:59.620
 peer reviewed data on this.

11:59.620 --> 12:00.980
 There's a study published in 2010,

12:00.980 --> 12:04.040
 first author Lally, L-A-L-L-Y.

12:04.040 --> 12:08.440
 This study found that for the same habit to be formed,

12:08.440 --> 12:13.440
 it can take anywhere from 18 days to as many as 254 days

12:13.500 --> 12:15.600
 for different individuals to form that habit.

12:15.600 --> 12:18.380
 The reason I bring this up is that I always get asked,

12:18.380 --> 12:21.000
 is it true that it takes 21 days to form a habit?

12:21.000 --> 12:23.600
 Is it true that your nervous system changes in six days

12:23.600 --> 12:25.640
 when you're doing something repeatedly?

12:25.640 --> 12:27.980
 And the answer is, as I mentioned before,

12:27.980 --> 12:29.440
 it's highly variable.

12:29.440 --> 12:31.760
 What I didn't tell you actually was what specific habit

12:31.760 --> 12:34.020
 they were looking at in that Lally study.

12:34.020 --> 12:37.200
 And it's interesting that the specific behavior

12:37.200 --> 12:38.640
 was a health related behavior.

12:38.640 --> 12:41.320
 That's pretty relevant to our discussion here on the podcast,

12:41.320 --> 12:43.760
 which was taking walks after dinner.

12:43.760 --> 12:46.360
 There's actually a really nice literature showing

12:46.360 --> 12:50.400
 that walks after a meal can speed glucose clearance

12:50.400 --> 12:52.120
 from the bloodstream, can be beneficial

12:52.120 --> 12:53.400
 for not just weight loss,

12:53.400 --> 12:55.640
 but cardiovascular health, et cetera.

12:55.640 --> 12:58.240
 So a walk after dinner seems pretty straightforward, right?

12:58.240 --> 13:00.840
 Well, in order to form that habit,

13:00.840 --> 13:05.080
 it took some people 18 days and other people 254 days.

13:05.080 --> 13:06.440
 How did they know when they formed the habit?

13:06.440 --> 13:09.720
 Well, they were doing it about 85% of the time.

13:09.720 --> 13:12.400
 And they also reported not having to spend

13:12.400 --> 13:16.400
 that much mental effort in order to get into the mode

13:16.400 --> 13:17.920
 of taking a walk after dinner.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.000
 So for those of you listening,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.000
 some of you might be thinking,

13:20.000 --> 13:22.740
 I can't believe that it would take some people 254 days

13:22.740 --> 13:24.120
 to get into that habit.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.680
 But as I said, people are highly variable.

13:26.680 --> 13:29.120
 And if you can't form one habit easily,

13:29.120 --> 13:32.560
 it doesn't mean that you can't form other habits easily.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.800
 The mystery of why certain people can form certain habits

13:35.800 --> 13:39.240
 more easily than others probably has something to do

13:39.240 --> 13:42.360
 with how well people manage what's called limbic friction.

13:42.360 --> 13:45.380
 Now, limbic friction is not a term that you're going to find

13:45.380 --> 13:47.680
 in the formal neurobiological literature

13:47.680 --> 13:49.480
 or even psychological literature.

13:49.480 --> 13:54.120
 It's frankly a term that I coined to encompass a number

13:54.120 --> 13:55.680
 of different pieces of the psychology

13:55.680 --> 13:57.480
 and neuroscience literature.

13:57.480 --> 14:00.320
 Limbic friction is a shorthand way that I use

14:00.320 --> 14:03.120
 to describe the strain that's required

14:03.120 --> 14:06.980
 in order to overcome one of two states within your body.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.920
 One state is one of anxiousness where you're really anxious

14:09.920 --> 14:13.500
 and therefore you can't calm down, you can't relax,

14:13.500 --> 14:15.980
 and therefore you can't engage in some particular activity

14:15.980 --> 14:17.800
 or thought pattern that you would like.

14:17.800 --> 14:20.200
 The other state is one in which you're feeling too tired

14:20.200 --> 14:22.660
 or lazy or not motivated.

14:22.660 --> 14:25.980
 Both of those states, feeling too alert and too calm,

14:25.980 --> 14:27.600
 if you will, relate to the function

14:27.600 --> 14:29.680
 of the so-called autonomic nervous system,

14:29.680 --> 14:32.320
 a set of neurons and hormones and chemicals

14:32.320 --> 14:34.640
 in your brain and body that act as sort of a seesaw.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.160
 You're either alert or calm.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.240
 You're either asleep or stressed.

14:38.240 --> 14:41.280
 Those two states are not compatible with one another.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.960
 You've probably heard of wired and tired,

14:42.960 --> 14:45.000
 but that's really once you've been very stressed

14:45.000 --> 14:47.540
 for a long time to the point where you're exhausted.

14:47.540 --> 14:48.840
 What does the autonomic nervous system

14:48.840 --> 14:49.780
 have to do with any of this?

14:49.780 --> 14:54.020
 Well, limbic friction is a phrase that can be used

14:54.020 --> 14:57.920
 to describe how much effort, how much activation energy

14:57.920 --> 15:00.660
 you need in order to engage in a particular behavior.

15:00.660 --> 15:03.280
 So using this LALI study as an example,

15:03.280 --> 15:05.360
 some people would eat dinner and then say,

15:05.360 --> 15:07.440
 oh, that's right, I'm trying to develop the habit

15:07.440 --> 15:10.480
 of taking a walk after dinner, so let's get up and go.

15:10.480 --> 15:11.320
 Other people will feel like,

15:11.320 --> 15:12.640
 I just don't want to do it today.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.640
 They're going to feel too much limbic friction,

15:14.640 --> 15:16.200
 and that limbic friction could arrive,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.100
 again, from one of two sources.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.540
 It could be because they are too tired to do it,

15:20.540 --> 15:22.680
 or it could be because they're too anxious

15:22.680 --> 15:25.680
 and distracted in order to do it.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.180
 So this is a key distinction.

15:27.180 --> 15:29.080
 A lot of habit formation has to do

15:29.080 --> 15:30.940
 with being in the right state of mind

15:30.940 --> 15:34.400
 and being able to control your state of body and mind.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.440
 So as we march forward,

15:35.440 --> 15:37.700
 what you're going to find is that this phrase

15:37.700 --> 15:40.600
 or this term limbic friction is going to be a useful metric

15:40.600 --> 15:42.840
 or way for you to touch in with yourself

15:42.840 --> 15:45.520
 and address whether or not you are likely to be able

15:45.520 --> 15:47.140
 to form a certain habit easily

15:47.140 --> 15:49.240
 or whether or not it's going to be very challenging.

15:49.240 --> 15:50.740
 And I'm going to teach you a way

15:50.740 --> 15:53.140
 to measure your degree of limbic friction,

15:53.140 --> 15:55.720
 that is how much activation energy it will take

15:55.720 --> 15:58.700
 in order for you to execute a new habit.

15:58.700 --> 16:01.120
 And I'm going to teach you how to measure your limbic

16:01.120 --> 16:03.960
 friction and activation energy for how likely it is

16:03.960 --> 16:06.320
 that you're going to be able to break a habit

16:06.320 --> 16:07.920
 that you don't want to have.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.180
 The other key concept for us to address

16:10.180 --> 16:12.240
 that's really mainly found in the books

16:12.240 --> 16:14.200
 and articles out there about habits

16:14.200 --> 16:16.840
 is this notion of what I call linchpin habits.

16:16.840 --> 16:19.440
 Lynchpin habits are certain habits that make a lot

16:19.440 --> 16:22.120
 of other habits easier to execute.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.680
 Now, the sorts of linchpin habits that I'm referring to

16:24.680 --> 16:27.900
 are always going to be things that you enjoy doing.

16:27.900 --> 16:30.440
 I'll just give you an example from my life.

16:30.440 --> 16:33.880
 I happen to like exercise, not all forms of exercise,

16:33.880 --> 16:35.760
 but I happen to like resistance training

16:35.760 --> 16:37.240
 and I happen to like running.

16:37.240 --> 16:38.640
 So I'm personally in the habit of getting

16:38.640 --> 16:41.460
 cardiovascular exercise three or four times per week,

16:41.460 --> 16:44.120
 maybe 30 to 60 minutes per session.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.640
 And I'm in the habit of doing resistance training

16:46.640 --> 16:48.360
 three or four times per week,

16:48.360 --> 16:51.960
 typically also for about 45 to 60 minutes per session.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.680
 Now I enjoy those.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.800
 And for reasons that I'll get into a little bit later,

16:55.800 --> 16:59.200
 I place those activities typically early in the day

16:59.200 --> 17:00.600
 because of the neurochemistry

17:00.600 --> 17:03.000
 and the various types of hormones, et cetera,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.880
 that are associated with performing those activities.

17:05.880 --> 17:09.400
 But I really place those activities under the umbrella

17:09.400 --> 17:12.000
 of what I call linchpin habits.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.840
 Why?

17:12.840 --> 17:15.440
 Because those particular habits are easy to execute

17:15.440 --> 17:16.520
 because I enjoy them,

17:16.520 --> 17:20.520
 but they also make a lot of other habits easier to execute.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.040
 Things like being alert for work,

17:23.040 --> 17:25.440
 things like making sure that I get good sleep

17:25.440 --> 17:27.520
 the night before, things like hydration,

17:27.520 --> 17:29.600
 things like making sure that I eat the foods

17:29.600 --> 17:32.320
 that are better for me than maybe some of the other foods

17:32.320 --> 17:34.660
 that I would more reflexively reach to

17:34.660 --> 17:36.400
 if I weren't doing that training.

17:36.400 --> 17:39.200
 So certain habits act as linchpins,

17:39.200 --> 17:41.360
 meaning that they shift a lot of other things.

17:41.360 --> 17:45.400
 They can control and bias the likelihood that in this case,

17:45.400 --> 17:48.040
 you or me will perform other habits

17:48.040 --> 17:49.720
 that are harder to access,

17:49.720 --> 17:52.120
 that we have less of an affinity for.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.000
 So again, there's three concepts

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000
 that we need to include here.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.040
 We've got identity-based versus goal-based habits.

17:58.040 --> 18:00.900
 We've got the concept that different habits

18:00.900 --> 18:03.040
 take different periods of time to adopt

18:03.040 --> 18:04.800
 depending on the person and the habit,

18:04.800 --> 18:07.780
 and that there are these, what I call linchpin habits,

18:07.780 --> 18:11.040
 certain habits that make other habits easier to execute.

18:11.040 --> 18:14.280
 And those linchpin habits always, always, always

18:14.280 --> 18:16.320
 are things that we enjoy doing.

18:16.320 --> 18:17.800
 So our goal throughout this episode

18:17.800 --> 18:20.240
 is for you to identify which habits

18:20.240 --> 18:22.080
 are easy for you to perform,

18:22.080 --> 18:24.040
 which ones are hard for you to perform,

18:24.040 --> 18:26.000
 and which habits you want to break.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.080
 If you want to grab a pen and paper, you can do that,

18:28.080 --> 18:30.200
 or if you want to dictate some of that into your phone,

18:30.200 --> 18:32.360
 you can, but right now, actually,

18:32.360 --> 18:34.520
 if you just want to think about these concepts,

18:34.520 --> 18:35.980
 can always go back later.

18:35.980 --> 18:38.640
 I'll make sure to spell out a very specific way

18:38.640 --> 18:40.400
 that you can chart out a map

18:40.400 --> 18:42.060
 towards forming particular habits

18:42.060 --> 18:44.840
 and breaking particular habits later on.

18:44.840 --> 18:47.100
 What I'd like us to do at this point

18:47.100 --> 18:49.960
 is to take that concept of limbic friction

18:49.960 --> 18:52.360
 and for you to ask yourself

18:52.360 --> 18:55.380
 what habits you perform on a daily basis.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.440
 And these could be things as basic

18:57.440 --> 18:59.840
 as brushing your teeth before breakfast

18:59.840 --> 19:01.240
 or brushing your teeth after breakfast.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.920
 It could be, for instance, that you get exercise

19:03.920 --> 19:05.480
 or you get it at a particular time of day,

19:05.480 --> 19:08.320
 or even that you take a particular route to work, right?

19:08.320 --> 19:11.440
 We are very habitual and we tend to do things

19:11.440 --> 19:13.120
 more or less over and over in the same way

19:13.120 --> 19:15.120
 unless we intervene in ourselves.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.260
 That's just the way that we are wired.

19:17.260 --> 19:18.760
 So now I'd like to shift to thinking

19:18.760 --> 19:21.600
 about a particular aspect of habits,

19:21.600 --> 19:23.280
 and that's habit strength.

19:24.220 --> 19:26.240
 You all have different habits.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.300
 You probably brush your teeth at a particular time of day.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.800
 You probably exercise at particular times a week.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.160
 You probably go to the refrigerator in a very habitual way.

19:33.160 --> 19:36.360
 We are incredibly habitual organisms.

19:36.360 --> 19:37.800
 Unless we intervene in our habits,

19:37.800 --> 19:39.260
 they tend to carry out the same way

19:39.260 --> 19:41.680
 that they always have once they've formed.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.160
 So you can do this exercise now.

19:43.160 --> 19:44.820
 You don't have to write this down if you don't want to,

19:44.820 --> 19:46.820
 but you certainly are welcome.

19:46.820 --> 19:49.280
 We're going to evaluate what's called habit strength.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.840
 That's not a concept that I created.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.400
 Habit strength is something that you will find

19:52.400 --> 19:54.200
 in the psychological literature.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.400
 Habit strength is measured by two main criteria.

19:57.400 --> 20:02.240
 The first is how context dependent a given habit is.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.640
 So context dependence is if you go

20:05.640 --> 20:07.460
 from one environment to the next,

20:07.460 --> 20:09.860
 do you tend to do the same thing in the same way

20:09.860 --> 20:11.280
 at the same time of day?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.680
 So for instance, brushing your teeth

20:12.680 --> 20:13.520
 first thing in the morning,

20:13.520 --> 20:15.080
 maybe some of you do that before breakfast,

20:15.080 --> 20:16.340
 maybe some of you do that later,

20:16.340 --> 20:18.920
 maybe some of you like me don't even eat breakfast.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.740
 But when I travel, I tend to brush my teeth

20:21.740 --> 20:23.880
 at more or less the same time of day

20:23.880 --> 20:26.440
 relative to when I wake up as I do when I'm at home.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.300
 So it's context independent.

20:28.300 --> 20:32.000
 So it's a very strong habit, right?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.860
 There are certain behaviors like perhaps what you eat

20:35.860 --> 20:40.500
 or perhaps how you dress that are context independent

20:40.500 --> 20:43.880
 that you might perform one way in one context

20:43.880 --> 20:45.780
 and another way in another context.

20:45.780 --> 20:47.340
 The other aspect of habit strength

20:47.340 --> 20:49.760
 is how much limbic friction is required

20:49.760 --> 20:52.040
 to perform that habit on a regular basis.

20:52.040 --> 20:53.600
 This is extremely important

20:53.600 --> 20:57.320
 because if you were in the process of building habits

20:57.320 --> 20:59.920
 and consolidating those habits,

20:59.920 --> 21:03.640
 then it's probably going to take more limbic friction

21:03.640 --> 21:05.260
 to execute those habits.

21:05.260 --> 21:06.100
 What do I mean by that?

21:06.100 --> 21:09.040
 Well, let's say you set out to get,

21:09.040 --> 21:12.680
 let's say 45 minutes of zone two cardio exercise every day,

21:12.680 --> 21:14.700
 five or maybe even seven days a week.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.920
 Well, if at first you're highly motivated,

21:18.920 --> 21:20.520
 limbic friction might be pretty low.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.720
 Limbic friction is how much top-down,

21:22.720 --> 21:24.920
 meaning from your forebrain to your limbic system,

21:24.920 --> 21:28.080
 the part of your brain that generates autonomic responses,

21:28.080 --> 21:32.280
 how much limbic friction, meaning conscious override

21:32.280 --> 21:35.440
 of your state is required

21:35.440 --> 21:37.420
 in order to engage in that particular behavior.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.740
 So if you're feeling particularly tired

21:38.740 --> 21:40.060
 and you don't want to get up out of bed

21:40.060 --> 21:42.740
 and you don't want to go out into your zone two cardio,

21:42.740 --> 21:45.100
 then there's a high degree of limbic friction.

21:45.100 --> 21:47.320
 It takes more, some people think of it as motivation,

21:47.320 --> 21:49.320
 but motivation is a bit of a vague concept

21:49.320 --> 21:51.920
 whereas limbic friction involves specific neural circuits.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.300
 And you can think of it in a more or less quantitative way.

21:54.300 --> 21:56.800
 You can think of that your body is very tired,

21:56.800 --> 21:58.440
 so it's going to take more limbic friction

21:58.440 --> 22:00.520
 in order to get into action, right?

22:00.520 --> 22:02.400
 You're going to have to overcome more limbic friction,

22:02.400 --> 22:05.240
 excuse me, whereas if you're very, very alert,

22:05.240 --> 22:06.660
 there's less limbic friction

22:06.660 --> 22:08.200
 because you're moving towards something

22:08.200 --> 22:09.800
 that's action-oriented.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.980
 However, the inverse is also true.

22:11.980 --> 22:14.640
 Let's say that you are trying to get into the habit

22:14.640 --> 22:16.900
 or you're in the early stages of forming a habit

22:16.900 --> 22:18.600
 to meditate regularly.

22:18.600 --> 22:22.020
 That's a pretty quiescent or calming activity.

22:22.020 --> 22:23.560
 So if you're somebody who comes home from work

22:23.560 --> 22:26.320
 and you're very anxious and you have a lot of work to do

22:26.320 --> 22:28.000
 and you have to deal with a bunch of things,

22:28.000 --> 22:30.280
 there's a lot of limbic friction to overcome

22:30.280 --> 22:32.860
 in order to get into that calm state.

22:32.860 --> 22:35.840
 So these two aspects, context dependence,

22:35.840 --> 22:37.520
 whether or not you're likely to do the thing

22:37.520 --> 22:39.960
 regardless of where you are, right?

22:39.960 --> 22:43.000
 On travel, at home, on vacation, with people around,

22:43.000 --> 22:44.520
 not people around, et cetera,

22:44.520 --> 22:47.000
 and how much limbic friction is required

22:47.000 --> 22:48.920
 to execute that habit will tell you

22:48.920 --> 22:50.540
 whether or not that habit is deeply

22:50.540 --> 22:54.460
 or just shallowly embedded within your nervous system.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.700
 The goal of any habit that we want to form

22:56.700 --> 22:58.880
 is to get into what's called automaticity.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.840
 Automaticity is fancy language

23:00.840 --> 23:03.600
 for the neural circuits can perform it automatically.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.100
 And that's the ultimate place to be, right?

23:06.100 --> 23:07.780
 If you have all these goals and things

23:07.780 --> 23:10.400
 that you want to be doing on a regular basis,

23:10.400 --> 23:12.000
 you'd love for them to be habitual

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
 because it takes less mental and physical effort,

23:15.000 --> 23:17.920
 less limbic friction in order to execute those.

23:17.920 --> 23:20.320
 And so much of what's out there, again,

23:20.320 --> 23:22.360
 in the popular psychology literature,

23:22.360 --> 23:24.360
 in books that you'll find on the bookstore shelf

23:24.360 --> 23:26.160
 and on Amazon and in the airports,

23:26.160 --> 23:28.140
 are about how to get from that mode

23:28.140 --> 23:31.160
 of high degree of limbic friction to automaticity.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.060
 And they offer a number of different ways,

23:33.060 --> 23:35.060
 I think many of which are useful,

23:35.060 --> 23:37.200
 trying to get you to organize different types of habits

23:37.200 --> 23:39.960
 into different bins like value-based and goal-based

23:39.960 --> 23:42.400
 and trying to persuade you that structuring habits

23:42.400 --> 23:43.920
 at the particular times of day

23:43.920 --> 23:46.060
 or in a particular way are going to be beneficial.

23:46.060 --> 23:48.480
 And indeed, I think they have helped a lot of people.

23:48.480 --> 23:51.880
 So what I'd like to do is to take the scientific literature

23:51.880 --> 23:53.600
 of how the nervous system learns

23:53.600 --> 23:55.400
 and engages in neuroplasticity

23:55.400 --> 23:58.020
 and apply that to habit formation,

23:58.020 --> 24:00.900
 habit maintenance, and if so desired,

24:00.900 --> 24:03.040
 how to break particular habits.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.840
 I'd like to give you a particular tool

24:04.840 --> 24:08.080
 that's gleaned from the research psychology literature.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.540
 I should mention that I learned about this

24:10.540 --> 24:13.560
 from an excellent review article that's available online.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.360
 It's called Psychology of Habit.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.080
 The authors are Wendy Wood and Dennis Runger.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.240
 This is published in Annual Review of Psychology.

24:21.240 --> 24:25.460
 The Annual Reviews series is a very high quality series.

24:25.460 --> 24:27.720
 There are annual reviews of neuroscience,

24:27.720 --> 24:29.080
 annual reviews of psychology,

24:29.080 --> 24:31.260
 annual reviews of nutrition science, et cetera.

24:31.260 --> 24:32.320
 For those of you that are interested

24:32.320 --> 24:35.240
 in exploring review articles that are grounded

24:35.240 --> 24:38.480
 in hundreds of quality peer-reviewed studies,

24:38.480 --> 24:41.080
 the Annual Review series is really terrific,

24:41.080 --> 24:43.320
 certainly among the best, if not the best.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.880
 And they also tend to be quite long and quite comprehensive.

24:45.880 --> 24:46.720
 So this review,

24:46.720 --> 24:50.640
 Psychology of Habit by Wood and Runger, is excellent.

24:50.640 --> 24:53.420
 And here I'm more or less paraphrasing from them,

24:53.420 --> 24:57.000
 so I want to be clear that these are their words, not mine.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.940
 They're talking about the various ways

24:59.940 --> 25:02.080
 that habits form in the nervous system.

25:02.080 --> 25:06.780
 And they mention with each repetition of a habit,

25:06.780 --> 25:09.840
 small changes occur in the cognitive and neural mechanisms

25:09.840 --> 25:11.660
 associated with procedural memory.

25:11.660 --> 25:12.960
 So I just want to talk for a second

25:12.960 --> 25:15.000
 about what procedural memory is.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.660
 In the neuroscience of memory,

25:16.660 --> 25:19.320
 we distinguish between what's called episodic memory

25:19.320 --> 25:20.880
 and procedural memory.

25:20.880 --> 25:24.920
 Episodic memory is a recall of a particular set of events

25:24.920 --> 25:28.440
 that happened, whereas procedural memory is holding in mind

25:28.440 --> 25:30.760
 the specific sequence of things that need to happen

25:30.760 --> 25:32.880
 in order for a particular outcome to occur.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.640
 So think of it like a recipe or a protocol,

25:35.640 --> 25:38.540
 or if for sake of exercise, it's like sets and reps

25:38.540 --> 25:41.560
 or a particular course that you're going to run or cycle

25:41.560 --> 25:43.480
 or the number of laps you're going to swim

25:43.480 --> 25:45.240
 and how you're going to perform it.

25:46.460 --> 25:50.160
 It's very clear that for anyone trying to adopt new habits,

25:50.160 --> 25:52.960
 getting into the mindset of procedural memory

25:52.960 --> 25:55.500
 is very useful for overcoming that barrier

25:55.500 --> 25:56.960
 that we call limbic friction.

25:56.960 --> 25:57.960
 How do you do that?

25:57.960 --> 26:01.200
 Well, a simple visualization exercise,

26:01.200 --> 26:03.880
 or it doesn't even have to be done eyes closed.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.600
 Oftentimes we hear visualization exercise,

26:05.600 --> 26:07.840
 you think about sitting in the Lotus position, eyes closed,

26:07.840 --> 26:10.420
 and trying really hard to visualize something.

26:10.420 --> 26:12.000
 It doesn't need to be anything like that.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.900
 It can simply be if you are deciding to adopt a new habit,

26:16.900 --> 26:19.880
 to just think about the very specific sequence of steps

26:19.880 --> 26:22.880
 that's required to execute that habit.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.040
 And I'll use a trivial example,

26:25.040 --> 26:27.000
 but this could be applied to anything.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.640
 Let's say I want to get into the habit of making myself

26:29.640 --> 26:31.120
 or someone else in my household

26:31.120 --> 26:33.560
 a cup of espresso every morning.

26:33.560 --> 26:37.180
 I would actually think through each of those steps,

26:37.180 --> 26:40.240
 walk into the kitchen, turn on the espresso machine,

26:40.240 --> 26:42.840
 draw the espresso, walking through each of those steps

26:42.840 --> 26:44.240
 from start to finish.

26:44.240 --> 26:47.720
 It turns out just that simple mental exercise done once

26:47.720 --> 26:51.140
 can shift people toward a much higher likelihood

26:51.140 --> 26:53.080
 of performing that habit regularly,

26:53.080 --> 26:54.460
 not just the first time,

26:54.460 --> 26:58.160
 but as they continue out into the days and weeks that follow.

26:58.160 --> 26:59.280
 So that's remarkable to me.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.320
 And the literature is really robust.

27:01.320 --> 27:05.120
 Just one mental exercise of thinking through

27:05.120 --> 27:07.040
 what are the sequence of steps required

27:07.040 --> 27:09.880
 in order to perform this habit from start to finish

27:09.880 --> 27:13.400
 can shift the likelihood of being able to perform that habit

27:13.400 --> 27:15.780
 from unlikely or to moderately likely

27:15.780 --> 27:17.480
 to very likely over time.

27:17.480 --> 27:20.880
 And that's because it pulls from this process

27:20.880 --> 27:22.920
 that involves our hippocampus and our neocortex

27:22.920 --> 27:25.320
 and other areas of our brain and nervous system

27:25.320 --> 27:26.920
 that engage in procedural memory.

27:26.920 --> 27:30.680
 It shifts the brain towards a mindset, if you will.

27:30.680 --> 27:32.600
 It's more of a neural circuit set,

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
 it would be more accurate,

27:33.600 --> 27:36.640
 but a mindset slash neural circuit set

27:36.640 --> 27:38.960
 of doing things in a particular sequence,

27:38.960 --> 27:41.780
 which allows that limbic friction to come down

27:41.780 --> 27:43.200
 and increases the likelihood

27:43.200 --> 27:44.660
 that we're going to perform that thing.

27:44.660 --> 27:46.540
 Simple tool, but very powerful tool

27:46.540 --> 27:48.540
 according to the psychology literature.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.760
 And actually the cellular and molecular mechanisms

27:50.760 --> 27:53.720
 that underlie that sort of procedural memory

27:53.720 --> 27:56.760
 stepping through phenomenon are known.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.380
 In this article I mentioned, this beautiful review,

28:01.340 --> 28:03.520
 they talk about so-called Hebbian learning.

28:03.520 --> 28:06.240
 Donald Hebb was a psychologist in Canada

28:06.240 --> 28:09.080
 and birthed this field that has now lasted,

28:09.080 --> 28:11.900
 gosh, more than 50 years and is still very strong

28:11.900 --> 28:14.580
 in neuroscience and psychology of Hebbian learning.

28:14.580 --> 28:18.380
 Hebbian learning is when particular neurons are co-active,

28:18.380 --> 28:19.660
 meaning when they fire together,

28:19.660 --> 28:22.400
 they tend to strengthen their connections with one another.

28:22.400 --> 28:23.640
 And it has a number of different

28:23.640 --> 28:25.340
 underlying cellular and molecular features

28:25.340 --> 28:26.760
 that we don't have to go into in detail.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.000
 But for those of you that want to know,

28:28.000 --> 28:29.080
 I know some of you are hungry

28:29.080 --> 28:31.920
 for a little bit more neuroscience.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.720
 This involves things like NMDA receptors

28:34.720 --> 28:37.040
 and methyl deaspartate receptors.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.920
 NMDA receptors are really important,

28:38.920 --> 28:40.660
 I think for everyone to understand.

28:40.660 --> 28:42.280
 So I'll just tell you a little bit about them.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.120
 These are receptors that are on the neuron surface

28:45.120 --> 28:46.820
 and normally they don't contribute much

28:46.820 --> 28:48.440
 to the activity of those neurons.

28:48.440 --> 28:50.720
 Those neurons are perfectly capable of doing their thing

28:50.720 --> 28:53.240
 without activation of this NMDA receptor.

28:53.240 --> 28:55.880
 But when a neuron gets a very strong input,

28:55.880 --> 28:59.160
 a strong stimulus, that NMDA receptor

28:59.160 --> 29:01.840
 triggers a number of mechanisms that recruit

29:01.840 --> 29:04.600
 to the surface of the neuron more other receptors.

29:04.600 --> 29:07.440
 In other words, it makes that neuron more responsive

29:07.440 --> 29:08.940
 to input in the future,

29:08.940 --> 29:11.760
 such that it doesn't require so much input.

29:11.760 --> 29:14.480
 In other words, it takes a neuron

29:14.480 --> 29:16.560
 that is very unlikely to fire

29:16.560 --> 29:18.440
 and makes it more likely to fire.

29:18.440 --> 29:20.360
 So this procedural stepping through

29:20.360 --> 29:23.620
 of the steps of the recipe or the series of action steps

29:23.620 --> 29:25.960
 that are involved in sitting down to study

29:25.960 --> 29:28.720
 and writing for an hour or generating exercise,

29:28.720 --> 29:30.640
 whatever it is, the habit that you're trying to learn,

29:30.640 --> 29:32.360
 when you're doing that exercise,

29:32.360 --> 29:33.720
 it's not as if your nervous system

29:33.720 --> 29:35.560
 thinks you're actually performing the behavior.

29:35.560 --> 29:36.860
 Your nervous system isn't stupid.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.520
 It's actually a lot smarter than that.

29:38.520 --> 29:41.080
 It knows the difference between a thought and an action.

29:41.080 --> 29:44.360
 But when you do that, it sets in motion the same neurons

29:44.360 --> 29:47.080
 that are going to be required for the execution

29:47.080 --> 29:47.920
 of that habit.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.740
 And so when you actually show up to perform that habit,

29:50.740 --> 29:53.580
 it's as if the dominoes fall more easily.

29:53.580 --> 29:56.480
 It's a lower threshold, as we say,

29:56.480 --> 29:58.520
 in order to get the habit to perform.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.840
 So heavy in learning, NMDA receptors,

30:00.840 --> 30:03.320
 all that nuts and bolts stuff,

30:03.320 --> 30:05.680
 really the guts of the mechanisms of how this works.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.720
 But for those of you that just want to be more habitual

30:08.720 --> 30:09.960
 about certain things,

30:09.960 --> 30:11.920
 be able to perform certain things more reflexively

30:11.920 --> 30:13.200
 that you would like in your life,

30:13.200 --> 30:16.180
 simply take the time, do it once, maybe twice,

30:16.180 --> 30:18.640
 and just sit down, close your eyes if you like,

30:18.640 --> 30:20.200
 and just step through the procedure

30:20.200 --> 30:23.160
 of what it's going to take in order to perform that habit.

30:23.160 --> 30:25.120
 The psychology literature, as I mentioned,

30:25.120 --> 30:27.720
 and also the neuroscience literature

30:27.720 --> 30:29.320
 strongly supports the fact

30:29.320 --> 30:32.160
 that it is going to make it far easier for you to adopt

30:32.160 --> 30:33.660
 and maintain that habit.

30:33.660 --> 30:36.560
 And if you are somebody who used to perform a habit

30:36.560 --> 30:39.040
 and you don't understand why you dropped it

30:39.040 --> 30:40.520
 and you're frustrated with yourself

30:40.520 --> 30:41.700
 and you're trying to figure out

30:41.700 --> 30:43.780
 how you can get back into that habit,

30:43.780 --> 30:46.140
 well, by all means, lean right back into that habit.

30:46.140 --> 30:47.960
 But if you're having trouble doing that,

30:47.960 --> 30:50.960
 also just use the procedural memory exercise

30:50.960 --> 30:52.840
 in order to shift your nervous system

30:52.840 --> 30:55.060
 toward a higher likelihood

30:55.060 --> 30:57.120
 that you will return to that habit,

30:57.120 --> 30:58.400
 just the same way I described

30:58.400 --> 31:00.780
 for trying to initiate a new habit.

31:00.780 --> 31:02.460
 So now I'd like to discuss a second

31:02.460 --> 31:05.440
 and what I think is perhaps the most powerful tool

31:05.440 --> 31:09.040
 for being able to acquire and stick to new habits.

31:09.040 --> 31:12.680
 This tool is rooted in what we call neural circuits.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.200
 And I do think it is important to understand a little bit

31:15.200 --> 31:17.400
 about how those neural circuits work.

31:17.400 --> 31:20.200
 For those of you that are saying, just tell me what to do.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.280
 I have to say, as I always say,

31:22.280 --> 31:26.040
 understanding a little bit or a lot of underlying mechanism

31:26.040 --> 31:29.200
 will help solidify these concepts for you

31:29.200 --> 31:32.260
 and will help ensure that the tools that I offer

31:32.260 --> 31:33.240
 are going to make sense

31:33.240 --> 31:35.360
 and that they're going to make sense in different contexts

31:35.360 --> 31:36.880
 and for different types of habits

31:36.880 --> 31:38.160
 that you're trying to learn.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.840
 So rather than just tell you what to do,

31:39.840 --> 31:42.800
 I'm going to tell you how this particular tool works.

31:42.800 --> 31:43.740
 And then in doing that,

31:43.740 --> 31:45.520
 you should be able to apply it to any habit

31:45.520 --> 31:47.360
 under any conditions.

31:47.360 --> 31:49.320
 The tool that I'm referring to

31:49.320 --> 31:51.800
 is something called task bracketing.

31:51.800 --> 31:54.920
 And the neural circuits associated with task bracketing

31:54.920 --> 31:56.560
 are basically the neural circuits

31:56.560 --> 32:00.120
 that are going to allow you to learn any new type of habit

32:00.120 --> 32:03.100
 or break any habit that you'd like to break.

32:03.100 --> 32:05.880
 We have in our brain a set of neural circuits

32:05.880 --> 32:08.720
 that fall under the umbrella term of the basal ganglia.

32:08.720 --> 32:12.040
 The basal ganglia are involved in action execution,

32:12.040 --> 32:13.580
 meaning doing certain things,

32:13.580 --> 32:16.900
 and action suppression, not doing certain things.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.160
 In the experimental realm,

32:20.160 --> 32:22.620
 these are referred to as go, meaning do,

32:22.620 --> 32:25.520
 or no go, don't do certain things.

32:25.520 --> 32:27.860
 And some of us fall more into the category

32:27.860 --> 32:30.360
 of we find it very easy to do certain things

32:30.360 --> 32:32.960
 but harder to not do other things.

32:32.960 --> 32:36.800
 Some people have a lot of no-go type circuits

32:36.800 --> 32:37.840
 that are very robust,

32:37.840 --> 32:40.120
 and they have a lot of behavioral constraint,

32:40.120 --> 32:42.000
 but they have a harder time getting into action.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.920
 And some people have a perfect balance of both,

32:43.920 --> 32:46.160
 but I've never met one of those people.

32:46.160 --> 32:49.720
 So again, drawing from and more or less paraphrasing

32:49.720 --> 32:52.920
 from this beautiful review that I described earlier

32:52.920 --> 32:56.500
 in annual review of psychology, excuse me,

32:56.500 --> 32:58.920
 by Wood and Runger,

32:58.920 --> 33:01.880
 task bracketing involves a particular set of neural circuits

33:01.880 --> 33:04.040
 within the basal ganglia.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.840
 So I'm going to describe this here, again,

33:05.840 --> 33:08.500
 paraphrasing a sensory motor loop.

33:08.500 --> 33:12.000
 Sensory means just input coming in about sight,

33:12.000 --> 33:14.160
 sounds, tastes, et cetera.

33:14.160 --> 33:15.760
 And then the motor systems,

33:15.760 --> 33:18.460
 the systems of the brain and body that generate action,

33:18.460 --> 33:21.320
 taking that information and generating action.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.440
 So it turns out that there's an area of our basal ganglia

33:24.440 --> 33:26.560
 called the dorsolateral striatum.

33:26.560 --> 33:28.560
 We can use the acronym DLS.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.120
 Again, dorsolateral striatum.

33:31.120 --> 33:33.240
 Dorsal means up, lateral means to the side,

33:33.240 --> 33:34.080
 so dorsolateral.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.760
 And striatum is a subdivision of the basal ganglia.

33:37.760 --> 33:42.200
 And it's very important for the establishment of behaviors

33:42.200 --> 33:44.240
 that are associated with a habit,

33:44.240 --> 33:47.160
 but not necessarily the habit itself.

33:47.160 --> 33:50.200
 And beautiful studies in both animals and humans

33:50.200 --> 33:52.400
 that record the electrical activity

33:52.400 --> 33:54.040
 in the dorsolateral striatum

33:54.040 --> 33:57.420
 find that the dorsolateral striatum is associated,

33:57.420 --> 33:59.520
 meaning it becomes active,

33:59.520 --> 34:02.120
 at the beginning of a particular habit

34:02.120 --> 34:05.400
 and at the very end and after a particular habit.

34:05.400 --> 34:09.380
 Hence the phrase task bracketing, it brackets the habit.

34:09.380 --> 34:11.440
 Now, other sets of neurons are going to be active

34:11.440 --> 34:14.240
 during the actual execution of the habit.

34:14.240 --> 34:17.260
 But what the literature on the dorsolateral striatum

34:17.260 --> 34:21.600
 tells us is that we have particular circuits in our brain

34:21.600 --> 34:24.360
 that are devoted to framing the events

34:24.360 --> 34:27.840
 that happened just before and as we initiate a habit

34:27.840 --> 34:30.740
 and just after and as we terminate a habit.

34:30.740 --> 34:33.100
 In other words, it acts as a sort of marker

34:33.100 --> 34:34.300
 for the habit execution,

34:34.300 --> 34:37.320
 but not the execution of the habit per se.

34:37.320 --> 34:41.460
 This is very important because task bracketing

34:41.460 --> 34:43.700
 is what underlies whether or not a habit

34:43.700 --> 34:46.300
 will be context dependent or not,

34:46.300 --> 34:49.400
 whether or not it will be strong and likely to occur

34:49.400 --> 34:51.640
 even if we didn't get a good night's sleep the night before,

34:51.640 --> 34:53.400
 even if we're feeling distracted,

34:53.400 --> 34:56.800
 even if we are not feeling like doing something emotionally,

34:56.800 --> 35:01.100
 or if we are completely overwhelmed by other events,

35:01.100 --> 35:03.980
 if the neural circuits for task bracketing

35:03.980 --> 35:05.480
 are deeply embedded in us,

35:05.480 --> 35:08.600
 meaning they are very robust around a particular habit,

35:08.600 --> 35:10.200
 well, then it's likely that we're going to go out

35:10.200 --> 35:12.380
 for that zone two cardio no matter what,

35:12.380 --> 35:14.200
 that we're going to brush our teeth no matter what.

35:14.200 --> 35:16.080
 In fact, brushing our teeth is a pretty good example

35:16.080 --> 35:17.620
 because for most people,

35:17.620 --> 35:19.800
 even if you've got a terrible night's sleep,

35:19.800 --> 35:22.840
 even if everything in your life is going wrong,

35:22.840 --> 35:25.440
 chances are, unless you're very depressed,

35:25.440 --> 35:27.880
 if you're going to leave to work, or even if you're not,

35:27.880 --> 35:30.280
 that you're going to still carry out the behavior

35:30.280 --> 35:31.580
 of brushing your teeth in the morning,

35:31.580 --> 35:33.240
 I would hope so actually,

35:33.240 --> 35:36.600
 but you are probably less likely to perform

35:36.600 --> 35:41.020
 particular habits that are not what you deem as necessary.

35:41.020 --> 35:43.840
 But if you think about it, brushing your teeth,

35:43.840 --> 35:45.740
 exercise, eating particular foods,

35:45.740 --> 35:47.880
 maybe engaging socially in particular ways,

35:49.040 --> 35:51.400
 you are the one that places any kind of value assessment

35:51.400 --> 35:54.800
 on which ones are essential and which ones are negotiable.

35:54.800 --> 35:58.600
 So task bracketing sets a neural imprint,

35:58.600 --> 36:00.160
 a kind of a fingerprint in your brain

36:00.160 --> 36:03.320
 of this thing has to happen at this particular time of day,

36:03.320 --> 36:05.600
 so much so that it's reflexive.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.360
 And as we'll talk about in a moment,

36:07.360 --> 36:10.740
 there's a way that you can build up task bracketing

36:10.740 --> 36:13.660
 so that regardless of what it is you're trying to learn,

36:13.660 --> 36:15.480
 there's a much higher probability

36:15.480 --> 36:17.200
 that you're going to do that thing.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.040
 And when I say learn,

36:18.040 --> 36:20.240
 meaning let's say you're trying to acquire a habit

36:20.240 --> 36:21.640
 that for you is really challenging.

36:21.640 --> 36:24.240
 Maybe it's that you're going to write for an hour a day

36:24.240 --> 36:26.180
 on a book project that you've been thinking about,

36:26.180 --> 36:28.240
 or you're going to work on mathematics,

36:28.240 --> 36:30.280
 or you're going to do any sort of thing that for you,

36:30.280 --> 36:32.020
 there's a lot of limbic friction.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.880
 While it is important to think about the sequence of events

36:35.880 --> 36:38.440
 that would be required in order to engage in that behavior,

36:38.440 --> 36:41.000
 that procedural memory visualization exercise

36:41.000 --> 36:43.380
 we talked about before, that will help.

36:43.380 --> 36:46.840
 There is a way also that you can orient your nervous system

36:46.840 --> 36:49.560
 toward this task bracketing process

36:49.560 --> 36:52.840
 so that your nervous system is shifted or oriented

36:52.840 --> 36:55.980
 towards the execution of a given habit.

36:55.980 --> 36:59.140
 So this is sort of like warming up your body to exercise.

36:59.140 --> 37:01.680
 When the dorsolateral striatum is engaged,

37:01.680 --> 37:04.840
 your body and your brain are primed to execute a habit,

37:04.840 --> 37:06.640
 and then you get to consciously insert

37:06.640 --> 37:08.200
 which habit you want to perform.

37:08.200 --> 37:10.440
 So in order to leverage the neural mechanisms

37:10.440 --> 37:13.880
 of task bracketing in order to increase the likelihood

37:13.880 --> 37:16.640
 that you're going to perform a particular habit,

37:16.640 --> 37:19.380
 I have to break it to you that one thing

37:19.380 --> 37:21.720
 that you've probably heard over and over

37:21.720 --> 37:25.060
 about habit formation is not true.

37:25.060 --> 37:27.240
 And what I'm referring to is this idea

37:27.240 --> 37:29.000
 that if you are very specific

37:29.000 --> 37:32.880
 about exactly when you're going to perform a particular habit

37:32.880 --> 37:35.520
 that you are more likely to perform that habit.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.560
 And while that is true in the short term,

37:38.560 --> 37:41.160
 it is not true in the long term.

37:41.160 --> 37:43.880
 And the reason for that is that our nervous system

37:43.880 --> 37:46.720
 tends to generate particular kinds of behaviors

37:46.720 --> 37:50.440
 based not on time, but on our state,

37:50.440 --> 37:53.400
 meaning what level of activation is taking place

37:53.400 --> 37:56.080
 in our brain and body, how much focus we happen to have,

37:56.080 --> 37:59.340
 how fatigued we are, how energized we are.

37:59.340 --> 38:01.840
 So while schedules are important,

38:01.840 --> 38:05.180
 it's not the specific time of day per se

38:05.180 --> 38:08.000
 that's going to allow you to get into a habit

38:08.000 --> 38:10.640
 and form that habit and consolidate that habit.

38:10.640 --> 38:14.080
 Rather, it's the state that your brain and body are in

38:14.080 --> 38:16.240
 that's important to anchor yourself to.

38:16.240 --> 38:18.280
 So now I'm going to offer you a tool.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.100
 It's actually an entire program

38:20.100 --> 38:23.640
 by which you can insert particular habits and activities

38:23.640 --> 38:25.480
 at particular phases of the day,

38:25.480 --> 38:27.840
 not times of day, but phases of the day,

38:27.840 --> 38:30.600
 because it turns out that particular phases of the day

38:30.600 --> 38:33.880
 are associated with particular biological underpinnings,

38:33.880 --> 38:36.240
 chemicals and neural circuits and so forth.

38:36.240 --> 38:39.040
 And in doing so, it will make it far more likely

38:39.040 --> 38:41.960
 that you'll be able to regularly engage in these habits

38:41.960 --> 38:45.040
 and activities over a long period of time.

38:45.040 --> 38:46.780
 Now, whether or not that will move you from somebody

38:46.780 --> 38:49.920
 who ordinarily would take 200 days to form a habit

38:49.920 --> 38:52.760
 to one of those 18 days to habit people

38:52.760 --> 38:55.400
 in that earlier study I mentioned, I don't know,

38:55.400 --> 38:57.960
 but I am certain that it will have a significant shift

38:57.960 --> 39:01.360
 on allowing you to engage in particular habits more easily

39:01.360 --> 39:03.720
 and to consolidate those habits more quickly.

39:03.720 --> 39:05.600
 So the program I am about to describe,

39:05.600 --> 39:09.120
 I formulated for you based on the neuroscience literature

39:09.120 --> 39:10.780
 and the psychology literature of learning

39:10.780 --> 39:13.080
 and this concept of task bracketing.

39:13.080 --> 39:15.260
 It involves dividing the 24 hour days

39:15.260 --> 39:17.460
 into what I call three phases.

39:17.460 --> 39:21.680
 The first is phase one, which is zero to eight hours

39:21.680 --> 39:24.160
 after waking up approximately, okay?

39:24.160 --> 39:28.200
 You can put a plus or minus 30 minutes on this for yourself.

39:28.200 --> 39:31.440
 The second phase is the nine to 14,

39:31.440 --> 39:34.600
 maybe 15 hours after you wake up.

39:34.600 --> 39:38.200
 And the third phase is 16 to 24 hours after waking up.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.760
 So we've taken the 24 hour cycle,

39:39.760 --> 39:41.720
 we've carved it up into three phases,

39:41.720 --> 39:43.920
 phase one, phase two and phase three.

39:43.920 --> 39:45.800
 Now, everything I'm describing,

39:45.800 --> 39:47.780
 or at least the way I'm going to describe it

39:47.780 --> 39:50.400
 is based on what I would call a typical schedule,

39:50.400 --> 39:51.560
 diurnal schedule.

39:51.560 --> 39:52.600
 You've heard of nocturnal?

39:52.600 --> 39:54.320
 Well, we are diurnal.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.880
 Most of us are asleep at night and awake during the day.

39:56.880 --> 40:00.100
 I do realize that a number of people have shift work

40:00.100 --> 40:02.160
 or they have newborns or other reasons

40:02.160 --> 40:03.720
 why they have to be up in the middle of the night

40:03.720 --> 40:05.400
 and sleeping during the day.

40:05.400 --> 40:07.880
 If that's the case, please listen to the episode

40:07.880 --> 40:10.040
 that we did on jet lag and shift work

40:10.040 --> 40:11.200
 because it has a lot of tools

40:11.200 --> 40:13.480
 specifically for that population.

40:13.480 --> 40:17.200
 But most people go to sleep somewhere around 10 p.m.,

40:17.200 --> 40:18.800
 plus or minus two hours,

40:18.800 --> 40:21.400
 and wake up sometime around 7 a.m.,

40:21.400 --> 40:23.080
 plus or minus two hours.

40:23.080 --> 40:26.160
 So today I'm going to use the two bed at 10 p.m.

40:26.160 --> 40:30.360
 and the wake up time of 7 a.m. as the framework for this,

40:30.360 --> 40:33.260
 but you could adopt it easily to your particular schedule.

40:34.440 --> 40:37.880
 Phase one, which again is zero to eight hours after waking,

40:37.880 --> 40:41.300
 has a particular neurochemical signature.

40:41.300 --> 40:43.120
 Regardless of what you do,

40:43.120 --> 40:46.600
 the neuromodulators norepinephrine as well as epinephrine,

40:46.600 --> 40:48.680
 so that's noradrenaline and adrenaline,

40:48.680 --> 40:51.060
 as well as the neuromodulator dopamine,

40:51.060 --> 40:54.920
 tend to be elevated during that first zero to eight hours

40:54.920 --> 40:55.900
 after waking.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.020
 There are a number of reasons for this

40:57.020 --> 40:59.120
 related to the fact that also cortisol

40:59.120 --> 41:01.680
 is higher in our brain and bloodstream.

41:01.680 --> 41:03.840
 It's a healthy level of cortisol upon waking,

41:03.840 --> 41:05.880
 body temperature is increased, et cetera.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.080
 And there are several things

41:07.080 --> 41:08.800
 that perhaps we should all be doing.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.400
 I've talked about many of these on the podcast before,

41:11.400 --> 41:13.640
 that in addition to those chemicals,

41:13.640 --> 41:17.120
 further support an alert and focused state.

41:17.120 --> 41:18.460
 And I'll just list those off.

41:18.460 --> 41:20.880
 I've done many podcasts on each of these.

41:20.880 --> 41:22.480
 If you'd like to access those podcasts,

41:22.480 --> 41:25.960
 you can find them in the menu of podcasts on YouTube,

41:25.960 --> 41:27.500
 Apple, Spotify, et cetera.

41:27.500 --> 41:28.840
 They involve, for instance,

41:28.840 --> 41:32.000
 viewing sunlight or bright artificial light

41:32.000 --> 41:33.160
 if you can't access sunlight

41:33.160 --> 41:35.640
 within the first 30 minutes of waking,

41:35.640 --> 41:38.040
 physical exercise of some kind

41:38.040 --> 41:39.880
 in this first phase of the day,

41:39.880 --> 41:41.080
 zero to eight hours of the day,

41:41.080 --> 41:43.400
 ideally pretty early in that phase.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.000
 But you know, if it has to be

41:45.000 --> 41:47.280
 at the seven to eight hour transition point,

41:47.280 --> 41:48.440
 that's fine too.

41:48.440 --> 41:51.720
 Cold exposure in the form of cold showers or ice baths

41:51.720 --> 41:55.460
 or outside with minimal clothing,

41:55.460 --> 41:57.980
 appropriate yet minimal clothing.

41:57.980 --> 42:02.280
 Caffeine ingestion, fasting, for instance,

42:02.280 --> 42:05.560
 not ingesting calories also will lend itself

42:05.560 --> 42:08.720
 to increase norepinephrine, dopamine, et cetera.

42:08.720 --> 42:10.160
 If you are going to consume foods,

42:10.160 --> 42:12.400
 foods that are rich in things like tyrosine,

42:12.400 --> 42:14.560
 which is a precursor for dopamine,

42:14.560 --> 42:17.320
 you can look up which foods are high in tyrosine.

42:17.320 --> 42:19.680
 And for those of you that are interested in supplementation

42:19.680 --> 42:21.080
 and like to use those routes,

42:21.080 --> 42:25.740
 things like alpha-GPC or phenylethylamine or L-tyrosine,

42:25.740 --> 42:28.440
 if that's in keeping with what you're able to do,

42:28.440 --> 42:30.040
 of course, consult your doctor

42:30.040 --> 42:32.240
 if you're going to rely on supplementation.

42:32.240 --> 42:33.120
 What's this all about?

42:33.120 --> 42:37.060
 Well, the already elevated norepinephrine and dopamine,

42:37.060 --> 42:40.000
 the sunlight, exercise, cold exposure, caffeine,

42:40.000 --> 42:41.400
 tyrosine, et cetera,

42:41.400 --> 42:45.280
 all of those place the brain and body into a state

42:45.280 --> 42:48.280
 in which you are better able,

42:48.280 --> 42:52.400
 or I would say more easily able to engage in activities

42:52.400 --> 42:55.640
 that have a high degree of limbic friction

42:55.640 --> 42:58.740
 and where you need to override that limbic friction, right?

42:58.740 --> 43:00.660
 We've heard that the morning is kind of sacred,

43:00.660 --> 43:02.600
 conquer the hardest things first thing in the morning.

43:02.600 --> 43:05.800
 And that's been discussed in the pop psychology literature

43:05.800 --> 43:08.040
 and in the habit formation literature,

43:08.040 --> 43:11.080
 merely from the perspective of get it out of the way

43:11.080 --> 43:13.480
 so you can feel good about having done it.

43:13.480 --> 43:15.040
 But what I'm referring to is quite different.

43:15.040 --> 43:17.920
 What I'm referring to is a particular phase of day

43:17.920 --> 43:20.680
 that after rising, after waking up that is,

43:20.680 --> 43:24.120
 for zero to eight hours, right, in that first phase,

43:24.120 --> 43:27.480
 your whole system is action and focus oriented.

43:27.480 --> 43:30.320
 And we know that when you are action and focus oriented,

43:30.320 --> 43:32.520
 and because of the neurochemicals

43:32.520 --> 43:35.560
 that are naturally released into your brain and body,

43:35.560 --> 43:39.640
 that you will be more likely to overcome any limbic friction

43:39.640 --> 43:42.720
 that stands in the way of performing particular habits.

43:42.720 --> 43:46.080
 So as you list out or think about the various habits

43:46.080 --> 43:48.040
 that you'd like to adopt in your life,

43:49.140 --> 43:51.360
 take the habits for which you know

43:51.360 --> 43:53.520
 there's the highest degree of limbic friction.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.560
 They are the hardest for you to engage in.

43:55.560 --> 43:57.920
 They require the most activation energy

43:57.920 --> 44:01.920
 and put those in this zero to eight hours after waking.

44:01.920 --> 44:04.120
 This will greatly facilitate

44:04.120 --> 44:06.880
 your performance of those new habits.

44:06.880 --> 44:08.080
 I'm certain of that.

44:08.080 --> 44:09.560
 And in addition to that,

44:09.560 --> 44:12.560
 by doing them in this particular phase of the day,

44:12.560 --> 44:14.000
 not necessarily at the same time,

44:14.000 --> 44:15.440
 I mean, if you want to be very habitual

44:15.440 --> 44:17.960
 and you want to do the exercise or the sunlight viewing

44:17.960 --> 44:19.380
 always at the same time,

44:19.380 --> 44:22.020
 or you want to do, you want to drink your caffeine

44:22.020 --> 44:24.240
 always at the exact same time, that's fine.

44:24.240 --> 44:26.320
 But by placing them in this broader window

44:26.320 --> 44:28.860
 of zero to eight hours after waking,

44:28.860 --> 44:32.000
 what you're doing is you're creating task bracketing.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.220
 You're making it such that your nervous system will predict

44:35.220 --> 44:38.640
 when you are going to lean in against limbic friction

44:38.640 --> 44:41.400
 in order to perform particular types of habits.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.340
 And this is very different than saying,

44:43.340 --> 44:44.820
 I'm always going to run,

44:44.820 --> 44:49.120
 or I'm always going to study from 10 to 12 AM every morning.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.480
 That's great, and if you can do that, terrific.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.720
 But the literature indicates that people who do that,

44:53.720 --> 44:55.960
 who are very rigid about when they do things,

44:55.960 --> 44:58.460
 tend, because of context dependence,

44:58.460 --> 45:00.960
 to not necessarily stick to those habits over time.

45:00.960 --> 45:04.000
 Some people do, but many, many people don't.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.040
 So think about the hardest habits to form

45:06.040 --> 45:08.880
 and the habits that you most want to form

45:08.880 --> 45:11.640
 that are hardest for you to adopt and to maintain.

45:11.640 --> 45:14.960
 And I highly suggest placing those somewhere

45:14.960 --> 45:18.500
 within this phase one of zero to eight hours after waking.

45:18.500 --> 45:20.740
 Now, of course, some of the things I listed out,

45:20.740 --> 45:23.520
 sunlight viewing, exercise, cold exposure,

45:23.520 --> 45:24.620
 caffeine, fasting,

45:24.620 --> 45:27.080
 those might be the actual habits themselves.

45:27.080 --> 45:30.560
 But here I realize, or rather I want to acknowledge

45:30.560 --> 45:32.400
 that many people, including myself,

45:32.400 --> 45:34.700
 are doing some or all of these things already.

45:34.700 --> 45:36.760
 And many people, including myself,

45:36.760 --> 45:38.620
 are trying to adopt new habits

45:38.620 --> 45:40.400
 that don't fall into the category

45:40.400 --> 45:42.800
 of just trying to set your overall state.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.800
 Again, norepinephrine, dopamine,

45:44.800 --> 45:47.200
 and all these neural systems will be greatly elevated

45:47.200 --> 45:49.680
 in this zero to eight hours after waking.

45:49.680 --> 45:51.480
 However, the other things I mentioned,

45:51.480 --> 45:54.840
 sunlight exposure, exercise, cold exposure, caffeine,

45:54.840 --> 45:56.200
 fasting, if that's for you,

45:56.200 --> 45:58.620
 or if you're eating during that phase,

45:58.620 --> 46:01.080
 eating things that contain some or elevated levels

46:01.080 --> 46:04.900
 of tyrosine, maybe supplementing GPC or L-tyrosine, et cetera,

46:06.120 --> 46:09.760
 all of those things further facilitate the neurochemistry

46:09.760 --> 46:12.720
 and therefore the state of mind that's going to be ideal

46:12.720 --> 46:14.440
 for leaning into limbic friction

46:14.440 --> 46:16.140
 and overriding that limbic friction

46:16.140 --> 46:18.120
 so that you can regularly perform that habit.

46:18.120 --> 46:19.300
 What we're really talking about here

46:19.300 --> 46:21.280
 is leveraging neural systems

46:21.280 --> 46:24.120
 in order to help you make it more likely

46:24.120 --> 46:25.720
 that you're going to be able to engage

46:25.720 --> 46:27.640
 and maintain a particular habit.

46:27.640 --> 46:30.840
 So what I'm referring to as phase one of each day

46:30.840 --> 46:33.600
 is useful for acquiring certain habits,

46:33.600 --> 46:35.360
 but there are other phases of the day

46:35.360 --> 46:36.760
 and those turn out to be useful

46:36.760 --> 46:38.840
 for acquiring other types of habits.

46:39.680 --> 46:42.240
 Phase two, as I mentioned, is about,

46:42.240 --> 46:44.200
 again, these aren't specifics,

46:44.200 --> 46:48.640
 but about nine to 14 or 15 hours after waking.

46:48.640 --> 46:49.920
 During this phase of the day,

46:49.920 --> 46:53.480
 because of the circadian shifts in our biology,

46:53.480 --> 46:55.280
 the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine

46:55.280 --> 46:57.520
 that's circulating in our brain and bloodstream

46:57.520 --> 47:00.120
 tends to start to come down

47:00.120 --> 47:03.560
 and levels of cortisol tend to start to come down.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.000
 That's the ideal circumstance.

47:05.000 --> 47:07.520
 In fact, you don't really want elevated cortisol

47:07.520 --> 47:08.360
 late in the day.

47:08.360 --> 47:10.360
 That's actually a signature of depression and anxiety

47:10.360 --> 47:14.440
 and a number of other unfortunate things.

47:14.440 --> 47:17.740
 So nine to 14 hours after waking,

47:17.740 --> 47:19.600
 dopamine and norepinephrine and cortisol

47:19.600 --> 47:21.640
 are starting to taper down just naturally

47:21.640 --> 47:25.240
 and a different neuromodulator, serotonin,

47:25.240 --> 47:26.880
 is starting to rise.

47:26.880 --> 47:29.840
 Serotonin is definitely going to be highest

47:29.840 --> 47:31.940
 in this second half of the day

47:31.940 --> 47:36.680
 and tends to lend itself to a more relaxed state of being.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.120
 Now, of course, I do realize

47:38.120 --> 47:40.080
 that some people are less of morning people

47:40.080 --> 47:41.560
 and find that they really come alive

47:41.560 --> 47:42.620
 and awake in the afternoon,

47:42.620 --> 47:45.280
 but most people don't fall into that category.

47:45.280 --> 47:47.600
 Most people feel more alert early in the day,

47:47.600 --> 47:49.160
 even anxious early in the day,

47:49.160 --> 47:50.660
 and then as the afternoon progresses,

47:50.660 --> 47:52.560
 they tend to be a bit more sleepy,

47:52.560 --> 47:55.660
 a bit more relaxed, a bit more calm.

47:55.660 --> 47:58.760
 There are certain things that we all can and should do

47:58.760 --> 48:01.200
 during this phase two of each day

48:01.200 --> 48:04.880
 that lend themselves to a state of mind

48:04.880 --> 48:08.000
 and a state of body that is going to be beneficial

48:08.000 --> 48:10.300
 for the generation and consolidation

48:10.300 --> 48:11.960
 of certain types of habits.

48:11.960 --> 48:12.840
 What are those things?

48:12.840 --> 48:15.400
 First of all, as the day goes on,

48:15.400 --> 48:16.600
 you should try, if you can,

48:16.600 --> 48:20.080
 to start tapering the amount of light that you're viewing.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.440
 Now, this doesn't mean putting yourself into dim light

48:22.440 --> 48:24.960
 at three o'clock or four o'clock in the afternoon.

48:24.960 --> 48:26.520
 That's certainly not the case.

48:26.520 --> 48:29.180
 Simply that you want to start tapering off the amount

48:29.180 --> 48:30.800
 of really bright light that you're getting,

48:30.800 --> 48:32.560
 unless it's sunlight.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.200
 Talked about this before on the podcast,

48:34.200 --> 48:35.800
 but if you haven't heard,

48:35.800 --> 48:39.060
 viewing the sun as it's what we call low solar angle,

48:39.060 --> 48:41.120
 so as it's headed toward the horizon,

48:41.120 --> 48:42.880
 you don't necessarily have to watch the sunset,

48:42.880 --> 48:44.160
 although that can be nice,

48:44.160 --> 48:45.540
 but getting some sunlight in your eyes

48:45.540 --> 48:47.680
 in the second half of the day can also be beneficial

48:47.680 --> 48:51.040
 for a number of brain systems and psychological systems.

48:51.040 --> 48:52.640
 So you can get some sunlight in your eyes.

48:52.640 --> 48:55.520
 You can certainly have artificial lights on,

48:55.520 --> 48:57.400
 but you want to start dimming those lights

48:57.400 --> 48:59.660
 and bringing them actually physically lower in the room

48:59.660 --> 49:01.760
 because the neurons in your eye

49:01.760 --> 49:04.380
 that view the upper visual field,

49:04.380 --> 49:06.760
 they actually trigger this alertness mechanism

49:06.760 --> 49:07.600
 in the brain and body.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.160
 And in the second half of the day,

49:09.160 --> 49:11.360
 even if you're humming around and doing work

49:11.360 --> 49:14.120
 at three or four or five or even 7 p.m.,

49:14.120 --> 49:17.720
 you are probably headed towards sleep a few hours later.

49:17.720 --> 49:20.000
 So things like limiting the total amount of light

49:20.000 --> 49:24.200
 if you can, things like NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

49:24.200 --> 49:26.200
 another thing that I've talked about on this podcast,

49:26.200 --> 49:27.420
 if you haven't heard about this before,

49:27.420 --> 49:29.360
 non-sleep deep rest is an umbrella term

49:29.360 --> 49:32.640
 for things like meditation, for yoga nidra,

49:32.640 --> 49:35.280
 a very powerful science-supported tool

49:35.280 --> 49:37.720
 for teaching you how to relax,

49:37.720 --> 49:39.240
 things like self-hypnosis,

49:39.240 --> 49:40.840
 which might sound a little kooky to some of you,

49:40.840 --> 49:42.360
 but actually is a clinically-based tool

49:42.360 --> 49:44.640
 for which there's a lot of scientific literature.

49:44.640 --> 49:45.580
 If you're interested in that,

49:45.580 --> 49:47.760
 there's a great free resource called Reveri,

49:47.760 --> 49:50.160
 R-E-V-E-R-I.com.

49:50.160 --> 49:53.060
 There's a app for both Apple and Android.

49:53.060 --> 49:54.400
 This is an app that was developed

49:54.400 --> 49:55.860
 by colleagues of mine and researchers

49:55.860 --> 49:57.580
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

49:57.580 --> 50:00.880
 You can do these short 15-minute self-hypnosis scripts,

50:00.880 --> 50:01.720
 as they're called,

50:01.720 --> 50:03.820
 that can teach you how to relax yourself.

50:03.820 --> 50:07.200
 There's even ones for focus, for sleep, for chronic pain.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.040
 Again, all very strongly supported

50:09.040 --> 50:11.240
 by quality peer-reviewed literature.

50:11.240 --> 50:13.800
 So things like reverie, meditation,

50:13.800 --> 50:18.200
 things like heat and sauna, hot baths, hot showers,

50:18.200 --> 50:19.980
 those are terrific things to do

50:19.980 --> 50:21.740
 in the second half of the day.

50:21.740 --> 50:24.100
 They tend to support this serotonergic

50:24.100 --> 50:25.960
 or high serotonin-like state

50:25.960 --> 50:28.760
 and lend themselves to more calm and relaxation.

50:29.680 --> 50:31.800
 For those of you that are interested in supplementation,

50:31.800 --> 50:35.600
 there's always ashwagandha, which reduces cortisol.

50:35.600 --> 50:38.460
 Again, peaks in cortisol late in the afternoon and evening

50:38.460 --> 50:41.160
 are associated with depression, anxiety, and so forth.

50:41.160 --> 50:46.160
 Ashwagandha is a pretty potent cortisol-inhibiting tool.

50:46.720 --> 50:48.780
 I personally don't use it very often,

50:48.780 --> 50:50.700
 and I caution people about using it

50:50.700 --> 50:52.360
 for longer than two-week periods of time

50:52.360 --> 50:53.640
 without taking some breaks.

50:53.640 --> 50:56.960
 You can look up more about ashwagandha on examine.com.

50:56.960 --> 50:58.160
 There's a lot of terrific literature

50:58.160 --> 50:59.660
 with links to studies there.

50:59.660 --> 51:01.800
 But basically, this phase two of the day

51:01.800 --> 51:04.240
 is one in which you're alert, you are present,

51:04.240 --> 51:06.160
 you are working, you are engaging socially,

51:06.160 --> 51:07.000
 you're cooking dinner,

51:07.000 --> 51:09.080
 probably paying attention to a number of things,

51:09.080 --> 51:11.920
 but you should really be trying to taper off your stress level.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.800
 So how do you leverage phase two of the day

51:13.800 --> 51:15.680
 for habit formation?

51:15.680 --> 51:17.600
 Well, given what we know about the neurochemistry

51:17.600 --> 51:18.640
 of learning and memory,

51:18.640 --> 51:20.780
 given what we know about task formation

51:20.780 --> 51:23.640
 and its reliance on certain forms of neuroplasticity,

51:23.640 --> 51:26.140
 the second half of the day is a terrific time

51:26.140 --> 51:30.920
 to take on habits and things that you're already doing

51:30.920 --> 51:34.280
 that require very little override of limbic friction.

51:34.280 --> 51:37.760
 So these might be things that you could categorize

51:37.760 --> 51:40.260
 in common terms as kind of mellower activities.

51:40.260 --> 51:41.820
 It might be journaling.

51:41.820 --> 51:46.120
 It might be that you already are performing music

51:46.120 --> 51:48.680
 or I should say practicing music regularly,

51:48.680 --> 51:50.520
 but that there's a particular type of music

51:50.520 --> 51:51.680
 that is hard for you

51:51.680 --> 51:53.560
 or that you're working on a particular piece of music

51:53.560 --> 51:54.600
 or you're trying to learn a language,

51:54.600 --> 51:56.100
 something that's a little bit challenging,

51:56.100 --> 51:58.900
 but doesn't require a ton of energy

51:58.900 --> 52:01.080
 in order to override that limbic friction.

52:01.080 --> 52:03.600
 The second half of the day is a much better time to do that.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.520
 Less resistance, as we might say.

52:06.520 --> 52:09.000
 But of course, resistance has a neural substrate.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.640
 And the reason for doing those things

52:10.640 --> 52:11.960
 in the second part of the day,

52:11.960 --> 52:14.200
 the so-called phase two, as I've called it,

52:14.200 --> 52:15.040
 part of the day,

52:15.040 --> 52:17.800
 is because your ability to override resistance

52:17.800 --> 52:21.660
 is really diminished in this second phase of the day.

52:21.660 --> 52:23.320
 Some of you might say, well, wait,

52:23.320 --> 52:25.300
 I like to exercise in the second half of the day.

52:25.300 --> 52:26.960
 That's actually when I have the most energy.

52:26.960 --> 52:28.540
 That's when I feel warmer.

52:28.540 --> 52:29.800
 I'm not a morning exerciser.

52:29.800 --> 52:31.760
 That's absolutely fine.

52:31.760 --> 52:35.320
 What I'm referring to is the acquisition of new behaviors

52:35.320 --> 52:37.280
 and placing those consistently

52:37.280 --> 52:38.400
 at the second half of the day

52:38.400 --> 52:41.040
 in order to engage this task bracketing mechanisms

52:41.040 --> 52:42.920
 that I talked about before.

52:42.920 --> 52:44.640
 One of the hallmark features

52:44.640 --> 52:47.440
 of those basal ganglia circuits for go and no-go

52:47.440 --> 52:50.760
 is that they are associated with certain neurochemicals,

52:50.760 --> 52:52.880
 dopamine and serotonin, acetylcholine,

52:52.880 --> 52:54.480
 and other neurochemicals.

52:54.480 --> 52:57.000
 And by placing particular habits

52:57.000 --> 52:58.700
 at particular phases of the day,

52:58.700 --> 53:01.200
 those neurochemical states start to be associated

53:01.200 --> 53:04.360
 with the leaning in and the process of beginning and,

53:04.360 --> 53:06.840
 as I mentioned, ending those particular habits.

53:06.840 --> 53:09.720
 And in doing so, they shift the whole nervous system

53:09.720 --> 53:12.220
 toward being able to predict that certain things

53:12.220 --> 53:14.560
 are going to happen at particular times of day,

53:14.560 --> 53:16.680
 that you are going to be leaning very hard

53:16.680 --> 53:19.140
 against limbic friction early in the day in phase one,

53:19.140 --> 53:20.360
 and that you're going to be doing things

53:20.360 --> 53:22.860
 that require less conscious override

53:22.860 --> 53:24.240
 of limbic friction in phase two.

53:24.240 --> 53:28.180
 And in doing so, set up this task bracketing system

53:28.180 --> 53:31.140
 so that the individual habits that you're learning

53:31.140 --> 53:32.100
 or that you're trying to learn

53:32.100 --> 53:35.000
 have a much greater probability of being executed

53:35.000 --> 53:37.920
 and consolidated, meaning that pretty soon

53:37.920 --> 53:40.320
 they will just naturally become reflexive.

53:40.320 --> 53:44.000
 And as with phase one, many of the things that I mentioned

53:44.000 --> 53:47.680
 that support this, what I'm calling a serotonergic state

53:47.680 --> 53:50.540
 or a more relaxed state in phase two,

53:50.540 --> 53:53.520
 things like seeing some light in the afternoon,

53:53.520 --> 53:56.640
 but not a lot of bright light from artificial sources,

53:56.640 --> 54:00.600
 things like NSDR, things like heat and sauna,

54:00.600 --> 54:02.840
 hot baths, et cetera, ashwagandha.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.560
 Again, all of those things themselves

54:04.560 --> 54:06.960
 could be habits that you're trying to adopt, right?

54:06.960 --> 54:10.100
 In that case, do those if you'd like to explore them.

54:10.100 --> 54:12.960
 They are quite beneficial for a number of reasons,

54:12.960 --> 54:15.480
 not just related to execution of particular habits

54:15.480 --> 54:16.860
 in phase two of the day,

54:16.860 --> 54:19.300
 but also for improving quality of sleep

54:19.300 --> 54:20.960
 and consolidating any learning

54:20.960 --> 54:22.580
 that you might've triggered early in the day.

54:22.580 --> 54:23.640
 I've talked about that before,

54:23.640 --> 54:26.700
 but just briefly as a relevant aside,

54:26.700 --> 54:30.080
 neuroplasticity involves triggering the neuroplasticity,

54:30.080 --> 54:31.440
 setting it in motion,

54:31.440 --> 54:33.640
 but the actual rewiring of the brain

54:33.640 --> 54:35.160
 and the reconfiguration of neurons

54:35.160 --> 54:37.220
 that will allow that learning to be reflexive,

54:37.220 --> 54:39.440
 that actually occurs during states of deep rest,

54:39.440 --> 54:42.880
 like NSDR and like deep sleep.

54:42.880 --> 54:45.000
 And I should just mention for those of you

54:45.000 --> 54:47.600
 that can only exercise or prefer to exercise

54:47.600 --> 54:50.160
 in phase two of the day, right?

54:50.160 --> 54:53.240
 Nine to 14 hours or 15 hours after waking,

54:53.240 --> 54:54.920
 that's absolutely fine.

54:54.920 --> 54:58.220
 However, because of the importance of sleep

54:58.220 --> 55:00.240
 and in particular deep sleep throughout the night

55:00.240 --> 55:01.840
 for not just neuroplasticity,

55:01.840 --> 55:04.800
 but recovery of muscle and other tissues

55:04.800 --> 55:08.300
 that are taxed during physical exercise,

55:08.300 --> 55:10.240
 if you do train in phase two,

55:10.240 --> 55:12.580
 I highly recommend, highly recommend

55:12.580 --> 55:15.400
 that you start doing some sort of NSDR type activity

55:15.400 --> 55:17.280
 after you train within an hour or two,

55:17.280 --> 55:19.640
 because that will allow you to taper down and relax

55:19.640 --> 55:21.360
 so that you can get into the next phase

55:21.360 --> 55:23.680
 we're going to talk about, which is phase three.

55:23.680 --> 55:28.400
 Phase three of the 24 hour schedule runs from about 16

55:28.400 --> 55:30.380
 to 24 hours after waking.

55:31.300 --> 55:33.260
 During that period of time,

55:33.260 --> 55:35.200
 there are a few things that are going to support

55:35.200 --> 55:38.460
 being in a state of mind, state of body

55:38.460 --> 55:41.640
 that are going to allow neuroplasticity to occur,

55:41.640 --> 55:44.280
 that are going to allow the rewiring that you've triggered

55:44.280 --> 55:47.740
 during the waking part of the day to actually take place.

55:47.740 --> 55:51.240
 Those things are very low to no light,

55:51.240 --> 55:53.380
 meaning keeping your environment very dark

55:53.380 --> 55:54.680
 or very, very dim.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.640
 I don't think it's necessary to sleep in a room

55:57.640 --> 55:59.520
 that's complete blackness.

55:59.520 --> 56:01.560
 I think that's a little bit overkill,

56:01.560 --> 56:04.640
 but for most people keeping the room dark

56:04.640 --> 56:07.040
 and keeping the room temperature low

56:07.040 --> 56:10.000
 is very beneficial for getting and staying in deep sleep.

56:11.480 --> 56:14.120
 The body has to drop by about one to three degrees

56:14.120 --> 56:16.800
 in order to get into sleep and to stay asleep.

56:16.800 --> 56:19.560
 So low light, low temperature environment,

56:19.560 --> 56:21.400
 you can always pile on blankets of course,

56:21.400 --> 56:23.220
 if you don't want to be cold at night,

56:23.220 --> 56:24.360
 you want to be warm enough,

56:24.360 --> 56:26.480
 but you want your environment to be cold.

56:26.480 --> 56:29.640
 Typically people aren't eating in the middle of the night,

56:29.640 --> 56:32.420
 although one thing that can be useful is to make sure

56:32.420 --> 56:34.720
 that you're at least well fed enough

56:34.720 --> 56:38.080
 when you head into this third phase of every 24 hour day

56:38.080 --> 56:40.520
 that you're not awake because you're hungry.

56:40.520 --> 56:42.640
 Now, a lot of people recommend putting a gap

56:42.640 --> 56:44.000
 between your final bite of food

56:44.000 --> 56:45.440
 and when you go to sleep at night.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.500
 Some people will say that gap should be four hours,

56:47.500 --> 56:49.200
 other people say two hours.

56:49.200 --> 56:51.440
 If you're me, I generally have something, I don't know,

56:51.440 --> 56:54.180
 within two hours or 90 minutes of going to sleep,

56:54.180 --> 56:55.620
 but it's not a big meal, but that's just me.

56:55.620 --> 56:57.920
 And I fall asleep and stay asleep fine with that.

56:57.920 --> 57:00.440
 You have to experiment for yourself.

57:00.440 --> 57:02.500
 I've talked about supplements that can support sleep

57:02.500 --> 57:04.120
 in previous episodes of the podcast,

57:04.120 --> 57:07.480
 things like magnesium threonate or magnesium bisglycinate,

57:07.480 --> 57:09.960
 things like theanine, apigenin.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.640
 If you'd like to read more about those,

57:11.640 --> 57:12.960
 we actually have a newsletter

57:12.960 --> 57:14.440
 that I'll just quickly refer you to.

57:14.440 --> 57:17.620
 This is the Huberman Lab Neural Network newsletter.

57:17.620 --> 57:20.020
 You can sign up for it by going to hubermanlab.com.

57:20.020 --> 57:21.320
 It's very easy to find.

57:21.320 --> 57:23.360
 But even if you don't sign up,

57:23.360 --> 57:26.400
 you can go to the toolkit for sleep that's listed there.

57:26.400 --> 57:28.200
 And that toolkit is not just supplements.

57:28.200 --> 57:29.960
 That toolkit is a number of different things,

57:29.960 --> 57:32.800
 both behavioral and supplement-based

57:32.800 --> 57:34.420
 and nutrition-based, et cetera,

57:34.420 --> 57:37.080
 that can allow you to get into sleep

57:37.080 --> 57:38.680
 and to stay asleep more readily.

57:38.680 --> 57:39.820
 It's totally zero cost.

57:39.820 --> 57:41.840
 You can find that again at hubermanlab.com.

57:41.840 --> 57:43.920
 So things like low light, low temperature,

57:43.920 --> 57:45.300
 the supplements I mentioned,

57:45.300 --> 57:48.080
 adjusting your eating schedule appropriately,

57:48.080 --> 57:50.120
 obviously not drinking caffeine in the middle of the night

57:50.120 --> 57:51.000
 or too close to bed.

57:51.000 --> 57:51.920
 That's going to be critical.

57:51.920 --> 57:55.080
 In fact, ideally you wouldn't ingest any caffeine

57:55.080 --> 57:56.640
 in phase two of the day

57:56.640 --> 57:59.800
 so that you could get into this deeper state of rest

57:59.800 --> 58:02.820
 in which habit formation and neuroplasticity can occur.

58:04.400 --> 58:05.840
 What if you wake up, right?

58:05.840 --> 58:07.560
 The way I've cast phase three

58:07.560 --> 58:09.720
 is that you're supposed to be in this deep slumber.

58:09.720 --> 58:11.320
 You're not supposed to wake up at all.

58:11.320 --> 58:12.640
 You're supposed to be in low light

58:12.640 --> 58:13.840
 and your brain is rewiring

58:13.840 --> 58:16.720
 and those habits are getting consolidated, et cetera.

58:16.720 --> 58:18.120
 Well, if you're like me,

58:18.120 --> 58:19.580
 you probably get up once in the middle of the night.

58:19.580 --> 58:21.660
 Maybe you go use the restroom, perfectly normal,

58:21.660 --> 58:22.500
 perfectly normal,

58:22.500 --> 58:25.180
 but a lot of people have trouble falling back asleep.

58:25.180 --> 58:26.900
 Very important if you get up in the middle of the night

58:26.900 --> 58:28.160
 to use a minimum of light

58:28.160 --> 58:29.660
 in order to navigate your surroundings

58:29.660 --> 58:32.900
 just as much as you need in order to safely do so,

58:32.900 --> 58:35.720
 because light inhibits the hormone melatonin,

58:35.720 --> 58:37.120
 can make it very hard to fall back asleep

58:37.120 --> 58:38.840
 if you inhibit melatonin.

58:38.840 --> 58:40.560
 The effects of light inhibiting melatonin

58:40.560 --> 58:43.180
 are actually very potent, happens very, very quickly.

58:43.180 --> 58:45.460
 So try and keep the lights low.

58:45.460 --> 58:47.420
 And if you have trouble falling back asleep,

58:47.420 --> 58:49.240
 that's when you might also want to use

58:49.240 --> 58:51.120
 something like the Reverie app.

58:51.120 --> 58:52.360
 They have a sleep script there

58:52.360 --> 58:54.480
 that can hopefully help you get back to sleep

58:54.480 --> 58:55.880
 or something like NSDR.

58:55.880 --> 58:57.920
 You can find NSDR scripts on YouTube.

58:57.920 --> 58:59.240
 These are zero cost.

58:59.240 --> 59:00.800
 You can look up one that I particularly like

59:00.800 --> 59:02.320
 is NSDR Made For.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.040
 It's a company I'm associated with,

59:04.040 --> 59:06.200
 but the NSDR is completely zero cost.

59:06.200 --> 59:08.560
 And there are other things like Yoga Nidra,

59:08.560 --> 59:10.300
 which you can find scripts for elsewhere.

59:10.300 --> 59:13.040
 Again, all of these habits or these behaviors,

59:13.040 --> 59:14.800
 these do's and don'ts around phase three,

59:14.800 --> 59:17.360
 themselves might be habits

59:17.360 --> 59:19.560
 that you're trying to create for yourself.

59:19.560 --> 59:21.820
 But again, phase three is really about making sure

59:21.820 --> 59:24.120
 that whatever limbic friction you've been able

59:24.120 --> 59:27.360
 to override in phase one and trigger some new habit,

59:27.360 --> 59:31.080
 forcing yourself to write or forcing yourself to study

59:31.080 --> 59:32.480
 or forcing yourself to exercise

59:32.480 --> 59:35.120
 during that high limbic friction state.

59:35.120 --> 59:37.160
 And then whatever things you've been doing in phase two,

59:37.160 --> 59:38.980
 which are habits that hopefully have moved

59:38.980 --> 59:40.920
 a little bit further along the continuum

59:40.920 --> 59:44.100
 of newly formed versus all the way to reflexive,

59:44.100 --> 59:47.320
 or things that take less limbic friction in order to do,

59:47.320 --> 59:49.600
 phase three is when all of that gets really locked

59:49.600 --> 59:52.240
 into the nervous system through those Hebbian mechanisms

59:52.240 --> 59:55.080
 like NMDA receptors, et cetera, that I talked about before.

59:55.080 --> 59:58.720
 Again, neuroplasticity is the basis of habit formation

59:58.720 --> 1:00:01.220
 and neuroplasticity and the rewiring of neural circuits

1:00:01.220 --> 1:00:02.800
 happens in these states of deep sleep.

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:07.060
 So if you're not obeying this phase three,

1:00:07.060 --> 1:00:10.040
 if you're not giving phase three the materials it needs

1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:12.780
 and you're not avoiding the certain things like caffeine

1:00:12.780 --> 1:00:16.200
 and bright light and stress during phase three,

1:00:16.200 --> 1:00:19.360
 you're simply not going to be able to build those habits

1:00:19.360 --> 1:00:21.960
 that you've been working so hard to trigger in phase one

1:00:21.960 --> 1:00:23.160
 and phase two of the day.

1:00:24.180 --> 1:00:26.480
 Again, these are things that I've talked about

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:29.080
 in previous episodes of the podcast and elsewhere,

1:00:30.040 --> 1:00:32.500
 but really this is about habit formation.

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:35.040
 And the whole reason for placing particular types

1:00:35.040 --> 1:00:38.720
 of behaviors at particular phases of the day

1:00:38.720 --> 1:00:41.740
 is to set a framework for that task bracketing.

1:00:41.740 --> 1:00:44.140
 Again, task bracketing and those circuits

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:47.480
 of the basal ganglia indicate that it's not just

1:00:47.480 --> 1:00:51.320
 the neural circuits that are engaged by the task itself,

1:00:51.320 --> 1:00:53.600
 but the neural circuits that are engaged

1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:57.580
 before and after that task execution.

1:00:57.580 --> 1:00:59.620
 That's what gets consolidated.

1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:03.160
 So when you do things at particular phases of the day

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:05.920
 under particular conditions of neurochemistry,

1:01:05.920 --> 1:01:07.720
 what you're doing is you're giving the brain

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:10.920
 a very predictable set of sequences that during sleep,

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:13.680
 it can start to put into your hard drive,

1:01:13.680 --> 1:01:15.240
 if you will, it can really program it

1:01:15.240 --> 1:01:18.040
 into your nervous system so that within a short period

1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:22.240
 of time, hopefully within 18 or maybe even six days,

1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:24.180
 or who knows, maybe even fewer days,

1:01:24.180 --> 1:01:26.600
 you'll find that executing those behaviors

1:01:26.600 --> 1:01:28.480
 is very, very straightforward for you

1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:32.000
 and that you won't have to feel so much limbic friction

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.120
 or override so much limbic friction.

1:01:34.120 --> 1:01:36.720
 Some of you are probably asking, okay,

1:01:36.720 --> 1:01:40.840
 if I perform a particular habit during phase one,

1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:42.960
 and then I do other habits during phase two,

1:01:42.960 --> 1:01:45.680
 and I eventually get to the point where I'm engaging

1:01:45.680 --> 1:01:49.480
 in those habits in a pretty effortless way,

1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:51.560
 do I keep them in the same phase of the day?

1:01:51.560 --> 1:01:54.560
 And the good news is the literature says it doesn't matter.

1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:57.240
 And in fact, moving that particular habit

1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:00.240
 around somewhat randomly can actually be beneficial to you

1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:02.600
 because actually moving it from one time of day

1:02:02.600 --> 1:02:05.220
 to the other is that context independence

1:02:05.220 --> 1:02:07.460
 that we really are seeking.

1:02:07.460 --> 1:02:11.000
 By being able to do the same thing that we want to do,

1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.900
 regardless of time of day or circumstances,

1:02:13.900 --> 1:02:15.820
 that's how we know that we've achieved

1:02:15.820 --> 1:02:17.160
 a real habit formation.

1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:19.800
 That's how we know that the habit has been moved

1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:21.840
 into certain components of our neural circuitry

1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:24.560
 that just allow us to do it what seems like reflexively,

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:27.320
 although earlier I pointed out that these aren't reflexes

1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:29.400
 in the traditional sense.

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:32.500
 The reason for that is that this brain area,

1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:34.280
 the hippocampus that many of you know

1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:35.940
 is associated with learning and memory

1:02:35.940 --> 1:02:38.320
 is not actually where memories are stored.

1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:40.720
 The hippocampus is where memories are formed.

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:43.200
 It's where procedures, like I talked about before,

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:45.200
 procedural memory of how you're going to execute

1:02:45.200 --> 1:02:47.720
 a particular sequence where that's maintained.

1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:49.600
 So like if we use the recipe model,

1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:51.560
 that's where the recipe is maintained

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:53.720
 until you know how to cook that dish.

1:02:53.720 --> 1:02:58.420
 And then the procedural memory literally migrates off

1:02:58.420 --> 1:03:00.220
 into a different set of neural circuits,

1:03:00.220 --> 1:03:02.480
 which are the neural circuits of the neocortex,

1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:05.560
 where we have maps of sensory experience,

1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:08.500
 maps of all kinds of experiences,

1:03:08.500 --> 1:03:10.440
 including motor maps of how to execute things.

1:03:10.440 --> 1:03:12.980
 So we use one part of the brain to learn something,

1:03:12.980 --> 1:03:14.960
 but then that information in the form

1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:16.920
 of the electrical activity of neurons

1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:20.080
 is passed off to a different brain area.

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:22.000
 Now, the neurons themselves don't move

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:23.440
 from the hippocampus to the cortex.

1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:24.280
 That doesn't happen.

1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:26.320
 What happens is the signals,

1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:28.040
 the sequence of electrical firing,

1:03:28.040 --> 1:03:31.160
 much like a script for a movie

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:34.600
 or the notes on a sheet of paper

1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:36.440
 for a particular musical piece

1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:39.080
 is transferred off to a different brain area.

1:03:39.080 --> 1:03:41.960
 So that whole process of really leaning

1:03:41.960 --> 1:03:44.080
 into something that's hard, then it becoming easier.

1:03:44.080 --> 1:03:45.800
 And then eventually that thing becoming more

1:03:45.800 --> 1:03:48.080
 or less reflexive involves a migration

1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:49.680
 of the information in the brain.

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:53.240
 And once it's migrated out to a different location

1:03:53.240 --> 1:03:54.680
 in the brain, at that point,

1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:56.980
 it's achieved context independence.

1:03:56.980 --> 1:04:01.360
 It doesn't have to be bracketed by your caffeine

1:04:01.360 --> 1:04:02.200
 and your lunch.

1:04:02.200 --> 1:04:05.000
 It doesn't have to occur immediately

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:06.800
 after your afternoon NSDR,

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:09.760
 but before your four o'clock meeting on Zoom

1:04:09.760 --> 1:04:11.080
 or something of that sort.

1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:14.160
 So all this is to say that once something

1:04:14.160 --> 1:04:16.080
 has become reflexive,

1:04:16.080 --> 1:04:18.160
 you should play with it a little bit about time of day.

1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:21.440
 If you want to keep it in the same phase of day, great.

1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:23.560
 But if you one day decide

1:04:23.560 --> 1:04:25.000
 you're going to exercise in the afternoon,

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.960
 next day you decide you're going to exercise in the morning

1:04:26.960 --> 1:04:28.700
 and that's the habit that you're concerned with,

1:04:28.700 --> 1:04:29.540
 that's terrific.

1:04:29.540 --> 1:04:30.620
 If you're able to do that,

1:04:30.620 --> 1:04:32.820
 that means that it's truly achieved context independence.

1:04:32.820 --> 1:04:35.400
 It means that you have officially formed that habit.

1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:37.480
 And as I mentioned earlier,

1:04:37.480 --> 1:04:39.620
 much earlier at the beginning of the episode,

1:04:39.620 --> 1:04:42.200
 the strength of a habit is dictated

1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:45.680
 by how much limbic friction, that was one,

1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:48.640
 and how much context dependence there is.

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:51.300
 So when it doesn't take much activation energy

1:04:51.300 --> 1:04:53.440
 to get into the execution of that habit,

1:04:53.440 --> 1:04:55.260
 and you can do it in any context,

1:04:55.260 --> 1:04:58.000
 well, then you have formed a habit.

1:04:58.000 --> 1:04:59.440
 We really can't have a discussion

1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:02.240
 about learning anything, habits or otherwise,

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:05.480
 unless we talk about reward prediction error.

1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:07.020
 Reward prediction error

1:05:07.020 --> 1:05:09.280
 is associated with the molecule dopamine.

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.540
 Although I should say there are other neurochemicals

1:05:11.540 --> 1:05:12.420
 in our brain and body

1:05:12.420 --> 1:05:16.020
 that are also related to reward prediction error.

1:05:16.020 --> 1:05:20.520
 But reward prediction error is a very good system,

1:05:20.520 --> 1:05:22.900
 or I should say a lens through which to think about

1:05:22.900 --> 1:05:25.220
 whether or not we should reward ourselves

1:05:25.220 --> 1:05:27.680
 for performing a given habit.

1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:29.280
 And this is a much larger discussion

1:05:29.280 --> 1:05:31.320
 that actually relates to things like parenting

1:05:31.320 --> 1:05:32.880
 and self-regulation.

1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:35.720
 Should we reward kids just for effort?

1:05:35.720 --> 1:05:37.840
 Should we reward ourselves just for effort?

1:05:37.840 --> 1:05:38.760
 What should we reward?

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:40.120
 How much should we reward ourselves?

1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:41.800
 When should we withdraw reward?

1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:42.920
 Should we use punishment?

1:05:42.920 --> 1:05:43.760
 These kinds of things.

1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:45.340
 This is a vast literature.

1:05:45.340 --> 1:05:47.760
 We don't have time to go into all the details,

1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:51.880
 but the notion of reward prediction error is so powerful

1:05:51.880 --> 1:05:54.880
 that it can predict most, if not all forms of learning,

1:05:54.880 --> 1:05:56.600
 including habit formation.

1:05:56.600 --> 1:05:59.520
 And you can deploy or use particular features

1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:01.080
 of reward prediction error

1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:03.260
 if you would like to reinforce

1:06:03.260 --> 1:06:07.200
 or accelerate the formation of certain habits.

1:06:07.200 --> 1:06:10.880
 So reward prediction error, quite simply,

1:06:10.880 --> 1:06:15.880
 is if you expect a reward and the reward comes,

1:06:15.920 --> 1:06:17.980
 a particular behavior that was associated

1:06:17.980 --> 1:06:21.480
 with generating that reward is more likely to occur again.

1:06:21.480 --> 1:06:23.360
 That's pretty straightforward.

1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:26.680
 However, the amount of reward

1:06:26.680 --> 1:06:29.100
 in the form of this molecule dopamine

1:06:29.100 --> 1:06:32.960
 that you will experience is even greater

1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:37.320
 if a reward arrives that's unexpected, okay?

1:06:37.320 --> 1:06:38.800
 So let me repeat that again.

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:41.440
 If I think that something's coming

1:06:41.440 --> 1:06:43.540
 that's going to be great,

1:06:43.540 --> 1:06:46.200
 that let's say I lean into a habit,

1:06:46.200 --> 1:06:48.360
 I managed to override my limbic friction,

1:06:48.360 --> 1:06:51.260
 and I'm doing my 45 minutes of writing in the morning

1:06:51.260 --> 1:06:52.760
 with no phone and no internet,

1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:54.520
 and I'm getting toward the end and I'm anticipating,

1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:55.560
 oh, I'm actually doing this.

1:06:55.560 --> 1:06:56.400
 This is great.

1:06:56.400 --> 1:06:57.220
 I did it.

1:06:57.220 --> 1:06:58.480
 I'm feeling really, really good.

1:06:58.480 --> 1:06:59.360
 I finish.

1:06:59.360 --> 1:07:03.320
 I definitely will receive a dopamine reward.

1:07:03.320 --> 1:07:04.600
 I'll make my own dopamine reward.

1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:05.440
 That's where it comes from.

1:07:05.440 --> 1:07:07.500
 Remember, this is all internal.

1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:11.240
 However, I will also receive dopamine reward

1:07:11.240 --> 1:07:14.640
 if unexpectedly something positive happens.

1:07:14.640 --> 1:07:19.040
 And typically, if something unexpected but positive happens,

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:21.120
 the amount of dopamine reward that we get

1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:24.320
 is actually much greater than in any other conditions.

1:07:24.320 --> 1:07:26.560
 However, it's hard to surprise yourself

1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:29.140
 about a behavior that you're deliberately engaging in.

1:07:29.140 --> 1:07:31.280
 So that becomes a bit of a tricky one.

1:07:32.180 --> 1:07:34.360
 Reward prediction error also says

1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:39.360
 that if we expect a reward and the reward doesn't come,

1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:41.580
 that the pattern of dopamine release

1:07:41.580 --> 1:07:43.960
 will follow a particular contour.

1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:45.520
 And that contour is very important.

1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:47.180
 Here's how it goes.

1:07:47.180 --> 1:07:50.120
 Let's say that I'm writing

1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:52.720
 and I'm about 30 or 45 minutes in,

1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:53.800
 and I'm thinking, oh, this is great.

1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:55.320
 I'm actually, I managed to do this.

1:07:55.320 --> 1:07:59.440
 I'm succeeding in executing the behaviors that I need to

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:01.720
 in order to perform this habit.

1:08:01.720 --> 1:08:03.420
 I'm overriding limbic friction.

1:08:04.240 --> 1:08:07.080
 Just that series of thoughts will start to generate

1:08:07.080 --> 1:08:09.700
 a dopamine release within my brain and body.

1:08:09.700 --> 1:08:12.660
 However, if at the 50-minute mark,

1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:16.240
 the phone rings and I pick up the phone

1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:18.680
 or I break my own protocol,

1:08:18.680 --> 1:08:20.360
 I break my own self-discipline

1:08:20.360 --> 1:08:22.640
 and I go on and check social media

1:08:22.640 --> 1:08:25.280
 or I do something that takes me out of that,

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:28.640
 what's going to happen is that my level of dopamine

1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:31.820
 is actually going to drop below the baseline,

1:08:31.820 --> 1:08:34.040
 meaning below the level of dopamine I had

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:38.240
 before I even started the habit execution, okay?

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:41.020
 So what this is, is this is a system

1:08:41.020 --> 1:08:43.720
 that predicts whether or not rewards are going to come.

1:08:44.780 --> 1:08:46.560
 When we think a reward is going to come,

1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:48.680
 it starts to actually arrive earlier

1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:50.000
 in the form of dopamine release.

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.680
 This is the feeling that we experience

1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:55.000
 as in positive anticipation.

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.540
 You tell a kid, hey, we're going to go to the amusement park

1:08:57.540 --> 1:08:59.000
 or we're going to go get ice cream.

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.280
 They haven't had the ice cream yet.

1:09:00.280 --> 1:09:02.280
 They're not at the amusement park, but they're excited.

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:04.840
 The dopamine release comes earlier, okay?

1:09:04.840 --> 1:09:07.000
 They get to the amusement park or they get the ice cream,

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.360
 they will also have some dopamine release

1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:10.800
 associated with that.

1:09:10.800 --> 1:09:12.480
 But most of it, believe it or not,

1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:14.440
 came in the form of the anticipation.

1:09:14.440 --> 1:09:16.440
 And dopamine has some qualities that make

1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:18.520
 the actual ice cream and the actual amusement park

1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:21.720
 experience more pleasureful than it would be

1:09:21.720 --> 1:09:24.020
 had that dopamine release not happened.

1:09:24.020 --> 1:09:25.160
 Now, of course, the other way to do it

1:09:25.160 --> 1:09:26.080
 is to surprise a kid.

1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:29.240
 You tell them, listen, we're going to the class

1:09:29.240 --> 1:09:30.280
 that you absolutely hate,

1:09:30.280 --> 1:09:31.840
 or we're going to go see the person

1:09:31.840 --> 1:09:33.140
 that you absolutely despise,

1:09:33.140 --> 1:09:34.520
 and then you drive them to the amusement park.

1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:37.080
 That's the big release of dopamine.

1:09:37.080 --> 1:09:39.360
 But reward prediction error also says

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:41.760
 that if you tell the kid or yourself,

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:43.080
 okay, we're headed to the amusement park,

1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:44.320
 we're going to get some ice cream,

1:09:44.320 --> 1:09:45.320
 they're really, really excited,

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:47.540
 and then you get there and it's closed

1:09:47.540 --> 1:09:49.320
 or they're not letting any more people in,

1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:52.380
 well, then the dopamine level drops way below what it was

1:09:52.380 --> 1:09:54.520
 before you told them that you were headed there, okay?

1:09:54.520 --> 1:09:55.840
 I've given a number of different examples

1:09:55.840 --> 1:09:57.160
 that hopefully make this clear.

1:09:57.160 --> 1:10:01.400
 Reward prediction error governs virtually all aspects

1:10:01.400 --> 1:10:04.160
 of effort and all aspects of learning.

1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:05.000
 Why?

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.800
 Because when dopamine is released in the brain and body,

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:10.440
 the neural circuits of our brain and body change.

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:12.600
 There's a state change.

1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:16.420
 Our overlevel, excuse me, our overall level of energy,

1:10:16.420 --> 1:10:18.580
 but also the sorts of sensory events

1:10:18.580 --> 1:10:20.480
 that we're paying attention to changes

1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:23.440
 when there's a lot of dopamine in our system.

1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:25.800
 Now, you can leverage this for habit formation.

1:10:26.760 --> 1:10:28.460
 Think back to task bracketing.

1:10:29.880 --> 1:10:32.080
 Think back to limbic friction.

1:10:32.080 --> 1:10:35.240
 If you are considering adopting a new habit

1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:37.040
 or if you are trying to break a habit,

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:38.480
 something we haven't talked too much about,

1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:39.680
 but we will in a moment,

1:10:40.880 --> 1:10:43.200
 it's very useful to think not just about

1:10:43.200 --> 1:10:46.320
 the procedural aspects of what you're going to do,

1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:50.920
 but also think about the events that precede and follow

1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:54.600
 that particular habit and the execution,

1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:57.720
 or at least the effort to execute that habit.

1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:00.600
 What you're doing is you're casting a kind of a spotlight

1:11:00.600 --> 1:11:03.840
 around a bin of time or a set of events

1:11:03.840 --> 1:11:06.020
 for which dopamine can be associated.

1:11:06.020 --> 1:11:08.120
 What does this look like in the practical sense?

1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:09.520
 Well, again, I'll just try and use

1:11:09.520 --> 1:11:11.080
 very simple, concrete examples,

1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:12.720
 but this could carry over to anything.

1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:15.880
 Let's say I were somebody who has a hard time

1:11:15.880 --> 1:11:18.300
 getting in that 30 to 60 minutes

1:11:18.300 --> 1:11:21.640
 of zone two cardiovascular exercise mid-morning.

1:11:21.640 --> 1:11:22.960
 This is actually an issue for me.

1:11:22.960 --> 1:11:24.800
 I much prefer to do resistance exercise

1:11:24.800 --> 1:11:26.040
 than cardiovascular exercise,

1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:26.880
 although once I do it,

1:11:26.880 --> 1:11:29.680
 I always feel much better that I have done it.

1:11:31.880 --> 1:11:35.800
 What I should do is positively anticipate

1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:39.840
 the onset and the offset of that session, right?

1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:43.720
 So thinking about leaning into the effort,

1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:46.280
 going out and doing that zone two cardio session,

1:11:46.280 --> 1:11:48.360
 and I should think about how I'm going to feel after.

1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:50.800
 So not just thinking about how great I'm going to feel after

1:11:50.800 --> 1:11:54.400
 but also thinking about how hard it's going to be

1:11:54.400 --> 1:11:57.000
 at the beginning and then trying to reward myself

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.080
 subjectively for the entire experience.

1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:01.840
 In other words, start rewarding task bracketing

1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:06.520
 in addition to rewarding the execution of the habit itself.

1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:07.600
 Now, some of you might be saying,

1:12:07.600 --> 1:12:09.200
 well, wait, this is all self-talk.

1:12:09.200 --> 1:12:10.680
 This is just positive self-talk,

1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:12.620
 but it's not positive self-talk.

1:12:12.620 --> 1:12:14.340
 It's not saying, you know,

1:12:14.340 --> 1:12:16.620
 I feel so great about doing something that I actually hate.

1:12:16.620 --> 1:12:17.600
 You can't lie to yourself,

1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:19.080
 or you're welcome to lie to yourself,

1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:20.600
 but the neuroscience literature,

1:12:20.600 --> 1:12:22.100
 the literature of growth mindset,

1:12:22.100 --> 1:12:24.040
 all the literature basically of mindset

1:12:24.040 --> 1:12:26.160
 speaks to the fact that when you lie to yourself,

1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:27.240
 you know you're lying

1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:30.360
 and you actually set up the opposite of a reward system.

1:12:30.360 --> 1:12:33.000
 So you have to be brutally honest with yourself

1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:34.360
 that for instance,

1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:37.200
 I don't like initiating this cardiovascular exercise,

1:12:37.200 --> 1:12:39.800
 but I do like the fact that I've done it after I've done it.

1:12:39.800 --> 1:12:40.880
 So what you are doing

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:43.620
 is you are applying reward prediction error

1:12:43.620 --> 1:12:46.160
 to the entire sequence of things that's involved

1:12:46.160 --> 1:12:49.160
 in getting into the habit execution,

1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:51.040
 getting through the habit execution

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:53.120
 and getting out of the habit execution.

1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:54.160
 How do you do this?

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:57.080
 Well, I take us back to our procedural

1:12:57.080 --> 1:13:00.320
 memory visualization exercise that we talked about earlier.

1:13:00.320 --> 1:13:02.060
 When I talked about it in that context,

1:13:02.060 --> 1:13:04.880
 I talked about walking through mentally

1:13:04.880 --> 1:13:06.920
 the series of steps that's required

1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:08.140
 to perform a particular habit.

1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:10.140
 So in the case of the zone two cardio thing,

1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:11.600
 it would be, okay, I'm going to put on my shoes.

1:13:11.600 --> 1:13:12.600
 Then I'm going to head out the door.

1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:13.880
 Then I'm going to drive up the road.

1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:15.200
 There's a particular canyon near here

1:13:15.200 --> 1:13:17.680
 that if I'm going to run, I happen to like running

1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:20.540
 or I don't hate running enough that I tend to do it.

1:13:20.540 --> 1:13:23.280
 Going through that, heading back, et cetera, et cetera.

1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:25.560
 That's great, but even better

1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:27.800
 would be to broaden the time bin

1:13:27.800 --> 1:13:30.000
 and start to positively anticipate

1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.300
 the period headed into the habit.

1:13:33.300 --> 1:13:35.040
 So even before you put on your shoes,

1:13:35.040 --> 1:13:39.140
 the fact that you are successfully placing the habit in,

1:13:39.140 --> 1:13:42.200
 in this case, phase one of the day,

1:13:42.200 --> 1:13:44.880
 and that afterwards I'm going to feel

1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:46.920
 a particular set of positive benefits,

1:13:46.920 --> 1:13:48.400
 elevated mood, et cetera.

1:13:48.400 --> 1:13:50.480
 I like being hungry and typically after exercise,

1:13:50.480 --> 1:13:52.700
 I'm hungry, so I like being hungry because I like eating.

1:13:52.700 --> 1:13:54.280
 And so there's a whole set of things

1:13:54.280 --> 1:13:55.880
 that link up with one another.

1:13:55.880 --> 1:13:57.600
 So I'm not just thinking about habit execution

1:13:57.600 --> 1:13:59.680
 as this isolated little set of events

1:13:59.680 --> 1:14:01.240
 or this little time bin,

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:04.160
 but rather I'm drawing a larger envelope around it

1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:06.680
 and starting to positively associate dopamine reward

1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:08.680
 with that larger envelope.

1:14:08.680 --> 1:14:09.880
 And for those of you that are thinking,

1:14:09.880 --> 1:14:12.480
 well, this is just a psychological trick.

1:14:12.480 --> 1:14:14.480
 This is sort of like lying to yourself.

1:14:14.480 --> 1:14:17.960
 It's not because you're not actually contradicting the fact

1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:19.780
 that some of this is unpleasant.

1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:21.960
 What you're doing is you're taking this entire series

1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:23.960
 of events, what I'm calling this kind of time envelope,

1:14:23.960 --> 1:14:26.560
 and you're associating it with a particular reward

1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:28.940
 that comes later, which for me would be the feeling

1:14:28.940 --> 1:14:31.400
 that I've completed this, right?

1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:33.240
 Because for me, that's usually a good feeling.

1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:35.600
 So reward prediction error is beautiful,

1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:39.000
 not just because it's a sort of math of anticipation

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:42.400
 and reward or a math of anticipation and disappointment.

1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:45.420
 It's beautiful because you can stretch out

1:14:45.420 --> 1:14:47.640
 or make more narrow the time bins

1:14:47.640 --> 1:14:50.100
 in which reward prediction error works.

1:14:50.100 --> 1:14:51.680
 Reward prediction error is the way

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:54.600
 in which people navigate four-year degrees, right?

1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:57.640
 I mean, you go, sure, final exam to final exam, et cetera,

1:14:57.640 --> 1:14:59.520
 but ultimately there's a big payoff at the end

1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:02.400
 and it's all basically for that big payoff.

1:15:02.400 --> 1:15:04.120
 And of course I understand that it's the journey,

1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:06.600
 not the destination, but let's face it for a lot of us,

1:15:06.600 --> 1:15:08.680
 goals and habits are about achieving

1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:10.260
 some sort of destination.

1:15:10.260 --> 1:15:11.840
 In the case of zone two cardio, for me,

1:15:11.840 --> 1:15:15.160
 it's about trying to stay alive for as long as I can,

1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:17.600
 as long as I can with vitality that is.

1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:20.120
 And it's also the fact that if I'm doing that,

1:15:20.120 --> 1:15:22.600
 I get to eat the foods that I like,

1:15:22.600 --> 1:15:23.920
 I tend to be able to eat more,

1:15:23.920 --> 1:15:25.800
 which I happen to really enjoy eating so much so

1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:27.640
 that I'd like it just as an activity.

1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:29.500
 So basically what you're trying to do

1:15:29.500 --> 1:15:32.280
 is not restrict your thinking to just the habit

1:15:32.280 --> 1:15:33.460
 that you're trying to form,

1:15:33.460 --> 1:15:36.160
 but rather to grab a hold of the timing

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:38.840
 before and after that particular habit

1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:41.540
 and start to positively associate reward mechanisms

1:15:41.540 --> 1:15:44.040
 in your brain with that entire time bin.

1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:46.680
 This is a very useful and very powerful tool

1:15:46.680 --> 1:15:48.360
 in order to form habits.

1:15:48.360 --> 1:15:50.520
 And I should say that it's not something

1:15:50.520 --> 1:15:52.040
 that comes naturally to most people.

1:15:52.040 --> 1:15:53.520
 In fact, even as I describe it,

1:15:53.520 --> 1:15:55.560
 you might find it's still a little bit abstract,

1:15:55.560 --> 1:15:57.080
 but what I encourage you to do

1:15:57.080 --> 1:15:59.320
 if you are finding it to be a little bit vague

1:15:59.320 --> 1:16:02.080
 would be to pick the habit that you want to form,

1:16:02.080 --> 1:16:04.560
 write down or think about very concretely

1:16:04.560 --> 1:16:06.260
 what is the sequence of steps involved

1:16:06.260 --> 1:16:08.200
 in the execution of that habit,

1:16:08.200 --> 1:16:10.200
 and then write down or think about

1:16:10.200 --> 1:16:11.620
 what is the sequence of events

1:16:11.620 --> 1:16:13.500
 that need to precede that habit,

1:16:13.500 --> 1:16:16.100
 maybe the immediate 10 or 15 minutes before,

1:16:16.100 --> 1:16:18.240
 as well as the immediate sequence of events

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:21.280
 and or feelings that will occur after that habit,

1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:24.860
 and then call the whole thing a habit execution,

1:16:24.860 --> 1:16:29.080
 the whole thing a effort to engage in that particular habit.

1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:32.040
 And in doing that and in positively associating

1:16:32.040 --> 1:16:33.940
 with the idea that you're going to complete

1:16:33.940 --> 1:16:35.440
 that entire sequence,

1:16:35.440 --> 1:16:37.520
 you will engage reward prediction error

1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:40.140
 in the proper way that the dopamine surge

1:16:40.140 --> 1:16:41.880
 can lend itself toward motivation.

1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:45.480
 Because ultimately dopamine is not about feeling good,

1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:46.960
 it's about feeling motivated.

1:16:46.960 --> 1:16:48.400
 This is something that I've talked about

1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:49.400
 numerous times before,

1:16:49.400 --> 1:16:51.760
 but dopamine, contrary to popular belief,

1:16:51.760 --> 1:16:55.200
 is not a reward molecule as much as is a molecule

1:16:55.200 --> 1:16:57.340
 of motivation and drive.

1:16:57.340 --> 1:17:00.420
 And the natural consequence of doing the exercise

1:17:00.420 --> 1:17:03.560
 I just described of writing things out that precede,

1:17:03.560 --> 1:17:05.660
 are involved in the immediate execution of the habit

1:17:05.660 --> 1:17:07.220
 and follow the habit,

1:17:07.220 --> 1:17:11.080
 will allow you to experience an increase in energy

1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:13.480
 and thereby an increase in likelihood

1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:14.520
 that you're going to engage

1:17:14.520 --> 1:17:16.460
 in that entire sequence of events.

1:17:16.460 --> 1:17:18.820
 And the reason for that is that dopamine gives us energy.

1:17:18.820 --> 1:17:22.160
 And the reason for that is that the molecule epinephrine,

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:24.860
 adrenaline, is actually manufactured from dopamine.

1:17:24.860 --> 1:17:27.080
 Biochemically, it comes from dopamine.

1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:28.720
 So dopamine is powerful

1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:32.280
 and you can access more dopamine around

1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:34.460
 even habits that you haven't yet formed

1:17:34.460 --> 1:17:36.440
 by taking this broader time envelope

1:17:36.440 --> 1:17:39.680
 and task bracketing that specific task execution

1:17:39.680 --> 1:17:41.300
 or habit execution.

1:17:41.300 --> 1:17:43.160
 Way back at the beginning of the episode,

1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:46.120
 I promised you that I would deliver two programs

1:17:46.120 --> 1:17:49.320
 that are geared towards habit formation.

1:17:49.320 --> 1:17:51.340
 And I promised that I would give you ways

1:17:51.340 --> 1:17:53.620
 in which you could gauge whether or not certain habits

1:17:53.620 --> 1:17:56.980
 had moved from high effort,

1:17:56.980 --> 1:18:00.160
 what I call high limbic friction, to reflexive.

1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:02.940
 We talked about a number of ways to gauge that.

1:18:02.940 --> 1:18:04.520
 In researching this episode,

1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:07.480
 I found a tremendous number of different systems

1:18:07.480 --> 1:18:08.500
 for habit formation.

1:18:08.500 --> 1:18:10.420
 It's really amazing how much is out there.

1:18:10.420 --> 1:18:12.220
 There are ones that are 60 days to this

1:18:12.220 --> 1:18:14.580
 or 21 days to that or 18 days to this.

1:18:14.580 --> 1:18:16.320
 I mean, it's just rampant

1:18:16.320 --> 1:18:18.180
 in the popular psychology literature

1:18:18.180 --> 1:18:19.780
 and in the self-help literature.

1:18:21.180 --> 1:18:23.420
 I want to spell out a particular system

1:18:23.420 --> 1:18:25.080
 that I think could be very useful

1:18:25.080 --> 1:18:27.500
 to most if not all people

1:18:27.500 --> 1:18:31.100
 that's rooted in the biology of habit formation,

1:18:31.100 --> 1:18:33.180
 rooted in the psychology of habit formation,

1:18:33.180 --> 1:18:34.860
 and that is entirely compatible

1:18:34.860 --> 1:18:37.380
 with that phase one, phase two, phase three type program

1:18:37.380 --> 1:18:38.980
 that I talked about earlier,

1:18:38.980 --> 1:18:42.180
 but encompasses a bit of a longer time scale

1:18:42.180 --> 1:18:46.540
 and really arrives at a kind of a system, if you will,

1:18:46.540 --> 1:18:48.780
 for how to build in habits

1:18:48.780 --> 1:18:51.060
 and then to test whether or not those habits

1:18:51.060 --> 1:18:52.460
 have really stuck

1:18:52.460 --> 1:18:55.140
 and whether or not they're likely to stick going forward.

1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:58.440
 And so this is, at least for sake of this example,

1:18:58.440 --> 1:18:59.660
 a 21-day system.

1:18:59.660 --> 1:19:02.700
 I picked 21 days because that seems to be the average

1:19:02.700 --> 1:19:06.920
 or most typical system for engaging neuroplasticity

1:19:06.920 --> 1:19:08.900
 as it relates to the formation of new habits.

1:19:08.900 --> 1:19:10.620
 This 21-day system actually is one

1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:12.340
 that someone I know very well uses

1:19:12.340 --> 1:19:13.980
 and has used for a long time.

1:19:13.980 --> 1:19:16.180
 They actually use them, their kids use it as well,

1:19:16.180 --> 1:19:18.220
 and it has a certain elegance to it.

1:19:18.220 --> 1:19:19.760
 And I think as I describe it,

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:22.500
 that elegance will begin to reveal itself.

1:19:22.500 --> 1:19:26.180
 So basically what this involves is you set out

1:19:26.180 --> 1:19:30.620
 to perform six new habits per day

1:19:30.620 --> 1:19:32.760
 across the course of 21 days.

1:19:32.760 --> 1:19:34.660
 Why six and why 21?

1:19:34.660 --> 1:19:36.100
 Well, we'll talk about that in a moment,

1:19:36.100 --> 1:19:38.060
 but the idea is you write down six things

1:19:38.060 --> 1:19:41.180
 that you would like to do every day for 21 days.

1:19:42.320 --> 1:19:44.280
 What phase of the day those things fall into?

1:19:44.280 --> 1:19:45.780
 Well, that will depend on what they are

1:19:45.780 --> 1:19:47.780
 and how they relate to those earlier phase one,

1:19:47.780 --> 1:19:48.820
 phase two, phase three.

1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:51.700
 But for now, 21 days, six things per day.

1:19:51.700 --> 1:19:55.620
 However, the expectation is that you'll only complete

1:19:55.620 --> 1:19:58.520
 four to five of those each day, okay?

1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:01.560
 So built into this is a kind of permission to fail,

1:20:01.560 --> 1:20:04.680
 but it's not failure because it turns out

1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:07.740
 that this approach to forming habits

1:20:07.740 --> 1:20:10.760
 is based not so much on the specific habits

1:20:10.760 --> 1:20:12.220
 that you're trying to form,

1:20:12.220 --> 1:20:15.260
 but the habit of performing habits, right?

1:20:15.260 --> 1:20:18.800
 It's the habit of doing a certain number of things

1:20:18.800 --> 1:20:20.140
 per day.

1:20:20.140 --> 1:20:21.740
 So you set out to perform six.

1:20:21.740 --> 1:20:24.700
 Now, another reason for not necessarily performing all six

1:20:24.700 --> 1:20:26.140
 is that some activities

1:20:26.140 --> 1:20:28.420
 probably shouldn't be performed each day.

1:20:28.420 --> 1:20:30.380
 For instance, in my case,

1:20:30.380 --> 1:20:33.280
 if I were to weight train or even run every day,

1:20:33.280 --> 1:20:36.220
 I'm of the sort, or my biology is of the sort

1:20:36.220 --> 1:20:37.540
 that I don't recover so well.

1:20:37.540 --> 1:20:40.160
 So I wouldn't want to do resistance training every day,

1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:42.840
 but I might want to do it four days a week, for instance.

1:20:42.840 --> 1:20:44.580
 So by having six things in that list,

1:20:44.580 --> 1:20:47.280
 I could shuffle out that particular activity

1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:48.560
 on particular days of the week.

1:20:48.560 --> 1:20:51.260
 And simply do four or five other activities.

1:20:51.260 --> 1:20:53.260
 So 21 days, you list out four to five things.

1:20:53.260 --> 1:20:55.640
 So it might be zone two cardio, resistance training,

1:20:55.640 --> 1:20:59.340
 sunlight viewing, writing.

1:20:59.340 --> 1:21:00.180
 It could be journaling.

1:21:00.180 --> 1:21:02.560
 It could be learning a language, mathematics.

1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:03.600
 Again, this is going to vary

1:21:03.600 --> 1:21:05.280
 depending on your particular goals

1:21:05.280 --> 1:21:07.420
 and the habits that you're trying to create.

1:21:07.420 --> 1:21:09.020
 But no more than six.

1:21:09.020 --> 1:21:11.140
 And the expectation is that you're not going to perform

1:21:11.140 --> 1:21:12.260
 more than four to five.

1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:14.780
 If you miss a day,

1:21:14.780 --> 1:21:17.320
 meaning you don't perform four to five things,

1:21:17.320 --> 1:21:19.560
 there is no punishment.

1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:20.400
 And in fact,

1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:23.440
 it's important that you don't actually try and do

1:21:23.440 --> 1:21:26.480
 what in the literature is called a habit slip compensation,

1:21:26.480 --> 1:21:29.080
 which is just fancy psychological language

1:21:29.080 --> 1:21:33.340
 for if you screw up and you don't get all four or five

1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:34.180
 in one day,

1:21:34.180 --> 1:21:37.720
 you don't do eight the next day in order to compensate.

1:21:37.720 --> 1:21:39.680
 This actually brings me back to an example

1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:40.900
 I had from graduate school.

1:21:40.900 --> 1:21:43.280
 I remember when I started graduate school feeling

1:21:43.280 --> 1:21:45.440
 very excited, but a little bit overwhelmed

1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:47.240
 by the amount of things that I had to do

1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:48.400
 because I had to both do research.

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:50.520
 I was doing coursework at the time,

1:21:50.520 --> 1:21:51.660
 graduate student stipends,

1:21:51.660 --> 1:21:55.300
 and still now unfortunately were depressingly low.

1:21:55.300 --> 1:21:56.600
 So it was financially stressful.

1:21:56.600 --> 1:21:58.000
 There were a number of things happening.

1:21:58.000 --> 1:21:59.960
 And I remember a neurologist,

1:21:59.960 --> 1:22:01.640
 this was at UC Berkeley,

1:22:01.640 --> 1:22:03.560
 it's really fantastic scientist and person.

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:04.400
 His name is Bob Knight.

1:22:04.400 --> 1:22:05.840
 Some of you may know him.

1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:07.680
 I remember I went to him and I asked,

1:22:07.680 --> 1:22:10.320
 what is the process by which someone actually navigates

1:22:10.320 --> 1:22:11.620
 graduate school successfully?

1:22:11.620 --> 1:22:13.620
 And he said, listen,

1:22:13.620 --> 1:22:17.840
 you don't want to do anything or engage in a routine

1:22:17.840 --> 1:22:20.320
 in any way that you can't keep up consistently

1:22:20.320 --> 1:22:23.160
 for at least five and ideally six days per week.

1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:24.240
 I thought, oh, that's pretty good.

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:26.000
 And he said, every four or five years,

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:27.040
 you might have to update that,

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.200
 but you need to decide what you can do consistently,

1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:31.980
 what you can do every day or at least six days a week

1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:33.040
 or five days a week.

1:22:33.040 --> 1:22:35.280
 And that was very, very useful to me.

1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:37.880
 And it fits well with this notion of habit slips

1:22:37.880 --> 1:22:40.000
 that if you happen to screw up

1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.360
 and not be able to engage in whatever habits

1:22:42.360 --> 1:22:44.800
 you're trying to learn for whatever reason,

1:22:44.800 --> 1:22:47.960
 that the next day you just get right back on the horse,

1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:49.240
 so to speak.

1:22:49.240 --> 1:22:51.760
 However, there's a really interesting feature

1:22:51.760 --> 1:22:53.620
 from the neuroscience literature

1:22:53.620 --> 1:22:54.960
 and from the psychology literature

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:58.920
 that says that chunking this 21 days into two day bins

1:22:58.920 --> 1:23:00.880
 can be very, very useful.

1:23:00.880 --> 1:23:02.900
 While it is true that the unit of the day

1:23:02.900 --> 1:23:07.540
 that our cells use is a circadian one, a 24 hour clock,

1:23:07.540 --> 1:23:09.160
 there does seem to be something powerful

1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:11.080
 about engaging in particular habits

1:23:11.080 --> 1:23:15.200
 in a particular sequence for two days in a row

1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:16.160
 and then resetting.

1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:18.800
 So thinking, okay, I can do this for a day.

1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:19.680
 And if I can do it for a day,

1:23:19.680 --> 1:23:21.760
 I can probably do it for two days and then resetting.

1:23:21.760 --> 1:23:23.720
 So every two days you're resetting.

1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:26.200
 So you're kind of chunking this 21 days

1:23:26.200 --> 1:23:27.980
 into a series of two day bins

1:23:27.980 --> 1:23:31.280
 in which you are trying to perform four to five new habits

1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:33.820
 and then completing that 21 days.

1:23:33.820 --> 1:23:36.120
 Now, everything I've described about this 21 day program

1:23:36.120 --> 1:23:38.680
 with six things that you're trying to do as new habits

1:23:38.680 --> 1:23:41.120
 and only performing four to five and not compensating,

1:23:41.120 --> 1:23:42.120
 et cetera.

1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:45.660
 There's nothing neuroscientifically unique about it,

1:23:45.660 --> 1:23:50.140
 except for the fact that it's not just 21 days

1:23:50.140 --> 1:23:52.380
 broken up into two day chunks.

1:23:52.380 --> 1:23:57.380
 After 21 days, you stop engaging in this 21 day

1:23:57.520 --> 1:24:01.440
 deliberate four to five things per day type schedule.

1:24:01.440 --> 1:24:04.080
 And you simply go into autopilot.

1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:07.560
 You ask yourself how many of those particular habits

1:24:07.560 --> 1:24:10.000
 that I was deliberately trying to learn

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.040
 in the previous 21 days

1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:14.420
 are automatically incorporated into my schedule.

1:24:14.420 --> 1:24:16.680
 How many of them am I naturally doing?

1:24:16.680 --> 1:24:18.460
 In other words, every 21 days,

1:24:18.460 --> 1:24:21.080
 you don't update and start adding new habits.

1:24:21.080 --> 1:24:23.420
 You simply try and maintain the ones that you built

1:24:23.420 --> 1:24:25.000
 in that first 21 days.

1:24:25.000 --> 1:24:27.180
 And this I think is extremely important

1:24:27.180 --> 1:24:30.720
 because in all of the habit literature that I could find,

1:24:30.720 --> 1:24:33.280
 sure, there was a lot of psychological data,

1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:36.280
 neuroscience data, behavioral science data around,

1:24:36.280 --> 1:24:37.420
 here's how you form a habit.

1:24:37.420 --> 1:24:38.920
 Here's how you break a habit.

1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:41.800
 There was even some kind of tests for whether or not

1:24:41.800 --> 1:24:45.080
 a habit had really achieved context independence,

1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:47.840
 whether or not it was a strongly formed habit.

1:24:47.840 --> 1:24:49.760
 But there wasn't a lot of information,

1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:52.560
 at least by my search of what to do

1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:54.000
 once you've formed a habit

1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.680
 and how to evaluate whether or not that habit

1:24:56.680 --> 1:24:59.900
 is likely to persist long into the future.

1:24:59.900 --> 1:25:01.600
 So here's the idea.

1:25:02.500 --> 1:25:05.680
 You set out these six things that you would like to learn

1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:07.680
 or that you would like to acquire in your life,

1:25:07.680 --> 1:25:08.800
 these habits.

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:10.540
 You only expect that you're going to perform

1:25:10.540 --> 1:25:11.700
 four or five each day.

1:25:11.700 --> 1:25:13.340
 You do that for 21 days.

1:25:13.340 --> 1:25:14.480
 Again, if you miss a day,

1:25:14.480 --> 1:25:16.000
 you just hop right back on the next day.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:19.000
 However, you should think about the functional units

1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:22.240
 within this 21 day period as two days.

1:25:22.240 --> 1:25:24.760
 You're going to try and nail four to five of these things

1:25:24.760 --> 1:25:25.600
 for two days.

1:25:25.600 --> 1:25:26.960
 If you happen to get all six, great,

1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:29.120
 but that's not necessarily required.

1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:31.040
 So you can do two days, then reset two days,

1:25:31.040 --> 1:25:32.000
 then reset two days.

1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:33.800
 And then in the next 21 days,

1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:35.800
 you're not trying to acquire any new habits.

1:25:35.800 --> 1:25:38.000
 You're not going to throw in six more habits

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:38.960
 that you want to learn.

1:25:38.960 --> 1:25:41.200
 You're simply going to assess how well,

1:25:41.200 --> 1:25:43.820
 how deeply you've rewired your nervous system

1:25:43.820 --> 1:25:46.680
 to be able to perform those six habits

1:25:46.680 --> 1:25:48.680
 of the previous 21 days.

1:25:48.680 --> 1:25:50.720
 And this is extremely useful, I believe,

1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:54.040
 because it will allow you to assess whether or not

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:56.720
 you can indeed make room, if you even have room,

1:25:56.720 --> 1:25:59.920
 I should say, for more habits, right?

1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:02.340
 Many people are trying to cram so many new behaviors

1:26:02.340 --> 1:26:04.720
 into their nervous system that they don't stand a chance

1:26:04.720 --> 1:26:06.120
 of learning all those behaviors.

1:26:06.120 --> 1:26:09.280
 What you may find is that you kept up two of those things

1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:11.280
 very consistently throughout the 21 days.

1:26:11.280 --> 1:26:14.000
 And perhaps there was one of them that you did sporadically

1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:17.320
 and that there were three others that, frankly,

1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:19.280
 you didn't manage to execute.

1:26:19.280 --> 1:26:22.240
 You may also be one of these people, one of these mutants,

1:26:22.240 --> 1:26:25.120
 that sets out to do six new things per day for 21 days

1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:26.880
 and performs every single one of them.

1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:29.400
 Terrific, more power to you in that case

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:31.420
 for the following 21 days.

1:26:31.420 --> 1:26:33.440
 Let's see whether or not you can continue to perform

1:26:33.440 --> 1:26:36.680
 those very same six things every day for 21 days.

1:26:36.680 --> 1:26:38.980
 And then, and only then,

1:26:38.980 --> 1:26:41.160
 would you want to add more habits in.

1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:43.540
 So you could repeat this 21 day process,

1:26:43.540 --> 1:26:46.880
 21 days of new habit, 21 days of testing those new habits

1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:48.280
 as whether or not they're reflexive or not.

1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:51.320
 You could do that forever if you wanted.

1:26:51.320 --> 1:26:52.880
 But the idea is that this isn't something

1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:54.620
 that you're doing all year long.

1:26:54.620 --> 1:26:56.840
 It's that you perhaps starting the new year,

1:26:56.840 --> 1:26:58.720
 or regardless of when you're listening to this,

1:26:58.720 --> 1:27:00.480
 you set out to make that 21 day,

1:27:00.480 --> 1:27:04.240
 really the stimulus period in which the habits get wired in.

1:27:04.240 --> 1:27:05.440
 And then the following month,

1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:09.360
 and maybe even the following months or periods of 21 days

1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:12.100
 are really that kind of thermometer or the test bed

1:27:12.100 --> 1:27:15.560
 of how well you've embedded those particular habits.

1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:18.560
 And if indeed you want to continue to add new habits

1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:20.500
 or you find that certain habits that you weren't able

1:27:20.500 --> 1:27:22.800
 to embed in your nervous system and make reflexive,

1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:25.080
 you want to then bring those in, fantastic.

1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:27.640
 But it's only once you've achieved all those six habits

1:27:27.640 --> 1:27:29.440
 as reflexive that you would move forward.

1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:31.760
 And I think this sort of system,

1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:33.720
 while it could have been replaced

1:27:33.720 --> 1:27:35.680
 with many other different systems,

1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:37.880
 again, there's nothing holy about the system,

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:40.740
 but this particular system has a number of features,

1:27:40.740 --> 1:27:43.360
 the lack of compensation for missed days,

1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:46.060
 the fact that it's a fairly high intensity program

1:27:46.060 --> 1:27:48.520
 for 21 days, but then you test yourself

1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:51.920
 a kind of a competition test with yourself, if you will.

1:27:51.920 --> 1:27:55.120
 Those features and the fact that habit slips,

1:27:55.120 --> 1:27:57.740
 missing of particular habits and not doing all six

1:27:57.740 --> 1:27:59.000
 is kind of built into the system,

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.220
 I think makes it a very reasonable one.

1:28:01.220 --> 1:28:04.000
 It's very adaptable to the real world.

1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:08.440
 And I think it's one that provided you obey the phase one,

1:28:08.440 --> 1:28:10.060
 phase two, phase three type system

1:28:10.060 --> 1:28:10.960
 that we talked about earlier,

1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:13.440
 you collapse these two programs with one another,

1:28:13.440 --> 1:28:14.640
 which hopefully will be easy

1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:16.400
 based on the descriptions I've given.

1:28:16.400 --> 1:28:17.240
 Well, if you do that,

1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:19.720
 and I think there's a very high probability

1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:21.120
 that the habits that you try and form

1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:22.720
 will achieve this context dependence

1:28:22.720 --> 1:28:24.120
 and that it will take progressively

1:28:24.120 --> 1:28:26.480
 less and less limbic friction to perform them.

1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:28.960
 Thus far, we've almost exclusively been discussing

1:28:28.960 --> 1:28:32.360
 how to form habits, but what about breaking habits?

1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:35.440
 Certainly many people out there would like to break habits

1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:38.120
 that they feel don't serve them well.

1:28:38.120 --> 1:28:39.840
 One of the challenges in breaking habits

1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:43.160
 is that many habits occur very, very quickly.

1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:45.760
 And so there isn't an opportunity to intervene

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:48.120
 until the habit has already been initiated

1:28:48.120 --> 1:28:50.480
 and in some cases completed.

1:28:50.480 --> 1:28:52.240
 Well, there are a couple of tools

1:28:52.240 --> 1:28:54.520
 that neuroscience and psychology

1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:56.600
 tell us can be very beneficial.

1:28:56.600 --> 1:28:59.400
 Some of those things are somewhat intuitive

1:28:59.400 --> 1:29:02.220
 and relate to what I call foundational practices,

1:29:02.220 --> 1:29:04.520
 meaning things that set the overall tone

1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:06.040
 in your body and brain,

1:29:06.040 --> 1:29:08.080
 such that you would be less likely

1:29:08.080 --> 1:29:10.200
 to engage in a particular habit

1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:13.080
 or that would raise your level of awareness,

1:29:13.080 --> 1:29:16.560
 both of your situation and to how you feel inside.

1:29:16.560 --> 1:29:18.400
 So things like stress reduction,

1:29:18.400 --> 1:29:19.720
 things like getting good sleep,

1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:21.200
 things like quality nutrition,

1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:23.320
 things like having positive routines

1:29:23.320 --> 1:29:24.760
 arranged throughout your day,

1:29:24.760 --> 1:29:27.360
 all of those of course will support you

1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:29.720
 in trying to break particular habits.

1:29:29.720 --> 1:29:31.320
 And while that can be very useful,

1:29:31.320 --> 1:29:34.120
 it's admittedly very generic advice.

1:29:34.120 --> 1:29:36.740
 It doesn't point to any one specific protocol.

1:29:36.740 --> 1:29:39.760
 In order to identify a specific protocol

1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:42.220
 that one could apply in order to break habits,

1:29:42.220 --> 1:29:44.640
 we have to look at the mirror image

1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:47.060
 of the sort of neuroplasticity that we talked about

1:29:47.060 --> 1:29:49.000
 at the beginning of the episode.

1:29:49.000 --> 1:29:50.000
 At the beginning of the episode,

1:29:50.000 --> 1:29:51.700
 we talked about a form of neuroplasticity

1:29:51.700 --> 1:29:53.480
 called long-term potentiation

1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:56.140
 involving the NMDA receptor.

1:29:56.140 --> 1:29:57.800
 Just to refresh your memory a little bit,

1:29:57.800 --> 1:30:00.520
 it basically says that if a set of neurons

1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:01.960
 is very electrically active,

1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:03.520
 it's likely that over time,

1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:06.840
 those neurons will communicate with themselves more easily

1:30:06.840 --> 1:30:10.300
 because of changes in things like NMDA receptor activity,

1:30:10.300 --> 1:30:12.700
 the recruitment of additional receptors, et cetera.

1:30:12.700 --> 1:30:15.360
 It's essentially a cellular and molecular explanation

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:19.640
 for how something goes from unlearned to learned

1:30:19.640 --> 1:30:20.960
 to reflexive.

1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:23.560
 Now, in order to break synapses

1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:25.600
 or to break apart neural connections

1:30:25.600 --> 1:30:28.880
 that are serving a habit that you don't want to engage in,

1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:32.520
 we need to engage the process called long-term depression.

1:30:32.520 --> 1:30:35.260
 And long-term depression has nothing to do

1:30:35.260 --> 1:30:39.900
 with a state of mental depression or a reduction in mood.

1:30:39.900 --> 1:30:41.360
 So I really want to be clear

1:30:41.360 --> 1:30:43.880
 that when I say depression in this context,

1:30:43.880 --> 1:30:46.200
 it has nothing to do with psychological depression,

1:30:46.200 --> 1:30:47.900
 it has nothing to do with mood.

1:30:47.900 --> 1:30:50.160
 It's simply called long-term depression

1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:52.920
 because just as long-term potentiation says,

1:30:52.920 --> 1:30:55.840
 if neuron A triggers the firing of neuron B

1:30:55.840 --> 1:30:59.000
 and it does so very robustly over and over and over again,

1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:02.960
 then neuron A will not have to fire as intensely

1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:06.740
 or as frequently in order to activate neuron B in the future

1:31:06.740 --> 1:31:08.720
 because they become potentiated, right?

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:11.680
 The threshold for co-activation has been reduced.

1:31:11.680 --> 1:31:12.960
 There's a much higher probability

1:31:12.960 --> 1:31:14.640
 that they will be activated together

1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:16.960
 at low levels of intensity.

1:31:16.960 --> 1:31:19.520
 That's essentially what long-term potentiation is.

1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:23.260
 Long-term depression says that if neuron A is active

1:31:23.260 --> 1:31:28.200
 and neuron B is not active within a particular time window,

1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:30.580
 then the connection between neuron A and B

1:31:30.580 --> 1:31:32.000
 will weaken over time

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:35.720
 even if they started off very strongly connected, okay?

1:31:35.720 --> 1:31:36.720
 So I'm going to repeat that

1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:41.200
 because this is a pretty detailed neurobiological mechanism

1:31:41.200 --> 1:31:45.100
 whereby if neuron A is active and neuron B is active

1:31:45.100 --> 1:31:48.200
 but at a different time or outside of particular

1:31:48.200 --> 1:31:49.520
 what we call temporal window,

1:31:49.520 --> 1:31:52.020
 meaning outside a particular time window,

1:31:52.020 --> 1:31:54.360
 then through long-term depression,

1:31:54.360 --> 1:31:58.220
 the connection between neuron A and neuron B will weaken.

1:31:58.220 --> 1:32:01.020
 And just as a point of interest,

1:32:01.020 --> 1:32:04.340
 the NMDA receptor is also involved in long-term depression,

1:32:04.340 --> 1:32:06.520
 although there are other molecular components

1:32:06.520 --> 1:32:07.640
 involved as well.

1:32:07.640 --> 1:32:09.980
 So how do you take two neurons

1:32:09.980 --> 1:32:12.240
 that underlie a habit out of synchrony?

1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:14.680
 How do you get them to fire asynchronously?

1:32:14.680 --> 1:32:16.200
 This is pretty interesting

1:32:16.200 --> 1:32:18.080
 with respect to the cellular molecular biology,

1:32:18.080 --> 1:32:20.940
 but at the behavioral level, it's especially interesting.

1:32:20.940 --> 1:32:24.320
 The way that one would do this is let's say, for instance,

1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:29.320
 you have a habit of picking up your phone mid-work session.

1:32:29.500 --> 1:32:31.540
 Okay, that's a reflexive habit

1:32:31.540 --> 1:32:34.520
 I think that most people have experienced.

1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:37.240
 And we often hear the idea that, oh, you know,

1:32:37.240 --> 1:32:39.980
 the phone is so filled with access to dopamine

1:32:39.980 --> 1:32:42.600
 and incredible things that we're just drawn to it.

1:32:42.600 --> 1:32:46.300
 But if you notice what's happened with phone use over time,

1:32:46.300 --> 1:32:48.980
 most people, including myself sometimes, I admit,

1:32:48.980 --> 1:32:50.800
 find ourselves just looking at our phone

1:32:50.800 --> 1:32:52.680
 or find ourselves in a particular app

1:32:52.680 --> 1:32:55.020
 without actually having engaged in the conscious set

1:32:55.020 --> 1:32:56.620
 of steps of, oh, I'm really curious

1:32:56.620 --> 1:32:58.240
 what's going on in this particular app.

1:32:58.240 --> 1:33:00.000
 I'm really curious what's going on

1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:01.160
 in this particular website.

1:33:01.160 --> 1:33:03.900
 And you just kind of find yourself, in air quotes,

1:33:03.900 --> 1:33:06.540
 for those of you listening, I'm making air quotes,

1:33:06.540 --> 1:33:08.160
 you just sort of find yourself doing it

1:33:08.160 --> 1:33:09.860
 because the behavior of picking up your phone

1:33:09.860 --> 1:33:13.120
 is sort of reflexive or has become fully reflexive.

1:33:13.120 --> 1:33:16.460
 You see this a lot at meals where multiple people are there

1:33:16.460 --> 1:33:17.860
 and no one's looking at their phone.

1:33:17.860 --> 1:33:19.380
 And then all of a sudden someone takes out their phone

1:33:19.380 --> 1:33:20.540
 and you'll notice that other people

1:33:20.540 --> 1:33:22.060
 just naturally take out their phone.

1:33:22.060 --> 1:33:26.380
 It's this kind of observed, observation-induced reflex.

1:33:26.380 --> 1:33:30.500
 And I would wager that most people aren't consciously aware

1:33:30.500 --> 1:33:33.560
 of the immediate steps involved.

1:33:33.560 --> 1:33:36.020
 So the literature says there are a number of ways

1:33:36.020 --> 1:33:39.000
 to break these sorts of habitual behaviors

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:40.980
 or reflexive behaviors.

1:33:40.980 --> 1:33:44.260
 Most of those approaches involve establishing

1:33:44.260 --> 1:33:48.040
 some sort of reward for not performing the activity

1:33:48.040 --> 1:33:50.940
 or some sort of punishment for forming the activity.

1:33:50.940 --> 1:33:53.100
 I've heard of some basic things that people will do,

1:33:53.100 --> 1:33:54.980
 like they'll even put like a rubber band on their wrist

1:33:54.980 --> 1:33:56.420
 and every time they complain

1:33:56.420 --> 1:33:58.880
 or every time they do some behavior,

1:33:58.880 --> 1:33:59.940
 like pick up their phone,

1:33:59.940 --> 1:34:01.860
 they'll give themselves a snap on the wrist.

1:34:01.860 --> 1:34:04.300
 The rationale there is that you're trying to create

1:34:04.300 --> 1:34:08.460
 a somatic, a very physical representation of something

1:34:08.460 --> 1:34:11.180
 that makes it very real and harder to overlook.

1:34:11.180 --> 1:34:13.460
 Other people will just do a tick mark on a piece of paper.

1:34:13.460 --> 1:34:15.620
 The sort of what gets measured

1:34:15.620 --> 1:34:18.180
 is what gets managed kind of mindset,

1:34:18.180 --> 1:34:20.180
 where if every time you do something,

1:34:20.180 --> 1:34:21.700
 you take away the judgment,

1:34:21.700 --> 1:34:23.260
 this is very new agey, I realize,

1:34:23.260 --> 1:34:24.980
 but this is what you find out there

1:34:24.980 --> 1:34:28.500
 if you search the literature and even on PubMed,

1:34:28.500 --> 1:34:29.820
 peer-reviewed articles,

1:34:29.820 --> 1:34:31.740
 that every time you engage in a behavior,

1:34:31.740 --> 1:34:34.900
 you just measure the fact that you did that behavior.

1:34:34.900 --> 1:34:36.700
 You just mark it down at the end of the day.

1:34:36.700 --> 1:34:37.840
 People are supposed to look at that and say,

1:34:37.840 --> 1:34:41.220
 oh my goodness, I can't believe that I spent, you know,

1:34:41.220 --> 1:34:44.340
 three hours doing something or I did it 46 times.

1:34:44.340 --> 1:34:46.620
 And in fact, a lot of apps, social media apps,

1:34:46.620 --> 1:34:49.420
 will start to give you warnings now if you opt in

1:34:49.420 --> 1:34:51.840
 that you've been on the app for an hour,

1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:52.680
 would you like to leave?

1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:54.600
 Most people just click right past it and go back in.

1:34:54.600 --> 1:34:56.880
 I think very few people say,

1:34:56.880 --> 1:34:58.220
 oh my goodness, it's been an hour

1:34:58.220 --> 1:34:59.340
 and therefore you're right,

1:34:59.340 --> 1:35:01.500
 I absolutely shouldn't engage in this anymore.

1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:04.740
 It's just far too easy to just blow past those reminders.

1:35:04.740 --> 1:35:08.560
 Well, the literature on habit formation

1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:12.580
 and habit reduction, breaking habits, has been analyzed.

1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:15.320
 There's a beautiful meta-analysis,

1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:17.500
 which involves looking at a number of different studies

1:35:17.500 --> 1:35:21.220
 all together, comparing the statistical strength

1:35:21.220 --> 1:35:23.220
 of each of those studies, looking in different conditions,

1:35:23.220 --> 1:35:26.760
 what sorts of habits we're trying to be made or broken.

1:35:26.760 --> 1:35:31.060
 The first author on this review is Fritz, F-R-I-T-Z.

1:35:31.060 --> 1:35:33.260
 I'll certainly put a link to this.

1:35:33.260 --> 1:35:34.960
 It's Heather Fritz and it's

1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:37.360
 Intervention to Modify Habits, a scoping review.

1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:39.100
 And it is indeed a very broad scale review.

1:35:39.100 --> 1:35:40.340
 It's from the Journal of Occupation,

1:35:40.340 --> 1:35:41.460
 Participation, and Health.

1:35:41.460 --> 1:35:42.760
 It's published in 2020.

1:35:42.760 --> 1:35:44.420
 It's a really nice article.

1:35:44.420 --> 1:35:46.020
 A couple of things I learned from this article

1:35:46.020 --> 1:35:47.460
 and then I'll get into the specific tool

1:35:47.460 --> 1:35:48.740
 for breaking habits.

1:35:48.740 --> 1:35:50.060
 Perhaps the most interesting thing

1:35:50.060 --> 1:35:52.580
 that I took from this review was the finding

1:35:52.580 --> 1:35:57.180
 that notifications to either engage in habits

1:35:57.180 --> 1:35:58.820
 or to not engage in habits

1:35:58.820 --> 1:36:01.580
 actually were not very effective over time.

1:36:01.580 --> 1:36:03.960
 They were effective in the immediate period

1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:05.980
 when people started using these notifications,

1:36:05.980 --> 1:36:07.440
 as were little sticky notes,

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:09.180
 like don't go into the refrigerator

1:36:09.180 --> 1:36:11.300
 between the hours of whatever and whatever,

1:36:11.300 --> 1:36:14.800
 or just visual reminders, physical reminders,

1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:17.460
 or electronic reminders were effective

1:36:17.460 --> 1:36:18.340
 in the immediate term,

1:36:18.340 --> 1:36:20.020
 but in the longterm did not predict

1:36:20.020 --> 1:36:22.880
 whether or not people would effectively stick to habits

1:36:22.880 --> 1:36:23.820
 they were trying to stick to

1:36:23.820 --> 1:36:25.940
 or break habits that they were trying to break.

1:36:25.940 --> 1:36:28.960
 So sadly, that doesn't seem to work very well.

1:36:28.960 --> 1:36:32.120
 And perhaps they just need to come up with

1:36:32.120 --> 1:36:33.220
 more robust reminders,

1:36:33.220 --> 1:36:35.260
 I don't know, mild electric shock or something like that,

1:36:35.260 --> 1:36:37.140
 because what we do know,

1:36:37.140 --> 1:36:39.620
 only sort of kidding about mild electric shock,

1:36:39.620 --> 1:36:42.240
 but what we do know from both human and animal studies

1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:44.780
 is that things like electric shock,

1:36:44.780 --> 1:36:47.580
 things like monetary penalties, right?

1:36:47.580 --> 1:36:49.300
 Having to pay out every time you engage

1:36:49.300 --> 1:36:50.500
 in a particular behavior,

1:36:50.500 --> 1:36:53.260
 those are pretty effective ways to break habits.

1:36:53.260 --> 1:36:56.340
 The problem is when people are not being monitored

1:36:56.340 --> 1:36:59.500
 for habit use, for instance,

1:36:59.500 --> 1:37:01.300
 you can imagine a situation where you say,

1:37:01.300 --> 1:37:02.580
 I'm not going to pick up my phone

1:37:02.580 --> 1:37:04.920
 for the four hours in the early part of the day

1:37:04.920 --> 1:37:07.740
 so that I can get real dedicated focus work done.

1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:10.000
 Unless someone's monitoring them,

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:13.740
 then people don't tend to monitor themselves

1:37:13.740 --> 1:37:15.560
 completely enough that they punish themselves

1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:17.060
 completely enough that they break the behavior.

1:37:17.060 --> 1:37:19.480
 In other words, the punishment isn't bad enough

1:37:19.480 --> 1:37:20.540
 in order to break the habit,

1:37:20.540 --> 1:37:23.760
 which just speaks to how powerful these habits are

1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:24.940
 once they become reflexive.

1:37:24.940 --> 1:37:26.980
 They're just very, very hard to override.

1:37:26.980 --> 1:37:29.980
 So it turns out that the key to generating

1:37:29.980 --> 1:37:32.460
 long-term depression in these pathways

1:37:32.460 --> 1:37:37.460
 is actually to take the period immediately following

1:37:38.100 --> 1:37:39.620
 the bad habit execution,

1:37:39.620 --> 1:37:40.860
 meaning let's say you tell yourself

1:37:40.860 --> 1:37:41.900
 you're not going to pick up your phone,

1:37:41.900 --> 1:37:42.860
 you're not going to bite your nails,

1:37:42.860 --> 1:37:44.980
 you're not going to reflexively walk to the refrigerator

1:37:44.980 --> 1:37:46.260
 at a particular time of day,

1:37:46.260 --> 1:37:48.460
 but you find yourself doing it anyway.

1:37:48.460 --> 1:37:50.500
 And what actually has to happen

1:37:50.500 --> 1:37:53.260
 is bringing conscious awareness to the period

1:37:53.260 --> 1:37:54.360
 immediately afterward,

1:37:54.360 --> 1:37:55.820
 which I think most people recognize,

1:37:55.820 --> 1:37:57.540
 they realize, oh, I just did it again.

1:37:57.540 --> 1:37:58.460
 I just did it again.

1:37:58.460 --> 1:38:01.980
 And in that moment, capture the sequence of events,

1:38:01.980 --> 1:38:05.660
 not that led to the bad habit execution,

1:38:05.660 --> 1:38:08.260
 but actually to take advantage of the fact

1:38:08.260 --> 1:38:09.940
 that the neurons that were responsible

1:38:09.940 --> 1:38:14.300
 for generating that bad habit were active a moment ago,

1:38:14.300 --> 1:38:17.680
 and to actually engage in a replacement behavior

1:38:17.680 --> 1:38:19.420
 immediately afterward.

1:38:19.420 --> 1:38:21.500
 Now, this is really interesting and I think powerful

1:38:21.500 --> 1:38:24.100
 because I would have thought that you have to engage

1:38:24.100 --> 1:38:27.300
 in a replacement behavior that truly replaces

1:38:27.300 --> 1:38:29.600
 the bad habit behavior, right?

1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:32.020
 That you would have to be able to identify

1:38:32.020 --> 1:38:34.020
 your state of mind or the sequence of events

1:38:34.020 --> 1:38:35.760
 leading into the bad habit,

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:38.820
 but rather the stage or the period immediately

1:38:38.820 --> 1:38:42.020
 after the bad habit execution is a unique opportunity

1:38:42.020 --> 1:38:44.620
 to insert a different type of what we would call

1:38:44.620 --> 1:38:46.920
 adaptive behavior, but that could be any behavior

1:38:46.920 --> 1:38:50.600
 that's not in line with the bad behavior.

1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:51.780
 So let's give it an example.

1:38:51.780 --> 1:38:53.560
 Let's say you find yourself,

1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:54.820
 you're trying to do focused work,

1:38:54.820 --> 1:38:56.180
 you pick up your phone,

1:38:56.180 --> 1:38:59.540
 you're disappointed in yourself for picking up your phone.

1:38:59.540 --> 1:39:01.460
 You could of course just put it down

1:39:01.460 --> 1:39:04.220
 and re-engage in the work behavior.

1:39:04.220 --> 1:39:05.460
 But if you were good at that,

1:39:05.460 --> 1:39:07.540
 then you probably wouldn't have done it in the first place.

1:39:07.540 --> 1:39:09.900
 And so what turns out to be very effective

1:39:09.900 --> 1:39:12.920
 is to go engage in some other positive habit.

1:39:12.920 --> 1:39:14.960
 Now, this has two major effects.

1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:17.640
 The first one is you start to link in time

1:39:17.640 --> 1:39:19.500
 the execution of a bad behavior

1:39:19.500 --> 1:39:21.940
 to this other good behavior.

1:39:21.940 --> 1:39:26.400
 And in doing so, you start to recruit other neural circuits,

1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:30.500
 other neurons that can start to somewhat dismantle

1:39:30.500 --> 1:39:33.580
 the sequence of firing associated with the bad behavior.

1:39:33.580 --> 1:39:36.860
 In other words, you start to create a kind of a double habit

1:39:36.860 --> 1:39:38.420
 that starts with a bad habit

1:39:38.420 --> 1:39:40.340
 and then ends with a good habit.

1:39:40.340 --> 1:39:44.260
 And that seems to create enough of a temporal mismatch

1:39:44.260 --> 1:39:46.580
 so that then recognizing when you're heading

1:39:46.580 --> 1:39:50.100
 toward the bad habit becomes more apparent to you.

1:39:50.100 --> 1:39:52.180
 So again, I want to make this very, very concrete.

1:39:52.180 --> 1:39:53.700
 Let's say that the behavior

1:39:53.700 --> 1:39:55.940
 is reflexively picking up one's phone.

1:39:55.940 --> 1:39:58.540
 You do that, you think, oh goodness, I did it again.

1:39:58.540 --> 1:39:59.620
 Here's what I'm going to do.

1:39:59.620 --> 1:40:00.780
 You would set that down

1:40:00.780 --> 1:40:04.100
 and then you would engage in some other positive behavior

1:40:04.100 --> 1:40:05.240
 that you've deemed positive.

1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:06.500
 And here it's very subjective.

1:40:06.500 --> 1:40:07.860
 So it's hard for me to give an example

1:40:07.860 --> 1:40:10.500
 that will necessarily make sense to everybody,

1:40:10.500 --> 1:40:12.680
 but perhaps you're working on hydration.

1:40:12.680 --> 1:40:14.320
 So maybe you go have a glass of water.

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:18.900
 Maybe you are trying to do breath work or something.

1:40:18.900 --> 1:40:21.660
 Maybe you are trying to enhance

1:40:21.660 --> 1:40:23.100
 your language speaking skills.

1:40:23.100 --> 1:40:24.860
 And so you go and you spend five minutes

1:40:24.860 --> 1:40:28.040
 doing a particular type of language learning.

1:40:28.040 --> 1:40:30.220
 You literally exit whatever you are doing

1:40:30.220 --> 1:40:32.940
 and perform that other new positive habit

1:40:32.940 --> 1:40:34.720
 in the immediate period right after that,

1:40:34.720 --> 1:40:36.500
 even for a short period of time.

1:40:36.500 --> 1:40:38.140
 It's a little bit counterintuitive,

1:40:38.140 --> 1:40:40.900
 but what this does is it creates a kind of a cognitive

1:40:40.900 --> 1:40:45.020
 and a temporal mismatch between the initial bad behavior,

1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:47.980
 which before is what we would call sort of a closed loop

1:40:47.980 --> 1:40:49.280
 and the engineers out there

1:40:49.280 --> 1:40:50.540
 will know what I'm talking about.

1:40:50.540 --> 1:40:51.580
 But in closed loop,

1:40:51.580 --> 1:40:54.780
 so one behavior or one set of neural firings

1:40:54.780 --> 1:40:56.060
 leads to another, leads to another,

1:40:56.060 --> 1:40:58.100
 and then just kind of sets the same thing in motion.

1:40:58.100 --> 1:41:00.700
 It can be kind of a self-perpetuating system.

1:41:00.700 --> 1:41:03.740
 By changing the number of features that are in that loop,

1:41:03.740 --> 1:41:06.680
 it disrupts the closed nature of that loop.

1:41:06.680 --> 1:41:08.500
 It creates what we call an open loop.

1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:11.540
 And in an open loop, you are better able to intervene.

1:41:11.540 --> 1:41:14.420
 So as I mentioned before, this might seem counterintuitive.

1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:17.140
 You might think, why would I want to reward the execution

1:41:17.140 --> 1:41:19.860
 of a bad habit with a good habit?

1:41:19.860 --> 1:41:22.100
 I don't want to reward myself for the bad habit,

1:41:22.100 --> 1:41:23.380
 but really what you're trying to do

1:41:23.380 --> 1:41:26.580
 is you're trying to change the nature of the neural circuits

1:41:26.580 --> 1:41:29.380
 that are firing so that you can rewrite the script

1:41:29.380 --> 1:41:31.200
 for that bad habit.

1:41:32.380 --> 1:41:35.020
 A different way to put it would be imagine

1:41:35.020 --> 1:41:38.660
 that the bad habit is like a chord on the piano

1:41:38.660 --> 1:41:40.240
 that you play or a chord of notes

1:41:40.240 --> 1:41:42.500
 or a sequence of notes that you would play.

1:41:42.500 --> 1:41:44.120
 And it comes very easily.

1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:45.820
 You can play it every single time.

1:41:45.820 --> 1:41:47.480
 But let's say, as you're trying to learn a new piece

1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:49.300
 of music, you're just constantly inserting that

1:41:49.300 --> 1:41:51.340
 at the inappropriate times.

1:41:51.340 --> 1:41:53.760
 I think it's a decent enough analogy for a bad habit

1:41:53.760 --> 1:41:55.620
 because it involves some motor execution.

1:41:55.620 --> 1:41:57.260
 You just find yourself doing it.

1:41:57.260 --> 1:41:59.740
 Rather than trying to prevent yourself from doing it,

1:41:59.740 --> 1:42:03.700
 the next time you do it, add in a new quarter sequence

1:42:03.700 --> 1:42:05.680
 that you're trying to learn.

1:42:05.680 --> 1:42:08.280
 What this does then is it changes the whole nature

1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:11.700
 of the sequence of neurons that are firing from bad habit

1:42:11.700 --> 1:42:15.460
 through to the end of this newly applied good habit.

1:42:15.460 --> 1:42:19.340
 So this is the way in which you start to dismantle,

1:42:19.340 --> 1:42:22.700
 or when I say dismantle, really weaken the likelihood

1:42:22.700 --> 1:42:25.100
 that if neuron A fires, neuron B will fire.

1:42:25.100 --> 1:42:28.100
 Because as you're starting off in the mode

1:42:28.100 --> 1:42:30.740
 of very reflexively performing a bad habit,

1:42:30.740 --> 1:42:32.620
 those neurons are firing together

1:42:32.620 --> 1:42:34.660
 without you consciously being aware of it.

1:42:34.660 --> 1:42:38.820
 It's almost impossible for you to intervene in yourself

1:42:38.820 --> 1:42:42.380
 without a number of other features like severe punishment,

1:42:42.380 --> 1:42:45.260
 severe consequence type outcomes.

1:42:45.260 --> 1:42:48.000
 Rather tacking on some additional sequences,

1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.580
 like if neuron A fires, neuron B fires,

1:42:50.580 --> 1:42:53.220
 and then you're saying, okay, well, if neuron B fires,

1:42:53.220 --> 1:42:57.580
 I'm going to start inserting neuron CDEF to fire, right?

1:42:57.580 --> 1:43:00.860
 That's the CDEF being the positive behavior

1:43:00.860 --> 1:43:02.020
 that you're going to insert.

1:43:02.020 --> 1:43:05.400
 And in doing so, you create a chain of neuronal activation

1:43:05.400 --> 1:43:07.820
 that then is very easy to dismantle.

1:43:07.820 --> 1:43:11.460
 And so when people have applied this kind of approach,

1:43:11.460 --> 1:43:15.380
 it removes the need to have constant conscious awareness

1:43:15.380 --> 1:43:18.420
 of one's own behavior prior to that behavior,

1:43:18.420 --> 1:43:20.920
 which is very, very difficult to achieve.

1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:24.420
 Rather, what they find is that they are able to engage

1:43:24.420 --> 1:43:26.460
 in remapping of the neural circuits

1:43:26.460 --> 1:43:27.700
 associated with bad habits

1:43:27.700 --> 1:43:30.820
 in ways that are very, very straightforward, right?

1:43:30.820 --> 1:43:32.540
 Because you can always identify

1:43:32.540 --> 1:43:34.180
 when you've done the thing you don't want to do,

1:43:34.180 --> 1:43:36.620
 and then tack onto that something additional

1:43:36.620 --> 1:43:37.680
 that's positive.

1:43:37.680 --> 1:43:40.680
 Now, the nature of that positive thing is important.

1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:41.740
 You don't want it to be something

1:43:41.740 --> 1:43:42.980
 that's very hard to execute.

1:43:42.980 --> 1:43:44.580
 You want it to be something that's positive

1:43:44.580 --> 1:43:46.360
 and fairly easy to execute

1:43:46.360 --> 1:43:48.060
 so that you're not struggling all the time

1:43:48.060 --> 1:43:51.340
 to insert this on top of this bad behavior,

1:43:51.340 --> 1:43:53.500
 whatever that bad behavior might happen to be.

1:43:53.500 --> 1:43:54.620
 But again, this is rooted

1:43:54.620 --> 1:43:56.780
 in the biology of long-term depression.

1:43:56.780 --> 1:43:59.620
 It maps very well to the behavioral change literature

1:43:59.620 --> 1:44:01.380
 that I was able to glean that really shows

1:44:01.380 --> 1:44:03.220
 that rather than just get reminders,

1:44:03.220 --> 1:44:04.900
 rather than try and instill punishment,

1:44:04.900 --> 1:44:07.740
 rather than setting up reward for breaking bad habits,

1:44:07.740 --> 1:44:10.100
 that perhaps the simplest way to approach this

1:44:10.100 --> 1:44:13.580
 is to tack on additional behaviors to the bad habits,

1:44:13.580 --> 1:44:15.980
 make sure those behaviors are good behaviors

1:44:15.980 --> 1:44:18.220
 or behaviors that are adaptive for you.

1:44:18.220 --> 1:44:20.620
 And in doing so, you will soon find

1:44:20.620 --> 1:44:22.460
 that the initiation of the bad habit

1:44:22.460 --> 1:44:23.620
 takes on a whole new form

1:44:23.620 --> 1:44:26.220
 or that you're not even inspired to do it at all.

1:44:26.220 --> 1:44:27.620
 And of course, I want to acknowledge

1:44:27.620 --> 1:44:30.460
 that breaking bad habits is really hard.

1:44:30.460 --> 1:44:32.940
 We had an episode all about addiction

1:44:32.940 --> 1:44:36.100
 with Dr. Anna Lemke from Stanford Medical School.

1:44:36.100 --> 1:44:37.420
 She's a colleague of mine

1:44:37.420 --> 1:44:41.180
 who runs the dual diagnosis addiction clinic at Stanford.

1:44:41.180 --> 1:44:44.120
 And in that episode, we talked a lot about how addicts,

1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:47.400
 for drugs, alcohol, people who have addictions

1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:50.500
 to certain types of behaviors or avoidance behaviors even,

1:44:50.500 --> 1:44:51.780
 that in the case of addiction,

1:44:51.780 --> 1:44:55.420
 there has to be a tremendous kind of full-scale campaign

1:44:55.420 --> 1:44:57.500
 for them to be able to intervene in their behavior.

1:44:57.500 --> 1:44:58.580
 So for those of you that are thinking

1:44:58.580 --> 1:44:59.660
 about bad habit breaking

1:44:59.660 --> 1:45:03.320
 in the context of addictive type behaviors,

1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:05.140
 definitely check out that episode.

1:45:05.140 --> 1:45:07.620
 Addiction does employ some of these principles

1:45:07.620 --> 1:45:11.980
 around habit making and habit breaking, as it were.

1:45:11.980 --> 1:45:14.920
 But of course, because the consequences

1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:18.140
 of certain habits in addiction can be so severe,

1:45:18.140 --> 1:45:19.980
 there's other sets of protocols

1:45:19.980 --> 1:45:22.060
 and there's a kind of a psychological backdrop to it

1:45:22.060 --> 1:45:23.160
 that's very important.

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:25.020
 It also relates to the biology of dopamine

1:45:25.020 --> 1:45:27.000
 and you can find all of that in the episode

1:45:27.000 --> 1:45:28.440
 with Dr. Anna Lemke.

1:45:28.440 --> 1:45:31.300
 So today we've covered a lot about the biology

1:45:31.300 --> 1:45:35.000
 and psychology of habit formation and habit breaking.

1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:40.000
 We talked about why certain habits are so hard to wire in,

1:45:40.260 --> 1:45:43.960
 why certain habits are so hard to break down and eliminate,

1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:47.140
 and how we can determine which habits

1:45:47.140 --> 1:45:49.580
 are going to be easier for us to access,

1:45:49.580 --> 1:45:50.940
 which habits are going to be harder

1:45:50.940 --> 1:45:53.420
 for us to access and break.

1:45:53.420 --> 1:45:55.880
 We talked a lot about this notion of limbic friction

1:45:55.880 --> 1:45:57.740
 and we talked about context dependence.

1:45:57.740 --> 1:46:00.940
 And we talked about a number of different things

1:46:00.940 --> 1:46:02.560
 as it relates to neural circuits

1:46:02.560 --> 1:46:05.000
 and the formation of new connections in the brain

1:46:05.000 --> 1:46:07.880
 and strengthening and weakening of connections in the brain.

1:46:07.880 --> 1:46:10.340
 We also discussed two programs,

1:46:10.340 --> 1:46:12.160
 programs designed specifically for you

1:46:12.160 --> 1:46:15.020
 on the basis of the neurobiology literature

1:46:15.020 --> 1:46:17.400
 and the literature on the psychology of habit formation

1:46:17.400 --> 1:46:18.500
 and habit breaking.

1:46:18.500 --> 1:46:20.120
 Just to briefly recap,

1:46:21.140 --> 1:46:24.380
 one program involves dividing the 24 hour day

1:46:24.380 --> 1:46:27.660
 into three phases, phase one, phase two, phase three,

1:46:27.660 --> 1:46:30.260
 and to try and tackle specific habits

1:46:30.260 --> 1:46:33.860
 at particular phases of the 24 hour cycle.

1:46:33.860 --> 1:46:37.560
 The second program involved a 21 day process

1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:41.700
 of engaging approximately six new habits per day,

1:46:41.700 --> 1:46:43.460
 although the expectation, as I mentioned earlier,

1:46:43.460 --> 1:46:46.120
 is that you're not going to perform all six of those,

1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:48.660
 and an assessment in the following 21 days

1:46:48.660 --> 1:46:50.500
 as to whether or not you have indeed

1:46:50.500 --> 1:46:52.700
 formed those new habits or not.

1:46:52.700 --> 1:46:55.020
 And there were a number of other features that I mentioned

1:46:55.020 --> 1:46:57.140
 that were related to those two general programs,

1:46:57.140 --> 1:46:58.700
 phase one, phase two, phase three,

1:46:58.700 --> 1:47:01.460
 and the 21 day program and how those could be meshed

1:47:01.460 --> 1:47:02.420
 together.

1:47:02.420 --> 1:47:04.780
 So I'm guessing some of you will probably have questions

1:47:04.780 --> 1:47:06.900
 about those programs and how to apply them,

1:47:06.900 --> 1:47:09.860
 but hopefully they were clear enough for you to get started.

1:47:09.860 --> 1:47:11.800
 This is a good opportunity for me to mention

1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:14.500
 that the Huberman Lab Podcast has something called

1:47:14.500 --> 1:47:17.440
 the Neural Network Newsletter that is sent out

1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:19.580
 approximately once a month.

1:47:19.580 --> 1:47:21.140
 For the next newsletter,

1:47:21.140 --> 1:47:25.940
 I will release a on paper version of these two systems

1:47:25.940 --> 1:47:28.060
 and how they mesh together for habit formation

1:47:28.060 --> 1:47:29.380
 and habit breaking.

1:47:29.380 --> 1:47:31.340
 And if you'd like to access that,

1:47:31.340 --> 1:47:33.880
 you can go to HubermanLab.com, you go to the menu,

1:47:33.880 --> 1:47:35.500
 you can sign up for the newsletter.

1:47:35.500 --> 1:47:37.580
 First of all, it's zero cost.

1:47:37.580 --> 1:47:40.000
 Second of all, we have our privacy policy there,

1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:40.840
 but I can tell you right now,

1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:42.960
 we don't share your email with any vendors

1:47:42.960 --> 1:47:44.460
 or any other sources.

1:47:44.460 --> 1:47:47.080
 Those emails stay internal to us.

1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:49.060
 And if you'd like to see what the sort of flavor

1:47:49.060 --> 1:47:52.620
 of those newsletters is, the previous newsletters,

1:47:52.620 --> 1:47:54.740
 for instance, one on tools for sleep

1:47:54.740 --> 1:47:58.300
 that I mentioned earlier or tools for neuroplasticity

1:47:58.300 --> 1:48:00.600
 in the classroom and outside the classroom as well

1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:02.780
 for teachers and for students of various kinds,

1:48:02.780 --> 1:48:04.300
 those are also posted there.

1:48:04.300 --> 1:48:07.100
 So you can access any of the previous newsletters.

1:48:07.100 --> 1:48:08.580
 My hope is that today you've learned

1:48:08.580 --> 1:48:11.540
 both the biological mechanisms and the practical tools

1:48:11.540 --> 1:48:15.180
 by which you can start to establish habits that for you,

1:48:15.180 --> 1:48:17.100
 you deem adaptive, healthy,

1:48:17.100 --> 1:48:18.900
 and that are going to support you and your goals.

1:48:18.900 --> 1:48:21.860
 And that you can start to dismantle some of the habits

1:48:21.860 --> 1:48:25.140
 that you find to be unhealthy or maladaptive for you

1:48:25.140 --> 1:48:26.520
 and for your goals.

1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:28.660

1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:56.580
 at the beginning of this podcast episode.

1:48:56.580 --> 1:48:58.980
 That's perhaps the best way to support our podcast.

1:48:58.980 --> 1:49:00.660
 In addition, we have a Patreon.

1:49:00.660 --> 1:49:03.460
 It's patreon.com slash Andrew Huberman,

1:49:03.460 --> 1:49:05.200
 and there you can support the podcast

1:49:05.200 --> 1:49:06.740
 at any level that you like.

1:49:06.740 --> 1:49:09.480
 During today's podcast and in many previous episodes

1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:12.120
 of the Huberman Lab Podcast, I mentioned supplements.

1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:14.720
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:17.620
 many people derive tremendous benefit from supplements.

1:49:17.620 --> 1:49:19.540
 Supplements for sleep, supplements for focus,

1:49:19.540 --> 1:49:20.940
 supplements for various other things

1:49:20.940 --> 1:49:23.800
 related to mental and physical health and performance.

1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:27.020
 One key issue anytime there's a discussion about supplements

1:49:27.020 --> 1:49:30.060
 is you have to be sure that the supplements you are taking

1:49:30.060 --> 1:49:31.460
 are of the very highest quality.

1:49:31.460 --> 1:49:33.580
 And for that reason, we've partnered with Thorne

1:49:33.580 --> 1:49:35.740
 because Thorne has the very highest stringency

1:49:35.740 --> 1:49:38.220
 with respect to the quality of the ingredients they include

1:49:38.220 --> 1:49:40.480
 and the precision of the amounts of the ingredients

1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:42.540
 that they include in their supplements.

1:49:42.540 --> 1:49:44.780
 If you'd like to see the supplements that I take

1:49:44.780 --> 1:49:46.860
 and get 20% off any of those supplements,

1:49:46.860 --> 1:49:51.740
 you can go to thorne.com slash the letter U slash Huberman.

1:49:51.740 --> 1:49:54.340
 And in addition to being able to get 20% off

1:49:54.340 --> 1:49:55.400
 any of those supplements,

1:49:55.400 --> 1:49:57.340
 if you navigate deeper into the Thorne site

1:49:57.340 --> 1:50:00.700
 through that web portal, thorne.com slash U slash Huberman,

1:50:00.700 --> 1:50:03.360
 you can also get 20% off any of the other supplements

1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:04.480
 that Thorne makes.

1:50:04.480 --> 1:50:07.220
 If you're not already following us on Instagram and Twitter,

1:50:07.220 --> 1:50:08.980
 please feel free to do so.

1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:12.100
 There I teach neuroscience and neuroscience related tools

1:50:12.100 --> 1:50:13.640
 in short format.

1:50:13.640 --> 1:50:15.060
 Some of that material overlaps

1:50:15.060 --> 1:50:16.340
 with what you hear on the podcast.

1:50:16.340 --> 1:50:17.840
 Some of it is unique and different

1:50:17.840 --> 1:50:19.300
 from what's on the podcast.

1:50:19.300 --> 1:50:21.000
 And once again, I want to thank you

1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:24.940
 for going on this journey of exploring the neuroscience

1:50:24.940 --> 1:50:28.100
 and the psychology of habit formation and habit breaking.

1:50:28.100 --> 1:50:29.940
 I hope it supports you in your goals.

1:50:29.940 --> 1:50:32.100
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:50:32.100 --> 1:50:33.860
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:50:33.860 --> 1:51:01.860
 And I'll see you in the next one.
