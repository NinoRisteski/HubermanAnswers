00:00.000 --> 00:02.280
 Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,

00:02.280 --> 00:04.880
 where we discuss science and science-based tools

00:04.880 --> 00:05.900
 for everyday life.

00:09.160 --> 00:10.160
 I'm Andrew Huberman,

00:10.160 --> 00:13.160
 and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology

00:13.160 --> 00:15.040
 at Stanford School of Medicine.

00:15.040 --> 00:17.040
 Today, we're talking all about sleep

00:17.040 --> 00:19.320
 and how to optimize your sleep.

00:19.320 --> 00:22.240
 This is a topic we've covered previously on this podcast

00:22.240 --> 00:24.700
 in the episode called Master Your Sleep.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.040
 However, since the airing of that episode,

00:27.040 --> 00:29.520
 there's been some terrific new science to come out.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.120
 I've also received thousands,

00:31.120 --> 00:33.320
 yes, literally thousands of questions

00:33.320 --> 00:36.480
 related to the specific protocols covered in that episode,

00:36.480 --> 00:39.900
 as well as in the episode on jet lag and shift work.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.800
 And while today's episode is not specifically

00:41.800 --> 00:43.420
 about jet lag and shift work,

00:43.420 --> 00:45.400
 we are going to cover tools that will allow you

00:45.400 --> 00:49.160
 to shift your schedule if you need to for work or travel.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.320
 And we will also cover tools

00:51.320 --> 00:53.160
 that will allow you to fall back asleep

00:53.160 --> 00:55.200
 if you happen to wake up in the middle of the night,

00:55.200 --> 00:56.600
 or if you get a poor night's sleep,

00:56.600 --> 00:58.540
 how to actually recover from that poor night's sleep

00:58.540 --> 01:00.640
 more quickly, and yes indeed,

01:00.640 --> 01:03.080
 even replace sleep that you've lost.

01:03.080 --> 01:05.400
 So today's episode is going to be filled

01:05.400 --> 01:06.520
 with practical tools.

01:06.520 --> 01:08.800
 We will touch on some of the underlying science,

01:08.800 --> 01:11.440
 but it's really designed to be a practical toolkit

01:11.440 --> 01:13.020
 for optimizing your sleep,

01:13.020 --> 01:15.120
 depending on your specific sleep needs.

01:15.120 --> 01:17.080
 Various times throughout today's episode,

01:17.080 --> 01:19.600
 I will refer to studies that form the backbone

01:19.600 --> 01:21.440
 of the tools that I'll be describing,

01:21.440 --> 01:24.480
 but whereas most of the podcast episodes here

01:24.480 --> 01:26.720
 tend to be deep scientific mechanism,

01:26.720 --> 01:28.480
 and then tools, scientific mechanism,

01:28.480 --> 01:30.600
 and tools today, I'm mainly going to focus

01:30.600 --> 01:33.600
 on the practical tools that anyone, indeed,

01:33.600 --> 01:35.160
 all people I believe should use

01:35.160 --> 01:36.880
 in order to optimize their sleep.

01:36.880 --> 01:39.240
 Why should everybody want to optimize their sleep

01:39.240 --> 01:42.480
 and put considerable effort into optimizing their sleep?

01:42.480 --> 01:46.400
 Well, put simply, sleep is the foundation of mental health,

01:46.400 --> 01:48.440
 physical health, and performance of all kinds,

01:48.440 --> 01:50.960
 cognitive performance, physical performance, et cetera.

01:50.960 --> 01:53.720
 It also controls things like our immune system,

01:53.720 --> 01:57.320
 wound healing, our skin health, and our appearance.

01:57.320 --> 01:59.800
 Whether or not we can think clearly or not,

01:59.800 --> 02:01.240
 whether or not we will live

02:01.240 --> 02:03.900
 as long as we possibly can or not,

02:03.900 --> 02:05.200
 whether or not we suffer

02:05.200 --> 02:08.880
 from dramatic age-related cognitive decline or not,

02:08.880 --> 02:11.920
 in other words, whether or not we keep our memory as we age,

02:11.920 --> 02:14.140
 I could go on and on about all the terrible things

02:14.140 --> 02:17.520
 that can happen to somebody if they don't sleep well.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.600
 Thanks to the great work of Professor Matt Walker

02:20.600 --> 02:22.100
 at University of California, Berkeley,

02:22.100 --> 02:24.720
 and the wonderful book that he wrote, Why We Sleep,

02:24.720 --> 02:27.000
 I think the world is largely on board now

02:27.000 --> 02:29.280
 that sleep is critical to our health,

02:29.280 --> 02:31.980
 our mental health, our physical health, and our performance.

02:31.980 --> 02:35.800
 But what's not often discussed is how great life is,

02:35.800 --> 02:38.040
 that is, how much more focused and energetic

02:38.040 --> 02:39.840
 and how positive our mood gets

02:39.840 --> 02:42.720
 when we are sleeping for the appropriate amount of time

02:42.720 --> 02:44.360
 at the appropriate depth

02:44.360 --> 02:46.280
 and when we are doing that regularly.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.960
 Basically, everything in life gets better

02:47.960 --> 02:48.780
 when we're sleeping well.

02:48.780 --> 02:50.720
 So today, I'm going to teach you the tools

02:50.720 --> 02:53.280
 that will allow you to optimize your sleep,

02:53.280 --> 02:55.720
 that is, get to sleep and stay asleep,

02:55.720 --> 02:58.360
 fall back asleep if you wake up in the middle of the night,

02:58.360 --> 03:00.880
 and adjust your sleep given the various life demands

03:00.880 --> 03:02.160
 you may be experiencing.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.040
 I'm pleased to announce that the Huberman Lab Podcast

03:04.040 --> 03:06.360
 is now partnered with Momentus Supplements.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.600
 We partnered with Momentus for several important reasons.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.300
 First of all, they ship internationally

03:10.300 --> 03:12.200
 because we know that many of you are located

03:12.200 --> 03:15.080
 outside of the United States, that's valuable.

03:15.080 --> 03:17.080
 Second of all, and perhaps most important,

03:17.080 --> 03:19.640
 the quality of their supplements is second to none,

03:19.640 --> 03:21.300
 both in terms of purity and precision

03:21.300 --> 03:23.240
 of the amounts of the ingredients.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.880
 Third, we've really emphasized supplements

03:25.880 --> 03:28.080
 that are single ingredient supplements

03:28.080 --> 03:30.140
 and that are supplied in dosages

03:30.140 --> 03:33.120
 that allow you to build a supplementation protocol

03:33.120 --> 03:34.960
 that's optimized for cost,

03:34.960 --> 03:36.820
 that's optimized for effectiveness,

03:36.820 --> 03:38.960
 and that you can add things and remove things

03:38.960 --> 03:40.300
 from your protocol in a way

03:40.300 --> 03:42.000
 that's really systematic and scientific.

03:42.000 --> 03:44.240
 This is really hard to do if you're taking blends

03:44.240 --> 03:45.200
 of different supplements,

03:45.200 --> 03:47.960
 or if the dosages are such that you can't titrate,

03:47.960 --> 03:51.340
 or that is adjust the dosages of a given supplement.

03:51.340 --> 03:54.000
 So by using single ingredient supplements,

03:54.000 --> 03:55.680
 you can really build out the supplement kit

03:55.680 --> 03:58.760
 that's ideal for you and your specific needs.

03:58.760 --> 03:59.940
 If you'd like to see the supplements

03:59.940 --> 04:01.280
 that we partner with Momentus on,

04:01.280 --> 04:04.380
 you can go to livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

04:04.380 --> 04:05.500
 There you'll see those supplements,

04:05.500 --> 04:07.960
 and just keep in mind that we are constantly expanding

04:07.960 --> 04:10.660
 the library of supplements available through Momentus

04:10.660 --> 04:11.600
 on a regular basis.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.280
 Again, that's livemomentus.com slash Huberman.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.960
 Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast

04:16.960 --> 04:19.680
 is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.

04:19.680 --> 04:21.720
 It is, however, part of my desire and effort

04:21.720 --> 04:24.160
 to bring zero cost to consumer information about science

04:24.160 --> 04:26.760
 and science-related tools to the general public.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.820
 In keeping with that theme,

04:27.820 --> 04:30.600
 I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.920
 Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.

04:32.920 --> 04:35.360
 Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform

04:35.360 --> 04:38.020
 that analyzes data from your blood and DNA

04:38.020 --> 04:40.380
 to help you better meet your health goals.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.800
 I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done

04:42.800 --> 04:45.200
 for the simple reason that many of the factors

04:45.200 --> 04:47.260
 that impact your immediate and long-term health

04:47.260 --> 04:49.600
 can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.160
 And nowadays, with the advent of modern DNA tests,

04:52.160 --> 04:53.960
 you can also get insight into, for instance,

04:53.960 --> 04:55.440
 what your biological age is

04:55.440 --> 04:57.340
 and compare that to your chronological age.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.080
 And of course, your biological age

04:59.080 --> 05:01.360
 is really the age that counts.

05:01.360 --> 05:02.440
 The problem with a lot of blood tests

05:02.440 --> 05:04.200
 and DNA tests out there, however,

05:04.200 --> 05:05.780
 is that you get information back

05:05.780 --> 05:07.360
 about the levels of metabolic factors,

05:07.360 --> 05:08.920
 lipids, hormones, et cetera,

05:08.920 --> 05:10.760
 but you don't know what to do with that information.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.280
 Inside Tracker makes that all very easy to navigate.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.120
 They have a personalized platform.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.520
 So this is a web portal where you can go,

05:17.520 --> 05:20.000
 you'll see the numbers from your blood tests and DNA tests,

05:20.000 --> 05:21.420
 and then it will tell you, for instance,

05:21.420 --> 05:23.760
 how you could adjust various aspects of your nutrition

05:23.760 --> 05:25.720
 or your exercise or supplementation

05:25.720 --> 05:27.200
 in order to bring those numbers

05:27.200 --> 05:29.420
 into the ranges that are best for you.

05:29.420 --> 05:30.800
 If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,

05:30.800 --> 05:33.620
 you can go to insidetracker.com slash Huberman

05:33.620 --> 05:36.160

05:36.160 --> 05:40.120
 That's insidetracker.com slash Huberman to get 20% off.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.620
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Eight Sleep.

05:42.620 --> 05:44.200
 Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers

05:44.200 --> 05:47.360
 with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capabilities.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.760
 It turns out that your body temperature

05:49.760 --> 05:51.720
 and your ability to fall and stay asleep

05:51.720 --> 05:53.800
 are very closely related.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.640
 If your body does not drop by one to three degrees,

05:56.640 --> 05:58.600
 you are simply not going to get into deep sleep

05:58.600 --> 06:00.180
 or stay in deep sleep.

06:00.180 --> 06:02.480
 And waking up, it also turns out,

06:02.480 --> 06:03.800
 is related to body temperature.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.460
 Every time you wake up in the morning,

06:05.460 --> 06:08.000
 your body is warming up in order to wake you up.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.580
 And this has an enormous number of hormonal and metabolic

06:10.580 --> 06:12.440
 and other cascades that are vitally important,

06:12.440 --> 06:14.280
 not just to what happens while you sleep,

06:14.280 --> 06:15.880
 but your health and your energy

06:15.880 --> 06:17.680
 and focus throughout the day.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.680
 Eight Sleep is an incredible device.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.440
 It's one that I've been using for six months or so,

06:22.440 --> 06:24.160
 and it's completely transformed my sleep.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.400
 And I already thought I was sleeping pretty well.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.600
 The way it works is that you can cool or heat your mattress

06:29.600 --> 06:32.520
 according to different times throughout the night.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.180
 So for instance, you can cool your mattress

06:34.180 --> 06:35.440
 if you tend to run warm,

06:35.440 --> 06:37.540
 and that will help you fall and stay deeply asleep.

06:37.540 --> 06:38.600
 And then toward morning,

06:38.600 --> 06:40.480
 you can have the mattress programmed,

06:40.480 --> 06:42.400
 or I should say the mattress cover programmed

06:42.400 --> 06:44.580
 so that you warm up your sleeping environment

06:44.580 --> 06:46.720
 and you wake up when you want to wake up.

06:46.720 --> 06:48.280
 If you've been sleeping pretty well,

06:48.280 --> 06:49.500
 but waking up in the middle of the night,

06:49.500 --> 06:51.640
 you might also find that by cooling your mattress

06:51.640 --> 06:54.280
 even further toward the middle of your sleep bout,

06:54.280 --> 06:57.120
 well, you'll stay in deep sleep much longer.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.320
 If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,

06:58.320 --> 07:00.920
 you can go to eightsleep.com slash Huberman

07:00.920 --> 07:04.800
 to check out the PodPro cover and save $150 at checkout.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.440
 Eight Sleep currently ships within the US, Canada,

07:07.440 --> 07:08.380
 and the United Kingdom.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.780

 to save $150 at checkout.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.560
 Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.960
 Element is an electrolyte drink

07:16.960 --> 07:18.240
 that has everything you need

07:18.240 --> 07:21.040
 in order to get your brain and body to function at its best,

07:21.040 --> 07:23.860
 but none of the things you don't, in particular, sugar.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.460
 Electrolytes are vitally important

07:25.460 --> 07:27.680
 to the way that your neurons, your nerve cells work,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.620
 and indeed to the way that all the cells of your body work.

07:30.620 --> 07:32.080
 But your nervous system and your neurons

07:32.080 --> 07:34.360
 particularly depend on electrolytes

07:34.360 --> 07:36.240
 because you need the electrolytes,

07:36.240 --> 07:39.160
 sodium, magnesium, and potassium in the proper ratios

07:39.160 --> 07:40.440
 in order for those nerve cells

07:40.440 --> 07:42.320
 to fire what are called action potentials,

07:42.320 --> 07:43.920
 which are the electrical signals

07:43.920 --> 07:45.180
 that allow your neurons to work

07:45.180 --> 07:46.440
 and to allow you to do everything

07:46.440 --> 07:47.880
 from remembering information

07:47.880 --> 07:50.500
 to moving your muscles deliberately.

07:50.500 --> 07:52.920
 When you exercise, or even if you don't,

07:52.920 --> 07:54.740
 you can get quite low on electrolytes,

07:54.740 --> 07:57.120
 especially on a hot day, you can get dehydrated.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.640
 There are a lot of different ways

07:58.640 --> 08:00.800
 to replenish your fluids and electrolytes,

08:00.800 --> 08:02.520
 and there are a lot of different electrolyte drinks

08:02.520 --> 08:05.120
 out there, but many of them contain a lot of sugar.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.760
 And some of those that don't contain a lot of sugar

08:07.760 --> 08:09.100
 don't have the proper ratios

08:09.100 --> 08:10.840
 of sodium, magnesium, and potassium.

08:10.840 --> 08:11.940
 If you'd like to try Element,

08:11.940 --> 08:16.160
 you can go to Drink Element, that's lmnt.com slash Huberman,

08:16.160 --> 08:18.120

08:22.160 --> 08:24.040
 to claim a free sample pack.

08:24.040 --> 08:27.580
 Let's talk about sleep and tools to optimize your sleep.

08:28.540 --> 08:31.360
 I want you to conceptualize yourself

08:31.360 --> 08:36.360
 as contained within a room that has only very few windows

08:37.080 --> 08:39.320
 or very few entry points.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.160
 What do I mean by this?

08:40.160 --> 08:43.560
 Well, your brain and your nervous system

08:43.560 --> 08:45.960
 control whether or not you move or don't move.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.840
 They control whether or not you're digesting food

08:47.840 --> 08:49.920
 or you're not digesting food.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.720
 They control whether or not you're stressed or not stressed,

08:51.720 --> 08:53.580
 happy or sad, et cetera.

08:53.580 --> 08:57.080
 All of that stuff that controls all that stuff

08:57.080 --> 09:00.800
 is housed inside your skin and skull, et cetera.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.560
 That might seem pretty obvious,

09:02.560 --> 09:06.520
 but what that means is that for your brain and body

09:06.520 --> 09:11.280
 to feel alert and focused, ready to move and exercise

09:11.280 --> 09:14.440
 or do some work, or if your brain and body

09:14.440 --> 09:17.320
 are going to lie down and go to sleep,

09:17.320 --> 09:20.980
 well, that brain and body needs cues.

09:20.980 --> 09:22.920
 It needs inputs to determine

09:22.920 --> 09:25.780
 when to do those different things.

09:25.780 --> 09:29.880
 And those cues and inputs arrive through a defined set

09:29.880 --> 09:31.060
 of what I'll call stimuli,

09:31.060 --> 09:34.200
 but you can also think of these as levers or tools.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.260
 The main levers and tools that are going to allow you

09:37.260 --> 09:40.600
 to control when you are awake and when you are asleep

09:40.600 --> 09:43.520
 and to get better sleep every single night

09:43.520 --> 09:48.040
 are light, literally photons, light energy,

09:48.040 --> 09:49.960
 could be from sunlight, could be from artificial light.

09:49.960 --> 09:52.920
 We will discuss those particulars in a moment,

09:52.920 --> 09:55.120
 as well as darkness.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.840
 That is the absence of light.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.360
 So we've got light and dark.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.220
 Those are two very powerful tools

10:02.220 --> 10:04.640
 to encourage your nervous system to be in one state

10:04.640 --> 10:06.440
 or another, meaning awake or asleep.

10:07.380 --> 10:11.040
 Temperature is another tool or lever.

10:11.040 --> 10:14.260
 Turns out that when your body is cooling down,

10:14.260 --> 10:18.080
 you have a greater tendency to fall and stay asleep.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.140
 In fact, every night when you actually sleep,

10:21.140 --> 10:23.520
 your body is dropping by one to three degrees,

10:23.520 --> 10:26.560
 and that drop in temperature is required.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.120
 It's like a gate that your body has to go through

10:29.120 --> 10:31.740
 in order for you to get into sleep.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.700
 And in fact, the converse is also true.

10:33.700 --> 10:37.060
 If your body heats up by one to three degrees or so,

10:37.060 --> 10:38.480
 you will wake up.

10:38.480 --> 10:43.480
 So you've got light, dark, temperature, food.

10:43.600 --> 10:47.640
 And when we say food, we mean what we eat,

10:47.640 --> 10:51.120
 when we eat, and the amount that we eat.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.360
 Okay, so light, dark, temperature, food, exercise.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.720
 And of course, exercise comes in different forms.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.320
 We can do cardiovascular exercise.

10:58.320 --> 11:01.860
 That can be low intensity, long distance exercise.

11:01.860 --> 11:03.440
 It can be high intensity,

11:03.440 --> 11:05.480
 so-called high intensity interval training.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.560
 It could be weight training, it could be yoga,

11:07.560 --> 11:09.880
 it could be swimming, any number of different activities.

11:09.880 --> 11:13.320
 But exercise in general causes an increase

11:13.320 --> 11:17.280
 in body temperature and tends to make us more alert,

11:17.280 --> 11:18.800
 not just during the exercise,

11:18.800 --> 11:21.880
 but in the immediate hours after that exercise.

11:21.880 --> 11:23.140
 Exercise does some other things

11:23.140 --> 11:24.400
 that relate to our sleep as well,

11:24.400 --> 11:25.680
 and we'll talk about those today

11:25.680 --> 11:27.080
 and how you can leverage them.

11:27.080 --> 11:30.880
 Another potent lever for adjusting your sleepiness

11:30.880 --> 11:33.960
 and wakefulness is caffeine.

11:33.960 --> 11:36.360
 This, of course, comes as no surprise to people,

11:36.360 --> 11:39.320
 but why and how caffeine works

11:39.320 --> 11:42.640
 might come as a surprise very briefly.

11:42.640 --> 11:45.400
 We have a molecule in our body called adenosine,

11:45.400 --> 11:47.520
 and the longer we have been awake,

11:47.520 --> 11:49.800
 the more adenosine builds up in our brain and body,

11:49.800 --> 11:52.760
 and adenosine is part of the reason why we get sleepy.

11:52.760 --> 11:55.560
 Caffeine effectively operates

11:55.560 --> 11:58.200
 as a adenosine antagonist.

11:58.200 --> 12:01.560
 It works by basically occupying the receptor for adenosine,

12:01.560 --> 12:03.840
 so it's a little bit of a convoluted mechanism,

12:03.840 --> 12:05.560
 but basically all you need to know

12:05.560 --> 12:08.680
 is that caffeine prevents the actions of adenosine.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.520
 That's one of the reasons why caffeine makes us feel alert.

12:11.520 --> 12:14.000
 But how much caffeine we drink and when we drink caffeine

12:14.000 --> 12:15.400
 turns out to be vitally important

12:15.400 --> 12:18.800
 for adjusting our wakefulness and for optimizing our sleep.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.100
 So we'll talk about that as well.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.800
 The other category of lever tools,

12:21.800 --> 12:25.000
 which are immensely powerful for optimizing sleep,

12:25.000 --> 12:26.800
 are supplements.

12:26.800 --> 12:29.920
 There now exist as many as eight different supplements

12:29.920 --> 12:33.360
 that can powerfully modulate sleep in healthy ways

12:33.360 --> 12:35.920
 and that have huge margins for safety.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.360
 We're going to talk about what those supplements are.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.160
 In previous episodes of this podcast

12:40.160 --> 12:42.480
 and as a guest on other podcasts,

12:42.480 --> 12:44.440
 I've talked about three particular supplements,

12:44.440 --> 12:48.540
 magnesium threonate, apigenin, and theanine,

12:48.540 --> 12:51.040
 which together can really enhance the speed

12:51.040 --> 12:52.320
 at which one falls asleep

12:52.320 --> 12:54.620
 and people's ability to stay asleep

12:54.620 --> 12:56.720
 and to really get into those deep stages of sleep,

12:56.720 --> 12:58.200
 they're particularly restorative.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.800
 Today, we're going to talk a little bit more

12:59.800 --> 13:00.860
 about each of those three

13:00.860 --> 13:03.240
 and how they can best be used in combination.

13:03.240 --> 13:05.860
 We are also going to touch on some other supplements

13:05.860 --> 13:09.120
 that I have not talked about much before, if at all.

13:09.120 --> 13:13.180
 Things like glycine and GABA, as well as inositol.

13:13.180 --> 13:15.680
 Many people are going to find inositol interesting

13:15.680 --> 13:18.160
 and of particular use to them,

13:18.160 --> 13:20.900
 especially if they're following a low carbohydrate diet

13:20.900 --> 13:23.620
 or if they are fasting before sleep

13:23.620 --> 13:26.440
 or just trying to avoid eating too close to bedtime

13:26.440 --> 13:29.160
 and yet they're having a hard time falling asleep.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.560
 Inositol also turns out to be especially useful

13:31.560 --> 13:33.720
 for people who have a tendency to wake up

13:33.720 --> 13:34.560
 in the middle of the night

13:34.560 --> 13:36.400
 and have a hard time falling back asleep.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.840
 It also has some interesting and potent effects

13:38.840 --> 13:40.200
 on anxiety throughout the day.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.580
 So we're going to talk about inositol as a tool as well.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.720
 And then last in our list of general categories

13:45.720 --> 13:50.160
 of levers and tools for optimizing sleep are digital tools.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.700
 When we say digital tools, I don't necessarily mean devices.

13:52.700 --> 13:56.220
 What I mean are things like non-sleep deep rest scripts.

13:56.220 --> 13:59.240
 These are zero cost scripts that you listen to

13:59.240 --> 14:01.360
 that take your body through some deep relaxation

14:01.360 --> 14:05.000
 and that can help people both fall asleep, stay asleep,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.920
 fall back asleep, and get better at sleeping.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.360
 And also going to talk about digital tools

14:10.360 --> 14:11.820
 related to self-hypnosis.

14:11.820 --> 14:14.220
 This is distinctly different from stage hypnosis.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.080
 So I know some of you hear hypnosis and you think,

14:16.080 --> 14:18.940
 oh, you know, people, you know, clucking like chickens

14:18.940 --> 14:21.040
 and doing things that are outside their control.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.640
 That's not at all what I'm referring to here.

14:22.640 --> 14:26.680
 I'm talking about clinically and research supported tools

14:26.680 --> 14:29.560
 that have been shown to enhance people's ability

14:29.560 --> 14:30.800
 to fall and stay asleep

14:30.800 --> 14:34.160
 and that can get you far better at sleeping.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.920
 So again, to recap the list of levers and tools,

14:36.920 --> 14:39.120
 we've got light and dark,

14:39.120 --> 14:40.520
 that includes the intensity of light,

14:40.520 --> 14:41.680
 the timing of light, et cetera.

14:41.680 --> 14:45.400
 We've got temperature, we have food, we have exercise,

14:45.400 --> 14:49.120
 caffeine, supplements, and digital tools,

14:49.120 --> 14:50.700
 not just limited to devices,

14:50.700 --> 14:54.200
 but zero cost tools that you can access on YouTube

14:54.200 --> 14:55.800
 and elsewhere in various apps

14:55.800 --> 14:57.640
 that can really help you optimize your sleep.

14:57.640 --> 14:59.280
 So today we're going to talk about all of these.

14:59.280 --> 15:01.680
 I really want to provide you as many tools as possible,

15:01.680 --> 15:03.440
 give you the logic behind each of those tools

15:03.440 --> 15:05.620
 and when and how best to apply them

15:05.620 --> 15:08.520
 so that you can develop the sleep toolkit

15:08.520 --> 15:10.660
 that's ideal for your sleep needs.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.240
 As we head into our description

15:12.240 --> 15:14.560
 of tools for optimizing sleep,

15:14.560 --> 15:18.360
 let's consider what the perfect 24 hour cycle

15:18.360 --> 15:19.920
 would look like.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.580
 Let's start this 24 hour cycle

15:21.580 --> 15:23.340
 with when you wake up in the morning.

15:23.340 --> 15:25.320
 So for some of you, that will be 5 a.m.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.360
 For others of you, that will be 10 a.m.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.560
 Most people I believe wake up sometime

15:29.560 --> 15:32.700
 between 6.30 a.m. and 8.30 a.m.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.320
 But regardless of when you wake up in the morning,

15:35.320 --> 15:36.920
 one of the first things that happens

15:36.920 --> 15:39.780
 is that your body temperature is increasing

15:39.780 --> 15:41.800
 and that's just going to happen naturally.

15:41.800 --> 15:43.400
 Some of it is going to be the consequence

15:43.400 --> 15:45.000
 of your moving around a bit,

15:45.000 --> 15:47.440
 but really the increase in body temperature

15:47.440 --> 15:50.020
 is one of the main triggers for why you woke up

15:50.020 --> 15:51.180
 in the first place.

15:52.180 --> 15:55.040
 That increase in body temperature in turn

15:55.040 --> 15:57.380
 causes an increase in the release of a hormone

15:57.380 --> 15:59.000
 called cortisol.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.880
 Cortisol is often discussed as a stress hormone,

16:01.880 --> 16:03.900
 but it's not just associated with stress.

16:03.900 --> 16:06.520
 It also enhances your immune system

16:06.520 --> 16:09.780
 provided cortisol is elevated at the right times

16:09.780 --> 16:11.680
 and the right time for cortisol to be elevated

16:11.680 --> 16:13.940
 is when you first wake up in the morning.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.960
 That increase in cortisol

16:15.960 --> 16:18.920
 is also going to increase metabolism.

16:18.920 --> 16:22.520
 It's also going to increase your ability to focus mentally

16:22.520 --> 16:24.760
 and for you to move your body.

16:24.760 --> 16:27.880
 So again, cortisol is often demonized

16:27.880 --> 16:29.140
 and considered this bad thing.

16:29.140 --> 16:31.960
 And indeed you don't want cortisol to be chronically

16:31.960 --> 16:34.720
 or consistently elevated throughout the day or night,

16:34.720 --> 16:38.400
 but you do want cortisol to reach its peak early in the day

16:38.400 --> 16:40.860
 right about the time you wake up.

16:40.860 --> 16:43.720
 One way that you can ensure that that cortisol peak

16:43.720 --> 16:45.040
 occurs early in the day,

16:45.040 --> 16:47.080
 right about the time that you wake up

16:47.080 --> 16:50.800
 is to view bright light, ideally from sunlight

16:50.800 --> 16:54.300
 within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.080
 That's right.

16:56.080 --> 17:00.640
 View bright sunlight within the first 30 to 60 minutes

17:00.640 --> 17:01.880
 after waking.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.020
 I'll get into all the caveats about what happens

17:04.020 --> 17:05.520
 if you wake up before the sun is out,

17:05.520 --> 17:07.440
 what if you live in the UK where there is no sun

17:07.440 --> 17:08.580
 or people claim there is no sun.

17:08.580 --> 17:12.120
 Hate to tell you this folks, but there is sun in the UK.

17:12.120 --> 17:13.300
 We'll talk about all that.

17:13.300 --> 17:17.280
 But everybody, whether or not you live in a cloudy place

17:17.280 --> 17:19.680
 or a sunny place, whether or not there's cloud cover

17:19.680 --> 17:23.500
 or not that day should really strive to get bright light

17:23.500 --> 17:25.480
 in your eyes, ideally from sunlight

17:25.480 --> 17:29.140
 within the first 30 to 60 minutes after waking.

17:29.140 --> 17:31.600
 The reason for that is very simple.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.360
 You want to trigger that cortisol increase to occur

17:34.360 --> 17:37.040
 very early in your day.

17:37.040 --> 17:39.560
 And you don't want that cortisol peak to happen later

17:39.560 --> 17:42.560
 which is what will happen if you wait to get outside

17:42.560 --> 17:43.600
 and see sunlight.

17:44.860 --> 17:47.960
 The reason for this is that you have a set of neurons,

17:47.960 --> 17:49.320
 nerve cells in your eye.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.880
 They're called intrinsically photosensitive

17:50.880 --> 17:53.560
 melanopsin cells, but you do not need to know that name.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.480
 Those neurons respond best to bright light

17:56.480 --> 17:59.760
 and especially right after waking early in the day,

17:59.760 --> 18:02.760
 they are best able to signal to a set of neurons

18:02.760 --> 18:04.720
 that reside over the roof of your mouth

18:04.720 --> 18:06.180
 called the suprachiasmatic nucleus,

18:06.180 --> 18:08.360
 which is a cluster of neurons that then sends

18:08.360 --> 18:11.040
 a huge number of other signals, electrical and chemical

18:11.040 --> 18:13.840
 out to your entire body that triggers

18:13.840 --> 18:16.120
 that cortisol increase, provides a wake up signal

18:16.120 --> 18:19.320
 for your brain and body and sets in motion a timer

18:19.320 --> 18:21.440
 for you to fall asleep later that night.

18:21.440 --> 18:22.760
 So again, we're not trying to go

18:22.760 --> 18:24.000
 into too much mechanism today.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.840
 We are trying to really hammer on tools

18:25.840 --> 18:28.280
 and I'll substantiate those tools just a bit

18:28.280 --> 18:30.920
 with some mechanism, but here's what you do

18:30.920 --> 18:31.880
 or at least here's what I do.

18:31.880 --> 18:35.200
 I wake up in the morning and I want to reach for my phone.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.600
 But I know that even if I were to crank up the brightness

18:37.600 --> 18:40.320
 on that phone screen, it's not bright enough

18:40.320 --> 18:42.120
 to trigger that cortisol spike.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.920
 And for me to be at my most alert and focused

18:45.920 --> 18:48.000
 throughout the day and to optimize my sleep at night.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.880
 So what I do is I get out of bed and I go outside

18:51.880 --> 18:56.880
 and if it's a bright clear day and the sun is low in the sky

18:57.040 --> 18:59.040
 or the sun is starting to get overhead,

18:59.040 --> 19:00.560
 what we call low solar angle,

19:00.560 --> 19:03.620
 then I know I'm getting outside at the right time.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.160
 If there's cloud cover and I can't see the sun,

19:08.160 --> 19:09.760
 I also know I'm doing a good thing

19:09.760 --> 19:11.940
 because it turns out, especially on cloudy days,

19:11.940 --> 19:14.040
 you want to get outside and get as much light energy

19:14.040 --> 19:15.800
 or photons in your eyes.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.680
 But let's say it's a very clear day

19:17.680 --> 19:19.800
 and I can see where the sun is.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.600
 I do not need to stare directly into the sun.

19:22.600 --> 19:25.580
 If it's very low in the sky, I might do that

19:25.580 --> 19:27.880
 because it's not going to be very painful to my eyes.

19:27.880 --> 19:30.440
 However, if the sun is a little bit brighter

19:30.440 --> 19:31.920
 and a little bit higher in the sky,

19:31.920 --> 19:33.600
 sometimes it can be painful to look at.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.320
 So the way to get this sunlight viewing early in the day

19:37.320 --> 19:40.000
 is to look toward the sun.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.320
 If it's too bright to look at directly,

19:42.320 --> 19:43.300
 well, then don't do that.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.560
 You just look toward it, but not directly at it.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.720
 It's absolutely fine to blink.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.020
 In fact, I encourage you to blink

19:49.020 --> 19:51.460
 whenever you feel the impulse to blink.

19:51.460 --> 19:54.200
 Never look at any light, sunlight or otherwise

19:54.200 --> 19:55.880
 that's so bright that it's painful to look at

19:55.880 --> 19:57.520
 because you can damage your eyes.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.840
 But for this morning sunlight viewing,

19:59.840 --> 20:01.880
 it's best to not wear sunglasses.

20:01.880 --> 20:04.260
 That's right, to not wear sunglasses,

20:04.260 --> 20:07.000
 at least for this morning sunlight viewing.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.640
 It is absolutely fine to wear eyeglasses or contact lenses,

20:11.640 --> 20:12.760
 so-called corrective lenses.

20:12.760 --> 20:15.840
 In fact, those will serve you well in this practice

20:15.840 --> 20:17.700
 or this tool because they will focus the light

20:17.700 --> 20:19.680
 onto your neural retina and onto those melanopsin

20:19.680 --> 20:21.760
 intrinsically photosensitive ganglion cells.

20:21.760 --> 20:26.160
 If your eyeglasses or contact lenses have UV protection,

20:26.160 --> 20:27.320
 that's okay.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.760
 There's so many different wavelengths of light

20:28.760 --> 20:31.420
 coming from the sun and they are bright enough

20:31.420 --> 20:33.120
 that they will trigger the mechanisms

20:33.120 --> 20:36.920
 that you want triggered at this early time of day.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.600
 So try and get outside,

20:38.600 --> 20:40.420
 ideally within the first five minutes of waking,

20:40.420 --> 20:42.240
 or maybe it's 15 minutes,

20:42.240 --> 20:44.780
 but certainly within the first hour after waking.

20:44.780 --> 20:46.920
 I want to share with you three critical things

20:46.920 --> 20:49.260
 about this tool of morning sunlight viewing.

20:49.260 --> 20:53.040
 First of all, this is not some woo biology thing.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.980
 This is grounded in the core of our physiology.

20:55.980 --> 20:58.120
 There are literally hundreds, if not thousands

20:58.120 --> 21:00.860
 of quality peer reviewed papers showing that

21:00.860 --> 21:03.040
 light viewing early in the day

21:03.040 --> 21:05.400
 is the most powerful stimulus for wakefulness

21:05.400 --> 21:06.240
 throughout the day

21:06.240 --> 21:08.840
 and it has a powerful positive impact

21:08.840 --> 21:10.960
 on your ability to fall and stay asleep at night.

21:10.960 --> 21:13.920
 So this is really the foundational power tool

21:13.920 --> 21:16.540
 for ensuring a great night's sleep

21:16.540 --> 21:19.080
 and for feeling more awake during the day.

21:19.080 --> 21:23.620
 Second of all, if you wake up before the sun is out,

21:24.580 --> 21:28.340
 you can and probably should flip on artificial lights

21:28.340 --> 21:30.760
 in your internal home environment or apartment

21:30.760 --> 21:32.140
 or wherever you happen to live.

21:32.140 --> 21:34.000
 If your goal is to be awake, right?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.100
 If you wake up at four in the morning

21:35.100 --> 21:36.000
 and you need to be awake,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.500
 well then turn on artificial lights.

21:38.500 --> 21:42.600
 Once the sun is out, however, once the sun has risen,

21:42.600 --> 21:45.320
 then you still want to get outside and view sunlight.

21:46.260 --> 21:49.260
 Some of you will wake up before the sun comes out

21:49.260 --> 21:51.800
 and if you're asking whether or not turning

21:51.800 --> 21:54.800
 on artificial lights can replace sunlight at those hours,

21:54.800 --> 21:57.860
 unfortunately, the answer is no.

21:57.860 --> 21:59.520
 Unless you have a very special light,

21:59.520 --> 22:01.300
 we'll talk about what kind of light,

22:01.300 --> 22:04.320
 the bright artificial lights in your home environment

22:04.320 --> 22:08.200
 are not, I repeat, are not going to be sufficiently bright

22:08.200 --> 22:11.180
 to turn on the cortisol mechanism

22:11.180 --> 22:12.700
 and the other wake-up mechanisms

22:12.700 --> 22:15.040
 that you need early in the day.

22:15.040 --> 22:16.640
 The diabolical twist, however,

22:16.640 --> 22:19.420
 is that those lights in your home or apartment

22:19.420 --> 22:22.440
 or even on your phone are bright enough

22:22.440 --> 22:25.460
 to disrupt your sleep if you look at them too late at night

22:25.460 --> 22:26.680
 or in the middle of the night.

22:26.680 --> 22:29.640
 So there's this asymmetry in our retinal,

22:29.640 --> 22:32.580
 our eye biology and in our brain's biology,

22:32.580 --> 22:34.600
 whereby early in the day, right around waking,

22:34.600 --> 22:37.040
 you need a lot of light, a lot of photons,

22:37.040 --> 22:39.400
 a lot of light energy and artificial lights

22:39.400 --> 22:41.400
 generally just won't accomplish

22:41.400 --> 22:42.920
 what you need them to accomplish.

22:42.920 --> 22:46.000
 But at night, even a little bit of artificial light

22:46.000 --> 22:48.460
 can really mess up your so-called circadian,

22:48.460 --> 22:50.800
 your 24 hour clocks and all these mechanisms

22:50.800 --> 22:51.880
 that we're talking about.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.720
 So if you wake up before the sun is out

22:53.720 --> 22:55.000
 and it's still dark,

22:55.000 --> 22:57.660
 please turn on as many bright artificial lights

22:57.660 --> 22:59.760
 as you possibly can or need,

22:59.760 --> 23:02.900
 but then get outside once the sun is out.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.440
 On cloudy days, you especially need to get outside.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.680
 I repeat, on cloudy days, overcast days,

23:08.680 --> 23:10.760
 you especially need to get outside and get sunlight.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.220
 You just need to get more of it.

23:12.220 --> 23:15.480
 Now, how much light and how much light viewing do you need?

23:15.480 --> 23:18.680
 This is going to vary depending on person and place,

23:18.680 --> 23:20.320
 literally where you live on earth,

23:20.320 --> 23:22.420
 whether or not there's a lot of tree cover,

23:22.420 --> 23:24.200
 whether or not you're somebody who has sensitive eyes

23:24.200 --> 23:25.460
 or less sensitive eyes.

23:25.460 --> 23:26.680
 It's really impossible for me

23:26.680 --> 23:28.520
 to give an absolute prescriptive,

23:28.520 --> 23:30.280
 but we can give some general guidelines.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.260
 In general, on a clear day,

23:32.260 --> 23:35.120
 meaning no cloud cover or minimal cloud cover,

23:35.120 --> 23:39.040
 you want to get this sunlight exposure to your eyes

23:39.040 --> 23:41.660
 for about five minutes or so.

23:41.660 --> 23:42.760
 Could be three minutes one day,

23:42.760 --> 23:46.320
 could be seven minutes the next day, about five minutes.

23:46.320 --> 23:48.640
 On a day where there's cloud cover,

23:48.640 --> 23:50.440
 so the sun is just peeking through the clouds

23:50.440 --> 23:52.720
 or it's more dense cloud cover,

23:52.720 --> 23:56.280
 you want to get about 10 minutes of sunlight exposure

23:56.280 --> 23:57.720
 to your eyes early in the day.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.140
 And on days that are really densely overcast,

24:00.140 --> 24:01.440
 or maybe even a rainy,

24:01.440 --> 24:04.600
 you're going to want to get as much as 20 or 30 minutes

24:04.600 --> 24:06.660
 of sunlight exposure.

24:06.660 --> 24:10.260
 Another key thing is do not forget about,

24:10.260 --> 24:13.020
 just don't try and get this sunlight exposure

24:13.020 --> 24:15.960
 through a windshield of a car or a window,

24:15.960 --> 24:17.420
 whether or not it's tinted or otherwise.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.000
 It takes far too long.

24:19.000 --> 24:22.080
 It's simply not going to trigger the relevant mechanisms.

24:22.080 --> 24:23.360
 You would be standing there all day

24:23.360 --> 24:25.160
 trying to get enough light into your eyes

24:25.160 --> 24:26.060
 from the morning sunlight.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.280
 And by then the sun will have already moved

24:28.280 --> 24:30.280
 from low solar angle to overhead,

24:30.280 --> 24:32.400
 and it simply won't work for all sorts of mechanisms

24:32.400 --> 24:34.520
 related to your circadian rhythm functions.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.600
 So just don't try and do it

24:35.600 --> 24:40.040
 through a windshield sunglasses or a window.

24:40.040 --> 24:40.980
 It's just not going to work.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.000
 Get outside.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.240
 If the weather is really bad, or for whatever reason,

24:44.240 --> 24:46.000
 safety reasons you cannot get outside,

24:46.000 --> 24:47.840
 well then I suppose try and get near a window.

24:47.840 --> 24:49.880
 That would be the last last resort,

24:49.880 --> 24:51.840
 but you really want to get outside

24:51.840 --> 24:53.740
 to get the sunlight exposure.

24:53.740 --> 24:55.840
 Now, if you live in a part of the world

24:55.840 --> 24:57.920
 where it's extremely dark and overcast,

24:57.920 --> 24:59.400
 or the weather won't let you outside,

24:59.400 --> 25:02.700
 or you live in a cave or some other small box

25:02.700 --> 25:05.080
 that does not allow any natural light into it

25:05.080 --> 25:06.380
 for whatever reason,

25:06.380 --> 25:08.080
 well then you're going to need

25:08.080 --> 25:10.680
 a replacement for that sunlight.

25:10.680 --> 25:14.040
 And there are sunlight simulators or daylight simulators

25:14.040 --> 25:15.080
 that you can purchase.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.960
 Those are quite expensive in general.

25:17.960 --> 25:21.040
 And therefore I suggest cheaper options

25:21.040 --> 25:24.060
 that work just as well because they get just as bright.

25:24.060 --> 25:26.600
 Things like ring lights that are sold

25:26.600 --> 25:30.360
 in order for people to take selfies and this kind of thing.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.320
 A drawing LED tablet will work pretty well.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.160
 I actually have one of those

25:34.160 --> 25:35.540
 and I put it on my desk all morning,

25:35.540 --> 25:37.360
 even though I still get outside

25:37.360 --> 25:39.580
 and look at sunlight first thing in the morning.

25:39.580 --> 25:43.600
 Again, also especially I should say on cloudy days.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.960
 We do not have any affiliation to any ring lights

25:46.960 --> 25:49.000
 or LED lights or these panels.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.680
 So we will provide a link to a couple of different options

25:51.680 --> 25:53.200
 if you want to explore the various options.

25:53.200 --> 25:54.760
 I don't know what people's different budgets are.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.400
 I don't know where people live.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.960
 I just know that many of our listeners

25:57.960 --> 25:59.240
 live in locations throughout the world

25:59.240 --> 26:00.480
 where for instance, during the winter,

26:00.480 --> 26:01.480
 it gets very, very dark

26:01.480 --> 26:03.280
 so they can't get sufficient sunlight.

26:03.280 --> 26:07.200
 But get that morning light, ideally from sunlight

26:07.200 --> 26:10.080
 and take into account all the specific points

26:10.080 --> 26:11.460
 that I've given you here.

26:11.460 --> 26:14.120
 And I should say, enjoy this practice.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.560
 It's really nice to get outside first thing in the morning

26:16.560 --> 26:17.400
 and get the sunlight.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.700
 In fact, when you start doing this,

26:19.700 --> 26:21.560
 you'll notice that your body

26:21.560 --> 26:24.080
 will start to feel more energized

26:24.080 --> 26:26.560
 and it will feel more energized more quickly.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.040
 You'll actually start to notice this mechanism

26:29.040 --> 26:30.080
 kicking in each day,

26:30.080 --> 26:32.640
 especially if you're paying attention to your physiology.

26:32.640 --> 26:34.960
 So enjoy this practice of getting outside.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.680
 Yes, you can take your morning beverage outside.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.560
 Yes, you can take your dog with you.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.560
 In fact, animals intuitively know

26:41.560 --> 26:42.760
 to get this morning sunlight.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.840
 They actually seek it out at the right times of days.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.360
 We human beings need to be told by podcasters

26:47.360 --> 26:48.900
 and other people about the science

26:48.900 --> 26:50.600
 that supports these kinds of practices.

26:50.600 --> 26:52.120
 Our pets apparently do not,

26:52.120 --> 26:54.960
 but get outside alone or with somebody,

26:54.960 --> 26:56.540
 with your kids, with your dog.

26:56.540 --> 26:58.080
 However you go about this practice,

26:58.080 --> 26:59.980
 make sure you do this practice

26:59.980 --> 27:03.140
 at least 80% of the days of your life.

27:03.140 --> 27:03.980
 That's right.

27:03.980 --> 27:06.240
 If you miss a day, for instance,

27:06.240 --> 27:08.080
 your bedridden for a day,

27:08.080 --> 27:10.100
 try and get next to a window.

27:10.100 --> 27:13.460
 Let's say you are traveling or for whatever reason,

27:13.460 --> 27:16.140
 you are not able to get outside first thing in the morning.

27:16.140 --> 27:18.820
 Well, then try to get twice as much sunlight in your eyes,

27:18.820 --> 27:21.180
 or I should say, extend the duration of sunlight viewing

27:21.180 --> 27:24.200
 in the morning for twice as long the following day.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.080
 This is a slow integrative mechanism

27:27.080 --> 27:29.140
 that underlies this whole thing of wakefulness

27:29.140 --> 27:31.680
 during the day and sleep at night due to sunlight viewing.

27:31.680 --> 27:33.900
 And if you miss a day, you can make up for it the next day,

27:33.900 --> 27:36.220
 but you have to get twice as much light

27:36.220 --> 27:39.440
 or twice as much duration of light.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.840
 If you really want to get technical

27:40.840 --> 27:41.840
 and you really want to measure

27:41.840 --> 27:43.200
 how much light is in your environment,

27:43.200 --> 27:46.520
 you can download a free app, something like Light Meter,

27:46.520 --> 27:48.960
 and that will allow your phone to act as a bit

27:48.960 --> 27:51.840
 of a light meter and give you a pretty accurate measurement

27:51.840 --> 27:54.600
 of how many lux, which is a measure of brightness,

27:54.600 --> 27:56.520
 are in your environment in the morning.

27:56.520 --> 27:59.160
 And in general, that's just going to be a good tool

27:59.160 --> 28:02.740
 for evaluating your environments.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.200
 Here's what I suggest you do.

28:04.200 --> 28:06.440
 Wake up in the morning, take Light Meter,

28:06.440 --> 28:08.320
 point it at the brightest light in your home

28:08.320 --> 28:09.200
 and take a measurement.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.400
 And what you'll probably find is it's about 1,000 lux.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.460
 Now go outside, and if there's some sunlight out

28:14.460 --> 28:16.920
 and there's cloud cover, point it at the sky

28:16.920 --> 28:17.760
 and press that button.

28:17.760 --> 28:18.660
 You can actually hold it down

28:18.660 --> 28:22.160
 and it'll give you a dynamically updated lux measurement.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.440
 And what you'll find is like 5,000, 10,000,

28:24.440 --> 28:26.440
 sometimes even 90,000 lux,

28:26.440 --> 28:28.620
 even though you don't experience it as so much brighter.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.520
 And that's because an indoor artificial light

28:30.520 --> 28:33.800
 is very concentrated over a small spatial area,

28:33.800 --> 28:35.660
 whereas the sunlight is very diffuse.

28:35.660 --> 28:37.680
 But it's that diffuse, very bright sunlight,

28:37.680 --> 28:39.360
 that photon energy that you really want

28:39.360 --> 28:41.480
 that's going to set all the rhythms of your brain and body

28:41.480 --> 28:44.880
 in the proper way, not just that cortisol peak,

28:44.880 --> 28:47.160
 but it's going to trigger proper metabolism.

28:47.160 --> 28:50.040
 It's going to set a timer for you to be able to fall asleep

28:50.040 --> 28:52.760
 about 16 hours later and on and on and on.

28:52.760 --> 28:54.800
 And I should mention within the on and on and on,

28:54.800 --> 28:57.640
 it's also going to suppress any melatonin,

28:57.640 --> 28:58.720
 a hormone that makes you sleepy

28:58.720 --> 29:00.920
 that happens to be swimming around in your bloodstream

29:00.920 --> 29:02.440
 at the time you wake up.

29:02.440 --> 29:03.940
 It does a number of other things too,

29:03.940 --> 29:06.000
 including interact with the adenosine system

29:06.000 --> 29:07.880
 and kind of wash out some of the adenosine

29:07.880 --> 29:11.560
 that might still be residual if you didn't sleep enough.

29:11.560 --> 29:15.200
 Fundamentally speaking, get that morning sunlight viewing.

29:15.200 --> 29:18.240
 I promise you will be grateful that you did.

29:18.240 --> 29:21.180
 It makes everybody feel better, feel more alert,

29:21.180 --> 29:23.560
 and it will greatly assist with your ability

29:23.560 --> 29:25.820
 to fall and stay asleep later that night.

29:25.820 --> 29:27.560
 Before we continue with today's discussion,

29:27.560 --> 29:29.160
 we're going to take a brief pause

29:29.160 --> 29:31.680
 to acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens,

29:31.680 --> 29:33.440
 also called AG1.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.740
 I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012,

29:36.740 --> 29:38.120
 so I'm delighted that they've been

29:38.120 --> 29:40.160
 a sponsor of this podcast.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.980
 Athletic Greens contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics,

29:42.980 --> 29:45.680
 digestive enzymes, and adaptogens.

29:45.680 --> 29:47.020
 So it's got a lot of things in there,

29:47.020 --> 29:48.680
 and that's actually the reason I started taking it

29:48.680 --> 29:51.320
 and the reason I still take it once or twice a day.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.440
 It essentially covers all of my nutritional bases

29:53.440 --> 29:55.700
 and the probiotics in particular are important to me

29:55.700 --> 29:57.020
 because of the critical importance

29:57.020 --> 29:58.620
 of what's called the gut brain axis,

29:58.620 --> 30:01.860
 that is neurons and other cell types in the gut,

30:01.860 --> 30:04.400
 in the digestive tract that communicate with the brain

30:04.400 --> 30:06.640
 and the brain back to the digestive tract

30:06.640 --> 30:10.040
 in order to control things like mood, immune function,

30:10.040 --> 30:12.020
 hormone function, and on and on.

30:12.020 --> 30:13.440
 Whenever somebody has asked me

30:13.440 --> 30:15.640
 what's the one supplement they should take,

30:15.640 --> 30:17.280
 I always answer Athletic Greens.

30:17.280 --> 30:19.640
 I gave that answer long before I ever had this podcast

30:19.640 --> 30:21.440
 and it's the answer I still give now

30:21.440 --> 30:24.220
 for all the reasons that I detailed just a moment ago.

30:24.220 --> 30:25.600
 If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,

30:25.600 --> 30:28.460
 you can go to athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

30:28.460 --> 30:29.560
 to claim a special offer.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.980
 They'll give you five free travel packs

30:30.980 --> 30:32.740
 that make it really easy to mix up Athletic Greens

30:32.740 --> 30:33.760
 while you're on the road,

30:33.760 --> 30:36.560
 plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2,

30:36.560 --> 30:38.760
 which are also very important for a huge number

30:38.760 --> 30:40.880
 of bodily factors and brain factors

30:40.880 --> 30:42.760
 that impact your immediate and long-term health.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.400
 Again, that's athleticgreens.com slash Huberman

30:45.400 --> 30:46.800
 to claim that special offer.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.160
 Okay, so now we're still focusing

30:48.160 --> 30:50.080
 on this early part of the day when you've woken up,

30:50.080 --> 30:53.120
 like the first hour or so after waking.

30:53.120 --> 30:56.900
 And we can go to our list of other levers and tools, right?

30:56.900 --> 30:58.240
 We have light and dark.

30:58.240 --> 31:01.560
 We already talked about light and sunlight in particular.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.920
 We've got temperature, food, exercise, caffeine,

31:03.920 --> 31:06.180
 supplements, and digital tools.

31:06.180 --> 31:09.480
 Now, once you've woken up and you want to be awake, okay?

31:09.480 --> 31:11.680
 So this is likely to be early in the day

31:11.680 --> 31:14.240
 if you're following a more standard schedule.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.440
 You will also want to leverage not just light,

31:17.440 --> 31:20.880
 but temperature as a tool.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.660
 If you are inclined, it would be wise

31:24.660 --> 31:27.520
 to try and increase your core body temperature

31:27.520 --> 31:30.480
 a bit more quickly than it would otherwise

31:30.480 --> 31:32.880
 if you were to just shuffle around outside,

31:32.880 --> 31:35.000
 get your sunlight, maybe read a little bit, et cetera.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.720
 And there are two main ways you can do that.

31:36.720 --> 31:40.920
 The first way is to get into cold water of some sort.

31:40.920 --> 31:42.080
 So this could be a cold shower

31:42.080 --> 31:44.640
 of anywhere from one to three minutes.

31:44.640 --> 31:45.920
 This could be an ice bath.

31:45.920 --> 31:48.240
 If that's your thing, it could be a cold tub,

31:48.240 --> 31:51.720
 or if you own a cold tub that's specifically designed

31:51.720 --> 31:55.360
 for deliberate cold exposure, get under some cold water.

31:55.360 --> 31:57.640
 That will certainly wake you up.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.480
 And if you've ever jumped into cold water

31:59.480 --> 32:01.720
 or had a cold shower, you know it really wakes you up

32:01.720 --> 32:04.940
 because you release adrenaline epinephrine

32:04.940 --> 32:07.440
 from both your brain and body.

32:07.440 --> 32:09.000
 The body from your adrenals and your brain

32:09.000 --> 32:11.360
 from a little cluster of neurons called locus coeruleus.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.880
 Again, the names don't matter.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.620
 One to three minutes of cold water exposure

32:14.620 --> 32:16.920
 will wake you up because of that adrenaline release.

32:16.920 --> 32:19.700
 And, and I want to highlight the and,

32:19.700 --> 32:23.500
 it will serve to increase your core body temperature.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.640
 That's right.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.360
 Your body and brain interact as a bit

32:26.360 --> 32:28.840
 of a thermostat system where if you put something cold

32:28.840 --> 32:30.520
 on the surface of your body, your brain,

32:30.520 --> 32:32.320
 a little cluster of neurons in the so-called

32:32.320 --> 32:35.680
 medial preoptic area, act as a thermostat and say,

32:35.680 --> 32:38.640
 ah, the external of my body is cold,

32:38.640 --> 32:41.480
 and therefore I'm going to heat up my core body temperature.

32:41.480 --> 32:42.720
 So this is a little bit paradoxical.

32:42.720 --> 32:44.380
 People think, oh, if you get into cold water

32:44.380 --> 32:46.520
 or an ice bath, your body temperature is going to drop.

32:46.520 --> 32:48.400
 And indeed that's true if you stay in for a while,

32:48.400 --> 32:50.320
 but if you just get in for about one to three minutes

32:50.320 --> 32:52.480
 or under the cold shower for one to three minutes,

32:52.480 --> 32:55.120
 your core body temperature will increase.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.400
 So then when you get out of that cold water,

32:57.400 --> 33:00.080
 your body temperature is increasing at a rate,

33:00.080 --> 33:03.200
 at a slope that's steeper than it would otherwise,

33:03.200 --> 33:04.360
 and you're going to feel more alert.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.880
 It also has the advantage of increasing,

33:05.880 --> 33:07.880
 not just adrenaline, but dopamine,

33:07.880 --> 33:10.360
 which is a molecule involved in motivation, focus, et cetera.

33:10.360 --> 33:12.160
 So this is great for waking up.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.280
 So we've got sunlight,

33:13.280 --> 33:15.400
 we've got temperature triggered by cold water,

33:15.400 --> 33:17.760
 and we have exercise.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.940
 One of the best ways to increase your core body temperature

33:20.940 --> 33:23.040
 early in the day is to do exercise.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.400
 Now, some of you might choose to do your full-blown workout

33:26.400 --> 33:29.240
 for the day first thing when you wake up in the morning.

33:29.240 --> 33:30.920
 I always say the best time to exercise,

33:30.920 --> 33:32.680
 at least what the research points to,

33:32.680 --> 33:35.140
 is immediately when you wake up in the morning

33:35.140 --> 33:38.900
 or three hours after waking or 11 hours after waking,

33:38.900 --> 33:41.600
 but that's really getting down into optimization

33:41.600 --> 33:43.840
 for sake of muscular strength and grip strength,

33:43.840 --> 33:47.360
 and it's very hard to give a strict prescriptive.

33:47.360 --> 33:48.400
 Here's what I suggest.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.440
 If you want to be alert early in the day

33:50.440 --> 33:52.700
 and you want to sleep great at night,

33:52.700 --> 33:55.520
 get that bright sunlight, get into some cold water,

33:55.520 --> 33:57.800
 and if you don't want to get into some cold water,

33:57.800 --> 33:59.200
 try and get some movement.

33:59.200 --> 34:01.640
 It could be a walk, so you can get your sunlight exposure

34:01.640 --> 34:04.260
 while you're taking a walk first thing in the morning.

34:04.260 --> 34:07.020
 It could be a light jog, it could be skipping rope.

34:07.020 --> 34:09.520
 These days, I skip rope for about 10 minutes or 20 minutes

34:09.520 --> 34:10.760
 while looking at the sun,

34:10.760 --> 34:12.460
 so I'm trying to layer in these different things

34:12.460 --> 34:14.920
 for waking up, and then I take a cold shower afterwards,

34:14.920 --> 34:16.080
 that's what I've been doing as of lately,

34:16.080 --> 34:19.160
 but I don't do that all year long necessarily.

34:19.160 --> 34:22.240
 Or some of you are going to be working out mid-morning,

34:22.240 --> 34:23.740
 I sometimes do that,

34:23.740 --> 34:26.980
 but try and get your core body temperature increased

34:26.980 --> 34:28.160
 first thing in the morning.

34:28.160 --> 34:31.120
 And a great way to do that is with the cold water

34:31.120 --> 34:33.340
 and or with exercise.

34:33.340 --> 34:35.720
 And again, it doesn't have to be your full-blown workout

34:35.720 --> 34:37.920
 for the day if you're doing workouts consistently,

34:37.920 --> 34:38.980
 which I hope everybody is

34:38.980 --> 34:41.160
 because everybody really should exercise

34:41.160 --> 34:43.480
 at least, I believe, five or six

34:43.480 --> 34:44.580
 or maybe even seven days a week.

34:44.580 --> 34:46.580
 For me, it's six days a week, sometimes five,

34:46.580 --> 34:48.120
 rarely is it seven.

34:48.120 --> 34:50.980
 So get that exercise or even just a modest amount

34:50.980 --> 34:53.740
 of movement, walking, jogging, skipping rope,

34:53.740 --> 34:55.340
 some light calisthenics,

34:55.340 --> 34:57.320
 that will further increase your core body temperature

34:57.320 --> 34:58.880
 and help you feel more awake.

34:58.880 --> 35:00.600
 Then we have the category of caffeine.

35:00.600 --> 35:01.760
 And again, we're just talking about this

35:01.760 --> 35:02.700
 early part of the day.

35:02.700 --> 35:04.040
 And you might be saying, wait a second,

35:04.040 --> 35:06.400
 I thought this was an episode about tools for sleep.

35:06.400 --> 35:07.960
 Well, everything that we're talking about doing

35:07.960 --> 35:11.280
 in these first 60 to 90 minutes of the day

35:11.280 --> 35:15.620
 really set in motion a wave of biological cascades

35:15.620 --> 35:17.460
 that carry through the entire day

35:17.460 --> 35:18.760
 and into the evening and into the night

35:18.760 --> 35:20.820
 and really do serve to optimize sleep.

35:20.820 --> 35:22.620
 So just hang in there with me.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.260
 And for those of you that are interested in focus

35:24.260 --> 35:25.860
 and attention, your ability to learn,

35:25.860 --> 35:27.440
 all of these tools and practices

35:27.440 --> 35:30.660
 are going to greatly enhance those as well.

35:30.660 --> 35:33.580
 So the next category of tool for use early in the day

35:33.580 --> 35:34.420
 is caffeine.

35:34.420 --> 35:37.200
 Caffeine is a very important compound to think about.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.940
 I do realize that some people who are prone to anxiety,

35:39.940 --> 35:41.720
 especially panic attacks, anxiety attacks,

35:41.720 --> 35:43.280
 might avoid caffeine entirely.

35:44.140 --> 35:45.100
 That's absolutely fine.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.780
 You do not have to drink caffeine.

35:46.780 --> 35:50.220
 So what I'm about to describe are ways to leverage caffeine

35:50.220 --> 35:52.920
 use to optimize sleep and wakefulness.

35:52.920 --> 35:56.260
 If you are comfortable with caffeine, if you like caffeine,

35:56.260 --> 35:57.360
 I happen to love caffeine.

35:57.360 --> 36:00.020
 I like it in the form of coffee or espresso

36:00.020 --> 36:01.540
 or yerba mate tea.

36:01.540 --> 36:04.820
 In particular, non-smoked varieties of yerba mate tea

36:04.820 --> 36:06.340
 is non-smoked because the smoked varieties

36:06.340 --> 36:09.680
 seem to carry some carcinogenic, some cancer causing risk.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.000
 There's increasing data on that.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.640
 So non-smoked varieties of yerba mate.

36:14.640 --> 36:16.920
 So caffeine is something that a lot of people consume

36:16.920 --> 36:18.500
 early in the day.

36:18.500 --> 36:20.780
 How much depends on your tolerance.

36:20.780 --> 36:22.900
 And there's a lot of individual variability here.

36:22.900 --> 36:25.360
 Again, caffeine is adenosine antagonist

36:25.360 --> 36:27.740
 or effectively works as a adenosine antagonist

36:27.740 --> 36:28.900
 and limits sleepiness.

36:28.900 --> 36:31.720
 I highly recommend that everybody delay their caffeine

36:31.720 --> 36:34.740
 intake for 90 to 120 minutes after waking,

36:34.740 --> 36:37.060
 however painful it may be to eventually arrive

36:37.060 --> 36:39.900
 at that 90 to 120 minutes after waking.

36:39.900 --> 36:43.060
 You want, and I encourage you to clear out

36:43.060 --> 36:46.060
 whatever residual adenosine is circulating in your system

36:46.060 --> 36:48.260
 in that first 90 to 120 minutes of the day,

36:48.260 --> 36:50.900
 get that sunlight exposure, get some movement to wake up

36:50.900 --> 36:55.200
 and then, and only then start to ingest caffeine

36:55.200 --> 36:58.420
 because what you'll do if you delay caffeine intake

36:58.420 --> 37:01.060
 until 90 to 120 minutes after waking

37:01.060 --> 37:04.520
 is you will avoid this so-called afternoon crash.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.820
 And you may still get a little bit of dip in energy

37:06.820 --> 37:08.220
 in the afternoon, but it's not going to be

37:08.220 --> 37:09.540
 that massive crash.

37:09.540 --> 37:11.940
 I've talked about the reasons for that crash

37:11.940 --> 37:15.340
 on previous episodes, but if you delay your caffeine intake

37:15.340 --> 37:17.020
 90 to 120 minutes after waking,

37:17.020 --> 37:18.420
 you are doing yourself a great service

37:18.420 --> 37:21.340
 towards wakefulness and to avoid the crash.

37:21.340 --> 37:23.500
 And the afternoon crash has another liability to it,

37:23.500 --> 37:24.820
 which is typically people will emerge

37:24.820 --> 37:27.540
 from that afternoon crash, either grumpy or groggy,

37:27.540 --> 37:30.420
 and then they'll lean into drinking more caffeine,

37:30.420 --> 37:32.740
 which can then disrupt their sleep.

37:32.740 --> 37:35.580
 So wait 90 to 120 minutes after waking in the morning

37:35.580 --> 37:36.840
 to drink caffeine.

37:36.840 --> 37:41.120
 And if you drink caffeine at any point throughout the day,

37:41.120 --> 37:43.220
 really try and avoid any caffeine,

37:43.220 --> 37:46.220
 certainly avoid drinking more than 100 milligrams

37:46.220 --> 37:48.660
 of caffeine after 4 p.m.

37:48.660 --> 37:51.460
 And probably even better to limit your last caffeine intake

37:51.460 --> 37:53.620
 to 3 p.m. or even 2 p.m.

37:53.620 --> 37:56.380
 And for many people, shifting that caffeine intake

37:56.380 --> 37:58.560
 from immediately after waking in the morning

37:58.560 --> 38:01.780
 to 90 to 120 minutes gives them a much longer arc

38:01.780 --> 38:02.860
 of energy throughout the day,

38:02.860 --> 38:06.180
 and they don't feel the need to drink more caffeine

38:06.180 --> 38:07.580
 later in the afternoon.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.860
 If you do drink caffeine later in the afternoon,

38:09.860 --> 38:12.700
 really try and limit the total amount or drink decaf.

38:12.700 --> 38:14.880
 Certainly keep the total amount

38:14.880 --> 38:17.100
 to less than 100 milligrams if you are interested

38:17.100 --> 38:18.820
 in getting into the best possible sleep.

38:18.820 --> 38:20.660
 And I say this knowing that many people,

38:20.660 --> 38:23.480
 including myself, can drink a double espresso

38:23.480 --> 38:26.380
 with 200 milligrams of caffeine or more at 5 p.m.

38:26.380 --> 38:29.820
 or even 6 p.m. or after dinner and still quote unquote,

38:29.820 --> 38:31.900
 fall asleep fine or still sleep fine.

38:31.900 --> 38:34.540
 However, there are terrific data,

38:34.540 --> 38:36.660
 Matt Walker and I talked about this,

38:36.660 --> 38:38.860
 and there are more and more papers all the time

38:38.860 --> 38:42.920
 that point to the fact that caffeine intake late in the day

38:42.920 --> 38:45.520
 after 4 p.m. that is can really disrupt

38:45.520 --> 38:46.640
 the architecture of your sleep.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.060
 So you might think you're sleeping well,

38:48.060 --> 38:49.940
 but you're not sleeping nearly as well as you could

38:49.940 --> 38:53.020
 if you avoided caffeine in those afternoon hours.

38:53.020 --> 38:56.020
 Now, some of you might be doing your main bout of exercise

38:56.020 --> 38:56.980
 first thing in the morning,

38:56.980 --> 38:59.720
 and you want your caffeine before that bout of exercise.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.200
 In that case, I say, go for it.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.800
 Drink your caffeine, do your workout right after waking up.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.660
 I don't have a problem with that.

39:06.660 --> 39:07.660
 You will find however,

39:07.660 --> 39:10.380
 that you're going to get an early afternoon dip in energy

39:10.380 --> 39:12.860
 and that dip in energy is going to be substantial

39:12.860 --> 39:14.900
 because it's going to be a dip in energy

39:14.900 --> 39:18.860
 that naturally follows that workout from the morning.

39:18.860 --> 39:21.280
 So it's dependent on temperature,

39:21.280 --> 39:24.940
 and it's going to be related to the elimination

39:24.940 --> 39:27.780
 of that adenosine blockade by caffeine.

39:27.780 --> 39:30.900
 So you're getting a kind of a one, two punch

39:30.900 --> 39:33.580
 on your energy levels by taking a lot of caffeine

39:33.580 --> 39:36.620
 and exercising early in the day.

39:36.620 --> 39:38.900
 You can sort of expect that you're going to get

39:38.900 --> 39:41.160
 a drop in energy in the early afternoon.

39:41.160 --> 39:42.920
 That's okay if that works for you,

39:42.920 --> 39:45.100
 but just know that delaying that caffeine

39:45.100 --> 39:49.180
 90 to 120 minutes after waking would be the ideal scenario

39:49.180 --> 39:51.740
 most days and most scenarios.

39:52.980 --> 39:55.660
 All that said, I absolutely respect the fact

39:55.660 --> 39:57.980
 that people have different work schedules,

39:57.980 --> 40:00.000
 kids schedules, et cetera.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.760
 So if you want to do some or none or all these tools,

40:02.760 --> 40:03.600
 that's really up to you.

40:03.600 --> 40:07.160
 I'm just providing them to you in the simplest form

40:07.160 --> 40:08.580
 that I can possibly provide them.

40:08.580 --> 40:11.700
 Now, the other lever or tool that you have available to you

40:11.700 --> 40:14.620
 is food, not just what you eat, but when you eat.

40:14.620 --> 40:17.700
 And it turns out that if you eat early in the day,

40:17.700 --> 40:21.140
 you support a biological clock mechanism

40:21.140 --> 40:24.220
 that will make you more alert early in the day.

40:24.220 --> 40:26.180
 That said, many people choose to fast

40:26.180 --> 40:27.860
 in the early morning hours of the day

40:27.860 --> 40:29.020
 or in the first part of the day.

40:29.020 --> 40:29.900
 I'm one such person.

40:29.900 --> 40:32.640
 I generally don't ingest any food

40:32.640 --> 40:35.200
 until about 11 AM or 12 noon.

40:35.200 --> 40:36.740
 Sometimes I'll have a protein shake.

40:36.740 --> 40:38.100
 Sometimes I'll have some almonds.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.260
 Sometimes I'll have breakfast.

40:39.260 --> 40:40.860
 If people are meeting for brunch or breakfast,

40:40.860 --> 40:43.200
 I will have breakfast for social reasons.

40:43.200 --> 40:44.620
 Every once in a while, but most of the time,

40:44.620 --> 40:47.540
 I don't eat until about lunchtime.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.040
 However, some people are really hungry

40:49.040 --> 40:50.160
 when they wake up in the morning.

40:50.160 --> 40:53.160
 Just know that if you eat early in the day,

40:53.160 --> 40:56.620
 you are further triggering an increase in metabolism

40:56.620 --> 40:59.980
 and in temperature that will make you more alert.

40:59.980 --> 41:02.140
 So you don't have to eat early in the day,

41:02.140 --> 41:04.180
 but you can start to see how these different tools

41:04.180 --> 41:07.820
 layer together, sunlight viewing, exercise, cold water,

41:07.820 --> 41:10.860
 eating, many of them are converging on the same mechanisms.

41:10.860 --> 41:11.940
 In fact, when you drink caffeine,

41:11.940 --> 41:14.120
 there's also a small increase in body temperature

41:14.120 --> 41:16.540
 due to the adrenaline increase that it stimulates.

41:16.540 --> 41:19.500
 So all of these things can be layered on top of one another,

41:19.500 --> 41:20.960
 or you can use them individually

41:20.960 --> 41:22.340
 or think about them individually.

41:22.340 --> 41:25.260
 Now, food is an interesting lever or tool

41:25.260 --> 41:26.760
 because it's not just about when you eat,

41:26.760 --> 41:28.740
 but it's also about what you eat.

41:28.740 --> 41:31.620
 And I've talked a lot about eating for energy

41:31.620 --> 41:33.580
 and what that means in terms of caloric energy

41:33.580 --> 41:35.480
 versus neural energy, et cetera,

41:35.480 --> 41:37.100
 in previous podcast episodes.

41:37.100 --> 41:38.340
 We're not going to focus on that now,

41:38.340 --> 41:40.380
 because frankly, to get into a description

41:40.380 --> 41:42.460
 of whether or not somebody should eat fruits or vegetables

41:42.460 --> 41:45.260
 or animal proteins or dairy, et cetera, early in the day,

41:45.260 --> 41:46.340
 that's very nuanced.

41:46.340 --> 41:47.660
 What you eat for your breakfast

41:47.660 --> 41:50.300
 or if you choose to not eat breakfast is really up to you.

41:50.300 --> 41:53.540
 All that said, if you eat a very large meal,

41:53.540 --> 41:56.780
 it doesn't matter if you slept terrifically well

41:56.780 --> 41:58.260
 10 hours the night before,

41:58.260 --> 42:00.140
 or if you are about to go to sleep,

42:00.140 --> 42:02.020
 or if it's the middle of the afternoon,

42:02.020 --> 42:04.100
 if your gut is full of food,

42:04.100 --> 42:06.140
 there's just a large volume of food in your gut,

42:06.140 --> 42:09.060
 it's going to divert a lot of blood

42:09.060 --> 42:11.440
 and other critical resources

42:11.440 --> 42:13.100
 away from other organs of your body,

42:13.100 --> 42:14.560
 in particular, your brain,

42:14.560 --> 42:16.900
 and you're going to be sleepy after eating a big meal.

42:16.900 --> 42:18.260
 So this is sort of a duh,

42:18.260 --> 42:20.740
 but I think oftentimes in the discussions

42:20.740 --> 42:22.460
 about what to eat for energy,

42:22.460 --> 42:26.580
 people neglect to consider food volume as a strong parameter

42:26.580 --> 42:28.360
 or variable in that discussion.

42:28.360 --> 42:29.700
 So if you eat a huge breakfast,

42:29.700 --> 42:31.820
 it's likely that you are going to be tired

42:31.820 --> 42:33.460
 immediately after eating that breakfast,

42:33.460 --> 42:35.700
 unless of course you exercise very hard prior to that

42:35.700 --> 42:38.620
 and you're metabolize all that food very quickly.

42:38.620 --> 42:40.480
 So it's up to you whether or not to eat

42:40.480 --> 42:42.300
 first thing in the morning or not,

42:42.300 --> 42:45.380
 but if you do eat in the first few hours of the morning,

42:45.380 --> 42:47.240
 just understand that you are setting

42:47.240 --> 42:50.260
 or you're helping to set a food entrained

42:50.260 --> 42:52.620
 as it's called circadian clock,

42:52.620 --> 42:56.620
 light, temperature, timing of food intake,

42:56.620 --> 42:58.140
 movement and exercise,

42:58.140 --> 43:01.420
 all of these things literally funnel in,

43:01.420 --> 43:02.420
 in a neural sense,

43:02.420 --> 43:05.560
 they funnel into this thing that we call the circadian clock

43:05.560 --> 43:09.080
 and they let that clock, that set of neurons predict

43:09.080 --> 43:11.680
 when you are likely to be eating and active

43:11.680 --> 43:14.200
 and viewing sunlight the next day

43:14.200 --> 43:15.440
 and the next day and the next day.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.120
 I say all this because there are some beautiful studies

43:18.120 --> 43:20.460
 and I'll highlight one again in the show note captions

43:20.460 --> 43:22.760
 that show that if people are having a hard time

43:22.760 --> 43:24.180
 waking up in the morning,

43:24.180 --> 43:27.840
 one of the things they can do is maximize sunlight viewing,

43:27.840 --> 43:30.140
 exercise in the morning, drink caffeine,

43:30.140 --> 43:32.720
 although again, I support the idea

43:32.720 --> 43:35.780
 that that would best be done about 90 to 120 minutes

43:35.780 --> 43:39.020
 after waking, eating some food

43:39.020 --> 43:41.300
 in those early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera.

43:41.300 --> 43:45.020
 You can layer in multiple levers or tools

43:45.020 --> 43:46.680
 in order to be more alert.

43:46.680 --> 43:50.580
 And that's what these levers and tools are really there for

43:50.580 --> 43:52.680
 in this sense of what we're talking about today,

43:52.680 --> 43:54.300
 which is optimizing sleep.

43:54.300 --> 43:55.660
 Yes, they will make you more alert.

43:55.660 --> 43:57.980
 Yes, they will provide some adrenaline and dopamine,

43:57.980 --> 44:00.380
 for instance, the cold water, et cetera, et cetera.

44:00.380 --> 44:02.700
 But the reason we're talking about these things

44:02.700 --> 44:06.620
 in the context of sleep is that they start to give your body

44:06.620 --> 44:09.620
 some predictable autonomic timing.

44:09.620 --> 44:11.620
 What is predictable autonomic timing?

44:11.620 --> 44:12.860
 Well, your autonomic nervous system

44:12.860 --> 44:15.220
 is the components of your brain and body

44:15.220 --> 44:18.180
 that cause wakefulness and sleepiness.

44:18.180 --> 44:21.180
 And you can start to create some predictability

44:21.180 --> 44:22.620
 in that autonomic timing.

44:22.620 --> 44:24.980
 You can start to do things that really make it such

44:24.980 --> 44:28.200
 that you naturally wake up at six in the morning

44:28.200 --> 44:29.120
 or five in the morning.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.280
 That's right, if you're somebody who naturally

44:31.280 --> 44:34.940
 is a night owl who likes to stay up until two in the morning

44:34.940 --> 44:37.720
 and sleep until 10 a.m. and you now have a job

44:37.720 --> 44:39.300
 or you have to go to school or you have a partner

44:39.300 --> 44:41.700
 that likes to get up early and go to sleep early,

44:41.700 --> 44:43.100
 well, you can make that happen

44:43.100 --> 44:45.320
 and you can make that happen pretty painlessly

44:45.320 --> 44:49.260
 if you take a week or so and go to sleep 30 minutes

44:49.260 --> 44:53.140
 or an hour earlier each night, set an alarm and wake up

44:53.140 --> 44:56.080
 30 minutes or an hour earlier each morning

44:56.080 --> 44:57.140
 until of course you're waking up

44:57.140 --> 44:58.140
 at the time you want to wake up.

44:58.140 --> 45:02.180
 And then even in that groggy state, get some exercise,

45:02.180 --> 45:03.320
 get some sunlight viewing.

45:03.320 --> 45:04.220
 If the sun's not out,

45:04.220 --> 45:06.140
 turn on those bright artificial lights,

45:06.140 --> 45:08.220
 have some breakfast, even if you're not hungry.

45:08.220 --> 45:11.140
 In fact, for those of you that engage in shift work

45:11.140 --> 45:14.020
 because you have to or travel and you're jet lagged,

45:14.020 --> 45:17.200
 one of the quickest ways to shift your circadian clock

45:17.200 --> 45:18.500
 and get onto the local schedule

45:18.500 --> 45:20.620
 is to eat on the local schedule.

45:20.620 --> 45:24.700
 So what all these tools do is they really set up a cascade.

45:24.700 --> 45:26.940
 Think of it as kind of a wave front of wakefulness

45:26.940 --> 45:28.300
 and focus throughout the day.

45:28.300 --> 45:29.660
 It'll take you through the middle of the day

45:29.660 --> 45:32.460
 and the afternoon stages we'll talk about in a few minutes,

45:32.460 --> 45:35.160
 but really they take you to this period

45:35.160 --> 45:38.660
 that is about 5 p.m. until your bedtime.

45:38.660 --> 45:40.500
 I realize some people are going to bed very early,

45:40.500 --> 45:43.460
 like 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., which to me seems very early,

45:43.460 --> 45:45.860
 but very few people go to sleep at 5 p.m., right?

45:45.860 --> 45:48.500
 Unless you're doing that for shift work or other reasons.

45:48.500 --> 45:52.660
 But from 5 p.m. until bedtime is really a critical period

45:52.660 --> 45:55.000
 in which you need to leverage particular tools

45:55.000 --> 45:58.260
 in order to get and stay asleep optimally

45:58.260 --> 45:59.860
 and to be able to sleep through the night.

45:59.860 --> 46:01.700
 So really there are three critical periods

46:01.700 --> 46:03.460
 throughout each 24-hour cycle.

46:03.460 --> 46:05.220
 And during each of those critical periods,

46:05.220 --> 46:08.580
 you're going to want to do as many specific things

46:08.580 --> 46:11.200
 as you can to optimize your wakefulness and focus

46:11.200 --> 46:15.100
 and mood throughout the day and your sleep at night.

46:15.100 --> 46:16.260
 The first critical period is the one

46:16.260 --> 46:17.860
 that we've been talking about up until now.

46:17.860 --> 46:19.900
 Things like morning sunlight, viewing caffeine,

46:19.900 --> 46:22.920
 90 to 120 minutes after waking, exercise, and so on.

46:22.920 --> 46:24.580
 We can call that critical period one.

46:24.580 --> 46:27.640
 And it really encompasses the time from which you wake up

46:27.640 --> 46:30.160
 until about three hours after waking.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.420
 Although I should just mention,

46:31.420 --> 46:32.360
 because there are always those people that say,

46:32.360 --> 46:33.780
 wait, I wake up at 4 a.m.

46:33.780 --> 46:35.740
 and the sun isn't out until 8 a.m.

46:35.740 --> 46:37.180
 Okay, so it might be four hours,

46:37.180 --> 46:40.060
 but really it's those early morning hours

46:40.060 --> 46:42.420
 of your day once you're awake.

46:42.420 --> 46:46.060
 The second critical period is the time throughout the day

46:46.060 --> 46:48.380
 and afternoon leading into evening.

46:48.380 --> 46:49.560
 So you may ask, what are the things

46:49.560 --> 46:50.980
 that you can do throughout the day,

46:50.980 --> 46:52.700
 the middle of your day and into the afternoon

46:52.700 --> 46:54.620
 and evening hours that are really going to set you up

46:54.620 --> 46:57.220
 for the best possible sleep later that night?

46:57.220 --> 47:00.340
 Well, there are a few dos and there are a few don'ts.

47:00.340 --> 47:03.700
 First of all, be careful about ingesting too much caffeine

47:03.700 --> 47:04.660
 throughout the middle of the day.

47:04.660 --> 47:06.260
 That's kind of an obvious one for the reasons

47:06.260 --> 47:08.060
 that we talked about earlier.

47:08.060 --> 47:10.940
 Second of all, if you are a napper,

47:10.940 --> 47:12.820
 and I raise my hand now, for those of you listening,

47:12.820 --> 47:15.180
 I'm raising my right hand because I love naps.

47:15.180 --> 47:16.460
 I've always loved naps.

47:16.460 --> 47:20.720
 Nowadays I do NSDR or a reverie sleep hypnosis

47:20.720 --> 47:22.260
 almost every day.

47:22.260 --> 47:23.900
 And I tend to do that, as I mentioned,

47:23.900 --> 47:26.900
 in the early afternoon hours if I'm feeling kind of sleepy,

47:26.900 --> 47:29.400
 because even though I optimize my caffeine intake, timing,

47:29.400 --> 47:32.300
 et cetera, I tend to get a little sleepy in the afternoon.

47:32.300 --> 47:34.140
 Most people get a little sleepy in the afternoon.

47:34.140 --> 47:35.580
 Some of that is related to hitting

47:35.580 --> 47:37.080
 that peak of body temperature.

47:37.080 --> 47:37.920
 And you might think, wait,

47:37.920 --> 47:39.660
 I thought high body temperature

47:39.660 --> 47:41.420
 is associated with alertness.

47:41.420 --> 47:44.540
 And it is, but right as you crest that high body temperature

47:44.540 --> 47:46.220
 and your body temperature starts to drop,

47:46.220 --> 47:47.960
 there's a tendency to be a little bit sleepy.

47:47.960 --> 47:51.100
 So some of you might opt to take a nap in the afternoon.

47:51.100 --> 47:52.940
 Should you nap, should you not nap?

47:52.940 --> 47:54.500
 That's a question that I get asked a lot

47:54.500 --> 47:56.060
 and that I asked Dr. Matthew Walker

47:56.060 --> 47:57.660
 when he was a guest on this podcast.

47:57.660 --> 48:00.500
 Here was his answer and here's what the data support.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.100
 It is fine to nap in the afternoon,

48:03.100 --> 48:06.560
 but don't nap so late in the day or for so long

48:06.560 --> 48:08.900
 that it disrupts your ability to fall

48:08.900 --> 48:11.700
 and stay asleep at night for your major sleep bout.

48:11.700 --> 48:13.260
 Okay, so naps are fine,

48:13.260 --> 48:15.360
 but don't sleep so long during the day

48:15.360 --> 48:18.120
 or too late in the day that it disrupts your ability

48:18.120 --> 48:20.060
 to fall and stay asleep.

48:20.060 --> 48:23.340
 I should also say you do not have to nap.

48:23.340 --> 48:25.340
 It's kind of an interesting phenomenon that happens

48:25.340 --> 48:26.900
 on these podcasts and on social media

48:26.900 --> 48:28.020
 where we'll talk about naps

48:28.020 --> 48:29.300
 and the fact that naps are great

48:29.300 --> 48:31.940
 and don't make them longer than 90 minutes,

48:31.940 --> 48:34.420
 but then all the non-nappers get really worried like,

48:34.420 --> 48:35.500
 wait, am I supposed to nap?

48:35.500 --> 48:37.180
 I don't like naps, I wake up groggy.

48:37.180 --> 48:38.500
 You do not have to nap.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.260
 In fact, if you can make it through your whole day

48:40.260 --> 48:42.180
 without napping, great, more power to you.

48:42.180 --> 48:45.760
 But if you do nap and you find that naps serve you well,

48:45.760 --> 48:47.540
 keep those naps shorter than 90 minutes

48:47.540 --> 48:50.400
 for reasons related to ultradian cycles and so forth.

48:50.400 --> 48:53.460
 And make sure that you don't nap too late in the day

48:53.460 --> 48:55.260
 that you are then staying up too late at night

48:55.260 --> 48:57.660
 and having a hard time waking up the next morning.

48:57.660 --> 49:00.780
 I will say that for a lot of people who do not like naps

49:00.780 --> 49:04.060
 or that find they wake up really grumpy from naps

49:04.060 --> 49:06.020
 or groggy from naps,

49:06.020 --> 49:09.640
 I encourage you to try the Reverie app,

49:09.640 --> 49:12.900
 try an NSDR script, try yoga nidra,

49:12.900 --> 49:14.140
 try something of that sort

49:14.140 --> 49:16.980
 for anywhere from 10 to 20 to 30 minutes.

49:16.980 --> 49:19.060
 I tend to do this every day.

49:19.060 --> 49:21.460
 Now I'll just lie down and I love yoga nidra,

49:21.460 --> 49:24.300
 I love NSDR scripts, I love using the Reverie app.

49:24.300 --> 49:26.980
 In particular, the portion of the Reverie app

49:26.980 --> 49:28.580
 that gets you better at sleeping,

49:28.580 --> 49:30.900
 it really is beneficial for me

49:30.900 --> 49:33.680
 because it serves as very replenishing

49:33.680 --> 49:35.140
 while I'm doing that hypnosis,

49:35.140 --> 49:37.140
 but it's also gotten me much better at falling

49:37.140 --> 49:38.780
 and staying asleep and falling back asleep

49:38.780 --> 49:40.060
 in the middle of the night.

49:40.060 --> 49:42.220
 So this critical period throughout the day

49:42.220 --> 49:44.060
 is one in which most people are doing a lot of stuff.

49:44.060 --> 49:46.600
 They're emailing and picking up kids and they're exercising

49:46.600 --> 49:48.740
 and they're commuting and doing all sorts of things,

49:48.740 --> 49:50.720
 taking phone calls and zooms, et cetera.

49:50.720 --> 49:53.340
 But if you can get that period of deep relaxation

49:53.340 --> 49:56.660
 through a nap or NSDR, that's going to serve you well.

49:56.660 --> 49:58.220
 Try not to drink too much caffeine,

49:58.220 --> 50:01.340
 certainly no more than 100 milligrams of caffeine

50:01.340 --> 50:03.460
 after 4 p.m. if your goal is to fall asleep

50:03.460 --> 50:05.320
 at a reasonably normal time.

50:05.320 --> 50:08.800
 And for those of you that exercise in the afternoon,

50:08.800 --> 50:12.180
 understand that if you exercise very intensely,

50:12.180 --> 50:13.720
 so this might be weight training or running

50:13.720 --> 50:15.860
 or some other very intense exercise,

50:15.860 --> 50:17.940
 typically that's going to further increase

50:17.940 --> 50:19.360
 your body temperature.

50:19.360 --> 50:20.200
 Makes sense, right?

50:20.200 --> 50:21.700
 Based on everything we know about metabolism

50:21.700 --> 50:22.540
 and body temperature.

50:22.540 --> 50:26.220
 And it's going to so-called delay your circadian clock.

50:26.220 --> 50:29.220
 It's going to make it such that you want to fall asleep

50:29.220 --> 50:31.980
 a little bit later, maybe even a lot later.

50:31.980 --> 50:34.760
 So if you're exercising in the afternoon or evening,

50:34.760 --> 50:36.180
 and that's the only time you can exercise

50:36.180 --> 50:38.840
 or that's the time that you prefer to exercise, great,

50:38.840 --> 50:41.460
 but be careful about ingesting too much caffeine

50:41.460 --> 50:43.340
 in order to get the energy to do that exercise

50:43.340 --> 50:45.740
 because that caffeine will disrupt your sleep.

50:45.740 --> 50:49.660
 And just know that you are delaying your circadian clock.

50:49.660 --> 50:51.880
 You are making it such that you will naturally

50:51.880 --> 50:54.780
 want to go to sleep later and wake up later.

50:54.780 --> 50:57.760
 Contrast that with if you exercise early in the day,

50:57.760 --> 50:59.580
 say immediately after waking up

50:59.580 --> 51:03.940
 or in the first zero to four hours after waking.

51:03.940 --> 51:05.880
 In most cases, that's not going to shift

51:05.880 --> 51:07.560
 your circadian clock much.

51:07.560 --> 51:09.100
 And toward the end of the episode,

51:09.100 --> 51:12.020
 we'll talk a little bit about forced exercise

51:12.020 --> 51:13.480
 prior to wake up times.

51:13.480 --> 51:14.980
 That doesn't mean doing exercise in your sleep.

51:14.980 --> 51:16.440
 That means deliberately setting an alarm

51:16.440 --> 51:18.900
 and getting out of bed much earlier than you naturally would.

51:18.900 --> 51:21.160
 That turns out to be a very potent tool

51:21.160 --> 51:25.780
 to so-called advance your circadian clock.

51:25.780 --> 51:28.260
 So we can talk about that a little bit later in the episode.

51:28.260 --> 51:31.500
 But this critical period too in the middle of the day

51:31.500 --> 51:33.960
 is when you're going to want to leverage specific tools.

51:33.960 --> 51:37.460
 And we've talked about those, limiting caffeine intake,

51:37.460 --> 51:40.960
 being mindful of the clock delaying effects of exercise,

51:40.960 --> 51:43.380
 the fact that also if you're going to nap,

51:43.380 --> 51:47.620
 you don't want to nap too long or too late into the day.

51:47.620 --> 51:49.580
 Otherwise it'll disrupt your nighttime sleep.

51:49.580 --> 51:52.380
 So this critical period too,

51:52.380 --> 51:53.820
 or second critical period I should say,

51:53.820 --> 51:54.940
 during the middle of the day,

51:54.940 --> 51:56.900
 is a time in which you should be doing certain things

51:56.900 --> 51:58.380
 and avoiding doing certain things.

51:58.380 --> 51:59.720
 So that raises the question of whether or not

51:59.720 --> 52:01.740
 you should also be getting a lot of light

52:01.740 --> 52:03.700
 in particular sunlight throughout the day.

52:03.700 --> 52:05.360
 Now that's something that hasn't been explored too much

52:05.360 --> 52:07.100
 in the literature until recently,

52:07.100 --> 52:08.340
 when Dr. Samara Tarr,

52:08.340 --> 52:10.700
 who's the director of the Chronobiology Unit

52:10.700 --> 52:12.240
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health

52:12.240 --> 52:13.700
 has decided to do a number of experiments,

52:13.700 --> 52:15.820
 exploring the effects of light on mood

52:15.820 --> 52:18.580
 and other aspects of brain function and body function

52:18.580 --> 52:20.340
 when that light is delivered, not just in the morning,

52:20.340 --> 52:22.860
 which is great for us, but also throughout the day.

52:22.860 --> 52:24.900
 So should you be looking at sunlight

52:24.900 --> 52:27.540
 or bright artificial lights throughout the day?

52:27.540 --> 52:29.060
 Now on the face of it, you might just think,

52:29.060 --> 52:30.480
 yes, you know, sunlight's great,

52:30.480 --> 52:32.300
 provided we're not getting a sunburn

52:32.300 --> 52:34.780
 and we're not staring at the sun and damaging our eyes,

52:34.780 --> 52:37.100
 we should get as much sunlight as we possibly can.

52:37.100 --> 52:39.620
 In fact, we talked about this in the episode on hormones,

52:39.620 --> 52:42.760
 about how getting light onto as much of our skin

52:42.760 --> 52:44.880
 as we can throughout the day can really help

52:44.880 --> 52:46.700
 in the production of testosterone and estrogen

52:46.700 --> 52:48.260
 in both men and women in healthy ways

52:48.260 --> 52:51.320
 that improves mood and libido and all sorts of things

52:51.320 --> 52:53.760
 that are associated with wellbeing.

52:53.760 --> 52:56.300
 However, because light is such a powerful stimulus

52:56.300 --> 52:59.100
 for controlling the timing of your sleepfulness

52:59.100 --> 53:02.380
 or sleepiness, I should say, and wakefulness,

53:02.380 --> 53:04.240
 we might want to be cautious about how much light

53:04.240 --> 53:06.140
 we are viewing in the afternoon,

53:06.140 --> 53:09.100
 in particular in the early evening hours, right?

53:09.100 --> 53:12.020
 Well, it turns out it's not so straightforward.

53:12.020 --> 53:14.380
 Viewing, so sunlight to the eyes,

53:14.380 --> 53:17.220
 sunlight in the late afternoon and evening hours,

53:17.220 --> 53:18.780
 so again, depends on time of year,

53:18.780 --> 53:21.100
 depends on location that you happen to be in,

53:21.100 --> 53:23.460
 but getting some sunlight in your eyes for, again,

53:23.460 --> 53:26.500
 maybe five or 10, maybe 30 minutes,

53:26.500 --> 53:28.460
 depending on how much cloud cover there is,

53:28.460 --> 53:30.340
 doing that in the afternoon

53:30.340 --> 53:33.220
 serves an additional beneficial purpose,

53:33.220 --> 53:37.860
 which is you protect or you inoculate your nervous system

53:37.860 --> 53:39.940
 against some of the negative effects

53:39.940 --> 53:44.500
 of bright artificial light or even dim artificial light

53:44.500 --> 53:47.380
 in the nighttime hours between 10 PM and 4 AM,

53:47.380 --> 53:49.300
 which is really critical period three.

53:49.300 --> 53:51.780
 And we'll talk about what to do and what to not do

53:51.780 --> 53:54.820
 during critical period three of every 24 hour cycle.

53:54.820 --> 53:57.380
 But to make it very clear what I'm saying here,

53:57.380 --> 53:59.380
 get that morning sunlight in your eyes,

53:59.380 --> 54:01.460
 but also get some sunlight in your eyes

54:01.460 --> 54:03.700
 in the late afternoon and evening hours

54:03.700 --> 54:05.740
 when the sun is at so-called low solar angle,

54:05.740 --> 54:07.860
 when it starts to descend in the sky.

54:07.860 --> 54:09.740
 Again, you don't have to stare directly at the sun,

54:09.740 --> 54:11.580
 although if you can catch a nice beautiful sunset,

54:11.580 --> 54:12.420
 go for it.

54:12.420 --> 54:15.380
 But as the sun starts to descend,

54:15.380 --> 54:19.300
 it triggers those same neurons in your eye

54:19.300 --> 54:21.100
 that communicate with your circadian clock,

54:21.100 --> 54:24.140
 but it communicates with a different component

54:24.140 --> 54:26.340
 or different compartment within the circadian clock.

54:26.340 --> 54:28.580
 That circadian clock is not just one thing,

54:28.580 --> 54:29.940
 it's multiple things, and you have what are called

54:29.940 --> 54:32.080
 morning oscillators and evening oscillators.

54:32.080 --> 54:33.820
 And to make a long story short,

54:33.820 --> 54:37.540
 the tool that I'm describing of looking at the sun

54:37.540 --> 54:39.500
 in the late afternoon and evening,

54:39.500 --> 54:42.700
 again, blinking is fine, don't stare at the sun,

54:42.700 --> 54:43.980
 but getting that sunlight in your eyes

54:43.980 --> 54:48.380
 in the late afternoon and evening signals to that clock

54:48.380 --> 54:51.980
 that it's evening time and that sleep is coming.

54:51.980 --> 54:56.460
 It also serves as a second anchor or reference point

54:56.460 --> 54:59.860
 for your body and your brain to know where it is in time.

54:59.860 --> 55:01.500
 Remember back to the beginning of the episode,

55:01.500 --> 55:03.200
 when I said your brain and your body

55:03.200 --> 55:05.460
 and all your organs are locked inside this skin

55:05.460 --> 55:07.460
 and the skull, and they don't know what's going on

55:07.460 --> 55:08.380
 in the outside world.

55:08.380 --> 55:10.040
 Well, that morning sunlight viewing

55:10.040 --> 55:12.900
 and the other things you do during critical period one,

55:12.900 --> 55:15.460
 those provide one strong set of signals

55:15.460 --> 55:17.100
 that it's wake up time and time to be alert

55:17.100 --> 55:18.340
 and time to be focused.

55:18.340 --> 55:20.220
 And then in the evening,

55:20.220 --> 55:23.220
 by getting sunlight in your eyes again,

55:23.220 --> 55:24.900
 and in particular sunlight

55:24.900 --> 55:27.840
 that comes from low solar angle sunlight,

55:27.840 --> 55:29.880
 well, that provides a second stimulus

55:29.880 --> 55:33.080
 or a second reference point that tells your brain and body,

55:33.080 --> 55:35.700
 hey, it's evening, the sun is descending.

55:35.700 --> 55:36.540
 And you might say, wait,

55:36.540 --> 55:38.980
 how does the brain and these neurons know the difference

55:38.980 --> 55:40.540
 between morning light and evening light?

55:40.540 --> 55:43.140
 It turns out has to do with the particular wavelengths

55:43.140 --> 55:46.180
 of light that are present in morning versus evening.

55:46.180 --> 55:47.820
 It's an incredible mechanism.

55:47.820 --> 55:50.740
 And you are probably familiar with the fact

55:50.740 --> 55:52.740
 that when the sun is directly overhead,

55:52.740 --> 55:55.520
 it's really bright white and yellow,

55:55.520 --> 55:56.780
 and the sky's often blue.

55:56.780 --> 55:58.300
 And if there's cloud cover just comes through

55:58.300 --> 55:59.580
 as a bunch of bright light.

55:59.580 --> 56:00.980
 Well, next time you're out in the morning,

56:00.980 --> 56:02.660
 take a look at what a sunrise looks like.

56:02.660 --> 56:04.900
 There's a lot of yellow blue contrast.

56:04.900 --> 56:08.220
 And those yellow blues signal important specific sets

56:08.220 --> 56:10.620
 of cells in your eye and brain that it's morning.

56:10.620 --> 56:13.100
 In the evening, you're also going to see yellow and blue,

56:13.100 --> 56:16.460
 but the ratio of yellows and blues has now changed.

56:16.460 --> 56:17.760
 And you also see some oranges.

56:17.760 --> 56:20.660
 And in a really brilliant sunset, you'll see some reds.

56:20.660 --> 56:22.340
 If you haven't noticed this already,

56:22.340 --> 56:23.440
 you'll really want to look for this.

56:23.440 --> 56:25.900
 It's like kind of fun and cool to look at.

56:25.900 --> 56:28.820
 Well, those yellows and blues and oranges

56:28.820 --> 56:30.340
 that you see in the evening sunsets,

56:30.340 --> 56:32.200
 those signal to your brain and body

56:32.200 --> 56:34.660
 that evening is there and that nighttime is coming.

56:34.660 --> 56:37.660
 And they're really establishing a second reference point

56:37.660 --> 56:39.960
 or wave front of biological signals

56:39.960 --> 56:42.420
 that are going to optimize your nighttime hours

56:42.420 --> 56:45.120
 and your transition into really terrific sleep.

56:45.120 --> 56:47.100
 So now let's talk about what I'm calling

56:47.100 --> 56:50.140
 critical period three of each 24 hour cycle.

56:50.140 --> 56:53.000
 So this would be the period of time of late evening.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.560
 So it might be 6 p.m. for some,

56:55.560 --> 56:57.620
 depending on when you go to sleep or 7 p.m.,

56:57.620 --> 57:00.840
 extending into the hours in which you decide

57:00.840 --> 57:02.300
 to get into bed and go to sleep

57:02.300 --> 57:03.880
 and then throughout the night.

57:03.880 --> 57:05.760
 There are a number of things that you're going to want to do

57:05.760 --> 57:07.200
 and there are a number of things

57:07.200 --> 57:09.360
 that you are going to want to avoid doing

57:09.360 --> 57:11.220
 in order to optimize your sleep.

57:11.220 --> 57:13.860
 First of all, you're going to want to avoid

57:13.860 --> 57:18.060
 bright artificial lights of any color.

57:18.060 --> 57:20.040
 Yes, of any color.

57:20.040 --> 57:21.700
 We haven't talked a lot about blue blockers,

57:21.700 --> 57:23.820
 you know, lenses that block blue wavelengths

57:23.820 --> 57:26.180
 or short wavelengths of light.

57:26.180 --> 57:27.840
 I don't have anything against blue blockers.

57:27.840 --> 57:30.060
 In fact, many people find that blue blockers

57:30.060 --> 57:34.040
 provide them some relief from headache and some eye strain

57:34.040 --> 57:35.540
 if they wear blue blockers throughout the day

57:35.540 --> 57:37.880
 and certainly at night, but you don't need them.

57:37.880 --> 57:40.040
 And even if you do wear them,

57:40.040 --> 57:42.380
 you will find that if lights are very bright,

57:42.380 --> 57:43.540
 doesn't matter if it's a blue light,

57:43.540 --> 57:45.340
 a yellow light, or a red light,

57:45.340 --> 57:48.660
 those bright lights will wake up your brain and body.

57:48.660 --> 57:51.080
 They will activate the same mechanisms

57:51.080 --> 57:53.500
 that were activated early in the day by sunlight.

57:53.500 --> 57:56.520
 However, and here's the really diabolical twist.

57:56.520 --> 57:57.360
 I mentioned this earlier,

57:57.360 --> 57:59.360
 but the diabolical twist in the way

57:59.360 --> 58:01.260
 that your brain and body respond to light

58:01.260 --> 58:03.920
 is that early in the day, in the morning hours,

58:03.920 --> 58:06.080
 you need a lot of bright light, ideally from sunlight,

58:06.080 --> 58:08.540
 to be very alert and to wake up.

58:08.540 --> 58:10.960
 But in the evening hours and nighttime hours,

58:10.960 --> 58:14.560
 it takes very little light, very few photons,

58:14.560 --> 58:17.060
 in order to wake up your brain and body

58:17.060 --> 58:20.380
 and to disrupt your circadian clock and disrupt your sleep.

58:20.380 --> 58:23.460
 So what that means is that once the sun goes down,

58:24.640 --> 58:27.580
 which of course is going to happen at different times of year

58:27.580 --> 58:28.900
 in different places on earth,

58:28.900 --> 58:30.600
 but once the sun goes down,

58:30.600 --> 58:32.940
 you would be wise to try and dim the lights

58:32.940 --> 58:35.480
 in your indoor environment most days, right?

58:35.480 --> 58:36.900
 I realize some nights you're going to throw a party

58:36.900 --> 58:37.940
 and have people over.

58:37.940 --> 58:38.940
 You might not want to dim the light.

58:38.940 --> 58:40.320
 Some nights you're going to go out.

58:40.320 --> 58:41.560
 You might view a lot of bright lights,

58:41.560 --> 58:43.540
 but most nights of your life,

58:43.540 --> 58:45.140
 you're going to want to dim the lights

58:45.140 --> 58:48.440
 in your internal environment.

58:48.440 --> 58:50.620
 And ideally the lights that you do use,

58:50.620 --> 58:52.820
 you would place low in that physical environment.

58:52.820 --> 58:55.020
 So you would try and not use overhead lights,

58:55.020 --> 58:56.940
 but rather rely on desk lamps

58:56.940 --> 59:00.020
 or lights even placed low to the floor, even on the floor.

59:00.980 --> 59:04.940
 If you are going to use light at night, and most people do,

59:04.940 --> 59:07.540
 I would encourage you to use as little artificial light

59:07.540 --> 59:09.980
 as is required to carry out the activities

59:09.980 --> 59:11.820
 you need to require safely.

59:11.820 --> 59:12.660
 That could be studying,

59:12.660 --> 59:14.420
 in which case you might need a little bit more light

59:14.420 --> 59:16.040
 in order to read or study.

59:16.040 --> 59:18.140
 If you're watching a television show

59:18.140 --> 59:19.900
 or you're watching something on your computer,

59:19.900 --> 59:22.940
 dim that screen way, way down as dim as possible

59:22.940 --> 59:24.500
 while still of course being able to view

59:24.500 --> 59:25.580
 what you need to view.

59:25.580 --> 59:27.260
 Even better, I should say,

59:27.260 --> 59:30.140
 ideally you would use candlelight and or moonlight.

59:30.140 --> 59:31.880
 Now, some nights the moon is really bright

59:31.880 --> 59:33.660
 and you actually can use moonlight

59:33.660 --> 59:35.380
 to go about your usual activities.

59:35.380 --> 59:37.940
 Moonlight might seem very, very bright,

59:37.940 --> 59:42.740
 but actually moonlight is fairly low light intensity

59:42.740 --> 59:45.380
 and candlelight, which can also seem very bright,

59:45.380 --> 59:47.840
 actually is very low light intensity.

59:47.840 --> 59:49.940
 If you're sitting across a table

59:49.940 --> 59:52.720
 with some candlelight there, and it's a really bright candle

59:52.720 --> 59:55.940
 chances are it's only about three to 10 lux,

59:55.940 --> 59:58.600
 which is very, very little light energy

59:58.600 --> 1:00:00.780
 compared to say an artificial desk lamp

1:00:00.780 --> 1:00:02.660
 or an overhead light, which is going to be in the area

1:00:02.660 --> 1:00:05.640
 of anywhere from a hundred to a thousand lux.

1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:08.240
 So candlelight is fine, of course,

1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:11.180
 be cautious with open flame, but candlelight is fine,

1:00:11.180 --> 1:00:14.300
 moonlight is fine, dimming artificial lights is fine

1:00:14.300 --> 1:00:16.220
 provided they're dimmed way, way down.

1:00:16.220 --> 1:00:20.380
 And again, try and avoid using overhead artificial lights.

1:00:20.380 --> 1:00:22.060
 The absolute worst lights are going to be

1:00:22.060 --> 1:00:23.780
 overhead fluorescent lights of the sort

1:00:23.780 --> 1:00:26.060
 that you would have in the supermarket

1:00:26.060 --> 1:00:28.480
 or that you would see at a gas station

1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:29.540
 or something of that sort.

1:00:29.540 --> 1:00:33.580
 And I confess there are times in which I'm driving home

1:00:33.580 --> 1:00:35.780
 and it's late at night and I want to be able to get to sleep

1:00:35.780 --> 1:00:37.740
 and I'll need to stop at the grocery store

1:00:37.740 --> 1:00:39.080
 or a gas station or something like that.

1:00:39.080 --> 1:00:40.920
 I've actually put on sunglasses at night

1:00:40.920 --> 1:00:44.460
 in order to avoid getting that bright light exposure

1:00:44.460 --> 1:00:46.780
 at night, although that's a little bit extreme.

1:00:46.780 --> 1:00:48.380
 I have done that from time to time

1:00:48.380 --> 1:00:51.360
 because that bright light exposure will absolutely quash.

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:54.260
 It will eliminate any melatonin

1:00:54.260 --> 1:00:56.380
 that happens to be circulating in your brain and body.

1:00:56.380 --> 1:00:58.620
 Now, melatonin, a lot of people think of as a supplement,

1:00:58.620 --> 1:01:00.840
 but melatonin is naturally released

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:03.780
 as the evening comes about and into the nighttime hours.

1:01:03.780 --> 1:01:05.820
 It's a hormone that makes you feel sleepy

1:01:05.820 --> 1:01:07.460
 and allows you to fall asleep.

1:01:07.460 --> 1:01:10.320
 So viewing bright light in the late evening hours

1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:12.820
 and nighttime hours is really not good

1:01:12.820 --> 1:01:14.540
 for your sleep quality

1:01:14.540 --> 1:01:17.060
 and your ability to fall and stay asleep.

1:01:17.060 --> 1:01:19.220
 So for most people, a simple rule of thumb

1:01:19.220 --> 1:01:23.140
 is going to be avoid bright artificial lights of all colors

1:01:23.140 --> 1:01:25.240
 and in particular overhead bright artificial lights

1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:27.660
 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

1:01:27.660 --> 1:01:29.180
 That's right, between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.,

1:01:29.180 --> 1:01:32.320
 avoid those bright artificial lights as much as possible.

1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:35.580
 Use only as much light as is absolutely necessary

1:01:35.580 --> 1:01:37.980
 in order to carry out the routines and activities

1:01:37.980 --> 1:01:39.900
 you need to carry out safely.

1:01:39.900 --> 1:01:41.740
 I should mention that the reason overhead lights

1:01:41.740 --> 1:01:45.200
 are problematic is the same reason why sunlight

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:47.660
 is so great early in the day, which is that the cells,

1:01:47.660 --> 1:01:51.500
 that is the neurons that can wake up your brain and body

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:53.420
 through activation of the circadian clock,

1:01:53.420 --> 1:01:56.220
 reside mainly in the bottom half or two thirds

1:01:56.220 --> 1:01:57.200
 of your neural retina.

1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:59.220
 And the way the optics of your eyes work

1:01:59.220 --> 1:02:01.540
 is that the cells on the bottom half of your eye

1:02:01.540 --> 1:02:02.940
 view the upper visual field.

1:02:02.940 --> 1:02:05.860
 So this is a beautiful adaptive mechanism

1:02:05.860 --> 1:02:08.480
 that allows these cells to respond to overhead light

1:02:08.480 --> 1:02:12.100
 from sunlight in the early part of the day

1:02:12.100 --> 1:02:13.180
 and throughout the day.

1:02:13.180 --> 1:02:15.940
 But in the evening, if you have bright artificial lights on

1:02:15.940 --> 1:02:18.300
 and those bright artificial lights are overhead lights,

1:02:18.300 --> 1:02:21.980
 it's going to more closely mimic what sunlight does

1:02:21.980 --> 1:02:23.420
 in the evening time.

1:02:23.420 --> 1:02:24.700
 And that turns out to be a bad thing

1:02:24.700 --> 1:02:26.640
 if your goal is to eventually go to sleep.

1:02:26.640 --> 1:02:29.400
 So again, do like the Scandinavians do,

1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:32.100
 use lights that are set low in the room at night.

1:02:32.100 --> 1:02:35.100
 And if you really want to optimize your sleep-wake cycles,

1:02:35.100 --> 1:02:37.480
 I suppose you could also do the opposite throughout the day.

1:02:37.480 --> 1:02:38.820
 You could really emphasize the use

1:02:38.820 --> 1:02:41.220
 of bright artificial lights and sunlight

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:42.040
 that comes from above.

1:02:42.040 --> 1:02:43.880
 And of course, sunlight always comes from above,

1:02:43.880 --> 1:02:48.600
 but if you're working in a given office environment

1:02:48.600 --> 1:02:50.220
 and it's 2 p.m. or 3 p.m.

1:02:50.220 --> 1:02:52.100
 and you want to be as awake as possible,

1:02:52.100 --> 1:02:53.540
 really crank up the overhead lights.

1:02:53.540 --> 1:02:54.820
 And then in the evening,

1:02:54.820 --> 1:02:57.100
 which is this critical period three that we're referring to,

1:02:57.100 --> 1:03:00.100
 really try and dim those lights or have them off

1:03:00.100 --> 1:03:01.820
 or just rely on candlelight or moonlight

1:03:01.820 --> 1:03:05.280
 from the hours of about 10 p.m. until 4 a.m.

1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:06.540
 Our good friend, Samir Hattar,

1:03:06.540 --> 1:03:08.080
 who's been on this podcast before,

1:03:08.080 --> 1:03:10.140
 Samir is director of the Chronobiology Unit

1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:12.220
 at the National Institutes of Mental Health.

1:03:12.220 --> 1:03:15.180
 Well, he's absolutely obsessive about this light stuff

1:03:15.180 --> 1:03:16.120
 and avoiding light at night.

1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:20.460
 In fact, he lives in what I joke is like a cave at night

1:03:20.460 --> 1:03:22.380
 from 9 p.m. until 5 a.m.,

1:03:22.380 --> 1:03:25.380
 which is really his kind of sleep cycle.

1:03:25.380 --> 1:03:27.980
 He has his house so dark that you'd be lucky

1:03:27.980 --> 1:03:29.940
 to be able to find a spoon in the kitchen.

1:03:29.940 --> 1:03:31.740
 In fact, you'd be lucky to find your way down the hallway

1:03:31.740 --> 1:03:32.580
 if you're me.

1:03:32.580 --> 1:03:35.620
 But in any case, dim the lights from them way, way down.

1:03:35.620 --> 1:03:36.540
 It will serve you well.

1:03:36.540 --> 1:03:40.140
 It will make it much easier for you to get sleepy

1:03:40.140 --> 1:03:42.700
 and stay sleepy and fall asleep and stay asleep

1:03:42.700 --> 1:03:43.560
 throughout the night.

1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:46.460
 Now, not to depart from this critical period three,

1:03:46.460 --> 1:03:51.420
 but if you recall viewing that afternoon light, right?

1:03:51.420 --> 1:03:54.140
 The low solar angle light as the sun is heading down

1:03:54.140 --> 1:03:55.820
 in the sky, so it could be sunset

1:03:55.820 --> 1:03:59.500
 or what I call circa sunset, around sunset.

1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:01.680
 Well, doing that is going to slightly

1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:04.500
 but not completely offset any of the negative effects

1:04:04.500 --> 1:04:06.800
 of viewing artificial light at night.

1:04:06.800 --> 1:04:08.480
 So I don't want to give people a pass here,

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:10.340
 but let's say you know that you're going

1:04:10.340 --> 1:04:13.000
 to watch some Netflix at night,

1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:14.900
 or you're going to be up late studying

1:04:14.900 --> 1:04:17.580
 and yet you still want to be able to fall and stay asleep.

1:04:17.580 --> 1:04:20.100
 Definitely make sure you see that evening light.

1:04:20.100 --> 1:04:21.300
 There's a great study.

1:04:21.300 --> 1:04:22.940
 We'll provide a link to the study which showed

1:04:22.940 --> 1:04:26.840
 that if people view evening sunset light

1:04:26.840 --> 1:04:29.460
 or evening sunsets or sunlight right around the time

1:04:29.460 --> 1:04:32.140
 of sunset, it really serves to inoculate

1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:34.340
 or offset some, again, some,

1:04:34.340 --> 1:04:36.420
 not all of the negative effects of artificial light

1:04:36.420 --> 1:04:38.740
 between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.

1:04:38.740 --> 1:04:40.440
 Now that's light, but as you recall,

1:04:40.440 --> 1:04:43.220
 we also have this tool related to temperature.

1:04:43.220 --> 1:04:46.180
 And you're probably not going to be surprised

1:04:46.180 --> 1:04:48.060
 that the way to leverage temperature

1:04:48.060 --> 1:04:50.180
 in the evening is the exact opposite of the way

1:04:50.180 --> 1:04:52.420
 that you want to leverage temperature early in the day.

1:04:52.420 --> 1:04:55.080
 Early in the day, temperature increases from cold showers

1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:57.260
 or exercise, et cetera, wake you up.

1:04:57.260 --> 1:05:00.000
 What that means is that taking a cold shower late at night

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.940
 is probably a bad idea.

1:05:01.940 --> 1:05:05.080
 Rather, taking a nice hot bath or a sauna,

1:05:05.080 --> 1:05:07.680
 you might think would heat up your body.

1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:08.680
 And indeed that's what happens

1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:10.320
 if you stay in a very long time,

1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:13.160
 but if you do hot tub or a hot bath or a sauna

1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:14.560
 in the evening and you don't stay in

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.620
 for more than 20 or 30 minutes and you get out,

1:05:16.620 --> 1:05:20.340
 you take maybe a cool-ish shower or a warm shower,

1:05:20.340 --> 1:05:23.360
 then what happens is there's a compensatory cooling off

1:05:23.360 --> 1:05:24.620
 of your core body temperature

1:05:24.620 --> 1:05:26.080
 for the reasons we discussed earlier.

1:05:26.080 --> 1:05:29.120
 And your body temperature will drop by one to three degrees

1:05:29.120 --> 1:05:31.520
 and it will make it much easier to get into sleep.

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:34.680
 So if you're somebody that enjoys hot baths, hot showers,

1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:36.760
 or hot tubs, evening and nighttime

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:38.100
 is going to be the best time to do that

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:40.400
 if your goal is to facilitate sleep.

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:43.240
 Similarly, you should try and make your sleeping environment

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:45.440
 pretty cool, if not cold.

1:05:45.440 --> 1:05:46.820
 Now, that doesn't mean you need to be cold

1:05:46.820 --> 1:05:47.960
 while you're asleep.

1:05:47.960 --> 1:05:49.820
 You can get under as many blankets as you need,

1:05:49.820 --> 1:05:52.740
 but it's a good idea to make your sleeping environment cool.

1:05:52.740 --> 1:05:55.000
 In fact, drop the temperature in that sleeping environment

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.960
 by at least three degrees,

1:05:56.960 --> 1:05:58.720
 and you'll be happy that you did.

1:05:58.720 --> 1:06:01.140
 Now, some people rely on things like eight sleep.

1:06:01.140 --> 1:06:02.160
 I use that one of these

1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:05.060
 controllable temperature mattress covers.

1:06:05.060 --> 1:06:06.500
 Other people would simply do this

1:06:06.500 --> 1:06:09.260
 by putting a fan in the room or opening a window.

1:06:09.260 --> 1:06:11.340
 Again, depends on time of year, depends on technology,

1:06:11.340 --> 1:06:12.680
 depends on budgets, et cetera.

1:06:12.680 --> 1:06:13.880
 But you're going to want to sleep

1:06:13.880 --> 1:06:16.640
 in a relatively cool or cold sleeping environment

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:20.880
 and then layer on the blankets as needed to stay asleep.

1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:22.160
 And I say as needed,

1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:24.120
 because one of the things that you're going to do

1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:27.120
 in your sleep or if you happen to wake up

1:06:27.120 --> 1:06:28.440
 is if you're too warm,

1:06:28.440 --> 1:06:30.800
 you're going to put a foot or a hand out

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:32.240
 from under those blankets.

1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:34.480
 And the reason for doing that is very logical.

1:06:34.480 --> 1:06:37.700
 Once you understand the mechanism, you have special portals.

1:06:37.700 --> 1:06:41.240
 You essentially have ways of passing heat, excuse me,

1:06:41.240 --> 1:06:43.100
 in and out of your body,

1:06:43.100 --> 1:06:44.880
 primarily through the palms of your hands,

1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:47.240
 the upper half of your face and the bottoms of your feet

1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:48.520
 through so-called glabrous skin.

1:06:48.520 --> 1:06:50.860
 This was covered in the episode with Dr. Craig Heller

1:06:50.860 --> 1:06:52.860
 from the biology department at Stanford.

1:06:53.800 --> 1:06:55.880
 If you lower the temperature in your sleeping environment,

1:06:55.880 --> 1:06:57.520
 so lower the temperature in that room

1:06:57.520 --> 1:06:59.680
 or use a controllable mattress cover

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:01.100
 that can cool down like eight sleep

1:07:01.100 --> 1:07:02.300
 or something of that sort,

1:07:02.300 --> 1:07:05.660
 it's naturally going to make your sleep environment cooler.

1:07:05.660 --> 1:07:07.760
 And if you're too warm under the blankets,

1:07:07.760 --> 1:07:09.940
 all you have to do is extend a hand or a foot out

1:07:09.940 --> 1:07:11.020
 from under those blankets.

1:07:11.020 --> 1:07:12.840
 Whereas if the sleeping environment that you're in

1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:16.060
 is too warm, there's very little you can do to cool off

1:07:16.060 --> 1:07:17.760
 besides push off those blankets.

1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:19.040
 So for instance, if you're too warm

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:20.340
 and you're waking up in the middle of the night,

1:07:20.340 --> 1:07:22.140
 which is what happens if you get too warm,

1:07:22.140 --> 1:07:23.240
 you'll push off those blankets.

1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:25.560
 But if the room is too warm, well, what are you going to do?

1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:27.760
 You'd probably have to put your hands into some cool water

1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:29.800
 or take a coolish shower or something

1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:30.960
 for a couple of seconds.

1:07:30.960 --> 1:07:32.360
 That's not very practical.

1:07:32.360 --> 1:07:35.200
 Better to just keep the sleeping environment cool.

1:07:35.200 --> 1:07:37.800
 I'm not a big fan of people putting socks on

1:07:37.800 --> 1:07:38.800
 while they sleep, or I should say,

1:07:38.800 --> 1:07:40.840
 I'm not a fan of putting socks on while I sleep

1:07:40.840 --> 1:07:43.340
 because that eliminates this glabber skin portal

1:07:43.340 --> 1:07:44.840
 on the bottoms of one's feet.

1:07:44.840 --> 1:07:46.120
 So for those of you that have heard,

1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:47.220
 wear socks while you sleep,

1:07:47.220 --> 1:07:50.280
 that works great for people that tend to run too cold

1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:52.680
 while they sleep and wake up because their feet get cold.

1:07:52.680 --> 1:07:53.840
 But if you're somebody who wakes up

1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:54.680
 in the middle of the night,

1:07:54.680 --> 1:07:55.500
 chances are you're waking up

1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:57.920
 because you're getting too warm.

1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:00.140
 And the best thing that you could do is to cool

1:08:00.140 --> 1:08:01.920
 or lower the temperature in the room that you're sleeping

1:08:01.920 --> 1:08:03.040
 and not wear socks.

1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:05.060
 Get under as many blankets as you need to.

1:08:05.060 --> 1:08:06.880
 Fall asleep and then across the night,

1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:08.620
 you'll naturally just move a hand or a foot

1:08:08.620 --> 1:08:10.760
 or all hands and feet out from under those blankets

1:08:10.760 --> 1:08:13.300
 to cool off because of the relationship

1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:14.400
 between temperature and sleep.

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:16.600
 That is dropping your core body temperature

1:08:16.600 --> 1:08:18.640
 one to three degrees gets you into sleep

1:08:18.640 --> 1:08:19.940
 and helps you stay asleep.

1:08:19.940 --> 1:08:21.880
 So let's say you do exercise late in the day

1:08:21.880 --> 1:08:23.760
 and you're finding yourself very alert in the evening

1:08:23.760 --> 1:08:25.360
 and you need to fall asleep.

1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:26.720
 Or let's say you've exercised

1:08:26.720 --> 1:08:29.320
 and you needed four cups of espresso

1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:31.000
 in order to do that exercise.

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.080
 Well, there are a few things that you can do

1:08:32.080 --> 1:08:34.160
 to try and bring your nervous system down

1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:35.840
 into more state of calmness.

1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:36.880
 And you can do that also

1:08:36.880 --> 1:08:39.180
 by lowering your core body temperature.

1:08:39.180 --> 1:08:40.760
 One of those I already talked about before,

1:08:40.760 --> 1:08:43.180
 taking a nice hot shower or a hot bath

1:08:43.180 --> 1:08:44.480
 and then getting out and cooling off

1:08:44.480 --> 1:08:46.320
 will decrease your body temperature.

1:08:46.320 --> 1:08:48.520
 Maybe not enough to get you into sleep

1:08:48.520 --> 1:08:51.000
 if you have a ton of caffeine in your system.

1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:54.920
 But again, you can use this mechanism of temperature shifts

1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:57.640
 to wake up or temperature shifts to fall asleep

1:08:57.640 --> 1:08:59.720
 in ways that really can help you overcome

1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:03.560
 some of the irregularities in your sleep-wake cycle

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:05.440
 and exercise cycle, et cetera.

1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:07.320
 Because of course, nobody's perfect.

1:09:07.320 --> 1:09:09.540
 Some days we end up having a workout in the afternoon

1:09:09.540 --> 1:09:11.360
 or we'll miss the workout entirely.

1:09:11.360 --> 1:09:13.240
 Other days we end up having that cup of coffee

1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:14.160
 in the afternoon with a friend

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:15.960
 and then we have a hard time falling asleep.

1:09:15.960 --> 1:09:17.200
 So you can use these tools,

1:09:17.200 --> 1:09:19.320
 not just in their optimized form,

1:09:19.320 --> 1:09:21.440
 being absolutely obsessive and compulsive

1:09:21.440 --> 1:09:23.620
 about exactly when you do each of those tools.

1:09:23.620 --> 1:09:24.680
 That would be wonderful.

1:09:24.680 --> 1:09:27.040
 But life happens, as they say.

1:09:27.040 --> 1:09:29.340
 And some days you're going to feel too alert at night

1:09:29.340 --> 1:09:30.420
 and you want to fall asleep,

1:09:30.420 --> 1:09:33.440
 or you got to get up especially early the next morning

1:09:33.440 --> 1:09:35.760
 and you're not somebody who normally goes to bed at 10 PM.

1:09:35.760 --> 1:09:37.920
 Well, that's when something like a hot bath or a sauna

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:38.760
 can really benefit you

1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:41.080
 because it can adjust your temperature rhythm accordingly.

1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:44.040
 I would be remiss if I didn't touch on alcohol

1:09:44.040 --> 1:09:46.100
 and CBD and THC.

1:09:46.100 --> 1:09:48.000
 I always get questions about these.

1:09:48.000 --> 1:09:51.760
 And I should say, of course, many places, but not all,

1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:54.360
 THC is illegal, although there are medical uses

1:09:54.360 --> 1:09:56.960
 and some places it's decriminalized,

1:09:56.960 --> 1:09:58.820
 other places it's legal.

1:09:58.820 --> 1:10:01.960
 Alcohol, of course, is consumed almost as frequently

1:10:01.960 --> 1:10:03.560
 as caffeine is consumed.

1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:04.860
 I personally don't drink alcohol.

1:10:04.860 --> 1:10:07.120
 I don't have anything against it per se.

1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:09.120
 I just don't tend to enjoy it.

1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:11.580
 One of the reasons I don't enjoy it is if I drink alcohol,

1:10:11.580 --> 1:10:12.940
 I simply fall asleep.

1:10:12.940 --> 1:10:15.100
 So that doesn't really accomplish any of the things

1:10:15.100 --> 1:10:16.600
 that I really want to accomplish

1:10:16.600 --> 1:10:20.120
 because the sleep that one gets after drinking alcohol

1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:22.340
 is greatly disrupted sleep.

1:10:22.340 --> 1:10:23.980
 Hate to break it to you,

1:10:23.980 --> 1:10:24.820
 but that's the truth.

1:10:24.820 --> 1:10:27.480
 And when Dr. Matt Walker came on this podcast,

1:10:27.480 --> 1:10:29.080
 he said exactly the same thing.

1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:34.080
 While THC and alcohol do help some people fall asleep

1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:36.360
 and maybe even stay asleep,

1:10:36.360 --> 1:10:39.460
 the architecture of that sleep is suboptimal

1:10:39.460 --> 1:10:40.680
 compared to the sleep they would get

1:10:40.680 --> 1:10:43.100
 without alcohol or THC in their system.

1:10:43.100 --> 1:10:45.600
 So I'm not here to tell you what to do or not to do.

1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:48.880
 I'm certainly not the substance police.

1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:50.020
 That's not my role.

1:10:50.020 --> 1:10:51.560
 I'm just reporting to you the biology.

1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:54.660
 If your sleep is not restoring you

1:10:54.660 --> 1:10:56.660
 to the extent that you feel it should,

1:10:56.660 --> 1:10:59.920
 or if you are regularly relying on a drink or two

1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:04.500
 in order to fall asleep or THC in order to fall asleep,

1:11:04.500 --> 1:11:07.360
 that is disrupting your total pattern of sleep.

1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:09.280
 However, I do realize that nowadays,

1:11:09.280 --> 1:11:12.980
 a lot of people are relying on THC and or CBD,

1:11:12.980 --> 1:11:16.100
 especially edible forms in order to fall and stay asleep.

1:11:16.100 --> 1:11:18.580
 And, you know, we can just acknowledge the data.

1:11:18.580 --> 1:11:21.480
 It does seem that there's an anxiety lowering effect

1:11:21.480 --> 1:11:24.240
 of some of those compounds that do help people

1:11:24.240 --> 1:11:26.580
 who have a hard time falling and staying asleep

1:11:26.580 --> 1:11:28.860
 because of reasons related to anxiety.

1:11:28.860 --> 1:11:29.700
 Although in a moment,

1:11:29.700 --> 1:11:33.180
 we'll talk about some supplements and supplement protocols

1:11:33.180 --> 1:11:36.160
 that can also assist in the ability to fall and stay asleep

1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:37.640
 and that can adjust anxiety

1:11:37.640 --> 1:11:40.240
 and that do not seem to disrupt sleep architecture

1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:42.600
 in negative ways and in fact can enhance the depth

1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:44.800
 and quality of sleep architecture.

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:47.560
 Okay, so you've done everything correctly up until now.

1:11:47.560 --> 1:11:50.440
 You've got your morning routine from critical period one,

1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:51.520
 you've got your afternoon routine,

1:11:51.520 --> 1:11:53.580
 you saw some sunlight in the afternoon,

1:11:53.580 --> 1:11:55.320
 you avoided caffeine in the eight hours

1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:58.460
 or 10 hours before bedtime, you're not drinking alcohol,

1:11:58.460 --> 1:12:00.420
 you've cooled down the room,

1:12:00.420 --> 1:12:01.520
 you're doing all these things right,

1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:04.160
 you dim the lights, et cetera, et cetera.

1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:06.680
 What else can we do in order to optimize our sleep?

1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:10.600
 Well, I always say behavioral tools first,

1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:11.840
 then look to nutrition,

1:12:11.840 --> 1:12:14.520
 then if necessary, look to supplementation,

1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:18.800
 and then if still necessary, look to prescription drugs,

1:12:18.800 --> 1:12:22.000
 obviously prescribed by a board certified physician.

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:24.160
 Well, we've talked a lot about the behavioral tools

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:25.660
 for critical period three,

1:12:25.660 --> 1:12:27.120
 we have not talked a lot about

1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:28.920
 the supplementation based tools.

1:12:28.920 --> 1:12:30.980
 There are supplements that for most people

1:12:30.980 --> 1:12:35.080
 will greatly improve their ability to fall and stay asleep

1:12:35.080 --> 1:12:38.440
 and the three main supplements in that category

1:12:38.440 --> 1:12:40.780
 or that kit of sleep supplements,

1:12:40.780 --> 1:12:44.200
 and I've talked about these before, are magnesium threonate,

1:12:44.200 --> 1:12:49.200
 so T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E, apigenin,

1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:51.960
 A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,

1:12:51.960 --> 1:12:55.400
 and theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E, theanine.

1:12:55.400 --> 1:12:58.340
 Now, some important things to point out about magthreonate

1:12:58.340 --> 1:13:00.280
 as it's called apigenin and theanine.

1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:03.520
 First of all, you don't necessarily need to take all three,

1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:05.920
 although many people get a synergistic effect

1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:07.180
 from taking all three,

1:13:07.180 --> 1:13:10.240
 in fact, you may not even need to take even one.

1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:13.040
 What I recommend is that if you're already doing

1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:15.760
 all the behavioral tools regularly

1:13:15.760 --> 1:13:17.900
 and you're still having trouble falling asleep

1:13:17.900 --> 1:13:21.920
 and staying asleep, well, then you might try one

1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:24.120
 of the supplements within this sleep stack.

1:13:24.120 --> 1:13:26.200
 They do have fairly wide margins for safety,

1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:29.760
 although I should also say anytime you're going to add

1:13:29.760 --> 1:13:31.860
 or remove something from your supplement protocol,

1:13:31.860 --> 1:13:33.120
 your nutritional program,

1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:34.600
 you definitely want to talk to your physician.

1:13:34.600 --> 1:13:35.760
 I don't just say that to protect us,

1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:38.020
 I say that to protect you, but for most people,

1:13:38.020 --> 1:13:39.320
 the margins of safety on these things

1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:40.600
 are going to be pretty broad.

1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:42.960
 A couple of notes about dosages.

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:45.120
 For some people, the dosages of any one

1:13:45.120 --> 1:13:47.820
 or several of the supplements I mentioned will be zero.

1:13:47.820 --> 1:13:50.000
 That is, you won't need them in order to get

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:53.240
 and stay asleep most nights of your life.

1:13:53.240 --> 1:13:55.240
 That's terrific if you don't need them.

1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:56.680
 For many people, however,

1:13:56.680 --> 1:14:01.160
 taking 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate

1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:02.500
 can be very beneficial.

1:14:02.500 --> 1:14:06.240
 That's the dosage that most people will benefit from.

1:14:06.240 --> 1:14:07.540
 Some people need to go a little higher,

1:14:07.540 --> 1:14:09.500
 some people need to go a little bit lower.

1:14:09.500 --> 1:14:11.160
 One of the reasons that we've been pointing people

1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:14.760
 towards single ingredient formulations these days

1:14:14.760 --> 1:14:17.380
 is because it allows people to adjust the dosage

1:14:17.380 --> 1:14:19.780
 of one component of a so-called sleep stack

1:14:19.780 --> 1:14:23.620
 without having to disrupt the dosage of another component

1:14:23.620 --> 1:14:24.460
 and so on.

1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:26.560
 It also allows people to try just one element

1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:29.920
 within the sleep stack without having to purchase

1:14:29.920 --> 1:14:31.640
 and try the others, which is a problem

1:14:31.640 --> 1:14:33.920
 if you're buying a blend of a lot of different ingredients.

1:14:33.920 --> 1:14:36.960
 So 145 milligrams of magnesium threonate,

1:14:36.960 --> 1:14:39.880
 50, five zero milligrams of apigenin,

1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:42.560
 and again, you could just take the apigenin on its own,

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:46.560
 and 100 to 400 milligrams of theanine,

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:48.840
 taken, again, alone or in combination

1:14:48.840 --> 1:14:51.340
 with the other supplements mentioned in this stack,

1:14:51.340 --> 1:14:54.200
 many people find allows them to get really drowsy

1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:56.620
 and fall asleep, sleep really deeply,

1:14:56.620 --> 1:14:58.760
 and they feel much more refreshed the next day

1:14:58.760 --> 1:15:01.120
 and they don't have a grogginess to them.

1:15:01.120 --> 1:15:04.620
 Now, a couple of notes about these different supplements.

1:15:04.620 --> 1:15:09.200
 About 5% of people report that magnesium threonate

1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:10.380
 really disrupts their gut.

1:15:10.380 --> 1:15:12.640
 It gives them diarrhea or gastric distress,

1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:14.440
 in which case, don't take it.

1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:19.440
 If magnesium threonate disrupts your gut or your digestion

1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:21.180
 to a point where it's uncomfortable or at all

1:15:21.180 --> 1:15:23.040
 and you don't like it, don't take any of it.

1:15:23.040 --> 1:15:24.400
 The proper dosage for you, in other words,

1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:26.140
 would be zero milligrams.

1:15:26.140 --> 1:15:28.240
 Now, in a slightly different way,

1:15:28.240 --> 1:15:31.240
 many people who can tolerate magnesium threonate

1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:35.040
 or really thrive on magnesium threonate and like apigenin

1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:37.040
 might find that theanine,

1:15:37.040 --> 1:15:39.160
 even at the lowest dose of 100 milligrams,

1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:41.160
 because again, the range is 100 to 400 milligrams,

1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:44.060
 that theanine gives them such vivid dreams

1:15:44.060 --> 1:15:46.360
 that they actually find it disruptive

1:15:46.360 --> 1:15:47.900
 or they wake up in the middle of the night

1:15:47.900 --> 1:15:49.800
 or they find that the sleep that they're getting

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:51.340
 is kind of anxiety-ridden

1:15:51.340 --> 1:15:53.100
 because of the intensity of those dreams.

1:15:53.100 --> 1:15:55.200
 So some people might choose to leave theanine

1:15:55.200 --> 1:15:56.360
 out of the sleep stack

1:15:56.360 --> 1:15:58.600
 and just take magnesium threonate or apigenin.

1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:00.500
 Again, some people might leave magnesium threonate

1:16:00.500 --> 1:16:01.600
 out of the sleep stack.

1:16:02.760 --> 1:16:04.760
 Again, all of this is really about

1:16:04.760 --> 1:16:08.000
 finding the supplementation protocol that's ideal for you.

1:16:08.000 --> 1:16:09.280
 I should mention that whether or not

1:16:09.280 --> 1:16:10.840
 you're taking one or two or three

1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:12.780
 of the components of the sleep stack,

1:16:13.620 --> 1:16:14.820
 the ideal time to take those

1:16:14.820 --> 1:16:17.120
 is 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime,

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:19.120
 especially if you haven't had anything to eat

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:21.040
 for the three hours or so before bedtime.

1:16:21.040 --> 1:16:22.720
 I confess that oftentimes I'll have

1:16:22.720 --> 1:16:24.120
 a little bit of a snack late in the evening,

1:16:24.120 --> 1:16:25.520
 some berries or something.

1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:27.440
 I try not to eat too close to bedtime,

1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:29.280
 but some evenings, just because of work schedule,

1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:32.320
 I'll get home late, be 9 p.m., and I'll eat a big meal,

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:34.400
 and then I'll take the sleep stack and fall asleep.

1:16:34.400 --> 1:16:36.400
 Every once in a while, that just so happens.

1:16:36.400 --> 1:16:37.480
 Nobody's perfect.

1:16:37.480 --> 1:16:39.280
 Certainly I'm not.

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:41.880
 But that sleep stack can be very beneficial,

1:16:41.880 --> 1:16:44.660
 and I do think that it's preferable to melatonin.

1:16:44.660 --> 1:16:45.500
 Here's the reason.

1:16:45.500 --> 1:16:47.280
 First of all, melatonin is a hormone

1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:48.600
 that you endogenously make.

1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:50.240
 You now know a lot about melatonin,

1:16:50.240 --> 1:16:52.040
 and it's controlled by light,

1:16:52.040 --> 1:16:54.760
 meaning light inhibits it or eliminates it.

1:16:54.760 --> 1:16:56.020
 Darkness promotes it.

1:16:56.920 --> 1:17:01.080
 And melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep,

1:17:01.080 --> 1:17:02.680
 but the dosages of melatonin

1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:04.440
 that are contained in most commercial products

1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:07.680
 is far, far, far greater than what we would make

1:17:07.680 --> 1:17:10.880
 endogenously, so it's really supra physiological.

1:17:10.880 --> 1:17:12.920
 So that's of concern because melatonin

1:17:12.920 --> 1:17:15.920
 is not just responsible for making us sleepy

1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:16.880
 and fall asleep.

1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:19.500
 It also does things like interacts

1:17:19.500 --> 1:17:22.080
 with other hormone systems, testosterone and estrogen,

1:17:22.080 --> 1:17:23.960
 even in the puberty system in kids.

1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:27.680
 Is taking melatonin every once in a while a problem

1:17:27.680 --> 1:17:29.660
 for adjusting to jet lag, et cetera?

1:17:29.660 --> 1:17:30.680
 Probably not.

1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:33.920
 I would even say no, but taking it chronically over time,

1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:36.480
 especially kids taking it chronically over time

1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:38.000
 can potentially be problematic.

1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:39.460
 So at least in my opinion,

1:17:39.460 --> 1:17:41.300
 these other supplements are going to be preferable

1:17:41.300 --> 1:17:42.680
 to melatonin.

1:17:42.680 --> 1:17:44.720
 Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of today's episode,

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:46.080
 there are some other things

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:48.240
 that I certainly take every once in a while

1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:51.100
 and that other people might consider taking

1:17:51.100 --> 1:17:53.880
 in addition to the sleep stack I talked about before

1:17:53.880 --> 1:17:55.760
 or in place of that sleep stack,

1:17:55.760 --> 1:17:57.580
 if that sleep stack doesn't work well for them.

1:17:57.580 --> 1:17:59.000
 So every third or fourth night,

1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:01.720
 I will take two grams of glycine

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:04.780
 and 100 milligrams of GABA in addition

1:18:04.780 --> 1:18:07.500
 to the standard sleep stack that I talked about before.

1:18:07.500 --> 1:18:09.680
 So I'm taking magthreonine, apigenin, and theanine,

1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:12.240
 and then I will also take two grams of glycine and GABA,

1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:16.080
 which I find greatly enhances my ability to get into sleep.

1:18:16.080 --> 1:18:19.400
 But the reason I only add glycine and GABA

1:18:19.400 --> 1:18:22.520
 every third or fourth night is that if I take it too often,

1:18:22.520 --> 1:18:24.080
 I find that the entire sleep stack

1:18:24.080 --> 1:18:25.580
 doesn't work quite as effectively.

1:18:25.580 --> 1:18:27.220
 I don't know exactly why this is the case,

1:18:27.220 --> 1:18:29.920
 but in any event, that's what I do.

1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:33.600
 And more recently, I've also started using inositol,

1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:36.760
 in particular, myoinositol every other night.

1:18:36.760 --> 1:18:39.320
 I'll take 900 milligrams of myoinositol

1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:42.600
 in addition to magthreonine, apigenin, and theanine,

1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:46.640
 and not on the nights when I take glycine and GABA.

1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:48.560
 So I'm adding 900 milligrams of inositol

1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:50.480
 to the standard sleep stack

1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:52.920
 of magthreonine, theanine, and apigenin.

1:18:52.920 --> 1:18:56.320
 And what I find is not only does it greatly enhance

1:18:56.320 --> 1:18:58.120
 my ability to fall asleep quickly,

1:18:58.120 --> 1:18:59.800
 but if I wake up in the middle of the night,

1:18:59.800 --> 1:19:02.560
 which I often do to use the bathroom,

1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:05.480
 I find it very, very easy to fall back asleep.

1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:10.280
 Whereas when I don't take inositol every other night or so,

1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:11.760
 I find that if I wake up in the middle of the night,

1:19:11.760 --> 1:19:14.380
 it's a bit more of a challenge to fall back asleep.

1:19:14.380 --> 1:19:16.960
 So inositol has a number of different uses

1:19:16.960 --> 1:19:19.560
 that have been discussed in terms of mental health

1:19:19.560 --> 1:19:22.720
 and in terms of adjusting anxiety for its daytime use.

1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:24.520
 What I'm talking about is taking 900 milligrams

1:19:24.520 --> 1:19:28.160
 of myoinositol also 30 to 60 minutes before sleep,

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:29.440
 along with the standard sleep stack.

1:19:29.440 --> 1:19:31.680
 And I found that to be immensely beneficial.

1:19:31.680 --> 1:19:34.160
 I also noticed that it has a pretty long tail

1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:37.240
 of anxiety suppression throughout the day.

1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:39.640
 And I'm not somebody who suffers from anxiety,

1:19:39.640 --> 1:19:41.780
 but I have to say it just has led me

1:19:41.780 --> 1:19:43.560
 to feel a bit calmer throughout the day.

1:19:43.560 --> 1:19:45.460
 And I don't really know how to say this,

1:19:45.460 --> 1:19:46.560
 except in subjective terms,

1:19:46.560 --> 1:19:48.560
 to feel a bit more buffered against

1:19:48.560 --> 1:19:50.600
 or resilience against stress events.

1:19:50.600 --> 1:19:52.600
 And if you look at the literature on inositol

1:19:52.600 --> 1:19:54.680
 and its interactions with the serotonin system

1:19:54.680 --> 1:19:56.180
 and other systems,

1:19:56.180 --> 1:19:58.320
 that all makes sense as to why that would be the case.

1:19:58.320 --> 1:20:00.400
 So we will provide links to our so-called sleep kit,

1:20:00.400 --> 1:20:02.240
 which is part of our neural network newsletter.

1:20:02.240 --> 1:20:03.360
 It's a zero cost newsletter

1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:05.000
 where you can access this information

1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:07.000
 about supplements and other behavioral tools

1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:08.620
 for sleep in list form.

1:20:08.620 --> 1:20:10.440
 But that sleep kit doesn't include

1:20:10.440 --> 1:20:11.460
 some of the newer information

1:20:11.460 --> 1:20:12.700
 that I've provided this episode,

1:20:12.700 --> 1:20:15.200
 in particular the information about inositol

1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:18.240
 and what I'm finding to be the very beneficial use

1:20:18.240 --> 1:20:22.240
 of inositol for the ability to fall back asleep

1:20:22.240 --> 1:20:23.560
 after waking up in the middle of the night,

1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:25.660
 which is something that a lot of people struggle with.

1:20:25.660 --> 1:20:28.340
 Now that's supplementation for falling and staying asleep,

1:20:28.340 --> 1:20:31.520
 but we can return to the behavioral tools

1:20:31.520 --> 1:20:35.320
 also as powerful levers and tools for falling asleep

1:20:35.320 --> 1:20:36.520
 and getting back to sleep.

1:20:36.520 --> 1:20:40.320
 And again, we look to NSDR, non-sleep deep rest,

1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:42.860
 or the Reverie app as a way to do that.

1:20:42.860 --> 1:20:43.700
 As I mentioned earlier,

1:20:43.700 --> 1:20:46.260
 the Reverie app has been developed

1:20:46.260 --> 1:20:49.240
 on the basis of really high quality peer reviewed research,

1:20:49.240 --> 1:20:51.400
 both clinical and non-clinical

1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:52.840
 by my colleague, David Spiegel,

1:20:52.840 --> 1:20:55.160
 who's our associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford.

1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:56.580
 It's a wonderful tool.

1:20:56.580 --> 1:21:00.400
 It does carry a cost after the initial seven day trial.

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:02.920
 I can tell you what the cost on that is

1:21:02.920 --> 1:21:06.160
 so you can get a sense because I do realize

1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:07.580
 that anything that carries a cost,

1:21:07.580 --> 1:21:09.420
 for some people, it won't be accessible.

1:21:09.420 --> 1:21:11.920
 Right now, Reverie, and I should just mention,

1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:13.160
 they didn't pay us for an ad read.

1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:14.660
 I'm just telling you what they told me

1:21:14.660 --> 1:21:19.380
 so that I can accurately report what it costs to use Reverie.

1:21:19.380 --> 1:21:21.040
 They have a monthly subscription

1:21:21.040 --> 1:21:23.200
 to use the Reverie app at 14.99.

1:21:23.200 --> 1:21:25.040
 You do get the seven day free trial.

1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:28.160
 They have a yearly subscription of 99.99

1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:29.240
 with a seven day free trial,

1:21:29.240 --> 1:21:30.680
 and they have a lifetime purchase,

1:21:30.680 --> 1:21:33.560
 one-time purchase of 2.49 with no trial.

1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:36.120
 Right now, it's only available for Apple, not for Android,

1:21:36.120 --> 1:21:39.080
 but they are, yes, going to have it available for Android.

1:21:39.080 --> 1:21:41.360
 Soon, there's a signup list there.

1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:45.360
 I should mention that while the cost might seem high,

1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:47.940
 if you compare that cost to, say, supplements,

1:21:47.940 --> 1:21:50.680
 or you compare that cost to a poor night's sleep over time,

1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:54.360
 the cost, at least to me, seems somewhat modest,

1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:56.360
 certainly within range for a number of people,

1:21:56.360 --> 1:21:59.040
 but I acknowledge not within range for other people,

1:21:59.040 --> 1:22:02.900
 which is why I also want to point to zero cost tools,

1:22:02.900 --> 1:22:06.120
 and the zero cost tool for getting asleep, staying asleep,

1:22:06.120 --> 1:22:09.680
 and falling back asleep is going to be NSDR.

1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:11.560
 We'll put a link to a non-sleep deep rest protocol

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:12.560
 that's available on YouTube,

1:22:12.560 --> 1:22:14.400
 so available to anybody, zero cost,

1:22:14.400 --> 1:22:16.840
 provided you have a internet connection.

1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:17.760
 Again, dim the screen

1:22:17.760 --> 1:22:19.600
 if you're going to turn that on late at night.

1:22:19.600 --> 1:22:22.660
 And there are a number of other Yoganidra scripts,

1:22:22.660 --> 1:22:25.620
 and apps, and sources around the internet,

1:22:25.620 --> 1:22:27.380
 in particular on YouTube, that are zero cost

1:22:27.380 --> 1:22:29.480
 that you could use if the Reverie app

1:22:29.480 --> 1:22:30.660
 is outside your price range,

1:22:30.660 --> 1:22:34.040
 or is not preferable to you, et cetera.

1:22:34.040 --> 1:22:35.440
 When I wake up in the middle of the night,

1:22:35.440 --> 1:22:36.560
 it's usually to use the restroom.

1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:37.400
 I'll go use the restroom.

1:22:37.400 --> 1:22:38.880
 We'll keep the lights as dim as possible.

1:22:38.880 --> 1:22:40.260
 I'll get back into bed,

1:22:40.260 --> 1:22:42.940
 and if I find that it's easy to fall asleep, great.

1:22:42.940 --> 1:22:43.780
 I'm asleep.

1:22:43.780 --> 1:22:46.520
 And if not, then I will generally plug in the Reverie app.

1:22:46.520 --> 1:22:48.880
 They have a fallback asleep hypnosis,

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:51.680
 and 99 times out of 100,

1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:53.160
 I'm back asleep within minutes,

1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:54.660
 and I don't wake up until morning.

1:22:54.660 --> 1:22:57.120
 Now, very briefly, I just want to touch on some tools

1:22:57.120 --> 1:22:59.200
 that are very commonly used by many people out there.

1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:00.040
 And believe it or not,

1:23:00.040 --> 1:23:03.020
 there is peer-reviewed science on things like eye masks.

1:23:03.020 --> 1:23:05.960
 Do eye masks improve your ability to stay asleep?

1:23:05.960 --> 1:23:09.160
 And indeed, they do, provided they are not too tight,

1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:11.840
 and provided that the room is cool enough.

1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:12.680
 Why?

1:23:12.680 --> 1:23:14.540
 Well, eye masks cover the upper half of your face,

1:23:14.540 --> 1:23:17.620
 which is where glabrous skin is localized.

1:23:17.620 --> 1:23:18.680
 Remember, palms of the hands,

1:23:18.680 --> 1:23:21.040
 bottoms of heat, glabrous skin on the face.

1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:23.720
 So a lot of people who wear eye masks will wake up

1:23:23.720 --> 1:23:25.640
 because they're too warm if the room is too warm.

1:23:25.640 --> 1:23:28.640
 So if you're going to use an eye mask to keep light out,

1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:31.120
 definitely make sure the room and your sleeping environment

1:23:31.120 --> 1:23:32.720
 and your bed are cool enough

1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.320
 in order for you to stay asleep.

1:23:34.320 --> 1:23:36.760
 In addition, I get a lot of questions about earplugs.

1:23:36.760 --> 1:23:38.040
 Here's the deal with earplugs.

1:23:38.040 --> 1:23:40.000
 Some people find that earplugs are very beneficial

1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:43.800
 because, of course, they prevent the entrance of sound

1:23:43.800 --> 1:23:45.720
 into the ear that could wake us up.

1:23:45.720 --> 1:23:48.460
 But some people find that the sound of their own beating

1:23:48.460 --> 1:23:50.800
 of their own heart can be disruptive.

1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:52.760
 And they get a sort of humming in their head

1:23:52.760 --> 1:23:54.520
 when they have those earplugs in.

1:23:54.520 --> 1:23:56.740
 I'm one such person, although I have family members

1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:58.480
 that like using earplugs when they sleep.

1:23:58.480 --> 1:23:59.640
 So it's really up to you.

1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:01.880
 You have to see whether or not those earplugs

1:24:01.880 --> 1:24:03.660
 help or disrupt your sleep.

1:24:03.660 --> 1:24:05.240
 For me, they're no good.

1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:06.920
 For some people, they really enjoy them.

1:24:06.920 --> 1:24:08.200
 I don't use an eye mask

1:24:08.200 --> 1:24:10.180
 unless I'm sleeping in a really bright environment

1:24:10.180 --> 1:24:13.640
 or I need to sleep on a plane and things of that sort.

1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:15.260
 Other tools that I'll just mention

1:24:15.260 --> 1:24:17.640
 that have peer-reviewed research to support them,

1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:19.520
 elevating your feet either with a pillow

1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:21.600
 or by elevating the end of your bed

1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:25.060
 by about three to five degrees can be really beneficial

1:24:25.060 --> 1:24:26.360
 for increasing the depth of sleep

1:24:26.360 --> 1:24:28.440
 because of the so-called glymphatic washout.

1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:30.780
 This is the movement and circulation of fluids

1:24:30.780 --> 1:24:34.520
 in your brain at night that lead to more wakefulness

1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:36.480
 and actually can improve cognitive function

1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:39.280
 and a number of other things related to brain health.

1:24:39.280 --> 1:24:40.720
 There's one caveat to that.

1:24:40.720 --> 1:24:43.040
 For people that suffer from acid reflux,

1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:45.960
 having your ankles elevated above your chest

1:24:45.960 --> 1:24:47.600
 or above your heart in the middle of the night

1:24:47.600 --> 1:24:49.900
 can actually exacerbate that acid reflux.

1:24:49.900 --> 1:24:51.040
 You want to do the opposite.

1:24:51.040 --> 1:24:54.080
 You want to actually elevate the head side of your bed

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:55.560
 by about three to five degrees.

1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:58.120
 Now, one of the common causes of sleep disruption

1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:00.880
 that has tremendously detrimental effects

1:25:00.880 --> 1:25:02.520
 is so-called sleep apnea.

1:25:02.520 --> 1:25:05.160
 So this is basically bouts of suffocation

1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:07.360
 or lack of oxygenation during sleep.

1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:09.280
 This is particularly the case for people

1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:10.480
 that are very heavyset,

1:25:10.480 --> 1:25:12.040
 and that heavyset could be from obesity.

1:25:12.040 --> 1:25:14.540
 It could also be heavyset from having too much muscle.

1:25:14.540 --> 1:25:17.000
 A lot of people who are carrying too much muscle

1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.100
 will actually have sleep apnea without realizing it.

1:25:19.100 --> 1:25:21.280
 Sleep apnea is actually very dangerous.

1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:23.960
 It's associated with a number of cardiovascular issues.

1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:25.400
 It's associated with sexual dysfunction.

1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:27.760
 It's associated with issues with cognition.

1:25:27.760 --> 1:25:28.760
 Sleep apnea is bad.

1:25:28.760 --> 1:25:30.800
 A lot of people will have to use the PAP,

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:32.640
 which is a device.

1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:36.200
 It looks like a sort of a snorkel mask or dive mask.

1:25:36.200 --> 1:25:40.160
 It's a whole apparatus that people go to sleep with.

1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:43.640
 However, many people can relieve themselves of sleep apnea

1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:46.480
 provided it's not too serious and can sleep much better.

1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:48.360
 In fact, I think all people can sleep much better

1:25:48.360 --> 1:25:50.800
 if they train themselves to be nose breathers

1:25:50.800 --> 1:25:52.240
 while they sleep.

1:25:52.240 --> 1:25:53.880
 There are a lot of reasons to be a nose breather

1:25:53.880 --> 1:25:56.960
 unless you are breathing very hard due to exercise

1:25:56.960 --> 1:25:58.760
 or talking or eating.

1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:01.000
 That was all covered in James Nestor's book,

1:26:01.000 --> 1:26:02.920
 Breath, The New Science of a Lost Art.

1:26:02.920 --> 1:26:04.840
 It's been covered in a number of different podcasts.

1:26:04.840 --> 1:26:07.520
 We've talked about it on this podcast as well.

1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:08.900
 It's a good idea to be a nose breather

1:26:08.900 --> 1:26:10.440
 unless you need to mouth breathe.

1:26:10.440 --> 1:26:11.960
 And it's a great idea.

1:26:11.960 --> 1:26:15.960
 It's a superb idea to be a nose breather in sleep.

1:26:15.960 --> 1:26:17.760
 And one way to really get good at that

1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:19.120
 is to take a little bit of medical tape

1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:21.400
 and to tape your mouth shut before going to sleep.

1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:23.860
 You heard me right, put some medical tape over your mouth

1:26:23.860 --> 1:26:26.120
 and force yourself to nose breathe during sleep.

1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:28.860
 It also prevents snoring in most cases,

1:26:28.860 --> 1:26:31.680
 really offset sleep apnea.

1:26:31.680 --> 1:26:34.920
 Sleep apnea, again, being a very serious health concern.

1:26:34.920 --> 1:26:36.820
 I should also mention as a tool

1:26:36.820 --> 1:26:39.960
 that if you have a hard time being a nose breather in sleep,

1:26:39.960 --> 1:26:42.520
 you can try doing your cardiovascular exercise,

1:26:42.520 --> 1:26:45.300
 at least the lower intensity cardiovascular exercise

1:26:45.300 --> 1:26:47.600
 through purely nasal breathing.

1:26:47.600 --> 1:26:49.980
 And one way to do that again is to tape your mouth shut

1:26:49.980 --> 1:26:51.200
 or put a gulp of water in your mouth,

1:26:51.200 --> 1:26:54.360
 but don't actually swallow that mouthful of water

1:26:54.360 --> 1:26:57.460
 or to use a mouthpiece or just deliberately

1:26:57.460 --> 1:26:58.300
 keep your mouth closed

1:26:58.300 --> 1:27:00.040
 and insist on breathing through your nose.

1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:00.880
 Most people find that

1:27:00.880 --> 1:27:03.000
 when they start doing cardiovascular exercise that way,

1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:04.960
 it's really challenging at first,

1:27:04.960 --> 1:27:07.460
 but over time they actually can feel quite calm

1:27:07.460 --> 1:27:10.000
 and still can generate a lot of physical effort

1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.240
 purely using nose breathing.

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:13.840
 The reason that doing nose breathing

1:27:13.840 --> 1:27:15.280
 during cardiovascular exercise

1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:17.640
 translates to being a nose breather during sleep

1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:21.040
 is that your sinuses actually can dilate their plastic

1:27:21.040 --> 1:27:25.240
 and over time, plastic meaning they're malleable, that is,

1:27:25.240 --> 1:27:26.680
 and they can become wider.

1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:28.520
 You're not going to get giant nostrils, don't worry about it.

1:27:28.520 --> 1:27:31.400
 Your airways within your skull,

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:33.080
 because that's what the sinuses really are,

1:27:33.080 --> 1:27:34.860
 these little passages within the skull

1:27:34.860 --> 1:27:36.760
 and of course within the nasal passages,

1:27:36.760 --> 1:27:38.920
 will dilate and will allow you

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:40.260
 to breathe more easily through your nose.

1:27:40.260 --> 1:27:42.280
 But for those of you that are waking up

1:27:42.280 --> 1:27:43.760
 in the middle of the night, breathing on your back,

1:27:43.760 --> 1:27:46.180
 ah, ah, or your partner is telling you that,

1:27:46.180 --> 1:27:47.560
 or other people are telling you that,

1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:49.680
 or that person on the plane with your mouth hanging open

1:27:49.680 --> 1:27:51.880
 and drooling and your mouth breathing,

1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:53.200
 terrible, terrible, terrible

1:27:53.200 --> 1:27:54.800
 for health reasons and other reasons.

1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:56.500
 Put some medical take over your mouth,

1:27:56.500 --> 1:27:58.300
 learn to be a nose breather during sleep.

1:27:58.300 --> 1:27:59.520
 Your sleep will improve

1:27:59.520 --> 1:28:02.440
 and your daytime feelings of wakefulness and focus

1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:05.120
 will improve, your cardiovascular health will improve

1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:06.200
 and on and on and on.

1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:07.920
 So now we've largely covered the tools

1:28:07.920 --> 1:28:10.720
 that one could use to get and stay asleep.

1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:12.740
 And we talked about exercise, we talked about temperature,

1:28:12.740 --> 1:28:15.200
 we talked about supplements, and we talked about,

1:28:15.200 --> 1:28:17.240
 of course, keeping the sleeping environment

1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:20.820
 both cool and as dark as possible.

1:28:20.820 --> 1:28:24.360
 I do want to mention a couple of broad contour tools

1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:27.440
 that will impact your ability to sleep really well

1:28:27.440 --> 1:28:28.600
 on a consistent basis.

1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:30.760
 And the one that impacts the most number of people

1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:33.000
 is weekends.

1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:35.640
 It turns out that most everybody feels the impulse

1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:36.920
 to sleep in on the weekend,

1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:38.980
 especially if they've been out late the night before.

1:28:38.980 --> 1:28:41.760
 However, the data show that keeping

1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:44.260
 relatively consistent sleep and wake times

1:28:44.260 --> 1:28:46.360
 is really going to enhance the quality

1:28:46.360 --> 1:28:47.880
 and depth of your sleep.

1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:50.000
 So if you stay out late one night,

1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:51.860
 sure, you might allow yourself to sleep in

1:28:51.860 --> 1:28:52.920
 an extra hour or so,

1:28:52.920 --> 1:28:56.800
 but you should really try to avoid sleeping in longer

1:28:56.800 --> 1:29:00.280
 than an hour beyond your normal wake-up time.

1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:01.120
 That's right.

1:29:01.120 --> 1:29:02.640
 If you normally get eight hours of sleep

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:04.780
 and you wake up at 7 a.m.,

1:29:04.780 --> 1:29:08.240
 probably okay to wake up at 8 a.m. on the weekend

1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:10.820
 or after a night out the night before,

1:29:10.820 --> 1:29:13.140
 but try not to sleep until 11 or noon,

1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:15.060
 thinking that you're going to catch up on your sleep

1:29:15.060 --> 1:29:17.420
 or that's better than waking up at a consistent time.

1:29:17.420 --> 1:29:19.460
 It would be better to wake up at a consistent time,

1:29:19.460 --> 1:29:20.640
 plus or minus an hour,

1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:22.060
 and get a nap in the afternoon,

1:29:22.060 --> 1:29:25.120
 provided that nap, again, isn't too long.

1:29:25.120 --> 1:29:27.640
 And the other tool that relates to nights

1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:28.880
 that you stayed out too late

1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:31.760
 or that you feel like you want to sleep in a bit more

1:29:31.760 --> 1:29:35.240
 in the morning is if you are going to wake up

1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:36.140
 at your consistent time.

1:29:36.140 --> 1:29:39.200
 So for example, normally you go to bed at 10

1:29:39.200 --> 1:29:40.240
 and you wake up at six.

1:29:40.240 --> 1:29:42.160
 Let's say that's your schedule.

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:44.880
 And you end up staying up late one night until midnight

1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:47.200
 or one for whatever reason.

1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:49.320
 And the next morning you wake up at seven

1:29:49.320 --> 1:29:50.620
 and you're still groggy.

1:29:51.540 --> 1:29:54.160
 In that case, you absolutely want to wait

1:29:54.160 --> 1:29:57.480
 to ingest caffeine 90 to 120 minutes after waking.

1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:59.780
 You really do because there are good data

1:29:59.780 --> 1:30:02.940
 to support the fact that caffeine can disrupt sleep.

1:30:03.820 --> 1:30:05.040
 Yes, that's obvious.

1:30:05.040 --> 1:30:07.000
 Caffeine especially disrupts sleep

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:08.920
 if you take it too late in the day.

1:30:08.920 --> 1:30:11.520
 That's very obvious as to why that would be the case.

1:30:11.520 --> 1:30:14.460
 But caffeine especially disrupts

1:30:14.460 --> 1:30:16.640
 what's called compensatory sleep.

1:30:16.640 --> 1:30:19.560
 So if you start changing your waking time

1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:20.600
 and your to sleep time

1:30:20.600 --> 1:30:23.180
 and you start using additional caffeine

1:30:23.180 --> 1:30:25.320
 to offset the sleepiness that you're experiencing

1:30:25.320 --> 1:30:26.840
 because of those late nights out,

1:30:26.840 --> 1:30:28.920
 well, that's when you really start to disrupt

1:30:28.920 --> 1:30:30.360
 not just your nighttime sleep

1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:31.920
 but your daytime compensatory sleep.

1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:34.220
 So those naps, you also are disrupting

1:30:34.220 --> 1:30:37.420
 the total architecture of sleep in the early morning hours.

1:30:37.420 --> 1:30:40.200
 There's a lot of great science that's been put to this

1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:42.200
 or that's emerged from this, I should say.

1:30:42.200 --> 1:30:45.400
 So try and keep those sleep wake times relatively constant

1:30:45.400 --> 1:30:46.480
 plus or minus an hour

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:50.440
 and try as much as you can to delay that caffeine intake

1:30:50.440 --> 1:30:52.980
 90 to 120 minutes after waking every day

1:30:52.980 --> 1:30:55.240
 but especially on days where you wake up

1:30:55.240 --> 1:30:56.620
 and you feel you haven't gotten enough sleep.

1:30:56.620 --> 1:30:59.360
 In that case, I highly recommend you just use NSDR

1:30:59.360 --> 1:31:03.520
 or the Reverie app or some other form of deep relaxation

1:31:03.520 --> 1:31:05.720
 to try and compensate for the lack of sleep.

1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:10.580
 Knowing of course, that there's no complete compensation

1:31:10.580 --> 1:31:11.420
 for lack of sleep.

1:31:11.420 --> 1:31:12.620
 There are just things that we can do

1:31:12.620 --> 1:31:14.820
 to partially offset lack of sleep.

1:31:14.820 --> 1:31:17.280
 Now, a couple of final points and additional tools

1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:19.760
 that I think are going to be useful to everybody.

1:31:19.760 --> 1:31:22.720
 In particular, people who have young children

1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:25.460
 or following a shift work schedule

1:31:25.460 --> 1:31:28.580
 or who are experiencing jet lag.

1:31:28.580 --> 1:31:31.920
 Keep in mind, jet lag can be due to travel, which is obvious

1:31:31.920 --> 1:31:34.680
 but jet lag can also be due to getting woken up

1:31:34.680 --> 1:31:35.660
 in the middle of the night, right?

1:31:35.660 --> 1:31:36.720
 Your body doesn't know the difference

1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:38.860
 between flying to a new time zone

1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:41.000
 and getting woken up in the middle of the night.

1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:43.360
 The tool that I'd like to offer you is an understanding

1:31:43.360 --> 1:31:45.220
 of something called temperature minimum.

1:31:45.220 --> 1:31:46.960
 And I'm going to make this as simple as possible

1:31:46.960 --> 1:31:49.080
 and I'm confident that everyone can understand this

1:31:49.080 --> 1:31:52.000
 even if you don't have any science background.

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.440
 Here's the question you need to ask yourself.

1:31:54.440 --> 1:31:57.960
 What is your typical wake-up time?

1:31:57.960 --> 1:31:59.300
 Okay, what's your typical wake-up time?

1:31:59.300 --> 1:32:00.880
 If for you, your typical wake-up time

1:32:00.880 --> 1:32:03.440
 is 7 a.m. plus or minus half an hour.

1:32:03.440 --> 1:32:06.440
 So, and that could be 7 a.m. because you set an alarm clock

1:32:06.440 --> 1:32:08.580
 or it could be 7 a.m. because you naturally wake up

1:32:08.580 --> 1:32:10.040
 at 7 a.m., doesn't matter.

1:32:10.040 --> 1:32:13.720
 If your typical wake-up time most days is 7 a.m.,

1:32:13.720 --> 1:32:16.600
 well, then your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.

1:32:16.600 --> 1:32:18.960
 That's right, your temperature minimum is not a temperature,

1:32:18.960 --> 1:32:21.880
 it's a time within your 24-hour cycle.

1:32:22.920 --> 1:32:26.120
 Approximately two hours before your typical wake-up time,

1:32:26.120 --> 1:32:28.560
 your body is at its lowest temperature

1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:31.080
 that it will ever be in the 24-hour cycle.

1:32:31.080 --> 1:32:33.440
 That's why it's called your temperature minimum.

1:32:33.440 --> 1:32:35.680
 Here's what you need to know about your temperature minimum.

1:32:35.680 --> 1:32:40.640
 If you view bright light, exercise, or drink caffeine,

1:32:40.640 --> 1:32:44.560
 or all of the above in the two to four hours

1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:47.400
 before your temperature minimum,

1:32:47.400 --> 1:32:49.560
 that will delay your clock.

1:32:49.560 --> 1:32:51.400
 What that means when I say delay your clock

1:32:51.400 --> 1:32:54.120
 is it will make you want to go to sleep later

1:32:54.120 --> 1:32:56.600
 and wake up later the next night.

1:32:56.600 --> 1:32:58.760
 Okay, so let's run this exercise for you,

1:32:58.760 --> 1:33:02.040
 the person waking up at 7 a.m. on a regular basis.

1:33:02.040 --> 1:33:04.460
 I can predict with almost certainty

1:33:04.460 --> 1:33:07.420
 that your body is going to be at its lowest temperature

1:33:07.420 --> 1:33:08.720
 at 5 a.m.

1:33:08.720 --> 1:33:12.640
 So what that means is that if you get up at 3 a.m.

1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:16.640
 or at 4 a.m., and you flip on bright lights in your house

1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:18.980
 or in your bathroom, or you have a cup of coffee,

1:33:18.980 --> 1:33:20.300
 or you do any kind of exercise,

1:33:20.300 --> 1:33:22.740
 or you get up and head to the airport,

1:33:22.740 --> 1:33:25.240
 the mechanisms in your brain and body

1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:27.640
 that control timing of sleep and timing of waking

1:33:27.640 --> 1:33:29.360
 will shift, they will delay.

1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:32.500
 It's as if you put your clock on hold for a little while

1:33:32.500 --> 1:33:34.160
 and then let it start again.

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:35.720
 That's the simplest way I can describe it.

1:33:35.720 --> 1:33:38.680
 And you will tend to want to go to sleep later

1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:41.520
 and wake up later the following night.

1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:46.040
 Now, the opposite is true if you view bright light,

1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:50.040
 drink caffeine, or exercise, or socialize, I should say,

1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:53.740
 in the hours immediately after your temperature minimum.

1:33:53.740 --> 1:33:55.620
 So for you, in this example,

1:33:55.620 --> 1:33:57.440
 the person who's waking up at 7 a.m.,

1:33:57.440 --> 1:33:59.280
 your temperature minimum is 5 a.m.,

1:33:59.280 --> 1:34:01.120
 if you view bright light, exercise,

1:34:01.120 --> 1:34:04.040
 maybe have a snack, maybe not, or socialize,

1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:08.560
 move about at 5.30 or 6 a.m. or 7 a.m.,

1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:12.320
 that will tend to phase advance your clock.

1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:15.960
 It will tend to basically make you want to go to bed earlier

1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:18.160
 and wake up earlier the following night.

1:34:18.160 --> 1:34:19.600
 Now, I use this example of a person

1:34:19.600 --> 1:34:21.400
 who wakes up typically at 7 a.m.,

1:34:21.400 --> 1:34:22.960
 whose temperature minimum is 5 a.m.,

1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:25.720
 but of course you need to adjust that for yourself

1:34:25.720 --> 1:34:27.840
 if you're somebody who wakes up at 9 a.m. or at 5 a.m.,

1:34:27.840 --> 1:34:28.720
 et cetera.

1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:30.060
 Why do I offer this as a tool?

1:34:30.060 --> 1:34:32.560
 Well, this is an immensely powerful tool

1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:34.760
 if, for instance, you're headed to a time zone

1:34:34.760 --> 1:34:36.040
 where you need to go to bed earlier

1:34:36.040 --> 1:34:38.720
 and wake up earlier once you arrive in that time zone.

1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:41.520
 What it means is in the day or two before you leave,

1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:46.520
 you can force yourself to exercise, drink caffeine,

1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:49.000
 maybe even to eat a meal early in the morning,

1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.600
 or maybe you still fast early in the morning,

1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:51.760
 and that's really up to you,

1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:54.520
 but you force yourself to do the activities

1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:57.380
 that are going to phase advance your clock,

1:34:57.380 --> 1:34:59.280
 whereas if you're traveling to a time zone

1:34:59.280 --> 1:35:02.040
 where you are going to need to go to sleep much later

1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:05.040
 and you're going to need to wake up much later,

1:35:05.040 --> 1:35:06.320
 even a little bit later,

1:35:06.320 --> 1:35:08.440
 you can do those things in the hours

1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:10.740
 prior to your temperature minimum.

1:35:10.740 --> 1:35:12.520
 Now, for those of you that work shift work,

1:35:12.520 --> 1:35:14.340
 this can be especially useful,

1:35:14.340 --> 1:35:17.540
 but I want to say a couple of things about shift work.

1:35:17.540 --> 1:35:19.640
 There are a lot of details about shift work and jet lag

1:35:19.640 --> 1:35:21.360
 in an episode that I did specifically

1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:22.840
 about jet lag and shift work,

1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:24.160
 so for the deep dive, go there,

1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:26.520
 but suffice to say this for now,

1:35:27.600 --> 1:35:29.160
 if you are going to do shift work,

1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:32.040
 try to stay on the same shift for two weeks at a time.

1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:34.340
 It's very detrimental to brain and body.

1:35:34.340 --> 1:35:37.740
 It can even be horrifically challenging

1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:39.520
 for your brain and body in a number of ways.

1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:42.400
 If you are switching on the so-called swing shift,

1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:43.880
 you know, you're working three days the night shift,

1:35:43.880 --> 1:35:44.720
 three days the day shift,

1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:46.000
 three days the night shift, three days the,

1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:49.020
 try and stay on the same schedule as much as possible,

1:35:49.020 --> 1:35:50.920
 and I should say for everybody,

1:35:50.920 --> 1:35:54.840
 people who are jet lagged and engaged in shift work or not,

1:35:54.840 --> 1:35:55.900
 but just for everybody,

1:35:55.900 --> 1:35:59.680
 if you need to be awake in the middle of your sleep cycle,

1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:02.380
 and it's not just a quick departure to the bathroom

1:36:02.380 --> 1:36:04.560
 and back to bed, but you really need to be awake.

1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:05.780
 You know, you're feeding a baby

1:36:05.780 --> 1:36:08.160
 or you're taking care of a loved one

1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:09.580
 or you need to do something that's critical

1:36:09.580 --> 1:36:13.000
 or you need to work, if possible, use red light, okay?

1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:15.400
 Now, for shift workers who really are trying

1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:17.480
 to stay awake all night and sleep all day,

1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:18.840
 this is not going to be ideal,

1:36:18.840 --> 1:36:21.160
 but for people that, for instance, need to stay up

1:36:21.160 --> 1:36:23.340
 really late one night or wake up especially early,

1:36:23.340 --> 1:36:25.080
 like 3 a.m. to prepare for an exam

1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:26.520
 that you're just not ready for,

1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:29.360
 or to head to the airport, et cetera,

1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:32.080
 using red light has been shown to allow people

1:36:32.080 --> 1:36:34.760
 to be awake enough and obviously see what they need to see

1:36:34.760 --> 1:36:37.080
 in order to perform their activity safely,

1:36:37.080 --> 1:36:40.680
 but it does not seem to disrupt the cortisol rhythm

1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:43.340
 that is the healthy, normal cortisol rhythm.

1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:45.360
 I realize this is kind of an advanced tool

1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:46.920
 and many people won't have access to this.

1:36:46.920 --> 1:36:48.200
 There are a number of different sources

1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:50.040
 for red lights now.

1:36:50.040 --> 1:36:53.000
 Companies like Juve or Cozy Light,

1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:54.100
 these are different brands.

1:36:54.100 --> 1:36:55.920
 I don't have any affiliation to any of these brands,

1:36:55.920 --> 1:36:56.760
 I should say.

1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:00.100
 There are a number of different red light bulb sources

1:37:00.100 --> 1:37:01.240
 out there and commercial sources

1:37:01.240 --> 1:37:02.700
 that you can explore if you want,

1:37:02.700 --> 1:37:04.720
 but understanding this temperature minimum

1:37:04.720 --> 1:37:07.020
 is really powerful because it allows you

1:37:07.020 --> 1:37:08.800
 to adjust your schedule depending on travel,

1:37:08.800 --> 1:37:11.520
 depending on changing work schedules or school schedules,

1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:12.880
 and if you're not a morning person,

1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:15.640
 you can use the tools related to temperature minimum

1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:18.600
 to really become a morning person over time,

1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:20.120
 and it actually is pretty easy,

1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:22.400
 and I talked about this in a previous episode,

1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:24.320
 but I'll just mention that there have been shown

1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:27.240
 to be important positive effects on cognition,

1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:29.680
 on even grip strength and physical performance

1:37:29.680 --> 1:37:32.920
 for people that are early morning risers,

1:37:32.920 --> 1:37:35.440
 and that's especially true for night owls

1:37:35.440 --> 1:37:38.680
 that deliberately shift themselves to become early risers.

1:37:38.680 --> 1:37:41.160
 Okay, so that's a lot of information and a lot of tools,

1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:42.620
 and I suppose the one set of tools

1:37:42.620 --> 1:37:45.280
 that I really didn't drill into too deeply,

1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:47.080
 the ones related to jet lag and shift work,

1:37:47.080 --> 1:37:49.220
 and again, please check out the episode

1:37:49.220 --> 1:37:52.160
 on jet lag and shift work if that's relevant to you,

1:37:52.160 --> 1:37:55.920
 but I think for most people who are going to sleep at night

1:37:55.920 --> 1:37:58.500
 and are trying their best to sleep well at night

1:37:58.500 --> 1:38:00.640
 and are trying their best to wake up in the morning

1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:02.800
 at whatever hour and stay alert and focused

1:38:02.800 --> 1:38:04.840
 throughout the day and maybe with a brief nap,

1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:06.080
 the tools that I talked about today

1:38:06.080 --> 1:38:09.080
 related to light temperature, food, exercise,

1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:12.400
 caffeine, supplements, and digital tools,

1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:15.420
 I'm hoping will prove to be very useful for you.

1:38:15.420 --> 1:38:17.220
 They certainly are all supported

1:38:17.220 --> 1:38:19.500
 by excellent peer-reviewed research,

1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:21.060
 and I should just emphasize again

1:38:21.060 --> 1:38:22.580
 that most of the tools we talked about

1:38:22.580 --> 1:38:24.520
 are completely zero cost,

1:38:24.520 --> 1:38:26.940
 so while the supplements and some of the digital tools

1:38:26.940 --> 1:38:29.060
 do carry some cost to them,

1:38:29.060 --> 1:38:30.400
 I really want to encourage everybody

1:38:30.400 --> 1:38:32.240
 to get your behaviors right,

1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:35.280
 get all of the things related to your timing of exercise

1:38:35.280 --> 1:38:39.320
 and type of exercise in the best possible order

1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:40.160
 and time of day.

1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:42.440
 We talked about this critical period early in the day

1:38:42.440 --> 1:38:44.460
 and then another critical period in the middle of the day

1:38:44.460 --> 1:38:45.360
 and the late afternoon,

1:38:45.360 --> 1:38:46.600
 and then this third critical period

1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:47.540
 in the middle of the night.

1:38:47.540 --> 1:38:50.680
 Different tools for the different three critical periods.

1:38:50.680 --> 1:38:53.220
 I promise that if you start to implement some

1:38:53.220 --> 1:38:55.460
 or ideally all of these tools,

1:38:55.460 --> 1:38:58.360
 the quality of your sleep will increase tremendously,

1:38:58.360 --> 1:39:00.400
 and of course, in doing so,

1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:02.160
 the quality of your daytime alertness

1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:04.560
 and your ability of focus will improve tremendously.

1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:08.480
 Again, sleep is the absolute foundation

1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:10.320
 of your mental health, your physical health,

1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:12.280
 and your performance in all endeavors.

1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:16.360
 So if there's one area of your life to really focus on

1:39:16.360 --> 1:39:17.700
 and try and optimize,

1:39:17.700 --> 1:39:20.080
 if your goal is to be happier and more productive

1:39:20.080 --> 1:39:22.960
 and just to have a better life overall,

1:39:22.960 --> 1:39:25.520
 I can confidently say that sleep

1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:27.500
 is really the thing to optimize.

1:39:27.500 --> 1:39:29.600

 please put all that in the comment section on YouTube.

1:39:57.140 --> 1:39:59.500
 We do read all those comments.

 In addition, please check out the sponsors mentioned

1:40:01.440 --> 1:40:02.880
 at the beginning of today's podcast.

 That's the best way to support this podcast.

1:40:05.540 --> 1:40:07.780
 During today's podcast and on many previous episodes

1:40:07.780 --> 1:40:10.060
 of the Huberman Lab podcast, we talked about supplements.

1:40:10.060 --> 1:40:12.200
 While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,

1:40:12.200 --> 1:40:14.120
 many people derive tremendous benefit from them

1:40:14.120 --> 1:40:15.780
 for things like sleep and focus

1:40:15.780 --> 1:40:17.480
 and hormone support and so forth.

1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:19.380
 For reasons mentioned at the beginning of the episode,

1:40:19.380 --> 1:40:21.680
 we are now partnered with Momentous Supplements.

1:40:21.680 --> 1:40:24.340
 If you go to livemomentous.com slash Huberman,

1:40:24.340 --> 1:40:26.560
 you'll see many of the supplements described in today's

1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:28.880
 and other episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast.

1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:31.280
 Again, all as single ingredient formulations.

1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:32.800
 They ship internationally.

1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:34.800
 Their quality is exceedingly high.

1:40:34.800 --> 1:40:38.720
 And by largely focusing on single ingredient

1:40:38.720 --> 1:40:41.560
 and various dosages of different supplements,

1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:44.680
 you can create the optimized supplement protocol for you.

1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:47.380
 If you're not already following us on social media,

1:40:47.380 --> 1:40:49.200
 we are Huberman Lab on Instagram

1:40:49.200 --> 1:40:51.200
 and also Huberman Lab on Twitter.

1:40:51.200 --> 1:40:53.700
 There I cover science and science related tools,

1:40:53.700 --> 1:40:55.360
 some of which overlaps with the content

1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:57.840
 of the Huberman Lab podcast and other of which,

1:40:57.840 --> 1:40:59.240
 I should say much of which is distinct

1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:01.480
 from the information covered on this podcast.

1:41:01.480 --> 1:41:03.760
 If you're interested in obtaining protocols

1:41:03.760 --> 1:41:05.760
 or summaries from these podcasts,

1:41:05.760 --> 1:41:07.680
 you can get those completely free of cost

1:41:07.680 --> 1:41:09.120
 by going to HubermanLab.com,

1:41:09.120 --> 1:41:11.240
 go to the menu at HubermanLab.com,

1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:12.900
 go to the neural network newsletter.

1:41:12.900 --> 1:41:14.960
 You simply provide us your email

1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:16.540
 and you'll get the neural network newsletter

1:41:16.540 --> 1:41:17.880
 for free each month.

1:41:17.880 --> 1:41:20.320
 You can also find previous newsletters there

1:41:20.320 --> 1:41:22.200
 at HubermanLab.com.

1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:25.300
 For instance, toolkit for sleep or deliberate cold exposure

1:41:25.300 --> 1:41:26.480
 and so on and so forth.

1:41:26.480 --> 1:41:28.880
 Again, we don't share your email with anybody.

1:41:28.880 --> 1:41:31.360
 So our privacy policy is made very clear there

1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:33.000
 and it's completely zero cost.

1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:34.240
 So thank you for joining me today

1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:37.200
 for our discussion about tools for optimizing sleep

1:41:37.200 --> 1:41:41.360
 and in doing so, tools for optimizing, not just sleep,

1:41:41.360 --> 1:41:44.360
 but your daytime feelings of alertness and focus

1:41:44.360 --> 1:41:45.800
 and your overall health.

1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:47.900
 And last, but certainly not least,

1:41:47.900 --> 1:41:49.640
 thank you for your interest in science.

1:41:49.640 --> 1:42:17.640
 I'll see you in the next one.
